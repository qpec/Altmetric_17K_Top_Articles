High-throughput genomic analyses may improve outcomes in patients with advanced 
cancers. MOSCATO 01 is a prospective clinical trial evaluating the clinical benefit of 
this approach. Nucleic acids were extracted from fresh-frozen tumor biopsies and analyzed by array 
comparative genomic hybridization, next-generation sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The primary 
objective was to evaluate clinical benefit as measured by the percentage of patients presenting progres-
sion-free survival (PFS) on matched therapy (PFS2) 1.3-fold longer than the PFS on prior therapy (PFS1). 
A total of 1,035 adult patients were included, and a biopsy was performed in 948. An actionable molecu-
lar alteration was identified in 411 of 843 patients with a molecular portrait. A total of 199 patients 
were treated with a targeted therapy matched to a genomic alteration. The PFS2/PFS1 ratio was >1.3 in 
33% of the patients (63/193). Objective responses were observed in 22 of 194 patients (11%; 95% CI, 
7%–17%), and median overall survival was 11.9 months (95% CI, 9.5–14.3 months).
SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests that high-throughput genomics could improve outcomes in a 
subset of patients with hard-to-treat cancers. Although these results are encouraging, only 7% of the 
successfully screened patients benefited from this approach. Randomized trials are needed to validate 
this hypothesis and to quantify the magnitude of benefit. Expanding drug access could increase the 
percentage of patients who benefit. Cancer Discov; 7(6); 586–95. ©2017 AACR.

iNtRODUctiON
Oncogenic drivers are genomic alterations that lead to malig-
nant transformation and cancer progression (1, 2). Targeting 
oncogenic drivers improves outcomes in patients with meta-
static cancers. For example, ALK and EGFR inhibitors have 
been shown to improve outcomes in patients presenting with 
ALK translocations or EGFR activating mutations (3, 4). Nev-
ertheless, the number of approved targeted therapies that are 
matched to a genomic alteration remains rare. As of 2016, 
only nine genomic alterations are assessed in daily practice 
in patients with metastatic cancers to decide about targeted 
therapies. In the last 5 years, sequencing efforts have gener-
ated considerable advances in the knowledge of cancer biology. 
First, although only a few genetic somatic abnormalities are 
tested in oncology, it is believed that >400 genes could drive 
tumor progression (5). Second, most of the frequent cancers 
present a large number of very rare targetable genomic altera-
tions (6). Several cases reported in the literature support the 
concept that targeting a rare genomic event could translate into 
patient benefit. As an illustration, a patient with an activating 
mTOR mutation presented an outlier response to everolimus 
(7). Third, some oncogenic drivers, like BRAF mutations or 
ERBB2 amplifications, are shared across several diseases (8, 9), 
and their targeting could improve outcomes (10, 11).
These considerations have generated the hypothesis that 
testing a large number of genes across all tumor types could 
improve outcomes in patients with “hard-to-treat” advanced 
cancers. New advances in biotechnologies allow testing of a 
large number of gene abnormalities in individuals with good 
analytic validity (12). Several trials have shown that these 
technologies can be delivered in the context of clinical ini-
tiatives (13, 14). Nevertheless, there is as yet no evidence that 
this approach improves outcome. In the present single-center 
single-arm open-label trial, we have evaluated the clinical 
 
benefit of testing a large panel of genes in patients with 
advanced “hard-to-treat” cancers.
ResUlts
Study Flow and Screening Phase
The study flow is reported in Fig. 1. Overall, 1,035 adult 
patients gave signed informed consent between December 2011 
and March 2016 for the MOSCATO trial (NCT01566019), a 
successful tumor biopsy was performed in 948 of them, and 
a molecular portrait was obtained in 843 (89%). Patient charac-
teristics are reported in Table 1. The most frequent tumor types 
included digestive cancer (n = 197), lung cancer (n = 170), urologi-
cal cancer (n = 158), breast cancer (n = 135), and head and neck 
cancers (n = 111). The main sites of biopsy were liver (n = 353), 
lung (n = 203), lymph nodes (n = 153), and bone metastases 
 
(n = 44). The following complications occurred: pneumo-
thorax (n = 13), hemorrhage (n = 2), and others (n = 13).

All patients recovered after medical treatment without any 
deaths related to biopsy procedure.
The techniques used to obtain molecular portraits for 
843 patients at the start of the MOSCATO trial included 
targeted sequencing (feasible for 837 patients) and array com-
parative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis (feasible for 
745 patients). During the course of the trial, RNA sequenc-
ing (RNA-seq; 427 patients) and whole-exome sequencing 
were added (166 patients). Genomic reports were validated 
by a molecular geneticist and discussed during a weekly 
multidisciplinary molecular tumor board dedicated to the 
MOSCATO trial. Actionability of the target was defined by 
the molecular board. An actionable target was detected in 
411 patients (49% of the 843 patients with a molecular por-
trait). In some patients, actionable targets were identified by 
multiple tests. Actionable targets were identified by targeted 
sequencing in 255 patients, by aCGH in 252 patients, by IHC 
in 17 patients, and by FISH in 16 patients. The median time 
from signed consent to biopsy and from biopsy to molecular 
board (encompassing sequencing and aCGH analyses) was 19 
days [interquartile range (IQR), 6–33 days] and 21 days (IQR, 
14–27 days), respectively. We did not observe any meaningful 
difference in time from biopsy to molecular tumor board 
between the 64 patients with clinical deterioration (median 
of 21 days; IQR, 19–26) and the other patients (median, 21 
days; IQR, 14–26 days).
Patient Characteristics in the Treatment Phase
One hundred ninety-nine patients received a therapy 
matched to the genomic alteration in the subsequent line of 
therapy, based on CGH (105 patients), targeted sequencing 
(85 patients), and MET-positive IHC (9 patients). This repre-
sents 19% of the patients who consented (95% CI, 17%–22%) 
and 24% of the patients for whom a molecular portrait was 
successfully obtained. Reasons for not providing targeted 
therapies in the other 212 patients with a targetable alteration 
are outlined in Fig. 1. Patient characteristics of the matched 
treatment population are reported in Table 1. Patients received 
a median of 4 prior lines of treatment for advanced disease 
(1–14). The median Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) score was 
1 (0–3). The vast majority of the patients received matched 
therapy in the context of phase I/II trials (n = 149, 75%). The 
matched therapies used in the trial are listed in Table 2. One 
hundred twenty-seven patients were treated with single-agent 
targeted therapy, and 72 patients received a combination 
(chemotherapy in 42 cases; targeted therapy in 30).

The actionable genomic alterations were located in 53 
genes; 98 were amplifications and 23 deletions or loss, 103 
mutations, 18 were translocations, and 8 were based on IHC.
The genes that contained molecular alterations that were the 
actual targets of the chosen matched treatment are reported 
in Fig. 2 (and according to tumor type in Supplementary 
Fig. S1). The most frequent targeted alterations were PIK3CA 
mutations and amplifications (n = 32), ERBB2 mutations 
and amplifications (n = 24), PTEN mutations and deletions 
 
(n = 15), FGFR1 mutations and amplifications (n = 13), EGFR 
mutations and amplifications (n = 13), and NOTCH1/2/3/4 
mutations, amplifications, or translocations (n = 12).
Efficacy
The primary endpoint could be evaluated in 193 patients 
(PFS1 was not available in 5 patients, and 1 patient had PFS2/
PFS1 < 1.3 without progressive disease under matched treat-
ment during follow-up). In total, 33% of the patients (63 of 193)

presented a PFS2/PFS1 > 1.3 (two-sided 95% CI, 26%–39%). 
The null hypothesis that the true probability is lower than or 
equal to 15% is rejected with a one-sided P value of <0.001. In 
a preplanned secondary analysis, we directly compared the 
paired failure times PFS2 and PFS1 through a χ2 test (15). 
The null hypothesis of equality of the paired survival times 
was rejected in favor of PFS2 (χ2 = 8.25 with 1 df, P = 0.004). A 
Kaplan–Meier plot of the PFS2/PFS1 ratio is reported in Fig. 
3A. Individual PFS1 and PFS2 of the patients are reported in 
Fig. 3B, and an alternative display of these times in Supplemen-
tary Fig. S2. We tested in a sequential manner the null hypoth-
esis in the subgroup of 27 patients for whom target treatment 
was considered level of evidence A: 37% of the patients (10 of 
27) presented a PFS2/PFS1 > 1.3 (two-sided 95% CI, 19%–58%). 
The null hypothesis that the true probability is lower than or 
equal to 15% is again rejected (one-sided P = 0.004).
Responses by RECIST 1.1 criteria among the 194 patients 
with non-missing PFS1 included 2 complete responses (1%)

patients), FGFR inhibitor (n = 4 patients), EGFR inhibitor 
(n = 3 patients), ALK inhibitor (n = 3 patients), and MAPK or 
PI3K–AKT–mTOR inhibitors (n = 2 patients). The majority of 
patients without RECIST data had an early clinical deteriora-
tion (28 of 39). The median follow-up for progression-free 
survival on matched therapy or PFS2 was 20 months. The 
6-month estimated PFS2 was 16% (95% CI, 12%–22%), and 
median PFS2 was estimated at 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.9–2.7 
months). The 1-year estimated overall survival (OS) probabil-
ity was 49% (95% CI, 42%–58%) and the estimated median OS 
was 11.9 months (95% CI, 9.5–14.3 months).
Subgroup Analyses
In order to explore which patients could derive more ben-
efit from this approach, we retrospectively assessed the PFS2/
PFS1 ratio according to post hoc subgroups. The benefit of 
sequencing was not significantly different according to the 
RMH score (exact test for difference in proportions, P = 0.67), 
drug family (P = 0.72), year of inclusion (P = 0.95), disease 
(P = 0.66), and level of evidence for the target gene molecular 
abnormality (P = 0.15; Table 2).
DiscUssiON
There are controversies about whether the use of high-
throughput genomics could improve outcome in patients 
with hard-to-treat cancers. In the present study, we have 
shown that tumor sequencing improves outcome in 33% of 
patients with advanced cancers. Previous trials had evaluated 
the efficacy of multigene molecular abnormality screening 
approaches to personalized therapy. In the SAFIR01 trial 
(14), only 30% of the treated patients presented an objec-
tive response or stable disease. In the SHIVA randomized 
trial (13), no significant improvement in progression-free 
survival could be observed in the precision medicine arm as 
compared with the standard-of-care arm. There are several 
reasons that could explain why the MOSCATO trial is posi-
tive, whereas previous ones failed. First, 75% of the patients 
received last-generation targeted therapies in the context of 
phase I/II trials. It is well established that only therapies that 
hit the target with high bioactivity can improve outcome. As 
an illustration, vemurafenib dramatically improves outcome 
of BRAFV600-mutant melanoma, whereas sorafenib, a weak 
BRAF inhibitor, does not (16). Second, it is very likely that the 
MOSCATO trial team benefited from the experience acquired 
in previous precision medicine trials (13, 17, 18–23).
In the present nonrandomized study, the ratio PFS2/PFS1 
was chosen as a primary endpoint. Von Hoff first proposed 
this endpoint and concluded that a ratio >1.3 would indicate 
a treatment benefit. This is supported by the observation that 
PFS decreases over the lines of therapy in the natural course 
of the disease (24). In that regard, in a study that included 
934 patients with metastatic breast cancer, median PFS times 
were 9.3, 5.5, 4.9, 4.1, and 0.2 months in the first, second, third, 
fourth, and fifth lines of therapy, respectively (25). This end-
point has been successfully used to develop oxaliplatinum and 
to find optimal dosing of imatinib, but has been criticized to be 
of little value when the within-patient correlation between con-
secutive PFS times in the natural course of the disease is low 
(26). Although this study reports, for the first time, evidence 
and 20 partial responses (10%) for an overall response rate of 
11% (95% CI, 7%–17%), 100 stable disease (52%), 33 progres-
sive disease (17%), and 39 not available (20%; Fig. 4). One 
patient with breast cancer and an FBXW7 mutation has pre-
sented a complete response after treatment with a NOTCH 
inhibitor. Moreover, one patient with a HER-positive biliary 
cancer was treated with a trastuzumab and chemotherapy 
combination and has also presented a complete response. 
Among the 20 patients who presented a partial response, the 
following treatments were provided: HER inhibitors (n = 8

that sequencing a large panel of genes improves outcome of a 
subset of patients, it does not therefore provide level I evidence 
that this approach improves outcome in the general popula-
tion of patients with metastatic cancers. Indeed, the quantifica-
tion of the impact of such an approach in the overall population 
requires randomized controlled trials. SAFIR02_Breast and 
SAFIR02_lung trials (NCT02299999 and NCT02117167) are 
currently addressing such questions. The other limitation 
of the current trial is the lack of comparison with patients, 
treated by the same targeted therapies, whose tumors do not 
have matched genomic abnormalities. Nevertheless, it is unlikely 
that this would explain the efficacy observed in the current trial, 
because efficacy of unmatched targeted therapies has so far been 
observed only with CDK4 and mTOR inhibitors.
There are several ways to further improve the efficacy of 
precision medicine. We first need better tools to identify the 
relevant genomic alterations. In the present study, although 
RNA-seq and whole-exome sequencing were performed in 
427 and 166 patients, respectively, they were not useful to 
drive patients to therapy. Further trials that include immuno-
therapeutics and therapies targeting translocations will better 
assess the utility of these technologies. Also, RNA-seq could 
be useful to define pathway activation and target expression, 
but this was not assessed in the current study. Second, we 
need to better define which patients derive more benefit from 
this approach. Several studies have suggested that patients 
with high genomic instability (27) and/or subclonal altera-
tions are less likely to derive benefit from targeted therapies. 
Finally, there is a need to develop combinations, especially in 
patients who present multiple driver alterations (28).
In the present trial, we have shown that the molecular 
screening strategy led to a matched targeted treatment for 
19% of successfully screened patients, and 33% of those 
matched-treated patients or 7% of those successfully screened 
obtained a PFS ratio above the predefined threshold. Next 
steps include the validation of clinical utility in randomized 
trials, better defining which patients could derive benefit 
from this approach, and the further development of new 
methods to detect cancer drivers in individuals.
MethODs
Study Design and Procedure
The Molecular Screening for Cancer Treatment Optimization trial 
(MOSCATO; NCT01566019) is a monocentric, prospective clinical 
trial. The trial accrued patients between December 2011 and March 
2016. This study aimed to show that high-throughput genomics 
improve a progression-free survival ratio in patients with advanced 
cancers. Patients were eligible if they presented a locally advanced, 
unresectable, or metastatic cancer that had progressed during at least 
one line of prior therapy. Only patients who were considered noncur-
able by a multidisciplinary board were eligible for the trial. Patients 
who presented with a genomic alteration that rendered them eligible 
for a targeted therapy approved in the indication were not eligible for 
this trial. Children were eligible for the trial, but were not included 
in the population of patients where the primary endpoint was 
evaluated as prespecified in the protocol. This study is registered with 
 
ClinicalTrials.gov, MOSCATO 01 (NCT01566019). All patients gave 
signed informed consent for the trial and genomic analyses. This 
trial protocol was approved by an institutional review committee and 
done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Genomic Analyses
After having given signed informed consent, the patient underwent 
either a biopsy or a tumor resection. The tumor cellularity was assessed 
by a senior pathologist on a hematoxylin and eosin slide from the 
same biopsy core than the one used for nucleic acid extraction and 
molecular analysis. In case of tumor cellularity >30%, the association 
of aCGH and targeted sequencing was performed, completed by RNA-
seq analysis for cases collected after 2014 and whole-exome sequencing 
for selected cases, when the quality and the quantity of nucleic acid 
were sufficient. In cases with tumor cellularity with 10% to 30%, only 
targeted sequencing was performed. Tumor DNA, RNA, and germline 
DNA from whole-blood samples [used for whole-exome sequencing 
(WES)] were extracted using, respectively, AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit 
and DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. The molecular analysis using targeted sequencing and 
aCGH was carried out as described previously (29, 30). Briefly, targeted 
sequencing was performed using Personal Genome Machine (Ion 
Torrent PGM, ThermoFisher Scientific) with Ion AmpliSeq multiple 
genes panels, based on multiplex-PCR. For biopsies collected from 
May to November 2012, the targeted gene panel consisted of the Ion 
AmpliSeq Cancer Panel (CP1) covering 190 amplicons in 40 cancer 
genes (ThermoFisher Scientific). For biopsies collected from December 
2012 to September 2013, the targeted gene panel consisted of the Ion 
AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 covering 207 amplicons in 50 can-
cer genes (ThermoFisher Scientific). Finally, for biopsies collected after 
September 2013, the targeted gene panel (MOSC3) covered 75 critical 
oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes using Ion AmpliSeq custom 
design (details available in Supplementary Methods), combining 1,218 
amplicons with the CHP2 panel. The library preparation as well as the 
sequencing analysis were performed according to the manufacturer’s 
recommendation for Ion AmpliSeq Workflow. The bioinformatic 
analysis was performed with Torrent Suite software, variantCaller

(ThermoFisher Scientific) completed by our own filtering and anno-
tation pipeline. Each retained variant was reviewed by a molecular 
geneticist and classified as pathogenic variant, unknown pathogenicity 
variant, or probably nonpathogenic variant (details available in Sup-
plementary Methods). The median coverage depth on retained variants 
is over 700 reads, offering a sensitivity down to 5% of allelic frequency. 
The whole-genome aCGH, SurePrint G3 Human aCGH Microarray 
4×180K, Agilent Technologies) was performed as described previously 
(30). The microarray scanning was performed using default param-
eters, and quantification of Cy5 and Cy3 signals was extracted with 
Feature Extraction v10.5.1.1 (Agilent Technologies), then analyzed 
and annotated with our own bioinformatic pipeline, described in Sup-
plementary Methods. The aCGH analysis was mainly used to detect 
tumor gene amplifications and/or deletions (an amplifications >×0.7 
log2 ratio and deletions < 0.5 log2 ratio) and was discussed during 
the tumor board. The alterations with a length less than 10 Mb were 
considered of interest. When needed, CGH results were confirmed 
by FISH analysis. Between 2014 and March 2016, CGH arrays were 
substituted by Cytoscan technology to quantify copy-number altera-
tions. Whole-exome analysis and RNA-seq analysis were performed on 
a limited number of cases by IntegraGen pattern platform (Integra-
Gen), starting from the same nucleic acid prepared for targeted gene 
sequencing (TGS) or aCGH. Analysis protocols used for WES and 
RNA-seq are reported in Supplementary Methods.
All molecular analysis results from targeted sequencing, aCGH, WES, 
or RNA-seq were reviewed one by one by a molecular geneticist respon-
sible for generating a molecular report highlighting annotated molecu-
lar abnormalities to be discussed during the molecular tumor board. 
The genomic data from this trial are available in the GENIE database.
In addition, we performed IHC for phospho-MET in order to drive 
patients to MET inhibitors. The IHC analysis targeting MET and 
phospho-MET was performed by the clinical pathology laboratory as 
described previously (31) using antihuman c-MET, clone SP44 (refer-
ence M3444, Spring Bioscience) or clone CVD13 (reference 18-2257, 
Invitrogen) and anti-phospho-MET (Tyr1234/1235) clone D26 (ref-
erence 3077, Cell Signaling Technologies).
Genomic Report and Treatment Decision
The genomic analysis report (TGS, aCGH, RNA-seq, and WES) pro-
vided by the molecular geneticist was discussed during a weekly multidis-
ciplinary molecular tumor board dedicated to the MOSCATO trial, and 
a matched therapy was decided accordingly. Actionability of the target 
was defined by the molecular board. Actionability was defined by the 
availability of drugs that hit either the target or the pathway activated by 
the target. Patients who were offered a matched targeted therapy during 
the multidisciplinary molecular board and who received it constituted the 
population where primary endpoint would be evaluated. In some patients 
presenting an actionable genomic alteration, no therapy was proposed at 
the time of the molecular tumor board, but they could have been further 
treated with a matched therapy outside MOSCATO trial.
Statistical Hypotheses and Analyses
The primary endpoint was defined as the PFS2/PFS1 ratio or 
growth modulation index (15), in which the progression-free survival 
on matched therapy (PFS2) was compared with the progression-
free survival for the most recent therapy on which the patient had 
just experienced progression (PFS1). Progression-free survival on 
matched treatment (PFS2) was defined as the time from start of treat-
ment to progression, as defined by RECIST 1.1, clinical progression, 
or death from any cause. Progression-free survival on prior therapy 
(PFS1) was defined as the time from start of the last prior treatment 
to progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 or clinical progression. The 
null hypothesis was that the PFS ratio >1.3 for 15% of patients or 
fewer (17). In order to reject this null hypothesis with 90% power at 
a one-sided significance level of 0.05, and assuming the true propor-
tion of patients with a PFS ratio >1.3 was equal to 24%, a total of 165 
evaluable patients was required. The primary endpoint was tested by 
a one-sided exact test. We also tested sequentially the PFS ratio in the 
subgroup of patients for which the target treatment was considered 
level of evidence A according to recommendation (32), which was 
scored by an expert blinded from clinical outcome. It was also pre-
specified as secondary analysis in the protocol to directly compare the 
paired failure times PFS2 and PFS1 through a χ2 test with 1 degree 
of freedom in a loglinear model for correlated failure times (15). 
Secondary endpoints were the number of patients who received a 
matched treatment to describe feasibility, PFS2, OS, and best overall 
response (RECIST 1.1). OS was defined as the time from inclusion to 
death, irrespective of the cause. Patients still alive at the last visit were 
censored at the date of last follow-up. The Kaplan–Meier method 
was used to construct survival curves. The median follow-up was 
calculated by the reverted Kaplan–Meier method. Exploratory post hoc 
subgroup analyses were performed for the primary outcome using 
exact tests for differences in proportions. Statistical analyses were 
performed in SAS 9.4 and R 3.2.2.
