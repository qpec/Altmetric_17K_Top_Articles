In Brief
Pietrocola et al. show that short-term
fasting or autophagy-inducing caloric
restriction mimetics, such as
hydroxycitrate and spermidine, improves
the antitumor efficacy of chemotherapy
in vivo. The effect is specific for
autophagy-competent tumors and
depends on regulatory T cell depletion
from the tumor bed.

SUMMARY
Caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs) mimic the biochemical effects of nutrient deprivation by reducing lysine
acetylation of cellular proteins, thus triggering autophagy. Treatment with the CRM hydroxycitrate, an inhib-
itor of ATP citrate lyase, induced the depletion of regulatory T cells (which dampen anticancer immunity) from
autophagy-competent, but not autophagy-deficient, mutant KRAS-induced lung cancers in mice, thereby
improving anticancer immunosurveillance and reducing tumor mass. Short-term fasting or treatment with
several chemically unrelated autophagy-inducing CRMs, including hydroxycitrate and spermidine, improved
the inhibition of tumor growth by chemotherapy in vivo. This effect was only observed for autophagy-compe-
tent tumors, depended on the presence of T lymphocytes, and was accompanied by the depletion of regu-
latory T cells from the tumor bed.
Significance
Fasting can improve the efficacy of anticancer chemotherapy. We show here that this effect involves induction of autophagy
in malignant cells, as well as an anticancer immune response. Fasting can be replaced by the administration of caloric re-
striction mimetics (CRMs), which—without causing weight loss—improve the efficacy of chemotherapy as well. The tumor
growth-inhibitory effects of hydroxycitrate were epistatic to the inhibition of regulatory T cells. Altogether, our results reveal
a common mechanism for the cancer protective properties of CRMs and point to the possibility of stimulating anticancer
immune responses by inducing autophagy with well-tolerable CRMs in vivo.

 INTRODUCTION
Accumulating evidence suggests that the long-term success
of antineoplastic therapies is largely determined by their ca-
pacity to reinstate anticancer immunosurveillance (Galluzzi
et al., 2015a). This does not only apply to so-called immuno-
therapies but may also hold true for conventional chemo-
and radiotherapy. In particular, chemotherapies with anthracy-
clines or oxaliplatin can stimulate immunogenic cell death
(ICD), thus converting dying tumor cells into a therapeutic vac-
cine that elicits a potent immune response mediated by cyto-
toxic T lymphocytes against residual tumor cells (Kepp et al.,
2014).
Chemotherapeutic agents that stimulate ICD have the partic-
ularity to cause premortem stress at the level of the ER (which
favors the exposure of calreticulin as an ‘‘eat me’’ signal on the
surface of stressed/dying cells) (Obeid et al., 2007) and to stim-
ulate macroautophagy (which we refer to as ‘‘autophagy’’), a
phenomenon whereby portions of the cytoplasm are seques-
tered in autophagosomes, which subsequently fuse with lyso-
somes for the degradation of autophagic cargo by lysosomal
hydrolases (Jiang and Mizushima, 2014; Mizushima et al.,

 2008). In normal cells, autophagy constitutes a barrier against
malignant transformation. Accordingly, many oncosuppressor
proteins promote, and several oncoproteins suppress, auto-
phagy (Galluzzi et al., 2015b). In neoplastic cells, however, auto-
phagy may facilitate the adaptation to cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic
stress, thus favoring tumor progression (White, 2015). Thus,
depending on the context, autophagy may antagonize oncogen-
esis or facilitate malignant progression (Galluzzi et al., 2015b),
spurring interest in the development of pharmacological modu-
lators of autophagy (Levine et al., 2015; Rubinsztein et al., 2012).
Premortem autophagy is not essential for chemotherapy-eli-
cited cancer cell death to occur (Guo et al., 2013), but is indis-
pensable for ICD, because autophagy is required for the release
of ATP into the extracellular space where ATP serves as a
chemotactic factor to attract antigen-presenting cells into the vi-
cinity of dying cells (Ma et al., 2013; Michaud et al., 2011). This
effect is achieved by the capacity of extracellular ATP to act on
purinergic receptors (such as P2YR2 receptors) present on the
surface of immature dendritic cell precursors (Ma et al., 2013).
The suppression of autophagy in tumor cells or the blockade
of purinergic receptors on immune cells abolishes the capacity
of chemotherapy to stimulate the invasion of tumors by anti-
gen-presenting cells (Ma et al., 2013). When autophagy is
disabled, tumor cells overexpress CD39, an ecto-enzyme that
degrades extracellular ATP into immunosuppressive adenosine,
hence attracting regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing adenosi-
nergic receptors into the tumor bed (Rao et al., 2014). After
treatment with ICD inducers, autophagy-deficient or CD39-over-
expressing tumor cells fail to elicit a therapeutic immune
response, which facilitates resistance against conventional can-
cer treatments (Ko et al., 2014; Michaud et al., 2011).
One particularly efficient strategy for increasing the efficacy
of therapy in mouse models of cancer consists in combining
chemotherapy with a regimen of acute (48 hr) starvation (Lee
et al., 2012). Of note, nutrient starvation for 24–48 hr is also
one of the most efficient ways to elicit autophagy in most cells
of the organism (Mizushima et al., 2004). Based on these pre-
mises, we investigated the hypothesis that starvation and phar-
macological autophagy induction might stimulate anticancer
immunosurveillance. We therefore investigated the capacity of
several non-immunosuppressive autophagy inducers that mimic
the metabolic effects of starvation, so-called caloric restriction
mimetics (CRMs) (Madeo et al., 2014), to improve the therapeu-
tic outcome of immunogenic chemotherapies and enhance
immunosurveillance.
RESULTS
Starvation Improves Chemotherapy via T Cells and
Autophagy
Starvation is the most physiological way of inducing autophagy
in most organs of mice (Mizushima et al., 2004). The antineo-
plastic effects of chemotherapy are known to be improved by
fasting (Lee et al., 2012), although the underlying mechan-
isms have been elusive. Mitoxantrone (MTX) or oxaliplatin (OX)
caused a reduction in the growth of murine MCA205 fibrosar-
coma established in immunocompetent wild-type (WT) mice, a
therapeutic effect that was markedly improved when chemo-
therapy was combined with starvation for 48 hr (starting 24 hr
after initiation of fasting). Importantly, these effects were entirely
dependent on the cellular immune system because both chemo-
therapy alone (with MTX or OX) and chemotherapy plus starva-
tion were unable to control tumors growing in athymic nu/nu
mice, which lack T lymphocytes (Figures 1A and 1B; Tables S1
and S2). Moreover, the inhibitory effect of starvation on tumor
growth was lost in cancers that had been rendered autophagy
deficient upon the knockdown of the essential autophagy-
related gene Atg5 (Figures 1C and 1D). We conclude from these
results that starvation can enhance chemotherapy-induced
immunosurveillance in an autophagy-dependent fashion.
Hydroxycitrate Stimulates Autophagy In Vitro and In Vivo
The biochemical effects of starvation can be mimicked by so-
called CRMs, which are non-toxic pharmacological agents or
natural compounds that reduce cellular protein acetylation,
thereby increasing autophagic flux (Madeo et al., 2014). One
compound that falls into this definition is hydroxycitrate (HC)
(Marino et al., 2014), an over-the-counter weight loss agent
that has been evaluated in clinical trials as an anti-obesity agent
(Onakpoya et al., 2011). HC acts as a competitive inhibitor of the
ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), an enzyme that generates cytosolic
acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) (Onakpoya et al., 2011). HC (but
not citrate) and two additional, chemically unrelated ACLY inhib-
itors (SB-204990, BMS-303141) stimulated autophagic flux in
cultured cancer cells, as indicated by the autophagy-associated
conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II and the distribution of initially diffuse
GFP-LC3 fusion protein to cytoplasmic puncta (Figures S1A and
S1B), even in the presence of bafilomycin A1 (which blocks the
lysosomal removal of LC3 II- or GFP-LC3-containing autopha-
gosomes) (Klionsky et al., 2012). HC-induced autophagy was
suppressed by microinjection of AcCoA (Figure 2A) but not by
supplementation of mevalonate, which only suppresses statin-
induced autophagy (Figure S1C). In line with these findings, HC
induced autophagy irrespective of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA
reductase (HMGCR) or acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) expres-
sion, ruling out the possibility that HC-induced autophagy was
due to the inhibition of lipid or sterol biosynthesis (Figure S1D).
HC reduced cytoplasmic protein acetylation, as determined by
immunofluorescence staining with an antibody reacting with
N-
3
-acetyl lysine residues (Figure 2B). Two intraperitoneal injec-
tions of HC on consecutive days were similarly efficient as a star-
vation period of 48 hr (during which mice had ad libitum access
to water, but not to food) at inducing the autophagy-related con-
version of LC3 I to LC3 II in mouse tissues in vivo (Figure 2C), with
efficiency similar to that of well-established CRMs such as the
sirtuin-1 activator resveratrol and the E1A binding protein p300
(EP300) acetyltransferase inhibitors spermidine and C646 (Mar-
ino et al., 2014; Morselli et al., 2011). However, compared with

 48 hr starvation, HC induced a virtually negligible weight loss
(Figure 2D). Starvation and a diverse array of CRMs including
HC caused largely convergent perturbations of the metabolome
in vivo, in multiple distinct organs (Figures 2E, 2F, and S2; Table
S3), as they reduced the bioavailability of circulating insulin
growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels (with a corresponding increase in
inhibitory IGF-1 binding protein 1, IGFBP1) (Figure 2G). Hence,
HC and other CRMs induce similar biochemical changes in
mice including autophagy in vivo, as does starvation, yet fail to
cause a major weight loss.
Hydroxycitrate Improves Chemotherapy in a T Cell-
Dependent Fashion
Two injections of HC on consecutive days into mice fed ad libi-
tum induced autophagy as efficiently as did starvation, both
in the liver (Figure 2C) and tumors implanted in the flank
(Figure S3A). Daily administration of HC (starting 1 day before
chemotherapy) also improved the therapeutic outcome in
MCA205 fibrosarcomas (Figures 3A and 3B), CT26 colorectal
cancers (Figure S3B), and TC-1 non-small cell lung cancers (Fig-
ure S3C) established in immunocompetent mice that were
treated with MTX (Figures 3A, S3B, and S3C) or OX (Figure 3B),
yet failed to improve the efficacy of cis-diamminedichloroplati-
num(II) (CDDP, also known as cisplatin), a chemotherapeutic
agent that does not elicit ICD (Figure S3D). The combination of
HC and MTX was more efficient than single agents in reducing
the growth of primary sex-hormone-driven breast cancer (left
panels in Figures 3C–3E). This tumor growth-reducing and sur-
vival-extending effect was lost when the animals were rendered
immunodeficient by injecting antibodies that deplete CD8+ (but
not CD4+) T lymphocytes (right panels in Figures 3C–3E). Simi-
larly, depletion of CD8+ T cells was sufficient to abolish
MCA205 tumor growth reduction by MTX plus HC (Figures S4A
and S4B). The MTX-HC combination was particularly efficient
in increasing the frequency of proliferating (Ki67+) CD8+ICOS+
cells within the tumor bed (Figure S4C). Moreover, in the TC1
model (which expresses the HPV-E7 antigen), HC was able to
increase the frequency of tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells
in the draining lymph node induced by therapeutic vaccination
(Figure S4D). Hence, the capacity of HC to improve the outcome
of chemotherapy depended on the elicitation of an adaptive
cellular immune response in several distinct tumor models,
namely fibrosarcomas, mammary carcinomas, and non-small
cell lung cancers.
Autophagy Induction Improves Chemotherapy in an
Immune-Dependent Fashion
The specific ACLY inhibitor SB-204990 was as efficient as HC
in inducing autophagy in vivo (Figure S3A) and in improving
the antineoplastic efficacy of MTX (Figure 4A), supporting the
contention that HC mediates antineoplastic effects via an on-
target mechanism. Importantly, HC could be replaced by other,
chemically unrelated CRMs that act through a variety of distinct
molecular mechanisms yet all cause protein deacetylation,
including spermidine (a natural compound that inhibits several
acetyltransferases including EP300) (Eisenberg et al., 2009; Pie-
trocola et al., 2015) (Figure 4B) and C646 (a synthetic EP300 in-
hibitor) (Figure 4C), both of which also induced autophagy within
the tumors (Figure S3A). Moreover, treatment with the sirtuin-1
activator resveratrol enhanced the therapeutic effects of anthra-
cyclines (Figures S3A and 4D), as did intraperitoneal injection of
Tt-B (Figures 4E, S3A, and S5A–S5C), a cell-permeable peptide
that has been designed to activate the pro-autophagic Beclin 1
protein complex (Shoji-Kawata et al., 2013). Importantly, all com-
bination regimens (MTX + SB, MTX + spermidine, MTX + C646,
MTX + resveratrol, MTX + Tt-B) showed a more prominent anti-
cancer activity compared with single-agent administration yet
failed when the cellular immune system was compromised due
to the nu/nu mutation (Figures 4A–4E). These results suggest
that pharmacological autophagy induction may enhance the
efficacy of anticancer therapies by boosting a T cell-mediated
immune response.
Requirement of Autophagy for Hydroxycitrate-Improved
Chemotherapy
The combination of HC and MTX induced a higher level of auto-
phagy-dependent release of ATP from cultured tumor cells
in vitro than either agent alone (Figures 5A and S6A). Similarly,
the combination of MTX plus HC was particularly efficient
in inducing extracellular ATP accumulation (which can be
measured in vivo by tethering a luciferase construct on the sur-
face of tumor cells) (Pellegatti et al., 2008) (Figure 5B). This effect
was only found in autophagy-competent tumors, not in tumors in
which Atg5 had been depleted by transfection with a construct
encoding a specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Figures 5A
and 5B). Only autophagy-competent tumors (which were trans-
fected with a control shRNA) exhibited a significant therapeutic
response to HC plus MTX, whereas cancers depleted of Atg5
were resistant to the adjuvant therapeutic effect of HC (Fig-
ure 5C). Similarly, cancers engineered to express the ecto-
ATPase CD39 (which converts extracellular ATP into ADP and
AMP) failed to respond to the combination of chemotherapy +
MTX (Figure 5C), underscoring the importance of extracellular
ATP for the response. Injection of an antibody specific for
CD73 (an ecto-enzyme that converts AMP into immunosuppres-
sive adenosine) (Stagg et al., 2011; Loi et al., 2013a) improved
the efficacy of MTX as much as did HC, yet failed to mediate
the additive effect with HC (Figure S6B). This epistatic analysis
suggests that HC indeed acts through the modulation of extra-
cellular ATP metabolism. HC-induced autophagy could be in-
hibited by injection of recombinant IGF-1 protein in vitro (Figures
5D and 5E) and in vivo (Figures 5F and 5G), a maneuver that abol-
ished tumor growth reduction by HC (Figure 5H). Thus, similar
to starvation (Figure 1D), HC-mediated enhancement of the
acetyltransferase inhibitor spermidine (Spd) (B), the EP300 inhibitor C646 (C), Resveratrol (Resv) (D), and the autophagy-inducing peptide Tt-B or its mutant
control Tt-S (E), alone or together with mitoxantrone (MTX). Results (averaged ±SEM tumor growth curves) are plotted and statistical calculations performed as
previously described.

 chemotherapeutic effect relies on the induction of autophagy in
tumor cells.
Hydroxycitrate-Improved Chemotherapy Is Mediated by
Treg Depletion
The combination of MTX and HC (but neither of these two agents
alone) markedly reduced the frequency of tumor-infiltrating
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs (Figures 6A and 6B), and this Treg-
depleting effect was abolished when animals were treated with
an autophagy-inhibitory dose of recombinant IGF-1 protein
(Figure 6B). Direct inhibition of autophagy in tumor cells by
knockdown of Atg5 or transfection-enforced expression of the
ecto-ATPase CD39 also prevented the depletion of Tregs by
MTX and HC (Figures 6C and 6D), suggesting that autophagy
in, and consequent ATP release from, cancer cells are required
for the reduction in Treg infiltration. Depletion of Tregs using an
antibody recognizing FR4 (Yamaguchi et al., 2007; McNally
et al., 2011), or by diphtheria toxin (DT) administration into
DEREG mice expressing the DT receptor under the control of
the Foxp3 promoter (Lahl et al., 2007; Teng et al., 2010),
controlled or caused the regression of MCA205 fibrosarcomas
(Figures 6E and 6F) and established TC1 lung cancers (Fig-
ure S6C). Importantly, epistatic analyses revealed that HC
administration failed to further improve the anticancer effects
of Treg depletion, supporting the contention that HC increases
the efficacy of chemotherapy by reducing Treg infiltration into
tumors.
Hydroxycitrate Stimulates Immunosurveillance Against
KRas-Induced Lung Cancers
Caloric restriction is known to limit the growth of KRasG12D-
induced lung cancers provoked by delivering a Cre recombi-
nase-encoding adenovirus (Ad-Cre) into the lungs of mice
bearing a Lox-Stop-Lox-KRasG12D transgene (Kalaany and
Sabatini, 2009). Administration of HC induced autophagy in
KRas-induced lung adenocarcinomas, but only if they expressed
at least one normal Atg5 allele (Atg5fl/+). When both alleles of
Atg5 were floxed (Atg5fl/fl), the resulting Atg5-deficient tumor
cells were unable to generate LC3 dots in response to HC (Fig-
ures S7A and S7B). HC also reduced the number and size of
Ad-Cre-induced tumor lesions in KRas;Atg5fl/+ but not KRas;
Atg5fl/fl mice (Figures 7A and 7B). Paralleling its anticancer ef-
fects, HC reduced the density of tumor-infiltrating Foxp3+ Treg
cells (Figure 7C), with a consequent altered percentage of
Foxp3+ (Figure S7F) among CD3+ lymphocytes (Figures S7D
and S7E) in KRas;Atg5fl/+ tumors only (Figure 7D). Depletion of
Tregs by antibodies recognizing two Treg surface antigens,
namely CD25 or FR4, also reduced KRas-induced oncogenesis,
and this effect could not be further improved by simultaneous
treatment with HC (Figure 7E). HC failed to reduce the growth
of lung cancers evolving in Rag2�/� mice, which lack T and
B lymphocytes (Figure S7C), or mice that expressed transgenic
CD39 in the tumors (Figure 7F). These results indicate that HC-
mediated stimulation of autophagy within cancer cells causes
Treg depletion, which in turn improves immunosurveillance
against KRas-induced neoplasia.
DISCUSSION
Immunogenic chemotherapy with anthracyclines or oxaliplatin is
known to stimulate an anticancer immune response that may be
largely responsible for the long-term effects of successful treat-
ment regimens, both in animal models (Zitvogel et al., 2013) and
in patients with mammary carcinoma (Sistigu et al., 2014) and
colorectal cancer (Bindea et al., 2013; Tesniere et al., 2010).
One of the requisites of immunogenic chemotherapy is the
induction of autophagy (Michaud et al., 2011), a process that al-
lows for optimal lysosomal exocytosis of ATP from dying tumor
cells (Martins et al., 2014) and avoids the upregulation of the
immunosuppressive ecto-ATPase CD39 (Rao et al., 2014). Auto-
phagy occurring in malignant cells is indeed essential for anti-
cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy to work, meaning that
defective autophagy due to the reduced expression of essential
Atg genes largely compromises therapeutic efficacy (Ko et al.,
2014; Michaud et al., 2011, 2014). As reported here, artificial
overstimulation of autophagy by starvation, CRMs, or therapeu-
tic agents that have been specifically designed to trigger this
process (Levine and June, 2013) can improve the immune-
Figure 5. Autophagy and ATP-Dependent Improvement of Anticancer Chemotherapy by Hydroxycitrate
(A) Autophagy-dependent release of ATP in vitro. ATP concentration (mean ± SEM, n = 7, pooled from two experiments) was measured in the supernatants of
autophagy-competent or Atg5KD CT26 cells treated with 20 mM hydroxycitrate (HC) and/or 2 mM mitoxantrone (MTX).
(B) Autophagy-dependent release of ATP in vivo. Autophagy-competent or Atg5KD CT26 colorectal cancers expressing a luciferase variant detecting extracellular
ATP were treated with MTX and/or HC, and ATP release was monitored until 48 hr post chemotherapy. Representative images (left panel) and corresponding box

mice bearing autophagy-competent or autophagy-deficient (Atg5KD) MCA205 tumors or MCA205 tumors or overexpressing a CD39 transgene (CD39+) received
MTX and/or HC.
(D) Inhibition of HC-induced autophagy by IGF-1. U2OS cells stably expressing the autophagic marker GFP-LC3 were treated with HC alone or in combination
with 10 mM insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1).
(E–G) (E) Autophagy was measured by assessing the abundance of GFP-LC3 puncta per cell (in the presence of BafA1) and quantified in (F, mean ± SEM, n = 3).
WT immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice bearing MCA205-derived tumors were treated with HC alone or in combination with recombinant IGF-1. Autophagy was
assessed by immunoblotting in the tumor (F) and quantified in (G, mean ± SEM, n = 3).
(H) Reversal of the therapeutic effect of HC by IGF-1. WT immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice were inoculated subcutaneously with murine fibrosarcoma MCA205
cells and tumors were treated with HC and/or MTX, alone or combined with intraperitoneal injections of recombinant IGF-1 protein (averaged ± SEM tumor growth
curves).
Data were analyzed by ANOVA for multiple comparisons (A and B), unpaired Student’s t test (E and G), linear mixed-effect modeling (C and H), and linear
modeling (H). Levels of significance: ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05 (comparisons with Co/PBS unless indicated by a segment); ###p < 0.001, #p < 0.05

 dependent antineoplastic effects of chemotherapy. Indeed,
autophagy occurring within cancer cells was obligatory for the
therapeutic efficacy of CRMs such as HC, likely because auto-
phagy-deficient cells escape from natural and therapy-induced
immunosurveillance as they attract Tregs into the tumor bed
(Ma et al., 2013; Michaud et al., 2011; Rao et al., 2014; Uhl
et al., 2009). In addition, pharmacological autophagy induction
could improve immunosurveillance in an oncogene-induced
model of lung cancer, and this effect again involved the depletion
of tumor-infiltrating Tregs. As a limitation of our study, however,
we must point out that enhanced ATP release coupled to Treg
depletion was defined as the mechanism of the anticancer action
of HC in only two transplantable tumor models and one onco-
gene-induced cancer. Therefore, further studies are required to
define the mechanistic details through which CRMs exert their
beneficial action on anticancer immunosurveillance.
Circumstantial and epidemiological evidence indicates that
overfeeding and obesity constitute negative prognostic factors
with regard to the incidence, progression, and therapeutic
response of several human malignancies (Casagrande et al.,
2014; Gilbert and Slingerland, 2013; Makarem et al., 2013). In
contrast, caloric restriction and fasting have been related to pos-
itive therapeutic outcome, both in animal models (Kalaany and
Sabatini, 2009; Lee et al., 2012) and in humans subjected to
voluntary fasting (Lee and Longo, 2011) or bariatric surgery
(Tee et al., 2013). Here, we report that a 48 hr starvation period
(which in mice causes a dramatic, yet recoverable weight loss
of �20%) can improve the efficacy of chemotherapy via an
immunological mechanism that involves a reduction in the intra-
tumoral infiltration by Tregs. Starvation cycles reportedly trigger
the rejuvenation of immune-relevant hematopoietic stem cells,
suggesting additional immunostimulatory effects that might
contribute to the improved immunosurveillance (Cheng et al.,
2014). Our present data indicate that starvation might be re-
placed by a special diet or by natural compounds that mimic
starvation with regard to the induction of metabolic alterations
and autophagic responses in vivo.
Among the agents that we describe here as CRMs with positive
effects on anticancer immunosurveillance, several have a rather
favorable toxicological profile. Chronic treatment with spermidine
or rapamycin even extends the health and life spans of mice (Har-
rison et al., 2009; Kibe et al., 2014; Strong et al., 2008), suggesting
that at least some CRMs might have a favorable risk/benefit
profile. Furthermore, HC has been evaluated in clinical trials as a
weight-reduction agent in obese patients, without major side ef-
fects (Chuah et al., 2012; Onakpoya et al., 2011). Future work is
required to understand which particular CRM (or CRM combina-
tion) will be optimally suitable for cancer-preventive or therapeutic
improvement of immunosurveillance.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mouse Strains and Housing
Mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions in a temperature-
controlled environment with 12-hr light/12-hr dark cycles and received food
and water ad libitum (unless noted otherwise). Animal experiments were in
compliance with the EU Directive 63/2010, and protocols 2012_069 and
2015_026_1114 were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Gustave
Roussy Campus Cancer (CEEA IRCIV/IGR no. 26, registered at the French
Ministry of Research). Six-to 7-week-old female WT C57Bl/6, BALB/c, and
nude athymic (nu/nu) mice were obtained from Harlan France. All mouse ex-
periments were randomized and blinded, and sample sizes were calculated
to detect a statistically significant effect.
Atg5fl/fl mice were kindly provided by Dr. Noboru Mizushima. LSL-K-
rasG12D;Atg5fl/fl mice were obtained as described by Rao et al. (2014). The
CD39 transgenic mice were kindly provided by Dr. Peter Cowan. CD39 trans-
genic mice were crossed with LSL-K-rasG12D;Atg5fl/fl mice to obtain LSL-K-
rasG12D;Atg5fl/fl;CD39+ mice. In all experiments, only littermate mice were
used as controls. All mice were maintained according to the ethical animal li-
cense protocol complying with the Austrian and European legislation. All
experiments were approved by Bundesministerium for Wissenschaft und
Forschung, Austria (BMWF-66.015/0013-II/3b/2012).
Depletion of REGulatory T cells (DEREG) transgenic mice (Lahl et al., 2007)
were kindly provided by Drs. Bernard Ryffel and Lionel Apetoh.
Mouse Experiments and Tissue Processing
For tumor growth experiments, 3 3 105 WT MCA205, TC-1, or CT26 cells
were inoculated subcutaneously (near the thigh) into WT or nu/nu C57BL/6
(H-2b) mice, and tumor surface (longest dimension 3 perpendicular dimen-
sion) was routinely monitored using a common caliper. When the tumor sur-
face reached 25–35 mm2, mice were treated intraperitoneally either with
5.17 mg/kg mitoxantrone (MTX) in 100 ml of PBS, 10 mg/kg oxaliplatin (OX)
in 100 ml of PBS, 10 mg/kg CDDP, or an equivalent volume of PBS, alone
or in combination with daily administration of 900 mg/kg hydroxycitrate
(HC) in drinking water; or 30 mg/kg SB204990 (SB), 25 mg/kg resveratrol
(Resv), 10 mg/kg C646, 50 mg/kg spermidine (Spd), 5 mg/kg rapamycin
(Rapa). Tat-Beclin-1 (Tt-B) peptide (17) or Tat-Beclin-1 (Tt-S) peptide (17S)
were administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 15 mg/kg in 100 ml of PBS
three times per week. Tt-B (17) is an optimized derivative of the previously

termates were inoculated subcutaneously with MCA205 cells. When tumors became palpable, mice were injected intraperitoneally daily with 1 mg/kg diphtheria
toxin (DT) for 15 days. DEREG mice were administered with HC in drinking water. At day 2 post DT and HC administration, DEREG mice received chemotherapy
with MTX or PBS. Results are shown as means ± SEM (at least eight mice per group).
Data were analyzed by ANOVA for multiple comparisons (B–D), linear mixed-effect modeling (E, left panel, and F), and linear modeling (E, right panel). Levels

For starvation experiments, mice underwent 48 hr
fasting followed by intraperitoneal injection of
chemotherapeutics.
For autophagy induction studies, after CRMs
administration on two consecutive days, mice
were euthanized and tissues were snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen after extraction, and homogenized
in two cycles of 20 s at 5,500 rpm using a Precellys
24 tissue homogenator (Bertin Technologies) in
20 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mM
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA, and Com-
plete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied
Science). Tissue extracts were then centrifuged
at 12000 3 g at 4�C and supernatants collected.
Protein concentration in the supernatants was
evaluated by the bicinchoninic acid technique (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce
Biotechnology).
Hormone-Induced Breast Cancers
Six-week-old female BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice underwent subcutaneous sur-
gical implantation of 50 mg of slow-release medroxyprogesterone acetate
pellets (90-day release; Innovative Research of America). 200 ml of 5 mg/ml
dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA; Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in corn oil was
administered by oral gavage six times over a period of 8 weeks. When tumors
became palpable, mice received either 5.17 mg/kg MTX (intraperitoneally) in
100 ml PBS or an equivalent volume of PBS, alone or in combination with
158

 100 mg/kg HC (intraperitoneally), 500 mg of monoclonal anti-CD4 (clone
GK1.5) (intraperitoneally), and/or anti-CD8a (clone 2.43) antibodies (on the
day before the onset of the treatment).
Induction of Lung Cancer
Inhalation of 6- to 8-week-old mice with Cre recombinase-encoding adeno-
virus (Ad-Cre) was performed as previously reported (Rao et al., 2014). In brief,
experimental animals were anesthetized with 10% ketasol/xylasol and placed
on a heated pad. An Ad-Cre-CaCl2 precipitate was produced by mixing 60 ml
of minimal essential medium, 2.5 ml of Ad-Cre (1010 plaque-forming
units ml�1; University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core) and 0.6 ml of
CaCl2 (1 M) for each mouse and incubated for 20 min at room temperature.
One week after Ad-Cre inhalation, mice were administered 900 mg/kg HC
per body weight in drinking water for 5 weeks and tumors lesion were evalu-
ated by immunohistochemistry.
Statistical Analysis of In Vivo Experiments
Longitudinal analysis of tumor growth data was carried out by linear mixed-
effect modeling on log pre-processed tumor sizes. Wald tests were used to
compute p values by testing jointly that both tumor growth slopes and inter-
cepts (on a log scale) were the same between treatment groups of interest
(Demidenko, 2006; Sugar et al., 2012). At a single time point, the effect of treat-
ment was estimated by linear modeling. p Values were adjusted according to
the Holm method from all pairwise comparisons of interest. For graphing, tu-
mor growth data are represented on the untransformed original scale in three
forms: (1) explicit curves from all measurements of each mouse; (2) group-
averaged tumor size alongside its SEM computed at each time point; (3) over-
lay of single data points and the classical box-and-whiskers plot at a selected
sampling point. For mice euthanized before the selected sampling point, the
last measure was retained.

Procedures.
