STUDY QUESTION: Is telomere length related to parity among a nationally representative sample of US reproductive age women?
SUMMARY ANSWER: History of live birth was associated with shorter telomere length.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Shorter telomeres have been linked with a range of chronic health conditions and mortality and parity
has been associated with health indicators. However, there is a lack of research on how parity relates to telomere length.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This nationally representative, cross-sectional study included 1954 women from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999–2002, the only survey period which includes measurement of telomere length.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women aged 20–44 were included. Parity, defined as number of previous live
births, was ascertained by questionnaire. Leukocyte telomere length was measured by polymerase chain reaction and reported as a ratio in rela-
tion to standard reference DNA (T/S ratio). The relationship between leukocyte T/S ratio and parity was examined using survey weighted linear
regression. Models were adjusted for race/ethnicity, age, BMI, income-to-poverty ratio, education, early age at menarche and smoking status.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Among reproductive age women in the US, the adjusted mean leukocyte T/S ratio
was 4.2% (95% CI: 0.9, 7.3) shorter in parous compared with nulliparous women. Parity was associated with 116 fewer base pairs (95% CI:
26, 204) on average, using estimated coefficients from the adjusted linear regression models and mean covariate values.
LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was cross-sectional and therefore was unable to establish temporality. The data-
set lacked information on social factors, stress and fertility status, which may help explain these findings. Only two previous studies have
examined this question and our findings should be interpreted with caution.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings in a nationally representative sample of US reproductive age women sug-
gest that history of live birth may be associated with accelerated cellular aging. The magnitude of the observed association was greater than
that of the impact of smoking or obesity on telomere length, suggesting that parity may have an independent influence on cellular aging and
warrant further study.
STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): The study was funded in part by the Undergraduate Research Scholars Program at
George Mason University. The authors have no conflicts of interest.

Introduction
Telomere length is a marker of cellular aging and is linked with multiple
chronic diseases (Kipling and Cooke, 1992; Zhao et al., 2014). For
example, meta-analyses show shorter telomeres are significantly
related to higher cancer risk, and other studies have found shorter tel-
omeres are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardio-
vascular disease, inflammation and atherosclerosis (Ma et al., 2011;

 Haycock et al., 2014; Willeit et al., 2014; Aviv et al., 2015; Zhang et al.,
2016). Shorter telomeres have also been associated with socio-
environmental characteristics and stress, suggesting factors other than
genetic determinants are responsible for telomere length (Epel et al.,
2004; Révész et al., 2016). Women who work less, sleep more, have
healthy behaviors, and experience less mental illness have been
observed to have longer telomeres (Parks et al., 2011; Shalev et al.,
2013).
Parity has long been associated with chronic disease. Bernardo
Ramazzini first observed that nuns were at increased risk of breast can-
cer in 1713. Others have since confirmed this (Sun et al., 2016) and
further noted increased risk of ovarian and uterine cancers among nul-
liparous women (Fraumeni et al., 1969). On the other hand, parity has
been associated with increased risk of heart disease (Peters et al.,
2016), kidney cancer (Guan et al., 2013) and type 2 diabetes (Mueller
et al., 2013). Nulliparity has been linked to decreased risk of mortality
overall (Merritt et al., 2015; Gaudet et al., 2017) but to higher mortal-
ity from other chronic diseases (Haycock et al., 2014; Zeng et al.,
2016).
Despite these observed associations among telomere length, parity
and chronic disease risk, there is a paucity of research on the relation-
ship between parity and telomere length. One study found that a high-
er number of surviving children was associated with longer telomeres
in 75 Mayan women over a 13-year follow-up, suggesting having chil-
dren might be protective against cellular aging (Barha et al., 2016),
while another study of post-menopausal women in the US found parity
was associated with shorter telomere length, although this relationship
itself may have been subject to confounding by other factors (Gray
et al., 2014).
To address this gap in the literature and better understand the con-
nection between parity and health, the objective of our study was to
examine the association between parity and leukocyte telomere length
in a nationally representative sample of reproductive age US women.
Materials and Methods
Data were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), a cross-sectional survey conducted by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics
designed to assess the health and nutritional status of non-institutionalized civi-
lians living in the United States (NHANES—National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey Homepage, n.d.). NHANES employs a multistage prob-
ability sampling survey design and includes both interviews and standardized
physical examinations. The only NHANES survey periods that included
measurement of telomere length were during 1999–2002. Of the 21,004,
1999–2002 NHANES respondents, 19 759 participated in the examination
component and 7827 had non-missing telomere length measurements. Of
those, 4056 were female and 1954 were 20–44 years old. After removing
respondents with missing information, the analytical sample size for the
complete case analysis comparing parous to nulliparous women was
1554 women (Fig. 1).
Ethical approval
The NCHS Ethics Review Board at the CDC approved the NHANES data
collection and no specific additional review was required for this analysis,
which used data from public-use files.
Socio-demographic characteristics
Each participant provided information on age, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
White, non-Hispanic Black, Mexican-American, other), household income-
to-poverty ratio (IPR), educational attainment and cigarette smoking history.
Household IPR was based on reported family income and household com-
position relative to US Department of Health and Human Services’ poverty
guidelines set by year and state of residence (‘2015 Poverty Guidelines,’
2015). Current smoking included any reported cigarette smoking at the time
of interview; former smoking included no current smoking, but participant
reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes over her lifetime; and never smok-
ing indicated that participant never smoked cigarettes. BMI was determined
using measurement of height and weight at the examination by trained study
staff and was expressed in kg/m2. Pregnancy was ascertained by a positive
urine pregnancy test at the examination or by self-report.
Parity and reproductive history
Parity was assessed using the Reproductive Health Questionnaire, adminis-
tered by computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) during the
NHANES examination component. First, total number of pregnancies was
assessed by asking: ‘How many times have you been pregnant?’ Then
women were asked: ‘How many of your pregnancies resulted in a live
birth?’ For women with a history of twins or higher order multiples, each
pregnancy resulting in at least one live birth was counted only once. Age at
menarche was assessed by self-report; early age at menarche was defined
as <12 years. Menstrual phase was assessed by asking the respondent
about the date their last menstrual period started; follicular phase was
assigned if last period was within 14 days and luteal phase if last period was
within 15–40 days. Irregular period due to menopause were assessed by
asking the respondent if their period were regular in the past 12 months,
and if not, it that was due to going through or having gone through
menopause.
Leukocyte telomere length
Persons aged 20 and over at the time of the interview were asked to pro-
vide whole blood for DNA analysis. At the Division of Health Statistics
Laboratory, CDC, DNA was extracted from specimens and stored at
−80°C. Purified DNA samples were then coded and shipped to an outside
laboratory (Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn at the University of California, San
Francisco, USA) for analysis as part of a surplus specimen project
(NHANES 1999–2000, n.d.; Needham et al., 2015). Leukocyte telomere
length in relation to a standard reference DNA (T/S ratio) was measured
for each sample three times (in duplicate) using the quantitative PCR meth-
od, resulting in six measurements that were used to calculate the mean
and standard deviation of the T/S ratio for each participant (NHANES
1999–2000, n.d.). The T/S ratio (also referred to as ‘relative telomere
length’) is proportional to mean telomere length and will be referred to as
‘telomere length’ throughout this manuscript for ease of understanding.
The mean T/S ratio can be converted to number of base pairs using the
following formula: 3274 + 2413 × (T/S ratio) (NHANES 1999–2000, n.d.).
Statistical analysis
Telomere length was log-transformed to better approximate a normal dis-
tribution. Parity was dichotomized into nulliparous (no previous live birth)
and parous (at least one previous live birth) for the primary analysis. Rao-
Scott modified Chi-square tests were used to evaluate differences in
categorical socio-demographic characteristics between parous and nul-
liparous women. Where expected cell frequencies were 0, these tests
were not run. Unadjusted linear regression models were used to calcu-
late mean telomere length by these same characteristics for parous and

 nulliparous women, separately. Unadjusted linear regression was also
used to assess differences in telomere length across characteristics; in
general, the group with the longest telomeres among nulliparous women
served as the reference level.
Missing data on parity, IPR, BMI and early menarche were imputed using
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation (n = 10) so that
analyses could be performed using all women aged 20–44 with telomere
data (Fig. 1). MCMC assumes that all variables in the imputation model
have a joint multivariate normal distribution. Variables were imputed on a
continuous scale and then categorized. The following number of values
were imputed for each of the following variables: PIR, 143; BMI, 32; parity,
262; age at menarche, 177.
The relationship between parity and telomere length was estimated
using linear regression. Linear regression coefficients were then exponen-
tiated to calculate the percentage difference in telomere length on the ori-
ginal scale, for ease of interpretation. The selection of covariates for
adjusted models was based upon information from the available literature
and the relationships observed in this dataset. Regression models were
adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, current cigarette
smoking, BMI, early age at menarche and IPR. Possible effect measure
modification by race/ethnicity on the relationship between parity and telo-
mere length was assessed through stratification by race/ethnicity because
telomere length has been found to vary by race in other studies (Rewak
et al., 2014; Aviv et al., 2015; Drury et al., 2015). In addition to modeling
parity as a dichotomous variable, we also modeled it as a categorical vari-
able using number of live births, with zero live births as the reference
group.
Several sensitivity analyses were conducted. These included analyses
restricted to: individuals with complete data (a complete case analysis);
women aged 20–50 including multiply imputed data; women aged 20–44,
including multiply imputed data, and excluding women with irregular men-
ses due to menopause; and women aged 20–40, including multiply
imputed data.
All analyses used NHANES examination weights and accounted for the
complex survey design. We used the following statistical software: SAS,
version 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA) and SAS-callable SUDAAN 11.0 (RTI
International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA).
Results
The majority of women (n = 1505; 71.8%) were parous (nulliparous,
n = 444; 28.2%) (Table I). Compared to nulliparous women, parous
women were more likely to be older, non-Hispanic black or Mexican
American, have a lower IPR, lower education attainment, to be a for-
mer or current smoker, and to have irregular periods due to meno-
pause (Table I). No differences in BMI, pregnancy status, menstrual
phase or early menarche by parity were observed. Among parous
women, 30% had one, 37% had two, 23% had three, 7% had four and
4% had five or more live births. The distribution of women that were
currently taking the pill or Depo Provera, reported being surgically
sterile, and drank alcohol differed by parity (Supplementary Table SI).
Geometric mean telomere length (expressed as T/S ratio) differed
significantly by parity and was 1.10 for parous women (95% CI: 1.06,
1.13) and 1.17 for nulliparous women (95% CI: 1.13, 1.22) (Table II).
These are equivalent to 5919 (95% CI: 5838, 6003) and 6104 (95% CI:
5991, 6222) base pairs, respectively.

Parity and telomere length in women
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/33/4/736/4858327 by guest on 02 June 2019
 Among nulliparous women, those aged 20–24 generally had longer
telomeres than older women, and those with IPR < 1.0 had longer tel-
omeres than those with IPR > 2.0 (Table II). Parous non-Hispanic
black women had significantly longer telomere length compared with
Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white women. Parous obese
women had shorter telomere length compared to normal weight par-
ous women (Table II).
In unadjusted analyses, parous women had 6.5% (95% CI: 2.6, 10.3)
shorter T/S ratio on average compared with nulliparous women
(Table III); using estimated coefficients from the unadjusted linear
regression models and mean covariate values, parity was associated
with 185 fewer base pairs (95% CI: 75, 291) on average. After adjust-
ment for age, race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, BMI, early age
at menopause and IPR, findings were slightly attenuated and parous
women had 4.2% (95% CI:0.9, 7.3) shorter T/S ratio on average com-
pared with nulliparous women. Using estimated coefficients from the
adjusted linear regression models and mean covariate values, parity
was associated with 116 fewer base pairs (95% CI: 26, 204) on aver-
age. Using the same adjusted model and mean covariate values, each
year increase in age was associated with between 9 and 10 fewer base
pairs on average, depending on maternal age.
After stratifying by race, the significant relationship between parity
and telomere length persisted among non-Hispanic white women,
where parous women had 4.9% (95% CI: 1.2, 8.6) shorter T/S ratio
on average compared with nulliparous women in the adjusted ana-
lysis; no other significant associations were observed (Table III).
Number of live births was associated with shorter T/S ratio for
women with 1, 2 and ≥5 live births. Women with ≥5 live births had
the largest reduction in mean T/S ratio, 12.7% (95% CI: 7.1, 18.0%)
(Table III).
Parity was consistently associated with shorter T/S ratio in sensitiv-
ity analyses restricted to individuals with complete information, those
who did not report having irregular menses due to menopause,
and women aged 20–40 (Supplementary Table SII). Parity was not
associated with telomere length in the sensitivity analysis among
women aged 20–50 (Supplementary Table SII).
In a post-hoc analysis, mean telomere length was examined by num-
ber of live births among parous women only, using those with one live
birth as the reference group. No significant differences in mean telo-
mere length by number of live births among parous women were
found (all comparison P-values were > 0.09 and point estimates did
not show a linear pattern) suggesting there was no dose response rela-
tionship between parity and telomere length in our study sample (data
not shown in tabular form).
Discussion
In this nationally representative, cross-sectional study of reproductive
age US women, having had at least one live birth was associated with
shorter telomere length compared with no live births. This association
persisted even after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, education
level, income-to-poverty ratio, early age at menarche, BMI and smok-
ing status. As shortened telomeres are associated with cellular aging
and increased risk of several chronic diseases as well as overall mortal-
ity (Cawthon et al., 2003), further investigation is warranted.
Parity was associated with an adjusted difference of 116 fewer base
pairs, which was ~11 times the number of base pairs associated with a
one year increase in age in our study sample (9–10 fewer base pairs).
This means the difference in telomere length between parous and nul-
liparous women is equivalent to ~11 years of accelerated cellular
aging. However, other studies have found that per year increase in age
is associated with a 24–27 fewer base pairs, which would mean that
parity was associated with ~4.5 years of accelerated cellular aging
(Shammas, 2011). In comparison, current or former smoking among
was associated with telomere shortening equivalent to 4.6 years of cel-
lular aging; while obesity was associated with 8.8 years of cellular aging
(Valdes et al., 2005). Perceived stress among mothers of healthy and

Parity and telomere length in women
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/33/4/736/4858327 by guest on 02 June 2019
 chronically ill children was associated with telomere shortening equiva-
lent to a decade of aging (Epel et al., 2004).
In contrast with our findings, a study that evaluated parity and telo-
mere length among 75 reproductive age Mayan women found that
having more surviving children was associated with longer telomeres
(Barha et al., 2016). Factors associated with non-surviving children
include stress and grief, which we were unable to evaluate here. The
authors interpreted the protective effect of having more surviving chil-
dren on telomere length as a result of increased lifetime estradiol
exposure and improved social factors, such as community support,
among mothers compared with non-mothers (Barha et al., 2016).
These social factors among the Mayan community are likely different
than in the US (Harley and Eskenazi, 2006). Differences may also be
attributable to the higher parity among reproductive age Mayan
women (average 5.6 surviving children), compared to the US (2.1 chil-
dren) (Martinez et al., 2012) and differences in the assays used to
measure telomere length. Among 486 post-menopausal white
women, increased parity was associated with shorter leukocyte telo-
mere length (Gray et al., 2014), which is generally consistent with this
study’s findings. However, parity was a covariate in this analysis and
not the primary exposure variable, so fully adjusted models were not
performed. Further, the relationship between parity and telomere
length in post-menopausal women may not reflect the relationship
that would have been observed during their reproductive age years.
Shorter telomere length in parous women may be influenced by a
number of factors. Possible explanations include stress, as increased
stress is associated with both shorter telomere length and child rearing
(Nyström and Ohrling, 2004; Mathur et al., 2016). NHANES lacks
measures of stress, so this study was unable to examine that question.
Notably, early life course stress and adversity were not associated with
telomere length in a prospective birth cohort (Jodczyk et al., 2014). An
evolving body of literature suggests that maternal psychosocial stress
during pregnancy is a factor in prenatal programming of neonate telo-
mere length, and so plausibly may be related to maternal telomere
length. Maternal prenatal stress was associated with shorter neonate
telomere length (Entringer et al., 2013; Marchetto et al., 2016). Maternal
pre-pregnancy BMI was also associated with shorter neonate telomere
length (Martens et al., 2016).
This study has several strengths. This is the first study to examine
the association between telomere length and parity in a nationally rep-
resentative US population and as such results are generalizable. This
study adjusted for potential confounders, including age. The data col-
lection standards of NHANES provide important measurement
reliability.
This study was not without limitations. It is plausible that women
with shorter telomeres have fewer children than women with longer
telomeres; this study was unable to disentangle this temporal relation-
ship because of the cross-sectional design of NHANES. Future studies
should measure telomere length over time. Additionally, the analysis
was unable to take into account psychological stress, which is not mea-
sured in NHANES and is known to influence telomere length. The
finding that telomere length did not differ significantly by race/ethnicity
and only differed by certain number of live birth categories could have
been limited by small sample sizes in some subgroups.
Associations between parity and cellular aging may have implications
for human health, as telomere length has been associated with
increased risk of mortality among elderly adults (Cawthon et al., 2003)
and with cancer incidence and mortality (Willeit et al., 2010). Other
reproductive factors, such as number of pregnancies, have been nega-
tively related to survival, while later age at last birth have been asso-
ciated with longer survival in a comparison study of three large cohorts
(Gagnon et al., 2009). We were unable to measure a direct link with

 survival in the present article, but telomere length has been found to
be associated with mortality and thus our findings are generally in
agreement with Gagnon with respect to parity. The telomere theory
of reproductive aging posits that telomere length is related to fertility
status and as such, shorter telomere length may be caused by subferti-
lity (Keefe et al., 2006). Unfortunately, NHANES did not ascertain
information on infertility in the 2001–2002 cycle, so we were unable
to ascertain whether fertility status influenced our findings.
These findings suggest that parity may accelerate cellular aging, inde-
pendent of age, race/ethnicity, smoking status, early age at menarche,
education, BMI and IPR. As data were cross-sectional, these results
should be interpreted with caution, and suggest that cohort studies
are necessary to better delineate the implications of parity on telo-
mere length.
