What is already known on this topic?
 
► Limited research has investigated length of stay 
in very preterm babies admitted for neonatal 
care.
 
► Parents are often told that their baby will be 
discharged home ‘around their due date’ but it 
is unclear whether reality reflects this estimate.
What this study adds?
 
► This study considers the risk of mortality and 
the length of stay of very preterm babies 
simultaneously, to present the full picture of 
neonatal care.
 
► For babies born at 24 and 25 weeks, length of 
stay should be considered alongside their risk of 
mortality.
 
► For babies born at 30 and 31 weeks, their 
median length of stay is a month less than 
the time remaining to their estimate date of 
delivery, indicating this anecdotal estimate of 
‘home by their due date’ may be unhelpful in 
this group.
AbsTrACT
Objective To predict length of stay in neonatal care for 
all admissions of very preterm singleton babies.
setting All neonatal units in England.
Patients Singleton babies born at 24–31 weeks 
gestational age from 2011 to 2014. Data were extracted 
from the National Neonatal Research Database.
Methods Competing risks methods were used to 
investigate the competing outcomes of death in neonatal 
care or discharge from the neonatal unit. The occurrence 
of one event prevents the other from occurring. This 
approach can be used to estimate the percentage of 
babies alive, or who have been discharged, over time.
results A total of 20 571 very preterm babies were 
included. In the competing risks model, gestational age 
was adjusted for as a time-varying covariate, allowing 
the difference between weeks of gestational age to 
vary over time. The predicted percentage of death or 
discharge from the neonatal unit were estimated and 
presented graphically by week of gestational age. From 
these percentages, estimates of length of stay are 
provided as the number of days following birth and 
corrected gestational age at discharge.
Conclusions These results can be used in the 
counselling of parents about length of stay and the risk 
of mortality.
bACkgrOund
The ability to predict length of stay in neonatal 
care has become increasingly important as improve-
ments in survival1 2 have led to more very preterm 
babies requiring long lengths of hospitalisation. 
Estimates of length of stay are necessary to facilitate 
conversations between parents and clinicians about 
a baby’s anticipated length of stay.
Previous research has often focused on inves-
tigating length of stay for babies who survive to 
discharge from neonatal care.3–5 Inclusion of babies 
who die while in neonatal care can make length 
of stay estimation complex.6 Other medical areas 
have recommended consideration of mortality and 
length of stay simultaneously as it can ‘reflect the 
reality or interrelation between the outcomes’.7 
The exclusion of babies who die in neonatal care 
has been identified as a limitation of length-of-stay 
research in neonatal care.8 9
Currently estimates of length of stay for babies 
anticipated to survive are given as either ‘your baby 
will go home around the time they were due to be 
born’ or ‘when they are able to feed and keep them-
selves warm’. However, these statements are not 
evidence based and it is unclear if they are actually 
true. Irrespective of this, any results should be 
considered alongside the risk of mortality. Parents 
often report feeling anxious about whether they are 
ready to take their babies home, and information to 
support conversations about when this may happen 
may help alleviate some anxiety.10
Statistical methods recently introduced to 
neonatal research11 allow the simultaneous estima-
tion of time to discharge or death. This paper aims 
to provide clinically useful estimates of length of 
stay and the risk of mortality to assist clinicians in 
consultation with parents.

delivery and discharged from 2011 to 2014. Babies born prior to 
24 weeks gestational age were not included as their care is likely 
to relate to local policies, and there is a lack of consistency in 
approach to their management across the country.13
Babies were excluded if they were discharged home before 
34 weeks postmenstrual age as it is not until this point that 
most babies acquire the ability to fully suck feed and main-
tain temperature stability.14 Babies that stayed in the neonatal 
unit longer than 6 
months were also excluded. Exclusions were 
made for babies with unusual patterns of care including being 
discharged home having only received intensive care15 or being 
discharged having never received special care. These exclusions 
may be data errors or may represent a very different group of 
babies, including those receiving palliative care. Finally, babies 
were excluded if their final discharge was to another specialist 
service, for example, cardiac or surgical unit.
Daily data were available from the NNRD for babies 
throughout their time in neonatal care although babies could be 
transferred from neonatal care for other specialist care which 
does not provide data to the NNRD (eg, some surgical units) and 
then subsequently be transferred back into neonatal care. Days 
of care were imputed for these unobserved days.
Deaths in neonatal care and discharge home from neonatal 
care were considered as two competing events, that is, the occur-
rence of one event means the other cannot occur.
statistical analysis
A flexible parametric competing risks model16–18 was fitted in 
order to estimate the percentage of babies who were discharged 
or died in the neonatal unit over time.19 20 From this, estimates 
can be made of the percentage of deaths or discharges up to 
specific points in time. Completed weeks of gestational age at 
birth was included in the model as this is known to be important 
for both the prediction of mortality21 and length of stay.6 To 
allow for differences in the risk of mortality or discharge between 
the weeks of gestational age over time, time-dependent effects 
were included.22 Further methodological details for competing 
risks approaches, including their application in the estimation of 
neonatal length of stay, can be found elsewhere.11 20
The percentage of babies, by gestational age, dying or surviving 
to discharge from neonatal care was estimated over time and 
displayed graphically. Estimates of median length of stay can be 
derived from the point at which half of the events have occurred 
for babies who survived to discharge and for those who died in 
neonatal care.
resulTs
There were 21 
631 singleton babies born at 24–31 weeks gesta-
tional age discharged from neonatal care from 2011 to 2014. 
Babies were excluded if they were discharged home before 34 
weeks postmenstrual age (n=205, 0.9%) or if they stayed in 
the neonatal unit longer than 6 
months (n=199, 0.9%). Exclu-
sions were made for unusual patterns of care defined as being 
discharged from neonatal care having only received intensive 
care (n=57, 0.3%) or discharged having never received special 
care (n=132, 0.6%). Babies were excluded if their final discharge 
was to another clinical location: another (specialist) hospital 
not reporting to the NNRD (n=293), surgical units (n=141), 
cardiac care (n=24) or an unknown location (n=9). A total of 
20 
571 (95%) babies remained in the analysis.
Summary characteristics of the included babies are provided 
in table 1. Over one million days of care were provided to this 
population of very preterm babies. Of the 20 
571 babies in the 
analysis, 8.6% died during their time in neonatal care. Around 
24% of babies were born at 31 weeks gestational age (table 1).
gestational age analysis
The estimated percentages, from the flexible parametric 
competing risks model, are presented in graphical form as 
stacked plots (figure 1). The black area represents the percentage 
of babies who died in neonatal care, the dark grey area represents 
those discharged and the light grey area indicates the percentage 
who remain in the neonatal unit, over time. For example, for 
babies born at 24 weeks, the percentage of babies who had died 
by 30 days after birth (black area) was approximately 30% and 
no babies had been discharged (dark grey area). The rest of the 
babies remained in neonatal care (figure 1).
The median length of stay for babies was estimated by outcome 
of the baby and week of gestational age (table 2). The median 
length of stay is also presented as corrected gestational age at 
discharge. Babies born at 24 weeks who survived to discharge 
had a median length of stay of 123 days. This is slightly longer 
than the time remaining until their estimated date of delivery 
(discharge at 41.6 weeks corrected age). As week of gestational 
age increased the time to discharge decreased, and babies were 
discharged in advance of their due date. Babies born at 26–28 
weeks had a median length of stay slightly shorter than the time 
remaining to their due date. However, babies born at 30 and 31 
weeks were discharged home sooner, with a median length of 
stay around 30 days less than their due date.
Babies dying while in neonatal care had a median length of 
stay of around ≤10 days, indicating that half of deaths occur in 
the first 10 days after birth.

dIsCussIOn
This research has provided estimates of median length of stay 
while also considering mortality for singleton babies born very 
preterm. These estimates can be used in clinical practice to aid 
the counselling of parents about length of stay. For example, for 
a baby born at 26 weeks gestational age around half of deaths 
have occurred in the first 10 days (table 2). At around 10 days of 
life, and using their clinical judgement, a clinician could explain 
to a parent that the risk of mortality has reduced, but that their 
baby could be in hospital for a long time. The estimate of median 
length of stay for a baby of these characteristics is 92 days (82 
days by day 10) but we would suggest that clinicians use a more 
general description, for example, ‘around two and a half months’ 
or in terms of their due date: ‘around a week before their due 
date’, to reflect that there is uncertainty in this estimate. Future 
qualitative research should focus on the issues of how to commu-
nicate the risk of mortality and length of stay to parents.
Anecdotally, parents are often told their baby will go home 
‘around their due date’ and this research demonstrates that this 
may not be the case. Babies born at 24 and 25 weeks of gesta-
tional age who survive to discharge have the longest median 
length of stay, staying around 123 and 107 days, respectively. For 
these babies, saying they may be discharged ‘around their due 
date’ is close to their median length of stay. However, for babies 
born at 30 and 31 weeks gestational age, their median length of 
stay is around a month shorter than the time remaining to their 
estimated due date. Therefore, this phrase should be used with 
caution as it seems that this may not accurately reflect length of 
stay for many very preterm babies.
Parents have reported that information about likely discharge 
dates improved their understanding of their baby’s progress 
and prepared them for discharge.23 However, this informa-
tion should be given at an appropriate time, in an appropriate 
way and supplemented with clinical judgement. Around half of 
the deaths occur in the first 10 days of life, and clinicians should 
consider this when counselling around length of stay. The esti-
mates provided in this work are intended to complement and 
facilitate clinician knowledge, rather than replace it.
strengths and limitations
This analysis was adjusted for gestational age alone. While other 
factors may be important for the estimation of length of stay,6 it 
is helpful if statistical models are simple, informative and easy 
to use within a clinical setting. In attempts to predict neonatal 
mortality, risk scores have been created which have subsequently 
needed to be simplified because they were too ‘cumbersome to 
use’ in practice.24 25
This study is one of the largest studies to investigate the 
prediction of length of stay in neonatal care. A strength of this 
work is that these results have been produced on a national 
basis, without biases arising from differences between networks 
of hospitals or individual neonatal units due to local discharge 
practices within units or networks. All neonatal units in England 
contributed their data to this study allowing consideration of 
the total care received by each baby, even across multiple units 
and transfers, without loss to follow-up. However, as the results 
are population based we did not consider that units may have 
individual approaches to length of stay and discharge plan-
ning. We did not investigate individual units as small numbers 
of babies, particularly at the earliest weeks of gestational age, 
at specific units would make estimation of their length of stay 
imprecise. For the same reasons we were unable to investigate 
specific subgroups of babies, such as those who require surgery, 
but future work should consider this area.
Babies discharged to receive care in other services were 
excluded from this work. These babies will potentially have a 
length of stay longer than that seen in the data reported to the 
NNRD. However, these babies represented a small number of 
discharges from neonatal care (n=467).
There has been limited work investigating neonatal length of 
stay in the UK, but another small study investigating length of 
stay in four neonatal units in the Southwest of England found 
similar results to this work (the ‘Train-to-Home’ package), with 
babies born from 27 to 33 weeks being discharged 3–4 
weeks in 
advance of their estimated date of delivery.26 Estimates of length 
of stay from The Neonatal Survey from 2005 to 2007, a study 
of neonatal intensive care in the East Midlands and Yorkshire, 
also found similar results to those presented in this work.5 This 
allows the potential for clinicians to offer more accurate infor-
mation to parents than just telling them that their baby will go 
home ‘around their due date’.

Future work
Estimates of total length of stay can be useful for parental coun-
selling, and they are also helpful in clinician discussions about a 
baby. However, they do not provide the entire picture of neonatal 
care. While in neonatal care a baby will need varying levels of 
care15 and this can be incorporated into length-of-stay estimates. 
Estimates incorporating information about levels of care may be 
more informative for service planning and the commissioning of 
care. We are investigating this in further detail and initial results 
have been published elsewhere.27 Future work should also inves-
tigate differences in length of stay between different regions and 
different subgroups of babies, for example, babies discharged 
home on oxygen.
Singleton babies born very preterm have been investigated in 
this work as it is unlikely to be possible to predict length of stay 
for singleton and multiple babies simultaneously.9 The singleton, 
very preterm population is somewhat homogenous in terms of 
their prematurity which is likely to be the most important deter-
mining factor of their length of stay.6 Babies born after 32 weeks 
gestational age may need an analysis stratified by their clinical 
condition, although this may still be problematic as even babies 
with similar clinical conditions have been seen to have varying 
lengths of stay within a single unit.28
There is no evidence to suggest on the optimum length of 
stay in a neonatal unit before discharge, nor evidence that a 
short length of stay should be a desirable aim.9 Following an 
early discharge home, babies may require admission to paedi-
atric care within a short period of time, whereas keeping them 
in the neonatal unit a little longer may have minimised this risk. 
Future research should link neonatal care with other outcomes, 
including subsequent admission to paediatric care, to investi-
gate the benefits and harms of early versus late discharge from 
neonatal care.
COnClusIOn
The estimation of length of stay in neonatal care should also 
consider the risk of mortality, especially for the very preterm. 
In this work, appropriate statistical methods have been used to 
provide estimates of length of stay which can be used by clini-
cians to aid the timing, and content, of discussions with parents.
