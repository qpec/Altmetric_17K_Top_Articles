Abstract
Background: Diabetes self-management education has been shown to be effective in controlled trials. However, few programs
that meet American Association of Diabetes Educators standards have been translated into widespread practice.
Objective: This study examined the translation of the evidence-based Better Choices, Better Health-Diabetes program in both
Internet and face-to-face versions.
Methods: We administered the Internet program nationally in the United States (n=1010). We conducted face-to-face workshops
in Atlanta, Georgia; Indianapolis, Indiana; and St. Louis, Missouri (n=232). Self-report questionnaires collected health indicator,
health behavior, and health care utilization measures. Questionnaires were administered on the Web or by mail. We determined
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from blood samples collected via mailed kits. Paired t tests determined whether changes between baseline
and 6 months differed significantly from no change. Subgroup analyses determined whether participants with specific conditions
benefited (high HbA1c, depression, hypoglycemia, nonadherence to medication taking, and no aerobic exercise). We calculated
the percentage of participants with improvements of at least 0.4 effect size in at least one of the 5 above measures.
Results: 
Of the 1242 participants, 884 provided 6-month follow-up questionnaires. There were statistically significant
improvements in 6 of 7 health indicators (including HbA1c) and in 7 of 7 behaviors. For each of the 5 conditions, there were
significant improvements among those with the condition (effect sizes 0.59–1.1). A total of 662 (75.0%) of study participants
improved at least 0.4 effect size in at least one criterion, and 327 (37.1%) improved in 2 or more.
Conclusions: The Diabetes Self-Management Program, offered in two modes, was successfully disseminated to a heterogeneous
national population of members of either insured or administered health plans. Participants had small but significant benefits in
multiple measures. The program appears effective in improving diabetes management.

 Introduction
Background
Type 2 diabetes is a growing problem. Not only is the prevalence
increasing, but also there are increased costs and decreased
quality of life. Patients, health care providers, families,
employers, and insurers all share this burden. The US
government, in Healthy People 2020, set national objectives for
improvements in diabetes care and outcomes [1].
Diabetes self-management education has been shown to be
effective in improving health behaviors and in some cases
lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). However, <7% of privately
insured persons receive formal education in the year after
diagnosis [2] and <60% report having attended a diabetes class
[1]. The American Association of Diabetes Educators has set
standards for diabetes self-management education [3,4]. Few
programs, however, that meet these standards have been
translated into widespread practice and shown to be effective.
One reason for this is that most programs are not easily
translatable: they do not have (1) standardized curricula that are
manualized in such a way that minute-to-minute details are
given of exact content to be presented, as well as the processes
by which this content is offered, (2) standardized training
programs, and (3) manuals for fidelity standards. All 3
components are necessary for effective replication.
The Administration for Community Living (US Department of
Health and Human Services) and the Evidence-Based Leadership
Council have varied in their definitions of evidence-based
programs [5,6]. However, key to both definitions are that the
program must have been shown to be effective and that it have
one or more peer reviewed publications. In addition, there must
be infrastructure for translation, and the program must have
been replicated in sites other than where it originated. The
National Diabetes Education Program does not define
evidence-based diabetes education but does suggest using
programs that meet the National Standards for Diabetes
Self-Management Education [3]. None of these definitions
include the notion that the intervention must be shown to be
effective outside of its home site.
A National Translation Study
In this paper, we present the national translation of an
evidence-based diabetes education program, The Stanford
Diabetes Self-Management Program, also known as Better
Choices, Better Health-Diabetes (BCBH-D) [7-9], given via the
Internet or in small face-to-face community groups.
Recent systematic reviews have found that both community and
Internet interventions have been effective in reducing HbA1c
and improving quality of life for people with type 2 diabetes
[10-14]. These programs have nearly always been offered in
the context of a controlled study. In that setting there are often
extensive inclusion and exclusion criteria, which may bias the
results when applied to the general diabetes population. This is
especially true for HbA1c, where the inclusion criterion is seldom
<7 (considered to be controlled diabetes) and often as high as
9. For example, in Zhang et al’s meta-analysis of 20 studies
using peer support for diabetes, 12 studies had a mean baseline
HbA1c of ≥8 [14]. There is limited information about the
effectiveness of specific programs when translated to widespread
use and offered to large populations by non-health care providers
[15,16].
For this translation study, the US National Council on Aging
led a collaboration of 5 organizations. It also provided the
platform for offering the Internet workshops. Anthem, Inc
(Indianapolis, IN, USA) -affiliated health plans recruited
participants from their members. The Young Men’s Christian
Association of the United States of America in Atlanta, Georgia,
and OASIS Institute in St. Louis, Missouri, and Indianapolis,
Indiana, offered community programs. The Stanford Patient
Education Research Center (Stanford University School of
Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA) collected data and provided data
analysis. HealthCore (Wilmington, DE, USA), a subsidiary of
Anthem, Inc, contributed to the design and data analysis. The
team members met for months prior to the beginning of the
study to decide on study design, outcome variables, and logistics.
They continued to meet at least monthly for the duration of the
intervention. The study was approved by the Stanford University
Institutional Review Board and New England Independent
Review Board.
We hypothesized that over 6 months, people with diabetes
participating in the program would demonstrate (1) a reduction
in HbA1c, (2) a reduction in symptoms (hypoglycemic symptoms
and depression), (3) increases in healthful behaviors (exercise,
communication with physicians, and medication adherence),
(4) increases in receiving recommended tests (eye, foot,
cholesterol, and kidney examinations). We also hypothesized
(5) that program effectiveness would be independent of mode
of delivery, (6) that participants with baseline HbA1c ≥9.0,
8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) depression ≥10.0,
having 2 or more hypoglycemia symptoms, medication
nonadherence, or no aerobic exercise would have clinically
significant improvements in the variables of interest, and (7)
that most of the participants would have a moderate effect size
(0.4) improvement in either reducing HbA1c, reducing
depression, increasing medication adherence, reducing
hypoglycemic symptoms, or increasing exercise.
In addition, we wanted to explore the potential of BCBH-D to
meet some of the Healthy People 2020 objectives: decrease the
proportion of people with diabetes with HbA1c >9, and increase
the proportion of people with diabetes who (1) have an annual
foot examination, (2) have an annual urinary microalbumin
measurement, and (3) receive formal diabetes education.
Methods
Intervention
We chose BCBH-D because it was developed for people with
type 2 diabetes in real-world settings. We built both programs
(face-to-face and Internet) on extensive patient input, as well
as assistance from certified diabetes educators. Both programs
have been shown to be effective in previous randomized trials
[7,9], have the same content, and are taught in an interactive
manner designed to enhance self-efficacy [17]. Both have a

 duration of 6 weeks, 2 peer facilitators, and standardized
facilitator training. Participants receive the same book, Living
a Healthy Life with Chronic Conditions [18], which contains
program content and chapters on other chronic conditions. The
face-to-face program has detailed facilitator, administrative,
and fidelity manuals [19], while the Internet program has an
administrative manual for facilitators.
The BCBH-D Internet program is a password-protected,
interactive, Web-based program. The user interface consists of
3 major sections. (1) The Learning Center offers 20–30 pages
of didactic and interactive content each week. In addition to
reading content within the Learning Center, participants make
weekly action plans, give feedback on the plan from the previous
week, and answer a question such as “What problems do you
have with your diabetes?” The action plan, feedback, and
questions populate the Discussion Center. (2) The Discussion
Center contains 4 interactive bulletin boards: problem solving,
action planning, difficult emotions, and celebrations. Participants
can post to any of these boards and respond to posts at any time.
(3) My Tools is a series of tools, such as a medication log, food
diary, exercise diary, and links to other websites that can be
used as participants wish.
The Internet facilitators are trained over the Web by first
participating in a workshop, followed by Web-based training
and then cofacilitating the workshop with an experienced
facilitator. Certified diabetes educators are available to
facilitators to answer questions as necessary. All interactions
between facilitators and participants take place on the Web.
Facilitators assist participants with the program. They model
action planning and problem solving, and offer encouragement
by posting to the discussion boards. Facilitators monitor the
daily posts of all participants and report inappropriate posts to
program administrators. They also have access to a certified
diabetes educator. Unlike in the community program, in the
Internet program facilitators do not deliver content, as this is
scripted on the Web.
For the Internet program, 25–30 participants log on at least 3
times a week and participate in weekly activities, including
reading content, posting an action plan, and interacting on the
discussion boards. Any problem a participant wishes to discuss
can be posted in the Discussion Center and responded to by
other participants. The Internet program mirrors the original
community program, except that it does not require real-time
attendance. Participants can log in any time, have no face-to-face
interaction, and may return to past weeks’ material [7,9].
The community workshops meet for 2.5 hours a week; 10–15
people attend and may bring a friend or family member. This
is longer than the 10 hours usually covered by insurance
participant’s health plan benefits. The length was determined
by the amount of material to be covered, as well as past work
that indicated that shorter programs were less effective [20]. In
a recent review, Pillay and colleagues also noted that programs
with ≤10 hours of contact had limited benefit in improving
glycemic control [21].
Both the community and Internet BCBH-D content meets the
diabetes self-management education recommendations for
diabetes self-management education and support [3]. More than
20 organizations have received American Association of
Diabetes Educators certification for the face-to-face program.
Although the content and processes are very similar, there is no
means for certifying or recognizing Web-based programs. Both
interventions have been widely translated into practice. More
than 50,000 people in 39 states in the United States have taken
the community program and more than 2000 have participated
via the Internet. The community program is also used in 14
countries outside the United States. This broad translation is
possible because of program and training standardization,
because of the original evidence base of effectiveness, and
because program delivery meets the needs of community and
health care organizations.
Recruitment
Because we wanted to replicate real-world settings, we stipulated
few inclusion (have type 2 diabetes and be covered by an
Anthem plan) or exclusion criteria (currently pregnant or had
chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer in the past year).
There were no inclusion criteria based on level of symptom
severity, nor was having had cancer by itself an exclusion
criterion.
We recruited Internet participants by email or announcements
from their employers or emails directly from an Anthem plan.
A small percentage of participants were referred by family,
friends, or physicians. Participants in both commercial and
Medicare Advantage health insurance programs were eligible.
Potential study participants went to the recruitment website,
completed a screening form, and, if they met study requirements,
completed an informed consent and baseline questionnaire.
We recruited face-to-face participants through mailings, flyers
in workplaces, case managers, and automated telephone calls.
They were asked to call a local number for details about the
workshop, screened for study eligibility, and registered.
Programs were available in Atlanta, Indianapolis, and St. Louis.
A small percentage of the community participants were not
covered by an Anthem plan. All other screening criteria were
the same for Internet and community participants.
Participants enrolled between October 2013 and October 2014.
Data Collection
We collected data at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. This
paper reports only on the 6-month results. Internet participants
completed consent forms and all questionnaires on the Web.
Face-to-face participants completed informed consent forms
and baseline questionnaires within a week of their first session.
Follow-up questionnaires were sent by mail.
We asked potential participants to supply a capillary sample of
blood for HbA1c testing. If willing, they were sent a CoreMedica
home test kit (CoreMedica Laboratories, Lees Summit, MO,
USA). These were returned to the investigators, bar coded to
avoid disclosing private information, and then sent to
CoreMedica, 
a 
Clinical 
Laboratory 
Improvement
Amendments-certified laboratory [22]. Participants and their
physicians were sent the results. Participants were not required
to consent to blood testing, nor were they disqualified if they
did not return their tests. Because CoreMedica recalibrated its

 measurements in June 2014, increasing all values by roughly
0.4, all measures prior to June were adjusted upward by 0.4.
Measures
We chose measures to be of interest to patients, providers, and
the health care system. We gathered all data except HbA1c from
validated self-report questionnaires. Demographic variables
included age, sex, race, ethnicity (non-Hispanic white),
education, and marital status. In addition, we recorded other
diseases (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, other
lung disease, hypertension, heart disease, renal disease, arthritis,
cancer, depression or other mental condition). Outcome
measures, described below and in full detail elsewhere, fell into
two broad categories: health indicators and health behaviors.
All health indicators have been validated in previous studies.
A higher score indicates greater symptoms or worse health.
Self-rated health consists of a single item from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (range 1–5) [23]. The
PHQ-8 depression scale is calculated as the sum of 8 items,
with a range of 0–24 [24]. The illness intrusiveness scale
consists of 13 items that measure how much a participant’s
illness interferes with different aspects of life [25]. Each item
ranges from 1 (not very much) to 7 (very much interference).
The hypoglycemic symptoms scale was developed by Piette
[26]. It is the mean of 7 yes–no questions regarding the presence
of different symptoms, with a range of 0–7 symptoms. Fatigue
and sleep are each single-item visual numeric scales ranging
from 0 (no fatigue or no sleep problems) to 10 (severe fatigue
or very big problem sleeping) [27].
The health behaviors measures have also been validated
elsewhere. A 3-item scale measured communication with
physicians. It used a 6-point scale (from never to always) to
measure how often the participant prepared a list of questions
for the physician related to the illness [28]. We assessed minutes
of aerobic exercise per week by asking about 5 types of aerobic
exercise [28]. The Morisky Medication Adherence Scale consists
of 4 yes–no items asking about taking medication [29]. The
scale has a range of 0–4, with a higher value indicating less
adherence. We also asked participants if they had eye, foot,
cholesterol, and kidney examinations in the past 6 months and
past 12 months.
Data Analysis
Translation studies, because of study population heterogeneity,
present unique methodological challenges. In many diabetes
studies, participants are chosen based on having difficulty with
the outcome of interest. Thus, participants enter into studies
because of high HbA1c, depression, hypoglycemia, or being
nonadherent. In this study, no such screening occurred. This
results in greater heterogeneity, as not all participants have the
same problems and some may have none of the problems.
Consequently, we conducted two types of analyses. The first,
or classic, analyses determined the changes, significance, and
effect sizes for the population as a whole. The second, or subset,
analyses examined only that portion of the study population
that demonstrated problems in the variable of interest, that is,
high HbA1c or low adherence to taking medications. A third
analysis sought to reconcile these two by examining the
percentage of the total population who achieved a moderate
benefit (0.4 effect size) in at least one of the variables of interest.
Univariate statistics described demographic characteristics.
Independent sample t tests compared demographic and baseline
outcome variables between those who did not complete 6-month
follow-up questionnaires and those who completed them. Paired
t tests examined changes between baseline and 6 months and
whether these differed significantly from a null hypothesis of
zero change (hypotheses 1–4).
For participants who had had no examinations (eye, foot,
cholesterol, or kidney) in the year prior to entry, we calculated
the percentage who had examinations in the 6 months following
baseline (hypothesis 4).
To determine effectiveness by mode of delivery (hypothesis 5),
we used independent sample t tests to compare change scores
between Internet and face-to-face participants. We also used
analyses of variance to compare differences among the 3
community locations.
We conducted subgroup analyses for participants with specific
indicators (hypothesis 6). These were HbA1c >9; clinical
depression (PHQ-8 of ≥10 [24]); at least two symptoms of
hypoglycemia; low medication adherence; and no exercise at
baseline. For each measure, we report the mean change of the
group and the percentage who no longer had the negative
indication.
To determine whether a large portion of the participants
benefited on at least one important outcome, we calculated the
percentage who had an improvement of at least 0.4 effect size
(change score divided by baseline standard deviation) in at least
one of the 5 criterial measures (hypothesis 7). We also calculated
the mean number of improvements (out of 5) and examined
how this varied by the number of the 5 specific indicators each
participant had.
Results
Participants and Baseline Demographics
There were 4639 potential participants who indicated interest
in the study. Of these, 1242 participants met the study criteria,
consented, completed baseline questionnaires, and attended at
least one session of the workshop, resulting in 1010 Internet
participants (Figure 1) and 232 face-to-face participants (Figure
2).
Table 1 gives the demographic characteristics. Participants in
the Internet group were statistically more likely to be male
(P=.02, from t test), more likely to be married (P<.001), less
likely to be a racial/ethnic minority (P=.001), to be more
educated (P=.01), and to be younger (P<.001). Overall, the
participants tended to be well-educated women.

Noncompleters of 6-Month Questionnaires
Outside of HbA1c, which was optional, no variable had more
than 1.7% missing data among those who completed
questionnaires. We did not attempt to impute missing data.
Of the 1242 participants, 358 (28.82%) did not complete the
6-month questionnaire, including 28 who withdrew from the
study or died before 6 months (Figure 1,Figure 2). The study
retention rate was similar and nonsignificant by type of program:
713/1010 (70.59%) of the Internet and 171/232 (73.7%) of the
community participants.
Comparing 6-month noncompleters and completers on
demographic variables, those who did not complete the 6-month
follow-up tended to be younger (mean 55.4 vs 57.6 years old,
P<.001). The groups did not differ by sex, marital status,
education, or ethnicity/race. Among 17 baseline outcome
variables, 1 had statistically significance differences.
Noncompleters reported less medication adherence (1.22 vs
1.06 on a 5-point scale, P=.02).
6-Month Changes (Hypotheses 1–4)
Table 2 shows baseline and 6-month change scores for all study
participants. It should be noted that at baseline the mean HbA1c
was just under 8 with a standard deviation of 1.4. This suggests
that, as predicted, the group was very heterogeneous and that
many participants had a low HbA1c at baseline.

d“Don’t know” set to “no examination.”
Most health status and behavior variables showed statistically
significant 6-month improvements. This remained when
adjusting for multiple comparisons (using a P value of .003 as
the criterion for significance).
For intent-to-treat analyses (not shown), we substituted a value
of 0 (no change) for 6-month change scores for those who did
not complete 6-month questionnaires. The intent-to-treat
analyses of changes resulted in no differences from the P values
shown in Table 2.
For all subsequent analyses, we included only those who
completed 6-month questionnaires. We present these analyses
as a means of determining who benefited in this heterogeneous
population.
Increase in Receiving Recommended Tests (Hypothesis
4)
Of those who had not been examined (tested) in any of the 4
areas (eye, foot, cholesterol, kidney) in the year before baseline
(n=85), only 12 (14%) had no tests in the next 6 months (not
shown in tables). Thus, 73 (86%) of those who had not been
examined at all had at least one examination in the 6 months
after the program. A total of 46 (54%) of these had 3 or more
of the 4 tests.
Differences in Changes by Type of Program or
Location (Hypothesis 5)
There was little evidence of differences between participants in
the two types of programs (Internet vs community). Only 1
change score differed by program: community participants had
greater improvement in sleep (P<.001). Similarly, there was
little evidence of differences by location of community
programs. The only difference by community was for
improvements in foot examinations, where community
participants in St. Louis had marginally less improvement than
in the other 2 communities (P=.04).
Analyses of Specific End Points (Hypothesis 6)
For each of the 5 outcomes described in hypothesis 6 above,
we look at 6-month changes for those who exhibited symptoms
and those who did not (not shown in the tables). Then we looked
at those who benefited for 1 or more of these 5 problems.
HbA1c ≥9
Of those who supplied a blood sample for HbA1c determination
at both baseline and 6 months, 20.0% (98/489) had a baseline
HbA1c of ≥9. The proportion with HbA1c >9 was reduced to
15.3% at 6 months (n=74, P<.001 from chi-square). The mean
reduction in HbA1c for the group starting at ≥9 was –0.93
(P<.001, effect size 0.73). For those with <9 at baseline, there
was an increase of 0.05 in HbA1c (P=.26).

 Depression
At baseline, 22.0% (193/877) had symptoms indicating clinical
depression (PHQ-8 score of ≥10) [24]. This was reduced to
16.3% at 6 months (n=144, P<.001). Baseline mean PHQ for
the “depressed” group was 13.8 (SD 3.34). At 6 months, the
mean reduction was 3.87 (P<.001, effect size 1.1); and 51.3%
of those originally with a score ≥10 (n=99) had scores of <10.
For those who had a score of <10 at baseline, there was a mean
reduction of –0.21 in PHQ scores (P=.08)
Hypoglycemia
At baseline 332/865 (38.4%) had 2 or more symptoms of
hypoglycemia (mean 2.88, SD 1.04). At 6 months, the number
with 2 or more symptoms was reduced to 280 (32.4%). The
6-month change in mean hypoglycemic symptoms was –0.91
for those who had 2 or more symptoms at baseline (P<.001)
and was an increase of 0.25 for those who had fewer than 2
symptoms at baseline (P<.001).
Medication-Taking Adherence
At baseline, 35.0% (n=307) were nonadherent in taking medicine
(≥2 on a 0–4 scale), and at 6 months, 29.4% (n=260) were
nonadherent (P<.001). For participants who were nonadherent
at baseline, adherence improved by a mean of 0.73 (SD 1.05,
P<.001, effect size 0.59) at 6 months, and 124 (40.4%) of the
previous nonadherent participants were considered adherent.
For those who had been adherent at baseline (n=575), there was
an increase of 0.18 in mean nonadherence (P<.001).
Exercise
At baseline, 23.2% (203/876) indicated that they were taking
no aerobic exercise. This was reduced to 18.4% (n=163) at 6
months (P<.001). At 6 months, the mean increase in exercise
for nonexercisers was 43 minutes (SD 73, P<.001) of exercise
per week, and 124 (61.1%) of the nonexercisers reported some
aerobic exercise. For those reporting some exercise, there was
a mean decrease of 1.4 minutes per week (P=.61).
In each of the cases above, the improvements for the less
well-off group (high HbA1c, indications of depression, etc) were
much greater than any negative changes for those who had been
doing well at baseline.
Percentage of Participants With at Least One Problem
At baseline, 70.4% (622/884) of participants fell into 1 or more
of the above groups (high HbA1c, high depression,
hypoglycemic, nonadherent, or nonexercisers); 40.6% had 2 or
more problem scores and 19.5% had 3 or more. The 5 criteria
variables were not correlated with each other, with the exception
of hypoglycemic symptoms and PHQ depression (r=.37).
Percentage of Participants Benefiting
We then looked at what proportion of the total study population
completing 6-month questionnaires improved in at least one of
the 5 criteria variables (hypothesis 7). Using effect-size
improvements of at least 0.4 as an indication of an improvement,
75.0% of the study population (n=662) improved in at least one
of the 5 criteria variables, and 37.1% (n=327) improved in 2 or
more. The mean number of improvements (of ≥0.4 effect size)
was 1.13. When broken down by how many of the 5 of these
problems a participant had, the mean number of improvements
tended to increase with the mean number of problems. Those
with none of the 5 criteria problems had a mean of 0.671
improvements (out of a possible 5, n=268); those with 1 problem
or condition had a mean of 1.08 improvements (n=272); those
with 2 problems had 1.31 improvements (n=195); those with 3
problems had 1.52 improvements (n=125); and those with 4 or
5 problems had 2.06 improvements (n=52). There was a
correlation (Pearson r=.35) between the number of problems
and the number of improvements (P<.001).
Discussion
There were modest but statistically significant improvement in
13 of the 14 outcome measures, and 10 of those were significant
at the P<.001 level. There were significant increases in those
completing suggested laboratory tests for diabetes. There was
no significant change in quality of sleep. This consistency and
level of significance suggests that these improvements were not
the result of multiple testing. If we apply a Bonferroni correction
and use .003 as the level of significance, 11 of 17 outcomes
remain statistically significant.
BCBH-D may help meet the Healthy People 2020 diabetes
objectives. The proportion of study participants with HbA1c >9
was reduced from 20% (n=98) to 15% (n=74), and the
proportion of participants tested for foot and microalbumin
(kidney function) in the last 6 months increased by 13% and
15% (Table 2), respectively. This program also adds to the
number receiving formal diabetes education.
Because this is a translation study, participants were not screened
for HbA1c or other symptoms. This led to a high degree of
heterogeneity among study participants. In addition, many
participants were already managing their diabetes and had little
room for improvement. It was important, therefore, to determine
who might benefit. It appears that those who had an HbA1c of
≥9 decreased their HbA1c by approximately the same amount
as one would expect by taking metformin [30]. In addition,
75.0% (n=662) of the sample improved by an effect size of 0.4
or more for at least one of HbA1c, depression, hypoglycemia,
adherence to medications, and minutes of exercise. Those with
none of the 5 problems still tended to benefit, with a mean
improvement in 0.67 out of 5 possible criterial outcomes.
However, as might be expected, those with more “problems”
had more benefits (ie, making a greater mean number of
improvements of ≥0.4 effect size among the 5 criterial
measures).
6-Month Noncompleters
Considering the large initial sample (N=1242) and large number
of outcomes, there were few statistical differences between
6-month completers and noncompleters. Based on the significant
difference in baseline medication adherence, there is some
evidence that noncompleters were slightly more likely to be
medication noncompliers. They were also slightly younger.
There is no evidence that they were more ill or had greater
severity of symptoms, which would suggest that attrition would
have been unlikely to bias 6-month outcomes.

 Modes of Delivery
Despite a few differences at baseline, there were few differences
in 6-month changes between those attending community
workshops and the Internet group. This suggests that both modes
are similarly effective. In this study, very few people had a
choice of modes. However, it may be that future studies will
find a greater population penetration when people are offered
a choice.
Limitations
Because we lack a control group, we cannot be certain that the
improvements observed in this study are not due to other factors.
Plausible alternative explanations for the improvements include
the introduction of new medications in the marketplace and
health plan initiatives that were implemented for the purpose
of improving the health of individuals with chronic conditions.
It is also possible that there was a beneficial effect from
participating in the workshops resulting in a greater likelihood
of participants taking advantage of the Anthem initiatives and
new medications. While these other factors are important to
keep in mind, the consistency of the statistically significant
improvements across multiple domains suggests a favorable
impact of workshop participation.
By looking at the participants who were worse off on specific
measures, we risk that part of the observed improvements might
have been the result of regression to the mean. While regression
to the mean may have contributed to subgroup improvements,
it most likely does not explain all of the improvement.
Most of this study population were covered by a health plan
and had a high mean baseline education (15.4 years). This may
have contributed to the positive results. However, there were
similar results when the small-group program was used with a
low-education (mean of 7 years) Spanish-speaking population
[8].
Data on how well improvements are sustained after 6 months
are not included in this study. A future study will examine
12-month outcomes and address the sustainability of
improvements following the intervention.
In order to reduce participant burden, unfortunately we did not
include self-efficacy to manage diabetes in the questionnaires
for this study. The program was designed to enhance
self-efficacy and has been found to be significantly associated
with self-efficacy in earlier randomized trials [7-9]. In a future
translation study, it would be desirable to include a measure of
self-efficacy to manage diabetes [31].
We did not attempt to control for changes in medication usage.
Choosing to take medication for diabetes may be a part of
self-management, and thus adding medication could be a
positive outcome. In other cases, participants may have begun
taking medication because of worsening health. A future study
might want to look carefully at the relationships between
self-management education, medication change, and health
outcomes, as well as at other changes in behaviors as mediating
variables.
Conclusion
As a community-based public health intervention, BCBH-D
offered in two modes demonstrated small but significant
benefits. It also showed promise for helping to meet at least
some of the Healthy People 2020 diabetes objectives. More
important, it demonstrated clinically significant benefits for
those with high HbA1c, and important benefits for those with
depression and hypoglycemia, as well as nonadherers to
medication and nonexercisers. The benefits differed by
individual, but a large majority of the population demonstrated
meaningful improvements in at least one of the above areas.
This study demonstrated that the peer-facilitated BCBH-D in
both face-to-face and Internet formats can assist a national
sample of health plan members in improving their diabetes
management.
