Abstract
Aims—1) To identify trajectories of cannabis use across adolescence, 2) to measure the influence 
of cannabis use characteristics on functional connectivity of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and 
3) to assess whether patterns of functional connectivity related to cannabis use are associated with 
psychosocial functioning 2 years later.
Design—The Pitt Mother & Child Project (PMCP) is a prospective, longitudinal study of male 
youth at high risk for psychopathology based on family income and gender.
Setting—Participants were recruited between age 6–17 months from the Women, Infants, and 
Children Nutritional Supplement program (WIC) in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area.
Participants—N=158 PMCP young men contributed fMRI and substance use data at age 20.
Measurements—Latent class growth analysis was used to determine trajectories of cannabis use 
frequency from age 14–19. Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis was used to measure 
functional connectivity between the NAcc and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Adolescent cannabis use 
trajectory, recent frequency of use, and age of initiation were considered as developmental factors. 
We also tested whether functional connectivity was associated with depressive symptoms, 
anhedonia, and educational attainment at age 22.
Findings—We identified three distinct trajectories of adolescent cannabis use, characterized by 
stable high, escalating, or stable low use. Cannabis use trajectory group had a significant effect on 
NAcc functional connectivity to the medial PFC (F=11.32, Z=4.04, pFWE-corr=.000). The

 escalating trajectory group displayed a pattern of negative NAcc-mPFC connectivity that was 
linked to higher levels of depressive symptoms (r=−.17, p=.041), anhedonia (r=−.19, p=.028), and 
lower educational attainment (t=−2.77, p=.006) at age 22.
Conclusions—Pattern of cannabis use frequency across adolescence in US youth could have 
consequences for mood symptoms and educational attainment in early adulthood via altered 
function in neural reward circuitry.
Introduction
Cannabis use is a critical and growing public health problem among adolescents and young 
adults. In the United States, adolescent cannabis use has increased since the mid-2000s and 
is consistently higher than nicotine use, with 44.5% of 12th graders reporting lifetime use of 
cannabis in 2016, and 6.0% reporting daily use in the last 30 days (1). Although a majority 
of adolescents consider cannabis benign (2), adolescent use is associated with poor 
educational attainment (3) and mental health problems in adulthood (4). Risk for use, use-
related problems, and poor psychosocial outcomes are particularly high among male 
adolescents who live in urban, low-SES settings (5). However, the mechanisms linking 
adolescent cannabis use to poor psychosocial functioning in early adulthood remain poorly 
understood.
Adolescent cannabis use has been linked with a constellation of negative outcomes that 
share motivational impairments, including depression (4), anhedonia – difficulty with 
motivation for or enjoyment of rewarding experiences (6), and low academic achievement, 
including poor school performance and early school drop-out (3). All of these factors can 
have profound negative impacts on adult functioning in vocational and social domains (3, 7), 
suggesting that altered motivational processing may be a core feature of cannabis abuse that 
can lead to a variety of problematic outcomes (8).
One potential mechanism for the effects of adolescent cannabis use on motivation and later 
psychosocial functioning is via alterations in neural reward circuitry, which is consistently 
implicated in the initiation and maintenance of substance use, and the transition to addiction 
(for review, please see 9). Critical regions in this circuit include the striatum, the PFC, 
including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the thalamus (9–11), which collectively 
integrate information about reward, motivation, and long-term goals to guide adaptive 
behavior (12). Previous literature has reported altered morphology and neural response to 
reward in these regions among adolescent and adult cannabis users (13).
Cannabis exposure is hypothesized to impact brain structure and function via 
downregulation and desensitization of neural endocannabinoid receptors (14), which are 
densely expressed throughout the cortex and basal ganglia (15). These receptors regulate 
neuronal migration, axonal pathfinding, and the generation of glial cells, indicating that the 
endocannabinoid system has an important influence on synaptic pruning and myelination 
(16). Therefore, cannabis exposure may influence reward circuit function by altering the 
connectivity of key regions. Congruently, several studies have reported altered connectivity 
in association with cannabis use, including aberrant resting-state functional connectivity 
(rsFC) of the default mode, insula, and lateral visual networks among cannabis users (17, 
Lichenstein et al.

 18), reduced interhemispheric rsFC among cannabis dependent adolescents (19), and 
heightened rsFC of the medial frontal gyrus in association with cannabis use among high 
risk youth (20). Furthermore, increased functional connectivity between the PFC and 
occipitoparietal cortex has been reported in association with increased cognitive control 
demands among heavy cannabis users relative to controls (21), and cannabis dependent 
individuals display heightened functional connectivity between the PFC and basal ganglia 
during successful inhibition, relative to non-dependent cannabis users (22).
Functional connectivity of the NAcc, the locus of initial drug response and a hub of the 
reward circuit (9), could be influenced by use over time (23). Indeed, acute cannabis 
exposure has been found to decrease rsFC between the NAcc and PFC, ACC, striatum, and 
thalamus (24), and reduced rsFC between the NAcc and PFC has been reported among 
patients with schizophrenia and cannabis use disorder relative to controls (25). In particular, 
one previous report demonstrated that regular cannabis users display greater functional 
connectivity between the NAcc and the ACC, striatum, and cerebellum to cannabis cues 
relative to neutral cues (26). However, to our knowledge no previous studies have examined 
functional connectivity of these regions in relation to non-drug reward or among young 
adults with various patterns of cannabis use over time.
Because the onset and peak of cannabis use occur during adolescence when widespread 
neurodevelopmental changes in reward systems are ongoing, adolescence represents a 
vulnerable window for drug effects (27). Cannabis use follows a clear developmental 
pattern: initiation typically occurs by the mid-teens (28) and peaks before age 25 (28), and 
use disorders are most prevalent between ages 15–20 (29). Animal studies have 
demonstrated that cannabis exposure in adolescence is associated with more severe and 
persistent behavioral changes relative to adult exposure, particularly decreased reward 
motivation and greater depressive-like behaviors (30), but neural and psychosocial effects in 
human adolescents are not well understood. In particular, the influence of cannabis use on 
NAcc connectivity could be moderated by 1) trajectories of exposure (consistent vs. 
escalating vs. decreasing use) across development; 2) recent frequency of use; and/or 3) 
developmental timing of use (i.e. early- vs. late-onset use).
Distinct trajectories of cannabis use could have different consequences for the development 
of neural circuitry and implications for functioning. For example, sharply increasing 
exposure across adolescence could have pernicious effects on reward circuitry because of 
challenges to adaptation during a window of rapid development (31). Indeed, there is 
evidence to suggest that an escalating pattern of cannabis use in adolescence is as predictive 
of clinically significant substance use in adulthood as early-onset use (32) and may be even 
more strongly associated with problem behavior than a pattern of persistently high use (33). 
Conversely, recent studies have indicated that some cannabis-related cognitive changes can 
reverse after abstinence in long-term users, suggesting that patterns of use over time might 
not be as impairing as level of recent use (34).
Alternatively, early initiation and consistent high-frequency use could confer particularly 
strong risk because of the duration and intensity of exposure at a vulnerable period in 
development. Congruently, several studies have demonstrated that earlier-onset cannabis use

 (i.e., beginning by age 16) is associated with more significant abnormalities in PFC function 
(27), worse neuropsychological functioning (35), educational problems (3), and later drug 
dependence (36). Another consideration is that many cannabis users also use alcohol (37), 
and cannabis effects may be attenuated when accounting for alcohol use (38).
We examined adolescent pattern of cannabis use, reward circuit function, and psychosocial 
adjustment in a high-risk sample: low-income young men from an urban setting (5) who 
have been assessed longitudinally since infancy as part of the Pitt Mother & Child Project 
(39). Specifically, our aims were to 1) determine distinct trajectories of cannabis use across 
adolescence, 2) measure the influence of cannabis use trajectory, recent frequency of use, 
and age of initiation on functional connectivity between the NAcc and PFC, and 3) to assess 
whether patterns of functional connectivity are associated with affective functioning and/or 
educational attainment 2 years later. Based on prior evidence that regular cannabis users 
display greater NAcc connectivity to cannabis-related stimuli (26), we hypothesized that a 
stable, high-frequency pattern of use across adolescence, greater recent cannabis use, and 
early initiation would be associated with reduced functional connectivity in response to non-
drug-related monetary reward. Furthermore, we hypothesized that trajectory of use across 
adolescence—because of developmental vulnerability—would have predictive power for 
reward circuit function even above the contributions of current use. Finally, we hypothesized 
that cannabis-related alterations in reward circuitry at age 20 would predict higher 
depressive symptoms, higher anhedonia, and lower educational attainment at age 22.
Methods
Design
The Pitt Mother & Child Project (PMCP) is a prospective, longitudinal study of risk and 
resiliency among low-income male participants recruited from the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 
area (39). This study was initiated in 1991 and a total of N=310 families were recruited from 
Women, Infant, and Children Nutritional Supplement Program (WIC) Clinics when 
participants were 6–17 months old. Participants completed in-person assessments at age 1.5, 
2, 3.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 17, 20, and 22. This study has the strength of allowing for 
concurrent examination of the relative influence of adolescent trajectory of cannabis use, 
recent frequency of use, and age of onset. Because subjects were recruited in infancy and 
followed prospectively, it was not possible to control the number of participants that would 
ultimately go on to engage in cannabis use. Rather, we took a data-driven approach to 
determine the different trajectories of cannabis use that were present among PMCP 
participants, and to use these trajectory groups as the basis for our functional connectivity 
analyses.
Participants
Participants were n=158 PMCP participants who completed an fMRI scan and substance use 
measures at age 20. All subjects were eligible to participate in the imaging study unless they 
reported any standard MRI contraindications. Procedures were approved by the University 
of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board. All participants provided written informed consent 
to study procedures and were compensated for their participation.

 Measures
Cannabis Use—Cannabis use characteristics were assessed at age 20 using the Lifetime 
History of Drug Use and Drug Consumption (40), a psychometrically sound, semi-structured 
interview. This was the first visit at which participants were asked about their frequency and 
quantity of use across development. For each year since their first use, participants reported 
their average days/month of cannabis use, average quantity, maximum quantity, and 
maximum number of days using their maximum quantity of cannabis. Retrospective report 
of cannabis use is valid (41), and may sometimes be more accurate than concurrent report 
because adolescents may under-report their current use because of concerns about legal 
consequences (42). The current analyses focused on average frequency of use for each year 
and age of initiation.
Alcohol Use—Annual alcohol use frequency (days/month) and quantity (average number 
of drinks/occasion) for each year since participants’ first alcohol use were assessed at age 20 
using the Lifetime Drinking History (43). The product of alcohol use frequency and quantity 
was calculated for each year and average alcohol exposure from age 10 to 19 was included 
as a covariate in all functional connectivity analyses.
Age 22 Psychosocial Outcomes
Depression: Participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; 44) at age 20 and 
22, a widely used, 21-item self-report questionnaire that had adequate reliability in this 
sample (α=.89). BDI scores did not change significantly from age 20 to 22 (F(302,1)=.803, 
p=.371).
Anhedonia: At age 22 only, participants completed the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale 
(45), a psychometrically sound, 14-item questionnaire appropriate for measuring anhedonia 
in typical and clinical samples. Reliability was adequate in this sample (α=.851).
Educational Attainment: Participants reported their highest level of school completed on a 
13-point scale (“below grade 9” to “completion of graduate degree”) (46). For the current 
analyses, participants were classified as having either obtained “high school diploma (or 
GED) or less” or “some higher education or more” (39.9% at age 20; 52% at 22). 
Educational attainment increased from age 20 to age 22 (X2=57.85, p=.00).
Functional Connectivity Analysis
fMRI Acquisition Procedure—Participants (n=186) underwent functional imaging on a 
Siemens TIM Trio 3T scanner using a gradient echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with 34 
axial slices (3.1mm thick; TR/TE=2000/28ms, FOV=20cm, matrix=64×64), as reported 
previously (47–55). A reference EPI scan was acquired and inspected for artifacts and 
signal. Twenty-eight participants were excluded because of intoxication (n=4), psychosis 
(n=1), <75% response rate (n=13), poor coverage (n=8), or unusable data (n=2), resulting in 
the final sample of n=158 included in the current analyses. All participants had <2mm mean 
movement in any direction.

 The fMRI paradigm was an 8-min, 24-trial, slow event-related card-guessing game that 
assesses response to anticipation and receipt of monetary reward (see 49 for task details). 
Participants guessed whether a card was high or low, anticipated win or loss, and received 
feedback and monetary outcome. Trials were presented in a fixed, pseudorandom order, with 
participants unaware of fixed outcomes. This task robustly activates reward circuitry, 
including the NAcc (see Supplemental Figure 1 for task main effects).
fMRI Functional Connectivity Analysis—We conducted preprocessing and analysis 
using SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Imaging data were realigned, unwarped, co-
registered to segmented structural images, spatially normalized into standard stereotactic 
space (Montreal Neurological Institute) using a 12-parameter affine model, and smoothed 
with a 6mm FWHM Gaussian filter. Voxel-wise signal intensities were ratio normalized to 
the whole-brain global mean. Functional connectivity analyses of win anticipation > loss 
anticipation and win outcome > loss outcome were conducted using psychophysiological 
interaction (gPPI) (for description of PPI, please see 56). These contrasts were chosen 
because PPI analyses require the contrast of 2 active task conditions (rather than 1 active 
condition and 1 baseline condition) (56). The bilateral NAcc, defined anatomically using 
WFU PickAtlas (v. 3.0.4), was the seed region because of its critical role in reward 
processing (12) and association with substance use (10). Functional connectivity was 
examined between the NAcc and a region of interest including the PFC and ACC, defined 
anatomically using WFU PickAtlas (v. 3.0.4) to include Brodmann Areas 9–12, 24–25, 32–
33, and 44–47 (see supplemental Figure 2).
Data Analyses
Aim 1: Developmental Trajectory of Adolescent Cannabis Use—Trajectory group 
analyses used frequency of cannabis use from age 14–19 years. This range covers a large 
portion of adolescence, includes the typical age of initiation (28), and included past-year use 
because assessments occurred on or around participants’ 20th birthdays. We used a latent 
class growth analyses in MPlus, which identifies clusters of people in common 
developmental pathways (58, 59). Models with 1–4 groups were tested (Supplementary 
Table 1). We followed recommendations that the smallest group contain at least 5% of the 
sample (60).
Aim 2: Influence of Cannabis Use Characteristics on Age 20 Functional 
Connectivity—One-way ANOVA was used to test the effect of trajectory group on NAcc 
functional connectivity. Clusters demonstrating significant effects of trajectory group were 
used as a mask for post-hoc pairwise t-tests. Regression was used to test the effect of recent 
frequency of cannabis use and age of initiation on NAcc functional connectivity. Daily 
nicotine use, antisocial personality disorder (present/absent), lifetime alcohol exposure, and 
SES were covariates because of their influence on reward circuitry (61) or association with 
trajectory group. Functional connectivity with the PFC was tested at p<.005 (57) and 
correction for multiple comparisons used a cluster-level FWE-corrected p<.05 threshold 
(62). This threshold was selected to balance risk for Type I and Type II error, based on 
current recommendations in the field (57). Carter et al. (57) calculated power curves to 
illustrate sample sizes necessary to detect moderate effects at various statistical thresholds.

 Based on their calculations, a threshold of p<.001 would be likely to obscure meaningful 
effects in on our current sample size, whereas a threshold of p<.005 would allow us to detect 
a moderate effect.
Aim 3: Relation between Age 20 Functional Connectivity and Age 22 
Psychosocial Outcomes—Pearson bivariate correlation analyses tested whether 
functional connectivity related to adolescent cannabis use was associated with depression, 
anhedonia, or educational attainment at age 22.
Results
Developmental Trajectory of Adolescent Cannabis Use
Trajectory analyses yielded a 3-group model (Supplementary Table 1). The stable-high 
group (6.9%; n=11) contained participants with an early age of initiation who had consistent, 
high-frequency use. The escalating group (22.9%; n=36) contained participants who 
exhibited increasing frequency of use and typical age of onset. The stable-low group (70.2%; 
n=111) contained participants who reported either no (n=33) or infrequent (n=78) cannabis 
use. (Figure 1; Table 1).
Influence of Cannabis Use Characteristics on Age 20 Functional Connectivity
Trajectory—Consistent with previous reports (22), groups did not vary significantly in 
their BOLD activation, but differed significantly in functional connectivity between the 
bilateral NAcc and the medial PFC to win outcome > loss outcome (Table 2). The escalating 
group displayed negatively correlated activation of the NAcc and mPFC, whereas activity in 
these regions was positively correlated in both the stable-low and stable-high groups. Post-
hoc pairwise t-tests revealed that functional connectivity differed significantly between the 
escalating and stable-low groups (k=509, pFWE-corr=.002, t=4.57, Z=4.41, peak MNI: −6, 
32, 16). The difference between the escalating and stable-high trajectory groups (k=145, 
puncorrected=.014, t=4.40, peak MNI: 0, 48, 38) did not meet the FWE-corrected significance 
threshold (see Figure 2).
Recent frequency of cannabis use and age of initiation did not predict functional 
connectivity
Relation between Age 20 Functional Connectivity and Age 22 Psychosocial Outcomes
Negative functional connectivity between the NAcc and the region of the mPFC that 
differentiated the cannabis use trajectory groups at age 20 was associated with higher 
depression, higher anhedonia, and lower educational attainment at age 22 (Table 2).
Discussion
For young men from urban, low-SES backgrounds, trajectory of cannabis use across 
adolescence was related to differences in NAcc functional connectivity in response to 
receiving monetary reward at age 20, even after controlling for average annual alcohol use. 
Functional connectivity, in turn, was associated with higher depressive symptoms and 
anhedonia, and lower educational attainment at age 22. Most notably, an escalating pattern

 of cannabis use across adolescence—rather than stable, high-frequency use—was associated 
with negative functional coupling between the NAcc and mPFC.
According to the incentive sensitization model, repeated substance use leads to a 
sensitization of the reward system to drug-related stimuli relative to natural rewards (63, 64) 
and circuit-level changes in the mesocortiolimbic system give rise to attentional and 
decision-making biases that promote drug-seeking behavior (65). Congruently, recent 
studies have reported that cannabis use is linked to stronger functional NAcc-ACC 
connectivity to cannabis cues (26), but blunted NAcc response to monetary cues (66), and 
the current study reports negative NAcc-mPFC connectivity to monetary reward among 
those with an escalating pattern of adolescent cannabis use. Future studies should include 
both drug-related and non-drug-related rewards to evaluate whether individuals with an 
escalating pattern of cannabis use may display a shift away from natural rewards and toward 
drug rewards (63). This could also contribute to symptoms of depression and anhedonia, as 
well as impaired educational performance.
Contrary to our expectations, the escalating trajectory group showed a distinct pattern of 
negative functional connectivity between the NAcc and mPFC, relative to both the stable-
low and stable-high groups. The stable-high group was characterized by lower SES, higher 
rates of antisocial personality disorder, and earlier age of cannabis use initiation. Both acute 
and chronic stress exposure have substantial impacts on endocannabinoid system 
functioning (67). Because this group has been exposed to a high level of stress, it is possible 
that cannabis exposure may have a different impact on neural development in these 
participants and may even buffer against neurotoxic effects of chronic stress. Future research 
is necessary to assess whether neural effects of cannabis exposure are moderated by early 
life or chronic stress. Alternatively, the brain may undergo neuroadaption in the context of 
early-onset, consistent use, which may attenuate exposure effects. Although early-onset 
substance use is a well-established risk factor for later substance dependence and poor 
psychosocial development, evidence suggests that an escalating trajectory of use is similarly 
harmful (32, 33, 68). Given the small size of our stable-high use group, future research is 
necessary to explore differential effects of stable-high versus escalating cannabis exposure 
and characteristics that distinguish individuals with each pattern.
Our findings that altered functional connectivity between the NAcc and PFC is associated 
with poor psychosocial outcomes supports the hypothesis that disrupted neural circuit 
function may result in poor regulation of motivational systems, including difficulty 
enhancing positive affect, pursuing goals, or focusing on future reward. The observed 
association between NAcc-mPFC functional connectivity and sub-threshold 
symptomatology has important implications, and the long-term consequences to SES, health, 
and social functioning could be dramatic. Among young men from urban, low-SES 
backgrounds, educational attainment may be a particularly salient marker of later status, 
including upward social mobility (69).
Our sample includes low-income males from an urban community, a particularly high-risk 
population (5). However, this focus prevented us from examining gender differences or 
effects in women, young people from higher SES, or young adults living in rural or suburban

 communities. Additionally, our high-risk, prospective design precluded the ability to recruit 
subjects based on patterns of use. Rather, we took a data-driven approach to determine the 
different trajectories of cannabis use that were present within this sample. The small size of 
the resulting stable-high trajectory group may have limited our power to detect significant 
relationships with this group of participants. Future research could use larger samples or 
utilize additional risk criteria for sample inclusion, such as parental use of substances, 
mental health issues, or high levels of infant negative emotionality, to maximize the number 
of infants showing cannabis use in adolescence.
Finally, because neural response to reward was measured at age 20, it is impossible to 
disentangle premorbid patterns of neural function from effects of cannabis use. Individuals 
at high risk for substance abuse have been found to display differences in neural structure, 
function, and connectivity in the absence of personal substance use (70). Therefore, aberrant 
patterns of neural response to reward among cannabis users are likely to result from a 
combination of predisposing neural abnormalities and exposure effects that interact across 
development. Abnormalities in neural reward circuitry may also be influenced by early life 
stress (49) and/or neurotoxic effects of co-occurring alcohol exposure (71).
In conclusion, our findings suggest that different trajectories of adolescent cannabis use are 
associated with distinct patterns neural reward circuit function in early adulthood, with 
escalating use appearing to confer higher risk for impaired motivation, including higher 
depressive symptoms, anhedonia, and poor educational attainment. Alterations in reward 
circuit function represent a potential mechanism by which cannabis users experience 
psychosocial consequences that could be pernicious for adult functioning.

Trajectory of Adolescent Cannabis Use Predicts Functional Connectivity of the Nucleus 
Accumbens in Response to Monetary Reward at Age 20 Controlling for Lifetime Alcohol 
Use.
Note. Functional connectivity within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; A) differed for 
three trajectory groups (B). Bars in (B) represent mean functional connectivity for each 
trajectory group; error bars represent standard error of the mean. Group-effect results were 
used as a mask for post hoc tests comparing pairs of groups, which yielded a significant 
difference between the escalating and stable-low trajectory groups We note that using a 
statistical threshold of p<.001 for the overall group analysis yielded 3 smaller clusters within 
the current mPFC cluster (k=59, puncorrected=.013, F=11.32, Z=4.04, peak MNI: 6, 32, 16; 
k=39, puncorrected=.037, F=10.08, Z=3.78, peak MNI: 10, 30, 22; k=69, puncorrected=.008, 
F=10.06, Z=3.78, peak MNI: −6, 44, 36).

cDiagnoses determined based on the SCID at age 20.
dMean frequency of use at age 20 for ecstasy, hallucinogens, inhalants, opioids, sedatives, stimulants, and cocaine/crack assessed with the Lifetime History of Drug Use; average frequency of use for each 
substance was less than 1 day/month.
eMood Disorders includes major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and dysthymia.
fAnxiety Disorders includes panic disorder, social phobia, specific phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.
gattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder (CD) were assessed using the K-SADS at age 17 and data from this assessment was available 
for n=140 participants in the current sample.
hDepressive symptoms measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; 44).
iAnhedonia measured using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS; 45).
jEducational attainment was defined as a dichotomous variable, computed as “high school diploma (or GED) or less” or “some higher education or more”.

Depressive symptoms were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory at age 22 (BDI; 44). Anhedonia was measured using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale at age 22 (SHAPS; 45). Assocation 
between functional connectivity and age 22 depressive symptoms and anhedonia was assessed using pearson bivariate correlations. Educational attainment was defined as a dichotomous variable, computed 
as “high school diploma (or GED) or less” or “some higher education or more”. Therefore, a t-test was used to assess the relationship between this variable and functional connectivity.
