Abstract
Drug addiction denotes the dependency of tumors on the same therapeutic drugs to which they 
have acquired resistance. Observations from cultured cells1–3, animal models4 and patients5–7 
raise the possibility that cancer drug addiction can instigate a potential cancer vulnerability, which 
may be used therapeutically. However, for this trait to become of clinical interest, it is imperative 
to first define the underlying mechanism. Therefore, we performed an unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 
knockout screen to functionally mine the genome of melanoma cells that are both resistant and 
addicted to BRAF inhibition for “addiction genes”. Here, we describe a signaling pathway 
comprising ERK2, JUNB and FRA1, disruption of which allows tumor cells to reverse addiction 
and survive upon treatment discontinuation. This occurred both in culture and mice, and was 
irrespective of the acquired drug resistance mechanism. In melanoma and lung cancer cells, death 
induced by drug withdrawal was preceded by a specific ERK2-dependent phenotype switch, 
alongside transcriptional reprogramming reminiscent of EMT. In melanoma, this caused shutdown 
of the lineage survival oncoprotein MITF, restoration of which reversed both phenotype switching 
and drug addiction-associated lethality. In melanoma patients who had progressed on BRAF 
inhibition, treatment cessation was followed by increased expression of the phenotype switch-
associated receptor tyrosine kinase AXL. Drug discontinuation synergized with the melanoma

 chemotherapeutic dacarbazine by further suppressing MITF and its prosurvival target BCL2 while 
inducing DNA damage. Our results uncover a pathway driving cancer drug addiction, which may 
guide alternating therapeutic strategies for enhanced clinical responses of drug-resistant cancers.
We treated a panel of BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines with either BRAF inhibitor 
dabrafenib or dabrafenib + MEK inhibitor trametinib. As expected, all four cell lines were 
highly sensitive to these drugs (Fig. 1a). After 3-5 months, pools of cells emerged that had 
apparently developed resistance to the lethal drug dose (labeled ‘BR’ for BRAF inhibitor-
Resistant and ‘BMR’ for BRAF + MEK inhibitor-Resistant). Strikingly however, when drug 
treatment was acutely discontinued, these drug-resistant cells massively died (Fig. 1b and 
Extended Data Fig. 1); apparently, they had become addicted to the very drugs that served to 
eliminate them.
To functionally screen for essential drug addiction genes, a lentiviral CRISPR-Cas9 GeCKO 
library8 was introduced into drug-treated 451LuBR cells (Fig. 1c). Thirty days after drug 
withdrawal, 13 clones emerged, which apparently had lost the drug addiction phenotype. For 
nine of these, we identified sgRNAs in ≥2 individual clones (Fig. 1d, for full sequencing 
data, see Supplementary table 1) targeting genes encoding several factors known to 
communicate to one another, namely ERK2, JUNB and MEK1, while also FRA1 (a JUNB 
partner) was included for further analyses. A first validation round confirmed that the 
sgRNAs had caused the expected perturbations of genes encoding ERK2 (with intact ERK1; 
Fig. 1e), JUNB (Fig. 1f), MEK1 (Fig. 1g) and FRA1 (Fig. 1h). Thus, a genome-wide 
perturbation screen successfully identified a signaling pathway responsible for the drug 
addiction phenotype.
To determine the generality of these screen hits, we used a panel of melanoma cell lines that 
had acquired drug resistance through distinct mechanisms: 451LuBR showed hyperactivation 
of the ERK pathway (Extended Data Fig. 2a) while harboring an activating MEK1K57N 
mutation (Fig. 2a); MEK-ERK signaling was also boosted in A375BMR cells, which carry a 
BRAF amplification (Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 2b, c); Mel888BMR, too, show 
hyperactivated MEK-ERK signaling and harbor a kinase domain duplication (Fig. 2c and 
Extended Data Fig. 2d), which we have characterized recently9. A101DBMR cells, in 
contrast, acquired drug resistance without detectable ERK reactivation (Fig. 2d).
Whereas control melanoma cells died massively upon drug withdrawal, knocking out ERK2 
resulted in a vigorous rescue, across the entire cell panel (Fig. 2e, f). In contrast, genetic 
perturbation of ERK1 failed to prevent lethal drug addiction. Similar to ERK2, genetic 
inactivation of JUNB generally rescued drug addiction-associated death (Fig. 2g, h), as did 
FRA1 loss (Fig. 2i, j). Knocking out MEK1, too, rescued drug addiction, but only in 
451LuBR cells (Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). This was due to its resistance mechanism, a 
MEK1K57N activating mutation (Fig. 2a, 1g) rendering this cell line susceptible to breaking 
drug addiction upon MEK1 inactivation. Thus, ERK2, JUNB and FRA1 validated across a 
heterogeneous cell line panel, highlighting their common mechanism of action independent 
of how cells achieved therapy resistance.

 To determine whether the drug addiction phenotype also manifests in vivo, we established 
melanoma xenografts in the presence of both dabrafenib and trametinib. When treatment 
was ceased, control tumors regressed, in contrast to JUNB- and ERK2- knockout tumors, 
which continued to expand (Fig. 2k), indicating that the drug addiction phenotype is also 
seen tumors.
These findings implicated ERK signaling in the sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to 
treatment discontinuation. In 451LuBR, A375BMR and Mel888BMR cells, we observed 
hyperactivation of MEK-ERK upon drug withdrawal, a so-called rebound signal (Extended 
Data Fig. 4a). Remarkably, also A101DBMR cells, which are resistant to BRAF + MEK 
inhibition in an ERK-independent fashion (Fig. 2d), showed an equally intense ERK 
rebound upon drug washout. This result uncouples the mechanism of acquired drug 
resistance from the signaling manifesting drug addiction. Corroborating these findings, also 
a low dose of ERK inhibitor completely rescued lethality by drug withdrawal not only in the 
three cell lines with ERK rebound (consistent with Moriceau G et al.3) but also in 
A101DBMR cells (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Thus, regardless of the resistance mechanism, 
melanoma cells commonly show ERK rebound upon drug withdrawal, which contributes to 
the drug addiction trait.
Given the identification of JUNB and FRA1 in our screen, two key signaling transcription 
factors, we investigated whether drug addiction is relayed by transcriptional reprogramming. 
RNA profiling of drug-addicted cells upon drug cessation revealed a common expression 
alteration in two cell lines for the top 200 variant genes (Extended Data Fig. 5a). This was 
accompanied by a major switch in the activity of genes involved in cell proliferation and 
those contributing to cell invasion, reminiscent of changes seen for “phenotype switching”: 
transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity between alternative proliferative and invasive 
states10–12 (Fig. 3a).
MITF is a pivotal transcription factor driving the specification and survival of the 
melanocytic lineage13 and plays a central role in melanoma phenotype switching11. 
Consistently, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed a strong negative association 
between the drug withdrawal and an MITF signature (Fig. 3b), with many MITF targets 
being strongly downregulated upon drug withdrawal. GSEA confirmed that AP-1, TEAD 
and JUNB transcriptional signatures14 were enriched upon drug withdrawal (Extended Data 
Fig. 5b), further supporting the notion that cells underwent phenotype switching.
Concordantly, MITF protein levels declined upon drug withdrawal, in all four cell lines 
examined (Fig. 3c). As a result, both MITF-controlled Melan-A and prosurvival BCL2 
proteins were downregulated. Conversely, drug withdrawal was associated with the 
upregulation of fibronectin and downregulation of E-cadherin, two EMT proteins. We and 
others previously reported that MITF expression is inversely correlated with that of the 
receptor tyrosine kinase AXL15,16. Consistent with this, AXL was induced by drug 
removal, as were JUNB and FRA1 (Fig. 3c). cJUN can mediate a melanoma phenotype 
switch upon BRAF inhibition and cytokine treatment17,18, but was not strongly nor 
consistently induced (Fig. 3c) while its ablation failed to prevent cell death induced by drug 
withdrawal (Extended Data Fig. 5c, d). Upon drug withdrawal, cells became highly

 migratory, another key feature of EMT (Extended Data Fig. 5e, f). Furthermore, the 
phenotype switch was not seen in non-drug-addicted cells (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b).
To investigate whether this can be recapitulated in a clinical setting, we performed 
immunohistochemical analysis on a set of tumor biopsies from BRAF inhibitor-relapsed 
melanoma patients. This cohort comprised tumors both from patients who were still on 
BRAFi treatment at the time of the biopsy and patients who were already taken off the drug. 
We observed that in a highly significant number of cases, treatment discontinuation 
correlated with increased expression levels of AXL (Fig. 3d), indicating that at least some 
features of EMT/phenotype switching are also observed in patients.
To examine any contribution of MITF to the phenotype switch, we restored its expression 
prior to drug withdrawal (Fig. 3e). MITF was at least partially functional, as judged by the 
attenuation of Melan-A downregulation. Its restoration led to substantial protection to death 
by drug withdrawal (Fig. 3f), demonstrating that drug addiction is accompanied by an 
MITF-dependent phenotype switch, which underlies the associated loss of fitness.
To determine whether the screen hits were functionally connected to phenotype switching, 
we generated ERK2 and JUNB knockout pools and performed RNA sequencing upon drug 
withdrawal. A shift in transcriptional patterns occurred in control cells upon drug removal, 
but this was diminished in the ERK2 knockout derivatives and to a somewhat lesser extent in 
the JUNB knockout cells (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Consistently, the phenotype switch upon 
drug withdrawal was reverted in the absence of either ERK2 or JUNB proteins (Extended 
Data Fig. 7b). Rescue of drug washout-induced cell death by ERK2 or JUNB depletion was 
strongly correlated with maintenance of the MITF signature, and a lack of AP-1, TEAD and 
JUNB-associated genes (Extended Data Fig. 7c). As a consequence, the phenotypic changes 
in cell morphology upon drug withdrawal were neutralized in the ERK2 and JUNB 
knockout cell lines, but not in ERK1 knockout cells (Fig. 3g).
To determine whether ERK2 is a master regulator of the phenotype switch as a function of 
drug addiction, we analyzed the expression levels of several proteins associated with this 
switch. This result was highly informative: first, upon loss of ERK2, MITF and its 
downstream targets BCL2 and Melan-A were no longer downregulated after drug removal 
(Fig. 3h). Second, the induction of JUNB and FRA1 upon drug withdrawal was diminished 
in ERK2 knockout cells (but not in ERK1 knockout cells). Third, also ablation of JUNB 
prevented the decline in MITF after drug withdrawal; it did however not affect ERK levels 
nor activity, suggesting that JUNB acts downstream of ERK and upstream of MITF. Fourth, 
cells lacking either ERK2 or JUNB, but again not ERK1, failed to undergo the EMT-like 
changes upon drug withdrawal, as judged by fibronectin and E-cadherin expression. In 
addition to genetic inactivation, also pharmacologic inhibition of ERK neutralized both 
changes in gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 8a) and morphology (Extended Data Fig. 
8b) upon drug withdrawal.
These in vitro observations were corroborated in vivo: whereas upon drug discontinuation, 
established A375BMR tumors (Fig. 2k) were largely negative for MITF and its targets 
Melan-A and GP100, in contrast JUNB or ERK2 knockout melanomas retained expression

 of MITF and its targets (Fig. 3i). These results demonstrate that ERK2 and JUNB act in an 
MITF-dependent genetic phenotype switching program governing drug addiction.
Increasing the levels and phosphorylation of ERK1 to those seen for ERK2 upon drug 
removal failed to cause cell death in the absence of ERK2, suggesting that ERK2 functions 
distinctly from ERK1 in the context of drug addiction (Extended Data Fig. 9a, b), consistent 
with their different activities in EMT19. Furthermore, in addition to acquired resistance, also 
upon on enforced BRAFi resistance (by ectopic expression of mutant MEK1T55delinsRT 20), 
tumor cell viability declined upon drug withdrawal, as well as levels of MITF and its targets 
(Extended Data Fig. 8c, d).
Since acquired resistance to precision drugs is commonly seen across tumor types and drugs, 
we investigated whether the ERK2/JUNB-dependent drug addiction mechanism is 
operational in lung cancer, too. Upon drug withdrawal, EGFR inhibitor CL-387,785-
refractory and -addicted1 HCC827 cells showed loss of fitness (Fig. 4a). Similarly to 
melanoma, pharmacologic (Extended Data Fig. 8e) or genetic ablation of ERK2 (but not 
ERK1) rescued the drug addiction of these NSCLC cells (Fig. 4a, b). Loss of fitness by drug 
withdrawal was preceded by several events also seen for melanoma cells, including 
hyperactivation of ERK and MEK and an EMT/phenotype switch (Fig. 4c). We conclude 
that the specific ERK2-JUNB-FRA1 pathway responsible for drug addiction is not limited to 
one particular tumor / treatment setting.
Although the extent of lethality imposed by drug addiction can be near-total (Fig. 1b, 
explaining the very low background in our screen), in the long run drug withdrawal-resistant 
clones spontaneously arose in cell pools (Extended Data Fig. 10a). Functional and 
biochemical analysis (Extended Data Fig. 10b, c) revealed that these drug withdrawal-
resistant clones had regained responsiveness to MAPK pathway inhibition. This is in line 
with successful clinical rechallenges with MAPK inhibitors in patients who had progressed 
on treatment21,22.
In a patient setting, emergence of drug withdrawal-resistant cells could be detrimental and 
prevent a durable clinical response. Therefore, we considered combining the cessation of 
BRAF inhibition with the initiation of another treatment. The chemotherapeutic dacarbazine 
(brand name DTIC) is an anticancer alkylating agent, which in the last decade has been 
commonly used as a single agent for metastatic melanoma, albeit with poor response 
rates23. We sought to find a therapeutic window to determine whether dacarbazine acts 
cooperatively with a discontinuation of treatment for the first treatment (BRAF inhibition), 
creating an alternating therapy. Increasing dacarbazine concentrations to up to 500 µg/ml 
had little cytotoxic effect on two drug-resistant and moderately drug-addicted melanoma cell 
lines in the presence of BRAF inhibitor (Fig. 4d). In contrast, there was a strong synergy 
when dacarbazine was administered upon withdrawal of BRAF inhibitor. This was 
accompanied by a synergistic induction of γH2AX, a marker of double strand DNA damage 
(Fig. 4e). Furthermore, this cooperatively suppressed MITF and its targets Melan-A and 
BCL2 (Fig. 4e). The reduction of the latter prosurvival protein, alongside the induction of 
DNA damage, provides a plausible mechanistic explanation for the observed synergy in 
induction of cell death between drug withdrawal and dacarbazine.

 It has been proposed that alternating or intermittent therapeutic strategies may create larger 
therapeutic windows21,24–26. Since we observe that after a long drug holiday, rare resistant 
clones can emerge, we propose that rather than a plain drug holiday one ought to explore 
optimal alternating treatment modalities. Our results suggest that insight into the molecular 
mechanism of drug addiction (which seems to be conserved among different tumor types 
and targeted agents) may guide rational alternating treatment strategies to enhance the extent 
of killing of drug-resistant cells and allow for more durable clinical benefit.
Methods
Genome-wide CRISPR-cas9 knockout (GeCKO) screen
Drug-addicted 451LuBR cells were lentivirally transduced with two GeCKO libraries (A and 
B)8. Two days after infection, cells were selected with puromycin (2 µg/ml) for 3 days. Cells 
were split into two pools, and one arm was subjected to BRAFi dabrafenib (1 µM) treatment, 
whereas the other arm was left untreated. Colonies formed in the drug-deprived group were 
individually picked and expanded. For identification of sgRNAs in individual clones, 
genomic DNA was isolated and sgRNAs were recovered by PCR amplification. Amplified 
DNA fragments were cloned into the TOPO TA-cloning vector (450071, Invitrogen) 
followed by identification of the sgRNA by Sanger sequencing.
Compounds
BRAF inhibitors dabrafenib and PLX4720, MEK inhibitor trametinib, ERK inhibitor 
SCH772984 and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor CL-387,785 were purchased from Selleck 
Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). Dacarbazine was obtained from the pharmacy of the 
Slotervaart hospital (Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
Cell lines
A375, Mel888, A101D, SK-Mel-28, D10 and HEK293T cells were from the Peeper 
laboratory cell line stock. HCC827 and HCC827CLR cells were from K. Suda and T. 
Mitsudomi (Kindai University) and 451Lu cells from J. Villanueva (The Wistar Institute). 
All cell lines were authenticated by STR profiling (Promega) and routinely tested for 
mycoplasma contamination. All cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 9% 
fetal bovine serum (Sigma), plus 100 units per ml penicillin and 0.1 mg ml–1 streptomycin 
(Gibco). To generate BRAFi or BRAFi + MEKi-resistant cells, parental drug-sensitive cells 
were exposed to increasing concentrations of BRAFi dabrafenib (from 0.01 µM to 5 µM) or 
BRAFi dabrafenib + MEKi trametinib (from 0.01 µM + 0.001 µM to 0.5 µM + 0.05 µM) for 
3–5 months. PLX4720-resistant cells were generated as previously described16. The 
resistance was confirmed by measuring cell viability under drug treatment.
Colony formation assay
Colony formation assays were performed in 12 well plates by seeding 3,000 cells 
(A101DBMR), 10,000 cells (HCC827CLR and all parental drug-sensitive cells), 30,000 cells 
(Mel888BMR), or 50,000 cells (451LuBR, A375BMR, A375BR and D10BR). Medium was 
refreshed twice per week and plates were fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution, stained with

 crystal violet (1% in 50% methanol) and photographed after 10-21 days of treatment (as 
indicated).
Animal studies
Animal work procedures were approved by the animal experimental committee of the NKI 
and performed according to Dutch law. The in vivo experiment was performed with 
A375BMR cells infected with lentivirus encoding sgRNAs. 106 cells were s.c. injected into 
the both flanks of 5-7-week-old female NSG mice. The mice received dabrafenib and 
trametinib by daily oral gavage from the first day of tumor injection onwards until drug 
treatment was stopped. Tumor growth rates were analyzed by measuring tumor length (L) 
and width (W), and calculating volume through the use of the formula LW2/2. Mice were 
not randomized for the experiment. Investigators were not blinded when assessing the 
outcome of the experiment.
Human melanoma specimens
Patient melanoma samples were obtained (following Institutional Review Board approval) 
from the NKI-AVL pathology archive biobank. Informed consent was obtained from all 
patients.
Immunohistochemistry and scoring
AXL staining was performed manually using the following protocol: after deparaffinization 
of FFPE fixed slides using xylene, antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer (pH 
6) in a pressure cooker for 5 minutes. Sections were treated with 0.3% H2O2 to block 
endogenous peroxidase activity and subsequently blocked in 10% human serum in PBS-T 
for 30 minutes. Primary AXL antibody (sc-20471, Santa Cruz) was applied at a 
concentration of 3 µg/ml for 1 hour at room temperature. Detection was performed by an 
anti-rabbit HRP conjugated antibody (Immunologic, Brightvision) and developed using 
AEC and a counterstain of hematoxylin. Slides were manually analyzed by a certified 
pathologist from the VU medical Center (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in a blinded 
fashion. Percentage AXL positive cells was determined by analyzing whole slides of every 
sample. MITF (clone C5/D5, Immunologic) and Melan-A and GP100 (ab732, Abcam) 
stainings in mouse xenograft tumors were performed with the protocol described above with 
minor modifications (block with goat serum and develop with DAB).
Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed as previously described16. The following antibodies were 
used: pERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204, 9106), ERK1/2 (9102), pMEK1/2 (Ser217/221, 9154), 
MEK1/2 (4694), MEK1 (2352), MEK2 (9147), JUNB (3753), pFRA1 (Ser265, 5841), p-
cJUN (Ser73, 3270) and cJUN (2315) BCL2 (4223) from Cell Signaling Technology; 
BRAFV600E (E19290) from Spring Bioscience; ATK (sc-8312), pAKT (Ser473, sc-7985-R), 
FRA1 (sc-28310), BRAF (sc-5284), BCL2 (sc-492) and HSP90 (sc-7947) from Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology; MITF (ab12039) and AXL (ab89224) from Abcam; Melan-A (M7196) from 
Dako; E-Cadherin (610181), Vimentin (550513) and Fibronectin (610077) from BD 
Bioscience.

 Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
Preparation of metaphase chromosome spreads from A375 and A375BMR cells was 
performed as described previously27. Two-color metaphase FISH was performed using a 
BRAF probe (7q34 BRAF-CN RD, G100368R-8, Agilent) and a probe located on the 
chromosome 7 centromere (Chr7 CEP GR, G100527G-8, Agilent) according to the 
manufacturer's protocol.
PCR, Sanger sequencing, cloning and lentivirus production
All primer sequences are listed in Supplementary table 2. For identification of BRAF 
amplification in A375BMR cell, genomic DNA was isolated and quantitative PCR was 
performed with primers amplifying BRAF, CRAF and LINE. For identification of the 
MEK1 mutation in 451LuBR cells, genomic DNA was isolated and MEK1 exon 2 was 
cloned into the TOPO TA-cloning vector (450071, Invitrogen), which was followed by 
Sanger sequencing. The presence of BRAFV600E/DK in Mel888BMR cell was identified as 
previously described9. Cloning of sgRNAs into LentiCRISPRv2 vector was performed as 
described (http://www.genome-engineering.org/crispr/). Briefly, the LentiCRISPRv2 
plasmid was digested with BsmBI and gel-purified. DNA oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) were 
annealed and ligated into the digested vector. Target sgRNA oligonucleotide sequences are 
listed in Supplementary table 2. The plasmid encoding the MITF-M isoform was previously 
described16. Production of lentivirus was performed as described previously28.
Transwell Migration assay
To examine the migration potential, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 
MAPKi for 1 day followed by seeding 200,000 cells in the top chambers of a transwell 
(3422, Corning) in serum-free medium with or without inhibitors. The lower compartment 
contained medium supplemented with 9% fetal bovine serum as a chemoattractant. Cells 
were incubated for 8 (A101DBMR) or 24 (451LuBR) hours and cells that did not migrate 
through the pores were removed by a cotton swab. Filters were fixed in 4% formaldehyde 
solution, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, photographed and cells numbers were counted.
RNA sequencing analysis
RNA was isolated using Trizol, and cDNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina 
HiSeq2000 to obtain 65 bp single-end sequence reads. Reads were aligned to the GRCh38 
human reference genome using Tophat (2.1.0), and gene counts were obtained using HTSeq-
count. All downstream analyses were performed in R using the Bioconductor framework. 
DESeq2 rlog-values were used for visualization of gene expression levels in heat maps. Heat 
maps represent mean rlog-values of two independent biological replicate experiments. 
Clustering was performed using default settings of the heatmap.2 function in the gplots 
package. For Extended Data Fig. 5a, gene-wise scaling was applied to rlog-values, and the 
200 most variable are represented. For Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 7a, b, rlog-values 
were mean normalized on a gene-wise basis. For gene set enrichment analyses, counts per 
million (cpm) were used as input. For Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5b, time points were 
converted to a ranking score (0, 1, 2 or 3 for time points 0, 6, 24 or 48 h of A375BMR and 0, 
1, 3 or 5 days of 451LuBR, respectively); for Extended Data Fig. 7c, the extent of rescue

 from cell death was converted to a ranking score (1, 2, 3, or 4 for Mel888BMR cells 
expressing sgCtrl, sgJUNB, or sgERK2 in the context of drug removal, and Mel888BMR 
cells with treatment, respectively). Pre-ranked gene lists were created by correlating these 
ranking scores with gene expression using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 
metric. Phenotype switching and MITF target gene lists were obtained from http://
www.jurmo.ch/work_mitf.php. The TEAD and AP1 signatures were taken from Verfaillie et 
al.14, and the JUNB signature was derived from supplemental table 3A of Fontana et al.29, 
where human homologs of mouse genes were derived using the biomaRt package. Analyses 
were performed using javaGSEA30, and replotted from the output of this tool using the 
replotGSEA function (https://github.com/PeeperLab/Rtoolbox).
