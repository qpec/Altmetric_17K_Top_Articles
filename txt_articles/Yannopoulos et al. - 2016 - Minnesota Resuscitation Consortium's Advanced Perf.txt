Background-—In 2015, the Minnesota Resuscitation Consortium (MRC) implemented an advanced perfusion and reperfusion life
support strategy designed to improve outcome for patients with out-of-hospital refractory ventricular fibrillation/ventricular
tachycardia (VF/VT). We report the outcomes of the initial 3-month period of operations.
Methods and Results-—Three emergency medical services systems serving the Minneapolis–St. Paul metro area participated in
the protocol. Inclusion criteria included age 18 to 75 years, body habitus accommodating automated Lund University Cardiac
Arrest System (LUCAS) cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and estimated transfer time from the scene to the cardiac
catheterization laboratory of ≤30 minutes. Exclusion criteria included known terminal illness, Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate
status, traumatic arrest, and significant bleeding. Refractory VF/VT arrest was defined as failure to achieve sustained return of
spontaneous circulation after treatment with 3 direct current shocks and administration of 300 mg of intravenous/intraosseous
amiodarone. Patients were transported to the University of Minnesota, where emergent advanced perfusion strategies
(extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; ECMO), followed by coronary angiography and primary coronary intervention (PCI), were
performed, when appropriate. Over the first 3 months of the protocol, 27 patients were transported with ongoing mechanical CPR.
Of these, 18 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. ECMO was placed in 83%. Seventy-eight percent of patients had
significant coronary artery disease with a high degree of complexity and 67% received PCI. Seventy-eight percent of patients
survived to hospital admission and 55% (10 of 18) survived to hospital discharge, with 50% (9 of 18) achieving good neurological
function (cerebral performance categories 1 and 2). No significant ECMO-related complications were encountered.
Conclusions-—The MRC refractory VF/VT protocol is feasible and led to a high functionally favorable survival rate with few
complications. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e003732 doi: 10.1161/JAHA.116.003732)

 declared dead. In Minnesota, the efforts for VF patients are
typically discontinued if ROSC is not achieved after 45 min-
utes.3
Patients resuscitated from VF/VT cardiac arrest have a
high prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and are
likely to have an underlying reversible cause for their cardiac
arrest.4 When taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory,
more than half receive revascularization with primary coronary
intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)
regardless of the presence or absence of ST elevation in the
postresuscitation electrocardiogram (ECG).5 We hypothesized
that patients with VF/VT cardiac arrest, refractory to initial
resuscitation efforts, would have an even higher prevalence of
significant CAD and that their disease would be more
complicated.
Recently developed capabilities now make it feasible to
potentially reverse causative coronary artery ischemia in
patients with refractory VF/VT. Manual cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) precludes patient transport because of
risk to unrestrained EMS personnel providing necessary care
in the back of a rapidly moving ambulance. However,
mechanical CPR alleviates this barrier to patient transport,
while providing excellent cardiac and cerebral perfusion and
allowing provision of other ongoing care.6 Another advance
has been the demonstrated feasibility of performing PCI with
ongoing mechanical CPR or, alternatively, placement of
emergent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO),
rapidly establishing perfusion, followed by PCI.7,8 Applying
these advances in a coordinated and effective way, for the
first time, provides the potential for a reasonable expectation
of achieving a higher rate of functionally favorable survival in a
patient population with a very high mortality.
The purpose of this article is to describe the first protocol in
the United States using advanced perfusion and reperfusion life
support strategies designed to improve outcomes for patients
with out-of-hospital refractory VF/VT, evaluate initial 3-months
results, and determine the feasibility of this approach.
Methods
Study Design
This is an analysis of 27 consecutive patients that were
enrolled in the Minnesota Resuscitation Consortium (MRC)
refractory VT/VF protocol at the University of Minnesota
(Minneapolis, MN) from December 1, 2015 through February
29, 2016. The clinical protocol was implemented as part of
our clinical practice, and data collection was part of the
Quality Improvement Project in this population. The Institu-
tional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Minnesota
approved the anonymous data analysis and chart review
extraction for this publication. Informed consent was waived.
Setting
The protocol was implemented with an agreement between
the University of Minnesota Interventional Cardiology Service,
North Memorial, St. Paul Fire, and Ridgeview EMS systems.
During the 3-month period, patients presumed to meet
inclusion criteria were transported directly from the out-of-
hospital setting to the University of Minnesota Medical Center
with facilitated transfer to the cardiac catheterization labora-
tory. A total of 27 patients were transferred with ongoing
mechanical CPR during this period.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was functionally favorable survival to
hospital discharge (cerebral performance categories [CPCs] 1
and 2). Secondary outcomes were 1-month survival, 1-month
neurological function (CPC 1 or 2), and protocol-based
complications.
Historical Context and Protocol
Four years ago, the MRC established a protocol to provide
early cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) activation and
intervention (within 4 hours) to all OHCA VF/VT patients that
achieved ROSC. Fifty-two percent underwent PCI and 7%
underwent CABG regardless of the presence or absence of ST
elevation on 12-lead ECG.5 Given the high prevalence of
significant CAD in this population, the MRC hypothesized that
the burden of CAD in patients with refractory VF/VT would be
higher. Furthermore, early out-of-hospital transport using
advanced perfusion/circulatory support with mechanical CPR
followed by ECMO might be beneficial by stabilizing perfusion,
allowing coronary angiography and PCI to reverse causative
coronary artery ischemia and improve functionally favorable
survival. Accordingly, Dr Yannopoulos (interventional cardiol-
ogist) and Drs Conterato, Sipprell, and Frascone (EMS
directors) collaboratively developed the MRC refractory VF/
VT protocol, trained all paramedic units (North Memorial and
Ridgeview EMS) and fire fighter/paramedics units (St. Paul
Fire EMS), and widely disseminated this information to the
medical community. The first patient arrived at the University
of Minnesota CCL on December 2, 2015.

 5. Received amiodarone 300 mg.
6. Body could accommodate a Lund University Cardiac Arrest
System (LUCAS) automated CPR device.
7. Transfer time from the scene to the CCL of <30 minutes.
Exclusion criteria for early mobilization (presence of 1
would exclude the patient)
1. ROSC before 3 shocks were delivered (transferred to
nearest hospital).
2. Nursing home residents.
3. Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate.
4. Known terminal illness, (eg, cancer, end-stage liver, kidney,
or heart disease)
5. Traumatic arrest
6. Pulseless electrical activity and asystole
7. Significant bleeding
8. Manual CPR as the only option.
Mobilization Process and Protocol Activation
The process for activation of the refractory VF/VT protocol was
simplified to a single phone call from the dispatch center to a
24/7 on-call interventional cardiologist (D.Y., G.R., and J.B.).
The cardiologist then activates the on-call CCL perfusion teams
and intensive care unit charge nurse by a central paging system
and directly calls the emergency department. During regular
working hours, patients bypass the emergency department for
direct admission to the CCL. During off hours, patients are held
in the emergency department where resuscitation efforts are
continued until arrival of the catheterization laboratory team.
Refractory VF/VT
The definition of refractory VF/VT (failure to achieve sus-
tained ROSC after treatment with 3 DC shocks and admin-
istration of 300 mg of intravenous/intraosseous [IV/IO]
amiodarone) represents the timing of initiation of EMS
transport and is fundamental to the success of the protocol.
The definition of refractory VF/VT was chosen as a cutpoint
along a theoretical continuum of failed response to standard
care. If the decision to transport occurs too late along this
continuum, early CCL activation and treatment may not offer
benefit. If transport occurs too early, selection of prompt
responders to treatment will occur, resulting in unnecessary
mobilization of resources. For these reasons, the MRC chose
a cutpoint that provides multiple defibrillation attempts,
epinephrine, administration of intravenous antiarrythmics,
followed by defibrillation with no response. Retrospective
MRC data indicated that the probability of functionally
favorable survival at this point is low (�8.2%). Thus, the
definition of refractory VT/VF provides identification of a
cardiac arrest patient population with a low likelihood for
survival at an early enough time during resuscitation efforts to
potentially benefit from the protocol intervention.
Cardiac Catheterization Process, ECMO, and
Angiography/PCI Protocol
On arrival in the CCL, ongoing LUCAS plus impedance
threshold device (ITD) CPR continues. Emergency cannulation
of the femoral vessels with a 15 to 19 French (Fr) arterial
cannula and a 25 Fr venous cannula is performed with
percutaneous technique and ultrasound guidance. For a
detailed procedural guide, see Figure 1. An initial descending
aortic angiogram is obtained to assess the ability of the femoral
vessels to accommodate the size of the ECMO cannulas. In
cases where the femoral vasculature cannot accommodate the
ECMO cannulas, additional hemodynamic support is achieved
by placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) triggered
by the aortic pressure generated by the LUCAS device. ECMO
candidates are connected to the preprimed Cardiohelp circuit
consisting of a centrifugal pump (Maquet Rotaflo; Maquet
Cardiovascular, Wayne, NJ). Interventional cardiologists place
all devices. Once hemodynamic/perfusion support is achieved,
coronary angiography is performed and revascularization
accomplished based on the clinical judgment of the interven-
tional cardiologist. The CCL circulatory support decision-
making protocol is seen in Figure 1.
Postresuscitation Protocol
Patients received therapeutic hypothermia (TH) by standard
protocol. All patients that arrived to the CCL with ongoing CPR
were effectively at target temperature of TH with the majority
being 34°C. The temperature was increased to 35°C if they
developed bleeding complications and then maintained at that
temperature with ECMO thermoregulation for 24 hours. All
patients received a baseline head computerized tomography
(CT) radiograph and admission to the cardiac intensive
care unit (CICU) under the care of interventional cardiology.
A multidisciplinary team of heart failure, critical care, and
neurocritical care physicians as well as social and religious
services also provided continuous expertise to patients and
families. To achieve continuity of care, one attending (inter-
ventional cardiology) made all final decisions.
Data Collection
Current protocol
Following IRB approval, data were placed into a REDCap
database. Individual chart reviews of all the laboratory and
imaging studies were imported and analyzed as mean and
SDs. Source of information for out-of-hospital data included

 immediate verbal report from the paramedics, review of out-
of-hospital records, or through the CARES database.
Historical controls
In order to provide historical perspective for comparison, we
collected data from January 1, 2013 through December 31,
2014 from the same 3 participating EMS in the identical
cardiac arrest population. All data are documented, recorded,
and kept in a single CARES database at the University of
Minnesota MRC office. Data included used the same criteria
as the MRC refractory VF/VT protocol:
1. OHCA with presumed cardiac etiology.
2. First presenting rhythm of VF/VT.
3. 18 to 75 years of age.
4. Did not have ROSC before IV/IO amiodarone 300 mg.
We included all patients that had achieved ROSC anytime
after amiodarone was given and their arrival to the emergency
department as well as everyone that never had ROSC at any
point. We identified 170 patients that met these criteria.
Survival to hospital discharge with CPC 1 or 2 were recorded
and were used as historical perspective.
Database Management and Statistical Analysis
All relevant information was entered in a REDCap database
and exported to an Excel format for biostatistical analysis.
For comparisons of characteristics between patients that
survived and those that died, a t test and Fisher’s exact test
were used. A single, not adjusted comparison was performed
between our cohort and historical controls with a Fisher’s
exact test.

 Results
Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The majority
were white males with a mean age of 56 years. Prearrest
comorbidities were known in a small percentage of patients
and are shown in Table 1.
Cardiac arrest and CCL characteristics are shown in
Table 2. The cardiac arrest location was most frequently a
public place. All patients presented with VF/VT and 66%
received bystander CPR. Average time from 911 call to CCL
arrival was �1 hour. The mean time required to initiate ECMO
was 6 minutes from their arrival to the CCL (Table 2).
Survival to Hospital Discharge With CPC 1 and 2
The patient flow diagram is shown in Figure 2. Of 27
transported patients, 9 did not meet inclusion criteria. Five
were initially in nonshockable rhythms and were misclassified
by paramedics at the scene. An additional 2 received manual
CPR only, 1 arrived in the CCL >90 minutes following initial
transport, and 1 had terminal cancer (Figure 2). Of the 18
patients that met inclusion criteria, 15 were supported with
ECMO and 3 had PCI performed with ongoing LUCAS plus ITD
CPR and IABP hemodynamic support. ROSC was achieved in
14 of 18 (78%) patients who were admitted to the CICU.
Overall, survival to hospital discharge occurred in 10 of 18
(53%) and survival to hospital discharge with CPC 1 or 2
occurred in 9 of 18 (50%). Following hospital discharge, all
surviving patients required admission to a rehabilitation
facility. All 10 patients were alive 1 month after discharge.
Of these, 9 of 10 (90%) had CPC 1 or 2 at 1 month. One
patient discharged with CPC 3 was CPC 3 at 1 month
(Figure 2).
ECMO Characteristics
In the 15 patients that were hemodynamically supported with
ECMO, the average time from 911 call to ECMO support was
66.4�9 minutes (range, 38–76). ECMO support was estab-
lished within 6�1.2 minutes of arrival to the CCL. Of the
patients on ECMO admitted to the CICU who survived,
average time to decannulation was 52�21 hours. All but 3
patients had ongoing CPR upon arrival to the CCL. Two of the
3 patients with pulses were hypotensive and in cardiogenic
shock requiring ECMO initiation. The third patient had
placement of IABP for hemodynamic support. The cardiovas-
cular surgery team performed all ECMO decannulations.

 Coronary Anatomy
Fourteen of the 18 patients had significant CAD and PCI was
performed in 12 patients. Mean Syntax Score was 36�11.
Single-vessel disease was present in 4 of 18 (22%) patients
and 2 or more vessel diseases were present in 10 of 18 (56%).
Of the 12 patients receiving PCI, the mean number of stents
placed per patient was 4�2.
Cardiac Function and Troponin I Levels After
ROSC
Patients had a daily echocardiogram. When on ECMO, left
ventricular function assessment was performed with turn-
down of the ECMO support to the minimum tolerated
hemodynamically. The temporal evolution of left ventricular
function from the first day until discharge can be seen in
Figure 3.
Cardiac troponins were not detectable at presentation in
the majority of cases. Troponin I peak over 100 U/mL was
noticed within 16 hours in the majority of cases (Figure 4),
highlighting the role of myocardial ischemia/injury in the
pathogenesis of OHCA.
ECMO-Related Complications
None of the following ECMO-related complications were
observed: intracranial bleeding, stroke, leg ischemia, or
infectious
complications
from
the
indwelling
lines.
We
recorded no vascular complications from ECMO placement.
There were 2 patients that had moderate bleeding around
the arterial cannula, in part attributed to the presence of
anticoagulation (heparin), dual antiplatelet therapy and Epti-
fibatide infusion due to high coronary thrombus burden.
Patients were managed by decreasing the activated clotting
time goal to <180 seconds.
Because of the high prevalence of infections in postcardiac
arrest patients, all patients were treated with a 5-day course
of broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/
tazobactam) beginning at CICU admission.9,10 Despite that,
10 patients developed fever and were diagnosed with
pneumonia. All were successfully treated with intravenous
and oral antibiotics. Two patients developed deep venous
thrombosis, 1 on the left arm and 1 on the opposite leg from
the ECMO cannulation site. They were successfully treated
with anticoagulants.
Neurological Dysfunction and Brain Death
Three patients had imaging evidence of severe anoxic brain
injury on the admission CT. One of these patients developed
central herniation within 6 hours despite medical therapy. The
second patient had a neurological exam consistent with brain
death and a cerebral perfusion scan showing no uptake by the
brain leading to discontinuation of supportive therapies. The
third patient suffered catastrophic bowel infarct late in his
hospitalization as a complication from heparin-induced throm-
bocytopenia with thrombosis. Two of the 3 patients became
organ donors. One of the patients survived with neurological
dysfunction (CPC=3). The patient had receptive aphasia and is
still recovering.
Survivor Characteristics
Patients that survived had significant differences in their
resuscitation process and cause of the arrest. The following
factors were significantly associated with survival to hospital
discharge: (1) the presence of bystander CPR; (2) earlier arrival
of first responders after the 911 call; (3) earlier arrival to the
CCL; (4) lower lactic acid on initial blood gases in the CCL; and
(5) the presence of CAD as a reversible cause. The absence of
identification of an obvious reversible cause, such as CAD or
pulmonary embolism, was associated with bad outcome. Only 1

 patient without an identifiable reversible cause had return of
spontaneous cardiac function and was admitted to the CICU.
That patient survived with moderate neurological dysfunction
(CPC=3). Characteristics associated with better outcomes
could be summarized as: (1) rapid EMS response time and
shorter time from 911 call to delivery to the CCL; (2) bystander
CPR; and (3) evidence of reversible CAD (Table 3).
Historical Perspective
We identified 170 patients with the same criteria as our
refractory VF/VT protocol population treated by the same
EMS systems. Average age was 56�7 years, 74.6% were
males, and 77% were white. Of those, 63% of the arrests
happened in a public place and 61% had bystander CPR.
Survival to hospital discharge with CPC 1 or 2 was found to be
14 of 170 (8.2% compared to 9 of 18 [50%] from the MRC
refractory VF/VT protocol; P<0.0001).
Discussion
Our initial 3-month experience with the MRC refractory VF/VT
protocol shows, for the first time, that an organized approach to
treat refractory out-of-hospital VF/VT, capitalizing on advanced
perfusion and reperfusion strategies, is feasible and can result
in a significant rate of functionally favorable survival to hospital
discharge. This preliminary experience reports an overall rate of
53% survival to hospital discharge and a 50% rate of functionally
favorable survival to hospital discharge.
With 3 months of experience, our cohort is the largest
refractory VF/VT series that has been reported on in the
United States. The SAVE-J trial, performed in Japan, was a
prospective, observational study comparing 454 patients with
Figure 3. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) temporal evolution in patients that were admitted after
refractory ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia arrest. A 2-day period of severe left ventricular
depression was evident in the whole cohort. Recovery was observed after 3 days. Values are shown as

 VT/VF arrest admitted to 46 hospitals over 3 years.11 Of
these, 234 patients were provided extracorporeal CPR (ECPR).
Patients received ECPR if they were admitted to an ECPR-
capable center whereas patients admitted to non-ECPR
centers received standard therapy. Patients receiving ECPR
demonstrated a significant improvement in neurologically
intact survival (CPC 1 and 2) at 1 month with 13.7% in the
per-protocol group compared to 1.9% in the non-ECPR group.
Overall 1-month survival was also improved in the ECPR group
with 29% versus 6% in the non-ECPR group. Johnson et al.
reported 26 cases over a 7-year period with only 42% of those
patients presenting with VF/VT.12 Wang et al. described a
very large cohort of 220 patients receiving ECPR over a period
of 5 years, of whom only 31 where OHCA patients. Of those,
only 15 had VF/VT as the presenting rhythm.13 Stub et al., in
the CHEER trial, enrolled 11 patients with OHCA and all
presented with VF. Of the 9 patients that were placed on
ECMO, 3 survived (33% survival rate).14
In all studies12–14 previously reported, ECMO cannulation
was performed in the emergency department. Vascular and
bleeding complication rates were significantly higher than the
present study, although the SAVE-J did not report complica-
tion rates. In those studies, vascular complications ranged
from 45% to 65% and bleeding was in the same range in all
three cohorts.12–14 We reported no ECMO-related vascular
complications, no life-threatening EMCO complications, and
lower bleeding complications rates. We believe that one of the
fundamental differences in our protocol is that only 3
experienced interventional cardiologists and high-volume
operators performed all the procedures after extensive
training with pre-established protocols for vascular access,
including ultrasound guidance and precannulation angiogra-
phy of the iliofemoral vessels.
An important finding in our cohort of patients was that the
left ventricle was severely depressed immediately after the
prolonged resuscitation period. Cardiac function returned
soon after ECMO was established in the majority of the
patients, but 3 to 4 hours later left ventricular (LV) ejection
fraction (LVEF) was again severely compromised. Cardiac
function was severely depressed for an average of 3 days, at
which point a progressive recovery was observed in the
majority of patients continuing until the day of discharge
(Figure 3). This phenomenon is well described in animal
models of cardiac arrest and resuscitation. In those studies,
animals that had achieved ROSC had a significant decrease in
LVEF to less than 35% within the first 4 hours and recovered
slightly within 24 hours.15,16 The same has been reported for
resuscitated patients with prehospital ROSC.17,18 Our data are
a significant addition to the literature because of the severity
of LV dysfunction being present in this population that,
without circulatory support, would be extremely difficult to be
successfully treated in the coronary care unit. The level of
troponin elevation in this population further reflects the
severity of myocardial injury. The absence of early troponin
elevation in the majority of patients suggests that troponin
may not be a useful diagnostic tool to emergently diagnose
CAD as the cause of cardiac arrest in this patient population.
The characteristics of our MRC protocol are unique in that
they evolved as a result of strong, multidisciplinary, commu-
nity-wide collaboration with input from interventional cardiol-
ogy, emergency medicine, and out-of-hospital EMS providers.
There are 4 critical and unique components to our protocol:
(1) early mobilization of patients who, after at least 3
attempted defibrillations and amiodarone, still have not
achieved ROSC; (2) simplification of the hospital activation
process through a single telephone call from EMS dispatch;
(3) a core group of interventional cardiologists for placement
of preprimed percutaneous ECMO to achieve consistency of
vascular access and limitation of complications; and (4) a
multidisciplinary hospital care team with broad cross-specialty
interactions to comprehensively address the medical, psy-
chosocial, and emotional issues for both patients and families.
We believe that steps 1 and 2 are critical to identify patients
most likely to benefit and then expedite access to the CCL to
implement these potentially life-saving technologies as rapidly

Better outcomes were associated with three main characteristics: (1) rapid EMS
response time and shorter time from 911 call to delivery to the CCL; (2) bystander CPR;
and (3) evidence of reversible coronary artery disease. ABG indicates arterial blood gas;
CCL, cardiac catheterization laboratory; CPC, cerebral performance category; CPR,
cardiopulmonary resuscitation; ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; ETCO2,
end-tidal CO2; ROSC, return of spontaneous circulation; VF/VT, ventricular fibrillation/
ventricular tachycardia.

 as possible. These are further reinforced by the characteris-
tics we found associated with functionally favorable survivors:
(1) rapid EMS response time and shorter time from 911 call to
delivery to the CCL; (2) bystander CPR; and (3) evidence of
reversible CAD.
The presence of CAD was very prevalent in this cohort. The
majority of cases had high disease burden with multivessel
disease and complicated lesions. Interventions therefore were
not easy to perform with ongoing CPR. Circulatory support
provided by ECMO gave the operator the freedom to intervene
in much more severe disease than would otherwise have been
possible.
Thus, selection of patients most likely to benefit, provision of
advanced hemodynamic support with mechanical LUCAS plus
ITD CPR, early and rapid transport to the CCL, hemodynamic
support with rapid placement of ECMO, and identification and
intervention in causative, complex CAD appear to have formed
the basis for the success of this initial experience.
Limitations
We report functionally favorable survival rates in patients with
refractory VF/VT cardiac arrest from a single, high-volume
resuscitation center that may be difficult to replicate in other
centers. By definition, this initial 3-month experience reports
on a small cohort of patients. Functionally favorable survival
rates may increase or decrease with broader experience. As
with any clinical protocol registry, selection bias cannot be
excluded. Nonetheless, no patient meeting criteria for the
protocol was missed from inclusion during the reported period.
EMS providers initially “overtransported” patients with 100%
sensitivity in case selection, but only 65% specificity. This is
being addressed in ongoing system-wide EMS quality improve-
ment processes. One patient (6%) survived to hospital
discharge with CPC >2. Investigators recognize the issue of
increasing survival with poor neurological outcome as an
important issue with this approach. Nonetheless, survival with
poor neurological outcome also occurs with standard resusci-
tation practice. A larger experience/patient cohort, compar-
ison with outcome from standard resuscitation practice, and
weight in relation to any improvement in functionally favorable
survival requires careful monitoring as greater experience is
realized with this approach. Only a randomized, clinical trial
could eliminate potential selection bias and provide compar-
ative outcome data with standard resuscitation practice to
definitively determine the benefits and risks of this approach.
Conclusions
The MRC refractory VF/VT protocol is feasible and led to a high
functionally favorable survival rate with few complications.
