Abstract
Background: Waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS) is increasing
in popularity despite evidence of harm and potential for depen-
dence. Intervention development has been hampered by a lack of
longitudinal, nationally representative data on usage patterns and
factors independently associated with WTS initiation. Therefore,
we aimed to characterize key transitions between WTS states in a
nationally representative group of young adults, with particular
attention to factors independently associated with initiation.
Methods: Participants were randomly selected from a national
probability-based panel representing 97% of the United States.
A total of 1,785 adults ages 18 to 30 at baseline completed two
Web-based surveys 18 months apart in 2013 and 2014. Assess-
ments included knowledge of waterpipe tobacco smoke compo-
sition, positive and negative attitudes toward WTS, normative
beliefs, intention to use waterpipe, and WTS behavior. We used
multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between
predictive factors and subsequent WTS initiation.
Results: In fully adjusted models, overall knowledge about
toxicants associated with WTS was not associated with subse-
quent WTS initiation. Similarly, negative attitudes and norma-
tive beliefs were not associated with WTS uptake. However,
baseline positive attitudes were strongly and significantly asso-
ciated with WTS initiation [adjusted OR (AOR) ¼ 1.7; 95%
confidence interval (CI), 1.2–2.3]. Similarly, baseline intention
to use WTS was strongly associated with subsequent initiation
(AOR ¼ 7.0; 95% CI, 3.5–13.7).
Conclusions: Prevention efforts may be most successful if they
target individuals with clear intentions to use WTS and challenge
positive attitudes surrounding WTS.
Impact: Surveillance of WTS trajectories will help inform health
care and policy surrounding this emerging risk behavior among U.
S. young adults. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(5); 748–55. �2017

Introduction
As traditional cigarette smoking rates decrease in the United
States (1), rates of new and emerging tobacco and nicotine
product use have been steadily increasing (2). This includes
waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS, or "hookah"), which is increas-
ingly popular among adolescent and young adult populations
(3, 4). Although the FDA declared its intention to regulate WTS
starting on August 8, 2016 (5), WTS remains exempt from many
tobacco control policies (6). Moreover, the popular perception
remains that WTS is a fun, relaxing, social activity with few
negative associations and repercussions (7, 8). These beliefs and
attitudes are concerning given our increasing understanding of the
association of WTS with negative health effects, such as cancer,
cardiovascular disease, and decreased pulmonary function (9),
and potential for dependence (10).
There are three major gaps in the literature that hinder our
ability to optimally intervene in this area. First, little is known
regarding transitions between various WTS usage states over time.
For example, although current cigarette smokers (usually defined
as having use at least once in the past 30 days; ref. 11) tend to
remain current users, these patterns have not been established
regarding WTS. It would be valuable to obtain a more nuanced
picture of transitions between various stages of WTS to tailor
interventions in terms of timing. Related to this, it will be
beneficial to conduct longitudinal studies with longer follow-up
periods than have been conducted in the past. To our knowledge,
the highest quality longitudinal study was conducted over 6
months (12).
Second, there is a need for better understanding of initiation
of WTS, which is generally defined as the transition from never
use to ever use. Rates of WTS initiation among U.S. late
adolescents and young adults are between 13% and 23%, and
factors associated with WTS initiation are not clearly under-
stood (13–15). One established factor that has been clearly
associated with WTS initiation is other substance use at base-
line; these associations are well-grounded in theory, and the
empiric evidence base is strong (12, 15). However, what is not
established is whether there are associations between baseline
theory-based perceptual predictors, such as knowledge, attitudes,
normative beliefs, and intentions, and subsequent initiation, as

 would be predicted by relevant conceptual models (16). For
example, some prior research suggests negative attitudes toward
WTS protect against WTS initiation (13), whereas other studies
suggest there may be more influence for positive attitudes and
normative beliefs (12,13). Likewise, studies examiningknowledge
of the harmful components of waterpipe tobacco and effects on
WTS are inconclusive (13, 17). It will be important to elucidate
associations between these types of predictive factors and initia-
tion, because this will directly influence subsequent educational
and policy initiatives.
Third, it is now important to conduct high-quality studies of
WTS with large, nationally representative samples that include a
broad cohort of emerging adults. Although research to date has
been extremely valuable, the vast majority of it has been localized
with limited external generalizability. In addition, emerging
adulthood is increasingly recognized as a crucial time for the
development and consolidation of lifelong habits and addictions
(18). Although many studies have involved emerging adults, they
have focused on college students (13, 14). Even though it is
important to understand use among college students, it is also
important to address these behaviors in emerging adults not in
college, especially considering that other tobacco use is higher in
noncollege young adults than their collegiate counterparts (19).
Therefore, we conducted a nationally representative longitudi-
nal study of U.S. young adults over an 18-month period. We
attempted to fill the specific gaps in the literature noted above by
focusing on two key, specific aims. First, we aimed to characterize
key transitions between WTS states (e.g., never use, ever use, and
current use). Second, we aimed to assess independent associa-
tions between key predictors, such as knowledge, negative and
positive attitudes, normative beliefs, and intentions and sub-
sequent WTS initiation. On the basis of prior work in this area,
we developed five a priori hypotheses: (i) Positive attitudes
toward WTS will be associated with increased odds of WTS
initiation; (ii) negative attitudes toward WTS will be associated
with decreased odds of WTS initiation; (iii) favorable norma-
tive beliefs about WTS will be associated with increased odds of
initiation; (iv) intention will be associated with increased odds
of WTS initiation; and (v) WTS knowledge will be associated
with WTS initiation.
Materials and Methods
Participants and procedures
Participants were members of KnowledgePanel, an online,
non-volunteer access panel recruited and maintained by GfK
(Growth from Knowledge, formerly Knowledge Networks). This
panel was developed through both random digit dialing and
address-based recruitment and was designed to be demograph-
ically representative of the U.S. population (20). At the time of the
study, KnowledgePanel consisted of approximately 50,000 indi-
viduals ages 18 and older (20). Panel members are randomly
selected to be invited to participate in online surveys and are
supplied with e-mail addresses, computers, and Internet access if
needed. However, considering the ubiquitous nature of electronic
communications in today's world, facilitated access is rarely
needed (20).
In March 2013, 3,254 panel members completed a baseline
survey about WTS and other health behaviors. Approximately 18
months later, in October 2014, those individuals were invited to
participate in the follow-up survey. Of the 3,254 individuals who
had completed the baseline survey, 2,170 were still on the panel,
878 had left the panel but were still available for contact, and 206
had left the panel and were unable to be contacted. Therefore, the
follow-up survey was sent to the 3,048 individuals with updated
contact information. This study was approved by the University of
Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board, and all study participants
gave informed consent.
Conceptual framework
This study was guided by two relevant and complementary
health behavior theories typically used to explore young adult
substance use: the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and the
Health Belief Model (HBM). Consistent with the TRA, prior
research demonstrates that those with more positive attitudes
toward WTS have greater odds of current WTS, intention for future
WTS, and WTS initiation, whereas those with more negative
attitudes have lower odds of current WTS and WTS initiation
(13, 21). Also consistent with the TRA, in a relatively small,
regional sample, those with more favorable normative beliefs
regarding WTS had greater odds of current WTS and WTS initi-
ation (13, 21). These TRA constructs may in turn affect behavioral
intention, which is believed to be a strong predictor of behavior
(16). Indeed, self-reported intention to use tobacco products,
including waterpipe tobacco, has been found to be an indepen-
dent predictor of cigarette smoking initiation among young
adults (22). The HBM has also been useful in understanding
youth substance use, because increased perceptions related to
severity and susceptibility have been associated with lower sub-
stance use (23). However, constructs such as knowledge that are
part of the HBM have been inconsistently associated with out-
comes related to WTS. For example, although both cross-sectional
and longitudinal studies of college students have found no
association between knowledge of the harmful components of
waterpipe tobacco, a response of "don't know" has been shown to
be protective against current WTS, intention to participate in WTS,
and WTS initiation (13, 17).
Measures
At both baseline and follow-up, we surveyed participants
regarding sociodemographic factors, WTS behavior, and theory-
based predictors, such as knowledge, attitudes, and normative
beliefs. Both the baseline and follow-up questionnaires were
extensively pretested, and median times for completion were
15 and 10 minutes, respectively.
Sociodemographic factors. GfK maintains a database of key demo-
graphic information about panel members, including age, sex,
race/ethnicity, household income, and level of education. To
supplement this information, we included items to assess living
situation and relationship status.
WTS behavior. In the baseline survey, participants were asked to
report on ever, past year, and current (i.e., within the past 30 days)
WTS. Instructions immediately preceding the WTS items specif-
ically instructed participants to answer about smoking tobacco
from a hookah to differentiate from smoking other substances,
such as marijuana. The term "hookah" was used instead of
"waterpipe" for all WTS-related items, because it is the most
common term used in the United States for this device (24). We
used the WTS items to operationalize three key states of WTS.
Never use was defined as answering "no" to the question, "Have

 you ever smoked tobacco from a hookah?" Ever use was defined as
answering "yes" to "Have you ever smoked tobacco from a
hookah?" but answering "0" to "Within the past 30 days, on how
many days did you smoke tobacco from a hookah?" Finally,
current use was defined as smoking tobacco from a hookah at
least 1 day in the past month. Participants were presented with the
same items in the follow-up questionnaire. This information was
used to chart the transitions between the key states of WTS.
Participants who transitioned from never use to ever use or current
use were defined as initiators, whereas those who transitioned
from ever use to current use were defined as progressors.
Theory-based predictors. Attitudes toward WTS were assessed with
a 6-item scale used in previous research studies (13, 21). These
items asked participants whether they believed WTS was attrac-
tive, romantic, fun, relaxing, harmful, and addicting, each on a 5-
point response scale (Definitely No, Probably No, Don't Know,
Probably Yes, Definitely Yes). The four items assessing attitudes
toward positive attributes (attractive, romantic, fun, relaxing)
were grouped to reflect an overall positive attitude summary scale,
whereas the two items assessing attitudes toward negative attri-
butes (harmful, addicting) were grouped to reflect an overall
negative attitude summary scale. A higher score on the positive
attitude scale indicated a favorable attitude toward WTS, whereas
a higher score on the negative attitude scale indicated a less
favorable attitude toward WTS. Both summary scales demonstrat-
ed strong reliability (Cronbach's a ¼ 0.88 and 0.85, respectively).
Normative beliefs were measured in two complementary ways
used in substance use research (13, 21, 25). The first asked
participants to estimate the percentage of people their age that
have ever smoked tobacco from a hookah, and the second asked
participants to indicate how socially acceptable it is for people
their age to smoke tobacco from a hookah. This item included a
4-point response scale ranging from "Very socially acceptable" to
"Not socially acceptable."
WTS intention was assessed through the item, "Do you intend
to smoke tobacco from a hookah at any time in the rest of your
life?" The 4-item response scale for this item asked respondents to
select "Definitely Yes," "Probably Yes," "Probably No," or "Def-
initely No." Consistent with prior research (26), for analysis, any
answer other than "Definitely No" was defined as intention to
participate in WTS.
Knowledge about the harmful components of waterpipe tobac-
co was measured using a set of items asking participants to
compare smoking a single cigarette with a single hookah tobacco
smoking session and estimate which contained more of the
following: tar, nicotine, carcinogens, carbon monoxide, and
heavy metals (13, 17). Although a typical hookah session is
longer than smoking a single cigarette, this wording was used to
be consistent with, and comparable with, other literature on this
topic (13, 27, 28). A 4-item response scale allowed respondents to
choose "Definitely Hookah," "Probably Hookah," "Probably
Cigarettes," or "Definitely Cigarettes." On the basis of established
research (27, 29), an answer of "Definitely Hookah" or "Probably
Hookah" was considered to be correct, whereas an answer of
"Definitely Cigarettes" or "Probably Cigarettes" was considered to
be incorrect. Internal consistency was measured using Cronbach's
a and demonstrated strong reliability among items (a ¼ 0.87).
Analysis. We included all individuals with complete data on the
dependent variable at baseline and follow-up. Because less than
1% were excluded for incomplete data, this is unlikely to have
affected results. We assessed differences in sociodemographic
characteristics between responders and nonresponders using
Rao-c2 tests and Cramer's V. In addition, we calculated simple
frequencies and percentages to characterize use patterns of the
dependent variable from baseline to follow-up. We assessed
associations between independent variables at baseline and our
dependent variable at follow-up using logistic regression, adjust-
ing for a comprehensive set of sociodemographic covariates in
multivariable models. We conducted sensitivity analyses with a
more parsimonious set of covariates to confirm the robustness of
our results. All analyses were conducted using survey weights
provided by GfK to estimate effects for the general U.S. popula-
tion, as well as correct for any under- or oversampling. We defined
statistical significance with a two-tailed a of 0.05. Data were
analyzed using Stata 14 (StataCorp; ref. 30).
Results
Sample characteristics
A total of 1,796 individuals completed the survey (RR ¼
59%). The final sample for analysis consisted of 1,785 indivi-
duals with complete data on WTS items for both baseline and
follow-up. Responders and nonresponders did not significantly
differ on WTS (P ¼ 0.08), age (P ¼ 0.15), sex (P ¼ 0.07), or race/
ethnicity (P ¼ 0.19). Therefore, those with complete data
represented the complete population in terms of basic socio-
demographics. In addition, study-specific survey weights were
applied to all analyses to adjust for nonresponses well as under-
or oversampling.
The weighted age distribution of our sample was approximately
equal, with the largest group of 27 to 30 years (31%). The sample
was 50% female, and just over half of the sample identified as
White, non-Hispanic (57%); followed by Hispanic (22%), Black,
non-Hispanic (13%); and Other (9%). In addition, half of the
sample reported being single (50%), whereas a plurality reported
living with a parent or guardian (40%), earning an income of
$75,000 or greater (47%), and having an education level of high
school or less (43%; data not shown).
WTS behavior
The trajectories of WTS behavior between baseline and follow-
up are depicted in Fig.1. Ofthe baseline neversmokers (n ¼1,232,
69%), 94% remained never smokers at follow-up. Similarly, 96%
of ever smokers at baseline (n ¼ 446, 25%) remained ever smokers
at follow-up (i.e., they did not progress to current smoking). This
is in contrast to baseline current smokers (n ¼ 107, 6%), of whom
17% remained current smokers. Of note were the 4% of baseline
ever smokers that progressed to current smoking at follow-up and
were considered progressors. Inaddition, ofthe 1,232 participants
reporting never WTS at baseline, 7% reported initiation at follow-
up and were considered initiators.
WTS initiation
Sociodemographic characteristics of baseline WTS nonsmokers
(Table 1) are similar and consistent with whole sample character-
istics. In bivariable analyses, we found significant associations
between WTS initiation and race/ethnicity and yearly household
income (Table 1). Those who initiated WTS were more often
White, non-Hispanic individuals with an annual household
income of $30,000 to $74,999.

 1.1–7.0). Overall knowledge was not significantly associated with
WTS initiation. Sensitivity analyses using a more parsimonious set
of covariates yielded consistent findings.
Discussion
In this nationally representative longitudinal study of U.S.
young adults, we found that, over an 18-month period, 4% of
baseline ever smokers progressed to current smoking and that
approximately 7% of baseline never smokers initiated WTS. A
closer examination of WTS initiation found that positive attitudes
toward WTS, knowledge of WTS-related nicotine exposure com-
pared with cigarettes, and baseline WTS intention were signifi-
cantly associated with initiation. In contrast, negative attitudes
toward WTS, normative beliefs toward WTS, and knowledge of
other WTS components were not significantly associated with
WTS initiation.
We also found that the vast majority of baseline never smokers
(94%) and ever smokers (96%) maintained their status at the
18-month follow-up. However, it is notable that the prevalence
of never smoking decreased by 4 percentage points over the
18-month period, whereas ever smoking increased by approxi-
mately 7 percentage points. This suggests that more individuals
are being introduced to WTS in some capacity. In contrast to the
sustained never and ever smoking, the majority of baseline current
smokers (83%) reverted to ever smoking by follow-up. It is
possible that some of these individuals quit WTS over the fol-
low-up period. Indeed, in studies of U.S. waterpipe tobacco users,
many have expressed intention to quit at some point in the future
(31, 32). However, almost 17% of current smokers sustained their
use through the 18-month period, consistent with some interna-
tional studies (3). In addition, 4% of baseline ever smokers
progressed to current smoking over the follow-up period. These
findings suggest a potential for dependence on WTS. Some users
of WTS report feeling "hooked" on WTS (33), and a recent study
found that half of past year WTS users endorsed at least one
dependence item on a 6-item WTS dependence scale (10).
Of the baseline nonsmokers, 7% initiated WTS at follow-up.
Although this initiation rate is lower than in studies focused on
college students, it is similar to the only other study of initiation

 among a more general young adult population (12). A possible
reason for the lower initiation rate in this study is that this sample
was not limited solely to college students. College entry and
progression through the initial years of college have been found
to be associated with WTS (13, 15). Thus, by including noncollege
populations, we may have reduced the number of higher risk
individuals in our sample.
Positive attitudes toward WTS significantly predicted WTS
initiation, whereas negative attitudes did not. The association
between positive attitudes and WTS initiation is consistent
with studies of college students (13). This is not surprising, as
many U.S. waterpipe users view WTS to be a fun activity during
which they can socialize, party, or relax (7). However, the
lack of association between negative attitudes and WTS initi-
ation is contrary to studies that found negative attitudes to be
protective against WTS use or initiation (13, 21). This is akin
to cigarette smokers, for whom negative outcome expectations
of cigarette smoking may not influence the decision to start
smoking (34). It is possible that, similar to some cigarette
smokers, those who participate in WTS may rationalize their
behavior by focusing on the positive aspects of WTS and
modulating the negative aspects (35).
We also found that knowledge about greater nicotine exposure
in WTS compared with cigarettes was associated with higher odds
of smoking initiation. It is possible that individuals who had
already begun to show interest in WTS were more knowledgeable
about this fact than those who had not. Also, it is possible that the
novelty and general positive appeal of WTS outweighs the knowl-
edge of the presence of nicotine. This phenomenon has been
noted among users of other non-cigarette nicotine and tobacco
products, such as e-cigarettes, snus, and nicotine dissolvables
(36). In a series of focus groups, about half of the young adult
participants reported being willing to try the products despite
knowledge of nicotine content and potential negative health
effects, because they were perceived as attractive, modern, and
fun (36).
The strongest association with WTS initiation was baseline
intention. Those individuals who reported that they intended
to smoke tobacco from a hookah at one point in the rest of their
lives had approximately 7 times greater odds of initiating WTS
compared with those who reported no intention to smoke
tobacco from a hookah. This is especially concerning, because,
consistent with other research (22), approximately one quarter
of baseline nonsmokers reported an intention to initiate WTS at
one point in the rest of their lives. Extrapolating this to the
greater population, almost 9 million baseline nonsmokers ages
18 to 30 may have some intention to participate in WTS (2014
estimated U.S. Census population of 57,702,876 � 69% base-
line never smokers � 22% reporting intention; ref. 37). Con-
sidering the strong association between baseline intention to
participate in WTS and subsequent initiation of WTS, it is clear
that this is a ripe opportunity for primary prevention efforts
among this particular age group.
Although certain theory-based predictors, which may be
addressable through intervention, were associated with WTS
initiation, the majority of sociodemographic factors were not.
This suggests that primary prevention efforts to curb WTS initi-
ation in the general 18- to 30-year-old population may be more
effective if they address these theory-based predictors rather than
focusing on any one group of individuals. This is consistent with
recommendations for the college population, which also found
no association between sociodemographic factors and WTS ini-
tiation (13). However, this is in contrast to secondary prevention
efforts addressing current or ever use, for which efforts may be
more beneficial when focused on populations that are younger,
white, and male (38). These findings provide important distinc-
tions that can help guide targeting of interventions for future
research or for the practice of health professionals.
The two strongest predictors of WTS initiation, positive atti-
tudes and intention, may be addressed through similar preven-
tion and intervention means. Despite the associated negative
health effects and potential for addiction, WTS is still viewed as
a fun, attractive social activity. This is especially true in online
advertisements, where WTS is portrayed as social and pleasurable;
however, health warnings or mention of nicotine content are rare
(39). Likewise, studies have shown that the waterpipe tobacco
industry uses questionable marketing and labeling practices, such
as misleading descriptors on packaging and omission of health
effects (40, 41).
This study was limited by its self-report survey design. Bio-
chemical validation was not used to confirm WTS status. How-
ever, participants were assured of the confidentiality of their
answers and had little incentive to be untruthful. This study was
also limited by the fact that, despite having a large sample size,
there was not enough power to fully examine factors associated
with WTS progression (i.e., baseline use followed by increases).
The progression from WTS experimentation to more regular
use is an area that warrants deeper investigation, and future
studies should seek to examine this trajectory specifically by
recruiting a greater volume of baseline experimenters. Another
limitation is the stem used for the knowledge item, which asked
participants to compare their knowledge of toxicant exposure
from a WTS session compared with smoking a single cigarette.
Because a typical WTS session takes longer than smoking a single
cigarette, this item could have confused participants, potentially
leading them to answer incorrectly. In addition, this study exam-
ined the association between WTS initiation and certain theory-
based predictors and did not include information about other
substance use. Future studies may seek to examine both sets of
factors simultaneously. Finally, although this study had a longi-
tudinal design, data collection at more time points over a longer
period would have yielded data that may have been amenable to
more complete longitudinal analysis techniques, such as growth
mixture modeling.
In conclusion, we found that almost 20% of current WTS
users maintained their use through an 18-month follow-up
period. We also found initiation and progression rates of 7%
and 4%, respectively. Initiation was associated with certain
theory-based predictors, such as positive attitudes toward WTS
and intention to participate in WTS, but not most sociodemo-
graphic factors, suggesting specific targets for prevention efforts.
These efforts may be most effective if they counteract positive
attitudes toward WTS and intention to participate in WTS in the
future.
