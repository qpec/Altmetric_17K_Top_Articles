Abstract
Walnuts are composed of a complex array of biologically active
constituents with individual cancer-protective properties. Here,
we assessed the potential benefit of whole walnut consumption in
a mouse tumor bioassay using azoxymethane. In study 1, a
modest reduction (1.3-fold) in tumor numbers was observed in
mice fed a standard diet (AIN-76A) containing 9.4% walnuts
(15% of total fat). In study 2, the effects of walnut supplemen-
tation was tested in the Total Western Diet (TWD). There was a
significant reduction (2.3-fold; P < 0.02) in tumor numbers in
male mice fed TWD containing 7% walnuts (10.5% of total fat).
Higher concentrations of walnuts lacked inhibitory effects, par-
ticularly in female mice, indicating there may be optimal levels of
dietary walnut intake for cancer prevention. Since components of
the Mediterranean diet have been shown to affect the gut micro-
biome, the effects of walnuts were therefore tested in fecal
samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Carcinogen treat-
ment reduced the diversity and richness of the gut microbiome,
especially in male mice, which exhibited lower variability and
greater sensitivity to environmental changes. Analysis of indi-
vidual operational taxonomic units (OTU) identified specific
groups of bacteria associated with carcinogen exposure, walnut
consumption, and/or both variables. Correlation analysis also
identified specific OTU clades that were strongly associated
with the presence and number of tumors. Taken together, our
results indicate that walnuts afford partial protection to the
colon against a potent carcinogenic insult, and this may be due,
in part, to walnut-induced changes to the gut microbiome.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in the United States. Approximately 5% (1 in 18) of men
and women will be diagnosed with this disease during the course
of their lifetime. Several clinical and preclinical studies have
identified risk factors that increase the likelihood for developing
colorectal cancer. For example, obesity and diets high in red meat
and fat are associated with increased risk (1–4). However, the
consumption of nutritive foods, such as those comprising the
Mediterranean diet, has become a popular approach to mitigating
cancer risk (5). The Mediterranean diet is composed mainly of
vegetables, fruits, grains, legumes, olive oil, unsaturated fats, and a
moderate amount of red wine (6). These whole foods contain a
variety of polyphenols and plant bioactive compounds that have
modifying activities against inflammation, tumorigenesis, and
atherogenesis (6). While dietary patterns undoubtedly exert a
powerful effect on the gut microbiome (7), there is accumulating
evidence that among the beneficial effects of the Mediterranean
diet is the ability to positively impact the composition of the gut
microbiota (7, 8).
An important feature of the Mediterranean diet is the consump-
tion of nuts. Nuts contain a large variety of beneficial bioactive
components, including monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and contain only low
amounts of saturated fatty acids (SFA), as well as a number of
phytochemicals (i.e., phenolic antioxidants), dietary fiber, and
minerals (9, 10). PUFAs, including omega-3 fatty acids, reduce
inflammation and have also been shown to lower polyp burden
in animal models of colon cancer (11). Among all the nuts from
the tree nut family, walnuts (Juglans regia) are the most enriched
in PUFAs, with the highest ratio of omega-3:omega-6 (1:4.2).
Walnuts also contain high levels of g-tocopherol, a form of
vitamin E with proven anticancer benefit (9, 12). A number of
studies have identified beneficial effects of walnut consumption
in a variety of diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, neuro-
logic disorders, and cancer (9).
Given the healthful composition of walnuts and the proven
benefit of many of its individual components on cancer signaling
pathways, here we sought to assess the potential benefit of whole
walnut consumption in a well-established primary colon cancer
model. In the present study, we performed 2 in vivo studies using
theorganotropiccolon carcinogen,azoxymethane(AOM;ref.13).
The effects of walnuts on colon carcinogenesis were tested in 2
basal diets, AIN-76A and a recently developed experimental diet
that represents the typical Western dietary pattern, referred to as

 the Total Western Diet (TWD; ref. 14). To gain further insight into
potential mechanisms by which walnuts may affect colon cancer
development, fecal samples were collected to examine diet-
induced changes to the community structure of the microbiome.
Our results demonstrate for the first time that walnut consump-
tion reduces colon tumor development, an effect that is more
pronounced in male mice. Importantly, cancer protection is
associated with significant alterations to the microbial commu-
nity structure, which appeared to be associated with tumor
suppression.
Materials and Methods
Animal treatment
Male and female A/J mice were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory. Whole walnut halves were provided by the California
Walnut Commission. The amount of walnuts added to the diets
was determined on the basis of previous in vivo studies (15, 16). In
Study 1, mice (4 week-old) were fed AIN-76A diet (Harlan
Laboratories, Inc.) supplemented with 0%, 9.4%, 14.1%, or
18.8% of walnuts by weight, which are equivalent to 0%, 15%,
22.5%, or 30.2% of energy from walnuts, respectively. In Study 2,
mice (4 week-old) were fed the TWD (Harlan Laboratories)
supplemented with 0%, 3.5%, 7%, or 14% of walnuts by weight,
which are equivalent to 0%, 5.2%, 10.5%, or 21.4% of energy
from walnuts, respectively. Macronutrient sources and fatty acid
composition of AIN-76A and TWD diets are summarized in
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Contents of the
fat sources were proportionally lowered in each diet to compen-
sate for the addition of walnuts. Walnuts were finely ground and
added to each diet, which were prepared freshly each week. The
diets and drinking water were given ad libitum.
Treatment with AOM and tissue processing
Five-week-old mice received 6 weekly intraperitoneal injections
of AOM (Sigma-Aldrich); the first 3 doses were given at 5 mg/kg of
body weight and the last 3 doses at 10 mg/kg of body weight. This
protocol reduces morbidity and allows animals to adapt to the
treatment. Control mice were injected with vehicle alone (0.9%
NaCl). Ten weeks after the last injection, mice were sacrificed, and
colons were harvested for further analyses. Colons were flushed
immediately with ice-cold PBS and excised longitudinally. Speci-
mens were fixed-flat in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 4 hours
and stored in 70% ethanol. Tissues were Swiss-rolled, paraffin-
embedded, and sectioned at 5-mm thickness. Animal experiments
were conducted after approval by the Animal Care Committee
(ACC/IACUS) and Center for Comparative Medicine (CCM) at
UCHC.
Quantification of lesions
Whole-mount colons were stained with 0.2% methylene blue,
and the number and size of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and tumors
were scored under a dissecting microscope. Colon tumor load per
mouse was determined using tumor diameter to calculate the
spherical tumor volume, V ¼ (4/3) � p � r3.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.
Tissue sections were deparaffinized, antigen-retrieved, blocked,
and incubated with anti-b-catenin (1:100; Sigma-Aldrich), anti-
Ki67 (1:600; Cell Signaling), anti-pStat3 (1:400; Cell Signaling),
or anti-p21 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Sections were
incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with the peroxi-
dase micropolymers (Vector Laboratories Inc.), and signal was
detected using DAB solution (Vector Laboratories). Tissues were
counterstained with hematoxylin. Images were captured using
QCapture PRO software (QImaging).
Mouse colonoscopy
Mouse colonoscopy was performed using a modified Olym-
pus human choledochoscope, consisting of an Olympus Exera
CV-160 camera system with an Olympus CHF B160 camera
unit with an insertion diameter of 3 mm as described previ-
ously (17). Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection
of ketamine/xylazine solution consisting of 0.6-mL ketamine
(100 mg/mL), 0.4-mL xylazine (20 mg/mL), and 4-mL saline,
and the mixture was injected in a volume of about 8 mL/g body
weight, as described earlier (18). To clear intestinal contents,
colons were flushed with sterile Hanks' balanced salt solution
using an 18-G gavage needle inserted to a depth of 4 cm. The tip
of the endoscope was inserted slowly into the colon to a
maximum depth of 4 cm. Number of colon tumors was scored
during the procedure.
Microbiome analyses
Fecal samples were collected from 20-week-old mice and stored
at �80�C immediately after collection for subsequent micro-
biome analysis. Total bacterial DNA was extracted from fecal
samples by using the Power Soil DNA Extraction Kit (MoBio
Laboratories) according to manufacturer's instructions. Bacterial
16S rDNA was amplified using the 27F/534R primer set (27F 50-
AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-30, 534R 50-ATTACCGCGGCTGC-
TGG-30). PCR reactions were performed using the Phusion High-
Fidelity PCR Mastermix (Invitrogen) with the following condi-
tion: 95�C for 2 minutes (1 cycle), 95�C for 20 seconds, 56�C
for 30 seconds, and 72�C for 1 minute (30 cycles). PCR products
were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman
Coulter) according to manufacturer's protocol. DNA sequencing
was conducted on an Illumina Miseq using paired end 300 base
reads according to manufacturer's protocols.
For the analyses, raw reads were filtered according to length
and quality criteria. Filter-pass reads were assembled using Flash
Assembly, for which the minimum overlap requirement is 30-bp
and the maximum mismatch ratio is 10% (19). After assembly,
chimeric sequences were removed using the USEARCH software
on the basis of the UCHIME algorithm (20). Operational tax-
onomic units (OTU) were selected using the de novo OTU
selection protocol with a 97% similarity threshold. Taxonomy
assignments of OTUs were performed by comparing sequences
to RDP classifier (cutoff ¼ 0.5). A total of 548,254 assembled
reads were generated for the 54 samples. On average, 10,153
reads per sample with range from 4,883 to 22,182 were
obtained. To normalize the sequence depth of each sample,
4,883 reads (the minimum sample number of reads) were
randomly picked from each sample for further analysis. The
R-package "Phyloseq" was used for alpha and beta diversity
analysis (21). The `reads' abundance was log-transformed for
comparison between groups.
Statistical analyses
For tumor studies, statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism V software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Data are
shown as mean � SEM. P values were calculated by the Student t

 test or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison
tests where appropriate as indicated in the figure legends. P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. For microbiome analyses,
a 2-sided Student t-test was used for significance testing for
normally distributed variables. The Mann–Whitney U test was
used for significance testing of variables that did not show a
normal distribution. A Spearman correlation test was used for
correlation analysis between gut bacteria and tumor number. The
statistical tests and plotting were done in R with packages "plyr",
"ggplot2."
Results
Effects of walnuts on colon carcinogenesis using a purified diet
(Study 1)
In Study 1, we tested the effects of walnuts added to a purified
diet, AIN-76A, at increasing concentrations of 0%, 9.4%, 14.1%,
and 18.8% by weight on colon carcinogenesis in A/J mice (Sup-
plementary Table S1; Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, control mice
showed significant weight gain at higher concentrations of wal-
nuts. Mice that received AOM exhibited only a minimal increase
in body weight gain that was similar between groups (Fig. 1B).
Colonoscopy was performed 8 weeks after the last injection of
AOM. As shown in Fig. 1C, tumor development was confirmed in
the AOM-treated mice in the distal (�3 cm) portion of the colon.
Tumor numbers were estimated by the colonoscopic images and
showed a modest decline (33%, P ¼ 0.35) in mice fed 9.4%
walnuts (Fig. 1C).
At 10 weeks after the last dose of AOM, all mice were
sacrificed and examined for the presence of ACF and tumors.
The number and size of ACF in the colons was not significant-
ly affected by dietary walnut consumption in both males
and females (Supplementary Fig. S1A). As shown in Fig. 1D,
the number, volume, and size of colon tumors did not show

 significant differences between the walnut diet groups. How-
ever, there was a modest reduction in both the number (1.3-
fold, P ¼ 0.15) and volume (1.3-fold, P ¼ 0.37) of tumors in
mice that consumed the diet with 9.4% walnuts compared with
mice on the control diet. Tumor protection was most pro-
nounced in male mice, suggesting a gender-specific benefit of
walnut consumption (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Furthermore,
there was a modest but nonsignificant trend toward increased
tumor number and size at higher concentrations of dietary
walnuts (14.1% and 18.8%; Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig.
S1B). Overall, these results indicate that walnut supplementa-
tion may suppress both colon tumor initiation and promotion
when consumed at lower concentrations, but these effects may
be somewhat impaired by increased amounts of dietary wal-
nuts. While AOM treatment induced the development of several
distinct morphological subtypes of tumors (ACF, microadeno-
mas and tumors), there was no obvious change in tumor
morphology at 10 weeks after AOM in male mice fed 9.4%
walnuts (Fig. 1E).
Effects of walnuts on colon carcinogenesis using the TWD
(Study 2)
In Study 2, we used a TWD as a base diet and tested for the
efficacy of walnuts during AOM-induced colon carcinogenesis
(Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. 2A). The TWD is a modified
diet that contains fat from multiple sources, which can reflect
consumption patterns of a typical American (14). All fat sources
in the basal diet for each experimental group have been reduced
proportionately to contain approximately 35% total fat by
calories in the complete diet. The concentration of walnuts was
adjusted to 0%, 3.5%, 7%, and 14% (by weight), which includ-
ed the recommended daily serving of walnuts, 56.6 g (2 ounce)
per day, on the basis of a 2,000 total calorie diet (�18% by
calories; ref. 22).
As shown in Fig. 2B, body weight gain of vehicle-treated control
mice was not affected by the addition of 7% walnuts (10.5% of
total energy from walnuts) compared with controls. Similar to our
findings in Study 1, the addition of walnuts to the TWD did not
affect the number of colonic ACF when measured 10 weeks after
AOM treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2). There was a modest but
nonsignificant reduction in the number of tumors in mice fed 7%
walnuts compared with the 0% walnut group (1.4-fold, P ¼
0.13; Fig. 2C). Furthermore, when tumors were stratified by size,
mice fed the 3.5% and 7% walnuts had a moderate shift toward
smaller tumors (Fig. 2C).
Consistent with Study 1, the tumor-suppressive effects of wal-
nuts were significantly more pronounced in male mice (Fig. 3). As
shown in Fig. 3A, males fed 7% walnuts showed a significant
reduction in the number of tumors (2.3-fold, P ¼ 0.05) and the
size of tumors (1.6-fold, P ¼ 0.03, Fig. 3B) compared with mice
fed 0% walnuts. Moreover, there was a significant reduction in the
number of smaller tumors. As shown in Fig. 3C, 1- and 2-mm

with the 0% walnut group. Surprisingly, these trends were not
observed in female mice in each of the groups.

(Supplementary Fig. S3). This observation suggested that other
factors were involved in suppression of tumorigenesis.
Walnuts consumption increases the richness and diversity of
the gut bacterial community
On the basis of accumulating evidence that the Mediterranean
diet has beneficial effects on the gut microbiota, we next tested the
possibility that walnut consumption might affect gut biodiversity
and perhaps modify risks to the colon from carcinogen exposure.
In the following analyses, we examined the bacterial DNA
extracted from fecal samples collected from TWD-fed mice. As
shown in Fig. 4A and 4B, the number of observed OTUs and the
Shannon index were higher with a diet supplemented with wal-
nuts, suggesting that walnut consumption increased bacterial
richness and diversity. This effect was independent of AOM
treatment. In fact, carcinogen treatment was associated with a
decline of microbial richness in male mice with 0% walnuts
included in the diet (Fig. 4A).
To further examine changes to the microbial community struc-
ture, we performed diversity analysis using Nonmetric Multidi-
mensional Scaling (NMDS). The NMDS plot showed a clear
separation between male and female mice in the presence of
AOM exposure and the absence of walnuts (Fig. 4C: males vs.
females, AOM). It was apparent that AOM treatment specifically
modified microbial diversity in male mice (Fig. 4C: AOM vs.
control). However, the addition of walnuts to the diet eliminated
this gender difference. Moreover, the microbial communities
always clustered together following the inclusion of any concen-
tration of walnuts added to the diet. These initial observations
indicate that AOM treatment alone or dietary supplementation
with walnuts causes significant alterations to the microbial com-
munity structure and that walnuts may exert a greater physiolog-
ical impact to the male gut microbiome.
Toexamine the diversity of the bacterial community, we plotted
the within-group distance for different concentrations of walnuts.
The results showed that female mice had significantly higher
values for both the AOM and saline control treatment groups
than males, with the exception of mice in the AOM treatment
group at a concentration of 7% walnuts (Fig. 4D: circle vs.
triangle). The value was lower for both male and female mice at
7% walnuts. Similar to the results obtained for beta diversity
analysis, male mice showed a significant difference by AOM
treatment (Fig. 4D: triangle in AOM vs. control), confirming that
male mice were more sensitive to carcinogen treatment with
respect to the overall phenotype of the microbiome. Finally, the
addition of walnuts in the control group resulted in an increase in
diversity in males but not females (Fig. 4D: control), again
showing the greater responsiveness of males to this diet.
Specific phylotypes were associated with walnut consumption
and carcinogen exposure
To identify how the key phylotypes of gut bacteria respond to
dietary and carcinogen exposures, a cluster analysis of the top
100 OTUs (95% of the total reads) was performed and the data
are presented as a heatmap (Fig. 5A). The analyses showed that
the OTUs clustered into 9 major phylogenetic clades (Fig. 5A:
A–I). By comparing the abundance of each OTU clade between
different groups, we identified clades that are specifically asso-
ciated with carcinogen treatment (Clade A), walnut consump-
tion (Clade B, C), and both variables (Clade E, F, and I).
Representing 23.1% of the total reads that were generated, clade
A is the most abundant group. Clade A consists entirely of one
OTU (OTU 1) from the genus of Akkermansia. The abundance of
this clade shows a significant increase in AOM-treated male
mice compared with the NaCl-treated mice (Supplementary
Fig. S4A).
Walnut consumption was associated with enrichment of Clade
B, regardless of carcinogen exposure or the concentration of
walnuts in the diet. For mice treated with AOM, the lowest
abundance of Clade B was found in the 0% walnut group in
both males and females (Supplemental Fig. S4B). The relative
abundance of Clade C was significantly lower in male mice treated
with AOM compared with the vehicle control group at the 0%
walnut level (Supplemental Fig. S4C). However, Clade C was
observed to repopulate to comparable levels found in the other
groups by the addition of walnuts to the TWD. The increase in
Clade C observed in the walnut groups was also observed in both
male and female mice treated with AOM, suggesting that Clade C
is directly associated with walnut consumption (Supplemental
Fig. S4C). Clade E appeared to be strongly associated with AOM
treatment, as there were almost no reads identified in the vehicle-
treated control mice (Fig. 5A and B). Moreover, the enrichment of
Clade E in both male and female mice in the AOM-treatment
groups was attenuated by the addition of walnuts to the diet.
These observations indicate that Clade E is influenced by both
carcinogen exposure and consumption of walnuts (Fig. 5B).
There was a phylotype that was significantly dependent upon
the concentration of walnuts consumed. Clade F showed the
lowest abundance in the 7% walnut group in both male and
female mice treated with AOM (Fig. 5C). In the vehicle controls,
Clade F was further reduced to near zero in both male and female
mice at the 7% walnut concentration. Similarly, a significant
modification to the abundance of the phylotype at a walnut
concentration of 7% was found in Clade I (Fig. 5D). Clade I was
highly enriched at 7% walnuts in both male and female mice
regardless of carcinogen treatment. These observations clearly
indicate that dietary consumption of 7% walnuts is capable of
significantly affecting the levels of specific bacteria groups; for
example, reducing (Clade F) and increasing (Clade I) specific
bacterial populations. Furthermore, these changes to bacterial
populations are modified by either carcinogen exposure and/or
by the presence of tumors within the colon.
OTU Clade F is associated with reduced colon tumor
development
To further examine the potential influence of the gut micro-
biota on colon tumor formation, we performed a correlation
analysis between OTU clades and the number of tumors. As
shown in Fig. 6, 2 OTU clades were correlated with tumor
numbers. The abundance of OTU clade F was positively corre-
lated with the number of tumors (r ¼ 0.70; P ¼ 0.05), especially
with tumors of 1-mm diameter (r ¼ 0.78; P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 6A and
B). A negative correlation was observed between the number of
tumors and the abundance of OTU clade I (r ¼ 0.66, P ¼
0.08; Fig. 6C). Furthermore, a stronger negative correlation was
found between the abundance of OTU clade I and tumors of 2-
mm diameter in size (r ¼ 0.81, P ¼ 0.01; Fig. 6D). Taken
together, these analyses suggest that a reduction in clade F may
be an important event that contributes to the suppression of
tumor initiation. In addition, clade I may be necessary for
suppression of tumor promotion.

 Discussion
The concept of exploiting whole foods for their chemopreven-
tive benefit has gained significant traction in recent years (23).
Whole foods are composed of a wide array of beneficial nutrients
that together may have additive or synergistic properties that
contribute to reduced cancer risk. Walnuts may be a particularly
attractive whole food approach for cancer prevention. They are
readily available, widely consumed, and contain an excellent
profile of bioactive components that may exert complex and
synergistic effects on tumorigenesis (16, 22, 24–30).
The present study has evaluated the impact of dietary walnut
consumption on colon carcinogenesis using a well-established
mouse cancer model. Importantly, we used 2 fundamentally
distinct basal diets to evaluate the potential contribution of
dietary patterns to the nutritive effects of walnuts. AIN-76A diet
is a purified diet containing micronutrient profiles optimized for
growth and fertility and is widely used in preclinical research to
provide "standardized" results among different animal experi-
ments (31). On the other hand, as reported by Hintze and
colleagues (14), TWD is formulated to recapitulate the typical
American intake of macro- and micronutrients and can be used for
dietary chemopreventive studies in rodent models of human
disease. Compared with the AIN-76A diet, TWD contains less
fat but uses a diverse set of sources to match patterns of fat
consumption as reported by the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES), resulting a wide range of dietary
fatty acids (14). Interestingly, the TWD diet alone did not
cause a significant increase in tumor numbers compared with
the AIN-76A diet, which is likely due to the potency of AOM
treatment in strain A mice. As we have reported in previous studies

 (13), strain A mice are highly sensitive to AOM-induced colon
carcinogenesis, with up to 40 adenomas developing in the distal
colon. On this potent cancer background, the promotional effects
of TWD are likely obscured.
On the basis of the 2 studies reported herein, walnut consump-
tion at dietary concentrations of 7% and 9.4% by weight, equiv-
alent to 10% to 15% of total caloric intake, afforded protection
against colon cancer. These concentrations are equivalent to the
recommended daily serving of walnuts, 56.6 g (2 ounce) per day,
on the basis of a 2,000 total calorie diet (�18% by calories;
ref. 22). A higher walnut concentration added to the AIN-76A diet
(18.8% by weight; 20% to 30% of total caloric intake) caused
significant weight gain in control mice but did not protect against
AOM-induced colon tumor development (Figs. 1B and 3A). This
result, although not statistically significant, suggests an optimal
intake of walnuts for colon cancer protection. A higher walnut
concentration added to the AIN-76A diet (18.8% by weight; 20%
to 30% of total caloric intake) caused significant weight gain in

 statistically significant, suggests an optimal intake of walnuts for
colon cancer protection.
The concentration-dependent effect of walnuts in Study 1 may
be related to a pronounced alteration in the levels of oleic acid that
was reduced by about 50% at the highest concentration of walnuts
(18.8%; Supplementary Table S1). Oleic acid, also referred to as
omega-9 fatty acid, is a major constituent of olive oil that has been
shown to promote clearance of excess fatty acids to promote
"weight loss" (32) and to possess antitumor activity (33). In a
recent study, oleic acid was shown to inhibit TNFa-induced
COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in a human glioblastoma
cell line (34). It was also reported that the levels of palmitoleic acid
and oleic acid were significantly lower in colorectal cancer tissues
(35). These results suggest that similar to omega-3 fatty acids, the
levels of oleic acid may also be important for both weight control
and cancer risk.
Importantly, our results indicate both concentration- and gen-
der-specific effects of walnuts. As shown in Fig. 3, at optimal
dietary concentrations of walnuts, male mice exhibited greater
protection from colon cancer compared with females. This gen-
der-related effect was observed when walnuts were incorporated
into either the AIN-76A or TWD. Although 7% walnut consump-
tion resulted in a 2.3-fold reduction in the number of tumors in
male mice fed TWD, there was only a moderate effect on tumor
volume, suggesting a more pronounced effect on tumor initiation
in this carcinogenesis model.
The protection afforded by walnuts may have its basis in a
number of nutritive components contained within the nut. For
example, the omega-3 PUFAs are a major component of wal-
nuts, and the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids such as eicosa-
pentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have
been shown to reduce adenomatous polyp number and size in
patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP; ref. 36).
Moreover, g-tocopherol is a potent antioxidant with anti-
inflammatory activities and is found in significant concentra-
tions in walnuts (12). Ju and colleagues (37) showed that
dietary supplementation of 0.3% g-tocopherol–rich mixture
(g-TmT) on AOM/DSS-treated mice reduced inflammation and
inhibited colon tumorigenesis by reducing the levels of PGE2,
leukotriene B4, and nitrotyrosine in the colon (37). Polyphe-
nols in walnuts, mainly ellagitannins (ET), also elicit anticancer
properties. Dietary ETs are metabolized by gut flora to urolithin
A & B (38). In a prostate cancer cell line, urolithin A was
reported to induce apoptosis, associated with a decrease in the
antiapoptotic protein BCL-2 with increased antiproliferative
p21 levels (39). Further molecular analysis on tumor-suppres-
sive mechanisms within the walnut-treated tissues is warranted
to better understand the roles of these components.
Emerging evidence indicates profound effects of diet on the gut
microbiota (reviewed in ref. 40). Dietary changes can cause
dramatic and rapid alterations to bacterial community structure,
leading to important alterations in the luminal formation of a
wide range of microbial metabolites (41). Early stages of tumor
development, particularly at the initiation phase, can be influ-
enced by microbial community structure, mediated in part via the
formation of key metabolic products (42). For example, bacteria
utilize dietary fiber to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA),
such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate that have anti-inflam-
matory properties (reviewed in ref. 43). In fact, walnuts are rich in
fiber (6.4%), providing a favorable luminal environment for
producing the SCFAs. In the present study, we observed significant
alterations to the structure of the gut microbial community by the
addition of walnuts to the diet. At each concentration of walnuts
tested, there was a marked increase in the diversity and richness of
the gut microbiota. This finding underscores the beneficial effects
of dietary walnut intake because low bacterial diversity in the gut
has often been linked to human diseases, including obesity and
inflammatory bowel disease (44, 45).
The walnut-supplemented diets influenced multiple phylo-
types. For example, Akkermansia muciniphila is a mucin-degrading
commensal bacterium that has been shown to exacerbate intes-
tinal inflammation by disturbing mucosal barrier function (46).
In fact, members of this genus have also been found at higher
concentrations in patients with colorectal cancer (47) and in mice
harboring AOM/DSS-induced colon tumors (48). As shown
in Fig. 5A, the Akkermansia genus was exclusively associated with
mice exposed to AOM and harboring colon tumors (clade A).
Thus, it is possible that A. muciniphila may play an as yet undefined
role in colon tumor development. In contrast, we report that
walnut consumption is associated with an increased abundance
of bacteria belonging to the phylum Furmicutes, including Lacto-
bacillus, Clostridiales, Clostridium, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococ-
caceae. Furmicutes are the most prevalent bacteria within both the
human and rodent gut, and many members of this phylum tend
to be reduced in patients with colorectal cancer, as well as in the
colons of tumor-bearing mice (49). In a recent study by Baxter and
colleagues (49), fecal microbiota from patients with colorectal
cancer were transplanted into germ-free mice and tumors were
then induced by treatment with AOM followed by DSS. Interest-
ingly, the number of colon tumors that developed after 10 weeks
was negatively correlated with the abundance of Clostridiales,
including several members of the Clostridium Group XIVa (49).
Moreover, Lactobacillus and Ruminococcaceae are probiotic species
that are generally found at lower levels in both rodent tumor
models and patients with colorectal cancer (50, 51). Consistent
with these results, similar bacterial signatures were found to be
strongly associated with carcinogen treatment (Fig. 5).
While it is clear that walnut consumption alone can reshape
the gut community structure into one that has potential anti-
tumor properties, phylotypes associated with both carcinogen
exposure and walnut consumption formed a distinct cluster. In
addition to phylotypes associated with walnut consumption,
many bacteria that belong to the phylum Bacteroidetes have also
emerged within this group, including Bacteroides, Bacteroidales,
and Porphyromonadaceae. Bacteroidetes are anaerobic bacteria
and are present as the second largest bacterial population in
the gut after Furmicutes. In fact, many members of the genus
Bacteroidales are increased in both rodent models and human
subjects (52). Furthermore, a higher colonization rate of Bac-
teroides has been correlated with advanced colorectal cancer
status, suggesting that some bacterial species in this genus may
play a direct role in promoting colon carcinogenesis (53).
Our correlation analysis depicted in Fig.6 identified the presence
of a potential microbial signature that could be directly associated
with walnut consumption and colon cancer suppression in male
mice.Miceharboringthelowestnumberoftumorstendedtohavea

These changes were associated with an overpopulation of Rumino-
coccaceae and Clostridium XIVa genus. This bacterial signature is
similar to that previously reported during inflammation-associated
colon tumorigenesis in mice (49). This recent study also suggested
that distinct bacterial communities would result in distinct luminal

 metabolite profiles and that butyrate production by members of
Clostridium XIVa could contribute to cancer protection (49). Buty-
rate is a major energy source for colonocytes and a critical mediator
of the inflammatory response in the gut (54). It is also potent
inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC), which enhances apopto-
sis and suppresses intestinal inflammation (55, 56). During colon
carcinogenesis, butyrate has been shown to inhibit cell prolifera-
tion (57). Interestingly, it was recently reported that walnuts were
among the most highly effective nuts in generating butyrate during
the fermentation process in vitro (58). Thus, it is possible that
dietary walnut intake can increase populations of butyrate-produc-
ing bacteria, inducing a microbial community structure that is
antitumorigenic within the gut.
The present study has further established the existence of
marked differences in microbiome signatures between male and
female mice. For example, male mice have a significantly lower
overall bacterial diversity in the absence of walnut supplementa-
tion compared with female mice (Fig. 3). Upon walnut consump-
tion, however, bacterial diversity increases in the male mice,
ultimatelyachievingcomparable levelsthat are presentin females.
These results suggest that male mice may be more sensitive to diet-
induced changes, enabling rapid modifications to their microbial
composition. In fact, gender-specific differences in disease sus-
ceptibility have been reported in relation to gut microbial com-
munity structure. For example, colonization of male commensal
bacteria into female mice protected against Type 1 diabetes by
changing the levels of testosterone and metabolic profiles gener-
ated by the microbiota (59). Alterations to the composition of the
gut microbiome and bacterial metabolite profiles can further
influence disease risk (60, 61). Therefore, it is possible that the
male mice in our study underwent beneficial diet-induced
changes to microbial composition, a change that contributed to
the establishment of a protective luminal environment.
In summary, our results demonstrate that dietary walnut con-
sumption can suppress colon carcinogenesis when provided at
optimal concentrations in the diet, protection that is associated
with both AIN-76A and a modified Western diet formulation. In
addition, walnut intake significantly modifies the microbial com-
munity structure in the large intestine, potentially establishing a
protective luminal microenvironment. Most importantly, we
have identified a unique bacterial signature that is associated
with tumor suppression by walnut consumption. Additional
studies are required to confirm these results and to elucidate the
possible mechanisms by which walnut dietary supplementation
may contribute to protection against colon cancer development.
