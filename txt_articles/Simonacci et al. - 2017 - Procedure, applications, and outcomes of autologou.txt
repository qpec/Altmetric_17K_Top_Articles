Objective: To systematically review the procedure, applications, and outcomes of autologous fat grafting,
a promising technique with various clinical applications.
Patients and methods: Literature review of publications concerning autologous fat grafting.
Results: Since its introduction, lipofilling has become increasingly popular; however, its results are
variable and unpredictable. Several modifications have been made to the procedures of fat harvesting,
processing, and injecting. Surgical excision and low negative-pressure aspiration with large-bore can-
nulas minimize adipocyte damage during fat harvesting. The “wet” method of fat harvesting involves
fluid injection at the donor site and facilitates lipoaspiration while minimizing pain and ecchymosis. For
fat processing, centrifugation at a low speed is preferable to high-speed centrifugation, gravity separation
or filtration. Fat injection at the recipient site should be performed using small-gauge cannulas in a
fanning out pattern over multiple sessions, rather than a single session. Fat grafts exhibit not only dermal
filler properties but also regenerative potential owing to the presence of stem cells in fat tissue. Thus, the
clinical applications of autologous fat grafting include correction of secondary contour defects after
breast reconstruction, release of painful scar contractures, and treatment of burn scars and radio-
dermatitis. Lipofilling is also used in aesthetic surgery, such as facial and hand rejuvenation, augmen-
tation rhinoplasty, and breast and gluteal augmentation. The complications of lipofilling are minimal and
include bruising, swelling, pain, infection, necrosis, and calcification.
Conclusions: Lipofilling is a low-risk procedure that can be used to correct soft-tissue defects in the face,
trunk, and extremities, with minimal discomfort for patients.

1. Introduction
Historically, the use of fat grafts to correct congenital de-
formities and complex traumatic wounds with soft-tissue loss after
radical oncological surgery was proposed in 1893 by Neuber, by
Hollander in 1912, by Neuhof in 1921, and by Josef in 1931 [1]. The
liposuction technique, introduced by Fisher in 1974, followed by the
tumescent technique, introduced by Klein in 1985, accelerated the
development of the lipofilling technique. The tumescent technique
allowed patients to undergo liposuction under local anaesthesia
administered using small cannulas [2]. In 1987, Coleman intro-
duced a new technique to decrease traumatic handling of fat during
liposuction. His technique consisted of three steps: manual lip-
oaspiration under low pressure, centrifugation for 3 min at
3400 rpm, and reinjection in 3D. This technique remains the gold
standard for liposuction and lipofilling, but has undergone some
technical modifications [2,3]. Since the 1980s, autologous fat
transplantation has been one of the most popular procedures
performed by plastic surgeons [4]. In 2009, fat grafting represented
5.9% of all non-surgical aesthetic procedures [5]. However, because
the results of lipofilling are variable, optimization of the procedure
is required. The long-term results of fat grafting are often disap-
pointing because of unpredictable partial absorption of up to 70% of
the volume of the fat graft. A number of studies have reported
resorption rates of 30%e70% within a year [6]. Thus, autologous fat
grafting has unpredictable success rates, and there is no agreement
among physicians as to the ideal method for the harvesting and
handling of fat grafts [5e7]. The Coleman technique should be
considered as the standard and preferred method for harvesting
and processing. However, one of the problems observed is a
decrease in the number of fat cells because of damage caused
during the aspiration and centrifugation steps [8]. Another limita-
tion is the requirement to infiltrate cells in direct contact with well-
vascularized tissues [8]. Furthermore, the Coleman technique can
be operator dependent and time-consuming if performed by less-
experienced surgeons. Numerous modifications of the Coleman
have been attempted in order to improve the survival of the
injected fat, including atraumatic fat-harvesting, fat washing to
eliminate inflammatory mediators, centrifugation, and incubation
of fat grafts with different bioactive agents. Fat is a filler with ideal
properties: it naturally integrates into tissues, is autologous, and is
100% biocompatible. However, this is not the only function of
lipofilling; fat is an active and dynamic tissue composed of several
different cell types, including adipocytes, fibroblasts, smooth
muscle cells, endothelial cells, and adipogenic progenitor cells
called “preadipocytes” [9e11]. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs)
have a differentiation potential similar to that of other mesen-
chymal stem cells as well as a higher yield upon isolation and a
greater proliferative rate in culture when compared to bone mar-
rowederived stem cells [12e14]. Because of these properties and
because these cells can be easily harvested in great amounts with
minimal donor-site morbidity, ASCs have proved to be particularly
promising for regenerative therapies [12,15].
2. Fat harvesting
It is widely accepted that less-traumatic methods of fat har-
vesting result in increased adipocyte viability and graft survival
[16,17]. Several techniques have been proposed for fat harvesting,
and there is an ongoing debate in the literature as to which method
produces more viable and functional adipocytes. The main tech-
niques are vacuum aspiration, syringe aspiration, and surgical
excision. Recent experimental as well as some clinical studies
support direct fat excision over aspiration. Fagrell et al. [16,18]
introduced a technique called “fat cylinder graft,” in which fat is
drilled out in cores by a punching device, whereas Qin et al. [16,19]
recommended the core graft for block grafting because it maintains
the structure and viability of harvested fat tissue by avoiding
damage to the adipocytes. Pu et al. [16,20] found significantly
impaired adipocyte function in conventional liposuction aspirates
compared with fresh fatty tissue samples and syringe-aspirated fat.
Low negative-pressure lipoaspiration may yield fat faster than sy-
ringe aspiration and can be used when a large volume of fat is
required, as in breast surgery. The high vacuum pressures of con-
ventional liposuction may cause structural disruption in up to 90%
of adipocytes [16,17]. Cannula size may also affect the viability of
harvested fat [21]. The use of the excisional method and fat har-
vesting with large-bore cannulas reduce the occurrence of cellular

 rupture and preserve the native tissue architecture. Campbell et al.
found an inverse relationship between cellular damage and the
diameter of the instrument used to extract fat [22]. Erdim et al. [23]
reported higher graft viability with lipoaspirates that were ob-
tained using a 6-mm cannula rather than a 4-mm or 2-mm cannula.
Coleman et al. [24] described a technique for fat harvesting that
minimized trauma to the adipocytes. With a 3-mm, blunt-edged, 2-
hole cannula connected to a 10-mL syringe, fat is suctioned
manually by withdrawing the plunger. The cannula is pushed
through the harvest site, as the surgeon uses digital manipulation
to pull back on the plunger of the syringe and create a gentle
negative pressure [24]. A combination of slight negative pressure
and the curetting action of the cannula through the tissues allows
parcels of fat to move through the cannula and Luer-Lok aperture
into the barrel of the syringe [24]. When filled, the syringe is
disconnected from the cannula, which is replaced with a plug that
seals the Luer-Lok end of the syringe [24]. The plunger is removed
from the syringe before it is placed into a centrifuge [24].
There are different natural fat deposits in the body; surgeons
should identify the most suitable area after an accurate examina-
tion of the patient. The abdomen is the most common site of fat
harvesting; the second is the trochanteric region (saddlebags) and
the inside of the thighs and knees [25,26]. The harvesting of fat
grafts can be performed via a “wet” method or a “dry” method. In
1993, Klein et al. [16,27] described the “wet” method, which in-
volves the injection of the donor site with a fluid solution (Klein's
solution) containing 0.9% NaCl, epinephrine, and a local anaes-
thetic. Illouz and de Villers [16,28] highlighted the fact that the wet
technique causes hydrodissection and enlarges the target fat layer,
thus facilitating the subsequent aspiration, with decreased pain
and ecchymosis. It has been observed that low shear stress leading
improves graft survival; in fact, the shear stress exerted on har-
vested fat has been determined to be a factor affecting adipocyte
viability [29]. Alternatively, a “dry” method without the tumescent
fluid could be used. However, the “dry” technique may lead to a
greater requirement for analgesics [27].
Micro- and nanofat grafts, typically harvested with cannulas as
small as 0.7 mm in diameter, can be used to treat delicate areas of
the face such as the eyelids and lips [30,31]. Tonnard et al. high-
lighted the clinical application of micro- and nanofat grafts
compared with macrofat [32]. Microfat particles were harvested
from the abdomen using a cannula with a 1-mm diameter. An
amount of the microfat was sheared into finer particles using a
Leur-to-Leur connector with two 10-mL syringes [32,33]. The
nanoparticles were then filtered and collected. Macrofat particles
were also harvested using a standard 3-mm cannula to serve as
controls [32,33]. The study provided micrographs, which showed
normal cellular architecture and sparse nonviable cells for both the
macro- and microfat particles [32,33]. The nanofat grafts were
devoid of adipocytes, and the native architecture was disrupted
[32,33]. However, the nanografts retained a rich supply of ASCs,
which were similar to the ASCs in the macro- and microfat samples
in terms of proliferation and differentiation [32,33]. In several
clinical cases, the use of nanofat grafts has resulted in improved
skin quality by 6 months postoperatively [32,33]. Therefore, the
author suggests that while nanografts do not contain viable adi-
pocytes, the high content of stem cells in these grafts may be
clinically useful for skin rejuvenation [32,33].
3. Fat processing
The most commonly used methods to prepare fat grafts are
sedimentation, filtering, washing, and centrifugation. Fat process-
ing is necessary because the lipoaspirate contains not only adipo-
cytes but also collagen fibres, blood, and debris. These elements can
cause inflammation at the recipient site, which can be detrimental
for the fat graft [34]. Blood must be extracted because blood ac-
celerates the degradation of the transplanted fat [35]. Moreover, the
injection of debris gives an erroneous impression of the volume of
correction because the debris will be absorbed after a few hours
[34]. In animal experiments, no significant differences have been
observed in the weight or architecture of fat grafts obtained using
the centrifugation, filtration, or sedimentation methods [36e40]. In
contrast, studies conducted in patients have demonstrated more
favourable outcomes with centrifugation rather than gravity sep-
aration [36]. Comparative studies investigating the effects of fat
processing
with
centrifugation,
washing,
and
filtration
have
showed no significant differences in fat retention; however, filtra-
tion resulted in nodule formation, whereas centrifugation did not
[41,42]. Ferraro et al. [8] demonstrated that centrifugation with a
force greater than 50 g resulted in damage to the structural integ-
rity of adipose tissue, increased necrosis and apoptosis of cells, and
decreased adipogenic differentiation capacity and tubule forma-
tion. Tubule formation during angiogenesis provides blood supply
and nutrients to adipose tissue and ultimately sustains the fat graft
for long-term retention [36,43,44]. Higher centrifugation speeds
have also been correlated with increased fluid portion, reduced
injectable tissue volume, and increased oil portion, which are
associated with damage to adipocytes [36,45]. Coleman suggested a
processing method that has gained popularity and has been since
integrated in many fat-transfer clinical protocols. Aspirated fat in
syringes is spun at 3000 rpm for 3 min to isolate the fat [46]. After
the centrifugation, three layers are observed: the first layer includes
lipids, which can be poured off using absorbent material; the sec-
ond layer consists of fatty tissue; and the third layer contains blood,
tissue fluid, and local anaesthetic and is ejected from the base of
syringe. The middle layer is routinely used for adipose tissue
grafting [5,47e49] (Fig. 1). The identification of an optimal pro-
cessing method will increase the number of viable cells and ulti-
mately increase fat engraftment and retention over time.

 4. Fat injection
Despite a long history of clinical use and the evolution of fat-
transfer techniques, no consensus exists on the best technique
and the longevity of results, yet the principles of fat reimplantation
are based on optimal recipient-site vascularity for increased fat
survival [16]. Through a skin incision of a size corresponding to the
diameter of the cannula, the fat graft is inserted at the level of the
anatomical region affected. Small-gauge cannulas are thought to
reduce trauma to the recipient site, thus reducing the risks of
bleeding, haematoma formation, and poor graft oxygen diffusion
[16]. Because revascularization starts at the periphery, ischaemic
time is longer in the centre of the graft [34]. Therefore, fat rein-
jection in multiple small-volume sessions is preferred over one
single injection [34]. Usually, through multiple access sites, multi-
ple tunnels are created on insertion, but fat is injected only during
withdrawal of the cannula in a “fanning-out” pattern [16]. Fat grafts
are distributed in small aliquots and fanned out to varying depths in
the soft tissue to avoid excessive interstitial pressure at the recip-
ient site and overcrowding of the transplanted adipocytes [16].
Studies on fat-graft maintenance have demonstrated that mobile
areas of the face, such as the glabella and lips, are less amenable to
correction than are less-mobile areas, such as the malar and lateral
cheek areas [16]. Regarding the cannula size, several authors use
different calibre cannulas for fat injection, and the nature of the
recipient site is the major determinant in the choice of cannula size.
Ozsoy et al. [21] observed a greater vitality of adipose tissue if
infiltrated with cannulas of at least 2.5 mm in diameter. However,
Erdim et al. [23] found no significant differences in cell viability
with differing needle gauge.
5. Role of ASCs
Fat transplantation techniques have dramatically changed over
the last two decades, from simple free transfers of intact adipose
tissue, which had limited success in the consistent replacement of
volume defects, to free composite fat-cell transplantation strategies
that, if properly executed, could have a high regenerative potential
for
both simple
volume
replacement
as well as functional
enhancement of recipient tissues. ASCs are similar to bone mar-
rowederived stem cells in that they are capable of differentiating
into multiple mesodermal tissue types and show similar surface
protein marker expression [15,50]. The cytometric analysis of ASCs
has shown that they do not express CD31 and CD45, but do express
CD34, CD73, CD105, and the mesenchymal stem cell marker CD90
[51,52]. Human ASCs are distinct from other mesenchymal pro-
genitors in terms of surface-marker expression profile; notably,
only ASCs express the stem-celleassociated marker CD34 in higher
percentages than bone marrowederived mesenchymal stem cells
and dermal fibroblasts [53]. ASCs are different from bone mar-
rowederived mesenchymal stem cells because they can be easily
obtained using a standard wet liposuction procedure under local
anaesthesia, without the need for expansion in culture [15,54]. For
these reasons, ASCs are appealing for cell-based therapies involving
tissue repair and regeneration. Stem cells isolated from lip-
oaspirates have demonstrated in vitro differentiation into adipo-
genic, osteogenic, chondrogenic, myogenic, cardiomyogenic, and
neurogenic lineages [55e57]. We have previously reported two
methods
of
ASC
isolation
(Fig.
2):
one
based
on
a
mechanical þ enzymatic procedure [51], and the other exclusively
mechanical [52].
ASCs are part of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose
tissue, together with a heterogeneous population of many other cell
types,
including
preadipocytes,
endothelial
cells,
pericytes,
haematopoietic-lineage cells, and fibroblasts [58]. The regenerative
features of the SVF are attributable to its paracrine effects: SVF cells
secrete vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth
factor, and transforming growth factor-b in the presence of stimuli
such as hypoxia and other growth factors [15,59] and strongly in-
fluence the differentiation of stem cells, promoting angiogenesis
and wound healing, and potentially aiding new tissue growth and
development [60]. Other studies have emphasized the plasticity of
preadipocytes and macrophages, and suggested that some or all of
the healing effect maybe secondary to enhanced immune response
[61,62] or removal of dying or defective cells, leading to permanent
tissue remodelling [63]. In 2006, Matsumoto et al. [64] provided
evidence to support a novel method of autologous tissue transfer,
which they named cell-assisted lipotransfer (CAL). CAL is the con-
current transplantation of aspirated fat and ASCs. In CAL, ASCs were
supportively used to boost the efficacy of autologous lipoinjection
(resulting in a higher survival rate and the persistence of trans-
planted fat) and to decrease the known adverse effects of lip-
oinjection, such as fibrosis, pseudocyst formation, and calcification
[64].
6. Applications
6.1. Breast reconstruction
Autologous fat transplantation is widely used in reconstructive
breast surgery. Plastic surgeons and patients seeking breast
reconstruction may have drastically different images in mind of
what constitutes an attractive, natural, and ideal breast shape
[65,66]. Lipofilling represents a simple solution to restore the cor-
rect profile of the breast after reconstruction. In fact, in the im-
mediate or late postoperative period, secondary contour defects of
the reconstructed breast can develop [67,68]. Indeed, there are
important landmarks in the female breast, for example, the crea-
tion of a well-defined inframammary fold is a fundamental element
in obtaining a good aesthetic result after breast reconstruction [69].
Lipofilling can be used after reconstruction with implants or muscle
flaps with or without tissue expansion (Fig. 3aeb). Appropriate
tissue expansion allows the use of autologous flaps or the insertion

52
 of definitive prosthetic implants for breast reconstruction. This
could be carried out with the aid of a computer program to help the
surgeon select the proper tissue expander while planning breast
reconstruction [70,71]. In Poland syndrome of the chest wall and
breast, autologous fat injection seems to be a particularly useful
technique to fill the subclavicular and anterior axillary fold defects.
Fat injection is rarely used as the sole treatment, rather it is often
performed in combination with other routine techniques of breast
surgery [72]. When fat tissue is not perfused, it can die and result in
necrotic cysts and even calcification, but this complication can
occur in any surgical breast procedure [73]. Fat grafting to the
breast could potentially interfere with breast cancer detection;
however, no evidence has been found that strongly supports such
an interference [74]. Early studies noted that graft re-absorption
was the main drawback of fat grafting, with 50%e90% graft loss
[75e78]. Large grafts exhibit higher rates of liquefaction, necrosis,
and cyst formation, while too small a graft volume is associated
with resorption [75,79]. To ensure maximal take, many surgeons
practice repeated transfers [3,79e81].
6.2. Scars
Patients with retractile and painful scars compromising the
normal daily activity/mobility of the joint involved can take
advantage of lipofilling treatment. In fact, fat transplantation can be
used not only to fill atrophic scars but also to reduce scar
contracture as a regenerative alternative to other surgical tech-
niques [82]. This is made possible by the presence of ASCs in the fat
tissue. From a histological point of view, autologous fat grafts show
the ability to regenerate the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and
improve the dermal and dermohypodermic quality in scar areas,
with increasing amount of fat layer - largely destroyed in cases of
thermal insults and poorly regenerated during tissue repair after
any type of trauma - new collagen deposition, and local neo-
angiogenesis [83e85]. Mojallal et al. [86] showed that fat tissue
grafting stimulates the neosynthesis of collagen fibres at the
recipient site and makes the dermis thicker, thereby improving skin
quality. The regenerative role of fat in scarred areas is thought to be
attributable to the release of multiple nerve entrapments, so that
neuropathic pain is improved. In addition, the improvement in
neurogenic pain may be maintained by placing fat grafts around the
nerve to avoid the recurrence of scar contracture [86]. Klinger et al.
[85] described the use of lipofilling to treat scars in 694 patients.
They observed quality improvement in all treated scars, from both
an aesthetic and a functional point of view. In particular, the relief
from pain and increase in scar elasticity were clinically assessable in
all patients. The first results were observed soon after the proced-
ure (at 14 days); relief from pain and improvement in scar elasticity
were noted at 3 months and were sustained in all patients until the
1-year follow-up. Autologous fat grafts allow skin to become softer
and more flexible and extensible, and very often the colour seems
similar to that of the surrounding unaffected skin. Another
important quality of scars release, both superficial and deep, is the
improvement in the mobility of the body part involved, in partic-
ular, the affected joints, eyelids, nasal valve, and mouth, as well as
the possibility for the patient to have a partial restoration of facial
expression. In patients with marked skin depression, scar release by
autologous fat grafting often fills these volume deficits, leading to
excellent cosmetic results and positively affecting the patient's
body image [85].
6.3. Burns
Burn injury is a devastating trauma with systemic conse-
quences. Although survival rates are increasing, burn injury re-
mains a great challenge in the field of cutaneous wound healing.
Major burns patients lack enough skin to cover their burns, and the
currently used cutaneous substitutes and cultured epithelial auto-
grafts are still neither efficient nor effective solutions [86,87].
Transplanted skin from donors is currently not an option due to
graft rejection; however, augmenting immunotolerance via stem
cell therapy may overcome this problem. Regenerative medicine
using stem cells is an efficient, low-morbidity, and high-quality
therapy for skin coverage in burns, mainly due to the regenera-
tion of skin appendages [88] and the minimal risk of hypertrophic
scarring [89,90]. Hypertrophic burn scars occur in approximately
75% of white patients with third-degree burns [91,92]. Burn out-
comes still represent a problem because of aesthetic and functional
concerns as well as concerns regarding the patient's social and
psychological life [93]. Subscar and intrascar fat grafting are rela-
tively recent techniques that improve scar quality (Fig. 4aeb).
Bruno et al. [93], in their immunohistochemical study, reported
that burn scars, even old ones, cannot be considered as quiescent
scars because they are characterized by maturation block and a
proinflammatory and hypervascularized status. Lipofilling allows a

53
 dramatic change in this status, making the tissue much more
similar to healthy tissues from a histological point of view [93]. In
another study, Brongo et al. [94] reported their experience with the
use of lipofilling to treat burn scars. They evaluated the evolution of
the scars at 1 year after the treatment by means of a questionnaire
and physical and histopathological examinations. At the 1-year
follow-up, all patients reported an improvement in their clinical
condition. The histological findings showed new collagen deposi-
tion, neoangiogenesis, and dermal hyperplasia in the context of
new tissue, demonstrating tissue regeneration. Clinically, improved
texture, softness, thickness, colour, and elasticity of the treated skin
were observed, as was a reduction in scar retraction [94].
Conversely Gal et al. [95] treated eight burned pediatric patients
with a single autologous fat transplantation and did not observed
any scar improvement when compared to a control group treated
with saline injections. The authors theorized that their findings
may be explained by the fact that they performed only one single
session of fat grafting. Indeed Strong et al. [36] theorized that serial
fat transplant sessions may be required to improve scarred recip-
ient sites.
To enhance the therapeutic response after stem cell treatment in
burns patients, intense tissue engineering with the development of
3D scaffolds or matrices is of vital importance as well as improved
preconditioning cell treatments and optimized culture conditions
[96].
6.4. Radiodermatitis
Radiation dermatitis is caused by prolonged exposure of the skin
to ionizing radiation [97]. It can be seen in patients receiving ra-
diation therapy, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy [98].
Inflammation of the skin after exposure to radiotherapy (radio-
dermatitis) can be classified into three specific types: acute radio-
dermatitis, chronic radiodermatitis, and eosinophilic, polymorphic,
and pruritic eruption associated with radiotherapy [98]. Rigotti
et al. [99] reported that the transplantation of lipoaspirates con-
taining adult ASCs is a highly effective therapeutic approach for the
treatment of degenerative, chronic lesions induced as late effects of
oncologic radiation treatments. In fact, ultrastructural analysis of
the radio-damaged tissue revealed a significant reduction of the
capillary bed [99]. Owing to the angiogenic factors released from
ASCs, lipofilling interrupted a vicious circle of vascular lesion,
ischaemia, hyperpermeability, and fibrosis leading to increased
ischaemia, and favoured the growth of a microvascular bed with
the correct ratio of adipocytes to capillaries [99]. These changes
lead to the production of new microvessels, which ultimately in-
creases circulation. They advanced the idea that the chain of events
leading to mesemchymalization of the tissue would be the
following: targeting of damaged areas by stem cells, release of
angiogenic factors, formation of new vessels, and oxygenation [99].
This process would favour the development of stem cells into
mature adipocytes and in a newly formed microcirculation
replacing the replacing the existing, seriously damaged one [99].
Because some damaged vessels could still be found in persisting
areas of fibrosis late after the treatment, they stressed the impor-
tance of performing repeated injections to obtain homogeneous
improvement throughout the radio-damaged area [99]. In fact, they
reported a linear relationship between clinical improvement and
the number of transplants. The reason for this is probably that the
healing of tissue microangiopathy increased as a function of the
total number of stem cells [99].
6.5. HIV-associated lipodystrophy
The redistribution of fat deposits in HIV-associated lipodys-
trophy includes visceral fat accumulation in the abdomen and
subcutaneous fat accumulation in the breasts and the cervical and
dorsal areas (buffalo hump) with fat wasting in the legs, arms,
buttocks, and face [100]. Many hypotheses have been proposed for
its aetiology: most of them focus on the mitochondrial toxic effects
and altered adipocyte differentiation induced by protease in-
hibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [100e102],
but lipodystrophy has also been represented as a selective neu-
ropathy [100,103]. Following the consistent experience of Coleman
in facial lipofilling for aesthetic purposes [2,100,104], autologous fat
injection has been considered as one of the most reliable treat-
ments for facial subcutaneous augmentation. However, not all pa-
tients are candidates for this treatment because some patients do
not possess enough subcutaneous tissue in the lower abdominal
area, which is the fattiest area of the body in these patients. In many
cases, the treating physician informs the patients of the possibility
of a plastic surgery treatment for their facial lipoatrophy. This
strategy makes the patients adhere to their therapy more readily
[101].
6.6. Aesthetic surgery
6.6.1. Facial rejuvenation
Autologous fat grafting has an important role in facial rejuve-
nation. In fact, the unique regenerative potential of lipofilling leads
to excellent results due to its filling properties and the role of ASCs.

54
 For this reason, lipofilling has unique features, and plastic surgeons
can use it not only to correct soft-tissue deficiencies but also to
rejuvenate the skin of the face [87]. The loss of facial volume,
especially in the periorbital region, is an important component of
aging and is due to the redistribution and atrophy of facial fat
[105e108]. Traditional approaches to facial rejuvenation have
relied on subtractive surgical techniques, focusing on the excision
of skin, muscle, and/or fat [109]. Modern approaches concentrate
instead on filling the “empty” facial compartments, mainly through
fat grafting [110]. Traditional fat grafting involves Coleman's har-
vesting technique with 2-mm side-port cannulas, followed by the
distribution of a structural fat implant throughout the various
dermal layers of the face, from deep to superficial [104]. Disad-
vantages of traditional fat grafting include the risks of irregular fat
accumulation, fat necrosis, and visible lumpiness. Because the
eyelid skin is usually thin, the periocular area is most susceptible to
contour problems, and thus, deep implantation of fat is recom-
mended [110]. In response to concerns such as those outlined
above, many authors have recently focused on microfat grafting
techniques [104,111]. A major effect of microfat injection is
improvement in the viability of adipocytes via the disruption of fat
lobules [112], which is contrary to Coleman's thesis that preserva-
tion of the lobular structure is essential for fat survival [2]. More-
over, Moscatello et al. [111] demonstrated that the greater surface
area of the disrupted fat lobules on the recipient bed significantly
improved fat survival after injection. More recently, various authors
have proposed “ultra-micro” fat as a very superficial implant in the
periocular and perioral areas [113,114]. These newer techniques are
based on fat harvesting with Coleman's traditional cannulas, fol-
lowed by various modalities of fat processing to disrupt the large fat
lobules harvested [111e114]. Tonnard et al. [113] reported that
manual fat emulsification provides a nanofat solution rich in the
SVF and consequently ASCs, but devoid of viable adipocytes.
Consequently, the indications of nanofat are reportedly limited to
skin regeneration and do not include volume restoration [113,115].
In fact, it may be questioned whether a nanofat transfer actually is a
“fat grafting” procedure, as adipocytes did not survive the emulsi-
fication process.113 The major effect of nanofat injection is probably
a stem cell activity so nanofat injection might rather be considered
as an in vivo tissue-engineering process [113]. It might be logical to
discard the dead adipocyte fraction from the nanofat and to inject
the purified stromal vascular fraction only. Moreover, it is known
that apoptotic cells release cytokines and attract macrophages that
induce growth factors and play an important role in regeneration of
the damaged tissue 113 Thus, coinjection of fragmented adipocytes
might have a stimulating effect on stem cell differentiation and
tissue regeneration [113]. Aesthetically, the main surgical in-
dications of lipofilling for facial rejuvenation are the correction of
dark circles [116], as an adjuvant to blepharoplasty, or as an alter-
native treatment for hollow eyes and malar bags [113,117]. Fat
reinjection is an important step in the overall success of the graft.
Fat is injected in longitudinal tunnels that form a 3D mesh to
promote revascularization and graft survival, per Coleman's tech-
nique [110,117]. In the upper eyelids, fat grafting is generally used to
fill hollow eyelids. The injections are sometimes carried out in
conjunction with blepharoplasty [117,118]. The injection sites are
located at the medial 2/3 of the upper eyelid, the inferomedial 1/3
of the eyebrow, and the lateral part of the eyebrow [113,117]. In the
lower eyelids, fat grafting helps restore volume, including that of
the periorbital region. The injection points are located external to
the zygomatic bone [113,117,119] and in “the valley of tears”
[117,119]. In these areas, injections should not be administered
between the skin and muscle, as the skin here is thin and such
injections may lead to palpable irregularities [110,117]. A greater
understanding of facial aging mechanisms, consisting of fat atrophy
and ptosis of the different facial compartments, has allowed fat
grafting to be considered as a possible technique for facial rejuve-
nation, particularly of the eyelids [117].
6.6.2. Hand rejuvenation
The appearance of the hands is a tell-tale sign of a person's true
age [120,121]. Studies have shown that people are able to roughly
estimate a person's age solely by viewing their hands [120,122].
Extrinsic effects on the hand include dermatoheliosis and photo-
aging, which lead to wrinkles and irregular pigmentation in the
form
of
solar
lentigines,
solar
purpura,
punctuate
hypo-
pigmentation, actinic keratosis, seborrhoeic keratosis, and telan-
giectasia [120,123,124]. Aging also leads to intrinsic effects such as
the gradual disappearance of subcutaneous fullness and tissue at-
rophy due to collagen depletion and dehydration [125e127]. This
leads to dorsal skin wrinkling and greater visibility of the extensor
tendons, and makes subcutaneous veins appear more blue and
tortuous [120,121,128,129]. Because fat not only serves as a filler but
also has the regenerative potential to improve the quality of soft
tissue and skin on the dorsal side of the hands, fat grafting is an
attractive procedure for hand rejuvenation [24]. Under local
anaesthesia, the fat graft is injected using blunt cannulas to reduce
the risk of dorsal vein perforation. Between 10 and 30 mL of fat
should be injected to give the hand a puffy, slightly overfilled look.
A small volume of fat tissue should also be injected at the base of
each finger, to give a uniform appearance to the whole hand [120].
6.6.3. Rhinoplasty
Patients who elect to undergo augmentation rhinoplasty often
present with concerns of a low dorsum and a short nose [130]. Both
autologous grafts and synthetic implants can result in acceptable
outcomes of rhinoplasty. In general, synthetic implants are asso-
ciated with higher rates of complications, such as displacement and
extrusion. Coleman [2,24] emphasized that structural fat grafting to
regions with thin skin, such as the periorbital area, must involve the
delivery of minute fat parcels. The nasal dorsum is characterized by
relatively thin skin and limited space so the implantation of large
fat parcels is more likely to lead to dislodgement of the implant,
nodulation, and skin irregularities [130]. Therefore, often, autolo-
gous microfat transplantation is used to correct the profile of the
nose [130].
6.6.4. Breast augmentation and asymmetry
Initially, fat grafting was considered to be a promising technique
for breast augmentation and correction of breast asymmetry
because of advantages such as easy availability of donor tissue,
absence of a scar, and short recovery time. Moreover, because the
procedure could be performed in an outpatient setting and avoided
the complications of prostheses, it gained significant initial popu-
larity [131]. However, the value of this technique in augmenting
breasts and filling breast defects became controversial because the
results are not always sustainable. In a historical review, Billings
et al. [132] reported that the results of free fat transplantation are
unpredictable, with wide variation in the bulk of the graft, the
possibility of fat resorption, and the necessity of other lipofilling
techniques. Although fat grafting for primary breast augmentation
had a “bad reputation” in the past, the procedure itself has gained
more popularity recently and is being performed more and more by
plastic surgeons worldwide for primary breast augmentation
[74,133,134]. There are adequate studies in the literature to support
the efficacy and safety of fat grafting for primary breast augmen-
tation [75,132,134,135]. In fact, fat graft transplantation will prob-
ably replace most of the current techniques for the correction of
breast asymmetry [133,136], especially less-significant breast
asymmetries. Breast augmentation with implants, mastopexy, and

55
 breast reduction will continue to play a role in the correction of
significant breast asymmetry [133].
6.6.5. Gluteal augmentation
Gluteal augmentation is often performed by means of intra-
muscular implants, but lipofilling has begun to gain popularity in
recent times. Indeed, fat grafting involves the harvesting of fat from
unwanted areas, and this allows associating gluteal augmentation
with body contouring surgery. Fat grafting will play an important
role in gluteal augmentation and may replace implant-based
gluteal augmentation if the patient has a great enough amount of
fat as a donor material [133,137,138].
7. Complications
Every step in fat transplantation, i.e., harvesting, processing, and
transplantation, is important, but viability of the harvested fat cells
is crucial [139]. The chances of survival are higher the less the fat
graft is manipulated and the more quickly it is reinjected [140].
Donor-site complications appear to be minimal and related to the
liposuction technique. The possible complications include bruising,
swelling, haematoma formation, paraesthesia or donor-site pain,
infection, hypertrophic scarring, contour irregularities, and damage
to the underlying structures for example due to the intraperitoneal
or intramuscular penetration of the cannula [26,73,74,141e143].
Lipofilling of the breast could cause in the recipient site fat ne-
crosis, oil cyst formation, and calcification if large volumes of fat are
injected into a single area or if fat is injected into poorly vascular-
ized areas. These changes result in the failure of “graft take” and
lead to palpable masses due to fat necrosis. Moreover, these masses
may be difficult to distinguish clinically from local recurrence in
breast cancer patients and lead to a need for additional imaging and
needle biopsy in 3%e15% of patients [26,73,74,141e143]. Post-
lipofilling calcification can be found on mammograms in 0.7%e
4.9% of patients [26]. Agha et al. [144] in a review of 24 studies
reported 207 complications, 7,3% of 2832 treated breasts. Fat ne-
crosis accounted for 62% of all complications and occurred in 17 of
the 24 studies.
The complications of lipofilling for hand rejuvenation may
include cellulitis at the donor site [120], transient digital numbness
[145], infections at both the recipient and harvest sites [146], cyst
formation [146,147] in 10% of patients, temporary dysaesthesia
[146], fat necrosis [146,148], and reabsorption of the grafted fat
[121,147], which is the most common complication. In one study,
24% of patients required repeated fat injections [121].
The major complications of facial rejuvenation by lipofilling are
possibly attributable to the injection of fat grafts in “dangerous”
areas such as the glabella and nasolabial folds [117,149]. In fact, fat
grafts may cause cerebral or ocular artery thrombosis, with an in-
crease in local pressure, resulting in a reflux of the fat into the
ophthalmic artery and the internal carotid artery [117,149]. To limit
this risk and the risks of fat embolism and serious consequences,
verification of an absence of blood reflux into the syringe prior to
the injection, slow injection at low pressure, and the use of a blunt-
tip cannula are recommended [117,149]. When lipofilling is used to
correct the dorsum of the nose, surgeons should prevent a spike in
local pressure that could propel a fat parcel upstream to the
ophthalmic artery where it could occlude the central retinal artery
and cause visual disturbance or blindness [118,149e151].
8. Discussion
Fat injection has been used for more than 20 years as a relatively
low-risk and low-morbidity procedure to correct a variety of soft-
tissue defects in the face, trunk, and extremities. As with any
surgical procedure, the technique used, its execution, and the
experience of the surgeon affect the outcomes. In the case of breast
reconstruction, lipofilling can be used to improve soft-tissue
coverage following prosthesis or tissue expander implantation
and to achieve volume replacement of implants in patients with
unsatisfactory outcomes of oncoplastic reconstruction. Fat grafts
are easily available, biocompatible, associated with low donor-site
morbidity, and provide a natural appearance. However, fat graft-
ing is generally considered an unpredictable procedure [5], with
long-term retention rates varying between 10% and 80% [152,153].
Choi et al. [153] analysed volumetric data obtained using 3D im-
aging over a certain time course, and found that the breast tissue
has a resolution similar to that of soft-tissue oedema, and that
approximately 40%e50% of the injected fat volume was retained at
5 months after the procedure [153]. However adipose-derived stem
cells (ADSC), either isolated from fresh adipose tissues before ADSC
cryopreservation
or
isolated
from
cryopreserved
fat
tissues,
showed unaltered capabilities of proliferation and differentiation
after optimal cryopreservation protocols. This confirms the proba-
bility of ADSC in providing an important source for cell based
therapy and tissue engineering [154e156]. Successful cryopreser-
vation of adipose tissue and ADSC can lead to a new era in fat
grafting and ADSC-related tissue regeneration therapy in plastic
surgery [157e160]. In cosmetic breast surgery, lipofilling is a pop-
ular procedure and will probably replace most of the current
techniques for the correction of less-significant breast asymmetry
[134]. However, breast augmentation with implants, mastopexy,
and breast reduction will continue to play a role in the correction of
important breast asymmetry [134,137].
Rohrich et al. have classed it as number three in the list of top
innovations in plastic surgery [161]. Agha et al. recently published a
systematic review and meta-analysis of this topic and demon-
strated the utility of this technique as assessed across six outcome
domains; oncological, clinical, aesthetic and functional, patient-
reported, process and radiological [162,163]. Whilst conducting
the review they noticed significant heterogeneity in the outcomes
used by the various study authors. Further analysis of the 35 studies
in follow-up work identified that there were a total of 51 different
outcomes reported [162,164]. Their objective is to develop a core
outcome set (COS) for autologous fat grafting to the breast. It would
result in improvements in the conduct and reporting of autologous
fat grafting research and help to minimize outcome and reporting
bias, standardise end-points, boost transparency, increase repro-
ducibility and external validity, aid evidence synthesis and help
guide clinical decision-making going forward [162].
Nasal lipofilling has become a particularly interesting alterna-
tive for the treatment patients who have previously undergone
rhinoplasty, especially those who refuse secondary invasive sur-
gery. The ideal indications for nasal lipofilling are small defects such
as lateral osteotomy sequelae or inverted V deformations, partic-
ularly in young subjects. Injection of autologous fat is an interesting
technique for the improvement of the quality of the skin on the
nasal dorsum, especially if it is thin and cicatricial. Thus, another
indication for microfat injection could be the augmentation of nasal
cutaneous material with the intention of performing secondary
rhinoplasty [165,166].
Lipofilling can be effectively used to correct burn scars and
radiodermatitis and for the rejuvenation of the face or hands,
owing to the regenerative properties of ASCs [85,167]. In fact, ASCs
in fat grafts allow the regeneration of damaged tissues through
their paracrine, immunomodulatory, chemotactic, and differenti-
ating effects. When injected in burned or scarred areas, these cells
reduce tissue contraction, improve skin texture, and relieve pain
[85,156]. In radiodermatitis, ASCs promote the regeneration of
healthy tissue at the expense of the radio-damaged tissues [99].
F. Simonacci et al. / Annals of Medicine and Surgery 20 (2017) 49e60
56
 ASCs also help reverse the effects of photoaging via regeneration of
the microcirculation and collagen by means of the release of
growth factors [156].
9. Conclusions
Lipofilling can be used in various fields of plastic surgery due to
its filler and regenerative effects, with minimal discomfort for the
patient. However, one of the fundamental limitations is that the
amount of the fat graft is strictly linked to the amount of adipose
tissue in the patients. The role of lipofilling could be more signifi-
cant with the application of the findings of experimental research
on tissue engineering and ASCs.
