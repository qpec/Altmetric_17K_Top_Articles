IMPORTANCE A growing body of evidence supports a link between androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT) and cognitive dysfunction, including Alzheimer disease. However, it is
currently unknown whether ADT may contribute to the risk of dementia more broadly.
OBJECTIVE To use an informatics approach to examine the association of ADT as a treatment
for prostate cancer with the subsequent development of dementia (eg, senile dementia,
vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer dementia).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cohort study, a text-processing method was used
to analyze electronic medical record data from an academic medical center from 1994 to
2013, with a median follow-up of 3.4 years (interquartile range, 1.0-7.2 years). We identified
9455 individuals with prostate cancer who were 18 years or older at diagnosis with data
recorded in the electronic health record and follow-up after diagnosis. We excluded 183
patients with a previous diagnosis of dementia. Our final cohort comprised 9272 individuals
with prostate cancer, including 1826 men (19.7%) who received ADT.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We tested the effect of ADT on the risk of dementia using
propensity score–matched Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan-Meier
survival analysis.
RESULTS Among 9272 men with prostate cancer (mean [SD] age, 66.9 [10.9] years; 5450
[58.8%] white), there was a statistically significant association between use of ADT and risk
of dementia (hazard ratio, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.58-2.99; P < .001). In sensitivity analyses, results
were similar when excluding patients with Alzheimer disease (hazard ratio, 2.32; 95% CI,
1.73-3.12; P < .001). The absolute increased risk of developing dementia among those who
received ADT was 4.4% at 5 years (7.9% among those who received ADT vs 3.5% in those
who did not receive ADT). Analyses stratified by duration of ADT found that individuals with
at least 12 months of ADT use had the greatest absolute increased risk of dementia (hazard
ratio, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.64-3.38; P < .001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that ADT users
70 years or older had the lowest cumulative probability of remaining dementia free (log-rank
P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Androgen deprivation therapy in the treatment of prostate
cancer may be associated with an increased risk of dementia. This finding should be further
evaluated in prospective studies.

orldwide there are approximately 1.1 million new di-
agnoses of prostate cancer each year.1 Androgen de-
privationtherapy(ADT),whichisusedtolowermale
androgensgiventheandrogendependenceofprostatecancer,is
a mainstay of treatment for both metastatic and locoregional
disease.2,3 In recent decades, the use of ADT has increased
dramatically,4 with 500 000 males currently receiving ADT for

cancerinindustrializednationsusingADTduringtheirlifetime.6
Androgendeprivationtherapyhasademonstratedsurvival

association of ADT and Alzheimer disease11 given the demon-
strated effect of androgens and ADT on accumulation of
β-amyloidprotein.12However,androgenshavebeenalsoshown
to aid in neuron growth and axonal regeneration.13 In addition,
both low testosterone levels and ADT increase the risk of car-
diometabolic diseases,8,14 which are known risk factors for all-
cause dementia.15 Therefore, while ADT may specifically in-
crease the risk of Alzheimer disease, it may also contribute to
theriskofdementiamorebroadlythroughdistinctmechanisms.
Examination of the association between ADT and risk of
general dementia is critical to more fully understand the ef-
fect of ADT on neurodegenerative diseases. Given that Alzhei-
merdiseaseaccountsforonlyaportionoftheestimated35mil-
lion individuals with dementia worldwide,16 an association
between ADT and dementia may have significant public health
implications. In this study, we use an informatics approach,
analyzing electronic medical record data from more than 1.2
million patients, to examine the association of ADT with the
subsequent development of dementia (eg, senile dementia,
vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and Alzheimer
dementia) among men with prostate cancer.
Methods
Data Source
WeuseddatafromtheStanfordUniversityhealthsystem(1994-
2013) accessed under a protocol approved by the Stanford Hu-
man Subjects Research Institutional Review Board, which
waived the requirement for patient consent as the data mining
studies were deemed not to involve human participants. This
studyincludeddatafor1.2millionpatientsrepresenting19mil-
lionencounters,35millioncodedInternationalClassificationof
Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnoses, and a combination
of pathologic studies, radiologic images, and transcription re-
ports totaling more than 11 million unstructured clinical notes.
We used a previously validated17 and implemented11,18 text-
processing method to analyze clinical data. Briefly, we ex-
tracted ICD-9 diagnosis and Current Procedural Terminology
(CPT)codes,medicationlists,andpositive-presentmentionsof
drug and disease concepts from all clinical notes. We removed
uninformativephrasesbasedontermfrequencyanalysisofmore
than50millionclinicaldocuments19andsuppressedtermshav-
ingfewerthan4charactersbecausemostofthesetermsaream-
biguous abbreviations. We used NegEx regular expressions to
flag negative mentions (eg, “ruled out prostate cancer”) and to
determine if a term was mentioned in the history or family his-
tory section of the clinical note.20 The result is a list of present,
positive mentions of biomedical concepts, which are con-
verted into a patient-feature matrix for analysis.

Key Points
Questions Is there evidence of an association between use of
androgen deprivation therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer
and future dementia and can applied clinical informatics tools help
identify relevant population cohorts?
Findings This cohort study applied a novel text-processing
analytic approach to the electronic medical records of 9272
individuals with prostate cancer. There was a statistically
significant association between androgen deprivation therapy and
increased risk of dementia.
Meaning Future prospective studies are needed to further
investigate the association of androgen deprivation therapy and
risk of dementia.

used. A history of stroke was determined using data only prior
to prostate cancer diagnosis.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
All individuals with prostate cancer who were 18 years or older
at diagnosis with data in the electronic health record were eli-
gible for study inclusion. Patients with exposure to ADT were
included only if they had follow-up after initiation of ADT. To
control for differential frequency of follow-up, patients with-
out exposure to ADT were included only if they had fol-
low-up visits after the median time to use of ADT in the ex-
posed group. Patients with a previous diagnosis of dementia
were excluded. Individuals who received ADT but developed
dementia before starting ADT were also excluded.
Statistical Analysis
For all analyses, the start of the follow-up period was defined
as either the initiation of ADT or, for those who did not re-
ceive ADT, the time of prostate cancer diagnosis plus the me-
dian time to use of ADT in our study. The end of the follow-up
period was that of the last available record, either inpatient or
outpatient, or the time of dementia diagnosis. Baseline pa-
tient characteristics were compared for those receiving ADT
and those not receiving ADT using a t test or χ2 test.
Hazardratios(HRs)werecalculatedusingpropensityscore–
matched and traditional multivariable adjusted Cox propor-
tionalhazardsregressionmodelstotesttheeffectofADTonrisk

matching without replacement. Variables included in propen-
sityscorematchingandintraditionalmultivariableadjustedCox
proportional hazards regression analyses included age at pros-
tatecancerdiagnosis;race/ethnicity;smokingstatus;useofan-
tiplatelet, anticoagulant, antihypertensive, and statin medica-
tions; and a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke,
ormalignantneoplasms.Variablesassociatedwithcardiometa-
bolic disease and age were included as they have been shown
to increase risk of dementia15,22 and, along with prior malig-
nant neoplasms, may contribute to patients’likelihood of re-
ceiving radiotherapy and therefore ADT, if, for example, they
are poor candidates for surgery. We additionally accounted for
race/ethnicity, given known racial/ethnic disparities in stage at
diagnosis and access to definitive cancer treatment.23,24
Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to examine the
cumulative probability of remaining dementia free in the pro-
pensity score–matched and unmatched cohorts. Kaplan-
Meier curves were compared in the propensity score–
matched and unmatched cohorts using the log-rank test for
equality. We calculated the cumulative probability of devel-
oping dementia at 5 years using the Kaplan-Meier method in
thepropensityscore–matchedcohort.ThedurationofADTuse
was also tested for association with risk of dementia. Specifi-
cally, we examined risk of dementia among those with fewer
than 12 months of ADT use and 12 months or more of ADT use
compared with those not receiving ADT using Cox propor-
tional hazards regression models in the propensity score–
matched cohort. We additionally conducted a test for trend of
the risk of dementia with increasing duration of use of ADT
across categories (ie, no use, <12 months or ≥12 months).
We examined the effect of ADT on dementia according to
age at diagnosis. We also stratified our analysis with age 70
years selected as the cutoff, given recommendations for com-
prehensivegeriatricassessmentofallpatientswithcancerwho
are 70 years or older.25-27 Propensity score–matched Kaplan-
Meier curves were compared using log-rank tests for (1) those
younger than 70 years who did not use ADT, (2) ADT users
younger than 70 years, (3) those 70 years or older who did not
use ADT, and (4) ADT users 70 years or older. A test for inter-
action was conducted between age and ADT using the Wald
test. We additionally calculated the cumulative probability of
developingdementiaat5yearsusingtheKaplan-Meiermethod
in the age-stratified propensity score–matched cohort.
We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding men who re-
ceived chemotherapy, given evidence for chemotherapy-
associated cognitive dysfunction28 in addition to excluding de-
mentiadiagnoseswithinthefirst2yearsoffollow-uptocontrol
for inclusion of prevalent disease diagnosed after study entry.

Finally,weevaluatedwhetheranassociationbetweenADTand

cally, we selected 3 outcomes to test for association with ADT
with no known or hypothesized association: tuberculosis, al-
lergic rhinitis, and abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Cox proportional hazards regression assumptions were
evaluated by Schoenfeld residuals tests. Tests were consid-
ered significant with a 2-sided P < .05. Analyses were per-
formed using Stata, version 12.0 (StataCorp), and R, version 3.2
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

In sensitivity analyses, results were similar when exclud-
ing individuals who received chemotherapy (HR, 2.35; 95% CI,
1.82-3.03; P < .001), when excluding patients diagnosed with
dementiawithinthefirst2yearsofeligiblefollow-up(HR,2.39;
95%CI,1.78-3.21;P < .001),andwhenexcludingthosewithAlz-
heimer disease (HR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.73-3.12; P < .001). Sub-
group analysis adjusted for Gleason score demonstrated simi-
lar results (HR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.46-3.22; P < .001). The results
of the falsification analyses (eTable 4 in the Supplement)
showed no statistically significant associations. Schoenfeld re-
siduals tests demonstrated that the Cox proportional hazards
regression assumption was met for all models.
Discussion
We used an informatics-based approach to demonstrate an as-
sociation between the use of ADT in the treatment of prostate
cancer and an increased risk of dementia. We support this as-
sociation using both propensity score–matched and tradi-
tionalmultivariableregressionmodelsadjustedforawiderange
of potential confounding factors. We show a dose-response ef-
fect between greater duration of use of ADT and increased risk
of dementia. Finally, we find that use of ADT increases the risk
ofdementiaregardlessofage,butthatoldermenreceivingADT
were the least likely to remain dementia free.
Previous studies have shown that systemic cancer treat-
ments have a detrimental effect on cognitive function.9,30 An-
drogen deprivation therapy in particular has been linked with
impairments in visuomotor and executive functioning.10,31 In
a prospective evaluation, men treated with ADT were more
likely to demonstrate impaired cognitive performance as early
as 6 months after starting ADT compared with matched
controls.9 Men diagnosed with dementia have demonstrated
reduced levels of testosterone, including prior to onset of
dementia.32-34 Among men with Alzheimer disease, testoste-
rone supplementation has been shown to improve spatial and
verbal memory.35 However, a previous study showed an as-
sociation between a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
agonistandadecreasedriskofdeathfromAlzheimerdisease.36
This study extends previous work showing an associa-
tion between ADT and Alzheimer disease.11 That study focused
on Alzheimer disease given specific mechanisms to explain an
association with ADT. Androgens may affect the risk of Alz-
heimerdiseasethroughmodulationofaccumulationofβ-amy-
loid protein with use of ADT in the treatment of prostate can-
cer having been shown to increase circulating levels of
β-amyloid protein.12 In addition, the combination of cardio-
vascular disease and possession of the ε4 allele of the apoli-
poprotein E gene (OMIM 107741) may directly interact to
increase risk of Alzheimer disease.37
However,thereareseveralplausiblemechanismsthatmay
explain an association between ADT and dementia in gen-
eral.Androgenshaveademonstratedroleinneuronhealthand
growth.13 Testosterone analogues have shown neuroprotec-
tive effects directly through their interaction with androgen
receptors.38 Testosterone also may be converted to estrogen,
which has well-defined neuroprotective properties.39 Low tes-
tosterone levels and ADT also have been shown to increase the
risk of cardiometabolic diseases,8,14 which are also known risk

The cumulative probabilities of developing dementia at 5 years were 13.7%,
6.6%, 2.3%, and 1.0% among those 70 years or older who received androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT), those 70 years or older who did not receive ADT,
those younger than 70 years who received ADT, and those younger than 70
years who did not receive ADT, respectively. Each curve was independently
statistically significantly different from all other curves (P < .05).

factors for dementia.15 Finally, previous studies have sug-
gested that carriers of polymorphisms in certain genes may be
at an increased risk of cancer and cognitive changes associ-
ated with cancer treatment.40,41
Examination of the association between ADT and all-
cause dementia more fully characterizes the effect of ADT on
neurocognitive function. In our study, Alzheimer disease ac-
counted for only 30% of dementia cases, and sensitivity analy-
ses excluding these patients supported a strong association be-
tween ADT and dementia not associated with Alzheimer
disease. In addition, we found a clinically meaningful 7.1% ab-
solute increased risk of dementia at 5 years among patients 70
years or older who received ADT. An association between use
of ADT and dementia in general may therefore have signifi-
cant public health implications.
Limitations
This study has limitations that warrant consideration. We used
clinical text documentation and billing codes to determine di-
agnosis of dementia, which may introduce bias into our analy-
sis. We therefore used established methods in accessing ad-
ministrative health data for dementia diagnosis.21 Patients also
maybemorelikelytoreceivedefinitiveradiotherapyandthere-
fore ADT if they are poor candidates for surgery secondary to
medicalcomorbidities,suchascardiometabolicdiseases,which
are also risk factors for dementia.35 Therefore, we adjusted for
a range of comorbidities and conducted propensity score–
matched analyses. More important, in this study, we were not
sufficiently powered to undertake subgroup analysis by type
of ADT. Given that the various forms of ADT have complex ef-
fects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, future stud-
ies should prioritize stratification by type of ADT.
A further limitation is that we were only able to adjust for
characteristics specific to prostate cancer (ie, Gleason score)
in a subset of patients. However, adjustment for Gleason score
in the subgroup of patients with available data continued to
show a statistically significant association between use of ADT
and risk of dementia. Similarly, we were unable to reliably de-
lineateuseofADTinthesettingofdefinitivevsmetastaticpros-
tate cancer. Future studies should examine the effect of use
of ADT on risk of dementia in the setting of definitive pros-
tate cancer, in particular, among men for whom the benefit of
ADT may be unclear. Our analysis, while in a general popula-
tion cohort, was limited to a single institution and therefore
may not be generalizable to all individuals. Finally, our analy-
sis was retrospective and does not establish a causal associa-
tion between the use of ADT and risk of dementia.
Conclusions
As survival rates following cancer diagnoses continue to im-
prove, the population of older, long-term cancer survivors is
expected to increase.42 Therefore, the chronic health impli-
cations of cancer therapies will become of increasing impor-
tance. Here, we demonstrate an association between the use
of ADT and increased risk of dementia in a general popula-
tioncohortofmenwithprostatecancer.Ourstudyextendspre-
vious work supporting an association between use of ADT and
Alzheimer disease and suggests that ADT may more broadly
affect neurocognitive function. This finding should be inves-
tigated in prospective studies given significant individual pa-
tient and health system implications if there are higher rates
ofdementiaamongthelargegroupofpatientsundergoingADT.

Observational Cohort Studies and the Challenges

In this issue of JAMA Oncology, an investigation by Nead and
colleagues1 describes an association between use of andro-

men.Ofthe1826menwhore-
ceived androgen deprivation
therapy from 1994 to 2013,
the increased absolute risk of
dementia in those who received androgen deprivation therapy
was 4.4% at 5 years. The authors conducted an observational
cohort study and derived their cohort data elements from
words, or patterns of words, found in more than 11 million
largely unstructured clinical notes and reports from patho-
logic studies, radiologic images, and transcriptions. Al-
though the article provides details about the methods used to
derive these data elements, the authors rely on eTables in the
Supplement and references to the peer-reviewed literature to
provide the reader with assurance about these methods that
may be relatively unfamiliar to some audiences.
The process of extracting structured and meaningful sig-
nals from less structured raw data is called natural language
processing.2,3 This process permits the creation of study co-
horts and the completion of in silico experiments (those con-
