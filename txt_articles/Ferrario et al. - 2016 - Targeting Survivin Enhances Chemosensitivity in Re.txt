Abstract
Treatments for retinoblastoma (Rb) vary depending on the size and location of the intraocu-
lar lesions and include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. We examined whether agents
used to treat Rb induce a pro-survival phenotype associated with increased expression of
survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family of proteins. We document that expo-
sure to carboplatin, topotecan or radiation resulted in elevated expression of survivin in two
human Rb cell lines but not in normal retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells. Cellular levels
of survivin were attenuated in Rb cells exposed to an imidazolium-based survivin suppres-
sant, Sepantronium bromide (YM155). Protein expression patterns of survivin in RPE cells
were not altered following treatment protocols involving exposure to YM155. Including
YM155 with chemotherapy or radiation increased levels of apoptosis in Rb cells but not in
RPE cells. Intraocular luciferase expressing Rb tumors were generated from the Rb cell
lines and used to evaluate the effects of carboplatin and YM155 on in-vivo survivin expres-
sion and tumor growth. Carboplatin induced expression of survivin while carboplatin com-
bined with YM155 reduced survivin expression in tumor bearing eyes. The combination
protocol was also most effective in reducing the rate of tumor regrowth. These results indi-
cate that targeted inhibition of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin provides a therapeutic
advantage for Rb cells and tumors treated with chemotherapy.
Introduction
Retinoblastoma (Rb) is the most common pediatric intraocular malignancy with an incidence
of approximately 1 in 17,000 births [1]. The heritable form of Rb accounts for 40% of all cases,
usually occurs during the first year of life, and most often presents as bilateral disease. The spo-
radic form of the disease accounts for the remaining 60% of cases, normally occurs between

 ages 2 and 5, and usually presents in only one eye [1–3]. Treatments for Rb depend on the size
and location of the lesions and include local ablative procedures for small lesions and chemo-
therapeutic protocols for advanced disease [2]. External beam radiotherapy and plaque brachy-
therapy are now primarily used following disease recurrence. There is also an increased risk of
secondary tumors following radiation in patients with the hereditary form of Rb [3]. Chemo-
therapy regimens include the intravenous administration of carboplatin, vincristine and etopo-
side and are combined with focal laser consolidation (i.e. chemoreduction) [3]. Additional
chemotherapeutic agents, including topotecan, and single agent carboplatin plus novel drug
delivery methods such as subconjunctival, ophthalmic artery, and intravitreal administration,
are emerging as clinical options [4–7]. The overall survival of Rb patients and the tumor
responsiveness of current treatments are excellent. However, tumor recurrences frequently
lead to enucleations and there are ongoing concerns regarding both short and long term side
effects from current therapies [6–11].
Survivin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) [12]. This 16.5 kDa pro-
tein is expressed in numerous cancers but is absent or minimally present in most terminally
differentiated normal tissues [12]. Survivin is involved in a variety of cellular functions includ-
ing cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis [13]. Increased levels of survivin are asso-
ciated with poor prognosis, cell proliferation, and metastasis in many malignancies [14,15].
Elevated tumor survivin levels are also associated with chemotherapy and radiation resistance
[16,17]. Exposure of pancreatic and gastric tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy
can increase survivin expression [18,19]. Survivin is reported in the aqueous humor and serum
of Rb patients [20].
A variety of approaches, including antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA, ribozymes, immuno-
therapy, and small molecular weight inhibitors, are being tested in survivin targeting protocols
with the goal of improving tumor treatment outcomes [21]. Knockdown of survivin expression
by siRNAs enhance chemosensitivity and induces apoptosis in prostate and breast cancer cell
lines [22,23]. The imidazolium-based agent, Sepantronium bromide (YM155), exerts anti-
tumor activity via inhibition of survivin expression at both the mRNA and protein levels
[24,25]. YM155 sensitizes non-small cell lung cancer cells to radiation and platinum-based
drugs and enhances docetaxel toxicity of human melanoma cells via down-regulation of survi-
vin expression and increased apoptosis [26–28]. In addition, YM155 also promotes DNA dam-
age and autophagy [29]. Clinical trials using YM155 with and without chemotherapeutic
agents have been reported [30–32]. The survivin suppressant has been well tolerated and stud-
ies have not identified normal ocular tissue toxicity.
In the current study we hypothesize that Rb treatments induce a pro-survival phenotype
associated with increased survivin expression and targeting survivin with YM155 enhances the
efficacy of current Rb treatments. Experiments examined the role of YM155 in modulating the
expression of survivin as well as apoptosis in Rb and retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells
following treatment with carboplatin, topotecan or ionizing radiation. We also used orthotopic
intraocular luciferase expressing Rb tumors to evaluate the effects of carboplatin and YM155
on in-vivo survivin expression and tumor growth. Our results indicate that targeted inhibition
of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin provides a therapeutic advantage for Rb cells and
tumors.

 Selleck Chemical Co, LTD (Houston, TX). The drug was dissolved in ddH2O to make a 10 μM
stock solution and frozen at -20°C until used. Stock solutions were diluted to a working con-
centration of 2 nM in culture medium prior to cell culture experiments. For in-vivo experi-
ments, YM155 was dissolved in ddH2O to make a 2.5 mg/ml stock solution. The drug was
diluted 1 to 10 in saline and administered IP to achieve a 2 mg/kg treatment dose. Carboplatin
was purchased from Teva Parenteral Medicines, Inc. (Irvine, CA). A stock solution at 10 mg/
ml was stored at room temperature, and diluted to a working concentration of 5 μM in culture
medium immediately prior to cell culture experiments. For in-vivo experiments, an aliquot of
the stock solution was administered IP to mice to achieve a 60 mg/kg treatment dose. Topote-
can hydrochloride was purchased from APP Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Schaumburg, IL). The
drug was dissolved in ddH2O to make a 10 μM stock solution and frozen at -20°C until used.
Stock solutions of topotecan were diluted to a working concentration of 10 nM in culture
medium prior to cell culture experiments. D-luciferin was purchased from Promega Scientific
(Madison, WI), dissolved in sterile PBS to make a 5 mg/ml stock solution, and kept at -20°C
until used.
Cell Lines and Treatment Protocols
Human Rb (Y79) cells (ATCC number HTB-18) and human retinal pigmented epithelial
(RPE) cells (ATCC number CRL-2240) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). A primary human Rb cell line (CHLA-215), obtained at the time of enucle-
ation, was provided by the Children’s Oncology Group Cell Culture/Xenograft Repository.
Western immunoblot analysis for Rb, phospho-Rb, and survivin expression confirmed that Rb
and phospho-Rb expression was observed only in the RPE cells while basal survivin expression
was observed in all cell lines (S1 Fig). Y79 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and streptomy-
cin). CHLA-215 cells were cultured in IMDM medium supplemented with 20% FCS, ITS
(insulin, transferrin, and selenium) culture supplement, and antibiotics. RPE cells were cul-
tured in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 20% FBS and antibiotics. Firefly luciferase
expressing Y79 and CHLA-215 Rb cells (Y79-Luc and CHLA-215-Luc) under the control of a
CMV promoter were obtained by transducing parental cells with the pCCL-c-MNDU3c-LUC
packaged lentiviral vector (gift from Robert Seeger, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles) [33].
Cells were cloned by serial dilution in 96 well plates and checked for luciferase expression by
bioluminescence imaging following administration of 25 μg D-luciferin. Clones with high lev-
els of bioluminescence were selected, grown out, and used to produce Y79-Luv and CHLA-
215-Luc xenografts.
In Vitro Treatments and Assays
Cells were seeded in either 96 well plates to measure cytotoxicity or 100 mm Petri dishes to
monitor apoptosis and protein expression. Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were exposed
to ionizing radiation (5 Gy) from a Cs-137 gamma irradiator, carboplatin (5 μM) or topotecan
(10 nM). Cells were exposed to carboplatin or topotecan for 48 hours. When indicated, the
cells were also incubated with YM155 (2 nM) for 72 hours, starting at the time they were
seeded into culture plates or dishes. YM155, carboplatin and topotecan remained in the culture
media until the cells were collected and analyzed for survival, apoptosis or protein expression.
Cell viability was evaluated using a WST-1 (2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazo-
lium, monosodium salt) cell proliferation assay (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) as
per manufacturer’s instructions. Plates were read using a MR600 microplate reader (Dynatech,
Golden Valley, MN) at 450 nM. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by FACS

 analysis (S2 Fig) using the FITC Annexin V Dead Cell Apoptosis Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA) as per manufacturers instructions. Caspase-3 activity was measured using the
Caspase-3 Colorimetric Assay Kit, catalog number BF3100, from R&D Systems, Inc., Minneap-
olis, MN. Protein expression profiles were documented by Western immunoblot analysis [34].
Cells were collected at specified times and sonicated in 1X cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Tech-
nology, Danvers, MA) containing 1μM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).
Samples were size-separated on discontinuous gradient polyacrylamide gels (8–16%) and
transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membranes. Filters were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat
dry milk and then incubated overnight with either mouse monoclonal anti-survivin (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or rabbit polyclonal antibody to x-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis (XIAP). Filters were then incubated with either an anti-mouse or an anti-rabbit per-
oxidase conjugate (Sigma) and the resulting complexes were visualized by enhanced chemilu-
minescence autoradiography (Amersham Life Science, Chicago, IL). Protein loading was
evaluated by incubating the same filters with a mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (MP
Biochemicals, Aurora, OH). Autoradiographs were quantified by scanning densitometry.
In-vivo Treatments
Y79-Luc (2 X 103) and CHLA-215-Luc cell clones (4 x 104) in 4 μl of RPMI medium were
injected into the posterior ocular chamber of the right eye of Nu/Nu mice (Jackson Laboratory,
Bar Harbor, ME) using sterile 25 μl glass syringes fitted with 30 gauge needles (Hamilton,
Reno, NV). Prior to each procedure, mice underwent inhalation anesthesia using isoflurane,
and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Tumor size was monitored by biolumines-
cence imaging following the ip administration of D-luciferin (150 mg/kg) using a cooled IVIS
Animal Imaging System (Xenogen, Alameda, CA) coupled to the Living Image 2.5 software.
Imaging was initiated 15 minutes after D-luciferin injection. Luminescence was expressed in
photons/sec/cm2/steradian (FLUX). Treatments were initiated 14 days post inoculation or
when the ocular luminescence signal was a minimum of 4 X 104 p/sec/cm2/sr for Y79-Luc and
CHLA-215-Luc lesions. Treatments consisted of three weekly cycles of carboplatin alone (60
mg/kg via ip injection delivered on days 2 and 5 of each cycle), YM155 alone (2 mg/kg via ip
injection delivered on days 1 through 5 of each cycle), or a combination of carboplatin and
YM155 administered as described above. Control mice received saline. Mice were examined
weekly using bioluminescence imaging to document tumor growth. Representative biolumi-
nescent images are shown for Y79-Luc and CHLA-215-Luc treated tumors (S3 Fig). Tumor
growth delay was documented for the fast growing Y79-Luc lesions by plotting tumor flux
(size) versus days post treatment. Long-term tumor response was documented for the slower
growing CHLA-215-Luc lesions by plotting the percent animals with tumor luminescence val-
ues less than 1.2 X 105 photons/sec/cm2/steradian. This value represented growth following
treatment but was below the allowed tumor volume requiring animal sacrifice. Tumors that
did not show growth by 90 days post treatment were considered cured. A second set of mice
were sacrificed after one treatment cycle and the tumor bearing eye enucleated, homogenized
with a polytron in 1X cell lysis buffer, and analyzed by Western immunoblot for protein
expression as described above. All animal experiments were performed according to a protocol
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee of Children’s Hospital Los
Angeles (CHLA-316-15).

Results
Survivin is increased in Rb cells following chemotherapy or radiation
treatments and is suppressed by YM155
We first examined survivin expression profiles in Rb and RPE cells exposed to chemotherapeu-
tic agents or radiation with or without concomitant exposure to the survivin suppressant
YM155. We also examined the expression profile of XIAP, another member of the family of
IAPs. Fig 1A (upper panel) shows representative Western immunoblots of survivin and XIAP
protein expression, and Fig 1A (lower panel) shows mean quantitative densimetric levels of
survivin in Y79 Rb cells. Basal levels of survivin and XIAP were detectable in non-treated cells
while exposure to carboplatin (5 μM), topotecan (10 nM), or radiation (5 Gy) only induced
increased survivin expression. Co-incubation with YM155 decreased survivin levels in Y79
cells exposed to the chemotherapeutic treatments or radiation. Identical treatment parameters,
using the primary Rb cell line CHLA-215, resulted in comparable expression profiles (Fig 1B).
We next examined the effects of carboplatin, topotecan and radiation on ocular RPE cells. Fig
1C shows minimal effects of the chemotherapeutic agents or radiation, in the presence or
absence of YM155, on survivin expression profiles for RPE cells. Expression of XIAP did not
change after single or combined treatment protocols in either Rb or RPE cells and this agrees

 with reports indicating that YM155 preferentially targets survivin and not other members of
the IAP family [26,27,35]. We did not observe changes in the subcellular distribution of survi-
vin following treatments (S4 Fig). Baseline expression of survivin appears high in this figure
and S1 Fig when compared to S5 Fig because of the extended film exposure time used for both
S1 and S4 Figs. These results demonstrate that therapies to treat retinoblastoma induce a pro-
survival phenotype associated with overexpression of survivin in Rb cells, and YM155 effec-
tively attenuates expression of survivin in Rb cells while having minimal effect in ocular RPE
cells.
YM155 increases apoptosis and decreases viability in Rb cells following
chemotherapy or radiation
Fig 2 show apoptotic (upper panels) and viability levels (lower panels) in the 3 ocular cell lines
(Y79, CHLA-215, and RPE) following exposure to YM155 alone and following exposure to car-
boplatin, topotecan, or radiation. The combination of YM155 with the individual chemothera-
peutic agents or radiation further increased apoptotic levels in Y79 cells (Fig 2A). Apoptotic
levels in CHLA-215 cells following combined treatments remained comparable to that induced
by YM155 alone (Fig 2B). RPE cells (Fig 2C) exhibited a minimal basal level of apoptosis but
did not undergo increased apoptosis following individual exposure to YM155 or chemotherapy
Fig 2. YM155 enhances apoptosis and decreases viability in Y79 (A) and CHLA-215 (B) Rb cells exposed to chemotherapy or radiation. YM155
decreased viability in RPE (C) cells and induced only a minimal apoptotic response in these cells following radiation. Percent apoptotic cells was determined
by FACS analysis of annexin V and PI stained cells either under control or treatment conditions described in Fig 1. Columns, mean; bars, ± SE of three to five
separate experiments. **P < 0.05 (Control vs CBDCA, TOPO, or Rad); *P < 0.05 (Control, CBDCA, TOPO or Rad in the absence of YM155 vs Control,

 (carboplatin or topotecan). A small increase in apoptosis was detected following radiation. We
observed enhanced PARP cleavage in both Rb cell lines but not in RPE cells (S6 Fig). Caspase 3
activation was observed only in the Y79 cells (S6 Fig). Fig 2 (lower panel) also shows that cell
viability, measured with the WST-1 assay, was significantly reduced when YM155 was com-
bined with either chemotherapy or radiation in the Rb cell lines. We determined combination
indexes using the method of Chou and Talalay (CompuSyn, Inc., computer program on Quan-
titation of Synergism and Antagonism in Drug Combinations) and viability data (S7 Fig and
S1 Table). Synergism was observed in Y79 cells when YM155 was combined with carboplatin,
topotecan, or radiation. For CHLA-215 cells, synergism was observed when YM155 was com-
bined with topotecan or radiation, while for RPE cells synergism was observed when YM155
was combined with radiation. Lower YM155 doses for the CHLA-215 cells could alter Chou
and Talalay synergy measurements because of the enhanced YM155 sensitivity of these cells.
Survivin expression increases in orthotopic Rb tumors following
carboplatin treatment
We next examined if Rb tumors growing in the posterior chamber of mouse eyes also exhibited
increased survivin levels when exposed to carboplatin, and whether systemic administration of
YM155 reduced survivin expression. Y79 and CHLA-215 cells expressing the luciferase gene
(Y79-Luc and CHLA-215-Luc) were transplanted to the posterior chamber of mouse eyes.
Mice were treated with carboplatin alone (60mg/kg) via IP injection on day 15 and again on
day 18 following transplantation, YM155 alone (2mg/kg) delivered via IP injection daily for 5
consecutive days starting on day 14, or the combination of carboplatin and YM155. Fig 3A
shows representative survivin expression (upper panel) measured by immunoblot analysis and
average densitometry measurements (lower panel) for mice with orthotopic Y79-Luc tumors.
Fig 3B shows comparable results for mice with orthotopic CHLA-215-Luc tumors. Eyes were
enucleated and processed 24 hours following the last treatment. Carboplatin treatment resulted
in a significant increase in survivin expression within Rb tumors compared to mice with non-
treated tumors. Eyes without tumors did not exhibit any survivin as expected. Mice receiving
both carboplatin and YM155 had survivin levels that were reduced back to basal levels. Data
for all examined mice is shown in S8 Fig. These results for orthotopic Rb tumors corroborate
our in-vitro data showing increased survivin expression in Rb cells exposed to carboplatin as
well as decreased survivin expression when carboplatin was combined with YM155. These
observations demonstrate excellent cohesiveness between our in-vitro and in-vivo Rb
experiments.
YM155 enhances carboplatin responsiveness in orthotopic Rb tumors
The tumoricidal effectiveness of combining YM155 with carboplatin was examined in our two
orthotopic Rb tumor models. Fig 4A shows tumor grow kinetics measured by intraocular
tumor induced bioluminescence flux for Y79-Luc lesions and Fig 4B shows length of time
CHLA-215-Luc tumors remained below a basal tumor size or bioluminescence flux (1.2 X 105
photons/sec/cm2/steradian). Growth of individual Rb tumors was measured weekly (S2–S4
Tables). The Y79-Luc tumor line grew at a faster rate than the CHLA-215-Luc tumor and yet
both tumor lines exhibited comparable trends. Treatment of mice with YM155 alone resulted
in comparable results to non-treated mice. Mice receiving carboplatin alone induced a measur-
able tumor growth delay or an extended time at a basal tumor size for the Y79-Luc and the
CHLA-215-Luc tumors, respectively. The combination of carboplatin and YM155 resulted in a
further delay in tumor growth compared to either carboplatin or YM155 alone. The in-vivo
experiments with Y79 or CHLA-215 tumors show trends toward enhanced effects but are not

 statistically significant by ANOVA analysis followed by Bonferroni post test for tumors treated
with carboplatin versus carboplatin plus YM155.
Discussion
Primary treatment for Rb shifted from external beam radiotherapy to chemotherapy in large
part to avoid the significant morbidity induced by ionizing radiation, including the induction
of second cancers. Treatment responsiveness also increased with this paradigm shift but the
chemotherapeutic agents currently used are associated with side effects such as neutropenia.
Therefore less toxic protocols and new drug delivery methods continue to be evaluated [36,37].
Intraocular tumor recurrences also occur in a significant percentage of patients with current
treatment approaches. Novel molecular targets are being examined for Rb with the objectives
of decreasing side effects by dose reduction of chemotherapeutic agents as well as by preferen-
tially enhancing Rb tumor cytotoxicity. Targeted molecules for Rb include the HDAC inhibitor
suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) [38], and the AMP-kinase activator,

 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-4-ribofuranaside (AICAR) [39]. Additionally,
MDMX and MDM2 proteins degrade the Rb and P53 protein products and a small molecule
inhibitor of MDMX and MDM2, Nutlin 3A, is cytotoxic to Rb cells and exhibits further cyto-
toxicity when combined with topotecan [40].
Our study documents, for the first time, that targeting the pro-survival molecule, survivin, is
an attractive option for Rb. We discovered survivin levels are increased in both established
(Y79) and primary (CHLA-215) Rb cell lines exposed to carboplatin, topotecan, and radiation.
We observed that a small molecule inhibitor of survivin, YM155, suppresses survivin in Rb
cells following treatment, decreases Rb cell viability, and enhances apoptosis. We also demon-
strated that survivin is induced when Y79 cells were exposed simultaneously to carboplatin and
topotecan, and reduced when YM155 was included (S5 Fig). In addition, YM155 down regu-
lated survivin induced by carboplatin in orthotopic Rb tumors, and the combination of carbo-
platin and YM155 enhanced in-vivo treatment responsiveness compared to single agent
protocols.
The three treatments used in our in vitro experiments are relevant to clinical Rb protocols.
Carboplatin is included in the chemoreduction protocol (carboplatin, etoposide and vincris-
tine) for Rb with most patients receiving 6 monthly cycles of this regimen [11,41]. Carboplatin
is also used as a single agent with novel ophthalmic delivery protocols for treating Rb [7].
Periocular topotecan is being investigated at a preclinical level for episcleral delivery and intra-
vitreal administration of topotecan is being used to target Rb seeds [42–44], as well as in com-
bination with carboplatin [45]. Radiation has a long history in Rb therapy but is now primarily
used for intraocular relapse [46]. Our interest in survivin developed as we observed increased
expression of this pro-survival molecule when Rb cells were exposed to these chemotherapeutic
agents or radiation. Survivin is negatively regulated, in part, by the Rb protein and this may
play a role in the up regulation of survivin and concomitant resistance observed in tumor cells
with non-functioning Rb genes [47]. Little has been reported regarding survivin and Rb. Survi-
vin is detected in the aqueous humor of Rb patients and levels correlate with tumor stage [20].
Rb cell proliferative activity is also positively correlated with survivin and HSP-90 expression
in clinical Rb histological specimens [48]. Survivin expression in 42 archival Rb tumors has
recently been reported with 86% (36/42) tumors showing survivin expression [49]. In contrast,
RPE cells did not exhibit significant changes in survivin levels or apoptosis in our experiments
and this agrees with a prior study reporting that RPE cells express low basal survivin and cas-
pase-8 levels [50]. Viability assays also demonstrated that RPE cells were more resistant than
Rb cells to carboplatin, topotecan, and YM155 (S9 Fig). In this case we used a 96 hr WST-1
time frame instead of the 48 hr WST-1 time frame used in Fig 2 and S7 Fig. Our results provide
strong evidence for targeting survivin as a strategy for Rb treatment protocols.
A large number of laboratories continue to examine methods of targeting survivin as an
adjunctive therapy in clinical and preclinical studies. Effective survivin inhibitors include anti-
sense oligonucleotides, small molecule inhibitors, and survivin targeting via cell based immu-
notherapy based vaccines [51]. We chose to use the small molecule inhibitor, YM155, in our
initial experiments. YM155 inhibits the survivin promoter and also induces direct DNA
Fig 4. Tumor responses for Y79-Luc (A) and CHLA-215-Luc (B) orthotopic tumors treated with YM155, CBDCA, or YM155 plus CBDCA. Treatments
consisted of three weekly cycles of CBDCA alone (60 mg/kg via ip injection delivered on days 2 and 5 of each cycle), YM155 alone (2 mg/kg via ip injection
delivered on days 1 through 5 of each cycle), or a combination of CBDCA and YM155 administered as described above. Control mice received saline. All
mice were examined weekly using bioluminescence imaging to document tumor growth. The bioluminescence values emitted from Y79-Luc ocular tumors
are plotted as a function of time following treatment and this correlates with the rate of growth for the intraocular lesions. For the slower growing CHLA-
215-Luc tumors, the percentage of tumors remaining at or below a basal level of bioluminescence flux (1.2 X 105 photons/sec/cm2/steradian) was plotted as
a function of time following treatment. N = 7–9 for treated lesions (CBDCA alone or CBDCA plus YM155), 3–8 for YM155 alone, and 4–6 for saline alone
controls.

 damage as measured by induction of gamma-H2AX and pKAP-1 expression in PC3 prostate
cancer cells [52]. We also observed enhanced pKAP1 expression in YM155 treated Rb cells
(data not shown). YM155 combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin was well tolerated but did
not increase treatment responsiveness in a non-randomized phase I/II trial of advanced non-
small cell lung cancer [53]. YM155 alone or in combination with an anti-CD52 monoclonal
antibody, alemtuzumab, were effective in adult T-cell leukemia with the combination showing
enhanced tumoricidal activity [54]. Clinical trials involving YM155 with docetaxel for stage III
and IV melanoma, refractory prostate CA, and metastatic breast cancer are in progress [55].
YM155 has a short half-life, which may contribute to the minimal clinical responsiveness
reported to date. A liposomal formulation of YM155 has been developed to address the short
half-life. Xenografts of human prostate tumors show enhanced pharmacokinetics, with signifi-
cantly increased peak YM155 levels and enhanced tumor and serum retention compared to the
parent YM155 compound. However, the extended retention in kidney will need to be further
evaluated for potential renal issues [56]. As regards pediatric tumors, a recent preclinical study
shows that a panel of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia cells exhibit significant sensitivity to
YM155 alone and in combination with cytarabine or daunorubicin via down regulation of sur-
vivin and concomitant increased apoptosis and DNA damage [57]. Promising new prosurvival
targeting compounds are also being reported. Recently, a novel small molecule camptothecin
derivative, FL118, was shown to strongly inhibit survivin as well as Mcl-1, XIAP, and CIAP2
and enhance tumoricidal responses in preclinical models [58].
In summary, we show YM155 increases radiosensitivity and chemo-sensitivity of Rb cells by
inhibiting survivin and enhancing apoptosis while there was minimal effect on normal RPE
cells. YM155 also enhanced the tumoricidal responsiveness of carboplatin in orthotopic Rb
tumors growing in the posterior chamber of mouse eyes. Combination treatment employing a
survivin inhibitor with currently used modalities may prove to be clinically beneficial by selec-
tively increasing overall tumor kill or possibly lowering the dose of chemotherapeutic agents
needed to effectively treat Rb lesions.
