Introduction
Non-communicable diseases are the commonest cause 
of death worldwide, and these diseases are mainly 
caused by unhealthy lifestyles.1 The contribution of 
socio 
economic deprivation to mortality risk is similar 
to that observed for some lifestyle factors (eg, physical 
inactivity).2 However, the relationships between life 
style 
factors, deprivation, and mortality remain unclear.

Summary
Background Combinations of lifestyle factors interact to increase mortality. Combinations of traditional factors such 
as smoking and alcohol are well described, but the additional effects of emerging factors such as television viewing 
time are not. The effect of socioeconomic deprivation on these extended lifestyle risks also remains unclear. We 
aimed to examine whether deprivation modifies the association between an extended score of lifestyle-related risk 
factors and health outcomes.
Methods Data for this prospective analysis were sourced from the UK Biobank, a prospective population-based cohort 
study. We assigned all participants an extended lifestyle score, with 1 point for each unhealthy lifestyle factor 
(incorporating sleep duration and high television viewing time, in addition to smoking, excessive alcohol, poor diet 
[low intake of oily fish or fruits and vegetables, and high intake of red meat or processed meats], and low physical 
activity), categorised as most healthy (score 0–2), moderately healthy (score 3–5), or least healthy (score 6–9). 
Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between lifestyle score and health outcomes 
(all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality and incidence), and whether this association was modified 
by deprivation. All analyses were landmark analyses, in which participants were excluded if they had an event (death 
or cardiovascular disease event) within 2 years of recruitment. Participants with non-communicable diseases (except 
hypertension) and missing covariate data were excluded from analyses. Participants were also excluded if they 
reported implausible values for physical activity, sleep duration, and total screen time. All analyses were adjusted for 
age, sex, ethnicity, month of assessment, history of hypertension, systolic blood pressure, medication for 
hypercholesterolaemia or hypertension, and body-mass index categories.
Findings 328 594 participants aged 40–69 years were included in the study, with a mean follow-up period of 4·9 years 
(SD 0·83) after the landmark period for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality, and 4·1 years (0·81) for 
cardiovascular disease incidence. In the least deprived quintile, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) in the least healthy 
lifestyle category, compared with the most healthy category, was 1·65 (95% CI 1·25–2·19) for all-cause mortality, 1·93 
(1·16–3·20) for cardiovascular disease mortality, and 1·29 (1·10–1·52) for cardiovascular disease incidence. Equivalent 
HRs in the most deprived quintile were 2·47 (95% CI 2·04–3·00), 3·36 (2·36–4·76), and 1·41 (1·25–1·60), 
respectively. The HR for trend for one increment change towards least healthy in the least deprived quintile compared 
with that in the most deprived quintile was 1·25 (95% CI 1·12–1·39) versus 1·55 (1·40–1·70) for all-cause mortality, 
1·30 (1·05–1·61) versus 1·83 (1·54–2·18) for cardiovascular disease mortality, and 1·10 (1·04–1·17) versus 1·16 
(1·09–1·23) for cardiovascular disease incidence. A significant interaction was found between lifestyle and deprivation 
for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality (both pinteraction<0·0001), but not for cardiovascular disease incidence 
(pinteraction=0·11).
Interpretation Wide combinations of lifestyle factors are associated with disproportionate harm in deprived 
populations. Social and fiscal policies that reduce poverty are needed alongside public health and individual-level 
interventions that address a wider range of lifestyle factors in areas of deprivation.

For example, although deprived populations have the 
highest prevalence of multiple co-occurring adverse 
lifestyle factors and the highest premature mortality,2,3 
the prevalence of lifestyle factors only partially explains 
the increased mortality associated with deprivation.4
Study of the synergistic interaction between lifestyle 
factors and deprivation might improve our understanding 
of the excess mortality associated with deprivation. For 
example, individuals from deprived groups have an 
increased risk of harm from the same amount of alcohol 
con 
sumed even after controlling for drinking patterns, 
body-mass index, and smoking.5 Similarly, deprived 
populations are disproportionately affected by the harmful 
effects of smoking and physical inactivity.6,7 Mechanisms 
underlying this disproportion 
ate lifestyle harm remain 
unclear but might include extremes of unhealthy lifestyle 
factors,8 interactions with other factors associated with 
deprivation (such as psychosocial stress),9 and reduced 
access to health services.10 However, previous studies of 
interactions between lifestyle factors and deprivation have 
examined only smoking, alcohol intake, and physical 
inactivity.5–7
Numerous individual lifestyle factors are associated 
with mortality; however, combinations of lifestyle factors 
interact synergistically, resulting in stronger associations 
with mortality.11 Evidence from the past 3 years has 
emphasised a role for emerging factors, such as sleep 
duration and television viewing time.12,13 Combining 
emerging and traditional factors (smoking, alcohol 
intake, physical activity, and diet) in extended lifestyle 
scores shows that a high proportion of deaths are due to 
modifiable factors and are therefore avoidable, high-
lighting new targets for public health intervention.14
To our knowledge, interactions between deprivation 
and extended combinations of lifestyle factors that 
include emerging factors have not been investigated. 
An understanding of how health outcomes associated 
with a broad combination of lifestyle factors vary with 
deprivation could inform future public health policy, 
highlighting new targets for individual-level and pop-
ulation-level interventions.
Our aim was to examine how deprivation affects the 
association between a previously devised extended life-
style score, which incorporates emerging and traditional 
lifestyle factors, and health outcomes (all-cause mortality, 
and cardiovascular disease mortality and incidence). We 
had two hypotheses: the health risk for individuals with an 
unhealthy lifestyle score increases disproportionately with 
increasing level of deprivation; and this disproportionate 
increase in risk is greater when lifestyle is measured by an 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed in October, 2017, for articles published in 
English between Sept 8, 2007, and Sept 8, 2017, using MeSH 
terms for “healthy lifestyle”, “life style”, “health behaviour”, 
“risk-taking”, “mortality”, and “socioeconomic factors”. 
Previous studies have shown disproportionate lifestyle-related 
harm in deprived groups associated with traditional lifestyle 
factors (eg, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical 
inactivity); however, none has examined more extensive 
combinations of lifestyle factors that include emerging lifestyle 
factors, such as sleep duration, sedentary time, or television 
viewing time. Combinations of lifestyle factors are known to 
interact synergistically to raise associated mortality and 
morbidity. The addition of emerging lifestyle factors to traditional 
lifestyle factor combinations has been shown to strengthen the 
association with mortality; however, the contribution of 
socioeconomic deprivation to lifestyle-related mortality is 
uncertain. Specifically, no study has examined how deprivation 
modifies the association between an extended combination of 
lifestyle factors and adverse health outcomes.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this prospective study is the first to 
investigate how socioeconomic deprivation affects the 
association between a broad combination of lifestyle factors, 
including newer emerging lifestyle factors, and adverse health 
outcomes. This study uses high-quality data from a large UK 
population cohort study with linked hospital admission and 
mortality data. We carried out landmark survival analyses and 
excluded participants with non-communicable diseases 
(but not those with hypertension) at baseline to reduce the 
chance of our results being attributable to reverse causality. 
We used the most conservative models to minimise the 
influence of important potential confounders. We found a 
significant interaction between an extended lifestyle score and 
socioeconomic deprivation that synergistically raised all-cause 
mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality (both 
pinteraction<0·0001), but not cardiovascular disease incidence 
(pinteraction=0·11).
Implications of all the available evidence
Lifestyle-related harm is a substantial and growing burden on 
society, but there is disproportionate lifestyle-related harm in 
more deprived groups. This study shows disproportionate harm 
is associated with both emerging lifestyle factors such as 
television viewing time and sleep duration as well as more 
traditional lifestyle factors such as smoking. Thus, policies 
should target a wider range of lifestyle factors than they do 
currently. However, to avoid increasing health inequalities, 
lifestyle interventions need to incorporate an understanding of 
the upstream socioeconomic determinants of lifestyle. Our 
findings support the societal and political imperative to reduce 
poverty, because—despite similar levels of multiple unhealthy 
lifestyle factors—deprived populations suffer disproportionately 
worse outcomes.

extended score as opposed to a traditional score that omits 
emerging lifestyle factors.
Methods
Study design and participants
This was a prospective, population-based cohort study of 
participants enrolled in the UK Biobank. 502 655 partici-
pants were recruited by postal invitation between 
March 13, 2006, and Oct 1, 2010. Participants attended one 
of 22 assessment centres across England, Scotland, and 
Wales, where they completed touchscreen and nurse-led 
questionnaires, had physical measurements taken, and 
provided biological samples.15 All individuals registered 
with the National Health Service (NHS) aged 40–69 years 
who were living within 25 miles from one of the 22 study 
assessment centres were invited to participate; those who 
responded and had capacity to consent were included. 
Participants were excluded from analyses if they 
reported implausible values for physical activity, tele-
vision viewing time, or sleep duration, defined as the 
sum of their total physical activity, sleep duration, and 
total screen time exceeding 24 h. Further details of these 
measurements can be found in the UK Biobank online 
protocol.16 Participants with missing lifestyle or socio-
demo 
graphic data, an event (death or cardiovascular 
disease event) within 2 years of recruitment, and any 
self-reported non-communicable disease (excluding 
hypertension) at baseline were also excluded from 
analyses. The UK Biobank study was approved by the 
North West Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee; 
participants provided written informed consent for data 
collection, data analysis, and record linkage. This study is 
part of UK Biobank project 7155 (NHS National Research 
Ethics Service 16/NW
/0274).
Procedures
Dates of death were obtained from death certificates held 
by the NHS Information Centre (England and Wales) and 
the NHS Central Register (Scotland). Dates and causes of 
hospital admissions were identified via record linkage 
to Health Episode Statistics (England and Wales) and to 
the Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR01). Analyses for 
each outcome were censored at different dates because 
different data sources were used for each outcome. All-
cause mortality analyses were censored at Jan 31, 2016, or 
date of death if death occurred earlier. Cardiovascular 
disease analyses were censored at March 31, 2015 (latest 
date available), or date of event if the event occurred 
earlier. Incident cardiovascular disease was defined 
as a hospital admission or death with International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th revision, code I05–I89.9. 
Therefore, incident cardiovascular disease included both 
fatal and non-fatal events.
Townsend deprivation index scores were derived from 
national census data about car ownership, household 
overcrowding, owner occupation, and unemployment 
aggregated for postcodes of residence.17 Higher Townsend 
scores equate to higher levels of socio 
economic 
deprivation. Data about household income were self-
reported (appendix). Educational attainment was derived 
from the highest self-reported qualification based on the 
International Standard Classification of Education 
(appendix).18 Age was calculated from dates of birth and 
baseline assessment. Ethnicity was self-reported as 
white, mixed, Asian or Asian British, black or black 
British, Chinese, or other ethnic group; data for ethnic 
subgroups were available, but with few participants in 
each, we did not analyse participants by ethnic subgroup. 
Smoking status was categorised into never, former, 
and current smoking. Non-communicable diseases 
(depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, alcohol 
problems, substance abuse, eating disorders, cognitive 
impartment, dementia, Parkinson’s disease, chronic 
pain syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
chronic asthma, chronic liver diseases, hypertension, 
heart diseases, stroke, diabetes, inflammatory diseases, 
arthritis, and cancer) were self-reported on the baseline 
questionnaire. Trained nurses measured blood pres 
sure, 
height, and body 
weight during the initial assess 
ment. 
WHO criteria were applied to classify body-mass index 
into under 
weight (<18·5 kg/m²), normal weight 
(18·5–24·9 kg/m²), overweight (25·0–29·9 kg/m²), and 
obese (≥30·0 kg/m²).19
Available data for lifestyle factors in UK Biobank were 
used to generate a lifestyle score using smoking status, 
alcohol intake, physical activity, television viewing time, 
sleep duration, fruit and vegetable intake, oily fish intake, 
and red and processed meat intake. This score was based 
on a previously published score from an Australian cohort 
of 267 079 adults, which represented the sum of each 
dichotomised lifestyle variable (0 points if not at risk, 
1 point if at risk), resulting in a risk score range of 0–6, in 
which a higher score indicated higher risk (appendix).14 
UK Biobank data collection precluded using exactly the 
same lifestyle variables so the score was adapted. Lifestyle 
variables comprising the score were derived from question-
naire responses (appendix). If available, we used national 
guidelines to generate healthy and unhealthy categories for 
each lifestyle factor. We assigned 1 point to participants 
for each unhealthy category (current smoker; alcohol con-
sumed daily or almost daily; <150 min per week of moderate 
intensity physical activity or <75 min per week of vigorous 
intensity physical activity; ≥4 h per day of television viewing 
time; <7 h or >9 h of sleep per day; <400 g of fruits and 
vegetables per day; less than one portion of oily fish per 
week; more than three portions of red meat per week; more 
than one portion of processed meat per week). Participants’ 
points were summed to create an unweighted score. The 
minimum score was 0, indicating a healthier lifestyle, 
and the maximum score was 9, indicating an unhealthier 
lifestyle. To examine the associations of lifestyle with health 
outcomes, participants were classified into three categories 
according to their lifestyle score. Participants who scored 0, 
1, or 2 were classed as most healthy; those who scored 3, 4,

or 5 were classed as moderately healthy; and those who 
scored 6, 7, 8, or 9 were classed as least healthy. Distributions 
of the lifestyle score and lifestyle categories are shown in 
the appendix.
Outcomes
The outcomes assessed in this analysis were all-cause 
mortality, and cardiovascular disease mortality and in-
cidence; exposures of interest were lifestyle category and 
quintiles of area-based deprivation.
Statistical analysis
We explored the associations between lifestyle category, 
deprivation quintile, and health outcomes using Cox 
proportional hazards models, with years of follow-up as 
the time-varying covariate. Sociodemographic factors 
(age, sex, and ethnicity), month of assessment, history 
of hypertension, systolic blood pressure, medi 
cation for 
hypercholesterolaemia or hypertension, and body-mass 
index categories were treated as confounders being 
associated with both exposures and out 
comes. To 
reduce the chance of reverse causality, all analyses were 
landmark analyses, with follow-up commencing 2 years 
after recruit 
ment, thereby excluding participants with 
an event (death or cardiovascular disease event) within 
2 years of recruitment. In addition, participants with 
any self-reported non-communicable disease (excluding 
hyper 
tension) at baseline were excluded from analyses. 
Participants who reported a history of hypertension at 
baseline (n=70 854) were not excluded because power 
would be reduced considerably.
First, we investigated the separate associations of 
lifestyle score (0–9; ordinal variable), lifestyle category 
(most healthy, moderately healthy, and least healthy), 
and deprivation quintile with health outcomes. Second, 
we investigated whether deprivation modified the 
associations observed between lifestyle category and 
health outcomes. Significant interactions between the 
lifestyle category and deprivation on health outcomes 
were tested by fitting an interaction term between the two 
variables (ie, lifestyle category by deprivation quintile). To 
determine the interaction effect, we used ordinal coding, 
with participants in the least deprived quintile who were 
in the most healthy lifestyle category as the reference 
group. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, 
month of assess 
ment, history of physician-diagnosed 
hypertension, systolic blood pressure, medication for 
hypercholesterolaemia or hyper 
tension, and body-mass 
index categories. When the associations between lifestyle 
category and health out 
comes were investigated 
separately, models were adjusted for deprivation quintile, 
and vice versa.
The Townsend index was our primary socioeconomic 
ex 
posure because it was available for nearly all participants. 
However, we also ran models with individual-level 
measures of socioeconomic status (household income 
and educational attainment). To highlight the effect of

emerging lifestyle factors, we ran analyses using a 
traditional score, which excluded sleep and television 
viewing time. Additionally, we tested a score that only 
included lifestyle factors that were significantly associated 
with all outcomes. We also ran analyses excluding 
participants with hypertension. To examine interaction 
effects, we ran models using continuous variables for 
lifestyle and deprivation, and calculated a synergy index.
The proportional hazards assumption was checked with 
tests based on Schoenfeld residuals. We used Stata, 
version 14, for all analyses. 
Role of the funding source
There was no funding source for this study. This study 
used UK Biobank data but was designed, conducted, 
analysed, and interpreted by the authors. All authors had 
full access to all the data in the study. The corresponding 
author had final responsibility for the decision to submit 
for publication.
Results
Of the 502 655 participants recruited to UK Biobank, 
134 614 (26·8%) reported non-communicable diseases at 
baseline, 39 447 (7·8%) participants had an event within 
2 years of recruitment, 39 415 (7·8%) had missing covariate 
data, and 705 (0·1%) reported implausible values for 
 
physical activity, sleep duration, and total screen time. 
Some participants met more than one of these exclusion 
criteria. Excluded participants were broadly similar to 
those included (appendix). Therefore, 328 594 (65·4%) 
participants had full data available for the landmark 
analyses. The mean follow-up period was 4·9 years 
(SD 0·83; range 3·3–7·9) after the landmark period for all-
cause and cardio 
vascular disease mortality, and 4·1 years 
(0·81; range 2·4–7·0) for cardiovascular disease incidence. 
Over the follow-up period, 17 380 (5·3%) participants had 
incident cardio 
vascular disease and 5553 participants 
(1·7%) died (1528 [0·5%] from cardiovascular disease). 
Overall, 141 419 (43·0%) participants were in the most 
healthy category, 173 455 (52·8%) in the moderately 
healthy category, and 13 720 (4·2%) in the least healthy 
category (table 1). Characteristics of participants by 
deprivation quintile are summarised in the appendix. The 
most deprived quintile had a lower prevalence of healthy 
lifestyle behaviours as well as a greater proportion of 
participants who were obese or underweight than did the 
other quintiles (appendix). Participants in the most 
deprived quintile had a larger waist circumference and 
slightly higher body fat percentage than those in the other 
quintiles (appendix). 
Participants in the least healthy category had a higher 
hazard ratio (HR) for all outcomes than did those in the 
reference, most healthy, category (table 2). One increment 
change towards the least healthy category was associated 
with a HR for trend of 1·34 (95% CI 1·28–1·41) for all-
cause mortality, 1·44 (1·32–1·57) for cardiovascular disease 
mortality, and 1·10 (1·07–1·13) for cardiovascular disease 
incidence (table 2). There was a clear and significant trend 
of increased risk for all outcomes for participants with 
an increasingly un 
healthier lifestyle score compared 
with those with a minimum score of 0 (appendix). 
One increment change in lifestyle score was associated 
with a HR for trend of 1·13 (95% CI 1·12–1·15) for all-
cause mortality, 1·16 (1·12–1·20) for cardiovascular disease 
mortality, and 1·04 (1·03–1·05) for cardiovascular disease

higher hazard for all-cause mortal 
ity, and cardiovascular 
disease mortality and incidence (appendix). One quintile 
in 
crement in deprivation was associated with a HR for 
trend of 1·11 (95% CI 1·08–1·13) for all-cause mortality, 
1·16 (1·12–1·21) for cardiovascular disease mortality, and 
1·05 (1·04–1·06) for cardiovascular disease incidence 
(appendix).
Associations between lifestyle categories and health 
outcomes were stratified by quintiles of deprivation 
(table 3). Relative to the most healthy category, there were 
marked increases in HR for all-cause and cardiovascular 
disease mortality across the lifestyle categories for most 
quintiles of deprivation; however, the pattern was less 
clear for cardiovascular disease incidence. Significant 
interactions between lifestyle category and deprivation 
were found for all-cause and cardiovascular disease 
mortality (both pinteraction<0·0001) but not for cardiovascular

least deprived quintile, the adjusted HR for individuals in 
the least healthy category compared with those in the 
most healthy category was 1·65 (95% CI 1·25–2·19) for 
all-cause mortality, 1·93 (1·16–3·20) for cardiovascular 
disease mortality, and 1·29 (1·10–1·52) for cardiovascular

for all-cause mortality, 3·36 (2·36–4·76) for cardiovascular

Sensitivity analyses using the traditional score showed 
the same pattern; however, for individuals in the least 
healthy category, HRs for all outcomes across all levels 
of deprivation were lower with the traditional score 
than with the extended score (appendix). Analyses of 
individual lifestyle factors showed considerable variation 
in HRs for each outcome (appendix). However, analyses 
using a lifestyle score comprising only those lifestyle 
factors associated with all outcomes of interest produced 
similar results to our main results (appendix). Excluding 
individuals with hypertension also produced similar 
results, albeit with wider CIs than analyses that included 
these individuals (appendix). Broadly similar estimates 
were found for individual-level measures of socio-
economic status; individuals with the lowest income or 
educational attain 
ment in the least healthy category had 
the highest HR for all outcomes (appendix). The patterns 
of interactions between lifestyle category and individual-
level measures of socioeconomic status, and those of 
the additional tests for interaction and synergy, were 
similar to the pattern between lifestyle category and the 
Townsend index (appendix).
Discussion
Our findings show that an extended score of unhealthy 
lifestyle factors—incorporating the emerging risk factors 
of sleep duration and television viewing time together 
with more traditional lifestyle factors of smoking, alcohol, 
physical activity, and diet—has a strong association with 
all-cause mortality, and cardiovascular disease mortality 
and incidence. We found that the association between an 
unhealthy life 
style and all-cause and cardiovascular 
disease mortality becomes stronger with increasing levels 
of deprivation. This disproportionate lifestyle-associated 
risk in more deprived groups was seen with both area-
level and individual-level measures of socioeconomic 
status. Furthermore, this risk was even greater in more 
deprived groups when lifestyle was measured by an 
extended score that included emerging factors than by a 
traditional score. These inequalities in lifestyle-related 
risk were not accounted for by differences in sex, age, 
ethnicity, blood pressure, concurrent cholesterol or blood 
pressure medication, or body-mass index. The steeper all-
cause and cardiovascular disease mortality trends (figure) 
across lifestyle categories in more deprived groups 
support a vulnerability hypothesis whereby deprived 
groups are more vulnerable to the effects of unhealthy 
lifestyles than are groups that are not deprived.6,20 
According to this hypothesis, deprived groups are likely 
to experience disproportionate harm from unhealthy 
lifestyles, which is not simply explained by greater 
prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles.
These findings are consistent with previous studies that 
have shown disproportionate harm associated with some 
traditional lifestyle factors. For example, US survey data 
from approximately 41 000 adults showed that those of 
lower socioeconomic status had disproportionately poorer 
measures of morbidity and self-rated health associated 
with traditional lifestyle factors.6 However, no significant 
interaction between low socioeconomic status and 
lifestyle factors in terms of mortality was reported. 
Additionally, a study7 of survey data from 23 564 adults 
from one area of Canada found disproportionate levels 
of poor health reported by smokers compared with 
non-smokers in those with low incomes and without 
employment. Interactions between alcohol intake and 
socioeconomic status have been investigated more 
frequently than other lifestyle factors as researchers 
attempt to explain the well described alcohol paradox, in 
which similar or lower levels of alcohol consumption in

more deprived groups are associated with dispro-
portionate alcohol-related harm.21 Annual surveys from 
50 236 participants in Scotland linked to mortality 
registers, hospital admissions, and prescription data have 
shown that the disproportionate alcohol-related harm 
associated with more deprived areas was attenuated but 
remained significant after controlling for body-mass 
index, smoking status, and drinking patterns.5 Less 
evidence exists for an interaction between physical 
inactivity and low socioeconomic status. In our study, the 
significant interaction between extended lifestyle score 
and deprivation suggests that deprived populations are 
more vulnerable to a wider range of lifestyle factors than 
previously understood, including emerging lifestyle 
factors such as television viewing time and sleep duration.
Mechanisms underpinning disproportionate lifestyle-
related harm in deprived groups remain unclear. One 
possible explanation might be a socioeconomic gradient 
of intensiveness for each lifestyle factor.8 For example, 
more deprived participants who smoke might smoke 
more cigarettes than their affluent counterparts. Another 
possible explanation includes an interaction between 
unhealthy lifestyle factors and increased psychosocial 
stress, leading both directly (via inflammatory mediators) 
and indirectly (via low mood) to disproportionate 
cardiovascular pathology.9 Other purported mechanisms 
include interactions between unhealthy lifestyle factors 
and structural factors associated with deprivation, such 
as poorer access to health care and lack of social support.10
The implications of these disproportionately worse 
outcomes in more deprived individuals, despite a similar, 
broadly defined lifestyle, are threefold. There should be a 
renewed call to government-level action on poverty to 
reduce health inequalities and reverse adverse impacts 
from austerity measures;22,23 public health inter 
ventions 
could increase their impact by broadening the range of 
lifestyle factors targeted while acknowledging social 
determinants of lifestyle;24 and individual-level lifestyle 
interventions could be both broadened to include 
emerging lifestyle factors and strengthened in areas of 
deprivation to be proportionate to need.25
Although there was a clear trend of increasing risk of 
cardiovascular disease incidence with least healthy life-
style category and increasing deprivation, we found no 
significant interaction between lifestyle and deprivation 
for cardiovascular disease incidence. There were many 
more cardiovascular disease incidence events (17 380) 
than all-cause (5553) and cardiovascular disease (1528) 
mortality events, and therefore the estimates for cardio-
vascular disease incidence might be more accurate. 
However, cardiovascular disease mortality is a composite 
measure of both cardiovascular disease incidence and 
survival; because deprivation is associated with both of 
these outcomes, the modifying effect of deprivation 
might, as a result, be stronger for mortality than for 
incidence, which includes both fatal and non-fatal events. 
An alternative explanation for this non-significant inter-
action might lie in the socioeconomic status different 
ial 
in health-care-seeking behaviour, which results in under-
reporting of non-fatal cardiovascular disease events in 
more deprived groups, whereas fatal events are less likely 
to be under-reported because all deaths are recorded in 
the UK. Previous qualitative research has shown that 
individuals from more deprived areas tend not to present 
to health services in response to chest pain, sometimes 
because of a perception of health service overuse.26 Here, 
the number and proportion of events generally increased 
with deprivation for all-cause and cardiovascular disease 
mortality despite fewer participants in more deprived 
groups (table 3). Although a similar pattern was seen for 
cardiovascular disease incidence, with the proportion of 
events increasing with deprivation, the absolute number 
of events did not increase with deprivation. This could 
represent under-reporting of non-fatal cardiovascular 
disease events in more deprived groups. Therefore, the 
incidence of cardiovascular disease in more deprived 
groups recorded in our study might be lower than the true 
incidence, and the resulting association with lifestyle and 
deprivation might be attenuated.
UK Biobank is a large prospective cohort with linked 
data for registered deaths and hospital admissions, 
offering a unique opportunity to explore risks associated 
with lifestyles and deprivation. The large size of the cohort 
allowed us to exclude individuals with self-reported non-
communicable diseases at baseline as well as those who 
died within 2 years of recruitment while maintaining 
sufficient participant numbers and statistical power. These 
strategies reduce the chance that our results are due to 
reverse causality (ie, poor health leading to unhealthy 
lifestyles and adverse outcomes), although the possibility 
remains in this observational study. We undertook analyses 
using both area-level and individual-level measures of 
socioeconomic status, which increases the robustness of 
our results. Participants with missing covariate data (about 
8%) were excluded, which might have influenced results, 
but excluded participants were broadly similar to those 
included (appendix). UK Biobank is acknowledged to have 
a low response rate (5%), with participants being more 
affluent and more likely to be from a white ethnic back-
ground than the UK population as a whole. Consequently, 
summary statistics such as prevalence cannot be general-
ised to the wider UK population; however, estimates of the 
strength of associations can be general 
ised.27 Presence of a 
non-communicable disease at baseline and therefore 
exclusion from the final survival models was based on self-
report; therefore, misreporting might have biased results. 
However, misreporting might be less likely because 
diagnosis was based on a physician’s diagnosis and was 
discussed at interview with a trained nurse. Self-reported 
lifestyle data are prone to healthy reporting bias,28 and 
there were much larger numbers of participants in the 
moderately healthy and most healthy lifestyle categories 
(table 1; appendix), consistent with a misreporting 
phenom 
enon. Mis 
reporting might have affected the

e584
associations described here if there were systematic 
differences in misreporting between affluent and deprived 
groups. Although evidence for a socio 
economic gradient 
of healthy recall bias is scarce, there might be more 
misreporting of lifestyle behaviours generally among more 
deprived groups than among affluent groups.29 Increased 
misreporting of lifestyle behaviours in deprived groups 
would flatten the associations between lifestyle and health 
outcomes among the deprived group, suggesting that the 
associations identified here would be even stronger with 
more accurate reporting. The lifestyle score used assumes 
the same level of risk associated with each component 
lifestyle factor.14 However, HRs varied by individual factor 
(appendix). Applying weighting for the risk associated with 
each component could produce different results. Moreover, 
identification of specific high-risk permutations or 
combinations of lifestyle factors, although not practical 
here (768 possible permutations for the nine lifestyle 
factors examined in this study), could help to identify high-
risk groups in future research. The manner in which data 
were collected resulted in crude categories for some 
factors. For example, alcohol consumption daily or almost 
daily defined the unhealthy behaviour category, which 
might erroneously include low-risk drinkers and thereby 
reduce the association of alcohol consumption with 
adverse outcomes.
In conclusion, this study is, to our knowledge, the first 
to highlight the disproportionate risk associated with a 
broad range of unhealthy lifestyle factors among more 
deprived socioeconomic groups. If this association is 
causal, policies to improve a broad range of lifestyle 
factors among these groups could lead to substantial 
improvements in health outcomes. This improvement in 
health outcomes would not only come about because of 
the higher prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles in deprived 
areas than in affluent areas but also because those in 
deprived areas appear to be more vulnerable to the 
deleterious effects of unhealthy lifestyle factors, including 
emerging factors such as sleep duration and television 
viewing time, than those in affluent areas. However, 
improvement of specific lifestyle factors alone in areas of 
deprivation is unlikely to reduce health inequalities. On 
the basis of the increased vulnerability seen in this study, 
deprived populations would continue to have worse 
outcomes despite similar levels of unhealthy lifestyle 
factors seen in affluent populations. This finding clearly 
strengthens the arguments for government policies that 
tackle up 
stream determinants of ill-health and aim to 
reduce poverty, and for health policies that offer increased 
support in areas of deprivation.22,23,25 Public health and 
individual-level interventions should aim to improve 
wider combinations of lifestyle factors but need to 
recognise and address the social and environmental 
determinants of lifestyle to avoid increasing health 
inequalities.30 Further research is required to understand 
the mechanisms behind the interaction between lifestyle 
and deprivation, as well as to identify those combinations 
of unhealthy lifestyle factors that incur the greatest risk 
across socioeconomic groups.
