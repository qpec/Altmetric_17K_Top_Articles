 Abstract
Background—To date, evidence for the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in 
recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been limited to case series and open-label 
clinical trials.
Objective—To determine the efficacy and safety of FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI.
Design—Randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01703494)
Setting—Two academic medical centers.
Patients—46 patients who had 3 or more recurrences of CDI and received a full course of 
vancomycin for their most recent acute episode.
Intervention—Fecal microbiota transplantation with donor stool (heterologous) or patient’s own 
stool (autologous) administered by colonoscopy.
Measurements—The primary end point was resolution of diarrhea without the need for further 
anti-CDI therapy during the 8-week follow-up. Safety data were compared between treatment 
groups via review of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and new medical conditions for 6 
months after FMT. Fecal microbiota analyses were performed on patients’ stool before and after 
FMT and also on donors’ stool.
Results—In the intention-to-treat analysis, 20 of 22 patients (90.9%) in the donor FMT group 
achieved clinical cure compared with 15 of 24 (62.5%) in the autologous FMT group (P = 0.042). 
Resolution after autologous FMT differed by site (9 of 10 vs. 6 of 14 [P = 0.033]). All 9 patients 
who developed recurrent CDI after autologous FMT were free of further CDI after subsequent 
donor FMT. There were no SAEs related to FMT. Donor FMT restored gut bacterial community 
diversity and composition to resemble that of healthy donors.
Limitation—The study included only patients who had 3 or more recurrences and excluded those 
who were immunocompromised and aged 75 years or older.
Conclusion—Donor stool administered via colonoscopy seemed safe and was more efficacious 
than autologous FMT in preventing further CDI episodes.
Primary Funding Source—National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most common health care–associated infection in 
U.S. hospitals, with approximately 453 000 infections and 29 000 deaths in 2011 (1). 
Antibiotics are frequently ineffective (2, 3), with recurrence rates of 15% to 35% after a first 
episode and up to 65% after treatment of a second recurrence (4, 5). Recurrences are 
clinically challenging and are typically treated with prolonged courses of antibiotics, which 
maintain and exacerbate intestinal dysbiosis (6). Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) 
restores the normal composition of gut microbiota and is recommended when antibiotics fail 
to clear the infection (3). However, the evidence for FMT rests largely on case series and 
several open-label clinical trials that have suggested cure rates of 81% to 100% in recurrent 
CDI (7–12). To date, there has not been an adequately controlled and blinded trial of FMT 
for CDI treatment. Furthermore, the optimal method for administering FMT has not been 
determined. Evidence suggests that colonoscopic delivery has advantages in terms of

 efficacy (9), safety (13), and patient acceptance and tolerability (14) compared with 
administration via the nasoenteric route. We therefore performed a double-blind, 
randomized, controlled study of colonoscopic FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI. Cure 
rates and adverse events (AEs) were compared between donor FMT and autologous FMT 
(given as a “placebo”) in patients who had at least 3 CDI recurrences.
Methods
Design Overview
This prospective, dual-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial compared FMT 
using donor stool or the patient’s own stool administered by colonoscopy. Patients treated 
with autologous FMT whose CDI relapsed during the 8-week follow-up were offered FMT 
using donor stool. Those who underwent donor FMT and had relapse were offered repeated 
FMT using stool from a different donor.
Patients were enrolled between 15 November 2012 and 10 March 2015 at 2 academic 
hospitals: Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York (NY), and The Miriam 
Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island (RI). Microbiome analyses on donor and patient fecal 
specimens were performed at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The institutional 
review board at each center approved the study protocol (Supplement, available at 
www.annals.org). A data and safety monitoring board monitored the trial using halting rules 
for serious, unexpected, and related adverse safety outcomes, and all authors performed data 
analysis.
Study Population
The study population comprised adult outpatients who had 3 or more documented CDI 
recurrences (defined as ≥3 unformed stools over 24 hours for 2 consecutive days and either a 
positive stool test result for C difficile or pseudomembranes on colonoscopy) and who did 
not maintain cure after a course of tapered or pulsed vancomycin or were unable to taper or 
discontinue vancomycin (or an alternative antibiotic with activity against CDI) without 
recurrent diarrhea requiring anti-CDI treatment. All patients had completed at least 10 days 
of vancomycin therapy for the most recent CDI and continued therapy until 2 to 3 days 
before the procedure.
Major exclusion criteria included age 75 years or older; inflammatory bowel disease, 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or chronic diarrheal disorder; any immunocompromised 
state or immunodeficiency; anaphylactic food allergy; previous FMT; untreated, in situ 
colorectal cancer; and inability to undergo colonoscopy.
Donor Identification and Screening
Patients were permitted to identify a donor or choose to be treated with stool from healthy 
volunteers who were recruited at each site. All prospective donors underwent a medical 
interview and physical examination and were excluded if they had a known communicable 
disease, features of the metabolic syndrome, a diarrheal disorder, an autoimmune or atopic 
disease, a tumor, a neurologic disorder, or chronic pain syndrome or if they had used

 antibiotics for any indication within 3 months. Potential donors also completed a modified 
AABB full-length donor history questionnaire, and those with risk factors for infectious 
agents were excluded (Supplement). Testing for HIV-1 and HIV-2 was performed within 2 
weeks before donation for FMT. Other serologic and stool testing was performed within 1 
month before FMT and included testing for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses; testing for 
Treponema pallidum; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for detection of C difficile 
toxin; culture for enteric pathogens (Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, 
Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and V cholerae); testing 
for fecal Giardia and Cryptosporidium antigens; acid-fast stain for detection of Cyclospora 
and Isospora; ova and parasite testing; and enzyme immunoassay for detection of Rotavirus. 
Patients also had baseline testing for HIV-1 and HIV-2; hepatitis A, B, and C viruses; and T 
pallidum.
Randomization and Interventions
Donors took an osmotic laxative (magnesium hydroxide) the evening before and provided 
fresh stool the day of FMT. All donor specimens were transported on ice and processed 
within 6 hours of collection. Patients were given a standard bowel purge (sodium sulfate, 
potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral solution) the evening before the procedure. 
For patient convenience, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate oral 
solution was substituted for the polyethylene glycol (PEG) bowel purge described in the 
study protocol. After initiating the preparation, patients were required to collect the first 
stool passed (for possible use in autologous FMT), transfer it to a clean container, and keep 
it either refrigerated or on ice. Within 1 hour before the scheduled FMT procedure, the 
nonblinded research assistant took possession of the stool specimens from both the donor 
and the patient. Patients were equally allocated to the donor and autologous FMT groups via 
block randomization by C difficile positivity at baseline, with stratification by study site. 
The protocol specified a “dose” of 100 g of stool diluted in 500 mL of nonbacteriostatic 
0.9% normal saline immediately before the procedure, but the study relied on fresh stool, 
which has unpredictable weight and volume, and most provided specimens were less than 
100 g. Because patients had discontinued use of vancomycin, had completed bowel lavage, 
and had been randomly assigned, we elected to use the lesser amount of fecal material. In 
those circumstances, available stool was weighed and suspended in a proportionately 
reduced volume of saline. A mean stool dose of 64 g (SD, 25 g; range, 20 to 100 g) was 
infused for donor FMT.
Colonoscopies were performed within the endoscopy units of the study centers. Endoscopic 
findings and the depth of insertion were recorded. The study physician administered 300 mL 
of the fecal suspension through the instrument’s working channel into the furthest point 
reached (terminal ileum or cecum). After FMT, patients were transferred to the recovery area 
and encouraged to retain the stool for at least 1 hour. If they were unable to do so, the time 
of the first postprocedure bowel movement was recorded.
Follow-up
Patients were instructed to contact the clinical team if they had recurrence of diarrhea and 
were provided with a thermometer for daily oral temperature readings and a diary card to

 record solicited AEs for 7 days and unsolicited AEs for 30 days after transplantation. They 
were contacted by telephone 2 and 7 days after FMT and then biweekly for 8 weeks and 
questioned about stool form and frequency. All patients were seen in the clinic for follow-up 
2 and 8 weeks after treatment, where they were assessed for infectious and gastrointestinal 
symptoms and underwent physical examination. They submitted stool specimens at baseline 
and at each post-FMT visit for C difficile PCR testing and microbiome analysis. All patients 
were contacted by telephone by a study representative 6 months after the last treatment to 
record any serious AEs (SAEs), new medical conditions or diagnoses, or changes in medical 
conditions or medications since the last study contact.
End Points
The primary efficacy end point was the rate of clinical cure in the intention-to-treat (ITT) 
population 8 weeks after FMT or at the time of early withdrawal. Clinical cure was defined 
as lack of CDI recurrence with maintenance of resolution (that is, <3 unformed stools per 
day) for 8 weeks without requirement for further antibiotics (metronidazole, vancomycin, or 
fidaxomicin). Because nucleic acid testing does not distinguish colonized patients from 
those with symptomatic disease (15), it cannot test for cure (2, 16); therefore, patients 
meeting the definition of clinical cure were considered to be cured regardless of the results 
of follow-up PCR testing of stool for C difficile. Safety end points were evaluated by review 
of SAEs, AEs, new medical conditions or diagnoses, or changes in medical conditions at the 
6-month follow-up.
Analysis of Fecal Microbiota
Fecal microbiota was analyzed from patients at least 5 days before and 2 and 8 weeks after 
FMT, as well as from donor samples. DNA extraction, 16S ribosomal RNA gene 
amplification, and sequencing were performed by the University of Minnesota Genomics 
Center. Processing details are described in the Supplement, and data are archived in the 
Sequence Read Archive at the National Center for Biotechnology Information under 
BioProject accession number SRP066964.
Taxonomic assignments were made against the Ribosomal Database Project using mothur 
software, version 1.34.0 (17). Alpha and beta diversity of bacterial communities were 
evaluated using the same software. Shannon indices and abundance-based coverage estimate 
parameters were calculated to assess alpha diversity. Differences in beta diversity and 
abundances of genera were performed using analysis of similarity and Kruskal–Wallis 
analysis, respectively (18).
Statistical Analysis
Fecal microbiota transplantation was predicted to reduce the incidence of relapse from 50% 
to 10% at the end of the study (4, 9). A sample size of 48 at the time of analysis was 
estimated to have greater than 80% power at a 2-sided α level of 4.7%. To account for 
dropouts, we planned to enroll 53 patients. All analyses were performed on the blinded 
treatment groups on an ITT basis.

 Analyses were performed using Stata, version 12 (StataCorp), and SAS, version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute). A 2-sample t test, with adjustment for unequal variances applied when 
appropriate, was used to compare continuous outcome and other measures between 
treatment groups and sites. A generalized linear model for binary data was used to compare 
groups on dichotomous variables. Group, site, and the interaction of site and group were 
included in the model. The α level was set to 0.05 for statistical significance.
All AEs were summed across the entire diary period and compared between treatment 
groups by using 2 separate generalized linear mixed models for negative binomial–
distributed count data. The first model compared raw counts, and the second model included 
the natural logarithm of the number of complete diary days as an offset to model the average 
daily rate of each dependent variable. Each model also included site as a random effect. The 
α level was set to 0.05 for all models.
Role of the Funding Source
This study was sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Diseases, which had no role in the design of the study; collection, analysis, or interpretation 
of the data; writing, review, or approval of the manuscript; or the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication.
Results
Patients
A total of 179 patients were evaluated, and 52 were enrolled (Figure 1). Of 62 potential 
donors, 49 were approved. For the blinded portion of the study, each patient had a unique 
donor. Patients were generally healthy while using vancomycin and were not acutely ill at 
the time of FMT. Only 3 were positive for C difficile by PCR at baseline (while using 
vancomycin). None had relapse during the 2 to 3 days without vancomycin before the 
procedure. Two patients in RI and 3 in NY withdrew before randomization. One NY patient 
had colon cancer discovered during FMT colonoscopy and was withdrawn. Forty-six 
patients were randomly assigned: 22 and 24 underwent donor and autologous FMT, 
respectively (Table 1). Forty-three patients completed the 8-week follow-up evaluation.
Study Outcomes
In the ITT analysis, 20 of 22 patients (90.9% [95% CI, 69.2% to 97.8%]) in the donor FMT 
group achieved clinical cure versus 15 of 24 (62.5% [CI, 41.6% to 79.6%]) in the autologous 
FMT group. Donor FMT was statistically superior to autologous FMT (P = 0.042), but 
efficacy varied by site. In RI, the cure rate with donor FMT was 90.0% (CI, 51.8% to 
98.7%) versus 42.9% (CI, 20.1% to 69.0%) with autologous FMT, whereas in NY, 91.7% 
(CI, 57.2% to 98.9%) of patients achieved clinical cure after donor FMT compared with 
90.0% (CI, 51.8% to 98.7%) after autologous FMT (Figure 2). The interaction between sites 
was not statistically significant (P = 0.24), with an odds ratio of 9.8 (CI, 0.2 to 453.0) for 
treatment effects between sites.

 Clinical failure occurred a mean of 10 days after the procedure (range, 1 to 62 days). Two 
patients did not maintain cure after donor FMT; only 20 g of donor stool was infused in one, 
and the other had received 60 g. One patient in the donor FMT group reported diarrhea at the 
2-week visit and was subsequently lost to follow-up; the case was considered a clinical 
failure. One patient in the autologous FMT group was lost to follow-up after the 5-week 
telephone contact. She remained CDI-free at the last contact and per a subsequent primary 
care visit documented in the electronic medical record and was classified as cured. Another 
patient in the autologous FMT group who completed only telephone contacts was also 
classified as cured after she remained free of diarrhea through 8 weeks of follow-up. One of 
2 patients who did not maintain cure after donor FMT was re-treated using a different donor 
and was subsequently cured.
All 9 patients who had recurrence after autologous FMT subsequently crossed over to 
treatment with donor FMT and were free of further CDI. Thus, the overall cure rate after a 
single donor FMT was 93.5% (29 of 31 patients). All cured patients remained free of late 
CDI recurrence between 8 and 24 weeks. Three cured patients had formed stools that were 
positive on PCR testing at 8 weeks; the others remained negative on PCR.
In a comparison of clinical features by site (Table 2), the duration of CDI and the mean 
number of recurrences were significantly higher in NY. Furthermore, more patients had been 
treated with fidaxomicin and proton-pump inhibitors in NY, whereas patients in RI reported 
greater Lactobacillus use before FMT. Several NY patients were treated with long courses of 
vancomycin before enrollment, although the duration reported was the cumulative weeks of 
therapy for all prior CDI episodes and did not necessarily represent continuous use.
Adverse Events
A complete description of AEs is included in the Supplement. Chills were reported more 
frequently after autologous than donor FMT (P = 0.053). Rates of other solicited AEs (fever, 
abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flatulence, anorexia, and constipation) 
did not differ significantly between groups. Four SAEs were reported, none were directly 
related to FMT or the colonoscopy. One patient was hospitalized for postpolypectomy 
gastrointestinal bleeding 4 months after donor FMT. Three other SAEs occurred in patients 
undergoing autologous FMT. Five patients reported new medical conditions or changes in 
established conditions at the 6-month follow-up, although none seemed to be related to 
FMT. Two patients had planned elective surgery and were treated with perioperative 
antibiotics; neither reported recurrence of CDI.
Microbiome Analyses
Before FMT, all patient samples showed marked dysbiosis with lower alpha diversity (Table 
1 of the Supplement), more Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria, and fewer 
Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes compared with donor samples (Figure 3). Donor FMT was 
associated with normalization of fecal microbiota and restoration of alpha diversity. Similar 
patterns were seen in microbiota from post-FMT samples after donor FMT that was 
performed as rescue after an initial failure. In contrast, dysbiosis persisted in autologous 
FMT patients who did not have relapse and was characterized by decreased Proteobacteria

 and a nonsignificant change in Bacteroidetes. Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Escherichia, 
Lactobacillus, and Veillonella were abundant in pre-FMT samples and were restricted in 
donors and donor FMT patients. Relative abundances of Bacteroides, Blautia, 
Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia were greater in donor fecal samples and in patients 
undergoing donor FMT.
Fecal bacterial community composition of both donor and pre-FMT samples differed 
between sites. Samples from RI patients contained more Gammaproteobacteria and 
Betaproteobacteria (Figure 2 of the Supplement), whereas pre-FMT samples from NY 
patients commonly showed more Verrucomicrobia. There was a trend toward more 
Bacteroidetes in the NY samples but no difference in Bacteroidetes between patients with or 
without a history of fidaxomicin treatment. Fidaxomicin use correlated with more 
Verrucomicrobia and fewer Gammaproteobacteria before FMT (Figure 3 of the 
Supplement). After autologous FMT, NY patients had greater abundances of Clostridium 
species (Figure 1 of the Supplement).
Feces from the NY patient who underwent donor FMT and relapsed after the 2-week follow-
up still had a high proportion of Gammaproteobacteria (12%) (Figure 4 [panel A] of the 
Supplement), despite an expansion of Bacteroidetes (27%) and increased alpha diversity 
(Shannon index, 3.81; abundance-based coverage estimate, 871). In contrast, the RI patient 
who had relapse at around 8 weeks after autologous FMT showed a community that 
taxonomically resembled that of donor samples through the end of the study (Figure 4 [panel 
B] of the Supplement); expansion of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes was observed after 
autologous FMT, but dysbiosis was still apparent because alpha diversity did not recover.
Discussion
In this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of FMT for treatment of recurrent CDI, 
donor FMT seemed safe and was more efficacious than autologous FMT. Overall, 91% of 
patients in the donor FMT group achieved clinical cure compared with 63% in the 
autologous FMT group, which is consistent with previously reported efficacy (10–12). 
Donor FMT restored normal microbial community structure, with reductions in 
Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia and increases in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. In 
contrast, microbial diversity did not improve after autologous FMT. In the absence of CDI 
recurrence, microbial community structure continued to evolve after autologous FMT, 
probably due to discontinuation of antibiotic use.
That many patients responded to autologous FMT is not unexpected, given that 35% to 65% 
of recurrent CDI is cured after a course of vancomycin (4, 5). However, cure rates with 
autologous FMT differed between study sites, prompting the question of why 90% of NY 
patients treated with their own stool were cured. Analysis of the cohorts at each site revealed 
clinical differences that may be significant. Patients in NY had CDI for a longer time, had 
more CDI recurrences, and received more courses of fidaxomicin than did RI patients. Many 
NY patients had waited for long periods before consultation and had been receiving 
extended courses of vancomycin (up to 148 weeks) and other therapies (such as 
fidaxomicin) before entering the study. Some of these patients could have been cured before

 enrollment. Microbiome analyses showed differences in preprocedural composition of fecal 
samples between sites. Autologous FMT patients at the NY site had greater abundances of 
Clostridia, raising the possibility of emergence of microbial community assemblages 
inhibitory to C difficile via competitive niche exclusion or possibly by emergence of 
nontoxigenic organisms (19). Alternatively, the infectious burden of C difficile might have 
decreased below a critical level due to a longer course of antibiotic suppression. It is also 
possible that some of the patients enrolled in this trial were colonized with C difficile and 
ongoing diarrheal symptoms were related to postinfection IBS. Piche and colleagues 
previously showed that 35% of patients developed new IBS symptoms shortly after 
resolution of CDI (20). Patients with IBS may report improvement in symptoms after a 
course of antibiotics (21), making it difficult to distinguish diarrheal symptoms related to 
IBS from those of CDI; some patients who were “cured” by autologous FMT may have been 
in this category. This is likely a common real-world scenario given the limits of current 
nucleic acid testing, which does not distinguish active CDI from asymptomatic carriage (15).
The main strengths of this study are its blinding, the multicenter design using autologous 
FMT as a “placebo,” and the microbiome analyses. The widespread adoption of FMT was 
based on efficacy shown in case series and open-label trials. Conducting a blinded, 
controlled trial using fresh donor stool was challenging but was necessary to investigate 
efficacy of this therapy. At the end of the trial, all patients cured with autologous FMT 
speculated that they had received donor stool, suggesting an adequate blind. Microbiome 
analyses provided important mechanistic data. Shifts in bacterial community after FMT for 
patients who underwent donor FMT are similar to those reported previously (22, 23).
This study has several limitations. First, no data were collected on the severity of prior CDI 
episodes or on baseline antibody titers. Second, persons aged 75 years or older were 
excluded, and the mean age of the enrolled patients was much younger; hence, the results 
may not be representative of most patients with CDI. This age restriction was required by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in order for us to perform this study using FMT as 
an Investigational New Drug. Age is a strong risk factor for CDI and recurrence (24), and 
FMT has been shown to be safe and effective in elderly patients (25). Future trials should 
include this population as well as immunocompromised patients, another excluded group 
that may benefit from FMT (26).
Third, we did not meet the target of 48 randomly assigned patients as planned. We 
terminated enrollment after 28 months and randomization of 46 patients because of growing 
data on the efficacy of FMT (10, 11) and its increased availability, which influenced 
patients’ willingness to be enrolled as well as the ethics of conducting a placebo-controlled 
study.
Fourth, the doses of stool that were administered to patients differed. Only 2 patients treated 
with donor FMT had relapse, one received 20 g and the other received 60 g. Three other 
patients were cured with donor stool doses of 10 to 20 g, suggesting that efficacy was not 
clearly related to the amount of stool administered, although failure after donor FMT was 
too infrequent to determine whether dose was a factor.

 Fifth, PCR testing of stool was used to diagnose CDI. Although this is the currently 
recommended method (16), a recent study suggested that reliance on highly sensitive 
molecular testing may result in overdiagnosis and overtreatment (27). Nucleic acid testing 
does not distinguish colonized patients from those with symptomatic disease (15), and stool 
may remain positive on PCR up to 30 days after successful treatment (28). We recently 
published data showing that 25% of patients referred for FMT did not have CDI but rather 
an alternative diagnosis (29). Clearly, not all patients with “recurrent CDI” need additional 
courses of expensive antibiotics or FMT. Efforts to refine the imperfect CDI diagnostic 
algorithm and to develop alternative assays to complement nucleic acid testing would be 
beneficial and would prevent unnecessary antibiotic treatment and FMT. Finally, although 
we documented no SAEs related to FMT, the study was not powered to detect rare safety 
outcomes, and a larger trial or national patient registry would help answer questions about 
the safety of FMT.
In conclusion, FMT using fresh donor stool administered via colonoscopy after a course of 
vancomycin was effective at preventing further CDI episodes in patients with multiply 
recurrent infection. Differences in efficacy between sites suggest that some patients with 
lower risk for CDI recurrence may not benefit from FMT. Further research may help 
determine the best candidates for FMT.

 Figure 1. 
Enrollment and outcomes.
Two patients at the Rhode Island site withdrew from the study before randomization. One 
reported that his CDI had resolved, and the other withdrew after the donor was unable to 
produce stool on the day of the planned FMT. Three patients in New York were determined 
to no longer have CDI after further evaluation by the investigator at that site and were 
withdrawn from the study before randomization. One patient in New York was found to have 
colon cancer (an exclusion criterion) at the time of the FMT colonoscopy and was 
withdrawn from the study. CDI = Clostridium difficile infection; FMT = fecal microbiota 
transplantation; IBD = inflammatory bowel disease; IBS = irritable bowel syndrome.
