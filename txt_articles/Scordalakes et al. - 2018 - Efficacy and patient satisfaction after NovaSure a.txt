Objective: Compare amenorrhea rate, menstrual symptoms, patient satisfaction, and adverse 
events in women who underwent endometrial ablation with the NovaSure versus the Minerva 
radiofrequency ablation systems.
Methods: We surveyed 189 premenopausal women (mean 40.8±6.2 years old) who underwent 
endometrial ablation for abnormal uterine bleeding using the NovaSure (n=97) or Minerva 
(n=92) systems, at four private US gynecology clinics, and whose procedure date was after 
July 2015 with follow-up $3 months. Women were surveyed an average of 11.3±3.9 months 
(range 137–532 days) after ablation.
Results: The subject-reported amenorrhea rate was 52% higher in NovaSure subjects than 
Minerva subjects (64% and 42%, respectively; p=0.004). Age and bleeding cyclicity did not affect 
amenorrhea rate in either group. Normal-to-no bleeding was reported by .90% of subjects after 
either treatment. NovaSure was significantly more effective than Minerva at reducing pad/tampon 
use in women with any residual bleeding (2.4±5.2 items/day versus 4.7±5.5 items/day, p=0.049). 
NovaSure was significantly more effective than Minerva at reducing premenstrual syndrome 
(PMS) symptoms (p=0.019) and menstrual pain (p=0.003), and more NovaSure subjects (94%) 
than Minerva subjects (78%) were satisfied with clinical outcomes (p=0.003). Adverse events 
did not differ by treatment; three women in each group progressed to hysterectomy.
Conclusion: While overall bleeding reduction in premenopausal women with abnormal uterine 
bleeding was excellent with either endometrial ablation system, NovaSure treatment resulted in 
a higher patient-reported 1-year amenorrhea rate, and women with residual bleeding used fewer 
pads and tampons than Minerva-treated women. Additionally, NovaSure subjects reported 
better menstrual-related life quality and PMS symptom alleviation, and greater satisfaction 
with outcomes than Minerva-treated women.
Keywords: endometrial ablation, abnormal uterine bleeding, NovaSure, Minerva, premeno-
pausal, satisfaction
Plain language summary
NovaSure-treated women reported a higher 1-year amenorrhea rate, better quality of life, and 
greater satisfaction versus Minerva-treated women. Bleeding reduction in women with abnormal 
uterine bleeding was excellent with either endometrial ablation system.
Introduction
Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) affects up to 30% of premenopausal women,1 and 
negatively impacts quality of life (QoL).2 Medical treatment of AUB is frequently 
effective, but the accumulative costs and potential adverse effects (AEs) associated with 
long-term medical therapy restrict patient adherence.3 Hysterectomy can decisively treat

AUB if medical therapy fails or is contraindicated, but it is 
an aggressive approach that carries risk of serious short-term 
complications such as wound infection, sepsis, and surgical 
trauma to nearby nontarget tissues, and longer-term AEs such 
as pelvic organ prolapse, urinary incontinence, and increased 
risk of cardiovascular disease.4–6 Endometrial ablation is an 
effective but less-invasive surgical option for treating AUB, 
using either resectoscopy or newer second-generation tech-
niques that deliver high-dose radio, thermal, or microwave 
energy to uniformly destroy the entire uterine lining.7–9
The NovaSure® radiofrequency (RF) endometrial ablation 
system (Hologic Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA) has been used 
in the USA to treat AUB since 2001, when it received US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (P010013),10 
and was available before that time in Europe, Canada, and 
Australia. The Minerva™ ablation system (Minerva Surgical 
Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA) received FDA approval 
to treat AUB more recently, in July 2015.11 The current 
multicenter study directly compared amenorrhea rates and 
patient satisfaction levels in premenopausal women who 
since July 2015 underwent either NovaSure or Minerva 
endometrial ablation to treat AUB.
Methods and materials
Study design and patients
This retrospective case series chart review and prospective 
telephone survey assessed amenorrhea rate and bleeding 
severity changes, reinterventions, perioperative AEs, and 
patient satisfaction in premenopausal women who underwent 
endometrial ablation with either the NovaSure or Minerva 
systems for AUB. Study sites were four private US gynecology 
clinics that performed both procedures. All procedures were 
performed between October 2015 and November 2016. Sur-
veys occurred in March/April 2017. All aspects of this research 
were approved by Quorum Review Institutional Review Board 
(IRB; Seattle, WA, USA), including a waiver of informed 
consent for chart review of de-identified patient data, and also 
verbal consent prior to survey participation. Subjects provided 
verbal informed consent before being surveyed. Subjects were 
mailed a Participant Letter that detailed the study objective, 
design, potential risks, investigator contact information, antici-
pated time commitment and compensation, and guarantee of 
confidentiality and IRB oversight, with an invitation to par-
ticipate, at least 1 week before attempting telephone contact. 
The Participant Letter and the uniformly administered Survey 
Script were both preapproved by the IRB. This investigation 
complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Health Insur-
ance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. All aspects of 
study reporting conform to the Strengthening The Reporting of 
OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement 
and criteria (https://www.strobe-statement.org).
Study criteria
Enrollment criteria: 1) Premenopausal women $18 years 
old; 2) AUB history; 3) completed desired child-bearing; 
4) underwent attempted/completed endometrial ablation 
with the Minerva or NovaSure systems after July 2015; and 
5) had documented follow-up $3 months. Exclusion criteria 
comprised contraindications-to-use from the packaging 
information of each device. We targeted a protocol-defined 
1:1 Minerva/NovaSure cohort. All sites used both surgical 
devices. We assumed that there would be fewer Minerva vs 
NovaSure subjects in general across study sites because of its 
relatively new introduction. Therefore, at each study site we 
enrolled all Minerva subjects and an equivalent number of 
NovaSure subjects. We conscientiously strived to numerically 
and temporally (time from procedure to query) match both 
study arms, so long as all participants met study criteria. Once 
all Minvera patients and an equivalent number of NovaSure 
subjects had been enrolled at each site, no further enrollment 
occurred (only excess NovaSure subjects remained). This 
maintained a pre-established 1:1 subject ratio. No subject’s 
post-procedure bleeding status was reviewed, queried, nor 
known at enrollment, in either study arm.
novasure device
The NovaSure Impedance Controlled Endometrial Ablation 
System was FDA-approved in 2001 for treating AUB.10 The 
disposable NovaSure device contains a bipolar RF electrode 
array mounted onto an expandable frame that conforms to the 
interior uterine wall. The array’s porous metalicized fabric 
allows continuous removal of blood, moisture, and generated 
steam. The RF controller delivers the precise current required 
for uniform-depth ablation until 50 Ω tissue impedance is 
reached or 2 minutes elapses, whichever occurs first. Carbon 
dioxide is delivered into the uterus preoperatively to confirm 
uterine wall integrity.
Minerva device
The Minerva system was FDA-approved in 2015 to treat 
AUB.11 The Minerva system also uses a disposable hand-
piece. Bipolar RF electrical current ionizes argon gas 
contained within a balloon into plasma, delivering thermal 
energy to the adjacent endometrium; heated intracavitary 
moisture and a small amount of bipolar RF current provide 
further ablation. Ablation is for a constant, 2-minute duration. 
A uterine integrity test is employed preoperatively to identify 
uterine-wall defects.

novasure vs Minerva for aUB
Outcome measures
The primary efficacy outcome was the percent of subjects 
experiencing amenorrhea at $3 postoperative months. 
Secondary efficacy outcomes were change in AUB symptom 
severity from baseline, percentage of subjects requiring 
secondary intervention (medical or surgical) for recalcitrant 
AUB, and patient satisfaction. Technical success was defined 
as satisfactory completion of endometrial ablation, and clini-
cal success was achieving normal-to-no bleeding. The primary 
safety-related outcome was perioperative AE incidence.
statistics
Categorical variables were assessed with Fisher’s exact test. 
Continuous variables were compared by Student’s t-test. 
For all tests, two-tailed p-values ,0.05 indicated statistically 
significant differences. Analyses used Excel 2010 (Microsoft 
Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) and Prism v.5.03 (GraphPad 
Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
Results
Of 274 women who had undergone endometrial ablation 
using either NovaSure or Minerva systems since July 2015 
and were contacted by telephone, 208 women (76%) agreed 
to participate in the study and were enrolled. The 66 non-
participants included 37 Minerva (56%) and 29 NovaSure 
subjects (44%). Of all 208 volunteers, 19 subjects did not 
satisfy all study inclusion criteria and were excluded from 
analysis; reasons included insufficient documentation of

AUB status, being postmenopausal, and having undergone 
ablation outside of the protocol-defined window. The final 
evaluable cohort (N=189) included 97 NovaSure subjects and 
92 Minerva subjects, an approximate 1:1 ratio. All subjects 
had provided verbal informed consent before completing 
the telephone survey.
No demographic or gynecological historical parameter 
significantly differed between NovaSure and Minerva 
subjects (Table 1). Mean participant age at intervention was 
40.8±6.2 years, 93% of subjects self-identified as White, 
and 2% of women self-reported Hispanic ethnicity. Mean 
body mass index was 29.2±7.2. Gynecologic and obstetric 
histories were similar in both groups, with 45% of the cohort 
having undergone a contraceptive sterilization procedure. 
Women in both arms had similar bleeding patterns; 78% 
had cyclic heavy menstrual bleeding, 7% experienced non-
cyclic bleeding, and 15% reported both cyclic and noncyclic 
bleeding. There was no difference between NovaSure and 
Minerva subjects with respect to intrauterine pathology; 
approximately 2% of women were noted to have polyps and 
10% had fibroids (Table 2).
No differences in preablation diagnostic assessments 
existed between the NovaSure and Minerva treatment groups 
(Table 2). There were no disparities in the types of anesthesia 
used between the two groups, with 74% of all women under-
going general anesthesia. Average actual ablation time was 
92 seconds with NovaSure; the Minerva system delivered 
RF energy for precisely 120 seconds by default. Essentially 
all procedures in both groups were technically successful. 
A single woman in the NovaSure group failed the preablation 
cavity integrity assessment. This patient had a laparoscopic 
salpingectomy performed immediately before the ablation 
and failed the cavity integrity assessment, likely due to CO2 
escaping through the surgical site of tube removal although 
no perforation was identified.
A total of 15 women (10 NovaSure and 5 Minerva 
subjects; p=0.284 by Fisher’s exact) experienced 16 AEs 
with onsets occurring within postoperative 14 days (Table 3). 
Three women (two NovaSure and one Minerva; p=0.999) 
experienced serious AEs, and all three women were 
hospitalized: one NovaSure subject experienced severe pain 
and fever on the day of surgery that resolved by Day 3, after

receiving antibiotics. Another NovaSure subject had moder-
ate vaginal bleeding that began on the day of surgery and 
spontaneously resolved the following day, after hospitaliza-
tion for observation. One Minerva subject was admitted for 
acute renal failure secondary to dehydration of unknown 
cause, on Day 6, which resolved by the following day after 
receiving intravenous fluids.
A total of five additional gynecologic procedures were 
performed in four NovaSure subjects and four procedures 
in three Minerva subjects (p.0.05). In the NovaSure group 
three women had hysterectomies, one of which was per-
formed concurrently with left salpingo-oophorectomy and 
right salpingectomy; a fourth NovaSure woman underwent 
hysteroscopy with dilation and curettage (D&C). In the 
Minerva group, three women had postablation interventions 
charted; two women had hysterectomies, one of which was 
associated with transfusion of two units of blood, and a 
third Minerva woman underwent concurrent hysteroscopy/
D&C/polypectomy. Another Minerva patient later reported 
having had a postablation hysterectomy, bringing the total 
number of postablation hysterectomies to three in each 
treatment group.
Subjects in the NovaSure and Minerva groups were 
queried about their experiences at a similar average interval 
beyond their ablation date (337 and 343 days, respectively; 
Table 4). Subjects were asked to rate their menstrual bleeding 
after endometrial ablation as either “No bleeding”, “Spotting”, 
“Light bleeding”, “Normal menses”, or “Heavy bloodflow”. 
The self-reported amenorrhea rate (answering “No bleeding”) 
at the time of survey was significantly higher after NovaSure 
ablation (64%, 62/97 women) than after Minerva ablation 
(42%, 39/92 women; p=0.004). Clinical success rates, 
defined as normal-to-no bleeding, were similarly 97% in the

NovaSure group and 92% of Minerva subjects. Mean days per 
cycle with any reported bleeding were comparably reduced 
in both groups, from 9.0–9.5 days per cycle before treatment 
to 4.8–5.5 days/cycle after ablation. Diminished bleeding 
after ablation was reflected in a reduction in the combined 
number of tampons and pads used daily during any bleeding 
days within a cycle; in NovaSure subjects, sanitary product 
use declined by 78% and in Minerva subjects the reduction 
was 61%. The self-reported number of tampons and pads 
used per bleeding day after ablation was significantly fewer 
(49%) in the NovaSure group compared to the Minerva group 
(2.4 and 4.7 per day, respectively; p=0.049).
A comparable 84% of both NovaSure and Minerva 
women reported having menstrual pain at baseline (p=0.999); 
the postablation incidence of menstrual pain was signifi-
cantly lower in the NovaSure group (21% reporting pain) 
versus the Minerva group (41%; p=0.003; Table 4). Preop-
eratively, a similar 73% of NovaSure subjects and 76% of 
Minerva subjects experienced premenstrual syndrome (PMS) 
(p=0.739). After NovaSure ablation, 85% of women who 
initially experienced PMS reported that their symptoms were 
either “somewhat improved” or “much improved” versus 
“no change” or any measure of worsening. In the Minerva 
group, 68% of women with prior PMS reported improve-
ment postoperatively, a significantly lower proportion than 
NovaSure (p=0.019). Preoperatively, the negative impact of 
menstrual bleeding on subject QoL, using a 0–5 scale with 
5 being maximal impact, did not significantly differ between 
NovaSure women and Minerva women (4.0 and 3.6 points, 
respectively; p=0.075). Endometrial ablation markedly 
lowered the impact of menstrual bleeding on subject QoL 
in both groups, but the average postoperative impact score 
was significantly improved (lower) in NovaSure (0.3 points) 
versus Minerva subjects (0.7 points; p=0.012).
When queried about overall satisfaction with the ablation 
procedural and perioperative experience, an equivalent 91% 
of both NovaSure and Minerva subjects reported being either 
“very satisfied” or “satisfied” versus feeling “neutral” or any 
measure of “dissatisfied” (p=0.802; Table 5). When asked 
about the clinical outcomes after ablation, a significantly larger 
81% proportion of NovaSure subjects were “very satisfied” 
with postoperative menstrual issues compared to 65% of Min-
erva subjects (p=0.014). This difference was maintained when 
“satisfied” and “very satisfied” groups were pooled together 
and compared against the cumulative proportion of women 
reporting feeling “neutral” or any level of “dissatisfied”; in this 
instance, 94% of NovaSure subjects reported some measure 
of satisfaction with results versus 78% of Minerva subjects 
(p=0.003). The 92% proportion of NovaSure subjects who said 
they would “definitely recommend the procedure to a friend” 
was significantly larger than the 78% of Minerva subjects who 
would definitely recommend (p=0.013).
Discussion
AUB affects many premenopausal women and negatively 
impacts QoL.1,2 Hysterectomy is the definitive treatment for 
AUB, but is invasive and carries substantial risk of early 
AEs including infection, bladder and bowel perforation 
and thromboembolism, and long-term incidence of pelvic 
prolapse and cardiovascular disease.4–6 Medical approaches 
to conservatively manage AUB are often unsuccessful, have 
their own risk of complications, and require treatment until 
menopause, which can be both burdensome and costly.3 
Second-generation, uterus-sparing surgical approaches to 
AUB include transvaginally delivering heat, microwave, 
laser, or RF energy to ablate the endometrium and thereby 
ameliorate dysregulated bleeding.7–9 The current study identi-
fied significant differences in bleeding and QoL outcomes 
in women whose AUB was treated by endometrial ablation 
using either the NovaSure or the Minerva system.
The self-reported 11–12-month amenorrhea incidence 
was increased in both treatment groups, but the final value 
was 52% higher in NovaSure subjects than in Minerva 
subjects. The 64% NovaSure amenorrhea rate in this study 
correlates well with the previously reported postoperative 
12-month amenorrhea incidences ranging from 40% to 58%

novasure vs Minerva for aUB
after NovaSure ablation.12–17 The current self-reported 42% 
post-Minerva amenorrhea rate, however, is appreciably lower 
than the 70% and 72% rates previously reported at 12 months 
in two Minerva studies with similar cohort characteristics as 
ours.18,19 Differences in 12-month amenorrhea rates might 
depend on the method used to assess bleeding. The earlier 
single-arm pivotal Minerva study used a semiquantitative 
pictogram bleeding assessment while the subsequent Minerva 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) used a quantitative alka-
line hematin assay. The pictogram tool has similar positive 
predictive value (91%) versus the alkaline hematin assay 
for identifying excessive menstrual bleeding (ie, .80 mL 
loss per cycle), although it tends to underestimate blood loss 
in highly saturated feminine sanitary products.20 While the 
alkaline hematin assay accurately quantifies blood within 
the working limits of the test, it is important to note that 
the assay’s validated lower limit of quantification, per the 
manufacturer and operator of the Minerva RCT analysis, 
is 2.5 mL blood.21 The absolute lower limit of detectable 
blood with the assay is not reported. Care must be taken 
not to miscategorize very mildly yet visibly blood-stained 
sanitary products that register below alkaline hematin assay 
limits of detection, because this could falsely increase the 
proportion of women that is reported to have achieved 
amenorrhea. Although the alkaline hematin assay has great 
experimental utility, its expense, requisite use of temporally 
matched patient blood samples for internal controls, and the 
inconvenient requirement that women save and submit all of 
their sanitary products from a complete cycle, with no losses 
or omissions, together limit its clinical diagnostic utility. 
Additionally, up to 12% of menstrual blood could be lost 
extraneously and not be measured.22 The current study relied 
on patient reporting of their perceived menstrual bleeding 
burden before and after endometrial ablation. This approach, 
though qualitative, well reflects the real-world experience of 
these women, and questionnaire-based estimations of men-
strual bleeding are both practical and reliable, particularly 
when trying to unequivocally identify complete bleeding 
cessation.23 The current survey questions closely mimicked 
those in the Menstrual Bleeding Questionnaire, an instru-
ment that has been validated for its ability to differentiate 
women with versus without self-reported AUB.24 Similar 
patient surveys have been used by others in retrospective 
cohort studies to assess bleeding outcomes and satisfac-
tion level in women who underwent ablation for AUB.25–27 
There was no indication that initial bleeding pattern cyclicity 
affected treatment outcomes after ablation, in line with 
other observations.28,29 The clinical success rate, defined as 
normalized-to-no bleeding, was similarly excellent (.90%) 
after either treatment according to patient reporting at an 
average of 11.3 months postablation. In women with any 
measure of ongoing bleeding, the patient-reported average 
number of bleeding days per cycle was similarly reduced with 
NovaSure and Minerva; however, reported daily sanitary 
product use was significantly lower in NovaSure subjects. 
Thus, in women with any recalcitrant bleeding, although the 
menstrual duration did not differ according to treatment, the 
menstrual bleeding burden using tampon and pad use as a 
proxy measurement was approximately half in NovaSure 
subjects compared to Minerva subjects.
Endometrial ablation is known to improve PMS 
symptoms.18,19,30 NovaSure ablation was also associated 
with a more pronounced reduction in PMS symptoms than 
Minerva treatment, with significantly more NovaSure women 
reporting reduced symptoms at 12 months; 85% of Nova-
Sure subjects versus 67% of Minerva subjects experienced 
improvement. An earlier study that focused on ablation effects 
on PMS reported that 97% of women with PMS had symptom 
improvement after NovaSure ablation at a mean postoperative 
5.5 months, which was a statistically similar proportion as 
the current value (p=0.057).31 The prior Minerva single-arm 
study reported that 81% of women with preablation PMS had 
symptom improvement at 12 months.18 However, only 54% 
of women with PMS experienced symptom improvement 
in the subsequent Minerva RCT.19 Thus, the 67% of Minerva 
subjects whose PMS symptoms were improved in the current 
study is almost the exact average of previously reported 
values. The proportion of women reporting menstrual pain 
12 months after ablation was approximately twofold higher 
in the Minerva group versus NovaSure subjects, and this 
difference was significant. Women with AUB frequently 
report a markedly compromised QoL because of their symp-
toms, which can restrict physical activities and engagement 
in social/leisure activities.2,32 Women who were treated 
with NovaSure reported much better menstrual-related QoL 
after 12 months than did women who underwent Minerva 
ablation. An equivalent majority of women reported satis-
faction with their ablation procedure, independent of which 
system was used. However, a significantly larger proportion 
of women in the NovaSure group was both satisfied with 
their overall results and was more likely to recommend the 
treatment to a friend than in the Minerva group.
The gold-standard surgical intervention for AUB is hys-
terectomy, but, compared to ablation, is associated with a 
significantly greater risk of infection, hemorrhage and damage 
to nontarget organs, and also a longer recovery time.4 Both 
of the endometrial ablation systems used in the current study 
provide the level of safety expected of modern endometrial

ablative procedures, although the NovaSure system has a 
much longer record of post-market safety surveillance.17,33 The 
number of AEs in the current study was low and did not signif-
icantly differ between treatments. Two serious AEs occurred 
in the NovaSure group (vaginal bleeding and fever with pain), 
and one occurred in the Minerva arm (renal failure secondary 
to dehydration). The number of women that progressed to 
hysterectomy did not differ by treatment. However, the limited 
number of subjects and brief tracking duration in this study 
did not permit a rigorous safety assessment.
We achieved the main goal of this study, which was 
to assess and compare bleeding outcomes in women who 
underwent endometrial ablation with the NovaSure versus the 
Minerva RF ablation systems. We acknowledge, however, 
the limitations of retrospective assessments and the potential 
for bias introduction that is inherent to all subject surveys. 
We think that the very close matching of our two study 
groups’ characteristics, including the dates of operation and 
procedure-to-survey intervals, greatly reduced the likelihood 
of unbalanced bias introduction. We also recognize that 
the study population was 93% Caucasian, which is skewed 
from the national demographics in the USA. Findings from 
this study are generalizable to premenopausal women with 
AUB who match the demographics of the study population. 
Planned future studies should include RCTs to provide addi-
tional evidence of any outcome variation after endometrial 
ablation using different systems.
Overall bleeding reduction in premenopausal women 
with AUB was excellent with either endometrial ablation 
system; however, the NovaSure system resulted in a higher 
patient-reported 1-year amenorrhea rate, and NovaSure-
treated women with any residual bleeding used fewer pads 
and tampons than Minerva-treated women. Additionally, 
NovaSure subjects reported better menstrual-related QoL 
and PMS symptom alleviation, and greater satisfaction with 
outcomes than Minerva-treated women.
