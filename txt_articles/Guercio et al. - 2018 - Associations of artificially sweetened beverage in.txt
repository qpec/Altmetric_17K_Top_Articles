Abstract
Purpose
Observational studies have demonstrated increased colon cancer recurrence and mortality
in states of excess energy balance, as denoted by factors including sedentary lifestyle, dia-
betes, increased dietary glycemic load, and increased intake of sugar-sweetened bever-
ages. Nonetheless, the relation between artificially sweetened beverages, a popular
alternative for sugar-sweetened beverages, and colon cancer recurrence and survival is
unknown.

 Methods
We analyzed data from 1,018 patients with stage III colon cancer who prospectively
reported dietary intake during and after chemotherapy while enrolled in a National Cancer
Institute-sponsored trial of adjuvant chemotherapy. Using Cox proportional hazards regres-
sions, we assessed associations of artificially sweetened beverage intake with cancer recur-
rence and mortality.
Results
Patients consuming one or more 12-ounce servings of artificially sweetened beverages per
day experienced an adjusted hazard ratio for cancer recurrence or mortality of 0.54 (95%
confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.80) when compared to those who largely abstained (Ptrend =
.004). Similarly, increasing artificially sweetened beverage intake was also associated with
a significant improvement in both recurrence-free survival (Ptrend = .005) and overall survival
(Ptrend = .02). Substitution models demonstrated that replacing a 12-ounce serving of a
sugar-sweetened beverage with an isovolumetric serving of an artificially sweetened bever-
age per day was associated with a 23% lower risk of cancer recurrence and mortality (rela-
tive risk, 0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.95; P = .02).
Conclusion
Higher artificially sweetened beverage consumption may be associated with significantly
reduced cancer recurrence and death in patients with stage III colon cancer. This associa-
tion may be mediated by substitution for sugar-sweetened alternatives. Further studies are
needed to confirm these findings.
Introduction
A growing body of literature supports an association between excess energy balance—as
denoted by sedentary lifestyle, type 2 diabetes, increased dietary glycemic load, elevated serum
C-peptide, and Western pattern diet—and inferior survival for patients with colon cancer [1–
7]. Sugar-sweetened beverage intake has been linked with increased risk of obesity, type 2 dia-
betes, and related cardio-metabolic disease [8–14], and also increased cancer recurrence and
mortality in stage III colon cancer patients [15].
Artificially sweetened beverages serve as low-calorie substitutes for sugar-sweetened bever-
ages, potentially reducing excess energy balance. Nonetheless, concerns that artificial sweeten-
ers may increase incidence of obesity, diabetes, and cancer have been raised [16–19]. The
foundation for such concern is uncertain, as studies on the impact of artificially sweetened
beverages on weight gain, diabetes, and cardio-metabolic disease have produced mixed results
[14, 20–29]. Furthermore, while selected studies in animal models suggest increased incidence
of certain cancers with artificial sweetener exposure [30, 31], epidemiologic studies in humans
have not demonstrated such relationships [32–35].
Given existing uncertainties regarding the health effects of artificially sweetened beverages,
we conducted a prospective cohort study nested in a National Cancer Institute (NCI)-spon-
sored randomized clinical trial of adjuvant therapy for stage III colon cancer examining associ-
ations of artificially sweetened beverage intake with colon cancer recurrence and mortality.

 Measurement of artificially sweetened beverage intake was conducted prior to any documenta-
tion of cancer recurrence. Careful and comprehensive documentation during the trial of
patient performance status, pathologic stage, post-operative treatment, and diet and lifestyle
habits allowed concurrent effects of patient, disease, and treatment characteristics to be
examined.
Methods
Study population
Patients in this cohort participated in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB, now part
of Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology) 89803 adjuvant therapy trial for stage III colon can-
cer, comparing weekly 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin to weekly irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and
leucovorin (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00003835) [36]. Between April 1999 and May 2001, 1,264
patients were enrolled in the trial. After 87 patients enrolled, an amendment to the protocol
required patients to complete a self-administered questionnaire capturing diet and lifestyle
habits midway through therapy (4 months after surgery; questionnaire 1 [Q1]) and again 6
months after completion of treatment [14 months after surgery; Q2]).
Eligibility required complete surgical resection within 56 days prior to trial entry, no prior
chemotherapy or radiation therapy for treatment of the tumor, regional lymph node metastases
without distant metastases, a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
of 0 to 2 [37], and adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function. Patients were excluded if
they reported significantly implausible caloric intake (<600 or >4,200 calories per day for men;
<500 or >3,500 calories per day for women), left >70 food items blank, or left blank one or
more questions about artificially sweetened beverages on Q1 or Q2. Finally, to avoid biases due
to declining health immediately before cancer recurrence or death, we excluded patients who
experienced cancer recurrence or death within 90 days following Q1 completion. Fig 1 demon-
strates derivation of the final 1,018 patient cohort. There were no appreciable differences in
baseline characteristics between patients eligible for dietary analysis and the remaining patients
enrolled in CALGB 89803 [2]. All patients signed study-specific informed consent approved by
the NCI Cancer Treatment Evaluation Program and each participating site’s institutional review
board (IRB), including the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center IRB.
Dietary assessment
Patients completed validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) [38, 39].
Participants were asked how often, on average over the previous 3 months, they consumed a
specific food portion size, with up to nine possible responses ranging from never to six or
more per day. We computed nutrient intakes by multiplying the frequency of consumption of
each food by the nutrient content of the specified portions using composition values from the
Department of Agriculture supplemented with other data [40]. Nutrient values were energy-
adjusted using the residuals method [41].
On each FFQ, patients reported their intake of a standard 355-mL (12-ounce [oz.]) serving
(1 glass, can, or bottle) of each of the following low calorie, artificially sweetened beverages:
caffeinated colas, caffeine-free colas, and other carbonated beverages (e.g., diet ginger ale). We
summed consumption of these beverages as total artificially sweetened beverage intake. In
other cohorts, we previously assessed the reproducibility of our FFQ in measuring consump-
tion of beverages. Correcting for within-person variation, the Pearson correlation coefficient
between the FFQ and an independent collection of dietary records was 0.84 for cola and 0.36–
0.40 for non-cola carbonated beverages [42]. We separately validated this FFQ among cancer
patients receiving chemotherapy [43].

 Patients who completed Q1 without cancer recurrence prior to Q1 completion were
included in these analyses. Median time from study entry to Q1 was 3.5 months (95% range, 2.5
to 5.0 months; full range, 0.2 to 9.9 months). We updated dietary exposures on the basis of
results of Q2 using cumulative averaging as previously described [4], but weighted proportional
to times between Q1 and Q2 and then between Q2 and disease-free survival (DFS) time. For
example, if a patient completed Q1 at 4 months, completed Q2 at 14 months, and had a cancer
recurrence at 30 months, the total time between Q1 and cancer recurrence was 26 months; 38%
of that time was between Q1 and Q2 and 62% of that time was between Q2 and the recurrence.

by Sanger sequencing and sequencing by hybridization, as previously described [48]. MSI was
assessed by PCR for 10 microsatellite markers; tumors with instability in �50% of the loci
were classified as MSI-high; for 28 cases without PCR MSI results, those with loss of MLH1 or
MSH2 assessed by immunohistochemistry were classified as MSI-high [49]. PTGS2 expression
level was assessed by immunohistochemistry as previously described [50].
Study endpoints
The primary endpoint of our study was DFS, defined as time from completion of Q1 to tumor
recurrence, occurrence of a new primary colon tumor, or death from any cause. We also
assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS), defined as time from completion of Q1 to tumor
recurrence or occurrence of a new primary colon tumor. For RFS, patients who died without
known tumor recurrence were censored at last documented physician evaluation. Finally,
overall survival (OS) was defined as time from completion of Q1 to death from any cause.
Statistical analysis
In the clinical trial, there was no statistically significant difference in either DFS or OS between
treatment arms [36]. Therefore, data for patients in both arms were combined and analyzed
according to frequency categories of artificially sweetened beverage intake. For the primary
analysis, artificially sweetened beverage intake was classified into five frequency categories
(< 2 servings per month, 2 per month to 2 per week, 3–6 per week, 1 to < 2 per day, � 2 per
day), consistent with prior analyses of beverage intake in this cohort [15].
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine the simultaneous impact of
other variables potentially associated with each outcome [51]. As previously described [41], we
used time-varying covariates to adjust for total calories, physical activity [52], and body mass
index (BMI). Other covariates, including sex, age, depth of invasion through bowel wall, num-
ber of positive lymph nodes, baseline performance status, chemotherapy treatment group, and
aspirin use were entered into the model as fixed covariates. In secondary multivariable analy-
ses, we further adjusted for time-varying Western and prudent pattern diets (as defined previ-
ously[4]), dietary glycemic load, cereal fiber consumption, and intake of coffee, caffeine,
sugar-sweetened beverages, and total fluid intake (a sum of intake of water, tea, juice, milk, cof-
fee, and sugar-sweetened beverages). We included indicator variables for missing values in the
multivariate models.
We tested for linear trends across frequency categories of intake by assigning each partici-
pant the median value for each frequency category and modeling the value as a continuous
variable, consistent with previous studies [2, 4, 15, 53]. The proportionality of hazards assump-
tion for the effect of artificially sweetened beverages and the difference in intake between artifi-
cially sweetened beverages and sugar-sweetened beverages was satisfied by examining each as
a time-dependent covariate in the model. In subgroup exploratory analyses on the effect of
artificially sweetened beverage consumption, we collapsed intake into four categories to con-
serve power, creating the following groupings: <2 servings per month, 2 per month to 2 per
week, 3–6 per week, and �1 per day. In subgroup exploratory analyses, tests for interaction
between artificially sweetened beverage intake and each covariate were performed by including
the cross product of ordinal artificially sweetened beverage intake categories and each dichoto-
mized covariate in a Cox proportional hazards regression model.
To evaluate the effect of substituting artificially sweetened beverages for sugar-sweetened
beverages, we built isovolumetric substitution models wherein we treated intake as a continu-
ous variable and used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate the difference in

 coefficients between intake of artificially sweetened and sugar-sweetened beverages, similar to
prior substitution analyses [54]. The coefficients from these models can be interpreted as the
estimated effect of substituting a certain volume of artificially sweetened beverage for an equiv-
alent volume of sugar-sweetened beverage. These multivariate models were adjusted for
known and potential predictors of patient outcome including age (continuous variable in
years), sex (male or female), depth of invasion through bowel wall (binary variable, pT1-2 or
pT3-4), number of positive lymph nodes (binary variable, 1–3 nodes or �4 nodes), baseline
performance status (binary variable, 0 or 1–2), chemotherapy treatment group (binary vari-
able, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin or irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin), consistent
aspirin use (yes on Q1 and Q2), and time-varying total caloric intake (continuous variable, in
kilocalories per day), physical activity (continuous variable in metabolic equivalent task hours
per week), and body mass index (continuous variable in kilogram per meter-squared).
Analyses were performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). P values are
2-sided and not adjusted for multiple comparisons. A P value less than .05 was considered sta-
tistically significant. Data collection was conducted by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center.
Data quality was ensured through review by the Alliance Statistics and Data Center and by the
study chairperson following Alliance policies. All log files of the statistical analyses can be
found in the supplemental data section. Analyses were based on the study database frozen on
November 9, 2009.
Results
Baseline characteristics
Baseline characteristics by frequency of artificially sweetened beverage consumption are dis-
played in Table 1. Frequent drinkers of artificially sweetened beverages were younger and had
higher BMI and greater total caloric intake. They were more likely to adhere to a Western die-
tary pattern and use aspirin regularly, but less likely to be physically active or consume coffee
or sugar-sweetened beverages. They tended to have less tumor invasion through the bowel
wall and fewer positive lymph nodes.
Associations of artificially sweetened beverage intake with cancer
recurrence and death
Median follow-up from Q1 completion was 7.3 years. During follow-up, 348 of the 1,018
patients in the final cohort experienced colon cancer recurrence or developed new primary
tumors; 265 of these patients died. An additional 44 patients died without documented
recurrence.
Our predefined primary endpoint was DFS. Increasing artificially sweetened beverage
intake was associated with significantly lower risk of cancer recurrence or mortality after
adjusting for other predictors of cancer recurrence (Table 2). Compared with patients who
largely abstained from artificially sweetened beverage intake, patients who consumed 2 or
more 12 oz. servings per day experienced an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for disease recurrence
or mortality of 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 1.07; Ptrend = .004). Recognizing a
limited number of patients reported consumption in this highest category of intake (n = 42),
we repeated the analysis, collapsing the highest two categories, and found that patients report-
ing 1 or more 12 oz. servings per day experienced an adjusted HR of 0.54 (95% CI 0.36 to
0.80). Similarly, increasing artificially sweetened beverage intake was associated with a signifi-
cant improvement in both RFS (Ptrend = .005) and OS (Ptrend = .02). These results were largely
unchanged when further adjusted for time-varying Western and prudent dietary patterns,

As described in Methods, we excluded patients who developed cancer recurrence or died
within 90 days of completing Q1 in our primary analyses to address the possibility that changes
in dietary habits could reflect occult cancer or impending death. To further address this issue,
we repeated the Cox proportional hazard models excluding patients who developed recurrence

 or died within 180 days of Q1 completion (n = 974) as a sensitivity analysis, and our results
remained largely unchanged. Individuals reporting �1 artificially sweetened beverages per day
continued to demonstrate a reduction in risk of mortality or disease recurrence compared to
individuals drinking <2 per month (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.91; Ptrend = .01).
Stratified analyses
We examined the influence of artificially sweetened beverage intake on DFS across strata of
other potential predictors of patient outcome, comparing �1 12-oz. servings per day to <2
servings per month (Fig 2). The association between artificially sweetened beverage intake and
patient outcome appeared consistent across most strata of patient, disease, and treatment char-
acteristics. We further tested other exposures associated with energy excess, demonstrating
similarities across strata. Additionally, we showed similar associations regardless of molecular
tumor characteristics. Tests for interaction between artificially sweetened beverage intake and
the examined covariates—including molecular covariates such as tumor KRAS, P53, and MSI
status—were non-significant except for sugar-sweetened beverage intake. The association of
artificially-sweetened beverage intake with improved DFS appeared stronger among patients
consuming <3 sugar-sweetened beverages per week compared to individuals with more fre-
quent sugar-sweetened beverage intake (P interaction = .008).
Substitution analysis
We sought to estimate the influence of substituting artificially sweetened beverages for sugar-
sweetened beverages on patient outcome (Fig 3). In substitution analyses, replacing one 12-oz.
serving of a sugar-sweetened beverage per day with an isovolumetric serving of an artificially
sweetened beverage was associated with a significant improvement in patient outcomes: 23%
for DFS (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.95, P = .02), 26% for RFS (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.93,
P = .01), and 22% for OS (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.99, P = .04).
Discussion
In this prospective study of stage III colon cancer patients enrolled in a NCI-sponsored clinical
trial, increasing artificially sweetened beverage intake was associated with a significant
improvement in DFS, RFS, and OS. These associations persisted after adjusting for potential
confounders, including measures of energy balance such as BMI, physical activity, Western
pattern diet and dietary glycemic load. Isovolumetric substitution of artificially sweetened bev-
erages for sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with a lower risk of mortality and cancer
recurrence, suggesting that these findings may be accounted for, at least in part, by patients
consuming artificially sweetened beverages instead of sugar-sweetened beverages.
To our knowledge, this is the first study of artificially sweetened beverage intake and colon
cancer recurrence and survival. In light of studies indicating increased risk of colon cancer
recurrence and mortality in association with higher sugar-sweetened beverage intake and
other states of energy excess (e.g., sedentary lifestyle, high dietary glycemic load, Western pat-
tern diet, elevated plasma C-peptide), we hypothesized that artificially sweetened beverage
intake might reduce colon cancer recurrence by substituting for and thereby reducing intake
of high-calorie, sugar-sweetened alternatives [2, 4–7, 15]. The impact of artificially sweetened
beverage intake on long-term energy balance, as denoted by conditions such as obesity and
type 2 diabetes, remains controversial; while experimental studies generally suggest that substi-
tuting artificially sweetened for sugar-sweetened beverages reduces energy excess [20, 29, 55–
60], large observational studies have produced mixed results [14, 20, 22–28]. This may be due
in part to reverse causality, as individuals in observational studies at highest risk for weight

 gain may choose to increase artificially sweetened beverage consumption in attempts at weight
control [20, 26, 61–63]. In contrast, studies have more consistently linked increased sugar-
sweetened beverage consumption to incidence of type 2 diabetes and obesity [10–14], which
have in turn been associated with worsened colon cancer patient outcomes [6, 64]. Of note, all

 patients in this study received surgical resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy; there-
fore, our findings do not suggest that any dietary habit should substitute for standard surgery
or adjuvant chemotherapy.
As we have described previously,[53] examining relationships between dietary factors and
cancer patient outcome in a NCI-sponsored randomized clinical trial provides several advan-
tages. In the trial, patient follow-up and treatment were carefully standardized and included
regular detailed medical examinations to prospectively document cancer recurrence. Prospec-
tive measurement of potentially prognostic variables at study enrollment also reduced likeli-
hood of reporting bias, facilitating more accurate adjustment for potential confounders.
Finally, all patients had lymph node-positive cancer without distant metastasis at trial enroll-
ment, reducing the influence of confounding by disease stage.
Given our study’s observational design, we cannot completely exclude the possibility of
residual confounding. However, the observed associations persisted after adjusting for known
and suspected predictors of patient outcome. Furthermore, the association between artificially
sweetened beverage intake and improved DFS remained largely consistent across strata of
these potential confounders. Nonetheless, other potential confounders plausibly associated
with artificially sweetened beverage intake, such as socioeconomic status [61], were not
assessed in our cohort.
We considered the possibility that patients with occult cancer recurrences or other poor
prognostic characteristics may have decreased artificially sweetened beverage intake due to
poor appetite or other cause. To minimize this bias, we excluded individuals who experienced
recurrence or death within 90 days following Q1 completion. When we extended this restric-
tion to 180 days, individuals reporting consumption of �1 artificially sweetened beverages per

 day continued to demonstrate lower risk of mortality or disease recurrence. Furthermore, we
would expect few patients to have occult cancer recurrences or other poor prognostic charac-
teristics at baseline because patients underwent comprehensive clinical and radiologic assess-
ment before trial enrollment. To account for change in diet over time—including dietary
changes following recovery from treatment—and to mitigate random error in reporting of die-
tary practices through repeated measures, we updated dietary data with a second FFQ 6
months following completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. Given the likelihood that individuals
who consume artificially sweetened beverages following cancer diagnosis also consumed artifi-
cially sweetened beverages prior to cancer diagnosis, we cannot exclude the possibility that
individuals who consume artificially sweetened beverages develop biologically less aggressive
colon cancer tumors. Future studies should examine artificially sweetened beverage intake
both before and after colon cancer diagnosis in order to further elucidate the relationship
between artificially sweetened beverage intake and colon cancer recurrence and mortality. In
addition, we note the number of patients in our study consuming �2 servings of artificially
sweetened beverages daily was relatively small (n = 42), resulting in 95% confidence intervals
for this category crossing one. Despite this, the statistical tests for trend across categories of
artificially sweetened beverage intake was statistically significant and the 95% confidence inter-
vals did not cross one after collapsing the two highest frequency categories of artificially sweet-
ened beverage consumption to improve statistical power. Nonetheless, the lack of precision
indicated by the confidence intervals indicate that replication of our analyses in other cohorts
is required to confirm our findings. We also note that the results of our secondary analyses
should be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating.
Finally, randomized trials may select patients who differ from the general population. How-
ever, the pattern of dietary and lifestyle habits reported by our cohort were consistent with
those of other U.S. cohorts [65]. Moreover, this large trial enrolled patients from community
and academic centers throughout North America, reducing likelihood of biased sampling.
In sum, this prospective study of patients with stage III colon cancer, embedded in a ran-
domized clinical trial, suggests improved patient outcome with increased consumption of arti-
ficially sweetened beverage, which may be accounted for, completely or in part, by substitution
for sugar-sweetened alternatives. Although our study cannot offer evidence for causality given
its observational design, our findings offer further insight into the role of diet and lifestyle in
colon cancer outcomes and potentially meaningful recommendations for clinical care. Further
studies are needed to confirm these findings.
