In this overview, we summarize the findings of the literature with regards to physiology
and pathophysiology of ultra-marathon running. The number of ultra-marathon races and
the number of official finishers considerably increased in the last decades especially due
to the increased number of female and age-group runners. A typical ultra-marathoner is
male, married, well-educated, and ∼45 years old. Female ultra-marathoners account
for ∼20% of the total number of finishers. Ultra-marathoners are older and have
a larger weekly training volume, but run more slowly during training compared to
marathoners. Previous experience (e.g., number of finishes in ultra-marathon races and
personal best marathon time) is the most important predictor variable for a successful
ultra-marathon performance followed by specific anthropometric (e.g., low body mass
index, BMI, and low body fat) and training (e.g., high volume and running speed
during training) characteristics. Women are slower than men, but the sex difference
in performance decreased in recent years to ∼10–20% depending upon the length
of the ultra-marathon. The fastest ultra-marathon race times are generally achieved
at the age of 35–45 years or older for both women and men, and the age of peak
performance increases with increasing race distance or duration. An ultra-marathon
leads to an energy deficit resulting in a reduction of both body fat and skeletal muscle
mass. An ultra-marathon in combination with other risk factors, such as extreme
weather conditions (either heat or cold) or the country where the race is held, can lead
to exercise-associated hyponatremia. An ultra-marathon can also lead to changes in
biomarkers indicating a pathological process in specific organs or organ systems such
as skeletal muscles, heart, liver, kidney, immune and endocrine system. These changes
are usually temporary, depending on intensity and duration of the performance, and
usually normalize after the race. In longer ultra-marathons, ∼50–60% of the participants
experience musculoskeletal problems. The most common injuries in ultra-marathoners
involve the lower limb, such as the ankle and the knee. An ultra-marathon can lead to
an increase in creatine-kinase to values of 100,000–200,000 U/l depending upon the
fitness level of the athlete and the length of the race. Furthermore, an ultra-marathon
can lead to changes in the heart as shown by changes in cardiac biomarkers,
electro- and echocardiography. Ultra-marathoners often suffer from digestive problems
and gastrointestinal bleeding after an ultra-marathon is not uncommon. Liver enzymes
can also considerably increase during an ultra-marathon. An ultra-marathon often leads
to a temporary reduction in renal function. Ultra-marathoners often suffer from upper

respiratory infections after an ultra-marathon. Considering the increased number of
participants in ultra-marathons, the findings of the present review would have practical
applications for a large number of sports scientists and sports medicine practitioners
working in this field.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years and decades, races longer than the classical
marathon distance (42.195 km) have experienced a boom. With
the increase in the number of races and finishers (Nikolaidis
and Knechtle, 2018a), ultra-marathons—defined as any running
distance longer than the marathon distance—became more and
more interesting for scientific research.
The aim of this narrative review is to present the current state
of knowledge on the topic of physiology and pathophysiology of
ultra-marathon running. For this purpose, we have searched all
scientific papers on ultra-marathon in Scopus (www.scopus.com)
until March 2018. The keywords were “ultra-marathon” and
“ultra marathon.” This search resulted in more than 700 articles.
All articles were then sorted so that only studies (i.e., case reports
and original papers) on running were taken into consideration.
Studies investigating swimmers, cyclists, triathletes or other
sports were excluded. Specifically, studies with a practical
relevance for the athlete, the coach and the physician were
considered.
WHAT IS AN ULTRAMARATHON?
An ultra-marathon is any running event where the running
distance is longer than the traditional race length of a marathon
of 42.195 km. The shortest ultra-marathon is the 50-km run
(Figure 1). An ultra-marathon can also be defined as a running
competition lasting 6 h in duration or longer (Zaryski and Smith,
2005). Ultra-marathons are performed as distance-limited runs
held in km or miles or as time-limited events held in hours
or days (www.ultramarathonrunning.com). The most frequently
performed ultra-marathons held as a distance-limited events
are 50-km, 100-km, 50-miles, and 100-miles ultra-marathons
(www.ultra-marathon.org). In addition, there are a variety of
races of different distances, with the longest ultra-marathons
up to 1,000 km for races held in km and 3,100 miles for
races held in miles (www.ultra-marathon.org). In time-limited
ultra-marathons, runners are competing mainly during 6, 12,
24, 48, 72 h, 6 and 10 days (www.ultra-marathon.org). Ultra-
marathon running also includes multi-stage races, such as
crossing countries or even continents (www.ultra-marathon.org).
The longest official ultra-marathon in the world, which
takes place regularly, is the “Self-Transcendence 3,100 Mile
Race” covering the total distance of 3,100 miles (4,989 km)
(www.3100.ws).
An analysis of all 100-miles runners from 1977 to 2008
showed that both the number of races offered and the number of
official finishers increased exponentially (Hoffman et al., 2010a).
Surprisingly, running performance has not improved over all
these years (Hoffman, 2010), which should be attributed to
the increased number of finishers. That is, more “recreational”
runners participate nowadays compared to fewer and more
“competitive” runners in the past.
WHO ARE ULTRA-MARATHONERS?
With regards to their socio-demographic characteristics of
US ultra-marathoners in particular (Tokudome et al., 2004;
Hoffman and Krishnan, 2013), 100-mile ultra-marathoners were
∼44.5 years old, usually men (80.2%), mostly married (70.1%)
(Hoffman et al., 2014) and had a bachelor (43.6%) or higher
(37.2%) university degree (Hoffman and Fogard, 2012). Ultra-
marathoners have a stable body weight during their lifetime and
gain less body weight with increasing age (Hoffman and Fogard,
2012; Hoffman et al., 2014) compared to the general population.
The reason is likely to be the low BMI at a younger age (Hoffman
et al., 2014).
The average age at the first participation in an ultra-
marathon was ∼36 years and before the first start in an ultra-
marathoners had an experience of ∼7 years of competition in
shorter distances (Hoffman and Krishnan, 2013). The average
age did not change at the first start in an ultra-marathon in
recent decades, the ultra-marathoners completed more than
3,000 km in the year before an important competition and the
training kilometers correlated with the length of the longest
ultra-marathon that they completed (Hoffman and Krishnan,
2013). Ultra-marathoners were healthier compared to the general
population and less often absent at school or at work. Serious
diseases such as cancer (∼4.5%), coronary heart disease (∼0.7%),
strokes (∼0.7%), diabetes (∼0.7%), and HIV (∼0.2%) were very
rare in ultra-marathoners, who, on the other hand, had more
allergies (∼25.1%) and exercise-induced asthma (∼13.0%) than
the general population (Hoffman and Krishnan, 2014).
In
general,
ultra-marathoners
are
highly
intrinsically
motivated people (Kruger and Saayman, 2013) and have a very
healthy lifestyle (Tokudome et al., 2004). Ultra-marathoners do
not seem to be motivated by the competition as such, but rather
by the adventure ultra-marathon (Doppelmayr and Molkenthin,
2004). For an ultra-marathoner, the following five aspects are
central for a successful race: the preparation and the strategy,
the management of the race, the discovery of the performance,
the personal performance and the shared experience with the
opponents (Simpson et al., 2014).
Although it is well-known that ultra-marathon running can
lead to adverse aspects regarding health, a large part of ultra-
marathoners would not stop if they learned it was bad for

their health. These ultra-marathoners were younger and less
likely to be married runners with less children and a lower
health orientation but with high personal goal achievement,
psychological coping, and life meaning scores (Hoffman and
Krouse, 2018).
When we consider the the winner list of the “Self-
Transcendence
3,100 Mile
Race”
(Table 1)
and
world
records in ultra-marathon running of elite and age group
runners (Tables 2–6), we inevitably notice that there are
“endurance
talents”
or
“exceptional
runners”
in
ultra-
marathon running. It is striking that the Greek Yiannis
Kouros has a large number of world records over different
distances and in different age groups. His list of victories
in ultra-marathons and world records is almost endless
(www.yianniskouros.gr/index.php/en/kourosvictories).
He
is
considered as one of the best runners in the world and the best
ultra-marathoner of all time.
ARE ULTRA-MARATHONERS DIFFERENT
TO MARATHONERS?
Generally, a long-distance runner competes for first time in
an ultra-marathon after having completed several marathons.
Most ultra-marathoners have run at least one marathon before
the first start in an ultra-marathon and continue to participate
in marathon races during their career as marathon runners
(Knechtle, 2012).
Several studies compared training and anthropometric
characteristics of marathoners and ultra-marathoners (Knechtle,
2012; Knechtle et al., 2012c; Rüst et al., 2012a,b) showing
quite characteristic differences between the two groups of
runners (Table 7). Ultra-marathoners have a higher number
of
successfully
completed
marathons
than
marathoners,
whereas marathoners have a faster personal marathon race
time than ultra-marathoners (Knechtle, 2012). Successful and
experienced ultra-marathoners usually have several years of
experience in ultra-marathon running (Knechtle, 2012).
There are also differences in anthropometric characteristics
between marathoners and ultra-marathoners (Knechtle et al.,
2012c). Generally, ultra-marathoners appear to be thinner than
marathoners and have thinner skin folds. Marathoners have a
significantly lower calf circumference than ultra-marathoners,
but thicker skin folds on the upper body (Rüst et al., 2012b).
Ultra-marathoners have a smaller circumference on the upper
arms and thighs and thinner skin folds on the upper body than
marathoners (Rüst et al., 2012a). Ultra-marathoners have thicker
calves, but are thinner in the upper body than marathoners,
probably due to adaptation due to the many training km and the
many ultra-marathons.
Ultra-marathoners also show differences in training compared
to marathoners. This is especially evident in the scope and
intensity of running training. Ultra-marathoners run much
slower in training than marathoners (Knechtle, 2012; Knechtle
et al., 2012c), but complete more running kilometers and
more running hours per week in training (Rüst et al.,

2012b). One reason that ultra-marathoners train and compete
longer distances than marathoners may be the fact that ultra-
marathoners have a higher pain tolerance compared to other
persons (Freund et al., 2013). Runners with increasing length
in their race seem to invest more and more in training and are
getting thinner and thinner.
WHAT DISTINGUISHES THE SUCCESSFUL
ULTRA-MARATHONER?
Key predictors of a successful ultra-marathon finish were age
(Knechtle et al., 2010b; Rüst et al., 2012b), specific aspects of
anthropometry such as low body fat (Knechtle et al., 2012c), low
BMI (Hoffman, 2008), and low limb circumferences (Knechtle
et al., 2008b). Other aspects included fast personal best running
times and extensive previous race experience (Knechtle et al.,
2009, 2011d), and a high running speed and a high running
volume during training (Knechtle et al., 2010a, 2012c; Rüst et al.,
2012b).
Depending on the kind of the analysis (i.e., correlation of
individual variables with running performance or inclusion of
multiple variables in a regression model), results were different.
For example, the thigh skinfold thickness as a highly predictive
parameter for shorter running distance races (Arrese and Ostariz,
2006) is only significant in a single correlation for ultra-
marathoners, but not in a multi-variate regression analysis
involving multiple variables (Knechtle et al., 2009, 2011e).
Analyzing the relationship between variables of anthropometric
characteristics and race performance, the percentage of body fat
and BMI appear to be the most important variables (Hoffman,
2008; Hoffman et al., 2010a). In 100-mile ultra-marathoners,
a direct linear relationship between a low percentage of body
fat and fast race times were found (Hoffman, 2008). In the
same group of runners, faster ultra-marathoners and successful
finishers had a lower body fat percentage than slower ultra-
marathoners and non-finishers (Hoffman et al., 2010a).
When various anthropometric characteristics such as skeletal
muscle mass, body fat and running training were examined
in multi-variate analyses, only low body fat and fast running
speed in training were correlated with fast race times (Knechtle
et al., 2012c). In ultra-marathoners, weekly running kilometers
and average running speed during training were negatively and
the sum of the skin folds positively correlated with race times
(Knechtle et al., 2010a).
Apart from aspects of anthropometry and training, age also
seems to have a major impact on ultra-marathon performance. In
100-km ultra-marathoners, age, BMI and body fat were positively
and the weekly running kilometers negatively correlated with
race time (Rüst et al., 2012b). Low body fat and a fast running
speed during training are the most important predictors for a fast
ultra-marathon race time.
Besides these variables, experience seems to be the most
important
variable
for
a
successful
performance
in
an
ultra-marathon (Knechtle et al., 2009, 2010a, 2011c). Ultra-
marathoners need several years to reach their fastest running
speed in a competition (Rae et al., 2005). The personal marathon
best time was an important predictor variable for mountain ultra-
marathoners (Knechtle et al., 2010a). In 24-h ultra-marathoners,
aspects such as anthropometric characteristics and training

running volume showed no correlation with race performance,
and the personal marathon best time showed the highest
impact on ultra-marathon race performance (Knechtle et al.,
2009). To reach a maximum of km in a 24-h ultra-marathon,
ultra-marathoners should have a personal best marathon time of
3:20 h:min and have completed a continuous training run of at
least 60 km before the race, while anthropometric aspects such
a low body fat or thin skin folds showed no relationship with
race performance (Knechtle et al., 2011c). Therefore, apart from
low body fat and fast running speed during training, previous
experience such as a fast personal best marathon time seem to
be the most important predictors for a fast ultra-marathon race
time.
Other aspects were also investigated where cognitive functions
should not be ignored. Faster ultra-marathoners seem to focus on
the relevant, unlike slower ultra-marathoners (Cona et al., 2015).
Also important are physiological variables such as maximal
oxygen uptake (VO2max) (Davies and Thompson, 1979). In
addition, faster runners experienced less pain in a 100-mile
ultra-marathon, in the sense that these ultra-marathoners had a
better exercise-induced analgesia (Hoffman et al., 2007). Another
aspect is the pacing, or how ultra-marathoners distribute their
energy across the race (Micklewright et al., 2015). In the 100-
mile “Western States Endurance Run,” the winners initially ran
behind the leaders during the race. In the middle of the race,
they took over the lead themselves and the top ultra-marathoners
were consistent over the entire race distance (Hoffman, 2014). In
24-h ultra-marathoners, the fastest runners start at lower relative
intensities and display a more even pacing strategy than slower
runners (Bossi et al., 2017). In 100-km ultra-marathon running,
the strategy seems different. Fast 100-km ultra-marathoners
tackle the race at a high pace, keeping the pace constant for a
long time, and do not make any tempo changes (Lambert et al.,
2004). Successful elite ultra-marathoners make little to no breaks
during the race (Kerhervé et al., 2015) and often run in groups
of runners of the same speed (Tan et al., 2016). Less experienced
ultra-marathoners are advised to start at a rather low initial pace
that they are most likely to endure during the full distance (Tan
et al., 2016). Pacing has also been studied in a few studies for age
group runners. It was shown the older runners during a 100-km
ultra-marathon did not slow down as younger runners and that
especially the young runners in the age group 18–24 years were
slower than all other age group runners (Rüst et al., 2015). Taken
together, pacing in an ultra-marathon is crucial to finish among
the top.

There are also differences between finishers and non-finishers
in strategy during the race. During an ultra-marathon many
different problems occur, such as muscular spasms, overuse
injuries, digestive problems, motivation problems and sleep
deprivation (Hurdiel et al., 2015). Experienced ultra-marathoners
also have less medical problems such as muscle cramps, digestive
problems, etc. (Schwabe et al., 2014). Successful finishers tackle
the competition in small stages, paying attention to running
speed, nutrition, hydration and team support (Holt et al., 2014).
A successful ultra-marathon finish is a good life experience
while a non-finish is a big disappointment (Holt et al., 2014).
Motivational self-talk seems to be an effective tool to cope with
exertion, as well as other stressors such as blister discomfort and
adverse conditions (McCormick et al., 2015).
The management of sleep deprivation seems to be central
in long to very long ultra-marathons (Van Helder and Radoki,
1989). It has been shown in the “North-Face Ultra-Trail du
Mont-Blanc” (UTMB) that ultra-marathoners who finished
without sleep were faster than ultra-marathoners with sleep
breaks. Runners who adopted a sleep management strategy based
on increased sleep time before the race completed the race faster
(Poussel et al., 2015).
WOMEN IN THE ULTRA-MARATHON
The proportion of women in ultra-marathons was very low at
the beginning of the ultra-running movement. In 100-mile ultra-
marathons held in the United States, the proportion of women
in the late 1970s increased from almost no participant to ∼20%
since 2004 (Hoffman et al., 2010b). This percentage has remained

fairly stable at ∼10–20% in recent years (Hoffman et al., 2010b;
Eichenberger et al., 2012; Fonseca-Engelhardt et al., 2013). In
most ultra-marathons, the proportion of women has increased
in recent years such as in the “Badwater” to ∼19.1% and in the
“Spartathlon” to ∼12.5% (Fonseca-Engelhardt et al., 2013), and
in the “Swiss Alpine Marathon” held in Switzerland to ∼16%
(Eichenberger et al., 2012).
The rather low participation of women can have different
reasons. One important reason is the different motivation of
women toward men in ultra-marathon running. While female
ultra-marathoners tend to be more intrinsically motivated
(Krouse et al., 2011), less concerned with the competitive nature
(Frick, 2011) and more attentive to health (Krouse et al., 2011),
men have a competitive nature in which they want to compete
with opponents and win a race (Doppelmayr and Molkenthin,
2004). Women also have a higher flow experience during an
ultra-marathon than men (Wollseiffen et al., 2016).
An ealier assumption was that women become less tired
than men during an ultra-marathon (Bam et al., 1997). Even
though women run faster in exceptional cases than men, men are
always faster than women in ultra-marathons (Coast et al., 2004;
Eichenberger et al., 2012; Peter et al., 2014). Coast et al. (2004)
compared the world’s best performance for running distances
from 100 m to 200 km, showing that men were on average
∼12.4% faster than women.
It also known that the difference between the sexes increased
with increasing race distance or race duration (Coast et al.,
2004). An analysis of all 24-h ultra-marathons held worldwide
between 1977 and 2012 showed that men were on average ∼5%
faster than women when all runners were considered (Peter
et al., 2014). When the top 10 were evaluated, the difference
was ∼13%, for the top 100 the difference was on average ∼12%,
and when the fastest were taken per calendar year, the difference
was again ∼13% (Peter et al., 2014). Women seem to aim for a
different running tactic than men in the ultra-marathon. In a 100-
km ultra-marathon during the Masters World Championships,
women were relatively slower than men at the start of the race,
but at the end of the race they had a higher running speed than
men (Renfree et al., 2016). However, in recent years women have
been able to reduce the gap of men (Eichenberger et al., 2012;

Rüst et al., 2013b; Peter et al., 2014). An analysis of 24 h ultra-
marathoners showed that the gap fell to ∼17% in the annual
fastest, to ∼11% for the annual 10 fastest, and to ∼14% in the
annual 100 fastest (Peter et al., 2014). An analysis of all 100-mile
ultra-marathons in the world from 1998 to 2011 showed that
women were able to close the gap to men to ∼14% (Rüst et al.,
2013b).
In recent decades, women have been able to reduce the
gap to men, especially in the age group categories in which
relatively many women were at the start (Knechtle et al.,
2016b). The difference in performance between the sexes is
influenced by several variables. Thus, the difference between
the sexes is greatest when fewer women than men participate,
especially on the shorter ultra-marathon distances (Senefeld
et al., 2016). Considering the trend over different running
distances in the last decades, it has been shown that over
longer running distances such as 200 and 1,000 km the
difference between the sexes remained the same. On the
other hand, women approached to men over shorter running
distances of 50 and 100 km. Since this trend is non-linear,
it is absolutely unlikely that women will approach men in
the near and far future even further and they will never
beat the men (Zingg et al., 2014a). In rare cases, however,
women may be able to beat all men in an ultra-marathon
(www.runnersworld.com/trail-running-training/why-women-
rule-ultrarunning). For example, the Japanese Hiroko Okiyama
was able to beat all men in the “Germanyrun” 2007 (Knechtle
et al., 2008a). Future studies need to investigate whether women
were able to reduce the gap to men in older age groups.
AGE OF PEAK PERFORMANCE
The age of the best ultra-marathon performance has been
analyzed in several studies in recent years (Eichenberger et al.,
2012; Knechtle et al., 2012d; Fonseca-Engelhardt et al., 2013;
Rüst et al., 2013b; Zingg et al., 2013b; Peter et al., 2014; Cejka

et al., 2015; Nikolaidis and Knechtle, 2018b). In general, the best
ultra-marathon performance is achieved at an older age than the
best performance over half-marathon and marathon (Figure 2;
Knechtle et al., 2012d, 2014b; Romer et al., 2014; Rüst et al.,
2014; Zingg et al., 2014b; Nikolaidis and Knechtle, 2018a,b).
The best marathon race time is achieved at the age of ∼30
years, where performance level and nationality are important
predictor variables of the age of peak performance (Hunter et al.,
2011; Knechtle et al., 2014a, 2016a; Lara et al., 2014; Nikolaidis
et al., 2016). In ultra-marathons, the age of best performance
is often ∼35 years or older (Knechtle et al., 2014b; Rüst et al.,
2014; Knechtle and Nikolaidis, 2017; Nikolaidis and Knechtle,
2018a,b).
It seems that the age of peak ultra-marathon performance
increases with increasing length of the race distance. In 50-km
ultra-marathon running, the age of the best performance is at
∼39–40 years (Nikolaidis and Knechtle, 2018a). In 100-km ultra-
marathon running, the best race times are achieved at the age
of 30–50 years for men and 30–55 years for women (Knechtle
et al., 2012d). In 100-mile ultra-marathon running (161 km),

the best race times were achieved at the age of 30–39 years for
men and 40–49 years for women (Hoffman, 2010). The age of
the best performance in ultra-marathons has increased in recent
decades, with an increase especially in the long to very long ultra-
marathons and in those runners who had finished many to very

many ultra-marathons (Knechtle et al., 2014b). The older age of
peak performance in the ultra-marathon comparted to marathon
might be explained from the observation that ultra-marathon
runners have finished many marathon races before finishing an
ultra-marathon.
With regards to sex differences in the age of peak performance,
women achieve their best ultra-marathon race time at the same
age as men (Knechtle et al., 2012d; Rüst et al., 2013a; Zingg
et al., 2013b; Peter et al., 2014; Cejka et al., 2015). In 100-km
ultra-marathon running, the age of the fastest annual female and
male finishers was ∼35 years for both sexes (Cejka et al., 2015).
In 24-h ultra-marathon running (Zingg et al., 2013b) as well as
in “Badwater” and “Spartathlon” (Zingg et al., 2013a), the best
performance was achieved for both sexes at the age of ∼40 years.
Considering newer studies with more runners and longer
time frames, there seems to be a difference in the age of peak
performance between women and men depending upon the
length of the performance. In 50-km ultra-marathons, women
seemed to achieve the best race time later in life compared

Ultra-Marathon Running
to men (Nikolaidis and Knechtle, 2018a). In 100-km ultra-
marathons, however, the age of peak performance was younger
in women than in men (Nikolaidis and Knechtle, 2018b). These
disparate findings were most likely explained by the different
ages of women and men competing in these race distances.
Furthermore, the approach of the analysis seems of importance.
When the fastest runners in the “Comrades Marathon” were
considered in 1-year intervals, the fastest running speed was
achieved in men at the age of 36.38 years. For the fastest women,
the age of the fastest running speed was at the age of 32.75
years. When all runners were considered, men achieved the
best ultramarathon performance ∼6 years earlier than women,
whereas when the fastest runners were considered, men achieved
the best performance ∼4 years later than women (Knechtle and
Nikolaidis, 2017).
It seems that the age of peak performance on the long
running distances increases with increasing distance and/or race
duration (Rüst et al., 2013b; Peter et al., 2014). In 100-miles
ultra-marathons, the age of the fastest men was at ∼37 years
and the fastest women at ∼39 years (Rüst et al., 2013b). In 24-
h ultra-marathoners who reached 200 km and more, the fastest
men are ∼44 years and the fastest women ∼43 years old (Peter
et al., 2014). Table 8 summarizes the age of best performance
in the time-limited ultra-marathons of 6 h to 10 days (Knechtle
et al., 2014b). While the youngest age of ∼37 years was found
in women over 10 days, the age of best performance in men
increases with increasing duration. Thus, the age of ∼35 years in
6 h and ∼37 years in 12 h increases to ∼48 years in 72 h, 6 and 10
days (Rüst et al., 2014). However, future studies need to confirm
these findings in distance-limited ultra-marathons such as races
held in kilometers from 50 to 1,000 km and races held in miles
from 50 to 3,100 miles.
When investigating the age of the best ultra-marathon
performance over the years, in some cases the age of the year’s
fastest finishers increased (Eichenberger et al., 2012; Rüst et al.,
2013b; Peter et al., 2014) or decreased (Fonseca-Engelhardt et al.,
2013) over time. For example, the age of the fastest men in the
24-h ultra-marathons rose from 23 years in 1977 to 53 years
in 2012 (Peter et al., 2014). These disparate findings are most
likely due to the different length or durations of the races and
the different time frames.
In addition to elite ultra-marathoners, the number of age-
group runners has increased and their performance has improved
(Jampen et al., 2013; Rüst et al., 2013a). In the “Swiss Alpine

Marathon,” the number of runners older than 30 years increased
significantly and the performance of women in age group 40–
44 years significantly improved (Rüst et al., 2013a). In the
“Marathon des Sables,” the number of finishers older than 40
years increased and the performance of men in the age groups
35–39 and 40–44 years improved (Jampen et al., 2013). The trend
is different for the different age categories. Considering the best
100-km and 100-mile ultra-marathoners, younger runners (i.e.,
25–35 years old) and older runners (i.e., 50–65 years old) can still
improve their performance in the next years and decades (Rüst
et al., 2014). A possible explanation for the relatively old age of
ultra-marathoners could be the fact that the mean age at the first
start of an ultra-marathon is quite high. Hoffman and Krishnan
(Hoffman and Krishnan, 2013) showed that the age at the start of
the first ultra-marathon was ∼36 years.
ENERGY AND FLUID METABOLISM
The homeostatic control of energy balance, i.e., the optimization
of the relationship between energy intake and expenditure, is
a major concern in ultra-marathon due to its large energetic
demands. Two important problems regarding energy and fluid
metabolism in ultra-marathon running are the energy deficit
and a potential fluid overload leading to exercise-associated
hyponatremia.
ENERGETIC REQUIREMENTS IN
ULTRA-MARATHON RUNNING
An ultra-marathon leads to a great energetic demand (Thompson
et al., 1982; Stuempfle et al., 2011). In a 24-h ultra-marathon,
runners were only able to maintain their running speed for the
first 6 h, after which they slowed continuously down (Gimenez
et al., 2013). It could be shown that a runner consumed about
6,300 kcal per day during his “Run around Australia” (Hill and
Davies, 2001). In order to cover the energy consumption, the
runners have to consume high amounts of energy during an
ultra-marathon. Successful ultra-marathon finishers are more
likely to consume and deliver the required energy during
performance than non-finishers (Glace et al., 2002).
In general, ultra-marathoners are unable to meet their energy
demands during a race by feeding them (Machefer et al., 2007;
Enqvist et al., 2010) and in some cases a considerable energy
deficit arises (O’Hara et al., 1977; Hill and Davies, 2001; Enqvist
et al., 2010). The energy deficit, i.e., negative energy balance, is
due to insufficient energy intake, most likely due to suppression
of appetite and digestive problems during the race (Enqvist et al.,
2010). The negative energy balance reduces the concentration of
leptin in the serum after a long endurance performance (Landt
et al., 1997). In turn, decreased levels of leptin might be a concern
for overtrained endurance runners (Bobbert et al., 2012). The
abovementioned studies focused on the quantification of energy
balance rather than to identify the energy sources for a race.
Nevertheless, knowledge about the main energy sources for
an ultramarathon race—not only in terms of calories, but also in
terms of choice of carbohydrates, lipids and protein—is necessary
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org
11

 Knechtle and Nikolaidis
Ultra-Marathon Running
in order to develop optimal nutritional strategies. Carbohydrates
are generally the most important source of energy during an
ultra-marathon (Eden and Abernethy, 1994; Case et al., 1995;
Fallon et al., 1998). A total of 88.6% of the energy in 100-km
ultra-marathon comes from the intake of carbohydrates, only
6.7% from the intake of fat and 4.7% from the intake of protein
(Fallon et al., 1998). However, ultra-marathoners generally do not
meet the required intake of carbohydrates (Martinez et al., 2017).
However, carbohydrate intake—regardless of type or amount—
can not delay glycogen breakdown during performance (Noakes
et al., 1988). In addition, top runners are able to maintain
a high running speed—independent of the energy supply—
without a decrease on plasma glucose concentration during
performance (Sengoku et al., 2015). For longer ultra-marathons,
the proportion of fat and protein to energy contribution seems
to increase. In ultra-marathoners in a race over 1,005 km in 9
days, the average daily intake of carbohydrates dropped to 62%,
while the proportion of fat increased to 27% and of protein
to 11% (Eden and Abernethy, 1994). A recent study showed
that the intake of fat increased with increasing race distance
(Martinez et al., 2017). Thus, it was observed that the ratio among
carbohydrates, lipids and protein follows the current nutritional
recommendations for marathon runners (Stellingwerff, 2013)
with the contribution of carbohydrates and lipids decreasing
and increasing, respectively, as the distance of ultramarathon
increases.
The result of the energy deficit is a decrease in body mass
(Belli et al., 2016), where both fat-free body mass (i.e., muscle
mass) and fat mass are reduced (Knechtle et al., 2011g; Schütz
et al., 2013). The use of fat as an energy substrate is shown by
the increase in free fatty acids during an ultra-marathon (Pestell
et al., 1993; Fallon et al., 1999a). Another problem of the energy
deficit is the insufficient intake of vitamins (Holtzhausen and
Noakes, 1995; Machefer et al., 2007) which is preferably seen in
the pre-race preparation. Overall, ultra-marathoners in very long
races without brakes will face an energy deficit with a decrease
in solid mass. To date, there is no obvious solution to solve this
problem.
EXERCISE-ASSOCIATED HYPONATREMIA
IN ULTRA-MARATHON RUNNING
During an ultra-marathon, all runners experience dehydration
with a decrease in body mass (Holtzhausen and Noakes, 1995).
The greatest body weight loss occurrs in the first hours of an
ultra-marathon (Kao et al., 2008). Therefore, ultra-marathoners
have to consume large amounts of fluids during a race to avoid
dehydration in terms of body weight loss (Newmark et al., 1991).
However, consumption of large amounts of fluid can lead
to dilutional hyponatremia or exercise-associated hyponatremia
hyponatraemia (Barr and Costill, 1989; Eijsvogels et al., 2008;
Bürge et al., 2011; Knechtle et al., 2012b; Chlibkova et al., 2014).
The association between excessive water intake and exercise-
associated hyponatraemia was first recognized in 1981 in a
runner competing in the “Comrades Marathon” (Noakes, 2008).
Symptomatic exercise-associated hyponatraemia is described not
only in ultra-marathoners (Hew-Butler et al., 2007) but also in
marathoners (Spormann et al., 2012; Wellershoff, 2013).
Exercise-associated hyponatremia is defined as a plasma
sodium level of 135 mmol/l or lower (McGreal et al., 2016). Fluid
overload can be seen not only from the change in electrolytes, but
also from changes in plasma volume (De Paz et al., 1995; Costa
et al., 2014), total albumin, and albumin (Fallon et al., 1999a).
In ultra-marathon running, there is no need to drink more
fluid than required, or to over-drink (Knechtle et al., 2012e).
Even if ultra-marathoners lose more than 3% of their body
weight, there is no reason to over-drink to prevent overheating
(Valentino et al., 2016). In an ultra-marathon, a runner of
∼70 kg body mass must lose ∼1.9–5.0% of body mass to
maintain the water supporting body water balance while also
avoiding overhydration (Hoffman et al., 2017b). A recent study
showed that water intake decreased with increasing race distance
(Martinez et al., 2017).
In general, ultra-marathoners do not seem to consume
excessive fluid (Knechtle et al., 2011b) and an ultra-marathoner
should not experience any fluid overload (Knechtle et al.,
2011f). In a 100-km ultra-marathon, faster ultra-marathoners
drank more liquid than slower ultra-marathoners and faster
ultra-marathoners lost more body weight than slower ultra-
marathoners. The weight loss was greater with less fluid intake
(Knechtle et al., 2012e). Due to the fact that faster ultra-
marathoners lost more body weight, the weight loss can be
ergogenic and the ultra-marathoners achieve a faster race time
due to their lower body weight (Knechtle et al., 2012e). In a 100-
mile ultra-marathon, increased body weight losses did not lead to
a limited performance but were rather performance-enhancing
(Landman et al., 2012). In a 100-km ultra-marathon, runners
with a greater body weight loss were faster (Rüst et al., 2012c).
Ultra-marathoners also seem to be able to self-regulate
their plasma sodium during an ultra-marathon. In an ultra-
marathon, the prevalence of exercise-associated hyponatremia
was considerably higher during the race than after the race
(Cairns and Hew-Butler, 2015). It has also been reported
that ultra-marathoners with the highest fluid intake had the
least hemodilution without changes in plasma sodium and
potassium (Kaminsky and Paul, 1991). Often, exercise-associated
hyponatremia is clinically not perceivable, in very few cases;
however, it can lead to major medical problems. Thus, a
case of a 57-year-old man who developed exercise-associated
hyponatremia during a 100-mile ultra-marathon is described.
Hyponatraemia resulted in rapid neurological deterioration and
cardiovascular instability (Surgenor and Uphold, 1994).
Exercise-associated hyponatraemia is a relatively frequently
detectable electrolyte disorder in ultra-marathoners (Noakes and
Carter, 1982; Knechtle et al., 2011b; Hoffman et al., 2012b;
Costa et al., 2013), whereby high ambient temperatures must
be given a great importance (Lebus et al., 2010; Costa et al.,
2013). The prevalence of exercise-associated hyponatremia in
a 225-km ultra-marathon over five stages was ∼42% with
ambient temperatures as high as ∼40◦C (Costa et al., 2013).
In the “Rio de Lago 100-Mile Endurance Run,” held in 2008
in Granite Bay, California, USA, the prevalence of exercise-
associated hyponatraemia was ∼51.2% (Lebus et al., 2010).

 Knechtle and Nikolaidis
Ultra-Marathon Running
However, in 100-mile ultra-marathoners, the prevalence of
exercise-associated hyponatraemia may be as low as ∼30%
(Hoffman et al., 2012b). A great cold seems also to be a major risk
factor for exercise-associated hyponatremia. In a 100-mile ultra-
marathon held in Alaska, 44% of runners had exercise-associated
hyponatraemia (Stuempfle et al., 2002).
In ultra-marathons held in temperate climates, exercise-
associated hyponatraemia is relatively uncommon (Cuthill et al.,
2009; Bürge et al., 2011; Knechtle et al., 2011c,f, 2012b). In
ultra-marathons held in Switzerland, Europe, a low prevalence
of exercise-associated hyponatraemia was found. In the “Swiss
Jura Marathon,” a mountain ultra-marathon over 350 km in
7 stages at medium to low temperatures held in the Swiss
Jura region from Geneva to Basel, the prevalence of exercise-
associated hyponatraemia was ∼8% (Knechtle et al., 2012b). In
the “100 km Lauf Biel” (Bürge et al., 2011; Knechtle et al., 2011f)
and at the “24 h Run Basel” at medium to low temperatures, no
case of exercise-associated hyponatraemia could even be detected
(Knechtle et al., 2010a).
Also, the country in which the ultra-marathons take place
seems to be of importance. The prevalence of exercise-associated
hyponatraemia in ultra-marathons held in the USA is higher
than in ultra-marathons held in Europe. While the prevalence
of exercise-associated hyponatremia was ∼30% in the “Western
States Endurance Run” held in California (Hoffman et al., 2012b),
it was no more than ∼8% in ultra-marathons held in Switzerland
(Knechtle et al., 2010a, 2012b; Bürge et al., 2011). Even in
ultra-marathons held in the Czech Republic, the prevalence
of exercise-associated hyponatraemia was very low (Chlibkova
et al., 2014) as was the case in Asia, where the prevalence of
exercise-associated hyponatremia was only ∼3% in an 84-km
ultra-marathon (Lee et al., 2011). In Australia, no case of exercise-
associated hyponatremia could be detected in an ultra-marathon
(Reid and King, 2007). The USA may be a special case, since a lot
of drinking is promoted there and body weight loss can lead to
disqualification. For example, in the “Vermont’s 100-mile” race,
athletes are required to: “Runners may be asked to weigh in or
undergo further evaluation” and “7% of pre-race weight wants to
be allowed to continue.”
The
prevalence
of
exercise-associated
hyponatraemia
increased in a multi-stage ultra-marathon with increasing
number of stages. In a 250-km multi-stage ultra-marathon, the
prevalence of exercise-associated hyponatraemia per stage was
1.6% (S1), 4.8% (S3), and 10.1% (S5) with a cumulative incidence
of 14.8% (Krabak et al., 2017).
It has already been investigated whether exercise-associated
hyponatraemia can be prevented by means of education,
drinking behavior or sodium intake. However, such efforts can
not influence the onset of exercise-associated hyponatraemia
(Winger et al., 2013). Several studies investigated whether
the intake of sodium during an ultra-marathon is important
(Hoffman and Stuempfle, 2014, 2016b). Considering 100-
mile ultra-marathoners in the USA, up to 100% of runners
consume supplements with sodium (Hoffman and Stuempfle,
2014). The benefits of this intake, however, seem to be very
limited. Studies of 100-mile ultra-marathoners showed that
supplemental intake of sodium during a heat-run did not affect
the runners’ state of hydration (Hoffman and Stuempfle, 2014,
2016b).
Very recent investigation showed an association between
CK-values and exercise-associated hyponatremia. One study
compared
runners
with
and
without
exercise-associated
hyponatremia on the same 100-mile ultra-marathon. Runners
with exercise-associated hyponatraemia had less experience over
100 miles and a higher CK. In addition, there was an inverse
relationship between plasma sodium levels and CK after arrival.
On the other hand, there were no differences in age, sex, weekly
training kilometers, use of sodium supplements during exercise,
body weight loss, frequency of water intake, ingestion of pain
killers, and symptoms during the race (Hoffman et al., 2013a).
Whether there is really a correlation between CK-values after an
ultra-marathon and exercise-associated hyponatraemia is still
uncertain (Hoffman et al., 2012a).
Excessive fluid overload, in addition to biochemically
detectable
hyponatraemia,
can
lead
to
hyponatremic
encephalopathy and swelling of the hands and feet (Figure 3).
Fluid overload can lead to exercise-associated hyponatremic
encephalopathy with severe consquences (Frizzell et al., 1986).
Several cases of long-distance runners with symptomatic
exercise-associated
hyponatraemia
with
altered
behavior,
seizures and edema are known (Bruso et al., 2010; Hoffman and
Myers, 2015; Pearce et al., 2015). Excessive hydration during
exercise also has negative effects on the volume of the feet.
Recent studies have shown an association between fluid intake
during an ultra-marathon and feet swelling during running
(Bracher et al., 2012; Cejka et al., 2012). Recent work also pointed
to an association between exercise-associated hyponatraemia
and skeletal muscle damage. A 24-h ultra-marathon revealed
that hyponatremia preceded the increase in CK (Cairns and
Hew-Butler, 2016).
Surprisingly, however, hypernatremia is much more common
than hyponatraemia. In 133 collapsed runners in the “Comrades
Marathon,”
∼45%
of
runners
had
hypernatremia,
∼2%
hyponatremia and ∼53% normonatremia (Hew-Butler et al.,
2007). However, another study on the “Comrades Marathon”
found hyponatremia in ∼9% of the collapsed runners (Noakes
et al., 1990). It must be noted that collapsed runners do not
always have an electrolyte imbalance. In most cases, runners
collapse to the target line and have an electrolyte imbalance in
only ∼16% of the cases, as opposed to ∼19% for non-collapsed
runners (Holtzhausen et al., 1994).
Some of these ultra-marathons take place in difficult external
conditions such as extreme heat (Knoth et al., 2012). A problem
of the heat is the fact that the performance is partly considerably
impaired (Parise and Hoffman, 2011; Wegelin and Hoffman,
2011). A run in the heat like “Badwater” in Death Valley in the
USA inevitably leads to a rise in body core temperature. However,
the increase is dependent on running speed, with a slight increase
in the fastest runners (Brown and Connolly, 2015). In addition,
running in the sun seems to significantly increase the risk of
malignant skin tumors (Ambros-Rudolph et al., 2006).
A sufficient adaptation to the heat can be achieved with
adequate acclimatization (Sandström et al., 2008; Costa et al.,
2013). Four days of short term heat acclimation facilitates

effective perceptual adaptations (Willmott et al., 2017). The
adaptation to the heat can also be achieved by pauses during
heat or tropical runs (Joslin et al., 2015). It is also important
that an appropriate cooling is initiated immediately in case
of suspected overheating or heat stroke (Rae et al., 2008).
High heat can also lead to a nutritional problem. For example,
a study on the “Marathon des Sables” showed that runners
had major nutritional problems due to the dry mouth and
inability to consume highly sugared energy gels and sports
drinks when the products were heated due to the ambient heat
(McCubbin et al., 2016). Finally, ultra-marathoners will not
develop exercise-associated hyponatremia when they drink ad
libitum with no fluid overload. Athletes must be aware that
extreme weather conditions such as extreme heat and extreme
cold might lead to fluid overconsumption.
DAMAGE TO TISSUES AND ORGANS
Ultra-marathon running leads to selective damages in different
tissues and organs. The most apparent problem is muscular pain.
However, a negative effect can be found for the heart, the liver,

the kidneys, the bone, the digestive tract and both the immune
and the hormone system.
MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS IN
ULTRA-MARATHONERS
Training for an ultra-marathon and ultra-marathons per se
usually result in a damage to the musculo-skeletal system
(Khodaee et al., 2015; Scheer and Murray, 2015), with the extent
of damage depending on the length of the ultra-marathon (Kim
et al., 2009). The damage is generally only of minor importance
(Vernillo et al., 2016) and beginners are more often affected than
experienced ultra-marathoners (Videbæk et al., 2015). Running
over long to very long distances can cause minor damages such
as muscle soreness on the musculature, but can also lead to
substantial problems in the joints and tendons (Fallon, 1996;
Freund et al., 2012; Lopes et al., 2012). In longer ultra-marathons,
∼50–60% of participants experience musculoskeletal problems
(Hutson, 1984). However, it is also possible in rare cases to
cross a continent without any injury (Lathan and Cantwell,
1981). Various studies using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
have shown damages such as fluid retention around tendons,
tissue edema, and damage to cartilage (Theysohn et al., 2013).
Such overuse injuries are the most common reason that ultra-
marathoners have to interrupt training, while other reasons such
as work or family never lead to a training interruption (Hoffman
and Krishnan, 2013).
The most common injuries in ultra-marathoners involve
the lower limb, such as the ankle and the knee (Fallon, 1996;
Scheer and Murray, 2011; Hetsroni and Mann, 2012), and are
manifested as Achilles tendon inflammation and femoropatellar
syndrome (Lopes et al., 2012). When a knee is already damaged,
a further ultra-marathon has a further negative effect on the
joint (Hagemann et al., 2008). At the lower leg, shin splints (i.e.,
medial tibial stress syndrome) occur frequently. In the ankle,
inflammation of the extensor tendons is common. The pattern
of overuse injuries depends on the kind of running. While ankle
problems are more likely to occur in trail running, knee problems
are more common in road running (Bishop and Fallon, 1999).
The symptoms are often relatively small, even in longer multi-
stage ultra-marathons (Fallon, 1996; Krabak et al., 2011). During
a multi-stage ultra-marathon of 5 days and covering 219 km,
∼22% of the runners had lower limb problems, mainly affecting
the knee (Scheer and Murray, 2011). In an ultra-marathon of
1,005 km from Sydney to Melbourne, 32 runners experienced
a total of 64 different problems, of which the knee (∼31.3%)
and the ankle (∼28.1%) were the most frequently affected joints
(Fallon, 1996). Achilles tendonitis, femoropatellar pain, and
inflammation of extensor tendons in the foot were the most
common problems in a 6-day ultra-marathon (Bishop and Fallon,
1999).
For very long ultra-marathons, such as crossing a continent,
adaptations of lower limb tissues occur. An increase in the
diameter of the Achilles tendon was demonstrated during the
“Trans Europe Footrace,” a multi-stage ultra-marathon covering
4,487 km from Bari in Italy to the North Cape. This thickening
of the tendon was interpreted as an adaptation to the stress of
the ultra-marathon (Freund et al., 2012). However, intraosseous
changes and subcutaneous edema were also detected. Changes of
this kind occurred rather in those runners who had to stop the
race early (Freund et al., 2012).
Blisters on the feet are also quite common in ultra-marathon
running (Scheer et al., 2014). However, it has been shown that
the development of blisters is dependent on the experience of the
ultra-marathoner. With increasing experience in ultra-marathon
running, there are fewer blisters on the feet (Scheer et al., 2014).
Despite
all
problems
with
overuse
injuries
in
ultra-
marmathon running, a long run also seems to have a favorable
influence on the cartilage (Mündermann et al., 2017). Runners
in the “Trans Europe Footrace” initially showed a damage of
the ankle cartilage which could regenerate during the the race
(Schütz et al., 2014). MR-findings showed that elevated T2-values
recovered during the second half of the “Trans Europe Footrace”
supported the evidence that this response is a physiological
adaptive mechanism of chondrocyte function via upregulation
of de novo synthesis of proteoglycans and collagen (Schütz et al.,
2014). In addition to MR-findings, changes in the concentrations
of cartilage biomarkers in the serum showed that articular
cartilage is able to adapt during a multi-stage ultra-marathon
such as the “Trans Europe Footrace” (Mündermann et al., 2017).
Although overuse injuries of the lower limbs may be frequent,
not all ultra-marathoners must suffer from this problem. Most
likely very experienced and highly trained athletes have an
advantage to prevent overuse injuries.
DAMAGE TO ORGANS
An ultra-marathon can lead to further pathophysiological
changes. Several studies revealed very different changes in
laboratory values, with much of these changes being due to direct
organ damage. Even a relatively short running distance can lead
to considerable changes in biomarkers where the intensity or
duration of the performance is proportional to the change in
a specific marker (Bird et al., 2014). In other words, the body
responds to the stress of an ultra-marathon with an “acute-phase
reaction” (Fallon et al., 1999b; Fallon, 2001).
An ultra-marathon can lead to changes in biomarkers
indicating a pathological process in specific organs or organ
systems such as skeletal muscles, liver, kidney, etc. (Noakes
and Carter, 1982; Nagel et al., 1990; Wu et al., 2004; Kim
et al., 2007; Bürge et al., 2011; Shin et al., 2012; Bird et al.,
2014; Jastrzebski et al., 2016); Table 9. These changes are usually
temporary, depending on both the intensity and the duration of
the performance and usually normalize after the race (Bird et al.,
2014) mainly with a few days (Kłapcinska et al., 2013). When
biomarkers change during an ultra-marathon, these changes are
transient and there are no long-term or deleterious consequences
(Wu et al., 2004; Bird et al., 2014). The changes affect both
younger and older runners alike, regardless of their running
experience (Jastrzebski et al., 2016). However, there are also
biomarkers which remain unchanged despite high levels of
physical stress (Fallon et al., 1999a).

BLOOD
An ultra-marathon can lead to hemolysis (Chiu et al., 2015)
and it is assumed that hemolysis leads to a significant loss of
erythrocytes (Robach et al., 2014). Hematocrit has been shown
to decrease after an ultra-marathon (Cejka et al., 2012) and
haptoglobin increases (De Paz et al., 1995; Chiu et al., 2015).
Haptoglobin does not always increase after an ultra-marathon,
possibly the length of the race is crucial. At least, after a 60-km
ultra-marathon (Lippi et al., 2012b) and a 24-h ultra-marathon
(Liu et al., 2018), there was a decrease in haptoglobin. In a 166-
km mountain ultra-marathon, it has been shown that “stress
anemia” only occurs by causing anemia due to expansion of
plasma volume (Fallon et al., 1999a) and not due to a reduction
in the volume of erythrocytes (Robach et al., 2014). The extent
of hemolysis can be significantly reduced by appropriate training
(Casoni et al., 1985) and a corresponding diet with antioxidants
(Aaseth and Birketvedt, 2012).
The phenomenon of hemolysis in runners and ultra-
marathoners has been reported (Lippi et al., 2012b; Fazal et al.,
2017). Repetitive forceful foot striking can lead to blood cell
lysis in the feet, resulting in a mild macrocytic anemia and
intravascular haemolysis (Fazal et al., 2017). The decrease of
haptoglobin after an ultra-marathon reflects a certain degree
of haemolysis, but since the changes in red blood cells is
not relevant, the foot-strike haemolysis is very modest or
even clinically negligible (Lippi et al., 2012b). Most probably
there is no cellular damage to the red blood cells. A study
with marathon and ultra-marathoners showed that hemoglobin,
erythrocytes and erythrocyte indices did not change during the
race (Banfi et al., 2004). In a 24-h ultra-marathon, red blood cells,
hemoglobin, hematocrit, and mean cell hemoglobin decreased
(Liu et al., 2018). Ultimately, the suspected anemia of the ultra-
runner is just a “dilute anemia” (Dickson et al., 1982). The
reticulocytes increase after a 6-day ultra-marathon (Fallon and
Bishop, 2002), possibly as an indication that a longer ultra-
marathon leads to some damage to the erythrocytes. As part
of iron metabolism, ferritin increases (Liu et al., 2018) and
transferrin saturation decreases (Kasprowicz et al., 2013). In the
case of ferritin it could be shown that the value is increased due
to the training and can remain elevated after an ultra-marathon
up to 2 weeks (Dickson et al., 1982). Although hemolysis with a
cellular damage of the red blood cells seems possible, it will not
be of relevance. A decrease in hemoglobin is only due to plasma
volume expansion.
HORMONES
During an ultra-marathon, some characteristic changes in
specific hormones are evident (Pestell et al., 1989; Fournier et al.,
1997), with the hypothalamic pituitary axis usually changing
(Wittert et al., 1996; Table 9). An ultra-marathon leads to an
increase in cortisol (Fournier et al., 1997), catecholamines (Pestell
et al., 1993), and growth hormone (McKechnie et al., 1982) as well
as a drop in testosterone (Fournier et al., 1997) where the decrease
in testosterone is related with a decrease in libido (Longman et al.,
2018).

 Knechtle and Nikolaidis
Ultra-Marathon Running
The length of an ultra-marathon seems to have an influence on
the change in hormones. In a run from Sydney to Melbourne over
1,000 km, an increase of norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine
and adrenocorticotropic hormone was found. No changes were
found for ß-endorphin, growth hormone, prolactin, testosterone,
cortisol and cortisol-binding globulin. After the ultra-marathon,
catecholamines increased and growth hormone, prolactin and
cortisol increased (Pestell et al., 1989). Obvioulsy, the ultra-
marathon leads to a chronic physical stress leading to an
adjustment of stress hormones with a continuous increase
(Pestell et al., 1989). The intensity is also crucial. Higher cortisol
levels were found after an ultra-marathon when the athlete was
competing at a high running speed (Tauler et al., 2014).
Since not only men but also more and more women run
ultra-marathons, the changes of the female hormones were also
investigated. There was a marked increase in estradiol after an
ultra-marathon (Copeland and Verzosa, 2014). There is also a
change in neurotransmitters, such as an increase in serotonin,
a drop in tryptophan and an increase in ß-endorphins (Agawa
et al., 2008; Table 9). In summary, male ultra-marathoners must
be aware that increased levels of cortisol and suppressed levels of
testosterone might become counterproductive.
SKELETAL MUSCLE DAMAGE
The term “skeletal muscle damage” applied to ultramarathon
refers to the race-induced muscle pain that results not from
fatigue but from muscle injury (Damas et al., 2018). An ultra-
marathon has a considerable influence on the skeletal muscles
(Kim et al., 2007), with the down passages causing the greatest
muscle damage during the run (Koller et al., 1998) where a run of
330 km with an elevation gain of 24,000 m leads to a measurable
inflammatory reaction and swelling of the thigh musculature
(Andonian et al., 2016). Accordingly, skeletal muscle damage
consists in a major concern for ultramarathon runners.
Studies in ultramarathon have used several blood markers
to evaluate skeletal muscle damage. Skeletal muscle damage is
well visible on specific myocellular metabolites increasing in
blood, such as myoglobin (Bird et al., 2014; Jastrzebski et al.,
2016), lactate dehydrogenase (Noakes and Carter, 1982; Kanter
et al., 1986; Chiu et al., 2013; Bird et al., 2014; Shin et al., 2014;
Jastrz˛
ebski et al., 2015a,b), and creatine kinase (Kanter et al.,
1986; Suzuki, 2002; Chiu et al., 2013; Jee et al., 2013; Bird et al.,
2014; Carmona et al., 2015; Jastrz˛
ebski et al., 2015b).
The creatine kinase as a muscular enzyme is very suitable
to document muscular damage due to an ultra-marathon. The
eccentric load, such as in a mountain ultra-marathon, can lead
to a significant increase in creatine kinase (Noakes et al., 1983;
Frey et al., 1994) and pronounced muscle soreness (Figure 4).
The highest activity of creatine kinase is measured about 1 h
after the completion of an ultra-marathon (Carmona et al., 2015)
but may still be highest at ∼36–72 h after the race (Bird et al.,
2014). The increase in creatine kinase after an ultra-marathon
can sometimes be grotesque (Noakes and Carter, 1982; Kim
et al., 2007, 2009) and seems to increase with increasing race
distance (Table 10). An ultra-marathon over 308 km leads to a
significantly higher creatine kinase than an ultra-marathon over
100 km (Yoon et al., 2016). In a 200-km ultra-marathon, creatine
kinase increased to 35 times the baseline and remained elevated
until 5 days after the race (Kim et al., 2009). In another 200-
km ultra-marathon, the creatine kinase even rose to 90 times the
initial value (Kim et al., 2007). In the “Badwater,” creatine kinase
can increase up to ∼27,951 U/l (Roth et al., 2007). And in the
“Western States Endurance Run,” 216 (66%) of 328 finishers had
creatine kinase concentrations of 1,500 U/l to 264,300 U/l and
13 (6%) of the finishers had values of more than 100,000 U/l
(Hoffman et al., 2012a).
The increase in creatine kinase seems to be dependent on
the fitness level of the runner (Noakes and Carter, 1982). Top
ultra-marathoners have a lower creatine kinase before the start
than slower runners, and after the run have significantly a
lower creatine kinase than slower finishers (Suzuki, 2002). Ultra-
marathoners with a creatine kinase higher than 500 mU/ml
before the start felt tired and rather dropped out of the race
(Suzuki, 2002). Important for athletes and coaches is the fact
that the majority of athletes with significantly elevated creatine
kinase levels are asymptomatic and do no require major medical
attention (Magrini et al., 2017).
The extent of the skeletal muscle damage is clearly reflected
in a severely limited muscular function after an ultra-marathon
(Davies and Thompson, 1986) where standardized jumping
exercises are restricted for ∼18 days after an ultra-marathon
(Chambers
et
al.,
1998).
The
extensive
muscle
damage
seems to lead to a decrease in muscle mass. Several studies
have shown that an ultra-marathon leads to a significant
reduction in skeletal muscle mass (Knechtle et al., 2011a,
2012a,e).
Considering
the
relationship
between
skeletal
muscle mass and muscle strength, it might be assumed
that
the
post-race
decrease
in
muscle
strength
would
be partially attributed to the decrease of skeletal muscle
mass.
Potential therapeutic options were investigated to reduce
skeletal muscle damage during ultra-marathon running or to
improve recovery after the race. An option was to reduce the
decrease in skeletal muscle damage or to reduce the increase in
metabolites of skeletal muscle damage by consumption amino
acids during an ultra-marathon (Knechtle et al., 2012a). However,
BCAA-supplementation before and during a 100-km ultra-
marathon did not affect race performance and biomarkers of
skeletal muscle damage (Knechtle et al., 2012a) and muscle
pain (Knechtle et al., 2011a). It has also been investigated
whether the use of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID) leads to reduced skeletal muscle damage. However,
the use of diclofenac in a mountain ultra-marathon showed
no effect on the increase in creatine kinase (Frey et al.,
1994). The 100-mile “Western States Endurance Run” also
showed that the intake of ibuprofen had no effect on skeletal
muscle damage and pain sensation. Intake of ibuprofen leads
to an increase in inflammatory markers such as C-reactive
protein and interleukins (Nieman et al., 2006). The reason
to consume NSAIDs in ultra-marathon running is explained
by osteo-articular pain or to prevent pain. Ultra-marathoners
consuming NSAIDS are predominantly motivated by their
personal achievement (Didier et al., 2017). The intake of
antioxidants does not seem to have any influence on skeletal
muscle damage (Mastaloudis et al., 2004a, 2006). A diet with

antioxidants leads to a significant reduction in skeletal muscle
damage and increase in creatine kinase (Aaseth and Birketvedt,
2012).
The best option for a fast recovery after an ultra-marathon is
appropriate training. In finishers in a 100-mile ultra-marathon,
runners with lower post-race creatine kinase levels were better

prepared for the race (Hoffman et al., 2017a). The extent
of skeletal muscle damage can be significantly reduced by
appropriate training with high training volumes (Hoffman et al.,
2016) and long race experience (Noakes and Carter, 1982). It
is well-known that the training for an ultra-marathon leads to
characteristic changes and adaptations in the muscle fiber. As
an adaptation to training, the mitochondria are very close to
the capillaries, there is a proliferation of capillaries as well as
an increase and enlargement of type I fibers (Crenshaw et al.,
1991). Manual therapy and intermittent pneumatic compression
are recovery methods used by endurance athletes with little
evidence supporting effectiveness. In a controlled study with
ultra-marathoners, both treatments reduced muscular fatigue
scores acutely after treatment following the race and on post-
race day 1. In addition, manual therapy improved muscle
pain and soreness acutely following the race (Heapy et al.,
2018). In summary, each ultra-marathon leads to skeletal
muscle damage. Although levels of creatine-kinase can rise
up to more than 100,000 U/l, this damage is reversible.
The best prevention is appropriate training in the pre-race
preparation.
BONE
Compared to other physiological systems and organs of human
body, acute and chronic race-induced adaptations of bone in
ultramarathon runners have been less studied. In addition to
skeletal muscle, also bone appears to be damaged during an
ultra-marathon (Kerschan-Schindl et al., 2009; Sansoni et al.,
2017). During the “Spartathlon,” there is a direct influence on
metabolites of bone metabolism leading to an increased bone
resorption and a reduced bone formation (Kerschan-Schindl
et al., 2009). In a mountain ultra-marathon, a correlation between
the high energy consumption and bone damage with a decrease
in osteocalcin was demonstrated (Sansoni et al., 2017). This
could lead to a decrease in bone density leading to osteopenia
and to osteoporosis after prolonged exposure. Furthermore,
bone mineral density of women ultramarathoners has been
related to menstrual function, where low lumbar spine bone
mineral density has been observed in runners with history of
oligo/amenorrhea (Micklesfield et al., 1995). Accordingly, it has
been suggested that postmenopausal ultra-marathon runners
were at high risk for large losses in bone mass (Folscher et al.,
2015). Consequently, special attention is needed on the bone
health of women ultramarathon runners.
HEART
As ultramarathon is a prolonged endurance exercise relying on
aerobic energy transfer system, it is not surprising that a large
body of the literature has focused on the exercise physiology of
cardiovascular system. Due to the increase in creatine kinase,

Ultra-Marathon Running
several studies investigated a potential heart damage through an
ultra-marathon due to an increase in cardiac biomarkers such as
creatine kinase, creatine kinase-MB, cardiac troponin I and N-
terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptides after an ultra-marathon
(Table 9; Roth et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2014; Christensen et al.,
2017). A 90-km ultra-marathon also leads to a an increase in
C-reactive protein as has been reported for heart attack patients
(Strachan et al., 1984). However, the changes in these biomarkers
are all transient (Christensen et al., 2017).
Running speed and the length of an ultra-marathon are
important for potential changes of markers of cardiac damage.
An ultra-marathon over 100 km leads to a significantly higher
creatine kinase than an ultra-marathon over 308 km (Yoon et al.,
2016). It is well-known that high-intensity endurance exercise
leads to biochemical changes that may indicate heart damage
(Salvagno et al., 2014). The highly sensitive cardiac troponin I
increases after an ultra-marathon (Salvagno et al., 2014) where
faster runners show a higher increase in cardiac troponin I
than slower runners (Musha et al., 1997; Khodaee et al., 2015).
The increase in cardiac troponin I can partially be dramatic. In
the “Supermaratona dell’Etna” covering 43 km from sea level to
2850 m, mean cardiac troponin I increased by +900% (Da Ponte
et al., 2018).
In men in a 308-km ultra-marathon, a normal creatine
kinase-MB mass index (<5.0 ng/ml) and no increase in cardiac
troponin I could be detected and it was assumed that there
had been no myocardial damage despite an increase in the
creatine kinase-MB (Kim et al., 2014). Even in runners competing
in “Badwater,” no structural damage to the myocardium could
be demonstrated (Roth et al., 2007). In a 50- and 100-mile
ultra-marathon, an increased activity of serum creatine kinase-
MB could be detected in ∼80% of the runners, with no
evidence of myocardial damage in myocardial scintigraphy
(Matin et al., 1983). Apart from creatine kinase, also specific
cardiac hormones increase during an ultra-marathon. The
hormones N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (Ohba
et al., 2001; Hew-Butler et al., 2008a,b; Tchou et al., 2009)
and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) (Ohba et al., 2001) were
increased post-race.
It is very controversial whether an ultra-marathon leads
to a damage of the heart. A study of 100-mile ultra-
marathoners showed that the race induced changes in the
heart. In the electrocardiogram, changes occurred in the right
heart (Lord et al., 2015). The right heart leads showed a
change in the electrocardiogram after the run compared to the
electrocardiogram before the run for the P-wave, the ST-segment
and the T-wave (Lord et al., 2016a).
A structural change of the heart muscle by an ultra-
marathon could be detected by the use of echocardiography.
Echocardiography can detect a reduction of the left (Niemela
et al., 1984; Krzeminski et al., 2016; Maufrais et al., 2016) as
well as the right ventricular (Oxborough et al., 2011; Lord et al.,
2015, 2016b; Maufrais et al., 2016; Rothwell et al., 2018) function
after an ultra-marathon. The changes in cardiac troponin I
during an ultra-marathon are inversely associated with left
ventriculare ejection fraction determined with echokardiography
(Christensen et al., 2017).
The length of the ultra-marathon is important whether a
change in the left and/or right ventricular function occurs. After
the 2-day “Lowe Alpine Mountain Marathon,” both a systolic
and diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle could be detected.
Humoral markers of myocardial damage were increased and the
increase in cardiac troponin was considered to be associated with
a minimal myocardial damage (Shave et al., 2002). After a 24-h
ultra-marathon, two out of 20 runners showed a slight increase
in cardiac troponins and echocardiography showed a decrease
in left ventricular ejection fraction in one of the two runners
(Passaglia et al., 2013). After an 89-km ultra-marathon, there
was a reduced function of the left and right ventricles (Chan-
Dewar et al., 2010). In a 4-h run, there was a decrease in the
activity of the MIBG (131-J meta-iodo-benzylguanidine) in the
myocardium, and the extent of activity decrease correlated with
the distance covered during the run (Estorch et al., 1997). In a
160-km ultra-marathon, no correlation between the decrease in
left ventricular function and the change in cardiac biomarkers
could be demonstrated (Scott et al., 2009). During a 24-h ultra-
marathon, the left ventricular function decreased during the last
6 h of the race where the function normalized within a few days
after the race (Niemela et al., 1984). Another study showed that
echocardiographic changes returned to normal within 1 day after
the run (Dávila-Román et al., 1997). In some instances, an ultra-
marathon leads to no echocardiographic changes. For runners in
the “Western States Endurance Run,” echocardiographic findings
were normal (George et al., 2011). Therefore, it is at the moment
difficult to conclude that an ultra-marathon leads to substantial
heart damage.
Although an ultra-marathon leads to a limitation of the
left ventricular function and an increase in certain cardiac
biomarkers, the mechanism behind these changes is unknown
(Scott et al., 2009). An important aspect is also that the endurance
training leads to an adjustment of the left ventricle in the sense of
a left ventricular hypertrophy (Nagashima et al., 2003; Szauder
et al., 2015). The size of the left ventricle is an important
predictive variable for the performance of an ultramarathon
(Nagashima et al., 2006). As women progressively compete in
ultra-marathon, it has also been investigated whether a sex
differences exist. In a 100-km and a 100-mile ultra-marathon,
both men and women were examined and no difference was
found in the echocardiographic changes between the sexes (Cote
et al., 2015).
It is believed that elevated cholesterol is a cardiovascular
risk factor with an increased morbidity and mortality. An
ultra-marathon could be beneficial for reducing elevated
cholesterol (Thompson et al., 1982; Kaminsky et al., 1988;
Wu et al., 2004; Sapounakis et al., 2010). There has been
shown a reduction in triglycerides and total cholesterol
after a 24-h ultra-marathon, but no change in low density
lipoprotein cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol
(Emed et al., 2016). In another study, a reduction in total
cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides
was demonstrated after an ultra-marathon (Kaminsky et al.,
1989). Only training lowers low density lipoprotein cholesterol
in an ultra-marathon (Tomaszewski et al., 2004). Runners
preparing for an ultra-marathon experience a decrease in total

Ultra-Marathon Running
and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (Sapounakis et al.,
2010). Obviously, training for and competing in an ultra-
marathon might be considered as preventive for cardiovascular
diseases.
DIGESTIVE TRACT
The physiology and pathophysiology of digestive tract in
ultramarathon runners attracts widespread interest due to
the abovementioned large energetic demands of training and
competititon. Digestive tract plays a critical role in delivering
nutrients during endurance exercise; thus, the occurrence
of digestive problems might limit performance (Jeukendrup,
2017). Ultra-marathoners often suffer from digestive problems
(Rehrer et al., 1992) and gastrointestinal bleeding after an
ultra-marathon is not uncommon (Baska et al., 1990) where
often occult bleeding occurs (Chiu et al., 2015). Symptoms of
the lower gastrointestinal tract correlate with gastrointestinal
bleeding (Baska et al., 1990). In a 100-mile ultra-marathon,
∼35% (Stuempfle and Hoffman, 2015) and in a mountain
ultra-marathon ∼43% of runners complained about digestive
problems (Rehrer et al., 1992). In some cases as many as
80% and more of the finishers complain of digestive problems
(Wardenaar et al., 2015; Stuempfle et al., 2016), with nausea
being mentioned most frequently (Figure 5; Stuempfle et al.,
2016). Digestive problems are one of the main reasons why
ultra-runners have to give up an ultra-marathon (Hoffman
and Fogard, 2011). Up to 90% of runners who give up an
ultra-marathon complain of nausea (Stuempfle and Hoffman,
2015).
A possible reason for these digestive problems could be
that an ultra-marathon changes the motility of the esophagus
(Simons and Kennedy, 2004). Endotoxemia seems to be a
major cause of digestive problems, while factors such as
hyperthermia, dehydration and nutrition are barely causative
(Stuempfle et al., 2016). Experience seems to be important.
Runners with digestive problems during an ultra-marathon have
less training km and shorter training runs (Glace et al., 2002).
From a pathomechanistic point of view, endotoxins and pro-
inflammatory cytokines increased in a 24-h ultra-marathon
and this increase led to a counter-regulatory anti-inflammatory
reaction (Gill et al., 2015a,b).
From a therapeutic point of view, it seems very difficult to
treat gastrointestinal problems. The intake of sodium during a
100-mile ultra-marathon definitely has no influence on nausea
and vomiting (Hoffman and Stuempfle, 2016a). The best way to
prevent digestive problems is to eat what you like most during
an ultra-marathon (Moran et al., 2011). The high-fat foods and
increased fat intake during an ultra-marathon seem to cause
significantly less digestive problems (Stuempfle et al., 2013) and
ingesting a proton pump inhibitor before an ultra-marathon
significantly reduces the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding during
the run (Thalmann et al., 2006). Regarding digestive problems
in ultra-marathon running, the prevalence is very high and the
only option is prevention by eating what you like most during an
ultra-marathon.
LIVER
Regular physical activity has a positive effect on liver function. On
the other hand, a very long endurance exercise—especially under
difficult climatic conditions (Carvalho et al., 2016)—can become
a problem for the liver (Shephard and Johnson, 2015). Especially
longer runs at low intensity seem to be more of a problem for the
liver (Shin et al., 2016). There may be a detectable impairment in
liver function during an ultra-marathon (De Paz et al., 1995; Chiu
et al., 2013; Bird et al., 2014; Shin et al., 2014; Table 9).
An ultra-marathon can lead to an increase in gamma-
glutamyltransferase (De Paz et al., 1995; Shin et al., 2014), alanine
aminotransferase (De Paz et al., 1995; Chiu et al., 2013; Bird et al.,
2014; Kupchak et al., 2014; Jastrz˛
ebski et al., 2015b), aspartate
aminotransferase (De Paz et al., 1995; Chiu et al., 2013; Bird et al.,
2014; Kupchak et al., 2014; Jastrzebski et al., 2015; Jastrz˛
ebski
et al., 2015b), alkaline phosphatase (Noakes and Carter, 1982;
Wu et al., 2004; Kupchak et al., 2014), and bilirubin (De Paz
et al., 1995; Fallon et al., 1999a; Wu et al., 2004; Bird et al., 2014;
Shin et al., 2014; Chou et al., 2016; Jastrzebski et al., 2016). These
changes are dependent on the intensity and/or duration of the
physical performance and generally normalize within a few days
after the race (Wu et al., 2004; Bird et al., 2014).
However, it can happen in very rare cases that an ultra-
marathon can lead to pronounced liver damage (Heneghan et al.,
2014; Carvalho et al., 2016). In a young runner in a 62-km
ultra-marathon a case was described with a heat stroke. As a
result, pronounced rhabdomyolysis and hypoxic hepatitis with
multiple organ failure, including fulminant liver failure, resulted
in intensive care measures. Later, an emergency hepatectomy and
orthotopic liver transplantation had to be performed (Heneghan
et al., 2014). In another case, a 25-year-old man had hyperthermia
with neurological restrictions during an ultra-marathon. In the
further course, acute liver failure occurred and the patient
had to be monitored intensively but recovered again (Carvalho
et al., 2016). Regarding a potential liver damage, the increase
in biomarkers of liver damage is reversible and a serious liver
damage is very seldom to expect.
KIDNEY
During ultra-marathon running, a damage to the kidney with
an impaired renal function is quite often observed (Boulter
et al., 2011). The prevalence of an acute kidney injury in ultra-
marathon running is nearly 50% of all runners (Lipman et al.,
2017).
From a pathophysiological point of view, the skeletal
muscle damage leads to an influx of muscle proteins, such as
myoglobin, into the bloodstream. In certain circumstances, such
as pronounced dehydration or heat, there may be a marked
accumulation in the kidney with consequent kidney damage
(Schiff et al., 1978; Uberoi et al., 1991; Clarkson, 2007).
Regarding
fluid
and
electrolyte
metabolism,
an
ultra-
marathon leads to quite characteristic changes. It seems that
short and fast ultra-marathons are more likely to cause a kidney
problem than longer ultra-marathons at lower speeds (Shin et al.,
2016). An ultra-marathon leads to an increase in creatinine

(Schiff et al., 1978; Uberoi et al., 1991; Clarkson, 2007; Lipman
et al., 2017), urea (Shin et al., 2016), uric acid (Schiff et al.,
1978; Uberoi et al., 1991), sodium (McKechnie et al., 1982;
Bürge et al., 2011; Cejka et al., 2012), potassium (Uberoi et al.,
1991; Kłapcinska et al., 2013; Jastrzebski et al., 2016), calcium
(Fallon et al., 1999a; Kłapcinska et al., 2013) and phosphate
(Fallon et al., 1999a). Furthermore, there is also a characteristic
change in hormones of water and electrolyte metabolism such as
vasopressin (Hew-Butler et al., 2008a, 2011; Rogers et al., 2011),
copeptin (Hew-Butler et al., 2011; Lippi et al., 2015), oxytocin
(Hew-Butler et al., 2008a) and aldosterone (Hew-Butler et al.,
2011; Table 9).
An ultra-marathon often leads to a temporary reduction in
renal function (Lippi et al., 2012a; Lipman et al., 2014, 2016;
Hou et al., 2015; Mrakic-Sposta et al., 2015; Hoffman and
Weiss, 2016), although in some cases all runners tested suffer
from renal impairment (Kao et al., 2015). In rare cases, there
is evidence of a considerably impaired renal function (Irving
et al., 1990). Generally, the kidney function recovers within
one (Kao et al., 2015) to a few days (Kallmeyer and Miller,
1993). In a multi-stage ultra-marathon, the kidney function often
recovers until the next morning’s start (Lipman et al., 2014).
It can also happen that a dialysis-dependent renal insufficiency
develops during an ultra-marathon (Uberoi et al., 1991). Even if a
runner experiences a restriction of renal function during an ultra-
marathon, another ultra-marathon does not necessarily lead to
an additional restriction of kidney function (Irving et al., 1990;
Hoffman and Weiss, 2016). It has been shown that certain people
rather suffer a kidney problem and/or a certain behavior can
preferably lead to a kidney problem.
Risk factors for kidney damage during an ultra-marathon
are female sex, a low body weight and a significant body
weight loss during the run (Lipman et al., 2016). Other risk
factors include severe muscle damage with rhabdomyolysis,
dehydration, hypotension, hyperuricemia, hyponatraemia, poor
competition, and the use of NSAIDs (Seedat et al., 1989;
Clarkson, 2007; Boulter et al., 2011). In ultra-marathoners,
increased rates of acute kidney injury were found in those who
took ibuprofen (Lipman et al., 2017).
From a diagnostic point of view, the test strip method
under field conditions could serve well to detect kidney damage
due to an ultra-marathon. In a certain percentage of finishers,
microhematuria is a sign of kidney damage (Kallmeyer and
Miller, 1993). In 100-mile ultra-marathoners, blood and urine
levels were measured and compared upon arrival at the finish
line. In ultra-marathoners with kidney damage detected by
creatinine levels in the blood, the test strip showed very high
specificity and sensitivity, protein, blood and increased urine
specific gravity (Hoffman et al., 2013b). Damage to the kidneys
occurs very often in ultra-marathon running; however, the
kidney function recovers well within a few days. Similarly to the
liver, serious kidney damage is very seldom to expect.
IMMUNE SYSTEM
It is well-known that intense physical stress leads to tissue damage
(McKune et al., 2005). Experienced ultra-marathoners experience
also a change in the concentration of immunoglobulins after
an ultra-marathon, which might have an impact on the health
of finishers (McKune et al., 2005). An ultra-marathon seems to
lead to an acute inflammatory reaction with classical laboratory
chemical changes (Kasprowicz et al., 2013; Shin and Lee, 2013).
The stress-related inflammation affects the bone marrow and
leads to an increased leukocyte turnover (Spiropoulos et al.,
2010). Markers of an inflammatory process include leucocytes
(Jee et al., 2013; Bird et al., 2014; Chiu et al., 2015; Jastrzebski
et al., 2016; Zakovska et al., 2017), C-reactive protein (Kim
et al., 2009; Wa´
skiewicz et al., 2012; Kasprowicz et al., 2013),
ferritin (Chiu et al., 2015), TNF-α (Nieman et al., 2000; Simons
and Kennedy, 2004; Jee and Jin, 2012; Chiu et al., 2013, 2015),
blood sedimentation reaction, iron (Fallon, 2001), y-interferon
(Simons and Kennedy, 2004), Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist
(Nieman et al., 2000), Interleukin-1b (Simons and Kennedy,
2004; Gill et al., 2015b), Interleukin-8 (Nieman et al., 2000; Gill
et al., 2015b), Interleukin-10 (Nieman et al., 2000; Simons and
Kennedy, 2004; Gill et al., 2015b) and Interleukin-6 (Fallon et al.,
1999a; Wa´
skiewicz et al., 2012; Kasprowicz et al., 2013).
There seems to be an association between the stress on
the immune system and skeletal muscle damage. In 100-km
ultra-marathoners, an association between the markers of the
acute inflammation of the organism (i.e., neutrophils, immature
neutrophils, platelets, and monocytes) and the markers of muscle
damage (i.e., CK, platelets, and LDH) could be demonstrated
(Zakovska et al., 2017).
Ultra-marathoners
often
suffer
from
upper
respiratory
infections after a race (Peters and Bateman, 1983; Peters et al.,
1993). It has been demonstrated that ultra-marathoners are more
likely to suffer from an infection than runners over shorter
distances (Castell, 1996). The infections can already occur 4
weeks before the start and 7–14 days after the end of the
race (Peters et al., 2010). Regarding the frequency of infections,
∼25–30% of runners are affected by an ultra-marathon (Peters
and Bateman, 1983; Nieman et al., 2003). In the “Two Oceans
Marathon” held in Cape Town, South Africa, more than 30% of
runners suffered from upper respiratory tract infections, mainly
affecting the faster runners (Peters and Bateman, 1983). Often,
faster ultra-marathoners have more infections than slower ultra-
marathoners (Peters et al., 2004) while slower ultra-marathoners
have the frequency of infections in the range of persons in a
control group (Peters and Bateman, 1983). It has been shown
that a 24-h ultra-marathon leads to a decrease in salivary flow, a
decrease in salivary IgA, and a decrease in the secretion of salivary
lysozyme (Gill et al., 2013, 2014).
Both the frequency and the severity of an infection after an
ultra-marathon can be favorably influenced. The concentration
of glutamine in the blood is reduced by up to ∼20% after an ultra-
marathon (Castell and Newsholme, 1997). Intake of glutamine
before and after an ultra-marathon reduces the frequency of
infections (Castell, 1996; Castell and Newsholme, 1997, 1998).
In addition to glutamine, vitamin C has beneficial effects on
upper airway infections in ultra-marathoners (Peters, 1997).
The regular intake of vitamin C can improve the resistance to
the increased occurrence of upper respiratory tract infections
and—if an infection nevertheless occurs—somewhat reduce the
severity of the infection (Peters et al., 1993). Even if vitamin
C has an influence on an infection, the intake of vitamin C

 Knechtle and Nikolaidis
Ultra-Marathon Running
does not lead to a change in various infection parameters such
as immune cells, interleukins, or interferon (Nieman et al.,
2002). The amount of vitamin C intake seems important. In
runners who successfully completed the “Comrades Marathon,”
the daily intake of 1,500 mg of vitamin C in the week before
the competition resulted in a significantly lower increase in
interleukins than the daily intake of 500 mg (Nieman et al., 2000).
A higher amount of vitamin C also leads to low increases in
cortisol and adrenaline during the race (Peters et al., 2001a,b).
In very rare cases, an infection after an ultra-marathon can
lead to quite disastrous dimensions. In a 51-year-old runner,
after a multi-stage ultra-marathon, a necrotizing soft tissue
infection of both feet with septicemia occurred. A transmetatarsal
amputation had to be performed on the left and a femoral
amputation on the right side (Huang et al., 2014).
An ultra-marathon seems to have a positive influence on
the immune system (Schobersberger et al., 2000). There is a
correlation between regular endurance training and an increase
in natural killer cells, a subset of lymphocytes and this increase
leads to a favorable influence on the natural immune system
(Francavilla et al., 2005). Even if it is clear that an ultra-marathon
reduces the concentration of immunoglobulins, endurance
exercise with moderate intensity will increase the concentration
of immunoglobulins and reduce the risk of infection (Nieman
and Nehlsen-Cannarella, 1991).
An ultra-marathon seems to lead to a depression of the
immune function with an increased prevalence of infections
of the upper respiratory tract. Most probably the intensity of
running is crucial since running at moderate intensity seems to
increase the concentration of immunoglobulins with a reduced
risk of infections.
ARE ULTRA-MARATHONS BENEFICIAL
FOR HEALTH?
Considering the increased exercise-induced stress for most
physiological systems of human body as demonstrated in the
previous sections of this review, one might assume that the
completion of ultra-marathons must be very health-damaging.
Undoubtedly, the completion of an ultra-marathon has no
immediate health benefits. However, with regards to the length
of the telomeres, training for ultra-marathons seems to have
a certain positive effect in endurance athletes (Borghini et al.,
2015). Particularly, regular endurance training seems to have
a protective effect on telomere length and should slow down
the aging process (Denham et al., 2013). On the other hand,
an extreme ultra-marathon such as “Tor des Géants” (330 km,
24,000 m vertically) leads to shortening of telomeres, probably
due to oxidative damage to the DNA (Borghini et al., 2015).
However, it does not necessarily take such a tremendous run as
the “Tor des Géants”; even a 50-km run might provoke DNA
damage (Mastaloudis et al., 2004b). The production of serum
reactive oxygen species increases during an ultra-marathon
indicating that the antioxidant system restricts the production
of serum reactive oxygen species (Hattori et al., 2009). Thus,
it might be supported that the overall effect of ultra-marathon
on health is positive due to the beneficial role of endurance
exercise.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, considering the increased number of participants
in ultra-marathons, the findings of the present review would
have practical applications for a large number of sports scientists
and sports medicine practitioners working in this field. Ultra-
marathoners seem to be aware of the potential harmful influence
on health, but also know that the side effects of ultra-marathon
running are reversible within a few days. It should be highlighted
that only one review had been conducted previously concerning
only ultra-marathoners which focused on a very specific
topic (neuromuscular fatigue) (Millet, 2011). Other reviews
examined musculoskeletal injuries of both ultra-marathoners
and other distance runners (e.g., marathon and shorter distances)
(Kluitenberg et al., 2015; Videbæk et al., 2015). Thus, the present
review is the most comprehensive review ever conducted on
physiology and pathophysiology in ultra-marathon.
