Addiction is often characterized by intense motivation for a drug, which may be narrowly focused at the expense of other rewards. Here,
we examined the role of amygdala-related circuitry in the amplification and narrowing of motivation focus for intravenous cocaine. We
paired optogenetic channelrhodopsin (ChR2) stimulation in either central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) or basolateral amygdala (BLA) of
female rats with one particular nose-poke porthole option for earning cocaine infusions (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.). A second alternative porthole
earned identical cocaine but without ChR2 stimulation. Consequently, CeA rats quickly came to pursue their CeA ChR2-paired cocaine
option intensely and exclusively, elevating cocaine intake while ignoring their alternative cocaine alone option. By comparison, BLA
ChR2 pairing failed to enhance cocaine motivation. CeA rats also emitted consummatory bites toward their laser-paired porthole,
suggesting that higher incentive salience made that cue more attractive. A separate progressive ratio test of incentive motivation con-
firmedthatCeAChR2amplifiedrats’motivation,raisingtheirbreakpointeffortpriceforcocaineby10-fold.However,CeAChR2laseron
its own lacked any reinforcement value: laser by itself was never self-stimulated, not even by the same rats in which it amplified
motivation for cocaine. Conversely, CeA inhibition by muscimol/baclofen microinjections prevented acquisition of cocaine self-
administration and laser preference, whereas CeA inhibition by optogenetic halorhodopsin suppressed cocaine intake, indicating that
CeA circuitry is needed for ordinary cocaine motivation. We conclude that CeA ChR2 excitation paired with a cocaine option specifically
focuses and amplifies motivation to produce intense pursuit and consumption focused on that single target.

Introduction
In addiction, intense motivation often becomes narrowly focused
on an addictive reward target, whereas other alternative rewards
may be relatively ignored. How does limbic circuitry narrow the
focus of incentive motivation to a single drug target, making that
target more intensely ‘wanted’ at the expense of other alternatives?
Amygdala-related circuitry assigns motivational significance to
particular stimuli based partly on associative information (Weisk-
rantz, 1956; LeDoux, 2000; Balleine and Killcross, 2006; Mahler and
Berridge, 2009; Haubensak et al., 2010; DiFeliceantonio and Ber-
ridge, 2012; Peck et al., 2013; Janak and Tye, 2015; Yasoshima et al.,
2015). In human addicts, drug cues can activate amygdala and re-
lated mesocorticolimbic circuitry and trigger urges to take drugs
(Tang et al., 2012; Volkow et al., 2013). Within the amygdala, the
basolateral nucleus (BLA) and the central nucleus (CeA) are se-
rially connected. However, the CeA may be especially effective in
generating intense incentive motivation that is narrowly focused

Significance Statement
In addiction, intense incentive motivation often becomes narrowly focused on a particular drug of abuse. Here we show that
pairing central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) optogenetic stimulation with one option for earning intravenous cocaine makes that
option almost the exclusive focus of intense pursuit and consumption. CeA stimulation also elevated the effort cost rats were
willing to pay for cocaine and made associated cues become intensely attractive. However, we also show that CeA laser had no
reinforcing properties at all when given alone for the same rats. Therefore, CeA laser pairing makes its associated cocaine option
and cues become powerfully attractive in a nearly addictive fashion.

 on a particular stimulus target when neurochemically or optoge-
netically stimulated (Mahler and Berridge, 2009; DiFeliceantonio
and Berridge, 2012; Robinson et al., 2014; Seo et al., 2016). The
CeA is also implicated in the strengthening of cue-triggered crav-
ing for addictive drugs during incubation in animals (Lu et al.,
2005; Lu et al., 2007; Li et al., 2015), which might reflect incentive
sensitization. The special role of CeA in generating intense motiva-
tion may be related to its status as a GABAergic “striatum-level
structure” within a cortico-striato-pallidal macrosystem frame-
work (Alheid and Heimer, 1988; Swanson and Petrovich, 1998;
Zahm, 2006).
In a previous study, we reported that associative pairing of
brief optogenetic ChR2 stimulations of CeA with pressing a par-
ticular lever to obtain sucrose pellet rewards caused rats to pursue
that sole sucrose option intensely and narrowly, whereas ignoring
an alternative lever that earned equal sucrose but without laser
(Robinson et al., 2014). However, seemingly paradoxically, the
CeA ChR2 stimulation by itself appeared worthless as a reinforcer
to the same rats, as indicated by their failure to self-stimulate for
CeA laser illumination by itself. This discrepancy suggested that
value was not simply transferred from CeA ChR2 activation as an
additive reinforcement signal, but rather that CeA ChR2 actively
transformed the motivational value specifically of the laser-paired
lever or its sucrose reward to make that reward option exclusively
and intensely more attractive than the alternative (Robinson et al.,
2014).
Our hypothesis is that stimulation of CeA circuitry narrows
the focus of incentive motivation to its paired reward target and
simultaneously raises the intensity of attraction, as happens in
addiction. If so, then CeA ChR2 control of incentive motivation
should also apply to earning an addictive drug reward such as
intravenous cocaine. Here, we tested whether CeA ChR2 pairing
would intensify and narrow pursuit to a single paired cocaine
self-administration option while making rats ignore another al-
ternative and equally good cocaine option. Our results confirmed
that prediction and showed further that intense consummatory
oral responses, including bites, became directed toward the
paired metal cocaine-associated porthole as though unusually
intense incentive salience were attributed to that paired cue. Fur-
ther, CeA ChR2 stimulation also intensified the breakpoint effort
pricethatratswerewillingtopayforcocaine,whichfurtherindicates
amplification of incentive motivation. Conversely, normal CeA
function appeared to be needed for cocaine self-administration ac-
quisition in this task because CeA pharmacological inhibition com-
pletely prevented self-administration acquisition in our two-choice
task and halorhodopsin inhibition of CeA slightly suppressed co-
caineintake.However,CeAChR2excitationalonecompletelyfailed

Materials and Methods
Subjects
Female Sprague Dawley rats (n � 55), weighing 250–300 g at surgery,
were housed at �21°C constant temperature on a reverse 12 h light/dark
cycle. Estrus cycle was monitored via cervical smear. All rats had ad
libitum access to both food and water in their home cage throughout the
experiment. All experimental procedures were approved by the Univer-
sity Committee on the Use and Care of Animals at the University of
Michigan.
Surgery
Optogenetic virus infusion and optic fiber implant
Rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injections of ketamine
(100 mg/kg; Henry Schein) and xylazine (7 mg/kg; Henry Schein) and
received atropine (0.04 mg/kg; Henry Schein) before surgery. At surgery,
each rat also received subcutaneous injections of chloramphenicol so-
dium succinate (60 mg/kg, Henry Schein) to prevent infection and
carprofen (5 mg/kg, Henry Schein) for pain relief. Rats again received
carprofen (5 mg/kg) 24 h later and were allowed at least 3 weeks for
recovery and viral expression before behavioral testing began. Each rat
was placed in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments) and
received bilateral infusions of an AAV ChR2 virus with human Synapsin
promoter to infect neurons (AAV5-Hsyn-ChR2-eYFP; UNC Vector Core,
Chapel Hill, NC). Virus infusions were targeted either into the central
nucleus of amygdala (CeA; bregma A/P: �2.4, M/L: �4.0, D/V: �7.6;
mouth bar set to �3.3; n � 15) or into the basolateral amygdala as an
anatomical comparison site (BLA; A/P: �1.92, M/L: �5.0, D/V: �8.0;
mouth bar set to �3.3; n � 6). A total of 1 �l volume of virus per side was
infused over 10 min at a constant rate (0.1 �l/min), and the injector was
subsequently left in place for an additional 10 min to allow for diffusion.
To test the effects of optogenetic inhibition in a separate group of rats
(n � 7), a 1 �l volume of the inhibitory AAV halorhodopsin virus under
the human synapsin promoter was infused into CeA using the same
coordinates and at the same rate (AAV5-HSYN-eNpHR3.0-eYFP, UNC
Vector Core). To serve as inactive virus controls, other rats received an
infusion of optically inactive control virus that was identical except that it
lacked either the ChR2 or the eNpHR3.0 gene (n � 10; AAV5-Hsyn-
eYFP, UNC Vector Core). For all rats receiving virus in CeA, bilateral
fiber optics (200 �m) were implanted during the same surgery, each
aimed at 0.3 mm dorsal to the rat’s virus infusion.
To test the effects of pharmacological inhibition of CeA and to
assess normal function contribution to cocaine motivation via mus-
cimol/baclofen microinjections, a separate group of rats (n � 9) were
implanted with microinjection guide cannulae bilaterally with tips
located 1 mm above CeA (22-gauge stainless steel, 11 mm long; Plas-
tics One; AP��2, ML �4, DV�6.8). Dummy cannulas were inserted
to prevent occlusion.
Finally, we tested the combination of optogenetic stimulation plus
pharmacological inhibition at the same CeA site to assess whether mus-
cimol/baclofen microinjections would prevent CeA ChR2 optogenetic
stimulation from enhancing cocaine motivation. A separate group of rats
initially received only bilateral CeA ChR2 virus (AAV5-Hsyn-ChR2-eYFP).
During intrajugular catheter implantation 3 weeks later, these same an-
imals were also implanted with bilateral chronic guide cannula with tips
implanted 1 mm above the same CeA virus sites (n � 8).
Intravenous catheter implantation
Chronic intravenous jugular catheters for subsequent intravenous deliv-
ery of cocaine solutions were implanted in a separate surgery �3 weeks
later (Crombag et al., 2001). Briefly, after similar anesthesia and periop-
erative treatment as above, a Silastic intrajugular catheter (internal diam-
eter � 0.28 mm; external diameter � 0.61 mm; dead volume � 12 �l;
Plastics One) was threaded into the right jugular vein. The outer end was
passed under the skin toward the head along the dorsal neck and exited
from a secure subcutaneous anchor at the midscapular region. Rats were
allowed to recover for 7–10 d after surgery before beginning behavioral
training. Catheters were flushed daily with a 0.2 ml of isotonic saline
solution containing 5 mg/ml gentamicin sulfate (Sparhawk) to prevent
infection and occlusions for the first 10 d. After 10 d, catheters continued
to be flushed daily with 0.2 ml of sterile isotonic saline alone (without
gentamicin). Catheter patency was tested once before behavioral testing
and again after the end of all tests by making an intravenous injection of
0.2 ml of methohexital sodium to induce anesthesia (20 mg/ml in sterile

 water; JHP). Rats that became ataxic within 10 s were considered to have
a patent catheter and were included in behavioral analyses.
Behavioral procedures
Instrumental choice of laser � cocaine versus cocaine alone
Excitation of amygdala. Briefly, each rat was trained to earn intravenous
cocaine infusions instrumentally by making nose pokes into either one of
two portholes and then choosing between them. The portholes were on
the same wall �5 cm apart and detected nose pokes via beam breaks.
Both portholes delivered cocaine infusions (0.3 mg salt weight per kg
weight of the rat in 50 �l volume infused over 2.8 s; National Institute on
Drug Abuse, Bethesda) dissolved in 0.9% sterile saline on a fixed ratio 1
(FR1) schedule. In addition, one porthole (laser � cocaine port) arbi-
trarily designated for each rat delivered an 8 s optogenetic CeA ChR2 or
BLA ChR2 stimulation (8–10 mW blue laser at 473 nm, 25 Hz, 15 ms ON,
25 ms OFF for 8 s train), which began with the final nose poke and
continued during and immediately after the infusion. Stimulation pa-
rameters were based on Kravitz and Kreitzer (2011) and Robinson et al.
(2014). The 8 s duration was aimed to paste photoexcitation onto the
auditory cue at time of reward delivery. The other porthole (cocaine
alone) delivered an equal infusion of cocaine alone, but without any laser
illumination. Each port’s infusion was also accompanied by a distinctive
8 s auditory cue (either white noise or tone counterbalanced between
the two ports). Both portholes were permanently fixed in position for
some rats (n � 9 CeA ChR2; n � 2 BLA ChR2) and always present in the
chamber: each was illuminated whenever it was active and able to earn
cocaine. Both portholes were movable for other rats (n � 5 CeA ChR2: 4
bilateral CeA illumination; 1 unilateral CeA illumination; n � 4 BLA
ChR2). Movable portholes were usually kept retracted into the wall and
were only inserted into the chamber when actively available to earn co-
caine. At the beginning of each session, for both porthole types, only one
porthole was actively available to earn cocaine (illuminated if fixed in
place; inserted into the chamber if movable). Next, only the alternative
porthole was activated (illuminated or inserted), whereas the first porthole
was dimmed or retracted. This initial one-at-a-time presentation ensured
that a rat was exposed to each porthole and its outcome every day. Sub-
sequently, both portholes were inserted or illuminated together for the
remainder of each session, allowing the rat to choose freely between the
two portholes for the rest of the hour. Chambers (Med Associates) with
clear Plexiglas floors (30.5 � 24.1 � 21.0 cm) were used for training and
testing instrumental cocaine self-administration and contained an audi-
tory speaker (for tone/white noise components of conditioned stimulus,
CS). An infusion pump was located outside of the sound-attenuated
chamber to allow for cocaine delivery. A video camera placed below the
transparent chamber floor recorded the rat’s behavior for subsequent
analysis of consummatory behaviors and stereotypy.
Rats were trained and tested for 10 d on instrumental self-administration
of intravenous cocaine (CeA ChR2 virus: n � 15; BLA ChR2 virus: n � 6;
CeA/BLA control inactive virus: n � 8; CeA eNpHR (halorhodopsin)
inhibitory opsin virus: n � 7). The first day began with a 2 h session and
subsequent days were 1 h sessions. Nose pokes into either porthole
earned a 0.3 mg/kg infusion of cocaine hydrochloride. The session always
began with one porthole illuminated or inserted and available to earn
cocaine (either laser � cocaine or cocaine alone, with the order counter-
balanced across rats). Once cocaine was earned, the other porthole was
activated next until cocaine was earned on it. This one-at-a-time presen-
tation cycle was repeated a second time. Subsequently, both portholes
remained equally available to earn cocaine for the rest of the session.
Assignment of an auditory cue to laser-paired porthole versus the differ-
ent auditory cue to the cocaine-alone porthole was always the same for a
given rat across all days, but was counterbalanced between rats. For both
portholes, a 20 s timeout period was imposed after each cocaine infusion
earned, during which subsequent nose pokes into either hole had no
consequence (see Fig. 1). Rats were required to sample from both
cocaine-delivering ports at least twice each day on the first 2 d and all rats
met this criterion and so continued in the experiment: 85% of rats (11/
13) within the first hour on the first day, the remaining 15% during the
second hour of the first day, and 100% in the first hour on the second day.
All subsequent sessions lasted 60 min or 40 infusions, whichever oc-
curred first. Any rat that failed to nose poke at least 5 times per session
over three consecutive sessions within the first 10 d was excluded from
analyses (n � 2). For all rats, every nose poke earned a cocaine infusion
on an FR1 schedule throughout days 1–10 (i.e., one nose poke earned an
infusion, followed by 20 s timeout).
Inhibition of amygdala (halorhodopsin or muscimol/baclofen). For rats
receiving halorhodopsin inhibition of CeA for loss-of-function studies
(n � 7), all procedures were identical except that a constant yellow laser
(8–10 mW, 592 nm) was bilaterally substituted for CeA illumination in
place of blue laser during training. The yellow laser (592 nm; 8 s constant
duration; 8–10 mW) was associatively paired with each time cocaine was
earned on one of the two cocaine portholes. CeA halorhodopsin rats were
trained either with fixed nose-poke ports (n � 2 rats) or retractable ports
that were usually retracted but phasically inserted separately for initial
one-at-a time self-administration opportunities each session or together
to allow choice between the two for the remainder of each session (n � 5
rats). Training at an FR1 schedule continued for 10 d as above, with 8 s
yellow laser bins paired with one cocaine option (counterbalanced across
rats). On an additional day 11 test, the yellow laser was illuminated
constantly for the entire 1 h session (592 nm, 8–10 mW), whereas rats
received the same schedule of cocaine options as on days 1–10 to detect
whether constant optogenetic CeA inhibition would suppress cocaine
consumption.
For rats receiving pharmacological GABAergic inhibition of CeA daily
during training (muscimol/baclofen: n � 5 rats; vehicle: n � 4 rats),
bilateral microinjections were delivered 15 min before the rat was placed
in the self-administration chamber beginning on day 3 and for each day
following. To give microinjections, a rat was gently cradled by the exper-
imenter’s arms and microinjectors were inserted into each bilateral guide
cannula (microinjectors � 21 mm long, so as to extend 1 mm below
ventral tip of guide cannula; Plastics One). Bilateral microinjections of a
mixture of GABAA agonist muscimol (Tocris Bioscience) and the
GABAB agonist baclofen (Tocris Bioscience) (0.1 �g/0.2 �l of each com-
bined in a single 0.5 �l volume of artificial CSF, ACSF) was delivered per
side. Vehicle control rats received identical volume microinjections of
ACSF alone. Doses and volumes were based on prior studies using
muscimol/baclofen combinations in amygdala (Mahler and Berridge,
2009; Ho and Berridge, 2014). Microinjections were delivered by sy-
ringe pump at a rate of 0.5 �l over 1 min and the microinjector was left
in place for an extra minute to allow for drug diffusion. For the first
2 d of training, rats were only hooked up to intravenous catheter to
allow habituation. Afterward, from days 3–10, an optic fiber and cable
were also attached to the head cap to match test conditions for opto-
genetic rats as described above.
Combined CeA ChR2 excitation � muscimol/baclofen inhibition. To test
whether GABAergic inhibition would block CeA ChR2 enhancement of
motivation, this group of rats received optogenetic CeA ChR2 excitation
combined with pharmacological inhibition of the same CeA sites (n � 4).
Rats first received microinjections of muscimol/baclofen 15 min before
each session from days 1–4. After microinfusion, microinjector tips were
removed and replaced by optogenetic fibers secured in place by being
screwed on to the cannula guide thread. At the end of each session,
optogenetic fibers were removed and replaced by dummy cannulas. On
every day, rats were trained with CeA ChR2 stimulation in the two-choice
task with identical procedures as for the CeA ChR2 group above. To test
whether any CeA inhibition effects on behavior seen on days 1–4 were
permanent or state dependent, no muscimol/baclofen microinjections
were administered before sessions on days 5–6. Each rat had either fixed
portholes throughout all days (n � 2 muscimol/baclofen, n � 2 vehicle
rats) or retractable portholes throughout all days (n � 2 muscimol/
baclofen, n � 2 vehicle rats).
Progressive ratio test of breakpoint: does CeA ChR2 amplify
effort to obtain cocaine?
To assess independently whether CeA ChR2 stimulation amplified the
intensity of incentive motivation to earn cocaine, a progressive ratio test
of instrumental effort was used to obtain a breakpoint measure on 2
successive days. On one day (order counterbalanced across rats), only the
laser � cocaine instrumental nose port and outcome was offered (CeA

 ChR2: n � 9 unilateral and n � 3 bilateral; CeA control virus: n � 5). On
the other day, only the cocaine alone port and outcome was offered. The
alternative nose port was removed each day and replaced with wall in-
serts. Within each session, the number of nose pokes required to earn the
next cocaine infusion (0.3 mg/kg) was increased after every cocaine re-
ward according to an exponential progressive ratio schedule (1, 2, 4, 6, 9,
12, 15, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 62, 77, 95, 118, 145, . . . ) derived from the
formula PR � [5e (reward number � 0.2)] � 5 and rounded to the nearest
integer (Richardson and Roberts, 1996; Saunders and Robinson, 2011;
Robinson et al., 2014). Each cocaine infusion was followed by a 20 s
timeout identical to that imposed during the instrumental two-choice
test.
Laser self-stimulation (CeA laser self-administration
without cocaine)
To investigate more directly whether CeA ChR2 excitation was an inde-
pendent reinforcer, the same rats from above could earn CeA laser self-
stimulation pulses alone by performing new responses in three different
situations. In an “active-response” self-stimulation task, rats could earn
CeA laser illuminations by simply touching one of two empty water spouts.
In a second active response self-stimulation task using an instrumental re-
sponse more similar to that used in our cocaine self-administration task,
drug-naive rats could earn CeA laser illuminations by making a nose
poke into a fixed porthole on 2 consecutive days. In a third, “passive
response” self-stimulation task, rats could earn CeA laser illuminations
by simply going to a particular location or even just remaining in that
location.
In the spout self-stimulation active task (spout-touch task), rats were
placed into Med Associates operant chambers equipped with 2 novel and
empty sipper spouts on the back wall of the chamber positioned �5 cm
apart. A metal grid floor was wired to close a circuit to detect contacts at
each spout. Touching one spout (designated as “active spout”; spout
assignment counterbalanced between rats) delivered CeA laser stimula-
tion (25 Hz; 8–10 mW; FR1 schedule; some rats always earned a 1 s pulse,
n � 6, and other rats always earned an 8 s pulse, n � 7; no auditory cue).
The 1 s pulse was used because it has supported optogenetic self-
stimulation in previous studies (Witten et al., 2011; Kravitz et al., 2012).
The 8 s pulse was used for other rats because it was identical in parameters
used to amplify motivation for cocaine in our drug self-administration
task above. Touching the other available spout produced no consequence
and its contacts simply served as a control measure for exploratory
touches, general motor activity, or habitual spout investigation. Each
self-stimulation test lasted 30 min and each rat was tested repeatedly on 3
consecutive days.
In the nose-poke self-stimulation active task, procedures were sim-
ilar to the spout task above, but with portholes rather than two spouts
(n � 6). The active porthole (arbitrarily assigned) earned either 1 or
8 s pulses of 8 mW, 25 Hz laser illuminations (pulse duration was
counterbalanced across rats, but always the same for an entire 1 h
session on a given day).
In the place-based self-stimulation passive task, a rat could earn real-
time CeA laser stimulation simply by going to a particular corner loca-
tion within a four-corner chamber to trigger a motion detector or simply
by making any further movement while remaining in that corner (Rob-
inson et al., 2014). This place-based self-stimulation task was modeled on
the original Olds and Milner (1954) demonstration of deep-brain elec-
trode self-stimulation, in which a rat earned electrode stimulation simply
by going to a particular corner of a table. The apparatus consisted of a
four-corner square Plexiglas chamber (38 � 38 cm) with bedding on the
floor. A Plexiglas cylinder occluded the center of the chamber (20 cm
diameter) so that rats were confined to the outer perimeter, where they
could perambulate freely to enter or leave any of the four corners of the
chamber. Each corner contained an infrared motion detector (Visonic)
46 cm above the floor that was triggered if the rat entered and by any
subsequent movement within the corner. Entry into a designated corner
delivered a pulse of CeA ChR2 laser illumination lasting either 1 or 8 s
duration for different rats (25 Hz, 8–10 mW). Exit from that corner
always terminated the laser. The same corner was always used for a given
individual rat on every session, but different rats were assigned randomly
to different corners. Each self-stimulation session lasted 30 min and each
rat received three repeated sessions, one per day.
Switch from laser � cocaine to laser alone: can CeA ChR2
laser maintain responses during drug extinction?
As a final test of laser self-stimulation, we assessed whether CeA ChR2
stimulation by itself would at least maintain instrumental nose-poke
responding after a substantial level of this response already had been well
established by laser � cocaine combination. To test this, CeA ChR2 rats
from the cocaine self-administration group above (n � 7) were retrained
for 2 d on the two-choice task (laser � cocaine vs cocaine alone; FR1
schedule; days 20–21) to reestablish and confirm their nose-poke re-
sponse. Then cocaine was discontinued from both portholes for 4 suc-
cessive test days (days 22–25) to convert the task to pure CeA ChR2 laser
self-stimulation (now without cocaine: cocaine extinction). On these
cocaine extinction days, nose pokes into the original laser � cocaine
porthole still earned 8 s bins of laser alone as before (8 s, 25 Hz, 8–10
mW) and both portholes delivered their associated auditory cues, but
neither porthole delivered cocaine infusions. In other words, on days
22–25, rats had a choice between laser alone versus nothing while per-
forming the same instrumental responses that were reinforced previously
by cocaine. For the next 3 d (days 26–28), laser was discontinued in

 addition to cocaine and nose pokes into either
port only delivered their associated auditory
cues (nothing vs nothing).
Anatomical localization: sites, virus
expression, Fos plumes, and
localization of function maps
At the end of behavioral testing, rats were
deeply anesthetized with an overdose of so-
dium pentobarbital (150–200 mg/kg) and
transcardially perfused 75 min after receiving
laser. For ChR2 experiments, blue laser (8–
10mW) was administered at 25 Hz, 8 s ON 22 s
OFF cycle for 30 min duration immediately
before anesthetization. For halorhodopsin
(eNpHR) experiments, constant yellow laser
(8–10 mW) was bilaterally illuminated con-
tinuously for 30 min duration before anesthetiza-
tion. Brains were stored in 4% paraformaldehyde,
cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and sliced at
40 �m coronal sections for identification of
optic fiber placements and virus expression.
Brains were additionally processed for Fos pro-
tein expression and for Fos plumes surround-
ing the illuminated optic fiber (CeA ChR2: n �
5; BLA ChR2: n � 5; CeA eNpHR: n � 6). Slices
were blocked in 5% normal donkey serum/
0.2% Triton-X solution for 30 min before be-
ing incubated for 24 h in a polyclonal rabbit
anti-c-fos IgG primary antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; 1:1000 dilution; lot #K0415,
RRID: AB_2106783), followed 1 d later by 2 h in Alexa Fluor 594 donkey
anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Life Technologies; 3:1000 dilution;
lot #1668652, RRID: AB_141637) (Faure et al., 2008). Sections were
mounted, air-dried, and coverslipped with ProLong Gold anti-fade re-
agent (Invitrogen). Control virus rats that also received laser illumina-
tion before perfusion (total n � 10; CeA blue laser: n � 4; BLA blue laser:
n � 3; CeA yellow laser: n � 3) served as controls to compare baseline
effects of laser illumination on local Fos plumes (Stujenske et al., 2015).
Additional unoperated rats (no surgery; completely naive) served as nor-
mal baseline controls to determine spontaneous baseline levels of Fos
expression in CeA and BLA (n � 6).
Fiber-optic sites, GFP virus expression, and Fos expression was mea-
sured using images taken with a Leica microscope (Leica at 10� and 40�
magnification and marked in Adobe Illustrator (RRID: SCR:014198) on
a rat brain atlas (Paxinos and Watson, 2007). For each CeA site, nine
images (3 � 3; 10� magnification) were compiled using Oasis Sur-
veyor software (Objective Imaging; RRID: SCR014433) into one single
image centered on the fiber tip and spread/intensity of virus and neuro-
nal Fos expression surrounding the tip was mapped. Our procedure used
for measuring Fos plumes surrounding a fiber-optic tip induced by ChR2
photostimulation was modified from Robinson et al. (2014). Immuno-
reactivity for Fos-like protein was visualized using a fluorescent micros-
copy filter with an excitation band at 515–545 nm for Fos-positive cells.
The number of Fos-expressing cells was counted within successive
blocks (50 � 50 �m) along eight radial arms emanating from the
fiber-optic tip at 10� magnification. Counts continued outward
along an arm until at least two sequential blocks contained zero Fos-
labeled cells, which was taken as marking the radius of the Fos plume
along that arm. Intensities of Fos elevation in neurons were calculated
in terms of percentage change from either of two baselines: (1) inac-
tive virus control baseline: CeA tissue from rats with an optically
inactive control virus containing the GFP gene but lacking the ChR2
gene, which received laser illumination before perfusion similarly to
ChR2 rats; and (2) normal tissue baseline: CeA or BLA counts of Fos
from unoperated control brains of normal rats. Elevations were de-
noted in increments of �200% elevation above the respective two
baselines or higher at �300% elevation above. Inhibitory suppres-
sions were denoted in decrements of �0.75 fraction relative to the two
baselines (i.e., �25% suppressions) and �0.50 fractions (i.e., �50%
suppressions). The local region surrounding a fiber tip that expressed
Fos elevation was considered to constitute the local stimulated “Fos
plume” and its diameter and volume reflected the extent of local
neuronal activation induced by laser illumination in CeA ChR2 rats.
Conversely, the local region surrounding a fiber tip that expressed Fos
suppression was considered to constitute the local inhibited “Fos
anti-plume,” with its diameter and volume reflecting the extent to
which neuronal activation was suppressed using halorhodopsin. The
size of measured stimulated Fos plume was used to assign the scaled
size of symbols expressing behavioral consequences in brain atlas
maps showing localization of function, in which the color of symbols
represented behavioral effects produced at particular sites (see Fig. 3).
For quantification of viral spread around the fiber-optic tip, GFP-
labeled cells were counted individually within successive blocks (50 � 50
�m) along eight radial arms emanating from the fiber-optic tip at 10�
magnification (Robinson et al., 2014). The number of GFP-labeled cells
in each block was counted to assess the intensity of virus expression at
each point and to measure the radius of GFP expression along each arm.
Intensity of virus infection was mapped as elevations over normal zero
baselines.
Statistical analysis
Results were analyzed in SPSS software (RRID: SCR:002865) using
repeated-measures ANOVAs to examine responses for either nose port
over training days, followed by t tests for individual comparisons on
specific days with Bonferroni corrections. For non-normally distributed
data, including all progressive ratio tests, Friedman’s two-way ANOVAs
were used as nonparametric within-subject tests and Kruskal–Wallis
one-way ANOVAs for between-subject tests, followed by Wilcoxon’s
sign-ranked/Mann–Whitney tests for individual comparisons. Effect
sizes for parametric tests were calculated using Cohen’s d and for non-
parametric tests using r �
Z
�N1 � N2
. For all analyses, the significance
level was set at p � 0.05, two-tailed.

 Results
Two-choice instrumental task
CeA ChR2 laser pairing made rats prefer their laser � cocaine
option by �2:1 over the cocaine alone option as early as the first
day in the 2-choice cocaine self-administration task, in which rats
could choose between earning either intravenous infusions of
cocaine alone or cocaine plus unilateral CeA ChR2 laser illumi-
nation (laser � cocaine) (Fig. 1, Movie 1). By the third day, CeA
ChR2 preference reached a 4:1 ratio and statistical significance
(n � 10; t(9) � 2.52, p � 0.03, Cohen’s d � 1.23, 95% CI � 0.99
to 18.4) and continued to rise to 10:1 or more by the 10 th day of
FR1 training (t(9) � 3.79, p � 0.004, d � 1.8, 95% CI � 7.5 to 30;
Fig. 2A).
Bilateral delivery of CeA ChR2 laser stimulation (n � 5 rats)
magnified the strength of laser � cocaine preference even more
than unilateral CeA laser (n � 10 rats; laser � uni/bilateral: F(1,13) �
4.48, p � 0.027; all rats received bilateral CeA ChR2 virus micro-
injections and bilateral implantation of optic fibers, but a single
fiber coupling failed in some rats, resulting in unilateral CeA
ChR2 stimulation). For example, on day 1, bilateral CeA ChR2
stimulation produced a 4:1 preference for the laser � cocaine
option compared with 2:1 for unilateral stimulation (laser � uni/
bilateral: F(1,13) � 2.15, p � 0.16). By day 10, bilateral stimulation
produced an 18:1 preference (t(4) � 59.0, p � 0.000, 95% CI � 33
to 37; d � 1.73) compared with only 10:1 for unilateral stimula-
tion (see above; laser � uni/bilateral: F(1,13) � 5.49, p � 0.036).
Further, bilateral CeA ChR2 rats took nearly double the amount
of cocaine via their laser � cocaine option (11.4 mg/kg total
cocaine; maximum of 39 infusions per day on days 6–10) com-
pared with unilateral rats (7 mg/kg total cocaine; 23 infusions on
day 10) (t(12) � 2.7, p � 0.019, 95% CI � �8.8 to �1; d � �2.34).
In contrast, rats with ChR2 virus in BLA failed to develop any
consistent preference between laser � cocaine versus cocaine
alone (n � 6; F(1,5) � 4.253, p � 0.095; Fig. 2C) and did not differ
from inactive virus control rats in random laser � cocaine pref-
erence (F(1,9) � 0.003, p � 0.96). Therefore, BLA ChR2 rats chose
more or less equally between the two options and were signifi-
cantly different from CeA ChR2 rats, which preferred laser �
cocaine (F(1,17) � 11.4, p � 0.004). CeA ChR2 rats (both bilateral
and unilateral) also consumed more total cocaine overall on day
10 than did BLA ChR2 rats (29 vs 9 total infusions or 3 mg/kg
total cocaine; t(18) � 3.54, p � 0.002, 95%CI � 2.42, 9.5; Fig. 2B).
Total nose-poke responses (laser � cocaine and cocaine alone
combined) by BLA ChR2 rats were actually less than control virus

earned bilateral stimulation and 2 rats earned unilateral stimula-

CeA inactive virus control rats with illuminated fiber optics in

laser � cocaine option over cocaine alone and continued to choose
equallybetweenthetwooptionsforall10d(n�5;F(1,4)�0.77,p�

randomly)differedfromallCeAChR2rats(whichpreferredlaser�
cocaine) (F(1,19) � 6.52, p � 0.02). For example, on day 10, inac-
tive virus rats poked less at their laser � cocaine port than either
unilateral or bilateral CeA ChR2 rats (t(19) � 2.6, p � 0.01, d �
1.79, 95% CI � �33.6 to �3.4) and poked more at their cocaine
alone port than CeA ChR2 rats (t(17) � 3.1, p � 0.006, d � 1.4,
95% CI � 3 to 15.6). However, overall, inactive virus rats con-
sumed less cocaine than CeA ChR2 rats (5 mg/kg cocaine total in
17 infusions vs 7 mg/kg unilateral CeA ChR2 and 11.4 mg/kg
bilateral; F(2,22) � 6.35, p � 0.002; Fig. 2B).
Total responding for cocaine on the last day (laser � cocaine
and cocaine alone) did not differ across phases of the estrus cycle
either at the beginning (unilateral CeA rats: F(1,4) � 2.35, p � 0.2;
bilateral CeA rats: F(1,3) � 0.6, p � 0.5; BLA rats F(1,3) � 0.01, p �
0.92) or at the end (unilateral rats: F(1,4) � 0.02, p � 0.89; bilateral
CeA rats: F(1,3) � 0.6, p � 0.5; BLA rats F(1,3) � 0.01, p � 0.92) of
training for any rats.
Fos plumes versus virus infections: Fos plume sites determine
localization of function
ChR2 Fos plumes were much smaller than CeA or BLA zones of
virus infection, so the mean Fos plume radius (0.2 mm outer
radius of doubled elevation) was used to set the size of individual
map symbols in Figure 3. Histological analysis of GFP expression
revealed zones of ChR2 virus infection averaging �1.8 mm di-
ameter in either CeA or BLA, forming an approximately spherical
volume of 2.6 mm 3 and often filling most of either CeA (CeA
volume is 2.4 mm 3) or BLA. In CeA, optic fiber tips were concen-
trated mostly in the caudal and middle AP zones of CeA (Fig. 3)
and were distributed mediolaterally in approximately equal
numbers in the medial subdivision of CeA (CeM; n � 5), lateral
subdivision of CeA (CeL; n � 5), and capsular subdivision of CeA
(CeC; n � 4). In BLA, sites were scattered throughout midrostral
BLA extent and more laterally. Mapping of CeA fiber sites that
were behaviorally effective in the two-choice task revealed that
sites in CeM subdivision and in CeL comparably support CeA
ChR2 induction of a 25:1 preference ratio for laser � cocaine
(Fig. 3). Two sites in CeC capsular nucleus slightly dorsal to CeM
or CeL were also effective at amplifying motivation for cocaine. In
contrast, BLA sites were generally ineffective at enhancing co-
caine pursuit. In fact, a few BLA sites appeared to produce nega-
tive avoidance of their laser-paired cocaine option by at least 3:1
to 5:1 ratios (though not significant for the entire BLA ChR2
group) and further actually suppressed total cocaine intake
slightly compared with inactive virus controls (F(1,9) � 33.6,
p � 0.000).
Laser illumination of fibers in CeA ChR2 rats produced 0.02
mm 3 Fos plumes of elevated expression surrounding the fiber-
optic tips compared with either control levels measured in inac-
tive virus rats (0.14 mm radius; F(1,6) � 19.2, p � 0.000, 95% CI �
�0.173 to �0.063) or CeA tissue from normal unoperated rats
(F(1,3) � 15.6, p � 0.001, 95% CI � �0.189 to �0.061). Fos
plumes contained a tiny � 0.01 mm 3 center of intense �300%
Fos elevation (3.4 � 0.2 Fos� neurons), compared with illumi-
nation in control rats with inactive virus (0.0114 � 0.11 Fos� neu-
rons) (also �300% above CeA levels in unoperated control brains:
0.0042 � 0.065 Fos� neurons). The intense center was surrounded
by a larger 0.02 mm3 volume outer plume of less-intense 200% Fos
elevation, which was arrowhead shaped and extended farthest 0.21
mmventrallybeneaththeilluminatedtip(range0.07�0.2mminall
directions) and elevation declined from 150% toward baseline
within 0.2–4 mm below the fiber-optic tip (Fig. 4). CeA ChR2 laser
illumination induced Fos plumes of similar sizes regardless of
whether the optic fiber was placed in the CeM, CeL, or CeC subdi-
visions(F(2,5)�0.373,p�0.706).Incontrast,laserproducednoFos
plumes in control inactive virus rats (p � 1.0, 95% CI � �0.08 to
0.07).
It seems noteworthy that the average Fos plume produced by
CeA ChR2 laser stimulation was ��2% of the volume of average
CeA virus infection (Fig. 4). Further, each 0.02 mm 3 Fos plume
corresponded to only �1% of the entire anatomical volume
of CeA. This observation suggests that optogenetic illumination
of ChR2 directly modulates Fos expression of neurons within a
tiny fraction of CeA and a much smaller anatomical zone than the
total range of virus infection, but is still sufficient to induce pow-
erful behavioral effects; this was true whether sites were in CeL or
CeM. Further suggesting that the small Fos plumes were more
important than total virus infection, the size of larger volumes of
virus infection did not correlate with degree of laser � cocaine
preference (Spearman’s �, rs � 0.018, p � 0.969).
Laser illumination of fibers in BLA ChR2 rats produced
similarly small 0.03 mm 3 Fos plume of elevated expression
surrounding the fiber-optic tips compared with control levels
measured in inactive virus rats (.16 mm radius; F(1,8) � 22.9, p �
0.000, 95% CI � 0.2 to 0.6) and compared with BLA tissue from
normal unoperated rats (0.25 mm radius; F(1,7) � 9.31, p � 0.003,
95% CI � 0.8 to 1.27). Similar to CeA ChR2 plumes, BLA ChR2
Fos plumes also contained a smaller 0.01 mm 3 center of intense
�300% Fos elevation (26.5 � 8.6 Fos� neurons) over Fos levels
in control rats with inactive virus (6.5 � 3.5 Fos� neurons) (Fig. 5).
Halorhodopsin in CeA, when illuminated by yellow laser,
suppressed Fos expression by at least 25% below control levels,
creating 0.016 mm 3 inhibitory plumes with �0.25 mm radius
(which we call anti-plumes). These Fos levels were only �0.75 of
control levels (i.e., �25% suppression) compared with baselines
of either inactive virus control rats that also received yellow laser
in CeA (F(2,9) � 60.9, p � 0.000, 95% CI � 0.21 to 0.13) or of
normal unoperated rats that received no laser (0.14 mm radius;
F(2,8) � 22.9, p � 0.001, 95% CI � 0.21 to 0.1). Halorhodopsin
anti-plumes also contained smaller 0.003 mm 3 centers of even
more intense suppression to levels between 0.1 to 0.5 of inactive
virus baseline levels (i.e., �50% suppression to �90% suppres-
sion) and these centers had nearly a 0.1 mm radius (1 � 0.39
Fos� neurons) compared with normal unoperated tissue (11 � 1
Fos� neurons; Fig. 4). Therefore, halorhodopsin illumination by
yellow laser produced the opposite neurobiological effects on
local neuronal Fos expression than ChR2 illumination by blue
laser in CeA. The opposite effects of illuminating halorhodopsin
versus ChR2 confirm that these manipulations have the opposite
neurobiological effects on neuronal Fos expression in CeA, even
though Fos changes do not always correspond to electrical depo-
larization versus hyperpolarization. The comparable sizes of
ChR2 Fos plumes versus halorhodopsin Fos anti-plumes further
8336 • J. Neurosci., August 30, 2017 • 37(35):8330–8348
Warlow et al. • Central Amygdala Stimulation Focuses Cocaine Motivation
 indicate that both manipulations primar-
ily affect neurons within a 0.1 mm (cen-
ter) to 0.3 mm (outer plume) radius of the
fiber-optic tip even if virus expression or
light extends further from the tip. That
relatively small radius suggests that in-
fected neurons may have a threshold of
illumination required to alter Fos expres-
sion, which is met only by neurons lying
within that radius with these laser
parameters.
Nose-poke duration and
consummatory responses to porthole
Beyond making CeA ChR2 rats choose la-
ser � cocaine far more often than cocaine
alone, laser pairing in CeA ChR2 rats also
tripled the duration of each nose poke that
they made into that laser � cocaine port-
hole (3 s) compared with poke duration
in the alternative cocaine alone porthole
(1 s) (t(8) � 4.92, p � 0.001, 95% CI �
0.88 to 2.44; d � 2.374). By comparison,
inactive virus control rats made pokes of
merely 1 s durations in both their laser �
cocaine and alternative portholes (t(11) �
2.91, p � 0.014, 95% CI � �2.9 to �0.4;
d � 3.5). This ChR2 duration extension of
the consummatory nose poke for laser �
cocaine was found in both bilateral and
unilateral CeA ChR2 rats (p � 0.396, 95%
CI � �0.47 to 1.72). The prolongation of
nose-poke duration appeared related to
the induction of oral consummatory be-
haviors emitted during the nose poke to-
ward their metal laser-paired porthole.
Specifically, laser pairing made CeA
ChR2 rats display novel active consum-
matory reactions of nibbling and biting of
the metal rim of their laser-paired port-
hole, in addition to perseverative sniffs
that most rats commonly display toward
Pavlovian cocaine cues (Movie 2). During
nibbles, a rat’s upper teeth at least con-
tacted the metal rim for a brief moment
(�0.5 s), sometimes repeatedly within
1–2 s. In bites, a CeA ChR2 rat’s upper and
lower incisors closed completely on the
outer rim of its laser � cocaine porthole,
remaining closed for up to 1 s. A bite often
was accompanied by a strong pulling mo-
tion of the head and neck away from the
wall, which sometimes actually succeeded

ChR2 rats nibbled and/or bit their laser �
cocaine retractable porthole compared
with 0% of inactive virus control rats and
0% of BLA ChR2 rats (Fig. 6A). Nibbles
and bites were specifically directed to the
laser � cocaine porthole because CeA
ChR2 rats were never observed to nibble
or bite their cocaine alone porthole, even
when they made nose pokes into it. Bites
and nibbles toward the laser-paired port-

received unilateral laser illumination (n �

Warlow et al. • Central Amygdala Stimulation Focuses Cocaine Motivation
 Actual intoxication with cocaine emerged as a further facilitating
or necessary factor for CeA ChR2 consummatory bites and nib-
bles of the laser-paired retractable porthole: For example, bites
and nibbles often did not emerge until the second half of a 60 min
session for CeA ChR2 rats, after the rat had already consumed
�1.5–3.3 mg/kg cocaine (bites during first half vs second half of
session: t(4) � 3.68, p � 0.02, 95% CI � �16.1 to �2.3; d �
�3.5). Some rats that had previously bitten their porthole late in
a session subsequently emitted a few bites in the first half of a
session on following days, but still tended to emit most bites later
in the session (bites during first half vs second half of session:
t(4) � 3.8, p � 0.02, 95% CI � �13.4 to �2.2; d � �3.8).
Finally, it also appeared necessary that the porthole actively
moved in and out of the chamber because only moving or retract-
able portholes elicited bites and nibbles from CeA ChR2 rats
when paired with laser (n � 5), not fixed or immovable nose
ports that remained constantly in the chamber (n � 10) (bites:
F(1,9) � 6.5, p � 0.04; nibbles: F(1,9) � 9.0, p � 0.02). Fixed
portholes failed to elicit consummatory bites even when paired
with bilateral laser stimulation in CeA ChR2 rats (n � 1). Pavlov-
ian cue features are known to be important as unconditioned
reward features in determining a conditioned response; for ex-
ample, when a rat responds to another rat that predicts food with
prosocial behaviors (Timberlake and Grant, 1975), but to a roll-
ing ball bearing that predicts food with predatory pounces (Tim-
berlake et al., 1982). Therefore, the sudden appearing and
disappearing features of the moving porthole, its cocaine reinforce-
ment and its associative pairing with CeA ChR2 laser stimulation all
likely combined together to produce the consummatory bites emit-
tedtowardthemetalobject.Still,aretractableporthole only elicited
bites here when it had laser � cocaine status and the same CeA
ChR2 rats never bit their retractable cocaine alone porthole. Fi-
nally, inactive control virus rats and BLA ChR2 rats never dis-
played bite or nibble consummatory responses, not even to a
retractable cocaine porthole paired with laser (F(2,7) � 32.2, p �
0.000; Fig. 6B,C).
Nibble or bite consummatory responses toward a metal co-
caine cue by rats have never been reported before to our knowl-
edge. Instead, rats are reported typically to emit approach and
sniff responses toward a Pavlovian light, location, or object CS for
cocaine in autoshaping or sign-tracking studies, but not to bite or
nibble the CS object with mouth or teeth (Kearns and Weiss,
2004; Uslaner et al., 2006). Instead, only food-associated CSs are
known to evoke nibbles and bites as consummatory responses
(Tomie et al., 1989; Mahler and Berridge, 2009; DiFeliceantonio
and Berridge, 2012). We note that CeA ChR2 stimulation simi-
larly increased consummatory bites and nibbles of a sucrose-
associated metal lever paired with laser in our earlier study
(Robinson et al., 2014). Bites and nibbles of the cocaine laser-
paired cue here might reflect ingestive incentive motivation or,
conceivably, a different CeA ChR2-induced motivation such as
predation or aggression or some unspecified incentive attractive-
ness that made the metal porthole more able to elicit the urge to
bite, nibble, and orally grasp.
In contrast, control and BLA rats always merely sniffed their
portholes, the more typical consummatory response to a cocaine
cue (Kearns and Weiss, 2004; Uslaner et al., 2006). CeA ChR2 rats
also emitted consummatory sniffs toward their portholes (both
fixed and retractable ports) in addition to nibbles and bites and,
in fact, emitted twice as many sniffs to their laser � cocaine
porthole as control inactive virus rats did toward either porthole
(mean � SEM: 5 � 1 vs 2 � 0.8 sniffs; t(11) � 3.22, p � 0.008, 95%
CI � 0.85 to 4.5; d � 1.82). CeA ChR2 rats also emitted �6 times
more sniffs to their laser � cocaine porthole than to their cocaine
alone porthole (t(8) � 6.83, p � 0.000, 95% CI � 1.5 to 3; d �
1.45). Even among rats with retractable portholes, sniffs were �2
times greater to their laser � cocaine porthole than to their
cocaine-alone porthole (t(3) � 3.3, p � 0.04, 95% CI � 1.0 to 4.1;
d � 2.36; Fig. 6D). Therefore, CeA ChR2 pairing potentiated
sniffing in addition to creating novel bites and nibbles as consum-
matory response and enhanced responses were always directed
specifically toward the laser � cocaine porthole.
CeA ChR2 perseveration during 20 s timeout after cocaine
As soon as a cocaine infusion actually began, control and BLA rats
typically stopped making frequent nose pokes into the porthole
that they had chosen (randomly overall; F(1,5) � 2.3, p � 0.19),
but CeA ChR2 rats perseverated with longer pokes into their laser �
cocaine porthole that continued during an infusion and even
afterward during the 20 s timeout, when no further cocaine could
be earned (F(1,13) � 8.9, p � 0.01). For example, CeA ChR2 rats in
this sense wasted 50% more instrumental nose pokes than in-
active virus control rats, making pokes that could earn nothing
during timeouts on the final 4 d of training (57% vs 38% of total
nose pokes in each session were made during the 20 s timeout;
F(2,15) � 4.36, p � 0.03). CeA ChR2 perseveration after infusion
was shown by both bilateral and unilateral CeA ChR2 rats (F(1,13) �
0.29, p � 0.6).

 suppressing Fos to 10–50% normal levels
within a 0.25 mm anti-plume radius, did
not alter preference and simply chose
equally between the two cocaine options
when given a choice (F(1,6) � 0.27, p �
0.62; Fig. 7A). However, overall cocaine
consumption appeared marginally re-
duced for CeA halorhodopsin rats, a sup-
pression that became significant if we
raised the criterion for control rats from 5
infusions per day for 3 d to 6 infusions per
day for 3 d (eliminating one low outlier
frominactiveviruscontrolratsandleavinga
control n � 2; F(1,7) � 10.5, p � 0.01), but
not if we dropped all inclusion criteria
(F(1,8) � 1.7, p � 0.23). Applying the
stricter inclusion criterion, halorhodop-
sin rats took only approximately half as
much cocaine as control rats on day 1,
(t(7) � 4.3, p � 0.003, 95% CI � �21 to
�6; d � �3.02) and were still taking less
on day 5 (t(7) � 3.5, p � 0.01, 95% CI �
�39 to �7.5; d � �3.7). However, turn-
ing the yellow laser on for the entire 60
min session on day 11 did not further
alter that pattern or induce any further
suppression of intake (t(7) � 1.3, p � 0.23, 95% CI �39 to 11).
CeA inhibition by GABAergic microinjections
In contrast, rats that received pharmacological inhibition of CeA
via bilateral microinjections of a muscimol/baclofen mixture
from day 1 of training nearly completely failed to self-administer
cocaine once they were connected to head-cap cables on the third
day (cables were needed for laser optic fiber connections in op-
togenetic studies and so were added here to keep conditions sim-
ilar even though no laser was given to the microinjection-only
group). On the first 2 d of training, CeA muscimol/baclofen rats
were not connected to head cables and did self-administer co-
caine. On the first day, muscimol/baclofen rats had lower cocaine
self-administration levels than vehicle control rats, though this
was not significant (t(6) � 2.4, p � 0.05). However, on the second
no-cable day, consumption levels did not differ statistically
(t(6) � 0.14, p � 0.89). A closer look at individuals revealed that 2
of 6 CeA muscimol/baclofen rats began to robustly self-
administer 3–5 daily infusions on the first day, which rose to 7–11
on the second day, whereas 3 other CeA muscimol/baclofen rats
remained at 0–1 infusions on both days (control vehicle rats all
consumed 5–15 infusions on both days). However, beginning on
day 3, once head caps were connected to fiber-optic cables for all
rats, CeA muscimol/baclofen microinjections apparently com-
bined with the additional challenge of mild head tension from
head cables nearly completely prevented any cocaine self-admin-
istration: 0 or 1 infusion for all CeA muscimol/baclofen rats
versus, on average, 12 infusions for control CeA vehicle micro-
injection rats. CeA muscimol/baclofen rats all remained at 0 or 1
daily infusion from days 3–10, whereas control rats rose gradually
to �20 infusions by day 10 (day � group interaction: F(7,42) �
2.5, p � 0.03; Fig. 7B). We note that CeA muscimol/baclofen
microinjections may induce some degree of general motor sup-
pression (Mahler and Berridge, 2009), which could have contrib-
uted to disrupting cocaine self-administration here. However,
clearly, motor suppression was not so great as to by itself disrupt
self-administration given that no disruption of self-admini-
stration was seen after muscimol/baclofen microinjections on
days 1 and 2, but only emerged when head caps were first
connected to fiber-optic tethers on day 3. At that point, CeA
muscimol/baclofen suppression of motor, sensory, motiva-
tional, and/or associative functions apparently only then became
sufficient to disrupt the more challenging task demands pre-
sented by having to make nose pokes while head tethered in to
self-administer cocaine.
The relatively severe disruption of cocaine self-admini-
stration by CeA muscimol/baclofen microinjections (when
combined with head cables) versus the much milder effects of
CeA halorhodopsin illumination might reflect less neuronal in-
hibition by halorhodopsin than by muscimol/baclofen microin-
jections. This would be consistent with Fos plume data, because
halorhodopsin here induced anti-plumes in which the zone of
suppression to 50% of normal Fos levels extended �0.25 mm in
radius from fiber-optic tip. By comparison, CeA muscimol mi-
croinjections have produced larger anti-plumes in which the
zone of 50% Fos suppression extended 0.75 mm from microin-
jector tip (Mahler and Berridge, 2009). A 3-fold difference in
radius would correspond to a �25-fold difference in volumes of
CeA tissue inhibited by halorhodopsin illumination versus musci-
mol microinjection (0.06–1.76 mm 3; assuming approximately
spherical shapes). Also supporting the possibility that halorho-
dopsin causes only mild neurobiological inhibitions, electro-
physiological studies have reported that, in infralimbic cortex,
70% of affected neurons were inhibited, but 30% of neurons were
oppositely excited, by halorhodopsin (Smith et al., 2012). Simi-
larly, in ventral pallidum, 80% of neurons were unaffected by
halorhodopsin, whereas in the affected 20% subgroup, two of
three neurons were inhibited and the remaining one neuron was
excited (Chang et al., 2017). If comparably weak electrophysio-
logical effects occurred in CeA, then this might also help to ex-
plain why the behavioral effects of CeA halorhodopsin were
relatively weak.

Warlow et al. • Central Amygdala Stimulation Focuses Cocaine Motivation
 CeA muscimol/baclofen inhibition prevents CeA ChR2
control of motivation
In a final CeA inhibition group, we tested whether muscimol/
baclofen CeA inhibition during training would block the ability
of simultaneous CeA ChR2 excitation to intensify cocaine moti-
vation and establish preference for the laser � cocaine option.
CeA inhibition/excitation rats received muscimol/baclofen mi-
croinjections before sessions on each of the first 4 d of training. In
each session, they received CeA ChR2 laser pairings with one
cocaine option, as in the CeA ChR2 groups above. Results showed
that CeA muscimol/baclofen microinjections completely pre-
vented CeA ChR2 laser pairing from generating any detectable
enhancement in motivation for cocaine or establishing any
detectable preference for the laser � cocaine option over the
cocaine-alone option (F(1,3) � 1.0, p � 0.39; Fig. 7C). Instead,
these rats made only 0–1 nose pokes per session, randomly dis-
tributed between the 2 options. On the fifth and sixth day, mus-
cimol/baclofen microinjections were omitted to assess whether
the suppression of self-administration was enduring or instead
was CeA state dependent. Without simultaneous CeA inhibition,
cocaine intake immediately jumped on the fifth day to �30 total
infusions and a 3:1 preference immediately emerged so that CeA
ChR2 rats now made �25 nose pokes for their laser � cocaine
option versus �6 nose pokes for cocaine alone (t(3) � 3.7, p � 0.03,

Progressive ratio: CeA ChR2
stimulation amplifies incentive
motivation breakpoint
Does CeA ChR2 stimulation actually in-
crease the intensity of incentive motiva-
tion for cocaine? We ran a progressive
ratio or breakpoint test to assess indepen-
dently whether laser would increase effort
rats were willing to exert to obtain cocaine
in a 2 d within-subject comparison. Rats
were presented with only one cocaine
option per day (order counterbalanced
across rats): either cocaine alone or laser �
cocaine. On each day, the available port-
hole earned their customary outcome,
either cocaine infusions plus 8 s laser illu-
minations and its auditory cue (laser �
cocaine) or only cocaine infusions plus its
distinctive auditory cue (cocaine alone).
However, the effort required to earn each
reward increased progressively after each
infusion during a session. Overall, CeA
ChR2 rats were willing to work �8 times
harder on their laser � cocaine day (break-
point � 75) than on their cocaine alone day

 CeA ChR2 laser by itself fails to support self-stimulation in
same rats
In three separate tests of laser self-stimulation, CeA ChR2 illumi-
nation by itself failed to reinforce responses even though laser had
previously potentiated cocaine pursuit in the same rats: an active
response task (object-touch self-administration), a passive re-
sponse task (place-based real-time self-stimulation), and an in-
strumental nose-poke response task (minus cocaine delivery).
In a spout-touch self-stimulation task requiring active re-
sponses, every touch on a designated metal spout (empty drink-
ing spout) with paw or mouth closed an electrical contact and
earned a brief pulse of laser stimulation (either 1 or 8 s duration
for different rats; 25 Hz, 8–10 mW, blue laser) (Kravitz et al.,
2012), whereas touching an alternative spout earned nothing.
Results showed that CeA ChR2 rats failed to touch the active
spout any more than the inactive spout (n � 12; F(1,10) � 0.013,
p � 0.91; Fig. 9A). No detectable self-stimulation behavior was
obtained at either 1 s pulse duration (n � 6; F(1,5) � 0.046, p �
0.84) or 8 s pulse durations (n � 6; F(1,5) � 0.075, p � 0.79). Rats
touched both spouts between 20 and 70 times per session for each
of 3 consecutive sessions (possibly attracted because spouts re-
sembled water drinking spouts in home cage), but with approx-
imately equal frequency (F(2,20) � 0.72, p � 0.5). On the first 2 d,
rats touched both spouts less frequently if earning 8 s duration
CeA pulses than 1 s pulses, possibly suggesting a slight general
deterrent effect of longer CeA pulses or general arousing effect of
shorter pulses (first day 65 touches 1 s vs 12 touches 8 s; t(2) � 3.2,
p � 0.01, 95% CI � 16.1 to 89.5; d � 2.35; second day t(10) � 2.5,
p � 0.03, 95% CI � �17.9 to 36.9; d � 0.45). However, even that
difference disappeared by the third day (t(10) � 0.87, p � 0.4).
In a second active-response task, spout touching was replaced
by nose poking as the instrumental response, similar to the in-
strumental response used for cocaine self-administration. This
was to test the alternative interpretation that nose pokes were
simply an easier response for rats to acquire and that a difference
in task ease explained why CeA laser controlled cocaine self-
administration, but not laser self-stimulation in the spout task.
Drug-naive CeA ChR2 rats that had never earned cocaine en-
countered two portholes (both were retractable or both were
fixed for different rats). Nose pokes into one arbitrarily desig-
nated porthole earned either 1 s bins (typical duration for self-
stimulation studies) or 8 s bins (similar to cocaine 2-choice bins)
(balanced across different rats) of CeA blue laser illumination (25
Hz, 8 mW), whereas a second porthole delivered nothing and was
counted simply as a control for general activity. Results showed
that CeA ChR2 rats failed to nose poke into their laser-delivering
porthole any more frequently than into the inactive porthole in
both 1 s laser bins (n � 6; t(5) � 1.23, p � 0.273, 95% CI � �21.6
to 16.1) and 8 s laser bins (n � 6; t(5) � 1.34, p � 0.24, 95% CI �
�11 to 34). Overall, nose pokes also did not differ between 1 and
8 s laser bins (F(1,5) � 1.18, p � 0.33), nor was there any interac-
tion between porthole preference and bin duration (F(1,5) � 1.1,
p � 0.35). Therefore, cocaine-naive CeA ChR2 rats failed to nose
poke to self-stimulate CeA laser, indicating that CeA excitation
by itself is not sufficient to serve as an independent reinforcer in
our two-porthole nose-poke task.

Warlow et al. • Central Amygdala Stimulation Focuses Cocaine Motivation
 In the passive response or location-based task, in which CeA
ChR2 stimulation could be earned even more easily by entering
or just remaining in a particular corner while making small
movements (Olds and Milner, 1954), CeA ChR2 rats failed to
show any self-stimulation or preference for their laser-delivering
corner over the other 3 corners (n � 7; F(3,9) � 0.19, p � 0.901; Fig.
9B). Equally, CeA ChR2 rats did not avoid their laser corner
regardless of whether laser illumination was earned in 1 s dura-
tion pulses (n � 4; F(3,9) � 2.3, p � 0.145) or in 8 s duration pulses
(n � 3; F(3,6) � 0.079, p � 0.97). Instead,ratsappearedobliviousto
the location of CeA ChR2 stimulation delivered by itself, instead
simply exploring the chamber at random. Lack of self-stimulation
suggests that CeA ChR2 laser does not add a prediction error or
reinforcement signal able to “stamp in” a preceding action.
CeA ChR2 laser fails to maintain responding after cocaine
is discontinued
In a final test of whether CeA ChR2 laser illumination by itself can
be sufficient at least to maintain instrumental nose-poke re-
sponding (if not to establish nose pokes), we examined the effect
of turning off cocaine infusions in CeA ChR2 rats that had al-
ready acquired nose-poke responding for the combination of
laser � cocaine. In other words, could
CeA ChR2 laser by itself at least maintain
nose pokes in rats that were already re-
sponding at a high level for cocaine ac-
companied by CeA laser? After 2 d of
refresher training on the original 2-choice
task for laser � cocaine and cocaine alone
(FR1 schedule), cocaine was suddenly dis-
continued for the next 4 d but the laser
could still be earned by itself (n � 7). That
is, the customary porthole still delivered
laser as before and both portholes deliv-
ered their associated auditory cues, but
neither delivered cocaine (laser alone vs
nothing). Finally, after 4 d of laser alone,
the laser was also discontinued for the
next 3 d to examine whether its removal
dropped responding further (nothing vs
nothing; n � 7 rats). Results showed that,
by the second day of laser alone, CeA
ChR2 rats lost their preference for the for-
mer laser � cocaine option that now de-
livered laser alone and chose equally at
low levels between that and nothing (t(6)
� 1.01; p � 0.35, 95% CI � �6.6 to 15.7;
Fig. 10). CeA ChR2 rats failed to self-
stimulate on their laser alone porthole,
even though they had previously re-
sponded vigorously when it also earned
cocaine (F(4,24) � 10.22, p � 0.000). Both
unilateral laser and bilateral laser rats
showed similar declines when only laser
by itself was available (n � 3 unilateral
and n � 4 bilateral; F(1,5) � 0.012, p �
0.92). Finally, when CeA laser was addi-
tionally discontinued several days later,
there was no further drop from laser alone
to nothing (5 � 2 vs 4 � 2 responses on
days 5 and 8, respectively; t(6) � 0.36; p �
0.73, 95% CI � �3.3 to 4.4). Therefore,
without cocaine, CeA ChR2 laser failed to
maintain any detectable preference or instrumental responding
above complete extinction levels. Instead, CeA laser appeared
entirely worthless to the same rats in which it had established
intense and narrowly focused motivation for cocaine.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that pairing CeA ChR2 stimulation with
a particular option to earn intravenous cocaine narrowly focused
amplified motivation solely to its paired cocaine option at the
expense of nearly ignoring the alternative cocaine option and
intensified the level of incentive motivation to obtain cocaine,
resulting in greater cocaine consumption. In independent pro-
gressive ratio tests of intensity of incentive motivation, CeA ChR2
stimulation further amplified the breakpoint effort price that rats
were willing to pay for cocaine by more than eight times. This
pattern closely resembles the CeA ChR2 amplification and nar-
rowing of sucrose motivation that we reported previously (Rob-
inson et al., 2014). Conversely, CeA inhibition by optogenetic
halorhodopsin here mildly impaired cocaine consumption and
stronger GABAergic inhibition by muscimol/baclofen microin-
jections nearly abolished self-administration by tethered rats
and prevented CeA ChR2 enhancement or focusing of moti-

 vation. These results indicate that CeA-related circuitry can
powerfully control the amplitude and targeting of motivation
for cocaine.
CeA ChR2 pairing also generated intense consummatory bite
and nibble reactions directed specifically toward the metal laser �
cocaine porthole, in addition to increasing consummatory sniff-
ing of that laser-associated cocaine cue (a more typical condi-
tioned response to cocaine cues). Bites and nibbles are common
rat consummatory behaviors elicited by cues for sucrose or food
rewards, but to our knowledge have not been reported for co-
caine cues. Here, bites and nibbles were never emitted by control
rats earning cocaine nor by BLA ChR2 rats or even by CeA ChR2
rats toward their cocaine alone porthole. Consummatory bites
emerged only when several conditions were met simultaneously:
(1) CeA ChR2 laser was paired with the target cocaine porthole;
(2) the metal porthole actively moved, appearing abruptly into
the chamber and retracting back out after cocaine was earned;
and (3) cocaine was actually earned by that option. Further, a
fourth condition of cocaine intoxication dramatically facilitated
oral consummatory behaviors: bites, nibbles, and sniffs all be-
came most intense near the end of a session, when CeA ChR2 rats
had already consumed a substantial dose of cocaine. Consumma-
tory responses are a signature feature of incentive salience when
attributed toward a Pavlovian reward cue to the extent that indi-
viduals sometimes try to consume a ‘wanted’ cue as though it
were the reward (Mahler and Berridge, 2009). Here, we hypoth-
esize that CeA ChR2 pairing with cocaine amplified the incentive
salience of its associated cue, adding a new motivation status that
made it more attractively biteable.
Amplified cocaine value, not transferred laser value
Despite powerfully intensifying and narrowing motivation to
take cocaine and making its cue more attractive, CeA ChR2 stim-
ulation apparently lacked any reinforcement value on its own
without cocaine. Even the same rats that had pursued only their
laser � cocaine option completely failed to show laser prefer-
ences when given opportunities to earn self-stimulation with CeA
ChR2 laser alone. CeA ChR2 rats neither touched a spout nor
made nose pokes in a porthole to earn laser and did not even
remain or return to a location where laser was delivered. Further,
CeA ChR2 laser by itself also failed to maintain instrumental
nose-poke responding that had been previously established in-
tensely by pairing that laser with cocaine. Therefore, by itself, CeA
ChR2 laser appeared worthless to these rats. Although CeA ChR2
self-stimulation might be found in future using different situations,
it seems clear that CeA ChR2 laser was not a potent reinforcer with
our parameters.
Lack of independent reinforcement by laser rules out the pos-
sibility that CeA ChR2 stimulation acted as a prediction error
teaching signal to create a learned expectation of greater reward,
that the laser acted to strengthen stimulus–response habit asso-
ciations, or that laser was ever sought by our rats as an indepen-
dent hedonic reward. We conclude that CeA ChR2 enhancement
of cocaine motivation cannot be explained by mere transfer of
any additive laser reinforcement/reward signal to its paired co-
caine. Instead, CeA ChR2 enhancement of cocaine motivation
was greater than the sum of its two separate parts, namely laser
stimulation value and cocaine value, assessed separately. We sug-
gest that CeA ChR2 laser specifically transforms the motivational
value of earning its paired sensory reward and enhances incentive
salience of its cocaine cue. This CeA ChR2 value transformation
seems unable to act in vacuo on any relatively neutral stimulus
(spout, porthole, location), but rather requires some motivation-
ally salient sensation on which to act, such as a cocaine reward or
sucrose reward.
Localization of function in CeA for enhanced motivation
Effective sites for amplifying motivation for paired cocaine were
nearly all clustered within CeA or slightly above, so downward-
projecting light would penetrate CeA. In contrast, nearly all BLA
ChR2 sites were ineffective.
Laser-induced Fos plumes were much smaller (0.1–0.3 mm
radius) than GFP virus infection zones (�1 mm radius). That
difference suggests ChR2-infected CeA neurons may need to be
within 0.3 mm of an 8–10 mW optic fiber tip to receive sufficient
light to alter neuronal function, induce Fos translation, and pre-
sumably increase firing. Based on this assumption to aid localiza-
tion of function, effective sites were evenly spread in most CeA
subdivisions, including both the CeM and CeL, as well as the CeC.
It has been suggested that CeL mediates appetitive motivation for
reward (Cai et al., 2014) and reduces anxiety (Tye et al., 2011),
whereas CeM mediates fearful or defensive behaviors (Hauben-
sak et al., 2010; Namburi et al., 2015). However, our results imply
that neurons in CeM and CeL likely contributed to CeA ChR2
enhancement of cocaine motivation here. As a caveat, though, we
acknowledge that many of our CeM Fos plumes may also have
partly penetrated into CeL, and thus not have been fully con-
tained in CeM. Future work could examine anatomical subdivi-
sions or neuronal subpopulation roles more specifically either by
creating smaller Fos plumes or by probing neurochemical sub-
populations within CeM and CeL (Wolff et al., 2014; Gafford and
Ressler, 2015).
Although BLA has been implicated in both reward-related and
fearful behaviors, often by lesion or related loss-of-function stud-
ies (Kochli et al., 2015; McGaugh, 2015; Wassum and Izquierdo,
2015), BLA was not effective for ChR2 enhancement of cocaine
motivation here. That CeA versus BLA difference replicates the
pattern that we reported previously for CeA ChR2 amplification
of motivation to earn sucrose, indicating similar anatomical
specificity for optogenetic control of a natural sensory reward
and a drug reward (Robinson et al., 2014). CeA is also typically
more effective than BLA for pharmacological microinjection en-
hancements of incentive motivation (Corbit and Balleine, 2005;
Mahler and Berridge, 2009; DiFeliceantonio and Berridge, 2012;
Holland and Hsu, 2014). CeA is also important in incubation of
cue-triggered drug craving (Lu et al., 2005; Shaham and Hope,
2005; Lu et al., 2007; Funk et al., 2016). A CeA advantage for
generating intense incentive motivation may be related to CeA’s
macrosystem status as a “striatal-level structure” (e.g., containing
mostly GABAergic neurons), similar to several other striatal
structures where stimulations also may generate intense motiva-
tion for rewards (e.g., nucleus accumbens; some regions of neos-
triatum). In contrast, BLA has the status of a “cortical-level
structure” (e.g., mostly glutamatergic neurons, which project in
turn to CeA) in the same macrosystem framework (Alheid and
Heimer, 1988; Swanson and Petrovich, 1998; Swanson, 2003;
Zahm, 2006; Heimer, 2008).
Regarding larger mesocorticolimbic circuitry, CeA is known
to modulate mesolimbic dopamine systems in tegmentum and
nucleus accumbens activity (Ahn and Phillips, 2002) via outputs
to intermediary ventral pallidum, lateral hypothalamus, ventral
tegmentum, and other targets (Yoshida et al., 2006; Heimer,
2008; Janak and Tye, 2015; Reppucci and Petrovich, 2016). CeA
ChR2 recruitment of VTA, mesolimbic dopamine projections,
and related limbic circuitry may well be part of the mechanism
that enhanced incentive motivation here.

Warlow et al. • Central Amygdala Stimulation Focuses Cocaine Motivation
 Potential roles of CeA circuitry in addiction
In addiction, intense motivation may become narrowly focused
on a particular reward, such as taking drugs, at the expense of
neglecting other life rewards. A challenge for addiction neurosci-
ence has been to understand how brain circuitry carries out the
narrow focusing of desire combined with amplification of moti-
vation intensity. Our results confirm that optogenetic activation
of CeA-related circuitry, paired with one particular reward op-
tion, produces narrowly focused yet intense motivation and ex-
tends this phenomenon to intravenous cocaine reward. Our
results also demonstrate a potentially “irrational” feature of this
CeA-generated intense motivation that might be shared with ad-
diction, in that motivation enhancement was far greater than the
sum of its constituent reinforcer elements (i.e., cocaine alone plus
