n December 2017, the Boston radio station WBUR 
chronicled the case of the first patient at Massa-
chusetts General Hospital to receive axicabtagene 
ciloleucel (Yescarta, Gilead) outside a clinical trial. 
The chimeric antigen receptor 
T cells (CAR-Ts) were made from 
71-year-old Barbara Kearney’s own 
T cells, which after genetic modi-
fication ex vivo were turned on to 
target the CD19 receptor. CD19 is 
a commonly expressed surface an-
tigen on B cells, including those 
of Ms. Kearney’s non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma, and also inhabits the 
surface of some other normal 
cells.1
In a trial involving 101 patients 
with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, 
axicabtagene ciloleucel produced 
complete remission in 51, which 
led to its approval by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA). 
Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah, Novar-
tis), another anti-CD19 CAR-T 
therapy, led to complete responses 
in 22 of 69 patients (32%). Juno 
Therapeutics also has a develop-
ment program for anti–CD19 
CAR-T therapies. (I have been in-
volved in various ways with all 
three manufacturers.)
The two approved CAR-T thera-
pies have boxed warnings regard-
ing serious side effects, and each 
costs about $400,000. Ancillary 
costs include initial leukaphere-
sis and inpatient stays that may 
be necessitated by frequent treat-
ment complications, which may 
result in administration of tociliz-
umab (up to four doses at $2,500 
per dose). Hernandez and col-
leagues estimate that these ancil-
lary costs would average around 
$33,000 per patient; media reports 
suggest a figure 10 times as high.2
The small number of studied 
patients and the high price of the 
treatment and ancillary costs led 
United Healthcare, a provider of 
Medicare Advantage plans, to re-
quest that the Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
perform a national coverage analy-
sis (NCA) of CAR-T therapy.3 
United argued that implementing 
a single coverage policy for CAR-T 
therapy across Medicare would 
level the financial playing field 
for competing plans and ensure 
equal access. NCAs do usually 
result in uniform coverage across 
Medicare; without them, coverage 
often varies among regions and 
plans.
Under the 1965 law that creat-
ed Medicare, the program must 
cover services that are “reason-
able and necessary” for the treat-
ment of illness. CMS interprets 
this phrase as requiring coverage 
of services that provide a net bene-
fit. The agency does not consider

a therapy’s price, and the part of 
CMS that determines coverage is 
separate from the part that de-
termines payment rates. Yet in 
recent years, as the costs of treat-
ments have increased, CMS has 
adopted an approach to coverage 
determinations that takes a strict-
er view of the evidence.4
The agency may find the trial 
data sufficient to conclude that 
CAR-T therapy provides a net ben-
efit for Medicare patients. But 
such a conclusion would be based 
on observations from only a hand-
ful of patients 65 years of age or 
older (and thus age-eligible for 
Medicare). If CMS reaches this 
conclusion, it need not simply 
say yes to coverage. It could limit 
which providers and hospitals 
are eligible to administer CAR-T, 
as it does for some organ trans-
plantation, for instance, or it could 
use the Coverage with Evidence 
Development (CED) designation, 
which can either include a re-
quirement that further outcome 
data be collected in a registry or 
limit coverage to patients en-
rolled in clinical trials. In either 
case, CED aims to buttress the 
evidence relevant to the “reason-
able and necessary” question.
In tandem, the Center for Medi-
care and Medicaid Innovation at 
CMS could design a payment ap-
proach for CAR-T therapy that 
promotes competition based on 
price — an improvement over the 
current system, which includes 
such therapy in Part B drug reim-
bursement and provides doctors 
and hospitals with larger profits 
when the treatment costs more.
To decide among this array of 
options, CMS will have to deter-
mine whether it has adequate 
confidence on two points regard-
ing the various CAR-T therapies: 
whether their net benefits are 
similar and whether the ancillary 
services have similar costs. The 
table outlines alternative approach-
es to coverage for CAR-T thera-
pies based on the answers to 
these questions with reference to 
the overlapping indication for the 
two approved agents — recurrent 
or refractory B-cell lymphoma. 
This indication is more prevalent 
than the additional indication for 
tisagenlecleucel — pediatric and 
young adult acute lymphocytic 
leukemia.
If CMS is adequately confident 
that the net benefit is similar, it 
could promote price competition, 
but how this could be done 
would depend on the ancillary 
health care costs associated with 
use of the treatments. Conclud-
ing that the ancillary costs are 
likely to be similar would let the 
agency focus solely on price com-
petition between the CAR-T ther-
apies; if it lacks confidence on 
that question, CMS could promote 
price competition in a manner 
that incorporates both the cost 
of the CAR-T therapy and the an-
cillary costs.
But CMS may also lack confi-
dence that the various therapies 
have similar net benefits, in which 
case it could limit coverage to pa-
tients enrolled in a clinical trial. 
A randomized trial comparing the 
CAR-T therapies, and involving 
3450 patients, would have power 
to confirm similar benefit with a 
±5% margin if the response rate 
were 50%. About 7500 patients 
per year would be expected to 
have the relevant condition, and 
the majority of them would be 
Medicare-eligible.3 It would make 
sense to examine quality of life, 
resulting financial difficulties for 
patients, and variation in efficacy 
across patient subgroups as out-
comes in such a study, and data 
on ancillary costs should also be 
gathered if CMS cannot conclude 
that the costs are similar for dif-
ferent therapies.
CMS can drive price competi-
tion on CAR-T therapy alone by 
soliciting bids from the compet-
ing manufacturers. The agency has 
engaged directly in such compet-
itive bidding for durable medical 
equipment and has engaged a pri-

vate contractor to do so for Part B 
drugs under the Competitive Ac-
quisition Program (CAP). CAP was 
recently highlighted in President 
Donald Trump’s “blueprint to low-
er drug prices.” Or CMS could con-
solidate billing for comparable 
CAR-T therapies into a single code, 
which would lead to price compe-
tition among manufacturers, since 
reimbursement to doctors and 
hospitals is based on a weighted 
average of sales of all drugs incor-
porated into the billing code. Thus, 
the lowest-priced CAR-T therapy 
at a given time would provide a 
larger profit to the prescriber, 
and manufacturers would strive 
to undercut one another. Deploy-
ing consolidated billing codes to 
drive price competition is a strat-
egy that was recently highlighted 
by the Medicare Payment Advi-
sory Commission (MEDPAC).5
Ancillary costs can be incor-
porated under case-rate (bundled) 
lump-sum payment, which forces 
the physician or hospital to take 
financial responsibility for the to-
tal cost of using the therapy, in-
cluding management of its com-
plications. The provider’s profits 
increase if the total cost of care 
is less than the lump-sum amount, 
which creates an incentive to se-
lect the therapy associated with 
lower total costs. These choices, 
in turn, drive manufacturers to 
lower their prices. Gain sharing 
is similar to case-rate payment 
but is implemented after the fact, 
and typically only a fraction of the 
savings is returned when costs 
fall below a benchmark. Then 
again, only a fraction, or some-
times none, of the losses are 
borne by the provider when the 
reverse occurs.
CAR-T therapies have broken 
new ground on many fronts — 
they have shown efficacy in pa-
tients who previously had few 
options, but they cost multiple 
times what any previously ap-
proved cancer therapy costs. Their 
rapid approval based on small, un-
controlled studies reflects their 
promise. But they are no panacea. 
Ms. Kearney died a few weeks 
after receiving her dose of the 
CAR-T therapy that cost nearly 
$400,000, and she endured an 
extended hospital and ICU stay 
along the way. She told WBUR 
reporter Richard Knox that she 
knew death was a possible out-
come, and she was grateful for 
the chance to receive a possibly 
effective treatment — a reminder 
of what’s at stake for Medicare 
patients when CMS considers 
CAR-T therapy coverage. If Medi-
care chooses to cover this ther-
apy, it should think carefully 
about how to do it.
