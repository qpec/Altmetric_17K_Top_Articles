The proliferation and activation of microglial cells is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative conditions. This mechanism is
regulated by the activation of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), thus providing a target that may prevent the
progression of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. However, the study of microglial proliferation in Alzheimer’s disease and
validation of the efficacy of CSF1R-inhibiting strategies have not yet been reported. In this study we found increased proliferation
of microglial cells in human Alzheimer’s disease, in line with an increased upregulation of the CSF1R-dependent pro-mitogenic
cascade, correlating with disease severity. Using a transgenic model of Alzheimer’s-like pathology (APPswe, PSEN1dE9; APP/PS1
mice) we define a CSF1R-dependent progressive increase in microglial proliferation, in the proximity of amyloid-b plaques.
Prolonged inhibition of CSF1R in APP/PS1 mice by an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor (GW2580) resulted in the blockade
of microglial proliferation and the shifting of the microglial inflammatory profile to an anti-inflammatory phenotype.
Pharmacological targeting of CSF1R in APP/PS1 mice resulted in an improved performance in memory and behavioural tasks
and a prevention of synaptic degeneration, although these changes were not correlated with a change in the number of amyloid-b
plaques. Our results provide the first proof of the efficacy of CSF1R inhibition in models of Alzheimer’s disease, and validate the
application of a therapeutic strategy aimed at modifying CSF1R activation as a promising approach to tackle microglial activation
and the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.

 Introduction
The neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease shows a robust
innate immune response characterized by the presence of
activated microglia, with increased or de novo expression
of diverse macrophage antigens (Akiyama et al., 2000;
Edison et al., 2008), and production of inflammatory cyto-
kines (Dickson et al., 1993; Fernandez-Botran et al., 2011).
Evidence indicates that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) protect from the onset or progression of
Alzheimer’s disease (Hoozemans et al., 2011), suggestive of
the idea that inflammation is a causal component of the
disease rather than simply a consequence of the neurode-
generation. In fact, inflammation (Holmes et al., 2009),
together with tangle pathology (Nelson et al., 2012) or
neurodegeneration-related biomarkers (Wirth et al., 2013)
correlate better with cognitive decline than amyloid-b accu-
mulation, but the underlying mechanisms of the sequence
of events that contribute to the clinical symptoms are
poorly understood. The contribution of inflammation to
disease pathogenesis is supported by recent genome-wide
association
studies,
highlighting
immune-related
genes
such as CR1 (Jun et al., 2010), TREM2 (Guerreiro et al.,
2013; Jonsson et al., 2013) or HLA-DRB5–HLA-DRB1 in
association with Alzheimer’s disease (European Alzheimer’s
Disease et al., 2013). Additionally, a growing body of evi-
dence suggests that systemic inflammation may interact
with the innate immune response in the brain to act as a
‘driver’ of disease progression and exacerbate symptoms
(Holmes et al., 2009, 2011).
Microglial cells are the master regulators of the neuroin-
flammatory response associated with brain disease (Gomez-
Nicola and Perry, 2014a, b). Activated microglia have been
demonstrated in transgenic models of Alzheimer’s disease
(LaFerla and Oddo, 2005; Jucker, 2010) and have been
recently shown to dominate the gene expression landscape
of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (Zhang et al., 2013).
Recently, microglial activation through the transcription
factor PU.1 has been reported to be capital for the progres-
sion of Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting the role of micro-
glia in the disease-initiating steps (Gjoneska et al., 2015).
Results from our group, using a murine model of chronic
neurodegeneration (prion disease), show large numbers of
microglia with an activated phenotype (Perry et al., 2010)
and a cytokine profile similar to that of Alzheimer’s disease
(Cunningham et al., 2003). The expansion of the microglial
population during neurodegeneration is almost exclusively
dependent upon proliferation of resident cells (Gomez-
Nicola et al., 2013, 2014a; Li et al., 2013). An increased
microglial proliferative activity has also been described in a
mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (Kamphuis et al.,
2012) and in post-mortem samples from patients with
Alzheimer’s disease (Gomez-Nicola et al., 2013, 2014b).
This proliferative activity is regulated by the activation of
the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R; Gomez-
Nicola et al., 2013). Pharmacological strategies inhibiting
the kinase activity of CSF1R provide beneficial effects on
the progression of chronic neurodegeneration, highlighting
the detrimental contribution of microglial proliferation
(Gomez-Nicola et al., 2013). The presence of a microglial
proliferative response with neurodegeneration is also sup-
ported by microarray analysis correlating clinical scores of
incipient Alzheimer’s disease with the expression of Cebpa
and Spi1 (PU.1), key transcription factors controlling
microglial lineage commitment and proliferation (Blalock
et al., 2004). Consistent with these data, Csf1r is upregu-
lated in mouse models of amyloidosis (Murphy et al.,
2000), as well as in human post-mortem samples from pa-
tients with Alzheimer’s disease (Akiyama et al., 1994).
Although these ideas would lead to the evaluation of the
efficacy of CSF1R inhibitors in Alzheimer’s disease, we
have little evidence regarding the level of microglial prolif-
eration in Alzheimer’s disease or the effects of CSF1R tar-
geting
in
animal
models
of
Alzheimer’s
disease-like
pathology. In this study, we set out to define the microglial
proliferative response in both human Alzheimer’s disease
and a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology,
as well as the activation of the CSF1R pathway. We pro-
vide evidence for a consistent and robust activation of a
microglial proliferative response, associated with the acti-
vation of CSF1R. We provide proof-of-target engagement
and
efficacy
of
an
orally
available
CSF1R
inhibitor
(GW2580), which inhibits microglial proliferation and par-
tially prevents the pathological progression of Alzheimer’s
disease-like
pathology,
supporting
the
evaluation
of
CSF1R-targeting approaches as a therapy for Alzheimer’s
disease.
Materials and methods
Study design
Sample size
The most suitable statistical test for our samples and experi-
ments, which reach the assumptions of normality and homo-
scedasticity
is
the
one-way
or
two-way
ANOVA.
After
performing power calculations, to achieve a significant differ-
ence of P 5 0.05, in light of a retrospective analysis of our
previous results (Gomez-Nicola et al., 2013, 2014a, b), we
needed
a
minimum
of
n = 4
(immunohistochemistry,
RT-PCR) and n = 6 (behaviour) to reach a power between
0.80–0.90, depending on the specific experimental conditions.
The calculations are the customary ones based on normal dis-
tributions and were performed following statistical advice from
the Research design and methodology Department of the
University of Southampton.
Data inclusion and exclusion
For RNA expression experiments performed in human post-
mortem samples, we excluded samples showing a low yield
and quality of recovered RNA, judged as having a difference
in the expression of the four selected housekeeping genes
higher than 5 Ct values and poor cross-correlation when

 compared to the other samples. No samples were excluded
from the experiments using APP/PS1 mice.
Randomization and blinding
The
experiments
were
designed
in
compliance
with
the
ARRIVE guidelines, including control groups for all experi-
ments, randomizing the procedures and applying double-
blinded analysis when possible.
Animals
APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice (APP/PS1) on a C57BL/6 background
were
originally
obtained
from
The
Jackson
Laboratory
(McClean et al., 2011). Heterozygous males were bred with
wild-type female C57BL/6J (Harlan) at our local facilities.
APP/PS1/Macgreen (c-fms EGFP) mice maintained at our
local facilities, after breeding c-fms EGFP mice (Sasmono
et al., 2003) with the APP/PS1 line, allowing the Macgreen
transgene to be expressed in heterozygosis. Offspring were
ear punched and genotyped using PCR with primers specific
for
the
APP-sequence
(forward:
GAATTCCGACATGA
CTCAGG,
reverse:
GTTCTGCTGCATCTTGGACA).
Mice
not expressing the transgene were used as wild-type controls.
Mice were housed in groups of 4 to 10, under a 12-h light/12-
h dark cycle at 21�C, with food and water ad libitum.
For the evaluation of the effects of treatment with GW2580,
mice were 6 months of age when treatment began (n = 6–8).
Mice were fed with a control diet (RM1) or a diet containing
GW2580 [Modified LabDiet� PicoLab EURodent Diet 14%,
5L0W
(5LF2)
with
0.1%
(1000 ppm)
GW2580
(LC
Laboratories); TestDiet] for 3 months, before behavioural
tasks were conducted. Alternatively, to test the effects of
increasing
doses
of
GW2580
on
microglial
survival,
GW2580 (LC Laboratories) was suspended in 0.5% hydroxy-
propylmethylcellulose and 0.1% Tween 80 and was dosed
orally at 0.2 ml per mouse (75 mg/kg), daily for five consecu-
tive days to wild-type mice. Mice weight was monitored during
all experiments. Mice received one injection of intraperitoneal
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) (Sigma-Aldrich; 7.5 mg/ml, 0.1 ml/
10 g weight in sterile saline), 1 day before the end of the ex-
periment. All procedures were performed in accordance with
UK Home Office licensing.
Post-mortem samples of
Alzheimer’s disease
For
immunohistochemical
analysis,
human
brain
autopsy
tissue samples (temporal cortex, paraffin-embedded, formalin-
fixed, 96% formic acid-treated, 6-mm sections) from the
National CJD Surveillance Unit Brain Bank (Edinburgh, UK)
were obtained from cases of Alzheimer’s disease (five females
and five males, age 58–76) or age-matched controls (four fe-
males and five males, age 58–79), in whom consent for use of
autopsy tissues for research had been obtained. All cases ful-
filled the criteria for the pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s
disease. Ethical permission for research on autopsy materials
stored in the National CJD Surveillance Unit was obtained
from Lothian Region Ethics Committee.
For mRNA analysis, human brain autopsy tissue samples
(temporal cortex, fresh-frozen tissue) were obtained from the
Human Tissue Authority licensed South West Dementia Brain
Bank, University of Bristol (UK). Samples were selected from
Alzheimer’s
disease
cases
and
age-matched
controls
(Supplementary Table 1). Ethical permission for research on
autopsy materials stored in the South West Dementia Brain
Bank was obtained from Local Ethics Committee.
Behavioural tests
APP/PS1 or wild-type mice treated with control (RM1) or
GW2580 diet, as stated earlier, were tested on behavioural
tasks at 9 months of age (3 months into the diet): open-field
locomotor and exploratory activity and burrowing activity
(sickness behaviour). For the behavioural analysis, n = 8–21
was used.
The open-field tests were carried out using activity monitor
software (Med Associated Inc.). The mice were placed in indi-
vidual cages of 27 � 27 � 0.3 cm for a period of 5 min, to
further analyse the total distance travelled (cm) and the
number of rears (vertical counts), using the average speed as
an internal control of the mouse motor abilities, during the test
period (5 min). For measuring anxiety-related behaviour, dif-
ferential exploratory activity (distance travelled or number of
entries) was analysed in a residual and an open zone, using
activity monitor software (Med Associated Inc.), as previously
described (Rothman et al., 2012).
For burrowing behaviour, plastic cylinders, 20-cm long and
6.8-cm in diameter were filled with 190 g of normal diet food
pellets and placed in individual mouse cages. Mice were placed
individually in the cages overnight, weighting the remaining
pellets
at
the
end
of
each
session,
and
calculating
the
amount displaced (‘burrowed’). The mice were returned then
to their home cage. Body weights and diet consumption of all
mice were monitored during the course of the experiment.
Discrete trial spontaneous alternation in the T-maze was
performed as previously described (Deacon and Rawlins,
2006). The apparatus for this test consisted of a grey
T-shaped maze with 30 � 10 � 29-cm arms, with a central
partition extending 7 cm into the start arm from the back of
the maze, and two guillotine doors each having the potential
to block off the left or right goal arms. Mice were placed in
the start arm of the maze (facing the wall) and allowed to
make a choice to enter the left or right goal arm. Following
their choice, they were then enclosed in that arm for 30 s to
facilitate habituation by sliding down the appropriate guil-
lotine door. Mice were then taken out of the maze, the cen-
tral partition removed and guillotine doors reopened. Mice
were once again placed in the start arm and allowed to
make another free choice of either goal arm. Whether or
not the mouse alternated was noted, with a score of 1
given if the mouse visited the other arm reflecting explora-
tory behaviour and memory of the first choice on its second
trial, and a score of 0 given if the mouse went to the same
arm on its second trial. The alternation ratio was obtained
as the mean of the 20 scores. If animals did not move in 90 s
or less these were considered failed trials and were not
scored; however, these did not account for 45% of all
trials and there was no effect of treatment or genotype for
missed trials (P = 0.97). The test was performed four times a
day for 5 days (a total of 20 trials) with an average spacing
of 2 h in between each trial.

 Immunohistochemistry
Coronal hippocampal sections were cut from paraformalde-
hyde-fixed, frozen or fresh brains. Mice perfusion, tissue
processing and immunohistochemical analysis was performed
as previously described (Gomez-Nicola et al., 2008, 2013),
using
the
following
primary
antibodies:
rabbit
anti-Iba1
(Wako), mouse anti-human Ki67 (Dako), mouse anti-BrdU
(DSHB), mouse anti-amyloid-b (6E10; Covance), mouse anti-
synaptophysin (SY38; Merck Millipore), rabbit anti-CSF1R
(Santa
Cruz
Biotechnologies)
and
rabbit
anti-PU.1
(Cell
Signaling). Following primary antibody incubation, the sec-
tions were washed and incubated with the appropriate bioti-
nylated secondary antibody (Vector Labs), and/or with the
appropriate Alexa 405, 488 or 568 conjugated secondary anti-
body or streptavidin (Molecular Probes). For co-labelling of
Iba1 and Ki67 in human tissue, following primary antibody,
sections were incubated with an anti-rabbit biotinylated sec-
ondary antibody (for Iba1 detection) and the ImmPRESS-AP
Anti-Mouse (alkaline phosphatase) Polymer Detection Kit (for
Ki67 detection), as previously described (Gomez-Nicola and
Boche, 2015; Gomez-Nicola and Perry, 2016). For light mi-
croscopy, the sections were visualized using 3,3’-diaminoben-
zidine (DAB) precipitation or BCIP/NBT AP reaction, in a
Leica CTR 5000 microscope, coupled to a Leica DFC300FX
microscope camera. For PU.1 visualization, the DAB signal
was enhanced with 0.05% nickel ammonium sulphate, produ-
cing a black precipitate. After immunofluorescence labelling,
nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining and the sections
were mounted with Mowiol/DABCO (Sigma-Aldrich) mixture.
The sections were visualized on a Leica TCS-SP5 confocal
system, coupled to a Leica CTR6500 microscope.
The general immunohistochemistry protocol was modified
for the detection of BrdU, adding a DNA denaturation step
with 2 N HCl (30 min, 37�C), as previously described (Gomez-
Nicola et al., 2011, 2013). For the detection of amyloid-b
plaques (6E10), sections were pretreated with 95% formic
acid (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at room temperature. All
other histological stains (i.e. Congo red) were done according
to standard laboratory procedures.
The protocol used for immunohistochemistry on human sec-
tions
was
a
modification
of
the
general
protocol
(DAB + alkaline phosphatase), with antigen unveiling in citrate
buffer being performed for 25 min, as previously described
(Gomez-Nicola et al., 2014b).
Golgi-Cox staining
A subgroup of APP/PS1 or wild-type mice treated with control
(RM1) or GW2580 diet (n = 4), as stated before, were deeply
anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and then transcar-
dially perfused with artificial CSF. Brains were then rapidly
dissected and sliced with a vibrating microtome (200 mm;
Leica).
The
hippocampal
slices
were
incubated
in
rapid
Golgi-Cox solutions, following manufacturer’s instructions
(FD Rapid Golgi Stain Kit, FD Neurotechnologies). The
slices were infused with a solution containing potassium di-
chromate, potassium chromate and mercuric chloride for 2
weeks, to be further developed into the Golgi-Cox staining
on free-floating plates. The slices were mounted onto gelati-
nized slides,
dried, dehydrated, cleared
with xylene and
mounted with DPX. Golgi-treated slices were analysed with
a
Leica
CTR
5000
microscope,
coupled
to
a
Leica
DFC300FX microscope camera. For the dendritic linear spine
density, Golgi-Cox-labelled apical dendritic processes of CA1
neurons were analysed.
Quantification and image analysis
The quantification of antigen positive cells (i.e. PU.1 +) in the
cerebral cortex (n = 4 fields/mouse, n = 4–8 mice/group) was
performed after DAB immunohistochemistry. The number of
double positive cells (i.e. Iba1 +BrdU +) in the specific area
(n = 4 fields/mouse, n = 4–8mice/group) was performed after
double immunofluorescence or double immunohistochemistry
with DAB/AP. Data were represented as number of positive
cells/mm2. The quantification of antigen-positive cells (i.e.
Iba1 +BrdU + or Iba1 +) in human brains was performed in
the white or grey matter of the temporal cortex after DAB/
AP
immunohistochemistry
(n = 20
fields/brain,
n = 9–10
brains/group). The quantification of the distribution of micro-
glial cells (PU.1 +) around amyloid-b plaques was performed
with an adapted version of the Sholl analysis, modified from
Frautschy et al. (1998). Briefly, we analysed all amyloid-b
plaques visible with Congo red staining (n = 4–6 sections/
mouse, n = 4–8 mice/group), tracing concentric circles starting
from the diameter of each individual plaque and setting radius
step size at 20 mm. The final radius was set when (i) an indi-
vidual plaque came into contact with a neighbouring plaque;
(ii) cell density reached wild-type levels; or (iii) a border of the
tissue was reached. PU.1 + cells density (cells/mm2) contained
within each circle was quantified, considering that cells falling
at the interphase of two radii were counted as belonging to the
section containing 450% of the cell. The quantification of the
intensity of signal (i.e. synaptophysin) was performed after
immunofluorescence, and presented as per cent stained area.
The quantification of enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP) intensity per cell in APP/PS1/Macgreen mice was per-
formed on confocal stacks, using a constant sampled area. All
quantifications were performed with the help of the ImageJ
image analysis software.
Analysis of gene expression by
reverse transcriptase PCR
APP/PS1 or wild-type mice treated with control (RM1) or
GW2580 diet (n = 4–6/group) were processed to obtain samples
from the cortex by dissection under a microscope, after intra-
cardiac perfusion with heparinized 0.9% saline. RNA was ex-
tracted using TRIzol� (Life Technologies), quantified using
Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific), and reverse transcribed using
the iScriptTM cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) following manufac-
turer’s instructions, after checking its integrity by electrophoresis
in a 2% agarose gel. cDNA libraries were analysed by quanti-
tative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the iTaqTM
Universal SYBR� Green supermix (Bio-Rad) and the following
custom designed gene-specific primers (Sigma-Aldrich): csf1

ose gel, checking the PCR product size. Data were analysed
using the 2-��Ct method with Primer Opticon 3 software,
using Gapdh (NM_008084.2; FW, tgaacgggaagctcactgg, RV,
tccaccaccctgttgctgta) as a housekeeping gene.
Frozen samples from Alzheimer’s disease cases or age-
matched controls (Supplementary Table 1) were processed
for RNA extraction and quantitative PCR analysis. RNA
was

using
Nanodrop
(Thermo
Scientific),
reverse
transcribed
using
the
iScript
cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad), following the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions, after checking its integrity by electrophoresis on a 1.8%
agarose gel. Low quality and purity RNA samples were
excluded from consequent experimentation. cDNA libraries
were analysed by quantitative PCR using 96-wells custom-de-
signed TaqMan� array plates with the 7500 Real-Time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems). Quality of the PCR reaction end
product was evaluated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose
gel. Raw CT data were obtained from the SDS v.2.0.6 soft-
ware and normalized to the normalization factor (geometric
mean of four housekeeping genes; GAPDH, HPRT, 18S and
GUSB) using the 2-��CT method.
Antibody arrays
APP/PS1 or wild-type mice treated with control (RM1) or
GW2580 diet (n = 4–6/group) were processed to obtain sam-
ples from the cortex by dissection under a microscope, after
intracardiac perfusion with heparinized 0.9% saline. Tissues
were homogenized in RIPA buffer and protein concentration
was quantified with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The
concentration of 40 mouse cytokines and chemokines was
analysed
with
Mouse
Quantibody
Cytokine
Arrays
Q5
(QAM-CYT-5; Raybiotech) by the Raybiotech testing service,
according to manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of
every cytokine was quantified using internal protein standards,
discarding data not reaching the detection threshold (LOD,
limit of detection). Data were represented as fold-change of
APP/PS1 + RM1
versus
wild-type + RM1
and
APP/
PS1 + GW2580 versus wild-type + GW2580.
Multiplex analysis of soluble
amyloid-b38, amyloid-b40 and
amyloid-b42
Protein samples obtained and quantified as above were ana-
lysed with an Ab V-plex triple ultra-sensitive assay kit accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions (Meso Scale Discovery).
Standards (amyloid-b1–38, amyloid-b1–40 and amyloid-b1–42)
and samples (diluted 1:20) were added to the 96-well plates,
incubated, washed, and read in a Sector Imager plate reader
(Meso Scale Discovery) immediately after addition of the Meso
Scale Discovery read buffer. Amyloid-b concentrations were
calculated with reference to the standard curves and expressed
as nanograms per millilitre.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean � standard error of the mean
(SEM) and analysed with the GraphPad Prism 5 software
package (GraphPad Software). For all datasets, normality
and homoscedasticity assumptions were reached, validating
the application of the two-way ANOVA (two variables were
analysed in all cases), followed by the Tukey post hoc test
for multiple comparisons. Relative gene expression data
from
human
samples
was
analysed
using
a
two-tailed
Fisher t-test. Correlation of relative gene expression in
human
samples
to
Braak
stage
was
tested
using
the
Kendall tau-b rank correlation test included in the SPSS ana-
lytic software (v.17; IBM). Differences were considered
significant for P 5 0.05.
Results
Microglial proliferation is increased in
Alzheimer’s disease and correlates
with disease severity
Although an increased microglial response has been docu-
mented in Alzheimer’s disease (Bondolfi et al., 2002;
Gomez-Nicola and Perry, 2014a, b), we identified the
need for a better understanding of microglial proliferation
and the expression of the potential pro-mitogenic compo-
nents in human tissue. The analysis of post-mortem cases of

 Increased microglial proliferation and
CSF1R activity are closely associated
with the progression of Alzheimer’s
disease-like pathology
We investigated the proliferative dynamics of microglial
cells and the expression of the components of the CSF1R
pathway in a relevant model of Alzheimer’s disease-like
pathology (APPswe, PSEN1dE9; APP/PS1). While micro-
glial accumulation around amyloid-b plaques has been
documented (Brawek et al., 2014), we took advantage of
the specificity of PU.1 expression in microglia to quantify
microglial numbers, as it allows an accurate identification
of microglial nuclei (Fig. 3A) (Gomez-Nicola et al., 2013,
2014a). Microglial numbers increase progressively in APP/
PS1 mice (from 9 to 14 months of age), when compared to
wild-type littermates, accumulating in the vicinity of amyl-
oid-b plaques (Fig. 3A). We observed that while the
number of plaques in APP/PS1 mice increases with age
(APP/PS1
9
months = 4.41 � 0.39
versus
APP/PS1
14
months = 7.25 � 1.82 plaques/mm2), neither their size nor
the pattern of microglial distribution change (Fig. 3B).
Microglial proliferation was evidenced by the incorporation
of BrdU in Iba1 + cells, analysed by confocal microscopy
(Fig. 3C). The number of Iba1 +/BrdU + cells increases pro-
gressively in APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 3D), in close association
with amyloid-b plaques (Fig. 3C).
Further analysis of gene expression showed upregulation
of the main components of the CSF1R pathway in APP/PS1
brains, with some genes being upregulated from 9 months
onwards (Csf1, Il34, Csf1r, Cebpa) and others from 14
months [Spi1 (Pu.1), Runx1] (Fig. 3E). These changes co-
incide with the upregulation of key inflammatory genes
associated with microglial activation (Fig. 3E).
We next analysed the localization of CSF1R in APP/PS1/
Macgreen mice (c-fms EGFP), as an optimal reporter line
for CSF1R expression, as EGFP is driven by the Csf1r pro-
moter (c-fms) (Sasmono et al., 2003). APP/PS1/Macgreen
mice showed a differential increased expression levels of
this receptor in microglial cells associated to amyloid-b
plaques, when compared to microglia distal to plaques
(Fig. 3F), with EGFP levels and distance to plaque centre
showing inversed correlation (Fig. 3G). This correlation can
also be observed when using CSF1R immunostaining
(Supplementary Fig. 1) and it is suggestive of an association
of CSF1R levels with the observed proliferative response.
Pharmacological targeting of CSF1R
activation with an orally-available
inhibitor blocks microglial prolifera-
tion in APP/PS1 mice
As CSF1R is likely to drive microglial proliferation in APP/
PS1 mice, we targeted the activation of CSF1R with a
selective inhibitor (GW2580) from 6 to 9 months of age,
to evaluate target engagement and efficacy of a CSF1R-
inhibitory approach (Fig. 5). To determine if microglia
would be the only target of CSF1R inhibitors, we used
APP/PS1/Macgreen mice as reporters of CSF1R expression.
Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy we
found no evidence of expression of CSF1R in neurons
(NeuN +) or astrocytes (GFAP +) (Supplementary Fig. 2),
supporting that CSF1R expression is exclusive to microglia,
as previously described (Sasmono et al., 2003; Erblich
et al., 2011; Gomez-Nicola et al., 2013). While a dose of
GW2580 of 75 mg/kg has been used in the past without
causing significant changes in the survival of microglia
(Gomez-Nicola et al., 2013), recent evidence supports
that CSF1R inhibitors could cause the depletion of the
microglial population (Elmore et al., 2014). Therefore, we
assessed
the
effects
of
repeated
increasing
doses
of
GW2580 (75, 150, 300 mg/kg) on the survival of the
microglial population (Supplementary Fig. 3). We found
that none of the doses of GW2580 caused any significant
change
in
the
total
number
of
microglial
cells
(Supplementary Fig. 3A and B), supporting the continued
use of the 75 mg/kg to maintain consistency with our pre-
viously published data (Gomez-Nicola et al., 2013).
Prolonged treatment with GW2580 caused a significant
reduction in the number of microglial cells and a blockade
of microglial proliferation in APP/PS1, when compared
with APP/PS1 on control diet (RM1) (Fig. 4A–C). The
treatment with the CSF1R selective inhibitor GW2580 did
not cause depletion of the microglial population in either
wild-type or APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 4A and B), suggesting spe-
cific targeting of microglial proliferation and not microglial
survival. In line with these results, GW2580 downregulated
the mRNA expression of Csf1r, Csf1, Spi1 (PU.1), Cebpa
and Runx1 in APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 4D), all involved in con-
trolling the pro-mitogenic programme. Some differences
were observed in this dataset (Fig. 4D) compared to previ-
ous ones (Fig. 3E), suggesting significant variability in this
model.
To better understand the impact of the prevention of
microglial proliferation in Alzheimer’s disease-like path-
ology we screened the expression of several inflammatory
mediators at the mRNA level (Fig. 4D) and at the protein
level using quantitative antibody arrays (Fig. 4E). Blockade
of microglial proliferation induced a significant reduction in
the expression of several inflammatory mediators at the
mRNA level (Fig. 4D). CSF1R inhibition in APP/PS1 mice
returned the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators
such as IL1A, IL12, IL17, CD30L, CCL1, CCL2 or
CXCL13 to wild-type levels, while upregulating the levels
of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL4, IL5 or IL13
(Fig. 4E) or the chemokine CCL9 (Fig. 4E). Blockade of
CSF1R prevented overexpression of CSF1 in APP/PS1, as
well as the downregulation of ICAM1, leptin and TNFR1
(Fig. 4E), highlighting some potentially beneficial side-
effects of CSF1R inhibition in microglial cells. Other mol-
ecules were unaffected by CSF1R inhibition, including IL7,
TNFR2, CCL11 and CCL24 (Fig. 4E).

 CSF1R inhibition prevents the pro-
gression of Alzheimer’s disease-like
pathology
The prolonged inhibition of CSF1R by GW2580 prevented
the behavioural deficits observed in APP/PS1 mice (Fig. 5).
Blockade of microglial proliferation with GW2580 caused
a significant recovery of the deficits in short-term memory
observed in APP/PS1 mice, analysed as spontaneous alter-
nation in the T-maze (Fig. 5A). The increased activity in the
open-field task observed in APP/PS1 was prevented by the
treatment with GW2580-containing diet (Fig. 5B). These
effects were associated with the development of a hyper-
active behaviour in APP/PS1 mice, rather than a change in
anxiety-related behaviour, as evidenced by the lack of pref-
erential use of the different zones of the arena (Fig. 5B) and
the lack of differences in the number of entries in the open
zone (Fig. 5C). A task associated with sickness behaviour
(burrowing) was found to be unchanged in APP/PS1 mice
(Fig. 5D). The treatment of wild-type or APP/PS1 mice with
a GW2580-containing diet for 3 months did not cause any
significant effects on weight gain, when compared with
mice treated with a control diet (RM1) (Fig. 5E).
One of the main pathological hallmarks in APP/PS1 mice,
the deposition of amyloid-b plaques, was found unchanged
after the treatment with GW2580, as evidenced by multi-
plex analysis of soluble amyloid-b38, amyloid-b40 and
amyloid-b42 (Fig. 6A), 6E10 immunostaining (Figs 6B and
7C) and Congo Red staining (not shown), suggesting a
requirement for microglial proliferation/activation to asso-
ciate the amyloidogenic component with the behavioural
decline observed in Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology.
However, prolonged blockade of CSF1R prevented the syn-
aptic degeneration observed in the hippocampus of APP/
PS1 mice, as evidenced by a significant recovery of synaptic
density at the hippocampus (Fig. 7A and B). This was fur-
ther confirmed by analysing spine density in CA1 neurons
by Golgi-Cox staining (Fig. 7C and D). We observed that
treatment with GW2580 caused a significant prevention
of the loss of dendritic spines observed in APP/PS1 mice
(Fig. 7C and D).
The observed beneficial effects of prolonged and specific
targeting of CSF1R, with the orally available inhibitor
GW2580, provide a proof of target engagement and effi-
cacy in a model of Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology.
Discussion
The innate immune component has a clear influence over
the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. The ana-
lysis of therapeutic approaches aimed at controlling neu-
roinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease is moving forward
at the preclinical and clinical level, with several clinical
trials aimed at modulating inflammatory components of
the disease. We have previously demonstrated that the pro-
liferation of microglial cells is a core component of the
neuroinflammatory response in a model of prion disease,
another chronic neurodegenerative disease, and is con-
trolled by the activation of CSF1R (Gomez-Nicola et al.,
2013). This aligns with recent reports pinpointing the
causative effect of the activation of the microglial prolifera-
tive response on the neurodegenerative events of human
and mouse Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting the activity
of the master regulator PU.1 (Gjoneska et al., 2015). Our
results provide a proof of efficacy of CSF1R inhibition for
the blockade of microglial proliferation in a model of
Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology. Treatment with the
orally available CSF1R kinase-inhibitor (GW2580) proves
to be an effective disease-modifying approach, partially im-
proving memory and behavioural performance, and pre-
venting synaptic degeneration. These results support the
previously reported link of the inflammatory response gen-
erated by microglia in models of Alzheimer’s disease with
the observed synaptic and behavioural deficits, regardless of
amyloid deposition (Jones and Lynch, 2014). Our findings
support the relevance of CSF1R signalling and microglial
proliferation in chronic neurodegeneration and validate the
evaluation
of
CSF1R
inhibitors
in
clinical
trials
for
Alzheimer’s disease.
Our findings show that the inhibition of microglial pro-
liferation in a model of Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology
does not modify the burden of amyloid-b plaques, suggest-
ing an uncoupling of the amyloidogenic process from the
pathological progression of the disease. Although a recent
report correlated the accumulation of microglia with the
expansion of amyloid-b plaques, suggesting that microglial

 cells could act as a ‘barrier’ (Condello et al., 2015), our
current data provide evidence that removing microglia does
not alter the deposition of amyloid-b. This indicates a ne-
cessity of the executive role of microglia to linking amyloid
deposition with the progression of cognitive decline. In this
direction, recent reports using Trem2 + /� mice on an APP/
PS1 background evidenced an impaired amplification of the
microglia population in response to amyloid-b, suggesting
that deficient phagocytosis could link with impaired micro-
glial proliferation (Ulrich et al., 2014). Linking TREM2
activation with CSF1R-induced proliferation could be pos-
sible through the adaptor molecule DAP12, as suggested

 for macrophages (Otero et al., 2009), although the func-
tional connection of amyloid-b phagocytosis and microglial
proliferation has not been reported to date. Our results are
in agreement with previously reported data using CD11b-
HSVTK mice under two different APP models, in which
microglial cells were depleted after treatment with gancic-
lovir (Grathwohl et al., 2009). The authors found no
change in the number of amyloid-b plaques despite the
fact that the brains of APP or APP/PS1 mice were virtually
devoid of microglia. Although the amyloid-b accumulation
is still considered a main driver of the pathogenic events in
Alzheimer’s disease, several studies support the notion that
additional factors are necessary for the development of the
cognitive decline. Amyloid-b and tau accumulation are fre-
quently observed in the brains of non-demented people
(Neuropathology
Group;
Medical
Research
Council
Cognitive and Aging, 2001). Also, patients immunized
against amyloid-b, leading to the effective removal of
their plaques, continued to decline in cognitive function
(Boche et al., 2008). Evidence suggests that inflammation
(Holmes et al., 2009), tangle pathology (Nelson et al.,
2012)
or
neurodegeneration-related
biomarkers
(Wirth
et al., 2013) correlate better with cognitive decline than
amyloid-b accumulation alone. All this evidence, together
with our present data, support an uncoupling of some
pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease from amyl-
oid-b, and highlight a more indirect route through the in-
flammatory component. A better understanding of what
processes are amyloid-b and/or tau dependent and which
ones are caused, or exacerbated by inflammation, would be
a
way
forward
to
dissect
the
pathophysiology
of
Alzheimer’s disease.
Interestingly, the report by Grathwohl et al. (2009) indir-
ectly supports our present findings regarding a relatively
high rate of microglial proliferation in APP/PS1 mice. The
fast depletion of microglia in CD11b-HSVTK (2 or 4-weeks
with ganciclovir) would only occur if all microglia were
entering the cell cycle during that time, as thymidine
kinase can only kill dividing cells. Although this prolifer-
ation rate is high it does suggest that other factors, such as
the recently reported anti-proliferative actions of ganciclo-
vir alone (Ding et al., 2014), are contributing to the
observed decline in microglia in CD11b-HSVTK mice
(Grathwohl et al., 2009). Our data suggest that, on average
in 9- and 14-month-old APP/PS1 mice, the proliferation
index (PI = Iba1 +BrdU + / total Iba1 +) is 1.9%, suggesting
that an estimated 53% of the microglia undergo prolifer-
ation during a 4-week period. This high rate is similar with
that found in human samples, where the proliferation index
(PI = Iba1 +Ki67 +
/ total Iba1 +) in Alzheimer’s disease
brains is 2.63% in grey matter and 1.52% in white
matter. The fact that the mild increase in total microglial
numbers in both APP/PS1 and human Alzheimer’s disease
is not justified by the reported high rates of proliferation
indicates the necessity of compensatory microglial death.
This aspect needs further exploration in future work, to

 better understand the observed discrepancies in different
brain
regions
(i.e.

grey
versus
white
matter). It is worth noting that the expansion of the micro-
glial population in the model used in the current study,
APP/PS1, courses without the contribution of circulating
monocytes, as evidenced by the use of CCR2 deficient
mice and bone-marrow transplant with head shielding
(Mildner et al., 2011).
While the mechanistic link of CSF1R with the observed
beneficial outcomes seems clear, there are variables to take
into account when evaluating potential candidate drugs tar-
geting CSF1R. The activation of CSF1R can be achieved by
two independent mitogens, CSF1 and IL34 (Hume and
MacDonald, 2012). Although both CSF1 and IL34 are ex-
pressed in many organs, IL34 appears particularly upregu-
lated in the developing and adult brain, suggesting specific
functions that do not overlap with those of CSF1 (Wei
et al., 2010). Recently, data arising from the generation
of IL34LacZ/LacZ mice showed that IL34 is a tissue-restricted
ligand, controlling the development of Langerhans cells in
the skin and microglia in the brain (Wang et al., 2012). In
contrast, targeted deletion of IL34 had little effect on other
myeloid-cell compartments and dendritic cell subsets were
largely unaffected (Greter et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012).
In conclusion, these studies suggest that the maintenance of
the populations of microglia and Langerhans cells is de-
pendent on IL34–CSF1R signalling, supporting the particu-
lar
ability
of
these
cell
populations
to
self-renew
throughout life (Merad et al., 2008; Ginhoux et al.,
2013). Therefore, and although our present data do not
show any significant change in IL34 levels, it would be
interesting to observe the impact of anti-IL34 therapeutic
approaches to provide a more targeted inhibition of the
functions controlled by CSF1R in the brain, without affect-
ing many populations in peripheral organs. This is a par-
ticularly relevant issue to be addressed, as a prolonged
systemic delivery of CSF1R inhibitors may cause an unba-
lanced response in CSF1R-dependent cells (Sauter et al.,
2014). The therapeutic potential of CSF1R inhibitors has
been suggested in inflammatory diseases, autoimmune dis-
orders, bone disease and cancer (Burns and Wilks, 2011;
Pyonteck et al., 2013). Monocyte-derived cell types are
most likely required for the long-term integrity of the
immune system. Therefore, the therapeutic benefit of influ-
encing their function in particular pathologies may result in
the alteration of the natural balance of the immune system,

 the consequences of which are hard to predict. In this dir-
ection, the use of imatinib (a PDGFR inhibitor with potent
activity over CSF1R) in clinical trials has shown that these
fears are unfounded, not presenting immune-related side
effects (Burns and Wilks, 2011). Similarly, an orally avail-
able
inhibitor,
JNJ-28312141,
has
substantial
activity
against CSF1R and the related receptor FLT3 (Manthey
et
al.,
2009).
JNJ-28312141
was
found
to
decrease
Kupffer cell numbers by 40%, and also to reduce macro-
phage
numbers
in
transplanted
tumours,
constraining
tumour growth (Manthey et al., 2009). Therefore, a more
targeted analysis of the peripheral effects of CSF1R inhib-
ition in ongoing or planned clinical trials is necessary, to
better ponder the long-term side effects of potential thera-
pies for Alzheimer’s disease.
One issue that requires comment is the selectivity of
CSF1R inhibitor GW2580. CSF1R belongs to the family
of type III growth factor receptors, including PDGFR, c-
KIT, FLT3 and c-fms (CSF1R). The structural similarity of
these receptors favours CSF1R inhibitors having certain
degree of promiscuity, potentially influencing other targets
(Hume and MacDonald, 2012). An analysis of the activity
and selectivity of several CSF1R inhibitors confirmed the
high selectivity of GW2580 for CSF1R, as all the other
compounds studied were also inhibitors of PDGFRb and
c-Kit (Uitdehaag et al., 2011). A novel inhibitor, PLX3397,
has been described to have potent activity over CSF1R,
inhibiting the survival of microglia in the healthy brain
and
causing
the
rapid
depletion
of
the
population
(Elmore et al., 2014). However, PLX3397 also has potent
inhibitory
activity
over
c-Kit,
FTL3
and
PDGFRb
(Patwardhan et al., 2014), confounding the reported effects
on the microglial population. Loss of PDGFb signalling, for
example, would be expected to have an impact on survival
of the NG2 pericytes leading to damage of the blood–brain
barrier and neurodegeneration (Bell et al., 2010). The par-
ticular effects of these approaches on the microglial popu-
lation
highlight
an
important
aspect:
a
therapeutic
approach to control CSF1R activity should be effective in
inhibiting microglial proliferation, but not affecting the sur-
vival of the remaining microglial cells, compromising other-
wise the normal brain function (Gomez-Nicola and Perry,
2014a, b). Our evidence shows that GW2580 selectively
inhibits microglial proliferation, and not survival, as long-
term dosing does not cause a significant reduction in the
number of microglial cells in wild-type mice. CSF1R acti-
vation has pleiotropic effects, ranging from the control of
cell survival, proliferation or chemotaxis, based on the dif-
ferential binding of adapter proteins and phosphorylation
pattern of its intracellular domain (Pixley and Stanley,
2004). Evidence from conformational analysis supports
the idea that different CSF1R inhibitors can bind the
active or inactive forms of the receptor and also show dif-
ferent dissociation rates, suggesting that these biophysical
properties could underpin a differential functional activa-
tion of CSF1R (Uitdehaag et al., 2011). These ideas need to
be taken into account to fully understand the effects of a
sustained inhibition of CSF1R in the normal physiology of
the brain.
In summary, the present data provide strong evidence for
an
increased
proliferative
response
in
microglia
in
Alzheimer’s disease, as well as their dependence upon
CSF1R activation. Prolonged reduction of microglial acti-
vation and proliferation in Alzheimer’s disease mice using a
selective CSF1R inhibitor prevents cognitive decline, re-
gardless of amyloid plaque pathology. We provide support
for the efficacy of CSF1R inhibitory strategies in the treat-
ment of Alzheimer’s disease-like pathology to reduce micro-
glia
numbers
and
reduce
the
potentially
damaging
components of neuroinflammation, thus underpinning the
possible evaluation of CSF1R inhibitors in clinical trials for
Alzheimer’s disease.
