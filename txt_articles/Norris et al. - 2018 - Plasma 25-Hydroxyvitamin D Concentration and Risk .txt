We examined the association between plasma 25-
hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration and islet auto-
immunity (IA) and whether vitamin D gene polymorphisms
modify the effect of 25(OH)D on IA risk. We followed 8,676
children at increased genetic risk of type 1 diabetes at six
sites in the U.S. and Europe. We defined IA as positivity for
at least one autoantibody (GADA, IAA, or IA-2A) on two or
more visits. We conducted a risk set sampled nested case-
control study of 376 IA case subjects and up to 3 control
subjects per case subject. 25(OH)D concentration was mea-
sured on all samples prior to, and including, the first IA positive
visit. Nine polymorphisms in VDR, CYP24A, CYP27B1, GC,
and RXRA were analyzed as effect modifiers of 25(OH)D.
Adjusting for HLA-DR-DQ and ancestry, higher childhood
25(OH)D was associated with lower IA risk (odds ratio =
0.93 for a 5 nmol/L difference; 95% CI 0.89, 0.97). More-
over, this association was modified by VDR rs7975232
(interaction P = 0.0072), where increased childhood 25(OH)D
was associated with a decreasing IA risk based upon
number of minor alleles: 0 (1.00; 0.93, 1.07), 1 (0.92; 0.89,
0.96), and 2 (0.86; 0.80, 0.92). Vitamin D and VDR may have
a combined role in IA development in children at in-
creased genetic risk for type 1 diabetes.
Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disease with increas-
ing incidence worldwide and a geographical gradient in risk
where incidence is higher at higher latitudes (1). Vitamin D
represents a candidate protective factor for type 1 diabetes
as it regulates the immune system and autoimmunity (2),
and vitamin D status varies by latitude (3). Vitamin D sup-
plementation in infancy may be associated with a lower risk
of type 1 diabetes (4), yet there is substantial heterogeneity
across studies (5). Moreover, dietary intake of vitamin D
(from food and supplements) throughout childhood has not
been found to be associated with either islet autoimmunity
(IA) or the progression from IA to type 1 diabetes (6).
Previous studies are limited in that dietary intake is
only one of a number of determinants of circulating 25-
hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], an established marker of
vitamin D status that may more accurately reflect vitamin D

 exposure. Although 25(OH)D levels are lower in individuals
with type 1 diabetes at diagnosis compared with control
subjects (7,8), it is unclear whether levels are lower prior to
diagnosis. Serum 25(OH)D levels in pregnancy (9,10) and at
birth (11,12) are not consistently associated with develop-
ment of IA or type 1 diabetes in the offspring. Although one
cross-sectional analysis showed lower 25(OH)D concentra-
tions in a young cohort of IA-positive subjects compared
with IA-negative subjects (13), another showed no differ-
ence in 25(OH)D level by IA positivity (14). In prospective
studies of children at increased risk for type 1 diabetes,
25(OH)D levels were not associated with IA development
or progression to type 1 diabetes (6,15). Yet, subjects with
adult-onset type 1 diabetes had lower 25(OH)D levels prior
to diagnosis than control subjects (16,17), suggesting a pro-
tective effect in adult-onset disease.
These discrepant results may be due to features of study
designs, population variation in 25(OH)D levels, and/or
a failure to account for underlying genetic variation in
the vitamin D pathway. A number of genes play a role in
transporting 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D (notably GC, which
encodes the vitamin D binding protein [VDBP]), converting
25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)2D (CYP27B1), degrading 1,25(OH)2D
(CYP24A1), and enabling the action of 1,25(OH)2D (VDR
and RXRA). The VDR gene encodes the vitamin D receptor,
which forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor
a, encoded by RXRA. In the presence of 1,25(OH)2D, this
heterodimer binds to vitamin D response elements at
many loci, altering gene expression in a number of biolog-
ical pathways to influence disease risk. For example, there is
a vitamin D response element influencing HLA-DRB1 gene
expression. Variation in genes in the vitamin D pathway
may modify the effectiveness of 25(OH)D concentration. In
The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young
(TEDDY) study, we examined whether 25(OH)D concentra-
tion in early infancy and throughout childhood is associated
with development of IA. We hypothesized that the associ-
ation between 25(OH)D concentration and IA is modified
by genetic variants in the vitamin D metabolism pathway.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
TEDDY is a prospective study of children at increased risk of
type 1 diabetes conducted in centers in the U.S. (Colorado,
Georgia/Florida, Washington) and Europe (Finland, Germany,
and Sweden). Detailed study design and methods have been
previously published (18). Institutional review board approval
and written informed consent was obtained for all children.
The study is monitored by an External Evaluation Commit-
tee formed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
TEDDY Cohort
Between September 2004 and February 2010, a total of
424,788 newborn infants were screened for type 1 diabetes–
associated HLA genotypes (19). The initial screening iden-
tified 21,589 eligible infants, of whom 8,676 were enrolled
in the follow-up study before age 4 months.
Infants from the general population, with no first-degree
relative with type 1 diabetes, were eligible if they had any
one of the following HLA-DR-DQ genotypes: 1, DR3-DQ2/
DR4-DQ8; 2, DR4-DQ8/DR4-DQ8; 3, DR4-DQ8/DR8-DQ4;
or 4, DR3-DQ2/DR3-DQ2. Infants with a first-degree rela-
tive with type 1 diabetes were eligible with any above genotype
or with 5, DR4-DQ8/DR4-DQ2.3; 6, DR4-DQ8/DR1-DQB
5.1; 7, DR4-DQ8/DR13-DQ6.4; 8, DR4-DQ8/DR9-DQ9.3;
or 9, DR3-DQ2/DR9-DQ9.3. These HLA-DR-DQ genotypes
are referred to in the text by abbreviated names listing only
DR/DR genotypes (HLA-DR3/4 is defined as 1 above).
Clinic visits occurred every 3 months between 3 and 48
months of age, and every 6 months thereafter. The child’s
weight and height (or length) were measured at each visit.
Participants who lived far from the TEDDY clinic were placed
on a long distance protocol, which permitted remote sam-
pling with shipment overnight to the research clinic.
Serum autoantibodies to glutamate decarboxylase (GADA),
insulinoma antigen-2 (IA-2A), and insulin (IAA) were mea-
sured in two harmonized core laboratories using radiobind-
ing assays incorporating extensive quality control (20,21).
Positive results due to maternal IgG transmission were re-
moved. Persistent IA was defined as positive antibodies to
the same antigen confirmed by both core laboratories in
two consecutive samples, with the date of seroconversion
defined as that of the first positive sample.
Nested Case-Control Study
We conducted a nested case-control study using risk set
sampling, as described previously (22), using data collected
as of 31 May 2012. Briefly, 418 persistent IA case subjects
were identified and 3 control subjects per case subject were
selected. A control subject was a participant who had not
developed persistent IA by the time the case subject to
whom it was matched had developed IA, within 645 days
of the event time. Matching factors were clinical center, sex,
and family history of type 1 diabetes to control for differ-
ences in geographic area, genetic background, and sample/
data handling between clinical centers.
25(OH)D Measurement
Plasma from blood drawn into light-protected tubes at all
visits up to the event time in case and control subjects was
sent to the Genomics and Biomarkers Unit, National Insti-
tute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland. There, 25(OH)D
concentrations were measured using the ARCHITECT 25-OH
Vitamin D chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay
(CMIA). The assay was standardized against calibrators trace-
able to internal reference material (Sigma17938). Precision
within the project, expressed as the coefficient of variation for
four different external quality control samples included in
each run, at concentration range 40.2–96.0 nmol/L, was 3.6–
4.8%. The respective value for four internal control samples,
at concentration range 37.9–104.4 nmol/L, was 2.7–4.8%.
The laboratory was blinded to the external quality control
samples and case-control status. The laboratory participates

 Scheme); during this project, mean bias 6 SD from the
ALTM (all-laboratory trimmed mean) for the participating
laboratories was 3.8 6 5.6% (n = 14), and mean bias 6 SD
from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
target value was 25.0 6 8.7% (n = 14) for samples ranging
between 24.5 and 98.4 nmol/L.
The ARCHITECT CMIA method is a high throughput
method with excellent reproducibility and is commonly
used in clinical laboratories. The method requires about
10 mL of sample, making it an attractive choice in children’s
studies, where limited sample volumes are available. Fur-
thermore, it is relatively inexpensive. The reference method
for 25(OH)D determination is based on liquid chromatog-
raphy–tandem mass spectrometry, which is more specific
and allows the separation of different isomers of vitamin D
as well as measurement of low levels of them (including
1,25(OH)2D). Also, additional variability in results, poten-
tially caused by differences in VDBP levels in pregnant
women or in patients on dialysis, is avoided. These issues
are, however, irrelevant in TEDDY. Therefore, because of
excellent suitability for high throughput analysis, the low
sample amount required, the excellent reproducibility of
the method, and lack of any clinically interfering states,
the ARCHITECT assay was chosen. Excellent agreement
of the method with liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry in the concentration range relevant to this
study (slope 1.02, up to 80 nmol/L) was previously shown
in population samples (23).
Vitamin D Gene Genotyping
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped us-
ing the Illumina Infinium ImmunoChip, a custom genotyp-
ing array of 195,806 SNPs selected for associations with
autoimmune disease. SNPs with call rates ,90% or allele
distributions strongly deviating from Hardy-Weinberg equi-
librium in control subjects (P , 1026) (except for the HLA
region) were discarded. Individuals with call rates ,95% or
those discordant with reported sex or prior genotyping
were also discarded.
In order to estimate ancestry, we performed a principal
components analysis with the ImmunoChip data on the
entire TEDDY cohort, after selecting one subject per family,
using EIGENSTRAT software.
For purposes of our targeted hypothesis regarding the
vitamin D gene pathway and the effect of 25(OH)D, we
identified SNPs in GC (rs7041), VDR [rs1544410 (BsmI),
rs731236 (TaqI), rs11568820 (Cdx2), rs7975232 (ApaI)],
CYP27B1 (rs10877012, rs4646536), CYP24A1 (rs4809959,
rs2616277), and RXRA (rs3818740, rs10881582). rs731236
and rs10877012 were removed from analysis as they were
in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs1544410 and
rs4646536, respectively.
Statistical Analyses
Children who were missing either 25(OH)D levels or vitamin D
gene data were excluded from analysis, resulting in 376 case
and 1,041 control subjects (297 case subjects with 3 control
subjects, 71 case subjects with 2 control subjects, and 8
case subjects with 1 control subject). The median age at
seroconversion in case subjects was 21 months (minimum = 2,
quartile [Q] 1 = 12, Q3 = 31, maximum = 72). The children
had 25(OH)D measures on multiple time points prior to
and including the seroconversion visit (minimum = 1,
Q1 = 2, median = 3, Q3 = 4.5, maximum = 8). Conditional
logistic regression was used to compare case and matched
control subjects, adjusting for HLA genotype and the first two
principal components (PC) from the principal components
analysis described previously, in order to adjust for ancestry.
We identified factors influencing 25(OH)D concen-
tration in our control subjects (Supplementary Table 1) to
determine factors for adjustment to remove extraneous var-
iation. We first explored taking the slope of 25(OH)D con-
centration over all time points in each child, as a measure of
change in 25(OH)D over time. The subject-specific ran-
dom slopes and random intercepts were generated
from a linear mixed-effects model of 25(OH)D concen-
tration at all time points, adjusting for season of blood
draw, age of blood draw, year of blood draw, height, weight,
long distance protocol, and sample set. Conditional logistic
regression analysis, adjusting for HLA-DR3/4 status, showed
that the adjusted slope of 25(OH)D concentration was not
different between case and control subjects (odds ratio [OR]
0.87; 95% CI 0.36, 2.10), suggesting that change in 25(OH)D
over time was not associated with IA. Hence, assuming a
constant 25(OH)D in each child, we then calculated an aver-
age 25(OH)D concentration over all time points in each child
(childhood 25(OH)D concentration) as a summary exposure
variable. We created an adjusted 25(OH)D variable by regress-
ing 25(OH)D concentration on the visit-level variables
listed in Supplementary Table 1 using a general linear
model. Residuals for each time point were obtained, and
the averaged residual was compared between case and
matched control subjects using conditional logistic regres-
sion adjusting for HLA-DR3/4 status and two PCs indicat-
ing ancestry. The adjusted childhood average 25(OH)D
residual produced a similar association (OR 0.94; 95% CI
0.90, 0.98) to that obtained with measured 25(OH)D con-
centration (Table 2) (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.89, 0.97), suggest-
ing that accounting for visit-level variables such as season of
blood collection was not necessary. We therefore continued
our analysis with the measured 25(OH)D concentration for
increased interpretability.
As previous studies have suggested the importance of
early exposure (5), we examined 25(OH)D in early infancy
by using the concentration at the first visit (early infancy
25(OH)D concentration). The first 25(OH)D measure was
at 3 months of age in 68%, 6 months in 20%, 9 months in
7%, and $12 months in 5% of the children. Only those
children whose first visit occurred before 12 months are
included in the early infancy 25(OH)D analysis, resulting
in 360 case and their control subjects (269 case subjects
with 3 control subjects, 83 case subjects with 2 control sub-
jects, and 8 case subjects with 1 control subject). In this
analysis, we adjusted for season and age at the first sample,
in addition to HLA and ancestry.

25(OH)D and Islet Autoimmunity
Diabetes Volume 67, January 2018
 Log-linearity of the childhood 25(OH)D concentration
and IA association was examined by plotting cumulative
martingale residuals (24); the supremum test showed no
indication of violating log-linearity, suggesting that it is
appropriate to analyze 25(OH)D concentration as a contin-
uous variable. However, given that the U.S. Institute of
Medicine (25) and European guidelines (26) suggest that
25(OH)D concentrations $50 nmol/L are optimal, we also
categorized 25(OH)D concentration based on this cut point,
and defined childhood vitamin D sufficiency as an average
25(OH)D concentration over all time points of $50 nmol/L.
Early infancy vitamin D sufficiency was defined as the first
measured 25(OH)D concentration $50 nmol/L. Average
childhood 25(OH)D concentration was within the suf-
ficient range (25,26) in 58% of the children, whereas
in early infancy, 49% of the children were vitamin D suffi-
cient. As the Endocrine Society recommends attaining
a 25(OH)D concentration above 75 nmol/L (27), in an ex-
ploratory analysis, we further divided the vitamin D suffi-
ciency variable into 50–75 nmol/L and .75 nmol/L in
order to examine whether the higher cutoff provides addi-
tional information
regarding
risk.
Average
childhood
25(OH)D was above 75 nmol/L in 10% of the children,
whereas in early infancy, 12% of the children had 25(OH)
D .75 nmol/L.
We tested for an interaction between 25(OH)D concen-
tration and clinical center. The interaction term was not
significant, suggesting that the association between 25(OH)D
and IA did not differ by TEDDY clinical center. All analyses
were performed using SAS, version 9.4. Two-sided P value ,
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
When examining our a priori proposed 25(OH)D 3
vitamin D gene interactions, each SNP was analyzed additively
by treating the number of minor alleles as a continuous variable.
False discovery rate adjusted P values are also reported for
multiple testing correction for nine SNPs (28).
RESULTS
The childhood and early infancy mean 25(OH)D concen-
trations of the case and control subjects by the matching
variables are shown in Table 1. Adjusting for HLA-DR3/4
and the first two PCs indicating ancestry, higher 25(OH)D
concentrations throughout childhood and in early infancy
were associated with lower IA risk (Table 2). Moreover,
being vitamin D sufficient in childhood was associated
with a 31% lower risk of IA compared with those that were
insufficient. Similarly, early infancy vitamin D sufficiency
was associated with a 40% lower risk of IA compared
with those who were insufficient. When we further catego-
rize the vitamin D sufficiency variable into 50–75 nmol/L
and .75 nmol/L and compare these categories to vitamin
D insufficiency (,50 nmol/L), we find a consistent inverse
association between vitamin D status and IA at both the
lower and higher categories of sufficiency (Supplementary
Table 2), suggesting that further categorization of our vita-
min D sufficiency variable is not informative. Therefore,
our remaining analyses are conducted using 25(OH)D as a
continuous variable and as a dichotomous vitamin D suffi-
ciency variable, as previously defined.
In a secondary analysis in which we restricted the case
definition to those who had multiple autoantibodies, which
is strongly predictive of type 1 diabetes (29), we show
similar statistically significant inverse associations between
vitamin D and the outcome of multiple autoantibodies
(Table 2).
Our a priori hypothesis was that the association between
25(OH)D and IA would be modified by SNPs in the vitamin
D metabolism genes. We detected significant interactions

 between the VDR SNP rs7975232 and childhood and early
infancy 25(OH)D concentration (interaction P value =
0.0072 and 0.0019, respectively) and childhood and early
infancy vitamin D sufficiency (interaction P value = 0.01
and 0.0051, respectively), adjusting for the HLA-DR3/4 and
ancestry (Table 3). The association between childhood
25(OH)D and IA was modified by rs7975232, where for
each additional minor allele, increased 25(OH)D concentra-
tion was associated with a greater decreased IA risk (Fig. 1).
A similar relationship was seen for early infancy 25(OH)D
concentration. The inverse association between vitamin D
sufficiency and IA is absent in those with no minor alleles
and becomes stronger with each additional allele; in those
with two minor alleles, being vitamin D sufficient in child-
hood or in early infancy was associated with a 59% and 67%,
respectively, lower risk of IA compared with those that were
insufficient.
In our secondary analysis using only those with multiple
autoantibodies for our case subjects, we detected similar in-
teractions between rs7975232 and childhood 25(OH)D con-
centration (interaction P = 0.0199), early infancy 25(OH)D
concentration (interaction P = 0.0055), childhood vitamin D
sufficiency (interaction P = 0.0065), and early infancy vita-
min D sufficiency (interaction P = 0.0111) on IA risk.
DISCUSSION
In this large prospective study of children at increased
type 1 diabetes risk, we found that higher plasma 25(OH)D
concentration is associated with a decreased risk of IA. The
inverse association was seen when considering the entire
cohort, but upon further analysis was primarily seen in
those carrying a specific variant in the VDR gene. These
relationships remained after limiting our case subjects to
those with multiple autoantibodies, a definition that is
strongly predictive of type 1 diabetes (29). Our data suggest
that vitamin D level and VDR may have a combined role in
conferring risk of developing IA, suggesting that the under-
lying mechanism involves vitamin D action.
Genetic modification of the effect of 25(OH)D may offer
an explanation for the inconsistencies in the evidence regarding
the putative protective role of vitamin D in type 1 diabetes.
Our observation that increasing 25(OH)D concentration
was associated with decreased IA risk only in those with
minor alleles at VDR rs7975232 is novel and suggests that
this underlying susceptibility may be related to the ability to
adequately use vitamin D. The previous studies of at-risk
children that failed to find an association between 25(OH)D
and either IA or type 1 diabetes (6,15) had not explored
interactions between 25(OH)D and VDR variants. Previ-
ous studies also had fewer IA cases than TEDDY, perhaps
resulting in reduced power to detect the relatively small
effect size that is observed when not accounting for the
interaction.
Vitamin D acts through the vitamin D receptor encoded
by the VDR gene. Functional VDR variants act within a com-
plex gene network conferring greater gene activity in part
via enhanced gene transcription or mRNA stability, ulti-
mately modulating expression of VDR target genes (30)
through vitamin D response elements. The genetic informa-
tion in our study was derived from SNPs measured in an
array platform, which incompletely characterize the target
genes and cannot precisely identify potential causal vari-
ants. In addition, we lack functional data to explore why
and how the identified VDR variants may modify 25(OH)D
associations.
Nevertheless, rs7975232 represents the ApaI RFLP, one
of three nonfunctional variants (BsmI, ApaI, and TaqI) that
are in linkage disequilibrium with each other and with the
polyA VNTR in the 39UTR of VDR, which helps regulate
gene expression. PolyA variants (falling into a bimodal dis-
tribution of short and long polyA regions) are associated with
differences in VDR activity (31). The BsmI-ApaI-TaqI haplo-
type containing the ApaI(rs7975232) minor allele (linked to
the short polyA region) appears to display better vitamin D
response, as measured by in vivo response to calcitriol treat-
ment and serum osteocalcin levels (30). This is consistent
with our finding that the effect of 25(OH)D concentration
is more pronounced in those with minor alleles at rs7975232.

ically active 1,25(OH)2D3 in the TEDDY children, circulating

25(OH)D and Islet Autoimmunity
Diabetes Volume 67, January 2018
 25(OH)D concentration has been shown to predict levels of
1,25(OH)2D3 (32,33). The VDBP, which transports 25(OH)D
to the kidney for conversion to 1,25(OH)2D, likely plays an
important role in the body’s ability to use 25(OH)D effec-
tively. Although we did not measure VDBP levels in TEDDY,
we found that 25(OH)D concentration did not interact with
rs7041 in GC (the gene that encodes VDBP) on the risk of
IA (Table 3).
The epidemiological data suggest a possible scenario where
greater VDR activity for a given amount of 1,25(OH)2D could
provide protection in situations of low 25(OH)D. For ex-
ample, the BsmI BB genotype was associated with type 1
diabetes risk only in environments of high 25(OH)D levels
(34). In another autoimmune disease, systemic lupus ery-
thematosus, CYP24A1 rs4809959 modified the effect of
25(OH)D, where for each additional minor allele, increased
25(OH)D was associated with further decreased systemic
lupus erythematosus risk (35). Low 25(OH)D concentration
was associated with a composite outcome of incident hip
fracture, myocardial infarction, cancer, and mortality
only in those who had one or more minor allele at VDR
loci (36). Other studies have found a combined effect of
VDR variants and 25(OH)D on risk of breast cancer (BsmI)
(37), prostate cancer (Cdx2) (38), and asthma (TaqI) (39).
1,25(OH)2D3 autoregulates the expression of the VDR
gene in target cells (40,41), and nearly all immune cells
express the VDR, suggesting a plausible mechanism by
which 1,25(OH)2D3 is immunomodulatory. 1,25(OH)2D3
has both pro- and anti-inflammatory actions, which may
be particularly important for autoimmune disease. As mono-
cytes differentiate into dendritic cells, 1,25(OH)2D3 pushes
them toward a tolerogenic state characterized by anti-
inflammatory IL-10 dominance over proinflammatory
cytokines such as IL-12 and TNFa. Conversely, 1,25(OH)2D3
stimulates the initial differentiation of monocytes into
proinflammatory macrophages producing IL-1B and
cathelicidin for effective pathogen clearance. However,
1,25(OH)2D3 subsequently decreases macrophage produc-
tion of a variety of proinflammatory factors while increas-
ing anti-inflammatory IL-10 to restore macrophage balance
(reviewed in Dankers et al. [42]). Taken in total, these
actions are consistent with decreased autoimmunity with-
out compromising immune defense against pathogens.
1,25(OH)2D promotes immune tolerance by not only
shifting the balance of the body’s T-cell response from Th1
to a Th2 response but also by maintaining B-cell homeosta-
sis (reviewed in Altieri et al. [43]) and thus may decrease
the risk of autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes.
Vitamin D deficiency in early life led to an earlier onset and
higher risk of diabetes in the genetically predisposed NOD
mouse (44). Likewise, treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 or its
structural analogs may result in a decrease in insulitis and
diabetes development in NOD mice (reviewed in Mathieu
[45]). However, in humans, low-dose 1,25(OH)2D offered
little improvement on insulin requirements in subjects with
new-onset diabetes (46,47), although this may have been
because treatment occurred too late in the disease process.

 Although we had adequate power to detect the described
interaction between 25(OH)D and VDR, other genetic inter-
actions of smaller magnitude might be missed here and
would require even larger studies for detection. We were
not able to examine the association between IA and vitamin
D deficiency, as only 6% of the children in our nested
case-control study were vitamin D deficient, as defined
by average childhood 25(OH)D concentration ,30 nmol/L.
Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that 25(OH)D
concentration may be marking confounding variables such as
a different lifestyle, social class, or eating habits.
Vitamin D insufficiency (i.e., 25(OH)D concentra-
tion ,50 nmol/L) is relatively common, detected in 42%
of the at-risk children in TEDDY, and in 22–67% of patients
with new-onset type 1 diabetes (48–50). Although ours is
an observational study, our results suggest that attaining
vitamin D sufficiency in children at risk for developing type 1
diabetes may have a protective role. Interventions in infants

($50 nmol/L) versus insufficient by number of minor alleles (the C allele) at rs7975232 in the vitamin D receptor gene. Analyses are adjusted for
HLA-DR3/4 and the first two PCs indicating ancestry; and ORs are calculated from the SNP 3 vitamin D measure interaction terms. For
childhood vitamin D measures, we analyzed 376 case subjects and their control subjects (297 case subjects with 3 control subjects, 71 case
subjects with 2 control subjects, and 8 case subjects with 1 control subject) with complete plasma 25(OH)D and vitamin D genetic data. For the
early infancy vitamin D measures, we analyzed 360 case subjects and their control subjects (269 case subjects with 3 control subjects, 83 case
subjects with 2 control subjects, and 8 case subjects with 1 control subject).

 and children via vitamin D supplementation (51) or dietary
modification (52) have been successful in attaining vitamin
D sufficiency. Whether or not these efforts should target
children who have specific variants in the VDR gene requires
further investigation.
In conclusion, this study indicates that higher concentra-
tion of circulating 25(OH)D in combination with VDR geno-
type may decrease risk of IA in children who are at increased
risk for type 1 diabetes, as defined by HLA genotype or family
history of type 1 diabetes. Further studies are needed to
confirm these associations and to enhance knowledge of how
variation in vitamin D metabolism genes may alter individual
responsiveness to vitamin D. Measurement of an individual’s
vitamin D status, along with genetic variation within vita-
min D metabolism genes, may help identify individuals most
responsive to intervention.
