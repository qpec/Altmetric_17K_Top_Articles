Did austerity cause the rise 
in deaths seen in England 
and Wales in 2015? 
Introduction
The end-of-life period is preceded by a period 
of declining self-rated health and increasing 
dependence (Kalbarczyk-Steclik and Nicinska, 
2015; Stenholm et al, 2015). Primary care 
and nursing home costs generally rise with an 
average of 6 years of poor health before death 
(McGrail et al, 2000; Leadbeater and Garber, 
2010). Hospital costs increase ten-fold from 5 
years before death to the last year of life, and this 
overshadows a 30% increase from 65 
to 75 years (Seshamani and Gray, 2003). Some 
55% of a person’s total hospital bed days occur in 
the last year of life (Hanlon et al, 1998), and 87% 
of people are hospitalised at least once in the 
last year (Karamanidis et al, 2007). Costs 
especially escalate in the last 22 weeks of life 
(Beeknoo and Jones, 2016).
A recent review of the factors infl
 uencing 
hospital bed occupancy has concluded that 
end-of-life represents a signifi
 cant contribution 
to the marginal changes in bed occupancy. 
The same study established that occupied beds 
rose and fell in parallel with all-cause mortality 
(Beeknoo and Jones, 2016). Hence, anything 
capable of infl
 uencing deaths will have a major 
impact on both health and social care costs. The 
ABSTRACT
Several recent studies have suggested that austerity led to higher deaths in England and Wales in 
2015. There are several key observations that argue against this conclusion. A rise in deaths also 
occurred in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland where health and social care is integrated, and 
did not suffer the degree of austerity imposed on adult social care in England. In addition, there 
is no apparent relationship between local authority deprivation score and the increase in deaths 
in 2015. Furthermore, austerity cannot explain those local authorities which showed a reduction 
in deaths in 2015. Deaths across Europe likewise displayed a signif
 cant increase in 2015, which 
appears linked to events leading up to a spike in deaths in January 2015. This initiated ongoing 
effects on mortality and morbidity. Deaths also show on/off switching in all countries so far 
studied, and show additional diversity at sub-local government geographies. The single-year-
of-age patterns in mortality observed in one of the studies contradicts a general effect due to 
austerity, and has been reported elsewhere. These patterns may arise from ‘original antigenic sin’ 
and if so this would suggest an infectious aetiology. Increased hospital bed occupancy for certain 
conditions also appears to characterise this and previous events.

large rise in deaths in 2015 has led to several 
studies suggesting that austerity may be the 
principle cause (Loopstra et al, 2016; Hiam et 
al, 2017a; b; Green et al, 2017). Given the huge 
implications of these claims to government 
policy, further examination of these conclusions 
is warranted. Both these (Green et al, 2017; Hiam 
et al, 2017a; b) and the previous study (Loopstra 
et al, 2016) contain several potential fl
 aws which 
need to be explored in greater detail.
On/off switching
The recent studies of Green et al (2017) and 
Hiam et al (2017a; b) used calendar year totals 
to investigate a large diff
 erence between total 
deaths in 2015 versus 2014. However, the 
situation is far more complex than using simple 
simple calendar year totals. In this respect, 
Figure 1 uses a running (moving) 12-month total 
based on monthly data for the four countries 
comprising the UK. In a running total on/off
  
switching, i.e. deaths stay high for 12 months 
followed by a switch back to low deaths, shows 
itself as a saw-tooth pattern. This 
saw-tooth pattern is evident in international 
trends (Jones, 2015a; b; c; d), more importantly, 
it occurs at very small areas and is replicated 
in emergency admissions, the gender ratio 
at birth, stillbirths, and certain congenital 
malformations (Jones, 2015c, 2016b, 2017a). 
On/off
  switching only arises in the presence of a 
recurring eff
 ector. Austerity is progressive 
and should therefore generate a roughly 
continuous trend. 
The on/off
  switching has not been previously 
reported, presumably because no one thought it 
was possible.
Austerity exceptions
Both the previous and more recent studies 
(Loopstra et al, 2016; Green et al, 2017; Hiam 
et al 2017a; b) focused on England and Wales. 
Is the same behaviour also observed in Scotland 
and Northern Ireland? As can be seen in 
Figure 1 both Northern Ireland and Scotland 
experienced an identical increase in deaths in 
2015 to that seen in England and Wales. Part of 
the increase is due to an infl
 uenza outbreak in 
late 2014, which has been proposed to exhibit 
an interaction between infl
 uenza and another 
presumed infectious agent (Jones, 2017b).
However, the key point is that health and 
social care are integrated in Northern Ireland 
and Scotland, and as far as can be discerned 
neither has experienced the extent of fi
 nancial 
austerity infl
 icted on adult social care in English 
local authorities (HM Treasury, 2016). Clearly 
something other than simple austerity is at work.
Repeated across Europe
The arrangement of health and social care 
and of funding is vastly diverse across Europe. 
However, signifi
 cant increases in deaths in 2015 
compared to 2014 were repeated across most 
of Europe. This is illustrated in Figure 2, where 
the change in deaths between 2014 and 2015 
across Europe and in UK local government areas 
is compared to the magnitude of an unexpected 
increase in deaths in January 2015 compared to 
December 2014. As can be seen, the magnitude

by a previous vaccination of the world population 
with an antigen mix that did not match 
with the mutated strains of infl
 uenza. 
These mutated strains unfortunately arose after 
the antigen mix had been determined by the 
World Health Organization (Jones, 2017b).
Hence, whatever happened in England and 
Wales in 2015 was repeated elsewhere and 
cannot be ascribed solely to local austerity.
Small area exceptions
While such high-level analysis at whole country 
level is useful, it has been repeatedly observed 
that the national picture is a composite picture 
derived from local small-area behaviours (Jones, 
2015b; d; 2016d; 2017a; b).
Both national and international trends 
in deaths show high variation, even in local 
government areas lying within proximity to 
one another. Figure 3 gives an example from 
Northern Ireland, where these exceptions go 
back many years. In addition, one area can 
show maximum deaths while another is 
experiencing a minimum. For example, the local 
government areas of Moyle and Carrickfergus are 
usually out-of-phase, i.e. deaths are high when 
deaths in other local government areas are low. 
Such phase shifts are not unknown to occur in 
infectious outbreaks (Lewnard and Townsend, 
2016). This out-of-phase behaviour leads to 
a considerable reduction in the ‘apparent’ 
magnitude of these events observed at national 
level (Jones, 2016b; 2017c).
The fundamental mechanism pre-dates 
austerity, shows high spatial granularity and 
out-of-phase or anti-phase behaviour. Such 
anti-phase behaviour is critical to understanding 
the events that ocurred in 2015. Local authority 
areas in the UK, and countries in Europe which 
experienced a large increase in deaths in 2014 
generally do not show any increase in 2015; 
however, neither did they show a reduction 
(Jones, 2017c).
of the change between 2014 and 2015 is largely 
predicated by the events leading to the spike 
increase in deaths in January 2015. Recall that 
in a running (moving) 12-month total, a spike 
increase generates a table-top shaped feature, 
i.e. the spike month enters the running total, 
stays there for 12 months and then exits 
the running total. 
It has been suggested that whatever led to 
the large spike in January 2015 seemingly 
arose from an interaction between a presumed 
infectious agent and a evidently innocuous 
infl
 uenza outbreak in late 2014 (Jones, 2017b). 
This interaction was seemingly magnifi

Single-year-of-age patterns
Hiam et al (2017b) also observed a highly 
unusual single-year-of-age profi
 le in the 
diff
 erence in the mortality rate between 2014 and 
2015. They were unable to off
 er an explanation 
as to how this unusual behaviour may have 
arisen from austerity. Such single-year-of-age 
profi
 les have been extensively documented 
to aff
 ect both deaths and medical admissions 
(Jones, 2014; Jones, 2015a).
Such single-year-of-age profi
 les are observed 
in a phenomenon called ‘original antigenic sin’, 
and arise when the immune system is primed by 
repeated exposure to multiple strains of the same 
infectious agent (Kim et al, 2009). This eff
 ect 
only occurs with infectious agents that elicit an 
immune response. An infectious aetiology is 
therefore a possible explanation.
No relationship 
with deprivation
Austerity would be expected to aff
 ect the most 
deprived areas. Figure 4 shows the increase in 
deaths in 2015 relative to 2014 in English local 
authorities, along with the deprivation score 
as measured by the Index of Multiple 
Deprivation (IMD). 
There are two key points from this fi
 gure:
• Austerity cannot explain the local authority 
areas which experienced a reduction in deaths 
in 2015
• There is no apparent relationship between 
the increase in deaths and local authority 
deprivation score. Indeed, deprivation 
only explains 1.2% of any trend, i.e. 
R2 = 0.0012.
We are left to conclude that relative 
deprivation played no role in the increase in 
2015, which is totally contrary to the proposed 
involvement of reduced social care funding.
A maximum increase was not restricted to 
2015 as demonstrated in Figure 3 for Northern 
Ireland, a maximum step-like increase in deaths 
was not restricted to 2015 (Jones, 2017e). 
Indeed, for English local authorities over the 
period 2001 to 2016, some 36% of 
local authorities experienced a maximum 
step-like increase in years other than 2015 
(Jones, 2017e). Like Figure 4 there is no 
demonstrable relationship between deprivation 
and the maximum step-like increase between 
2001 and 2016 (data not shown).
Increased morbidity
While austerity may have led to a small increase 
in deaths, alternate and stronger explanations 
have already been put forward. It has been 
suggested that the above behaviour arises 
from the very small-area spread of a                  
new type of infectious agent (Jones, 2013; 2015a; 
2016a; 2017e). The range of diagnoses so 
aff
 ected are indicative of the immune system 
as a primary target, leading to secondary 
infections and the exacerbation of existing 
conditions (Jones, 2013; 2016a; 2017a). A list 
of conditions aff
 ected during pregnancy, in 
  While austerity may 
have led to a small 
increase in deaths, 
alternate and stronger 
explanations have 
already been put 
forward

neonates and for congenital malformations has 
been published (Jones, 2017a), as has 
a list of high volume primary diagnoses 
associated with hospital admissions 
(Jones, 2013).
There is an alternative way to confi
 rm 
the presumed infectious/immune involvement. 
During national level outbreaks of this agent, 
hospital bed occupancy rises. There 
have been three large outbreaks centred 
around 2003, 2008 and 2014. Diagnoses 
associated with higher bed occupancy in 
these periods can be determined. This 
method is robust because occupied bed days in 
the surgical group of specialties has been 
declining since 2002, while the baseline 
for medical occupied beds has remained 
roughly contestant (Jones, 2017d). Hence any 
diagnosis which consistently increases across 
all three outbreaks is of interest.
A range of infectious and other diagnoses 
can be identifi
 ed and these are presented in 
Table 1. Due to a change in the ICD-10 diagnosis 
codes implemented in 2012, there are two 
measures of the percentage increase in occupied 
bed days, with ‘Increase 1’ referring to the two   
events before 2012 and ‘Increase 2’ referring 
to after 2012 (see Jones 2017a for more).
As can be seen from Table 1, occupied bed days 
across a range of infectious diagnoses do indeed 
increase. This increase is a mix of increased 
admissions and increased complexity (Jones, 
2013). There is no suggestion that the incidence 
of the various infections have increased per se; 
however, the severity of these infections has 
increased leading to increased hospitalisation. 
For this reason, several other diagnoses 
are included in Table 1 relating to immune 
function such as ICD D81, D84 and E85, some 
infl
 ammatory conditions such as G04, G06 and 
G08 and some common respiratory infections 
such as J00-J36.
Something keeps recurring leading to an 
increase in bed occupancy consistent with a 
proposed infectious/immune aetiology.
Conclusion
The real cause of the increased deaths may well 
be far more ominous than any increase arising 
from austerity. We need to ask the question as to 
whether policy-based evidence has contributed 
to limited awareness to these issues
(Beeknoo and Jones 2017)? BJHCM

KEY POINTS
n  Austerity is unlikely to be the primary reason for increased deaths in 2015
n  A similar rise in deaths also occurred in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland where health and 
social care are integrated, and have not suffered the degree of austerity imposed on adult social 
care in England
n  Similar large increases in 2015 were repeated across European countries
n  Across many countries deaths show on/off switching, and 2015 was an ‘on’ year
n  The patterns of death show sub-local authority diversity
n  Single-year-of-age patterns in mortality contradict general austerity, and have been reported 
elsewhere in both medical admissions and deaths
n  Hospital bed occupancy for certain conditions rose during this and previous events
