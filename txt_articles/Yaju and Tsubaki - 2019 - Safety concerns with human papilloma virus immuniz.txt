Abstract
Aim: To assess the safety of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines by using data from the “Nagoya City
Cervical Cancer Immunization Program Survey”.
Methods: Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated between HPV-vaccinated cases and un-vaccinated
controls. Age-stratified analyses were performed to evaluate the interaction between age and events.
Adjusted ORs were also estimated with multiple logistic regression models.
Results: In the 15–16-year-old group, the unadjusted ORs were significantly higher for symptoms of memory
impairment, dyscalculia, and involuntary movement. The age-adjusted multivariate analyses demonstrated that
the vaccinated cases were less likely than the unvaccinated controls to have experienced symptoms in almost all
symptoms, except for two symptoms such as involuntary movement and weakness. However, study period-
adjusted multivariate analyses demonstrated that the vaccinated cases were significantly more likely than un-
vaccinated controls to have experienced symptoms of memory impairment and involuntary movement.
Conclusions: Based on our analysis using data from the Nagoya City surveillance survey, a possible
association between HPV vaccination and distinct symptoms such as cognitive impairment or movement
disorders exists. A consistent causal relationship between HPV vaccination and these symptoms remains
uncertain. However, given the seriousness of symptoms, we believe that a more comprehensive and large-
scale study is essential to confirm the safety of HPV vaccination.
Key words: adverse events, human papilloma virus, surveillance, vaccine.
INTRODUCTION
Introduction of human papilloma virus
vaccination
Vaccines against the human papilloma virus (HPV) ini-
tially were introduced into public use with the 2006
European approval of the quadrivalent vaccine and the
subsequent 2007 approval of the bivalent vaccine. In
June, 2006, the Food and Drug Administration in the
USA
approved
the
quadrivalent
vaccine
and
the
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recom-
mended routine HPV vaccination for girls (Markowitz
et al., 2007). By August, 2014, 58 countries had intro-
duced the HPV vaccine into their national immuniza-
tion program (World Health Organization, 2014). As
of November, 2015, >63 million and 19 million per-
sons worldwide were estimated to have been vaccinated
with the quadrivalent and bivalent vaccine, respectively
(European Medicines Agency, 2015).
These vaccines also were approved for use in Japan in
October, 2009 for the bivalent vaccine and July, 2011
for the quadrivalent vaccine. After a HPV vaccine pro-
motion campaign, the vaccines were included in the Jap-
anese vaccination program for girls aged 12–16 years in

 April, 2013. Within 3 months of formal designation as
a routine vaccine, however, the Ministry of Health,
Labour and Welfare issued a nationwide notice to with-
hold recommending HPV vaccination in June, 2013
(Ministry of Health, Labour & Welfare, 2013). The
measures that were taken by the Japanese Government
triggered domestic and international controversy.
Case reports of adverse events
Kinoshita et al. (2014) reported 40 girls who were aged
11–17 years developed several symptoms after HPV
vaccination. The authors referred to these symptoms as
“complex regional pain syndrome” (CRPS) and “pos-
tural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome” (POTS), which
were interpreted as peripheral autonomic disorders.
Nishioka, Yokota, and Matsumoto (2014) proposed
the term “HPV vaccination-associated neuroimmuno-
pathic syndrome” (HANS) in order to refer to a variety
of symptoms that occur after HPV vaccination and cre-
ated preliminary diagnostic criteria in 2014 (Nishioka,
Yokota, & Matsumoto, 2014; Yokota, Kuroiwa, Naka-
mura, Nakajima, & Nishioka, 2015). Doctors and
researchers who have examined patients with post-HPV
vaccination symptoms highlighted characteristic symp-
toms. The reported serious adverse events included
diverse, complex, multisystem symptoms, such as: sei-
zures; impaired consciousness; systemic pain including
headache, myalgia, arthralgia, back pain, and other
pain; motor dysfunction such as paralysis, muscular
weakness,
exhaustion,
and
involuntary
movement;
autonomic symptoms including dizziness, hypotension,
tachycardia, and diarrhoea; endocrine disorders such as
menstrual abnormality and menorrhagia; severe photo-
phobia and hyperacusis; sleep disorders; and higher brain
dysfunction
and
cognitive
impairments
including
impaired memory, disorientation, and poor concentra-
tion (Kinoshita et al., 2014; Nishioka, Yokota, & Matsu-
moto, 2014; Yokota, Kuroiwa, Nakamura, Nakajima,
& Nishioka, 2014). Many of these symptoms overlap
with CRPS, POTS, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and
fibromyalgia syndrome. Furthermore, in some cases,
these symptoms impaired learning ability and resulted in
extreme fatigue and decreased motivation, having a neg-
ative impact on everyday life (Kinoshita et al., 2014).
Blitshteyn (2014) from the USA reported six patients
who developed POTS following HPV vaccination.
Brinth, Theibel, Pors, and Mehlsen (2015) from Den-
mark presented 53 patients with suspected side-effects
to the quadrivalent HPV vaccine and reported that all
the patients had symptoms that were consistent with
pronounced autonomic dysfunction.
In recent years, Ozawa, Hineno, Kinoshita, Ishihara,
and Ikeda (2017) described a case series of Japanese
girls who were affected by suspected HPV vaccine-
related symptoms. They concluded that HPV vaccina-
tion was related to the transiently high prevalence of
multiple symptoms, including CRPS and autonomic and
cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, Chandler et al.
(2017) published a novel approach to case series identi-
fication for thorough signal evaluation by using data-
driven exploratory cluster analysis of HPV vaccine
adverse event reports. They reported that the propor-
tional reporting ratio of the combination of adverse
events terms (headache and dizziness with either syn-
cope or fatigue), comparing HPV vaccine reports with
non-HPV vaccine reports was 2.44 (95% confidence
interval [CI]: 2.07–2.89) based on adverse events cluster
analysis using VigiBase, the World Health Organiza-
tion’s international database of suspected adverse drug
reactions. Their analysis also revealed a large number of
reports with a pattern of adverse events, including head-
ache, dizziness, fatigue, and syncope and that these
symptoms overlapped those that were reported in cases
from the safety signals (POTS, CRPS, and CFS) in previ-
ous studies.
Epidemiological studies
Souayah et al. (2011), using data from the United States
Vaccine
Adverse
Event
Reporting
System
during
2006–2009, identified 69 reports of Guillain-Barré syn-
drome (GBS) after quadrivalent HPV vaccination and
estimated that the weekly reporting rate of post-
quadrivalent HPV vaccine GBS within the first 6 weeks
(6.6 cases per 10 million) was higher than that of the
general population (0.65–2.57 cases per 10 million). A
large Scandinavian register-based cohort study compar-
ing almost 300,000 cases (received at least one dose of
the quadrivalent HPV vaccine) and 700,000 controls
found increased risk ratios (RRs) for three autoimmune
manifestations: Behçet’s syndrome, Raynaud’s disease,
and type 1 diabetes (Arnheim-Dahlström, Pasternak,
Svanström, Sparén, & Hviid, 2013).
A large-scale, self-completed mail survey of adverse
events
experienced
in
70,000
young
women,
the
“Nagoya City Cervical Cancer Immunization Program
Survey” (hereafter, referred to as “the Nagoya Sur-
vey”), was conducted in September, 2015. Nagoya City
reported the totalized summary and presented the com-
plete questionnaire survey data to the public. At pre-
sent, these summary and complete data are disclosed
and available at the website of Nagoya City (Health

 and Welfare Bureau, Nagoya City, 2016). Suzuki and
Hosono (2018) reported that none of the reported
symptoms were significantly associated with increased
odds of them occurring after the administration of the
HPV vaccine based on the results of the Nagoya Survey.
The safety issue of the HPV vaccine is still a contro-
versy. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of
HPV vaccines by using data from the Nagoya Survey.
Current status and issues
Although numerous case reports have suggested that
HPV vaccines can cause serious side-effects, as well as a
number of safety signals that have emerged with HPV
vaccination in epidemiological studies, these findings do
not provide consistent evidence for a causal link.
Despite the existence of independently clustered reports
and
safety
signals,
on
November
26,
2015,
the
European Medicines Agency (2015) released a 40 page
assessment report on the safety of HPV vaccines, which
concluded that there was no evidence of an association
between HPV vaccines and CRPS or POTS, based on
the review carried out by the European Medicines
Agency’s
Pharmacovigilance
Risk
Assessment
Committee.
In Japan, after the suspension of the government’s
recommendation for HPV vaccination in June, 2013,
the HPV vaccination rate in the target population
plunged from 80% at its peak to <1% (as of 2015,
0.1% in 12 year olds; 0.7% in 13 year olds) (Ministry
of Health, Labour & Welfare, 2016a). As of February,
2016, ~3.39 million teenage girls have been vaccinated in
Japan (Ministry of Health, Labour & Welfare, 2016b).
METHODS
Data source and variable selection for the
analyses
The data source for this investigation was the dataset of
the Nagoya Survey (Health & Welfare Bureau, Nagoya
City, 2016). According to Nagoya City, the study popu-
lation consisted of women who were aged 15–21 years
who were residents of Nagoya City. The questionnaire
survey period was from September to November, 2015
and the response rate was 43.3%. The original data of
the 275 questions from the 30,793 respondents are dis-
closed as a set of PDF files on the website of Nagoya
City. Professor Okumura of Mie University voluntarily
converted
the
PDFs
into
comma-separated
values
(CSVs) and uploaded them onto his personal website
(Okumura, 2018). The authors downloaded the CSV
data from his website and selected eight items for the
analyses: age, individual HPV vaccine administration,
the brand name of the HPV vaccine that was adminis-
tered, time of the first HPV vaccination, the 24 symp-
toms
experienced
during
the
questionnaire
survey
period, onset time of each symptom, currently having
symptoms and frequency (“always” or “sometimes”),
and consultation with a doctor for the symptom(s). The
authors verified the accuracy of the data and confirmed
that it was reliable for analysis.
Determining the vaccinated cases and the
unvaccinated controls
By using binary answers (“yes”/”no”) for the question
on individual HPV vaccine administration, the respon-
dents were categorized into the “vaccinated case” group
or the ”unvaccinated control” group. The respondents
who checked both choices or did not answer the ques-
tion were included in the “unclear” group. However,
after examination of the unclear group, some respon-
dents in this group were reclassified into the vaccinated
case group because they clearly answered the time of
HPV vaccination or because they responded “unclear”
for two or three of the three questions about the correct
time of vaccination for the three doses of HPV vaccine.
Determining the events and elapsed time
period from the first vaccination to symptom
onset
This study constructed 24 event variables for the ana-
lyses that corresponded to the 24 symptoms that were
investigated in the survey by editing the binary answers
of “yes” or “no” for the question on a certain symptom
that was experienced during the questionnaire survey
period. For the answers of “yes,” it was judged that the
respondent experienced the symptom, while for the
answers of “no,” it was judged that she did not experi-
ence it. If the respondent checked both answers or did
not check either answer, it was judged that the respon-
dent’s event was “uncertain.” However, some events
were changed from “uncertain” to “experienced” when
the experiences could be confirmed because the onset
time of the symptom, currently experiencing the symp-
tom, or consultation with a doctor for symptom(s) was
clearly described.
Events were excluded in the vaccinated case group in
which the first HPV vaccination was administered after
the onset time of the symptom because the causes are
antecedent
to
the
consequences.
Therefore,
these

 records were treated as vaccinated cases with no symp-
tom. Consequently, the questionnaire survey period was
defined differently between the vaccinated cases and the
unvaccinated controls: the questionnaire survey period
for the vaccinated cases was restricted to the post-
vaccination period, while the period for the unvaccinated
controls was the complete period of the questionnaire
survey period (from 12 years of age to the participant’s
age at September, 2015). Hereafter, the term “study
period” is used instead of the term “questionnaire survey
period” to refer to the periods that are common between
the vaccinated cases and the unvaccinated controls in
terms of the “risk period.” The intervals between the
time of the first HPV vaccination and the onset time of
the symptom in each vaccinated case was calculated for
the analyses.
Statistical analyses
The data were summarized with descriptive statistics as
the mean with standard deviation (SD) and the median
with the interquartile range and the crude incidence
odds were compared for the events between the vacci-
nated and the unvaccinated groups by unadjusted odds
ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs.
Possible associations between HPV vaccination and
each symptom were explored by fitting two multiple
logistic regression models (models 1 and 2) with differ-
ent covariates to the data to estimate the adjusted ORs
with 95% CIs. The covariates that were used in model
1 were “vaccination” and “age” and those in model
2 were “vaccination” and “study period.” Furthermore,
to explore the interaction effect of vaccination and
study period on symptom experience, a multiple logistic
regression was used in model 3. The covariates that
were used in model 3 were “vaccination,” “study
period,” and the interaction covariate between vaccina-
tion and study period. A logistic regression also was
used to test for an interaction between vaccination and
age and for an interaction between vaccination and
study period. The results of two-sided testing was
shown if necessary with P-values, without adjusting for
multiplicity. All the analyses were conducted by using R
version 3.2.2 (R Core Team, 2015).
Of the 30,279 women whose data on HPV vaccina-
tion were available, the data on age were available for
29,846 women. These data were included in multiple
logistic regression model 1 and the age-stratified ana-
lyses. Of these 29,846 women, the time of the first vac-
cination was available for 26,665 women, who were
included in multiple logistic regression models 2 and 3.
The proportion of vaccinated cases varied according
to age due to the change in Japanese public health pol-
icy regarding HPV vaccination. Thus, the impact of a
healthy vaccine effect bias would have varied by age.
The healthy vaccine effect is a form of selection bias in
which healthier persons might be more likely to be vac-
cinated, leading to a subsequent decrease in the risk of
adverse events after vaccination; this bias is more likely
to occur the higher the vaccination rate (Fine & Chen,
1992; Shrank, Patrick, & Brookhart, 2011). Therefore,
when comparing vaccinated cases with unvaccinated
controls in the 17–21 year old group, in which the pro-
portion of vaccinated women was >70%, it was consid-
ered that the likelihood of a healthy vaccine effect bias
was high. In contrast, the proportions of vaccinated
women in the 15- and 16 year old groups were 15%
and 50%, respectively; thus, it was assumed that the
risk of the healthy vaccine effect bias was relatively low
in these age groups. Additionally, the respondents in the
15–16 year old group had reached the age of the target
population for HPV vaccination after the suspension of
the government recommendation. Therefore, it was
hypothesized that almost all the respondents in this age
group did not receive HPV vaccination simply because
they did not want to be vaccinated and not because of
health issues, leading to the low vaccination rate (15%).
Almost all the unvaccinated controls in this age group
were expected to be averagely healthy women. Further-
more, most women in the vaccinated case group, irre-
spective of age, were generally considered to be healthy
women because they were healthy vaccine users. In
order to minimize the impact of healthy user bias, age-
stratified analyses (15-, 16-, 15–16-, and 17–21 year
old groups) were carried out and the vaccinated cases in
all age groups (15–21 year old group) were compared
with the unvaccinated controls in the 15–16 year old
group.
This is an analytical study using data from open data
sources. For this type of study, formal consent is not
required.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the study population
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of all the partici-
pants involved in the present study. Overall, 30,793
women were included, comprising 21,034 vaccinated
cases, 9245 unvaccinated controls (subtotal: 30,279),
and 514 women for whom their vaccination status was
unclear.

 First, except for the 16 year old group, there was a
significant imbalance in the numbers of vaccinated and
unvaccinated women. When the proportions of the vac-
cinated women were compared stratified by age, the
proportion in the 15 year old group (14.6%) was far
less than that of the 16 year old group (50.1%) and the
17–21 year old group (>70%). Second, there were
threefold more women who had been administered the
bivalent HPV vaccine than the quadrivalent HPV vac-
cine. Third, the unvaccinated controls tended to be
younger than the vaccinated cases. The mean (SD) age
was 18.6 (1.7) years for the vaccinated cases and 16.5
(1.8) years for the unvaccinated controls. Finally, the
mean study period for the vaccinated cases (3.9 years)
was 0.6 years shorter than that of the unvaccinated con-
trols (4.5 years).

 them were statistically significant. In contrast, the multi-
variate analysis with the multiple logistic regression in
model 1 (adjusted for age) demonstrated that the ORs
for the symptoms of involuntary movement and weak-
ness were ~1 (involuntary movement: OR: 1.05 [95%
CI: 0.76–1.48] and weakness: OR: 1.05 [95% CI:
0.83–1.34]). Apart from these two symptoms, the other
symptoms demonstrated ORs of <1 and most of them
were statistically significant. These results suggest that
there was no association between HPV vaccination and
the symptoms.
When considering these age-adjusted results, two key
assumptions
of
multiple
linear
regression
model
1 should be noted; that is, linearity and similarity
(no interaction among the covariates). First, logistic
regression model 1 assumes linearity of the independent
variables and log odds of event occurrence. There were,
however, no linear or monotone associations between
age and the events across different symptoms in the
total cohort. That is, the event rates did not show a ten-
dency to increase or decrease relative to an increase of
age. Furthermore, a substantial difference was observed
between the event rates in the older age groups
(e.g. ≥17 years or ≥18 years) and those in the younger
age groups for several symptoms. For example, the
event rates in the 15–16 year old group (or 15–17 year
old group) were lower than those in the ≥17 year old
group (or ≥18 year old group). A representative exam-
ple of age-stratified event rates in which the event rates
in the 15–16 year old group were substantially lower

 than those in the ≥17 year old group is shown in
Figure 1. These findings suggest that not only with non-
linearity, but the population characteristics of the youn-
ger age groups, are substantially different from those of
the older age groups related to discontinuity of the
event rates.
Second, it should be noted that an age-adjusted rate
is a method to make fairer comparisons between groups
with different age distributions. This method assumes
that the effect of age on an event rate is similar between
groups or shows no significant interaction among the
covariates. However, this similarity was not observed
between the vaccinated cases and the unvaccinated con-
trols. For instance, a weak linear trend between age and
event rates was observed only in the unvaccinated con-
trols for some symptoms and was not observed in the
vaccinated cases across different symptoms. Examples
of each group were shown by using the data on memory
impairment. Whereas, a linear trend is not observed in
the vaccinated cases, it was observed in the unvacci-
nated controls (Figs 2 and 3), suggesting that the effect
of age on the event rates is not similar between the two
groups. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 1, the event
rates in the 15–16 year old group were substantially
lower than those in the ≥17 year old group (Fig. 3).
Given these findings, it appeared that multiple logistic
regression model 1, with age as a covariate, was not
appropriate for the data analysis in the present study. In
fact, the test for the interaction between vaccination
and age was statistically significant, except for distinct
symptoms: menorrhagia (P = 0.29), a cold sensation in
the legs (P = 0.06), skin roughness (P = 0.89), walking
disability
(P = 0.06),
using
a
cane
or
wheelchair
(P = 0.26), and weakness (P = 0.06) (Table 2). These
results further support that model 1, with age as the
covariate, was not appropriate.
Unadjusted and study period-adjusted odds
ratios in all age groups
From the above-mentioned findings, it was considered
that an alternative covariate should be used in place of
age for the logistic regression models. Therefore, “study
period”-adjusted
ORs
were
estimated
in
model
2. Table 3 shows the study period-adjusted ORs for all
24 symptoms among 26,665 women. The vaccinated
cases were more likely than the unvaccinated controls
to have experienced symptoms of memory impairment

 (OR: 1.23 [95% CI: 1.03–1.47]), dyscalculia (OR: 1.13
[95% CI: 0.83–1.54]), involuntary movement (OR:
1.53 [95% CI: 1.11–2.13]), walking disability (OR:
1.68 [95% CI: 0.98–3.00]), a sudden attack of muscle
weakness (OR: 1.18 [95% CI: 0.92–1.53]), and weak-
ness (OR: 1.21 [95% CI: 0.97–1.52]). Among these
symptoms, the ORs of memory impairment and invol-
untary movement were statistically significant, suggest-
ing
that
there
is
an
association
between
HPV
vaccination and these symptoms. The test for the inter-
action between vaccination and the study period was
statistically
significant
for
only
seven
symptoms
(Table 3).
However, it should be noted that linearity was
observed between event rates and the study period
within only some symptoms. An example of a vacci-
nated case group was shown by using the data on mem-
ory impairment, in which a linear trend was not
observed (Fig. 4). The study period-stratified event rates
in the unvaccinated controls were the same as the age-
stratified event rates in the unvaccinated controls, as
shown in Figure 3. Therefore, it is suggested that the
effect of the study period on event rates is not similar
between the two groups.
These findings suggest that logistic regression model
2, with the study period as the covariate, does not
always
fit
the
data
for
the
analyses
and
other
approaches should be designed. Therefore, the results of
both model 1 (age-adjusted) and model 2 (study period-
adjusted) are considered as preliminary data.

 Additionally, the study-period adjusted ORs were
estimated in model 3. By fitting multiple logistic regres-
sion model 3, of the seven symptoms in which the test
for an interaction between vaccination and the study
period was statistically significant, four symptoms dem-
onstrated ORs that were >1 with statistical significance.
They were the symptoms of memory impairment (OR:
3.59 [95% CI: 2.05–6.25]), dyscalculia (OR: 4.37
[95% CI: 1.63–11.61]), dyslexia that was characterized
by a difficulty in reading and writing Chinese characters
(hereinafter, referred to as “dyslexia”) (OR: 2.82 [95%
CI: 1.46–5.39]), and a sudden attack of muscle weak-
ness (OR; 3.16 [95% CI: 1.42–6.96]), suggesting that
there is an association between HPV vaccination and
these symptoms (Table 4).
Unadjusted odds ratios provided by age-
stratified analyses (15-, 16-, 15–16-, and
17–21 year old groups)
The unadjusted ORs for the age-stratified analyses of all
24 symptoms among the 29,846 women are shown in
Table 5. In the 15 year old group, the ORs were signifi-
cantly higher for the symptoms of memory impairment
(OR: 2.23 [95% CI: 1.37–3.63]), dyscalculia (OR: 2.30
[95% CI: 1.01–5.24]), and dyslexia (OR: 1.75 [95%
CI: 1.01–3.03]). In the 15–16 year old group, the ORs
were significantly higher for the symptoms of memory
impairment (OR: 1.70 [95% CI: 1.24–2.33]), dyscalcu-
lia (OR: 1.77 [95% CI: 1.00–3.13]), and involuntary
movement (OR: 1.86 [95% CI: 1.07–3.23]). In contrast,
a subgroup analysis of the 17–21 year old group
demonstrated the ORs of all symptoms were <1 and
most were statistically significant.
In summary, although an association between
HPV vaccination and symptoms was not observed in
the population with a high healthy vaccine effect
bias (e.g. 17–21 year old group), an association
between HPV vaccination and some characteristic
symptoms was observed in those populations with a
low healthy vaccine effect bias (e.g. 15-, 16-, and
15–16 year old groups). These findings suggest that
HPV vaccination could lead to significant side-
effects, such as memory impairment, dyscalculia,
and involuntary movement.
Unadjusted odds ratios provided by analyses
comparing the vaccinated cases in all age
groups with the unvaccinated controls in the
15–16 year old group
The unadjusted ORs of the events for all 24 symptoms
among 26,517 women, comparing the vaccinated cases
(20,748 women) in all age groups with the unvaccinated
controls (5769 women) in the 15–16 year old group,
are shown in Table 6. The ORs were significantly higher
for the symptoms of memory impairment (OR: 1.80
[95% CI: 1.43–2.25]), dyscalculia (OR: 1.80 [95% CI:
1.19–2.73]), dyslexia (OR: 1.36 [95% CI: 1.06–1.73]),
involuntary
movement
(OR:
1.82
[95%
CI:
1.21–2.73]), walking disability (OR: 2.02 [95% CI:
1.01–4.06]), and a sudden attack of muscle weakness
(OR: 1.39 [95% CI: 1.03–1.88]).
Elapsed time period from the first vaccination
to symptom onset
The mean and median number of months between the
time of the first HPV vaccination and the onset time of
the symptoms are presented in Table 7. The elapsed
time period from the first vaccination to symptom onset
ranged from 0 to 114 months. The median number of
months from the first vaccination to symptom onset for
the cognitive disorders was 24.0 (memory impairment),
25.0 (dyscalculia), and 30.0 (dyslexia). The median
number of months for movement disorders was 20.5
(involuntary movement), 14.0 (walking disability), 17.0
(using a cane or wheelchair), 19.5 (a sudden attack of
muscle weakness), and 17.0 (weakness). The median
number of months for the cognitive disorders was
~10 months
longer
than
those
for
the
movement
disorders.

 DISCUSSION
Adverse events following human papilloma
virus vaccination
Healthy user bias, another form of selection
bias, and the effect of an imbalance in the study
period
The unadjusted ORs were <1 for almost all the symp-
toms that were common in the adolescents, such as
menstrual abnormality, lassitude, and dizziness, sug-
gesting that HPV vaccination can reduce the risk of
symptoms. However, two types of hypotheses concern-
ing these relatively low ORs can be made. First, one
possible explanation for these findings is the healthy
vaccine effect bias (Fine & Chen, 1992; Shrank, Patrick,
& Brookhart, 2011). These common symptoms are
more prone to the healthy vaccine effect. For instance,
young women in better health might be more likely to
be vaccinated and women in worse health might be less
likely to receive HPV vaccination. Therefore, events in
the vaccinated group might be underestimated, whereas
those in the unvaccinated group might be overesti-
mated. Consequently, when comparing the vaccinated
cases with the unvaccinated controls, the ORs might be
underestimated. As mentioned above in the section of
statistical analyses, the healthy vaccine effect bias is
more likely to occur the higher the vaccination rate. In
fact, the ORs were <1 for all symptoms in the
17–21 year old group and most were statistically signifi-
cant. That is, the influence of the healthy vaccine effect

 bias was remarkably observed in the analyses of the
17–21 year old group with high vaccination cover-
age (>70%).
Second, a focus on the difference in the study period
between the vaccinated cases and the unvaccinated con-
trols should be considered. As described in the Methods
section, the study period was restricted for the vacci-
nated cases to the post-vaccination period (range:
0–6 years) and the study period was defined for the
unvaccinated controls as the complete time period of
the questionnaire survey (from 12 years of age to the
participant’s age at September, 2015; range: 3–9 years).
Consequently, the mean study period for the vaccinated
cases was shorter than that for the unvaccinated con-
trols. As a result of this difference, the event rates of the
vaccinated cases were expected to be relatively underes-
timated,
compared
to
those
of
the
unvaccinated
controls.
Multivariate analysis: Age-adjustment and study
period adjustment
In contrast to the common symptoms in adolescents,
the unadjusted ORs were >1 for distinct symptoms,
including memory impairment, involuntary movement,
walking disability, a sudden attack of muscle weakness,
and weakness (Tables 2 and 3). Moreover, in the multi-
variate analysis, the study period-adjusted ORs for
memory impairment, dyscalculia, involuntary move-
ment, walking disability, a sudden attack of muscle
weakness, and weakness were >1 and the ORs for mem-
ory impairment and involuntary movement were statis-
tically significant, although they were not adjusted for
multiplicity (Table 3). These findings are consistent with
those of Yokota et al. (2015), who proposed the
assumption that the HPV vaccine might develop hypo-
thalamic damage, resulting in the onset of cognitive
impairment or movement disorders.

 In general, epidemiological research uses age adjust-
ment to reduce the effect of having older participants in
one group, compared to another group that has youn-
ger participants. However, an alternative covariate
“study period” (defined by the post-vaccination period
for the vaccinated cases and the complete period of the
questionnaire survey period for the unvaccinated con-
trols) was considered, apart from age.
When conducting a logistic regression analysis in the
model without an interaction, there was a need to con-
firm which of the following assumptions were made in
the analysis of the data from the study: (i) the covariate
(age or study period) can be a confounder: (ii) the distri-
bution of the covariate differs between the two groups
(vaccinated cases and unvaccinated controls); (iii) the
linearity between the covariate and events and similarity
between the vaccinated cases and the unvaccinated con-
trols are observed; and (iv) the test for an interaction
between vaccination and the covariate is not statistically
significant.
As for age adjustment, the data from the present
study met only assumption (ii). With respect to a
confounder (assumption (i)), the data did not meet the
assumption. That is because, considering the partici-
pants in the present study are young women ranging in
age from 15 to 21 years, it is unnatural that the risk of
the disease is naturally higher in the older participants,
compared to the younger ones, in terms of the target
symptoms in the study. As mentioned above in the
Results section, there was neither a linear association
between age and the event rates nor a similar effect of
age on an event between the vaccinated cases and the
unvaccinated controls. Furthermore, the test for the
interaction between vaccination and age was statisti-
cally significant for almost all of the symptoms. These
results supported the concept that the logistic regression
model with age as the only covariate did not fit the data
of this study. This is thought to explain why almost all
the symptoms demonstrated ORs of <1 and most of
them were statistically significant.
In contrast, the covariate “study period” can be a
confounder because it refers to the risk period in which
the event (the experience of symptom) occurs. That is,
the

period,

 participants are to have experienced symptoms. The dis-
tribution of the study period differed between the vacci-
nated cases and the unvaccinated controls. There was
no linear association between the study period and
event rates and no similar effect of the study period on
an event between the vaccinated cases and the unvacci-
nated controls. The test for an interaction between vac-
cination and the study period was not statistically
significant, except for seven symptoms (Table 3). As
above-mentioned, the logistic regression model with the
study period as a covariate did not always fit the data
from the present study. However, it can at least be
stated that, in the case of the logistic regression, it
appears more reasonable to assume that the study
period is more appropriate than age as a covariate.
Suzuki and Hosono (2018) reported the age-adjusted
ORs of the association of vaccination and the occur-
rence of symptoms as primary outcomes, in which
almost all the symptoms demonstrated ORs of < 1 and
most of them were statistically significant. These results
should be interpreted with caution. The reason is as fol-
lows. They described that age confounded the associa-
tion
between
HPV
vaccination
and
the
reported
symptoms. Therefore, they decided all the analyses
should be age-adjusted, although they did not provide
any details of the methods, such as considering and
examining the confounders or exploring the data
distribution.
As a supplementary analysis, the possible associations
between HPV vaccination and each symptom were
explored by using standardization with the reference
group of the whole participants to estimate the age-
standardized RR with 95% CIs (Sato, 1994). Table 8
summarizes the age-standardized RRs for all 24 symp-
toms among 29,846 women. All the symptoms demon-
strated RRs of <1 and most of them were statistically
significant. These findings raise the possibility that there
was no association between HPV vaccination and the

 symptoms (Table 8). In this regard, however, it is noted
that the RR varied and did not show the same direction
across the age strata for almost all the symptoms; hence,
standardization does not fit the data from the present
study.
Age-stratified analysis considering the effect of
the healthy user
Most of the vaccinated women in all age groups
generally were considered to be healthy women because
they were healthy vaccine users. The women in the
15–16 year old group had reached the age of the target
population for HPV vaccination after suspension of the
government recommendation. Thus, almost all the
women in this age group were expected to be unvacci-
nated simply because they did not want to be vacci-
nated,
not
because
of
health
issues.
Given
this
information, it was assumed that the unvaccinated con-
trols in the 15–16 year old group were generally
healthy. In order to minimize the impact of the healthy
user bias, the vaccinated cases in all age groups were
compared
with
the
unvaccinated
controls
in
the
15–16 year old group. The ORs were significantly
higher for the symptoms of memory impairment, dys-
calculia, dyslexia, involuntary movement, walking dis-
ability, and a sudden attack of muscle weakness. These
findings suggested that HPV vaccination might cause
significant health problems, which can impair learning
and have a negative impact on daily life.
Limitations of the present study and
suggestions for further research
The validity of the findings from the questionnaire sur-
veys is dependent on adequate response rates. The
response rate of the Nagoya Survey was moderate, at
43% (30,793/71,177); thus, the findings of the present
study should be considered in light of this limitation.
Moreover, another potential limitation of the present
study is that differential misreporting or misclassifica-
tion bias, as well as the characteristic symptom develop-
ment in a multilayered manner, were not evaluated.
Further large-scale and well-designed (careful consid-
eration should be given to the characteristics of post-
HPV vaccination symptoms) cohort studies are war-
ranted to confirm the causal relationship between HPV
vaccination and the occurrence of possible adverse
events,
as
suggested
by
the
current
exploratory
analyses.
CONCLUSION
Based on this analysis using data from the Nagoya Sur-
vey, a possible association between HPV vaccination
and distinct symptoms, such as cognitive impairment or
movement disorders, exists. A consistent causal rela-
tionship between HPV vaccination and these symptoms
remains uncertain. However, given the seriousness of
the symptoms, the authors believe that a more compre-
hensive and large-scale study is essential to confirm the
safety of HPV vaccination.
