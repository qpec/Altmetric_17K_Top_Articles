Abstract
BACKGROUND—In SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), a systolic blood 
pressure (SBP) goal of <120 mm Hg resulted in lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk 
compared with an SBP goal of <140 mm Hg.
OBJECTIVES—The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence, number, and 
characteristics of U.S. adults meeting SPRINT eligibility criteria and determine the broader 
population to whom SPRINT could be generalized.
METHODS—We conducted a cross-sectional, population-based study using data from the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2007 to 2012. The SPRINT inclusion criteria 
were age ≥50 years, SBP 130 to 180 mm Hg depending on the number of antihypertensive 
medication classes being taken, and high CVD risk (history of coronary heart disease, estimated 
glomerular filtration rate of 20 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m2, 10-year CVD risk ≥15%, or age ≥75 years). 
Exclusion criteria were diabetes, history of stroke, >1 g in 24 h of proteinuria daily, heart failure, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate <20 ml/min/1.73 m2, or receiving dialysis. Treated 
hypertension was defined by self-reported use of medication to lower blood pressure with ≥1 class 
of antihypertensive medication identified through a pill bottle review.
RESULTS—Overall, 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.0% to 8.3%) or 16.8 million (95% 
CI: 15.7 to 17.8 million) U.S. adults, and 16.7% (95% CI: 15.2% to 18.3%) or 8.2 million (95% 
CI: 7.6 to 8.8 million) adults with treated hypertension met the SPRINT eligibility criteria. Among 
both the overall U.S. population and adults with treated hypertension, the percentage meeting 
SPRINT eligibility criteria increased with older age, was higher among males than females, and 
was higher among non-Hispanic whites compared with non-Hispanic blacks or Hispanics. Of U.S.

 adults eligible for SPRINT, 51.0% (95% CI: 47.8% to 54.1%) or 8.6 million (95% CI: 8.0 to 9.1 
million) were not treated for hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS—A substantial percentage of U.S. adults meet the eligibility criteria for 
SPRINT.

The SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) tested whether lowering systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) to <120 mm Hg versus <140 mm Hg results in reduced cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) risk (1). Between 2010 and 2013, SPRINT enrolled 9,361 adults age ≥50 
years who had SBP 130 to 180 mm Hg and were at high risk for CVD. Individuals were not 
eligible if they had diabetes, had a history of stroke, had >1 g in 24 h of proteinuria, had 
heart failure, were on dialysis, or had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <20 
ml/min/1.73 m2 (1). On September 11, 2015, the National Institutes of Health issued a press 
release stating that SPRINT was being stopped early due to an approximately 30% relative 
risk reduction in CVD events and 25% relative risk reduction in mortality among 
participants randomized to the SBP goal <120 mm Hg compared with the SBP goal <140 
mm Hg (2).
SPRINT enrolled a diverse population, and therefore, its results may be relevant to a large 
percentage of U.S. adults (1). Characterizing U.S. adults who are potentially eligible for 
antihypertensive treatment initiation or intensification to achieve an SBP <120 mm Hg may 
help the health care and scientific community understand the relevance and effect of the 
findings from SPRINT. We, therefore, estimated the prevalence, number, and characteristics 
of U.S. adults who meet the SPRINT eligibility criteria and may be candidates for an SBP 
goal of <120 mm Hg. As clinicians often need to generalize results beyond the population 
examined in a clinical trial, we also estimated the size of the broader sample of U.S. adults 
with SBP ≥120 mm Hg who are free of SPRINT exclusion criteria.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is conducted by the 
National Center for Health Statistics. The data and information on the design and conduct of 
NHANES are available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (3). 
NHANES uses a multistage stratified probability sampling approach to identify potential 
participants. Multiple cycles can be pooled together to provide stable estimates in population 
subgroups (4). We pooled data from the 2007 to 2008, 2009 to 2010, and 2011 to 2012 
NHANES cycles for the current analyses. Analyses were restricted to participants who were 
≥20 years of age and completed a medical evaluation at the NHANES mobile examination 
center (n = 17,085). We excluded participants who did not have SBP and diastolic blood 
pressure (DBP) measurements taken during their NHANES medical evaluation (n = 803) or 
were missing self-reported information on the use of prescription antihypertensive 
medication (n = 22), leaving 16,260 participants in the current analyses. The National Center

 for Health Statistics institutional review board approved each NHANES cycle, and all 
participants provided written informed consent.
DATA COLLECTION
Data for each NHANES cycle were collected through participant interviews and a medical 
evaluation. Data collected during the interview included age; race/ethnicity; sex; smoking 
status; a prior diagnosis of comorbid conditions including hypertension, diabetes, heart 
failure, myocardial infarction, angina, coronary heart disease (CHD), and stroke; receipt of 
dialysis in the past 12 months; and use of antihypertensive and diabetes medication.
During the NHANES medical evaluation, height and weight were measured and used to 
calculate body mass index. Serum glucose, serum creatinine, and hemoglobin A1c were 
measured from a blood sample collected during the study visit. Diabetes mellitus was 
defined by a prior diagnosis, excluding during pregnancy, with concurrent use of insulin or 
oral hypoglycemic medication, or by a fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dl, nonfasting glucose ≥200 
mg/dl, or a hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%. eGFR was calculated using the Modification of Diet in 
Renal Disease equation (5). Urine albumin and creatinine were measured using random spot 
urine samples.
BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT
Blood pressure was measured by a trained physician using a mercury sphygmomanometer 
and an appropriately sized cuff. Readings were obtained after 5 min of seated rest. The mean 
of 3 blood pressure measurements obtained at 1-min intervals during the medical evaluation 
was used to define SBP and DBP.
PILL BOTTLE REVIEW
Participants were asked to bring all prescription medications taken in the past 2 weeks to the 
NHANES medical evaluation. Pill bottles were reviewed, and medication names were 
recorded and coded into medication classes based on their generic equivalents. Single-pill 
combinations were classified into their component classes. We coded the following 
antihypertensive medication classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), 
alpha blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-
blockers, calcium-channel blockers, central-acting agents, loop diuretic agents, potassium-
sparing diuretic agents (not including spironolactone and eplerenone), thiazide diuretic 
agents, renin inhibitors, and direct vasodilators.
SPRINT ELIGIBILITY
Potential eligibility for SPRINT was determined using a multistep algorithm (Figure 1). The 
population was restricted based on age (≥50 years), SBP (130 to 180 mm Hg on 0 or 1 
antihypertensive medication class, 130 to 170 mm Hg on up to 2 classes, 130 to 160 mm Hg 
on up to 3 classes, and 130 to 150 mm Hg on up to 4 classes), and the presence of 1 or more 
high CVD risk conditions. High CVD risk conditions included history of CHD (defined in 
NHANES as self-report of a prior diagnosis of myocardial infarction, angina, or CHD), 
eGFR of 20 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m2, 10-year risk for CVD ≥15% calculated using the 
Framingham risk score for general clinical practice (6), and age ≥75 years. Participants were

 not eligible if they had any of the following exclusion criteria: diabetes, a history of stroke, 
>1 g in 24 h of proteinuria, heart failure, on dialysis, or an eGFR <20 ml/min/1.73 m2.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Among the overall population and participants with and without treated hypertension, we 
calculated the percent and number of U.S. adults meeting each sequential SPRINT eligibility 
criterion (Figure 1). Percentages were calculated overall and within subgroups defined by 
age (50 to 59, 60 to 74, and ≥75 years), sex (male and female), race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic 
white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic), and SBP (130 to 139 and ≥140 mm Hg). Treated 
hypertension was defined by self-reported use of medication to lower BP with 1 or more 
classes of antihypertensive medication identified through the pill bottle review. The 
percentages were also calculated for participants with and without hypertension, defined by 
self-reported use of antihypertensive medication or SBP/DBP ≥140/90 mm Hg. For the 
overall population and those with treated hypertension, we also calculated the percentage 
and number of U.S. adults meeting SPRINT eligibility criteria in subgroups defined by: 1) 
age ≥50 years; 2) SBP ≥130 mm Hg; 3) any high CVD risk condition; 4) age ≥50 years and 
SBP ≥130 mm Hg; and 5) age ≥50 years, SBP ≥130 mm Hg, and any high CVD risk 
condition.
Next, demographic and clinical characteristics of U.S. adults meeting the SPRINT eligibility 
criteria were calculated. We also calculated the number of antihypertensive medication 
classes taken by U.S. adults meeting the SPRINT eligibility criteria. Additionally, the use of 
ACEIs, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and thiazide 
diuretic agents was calculated. As <10% of U.S. adults were taking other antihypertensive 
medication classes, these are not reported individually. For comparison, we calculated the 
demographic and clinical characteristics and antihypertensive medication use for all U.S. 
adults ≥50 years of age and those with treated hypertension.
In a secondary analysis, we calculated the percentage and number of U.S. adults with SBP 
≥120 mm Hg who also did not have any SPRINT exclusion criteria, overall and who also 
had: 1) age ≥50 years; 2) high CVD risk; and 3) age ≥50 years and had high CVD risk. The 
secondary analysis was also conducted for U.S. adults overall and with and without treated 
hypertension, and separately with and without hypertension. All analyses were performed 
using SUDAAN 10.1 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina), 
accounting for the complex sampling design of NHANES. Sampling weights, recalibrated 
based on the proportion of participants missing data by age, sex, and race-ethnicity, were 
applied to all calculations to obtain U.S. nationally representative prevalence estimates. 
Recalibration of the sampling weights corrects for differences in missing data across sex and 
race-ethnicity strata and assumes that data within strata are missing randomly (7). We 
calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Taylor-series variance estimation (8).
RESULTS
In 2007 to 2012, 7.6% (95% CI: 7.0% to 8.3%) of U.S. adults, 16.7% (95% CI: 15.2% to 
18.3%) of those with treated hypertension, and 5.0% (95% CI: 4.5% to 5.6%) without 
treated hypertension met the SPRINT eligibility criteria (Table 1). The percentage eligible

 for SPRINT was greater at older age, among males versus females, among non-Hispanic 
whites compared with non-Hispanic blacks or Hispanics, and among those with SBP 140 
mm Hg versus SBP of 130 to 139 mm Hg. Among U.S. adults with hypertension, 20.0% 
(95% CI: 18.6% to 21.5%) met the SPRINT eligibility criteria compared with 2.0% (95% 
CI: 1.7% to 2.4%) without hypertension (Online Table 1).
Overall, 16.8 million (95% CI: 15.7 to 17.7 million) U.S. adults met the SPRINT eligibility 
criteria: 6.6 million (95% CI: 6.0 to 7.1 million) U.S. adults with SBP of 130 to 139 mm Hg 
and 10.2 million (95% CI: 9.5 to 10.9 million) with SBP ≥140 mm Hg (Figure 2, Online 
Table 2). Less than one-half of U.S. adults meeting the SPRINT eligibility criteria had 
treated hypertension (8.2 million [95% CI: 7.6 to 8.8 million]: 3.2 million [95% CI: 2.9 to 
3.5 million] with SBP of 130 to 139 mm Hg and 5.0 million [95% CI: 4.6 to 5.4 million] 
with SBP ≥140 mm Hg) (Online Table 3). There were 8.5 million (95% CI: 8.0 to 9.1 
million) U.S. adults not treated for hypertension who met the SPRINT eligibility criteria: 3.3 
million (95% CI: 3.0 to 3.6 million) with SBP of 130 to 139 mm Hg and 5.2 million (95% 
CI: 4.8 to 5.6 million) with SBP ≥140 mm Hg.
SPRINT eligibility criteria were met by 17.6% (95% CI: 16.4% to 18.9%) of U.S. adults 
≥50 years of age, 30.0% (95% CI: 28.0% to 32.2%) of those with SBP ≥130 mm Hg, and 
28.5% (95% CI: 26.7% to 30.4%) of those with any high CVD risk condition (Table 2). 
Additionally, 41.3% (95% CI 38.8% to 43.8%) of U.S. adults ≥50 years of age with SBP 
≥130 mm Hg met the SPRINT eligibility criteria. Of U.S. adults who also had a high CVD 
risk condition, 56.9% (95% CI: 53.8% to 60.0%) met the SPRINT eligibility criteria.
Compared with all U.S. adults ≥50 years of age, those eligible for SPRINT were older and 
more likely to be male and to be non-Hispanic white versus non-Hispanic black or Hispanic 
(Table 3). Among U.S. adults who met the SPRINT eligibility criteria, 39.1% (95% CI: 
35.5% to 42.9%) had an SBP between 130 and 139 mm Hg, 39.3% (95% CI: 34.1% to 
44.7%) among those with treated hypertension.
Among U.S. adults who met the SPRINT eligibility criteria, 51.0% (95% CI: 47.8% to 
54.1%) were not treated for hypertension (Table 4). Of those eligible for SPRINT, 43.4% 
(95% CI: 40.3% to 46.5%) did not have any antihypertensive medication identified during 
their pill bottle review and 7.6% (95% CI: 6.3% to 9.1%) had 1 or more classes of 
antihypertensive medication identified, but reported not taking the medication to lower their 
blood pressure. The most common antihypertensive medication classes being taken were 
ACE-Is, beta-blockers, and thiazide diuretic agents.
GENERALIZABILITY OF SPRINT TO A BROADER POPULATION
Overall, 38.6% (95% CI: 37.1% to 40.2%) or 84.7 million (95% CI: 81.3 to 88.2 million) 
U.S. adults had an SBP ≥120 mm Hg and did not have any SPRINT exclusion criteria (Table 
5). The percentage of U.S. adults with SBP ≥120 mm Hg, without any SPRINT exclusion 
criteria, and: 1) ≥50 years of age was 20.9% (95% CI 19.8% to 22.0%); 2) with a high CVD 
risk was 12.6% (95% CI: 11.9% to 13.3%); and 3) both ≥50 years of age and with high CVD 
risk was 11.6% (95% CI: 10.9% to 12.3%).

 DISCUSSION
In the current analysis, we estimated that 7.6% or 16.8 million U.S. adults meet the SPRINT 
eligibility criteria and, therefore, might benefit from an SBP goal <120 mm Hg (Central 
Illustration). Among U.S. adults with treated hypertension, 16.7% or 8.2 million U.S. adults 
meet the SPRINT eligibility criteria and may benefit from more intensive treatment. 
Subgroups that were more likely to meet the SPRINT eligibility criteria included older 
adults, males, and non-Hispanic whites.
SPRINT enrolled adults taking antihypertensive medication with SBP between 130 and 139 
mm Hg. Current hypertension guidelines do not recommend intensification of 
antihypertensive medication for this population (9). In our analyses, 34.8% of U.S. adults 
with treated hypertension and an SBP of 130 to 139 mm Hg met the SPRINT eligibility 
criteria. Also, SPRINT included adults with an SBP of 130 to 139 mm Hg not taking 
antihypertensive medication. We estimated 19.2% of the U.S. population in this group met 
the SPRINT eligibility criteria. Current guidelines recommend lifestyle modification for 
these individuals (10). Although many types of lifestyle modification, including weight loss, 
reduced alcohol consumption, sodium reduction, and increased physical activity, have been 
shown to lower blood pressure and reduce the incidence of hypertension, these approaches 
remain underutilized (11–14). Although there was not a pre-specified subgroup for 
participants not taking antihypertensive medication prior to SPRINT randomization, these 
individuals may benefit from lowering SBP to <120 mm Hg using antihypertensive 
medication.
The 2014 Evidence-Based Guideline for the Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults 
recently recommended an SBP threshold of 150 mm Hg for treatment initiation and goal 
attainment in adults 60 years of age and older without diabetes or chronic kidney disease (9). 
In our analysis, 19.5% and 34.6% of U.S. adults age 60 to 74 years and ≥75 years, 
respectively, met the SPRINT eligibility criteria. Age ≥75 years is an a priori defined 
subgroup in SPRINT. The results from SPRINT may have a substantial effect on the 
management of hypertension among older U.S. adults.
In the current analysis, only 4.8% of non-Hispanic blacks met the SPRINT eligibility criteria 
compared with 9.0% of non-Hispanic whites. Reasons for the low percentage of non-
Hispanic blacks in the U.S. meeting the SPRINT eligibility criteria include a high 
percentage of non-Hispanic blacks <50 years of age with SBP ≥130 mm Hg, and a high 
prevalence in this population of diabetes, stroke, heart failure, and severe chronic kidney 
disease (15,16). Hispanics were also less likely to meet the SPRINT eligibility criteria 
compared with non-Hispanic whites. In the current study, Hispanics were more likely to be 
<50 years of age and, among those treated for hypertension, have SPRINT exclusion criteria 
(e.g., diabetes, history of stroke) compared with non-Hispanic whites. Disparities in 
eligibility for SPRINT were also present by sex. Males were more likely to meet the 
SPRINT eligibility criteria compared with females, due to the lower likelihood of having a 
high CVD risk condition in females. SPRINT enrolled a substantial number of black (n = 
2,802; 29.9% of SPRINT participants), Hispanic (n = 984; 10.5%), and female (n = 3,331; 
35.6%) participants. Although race and sex are a priori defined subgroups in SPRINT, given

 the low number of non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and females in the United States meeting 
the SPRINT eligibility criteria, consideration of the generalizability of SPRINT results 
beyond those individuals who strictly meet the eligibility criteria is warranted.
With the completion of SPRINT, an important challenge will be to interpret the 
generalizability of its results to the broader population of U.S. adults with SBP ≥120 mm 
Hg. It is neither possible nor practical to repeat large randomized trials in every unstudied 
group. Clinicians are often encountered with decisions that require extrapolation of trial 
results beyond the enrolled population. We estimated that 84 million U.S. adults have SBP 
≥120 mm Hg and do not have any SPRINT exclusion criteria. The majority of these adults 
have low CVD risk (i.e., they are <50 years of age or do not have a high-risk CVD condition 
as defined in SPRINT). Therefore, using antihypertensive medication to lower SBP to <120 
mm Hg in this group may not yield substantial CVD benefits. A more appropriate estimate 
of a population to whom the SPRINT results may be generalizable is the estimated 25.5 
million U.S. adults ≥50 years of age with SBP ≥120 mm Hg who are at high CVD risk and 
who do not have any of the SPRINT exclusion criteria.
Treating hypertension to an SBP <120 mm Hg may not be beneficial and could even 
potentially be harmful (e.g., medication intolerance, falls, bradyarrhythmias, and 
hypokalemia and hyperkalemia among other potential adverse effects) in some subgroups 
(17). Given their low CVD risk, the bene-fits of lowering SBP to <120 mm Hg in adults <50 
years of age or in adults ≥50 years of age without high CVD risk may yield less benefit than 
treating adults meeting the SPRINT eligibility criteria. Extrapolation of SPRINT results to 
adults outside of those meeting the trial entry criteria should be done with caution.
The cost-effectiveness of lowering SBP to <120 mm Hg is not known. The SPRINT 
investigators are testing the hypothesis that treating to an SBP goal of <120 mm Hg 
compared with <140 mm Hg will be cost effective (at ≤$100,000 per quality-adjusted life 
year gained) (18). This analysis will provide additional information on the benefits and costs 
of applying the SPRINT results to clinical practice.
STUDY STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS
NHANES is designed to provide estimates for the U.S. population and enrolled a large 
sample size, which allowed us to conduct several subgroup analyses. There are several 
potential limitations. NHANES did not have information on the presence of reduced left 
ventricular ejection fraction or subclinical CVD (i.e., coronary calcium score, ankle brachial 
index, or left ventricular hypertrophy), which were a component of the SPRINT eligibility 
criteria. Also, NHANES does not have information on other SPRINT exclusion criteria 
including a history of medication nonadherence.
CONCLUSIONS
Traditionally, an SBP goal of <140 mm Hg has been used as a threshold to guide 
antihypertensive medication initiation and intensification in adults. SPRINT is a landmark 
trial with wide-reaching implications for the management of hypertension in adults. The

 PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN SYSTEMS-BASED PRACTICE: In contrast to current clinical 
practice standards that treat hypertension to an SBP <140 mm Hg, data from the SPRINT 
trial show that a goal of <120 mm Hg may be beneficial in patients without diabetes or a 
history of stroke. It is estimated that 16.8 million adults in the United States may be 
eligible for initiation or intensification of antihypertensive treatment based on these 
criteria, challenging available resources and systems of care.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Additional analyses are needed to assess the effect of 
more aggressive blood pressure lowering on neurological and renal function and quantify 
the medical and economic implications of implementing this more aggressive goal for 
blood pressure control across the population.

Values are % (95% confidence interval) unless otherwise specified. Treated hypertension was defined by self-reported use of antihypertensive 
medication with 1 or more classes of antihypertensive medication identified through the pill bottle review. SBP criteria include: 130–180 mm Hg 
on 0 or 1 antihypertensive medication class; 130 to 170 mm Hg on up to 2 classes; 130 to 160 mm Hg on up to 3 classes; and 130 to 150 mm Hg on 
up to 4 classes. Criteria for high CVD risk condition include: history of CHD (defined in NHANES as self-report of a prior diagnosis of myocardial 
infarction, angina, or CHD), eGFR of 20 to 59 ml/min/1.73 m2, 10-year risk for CVD ≥15% calculated using the Framingham risk score for 
general clinical practice (6), and age ≥75 years. Exclusion criteria include diabetes, history of stroke, >1 g in 24 h of proteinuria, heart failure, 
eGFR <20 ml/min/1.73 m2, or dialysis treatment in the past year.
CHD = coronary heart disease; CVD = cardiovascular disease; eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; NHANES = National Health and

antihypertensive medication identified during the pill bottle review. Of those eligible for SPRINT, 43.4% (95% confidence interval: 40.3% to 
46.5%) had no classes of antihypertensive medication and 7.6% (95% confidence interval: 6.3% to 9.1%) had 1 or more classes of antihypertensive 
medication but reported not taking medication to lower their blood pressure.
