Adiposity and ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke
Prospective study in women and meta-analysis
ABSTRACT
Objective: To compare associations of body mass index (BMI) with ischemic stroke and hemor-
rhagic stroke risk, and to review the worldwide evidence.
Methods: We recruited 1.3 million previously stroke-free UK women between 1996 and 2001
(mean age 57 years [SD 5]) and followed them by record linkage for hospital admissions and
deaths. We used Cox regression to estimate adjusted relative risks for ischemic and hemorrhagic
(intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage) stroke in relation to BMI. We conducted a meta-
analysis of published findings from prospective studies on these associations.
Results: During an average follow-up of 11.7 years, there were 20,549 first strokes, of which
9,993 were specified as ischemic and 5,852 as hemorrhagic. Increased BMI was associated with
an increased risk of ischemic stroke (relative risk 1.21 per 5 kg/m2 BMI, 95% confidence interval
1.18–1.23, p , 0.0001) but a decreased risk of hemorrhagic stroke (relative risk 0.89 per 5 kg/m2
BMI, 0.86–0.92, p , 0.0001). The BMI-associated trends for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke
were significantly different (heterogeneity: p , 0.0001) but were not significantly different for
intracerebral hemorrhage (n 5 2,790) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (n 5 3,062) (heterogeneity:
p 5 0.5). Published data from prospective studies showed consistently greater BMI-associated
relative risks for ischemic than hemorrhagic stroke with most evidence (prior to this study) coming
from Asian populations.
Conclusions: In UK women, higher BMI is associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke but
decreased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The totality of the available published evidence suggests
that BMI-associated risks are greater for ischemic than for hemorrhagic stroke. Neurology®

There is increasing recognition of adiposity as a risk factor for a wide range of common diseases
in adulthood and later life,1 and rising levels of obesity worldwide have highlighted the impor-
tance of clarifying the relationship between adiposity and the risk of specific types of disease to
inform public health policy. Stroke is a major cause of disability and death internationally2 and
its association with body mass index (BMI) is well-established.3 However, this association is
likely to be dominated by the association between BMI and ischemic stroke, and few prospective
studies have accrued sufficient numbers of strokes of known pathologic type to estimate asso-
ciations separately for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Most evidence on the role of BMI in
specific types of stroke comes from Asia, where stroke is more common than in Western
countries and etiologies may be different.4 We investigated these associations in a large pro-
spective study of UK women. To set our findings in context, we also conducted a systematic

 review and meta-analysis of published pro-
spective studies relating BMI to risk of ische-
mic and hemorrhagic stroke.
METHODS Study participants. Between 1996 and 2001,
1.3 million middle-aged women in the United Kingdom were
recruited to the Million Women Study at breast cancer
screening centers in England and Scotland.5 Each participant
returned a recruitment questionnaire on health and lifestyle
characteristics, including current height and weight. In 2006–
2009, direct measurements of height and weight were obtained
for a subset of participants 9 years after recruitment on average.6
We followed the entire cohort for deaths, emigrations, and
hospital admissions (as inpatients or day cases) by linkage to
National Health Service (NHS) central registers and electronic
hospital records. Full details of the study design, methods, survey
questionnaires, and information about data sharing can be found
on the study’s website (www.millionwomenstudy.org).
Exposure assessment. Using information from the recruitment
questionnaire, study participants were grouped by BMI (reported
weight in kilograms divided by the square of the reported height
in meters) in 5 categories: ,22.5, 22.5–,25, 25–,27.5,
27.5–,30, $30 kg/m2. To allow for measurement error and
changes in BMI over time, when estimating trends we scored
each category as the mean measured BMI among the subset of
women in that category for whom direct measurements were
available: 22.2, 25.2, 27.6, 30.3, and 34.4 kg/m2, respectively.
We defined other baseline exposures as follows: region (Scotland
and the 9 extant Cancer Registry regions in England), deprivation
category (a measure of socioeconomic status based on quintiles of
the Townsend index,7 an area-based index of deprivation), self-
reported strenuous exercise (“enough to cause sweating or a fast
heartbeat”; none, ,1, 1, 21 times per week), alcohol intake
(none, 0.52, 32, 71 units per week, where 1 unit is assumed
to contain 10 grams of pure alcohol), smoking (never, past,
current: ,15, 151 cigarettes/d), and height (,160, 1602,
1651 centimeters). To examine the role of factors that might
mediate
associations
of
BMI
with
stroke,3
we
grouped
participants according to self-reported treatment for relevant
conditions at recruitment: hypertension (no, yes), high blood
cholesterol (no, yes), and diabetes (no, yes).
Outcome assessment. Women with self-reported prior stroke
at recruitment, or mention of prior cerebrovascular disease
(ICD-9 codes 430–438 or ICD-10 codes I60-I69) in the
electronic hospital record, and those who did not report their
height or weight, were excluded from all analyses. We defined
the first stroke as the earliest postrecruitment hospital admission
mentioning stroke, if any, or death with stroke certified as the
underlying cause. Electronic hospital records were available for
April 1, 1997, to March 31, 2011, in England (Hospital Episode
Statistics) and January 1, 1981, to December 31, 2008, in
Scotland (Scottish Morbidity Record); death and emigration
records were available up to December 31, 2012. All sources
provided date and causes coded to the ICD-10 for each event
during the study period. Using ICD-10, we defined subarachnoid
hemorrhage as I60, intracerebral hemorrhage as I61, and ischemic
stroke as I63. Stroke of unspecified type (I64) includes both
ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. We used primary care data
from 2 different sources to assess the numbers of strokes
specified either as hemorrhagic or as ischemic in the primary
care records of women whose stroke was unspecified in hospital
records. Primary care data, for those women for whom this
information was available, came from (1) information obtained
by record linkage to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink
(CPRD) (see cprd.com for further details), which is available
for 8% of the cohort; and (2) that reported by primary care
physicians in a postal survey requesting further information
about a random subsample of 1,004 women with a hospital
admission for stroke.8
For the small proportion of hospital stroke admissions with
more than 1 recorded primary pathologic type (0.3%), we used
the type recorded latest during the admission, on the assumption
that diagnostic accuracy would improve during the hospital stay.
A sensitivity analysis was conducted in which the endpoint was
restricted to admissions with stroke as the first diagnosis listed
(92% of all admissions listing stroke as a diagnosis).
Statistical analysis. Observation for stroke outcomes began at
recruitment or the start of electronic hospital records (whichever
was later) and ceased at death, emigration, or the end of electronic
hospital records (whichever was earlier), with censoring at any
stroke event. We estimated hazard ratios (subsequently referred
to as relative risks) for stroke in each BMI category relative to a ref-
erence group (,22.5 kg/m2) by Cox regression, taking attained
age as the underlying time variable, stratifying by region, and
adjusting for potential confounders (deprivation, physical exer-
cise, alcohol intake, smoking, and height). Women with missing
values for any covariate were assigned to a separate level of that
factor (deprivation ,1%, exercise 3%, alcohol ,1%, smoking
6%). We computed group-specific 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) by estimating the variance of the log risk for each group.9
We also estimated log-linear trends in risk over the 5 categories of
BMI, with conventional 95% CIs, scoring each category as the
mean within-category measured BMI. We expressed all trends as
relative risks per 5 kg/m2, and assessed heterogeneity between
trend estimates with a 2-sided x2 contrast test,10 using a 1%
significance level (rather than 5%) to allow for repeated testing.
Relative risks are presented separately after adjustment for age and
region only, and after additional adjustment for deprivation,
exercise, alcohol, smoking and height.
Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to assess the effect of
excluding the first 5 years of follow-up (to assess potential effects
of reverse causation, whereby preclinical disease may affect BMI),
and of additionally excluding women with self-reported prior
heart disease, thrombosis, diabetes, or cancer (not just prior
stroke), and of adjustment for previous history of cancer. We also
assessed the effect of excluding underweight women (BMI ,18.5
kg/m2) from the analysis. All calculations used Stata version
13.0.11
We repeated the trend analyses for subgroups defined by var-
ious characteristics of the women, including age, adjustment fac-
tors, and whether or not women self-reported treatment, at
baseline, for hypertension, high cholesterol, or diabetes.
To assess the plausibility of possible mechanisms for the asso-
ciation of BMI with specific stroke subtypes, mean apolipopro-
tein B/A1 ratio was calculated within categories of BMI in
a subsample of women with measured lipid levels.
Systematic review and meta-analysis. We conducted a sys-
tematic review of prospective studies of BMI and incidence of
the main pathologic types of stroke. In March 2015, we searched
PubMed for relevant articles in English, using combinations of
the MeSH terms stroke (both ischemic and hemorrhagic), intra-
cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and body mass
index. Titles and abstracts of identified articles were initially
screened for relevance. Potentially relevant articles were then as-
sessed for eligibility using the following inclusion criteria: cohort

 published after 1994, relating adult BMI to risk of incident stroke
(fatal and nonfatal), including at least 500 strokes in total (to
reduce scope for publication bias), and giving separate estimates
for both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, adjusted for confound-
ers (at least age, and sex or smoking where relevant) but not for
potential mediators (hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes).
Where several models were reported, we chose the model that
was adjusted for the largest number of confounders, without
being adjusted for potential mediators. Where studies overlapped,
we excluded the smaller study. Where necessary, trends were esti-
mated from categorical risk estimates by generalized least
squares,12 with group-specific BMI means estimated from
means, standard deviations, or percentiles of BMI, assuming
a normal distribution. Where appropriate, we combined trend
estimates for subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage. We
expressed all trend estimates as relative risks per 5 kg/m2,
grouped them by prespecified geographic area (Asia and
Europe, North America, or Australia, because the distribution
and etiologies of stroke subtypes differ between populations of
Asian and European origin),4 and combined results by inverse-
variance methods.13
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The Multi-Centre Research Ethics Committee for
Anglia and Oxford approved the study. Each participant gave
written informed consent to follow-up through medical records.
RESULTS Million Women Study. After exclusions
for prior cerebrovascular disease (1%) and missing
BMI (a further 5%), 1,277,129 women were included
in the analysis (table 1). Of these, 15,683 (1%) were
lost to follow-up during the study period, for example,
through emigration, but contributed person-years
under observation until the relevant end of follow-up
date. Mean age at recruitment was 56.7 years (SD 5),
and mean follow-up time was 11.7 years, with 15
million
person-years
of
follow-up
included
in
analyses for this study. Women with higher BMI
tended to have lower socioeconomic status than
leaner women, and were less likely to currently
smoke, drink alcohol, or use hormone therapy, but
more likely to be physically inactive, and much more
likely to report being on treatment for hypertension,
high cholesterol, or diabetes at recruitment.
During
follow-up,
there
were
20,549
first
strokes, of which 9,993 were coded as ischemic
(cerebral infarction), 5,852 were coded as hemor-
rhagic (2,790 intracerebral and 3,062 subarachnoid
hemorrhage), and 4,704 were of unspecified type
(table 1). Increased BMI was associated with an
increased risk of ischemic stroke. The relative risk
of ischemic stroke per 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was
1.23 (1.20–1.26) after adjustment for age and
region only, and 1.21 (1.18–1.23) after additional
adjustment for all 5 potential confounders listed in
the Methods section. By contrast, the corresponding
relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke decreased with
increasing BMI with an age- and region-adjusted
relative risk of 0.88 (0.85–0.91), which was rela-
tively unaffected by adjustment for other potential
confounders (relative risk 0.89, 95% CI 0.86–0.92).
This difference in BMI-associated trends in risk for
ischemic vs hemorrhagic stroke was highly signifi-
cant (figure 1, p , 0.0001). There was no signifi-
cant difference between the BMI-associated trends
for intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage (fig-
ure 2, p 5 0.5).

tal admissions with stroke listed as the first diagnosis

 excluding women with any self-reported prior ill
health (not just stroke), or with adjustment for prior
history of cancer, did not differ materially from the
main findings (in each case, trend estimates differed
by no more than 2% for both ischemic and hemor-
rhagic stroke). Exclusion of 12,639 (1%) women
with a BMI of ,18.5 kg/m2 had a negligible effect
on the main findings (trend estimates differed by no
more than 2% for both ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke).
The association between BMI and unspecified
stroke (I64; n 5 4,704) resembled the pattern of risk
seen for any stroke except that the relative risk of
unspecified stroke was slightly higher in the most
obese category (figure e-1 at Neurology.org). This is
likely to reflect a greater proportion of ischemic
strokes among those of unspecified type.14 Additional
information collected from primary care about
women
with
a
stroke
in
this
cohort
shows
that ischemic strokes are overrepresented in the
“unspecified stroke” category of hospital data. For
women who were coded as having an unspecified
stroke (I64) in their hospital records, but whose
stroke was specified as either ischemic or hemorrhagic
in their primary care records, the proportion of
strokes specified as ischemic were 75% (54/72)
based on linked primary care data (CPRD) and
89% (78/88) based on information provided directly
by the patient’s primary care physician. Both these
percentages are greater than the corresponding propor-
tion of 63% ischemic stroke (9,993/15,845), based on
hospital records with specified type.
There was some heterogeneity in the relative
risks per 5 kg/m2 across subgroups of women
(figure 3, p , 0.0001 and p 5 0.003 for global
heterogeneity among the trends for ischemic stroke
and hemorrhagic stroke, respectively). For hemor-
rhagic stroke, the decreasing trend in relative risk
with higher BMI was stronger in older women, and
in those who reported at baseline being treated for
hypertension or for high cholesterol. For ischemic
stroke, the increasing trend in relative risk with
higher BMI was weaker in physically inactive
women, smokers, and those who reported at base-
line being treated for hypertension. The pattern of
an
increasing
trend
in
ischemic
stroke
and
a decreasing trend in hemorrhagic stroke was evi-
dent regardless of reported treatment for high
blood pressure or high cholesterol.
Among 15,739 women with information on
blood lipid levels, who were not receiving treatment
for high cholesterol at recruitment, mean apolipopro-
tein B/A1 ratio increased with increasing BMI. The
mean ratios in women with BMIs (in kg/m2) of
,25, 25–,30, and 301 were 0.62 (0.61–0.62),
0.67 (0.66–0.67), and 0.68 (0.67–0.68), respectively.

For Europe, North America, and Australia, previous

contributed an additional 15,845 cases.
In all but 318,23,24 of the 12 published studies

lower for hemorrhagic than ischemic stroke. For both
stroke types, the pooled trend estimates were lower in

 European/North American populations than in
Asian populations, and within these groups there
was some heterogeneity across studies (figure 4).
DISCUSSION In this prospective study of 1.3
million UK women, among whom 20,549 incident
strokes had occurred, increased BMI was found to
be associated with an increased risk of ischemic
stroke but a decreased risk of hemorrhagic stroke.
The magnitude of the reduction in risk associated
with increasing BMI was similar for intracerebral
and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Published findings from other prospective stud-
ies are broadly consistent with ours. The BMI-
associated relative risk was greater for ischemic than
for hemorrhagic stroke overall, and separately, in 9
of the 12 previously published studies that were
included in the meta-analysis. Findings from 5 other
potentially eligible studies that did not publish
results in a suitable form for inclusion in the
meta-analysis did not appear to contradict the find-
ings
of
the
meta-analysis.27–31
The
difference
between the trends for the 2 stroke types was greater
in the European, North American and Australian
studies than in the Asian studies, perhaps reflecting
variation in the epidemiology of different stroke
types in these different populations.32 As in our
study, there was no evidence that the BMI associa-
tion differed for subarachnoid and intracerebral
hemorrhage in the 2 large Asian cohort studies that
estimated separate trends for these types.25,26
The reasons for a difference between the BMI-
associated risks of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke are
unclear. Obesity is associated with well-established risk
factors for stroke in general, including hypertension,
dyslipidemia, and diabetes.33 Hypertension increases
the risk of both stroke types, but some evidence sug-
gests that dyslipidemia and diabetes specifically
increase the risk of ischemic stroke.34 It has also been
suggested that hemorrhagic stroke risk increases with
decreasing serum cholesterol levels.35 Although we
were unable to assess directly whether differences in
lipid levels could account for the observed associa-
tions between BMI and stroke subtypes, the increase
in apolipoprotein B/A1 ratio with increasing BMI
shown here is consistent with the hypothesis that
BMI increases ischemic stroke risk, and decreases
hemorrhagic stroke risk, through altered lipid levels.
We followed 1.3 million women for 11.7 years on
average, using routinely collected NHS data and elec-
tronic hospital records to ascertain both fatal and
nonfatal strokes with virtually no loss to follow-up.
There is evidence from this8 and other studies36 that
diagnoses of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes re-
corded in hospital records are sufficiently reliable
for epidemiologic investigation. Measurement error
and changes in BMI over time were minimized by
the use of measured height and weight from sampled
participants 9 years after recruitment to score BMI
categories for trend estimation.
Comparisons with primary care data, and pub-
lished data on the relative frequency of pathologic
types of stroke in populations of European origin,14
suggest that relatively few women coded as having
had an unspecified stroke in the hospital data had
had a hemorrhagic stroke. Thus incomplete infor-
mation on stroke types in hospital data is unlikely to
have materially biased the association of increased
BMI with decreased risk of hemorrhagic stroke
observed here. Nor are reverse causation or con-
founding likely to explain the results, since trend
estimates changed very little after excluding the first
5 years of follow-up, and the direction of the trends
differed between the 2 types of stroke. Our analyses
are based on strokes occurring in women over the

 age of 50 that resulted in hospital admission or
death. Since hemorrhagic strokes are more likely
than ischemic strokes to result in hospital admission
or death,37,38 this is likely to have led to an over-
representation of hemorrhagic strokes in this study
compared with other studies where stroke outcome
was ascertained differently. This should not, how-
ever, bias our estimates of the association between
BMI and specific types of stroke and, while we can-
not necessarily assume that the findings observed
here apply equally to strokes managed without
admission to hospital, our findings are unlikely to

 have been materially affected by omission of this
subgroup of stroke cases.
The main finding from this study is that greater
adiposity is associated with an increase in ischemic
stroke, but not necessarily hemorrhagic stroke. Our
results suggest qualitatively different BMI-associated
risks for these 2 pathologic types of stroke in UK
women, and a decreased risk of both subarachnoid
and intracerebral hemorrhage with higher BMI.
