Perhaps because gastroenterology, immunology, toxicology, and the nutrition and
agricultural sciences are outside of their competence and responsibility, psychologists
and psychiatrists typically fail to appreciate the impact that food can have on their
patients’ condition. Here we attempt to help correct this situation by reviewing, in
non-technical, plain English, how cereal grains—the world’s most abundant food
source—can affect human behavior and mental health. We present the implications
for the psychological sciences of the findings that, in all of us, bread (1) makes
the gut more permeable and can thus encourage the migration of food particles to
sites where they are not expected, prompting the immune system to attack both
these particles and brain-relevant substances that resemble them, and (2) releases
opioid-like compounds, capable of causing mental derangement if they make it to the
brain. A grain-free diet, although difficult to maintain (especially for those that need
it the most), could improve the mental health of many and be a complete cure for
others.

INTRODUCTION
‘‘Give us this day our daily bread (. . .) but deliver us from evil’’
—Matthew 6:11, 13
About 12,000 years ago, when the last ice age came to an end, the rapid change in
climate decimated our traditional food sources, especially large game. Possibly in response
to that, in the fertile crescent of the Middle East (roughly the areas comprising the
Levant and the Tigris and Euphrates valleys) we began to practice agriculture and animal
domestication. Within a few thousand years both had independently started on at least
four different continents (Murphy, 2007), stabilizing and increasing our food supply to
such an extent that the human population exploded. Yet the agricultural revolution not
only increased the availability of food, but also radically changed its nature: cereal grain
products, to which we were largely unaccustomed, quickly took center stage. This article
illustrates the surprising relevance of this diet change to neuroscientists, psychologists, and
psychiatrists.
That the association between humans and grains paid off nicely for both is beyond
dispute. Each partner helped the other reproduce, multiply, and ultimately conquer vast
patches of the earth. Each partner coevolved with the other, adapting to it. For example,
wheat progressively became shorter in response to our own preference for crops easier to
harvest and less vulnerable to wind. At the same time, our faces, jaws, and teeth progressively

Bread and Mental Disease
became smaller in response to the soft texture of bread
(Larsen, 1995). Thus we domesticated grain, and in return grain
domesticated us (Murphy, 2007).
Yet the agricultural revolution may have spelled trouble.
Tellingly, whenever diets based on grain replaced the traditional
diets of hunter-gatherers, lifespan and stature decreased—while
infant mortality, infectious diseases, bone mineral disorders, and
the frequency of dental caries increased (Cohen, 1987). Some
of these problems were never totally overcome. For example,
despite a gradual increase in stature beginning 4,000 years ago,
when diets became more varied again, on average we are still
about 3 cm shorter than our pre-agriculture ancestors (Murphy,
2007). The coevolution between humans and grain brought on
genetic changes in both parties, but did not render grain a more
suitable food for us than it originally was.
One of the first hints that these circumstances could have
implications for the psychological sciences was the observation
that, in several countries, hospitalization rates for schizophrenia
during World War II dropped in direct proportion to wheat
shortages. In the United States, where over that same period the
consumption of wheat rose rather than diminished, such rates
increased instead (Dohan, 1966a,b). In South Pacific islands with
a traditionally low consumption of wheat, schizophrenia rose
dramatically (roughly, from 1 out of 30,000 to 1 out of 100)
when Western grain products were introduced (Dohan et al.,
1984).
There is now substantial evidence that, depending on genes
carried by over one third of us and on seemingly irrelevant factors
such as a previous viral infection, eating bread can adversely
affect our body and brain. This article reviews the evidence
for a wide readership in non-technical, plain English. The next
three sections present the implications for the psychological
sciences of the facts that bread (1) increases the permeability
of the gut and likely of the blood-brain barrier in all of
us, (2) sets off an immune reaction in those of us who are
genetically predisposed, and (3) breaks down, during digestion,
in fragments with opioid activity. The final section discusses
whether a change in diet could possibly cure patients with mental
illness.
GRASSES, GRAINS, AND POISONS
Grains are the seeds of grasses. Grasses may or may not
have evolved to let their seeds be eaten (Janzen, 1984), but
certainly not to let them be digested into pieces that will be
incapable of passing on the plant’s genes. Grasses cannot defend
themselves by fleeing or fighting, they have no thorns, they
carry no protective hard shell around their seeds; like most
plants, however, they produce toxins. Plants have engineered a
wide variety of poisons—over 50,000 defensive compounds have
been identified so far (Kennedy and Wightman, 2011)—to deter,
harm, or kill the creatures that feed on them. These creatures,
in turn, have evolved an arsenal of countermeasures, including
mechanisms to detect (for example, bitter taste receptors) and
detoxify such poisons as much as possible (Hagen et al., 2009).
Understandably,
self-defense
proteins
are
especially
concentrated in plants’ most precious fraction—the seeds.
Ironically, of the three separate genomes that modern wheat
contains from the spontaneous cross-fertilization of three
different wild species (e.g., Murphy, 2007), the genome
responsible for the best quality bread is associated with the
most toxic proteins (Kucek et al., 2015). These are capable, at
least in rodents, of crossing both the gut and the blood-brain
barriers (Broadwell et al., 1988) and interfere, among other
things (Pusztai et al., 1993), with the action of nerve growth
factor (Hashimoto and Hagino, 1989). In pasta, many of these
proteins—though highly resistant to digestion—are lost in
the salted water during cooking, hence they do not make it
to the final dish (Mamone et al., 2015). Yet they can still be
found in beer and pre-steamed couscous (Flodrová et al.,
2015) and can be inhaled from raw flour (Walusiak et al.,
2004).
Seeds are also equipped with proteins designed to provide
ready-made nourishment for the future seedling. The kit of
storage proteins in barley, rye, and particularly wheat, known as
gluten (‘‘glue’’ in Latin), has turned out to have special value for
us. As bread dough is kneaded, gluten forms an elastic network
that traps the gases produced by yeast during fermentation; this
allows the dough to rise and to expand during baking. The
spectacular success of wheat relative to barley and rye has mainly
hinged on the ease with which a light, porous, optimally chewy
bread can be obtained from its flour.
Unfortunately, gluten has proven to be toxic for a proportion
of people that in the last few decades has been constantly
rising (Rubio-Tapia et al., 2009). Indeed, the wheat varieties
that contain the most detrimental type of gluten have become
more common (van den Broeck et al., 2010). This is particularly
worrying given that gluten is not only naturally present
in bread, cake, pasta, pizza, and beer, but it is—for its
binding and thickening properties—also added to an impressive
variety of other products. A survey of Australian supermarkets
found gluten in nearly 2,000 different food items, ranging
from sauces to processed meats, and over 100 non-foods,
from pain relievers to shampoos (Atchison et al., 2010).
Yet gluten triggers some action as soon as it turns up
in the gut—not only in a few sensitive people, but in all
of us.
HOLES IN OUR GUT
A post-mortem study of 82 schizophrenia patients found rates
of stomach, small intestine, and large intestine inflammation
as impressive as respectively 50%, 88%, and 92% (Buscaino,
1953; cited in Buscaino, 1978). The association between
gastrointestinal pathologies and psychiatric disorders had
already been noticed at least 2,000 years ago and has been
confirmed repeatedly (for a brief review see Severance et al.,
2015).
An unhealthy gut may open up our body to harmful bacteria,
toxins, and undigested pieces of food. In each of us, an intestinal
wall whose surface could pave an entire studio apartment
(Helander and Fändriks, 2014) faces the challenge of preventing
this from happening, while letting water and nutrients through.
This feat is accomplished via a sophisticated barrier, where the
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

Bread and Mental Disease
opening and closing of the junctions between the wall’s cells
are adjusted flexibly (Bischoff et al., 2014). Other than that,
this architecture might serve as an emergency line of defense
against pathogenic microbes (Fasano et al., 1997). The part
of the gut that immediately follows the stomach, the small
intestine, is in fact kept virtually sterile—bacteria are removed
by the peristaltic movements of the gut before they can multiply
(Dixon, 1960). Any abnormal presence of microbes triggers
the release of the protein zonulin, which widens the junctions
between cells so that water can seep into the intestine and
flush out bacteria via loose bowel movements (El Asmar et al.,
2002).
Producing diarrhea is just one exceptional job among the
many, less conspicuous daily ones that zonulin is believed
to perform. Importantly, regulation of intestinal permeability
grants or vetoes the passage of large molecules and immune cells.
For still obscure reasons, however, sometimes this mechanism
allows partially undigested food components to escape from
the gut and reach (a) the inner layer of the intestinal wall,
which hosts a large part of the immune system, and (b) the
bloodstream. These substances are not expected there and can
set in motion a misdirected immune reaction (for a readable
account of the details, see Fasano, 2009). Protracted abnormal gut
permeability is indeed associated with a wide range of immune-
related diseases, and in some animal studies has been shown to
precede them, suggesting causation (e.g., Meddings et al., 1999).
These diseases include arthritis, asthma, type 1 diabetes, and
multiple sclerosis (Fasano, 2012).
It is worth noting that psychological stress worsens gut
permeability. Speaking in public does it, with transient effects
(Vanuytsel et al., 2014), and early maternal deprivation does
it too, with long-term ones (demonstrated in rats: Barreau
et al., 2004). Interestingly, psychological stress also worsens
gut inflammation (for a brief review, see Daulatzai, 2015),
exacerbates immune-related diseases (Dhabhar, 2009), and
predicts the onset and severity of mental disorders (Kendler
et al., 1999; Carr et al., 2013). Some common spices (Jensen-
Jarolim et al., 1998) and food components (e.g., Bischoff et al.,
2014) modulate gut permeability too, either increasing it (like
fructose, widely used to sweeten commercial beverages) or
decreasing it (like the flavonoid quercetin, found in onions and
tea). Probably because it is mistaken for a microbial molecule
(Fasano et al., 2015), gluten stimulates zonulin release and hence
features prominently in the former group (Hollon et al., 2015).
Ingestion of an inhibitor of zonulin prevents gluten from raising
gut permeability, and a gluten-free diet reduces both zonulin
levels and gut permeability (Fasano, 2011). In all of us, zonulin
increases the permeability not only of the intestinal wall, but
also of other no less interesting barriers—notably the blood-
brain one. A toxin mimicking zonulin is actually being studied
for its ability to enhance delivery to the brain of drugs such as
anticancer agents (Karyekar et al., 2003).
IMMUNE SYSTEM MISTAKES
After increasing gut permeability and with its help, gluten can
make trouble if it happens to cross the outer layer of the intestinal
wall and become the target of immune surveillance. The next two
subsections explore the consequences of this encounter on our
body and on our brain.
The Many Forms of Wheat Sensitivity
Some people are overtly allergic to wheat (from here on, ‘‘wheat’’
will cover all gluten-containing grains). Minutes to hours after
exposure, these individuals develop symptoms such as rashes,
headaches, diarrhea, or shortness of breath—a well-known
example is baker’s asthma. This wheat allergy (Inomata, 2009)
engages the part of our immune system that responds quickly
against parasitic worms, fungi, and microorganisms. In some of
us, however, gluten triggers immune-mediated reactions whose
symptoms develop gradually, weeks to years after its introduction
in the diet.
In about 1 person out of 100 this hypersensitivity is expressed
as celiac disease, defined as a chronic immune reaction against
one’s own small intestine. Over time, this reaction flattens
the intestinal wall (which is normally covered with millions
of finger-like protrusions), reducing its surface and thus its
ability to absorb important nutrients for both body and brain.
If gluten is not withdrawn during childhood, the growth of
some cranial bones is altered as well. As a result, over 80%
of adult celiacs have unusual facial proportions (Zanchi et al.,
2013). Quite typical is an especially high forehead relative either
to the middle third of the face or to the forehead of healthy
people (see, respectively, Finizio et al., 2005; and Zanchi et al.,
2013).
Most people with celiac disease do not know they have it. In
a sample of over 5,000 Italian students, for example, the ratio of
diagnosed to undiagnosed cases was 1 to 6 (Catassi et al., 1995).
In the elderly, celiac disease often goes unrecognized as well,
with a mean delay of 17 years from the onset of symptoms to
diagnosis (Gasbarrini et al., 2001). Alarmingly, blood markers
of the disease have quadrupled in the United States in the last
50 years (Rubio-Tapia et al., 2009) and doubled in Finland in the
last 20 (Lohi et al., 2007). Measurements were taken all at once
on blood samples collected and frozen decades apart, hence the
recent surge in the disease cannot be due to better detection or
more lenient diagnostic criteria. Markers also increase within the
same group of individuals over time, showing that an abnormal
immune response to gluten can suddenly emerge in adulthood
(Catassi et al., 2010).
Some people do better on a gluten-free diet and worsen
upon a gluten challenge (even under double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled conditions: Biesiekierski et al., 2011) although
they do not meet the criteria of either wheat allergy or
celiac disease. This non-celiac gluten sensitivity is diagnosed
by exclusion, because there are currently no laboratory tests
for it. The gut permeability of these people is normal, unlike
that of celiacs—but gluten makes it soar just as much as that
of celiacs (Hollon et al., 2015). Symptoms emerge hours to
days after gluten exposure and are largely extraintestinal; they
include headache and eczema but also fatigue and ‘‘foggy mind’’
(Sapone et al., 2012). Other individuals report being sensitive
to gluten but actually experience bloating and abdominal pain
from wheat’s carbohydrates (Biesiekierski et al., 2013). Many

Bread and Mental Disease
studies on non-celiac gluten sensitivity have not controlled
for the presence of these carbohydrates; they can also be
found in various vegetables, however, and whether their effects
can go beyond mere intestinal discomfort is debatable (for
opposing views, see Fasano et al., 2015; De Giorgio et al.,
2016).
Over 95% of celiacs carry a specific variant of a gene that
is corresponsible for the regulation of the immune system, and
about 5% carry another (Diosdado et al., 2005). Crucially, both
genes are implicated in the ability of the immune system to
distinguish self from non-self. These genes are also present in
30–40% of the general population, however, and of course not
all of them develop celiac disease; even monozygotic twins on
the same diet can be discordant for it (Greco et al., 2002). Other
factors must thus be involved—possibly, simple environmental
triggers. These have been shown to range from delivering a
baby (Malnick et al., 1998) to contracting a virus or a parasite.
In one study, for example, nearly 90% of celiacs, vs. 17% of
controls, showed evidence of previous infection with adenovirus
(Kagnoff et al., 1987). Because a protein coded by this virus is
structurally similar to gluten, it is plausible that in genetically
predisposed individuals the initial reaction to the virus may
extend to gluten and then to some proteins in our own intestine
that resemble both—a process called molecular mimicry (see
Kasarda, 1997).
Wheat and the Mind
Unfortunately, gluten resembles some brain-relevant substances
too. In vitro, antibodies against gluten removed from human
blood attack cerebellar proteins and components of the myelin
sheath that insulates nerves (Vojdani et al., 2014). They also
attack an enzyme involved in the production of GABA—our
prime inhibitory neurotransmitter, whose dysregulation is
implicated in both anxiety and depression. In the blood of
blood donors, antibodies against wheat or milk and antibodies
against these brain-relevant substances have been found to
be simultaneously elevated, consistent with the presence of
a cross-reaction (Vojdani et al., 2014). Most of us escape it
only because our gut and blood-brain barriers are intact—and
only as long as they remain so. Antibodies against the brain,
triggered by gluten, can cause severe neurological dysfunctions
whether or not one is celiac (Hadjivassiliou et al., 2010).
Similar antibodies have also been found in the blood of a
subgroup of schizophrenia patients; some of them carried blood
markers of celiac disease, but others did not (Cascella et al.,
2013).
If wheat can affect the brain, it should come as no surprise
that it can affect mental health too (for a review, see Jackson
et al., 2012a). Exceptionally large epidemiological studies, each
involving many thousands of patients, have found that celiac
disease is associated with an increased risk of depression
(Ludvigsson et al., 2007b) and psychosis (Ludvigsson et al.,
2007a). Among individuals with a normal intestinal wall, those
who carry blood markers of celiac disease are three times more
likely to develop autism in the future, and five times more likely
to have already been diagnosed with it (Ludvigsson et al., 2013).
Antibodies against gluten have been found much more
often in schizophrenia and autism patients than in the general
population or in controls, a result that has been replicated
repeatedly (Jackson et al., 2012a). Some figures are stunning, such
as a reported presence of antibodies against gluten in 87% of
unmedicated autistic children vs. 1% of normal children (Cade
et al., 2000).
Microbial Accomplices
The main gene that predisposes to celiac disease also changes
the composition of the microbes in the gut; a notable finding,
because we now know that these microbes (collectively known
as gut microbiota) are directly capable of shaping our behavior
(Dinan et al., 2015; Kramer and Bressan, 2015). Carriers and
non-carriers of the gene produce stools with significant bacterial
differences at 1 month of age already (Olivares et al., 2015).
Among other things, carriers host more clostridia; clostridia
tend to be overrepresented in the guts of children with autism
(Louis, 2012), and it is suggestive to associate these findings to
the epidemiological evidence, discussed earlier, of a larger risk of
autism in celiacs.
Gut microbes even appear to play a part in when (and
possibly whether!) carriers do develop celiac disease. Because
the maturation of our immune system is co-driven by our
microbial community (Kranich et al., 2011), it is crucial that
the latter develops normally—which could be jeopardized by
feeding babies inappropriate foods at an inappropriate time. The
microbiota matures enormously in the first 12 months of life,
hence it might be important to avoid gluten during this period
(Fasano, 2009). Indeed, a double-blind study on young carriers
of the celiac gene compared the relevance of early (6 months of
age) vs. late (12 months) introduction of gluten in their diets.
Early introduction promptly caused loss of tolerance to gluten
and set off the development of autoimmunity, arguably via a
change in the composition of the still immature microbiota
(Sellitto et al., 2012). Indeed, whether or not transgenic mice
with the celiac gene in them express the disease has recently
been shown to be entirely determined by their guts. Eating
gluten started celiac disease in the mice who had been raised
without gut microbes, or whose microbiota included pathogens
or had been perturbed by antibiotics right after birth—but not
in the mice whose microbiota was healthy (Galipeau et al.,
2015).
Changes in gut microbiota due to a sudden, massive exposure
to wheat products have also been hypothesized to mediate
the well-known relationship between immigrant status and
schizophrenia (Severance et al., 2014). This might be, for
example, the case of people moving to Europe from sub-
Saharan Africa, where staple grains do not include wheat and are
traditionally broken down via fermentation before being eaten. It
is thus entirely possible that bread can be harmful to our mental
health not only directly, via some of the proteins it contains;
but also indirectly, via its effects on our gut microbes. The
causal relationship between eating bread and harboring certain
microbes could actually go both ways, as suggested by recent
evidence that our craving for certain foods may be driven by the
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

 Bressan and Kramer
Bread and Mental Disease
intestinal bacteria that feed on them. Bread is ultimately broken
down to sugar, and plenty of microbes thrive on sugar. When
not enough of it comes their way, microbes might be able to
manipulate their host by inducing bad mood and other painful
sensations—relieved only by eating the right stuff (Alcock et al.,
2014).
BREAD AND OTHER DRUGS
During digestion, gluten is broken down into hundreds to
thousands of fragments that are not further dissolved. Some of
them resemble morphine extremely much and have thus been
named exorphins (where ‘‘exo’’ refers to their external origin;
Zioudrou et al., 1979). Exorphins are released from other proteins
as well—prominently casein, found in milk and very similar to
gluten, but also albumin in rice and zein in corn (Teschemacher,
2003). How exorphins affect our behavior, and what happens if
they are absorbed from the gut and show up in the brain, are the
topics of the next two subsections.
Exorphins Posing as Endorphins
Like morphine, exorphins bind to opioid receptors that are
widely distributed throughout the body—in places as different
as the gut, the lungs, the genitals, the various districts of the
nervous system. Such receptors are of course meant for our
own opioids, endorphins (of internal origin, ‘‘endo’’). Our body
may produce endorphins to reduce pain when we need to
continue functioning in spite of injury or stress, as during
labor or combat. The ‘‘runner’s high’’, the state of euphoria
experienced by long-distance runners, might capitalize on this
mechanism (Boecker et al., 2008; but see also Fuss et al.,
2015).
It has been intriguingly suggested that one major function of
endorphins would be to protect the organism against starvation
in times of stressful, prolonged food scarcity (Margules, 1979,
1988). We know that the same opioid can exert opposite
effects depending on which receptor it binds to (Teschemacher,
2003); the key might be whether the receptor happens to
sit in the body or in the brain (Margules, 1988). Bound to
opioid receptors in the gut, in fact, morphine-like endorphins
tend to conserve bodily resources (by inducing constipation
and water retention), reduce motor activity, decrease pain,
suppress both reproduction hormones and sexual desire. Bound
to opioid receptors in the brain, on the contrary, they promote
energy expenditure, boosting reactivity and (hyper)activity.
The former could be interpreted as a passive, hibernation-like
response to seasonal food shortage; the latter as an active,
migration-inducing one (Margules, 1988; see also Guisinger,
2003). The potential connection between a malfunctioning
opioid system and eating disorders such as anorexia has not gone
unnoticed—and it is supported by several lines of evidence (see
Yeomans and Gray, 2002). Notably, endorphins are produced on
demand, but exorphins are generated at virtually every (modern)
meal.
Food exorphins appear to perform their job largely or
entirely from the gut. Thus, they should support energy sparing
in all kinds of manners (see evidence for some of these in
Teschemacher, 2003). Yet exorphins directly bind to the opioid
receptors of the brain as well, if they can get there (Kostyra
et al., 2004). The question is whether they pass through the
intestinal and blood-brain barriers in meaningful amounts. Some
authors argue that, if these barriers are healthy, they probably
do not (Miner-Williams et al., 2014). This is hardly reassuring,
though, given how easily the function of even healthy barriers
can be disrupted—be it by stress (Söderholm and Perdue,
2001), dietary components (Ulluwishewa et al., 2011), alcohol
(Purohit et al., 2008), or familiar over-the-counter drugs (e.g.,
Smale and Bjarnason, 2003). Indeed, radioactively labeled gluten
proteins fed to rats by stomach tube are later found in the
animals’ brains in the form of exorphins (Hemmings, 1978; for
related evidence regarding dairy proteins, see Sun and Cade,
1999).
The manufacture of exorphins is incredibly efficient. The
nutritionally insignificant intake of 1 g of casein (about two
tablespoons of cow milk), for example, produces opioids in
large enough amounts to exert physiological effects (Meisel and
FitzGerald, 2000). This is remarkable in view of the facts that
(a) the opioids from gluten are stronger than those from casein
(Zioudrou et al., 1979), and (b) the daily average consumption
of gluten in Europe is 10–20 g, with many people exceeding 50 g
(Sapone et al., 2012). In the brain of rats, the opioids from casein
have been shown to be 10 times more potent than morphine
(Herrera-Marschitz et al., 1989). If all exorphins released in the
gut made it to the brain, it is hard to see how we could keep
functioning.
Opioids are involved in both the palatability and rewarding
aspects of food, hence they play a major role in food cravings
and food addiction (for a review, see Yeomans and Gray, 2002).
The opioid antagonist naloxone drastically reduces the intake
of preferred foods, but not of nonpreferred ones, in rats (Glass
et al., 1996; see also Boggiano et al., 2005). Naltrexone, which
is much like naloxone but it lasts longer and can be taken
by mouth, suppresses binge eating in humans (Marrazzi et al.,
1995). Indeed, people who have first ingested naltrexone (against
placebo: Yeomans and Gray, 1997) rate a bowl of pasta as less
pleasant, and eat less of it. Tellingly, naloxone is famed for its
ability to counteract the effects of an overdose of heroin, a potent
derivative of morphine, and naltrexone is used in the treatment
of heroin dependence.
Foods that contain exorphins, such as wheat and dairy
products, have indeed a reputation for being rewarding and
people find it extremely hard to give them up. The addictive
properties of milk were arguably designed by evolution to gratify
suckling young. The gut of newborns is highly permeable—not
only to the mother’s antibodies as an aid to their still immature
immune system, but also to milk opioids (see Teschemacher,
2003). Yet, production of the enzyme for properly digesting milk
is genetically programmed to stop after weaning. Regular intake
of milk by adults is evolutionarily novel and only started with
animal domestication; it was permitted by a mutation of this
enzyme in populations that kept cattle. Interestingly and perhaps
worryingly, the opioids in bovine milk are 10 times stronger than
those in human milk (Herrera-Marschitz et al., 1989). This might
not be extraneous to the fact that about half of children up to
Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

 Bressan and Kramer
Bread and Mental Disease
4 years of age need their milk bottle to fall asleep at night (in
Thailand: Sawasdivorn et al., 2008). Note that, as mentioned, the
opioids in wheat are even stronger than those in bovine milk
(Zioudrou et al., 1979).
Arguably, foodstuffs whose digestion releases exorphins are
preferred exactly because of their drug-like properties. It has
been speculated, in fact, that this chemical reward might have
been one incentive for the initial adoption of agriculture (Wadley
and Martin, 1993). Why cereals rapidly and extensively replaced
traditional foods even though they were less nutritious and
required more labor has been widely regarded as a puzzle. Also,
cultivation of cereals continued even when the abundance of
more easily processed foodstuffs—such as meat, tubers, and
fruit—rendered it unnecessary (see Murphy, 2007). A clue
could be the fact that all major civilizations, in every inhabited
continent, arose in groups that practiced cereal agriculture and
not in groups that only cultivated tubers and vegetables or
had no agriculture at all. According to Wadley and Martin’s
rather audacious hypothesis, daily opioid self-administration
could have increased people’s tolerance of crowded sedentary
conditions, of regular work, of subjugation by rulers. If so,
cereals might have ultimately helped the development of
civilization.
Too Much Exorphin in the Wrong Place
Not all individuals handle these substances the same way. For
example, abnormally high levels of milk and/or wheat exorphins
have been found in the urine (Hole et al., 1979) and blood
(Drysdale et al., 1982) of schizophrenia patients and in the urine
(e.g., Sokolov et al., 2014; but see Cass et al., 2008) of autistic
children. When purified and injected in the brain of rats, these
substances made the rats behave in strikingly odd ways—very
restless at first and then inactive and hyperdefensive. Among
other things, the rats paid no attention to a ringing bell, in
suggestive similarity to the apparent deafness often observed in
children with autism (Sun and Cade, 1999; Cade et al., 2000).
Interestingly for the nonpatients among us, exorphins coming
from healthy people’s blood had on rats effects that were weaker
and briefer but otherwise similar (Drysdale et al., 1982).
Besides producing behavioral disorders similar to those
seen in schizophrenia and autism (such as decreased social
interaction, reduced pain sensitivity, uncontrolled motor activity:
Sun and Cade, 1999), exorphins activate in rats the same brain
regions that are affected in schizophrenia and autism. The
disruptive effects they exert on visual and auditory areas are
consistent with typical malfunctionings such as hallucinations in
schizophrenia (Sun et al., 1999). So perhaps it is no coincidence
that a recent case report of an adult patient has described
complete resolution of highly unsettling visual and auditory
hallucinations, experienced daily from early childhood, upon
removal of gluten from the diet (Genuis and Lobo, 2014).
The
effects
of
food
exorphins
on
behavior
(for
a
comprehensive review, see Lister et al., 2015) and on the brain
(Sun et al., 1999) are reversed by treating the rats with opioid
antagonists. Naloxone has also been shown to temporarily erase
psychotic symptoms, especially hallucinations, in schizophrenia
patients (Emrich et al., 1977; Jørgensen and Cappelen, 1982).
Naltrexone benefits some children with autism (Roy et al.,
2015), arguably by blocking a brain opioid activity that might
be abnormally high in these children (Sahley and Panksepp,
1987). Attempts to eliminate excess exorphins from the blood of
schizophrenia patients via weekly dialysis for 1 year have led to
remarkable results as well, with 40% of patients vastly improving
or fully recovering from schizophrenia. In some patients who
did not get better, the continuous production and absorption of
exorphins on a regular diet might have been so large that dialysis
failed to reduce their concentration in the blood. Indeed, of the
five patients that combined dialysis with a diet devoid of gluten
and casein, all either improved significantly or became entirely
normal (Cade et al., 2000).
In psychotic children (Gillberg et al., 1985), schizophrenia
patients (Lindström et al., 1986), and women with postpartum
psychosis (Lindström et al., 1984), larger-than-normal amounts
of exorphins have been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid.
Exorphins clearly do not belong there. In the presence of
faulty barriers, though, they could migrate from the gut to
the blood (prompting an immune reaction) and from there to
the cerebrospinal fluid. In people with schizophrenia (unlike
in healthy individuals) the more antibodies against gluten one
finds in the blood, the more one finds in the cerebrospinal
fluid (Severance et al., 2015). This correlation suggests a
larger diffusion of antibodies from one place to the other
in patients than in nonpatients, pointing to some barrier
dysregulation—possibly subtle or transient. It is worth recalling
that gluten comes prepackaged with the ability to cause such
dysregulation itself.
DIET AS A CURE
Evidence that a diet devoid of wheat (and possibly of dairy as
well, given the similarity between gluten and casein) can cure
some patients with mental illness has been available for nearly
50 years. Yet because other patients—especially in newer and
better studies—have not changed on the diet, such evidence has
been variously downplayed, discredited, or dismissed. As a result,
the message has made it neither to patients and their caretakers
nor to psychologists and psychiatrists. After looking at all of these
dietary intervention studies, we have come to believe that this
lack of communication is a mistake.
Most studies have been run on schizophrenia patients kept in
psychiatric wards, where meals could be tightly supervisioned.
Patients on a grain-and-milk-free diet were either discharged or
transferred from a locked to an open ward sooner than patients
on a grain-rich diet (Dohan et al., 1969; Dohan and Grasberger,
1973). The effect was canceled when, blind to both patients
and staff, the grain-and-milk-free diet was supplemented with
gluten. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, longitudinal study
with very similar results was impressive enough to get into
the journal Science (Singh and Kay, 1976). Here schizophrenia
patients kept on a grain-and-milk-free diet worsened on 30 out
of 39 behavioral measures when a ‘‘special drink’’ they were given
daily contained gluten and recovered when it contained soy flour
instead.

Bread and Mental Disease
Abstention
from
gluten
and
casein,
especially
when
protracted for several months, also benefits a proportion of
children with autism spectrum disorders (for a review, see
Whiteley et al., 2013). In one study that followed 70 such
children who had not previously responded to any therapy, this
proportion reached, after 3 months on the diet, an impressive
80% (Cade et al., 2000).
In gluten-sensitive people, long-term wheat consumption
could potentially lead to permanent damage (Kalaydjian et al.,
2006; Hadjivassiliou et al., 2010); thus one does not necessarily
anticipate change in chronic patients. Still, on gluten-free
diets, clear improvements in psychiatric symptoms have been
observed in severely disturbed schizophrenia patients who were
unresponsive to any form of treatment and had spent much of
their lives in institutions (Rice et al., 1978; Vlissides et al., 1986;
see also Cade et al., 2000). Some of these patients worsened
dramatically as soon as gluten was reintroduced.
Improvement in mental health on a gluten-free diet should,
of course, only be expected for individuals that have an adverse
physical reaction to wheat, expressed for example as gluten-
related antibodies. Indeed, in a small study on eight chronic
schizophrenia patients who were shown not to react to gluten,
none improved on a gluten-and-milk-free diet (Potkin et al.,
1981). To date, only case studies have focused specifically on
the subset of patients that is demonstrably sensitive to wheat.
In each and every case, the results of a gluten-free diet have
been impressive. Clear improvement has been observed in two
patients with schizophrenia (Jackson et al., 2012b) and two with
dementia (Lurie et al., 2008). Full recoveries have been separately
reported for three patients with severe psychotic symptoms (De
Santis et al., 1997; Eaton et al., 2015; Lionetti et al., 2015).
Ironically, the greater the potential benefit of a change in diet,
the greater the resistance to it may be (Wadley and Martin, 1993).
Grain’s exorphins can create addiction. It has been estimated that
half of the people that are hypersensitive crave the very food
that causes them harm and experience withdrawal symptoms
when they remove it from their diet (Brostoff and Gamlin, 1989).
Remarkably, one untreatable, high-security-ward schizophrenia
patient who had made a miraculous recovery on a gluten-free
diet became violent and extremely disturbed when gluten was
reintroduced. At that point, he was unable or unwilling to
resume the gluten-free diet that would save him (Vlissides et al.,
1986).
CONCLUSION
We have shown that in all of us bread makes the gut wall more
permeable, encouraging the migration of toxins and undigested
food particles to sites where they can alert the immune system.
We have shown that in all of us the digestion of grain and dairy
generates opioid-like compounds, and that these cause mental
derangement if they make it to the brain.
Together, these pieces of evidence prompt the question of
why not all of us develop psychotic symptoms on a diet of bread
and milk. One plausible answer (Severance et al., 2015) is that
the individuals who ultimately come down with these symptoms
might be carrying an ‘‘immune defect’’ such that exorphins, once
in the blood, either attract too much attention from the immune
system or escape detection altogether. The resulting antibodies
(in the former case) or the exorphins themselves (in the latter)
could then gain access to the brain. They would arrive there from
the bloodstream, either directly or via the cerebrospinal fluid, by
way of faulty barriers. An alternative idea is that the genetic defect
is not in the immune system, but in the enzymes involved in
breaking down exorphins in either the gut or the blood (Dohan,
1980; see also Reichelt et al., 1996).
Even though wheat causes them serious harm, most
individuals with celiac disease are unaware they have the illness,
and for the rest of us no test is currently available that can
conclusively reveal whether we are hypersensitive to wheat. The
evidence is overpowering, though, that such hypersensitivity can
bring with it mental disturbances like schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, depression, anxiety, and autism. Patients who have
been demonstrated to be hypersensitive have either improved
substantially or even been cured completely of their mental
symptoms on a wheat-and-dairy-free diet. For all the others,
wheat-sensitivity tests notwithstanding, we advocate trying the
elimination of wheat and dairy or at least gluten and casein—for
diagnostic purposes if nothing else. Unlike with pharmacological
treatments, there have been no reports of harmful side effects.
Actually, contrary to common wisdom, whole grains rank next
to last in nutrient density among food groups (Cordain et al.,
2005); they are nutrient-dense only in their raw, inedible state
(Lalonde, 2012). Hence, replacing grains with vegetables, fruit
and nuts, meats, and seafood actually increases the vitamin and
mineral content of the diet.
Bread is the very symbol of food, and learning that it
can threaten our mental wellbeing may come as a shock to
many. Yet bread is not alone; like it, other foodstuffs, such
as milk, rice, and corn, release exorphins during digestion.
Wheat, rice, and corn are the staples of over 4 billion
people. Another popular substance, sugar, is prominent in
many of our supermarket products and hidden in a myriad
others. While not a source of exorphins, sugar provokes the
release of endorphins and can induce—with addiction-associated
neurophysiological changes—impressive craving, bingeing, and
withdrawal problems (Ahmed et al., 2013).
Psychologists and psychiatrists typically pay much attention
to their patients’ aberrant eating habits. They may wish to keep
an eye on their normal eating habits as well.

Conflict of Interest Statement: The authors declare that the research was
conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could
be construed as a potential conflict of interest.
Despite currently receiving royalties from a publication based on the use of dietary
intervention for autism and related conditions and being a shareholder of an
online company that provides dietary information about the use of a gluten and
casein free diet, the Reviewer PW and handling Editor declare that the process
nevertheless met the standards of a fair and objective review.
