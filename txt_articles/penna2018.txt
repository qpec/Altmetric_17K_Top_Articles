Objective: To determine the incidence of anastomotic-related morbidity
following Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision (TaTME) and identify inde-
pendent risk factors for failure.
Background: Anastomotic leak and its sequelae are dreaded complications
following gastrointestinal surgery. TaTME is a recent technique for rectal
resection, which includes novel anastomotic techniques.
Methods: Prospective study of consecutive reconstructed TaTME cases
recorded over 30 months in 107 surgical centers across 29 countries. Primary
endpoint was ‘‘anastomotic failure,’’defined as a composite endpoint of early or
delayed leak, pelvic abscess, anastomotic fistula, chronic sinus, or anastomotic
stricture. Multivariate regression analysis performed identifying independent
risk factors of anastomotic failure and an observed risk score developed.
Results: One thousand five hundred ninety-four cases with anastomotic recon-
struction were analyzed; 96.6% performed for cancer. Median anastomotic
height from anal verge was 3.0� 2.0 cm with stapled techniques accounting for
66.0%. The overall anastomotic failure rate was 15.7%. This included early
(7.8%) and delayed leak (2.0%), pelvic abscess (4.7%), anastomotic fistula
(0.8%), chronic sinus (0.9%), and anastomotic stricture in 3.6% of cases.
Independent risk factors of anastomotic failure were: male sex, obesity,
smoking, diabetes mellitus, tumors >25mm, excessive intraoperative blood
loss, manual anastomosis, and prolonged perineal operative time. A scoring
system for preoperative risk factors was associated with observed rates of
anastomotic failure between 6.3% to 50% based on the cumulative score.
Conclusions: Large tumors in obese, diabetic male patients who smoke have
the highest risk of anastomotic failure. Acknowledging such risk factors can
guide appropriate consent and clinical decision-making that may reduce
anastomotic-related morbidity.

A
nastomotic leakage (AL) is a common and potentially devastat-
ing complication of a colorectal anastomosis and can result in
severe morbidity and mortality, as well as long-term anorectal
dysfunction.1 Additionally, AL has been reported to increase the
risk of local cancer recurrence,2 with reduction in overall and
disease-free survival.3–5 AL can markedly impair a patient’s quality
of life and is detrimental to the doctor–patient relationship,6 partic-
ularly as AL can result in prolonged sequelae including anastomotic
fistulae, chronic sinuses, and anastomotic strictures. The reported
incidence of AL after colorectal surgery is between 2 and 24%,7–10
with the highest rates after low anterior resection.11,12 The clinical
manifestations, and severity, of AL encompass a broad spectrum of
symptoms, and signs, from minor symptoms, to major life-
threatening events.
As a consequence of technical developments, particularly
stapling instruments, but also minimal access techniques, in com-
bination with widespread adoption of total mesorectal excision as
the standard treatment for rectal cancer, the rate of sphincter-
preserving surgery with low anastomoses has significantly risen.
The reduction in abdomino-perineal excision rates, with an increase
in low anastomoses, has led to an increased overall leakage rate in
patients with rectal cancer.13 Technical drawbacks of minimal
access intracorporal anastomosis include the lack of direct tactile
sensation, inadequate exposure, and a suboptimal cutting angle of
the endo-linear stapler. Crossing staple lines by repeated firings, or
incorrect staple height in relation to tissue thickness increases the
risk of AL, especially when 3 or more linear staple firings are
needed.14,15 Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) is the
latest advanced surgical access technique for pelvic dissection and
facilitates different anastomotic techniques without the need for
transabdominal rectal transection, particularly in a narrow pelvis.
The standard TaTME technique incorporates an open rectal stump
with continuity restored by a coloanal handsewn or double purse-
string stapled anastomosis.16 As TaTME adoption increases, careful
monitoring and review of outcomes is crucial. Identification of risk
factors for AL and overall anastomotic failure may guide preopera-
tive optimization and intraoperative surgical decision-making,
adopting measures to reduce risk and consequences of AL, such
as selective defunctioning stomas. This is even more important
when a novel anastomotic technique is being implemented into
clinical practice.
The primary aim of this study was to report ‘‘anastomotic
failure’’ rates and incidence of anastomosis-related morbidity in

patients following TaTME surgical procedures recorded on the
international TaTME registry. The secondary aim was to identify
potential risk factors associated with anastomotic failure.
METHODS
Study Design
Cases recorded on the international TaTME registry17
between July 2014 and December 2016 by 107 surgical centers in
29 different countries (Appendix 1) were analyzed. The registry is a
secure online database open to all international surgeons performing
TaTME, as previously described.18 All contributing surgeons were
invited via emails to update their records with 2 subsequent
reminders to obtain up-to-date data and minimize missing fields.
Contributing surgeons were contacted individually to clarify any
unexpected or ambiguous data. The primary endpoint of the study
was ‘‘anastomotic failure’’ rate, defined as the overall incidence of
anastomotic-related morbidity, including early and late AL, pelvic
abscess, anastomotic-related fistula, chronic sinus, and persistent
anastomotic stricture after primary rectal resection. ‘‘Early’’ anasto-
motic leak was defined as a symptomatic leak diagnosed and
managed within 30 days of the primary resection. Anastomotic leaks
were
classified
according
to
the
‘‘International
Study
Group of Rectal Cancer’’ definition and severity grading system
(Appendix 2).19
Statistical Analysis
All categorical data are presented as number of cases and
percentages, while continuous data are shown as either mean � stan-
standard deviation (range) or median with range. Categorical vari-
ables were compared by the Pearson Chi2 test, and continuous
variables by the 2-sample t test or Mann–Whitney U test where
appropriate. Risk factors were divided into patient, tumor-related
factors, and technical intraoperative factors. Continuous variables
were dichotomized using the median or the value at which a
significant change occurred as a cut-off point. Variables that achieved
a P value of �0�100 on univariate analysis were selected for the
multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of anasto-
motic failure and early AL. Median and mean imputation was used to
adjust for missing values where appropriate and first-order inter-
actions tested in the multivariate model. A P value <0�05 was
considered statistically significant and odds ratios (OR) and their
95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. The b coefficients (log
odds ratios) derived from the multivariate analysis were used as
weights in the derivation of the anastomotic failure observed risk
score. Multilevel logistic regression model was used to adjust for
possible clustering of anastomotic failure within centers. The Statis-
tical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) of IBM Statistics, version
24, was used for the analysis.
RESULTS
A total of 1836 cases were recorded on the TaTME registry
over a 30-month period. The indication for surgery was rectal cancer
in 1663 (90.6%) patients and benign pathology in 173 (9.4%).
Overall, 1594 of 1836 (86.8%) cases had an anastomosis and will
be the focus of the results presented in this paper. Of the remaining
242 nonrestorative procedures, 236 were planned as such, leaving 6
(0.4%) cases in which the anastomosis was abandoned (Supplemen-
tary Table 1, http://links.lww.com/SLA/B360).
Patient and Tumor Characteristics
Table 1 outlines patient and tumor characteristics. The major-
ity of registered cases were male patients with a median (range) age
of 65 (19–93) years and median (range) body mass index (BMI) of
26.0 (15.6–44.2) kg/m2. In total 275 patients (17.3%) had previous
unrelated abdominal surgery, including 21 (1.3%) prior prostatec-
tomy. Twelve patients (0.8%) had received pelvic radiotherapy prior
to diagnosis of rectal cancer. The indication for surgery was rectal
cancer in 1540 (96.6%) of reconstructed cases with a median tumor
height from anorectal junction on staging MRI of 4.0 (0–14) cm.
Radiological cancer staging was reported as stage 0, I, II, III, and IV
in 17 (1.2%), 267 (19.5%), 287 (20.9%), 689 (50.2%), and 112
(8.2%) cases respectively. Preoperative involvement of the circum-
ferential resection margin was seen on 274 (23.4%) staging MRI
scans and 895 (56.1) patients received neoadjuvant therapy; the
majority as long course chemoradiotherapy.
Intraoperative Details
Operative details are summarized in Table 2, showing that the
commonest operation performed was a low anterior resection in 89%,
with synchronous operating by 2 teams in 41.7%. The abdominal
phase was performed laparoscopically in 1350 (86.3%); with SILS,
open surgery, and robotic approaches in 179 (11.4%), 26 (1.7%), and
10 (0.6%), respectively. The recorded estimated blood loss was 0 to
99 mL in 42.3% and 100 to 499 mL in 21.1%. In 32 (2.1%) blood

loss > 500 mL was reported, mainly due to pelvic bleeding and
splenic hemorrhage following splenic flexure mobilization. The
specimen was extracted transanally in 43.9%, while abdominal
extraction was utilized in the remainder either via Pfannenstiel
incision (26.6%), iliac fossa/stoma site (14.8%), umbilical opening
(6.7%), or the laparotomy incision (8.0%). A pelvic drain was
inserted in 1134 patients (71.1%).
The
commonest
anastomotic
technique
performed
was
mechanical stapling in 66% with an end-to-end or side-to-end
configuration in 94% of cases (Table 2). The stapler diameters used
included 25 to 28 mm, 29 mm, 31 to 32 mm, and 33 mm in 14.5%,
22.3%, 17.4%, and 45.8% respectively.
Intraoperative adverse events occurred in 487 of 1594 (30.6%).
Conversion to an alternative technique was required in 90 patients
(5.6%). Abdominal access conversion was primarily required due to
limited visualization secondary to excessive adhesions and obesity,
while perineal conversions occurred after difficulty identifying the
correct dissection plane leading to bleeding and/or visceral injuries.
Twelve cases underwent both perineal to abdominal, and minimal
access to open abdominal conversions, and were predominantly men
(11/12) with a higher BMI (mean 27.1� 3.9 kg/m2). Table 2 outlines
the incidence of technical transanal difficulties and adverse events. A
total of 41 visceral injuries were recorded during both abdominal and
transanal phases; 12 (0.8%) urethral injuries, 7 (0.4%) rectal tube
perforation, 5 (0.3%) vaginal perforations, 5 (0.3%) ureteric injuries, 5
(0.3%) enterotomies, 3 (0.2%) bladder perforations, 2 (0.1%) hypo-
gastric nerve divisions, 1 (0.06%) splenic injury with significant
hemorrhage, and 1 (0.06%) diaphragmatic perforation during splenic
flexure
mobilization.
Anastomosis-related
technical
difficulties
included anastomotic defects requiring additional handsewn sutures
(n ¼ 12), complete re-do of the anastomosis due to ischemia (2) or
rectal tear (1). Further intraoperative complications included injury to
the mesenteric vascular arcade during attempted transanal specimen
extraction, carbon dioxide embolism with hemodynamic instability,
and intraoperative myocardial infarction.
Postoperative Outcomes and Anastomosis-related
Morbidity
The median length of hospital stay was 8 days (range 2–94),
with morbidity and mortality rates within 30 days of the primary
resection of 35.4% and 0.6% respectively. Overall, 44 deaths (2.8%)
have been reported over a mean follow-up period of 14 months (range
3–68). Postoperative complications within 30 days, categorized
according to the Clavien–Dindo classification20 as I/II, III, IV,
and V, occurred in 354 (22.2%), 188 (11.8%), 13 (0.8%), and 9
(0.6%) patients respectively. Emergency surgical reintervention for
any cause within 30 days or index admission was required in 128
(8.0%) (Supplementary Table 2, http://links.lww.com/SLA/B360:
Summary of emergency operations).
Table 3 outlines the incidence of anastomosis-related morbid-
ity, showing an overall anastomotic failure rate of 15.7%. Early AL,
diagnosed within 30 days of the primary resection, occurred in 124
(7.8%) patients; 68 (61.3%) of these were managed by active
therapeutic intervention without the need for a relaparotomy (Grade
B). Overall 311 of 1594 (19.5%) patients required a reintervention
(surgical, endoscopic, or radiological) for any cause at some point
during the study period, while 135 of 311 (43.4%) of these patients
required a reintervention for anastomotic failure. A total of 141
reinterventions for failure were reported during the study period. The
majority, 108 of 141 (76.6%), of reinterventions for anastomotic
failure involved surgery under general anesthesia, with either exam-
ination of the anastomosis with washout � vacuum therapy, resutur-
ing for anastomotic dehiscence, laparoscopic lavage � defunctioning
stoma or as a later reoperation with dilatation or anastomotic

refashioning for anastomotic stricturing. Of 250 patients diagnosed
with anastomotic failure, 219 had a defunctioning stoma created at
the index operation. Gut continuity was restored in 124 (56.6%). The
median interval to stoma closure was 142 days (approx. 41/2 mo),
range 5 to 1638 days. Twelve patients (0.8%) underwent a takedown
of the anastomosis with an end stoma in the form of a Hartmann
procedure for anastomotic leak (11 cases) and a completion proc-
tectomy with end colostomy for a tight anastomotic stricture (1 case).
A further six patients (0.4%) with anastomotic leaks were managed
with laparoscopic washout and formation of a defunctioning stoma.
Histopathological results for the 1540 cancer cases are
described in supplementary Table 3, http://links.lww.com/SLA/
B360. In summary, a curative R0 resection rate was achieved in
95.7%. A positive circumferential resection margin or distal resec-
tion margin was reported in 60 (3.9%) and 10 (0.6%) cases respec-
tively. Major defects in the TME specimen and rectal perforations
were noted in 75 (4.9%) specimens.
Risk Factors for Early Anastomotic Leak
Univariate analysis identified 8 patient-related and 5 technical
risk factors (P value �0.100) for early AL (Table 4). On multivariate
analysis, 7 of these factors remained statistically significant. Patient-
related risk factors included male sex, obesity, smoking (borderline
significance), diabetes, larger tumors (>25mm maximum diameter),
and tumor height >4 cm from anorectal junction on MRI. The only
significant technical risk factor was excessive intraoperative blood loss
of�500mL.Significantlymorecasesthatdidnothaveadefunctioning
stoma developed an early symptomatic AL compared with those who
were defunctioned (12.4% vs. 7.2%, OR 0.547, 95% CI 0.334–0.895,
P¼ 0.015).Althoughunivariateresultssuggestedthatpatientswho did
not receive neoadjuvant therapy were at higher risk of AL and failure
(Tables 4 and 5), these findings were not significant on multivariate
analysis and outcomes would have been confounded by the fact that
significantly more patients who had neoadjuvant treatment were
defunctioned (32.8% vs 58.1%, OR 2.846, 95% CI 2.042–3.967,
P < 0.001). Defunctioning stoma was not included in multivariate
analysis as previous studies have shown that the presence of a
defunctioning stoma may not prevent AL, but rather reduces the
consequences should an AL occur.21 Hence, a defunctioning stoma
is proposed as a strategy to reduce the adverse effects of AL and is
recommended in patients with identified risk factors.
Risk Factors for Anastomotic Failure
Fourteen potential risk factors associated with anastomotic
failure were identified on univariate analysis (Table 5). Eight of these
(5 patient-related and 3 technical factors) remained statistically
significant on multivariate analysis including male patients, obesity,
smoking, diabetes, larger tumors over 25 mm, manual anastomoses,
excessive blood loss of �500 mL, and longer perineal phase opera-
tive time of >1.5 hours. The manual technique significantly
increased the risk of late stricturing (5.9% vs. 2.7%, OR 0.448,
95% CI 0.263–0.762, P ¼ 0.002). The presence of a defunctioning
stoma did not appear to significantly influence the incidence of
anastomotic failure in this cohort (no stoma 17.5% vs. stoma 15.6%
OR 0.872, 95% CI 0.576–1.320, P ¼ 0.516). Multilevel regression
analysis did not demonstrate any significant clustering between
hospitals for anastomotic failure rates, nor alter the significant risk
factors. Figure 1 shows the scoring of patient and tumor-related risk
factors and the associated percentage risk of developing anastomotic
failure observed in this cohort of 1594 patients treated by a TaTME
technique with a low anastomosis.
DISCUSSION
Anastomotic complications can lead to significant early and
long-term morbidity, with a possible adverse impact on cancer
outcomes.2,22,23 Identifying high-risk patients and implementing
appropriate reduction strategies, through preoperative patient opti-
mization, technical considerations, and focused postoperative man-
agement with early recognition of adverse signs, are key to
improving patient outcomes.
In contrast to abdominal rectal resections that usually employ
a stapled distal transection, TaTME involves a transanal endoscopic
full rectotomy, with an open rectal stump. A number of stapled and
handsewn techniques have been reported to perform an anastomosis
after TaTME.16 Most reports have small patient numbers with
little data on the morbidity associated with anastomoses following
TaTME.
Results from the recently commenced randomized controlled
trials comparing TaTME with laparoscopic TME may provide some
robust data in the future, should sufficient numbers be enrolled.24,25
Currently, the international TaTME registry17 provides the largest
cohort of TaTME cases performed in the wider surgical community,
allowing analysis and monitoring of outcomes, and incorporating
outcomes from units with different levels of surgical experience. In
this study 1594 TaTME cases with an anastomosis were analyzed,
with an early leak rate of 7.8%. This value is higher than the
previously published rate of 5.4% in the initial 720 registry cases18

and could be explained by an increased complexity of cases per-
formed transanally, wider adoption of TaTME by surgeons at the start
of their learning curve, or improved recording and reporting of
adverse events on the registry. Over the last year, the number of
surgical centers joining the registry has almost doubled with approx-
imately 32 cases recorded per month and 35% of centers having
performed less than 5 TaTME cases. Nonetheless, the leak rate
remains within an acceptable range comparable to previously
reported incidences in colorectal surgery.7–10 Similarly, the overall
morbidity rate of 35.4% is within recognized rates comparable to
conventional abdominal TME surgery, especially when we take into
account the majority of cases selected for TaTME are the more
difficult low rectal cancer cases.
Although higher leak rates have been attributed to low surgical
volume,26,27 Hyman et al28 found that even in a group of high-volume
surgeons, leak rates still ranged from 1.6 to 9.9%; despite more
surgical experience and high caseload. This variation may be due to
the multifactorial etiology and contributing factors that lead to AL,
including both nonmodifiable and modifiable patient and tumor-
related risk factors. Independent risk factors identified in previous
studies include male sex, smoking, obesity, preoperative radiother-
apy, emergency surgery, and tumor-related factors such as distal
infraperitoneal tumors, larger tumor size, and advanced tumor
stage.13,19,29–31 Our study found similar factors to be significant
for AL and overall anastomotic failure, in particular male diabetic
smokers with large tumors. Sorensen et al32 reported that smoking
impairs tissue healing through nicotine-induced vasoconstriction,
reduced perfusion, and carbon-monoxide-induced cellular hypoxia,
leading to reduced tissue oxygen and collagen deposition. Diabetes
also impacts wound healing as uncontrolled hyperglycemia leads to
vascular damage, resulting in decreased blood flow and cellular
accumulation of toxic glucose-derived metabolites.33
A recent meta-analysis by Qu et al reported 4 intraoperative
factors significantly associated with increased risk of AL, including
longer operative time, number of stapler firings >2, intraoperative
transfusions/blood loss >100 mL, and anastomotic level of <5 cm
from anal verge.31 In TaTME, the distal rectal transection does not
involve multiple stapler firings and so eliminates this potential risk
factor. However, excessive blood loss and longer operative time were
also found to be important factors following TaTME. Interestingly,
anastomotic height appeared to be associated with AL only on
univariate analysis (but not overall anastomotic failure) and a higher
rate of AL occurred in anastomoses at a level of >3 cm from anal
verge. Similarly, higher tumors located >4 cm from the anorectal
junction on MRI were found to pose a greater risk of leakage than
lower tumors, and this remained significant on multivariate analysis.
Colorectal surgeons are likely to have less experience in performing a
transanal pursestring on an open rectal stump at a higher distance
from the anal verge prior to stapled anastomosis in their early phase
of the learning curve for TaTME. The lower stapled anastomoses can

also be reinforced with additional handsewn sutures that would be
difficult to place more proximally, and any leakage through a lower
anastomosis is more likely to discharge transanally rather than
accumulating intra-abdominally with symptomatic sepsis.
The evidence regarding manual versus stapled techniques is
more conflicting with no significant differences in AL rates, stricture,
and mortality in colorectal anastomoses reported in a Cochrane
review and recent meta-analysis.34,35 Cong et al36 did find signifi-
cantly lower rates of AL and stricture formation following stapled
compared with handsewn coloanal anastomoses after intersphinc-
teric resection. Similarly, our results suggest that the odds of
developing anastomotic failure, in particular anastomotic stricture,
is 30% less likely if a stapled anastomosis is performed; although no
association was noted with early AL. Depending on the degree of
anastomotic stricturing, multiple interventions may be required
including anastomotic dilatation, re-do anastomoses, or even con-
version to a permanent stoma; all of which contribute to long-term
morbidity and increased healthcare costs.
Reassuringly, 82% of TaTME patients diagnosed with an early
AL were successfully managed without the need for a laparotomy.
Overall 20.7% were managed conservatively and 61.3% underwent
active reintervention without requiring laparotomy. Similar findings
were reported by Kim et al37 in patients with AL following minimally
invasive (laparoscopic and robotic) anterior resection, with 19.7%
undergoing a second open operation, while 69% and 11.3% had
laparoscopic reintervention and transanal surgery respectively. The
benefits of a less invasive approach, where feasible, compared with a
laparotomy for AL after initial laparoscopic surgery were reported in
2 retrospective cohort studies38,39 with shorter intensive care stay,
shorter time to first diet, and earlier stoma functioning.
Reduction strategies and treatment algorithms for anastomotic
failure have been developed and proposed by numerous authors and
surgical societies.7,21,40,41 The risk factors and the preoperative
observed risk scoring reported in this study can aid the perioperative
planning for patients undergoing TaTME. The observed risk score
does however require validation which is planned on an external
patient cohort in the future. Preoperative optimization with tighter
glycemic control for diabetics, weight loss for the obese, and active
smoking cessation programs can be initiated immediately, especially
if more time is available during neoadjuvant treatment or prior to
nonurgent benign resections. Operative strategies, such as the for-
mation of a defunctioning stoma, pelvic drain placement, and use of
fluorescence angiography,42 if available to assess bowel perfusion,
should be considered intraoperatively, especially if the risk score
proposed here is high. Although accurate prediction of risk is
impossible, appreciation of these factors may help with the discus-
sion and decision-making with the patient as to whether an anasto-
mosis should even be attempted, especially in the context of poor pre-
existing bowel function and/or poor physiological reserve to cope
with anastomotic failure.
The limitations of this study include the potential for reporting
bias and human error in recording registry data. Postoperative
complications, in particular, may be difficult to capture, especially
if patients attend a different hospital or are treated in the community.
Thus, longer term outcomes are likely to be under-reported. Differ-
ences in the investigative methods to diagnose anastomosis-related
pathology may further under-report the true incidence or increase
heterogeneity among groups. Early leaks were also more likely to
have been identified clinically and, we therefore cannot address the
question of occult or subclinical leaks. However, the main intention
was to determine the incidence of symptomatic leaks and to identify
potential risk factors. Although the TaTME registry captures over
200 variables, certain factors that may influence anastomotic healing,
such as perioperative fluid management and use of vasopressors, are
not recorded. Nonetheless, at present, this registry is the largest
TaTME database available and encompasses the wider surgical
community performing the technique worldwide with an open and
transparent collaborative.
In conclusion, anastomosis-related complications cause sig-
nificant morbidity and are an ongoing challenge. New and modified
anastomotic techniques have been developed to address the open
stump following TaTME.16 Analysis of the risk factors identified in
this study for AL and longer term anastomotic failure aids perioper-
ative management and decision making tailored to the patient to
reduce and mitigate complications. Further research is required to
determine the learning curve associated with TaTME and the optimal
training pathway43–45 to further reduce the occurrence of adverse
events and to optimize the benefits of this novel access technique.

APPENDIX 2: Definitions and References of Variable Parameters Used
Parameter
Definition
Anastomotic Leak
Classified according to the ‘International Study Group of Rectal Cancer’ definition19 stating that ‘‘anastomotic leakage
should be defined as a defect of the intestinal wall at the anastomotic site (including suture and staple lines of
neorectal reservoirs) leading to a communication between the intra- and extraluminal compartments.’’
Anastomotic Leak
Severity Grading
System
Classified according to the ‘International Study Group of Rectal Cancer’ severity grading system 19 stating that
‘‘Severity of anastomotic leakage should be graded according to the impact on clinical management. Grade A
anastomotic leakage results in no change in patients’ management, whereas grade B leakage requires active
therapeutic intervention but is manageable without re-laparotomy. Grade C anastomotic leakage requires re-
laparotomy’’.
Anastomotic Failure
The combined rate of early and delayed anastomotic leaks, pelvic abscesses, chronic sinuses, anastomotic fistulae and
strictures.
Abdominal
conversion
Conversion from a laparoscopic or robotic approach to an open or transanal approach.
Perineal conversion
Conversion from a transanal approach to the mesorectal dissection to an abdominal approach; either open, laparoscopic
or robotic.
Positive Distal
resection margin,
DRM
Presence of tumor cells within 1 mm from the excised distal end of the specimen.
Positive
Circumferential
resection margin,
CRM
Presence of tumor cells within 1 mm from the excised nonperitonealized surface of the rectum.
Resection status
R0 – fully resected tumor
R1 – microscopic presence of tumor cells at the distal or circumferential resection margins or within a lymph node
<1 mm from the mesorectal fascia.
R2 – Macroscopically incomplete tumor resection.
Quality of TME
specimen
Using the Quirke grading system for completeness of mesorectal dissection,�,y each TME specimen is graded as having
either an intact mesorectum, minor or major defects.
�Nagtegaal ID, van de Velde CJ, van der Worp E, et al. Macroscopic evaluation of rectal cancer resection specimen: clinical significance of the pathologist in quality control. J Clin
Oncol 2002;20:1729–34.
yQuirke P, Steele R, Monson J, et al. Effect of the plane of surgery achieved on local recurrence in patients with operable rectal cancer: a prospective study using data from the MRC
CR07 and NCIC-CTG CO16 randomised clinical trial. Lancet 2002;373:821–8.
DRM indicates distal resection margin; TME, total mesorectal excision.
