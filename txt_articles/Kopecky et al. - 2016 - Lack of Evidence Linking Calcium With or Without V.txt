Supplementation to Cardiovascular Disease in Generally Healthy
Adults: A Clinical Guideline From the National Osteoporosis
Foundation and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology

Description: Calcium is the dominant mineral present in bone
and a shortfall nutrient in the American diet. Supplements have
been recommended for persons who do not consume adequate
calcium from their diet as a standard strategy for the prevention
of osteoporosis and related fractures. Whether calcium with or
without vitamin D supplementation is beneficial or detrimental to
vascular health is not known.
Methods: The National Osteoporosis Foundation and American
Society for Preventive Cardiology convened an expert panel to
evaluate the effects of dietary and supplemental calcium on car-
diovascular disease based on the existing peer-reviewed scien-
tific literature. The panel considered the findings of the accom-
panying updated evidence report provided by an independent
evidence review team at Tufts University.
Recommendation: The National Osteoporosis Foundation and
American Society for Preventive Cardiology adopt the position
that there is moderate-quality evidence (B level) that calcium
with or without vitamin D intake from food or supplements has
no relationship (beneficial or harmful) to the risk for cardiovascu-
lar and cerebrovascular disease, mortality, or all-cause mortality
in generally healthy adults at this time. In light of the evidence
available to date, calcium intake from food and supplements that
does not exceed the tolerable upper level of intake (defined by
the National Academy of Medicine as 2000 to 2500 mg/d)
should be considered safe from a cardiovascular standpoint.

C
alcium is a component of the dominant mineral (hy-
droxyapatite) present in bone and a shortfall nutri-
ent in the American diet (1). Supplements have been
recommended for persons who do not consume ade-
quate calcium from their diet as a standard strategy for
the prevention of osteoporosis and related fractures.
The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center at Tufts Uni-
versity published an evidence report in 2009 (2) review-
ing the existing data on the effect of both vitamin D and
calcium on health outcomes, including cardiovascular
disease. Since then, conflicting reports have suggested
that calcium intake, particularly from supplements, may
have either beneficial or harmful effects on cardiovas-
cular outcomes. The National Osteoporosis Foundation
(NOF) contracted an independent evidence review
team at Tufts University to update the 2009 AHRQ evi-
dence report on cardiovascular disease outcomes and
end points (2). The expert panel, informed by the up-
dated report (3), was assembled by the NOF and Amer-
ican Society for Preventive Cardiology (ASPC) and was
ultimately responsible for writing this clinical guideline.
GUIDELINE FOCUS
The focus of this guideline is to provide clinicians
and health professionals with an evidence-based rec-
ommendation about the health risks and benefits of
calcium intake from food or supplements on cardiovas-
cular and cerebrovascular disease incidence, mortality,
and all-cause mortality in generally healthy adults.
GUIDELINE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
To develop this guideline, the NOF and ASPC ad-
hered to the methods previously published by the NOF
(4). The authors served as the expert panel tasked with
evaluating and grading the strength of evidence based
on an externally developed evidence report (3). The
evidence report was developed by the evidence review
team at Tufts University and reflects the peer-reviewed
scientific literature as of 1 July 2016. All members of the
panel and evidence review team have disclosed their
relationships in the prior 2 years (available at www.nof
.org/news/nof-and-aspc-position-statement-on-calcium
-and-cardiovascular-disease), and disclosures were ver-
bally affirmed during the project. The guideline is
based largely on the findings of the evidence report.
The evidence review team presented their findings to
the expert panel via Webcast. Expert panel members
were able to ask questions specific to the evidence re-
port but were not permitted to influence the final study
design or outcomes. An animal and mechanistic study
(5), and comments submitted by scientists and other
scientific bodies during a 14-day public comment pe-
riod ending on 21 June 2016, were considered during

 the development of the final guideline. The expert
panel and authors of the evidence report were blinded
to the funding source for the evidence report (no cor-
porate funds were accepted for development of the
guideline) until both manuscripts were approved by
both societies' boards and submitted for publication.
RECOMMENDATION
Recommendation: The NOF and ASPC adopt the
position that there is moderate-quality evidence (B
level) that calcium with or without vitamin D intake from
food or supplements has no relationship (beneficial or
harmful) with the risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovas-
cular disease, mortality, or all-cause mortality in gener-
ally healthy adults at this time. In light of the evidence
available to date, calcium intake from food and supple-
ments that does not exceed the tolerable upper level of
intake (defined by the National Academy of Medicine as
2000 to 2500 mg/d [6]) should be considered safe from
a cardiovascular standpoint.
Obtaining calcium from food sources is preferred.
Supplemental calcium can be safely used to correct any
shortfalls in intake. Discontinuation of supplemental
calcium for safety reasons is not necessary and may be
harmful to bone health when intake from food is sub-
optimal. This guideline is based on the peer-reviewed
scientific literature as of 1 July 2016 and supports the
findings of the accompanying evidence report (2). In
addition to the evidence report, the panel considered a
recent animal and mechanistic study, which found no
detectable effect of high-calcium diets (for example,
dairy or calcium carbonate) on coronary artery calcium
phosphate deposition in swine with diet-induced met-
abolic syndrome (5). Currently, no established biologi-
cal mechanism supports an association between cal-
cium and cardiovascular disease. This official guideline
was adopted by the boards of directors of both societ-
ies on 22 July 2016.
