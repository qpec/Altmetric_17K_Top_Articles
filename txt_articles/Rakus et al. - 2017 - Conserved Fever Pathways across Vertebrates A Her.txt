SUMMARY
Both endotherms and ectotherms (e.g., fish) increase
their body temperature to limit pathogen infection.
Ectotherms do so by moving to warmer places,
hence the term ‘‘behavioral fever.’’ We studied the
manifestation of behavioral fever in the common
carp infected by cyprinid herpesvirus 3, a native
carp pathogen. Carp maintained at 24�C died from
the infection, whereas those housed in multi-cham-
ber tanks encompassing a 24�C–32�C gradient
migrated transiently to the warmest compartment
and survived as a consequence. Behavioral fever
manifested only at advanced stages of infection.
Consistent with this, expression of CyHV-3 ORF12,
encoding a soluble decoy receptor for TNF-a, de-
layed the manifestation of behavioral fever and
promoted CyHV-3 replication in the context of a tem-
perature gradient. Injection of anti-TNF-a neutral-
izing antibodies suppressed behavioral fever, and
decreased fish survival in response to infection.
This study provides a unique example of how vi-
ruses have evolved to alter host behavior to increase
fitness.
INTRODUCTION
When infected by pathogens, endotherms and ectotherms can
both increase their body temperature to limit the infection. In en-
dotherms, this cardinal response to infection is called fever (for a
recent review, see Evans et al., 2015). It relies mainly on thermo-
genesis, and also on physiological and behavioral modifications
leading to reduced heat loss by the body. With the exception of a
few rare examples, ectotherms lack intrinsic thermogenesis
and so have a body temperature very close to the temperature
of the environment. In a temperature gradient, ectotherms select
a species-specific range of preferred temperature, which is
defined as final thermal preferendum (FTP) (for a recent review,
see Rakus et al., 2017). In response to infection or injection of
exogenous pyrogens, ectotherms can increase their body tem-
perature above their FTP through migration to warmer environ-
ments. This phenomenon is known as behavioral fever and is
defined as an acute increase of the FTP consecutive to an infec-
tion (Rakus et al., 2017). Behavioral fever has been reported in a
broad range of ectotherms including vertebrates (fishes, am-
phibians, and reptiles) and invertebrates.
Regulation of behavioral fever in ectotherms is evolutionarily
related to fever in endotherms at various levels of the relevant
regulatory pathways (Evans et al., 2015; Rakus et al., 2017),
including the roles of exogenous pyrogens as inducers, the
importance of the hypothalamic preoptic area as an integration
site for pyrogenic signals, and the key role of prostaglandins as
effector mediators. However, no study has yet determined
whether this evolutionary relationship extends to the endoge-
nous pyrogens, namely the cytokine mediators that inform
the brain of exogenous pyrogens detected by immune cells
throughout the body. In endotherms, cytokines such as inter-
leukin 1b (IL-1b), IL6, tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), and inter-
ferons (Dinarello, 1999; Netea et al., 2000) have been shown to
act as endogenous pyrogens.
At least in some infectious models, fever in endotherms and
behavioral fever in ectotherms can increase host survival (Evans
et al., 2015; Rakus et al., 2017). This beneficial effect is the

 consequence of the elevation of body temperature, which en-
hances the efficiency of both innate and (when existing) adaptive
immune mechanisms and can restrict replication of invading
pathogens. Through the expression of dedicated genes, patho-
gens are able to manipulate virtually all the physiological pro-
cesses of their host that can affect their replication and transmis-
sion. However, to date, there is no report of a pathogen being
able to affect the expression of behavioral fever by its host.
Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) is the causative agent of a le-
thal, highly contagious and notifiable disease in common and koi
carp (Cyprinus carpio) (Boutier et al., 2015a). The outcome of
CyHV-3 infection is highly dependent on temperature both
in vitro and in vivo, with temperatures between 18�C and 28�C
allowing viral replication in vitro and development of CyHV-3 dis-
ease in vivo, whereas temperatures above 30�C rapidly block
CyHV-3 replication and the development of CyHV-3 disease (Gi-
lad et al., 2003). During our studies of CyHV-3 pathogenesis
(Boutier et al., 2015b), we observed that carp infected at 24�C
(within the FPT of healthy carp) tended to concentrate around
the tank heater when it was running. This observation led us to
hypothesize that infected subjects might express behavioral fe-
ver in natural environments where temperature gradients exist
(Boehrer and Schultze, 2008).
Here, we used the infection of carp by CyHV-3 as a homolo-
gous virus-host model to study the expression of behavioral
fever. We demonstrate the ability of this virus to alter this
behavior of its host through the expression of a single gene
and identify the role of TNF-a as a mediator of behavioral fever
in ectotherms.
RESULTS
Carp Express Behavioral Fever in Response to CyHV-3
Infection
First, we tested the hypothesis that common carp express
behavioral fever in response to CyHV-3 infection. Carp were
housed in multi-chamber tanks (MCTs; Figure 1A) where they
could freely move between three compartments maintained at
24�C, 28�C, and 32�C. Fish distribution in the three compart-
ments was recorded over time (Figure 1B). In the absence of
infection (days �5 to 0), in all six observed MCTs, the majority
of carp were distributed in the 24�C compartment and to a lesser
extent in the 28�C compartment. At day 0, the fish in three MCTs
were infected with CyHV-3, while the three remaining MCTs were
mock-infected. Between 4 and 6 days post-infection (dpi), in-
fected fish began to reside more frequently in the 32�C compart-
ment. This observation is also illustrated in the supplemental file
Movie S1, consisting of a short video shot at 7 dpi (MCTs of
experiment 1). The number of infected fish in the 32�C compart-
ment peaked at around 7–9 dpi. By 13 dpi, the distribution of fish
returned to normal, with only the occasional fish in the 32�C
compartment (Figure 1B). Global statistical analyses of the
data from the three replicates demonstrated that carp infected
by CyHV-3 express behavioral fever as revealed by a signifi-
cantly higher number of fish in the 32�C compartment (p <
0.001) between 6 to 11 dpi. Interestingly, none of the fish infected
with CyHV-3 in the MCTs died during the course of these exper-
iments, suggesting that expression of behavioral fever could be
beneficial for CyHV-3 infected carp.
Expression of Behavioral Fever Is Beneficial for CyHV-3
Infected Carp
Carp were distributed in single chamber tanks (SCT; Figure 1A)
maintained at 24�C, 28�C, or 32�C, or in the different compart-
ments of a MCT in which the tunnels between the compartments
were blocked by grids (MCT-blocked) or in a MCT. At time 0, all
fish were infected with CyHV-3 (Figure 1C). Survival rates of 0%
and 20% were recorded in SCTs maintained at 24�C and 28�C,
respectively. Significantly higher survival rates of 40% (p = 0.033)
and 80% (p = 0.004) were observed when infected fish were
blocked by grids in the 24�C and 28�C compartments of the
MCT, respectively. Consistent with an earlier report (Gilad
et al., 2003), infected fish in the SCT at 32�C or blocked in the
32�C compartment of the MCT did not develop CyHV-3 disease.
The effect of temperature on the development of CyHV-3
disease is also illustrated by Movie S2. It shows that clinical signs
expressed by fish blocked in MCT compartments were inversely
related to temperature. Importantly, all the fish infected in the
MCTs survived the infection as the consequence of the expres-
sion of behavioral fever.
Expression of Behavioral Fever Occurs at an Advanced
Stage of CyHV-3 Disease
The data above demonstrate that expression of behavioral fever
is beneficial for CyHV-3 infected carp. However, clinical obser-
vation of fish in the MCTs revealed that their migration to the
warmest compartment occurred only at an advanced stage of
the disease. To verify the relatively late onset of behavioral fever
with respect to viral replication and cytokine upregulation, fish in-
fected in MCTs were analyzed over time for viral load and carp
proinflammatory cytokine gene expression. Data presented in
Figure 1D confirmed that the onset of behavioral fever observed
in this experiment at 6 dpi occurred days after systemic replica-
tion of the virus (significant at 3 dpi) and upregulation of proin-
flammatory cytokines (significant for il1b and TNF-a1/a2 at 3
dpi and for all cytokines tested at 5 dpi).
The relatively late onset of behavioral fever led us to postulate
that this phenomenon might be delayed by the virus in order to
retain its host at a temperature compatible with viral replication.
As some viruses have been shown to express soluble decoy
cytokine receptors (Epperson et al., 2012), and as the CyHV-3
genome potentially encodes such receptors (Yi et al., 2015),
we hypothesized that CyHV-3 might express decoy receptor(s)
able to neutralize putative pyrogenic cytokines produced by
fish. CyHV-3 ORF12 was selected as a candidate because it
encodes a putative soluble TNF-receptor homolog that is the
most abundant viral protein of the CyHV-3 secretome (Ouyang
et al., 2013).
CyHV-3 ORF12 Deletion Does Not Affect Viral
Replication In Vitro or Virulence In Vivo under Standard
Laboratory Conditions—SCT at 24�C
To investigate whether CyHV-3 is able to delay the expression of
behavioral fever through expression of ORF12, a CyHV-3 ORF12
deletion (12Del) mutant and a revertant (12Rev) virus (in which
ORF12 was restored) were derived from the parental wild-type
(WT) strain (Figure S1). The structure and transcription of the
ORF12 region, as well as the full-length genome sequences,
were validated in all viral strains (Supplemental Information and

On day 0, fish were infected with wild-type CyHV-3
(WT) (right column, 3 upper graphs) or were mock-
infected (Mock) (left column, 3 upper graphs). The
number of fish in each compartment was counted
every 30 min and expressed as a mean per day +
SD. See also Movie S1 illustrating the first pair of
MCTs at 7 dpi. The two lower graphs represent a
global analysis of the data from the three repli-

MCTs based on the data of the three replicates.
The statistical significance of the differences be-
tween the mean number of fish observed for WT
infected and mock-infected groups is presented in
the right graph. The days on which the number of
fish per compartment was statistically different
between WT infected and mock-infected fish are
indicated according to the level of significance.

after CyHV-3 infection. Carp were housed in SCTs
(n = 15), in a MCT (n = 15) (MCT) and in each
compartment (n = 10) of a MCT in which the
tunnels were blocked by grids (MCT-blocked).
Survival rates were measured according to time
post-infection with CyHV-3 (WT) (see also Movie
S2 recorded 9 dpi for the MCT-blocked).
(D) Carp (n = 15 per tank) were housed in 6 MCTs: 2
MCTs (1 mock-infected and 1 infected) were used
for the observation of fish position, 4 MCTs were
used for fish sampling (2 fish per time point per
tank). At day 0, fish were mock-infected (1 MCT) or
infected (5 MCTs) with CyHV-3 WT. At the indi-
cated post-infection times, viral load (gray line) and
cytokine gene expression were analyzed (n = 8; 2
fish were collected from each of the 4 replicate
tanks leading to a total of 8 fish; mean + SD).
Significant differences observed between CyHV-3
infected fish collected at different post-infection
times and mock-infected fish are indicated by
asterisks. The red arrow indicates the period dur-
ing which expression of behavioral fever was sig-
nificant (p < 0.05 or lower, significant increase of
fish in the 32�C compartment).

 Figure S1). Next, we characterized the phenotype of ORF12
deletion in vitro and in vivo. In cell culture, the three strains repli-
cated comparably at 24�C and 28�C (Figure S1E). As reported
earlier, CyHV-3 did not replicate at 32�C (Gilad et al., 2003).
Since the WT and the 12Rev viruses exhibited identical genome
sequences, only the latter was used in in vivo experiments. Inoc-
ulation of fish in SCTs at 24�C did not reveal a phenotype for
12Del different from that of the 12Rev (Figure 2A). Thus, similar
clinical signs (data not shown) and survival rates (Figure 2A;
left graph) were observed for 12Del and 12Rev. Moreover, viral
load in gills increased similarly for the two viruses (Figure 2A;
right graph). These observations demonstrate that ORF12 dele-
tion does not exhibit a phenotype different from that of the 12Rev
under standard laboratory conditions.
CyHV-3 ORF12 Delays the Expression of Behavioral
Fever and Promotes CyHV-3 Replication in an
Environment Encompassing a Temperature Gradient
In parallel to the experiments described above (Figure 2A), in-
fections were also performed in MCTs (Figure 2B). Carp were
distributed in 6 MCTs. At time 0, three MCTs were infected
with 12Rev and the three others with 12Del. These triplicate ex-
periments revealed that fish infected with 12Del expressed
behavioral fever significantly earlier than those infected with
12Rev. Independently of the viral genotype, no fish died from
CyHV-3 infection in MCTs, but because of their earlier migration
to the warmest compartment, fish infected with 12Del expressed
less severe clinical signs compared to fish infected with 12Rev.
To verify this phenotypic difference between 12Del and 12Rev,
which was not observed in SCTs at 24�C (Figure 2A), an indepen-
dent infection with the two viruses was performed in 6 MCTs (3
MCTs per genotype), two intended for observation of fish distri-
bution and four for sample collection, in order to measure viral
load at various times post-infection (Figure 2C). In this experi-
ment, fish infected with 12Del migrated 2 days earlier to the
warmest compartment (Figure 2C; left graph). Interestingly,
although the two viruses exhibited comparable replication ki-
netics in the SCTs (Figure 2A; right graph) and in the MCTs before
expression of behavioral fever, they differed drastically once the
fish migrated to the 32�C compartment (Figure 2C; right graph).
Due to their earlier migration to a non-permissive temperature,
fish infected with 12Del showed a faster and more drastic
decrease of viral load than those infected with 12Rev. These re-
sults demonstrate that CyHV-3 is able to alter the expression of
behavioral fever by its host via the expression of a single gene,
thus favoring its replication.
CyHV-3 ORF12 Encodes a Soluble Decoy Receptor
for TNF-a
Next, we tried to unravel the mechanism by which ORF12 delays
expression of behavioral fever. According to our initial hypothe-
sis, ORF12 might act as a soluble decoy receptor that neutralizes
pyrogenic cytokines. As ORF12 encodes a putative soluble
Tnf-receptor homolog, and as TNF-a is an endogenous pyrogen
in endotherms (Dinarello et al., 1986), we investigated whether
ORF12 encodes a soluble decoy receptor for TNF-a. The amino
acid sequence of the ORF12 protein was aligned manually onto
the human TNFR2 protein by using the Pfam TNFR_c6 domains
(Finn et al., 2014) as a guide. TNFR2 has three TNFR_c6 domains
in tandem and ORF12 has two, plus a fragment of a third. The
solved structure of the human TNF-TNFR2 complex (3ALQ; Fig-
ure 3Ai) (Mukai et al., 2010) was used to develop a homology
model of CyHV-3 ORF12 (Figure 3Aii). Superposition was
achieved at 1.771A
˚ (Figure 3Aiii) and favorably assessed by
Ramachandran plot (Figure 3Aiv). The quality of the homology
model strongly suggested that ORF12 forms a structure that
contains at least two functional TNFR_c6 domains and that
could bind TNF-a. The top BLASTP hit between ORF12 and eu-
karyotic proteins is the TNFR-2A from Onchorhyncus mykiss at
48% identity. The top hits with herpesvirus sequences are also
in this range: UL144 in chimpanzee cytomegalovirus at 42%
and ORF150D in cyprinid herpesvirus 1 at 40%.
To test the hypothesis that ORF12 encodes a functional solu-
ble TNF-a receptor, concentrated supernatants were produced
from cell cultures infected with CyHV-3 WT, 12Del, and 12Rev,
as well as from mock-infected cultures. Silver staining of total su-
pernatant proteins confirmed that ORF12 (predicted molecular
mass 12.6 kDa) is the most abundant viral protein in the
CyHV-3 secretome (Figure 3B). To test the ability of ORF12 to
bind carp TNF-a, proteins of concentrated supernatants were
coated on ELISA plates before incubation with carp TNF-a1 or
TNF-a2 (Figure 3C). Carp TNF-a1 and TNF-a2 are both homo-
logs of mammalian TNFSF2 (TNF-a) (Forlenza et al., 2009).
Quantification of TNF-a binding demonstrated that the WT
and 12Rev supernatants contained TNF-a-binding activity, in
contrast to the 12Del and mock-infected supernatants (Fig-
ure 3C). These results were confirmed by independent ELISA
combining a different detection system (anti-His-tag monoclonal
antibody) and an alternative prokaryotic source of TNF-a1/ TNF-
a2 (Figure S2). Next, a bioluminescence reporter assay was used
to determine whether ORF12 binding to TNF-a could neutralize
its ability to activate NF-kB signaling (Figure 3D). When incu-
bated with concentrated supernatants from mock- or 12Del-
infected cells, carp TNF-a1 and TNF-a2 induced activation of
NF-kB similarly. This activation was completely inhibited when
the cytokines were pre-incubated with WT or 12Rev superna-
tants (Figure 3D). These data demonstrated that ORF12 encodes
a soluble TNF-a receptor able to neutralize both TNF-a1 and
TNF-a2 from carp.
TNF-a Is a Mediator of Behavioral Fever Expressed by
CyHV-3 Infected Carp
The ability of CyHV-3 ORF12 to delay the expression of behav-
ioral fever, together with the results above showing that ORF12
encodes a decoy receptor able to neutralize TNF-a, led us to hy-
pothesize that TNF-a might act as a pyrogenic cytokine in ecto-
therms, as it does in endotherms. To explore this hypothesis,
carp were distributed in 4 MCTs and infected at time 0 with the
CyHV-3 WT strain and then, 3 days later, injected intraperitone-
ally with control irrelevant or anti-TNF-a neutralizing antibodies
(2 MCTs per condition; Figure 4). Injection of anti-TNF-a neutral-
izing antibodies induced a significant reduction of migration to
the 32�C compartment, and as a consequence only 80% and
60% of the fish survived. By contrast, infected fish injected
with irrelevant antibodies migrated efficiently to the 32�C
compartment, and all survived the infection. This observation is
also illustrated by Movie S3 recorded 6 dpi for the first replicate.
Injection of anti-TNF-a neutralizing antibodies did not reduce

nating from the duplicate tanks [3 fish/tank], mean +

in vivo neutralization of TNF-a or the implication of other
pyrogenic cytokines. However, these results demonstrate that
carp TNF-a is a mediator of behavioral fever in our model.
DISCUSSION
Here, we studied the expression of behavioral fever by using a
relevant biological model in which CyHV-3 infects its natural
host through a natural route. Our data highlight the importance
of the environment in the pathogen-host-environment interplay.
Importantly, they also demonstrate the ability of a virus to alter
the behavior of its vertebrate host through the expression of a

The present study demonstrates a beneficial effect of behav-
ioral fever in response to a specific pathogen in a specific host.
However, challenge trials using different fish species and
different pathogens revealed that an increase of temperature
correlated with an increase in mortality rate (exemplified by
Jun et al., 2009), suggesting that expression of behavioral fever
in these models would be maladaptive. It will be interesting in the
future to determine whether fish can express a response against
some pathogens opposite to behavioral fever (i.e., seeking
cooler water) and whether this can confer an advantage to the
infected subject.

 Viruses are able tomanipulate virtually all thephysiological pro-
cesses of their host to enhance their replication and transmission.
However, there are very few reports of viruses that alter host
behavior in a way that might increase their fitness. A frequently
cited example is rabies virus, which, through the neurological le-
sions it causes, induces an aggressive behavior favoring the
contamination of naive subjects by infectious saliva (John et al.,
2015). To the best of our knowledge, there are only two reports
of viruses able to alter the behavior of their host through the effect
of identified genes, and both are related to baculoviruses, which
have been shown to increase the locomotor activity and climbing
behaviors of infected caterpillar hosts (Kamita et al., 2005; Hoo-
ver et al., 2011). To date, no pathogen has been shown to alter
the expression of behavioral fever. We have demonstrated that
CyHV-3 encodes a gene that delays the expression of behavioral
fever, thereby enhancing viral replication in a viral excretion or-
gan. Two non-exclusive hypotheses could explain the selective
advantage conferred by the ability to delay the expression of
behavioral fever. First, it could enhance viral replication and
excretion by retaining infected fish at a permissive temperature.
Second, it could favor viral transmission by retaining infected
fish at the temperature preferred by non-infected fish, thereby
promoting
physical
contact
between them.
It
is
notable
that ORF12 delays the behavioral fever response rather than
completely inhibiting it. This time-dependent effect likely reflects
a selective advantage for CyHV-3. As indicated above, by delay-
ing the behavioral fever response, ORF12 is likely to enhance viral
spread through a fish population. Furthermore, by allowing fish
finally to express behavioral fever, and thus survive the infection,
the virus could promote the appearance of latently infected fish
that will carry and spread the herpesvirus infection throughout
their lives (Reed et al., 2014). Experiments are in progress to
test these hypotheses.
Here, we identified the role of carp TNF-a as a key mediator of
behavioral fever in an ectotherm (Figure 4). Our results suggest
that behavioral fever in ectotherms and fever in endotherms
are evolutionarily and functionally related through common
cytokine mediators that originated more than 400 million
years ago. The results of this study suggest that the ancestral
signaling pathway of behavioral fever regulation in ectotherms
also evolved in endotherms to regulate the expression of fever.
Finally, our results support the importance of the interplay be-
tween the immune system and the central nervous system.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the ability of a verte-
brate virus to alter the behavior of its host through the expression
of a single gene. This gene encodes a soluble viroreceptor able
to bind and neutralize TNF-a, which was shown to be a mediator
of behavioral fever in our homologous model. An interesting
perspective would be to investigate whether the homology exist-
ing between the cytokine signaling pathways of behavioral fever
in ectotherms and fever in endotherms extends to cytokines
other than TNF-a.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cells
Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) and Cyprinus carpio brain (CCB) cells
were cultured as described previously (Boutier et al., 2015b; Forlenza
et al., 2009).
TNF-a Eukaryotic Expression Vectors and Anti-TNF-a Antibodies
Plasmids pIRES-TNF-a1-EGFP and pIRES-TNF-a2-EGFP (hereafter referred
to as pTNF-a1 and pTNF-a2, respectively) (Forlenza et al., 2009) were used.
The empty vector, pIRES-EGFP (hereafter referred to as pEmpty), was used
as a negative control. Affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-carp TNF-a IgG
neutralizing both carp TNF-a1 and TNF-a2 (anti-TNF-a) (Forlenza et al.,
2009), as well as purified polyclonal rabbit irrelevant control IgG (CT),
were used.
Production and Characterization of CyHV-3 ORF12 Recombinant
Strains
A CyHV-3 ORF12 deletion (12Del) mutant and a revertant (12Rev) virus (in
which ORF12 was restored) were derived from the parental, wild-type (WT)
FL BAC clone (Figures S1A and S1B) by using BAC cloning and prokaryotic
recombination technologies (Boutier et al., 2015b). The structure and tran-
scription of the ORF12 region, as well as the full-length genome sequences,
were validated in all viral strains (Supplemental Information and Figure S1).
The ability of the recombinants to replicate in cell culture was investigated
by multi-step growth curves as described previously (Boutier et al., 2015b)
(Figure S1E). A more detailed version of this section is provided in the Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.
Concentrated Cell Supernatants
Cultures of CCB cells were infected with CyHV-3 at a multiplicity of infec-
tion (MOI) of 0.1 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell or mock-infected. Concen-
trated cell supernatants were produced as described previously (Ouyang
et al., 2013).
TNF-a Binding Assay
Binding of carp TNF-a to the CyHV-3 secretome was analyzed by ELISA
(Forlenza et al., 2009). A detailed description of this method is available in
the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
TNF-a Bioluminescent Reporter Assay
EPC cells stably transfected with pNiFty2-Luc (InvivoGen) (Piazzon et al.,
2015), referred to as EPC-NFkB-Luc cells, were used to measure TNF-a bioac-
tivity by bioluminescence (see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures
for a detailed description of this method).
Ethics Statement
The animal studies were approved by the local ethics committee (Laboratory
accreditation No. 1610008, protocol No. 1327).
Fish
European common carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio) between 7 and 11 months old
and weighing between 8 and 12 g were used. Experimental replicates were
performed with contemporary offspring derived from one female and one
male carp.
Tank Systems
A single-chamber tank (SCT) system and a multi-chamber tank (MCT) system
were used (Figure 1A; see also Movie S1 and Supplemental Experimental Pro-
cedures). Temperatures in all three compartments of MCTs were controlled by
measurements every 30 min. The observed temperatures of the MCTs used
for the experiments in this manuscript are presented as the mean ± SD in
Table S1.
Inoculation and Injection of Fish
For inoculation with CyHV-3, fish were immersed for 2 hr in water containing
the virus at a dose of 100 pfu/mL, unless otherwise specified. Antibodies
(1 mg/g of fish body weight) were injected intraperitoneally.
Monitoring of Fish Position in the MCTs
The number of fish in each compartment was counted manually from the im-
ages captured by a digital camera at each successive 30 min, resulting in 48
measurements per day. The results are presented as the mean + SD (n = 48)
of the number of fish observed per day in each compartment (for additional
information see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).

(log10)) was quantified by real-time TaqMan qPCR as described previously
(Boutier et al., 2015b). The primers and probes are listed in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Quantification of Carp Gene Expression by qRT-PCR
The expression of target genes was measured by qRT-PCR as described
previously (Ouyang et al., 2013; Rakus et al., 2012). The primers used are listed
in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
