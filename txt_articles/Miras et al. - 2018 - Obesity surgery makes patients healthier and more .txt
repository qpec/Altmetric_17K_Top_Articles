Abstract
Background: The National Bariatric Surgery Registry (NBSR) is the largest bespoke database in
the field in the United Kingdom.
Objectives: Our aim was to analyze the NBSR to determine whether the effects of obesity surgery
on associated co-morbidities observed in small randomized controlled clinical trials could be
replicated in a "real life" setting within U.K. healthcare.
Setting: United Kingdom.
Methods: All NBSR entries for operations between 2000 and 2015 with associated demographic
and co-morbidity data were analyzed retrospectively.
Results: A total of 50,782 entries were analyzed. The patients were predominantly female (78%)
and white European with a mean age of 45 ± 11 years and a mean body mass index of 48 ± 8 kg/m2.

 Over 5 years of follow-up, statistically significant reductions in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, asthma, functional impairment, arthritis, and gastro-
esophageal reflux disease were observed. The "remission" of these co-morbidities was evident 1 year
postoperatively and reached a plateau 2 to 5 years after surgery. Obesity surgery was particularly
effective on functional impairment and diabetes, almost doubling the proportion of patients able to
climb 3 flights of stairs and halving the proportion of patients with diabetes related hyperglycemia
compared with preoperatively. Surgery was safe with a morbidity of 3.1% and in-hospital mortality
of .07% and a reduced median inpatient stay of 2 days, despite an increasingly sick patient
population.
Conclusions: Obesity surgery in the U.K. results not only in weight loss, but also in substantial
improvements in obesity-related co-morbidities. Appropriate support and funding will help improve
the quality of the NBSR data set even further, thus enabling its use to inform healthcare policy.

The increasing prevalence of obesity in the United
Kingdom (U.K.) is well known and remains depressing. It
is less well recognized that body mass index (BMI) on its
own is a poor predictor of disease burden at the individual
level and of mortality at the population level [1]. In
epidemiologic studies the medical, functional, and psycho-
logical complications of obesity are the best predictors of
mortality after 16 years of observation [1].
Large case-control studies and randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) have shown that bariatric surgery reduces
obesity-related morbidity and/or mortality from conditions
such as cancer [2], obstructive sleep apnea [3], cardiovas-
cular disease [4], type 2 diabetes (T2D) microvascular
complications [5], functional impairment [6], infertility
[7], and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [8]. Several
registries, such as the International Federation for the
Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Disorders (IFSO) Global
Registry [9] and the Scandinavian Obesity Registry [10],
have been also consistent in showing safety and efficacy of
obesity surgery on these co-morbidities. Thus, bariatric
surgery has evolved from an intervention purely for weight,
to one for diabetes control and ultimately for obesity as a
“systems disease.”
The uptake of obesity surgery in the U.K. has been
slower and more cautious compared with other parts of the
world. In an attempt to collect data on disease burden of the
operated population and to increase the openness and
transparency of surgery outcomes, the British Obesity and
Metabolic Surgery Society in collaboration with the Asso-
ciation of Laparoscopic Surgeons of Great Britain and
Ireland and the Association of Upper Gastrointestinal
Surgeons and in partnership with Dendrite Clinical Systems
Limited launched the National Bariatric Surgery Registry
(NBSR) in January 2009. It became mandatory to submit
National Health Service (NHS) England data to the NBSR
and publish surgeon-level outcomes in 2013. Unlike the
NBSR, independently collected Hospital Episode Statistics
or community databases do not collect systematic data on
patient demographic characteristics or disease burden. Our
aim was to determine whether the effects of obesity surgery
on associated co-morbidities from RCTs could be replicated
in a “real life” setting within the U.K. health service. We
extracted data entries from the NBSR to examine the
disease burden of 50,782 patients and the effects of obesity
surgery

related
co-morbidities

postoperatively.
Methods
The first 3756 entries in the NBSR (7.4%) from year
2000 to 2008 were entered retrospectively, and all entries
from February 2, 2008 to January 12, 2015 were entered
prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. The NBSR
software is a bespoke web registry application built by
Dendrite Clinical Systems using their Intellect Web propri-
etary software, hosted on a secure server within the
NHSNet N3 network. Surgeons performed most data

contributed to the current data set. Patient consent was not
obtained because these were routinely generated clinical

The EOSS has been used to assess and stage obesity-related

patients into 5 risk groups: no clear risks (stage 0), preclinical
(stage 1), established risks or disease (stage 2), end-organ
damage (stage 3), and end-stage disease (stage 4). We used

 the co-morbidity data recorded in the NBSR data set to
assign an approximate EOSS score (Supplemental Table 1).
It was beyond the scope of this analysis to compare the
effectiveness of the different obesity surgery procedures on
these variables.
The vast majority of variables were recorded in a
categorical manner. No standardized clinical definitions or
laboratory ranges were used to define obesity-related co-
morbidities; therefore, all entries were dependent on the
judgment of the clinician submitting the data. Follow-up
appointments were done at variable points, and therefore to
standardize time-interval reporting only the closest data
entry to the specific time points was included and all
additional entries were excluded from the analysis. Com-
plications, including death and reoperation, were recorded
during the inpatient stay, within 30 days or at any time after
surgery.
To systematically identify erroneous entries (i.e., height
or weight), the robust regression and outlier removal
method was applied. The robust nonlinear regression
method was used to fit a curve not influenced by outliers,
and the residuals of the robust fit then were analyzed to
identify outliers. These were subsequently removed, and an
ordinary least-squares regression on the remaining data was
performed. The Q value, which determines how sensitively
the potential erroneous entries are identified, was set to
10%.
GraphPad Prism version 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla,
CA, USA), was used for statistical analysis. Data are
presented as absolute values, percentages, mean ± standard
deviation, or median (25th–75th percentile). D’Agostino-
Pearson Omnibus normality test was used to assess normal-
ity distribution. Nonnormally distributed continuous varia-
bles were compared over time using the Kruskal-Wallis test.
Postbaseline categorical variables were compared with
baseline values using the χ2 test with Yates’ continuity
correction. Longitudinal continuous data were analyzed
with a repeated measures one-way analysis of the variance
with Dunnett’s correction for multiple comparisons. Sensi-
tivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of
missing data, using the primary analysis methods, but under
alternative missing data assumptions. Statistical significance
was defined as P o .05.
Results
Baseline characteristics
From February 2000 to December 2015, 50,782 proce-
dures were recorded in the NBSR. The cohort consisted
predominantly of middle-aged female patients of Caucasian
ethnic background (Table 1). The commonest recorded co-
morbidity was functional impairment (70%), followed by
arthritis (54%) and hypertension (37%). Approximately 1 in
3 patients had T2D (Table 2; Fig. 1). A gradual increase in
the median number of reported preoperative co-morbidities
was observed over 15 years, with the median number of co-
morbidities per patient rising from 1 before the year 2006,
to 2 in 2006 to 2008, to 3 from 2009 onward (Kruskal-
Wallis test, P o .001). The distribution of EOSS scores
over 15 years is shown in Fig. 2.
Health outcomes
Over the 5-year follow-up, statistically significant reduc-
tions were observed in the prevalence of T2D (Fig. 3),
hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, asthma, functional
impairment, arthritis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease.
The “remission” of these co-morbidities was evident 1 year
postoperatively and reached a plateau 2 to 5 years after
surgery. Obesity surgery was particularly effective on
functional impairment and T2D, with almost a doubling
of the proportion of patients able to climb 3 flights of stairs
compared with preoperatively and a halving of the propor-
tion of patients with T2D-related hyperglycemia compared
with preoperatively. The only recorded co-morbidity for
which no significant change was recorded was PCOS and/or
infertility (Fig. 3).

 Weight loss
The most rapid weight loss took place during the first
year after surgery and reached a nadir of 30 ± 12% total
weight loss at 2 years. This was followed by weight regain
and 24 ± 13% total weight loss at 5 years (Fig. 4).
Choice of surgery
The most commonly performed operation was Roux-en-
Y gastric bypass (RYGB; 51.4%), followed by vertical
sleeve gastrectomy (VSG; 20.2%) and gastric banding
(19.7%; Table 3). Over the course of the observation
period, the percentage of RYGB procedures performed
increased and reached a plateau. There was a decrease in
the percentage of gastric banding and an increase in the
percentage of VSG operations performed (Fig. 5). The
remaining 8.7% of procedures included duodenal switch,
biliopancreatic diversion, revisional gastric band, and intra-
gastric balloon or were not specified. Most procedures were
primary surgery (90%) and were performed laparoscopi-
cally (93%). Median postoperative length of stay was 3
days before 2006 and 2 days from 2007 onward.
Postoperative complications and mortality
Recorded postoperative cardiovascular complications,
such
as
dysrhythmia
or
myocardial
infarction,
were
recorded in 0.3% patients. The total postoperative compli-
cations rate was reported as 3.1%, the most common being
vomiting/poor
oral
intake
(Supplemental
Table
2).
Recorded in-hospital mortality rate was 0.07%.
Missing data
At baseline, the domain with the highest rates of
incomplete entries (17.4%) was gastroesophageal reflux
disease, followed by PCOS/infertility (16.8%). Data entry
for all health outcomes decreased substantially after the first
postoperative year (Fig. 3). The primary analysis was
conducted under the assumption that the missing data were
Missing Completely at Random (i.e., for each co-morbidity
the prevalence in the unobserved patients was assumed to
be the same as for those that were observed). Sensitivity
analysis was conducted to examine the robustness of the
purported significant results. For each co-morbidity, the
number of patients required to overturn the significance of
the observed result was established. Considerably higher
proportions of co-morbidities were required among the
unobserved than were seen in the observed to change the
significance of the results. The results therefore support the
primary conclusion of significant reductions in these co-
morbidities postsurgery (Supplementary Table 3).
Discussion
Using real-life data, we found that surgery reduces
weight and improves health. Obesity-related physical and
functional conditions were either ameliorated or even
entered “remission” within 1 year after surgery, and this
effect was durable at 5 years. These health benefits were
achieved in the context of an increasingly “sick” patient
population, with a reduction in the length of inpatient stay
and with low rates of surgery-related morbidity and
mortality.
The most striking improvements were observed in
patients with impaired functional status or T2D at baseline
with “resolution” in 58% and 52%, respectively, at 1 year
postoperatively. The proportion of patients who could climb
only half a flight of stairs at baseline reduced from 19% to
8% 1 year after surgery. Obese patients have higher rates of
unemployment compared with normal weight individuals
and functional impairment is one of the major contributors.
Studies from the United Kingdom and other European
countries demonstrated that 14 months after obesity surgery
patients’ paid working hours increased by 57% and state

 benefit claims decreased by 75% [11,12]. Indeed, the Office
of Health Economics in the United Kingdom has predicted
that if 25% of eligible patients for obesity surgery under-
went surgery, the U.K. gross domestic product would
increase by £1.3 billion due to the expected increases in
paid employment, which would offset the costs of surgery
within 1 year [13].
Patients with T2D experience rapid improvements in
blood glucose, and 48% have no reported indication of
diabetes within 1 year after obesity surgery. This has been
shown to translate to less medication usage, fewer capillary
glucose testing strips, fewer hospital encounters [14,15],
and—together with improvements in other cardiometabolic
risk factors (e.g., hypertension and dyslipidemia)—into
reduction in the incidence of T2D-related micro- and
macrovascular complications [5,16]. What is not reported
in the NBSR are outcomes of T2D patients who continue on
glucose-lowering
medications
postoperatively;

 medications, still reduce their total number and manage to
achieve optimal glycemic control postoperatively. This is
still a very important but underreported outcome of obesity
surgery. The IFSO Global Registry 2017 reports 63%
patients coming off glucose-lowering medications 1 year
after surgery. In the Scandinavian Obesity Registry this
number reaches 66% after 1 year and 54% after 5 years
[10]. Somewhat higher rates of reported T2D “remission” or
stopping glucose-lowering medications in those registries
might differ due to varying criteria between countries and
bariatric centers when diagnosing T2D, withholding med-
ications, or claiming remission.
The surprising lack of an effect on PCOS/infertility is
contrary to the published literature [17]. It may be because a
diagnosis of PCOS is not frequently reviewed, unlike T2D
or hypertension, which are subject to constant reassessment.
Furthermore, a significant proportion of women undergoing
obesity surgery were postmenopausal; therefore; effects of
surgery on improving fertility would not be monitored in
that group.
Choice of surgery is somewhat different to that reported
worldwide. In both the IFSO Global Registry 2017 and
NBSR, RYGB is the most commonly performed procedure,
constituting 46.3% of all operations as per IFSO records
and 51.4% in the NBSR. However, reported numbers of
VSG worldwide are almost as high as the RYGB (43.6%),
while in the United Kingdom only 1 in 5 bariatric
procedures was VSG. Gastric band numbers differ even
further with only 6% by IFSO and 19.7% by the NBSR.
Some variations in the proportion of each procedure can be
explained by the fact that the latest IFSO Registry covers
2013 to 2017; the U.K. data presented here cover 15 years
before 2015, and these are the years when VSG was gaining
popularity and the gastric band procedure was declining.
Furthermore, there are clear region-based trends regarding
the procedure performed. European surgery preferences are
similar to the United Kingdom, whereas Australasia,
Central and South America, as well as the Middle East
present VSG as their procedure of choice.
Performing obesity surgery in dedicated bariatric centers,
along with use of laparoscopic techniques, enables low
mortality and morbidity rates and short postoperative stays
to be achieved. Even if there is underreporting of compli-
cations and postoperative deaths (e.g., due to loss of follow-
up, when patients change healthcare providers), the 0.07%
mortality and overall 2.6% complication rate rank obesity
surgery as one of the safest major elective surgical
procedures. The low in-hospital mortality reported in the
NBSR is consistent with the Hospital Episode Statistics
mortality data collected in the NHS in England [18].
The major benefit of the NBSR is that its real-life data
complement the findings of RCTs of much smaller sample
size. If combined appropriately with other large data sets, “big
data” can provide invaluable information in terms of patient
prioritization for surgery, personalization of treatment, and
health economic analyses. An additional benefit is that the
NBSR has already changed healthcare policy in the United
Kingdom. In the context of limited available evidence from
relevant RCTs on the benefits of surgery on patients with T2D
duration of o2 years, the National Institute of Healthcare
Excellence examined the NBSR data, which showed that being
underinclusive would exclude approximately 75% of eligible
patients receiving bariatric surgery. As a result, National
Institute of Healthcare Excellence extended the definition of
recent-onset T2D to include patients with disease duration of
10 years and a BMI of 30 to 35 kg/m2. More RCTs were thus
able to be included in their analyses, leading to lowering of the
BMI eligibility criteria for surgery to 30 kg/m2 [19].
The NBSR data set does not allow health economic
analyses to be generated. However, the Health Technology
Assessment program has already demonstrated that the
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality adjusted life
year of obesity surgery was between £2000 and £4000 for a
patient with a BMI ≥40 kg/m2 and therefore financially
favorable [20]. Currently, o1% of patients eligible on BMI
criteria undergo obesity surgery in the United Kingdom [21].
The level 2b evidence from the NBSR together with grade B
recommendations from the Health Technology Assessment,
and data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink [10] in
combination could encourage local healthcare commissioners
to increase the funding available for obesity surgery.
The major limitation of the NBSR is sparse record of
follow-up after 2 postoperative years. NHS England com-
missions surgical providers for 2 years of follow-up, with
further follow-up in primary care after this. There is
currently no mechanism to capture data from primary care
in the registry [21]. This is in contrast with the well-
developed infrastructure that supports data collection for
cancer treatment and survival.
After a comparison of baseline characteristics between
those unobserved and observed at 1 and 5 years the Missing
Completely at Random assumption was considered most
plausible for the missing data in the analysis. However, as
operating surgeons enter most of the data, it cannot be ruled
out that there may be an underreporting bias for operative
complications (excluding death) and an overreporting bias
for the positive outcomes of surgery. The small proportion
of retrospective entries between 2000 and 2008 is vulner-
able to this bias. Also, the early or late complications of
patients attending a unit other than the one at which they
had surgery would not be captured. In addition, the data set
does not contain specific fields for postoperative gallstone
disease or internal hernias.
The NBSR did not standardize definitions of specific
diagnoses (e.g., T2D, hypertension) and did not include
continuous data (e.g., glycated hemoglobin, blood pressure),
imaging, and other clinical investigation results or detailed
medication usage. Therefore, all entries were dependent on
the judgment of the clinician submitting the data, not
necessarily on robust disease diagnosis and remission criteria.

 The data set did not contain other clinically important
variables (e.g., number of medications, nutrient deficiencies,
fractures, substance abuse, and suicidal attempts after the
operation). The data set was chosen as a balance between
collecting too much data (risking poor engagement and
incomplete records) and collecting too little data to generate
meaningful analysis. These limitations could potentially be
overcome in the future through consensus on clinical
definitions, inclusion of patient identifiable information, and
infrastructure to collect follow-up data from primary care.
Conclusions
The NBSR data demonstrate on a large scale that obesity
surgery leads to weight loss and substantial improvements
in obesity-related co-morbidities. Patients become healthier
and more functional. Surgery is safe despite the patients
having more obesity-related disease over time. Appropriate
support and funding will help improve the quality of the
NBSR data set even further, thus potentially increasing its
effect on healthcare policy.
