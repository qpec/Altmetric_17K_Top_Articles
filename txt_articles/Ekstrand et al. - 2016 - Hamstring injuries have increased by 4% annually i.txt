ABSTRACT
Background There are limited data on hamstring
injury rates over time in football.
Aim To analyse time trends in hamstring injury rates in
male professional footballers over 13 consecutive
seasons and to distinguish the relative contribution of
training and match injuries.
Methods 36 clubs from 12 European countries were
followed between 2001 and 2014. Team medical staff
recorded individual player exposure and time-loss
injuries. Injuries per 1000 h were compared as a rate
ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Injury burden was the number
of lay off days per 1000 h. Seasonal trend for injury was
analysed using linear regression.
Results A total of 1614 hamstring injuries were
recorded; 22% of players sustained at least one
hamstring injury during a season. The overall hamstring
injury rate over the 13-year period was 1.20 injuries per
1000 h; the match injury rate (4.77) being 9 times
higher than the training injury rate (0.51; RR 9.4; 95%
CI 8.5 to 10.4). The time-trend analysis showed an
annual average 2.3% year on year increase in the total
hamstring injury rate over the 13-year period (R2=0.431,
b=0.023, 95% CI 0.006 to 0.041, p=0.015). This
increase over time was most pronounced for training
injuries—these increased by 4.0% per year (R2=0.450,
b=0.040, 95% CI 0.011 to 0.070, p=0.012). The
average hamstring injury burden was 19.7 days per
1000 h (annual average increase 4.1%) (R2=0.437,
b=0.041, 95% CI 0.010 to 0.072, p=0.014).
Conclusions Training-related hamstring injury rates
have increased substantially since 2001 but match-
related injury rates have remained stable. The challenge
is for clubs to reduce training-related hamstring injury
rates without impairing match performance.
INTRODUCTION
Muscle injuries are a substantial problem for pro-
fessional football players. They constitute more
than one-third of all time-loss injuries and cause
more than a quarter of the total injury absence in
high-level European professional football clubs.1
Hamstring
injury
is the
most
common
injury
subtype, representing 12% of all injuries, and a
team with a 25 player-squad typically suffers about
5–6 hamstring injuries each season, equivalent to
more than 80 days involving football activities
(training or matches) lost due to injury.1
The overall burden of muscle injuries could be
very significant for professional football clubs.2 3
The average cost of a first-team player in a
professional team being injured for 1 month is cal-
culated to be around €500 000.4 Eccentric muscle
strength training has been promoted as a method
to prevent hamstring injuries.5–10 In a randomised
controlled trial (RCT), eccentric training with the
‘Nordic
hamstring
(NH)
exercise’
significantly
decreased the rate of hamstring injuries in Danish
elite, subelite and amateur players,8 and in Dutch
amateur players.9 However, adoption and imple-
mentation of the NH exercise programme in men’s
professional football in Europe is low, too low to
expect any overall effect on hamstring injury rates
from.11
In male professional football players, the muscle
injury rate has remained high and unchanged for
more than a decade.12 It is, however, unclear from
that study whether this is also true for the main
subgroups of muscle injuries. To the best of our
knowledge, the development of hamstring injuries
over time in football has not been investigated
before. The objective of this study was therefore to
describe the time trend in hamstring injury rate in
men’s professional football in Europe over 13 con-
secutive seasons, and to distinguish the relative con-
tribution of training and match injuries.
Our hypothesis was that the hamstring injury
rate, similar to the overall muscle injury rate,
would remain constant.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
This is a substudy of a long-term prospective
cohort study evaluating male professional football
in Europe funded by the UEFA. A total of 36 clubs
from 12 countries were followed over a varying
number of seasons from 2001 to 2014, with a total
of 209 club-seasons included. The study design
adhered to the consensus statement on injury defi-
nitions and data collection procedures in football,13
and the general methodology has been reported
elsewhere.14
Inclusion criteria and definitions
All players belonging to the first-team squads each
season were eligible for inclusion. Players who were
transferred to other clubs or who finished their
contracts due to other reasons before the end of a
season were included for as long as they played for
the club. Only players who were contracted to the
club for at least half the season (≥5 months) were
included in this substudy, since having many players
with exposure for only a month or two would
skew the prevalence figures as well as the exposure

Totally,
5216
player-seasons
were
included for analysis. The general operational definitions are
listed in table 1. Hamstring injury was defined as a traumatic
distraction or overuse injury to the hamstring muscle group (the
musculotendinous complex of biceps femoris, semitendinosus
and semimembranosus), including both first-time and recurrent
injuries. Players were considered injured until the club medical
staff (medical doctor or physiotherapist) allowed full participa-
tion in training and availability for match selection.
Data collection
An instructive study manual and study forms were translated by
experienced translators within UEFA from English into five
other languages: French, German, Italian, Russian and Spanish.
Baseline player data and consent were collected once yearly at
the time of player inclusion. During the season, a member of
the medical or coaching staff registered individual player expos-
ure in minutes during all club (first-team, second-team or youth-
team) and national-team training sessions and matches. Injury
and attendance reports were sent to the study group once a
month. Reports were checked on receipt by the study group and
prompt feedback was sent to the teams in order to correct any
missing or unclear data. Each injury was coded according to a
modified version of the Orchard Sports Injury Classification
System (OSICS) 2.0.15
Statistical analyses
Lay off times are presented as mean±SD and median with 25th
and 75th centiles. Injury rate was calculated as the number of
injuries per 1000 h with corresponding 95% CI. Injury rates
were compared using a rate ratio (RR) with 95% CI. Injury
burden was calculated as the number of lay off days per 1000 h
(injury rate×mean absence per injury). Seasonal trend for ham-
string injury rate and injury burden, expressed as average annual
percentage of change, was analysed using linear regression with
log-transformed injury rate and injury burdens as the dependent
variables. In addition, a 2-year moving average (MA) approach,
by summarising two consecutive seasons, was also used as a sen-
sitive analysis in order to smooth out possible large seasonal var-
iations. All analyses were two sided and the significance level
was set at p<0.05.
RESULTS
Hamstring injury pattern
There were 1614 hamstring injuries over the 13-year study
period, 564 (35%) of which occurred in training and 1050
(65%) in match play. Injury distribution between the legs was
even; right leg 50.5%, left leg 49.1%, and bilateral injury occur-
rence 0.4%. T
wo-thirds were regarded as acute onset injuries
(n=1060, 66%) and one-third had a gradual onset (n=554,
34%). Injury distribution according to severity was slight/
minimal
(n=163,
10%),
mild
(n=339,
21%),
moderate
(n=876, 54%) and severe (n=236, 15%). The number of days
lost per injury ranged from 0 to 395 days, with a mean (SD) of
17 (21) days and median (25th, 75th centiles) of 12 (6, 21)
days.
Time trends in squad size and exposure
Time trends in squad size and exposure are shown in table 2.
The analyses exhibited an increase in the average squad size per
season (p<0.001), and a decline in training exposure per
player-season (p<0.01) as well as in match exposure per player-
season (p<0.001). The ratio of training and matches remained
constant over the 13 years of the study.
The analysis did not reveal a significant annual trend of
growth or decline in scheduled first-team training sessions with
respect to season (R2=0.0002, b=0.039, 95% CI (−1.674 to
1.752), p>0.05), which was also shown by MA analysis
(R2=0.011, b=0.238, 95% CI (−1.325 to 1.800), p>0.05),
meaning that the number of scheduled first-team training ses-
sions was approximately the same over the observed time span.
The time-trend analysis of scheduled first-team matches also
failed to discern a significant trend in scheduled first-team
matches with respect to the season (R2=0.005, b=0.024, 95%
CI (−0.200 to 0.248), p>0.05). This conclusion was confirmed
by the conducted analysis on MA (R2=0.001, b=−0.005, 95%
CI (−0.155 to 0.144), p>0.05), which means that the number
of matches was approximately equal during the observed
period.
Time trends in injury rates and injury burden
The overall hamstring injury rate over the 13-year period was
1.20 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.26) injuries per 1000 h; the match
injury rate being 4.77 (95% CI 4.49 to 5.06) and the training
rate 0.51 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.55) injuries per 1000 h. The match
injury rate was nine times higher than the training injury rate
(RR 9.4; 95% CI 8.5 to 10.4, p<0.001). The time-trend ana-
lysis showed an annual average 2.3% increase in the total ham-
string injury rate over the 13-year period (R2=0.431, b=0.023,
95% CI 0.006 to 0.041, p=0.015), with the 2-year MA
approach indicating a 2.2% yearly increase (figure 1). This
increase over time was most pronounced in the training injury
rate
(figure
2),
with a yearly 4.0% increase (R2=0.450,
b=0.040, 95% CI 0.011 to 0.070, p=0.012; 2-year MA
approach 5.0% yearly increase), while the match injury rate
(figure
3)
showed
a
non-significant
1.5%
yearly
increase
(R2=0.225, b=0.015, 95% CI −0.004 to 0.034, p=0.101;
2-year MA approach 1.1% yearly increase).

 The average injury burden was 19.7 days/1000 h exposure
(table 3). Match play was associated with a substantially heavier
injury burden than that in training (88.5 vs 6.3 injury days
absence/1000 h exposure). Time-trend analysis showed trends
similar to those for the injury rates, with an annual average

(R2=0.506,

CI −0.005 to 0.074, p=0.077; 2-year MA approach 3.5%
yearly increase).
Injury prevalence and recurrence rates
On average, 21.8% of players sustained at least one hamstring
injury during a season, with the annual hamstring injury preva-
lence ranging from 16.8% to 25.7% over the 13-year period
(table 3). The average yearly prevalence of hamstring injury
occurrence during match play was 15.1% (range 12.0–17.4%
per season) and, during training, 9.3% (range 6.7–11.5% per
season). T
wo-hundred and sixteen injuries (13%) were recur-
rences from a previous identical injury within 2 months of
return to play. Time-trend analysis of injury rates for index and
recurrent injuries separately showed an annual average 2.3%
increase of index hamstring injuries (R2=0.356, b=0.023, 95%
CI 0.002 to 0.043, p=0.031; 2-year MA approach 2.2% yearly
increase) and a non-significant 3.0% increase of recurrent injur-
ies (R2=0.218, b=0.030, 95% CI −0.008 to 0.068, p=0.108;
2-year MA approach 5.6% yearly increase).
DISCUSSION
Our 13-year (to date) injury surveillance study on men’s profes-
sional football indicates that the rate of hamstring injuries at
training and the injury burden of these injuries have increased
significantly since 2001. The incidence of hamstrings injuries at
matches has remained stable during the 13 season period.
Why has squad size increased?
The average first-team squad size has increased in UEFA teams
studied—from an average of 23 players during the first 3 years
of the study to an average of 26 players during the three latest
seasons.12 A reason for this increase could be that teams want
more players in the squad to rotate players as match congestion
can negatively affect team performance and injury risk.16–18
Another reason could be that the number of substitutes allowed
on the bench at matches has increased in many countries during
recent years (the English Premier League have increased the
number from 5 to 7 in 2008 and up to 12 substitutes are
allowed on the bench in Serie A in Italy). Bigger clubs having
the financial capacity to buy more players might also be a
reason.
Why has the hamstring injury rate increased during
training?
W
e have not evaluated the reasons for the observed increase in
hamstring injury rates, but we can provide possible explanations.
One reason could be that the focus of training sessions included
more repeated high-intensity actions that replicate the evolving
nature of the game. Many top-level coaches want the training
sessions to mirror the demands of a match, with similar inten-
sity and movement patterns. This shift towards repeated high-

 intensity actions (high-speed running with increased number of
accelerations and decelerations) increases the risk of hamstring
injuries (the sprinter’s injury).
Why has the hamstring injury rate during match play not
changed?
If training sessions are mimicking matches, the players are
better prepared for match situations. If there is a deliberate
overload stimulus at training, to achieve the desired training
effect, this strategy might increase the incidence of training
injuries, but, on the other hand, the players who are fit will
be
better
prepared
for
match
intensity,
which
might reduce the match injury risk. If this tendency con-
tinues, the risk of hamstring injuries at matches will slowly
be lowered while the risk at trainings will approach the risk
at matches.

 Why have hamstring injury rates increased when there are
well-known evidence-based preventive measures?
Eccentric muscle actions have been discussed as important
mechanisms in the causation of hamstring injuries,7 and eccen-
tric resistance training such as the NH exercise programme has
been widely promoted for injury prevention.5–9 W
e were sur-
prised that, in the current study, hamstring injury rate at training
and the burden of these injuries increased yearly over the sur-
veillance period, and the hamstring injuries at matches remained
at the same high level in spite of the well-known evidence-based
preventive measures.
On the other hand, any preventive measures for hamstring
injuries could have been counteracted by an increased intensity
of the game over the years. For example, Barnes et al19 investi-
gated the evolution of physical and technical performance from
seasons 2006/2007 to 2012/2013 in the English Premier
League, and found a 30% increase in high-intensity running dis-
tance and actions, and a 35% increase in sprint distance and
number of sprints over the years. They also found a significantly
higher proportion of explosive sprints during the season 2012/
2013 compared with 7 years earlier. Consequently, an increase
in the hamstring injury rate would be natural if such actions
were increased during the play since, as we previously reported,
70% of hamstring injuries in the UEFA Elite Club Injury Study
occurred during sprinting or high-speed running.20
The importance of successful implementation of injury
prevention measures
The adoption and implementation of the NH exercise was very
low among the 32 clubs participating in the UEFA Elite Club
injury study in the 2014–2015 season; only 5 (16%) of clubs
used the exercise in full.11 Although the reach of the NH exer-
cise was good among the club medical staff (88% were familiar
with it),11 the coaching staff usually decide on training content,
and coaches may not always be prepared to devote training time
to preventive programmes.12 Thus, preventive measures proven
highly efficacious in clinical trials do not necessarily work in
real life on the football field.21 22 The measures have to be suc-
cessfully implemented in the club, but if the players, staff and
officials are not encouraged to use the measures, then the pre-
ventive efforts will fail.23 To progress to the field, practical tools
are needed to bridge the gap between research and practice.21
In our experience, team physicians and other practitioners in
the club medical teams are usually closely following the front-
line of football medicine and are well informed about the latest
research and any preventive measures. However, club medical
staff may not always be able to influence all the factors contrib-
uting to injury. It is therefore important for them to work with
players and coaches, CEOs, presidents and others in the club
managerial staff, to obtain the support, participation and
cooperation necessary for effective preventive actions.
There might be many obstacles to implementing preventive
measures at club level. First, coaches may be concerned about a
lack of football specificity or the validity of the suggested pre-
ventive measures from the club medical staff. For the modern
coach, football specificity is essential, and many coaches want
the training sessions to mimic matches in intensity and move-
ment. Preventive measures involving exercises or movements
not mimicking those in matches might therefore be less attract-
ive for coaches.
Second, perceived lack of time might be another obstacle.
Most professional clubs have a very congested playing calen-
dar,18 with many matches as well as many days and nights of
travelling.18 A tight schedule has a negative effect on the injury
situation and the availability of players for training sessions,
with increased muscle injury rates found in periods of match
congestion.16 Consequently, coaches could be reluctant to
include
any
time-consuming
preventive
measures
in
their
regular training schedule. It is worth noting, however, that the

 NH exercise, for instance, is to be carried out 1–2 times per
week in the maintenance phase of the programme,9 10 which
would only take around 5 min from other practice.
Third, another obstacle might be negative opinions from
players. Players could consider preventive training boring and
may even report about side-effects such as muscle soreness. In
their RCT of NH training, Petersen et al8 described that most
players in the intervention group initially experienced muscle
soreness of the hamstrings. In our survey on adoption of the
NH exercise in professional football, 6 of 50 participating clubs
(12%) reported ‘many’ or ‘more than a few’ complaints from
players, and 12 (24%) reported frequent coach complaints,
respectively.12
Targeting player factors—not enough for injury prevention?
Most injury prevention programmes in football have addressed
internal risk factors by providing players with exercises aimed at
increasing person-related skills such as strength, balance, coord-
ination and flexibility.5 8 24–29 There is currently good evidence
that various neuromuscular training programmes can success-
fully reduce lower limb injuries among youth players.25 28–30
Theoretically, such training programmes may have greater effect
on youth players because these players are relatively less skilled
and have not yet fully established their basic movement patterns.
In contrast, professional senior footballers already perform to a
high
physical
standard
and
additional
non-football-specific
(without the ball) physical training may not be as effective as it
is in youth players.
External factors, such as player load and match frequency,
might be important mechanisms underlying injuries.16 17 The
training load on players is traditionally decided by the coaching
staff, whereas the long-term load, such as planning the season,
promotional activities, etc, is normally decided by the board in
cooperation with the coaching staff, but usually without influ-
ence from the medical staff. The overall training load is the sum
of football training and fitness training. These two programmes
are often run by different members of the coaching and fitness
staff, and good internal communication is important to monitor
and adapt the load on individual players.31
Other factors, such as consistency and the stability of the club
in terms of coaching, medical staff and management, as well as
the playing style of the team, could also be important external
factors to consider in injury prevention. Therefore, decision
makers (eg, coaches and managers) could play important roles
in injury prevention and be decisive for the overall injury situ-
ation in a club. However, such external factors have not yet
been evaluated in injury studies.
Methodological considerations
The main strength of this study is the substantial prospective
data set obtained from a homogeneous group of male profes-
sional footballers. In addition, both the primary analysis, using
linear regression with log-transformed injury rates as the
dependent variable, and the ‘sensitivity analysis’, using a 2-year
MA approach presented similar findings, indicate that the data
set and the observed time trends are robust.
There are some limitations with the current study. First, the
participating teams varied during the study period, with only a
few teams participating in all 13 consecutive seasons. This
means that a change in the included teams could affect the
reported injury rates over the 13-year period. The general time
trends were, however, similar in a previous report between
teams participating during the whole study period and the other
teams making this effect less likely in the current study as

 well.12 Second, the clubs were not provided with any specific
diagnostic criteria for hamstring injury and the data set therefore
most probably comprises heterogeneous material of both struc-
tural and functional muscle injuries.32 Third, it is unclear
whether the observed increased time-trend is true for all three
hamstring muscles (biceps femoris, semitendinosus and semi-
membranosus), since this was not routinely specified in the
injury reports during the first years of the study.20 Fourth, there
were no return-to-play criteria in our study manual, and it is
therefore possible that the reported lay off time and reinjury fre-
quency varied between clubs due to the different diagnostic and
treatment algorithms.
A further limitation is that we only studied time trends and
not the mechanisms behind the injuries. W
e have highlighted
several likely mechanisms, but also appreciate that factors such
as prolonged time before medical team give permission to
return to play, or preventative lay off in case of minor symp-
toms, may play a role.

Time-trend analysis in hamstring injury burden (injury rate×mean absence per injury) showing a significant annual 4.1% increase over
the 13-year period (black), and the moving average (MA) approach indicating a 4.0% yearly increase (grey). The Y-axis is not proportional.
What are the findings?
▸ The training-related hamstring injury rate and injury burden
in men’s professional football players have increased
substantially since 2001.
▸ The time-trend analyses showed an annual average 2.3%
increase in the hamstring injury rate year over year and
4.1% increase in the total hamstring injury burden over the
13-year study period.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ Hamstring injury has been the single most common injury
type in professional football for many years. The findings of
increasing trend in injury rate are worrying, and prevention
of hamstring injury should be given the highest priority.
▸ Factors such as player load, match frequency, playing style,
team management, continuity of club medical and technical
staff, etc, could be important underlying external risk factors
for hamstring injury, and should be considered in future
hamstring injury prevention initiatives and injury
management.
