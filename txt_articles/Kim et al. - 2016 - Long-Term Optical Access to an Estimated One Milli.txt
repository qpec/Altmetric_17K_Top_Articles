SUMMARY
A major technological goal in neuroscience is to
enable the interrogation of individual cells across
the live brain. By creating a curved glass replacement
to the dorsal cranium and surgical methods for its
installation, we developed a chronic mouse prepa-
ration providing optical access to an estimated
800,000–1,100,000 individual neurons across the
dorsal surface of neocortex. Post-surgical histo-
logical studies revealed comparable glial activation
as in control mice. In behaving mice expressing
a Ca2+ indicator in cortical pyramidal neurons, we
performed Ca2+ imaging across neocortex using
an epi-fluorescence macroscope and estimated
that 25,000–50,000 individual neurons were acces-
sible per mouse across multiple focal planes. Two-
photon microscopy revealed dendritic morphologies
throughout neocortex, allowed time-lapse imaging of
individual cells, and yielded estimates of >1 million
accessible neurons per mouse by serial tiling. This
approach supports a variety of optical techniques
and enables studies of cells across >30 neocortical
areas in behaving mice.
INTRODUCTION
Chronic preparations allowing long-term optical access to the
live mammalian brain have greatly expanded our understanding
of how the attributes of single neurons and neural ensembles
relate to brain function. In mice, common methods for repeated
imaging across weeks include glass cranial window (Goldey
et al., 2014; Holtmaat et al., 2009), thinned skull, (Drew et al.,
2010; Silasi et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2010), chemically induced
cranial transparency (Silasi et al., 2016), and implanted microen-
doscope preparations (Barretto et al., 2011; Ziv et al., 2013).
These approaches have allowed in vivo imaging studies of
sub-cellular morphology (Attardo et al., 2015; Grutzendler
et al., 2002; Trachtenberg et al., 2002), ensemble neural Ca2+ ac-
tivity (Huber et al., 2012; Peters et al., 2014; Rubin et al., 2015),
and aggregate neural activation (Murphy et al., 2016), as well
as studies that combined optogenetics and in vivo imaging (Car-
rillo-Reid et al., 2016; Packer et al., 2015; Rickgauer et al., 2014).
In parallel to these advances, the aim of understanding how
different brain areas interact has led to specialized microscopes
that can concurrently monitor cells in two or more brain areas
that are contiguous (Chen et al., 2016; Sofroniew et al., 2016;
Stirman et al., 2016) or widely separated (Lecoq et al., 2014).
For use with such instruments, existing preparations for long-
term cellular-level imaging in mice make areas of brain tissue
up to �5 mm in diameter optically accessible (Holtmaat et al.,
2009; Lecoq et al., 2014; Packer et al., 2015; Stirman et al.,
2016; Wekselblatt et al., 2016).
A key technical goal has been to interrogate even broader
portions of the mammalian brain at cellular and sub-cellular res-
olution. The advent of transgenic mice that in principle allow
brain-wide studies of cellular morphology (Feng et al., 2000),
ensemble neural Ca2+ activity (Dana et al., 2014; Madisen
et al., 2015; Wekselblatt et al., 2016), or immediate early gene
activation (Vousden et al., 2015) has made the development of
chronic preparations and optical instruments with broader fields
of view all the more pressing. Several advisory groups (Alivisatos
et al., 2012, 2013) and the NIH BRAIN Initiative (BRAIN Initiative,
2014) have stressed the need to increase the number of individ-
ual cells whose dynamics can be monitored simultaneously in
behaving mammals. By combining large-field, cranial viewing
windows and future instruments for observing brain activity
across multiple length scales, it might be possible to track the
concurrent dynamics of hundreds of thousands to >1 million in-
dividual cells in active animals.
Here, we introduce a chronic mouse preparation that may help
to reach this goal by allowing long-term optical access, at cellular
and sub-cellular resolution, across the dorsal cortical surface.
We term our preparation the ‘‘Crystal Skull,’’ and it is compatible

 with a variety of imaging and photo-stimulation modalities. After a
single surgery, the preparation can provide access in awake mice
to the Ca2+ activity of an estimated 25,000–50,000 cortical neu-
rons via one-photon fluorescence imaging and an estimated >1
million neurons via two-photon imaging. It is not yet feasible to
monitor all these cells individually at the same time. Nevertheless,
that a single surgery affords access to this many individual cells
provides compelling motivation to engineer instrumentation
capable of neural recordings at a massive scale.
RESULTS
Curved Glass Replacement for the Dorsal Cranium
The central idea behind the Crystal Skull method is to cut and
curve a microscope cover glass to match both the lateral extent
and natural curvature of the mouse skull (Figure 1A). Unlike con-
ventional cranial window methods, which use a flat cover glass,
the curved window imparts far less mechanical compression to
underlying tissue. Compression of brain tissue is relatively mini-
mal with flat windows a few millimeters in diameter, but it be-
comes more substantial with larger windows. For example, a
flat window over an 8-mm-diameter craniotomy compresses
tissue at the center of the opening by �0.8 mm perpendicular
to the glass. The need to match the cranium’s natural curvature
is especially important for windows encasing both cortical hemi-
spheres; such windows unavoidably cover the major mid-line
blood vessels (Figure 1B), and damage to these vessels can
compromise brain health.
Notably, the Crystal Skull technique is distinct from methods
that involve thinning the skull over broad areas of the brain (Silasi
et al., 2013), and there are key differences regarding the creation,
optical quality, and stability of the resulting preparations. First, in
our experience, it is faster and easier to replace the dorsal skull
with glass than to try and thin uniformly the entire dorsal skull
without rupturing it. Second, the optical quality of the Crystal
Skull window is commercial optical grade; by comparison, the
optical quality of a thinned skull preparation is limited by the
intrinsic material variations and surface roughness of a thinned
skull bone (Helm et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010). Third, the Crystal
Skull preparation is stable over months (Figure 1B), whereas
skull re-growth generally alters the optical quality of a thinned
skull preparation.
As the Crystal Skull involves a cranial replacement of unprece-
dented size in the mouse, requiring removal of most of the left and
right parietal bones and a part of the frontal bone, we devised a
way to minimize mechanical stress on the brain while installing
the curved window (Experimental Procedures; Table S1; Figures
S1 and S2). Our procedure seeks to minimize both compression
and expansion of the brain (Figure S1). After implantation of the
window, it usually remained clear for months, with negligible
inflammation and skull re-growth (n = 18 mice; Figures 1B and
1C). In a subset of mice (n = 4), 2–5 weeks after surgery, we per-
formed histological analyses to check for activated astrocytes by
immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). We chose
GFAP due to its persistence at a glial scar for longer periods than
a microglial marker such as CD68 (Attardo et al., 2015). These
studies revealed comparable glial activation in cortical tissue
from Crystal Skull mice and in control mice that had no surgeries
(Figures 1C and S3). We also immunostained for NG2 glia and
found comparable labeling patterns in both groups.
In Vivo Imaging of Neural Morphology across the Cortex

across cortex, we used two-photon microscopy to examine

 neural morphologies in anesthetized Thy1-YFP-H mice (Feng
et al., 2000; Grutzendler et al., 2002), which express the yellow
fluorescent protein (YFP) in a subset of layer 5 pyramidal cells
(n = 3 mice). We acquired tiled series of three-dimensional image
stacks arranged parallel to either the mediolateral or anterior-
posterior axes (Figures 2A–2E). The images had sub-cellular res-
olution throughout (Figures 2B–2E), as illustrated by the apical
dendrites seen across the 8.9-mm lateral span (Figures 2B and
2C). Using 20–50 mW of illumination delivered to the brain, pyra-
midal cell bodies were visible up to �700 mm below the cortical
surface, as were individual dendritic branches (Figure 2D). We
attained comparable resolution and imaging depths across the
glass window’s anterior-posterior span (Figure 2E).
Using a sparsely fluorescent mouse line (Thy-1-GFP-M) ex-
pressing GFP in a minority of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (Feng
et al., 2000), we performed high-magnification two-photon im-
aging of neural dendrites at multiple regions of interest (ROIs)
across the Crystal Skull (n = 2 mice) (Figure 2F). Dendritic
spines were readily discernible, as expected from prior in vivo
imaging studies of these mice (Trachtenberg et al., 2002) (Fig-
ure 2G–2I).
Large-Scale Ca2+ Imaging in Awake Mice
We next evaluated our capacity to monitor neural activity across
the dorsal cortex of behaving mice. We installed curved windows
in GCaMP6f-tTA-dCre mice expressing the Ca2+-indicator
GCaMP6f in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (Madisen et al., 2015)
and used a variable-zoom, low-magnification epi-fluorescence
macroscope to visualize Ca2+ activity across the entirety of the
Crystal Skull while the mice were head-fixed and awake (n = 7
mice). Although the objective lens (1.03 magnification) was not
optimized for high-resolution imaging, we readily observed indi-
vidual active neurons in multiple cortical areas (Figures 3A and
3B; Movies S1, S2, and S3). Due to the brain’s curvature, it
was not possible to keep layer 2/3 in focus across the entire field
of view; at a fixed focal setting, active cells were plainly apparent
in some areas but out of focus in others (Movies S1 and S2).
Nonetheless, we could bring each visible brain area into
focus simply by adjusting the focal plane. For example, in awake
head-restrained GCaMP6f-tTA-dCre mice (n = 2) to which we
presented sets of five visual flashes followed by water reward
(Figure 3C; Supplemental Experimental Procedures), we used
the macroscope to perform one-photon Ca2+ imaging in four
distinct brain areas, with each area examined serially on each
of four successive days (Figures 3D–3G). In these studies,
many visual neurons exhibited Ca2+ activity time-locked to visual
stimulation, and many somatosensory neurons activated at
reward delivery, whereas cells in the retrosplenial and motor
cortices had more heterogeneous responses (Figure 3G).
We estimated the total number of GCaMP6f-expressing
cells that were identifiable by one-photon Ca2+ imaging. Using
Ca2+ videos acquired in 1.3 3 1.3-mm2 tissue areas (n = 4
GCaMP6f-tTA-dCre mice) (Movie S3), computational cell sorting
identified up to 1,166 neurons per sample area (Figure 3B). The
resulting estimated cellular densities, when scaled to the entire
Crystal Skull, suggest that �25,000–50,000 individual layer 2/3
neurons are available for one-photon Ca2+ imaging in this mouse
line (Experimental Procedures).
As one-photon Ca2+ imaging is limited to �150–200 mm depths
into brain tissue (Hamel et al., 2015), we next used two-photon
microscopy to study the GCaMP6f-tTa-dCre mice and also
tetO-GCaMP6s/CaMK2a-tTA mice expressing the Ca2+ indicator
GCaMP6s in a subset of pyramidal neurons (Figure 4) (Weksel-
blatt et al., 2016). Individual cells were visible across cortex in
two-photon image mosaics and could be tracked over days (Fig-
ures 4A and 4B). To estimate the total number of GCaMP6s-ex-
pressing cells accessible by two-photon imaging, we randomly
selected 460-mm 3 460-mm regions of interest and monitored
Ca2+ activity at a series of depths 100–500 mm below the cortical
surface (n = 4 volumes sampled in 3 mice; Figures 4C and 4D;
Movie S4). To identify individual cells and their activity traces in
the resulting datasets, we performed computational cell sorting
on the Ca2+ videos taken at each tissue depth (Experimental Pro-
cedures). This yielded high-fidelity activity traces from cells up to
500 mm beneath the glass window (Figures 4E–4G). We tallied the
total number of active cells while ensuring that cells visible in
axially adjacent image planes contributed only once to the count.
The densities of cortical neurons identified by their Ca2+ activity
were consistent with values found previously by two-photon
Ca2+ imaging (Huber et al., 2012; Lecoq et al., 2014; Peters
et al., 2014). When scaled to the area of the entire Crystal Skull,
the tallies of active cells in GCaMP6s/CaMK2a-tTA mice imply
that an estimated 0.8–1.1 million cortical neurons are accessible
by in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging.
DISCUSSION
By shaping optical-grade glass to mimic the curved form of the
mouse skull and creating surgical methods to install this cranial
replacement, we attained chronic optical access to individual
cells across the dorsal cortex. The implant is stable for months
(Figure 1B), and based on the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (Oh
et al., 2014), cells are visible across 30–40 brain areas. The
access to individual cells is a crucial distinction from prior
preparations in which the skull is thinned over the entire cranial
surface or rendered transparent by chemical means, as these
past methods have not enabled cellular imaging (Silasi et al.,
2013, 2016). We estimated that 25,000–50,000 individual
neurons are accessible per mouse using wide-field epi-fluores-
cence imaging, and >1 million active cells are accessible by
two-photon microscopy.
Using a green fluorescent indicator and two-photon imaging,
we tracked the Ca2+ dynamics of cells up to �500 mm below
the cortical surface; by using indicators with longer excitation
wavelengths, even greater tissue depths and more cells will be
accessible (Dana et al., 2016; Inoue et al., 2015). A range of
imaging and optogenetic methods can be combined with the
Crystal Skull preparation, which is also compatible with many
different behavioral assays for head-fixed mice.
Implications for the Design of Brain Imaging Studies
Owing to its span across the cortex, the Crystal Skull may allow
brain imaging or optogenetic studies that are more unbiased
than those conducted to date. In past studies of cellular activity,
researchers usually had to select one or a few brain areas at the
outset of experimentation. However, neocortical areas share a

 complex web of connections, both direct and indirect, and it
seems likely that the commonly studied behavioral assays
engage brain areas well beyond those that have attracted the
most research. A more unbiased approach using the Crystal
Skull might help reduce the need to choose candidate brain
areas for study based on previous knowledge.
Researchers using the Crystal Skull might identify brain areas
of interest based on the empirically determined neural responses
evoked by specific stimuli or behaviors. An individualized mode
of study could take into account that different mice might have
unique neural activity patterns meriting customized follow-up in-
vestigations. Future studies might seek to explain the differences
between individual mice on the basis of their distinctive brain ac-
tivity patterns. Aiding such an approach, the Crystal Skull might
facilitate quantitative comparisons across multiple brain areas
and tailoring of optical investigations to the dynamical patterns
found in each animal.
Implications for Systems Neuroscience Research
Research advisory groups and the NIH have called for new tech-
nologies that can track the dynamics of >1 million individual neu-
rons in behaving animals (Alivisatos et al., 2012, 2013; BRAIN
Initiative, 2014). Candidate recording modalities with this ca-
pacity might use signals that are electrical, optical, or of another
energy form. On its own, the Crystal Skull does not reach this
milestone. However, the access it provides to >1 million active
cells after one surgery suggests that a promising route to realizing
massive recordings in the live brain may lie in the optical domain.
To make full use of the Crystal Skull preparation, researchers
should engineer several types of new instrumentation. Our com-
mercial epi-fluorescence macroscope cannot attain cellular
resolution across the entire dorsal cortex, at high numerical
aperture, in a single image frame. Surpassing this limitation
might require superior wide-field optics, fast scientific-grade
cameras of greater pixel counts, and means of sampling the
entire depth of field of the curved cortical surface. Several fluo-
rescence-imaging modalities with an extended depth of field
already exist and show promise for further improvements (Brox-
ton et al., 2013; Fahrbach et al., 2013; Prevedel et al., 2014;
Quirin et al., 2014).
Similarly, extant two-photon microscopes can only sample a
portion of the tissue volume that is accessible via the Crystal
Skull unless a tiling strategy is used. Recent work has expanded
the field of view that is addressable by laser-scanning two-
photon microscopy (Chen et al., 2016; Lecoq et al., 2014; Sofro-
niew et al., 2016; Stirman et al., 2016), proposed new forms of
scanless volumetric imaging (Prevedel et al., 2014; Watson
et al., 2010), and demonstrated variants of two-photon imaging
in which more than one illumination beam sweeps across brain
tissue (Chen et al., 2016; Lecoq et al., 2014; Stirman et al.,
2016). However, no microscope today comes close to being
able to track simultaneously the million or more cells that the
Crystal Skull makes available for long-term imaging in the adult
mouse brain.
Although it is possible to envision advanced instrumentation
for imaging across the Crystal Skull at cellular resolution, notable
constraints come from the total energy and spatial distribution of
illumination that the brain can safely tolerate (Marblestone et al.,
2013). Perhaps equally vital as new instrumentation may be the
development of fluorescent indicators of neural activity that
provide high signal-detection fidelities while operating at weak
illumination intensities. A fluorescent indicator’s absorption
cross-section and molecular brightness are key parameters,
but signal-detection theory also shows that indicators with
ultra-low baseline emissions can enable high-fidelity detection
with only modest emission intensities (Wilt et al., 2013). To
design strategies for concurrent recordings of as many neurons
as possible via the Crystal Skull, it may be necessary to take a
holistic, systems engineering approach that optimizes the opti-
cal instrumentation and indicators jointly (BRAIN Initiative, 2014).
In the immediate future we expect that multiple strategies
based on established optical techniques will make use of the
new possibilities introduced here for imaging broad fields of
view, relating observations across length scales from microns
to millimeters, and studying interactions between tens of brain
areas in behaving mice. Through longitudinal studies of both
ensemble activity patterns and single cell properties, it should
also be possible to examine the long-term dynamics of the
brain’s network attributes in a multi-scale manner.

Laboratory, #024742; B6.Cg-Tg(CaMK2a-tTA)1Mmay/DboJ; Jackson Labora-
tory, #007004) and triple transgenic GCaMP6f-tTA-dCre mice from the Allen
Institute (Rasgrf2-2A-dCre/CaMK2a-tTA/Ai93). Mice were 10–16 weeks old
at the time of surgery and resided in a reverse-light-cycle facility.
Curved Glass Windows
We designed trapezoidal shapes in optical-grade glass stock (0.2–0.3 mm
thickness; Schott, D263T) and had them commercially cut (TLC International)
and bent to a desired curvature by heating and pressing against a cylindrical
graphite mold (GlasWerk) (Figure 1A). We cleaned curved glass pieces in
soap and water in an ultrasonicator and then washed and stored them in
ethanol prior to surgical implantation.
Surgery
Step-by-step instructions for installing the Crystal Skull implant are listed in
Table S1. We anesthetized mice with isoflurane (4% for induction and 1%–
2% during surgery). To minimize inflammation and brain edema, we injected
carprofen (5–10 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) subcutaneously prior
to surgical incision. We applied ointment to the mouse’s eyes to maintain their
moisture. A heating pad (FHC, 40-90-8D) maintained the mouse’s body tem-
perature at 37�C.
We removed the skin atop the cranium and cleaned the skull surface with a
scalpel while continuously perfusing mammalian Ringer’s solution (Electron
Microscopy Science, #11763-10) over the surgical area. Next, we performed
a craniotomy matched in size and shape to the outline of the trapezoidal glass
implant (Figures 1A and S1). To make the craniotomy, we first created a shallow
groove along the perimeter of the trapezoid using a 0.7-mm-diameter drill (Fine
Science Tools, 19007-07). We used a 0.5-mm-diameter drill (Fine Science
Tools, 19007-05) to deepen the groove and disconnect the trapezoidal-shaped
bone piece from the surrounding skull. We perfused mammalian Ringer’s solu-
tion throughout the drilling. Once the bone piece was disconnected from the
skull, we pressed down gently on its anterior edge to elevate its posterior end
(Figure S1B). We slid the glass window underneath the elevated bone piece
while taking care to avoid scraping the brain surface. When approximately
two-thirds of the glass was inserted, we removed the overlying bone piece
with forceps while continuing to position the glass implant. We performed all
steps under continuous perfusion of Ringer’s solution. We left the dura intact.
Once the Crystal Skull implant was in its final position, we dried its edges
with surgical eye spears (Butler Schein Animal Health, #1556455) and glued
the window to the skull with UV-light-cured adhesive (UV glue; Loctite,
4305). To allow head fixation during optical brain imaging, we installed a stain-
less steel annular head plate (12 mm inner diameter) (Figure S2A). We set the
head plate around the glass window and filled the gap between the head plate
and the skull with UV glue. After curing the glue, we cleaned the surface of the
window and covered it with a hemispherical protective cap printed in plastic
(Figure S2B). We transferred the mouse to a recovery cage and placed it on
a heating pad until it awoke. We then returned the mouse to its home cage
and provided food and water on the cage floor without use of a food hopper,
which might have disturbed the protective cap. We subcutaneously adminis-
tered the mice carprofen (5–10 mg/kg) for the first 3 days after surgery. For
the first 7 days after surgery, we checked all mice daily for signs of distress.
We resumed feeding using a food hopper 14 days after surgery.
In Vivo Brain Imaging
We acquired all two-photon fluorescence images using a commercial micro-
scope (Bruker, Ultima). A Ti:sapphire laser (Spectra Physics, Mai Tai BB) pro-
vided ultrashort-pulsed illumination (920 nm center wavelength). We used a
203 0.95 numerical aperture (NA) water-immersion objective lens (Olympus,
XLUMPlanFL N) in all cases, except for acquisition of the three-dimensional
image stacks taken along the medio-lateral axis (Figure 2B), for which we
used a 163 0.80 NA water-immersion lens (Nikon, CFI75 LWD 16xW). Mean
illumination power delivered to the brain was 20–50 mW, depending on the
depth in tissue of the focal plane. We detected fluorescence signals (500- to
550-nm wavelengths) using a band-pass filter (Chroma, ET525/50m-2p) and
a GaAsP photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu, H10770PA-40). All images had
512 3 512 pixels.
To acquire images of neural morphology (Figure 2), we anesthetized mice
with isoflurane (4% induction, 1%–2% during imaging) and head-fixed them
under the microscope objective lens using the head-plate implanted during
surgery. We applied eye ointment and maintained body temperature at
36�C. We acquired tiled sets of three-dimensional image stacks parallel to
the medio-lateral (ML) or anterior-posterior (AP) axes (Figure 2A). Along the
ML direction (Figure 2B) we took 17 image stacks, with adjacent stacks
spaced 500 mm apart, using the 163 0.80 NA objective lens. Along the AP
direction (Figure 2E), we took 12 image stacks, with the stacks spaced
400 mm apart, using the 203 0.95 NA objective lens. The separations between
adjacent stacks were less than the widths of the individual field-of-views
(660 mm with the 163 objective and 460 mm with the 203 lens); thus, we
achieved full coverage of the sampled tissue volumes (red and blue dashed
boxes in Figure 2A). After locating the brain surface we acquired a stack of
two-photon images starting from the pia and extending 500–800 mm into
tissue. All stacks had 2 mm axial spacing between adjacent images.
To acquire two-photon Ca2+ videos in awake mice, we head-fixed them
under the microscope objective lens using their implanted head plate; the
mice could walk or run in place on a 11.4-mm-diameter Styrofoam ball
(Plasteel) with two rotational degrees of freedom. We took all two-photon
Ca2+ videos over a 460-mm 3 460-mm field of view at a 1.5-Hz frame rate
with the 203 0.95 NA objective. We sampled columnar tissue volumes (Fig-
ure 4D) by acquiring 500 image frames at each axial depth, starting 100 mm
below the pial surface and extending in increments of 10–20 mm to 500 mm
below the surface.
We acquired epi-fluorescence images on a variable zoom macroscope
(Leica, MZFL III) with a plan 1.03 objective lens (Leica, 10445819) and an
sCMOS camera (Andor, Zyla). For Ca2+ imaging, we used a filter set designed
for GFP (Leica, 10450756). A solid-state white light engine (Lumencor, Sola SM
5-LCR-VA) coupled to a 3-mm-diameter liquid light guide provided �50 mW of
illumination across a �10-mm-diameter area. We head-fixed mice by their
head plate under the objective lens; the mice could walk or run at liberty on
a wheel (Innovive, Innowheel). The macroscope had a field of view (FOV) of
8 mm 3 11 mm at a 1.33 zoom setting, sufficient to image the entire Crystal
Skull implant (Movie S1). Alternatively, we used a 4-mm 3 5-mm FOV at a
zoom setting of 3.23 (Movie S2). We acquired Ca2+ videos used for extraction
of individual cells at a 9.5-Hz frame rate. Over recording durations of <5 min,
we observed no bleaching or signs of photodamage.
Mouse Behavior
During epi-fluorescence imaging of neural Ca2+ activity, each trial of the
behavioral protocol began with five flashes of blue light (pulses 0.1 ms in dura-
tion, timed to begin 0.2 ms apart) visible to the mouse’s right eye. After a 1.7-s
delay, the mouse then received a water reward. The inter-trial interval varied
between 4 and 6 s.
On the first day of imaging, we monitored Ca2+ activity at a low optical
magnification across the cortex for four periods of 3.5 min each. On the next
three consecutive days, we imaged neural Ca2+ activity in each of four,

 successively examined cortical regions of interest (Figure 3D). The mouse
performed 24–26 behavioral trials during examination of each of these areas.
Figure 3D is from the first day of imaging, and Figures 3E–3G are from the third
day. Supplemental Experimental Procedures has details of the behavioral
setup and training.
Mosaic Images of Neural Morphology
Supplemental Experimental Procedures has details of how we computation-
ally tiled images from across the cortex (Figures 2B and 2E).
Computational Identification of Individual Cells
To extract cells and their activity traces from the Ca2+ movies, we first cor-
rected for brain motion by using the TurboReg algorithm to perform rigid image
displacements and rotations (The
´ venaz et al., 1998). To sort cells from one-
photon Ca2+ videos, we used a method based on maximum likelihood maximi-
zation (Deneux et al., 2016; Harris et al., 2016). To sort cells from two-photon
Ca2+ movies, we used the constrained non-negative matrix factorization
(CNMF) cell-sorting algorithm (Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016). Outlines of the cells
shown in Figures 3B, 3E, 3F, and Figures 4E–4G were computed as the con-
tours at which each cell’s computationally determined spatial filter declined
to 30% of its peak value. See Supplemental Experimental Procedures for
details.
Estimates of Optically Accessible Active Cells
As it was not practical to sample all the cortical volume under the Crystal Skull
at high resolution, we computed the total number of cells that were accessible
via one- and two-photon imaging by determining the cell density in several
randomly chosen ROIs and then using these values to estimate the total num-
ber of accessible cells over the 73.75 mm2 Crystal Skull window (Figure 1A).
For one-photon Ca2+ imaging, we made estimates in four mice and ex-
tracted 1,166 cells in a 1.3-mm 3 1.3-mm area (Figure 3B), 708 cells in a
1.3-mm 3 1.3-mm area, 447 cells in a 1.5-mm 3 0.85-mm area, and 769 cells
in a 1.35-mm 3 1.05-mm area. These values yielded estimates of 26,000–
51,000 total accessible cells.
To estimate the number of cells accessible by two-photon imaging, using a
common sampling protocol (Figure 4D) we sampled four separate volumes of
interest, each with a 460-mm 3 460-mm cross-section and axial planes spaced
10.5–12.5 mm apart, in three different mice. These volumes yielded 3,243
active cells (blue ROI in Figure 4C; 38 imaging planes), 2,939 active cells (green
ROI in Figure 4C; 35 imaging planes), 3,000 active cells (32 planes), and 3,103
active cells (28 planes). These values project to 1.02–1.13 million accessible
neurons across the Crystal Skull. A fifth volume, which we sampled at lower
density with the axial planes spaced 20 mm apart (red ROI in Figure 4C;
20 planes), yielded an estimate of 804,000 total accessible cells. In making
these estimates, we ensured that individual cells visible in axially adjacent
image planes contributed only once to our tallies. To do this, we created for
each cell in every plane a binary mask, attained by thresholding the cell’s
spatial filter at 30% of its peak intensity. Then, for every pair of cells identified
in axially adjacent planes, we defined an overlap score as the area of intersec-
tion of the two cells’ masks, divided by the area of the union of the two masks.
We identified candidate cell pairs as two images of the same cell when the
overlap score was >0.5.
