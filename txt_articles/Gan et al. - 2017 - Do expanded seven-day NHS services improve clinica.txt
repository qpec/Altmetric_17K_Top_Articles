Abstract
Background: The cause of adverse weekend clinical outcomes remains unknown. In 2013, the “NHS Services, Seven
Days a Week” project was initiated to improve access to services across the seven-day week. Three years on, we
sought to analyse the impact of such changes across the English NHS.
Methods: Aggregated trust-level data on crude mortality rates, Summary Hospital-Level Mortality Indicator (SHMI),
mean length of stay (LOS), A&E admission and four-hour breach rates were obtained from national Hospital Episode
Statistics and A&E datasets across the English NHS, excluding mental and community health trusts. Trust annual
reports were analysed to determine the presence of any seven-day service reorganisation in 2013–2014. Funnel
plots were generated to compare institutional performance and a difference in differences analysis was performed
to determine the impact of seven-day changes on clinical outcomes between 2013 and 2014, 2014–2015 and
2015–2016. Data was summarised as mean (SD).
Results: Of 159 NHS trusts, 79 (49.7%) instituted seven-day changes in 2013–2014. Crude mortality rates, A&E
admission rates and mean LOS remained relatively stable between 2013 and 2016, whilst A&E four-hour breach
rates nearly doubled from 5.3 to 9.7%. From 2013 to 2014 to 2014–2015 and 2015–2016, there were no significant
differences in the change in crude mortality (2014–2015 p = 0.8, 2015–2016 p = 0.9), SHMI (2014–2015 p = 0.5,
2015–2016 p = 0.5), mean LOS (2014–2015 p = 0.5, 2015–2016 p = 0.4), A&E admission (2014–2015 p = 0.6,
2015–2016 p = 1.0) or four-hour breach rates (2014–2015 p = 0.06, 2015–2016 p = 0.6) between trusts that had
implemented seven-day changes compared to those which had not.
Conclusions: Adverse weekend clinical outcomes may not be ameliorated by large scale reorganisations aimed
at improving access to health services across the week. Such changes may negatively impact care quality without
additional financial investment, as demonstrated by worsening of some outcomes. Detailed prospective research is
required to determine whether such reallocation of finite resources is clinically effective.

 Background
In December 2012 National Health Service (NHS) England
published “Everyone counts: planning for patients 2013/
2014” [1], where plans for seven-day access to NHS services
in the United Kingdom were outlined. This led to the estab-
lishment of an “NHS Services, Seven Days a Week” Forum
(the “Forum”) chaired by the National Medical Director
aimed at initially improving access to diagnostic, urgent
and emergency services across the seven-day week.
The need for these changes were argued to be fourfold –
to improve excess weekend mortality, to increase cost-
efficiency, to move the NHS in line with the retail sector,
and to improve the patient “customer” experience [1–3].
The Healthcare Financial Management Association
(HFMA) subsequently carried out a costing analysis
using a voluntary sample of eight variably sized NHS
trusts at different stages of implementation (Table 1)
[2]. Of these, Salford Royal, Aintree University Hospi-
tals, Guy’s & St. Thomas’ and Chelsea & Westminster
Hospital NHS Foundation Trusts had already made
significant investments prior to the Forum [2, 4–8]. In
2013, both Chelsea & Westminster Hospital and Salford
Royal NHS Foundation Trusts reported significant
additional changes to seven-day care, whilst Guy’s &
St. Thomas’ and County Durham and Darlington NHS
Foundation Trusts made more minor changes [2, 5–7, 9].
Similarly, across England, other NHS trusts started reorga-
nising services to reduce the differences in care provision
across the seven-day week (full list in Additional file 1:
Table S1).
Three years on, various changes to the English NHS,
including reformation of consultants’ and junior doctors’
contracts have been deemed necessary for a fully com-
prehensive seven-day service [10, 11]. Their basis has
been primarily the excess 30-day mortality associated
with weekend admissions demonstrated in two analyses
of national Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) datasets
from 2009 to 2010 and 2013–2014 by Freemantle et al.,
despite the authors stating it would be “rash and mis-
leading” to attribute this to deficits in service provision
[12, 13]. Given the three-year interval from the original
Forum report, we aimed to review changes in clinical
outcomes across the English NHS between 2013 and 2016,
comparing NHS Trusts that had introduced seven-day

 changes between 2013 and 2014 and 2014–2015 to those
which had not as part of what was essentially a natural
intervention study. We aimed to test the null hypothesis
that there were no significant differences in outcomes be-
tween these two groups during this interval.
Methods
Data sources
Aggregated trust-level Summary Hospital-level Mortality
Indicator (SHMI; April – March 2013 to 2016) and mean
length of stay (LOS; January – December 2013 to 2016)
data were obtained from openly-accessible national Health
& Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) datasets
(https://indicators.hscic.gov.uk/webview/, accessed 10 De-
cember 2015 and 15 November 2016), [14, 15] whilst ag-
gregated trust-level data on Accident & Emergency (A&E)
admission rates and the number of patients who had brea-
ched four-hour waiting time targets were obtained from
NHS England (https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/stat-
istical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times-and-activity/, accessed
10 December 2015 and 15 November 2016) [16]. The
SHMI is the ratio of the observed to expected number of
deaths either in-hospital or within 30 days of discharge,
with the latter based on the national baseline for England,
calculated from a risk-adjusted model for patient case-mix
including age, gender, admission method, time of year,
Charlson Comorbidity Index [17] and diagnosis [18]. The
four-hour waiting time target was introduced by the De-
partment of Health in 2004 to improve efficiency with the
aim of getting 98% of patients admitted, transferred or
discharged from A&E within 4 h of attending [19]. This
target was relaxed to 95% in 2010.
Annual reports for 2012–2013 and 2013–2014 for
each individual Trust were reviewed to determine if any
seven-day service reorganisation had occurred during
the period of interest. All forms of service reorganisation
were considered, including weekend outpatient clinics
and seven-day changes to mental and community health
care, as these could have knock-on effects on admis-
sions, inpatient bed availability, length of stay and A&E
outcomes. Specialist mental health and community hos-
pitals were excluded from all analyses (Fig. 1), whilst
emergency admission and four-hour breach rate data
from specialist A&Es (e.g. paediatric A&E units) was
included. Due to the expected lag time from when
seven-day service reorganisation was initiated in any
given trust to its full implementation, we analysed out-
comes over both 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 to determine
their full impact.
Statistical analysis
As the units of analysis for each outcome were individual
trusts, the various outcome metrics were summarised
as means (standard deviation (SD)). Funnel plots were
generated to graphically compare institutional perform-
ance against other NHS Trusts across England. This
method of analysis plots a clinical outcome against its
precision, the latter usually proportional to the sample
size [20]. Larger institutions exhibit less variation, so
funnel-shaped “control” limits can be generated around
the target outcome to compare like-sized institutions
against each other. In these analyses, control limits cor-
responding to 95th (±2 SDs) and 99.8th centiles (±3
SDs) were set. Over-dispersion was accounted for by a
random effects model for SHMI [18] and a generalised
linear model for LOS, admission and breach rate data,
both with a 10% trim (detailed methodology in Additional
file 1) [20]. The difference in each of the four outcomes
for each individual trust between 2013 and 2014, 2014–
2015 and 2015–2016 was determined, and an unpaired
t-test was used to compare the difference in differences.
NHS Trusts undergoing significant restructuring through
mergers with other Trusts (Fig. 1) were excluded from
this analysis to provide directly comparable paired
datasets. Funnel and scatter plots were generated using
Microsoft Excel® for Mac 2011 version 14.6 (Microsoft
Corporation, Washington). Dot and error bar plots
were constructed using R version 3.2.4 (R Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna). Statistical analyses
were performed with SPSS® Statistics version 22 (IBM
Corporation, New York).
Results
Baseline characteristics of trusts (Fig. 1, Table 2)
Outcome data from a total of 159 trusts were analysed,
with 79 (49.7%) of these instituting seven-day changes in
2013–2014. Between 2013 to 2016, 11 NHS trusts
underwent mergers to form six new NHS trusts, result-
ing in a final number of 154 trusts by the end of 2016.
Additionally, South London Healthcare NHS Trust was
dissolved in October 2013, with its three constituent
hospitals being taken over by King’s College Hospital
NHS Foundation Trust, Lewisham and Greenwich NHS
Trust, and Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust respectively
(the lattermost Trust was not included in any analysis as
this is a community hospital Trust with no A&E). These
trusts were excluded from all pairwise difference in
differences analyses. Eighteen specialist hospitals were
excluded from the analysis of SHMI data due to the
nature of the patients seen. Fifteen of these hospitals
also did not have an A&E department and were ex-
cluded from analysis of A&E admission and four-hour
breach rate data.
Summary Hospital Mortality Indicator (SHMI)
Overall annual crude mortality rates across the whole of
the English NHS for the periods of April – March 2013
to 2016 were 3.1% (265,179/ 8,455,873 inpatient episodes),
Gan et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2017) 17:552 
Page 3 of 10
 3.3% (286,629/ 8,732,830 inpatient episodes), and 3.2%
(282,723/ 8,825,694 inpatient episodes) respectively.
Crude mortality rates over the three periods were not
significantly different between Trusts that had imple-
mented seven-day changes (n = 70) and those which
had not (n = 60; mean difference: 2013–2014 to 2014–
2015 + 0.2 (0.2)% vs. +0.2 (0.2)%, p = 0.8; 2013–2014 to
2015–2016 + 0.1 (0.3)% vs. +0.1 (0.3)%, p = 0.9).
Trusts were evenly distributed throughout the SHMI
funnel plots for all periods between 2013 to 2016 regard-
less of whether seven-day service reorganisation had
occurred or not (Fig. 2 a-c). Two trusts demonstrated an
increase in SHMI beyond the +3 SD control limit for
2014–2015 despite implementing seven-day changes
(Medway NHS Foundation Trust 1.17 to 1.18, North
Tees & Hartlepool NHS Foundation Trust 1.16 to 1.21),

 whilst Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation
Trust demonstrated an improved SHMI (1.20 to 1.16)
such that it fell from above to below the +3 SD control
limit between the two periods despite not undergoing
any significant seven-day reorganisation. The mean dif-
ferences in SHMI over the three periods were not sig-
nificantly different between trusts that had implemented
seven-day changes (n = 70) and those which had not
(n = 60; mean difference: 2013–2014 to 2014–2015 -0.002
(0.05) vs. +0.004 (0.05), p = 0.5; 2013–2014 to 2015–2016
-0.003 (0.07) vs. +0.005 (0.06), p = 0.5; Fig. 3 a-c).
Mean length of stay (LOS)
Average mean LOS across the English NHS was 4.3 (1.0)
days for 2013–2014, 4.2 (0.9) days for 2014–2015, and
4.2 (1.0) days for 2015–2016. Once again, trusts were
evenly distributed throughout the funnel plots for all
three periods regardless of seven-day changes, with The
Newcastle Upon Tyne NHS Hospitals NHS Foundation
Trust having a mean LOS just beyond the +3 SD control
limit for 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 despite such reorga-
nisation (Fig. 2 d-f). Change in mean LOS was not sig-
nificantly different over the three periods for trusts that
had undergone seven-day service changes (n = 74) in
comparison to those which had not (n = 74, mean differ-
ence: 2013–2014 to 2014–2015 + 0.003 (0.3) vs. -0.02
(0.2) days, p = 0.5; 2013–2014 to 2015–2016 -0.04 (0.3)
vs. -0.08 (0.3) days, p = 0.4; Fig. 3 d-f).
A&E admission rates
The proportion of patients attending English NHS A&Es
who were admitted annually between April – March 2013
to 2016 was 21.8% (3,833,355/ 17,587,556 attendances),
22.1% (4,017,212/ 18,165,842 attendances) and 21.8%
(4,126,579/ 18,969,653 attendances) respectively. There
was no apparent change in pattern of distribution of trusts
on the funnel plots over the three periods, regardless of
seven-day changes, with the Heart of England NHS Foun-
dation Trust remaining above the +3 SD control limit des-
pite seven-day reorganisation (Fig. 2 g-i). A&E admission
rates did not significantly change over the three periods
for trusts that had undergone such changes (n = 72) in
comparison to those that had not (n = 61; mean differ-
ence: 2013–2014 to 2014–2015 + 0.3 (2.4) vs. +0.6 (3.1)%,
p = 0.6; 2013–2014 to 2015–2016 + 0.1 (3.9) vs. +0.1
(5.0)%, p = 1.0; Fig. 3 g-i).
A&E four-hour breach rates
The proportion of English NHS A&E patients who were
not admitted, transferred, or discharged in less than 4 h
rose nationally year on year between April – March
2013 to 2016 (5.3% (934,770/ 17,587,556 attendances),
7.8% (1,413,830/ 18,165,842 attendances), and 9.7%
(1,838,651/ 18,969,653 attendances) respectively). The
distribution of trusts on the funnel plots between April
2013 to March 2014 and April 2014 to March 2015 was
not apparently different between trusts which had and
had not implemented seven-day changes (Fig. 2 j-k). Of
the four trusts implementing seven-day changes that
were above the +3 SD control limit in 2014–2015, two
of these (Medway NHS Foundation Trust and Ports-
mouth Hospitals NHS Trust) had already been above
the +3 SD control limit for 2013–2014. Hull & East
Yorkshire NHS Trust experienced a large increase in the
proportion of patients breaching the four-hour target
(5.1% to 16.5%) such that it exceeded the +3 SD control
limit for the latter period. The fourth, the University
Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust had undergone
a significant merger (previously University Hospital of
North Staffordshire NHS Trust and Mid Staffordshire
NHS Foundation Trust) and therefore differences in out-
comes were difficult to attribute to seven-day changes.
Notably, the marked widening of the funnel plots over
the three periods demonstrated greater variability in
trust performance with an overall worsening in breach
rates, such that in 2015–2016 all trusts fell within the ±3
SD control limits (Fig. 2l). Trusts which had (n = 72)
and had not (n = 61) implemented seven-day changes
both experienced an annual increase in the proportion
of patients breaching the four-hour target with no signifi-
cant difference between the two groups (mean difference:
2013–2014 to 2014–2015 + 2.0 (2.2) vs. +2.8 (2.6)%,
p = 0.06; 2013–2014 to 2015–2016 + 4.2 (3.7) vs. +4.5
(3.4)%, p = 0.6; Fig. 3 j-l).
Discussion
The three-year lapse from the initiation of the “NHS
Services, Seven Days a Week” Forum provided us with
an opportunity to analyse outcomes from what was essen-
tially a natural intervention trial involving all English NHS
trusts, some of which had redesigned urgent, emergency
and some elective services around seven-day working. The
finding that for all outcomes studied, trusts instituting
seven-day changes did not perform, on average, better
than other institutions is unsurprising, particularly as
(See figure on previous page.)

 NHS emergency services already operate 24 h a day, seven
days a week. Our analysis also did not find any significant
improvement in clinical outcomes over time in trusts
which had actively reorganised services in 2013–2014
in comparison to those that had not. More worryingly,
clinical outcomes such as A&E four-hour breach rates
worsened across the English NHS despite approximately
half of all trusts instituting seven-day changes.
In some organisations, despite active restructuring of
services around seven-day care, there was a worsening
or no change in mortality, length of stay and A&E out-
comes. The reasons for this are probably multiple. Service
reorganisation without sufficient additional investment
or a cost-neutral budget could result in weekday care
worsening at the expense of increasing weekend service
provision so that overall outcomes through the seven-day
week are worse or unchanged. Additionally, the associ-
ation between poorer weekend clinical outcomes and
service provision may potentially be non-causal, and
therefore increasing weekend services may not result in
improvement. Contrastingly, some trusts such as Black-
pool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust demon-
strated reductions in SHMI without significant seven-day
reorganisation.
The apparent association between weekend hospital-
isation and increased mortality has been repeatedly dem-
onstrated in several studies carried out in different
countries [12, 13, 21–23] and healthcare settings [24].
Other outcomes such as length of stay [25] and unplanned
readmission rates [26] are also higher for patients admit-
ted over the weekend. However, the definition of what
constitutes a “weekday” and the methods of case-mix ad-
justment in these studies have been variable, [27] and it is
well-recognised that the cause of this association remains
unknown. Several factors have been blamed, including re-
duced availability of senior staff members, diagnostic and
support services [3, 13]. Other possibilities include the fact
that sicker patients are more likely to present over the
weekend and is incompletely adjusted for by various statis-
tical models, or that publications surrounding the “week-
end effect” are systematically biased to detect changes
where there are none [28].
Recent evidence suggests that only 3% of total mortal-
ity is avoidable, [29] and several studies have now
emerged suggesting that the “weekend effect” is unlikely
to be improved by changes in the level of weekend staff-
ing [30–33]. Our analysis supports this, supporting the
assertion that the “weekend effect” is largely due to re-
sidual confounding and not care quality. Unlike previous
studies which have not successfully determined its cause,
[12, 13, 23] this analysis makes an attempt at dissecting
out the effect of widespread reorganisation of clinical
services around a seven-day working week on mortality,
LOS and A&E quality of care, finding that these out-
comes do not largely improve in trusts which have ac-
tively done so.
Despite heterogeneity in the measures taken by individ-
ual trusts to reorganise services, the changes in clinical
outcomes observed between the two periods indicate these
measures have also largely not improved such metrics
as a whole across the English NHS. More worryingly,
outcomes such as A&E four-hour breach rates were
significantly worse on a background of increasing A&E
attendances, suggesting increasing demands on a service
where resources may have been misallocated or insuffi-
cient. We postulate therefore that large-scale changes to
create a truly “seven-day NHS” such as that proposed (e.g.
changes to the definition of unsociable hours working)
may not lead to significant improvements, particularly in a
cost-neutral setting resulting in limited weekday resources
simply being moved to the weekend.
Study limitations
We recognise that our retrospective observational ana-
lysis utilising aggregated, trust-level data from publicly
available national databases of institutional performance
is limited by its quality and resolution, with less capacity
for adjustment of confounding to account for differences
in case-mix observed at individual trusts. As such, we
could only analyse crude mean LOS and A&E outcome
metrics at a trust level, and any differences in these out-
comes between trusts are still subject to confounding
from case-mix variability. Even metrics such as the
SHMI, which attempts to account for this by adjusting
for comorbidities at an individual patient level using
HES data, do not completely adjust for factors such as
the severity of a particular comorbidity or socioeco-
nomic status [34].
Utilisation of aggregated trust-level data also means
that there is a risk of over-interpretation at an individual
level, a concept known as ecological fallacy. For instance,
in this study we categorised trusts as having undergone
seven-day service reorganisation on the basis of any in-

 this would lead to improvements in clinical outcomes. A
patient suffering a stroke on the weekend may have
benefitted (reduced mortality risk, reduced length of stay)
from some forms of seven-day service reorganisation
(such as a 24/7 thrombolysis service) but not others (such
as extended weekend pharmacy opening times). However,
at a trust level, the limited resolution of data means that
determining the clinical effectiveness of specific changes
in weekend service provision at an individual level is not
possible. In order to do this, further detailed interventional
studies need to be undertaken, looking at the effect of a
specific change in service on a specific group of patients.
Additionally, individual trusts not included in the ini-
tial HFMA costing analysis during the period of interest
may not have declared the presence of seven-day service
reorganisation accurately via their annual reports. It is
possible that some trusts may have demonstrated improved
outcomes through such reorganisation that was not for-
mally part of the “NHS Services, Seven Days a Week” pro-
ject, and the lack of reporting would have diluted any
comparative differences in institutional performance. How-
ever, it is far more likely that given the centrally-driven
push for better seven-day care, any significant changes that
could potentially lead to improvements in clinical outcome
would have been declared explicitly. The heterogeneity of
the various measures taken by individual trusts also means
that reorganisation was not uniform; however, one would
expect that such a global restructuring of services should at
least have resulted in measurable change in clinical out-
comes when examined across the entire English NHS. We
also recognise that service reorganisation takes time, and
that whilst our inclusion of the 2015–2016 analysis period
somewhat mitigates for the time lag in the implementation
of changes in health policy, further longitudinal analyses
should be performed over consecutive years to determine
their full effect.
In the pairwise difference in differences analysis of
clinical outcomes, we excluded 11 trusts that had under-
gone significant restructuring by merging with other trusts,
as it would have been difficult to determine if any changes
were likely to be due to seven-day service reorganisation or
the restructuring itself. However, we recognise that merging
of trusts may have occurred to improve access to better
seven-day services, and it is possible that clinical outcomes
in these trusts could have improved as a result of the
merge. We have also not examined other outcomes such as
patient satisfaction in this analysis, although a similar pilot
scheme to extend weekend GP services reported that
demand is significantly lower than expected [35].
Conclusions
Regardless of funding method, all healthcare resources
are finite and careful consideration needs to be given
with regards to how they are distributed throughout the
week. The NHS is predicted to be facing a £30 billion
funding gap over the next 5 years, [36] and it is esti-
mated that an additional £1.07–1.43 billion/ year is re-
quired to implement full seven-day emergency hospital
services [37] with a further >£1 billion/ year for seven-
day primary care [38]. A previous health economic
analysis has already suggested that moving to comprehen-
sive seven-day services does not fulfill National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) cost effectiveness
criteria, [37] even if such changes are assumed to lead to
improved clinical outcomes such as mortality rates. Whilst
our analysis suggests that this may not be the case, its
retrospective ecological design is not powered to test this
hypothesis definitively. It does however suggest that more
detailed prospective interventional studies such as cluster-
randomised trials at an institutional or departmental level
are still required to determine the aetiology of the “week-
end effect”, and governmental health policy and reorgani-
sation of health services aimed at mitigating this should
await more solid evidence before being effected.
