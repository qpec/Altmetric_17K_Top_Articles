IMPORTANCE Women with refractory urgency urinary incontinence are treated with sacral
neuromodulation and onabotulinumtoxinA with limited comparative information.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether onabotulinumtoxinA is superior to sacral neuromodulation in
controlling refractory episodes of urgency urinary incontinence.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter open-label randomized trial (February
2012-January 2015) at 9 US medical centers involving 381 women with refractory urgency
urinary incontinence.
INTERVENTIONS Cystoscopic intradetrusor injection of 200 U of onabotulinumtoxinA
(n = 192) or sacral neuromodulation (n = 189).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome, change from baseline mean number of
daily urgency urinary incontinence episodes over 6 months, was measured with monthly
3-day diaries. Secondary outcomes included change from baseline in urinary symptom scores
in the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Short Form (SF); range, 0-100, higher scores
indicating worse symptoms; Overactive Bladder Satisfaction questionnaire; range, 0-100;
includes 5 subscales, higher scores indicating better satisfaction; and adverse events.
RESULTS Of the 364 women (mean [SD] age, 63.0 [11.6] years) in the intention-to-treat
population, 190 women in the onabotulinumtoxinA group had a greater reduction in
6-month mean number of episodes of urgency incontinence per day than did the 174 in the
sacral neuromodulation group (−3.9 vs −3.3 episodes per day; mean difference, 0.63; 95% CI,
0.13 to 1.14; P = .01). Participants treated with onabotulinumtoxinA showed greater
improvement in the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire SF for symptom bother
(−46.7 vs −38.6; mean difference, 8.1; 95% CI, 3.0 to 13.3; P = .002); treatment satisfaction
(67.7 vs 59.8; mean difference, 7.8; 95% CI, 1.6 to 14.1; P = .01) and treatment endorsement
(78.1 vs 67.6; mean difference; 10.4, 95% CI, 4.3 to 16.5; P < .001) than treatment with sacral
neuromodulation. There were no differences in convenience (67.6 vs 70.2; mean difference,
−2.5; 95% CI, −8.1 to 3.0; P = .36), adverse effects (88.4 vs 85.1; mean difference, 3.3; 95% CI,
−1.9 to 8.5; P = .22), and treatment preference (92.% vs 89%; risk difference, −3%; 95% CI,
−16% to 10%; P = .49). Urinary tract infections were more frequent in the onabotulinum-
toxinA group (35% vs 11%; risk difference, −23%; 95% CI, −33% to −13%; P < .001). The need
for self-catheterization was 8% and 2% at 1 and 6 months in the onabotulinumtoxinA group.
Neuromodulation device revisions and removals occurred in 3%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women with refractory urgency urinary incontinence,
treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA compared with sacral neuromodulation resulted in a
small daily improvement in episodes that although statistically significant is of uncertain
clinical importance. In addition, it resulted in a higher risk of urinary tract infections and need
for transient self-catheterizations.

U
rgency urinary incontinence is a sudden need to void
resulting in uncontrollable urine loss. The preva-
lence of this disruptive condition is common and in-
creases with age, from 17% of women older than 45 years to
27% older than 75 years in the United States.1 The US eco-
nomicburdenwasprojectedtobe$82.6billionby2020.2When
primary and secondary interventions such as pelvic floor
muscle training, fluid restriction, and medication therapy do
not result in adequate symptom relief, women with refrac-
tory urgency urinary incontinence are offered sacral neuro-
modulation, posterior tibial nerve stimulation, or onabotu-
linumtoxinA. A recent systematic review of these therapies
found insufficient evidence to guide the choice between sacral
neuromodulation and onabotulinumtoxinA.1
The Refractory Overactive Bladder: Sacral Neuromodula-
tion vs Botulinum Toxin Assessment (ROSETTA) trial used a
comparative effectiveness design to assess whether onabotu-
linumtoxinA is superior to sacral neuromodulation in control-
ling episodes of urgency incontinence in women with refrac-
tory symptoms.
Methods
Study Design and Procedures
Recruitment for this open-label randomized trial was con-
ducted between February 2012 and January 2015 at 9 sites par-
ticipating in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)–
sponsored Pelvic Floor Disorders Network. Details of the study
designandmethodshavebeenpreviouslypublished.3Thepro-
tocol and statistical analysis plan are included in Supplement
1 and Supplement 2. The institutional review board of each
clinical site and the coordinating center approved the proto-
col. All participants provided written informed consent. Race/
ethnicity was ascertained by self-report, using fixed catego-
ries to describe the population per NIH guidelines. A data and
safety monitoring board reviewed the progress, interim re-
sults, and safety of the study. A senior statistician verified data
validity and adherence to the protocol.
Study eligibility required women to have refractory
urgency urinary incontinence, defined as persistent symp-
toms despite at least 1 supervised behavioral or physical
therapy intervention and the use of a minimum of 2 anticho-
linergics (or inability to tolerate or contraindications to the
medication). To be included, women needed a minimum of 6
urgency incontinence episodes on a baseline 3-day diary.
Exclusion criteria were relevant neurologic diseases, history
of using either of the study interventions, or a postvoid
residual of more than 150 mL (eTable 1 in Supplement 3). Par-
ticipants were stratified by age (<65 years vs ≥65 years) and
randomly assigned 1:1 in permuted blocks of size 2 or 4, with
all participants other than a single data coordinating center
statistician masked to block sequence either to undergo
sacral neuromodulation (InterStim, Medtronic) or to receive
200 U of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox A, Allergan). Surgeons
had to have performed at least 10 InterStim procedures, be
routinely performing the procedure in their practice, and
were required to review an instructional video demonstrat-
ing optimal techniques and detailing placement of the lead in
a standardized manner. Physicians administering onabotu-
linumtoxinA injections must have previously performed at
least 10 injections and were required to view an instructional
video detailing a standardized technique.
Participants randomized to sacral neuromodulation
underwent a first-stage lead placement in the operating suite
under local and monitored anesthesia care. Each electrode
was assessed intraoperatively for both sensory and motor
responses and criteria for the number of electrodes with
intraoperative response and level of voltage intensity was set
across sites. During the 7- to 14-day testing phase, partici-
pants were able to change programs to optimize treatment
effect. Those participants with 50% or more reduction in
mean episodes of urgency incontinence on a 3-day bladder
diary on the same program were a priori defined as clini-
cal responders and were eligible for the neurostimulator
implant. A reduction of more than 50% in episodes from
baseline is the threshold used in clinical practice to proceed
with neurostimulator implants based on US Food and Drug
Administration recommendations. Those without this
improvement underwent lead removal. Those found to have
a technical problem with the lead were allowed a second
attempt at lead placement.
Participants randomized to onabotulinumtoxinA re-
ceived a cystoscopic intradetrusor injection of 200 U per-
formed in clinic. Women with a reduction of 50% or more in
mean urgency incontinence episodes recorded in a 3-day blad-
der diary 1 month after injection were a priori defined as clini-
cal responders. After injection, participants were followed up
for urinary retention. Those with a postvoid residual of more
than 300 mL or more than 200 mL and symptoms of incom-
plete voiding were instructed to perform clean intermittent
catheterization after treatment.
Clinical responders were instructed not to receive addi-
tionalurgencyincontinencetreatment(eg,medications,physi-
cal therapy, additional onabotulinumtoxinA) for the first 6
months after the intervention. Participants with sacral neuro-
modulation were allowed neurostimulator reprogramming, if
required, at any time and 1 surgical revision prior to 6 months.
Key Points
Question Is onabotulinumtoxinA superior to sacral
neuromodulation in controlling symptoms of refractory urgency
urinary incontinence?
Findings In this comparative effectiveness trial that included 386
women, onabotulinumtoxinA had a greater mean daily urgency
urinary incontinence episode reduction over 6 months than did
the sacral neuromodulation group, −3.9 vs −3.3 episodes per day, a
statistically significant but small difference. Urinary tract infections
and need for self-catheterization were more frequent among
women receiving onabotulinumtoxinA.
Meaning Although onabotulinumtoxinA resulted in greater
reduction in episodes of urgency urinary incontinence, this is
limited by the small magnitude of the difference and greater
likelihood of some adverse events.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was change from baseline in mean
number of daily episodes of urgency incontinence averaged
over 6 months, as recorded for 3 consecutive days in monthly
bladder diaries. Comparative secondary outcomes included
change from baseline in bladder diary urinary frequency and
nocturia through 6 months. Quality of life and symptom
severity were assessed monthly with the Overactive Bladder
Questionnaire Short Form (SF)4 (range, 0-100, higher scores
indicate a better quality of life and higher scores on symptom
severity, greater symptom severity). A minimal clinically
important difference is considered a 10-point decrease from
baseline scores.5
Other quality-of-life instruments assessed at baseline
and 6 months included the Patient Global Impression of
Improvement6 (range, 1, very much better, to 7, very much
worse), improvement was defined as a rating of 1, 2, or 3. The
Overactive Bladder Satisfaction of Treatment questionnaire7
(range, 0-100, higher scores indicate better satisfaction)
included subcategories that measure treatment satisfaction,
adverse effects, treatment endorsement, and convenience.
Treatment preference was assessed as yes or no to the ques-
tion “Do you prefer the treatment that you received since
entering this study to the treatment you received before the
study?” To assess incontinence severity, we used the Sandvik
questionnaire,8 assessed on a scale of slight (1-2) to very
severe (10-12) using the standard scoring algorithm; the Uri-
nary Distress Inventory SF9 (range, 0-100; higher scores indi-
cate greater distress); and the Incontinence Impact Question-
naire SF9 (range, 0-100; higher scores indicate worse quality
of life). The Health Utility Index Mark-310 (0.00, death; 1.00,
perfect health) was measured at 6 months. Bowel and sexual

function outcomes will be reported later. Secondary descrip-
tive measures of safety and adverse events were collected
monthly, including the proportion of onabotulinumtoxinA
participants requiring catheterization, the proportion of
sacral neuromodulation participants requiring surgical revi-
sions due to surgical site infection or pain and lead migration,
and the proportion in each group with treated urinary tract
infections, either culture positive, due to symptoms, or both.
Exploratory End Points
Exploratory end points included complete resolution of ur-
gency incontinence as well as a 75% or greater and 50% or
greater reduction from baseline in urgency incontinence re-
corded for 3 consecutive days in monthly diaries.
Statistical Analysis
The modified intention-to-treat population for the primary
analysis included all eligible participants who provided at least
1 postbaseline bladder diary assessment. Planned compara-
tiveanddescriptivesecondaryanalyseswerebasedontheclini-
cal responders and per-protocol populations. The per-
protocol analysis included participants receiving complete
study therapy who, based on review masked to treatment
groupandoutcome,didnotsubstantiallydeviatefromthepro-
tocol in a manner that affected the study outcome or treat-
mentreceipt.Theplanned190participantspertreatmentgroup
provided at least 80% power to detect a mean between-
group absolute difference in the reduction from baseline of 2
or more urgency incontinence episodes per day, assuming a
common SD of 6.0 and 2-sided type I error rate of 5%, 10% loss
to follow-up, and 20% initial nonresponder rate for each treat-
ment group. For the primary analysis, missing monthly diary
data were assumed to be missing at random. Because almost
all participants had at least 4 diaries and the missing-data as-
sumptionconditionstherelationshipbetweenthemissingout-
comeandthereasonformissingnessontheobserveddata,this
assumption is plausible. The safety analyses were performed
on data from all randomized participants who initiated either
onabotulinumtoxinA or sacral neuromodulation treatment as
part of the study therapy.
Primary analyses used a linear mixed model with partici-
pant-month in the study (1 through 6) as the unit of analysis
and monthly change from baseline in mean urgency inconti-
nence episodes per day as the outcome, with terms for treat-
ment group, month, interaction of treatment group with
month, categorical covariates for age group (<65 years vs ≥65
years), and site consistent with randomization strata. Partici-
pants were treated as a random effect to account for within-
personcorrelationindiaryoutcomesovertime.Themodelgen-
erated adjusted estimates of change in the number of urgency
incontinence episodes from baseline by treatment group and
month and generated an F test of the hypothesis that the mean
change from baseline averaged across 6 months differed be-
tween treatment groups. To confirm that the missing-at-
random assumption adequately accounted for the missing di-
arydata,themodelwasrepeatedusingthemultipleimputation
approach described in the online appendix (Supplement 3).
Similar models, with modifications accounting for measure-
ment times, were used to evaluate treatment difference in con-
tinuous measures assessed over time.
Aggregate binary measures of efficacy and safety were
evaluated using contingency tables, with differences

between treatment groups assessed with the Mantel-
Haenszel tests accounting for randomization strata. Analyses
for binary outcomes with 0 events for either group used
Fisher exact tests. Continuous measures assessed at a single
follow-up time point were analyzed using analysis of covari-
ance models accounting for randomization strata. Ordinal
measures assessed only at 6 months were analyzed using
Mantel-Haenszel mean score tests using modified ridit
scores that control for randomization strata. The study was
designed to conduct formal analyses for only the primary
outcome at the .05 level of significance, and all other results
and P values were considered exploratory. Consequently, no
adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Analyses
were performed using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Insti-
tute Inc). All inferences and descriptive P values are based on
2-sided tests.
Results
Study Population and Assigned Treatment
Between February 2012 and June 2014, 480 women enrolled
in the study, of whom 386 underwent randomization and 364
were available for primary outcome analysis (Figure 1). Of the
189 eligible participants randomized to sacral neuromodula-
tion, 169 completed the first stage lead placement and 142 of
169 (84%) were categorized as clinical responders, of whom
139receivedthepermanentneurostimulator.Ofthe192women
randomized to onabotulinumtoxinA, 189 received a com-
plete dose during cystoscopic injection and 159 of 192 (83%)
were similarly categorized as clinical responders (eFigure in
theSupplement).Noclinicallymeaningfuldifferencesindemo-
graphic or clinical characteristics were identified between
groups (Table 1).
Approximately 10% of monthly follow-up diaries were
missing for the primary outcome; rates differed between
treatment groups (7% for the onabotulinumtoxinA group vs
13% for the sacral neuromodulation group) with missing dia-
ries from the 10 sacral neuromodulation participants who
withdrew from the study prior to treatment accounting for
the difference. Results of a sensitivity analysis based on mul-
tiple imputation of missing data were consistent with those
of the primary analysis.
Outcomes
In the intention-to-treat population, participants treated with
onabotulinumtoxinA had a greater 6-month mean reduction
of 3.9 episodes of urgency incontinence per day than did the
sacral neuromodulation group of 3.3 (mean difference, 0.63;
95%CI,0.13-1.14;P = .01)withpointestimatesshowinggreater
reductions for onabotulinumtoxinA at each month for 6
months (Figure 2).
Over 6 months, both groups improved on the Overactive
BladderSFsymptom-botherscore,withparticipantsintheona-
botulinumtoxinA group showing evidence of a greater im-
provement than the sacral neuromodulation group (−46.7 vs
−38.6; mean difference, 8.1; 95% CI, 3.0 to 13.3; P = .002). Par-
ticipants in the onabotulinumtoxinA group appeared to have
greater improvements in the Overactive Bladder Satisfaction
for treatment (mean difference, 7.8; 95% CI, 1.6 to 14.1; P = .01)
and endorsement (mean difference, 10.4; 95% CI, 4.3 to 16.5;
P < .001). However, there were no differences in convenience
(67.6 vs 70.2; mean difference, −2.5; 95% CI, −8.1 to 3.0;
P = .36),adverseeffects(88.4vs85.1;meandifference,3.3;95%
CI, −1.9 to 8.5; P = .22), and treatment preference (92% vs 89%;
risk difference, −3%; 95% CI, −16 to 10; P = .49). Other quality-
of-life measures showed no evidence of a difference between
groups (Table 2). Over 6 months, of those receiving study

The number of diaries for each treatment group and month included in the
model varies from 151 to 179 for the intention-to-treat population and 122 to 154
for the clinical responder population, but all values from all time points
contribute to the mean and interval estimates at each time point. A clinical
responder is defined as having 50% or more reduction in mean number of
episodes of urgency urinary incontinence on a 3-day bladder diary during
the 7- to 14-day testing phase for women randomized to receive sacral
neuromodulation and 1 month after injection for women randomized to receive
onabotulinumtoxinA.

a Values for any urinary incontinence, urgency urinary incontinence, nocturia,
voids are based on mean number of episodes per day on a 3-day diary captured
monthly and are generated from model-based estimates. The adjusted models
controlled for the stratification variables of age and clinical site.
bRepresents individuals who had this degree of improvement on all
their diaries.
c Values for the Overactive Bladder Satisfaction questionnaire range from 0-100
and includes 5 subscales; treatment satisfaction, side effects, treatment
endorsement, convenience, and patient preference, with higher scores
reflecting better satisfaction.
dTreatment preference is a binary outcome that is classified as yes if a
participant answers either “Slight preference for the treatment I am receiving
now” or “Definitely prefer the treatment I am receiving now” to the question:
“Do you prefer the treatment that you received since entering this study to the
treatment you received before the study?” from the Overactive Bladder
Questionnaire SF.
e The Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) is a patient reported
measure of perceived improvement with treatment on a scale of 1 (very much
better) to 7 (very much worse). Included here are participants who had
adequate improvement, defined as a rating of 1, 2 or 3 (better).
f The Sandvik scale has a range of 1-12, with higher scores representing worse
outcomes.
g The Urinary Distress Inventory short form (UDI-SF) scale has a range of 0-100,
with higher scores indicating greater distress.
h The Incontinence Impact Questionnaire short form (IIQ-SF) scale has a range
of 0-100, with higher scores representing a worse quality of life.
i The Health Utility Index, Version 3 (HUI 3) scale has a range of 0-1, with higher

treatment, 5 women in the onabotulinumtoxinA group and 14
in the sacral neuromodulation group received additional in-
continence medication.
Exploratory End Points
In the clinical responder population, participants treated with
onabotulinumtoxinA had a mean 4.4 reduction in 6-month
meanepisodesofurgencyincontinenceperdaycomparedwith
those in the sacral neuromodulation group, which had a mean
reduction of 3.7 (mean difference, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.17-1.20;
P = .01).
Of the participants who completed at least 4 monthly dia-
ries over 6 months, 20% in the onabotulinumtoxinA group and
4% in the sacral neuromodulation group had complete reso-
lution of urgency urinary incontinence (treatment differ-
ence, −16%; 95% CI, −26% to −5%; P < .001). Forty-six per-
cent in the onabotulinumtoxinA group and 26% in the sacral
neuromodulation group had at least a 75% reduction in the
number of episodes of urgency incontinence (treatment dif-
ference, −20%; 95% CI, −30% to −9%; P < .001) (Table 2). Ob-
served treatment effects were similar in the clinical re-
sponder and per-protocol populations (eTables 2 and 3 in
Supplement 3).
Adverse Events
In the sacral neuromodulation group, 6 women (3%) had their
device revised or removed during the 6-month period. In the
onabotulinumtoxinA group, 8% required intermittent self-
catheterizationat1month,4%at3months,and2%at6months
(Table 3). The median time of catheterization for any reason
was 37 days (range, 2-203). By 6 months, risk of urinary tract
infections appeared to be greater in the onabotulinumtoxinA
group than in the sacral neuromodulation group (35% vs 11%;
risk difference, −23%; 95% CI, −33% to −13%; P < .001). Thirty-
nine percent of the 66 onabotulinumtoxinA participants and
30% of the 20 sacral neuromodulation participants who had
a urinary tract infection during the 6-month period had mul-
tiple infections. However, multiple risk of urinary tract infec-
tions did not appear to differ between treatment groups.
Discussion
In this randomized study, over a 6-month assessment period,
a single injection of 200 U of onabotulinumtoxinA provided a
small but statistically significant greater reduction in epi-
sodes of urgency urinary incontinence than did sacral neuro-
modulation. Participants who received onabotulinumtoxinA
had greater improvements in the Overactive Bladder Ques-
tionnaire SF symptom bother, as well as the subscales for treat-
mentsatisfactionandendorsement.However,therewasnosig-
nificant difference for quality of life or for the subscales for
treatment preference, convenience, or adverse effects. More-
over, onabotulinumtoxinA increased the risk of urinary tract
infections and need for self-catheterizations. Overall, these
findings make it uncertain whether onabotulinumtoxinA pro-
vides a clinically important net benefit compared with sacral
neuromodulation.
A one-time injection of 200 U of onabotulinumtoxinA was
chosen in this severely affected population because pub-
lished reports support 6-month durability and because there
was wide variability in reported rates of clean intermittent self-
catheterization of 0% to 52%.11-15 Enrollment for our study be-
gan March 2012, and the study design strategy was further
strengthened in October 2012 with the publication of the only
other randomized clinical trial comparing onabotulinum-
toxinA with a second-line urgency urinary incontinence
therapyanticholinergicmedication.16Thatstudyevaluatedpa-
tients who were both drug naive and had received prior anti-
cholinergic medication. It found no difference in their pri-
mary outcome of mean change in episodes of urgency
incontinence over 6 months using a single injection of 100 U
of onabotulinumtoxinA compared with daily anticholinergic
medicationuse.Thus,increasingtheonabotulinumtoxinAdose
in a population of women refractory to second-line therapies
was logical.
Alowerrateofperformingintermittentcatheterizationwas
ascertained in this study than the 21.2% reported in the 200-U
group of the dose-finding study.12 This may be due to the dif-

ference in the threshold to require catheterization, ie, a re-
sidual volume after voiding of more than 200 mL irrespec-
tiveofsymptomsvsmorethan200mLwithvoidingsymptoms
or more than 300 mL without symptoms. Despite the higher
tolerance for postvoid residual urine volumes in our trial, the
onabotulinumtoxinA group had a lower urinary tract infec-
tion rate (35%) than the (48.1%) rate reported in the 200-U
group of the dose-finding study and a similar urinary tract in-
fection rate to those using 100 U (33%).16
The clinical responder rate of 84% during first-stage lead
placement for sacral neuromodulation was similar to
reported rates of 67% to 84%.17-19 Through 6 months, 51% of
the participants in the sacral neuromodulation group
reported 50% or more improvement in the number of epi-
sodes of urgency incontinence, and 4% had complete resolu-
tion of urgency incontinence. In these exploratory end
points, the rates are lower than the 67% to 87% (≥50%
improvement) and 39% to 56% complete continent rates at 6
months reported in the Cochrane review.20 However, the
studies were small with a wide range of outcome measures.
In the largest study,21 35% of the implanted group and 40% in
the delayed group had missing primary data outcome at 6
months. A recent randomized trial of sacral neuromodulation
vs standard medical therapy reported a 39% continence rate
in the sacral neuromodulation group vs 21% in the standard
medical therapy group (P = .06); however, the mean (SD)
baseline leaks per day (2.4 [1.7]) for the sacral neuromodula-
tion group in the study were lower than in our study (5.3
[2.7]), reflecting a less severe population.22 The 3% rate of
surgical revision or removal during this period was similar to
that of studies using the tined lead and smaller neurostimu-
lators, which was 3% to 11%.23
Our study suggests that the small but statistically signifi-
cant improved outcomes of onabotulinumtoxinA compared
with sacral modulation may be due to the increased dosage
of onabotulinumtoxinA used in the trial. Similar results
found in the analyses of the intention-to-treat and per-
protocol populations further validate the study’
s conclu-
sions. In addition, there was no participant study discontinu-
ation due to a differential in treatment tolerance. Enrollment
from multiple sites and standardized interventions by both
urogynecologists and urologists increases the generalizability
of the efficacy and safety findings. Although originally pow-
ered to detect a difference of 2 incontinence episodes per day
between modalities, the estimated standard deviation was
actually smaller than anticipated and a significant absolute
difference of 0.64 episodes per day was determined.
Although the difference resulted in an increased benefit in
patient reported symptom bother and satisfaction, the clini-
cal significance of this smaller difference in episodes is
unclear.
Because a single injection of 1 formulation of botulinum
toxin A was investigated, no conclusions can be reached on
other botulinum toxin preparations or the effect of multiple
injections of onabotulinumtoxinA compared with sacral neu-
romodulation therapy. Furthermore, this trial compared 2 ac-
tive treatments, preventing any determination of a placebo ef-
fect. However, the observed rates of cure and improvement in
episodes of urgency incontinence observed in the study for
boththerapiesexceedtheplaceboeffectobservedinotherran-
domized trials.12,14,21
Conclusions
Among women with refractory urgency urinary inconti-
nence, treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA compared with
sacral neuromodulation resulted in a small daily improve-
ment in episodes that although statistically significant is of un-
certain clinical importance. In addition, it resulted in a higher
risk of urinary tract infections and need for transient self-
catheterizations.
