Abstract
Camel milk and urine have been used as medicines in
certain parts of Asia and Africa since ancient times, but
only recently have scientists shown interest in exploring
the claimed therapeutic benefits of camel products. Sig-
nificant evidence, drawn from laboratory and limited
clinical studies, has shown that camel milk on its own and
occasionally mixed with camel urine is effective in the
management of diverse clinical conditions such as dia-
betes mellitus, cancer, food allergy, autism, viral hepatitis
and a host of other viral, bacterial and parasitic in-
fections. In addition, a number of potential benefits of
camel milk and urine on the cardiovascular system,
particularly their antiplatelet and fibrinolytic actions,
have been demonstrated. The current review presents a
concise summary of the scientific evidence to support
these therapeutic actions.

Introduction
The one-humped camel (Camelus dromedaries) is a unique
animal that survives and reproduces under severe climatic
conditions of heat and drought that do not suit the survival
of other species of domestic mammals. For desert dwellers in
Asia and Africa, the camel continues to be vital to daily life
as a source of food and a means of transportation, and just as

 importantly, its milk and urine have been used as medicines
for
diverse
ailments
since
ancient
times.1,2
However,
beginning in the early 1980s, more orthodox publications
began identifying specific diseases and medical conditions
that have been treated by camel milk or urine, including
cancer,3 chronic hepatitis,4 hepatitis C infection5,6 and
peptic ulcers.7 Even more recently, it has been reported
that camel milk has cured severe food allergies in children
who were unresponsive to conventional treatments8 and
diabetes mellitus.9 Furthermore, camel milk is endowed
with anti-malignant,10 antiplatelet11 and anti-thrombotic
properties12 in addition to a host of anti-bacterial and viral
properties,13,14 suggesting, among other things, the existence
of a very strong immune system, which was recently shown to
be equipped with unique light-chain-only antibodies.15
These claimed therapeutic actions have recently been the
subject of numerous studies, and there is now mounting
scientific information detailing the constituents of camel milk
and urine as well as their therapeutic components. These
revelations lend scientific evidence to support the current
practice of using these camel products for their therapeutic
benefits. The following review summarizes the current
knowledge in these areas.
Anti-diabetic action of camel milk
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by abnormally
high blood glucose levels, resulting from low insulin secretion
and/or
increased
insulin
resistance.16
DM
and
its
complications have become a main focus of interest for
researchers worldwide due to their close association with
the risk of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disorders,
which were noted in 68% of diabetes-related deaths among
patients aged 65 years or older.17,18 Today, the management
of DM remains a great challenge for treating physicians.
In addition to the conventional diabetic management
strategies of diet, insulin, oral hypoglycaemic drugs, and
exercise, diabetes has also received attention because of the
current wide interest in alternative therapies for chronic
incurable diseases. In this respect, there is mounting evidence
that camel milk (CM) consumption is effective in the control
of DM in both humans9,19e21 and experimental animals.22,23
Strong support for this notion comes from camel breeders in
India who consume CM regularly and who have zero
incidence
of
DM
compared
to
5.5
percent
in
other
communities in which CM is not consumed.20 Additional
support comes from the more recent finding that the
consumption of CM by type I diabetic patients resulted in
a 30e35% reduction in the daily insulin requirements, with
significant decreases in both blood glucose levels and
micro-albuminuria.9
These benefits can be related in part to the unique
composition of CM, which is rich in insulin, insulin-like
proteins,24 minerals, immunoglobulins25 and trace elements
with anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, CM pos-
sesses antioxidants and free radical scavengers.26,27 Further,
camel insulin possesses unique features that make it different
from human and other animal insulin and more effective
when orally administered. Camel insulin, unlike the insulin
contained within other animal and human milks, is contained
within micelles and is thus protected from digestion and
proteolysis in the upper gastrointestinal tract; it has also
been
proposed
that
camel
insulin
is
encapsulated
in
nanoparticles that facilitate its absorption and easy passing
to the blood stream.24 An added advantage of camel milk
consumption by diabetic patients was discovered in recent
renal functional and genetic studies in diabetic animals
showing that camel milk has renal protection actions that
prevent the renal damage associated with diabetes, as it
attenuates the biochemical and morphological features of
diabetic nephropathy in these diabetic animals.26 It is also
plausible that the antioxidant action of CM prevents the
manifestations
of
metabolic
syndrome,
including
hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia, and insulin resistance.
This,
in
turn,
would
inhibit
the
pathophysiological
processes underlying the microvascular complications of
DM, including retinopathy, nephropathy or cardiovascular
complications that heighten the mortality and morbidity of
the disease.9,21,28
The above findings lend strong support to the beneficial
effect of CM as a nutritional supplement and therapeutic
adjuvant in the management of DM. In addition to the
established hypoglycaemic benefit, CM treatment is expected
to achieve the nephrologists’ goal of renal protection.
Anti-cancer action of camel milk
The claimed anti-cancer action of camel products is
widely accepted by local healers who use of a mixture of
camel milk and urine in the treatment of patients suffering
from a variety of cancers, including breast, nasopharyngeal,
lung and others. This, in addition to the difficulties faced by
modern medicine in finding a lasting cure for cancer,
prompted the current flurry of studies attempting to find
evidence to support these claimed anti-cancer actions of
camel milk and urine and eventually succeed in identifying
the anti-malignant component in camel milk or urine that
could ultimately lead to the discovery of an effective anti-
cancer drug.
In a series of in vitro experiments, a research group led by
Dr Fatin Khorshid succeeded in demonstrating that lyoph-
ilized camel urine stopped the growth of tumour cells
implanted into experimental animals and the growth of
malignant cell lines including hepatocellular carcinoma
(HEPG2), colon carcinoma (HCT 116), human glioma
(U251) cells, lung cancer cells and leukaemic cells. She sug-
gested that this anti-cancer action could be both a direct cell
cytotoxicity and cutting blood supply to tumour cells, i.e.,
anti-angiogenic action.30e32 The latter action of camel urine
was recently confirmed by our group. In a series of recent
experiments we have demonstrated that both camel urine33
and milk,34 each on its own, inhibited inflammatory
angiogenesis in the murine sponge implant angiogenesis
model. Further support for the anti-cancer action of camel
urine comes from the observations of Alhaider et al.35 that
camel urine causes significant inhibition of the expression
of the gene encoding carcinogen-activating enzyme Cyp1a1
at the mRNA level in cancerous liver cells. Similar, apoptotic
anti-cancer action has also been demonstrated in camel
milk.36 To date, the exact nature of the anti-malignant con-
stituents in camel milk or urine have not been identified,

 functional protein lactoferrin (LF) is believed to be a possible
candidate.37
Interestingly, studies in patients with colorectal cancer
found that the administration of LF along with chemo-
therapy resulted in better prognosis than chemotherapy
alone38 and that LF inhibited the growth of adenomatous
colorectal polyps in human patients.39 In line with these
revelations, LF has also been shown to be directly
cytotoxic against cancer cells by inducing the inhibition of
the proliferation of cancer cells and their subsequent
programmed cells death (apoptosis).40 Detailed evidence
drawn from laboratory and clinical studies on the actions
of LF, which were reviewed recently,41 have confirmed
that the ingestion of LF resulted in the inhibition of
tumour growth and induced apoptosis and the metastasis
of tumour cells by both anti-angiogenic and cytotoxic ac-
tions. However, almost all of these studies were performed
using the commercially available bovine LF, with the
exception of a few in which camel LF was used.27 Therefore,
further research is needed to confirm these findings using
camel LF, which is reported to be more potent than
bovine LF.27
Finally, it is becoming clear that the local healers’ practice
of prescribing milk along with urine has a double advantage
as both products are endowed with anti-cancer actions;
additionally, the milk disguises the identity and taste of the
urine and makes its consumption palatable to the patient.
Chronic hepatitis and hepatitis C infection
The early observations of Sharmanov et al., in 19824 were
the first to suggest an anti-viral action of camel milk when
they found that camel’s milk was more effective than mare’s
milk
in
improving
and
normalizing
the
clinical
and
biochemical status of patients with chronic active hepatitis.
Later observations using camel urine therapy in patients with
Bilharzial liver disease supported this finding, as significant
improvement was noted in the clinical condition of these
patients with marked resolution of the ascites and morpho-
logical changes of the cirrhotic liver.42 Subsequent studies
have
shown
that
camel
lactoferrin
markedly
inhibits
hepatitis C virus genotype 4 infection of human peripheral
blood
leukocytes
and
that
the
incubation
of
human
leucocytes with camel LF followed by their infection with
HCV prevented the entry of the virus into the cells. The
conclusion was that the direct interaction between the
HCV and camel LF led to complete inhibition of virus
entry into the cells; in this respect camel lactoferrin proved
to be a more potent anti-viral agent than bovine and hu-
man lactoferrins.5 Additionally, camel milk administration
clears Schistosoma Mansoni from infected mice, thereby
indicating a further beneficial anti-parasitic action of camel
milk.43
Food allergies and other therapeutic benefits of camel milk
In addition to the diseases described above, numerous
small studies have reported diverse therapeutic benefits of
camel milk. For example, a group of children with severe
food (mainly milk) allergies who failed to respond to all
modern
therapies
recovered
fully
after
the
daily
administration of camel milk.8 This finding confirms further
the unique immune properties of camel milk, which are also
believed to be the basis for its efficacy in the treatment of
viral and bacterial infections.14 Relevant to the immune
properties of camel milk, camel whey protein was shown to
be effective in enhancing wound healing in the diabetic
mouse model by mobilizing a wide range of cellular
immune responses as well as cytokines.44,45
Camel milk supplementation was reported to cause sig-
nificant improvement in the clinical symptoms and investi-
gative
tests
of
patients
suffering
from
drug-resistant
tuberculosis.46 Similar therapeutic benefit was also shown
in
children
with
autism
(autism
spectral
disorders,
ASD).47e49 The consumption of CM by sufferers of autism
resulted in the disappearance of autism symptoms in some
cases
or
caused
significant
improvement
in
these
symptoms; patients became quieter and less destructive and
showed better emotional expression and communication.
Finally, recent studies from our laboratory have shown
that camel milk and urine possess potent cardiovascular
actions. In separate in vitro experiments, it was shown that
camel urine has potent platelet blocking properties similar to
the actions of the widely used anti-platelet drugs, aspirin and
clopidogrel.11 An earlier study50 has shown that lactoferrin
isolated
from
sheep
and
human
lactoferrin
inhibit
thrombin-induced aggregation; however, we could not
confirm this observation using human lactoferrin. Our
ongoing efforts are approaching the identification of the
probable dual-platelet inhibitor in camel urine.
Conversely, camel milk was also shown to have potential
thrombolytic action, as it causes marked reduction in plasma
fibrinogen
in
diabetic
rats.12
The
significance
of
this
observation, added to the observed antiplatelet action
mentioned above, provides strong support for the claimed
anti-cancer properties of camel milk and urine, as the inhi-
bition of coagulation and fibrin formation would hinder the
spread and growth of metastatic tumour cells. These and
other reported benefits of camel milk and urine were drawn
from small laboratory studies and should trigger engagement
in larger controlled trails in patients.
The possible therapeutic candidate(s) in camel milk
Judging by the currently accumulated scientific evidence,
there are two possible candidates: Lactoferrin and Camel
Immunogloloulins.
Lactoferrin
Camel milk is rich in lactoferrin with potent anti-
microbial and anti-inflammatory properties, including bac-
terial inhibition (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli,
Klebsiella pneumoniae, clostridium and Helicobacter pylori),
antiviral effects (HBC,CMV, herpes simplex virus-1, and hu-
man immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus responsible for
AIDS)), antifungal effects (Candida albicans), immuno-
supportive and immunomodulating functions (regulates the
maturation and activation of neutrophils and macrophages),
the maturation and function of lymphocytes (antioxidant
and anti-inflammatory) and anti-cancer actions.27,37

 Camel immunoglobulins
The medicinal properties of both camel milk and urine
could also be related to the gamma globulins and other im-
mune components, including immunoglobulins, present in
both products.25,51 For example, half of the circulating
antibodies in camel blood consist of only two heavy chains
and no light chains.15 Because of their reduced size, one-
tenth the size of human antibodies, these antibodies can
readily pass to the milk of the lactating camel, can pass the
blood brain barrier, can be filtered in urine, and are readily
absorbed from the gut into the general circulation of
consumers of camel milk and/or urine. In addition, the
single antigen-binding domains (VHH) of these heavy-
chain antibodiesdalso known as nanobodiesdmay have
applications in cancer diagnosis and therapy and biosensor
development.52 Recently, the unique features of the camel
immune system and its possible health benefits to humans
has been put into practical use by a Belgian biotechnology
company (Ablynx nv, Technologiepark, 219052, Ghent/
Zwijnaarde, Belgium) that is using animals of the camelid
family (camels and Llama) as the source of targeted
immune therapy for cancer and other autoimmune disease
such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease.
Additionally, it is important to add that reports of the
therapeutic benefits associated with bovine milk consumption
add credibility to the idea that camel milk would have similar
benefits. Bovine milk proteins are known to serve as pre-
cursors for numerous biologically active peptides encrypted
within major milk proteins, and these are activated by
gastrointestinal digestion or food processing.53 Bovine milk
peptides have also been shown to exhibit antimicrobial,
antioxidant,
antithrombotic,
antihypertensive,
and
immunomodulatory actions.54,55
As to the cardiovascular action of camel urine11,56
mentioned above, the identity of the dual human platelet
inhibitor
with
actions
similar
to
both
aspirin
and
clopidogrel
is
being
studied,
and
these
efforts
are
approaching their conclusion in our centre. Although this
platelet inhibitory activity was observed in camel urine,
earlier studies identified this activity in camel plasma,57,58
where it was thought to be a natural defence mechanism
against thrombotic disease, which camels are at risk to
develop due to excessive exposure to environmental heat
and drought.59
Finally, while knowledge about camels was traditionally
restricted to limited geographical areas, particularly Asia,
Africa and Australia, the use of camel’s milk as a nutrient
and for its health benefits was further confined to only
certain Asian and African countries. Cow’s milk, conversely,
has been consumed worldwide. However, as cross-cultural
migration of humans increased during the 20th century,
knowledge about camels and their milk started to reach
countries beyond Asia and Africa. This culminated in 2013
when the European Community licenced the importation of
camel milk from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The main
and perhaps only current supplier of camel milk is the Dubai-
based Emirates Industry for Camel Milk and Products
(EICMP), which manufactures its trademark camel milk,
Camelicious, which is now on sale in numerous European
countries, particularly The Netherlands, Denmark and
England. Another chocolate manufacturer, Al Nassma, is
selling its camel milk chocolate in London’s world-famous
upscale department store Harrods. This increased popu-
larity of camel milk among Europeans is likely due to the
prior knowledge of the unique nutritional value and possible
health benefits of camel milk compared to the more widely
consumed cow’s milk.
Conclusion
The long-standing practice of using camel milk and urine
for medicinal purposes in the Middle East, parts of Africa
and Asia, and the former Soviet Union was without scientific
rationale for centuries. However, based on the existing in-
formation about bovine milk as a functional food, camel
milk, in a similar way, could serve not only as a source of
nutrients but also as a source of bioactive agents with ther-
apeutic properties. The current scientific evidence for the
therapeutic actions of camel milk continues to unfold, and
efforts are underway to more precisely identify the thera-
peutic constituents. Thus, the camel is already proving to be
‘a goldmine’ for researchers.
