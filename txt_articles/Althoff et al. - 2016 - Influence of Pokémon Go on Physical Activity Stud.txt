ABSTRACT
Background:
Physical activity helps people maintain a healthy
weight and reduces the risk for several chronic diseases. Although
this knowledge is widely recognized, adults and children in many
countries around the world do not get recommended amounts of
physical activity. While many interventions are found to be ineffec-
tive at increasing physical activity or reaching inactive populations,
there have been anecdotal reports of increased physical activity due
to novel mobile games that embed game play in the physical world.
The most recent and salient example of such a game is Pokémon
Go, which has reportedly reached tens of millions of users in the
US and worldwide.
Objective:
Quantify the impact of Pokémon Go on physical ac-
tivity.
Methods:
We study the effect of Pokémon Go on physical ac-
tivity through a combination of signals from large-scale corpora of
wearable sensor data and search engine logs for 32 thousand users
over a period of three months. Pokémon Go players are identifi
ed
through search engine queries and activity is measured through ac-
celerometry.
Results:
We fi
nd that Pokémon Go leads to signifi
cant increases
in physical activity over a period of 30 days, with particularly en-
gaged users (i.e., those making multiple search queries for details
about game usage) increasing their activity by 1,473 steps a day on
average, a more than 25% increase compared to their prior activity
level (p < 10−15). In the short time span of the study, we esti-
mate that Pokémon Go has added a total of 144 billion steps to US
physical activity. Furthermore, Pokémon Go has been able to in-
crease physical activity across men and women of all ages, weight
status, and prior activity levels showing this form of game leads to
increases in physical activity with signifi
cant implications for pub-
lic health. In particular, we fi
nd that Pokémon Go is able to reach
low activity populations while all four leading mobile health apps
studied in this work largely draw from an already very active popu-
lation. While challenges remain in sustaining engagement of users
over the long-term, if Pokémon Go was able to sustain the engage-
ment of its current user base, the game could have a measurable

effect on life expectancy, adding an estimated 2.825 million years
of additional lifetime to its US users alone.
Conclusions Mobile apps combining game play with physical ac-
tivity lead to substantial activity increases, and in contrast to many
existing interventions and mobile health apps, have the potential to
reach activity-poor populations.

INTRODUCTION
Those who think they have not time for bodily exercise will
sooner or later have to fi
nd time for illness.
Edward Stanley, Earl of Derby, 20 December 1873
Physical activity is critical to human health. People who are
physically active tend to live longer, have lower risk for heart dis-
ease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, depression, and some cancers, and
are more likely to maintain a healthy weight (e.g., [20, 32, 46]).
Recent analyses estimate that physical inactivity contributes to 5.3
million deaths per year worldwide [16] and that it is responsible for
a worldwide economic burden of $67.5 billion through health-care
expenditure and productivity losses [5]. Only 21% of US adults
meet offi
cial physical activity guidelines [4, 22] (at least 150 min-
utes a week of physical activity for adults), and less than 30% of
US high school students get at least 60 minutes of physical activity
every day [4]. Efforts to stimulate physical activity hold oppor-
tunity for improving public health. Numerous studies have called
for population-wide approaches [26, 27]. However, many inter-
ventions have been found to be either ineffective [8, 28], to reach
only populations that were already active [7, 19], or not to be scal-
able across varying cultural, geographic, social, and economic con-
texts [26].
Recently, there have been anecdotal reports of novel mobile games
leading to increased physical activity, most notably for Pokémon
Go1 [2] (other examples include Ingress2 and Zombies, Run!3).
Pokémon Go is a mobile game combining the Pokémon world through
augmented reality with the real world requiring players to physi-
cally move around. Pokémon Go was released in the US on July
6, 2016 and was adopted widely around the world (25 million ac-
tive users in the US [1] and 40 million worldwide [47]; 500 million
downloads worldwide [18]). Due to this massive penetration, Poké-
mon Go can be viewed as intervention for physical activity on a
societal-scale. However, its effectiveness for stimulating additional
walking has yet to be determined.

 Present Work. We study the influence of Pokémon Go on physical
activity through a combination of wearable sensor data and search
engine query logs for 31,793 users over a period of three months.
Within these users, we identify 1,420 Pokémon Go users based on
their search activity and measure the effect of playing the game on
their physical activity (see Section 2). We further compare changes
in physical activity for Pokémon Go users to changes for large con-
trol group of US wearable users and to other leading mobile health
apps. Lastly, we estimate the impact of Pokémon Go on public
health.
In summary, our main research questions are:
1. Is playing Pokémon Go associated with increases in physi-
cal activity? How large is this effect and how long does it
persist?
2. Is this effect restricted to particular subpopulations or is it
effecting people of all prior activity levels, ages, gender, and
weight status?
3. How does Pokémon Go compare to leading mobile health
apps in terms of its ability to change physical activity?
4. How has Pokémon Go impacted physical activity in the United
States and what is its potential impact on public if the game
was able to sustain the engagement of its users?
Our study provides guidance on societal-scale interventions rep-
resented by the Pokémon Go phenomenon and on the possibilities
for increasing physical activity that could be achieved with addi-
tional engagement. We see this study on Pokémon Go as a step
towards effectively leveraging games for public health purposes.
Mobile games might not be appealing to everyone and therefore
should be seen as a complement rather than a replacement for the
interventions considered in the rich body of work on physical ac-
tivity interventions (e.g., [8, 19, 26, 27, 28, 32]). To the best of
our knowledge, this is the fi
rst study to combine large-scale wear-
able and search sensors to retrospectively evaluate physical activity
interventions and the fi
rst to study the effect of Pokémon Go.

METHODS
We leverage and combine data from search engine queries with
physical activity measurements from wearable devices. Specifi
-
cally, we jointly analyze (1) queries to the Bing search engine men-
tioning “pokemon”. We use this to identify which users are likely
playing Pokémon Go (see Section 2.1); and (2) physical activity
as measured through daily number of steps on the Microsoft Band
(see Section 2.2). We jointly use this data to measure differences in
physical activity before and after each user shows strong evidence
of starting to play Pokémon Go.
The main study population is 31,793 US users of Microsoft prod-
ucts who have agreed to link data from their Microsoft Band wear-
ables and their online activities to understand product usage and im-
prove Microsoft products. In Section 2.1, we show that 1,420 users
can be classifi
ed as Pokémon Go players with high confi
dence. We
compare changes in physical activity in this population to changes
in a control group consisting of a random sample of 50,000 US Mi-
crosoft Band users. For all users, we have self-reported age, gender,
height and weight, which we will use in Section 3.3 to estimate the
effect of Pokémon Go on different groups of users. Section 2.1 de-
tails how we identify Pokémon Go users via strong evidence from
search logs and Section 2.2 explains the accelerometer-based phys-
ical activity data. Section 2.3 gives details on study population de-
mographics and Section 2.4 explains how we measure the impact
of Pokémon Go on physical activity.

2.1
Identifying Pokémon Go Users Through
Search Queries
We collected all queries of the 31,793 users between July 6, 2016
(US release date of Pokémon Go) and August 23, 2016 (date of sta-
tistical analysis) that mention the term “pokemon” (ignoring cap-
italization). We then manually annotated the 454 most frequent
unique queries in terms of whether they are experiential [23, 45];
that is, the user is very likely playing Pokémon Go, rather than just
being interested in it for some other reason such as following up
on news reports or general interest in the game. This was done by
an author familiar with the game manually executing each query
and judging whether the query and search engine results provided
compelling evidence of someone playing the game. Examples for
experiential and non-experiential queries are given in Table 1.
Among the 25,446 users who issued any queries during our time
of observation, 1,420 or 5.6% issued an experiential query for Poké-
mon Go. This number very closely matches the estimated fraction
of regular Pokemon users in the US (5.9% according to [25]) sug-
gesting that our search-engine based method is effectively detect-
ing a large number of Pokémon Go users. We use the time of each
user’s fi
rst experiential query for Pokémon Go as a proxy for the
time when they started playing Pokémon Go and denote this time
as t0.
Note that our method of identifying Pokémon Go players through
experiential queries can potentially overestimate t0 if players per-
form these queries several days after starting to play the game, but
the opposite is less likely due to the nature of experiential queries
targeting specifi
c aspects of game play (see Table 1). However, note
that any potential overestimates of t0 lead to more conservative es-
timates of the effect of Pokémon Go since potential game-related
increases in activity would be counted as activity before t0 (assum-
ing the effect is non-negative).
2.2
Measuring Physical Activity
We seek to measure the change in physical activity before and
after the time of the fi
rst experiential query for Pokémon Go, t0,
when a user presumably started playing the game (see Section 3).
We measure physical activity through daily steps as recorded by the
3 axis accelerometer/gyrometer of the Microsoft Band. Accelero-
meter-defi
ned activity measures are preferred over subjective survey-
based methods, that have been found to overestimate physical ac-
tivity by up to 700% [37]. We use steps data from 30 days before
the fi
rst experiential query (t0) until 30 days after the fi
rst experi-
ential query. We note that, at the time of this study, very few users
had been using Pokémon Go for more than 30 days. Further note
that all Pokémon Go users included in our dataset have been using

the wearable device for a signifi
cant amount of time (median 433
days) such that differences in activity cannot be due to starting to
use the wearable device. Since not every search engine user who we
identifi
ed as a Pokémon Go player is also regularly tracking steps,
there are 792 users that tracked steps on at least one day before and
after t0 (see Table 2). Note that the choice of this threshold pa-
rameter does not signifi
cantly impact our analysis as we fi
nd very
similar results when restricting our analysis to users tracking for
example seven days before and after t0. We concentrate our anal-
ysis on this set of users and compare their activity to the control
group described below.
Control Group. We further compare the differences in activity
in the Pokémon Go user population to any changes in the control
group, a random sample of US Microsoft wearable users. For ex-
ample, summertime along with improved weather conditions and
potential vacation time might be linked to increases in the steps of
the control group as well. Since there are no experiential queries
for any of the control users, we need to defi
ne a suitable substi-
tute for t0 for the control group in order to compare both groups.
We will use this reference point t0 to measure changes in physical
activity before and after for both the Pokémon Go user group as
well as control users. For the Pokémon Go users, t0 corresponds to
the date of the fi
rst experiential query for Pokémon Go (e.g., July 6,
2016, or July 7, 2016, etc.). One could consider using a single point
in time t0 for all control users, for example the July 6, 2016 release
date of Pokémon Go. However, this choice would temporarily align
all control users such that weekend, weather, or other effects could
lead to confounding. In the Pokémon Go user group, all users have
potentially different t0 based on their fi
rst experiential query and
therefore such effects are not aligned. In order, to match observa-

Daily steps
Figure 1: Time series of daily steps for two sample users. Both
cases show signifi
cant increases in daily steps after the fi
rst ex-
periential query for Pokémon Go (t0). While before t0 both
users take less than 5,000 steps a day, after t0 they regularly
reach around 15,000 steps a day.
tion periods between both groups, we therefore use the exact same
distribution of t0 for control users; that is, for each control user, we
randomly sample a Pokémon Go user and use the same value for
t0 for the control user. This ensures that we will compare physical
activity over matching observation periods.
Wear Time. Furthermore, we also measure the wear time of the
activity tracking device for each day in the dataset. Differences in
recorded number of steps could potentially stem from simply an
increase in wear time rather than an actual increase of physical ac-
tivity. However, we fi
nd that during the study duration the wear
time for both Pokémon Go and control users was effectively con-
stant with the ratio between the groups changing by less than one
percent. Therefore, we attribute any differences in recorded num-
ber of steps to an actual increase in physical activity due to the
engagement with Pokémon Go.
Example Time Series of Physical Activity. Figure 1 displays the
daily number of steps before and after the user’s fi
rst experiential
query for two example users. Both users signifi
cantly increase their
activity after their fi
rst experiential query for Pokémon Go by sev-
eral thousand steps each day. In Section 3, we analyze whether
this large increase in physical activity is representative of the study
population and how it varies across individuals.
2.3
Study Population Demographics
Demographic statistics on identifi
ed Pokémon Go users and con-
trol users are displayed in Table 3. We fi
nd that Pokémon Go users
are younger than the average user in our wearable dataset, and
much less often female. Furthermore, there is a signifi
cant fraction
of overweight and obese users, similar to the proportion expected
in the US population [21]. This fraction of overweight and obese
 users is very similar in the Pokémon Go and control user groups in-
dicating lack of a selection effect based on weight status. The aver-
age activity level of Pokémon Go users is below that of the control
group indicating that that Pokémon Go is attracting users that get
less than average activity. Note that this difference is unlikely to
stem from other differences between the two groups since younger
users are typically more active than older users and males typically
get more physical activity than females [38] (i.e., we would expect
a larger number of steps for the Pokémon Go group given the other
differences).
2.4
Measuring the Impact of Pokémon Go
This section details the methods used to measure the impact of
Pokémon Go on physical activity.
2.4.1
Longitudinal Analysis
We compare the physical activity levels of Pokémon Go users
to those of the control group population over time in relation to
every user’s fi
rst experiential query (t0). Note that we use randomly
sampled t0 for users in the control group (see Section 2.2).
We measure the average number of steps over a period of 30
days before the fi
rst experiential query until 30 days after the fi
rst
experiential query. Note that on some days a user might not have
recorded any steps and we ignore this user on that day. We measure
this average activity separately for the Pokémon Go user group and
the control group. To improve graph readability, we smooth the
daily average activity through Gaussian-weighted averaging with a
window size of seven days, but we report statistical tests on the raw
data. We estimate 95% confi
dence intervals through a bootstrap
with 500 resamples [11].
2.4.2
Dose-Response Relationship between Pokémon
Go and Physical Activity
Dose-response relationships between the amount of physical ac-
tivity and various health outcomes have been well established [9,
17]. We expect that high engagement with Pokémon Go would be
reflected in a larger number of experiential queries. Particularly en-
gaged users might also exhibit larger increases in physical activity.
We quantify the exact effect sizes for these increases and study this
potential dose-response relationship between the Pokémon Go re-
lated engagement on a search engine and real-world physical activ-
ity. We measure the difference in the average number of daily steps
across all users and days for the 30 days before versus 30 days after
each user’s fi
rst experiential query as the effect size.
2.4.3
Does Everyone Benefi
t?
We measure the effect on individual users’ physical activity af-
ter starting to play Pokémon Go and relate the magnitude of this
effect to demographic attributes of the user including age, gender,
weight status (body mass index; BMI), and prior activity level. We
investigate whether only certain user groups are benefi
ting from
the game or whether the potential health benefi
ts might apply more
widely to the game’s user population. We estimate the effect of
playing Pokémon Go on each individual user defi
ned as the differ-
ence in the average number of daily steps 30 days before and 30
days after the fi
rst experiential query. We include only Pokémon
Go users with at least seven days of steps tracking before and after
this event to reduce noise and apply the same requirement to the
control group. These constraints result in 677 Pokémon Go users
and 26,334 control users.
2.4.4
Comparison to Existing Health Apps
We compare the effect of Pokémon Go to the effect of other mo-
bile health apps. The Microsoft Band can be connected to other
fi
tness and health applications and we have data on when these
connections fi
rst happen (i.e., explicit knowledge of t0 for users
of these apps). We study four leading mobile health applications
with anonymized names for legal reasons. These apps regularly are
rated among the top health apps on both iOS and Android platforms
and represent the state-of-the-art in consumer health applications.
Again, we measure the number of daily steps 30 days before a user
starts using one of these apps until 30 days after. We only include
users that started using the health applications after July 1, 2016 to
control for seasonal effects and make the data comparable with our
Pokémon Go user group. We only include users that were tracking
steps on at least 7 days before and after the fi
rst experiential query
(for Pokémon Go group) or fi
rst connecting the health app (for the
comparison groups). For the four apps, 1,155 users are included for
app A, 313 for app B, 625 for app C, and 296 users for app D. Note
that these users had been using the wearable device for a signifi
cant
amount of time before connecting to the health app (median time in
days for the four apps are 87, 57, 103, and 76 days, respectively).
Therefore, any differences in average activity are likely due to the
connected health app rather than cumulative effects of starting to
use a wearable activity tracker.
2.4.5
Estimating the Public Health Impact of Poké-
mon Go
In order to quantify the effect of Pokémon Go on public health,
we estimate (1) how many steps were added to US users’ physical
activity during the fi
rst 30 days, (2) how many users met physical
activity guidelines before and after Pokémon Go, and (3) the po-
tential impact on life expectancy if Pokémon Go could sustain the
engagement of its users.
The offi
cial physical activity guidelines [4, 22] are equivalent to
approximately 8,000 daily steps [39, 40]. Only 21% of US adults
meet these guidelines. We use all users tracking steps at least seven
days before and after their fi
rst experiential query for Pokémon Go.
We then measure the fraction of users with more than 8,000 average
daily steps both 30 days before and after the fi
rst experiential query.
This analysis is repeated for Pokémon Go users with at least one
and at least ten experiential queries, and the control group.
If there is a substantial impact on physical activity, Pokémon
Go could have a measurable impact on US life expectancy due to
well-established health benefi
ts of physical activity on heart dis-
ease, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, depression, some cancers, obesity,
and mortality risk [5, 16, 20, 32, 46]. If we assume that Pokémon
Go users would be able to sustain an activity increase of 1,000 daily
steps, this would be associated with a 6% lower mortality risk. Us-
ing life-table analysis similar to [16] based on mortality risk esti-
mates from [10] and the United States 2013 Period Life Table [41]
we estimate the impact on life expectancy based on this reduction
of mortality risk.

We now present results on the influence of Pokémon Go usage
on physical activity. We study longitudinal physical activity data in
Section 3.1. We quantify the dose-response relationship between
interest in Pokémon Go and physical activity in Section 3.2. Next,
we examine potentially heterogeneous treatment effects by exam-
ining various subgroups based on several demographic attributes
in Section 3.3.

tion 3.4. Lastly, we quantify the impact of Pokémon Go on public
health in Section 3.5.
3.1
Longitudinal Analysis
Starting to play Pokémon Go is associated with signifi
cant in-
creases in physical activity. Changes in average activity level over
time are illustrated in Figure 2. The top plot shows activity for
Pokémon Go users with at least one experiential query and the bot-
tom plot shows activity for Pokémon Go users with at least ten
experiential queries (i.e., users who expressed signifi
cant interest
in details of Pokémon Go commands and operation).
We observe a signifi
cant increase in physical activity after the
fi
rst experiential query for Pokémon Go users compared to the con-
trol group. The control group slightly decreased their activity by 50
daily steps on average (p < 10−20; we use Mann–Whitney U-Tests
for hypothesis tests unless noted otherwise). In contrast, Pokémon
Go users increased their activity by 192 daily steps (p < 10−7).The
plot shows a steep increase on the day of the fi
rst experiential query
(t0) suggesting that the observed increased activity indeed stems
from engaging with Pokémon Go. We fi
nd that Pokémon Go users
initially have less activity than the average Microsoft Band user
in the US (dashed blue line; 178 daily steps less; p < 10−20).
However, following the start of Pokémon Go play, their activity in-
creases to a level larger than the control group (65 daily steps more;
p < 10−20).
The bottom row in Figure 2 shows similar but much larger effects
for Pokémon Go users with at least ten experiential queries; that is,
users who showed signifi
cant interest in Pokémon Go. These users
are initially signifi
cantly less active than the average Microsoft Band
user in the US, getting 5,756 daily steps compared to 6,435 daily
steps in the control group (p < 10−20). After they start playing
Pokémon Go they exhibit a large increase in activity to an aver-
age of 7,229 daily steps (1,473 daily steps difference; p < 10−15),
which now is about 13% larger than the control population (p <
10−20). This observation suggests that there is a dose-response re-
lationship between interest in Pokémon Go and the effect on phys-
ical activity, which we analyze in detail in Section 3.2.
We note that increases in steps before t0 could stem from starts
with the game in advance of queries about Pokémon Go, as we are
using the fi
rst experiential query as a proxy for the start of play.
If users begin to play without ever issuing a search query about
Pokémon Go, we could see increases in activity before t0. How-
ever, since we observe steep increases in activity exactly at t0, this
suggests that the proxy for starting is valid for most users.
Note that physical activity for both Pokémon Go user groups (top
and bottom row) decreases again after about three to four weeks
after the fi
rst experiential query. However, also note that the activ-
ity for the more strongly engaged group (bottom) drops down to a
higher level than they started out with. This suggests that there
could be a longer-term behavior change and that future work is
needed to study long-term effects of Pokémon Go.
3.2
Dose-Response Relationship between Poké-
mon Go and Physical Activity
We fi
nd that users that are more engaged with Pokémon Go ex-
hibit larger increases in physical activity (see Figure 3). For users
that expressed any interest in Pokémon Go we fi
nd signifi
cant in-
creases in activity compared to the control group which decreases
their activity by 50 steps a day. Further, we fi
nd that these in-
creases in steps scale roughly linearly with the number of expe-
riential queries from 192 daily steps increase (3%) for users with
one or more experiential queries up to an increase of 1473 daily
steps (26%) for users with ten or more experiential queries.
Furthermore, the linear increase in physical activity with the
number of experiential Pokémon Go queries strongly suggests that
activity increases observed in users querying a search engine for
Pokémon Go are causally explained by their engagement with Poké-
mon Go. If there were other confounding factors that explained
the difference in activity between our Pokémon Go group and the
control group over time and those changes had nothing to do with
Pokémon Go, then one would not expect to fi
nd such a clear dose-
response relationship as given in Figure 3.

Does Everyone Benefi
t?
Since this analysis is on user level, we only consider users who
track their activity at least seven days before and after t0. Over-
all, the Pokémon Go users increased their activity by 194 daily
steps (p < 0.01; Wilcoxon Signed-Rank-Test). Over the same
time period, the control users decreased their activity by 104 steps
(p < 10−20; Wilcoxon Signed-Rank-Test). Figure 4 illustrates the

Figure 4: Effect sizes of physical activity increase or decrease by user demographics, including prior physical activity level (top left),
age (top right), body mass index (BMI; bottom left), and gender (bottom right). In all cases, we fi
nd that Pokémon Go users (red)
exhibit larger changes then their respective control group (blue; see Section 3.3). These results suggest that physical activity increases
due to Pokémon Go are not restricted to particular subgroups of users but widely spread across the overall study population.
effect size split by previous activity level (top left), age (top right),
body mass index (BMI; bottom left) and gender (bottom right).
We fi
nd that Pokémon Go has increased physical activity across
men and women of all ages, weight status, and prior activity levels.
In particular, we fi
nd that both Pokémon Go users and control users
who are very inactive exhibit large activity increases and users who
are relatively active even exhibit a decrease in activity on average.
However, we fi
nd that Pokémon Go users exhibit larger effects than
the control across all levels of prior activity (all p < 0.025). We
fi
nd the largest differences between the two groups for users that
previously were sedentary (i.e., below 5,000 daily steps [38]). Fur-
thermore, Pokémon Go users exhibit bigger increases in activity
than control users across all age groups (all p < 0.040; except 10-
20 year old group which was small) though we fi
nd largest effects
for younger users between 10 and 30 years. We also fi
nd that the
positive effect on physical activity does not vary much across all
BMI groups, which is encouraging since obese individuals (30 <
BMI ≤ 40) are typically less active than healthy subjects [6]. The
activity differences in the Pokémon Go groups were always larger
than the differences in the control group across all BMI groups (all
p < 0.021). Lastly, we fi
nd that activity differences in the Poké-
mon Go groups were larger than the differences in the control group
for both men and women (all p < 0.022). Increases for women
were not signifi
cantly different from increases for men (p = 0.110;
note small sample size for women).
In summary, we fi
nd that Pokémon Go increased activity all
across the studied population, largely independent of prior activ-
ity level, age, weight status, or gender. These results are encour-
aging since they suggest that any positive effects due to Pokémon
Go are available even to sedentary, obese, and older users. Effec-
tively reaching these users with physical activity interventions is
critical for public health [2].
3.4
Comparison to Existing Health Apps
Pokémon Go leads to larger increases in physical activity than
other mobile health apps and further attracts more users who are
not yet very active. The average daily steps over time is visualized
in Figure 5 (using same smoothing method as before). First, we
observe that users of all four health apps are signifi
cantly more ac-
tive than the average wearable user (6,514 daily steps) even before
starting to use the health app (6,997-7,616 daily steps; see activity
before t0 in Figure 5 for apps A,B,C,D). Pokémon Go users were
less active than the average user (5,901-6,265 daily steps). This
demonstrates that Pokémon Go app is attracting a different group
of users which is less active and therefore would see larger health
benefi
ts from improving their activity [4, 22]. The temporal pat-
tern for the health apps do not contribute strong evidence that these
apps are leading to signifi
cant behavior change. One exception is
app A with its users signifi
cantly increasing their activity at day 0.
However, this increase in activity is lower compared to the effect
of Pokémon Go. Users of app A increased their activity on average
by 111 daily steps or 1.6%. Compare this to 194-1502 daily steps
or 3.1-25.5% for Pokémon Go users with at least one or ten ex-
periential queries, respectively. In particular, users demonstrating
large engagement with Pokémon Go exhibit much larger increases
in activity than users of any other app in our comparison.
These results emphasize the special contribution that activity-
encouraging games could have on physical activity and public health.
These games attract a wide range of people including those with
low prior physical activity. We have demonstrated throughout this
paper that such games can lead to signifi
cant activity increases.

pressed interest in Pokémon Go and physical activity suggests
that these users are in fact playing Pokémon Go and that play-

active than the average wearable user (Control) before starting
to play but see larger increases in physical activity compared to
the four consumer health apps.
Effect on US Physical Activity. On average, users with an expe-
riential query for Pokémon Go increased their physical activity by
192 steps a day for the next 30 days (see Section 3.2). Extrapolat-
ing this average effect size to 25 million Pokémon Go users in the
US [1], we fi
nd that Pokémon Go added 144 billion steps within the
fi
rst 30 days to US physical activity. This is equivalent to walking
around the equator 2,724 times or 143 round trips to the moon.
Effect on Meeting Activity Guidelines. Using all users track-
ing steps at least seven days before and after their fi
rst experiential
query for Pokémon Go, we fi
nd that that the fraction of users meet-
ing physical activity guidelines (i.e., getting 8,000 average daily
steps [39, 40]) stays approximately constant for users with one or
more experiential queries (22.0% before vs. 21.9% after t0) and
control users (24.1% before vs. 23.5%). However, for highly en-
gaged Pokémon Go users with at least ten experiential queries, we
fi
nd that during the 30 days after they start playing 160% more
users achieve 8,000 average daily steps (12.2% before vs. 31.7%
after; relative increase of 160%).
For comparison, 21% of US
adults meet these guidelines [4, 22].
Effect on Life Expectancy. We found that more engaged users
exhibited average physical activity increases of up to 1,473 daily
steps (see Section 3.2). This substantial impact on exercise across
the society could have a measurable impact on US life expectancy
due to well-established health benefi
ts of physical activity [5, 16,
20, 32, 46]. If we assume that Pokémon Go users, between 15 and
49 years old, would be able to sustain an activity increase of 1,000
daily steps, this would be associated with 41.4 days of additional
life expectancy. Across the 25 million US Pokémon Go users [1],
this would translate to 2.825 million years additional life added to
US users.
4.
DISCUSSION
The Pokémon Go phenomenon has reached millions of people
overnight and dominated news media for weeks after its release [1,
25, 47]. Health professionals have pointed out potential benefi
ts in-
cluding increased physical activity, spending more time outside and
exploring the neighborhood and city, social interactions, and mas-
tering game challenges but have also raised concerns such as injury,
abduction, trespassing, violence, and cost [2, 29]. In this study, we
have precisely quantifi
ed the impact of Pokémon Go on physical
activity and studied the effect on different groups of individuals.
4.1
Principal Results
We fi
nd that playing the game signifi
cantly increased physical
activity on the group-level (see Section 3.1 and Section 3.2) as well
as the individual-level (see Section 3.3) over an observation period
of approximately four weeks. The more interest the users showed in
Pokémon Go (measured through intensity of search queries seek-
ing details about game usage), the larger the increase of physical
activity (see Section 3.2). For example, users that issued ten Poké-
mon Go queries on details of the game within the two months after
release of the game, increased their activity by 1479 steps a day
or 26%. These increases are not restricted to already active and
healthy individuals but also reach individuals with low prior activ-
ity levels and overweight or obese individuals. Comparing Poké-
mon Go to existing mobile health apps, we fi
nd further evidence
that Pokémon Go is able to reach low activity populations while
mobile health and fi
tness apps largely draw from an already active
population (see Section 3.4). This highlights the promise of game-
based interventions versus traditional approaches, which have often
been ineffective for these groups of people [7, 19].
Given its great popularity, Pokémon Go has signifi
cantly im-
pacted US physical activity and added an estimated 144 billion
steps to US physical activity which is about 2,724 times around
the world or 143 round trips to the moon.
Furthemore, highly
engaged users were almost three times as likely to meet offi
cial
activity guidelines in the 30 days after starting to play Pokémon
Go compared to before. If this user engagement could be sustained,
 Pokémon Go would have the potential to measurably affect US life
expectancy.
Our study shows the large potential impact that activity-encour-
aging games could have on society. However, we have also high-
lighted challenges in realizing this potential.
Most importantly,
games would need to be able to sustain long-term engagement and
lead to sustained behavior change. Furthermore, these games might
not be appealing to everyone (e.g., we observed males to be more
likely to play the games than females), and clearly these games
should not replace but complement existing physical activity pro-
grams (e.g., [8, 19, 26, 27, 28, 32]). Understanding how to design
games and how to bring together games and health interventions
will be important to public health in the future. As a fi
rst step, our
study helps to provide guidance on what could come of continuous
engagement and with additional engagement.
4.2
Limitations
Out study is not without limitations. First, the study population
is not a random sample of US population. Subjects were able to
afford a wearable device for activity tracking and willing to share
their data for research purposes. Further, we use individuals search
queries as a proxy for playing Pokémon Go and consider the num-
ber of queries as indicating the degree of engagement. However,
we fi
nd strong evidence that the proxies for usage and engagement
are effective. The method identifi
es a fraction of users that is very
similar to to independent estimates of Pokémon Go penetration in
the US (see Section 2.1) and we fi
nd a strong dose-response rela-
tionship between the number of Pokémon Go queries and increased
physical activity (see Section 3.2). Lastly, our follow-up period is
currently restricted to 30 days. Future work is needed to study the
long-term effectiveness of games such as Pokémon Go to increase
physical activity.
4.3
Comparison with Prior Work
The link between physical activity and improved health outcomes
has been well-established (e.g., [5, 16, 20, 32, 46]). At the same
time, only a small fraction of people in developed countries meet
offi
cial physical activity guidelines [4, 22]. Consumer wearable
devices for activity tracking are becoming more prevalent in the
general population. The devices can enable us to better understand
real-world physical activity and how to best support and encourage
healthier behaviors [13, 30].
Few research studies to date have harnessed data obtained from
consumer wearables to study influences of the devices on physi-
cal activity. However, a number of medical studies have examined
accelerometer-defi
ned activity (e.g., [36, 38]), rather than relying
on self-report measures. Studies have found that use of pedome-
ters and activity trackers for self-monitoring can help increase ac-
tivity [35, 43] but other studies have reported mixed results [42].
Beyond enabling self-monitoring, encouraging additional activity
through reminders lead to increased activity only for the fi
rst week
after the intervention and did not lead to any signifi
cant changes
after six weeks in a randomized controlled trial [42].
To encourage healthy behavior change, researchers have stud-
ied the design of “exergames” [12, 31, 33], video games combined
with exercise activity, and location-based games where game play
progresses through a player’s location [3]. However, no such game
has been nearly as popular and widely used as Pokémon Go. Such
games have yet to be integrated into physical activity programs,
even though one US college recently announced a physical educa-
tion class based on Pokémon Go [14].
There is a growing body of work on using large-scale search
query logs to identify subjects with particular conditions for re-
search studies, including such efforts as detecting adverse reactions
to medications and identifying signals that could help with screen-
ing for cancer [23, 44, 45]. Other work has studied activity-related
posts on social media to better understand the sharing of health be-
haviors [15, 24, 34] but has not yet connected such data to ground-
truth health behaviors or focused on interventions on a large scale.
To the best of our knowledge, this is fi
rst study of the link be-
tween the usage of Pokémon Go or similar games on physical ac-
tivity and health. Also, this is the fi
rst effort to combine data from
wearable devices with information drawn from search engine queries.
4.4
Conclusions
Novel mobile games which require players to physically move in
the real world appear to be an effective complement to traditional
physical activity interventions and they are able to reach millions
of engaged users. We studied the effect of Pokémon Go on phys-
ical activity through a combination of large-scale wearable sensor
data with search engine logs, and showed that the game leads to
signifi
cant increases in physical activity over a period of 30 days,
with particularly engaged users increasing their average activity by
1,473 steps a day or 26%. Based on our fi
ndings, we estimate that
the game has already added an estimated 144 billion steps to US
physical activity. If engagement with Pokémon Go could be sus-
tained over the lifetime of its many users, we estimate that the game
would add an estimated 2.825 million years of additional lifetime
to its US users. We see great promise for public health in design-
ing geocentric games like Pokémon Go and in working to sustain
users’ engagement with them.
