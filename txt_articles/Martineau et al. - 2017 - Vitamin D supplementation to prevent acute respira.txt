ABSTRACT
Objectives
To assess the overall effect of vitamin D 
supplementation on risk of acute respiratory tract 
infection, and to identify factors modifying this effect.
Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis of individual 
participant data (IPD) from randomised controlled 
trials.
Data sOurces
Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and 
the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials 
Number registry from inception to December 2015.
eligibility criteria fOr stuDy selectiOn
Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trials of 
supplementation with vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 of any 
duration were eligible for inclusion if they had been 
approved by a research ethics committee and if data 
on incidence of acute respiratory tract infection were 
collected prospectively and prespecified as an efficacy 
outcome.
results
25 eligible randomised controlled trials (total 11 321 
participants, aged 0 to 95 years) were identified. IPD 
were obtained for 10 933 (96.6%) participants. Vitamin 
D supplementation reduced the risk of acute 
respiratory tract infection among all participants 
(adjusted odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 
0.81 to 0.96; P for heterogeneity <0.001). In subgroup 
analysis, protective effects were seen in those 
receiving daily or weekly vitamin D without additional 
bolus doses (adjusted odds ratio 0.81, 0.72 to 0.91) 
but not in those receiving one or more bolus doses 
(adjusted odds ratio 0.97, 0.86 to 1.10; P for 
interaction=0.05). Among those receiving daily or 
weekly vitamin D, protective effects were stronger in 
those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <25 
nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.30, 0.17 to 0.53) than in 
those with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels ≥25 
nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.75, 0.60 to 0.95; P for 
interaction=0.006). Vitamin D did not influence the 
proportion of participants experiencing at least one 
serious adverse event (adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 0.80 
to 1.20, P=0.83). The body of evidence contributing to 
these analyses was assessed as being of high quality.
cOnclusiOns
Vitamin D supplementation was safe and it protected 
against acute respiratory tract infection overall. 
Patients who were very vitamin D deficient and those 
not receiving bolus doses experienced the most 
benefit.

Introduction
Acute respiratory tract infections are a major cause of 
global morbidity and mortality and are responsible for 
10% of ambulatory and emergency department visits in 
the USA1  and an estimated 2.65 million deaths world-
wide in 2013.2  Observational studies report consistent 
independent associations between low serum concen-
trations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (the major circulating 
vitamin D metabolite) and susceptibility to acute respi-
ratory tract infection.3 
4  25-hydroxyvitamin D supports 
induction of antimicrobial peptides in response to both 
viral and bacterial stimuli,5-7  suggesting a potential 
mechanism by which vitamin D inducible protection 
against respiratory pathogens might be mediated. Vita-
min D metabolites have also been reported to induce 
other innate antimicrobial effector mechanisms, 
including induction of autophagy and synthesis of 
reactive nitrogen intermediates and reactive oxygen 
intermediates.8  These epidemiological and in vitro data

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of 
acute respiratory tract infection have yielded conflicting results
Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis has the potential to identify factors 
that may explain this heterogeneity, but this has not previously been performed
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Meta-analysis of IPD from 10 933 participants in 25 randomised controlled trials 
showed an overall protective effect of vitamin D supplementation against acute 
respiratory tract infection (number needed to treat (NNT)=33)
Benefit was greater in those receiving daily or weekly vitamin D without additional 
bolus doses (NNT=20), and the protective effects against acute respiratory tract 
infection in this group were strongest in those with profound vitamin D deficiency at 
baseline (NNT=4)
These findings support the introduction of public health measures such as food 
fortification to improve vitamin D status, particularly in settings where profound 
vitamin D deficiency is common

have prompted numerous randomised controlled trials 
to determine whether vitamin D supplementation can 
decrease the risk of acute respiratory tract infection. A 
total of five aggregate data meta-analyses incorporating 
data from up to 15 primary trials have been conducted 
to date, of which two report statistically significant pro-
tective effects9 
10  and three report no statistically signif-
icant effects.11-13  All but one of these aggregate data 
meta-analyses11 reported statistically significant hetero-
geneity of effect between primary trials.
This heterogeneity might have arisen as a result of 
variation in participant characteristics and dosing regi-
mens between trials, either of which may modify the 
effects of vitamin D supplementation on immunity to 
respiratory pathogens.14  People with chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease who have lower baseline vita-
min D status have been reported to derive greater 
clinical benefit from supplementation than those with 
higher baseline status,15 
16  and participant characteris-
tics such as age and body mass index have been 
reported to modify the 25-hydroxyvitamin D response to 
vitamin D supplementation.17 18  Treatment with large 
boluses of vitamin D has been associated with reduced 
efficacy for non-classic effects,9  and in some cases an 
increased risk of adverse outcomes.19  While study level 
factors are amenable to exploration through aggregate 
data meta-analysis of published data, potential effect 
modifiers operating at an individual level, such as base-
line vitamin D status, can only be explored using indi-
vidual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. This is 
because subgroups are not consistently disaggregated 
in trial reports, and adjustments for potential con-
founders cannot be applied similarly across trials.20 To 
identify factors that might explain the observed hetero-
geneity of results from randomised controlled trials, we 
undertook an IPD meta-analysis based on all 25 ran-
domised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation 
for prevention of acute respiratory tract infection that 
were completed up to the end of December 2015.
Methods
Protocol and registration
The methods were prespecified in a protocol that was reg-
istered with the PROSPERO International Prospective 
Register of Systematic Reviews (www.crd.york.ac.uk/
PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42014013953). 
Approval by a research ethics committee to conduct this 
meta-analysis was not required in the UK; local ethical 
permission to contribute deidentified IPD from primary 
trials was required and obtained for studies by Camargo 
et al21  (the ethics review committee of the Mongolian Min-
istry of Health), Murdoch et al22  (Southern Health and 
Disability Ethics Committee, reference URB/09/10/050/
AM02), Rees et al23  (Committee for the Protection of 
Human Subjects, Dartmouth College, USA; protocol No 
24381), Tachimoto et al24  (ethics committee of the Jikei 
University School of Medicine, reference 26-333: 7839), 
Tran et al25  (QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute 
human research ethics committee, P1570), and Urashima 
et al26 
27 (ethics committee of the Jikei University School of 
Medicine, reference 26-333: 7839).
Patient and public involvement
Two patient and public involvement representatives 
were involved in development of the research questions 
and the choice of outcome measures specified in the 
study protocol. They were not involved in patient 
recruitment, since this is a meta-analysis of completed 
studies. Data relating to the burden of the intervention 
on participants’ quality of life and health were not 
meta-analysed. Where possible, results of this system-
atic review and meta-analysis will be disseminated to 
individual participants through the principal investiga-
tors of each trial.
eligibility criteria
Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trials of 
supplementation with vitamin D3 or vitamin D2 of any 
duration were eligible for inclusion if they had been 
approved by a research ethics committee and if data on 
incidence of acute respiratory tract infection were col-
lected prospectively and prespecified as an efficacy out-
come. The last requirement was imposed to minimise 
misclassification bias (prospectively designed instru-
ments to capture acute respiratory tract infection events 
were deemed more likely to be sensitive and specific for 
this outcome). We excluded studies reporting results of 
long term follow-up of primary randomised controlled 
trials.
study identification and selection
Two investigators (ARM and DAJ) searched Medline, 
Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, 
and the International Standard Randomized Con-
trolled Trials Number (ISRCTN) registry using the 
electronic search strategies described in the supple-
mentary material. Searches were regularly updated 
up to, and including, 31 December 2015. No language 
restrictions were imposed. These searches were sup-
plemented by searches of review articles and refer-
ence lists of trial publications. Collaborators were 
asked if they knew of any additional trials. Two inves-
tigators (ARM and CAC) determined which trials met 
the eligibility criteria.
Data collection processes
IPD were requested from the principal investigator for 
each eligible trial, and the terms of collaboration were 
specified in a data transfer agreement, signed by repre-
sentatives of the data provider and the recipient (Queen 
Mary University of London). Data were deidentified at 
source before transfer by email. On receipt, three inves-
tigators (DAJ, RLH, and LG) assessed data integrity by 
performing internal consistency checks and by attempt-
ing to replicate results of the analysis for incidence of 
acute respiratory tract infection where this was pub-
lished in the trial report. Study authors were contacted 
to provide missing data and to resolve queries arising 
from these integrity checks. Once queries had been 
resolved, clean data were uploaded to the main study 
database, which was held in STATA IC v12 (College 
 
Station, TX).

Data relating to study characteristics were extracted 
for the following variables: setting, eligibility criteria, 
details of intervention and control regimens, study 
duration, and case definitions for acute respiratory 
tract infection. IPD were extracted for the following 
variables, where available: baseline data were 
requested for age, sex, cluster identifier (cluster ran-
domised trials only), racial or ethnic origin, influenza 
vaccination status, history of asthma, history of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, body weight, 
height (adults and children able to stand) or length 
(infants), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration, 
study allocation (vitamin D versus placebo), and 
details of any stratification or minimisation variables. 
Follow-up data were requested for total number of 
acute respiratory tract infections (upper or lower), 
upper respiratory tract infections, and lower respira-
tory tract infections experienced during the trial; time 
from first dose of study drug to first acute respiratory 
tract infection (upper or lower), upper respiratory tract 
infection, or lower respiratory tract infection if applica-
ble; total number of courses of antibiotics taken for 
acute respiratory tract infection during the trial; total 
number of days off work or school due to symptoms of 
acute respiratory tract infection during the trial; serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration at final follow-up; 
duration of follow-up; number and nature of serious 
adverse events; number of potential adverse reactions 
(incident hypercalcaemia or renal stones); and partici-
pant status at end of the trial (completed, withdrew, 
lost to follow-up, died).
risk of bias assessment for individual studies
We used the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool28 to 
assess sequence generation; allocation concealment; 
blinding of participants, staff, and outcome assessors; 
completeness of outcome data; and evidence of selective 
outcome reporting and other potential threats to valid-
ity. Two investigators (ARM and DAJ) independently 
assessed study quality, except for the three trials by Mar-
tineau and colleagues, which were assessed by CAC. 
Discrepancies were resolved by consensus.
Definition of outcomes
The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was inci-
dence of acute respiratory tract infection, incorporating 
events classified as upper respiratory tract infection, 
lower respiratory tract infection, and acute respiratory 
tract infection of unclassified location (ie, infection of 
the upper respiratory tract or lower respiratory tract, or 
both). Secondary outcomes were incidence of upper 
and lower respiratory tract infections, analysed sepa-
rately; incidence of emergency department attendance 
or hospital admission, or both for acute respiratory 
tract infection; use of antimicrobials for treatment of 
acute respiratory tract infection; absence from work or 
school due to acute respiratory tract infection; inci-
dence and nature of serious adverse events; incidence 
of potential adverse reactions to vitamin D (hypercal-
caemia or renal stones); and mortality (acute respira-
tory tract infection related and all cause).
synthesis methods
LG and RLH analysed the data. Our IPD meta-analysis 
approach followed published guidelines.20  Initially we 
reanalysed all studies separately; the original authors 
were asked to confirm the accuracy of this reanalysis 
where it had been performed previously, and any dis-
crepancies were resolved. Then we performed both one 
step and two step IPD meta-analysis for each outcome 
separately using a random effects model adjusted for 
age, sex, and study duration to obtain the pooled inter-
vention effect with a 95% confidence interval. We did 
not adjust for other covariates because missing values 
for some participants would have led to their exclusion 
from statistical analyses. In the one step approach, we 
modelled IPD from all studies simultaneously while 
accounting for the clustering of participants within 
studies. In the two step approach we first analysed IPD 
for each separate study independently to produce an 
estimate of the treatment effect for that study; we then 
synthesised these data in a second step.20 For the one 
step IPD meta-analysis we assessed heterogeneity by 
calculation of the standard deviation of random effects; 
for the two step IPD meta-analysis we summarised het-
erogeneity using the I2 statistic. We calculated the num-
ber needed to treat to prevent one person from having 
any acute respiratory tract infection (NNT) using the 
Visual Rx NNT calculator (www.nntonline.net/visu-
alrx/), where meta-analysis of dichotomous outcomes 
revealed a statistically significant beneficial effect of 
allocation to vitamin D compared with placebo.
exploration of variation in effects
To explore the causes of heterogeneity and identify fac-
tors modifying the effects of vitamin D supplementation, 
we performed prespecified subgroup analyses by extend-
ing the one step meta-analysis framework to include 
treatment-covariate interaction terms. Subgroups were 
defined according to baseline vitamin D status (serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D <25 v ≥25 nmol/L), vitamin D dosing 
regimen (daily or weekly without bolus dosing versus a 
regimen including at least one bolus dose of at least 
30 000 IU vitamin D), dose size (daily equivalent <800 
IU, 800-1999 IU, ≥2000 IU), age (≤1 year, 1.1-15.9 years, 
16-65 years, >65 years), body mass index (<25 v ≥25), and 
presence compared with absence of asthma, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, and previous influenza 
vaccination. To ensure that reported subgroup effects 
were independent, we adjusted interaction analyses for 
potential confounders (age, sex, and study duration). 
The 25 nmol/L cut-off for baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
concentration in subgroup analyses was selected on the 
grounds that it is the threshold for vitamin D deficiency 
defined by the UK Department of Health,29  and the level 
below which participants in clinical trials have experi-
enced the most consistent benefits of supplementation.30 
 
We also performed an exploratory analysis investigating 
effects in subgroups defined using the 50 nmol/L and 75 
nmol/L cut-offs for baseline circulating 25-hydroxyvita-
min D concentration, because observational studies have 
reported that less profound states of vitamin D deficiency 
may also associate independently with an increased risk

of acute respiratory tract infection.31 
32 To minimise the 
chance of type 1 error arising from multiple analyses, we 
inferred statistical significance for subgroup analyses 
only where P values for treatment-covariate interaction 
terms were <0.05.
Quality assessment across studies
For the primary analysis we investigated the likelihood 
of publication bias through the construction of a con-
tour enhanced funnel plot.33  We used the five GRADE 
considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, 
imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias)34 to 
assess the quality of the body of evidence contributing 
to analyses of the primary efficacy outcome and major 
safety outcome of our meta-analysis (see supplemen-
tary table S3).
additional analyses
We conducted sensitivity analyses excluding IPD from 
trials where acute respiratory tract infection was a sec-
ondary outcome (as opposed to a primary or co-primary 
outcome), and where risk of bias was assessed as being 
unclear. We also conducted a responder analysis in par-
ticipants randomised to the intervention arm of 
included studies for whom end study data on 
25-hydroxyvitamin D were available, comparing risk of 
acute respiratory tract infection in those who attained a 
serum level of 75 nmol/L or more compared with those 
who did not.
Results
study selection and iPD obtained
Our search identified 532 unique studies that were 
assessed for eligibility; of these, 25 studies with a total 
of 11 321 randomised participants fulfilled the eligibility 
criteria (fig 1). IPD were sought and obtained for all 25 
studies. Outcome data for the primary analysis of pro-
portion of participants experiencing at least one acute 
respiratory tract infection were obtained for 10 933 
(96.6%) of the randomised participants.
study and participant characteristics
Table 1 presents the characteristics of eligible studies 
and their participants. Trials were conducted in 14 
countries on four continents and enrolled participants 
of both sexes from birth to 95 years of age. Baseline 
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were deter-
mined in 19/25 trials: mean baseline concentration 
ranged from 18.9 to 88.9 nmol/L. Baseline characteris-
tics of participants randomised to intervention and con-
trol were similar (see supplementary table S1). All 
studies administered oral vitamin D3 to participants in 
the intervention arm: this was given as bolus doses 
every month to every three months in seven studies, 
weekly doses in three studies, a daily dose in 12 studies, 
and a combination of bolus and daily doses in three 
studies. Study duration ranged from seven weeks to 1.5 
years. Incidence of acute respiratory tract infection was 
the primary or co-primary outcome for 14 studies and a 
secondary outcome for 11 studies.
IPD integrity was confirmed by replication of primary 
analyses in published papers where applicable. The 
process of checking IPD identified three typographical 
errors in published reports. For the 2012 trial by 
Manaseki-Holland et al,35  the correct number of repeat 
episodes of chest radiography confirmed pneumonia 
was 134, rather than 138 as reported. For the trial by 
Dubnov-Raz et al,36  the number of patients randomised 
to the intervention arm was 27, rather than 28 as 
reported. For the trial by Laaksi et al,37 the proportion of 
men randomised to placebo who did not experience any 
acute respiratory tract infection was 30/84, rather than 
30/80 as reported.
risk of bias within studies
Supplementary table S2 provides details of the risk of 
bias assessment. All but two trials were assessed as 
being at low risk of bias for all aspects assessed. Two 
trials were assessed as being at unclear risk of bias 
owing to high rates of loss to follow-up. In the trial by 
Dubnov-Raz et al,36  52% of participants did not com-
plete all symptom questionnaires. In the trial by Laaksi 
et al,37 37% of randomised participants were lost to fol-
low-up.

Overall results
Table 2  presents the results of the one step IPD 
meta-analysis testing the effects of vitamin D on the 
proportion of all participants experiencing at least one 
acute respiratory tract infection, adjusting for age, sex, 
and study duration. Vitamin D supplementation 
resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the 
proportion of participants experiencing at least one 
acute respiratory tract infection (adjusted odds ratio 
0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.96, P=0.003; P 
for heterogeneity <0.001; NNT=33, 95% confidence

significant protective effects of vitamin D were also seen 
for one step analyses of acute respiratory tract infection 
rate (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.96, 95% confidence 
interval 0.92 to 0.997, P=0.04; P for heterogeneity 
<0.001; 10 703 participants in 25 studies) but not for 
analysis of time to first acute respiratory tract infection 
(adjusted hazard ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval 
0.89 to 1.01, P=0.09; P for heterogeneity <0.001; 9108 
participants in 18 studies). Two step analyses also 
showed consistent effects for the proportion of partici-
pants experiencing at least one acute respiratory tract 
infection (adjusted odds ratio 0.80, 0.69 to 0.93, 
P=0.004; P for heterogeneity 0.001; 10 899 participants 
in 24 studies; fig 2), acute respiratory tract infection rate 
(adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.91, 0.84 to 0.98, 
P=0.018; P for heterogeneity <0.001; 10 703 participants 
in 25 studies), and time to first acute respiratory tract 
infection (adjusted hazard ratio 0.92, 0.85 to 1.00, 
P=0.051; P for heterogeneity 0.14; 9108 participants in 
18 studies). This evidence was assessed as being of high 
quality (see supplementary table S3).
Subgroup analyses
To explore reasons for heterogeneity, we conducted 
subgroup analyses to investigate whether effects of 
vitamin D supplementation on risk of acute respiratory 
tract infection differed according to baseline vitamin D 
status, dosing frequency, dose size, age, body mass 
index, the presence or absence of comorbidity (asthma 
or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and influ-
enza vaccination status. Race or ethnicity was not 
investigated as a potential effect modifier, as data for 
this variable were missing for 3680/10 933 (34%) partic-
ipants and power for subgroup analyses was limited by 
small numbers in many racial or ethnic subgroups that 
could not be meaningfully combined. Table 2 presents 
the results. Subgroup analysis revealed a strong protec-
tive effect of vitamin D supplementation among those 
with baseline circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels 
less than 25 nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.58, 0.40 
to 0.82, NNT=8, 5 to 21; 538 participants in 14 stud-
ies; within subgroup P=0.002; see Cates plot, 
 
supplementary figure S1) and no statistically signifi-
cant effect among those with baseline levels of 25 or 
more nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 0.77 to 1.04; 
3634 participants in 19 studies; within subgroup 
P=0.15; P for interaction 0.01). This evidence was 
assessed as being of high quality (see supplementary 
table S3). An exploratory analysis testing the effects of 
vitamin D supplementation in those with baseline 
25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in the ranges 
25-49.9 nmol/L, 50-74.9 nmol/L, and 75 or more nmol/L

did not reveal evidence of a statistically significant 
interaction (see supplementary table S4).
Meta-analysis of data from trials in which vitamin D 
was administered using a daily or weekly regimen with-
out additional bolus doses revealed a protective effect 
against acute respiratory tract infection (adjusted odds 
ratio 0.81, 0.72 to 0.91, NNT=20, 13 to 43; 5133 partici-
pants in 15 studies; within subgroup P<0.001; see Cates 
plot, supplementary figure S1). No such protective effect 
was seen among participants in trials where at least one 
bolus dose of vitamin D was administered (adjusted 
odds ratio 0.97
, 0.86 to 1.10; 5800 participants in 10 
studies; within subgroup P=0.67; P for interaction 0.05). 
This evidence was assessed as being of high quality (see 
supplementary table S3). P values for interaction were 
more than 0.05 for all other potential effect modifiers 
investigated. For both of these subgroup analyses, 
broadly consistent effects were observed for event rate 
analysis (see supplementary table S5) and survival 
analysis (see supplementary table S6).
Having identified two potential factors that modified 
the influence of vitamin D supplementation on risk of 
acute respiratory tract infection (ie, baseline vitamin D 
status and dosing frequency), we then proceeded to 
investigate whether these factors were acting as 
 
independent effect modifiers, or whether they were 
 
confounded by each other or by another potential effect 
modifier, such as age. Dot plots revealed a trend towards 
lower median baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D con-
centration and higher median age for studies employing 
bolus compared with daily or weekly dosing (see supple-
mentary figures S2 and S3). To establish which of these 
potential effect modifiers was acting independently, we 
repeated the analysis to include treatment-covariate 
interaction terms for baseline vitamin D status, dosing 
frequency, and age. In this model, interaction terms for 
baseline vitamin D status and dosing frequency were 
statistically significant (P=0.01 and P=0.004, respec-
tively), but the interaction term for age was not (P=0.20), 
consistent with the hypothesis that baseline vitamin D 
status and dosing frequency, but not age, independently 
modified the effect of vitamin D supplementation on risk 
of acute respiratory tract infection.
We then proceeded to stratify the subgroup analysis 
presented in table 2  according to dosing frequency, to 
provide a “cleaner” look at the results of subgroup 
analyses under the assumption that use of bolus doses 
was ineffective. Table 3 presents the results: these 
reveal that daily or weekly vitamin D treatment was 
associated with an even greater degree of protection 
against acute respiratory tract infection among partic-
ipants with baseline circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D

ified analysis (adjusted odds ratio 0.30, 0.17 to 0.53; 
NNT=4, 3 to 7; 234 participants in six studies; within 
subgroup P<0.001; see Cates plot, supplementary fig-
ure S4). Moreover, use of daily or weekly vitamin D also 
 
protected against acute respiratory tract infection 
among participants with higher baseline 25-hydroxyvi-
tamin D concentrations (adjusted odds ratio 0.75, 0.60 
to 0.95; NNT=15, 9 to 86; 1603 participants in six stud-
ies; within subgroup P=0.02; see Cates plot, supple-
mentary figure S4). The P value for interaction for this 
subgroup analysis was 0.006, indicating that protec-
tive effects of daily or weekly vitamin D supplementa-
tion were statistically significantly greater in the 
subgroup of participants with profound vitamin D defi-
ciency. No other statistically significant interaction was 
seen; notably, bolus dose vitamin D supplementation 
did not offer any protection against acute respiratory 
tract infection even when administered to those with 
circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less 
than 25 nmol/L (adjusted odds ratio 0.82, 0.51 to 1.33; 
304 participants in eight studies; within subgroup 
P=0.43).
secondary outcomes
Efficacy
Table 4  presents the results of the one step IPD 
meta-analysis of secondary outcomes. When all studies 
were analysed together, no statistically significant 
effect of vitamin D was seen on the proportion of partic-
ipants with at least one upper respiratory tract infec-
tion, lower respiratory tract infection, hospital 
admission or emergency department attendance for 
acute respiratory tract infection, course of antimicrobi-
als for acute respiratory tract infection, or absence from 
work or school due to acute respiratory tract infection. 
However, when this analysis was stratified by dosing 
frequency, a borderline statistically significant protec-
tive effect of daily or weekly vitamin D supplementation 
against upper respiratory tract infection was seen 
(adjusted odds ratio 0.88, 0.78 to 1.00; 4483 participants 
in 11 studies, P=0.05; table 5).
Safety
Use of vitamin D did not influence risk of serious 
adverse events of any cause (adjusted odds ratio 0.98, 
0.80 to 1.20; 11 224 participants in 25 studies) or death 
due to any cause (1.39, 0.85 to 2.27; 11 224 participants in 
25 studies) (table 4 ). Instances of potential adverse 
reactions to vitamin D were rare. Hypercalcaemia was 
detected in 21/3850 (0.5%) and renal stones were diag-
nosed in 6/3841 (0.2%); both events were evenly repre-
sented between intervention and control arms (table 4 ). 
Stratification of this analysis by dosing frequency did 
not reveal any statistically significant increase in risk of 
adverse events with either bolus dosing or daily or 
weekly supplementation (table 5).
risk of bias across studies
A funnel plot for the proportion of participants experi-
encing at least one acute respiratory tract infection 
showed a degree of asymmetry, raising the possibility 
that small trials showing adverse effects of vitamin D 
might not have been included in the meta-analysis (see 
supplementary figure S5).
responder analyses
Supplementary table S7 presents the results of 
responder analyses. Among participants randomised to 
the intervention arm of included studies for whom end 
study data on 25-hydroxyvitamin D were available, no 
difference in risk of acute respiratory tract infection was 
observed between those who attained a serum concen-
tration of 75 or more nmol/L compared with those who 
did not.
sensitivity analyses
IPD meta-analysis of the proportion of participants 
experiencing at least one acute respiratory tract infec-
tion, excluding two trials assessed as being at unclear 
risk of bias,36 
37 revealed protective effects of vitamin D 
supplementation consistent with the main analysis 
(adjusted odds ratio 0.82, 0.70 to 0.95, 10 744 partici-
pants, P=0.01). Sensitivity analysis for the same out-
come, restricted to the 14 trials that investigated acute

discussion
In this individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis 
of randomised controlled trials, vitamin D supplemen-
tation reduced the risk of experiencing at least one 
acute respiratory tract infection. Subgroup analysis 
revealed that daily or weekly vitamin D supplementa-
tion without additional bolus doses protected against 
acute respiratory tract infection, whereas regimens con-
taining large bolus doses did not. Among those receiv-
ing daily or weekly vitamin D, protective effects were 
strongest in those with profound vitamin D deficiency 
at baseline, although those with higher baseline 
25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations also experienced 
benefit. This evidence was assessed as being of high 
quality, using the GRADE criteria.34 Since baseline vita-
min D status and use of bolus doses varied considerably 
between studies, our results suggest that the high 
degree of heterogeneity between trials may be at least 
partly attributable to these factors. Use of vitamin D was 
safe: potential adverse reactions were rare, and the risk 
of such events was the same between participants ran-
domised to intervention and control arms.
Why might use of bolus dose vitamin D be ineffective 
for prevention of acute respiratory tract infection? One 
explanation relates to the potentially adverse effects of 
wide fluctuations in circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
concentrations, which are seen after use of bolus doses 
but not with daily or weekly supplementation. Vieth 
has proposed that high circulating concentrations after 
bolus dosing may chronically dysregulate activity of 
enzymes responsible for synthesis and degradation of 
the active vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin 
D, resulting in decreased concentrations of this metab-
olite in extra-renal tissues.38 Such an effect could atten-
uate the ability of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to support 
protective immune responses to respiratory pathogens. 
Increased efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in 
those with lower baseline vitamin D status is more read-
ily explicable, based on the principle that people who 
are the most deficient in a micronutrient will be the 
most likely to respond to its replacement.
strengths and limitations of this study
Our study has several strengths. We obtained IPD for 
all 25 trials identified by our search; the proportion of 
randomised participants with missing outcome data 
was small (3.4%); participants with diverse character-
istics in multiple settings were represented; and 
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured using vali-
dated assays in laboratories that participated in exter-
nal quality assessment schemes. Our findings therefore 
have a high degree of internal and external validity. 
Moreover, the subgroup effects we report fulfil pub-
lished “credibility criteria” relating to study design, 
analysis, and context.39  Specifically, the relevant effect 
modifiers were specified a priori and measured at base-
line, P values for interaction remained significant after

adjustment for potential confounders, and subgroup 
effects were consistent when analysed as proportions 
and event rates. Survival analysis revealed consistent 
trends that did not attain statistical significance, possi-
bly owing to lack of power (fewer studies contributed 
data to survival analyses than to analyses of propor-
tions and event rates). The concepts that vitamin D 
supplementation may be more effective when given to 
those with lower baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels 
and less effective when bolus doses are administered, 
are also biologically plausible. A recent Cochrane 
review of randomised controlled trials reporting that 
vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of severe 
asthma exacerbations, which are commonly precipi-
tated by viral upper respiratory tract infections, adds 
further weight to the case for biological plausibility.40 
 
Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis 
that baseline vitamin D status and dosing regimen 
independently modify the effects of vitamin D supple-
mentation, we cannot exclude the possible influence of 
other effect modifiers linked to these two factors. The 
risk of residual confounding by other effect modifiers is 
increased for analyses where relatively few trials are 
represented within a subgroup—for example, where 
subgroup analyses were stratified by dosing regimen. 
We therefore suggest caution when interpreting the 
results in table 3.
Our study has some limitations. One explanation for 
the degree of asymmetry seen in the funnel plot is that 
some small trials showing adverse effects of vitamin D 
might have escaped our attention. With regard to the 
potential for missing data, we made strenuous efforts to 
identify published and (at the time) unpublished data, 
as illustrated by the fact that our meta-analysis includes 
data from 25 studies—10 more than the largest aggregate 
data meta-analysis on the topic.13 However, if one or two 
small trials showing large adverse effects of vitamin D 
were to emerge, we do not anticipate that they would 
greatly alter the results of the one step IPD meta-analy-
sis, since any negative signal from a modest number of 
additional participants would likely be diluted by the 
robust protective signal generated from analysis of data 
from nearly 11 000 participants. A second limitation is 
that our power to detect effects of vitamin D supplemen-
tation was limited for some subgroups (eg, individuals 
with baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations <25 
nmol/L receiving bolus dosing regimens) and for some 
secondary outcomes (eg, incidence of lower respiratory 
tract infection). Null and borderline statistically signifi-
cant results for analyses of these outcomes may have 
arisen as a consequence of type 2 error. Additional ran-
domised controlled trials investigating the effects of 
vitamin D on risk of acute respiratory tract infection are 
ongoing, and inclusion of data from these studies in 
future meta-analyses has the potential to increase statis-
tical power to test for subgroup effects. However, all 
three of the largest such studies (NCT01169259, 
ACTRN12611000402943, and ACTRN12613000743763) are 
being conducted in populations where profound vita-
min D deficiency is rare, and two are using intermittent 
bolus dosing regimens: the results are therefore unlikely 
to alter our finding of benefit in people who are very defi-
cient in vitamin D or in those receiving daily or weekly 
supplementation. A third potential limitation is that 
data relating to adherence to study drugs were not avail-
able for all participants. However, inclusion of non-ad-
herent participants would bias results of our intention to 
treat analysis towards the null: thus we conclude that 
effects of vitamin D in those who are fully adherent to 
supplementation will be no less than those reported for 
the study population overall. Finally, we caution that 
study definitions of acute respiratory tract infection 
were diverse, and virological, microbiological, or radio-
logical confirmation was obtained for the minority of 
events. Acute respiratory tract infection is often a clini-
cal diagnosis in practice, however, and since all studies 
were double blind and placebo controlled, differences in 
incidence of events between study arms cannot be 
attributed to observation bias.
conclusions and policy implications
Our study reports a major new indication for vitamin D 
supplementation: the prevention of acute respiratory 
tract infection. We also show that people who are very 
deficient in vitamin D and those receiving daily or 
weekly supplementation without additional bolus 
doses experienced particular benefit. Our results add to 
the body of evidence supporting the introduction of 
public health measures such as food fortification to 
improve vitamin D status, particularly in settings where 
profound vitamin D deficiency is common.
