ABSTRACT
A rat model of sarcomatoid mesothelioma, mimicking some of the worst clinical 
conditions encountered, was established to evaluate the therapeutic potential of 
intracavitary curcumin administration. 
The M5-T1 cell line, selected from a collection established from F344 rats induced 
with asbestos, produces tumors within three weeks, with extended metastasis in 
normal tissues, after intraperitoneal inoculation in syngeneic rats. The optimal 
concentration/time conditions for killing M5-T1 cells with curcumin were first 
determined in vitro. Secondly, the potential of intraperitoneal curcumin administration 
to kill tumor cells in vivo was evaluated in tumor-bearing rats, in comparison with a 
reference epigenetic drug, SAHA.
Both agents administered at days 21 and 26 after tumor challenge produced 
necrosis within the solid tumors at day 28. However, tumor tissue necrosis induced 
with curcumin was much more extensive than with SAHA, and was characterized by 
infiltration with mononuclear phagocytic cells. In contrast, tumor tissue treated with 
SAHA contained foci of resistant cells and was infiltrated by many isolated CD8+ cells. 
The treatment of tumor-bearing rats with 1.5 mg/kg curcumin on days 7, 9, 11 and 
14 after tumor challenge dramatically reduced the mean total tumor mass at day 16. 
Clusters of CD8+ T lymphocytes were observed at the periphery of small residual 
tumor masses in the peritoneal cavity, which presented a significant reduction in 
mitotic index, IL6 and vimentin expression compared with tumors in untreated rats. 
These data open up interesting new prospects for the therapy of sarcomatoid 
mesothelioma with curcumin and its derivatives.
INTRODUCTION
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is one of the 
worst cancers in terms of clinical outcome. The 
sarcomatoid type is the most aggressive of the three 
major histological subtypes, with a median survival of 
3.5 months [1]. Despite some advances in chemotherapy 
with the association of cisplatin and pemetrexed [2], in 
over a decade there has been no significant progress in 
systemic treatment for MM [3], and this depressing

situation is mainly due to the to a lack of understanding 
of the complex biology of this cancer [4]. The situation 
is even more complicated by the fact that MM is often 
detected late in the development of the disease, with 
patients presenting with advanced cancers associated with 
breathlessness and pain [5]. Patients with sarcomatoid 
MM or those who are too ill to tolerate treatment are 
frequently excluded from therapeutic approaches, while 
medical complications are encountered in patients with 
peritoneal MM [6] or when the diaphragm is affected [7]. 
Thus, nearly two-thirds of patients fail to show a response 
to current procedures. To improve outcomes for patients 
with such aggressive cancers, clinicians are faced with 
two challenges. The first is to reduce tumor development 
and its wasting consequences with a procedure that does 
not develop resistance to treatment, and with limited 
toxicity. The second is to stimulate recognition of tumor 
cells by induction of a specific immune response directed 
towards eradicating residual tumor cells and avoiding 
early relapses. 
To improve tumor cell recognition by immune cells, 
the last decade has confirmed the potential of epigenetic 
drugs in reactivating the expression of silenced genes [8]. 
We have previously demonstrated that, in addition to cell 
cytoxicity, treatment with SAHA (Vorinostat®) contributes 
to an increase in the immunogenicity of tumor cells in 
vivo [9]. In contrast, the first goal stated above appears 
to be much more difficult to reach. Nevertheless, both the 
literature and clinical trials have confirmed the potential 
of a natural compound, curcumin, against various types of 
cancers [10, 11]. Six years ago, the epigenetic modulation 
of target genes by this molecule was also highlighted 
[12], emphasizing the interest of drugs relevant to 
polypharmacology [13], as opposed to targeted therapies. 
Subsequently, the modulation of DNA methylation, 
histone modification and microRNAs by curcumin have 
been reviewed [14]. To date, besides its evaluation as a 
histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) in clinical trials 
for lymphoma therapy [15], curcumin, alone [16] or in 
combination with other natural compounds [17], has been 
used mainly for chemoprevention as an epigenetic diet. 
However, this agent can also be selected for therapy, in 
particular using other routes of administration than the 
diet.
To address the poor bioavailability of curcumin, 
a first strategy has been based on the design of various 
curcumin derivatives, analogs and prodrugs that exhibit 
enhanced water solubility and biological activities [18, 
19]. A second strategy has consisted of injection of 
curcumin-loaded nanocarriers to increase therapeutic 
curcumin concentration at the target site and to avoid 
extensive metabolism by the liver. For this purpose, 
polymeric and albumin nanoparticles have been tested 
as carriers in normal mice and rats, demonstrating that 
encapsulation of curcumin improves pharmacokinetic 
parameters. Curcumin-loaded liposomes, albumin or 
polymeric nanoparticles have also been evaluated on 
different types of xenograft tumor models in athymic 
mice [19]. However, the pertinence of xenografts grown in 
immunodeficient strains of mice for predicting therapeutic 
efficacy in patients raises a number of questions [20] 
and consequently orthotopic tumor models are now 
preferred [21]. Finally, a third strategy has consisted 
of intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of curcumin or 
curcumin-loaded nanocarriers. The benefit provided by 
the use of this route of administration, compared with 
systemic chemotherapy, has already been documented 
for the treatment of cancers with peritoneal dissemination 
[22]. Since a pioneering study on a rat histiocytic tumor 
transplanted i.p. in an outbred rat strain was performed 
[23], this strategy has been successfully used for the 
treatment of C6 rat glioblastomas implanted in Wistar rats, 
first using free curcumin and then after the administration 
of curcumin incorporated into lipid-core nanocapsules 
[24]. 
Applied to the treatment of mesothelioma, we first 
demonstrated that curcumin efficiently kills murine MM 
cells in vitro [9]. Subsequently, this observation was 
confirmed by several independent studies on different 
murine and human MM cell lines [25-28]. In the present 
study, we have evaluated the therapeutic potential of this 
molecule in vivo in the rat, a species with a larger body size 
than the mouse that allows multiple samplings, presents 
a better orthology with human immune cell markers 
and has drug pharmacokinetic profiles that are closer to 
those of humans. The experimental model used, which 
was established in an immunocompetent inbred strain 
known for its stable genetic background, closely mimics 
the worst situation faced in patients. The information 
collected using this experimental approach demonstrates 
to some extent that the two challenges defined above were 
partially reached. In addition, this represents a good basis 
both for future optimization of treatment procedures with 
this molecule and its derivatives and for investigations of 
modification of the status of macrophages and CD8+ T 
cells induced by the treatment. 
RESULTS
Characterization of the M5-T1 rat mesothelioma 
cell line in vitro
From the four malignant mesothelioma cell lines 
in our biocollection, which were isolated from F344 rats 
induced with asbestos, the M5-T1 cell line was selected 
for this study because of its high invasive capacity in vitro 
(Figure 1A). M5-T1 cells displayed a spindle-shaped 
morphology (Figure 1B). In addition, they all expressed 
vimentin but only a few of the cells retained the epithelial 
differentiation markers, E-cadherin and cytokeratin

(0.76% ± 0.12% of the total population), as shown by 
immunofluorescence (Figures 1C-1F). These features 
are representative of a highly aggressive sarcomatoid 
phenotype. 
Optimal concentration/time combination allows 
curcumin to kill all tumor cells in vitro
We previously demonstrated that after 24 h 
treatment in vitro, 50% of M5-T1 cells remained viable 
in the presence of the highest concentration of cisplatin 
in the medium, 10.7 µM, while the highest concentration 
of curcumin, 100 µM, killed all tumor cells [29]. In 
addition, even after 48 h cisplatin treatment, resistant 
tumor cells were observed [29]. To extend these data, in 
this study we determined the curcumin concentration/
time combination that led to the killing of all tumor 
cells in vitro without the generation of resistant cells, 
and these results were compared with those observed 
after treatment with 10 µM SAHA or 10 µM cisplatin. In 
addition, under similar treatment conditions, the cytotoxic 
action of the tested drugs was evaluated in parallel on a 
subnormal, non-tumorigenic mesothelial rat cell line, F1-
0e. Within our biocollection, this cell line was selected 
as a reference, given its typical epithelioid cobblestone 
morphology comparable to normal mesothelial cells, and 
its maximal expression of epithelial markers (Pdpn, Ezr, 
Msln and Cdh1) and minimal expression of mesenchymal 
markers(Vim, Acta2 and Tgfb1) [30]. 
Overall, M5-T1 tumor cells differed from F1-0ep 
cells by a higher sensitivity to curcumin cytotoxicity. 
After incubation with 50 µM curcumin, a progressive 
decrease in the proportion of adherent living M5-T1 
cells was observed from 2 h to 6 h incubation (Figure 2A 
and Supplemental Figure S1-A). This phenomenon was 
amplified and observed for shorter times of incubation 
with 75 µm curcumin (Figure 2A and Supplemental 
Figure S1-C), while 100 µM curcumin killed almost all 
tumor cells after 4 h treatment. In contrast, confluent F1-
0ep cells were still observed after 2 h to 6 h incubation 
with 50 µM curcumin (Figure 2B and Supplemental 
Figure S1-B), and after 2 h and 4 h incubation with 75 µM 
curcumin (Figure 2B and Supplemental Figure S1-D). For 
floating cells collected at day 1, a significant proportion of 
living cells was still observed after treatment with 50 µM 
curcumin for 4 h and with 75 µM curcumin for 2 h (Figure 
2A and Supplemental Figure S2C). However, contrary to 
the situation observed with the F1-0ep cell line, where 
almost all floating cells rapidly resumed their normal 
morphologies (Figure 2B and Supplemental Figure S2B), 
a high proportion of M5-T1 tumor cells remained affected 
by the treatment (Figure 2A and Supplemental Figure 
S2A and 2C). In contrast to treatments with curcumin, 
after treatment with 10 µM SAHA or 10 µM cisplatin, 
the decrease in density of cells/proportion of living cells

in comparison with control wells was modest (Figures 
2C, and 2-D, and Supplemental Figure S3). Given these 
observations and the dramatic clinical signs reported in the 
toxicological evaluation of rats administered cisplatin i.p., 
including 23% loss of initial body weight at day 6 [31], for 
the in vivo experiments we decided not to include a group 
of tumor-bearing rats treated with cisplatin in this study. 
This decision was consistent with the recommendations 
on the welfare and use of animals in cancer research [21].
Evidence of rapid killing of M5-T1 cells by 
curcumin in vitro, in contrast to SAHA
Using fluorescent markers of apoptosis and necrosis 
(YO-PRO-1 and propidium iodide, respectively) and time-
lapse videomicroscopy, we observed that in comparison 
with other drugs, curcumin induces very early, in a dose-
dependent manner, apoptosis followed by necrosis in 
M5-T1 cells (Figure 3A). Morphological observations of 
tumor cells in culture after only 2 h treatment with 100 µm 
curcumin followed by 3 h incubation with normal medium 
revealed that a number of the cells exhibited characteristic 
features of dead cells (Figure 3C) which were not seen 
with control tumor cells (Figure 3B) or those treated 
with SAHA (Figure 3D). These characteristics included 
loss of membrane integrity and protrusion of cytoplasmic 
material, and modification of the nucleus and cytoplasmic 
aspect, the latter losing its transparency and becoming 
granulomatous. 
M5-T1 mesothelioma presents invasive properties 
and a high mitotic index in vivo
After intraperitoneal inoculation of 5 x 106 
cells, tumor cells progressively occupied all the space 
previously covered by adipocytes in the normal omentum, 
producing an omental cake three weeks after tumor 
challenge. In parallel, numerous metastatic nodules of 
1-2 mm diameter were observed in the peritoneal cavity 
(Figure 4A). Some of these nodules were found attached 
to different normal tissues, demonstrating the invasive 
capacities of tumor cells in vivo in the liver (Figure 4B), 
spleen (Figure 4C) and pancreas (Figure 4D). Evidence 
of tumor cells invading mesenteric lymph nodes (Figure 
4E), the diaphragm (Figure 4F), muscularis externa of 
the gut (Figure 4G) and lamina propria of the colonic 
mucosa (Figure 4H) was also observed. The metastatic 
tumor tissue attached to the parietal peritoneum was 
frequently characterized by a high mitotic index, with 10 
mitotic figures per x400 field (Figure 5A), the presence 
of macrophages in the external layer of the tumor (Figure 
5B) and signs of fibrosis at the interface with the normal 
tissues (Figure 5C). Consideration of all these observations 
led to the conclusion that the M5-T1 tumor corresponds to 
a TNM grading of T4N1M1.

Treatment effects of SAHA or curcumin in vivo 
differ by the extent of tumor necrotic areas 
Rats treated twice with 50 mg/kg SAHA or 750 
µg/kg curcumin, at days 21 and 26 after tumor challenge 
(Experiment E2, Figure 6), presented no macroscopic 
evidence of tumor mass reduction. However, rats treated 
with curcumin were characterized by the yellowish color 
of the solid tumors, some parts presenting a softer surface 
compared with the dense tumors observed in untreated 
(control) rats. Histological analysis of the solid tumors 
collected from rats treated with curcumin (Figure 7C) 
showed large areas of necrosis (insert), the central part 
of the remaining nodules being characterized by a low 
tumor cell density, without cytoplasmic staining, and with 
signs of hemorrhage and a high density of macrophages. 
In contrast, comparable areas of the omental tumor from 
control rats or rats treated with SAHA presented high 
tumor cell density, homogeneous cytoplasmic staining and

intact microvessels (Figures 7A and 7B). Quantification of 
the surfaces covered by necrotic cells demonstrated that 
the extension of necrosis within the invaded omentum was 
significantly higher after treatment with curcumin (Figures 
7E and 7G) compared with treatment with SAHA (Figures 
7F and 7G) and with control rats (Figure 7D). 
Treatment with SAHA or curcumin differ by the 
localization/density of immune cells
Untreated (control) rats were characterized by the 
rare presence of cells in the small necrotic areas within 
the omental tissue where the tumor initially grew (Figure 
8A and insert). Globally, the tumor tissue of rats treated 
with SAHA contained few monocytes/macrophages, in 
particular in areas of necrosis within the invaded omental 
tissue where only isolated positive cells were found, as in 
control rats (Figure 8C and insert). Conversely, within the 
tumor tissue of the rats treated with curcumin, numerous 
monocytes/macrophages were concentrated at the interface 
between the necrotic areas and viable tumor cells within 
the invaded omental tissue (Figure 8B and insert). 
In untreated (control) rats, isolated CD8+ cells 
were mostly present at the tumor front within the 
invaded omental tissue (Figure 8D). CD8+ cells were 
also present in the tumor tissues of rats treated with 
SAHA or curcumin, however their distribution/density 
differed in the two cases. In curcumin-treated rats, the 
CD8+ cells were distributed everywhere, including at the 
periphery of necrotic areas, close to dying cells (Figure 
8E). In contrast, in SAHA-treated rats, the distribution 
was heterogeneous, with few CD8+ cells at the periphery 
of necrotic areas and a maximum density at different 
points of the unaltered tumor tissue, sometimes at the 
vicinity of growing nodules (Figure 8F). Quantification of 
immune cells revealed that curcumin-treated rats differed 
significantly from control rats or SAHA-treated rats, with 
a much higher density of monocytes/macrophages per 
field (Figure 8G). Additionally, the density of CD8+ cells 
per field in the tumor was significantly higher in SAHA-
treated rats compared with curcumin-treated rats or control 
rats (Figure 8H). 
Multiple curcumin treatment reduces tumor mass 
and generates clusters of CD8+ T cells
Given the higher extent of necrotic areas and the 
absence of foci of resistant tumor cells observed within the 
tumor tissue after treatment with curcumin, in comparison 
with SAHA (in experiment E2 described above), 
experiment E3 focused on the comparison of multiple 
curcumin treatments vs untreated rats (Figure 6). Rats 
given four injections of 1.5 mg/kg curcumin at days 7, 
9, 11 and 14 after tumor challenge presented a significant 
reduction in their mean total tumor mass compared with 
controls. This result was particularly marked in a subgroup

of these features with observations made on metastatic 
tumors from the group of untreated (control) rats 
revealed that a few isolated CD8+ T lymphocytes were 
present (Figure 9H and 9I) as well as some monocytes/
macrophages (Figure 9J). In addition, examination of 
high-magnification images of CD8+ T lymphocytes 
infiltrating the inner part of residual tumors in treated rats 
showed moving cells following each other and presenting 
a fusiform morphology, in contrast to spherically shaped 
CD8+ T lymphocytes observed in untreated (control) rats 
(Figures 9K and 9L). Residual tumor tissue also presented 
a significantly reduced number of mitoses per field in the 
areas of compact tumor growth compared with comparable 
areas in tumors from untreated (control) rats (Figures 9M 
and 9N). Finally, multiple curcumin treatments produced 
a pronounced decrease both in the proportion of positive 
cells (Figure 10A) and intensity of staining (Figure 
10B) after immunohistochemical staining with an anti-
IL6 monoclonal antibody, suggesting a change in tumor 
microenvironment. This change was further evidenced by 
the disappearance of the mesenchymal character of this 
tumor, a characteristic observed previously [30], revealed 
by a dramatic decrease in the expression of vimentin in 
all parts of the tumor tissue (Figures 10C and 10D), in 
parallel with a decrease in cell density (Figure 10D).
Normal tissues without metastases present 
evidence of increased numbers of circulating 
CD8+ T cells
In normal rats, the presence of T lymphocytes in the 
pancreas, and in particular of CD8+ T cells, is extremely 
rare. Conversely, some areas within the pancreas of 
rats without metastases from the subgroup treated with 
curcumin (red arrow in Figure 9A) were characterized 
by the presence of numerous cells densely stained 
with a very high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. Further 
immunohistochemical staining of these areas with anti-
CD3 and anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies revealed that 
they corresponded to T lymphocytes, and particularly 
CD8+ T lymphocytes (Supplemental Figure S4A), some 
of them showing the same morphology as in Figure 9K. 
In contrast, the pancreas of control (untreated) rats was 
characterized by the presence of numerous circulating 
tumor cells, while CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were 
absent (Supplemental Figure S4B). 
Like the pancreas, the liver of treated rats presented 
no metastatic nodules attached to the capsule. Rather, the 
surface of the liver revealed a thickening of the capsule 
and the presence of CD8+ T cells (Supplemental Figure 
S5A, top), which contrasted strikingly with the dramatic 
invasion of the liver surface and absence of CD8+ T 
cells observed in control (untreated) rats (Supplemental 
Figure S5B, top). Within the liver parenchyma of treated 
rats, the vicinity of venules was also characterized by 
numerous CD8+ T cells, revealing their mobility, most of 
them in contact with minute tumor cells (Supplemental 
Figure S5A, bottom), conversely with the situation 
found in control (untreated) rats (Supplemental Figure 
S5B, bottom). Quantification of CD8+ T cells in these 
areas also revealed a significantly higher CD8+ T cell to 
tumor cell ratio in treated rats compared with control rats 
(Supplemental Figure S5C). 
Induction of a cell-mediated immune response in 
the spleen, and small tumor cell foci
This presence of circulating CD8+ T cells in normal 
tissues of curcumin-treated rats was corroborated by 
observations made in the white pulp of the spleen. In 
treated rats, the lymphoid sheath surrounding the central 
artery of the splenic nodules was characterized by larger, 
intensely stained and densely packed lymphocytes, which 
corresponded to CD8+ T cells after immunohistochemical 
staining (Supplemental Figure S6A), in contrast with 
control (untreated) rats. Numerous CD8+ T cells were 
also observed in the red pulp, some of them grouped 
(Supplemental Figure S6B).
In parallel, minute foci of tumor cells localized on 
the omentum in the vicinity of the liver were characterized 
by a high proportion of CD8+ T cells (Figure 11A). 
Lymphocytes found in these structures or present at the 
surface and inside the liver parenchyma both presented 
the same typical morphologies as those illustrated in 
Figures 9K-L. This fact, and their accumulation in places 
where tumor cells attempt to penetrate normal tissues 
(Figure 11B), tends to attest to their functionality and 
high mobility. Tumor cells found in close contact with 
several of these lymphocytes also revealed changes in 
their normal morphologies (size/shape, aspects of the 
nucleus and cytoplasm staining) (Figure 11B) suggesting 
modification of their metabolic state and behavior. 
DISCUSSION
In this study, we report data and observations on 
a rat model of sarcomatoid MM that could open up new 
prospects for the treatment of this devastating disease, 
which is associated with cancer cell dissemination and 
poor outcome. In addition, this model could represent a 
good basis for evaluating the immune status modification 
induced by the treatment. The capacity of curcumin 
administered intraperitoneally to kill a significant 
proportion of cancer cells, to induce an influx of 
macrophages in areas of apoptotic cells, and finally to 
produce an accumulation of CD8+ T cells at the periphery 
of residual tumor tissue and an infiltration of normal 
tissues was demonstrated. In contrast, the cytotoxic 
 Oncotarget

properties of SAHA were hampered by the emergence 
of resistant tumor cells, both after in vitro and in vivo 
treatment. 
Our results in vitro are in agreement with the 
observation that treatment with curcumin totally 
inhibited cell growth by mechanisms that are not cell-
type dependent [32]. They also confirm results obtained 
previously on various cancer cell types demonstrating that 
this molecule acts in parallel on different cell signaling 
pathways [33, 34] through its ability to bind directly 
to a plethora of proteins [35]. We confirm our previous 
data [29] and show that an optimal combination of 
concentration and time leads to the death of all tumor 
cells, avoiding the emergence of resistant cells, in 
contrast to treatment with SAHA or cisplatin. This dose 
dependency and time dependency have been documented 
previously [36]. Our observation that at 100 µM curcumin, 
all mesothelioma cells are definitively killed is in good 
agreement with the work of Romero-Hernández and 
colleagues on human astrocytoma cell lines, showing 
that at a high concentration, curcumin-induced 
apoptosis involves caspase-independent processes [37]. 
Furthermore, we provide evidence that, in contrast to the 
non-tumorigenic reference cell line used, almost all M5-T1 
tumor cells are definitively killed after 8 h exposure to 75 
µM curcumin. This result is supported by the very quick 
lethal effect of curcumin at high dose observed by Clark 
and colleagues, who also mentioned that no additional 
effect was observed at 48 h and 72 h compared with 24 
h [38]. Conversely, this result contrasts with reports on 
the growth-inhibitory effects of liposomal curcumin 
after 72 h [39], suggesting that for nanoformulations 
containing curcumin, the control of the rate of release 
of the drug is a critical parameter for its efficiency to 
kill tumor cells. Evidence for a rapid cytotoxic effect of 
curcumin has previously been reported by Killian and

cells exhibit morphological changes (white arrows) as compared with images from control (untreated rats) as seen in Figure 4B and

coauthors, showing that this molecule acts as an inhibitor 
of IκB kinase β as early as 2 h after treatment [40]. Our 
phase-contrast and time-lapse videomicroscopy images of 
apoptotic and necrotic tumor cells after 2 h treatment with 
curcumin are also consistent with the work of Kunwar 
and colleagues, showing very quick localization of the 
drug to the cell membrane and nucleus of MCF7 cells 
[41]. Finally, although the potential of curcumin against 
mesothelioma cells in vitro has already been demonstrated 
[25-28], the range of concentrations (10, 30 and 50 µM) 
and the single time (24 h) used led to a modest reduction 
in cell viability, including cell retraction and cell rounding 
without apoptosis induction, suggesting a mechanism of 
autophagy [26]. Interestingly, the results we obtained with 
50 µM are in good agreement with these observations, 
demonstrating that at this concentration tumor cell growth 
quickly resumes after treatment, a condition that must be 
avoided for in vivo experiments.
In this study, M5-T1 cells that retained the epithelial 
differentiation markers E-cadherin and cytokeratin 
represented less than 1% of the population, suggesting that 
curcumin is very effective in killing tumor cells with a 
dedifferentiated sarcomatoid phenotype known to develop 
resistance to conventional and targeted cancer therapies 
[42]. In vivo , in contrast to SAHA, i.p. administration 
of curcumin did not generate foci of resistant cells in 
the solid tumor. This observation is consistent with the 
recent confirmation that, conversely to 5-FU and platinum 
derivatives, curcumin inhibits specific pathways leading 
to treatment resistance [43], and with the suggestion that 
this molecule is particularly well adapted to the treatment 
of aggressive and/or resistant tumor cells [44]. The 
disappearance of nodules in the residual solid tumors, as 
well as areas exhibiting a maximum density of mitoses 
at their periphery, in comparison with untreated rats, 
suggests a link with the potential of curcumin to target 
cancer stem cells. This has been reviewed recently [45]. 
Besides the significant reduction of the mean total tumor 
mass, another interesting point concerns the dramatic 
decrease in the extent of metastasis. The absence of 
metastatic tumor tissue observed at the surface of 
the spleen, liver, diaphragm and parietal peritoneum 
emphasizes the interest of the route of administration used 
in this study. Our results are also consistent with recent 
clinical studies showing that the treatment of colorectal 
peritoneal metastases with intraperitoneal chemotherapy, 
as compared with systemic chemotherapy, contributes 
to reducing tumor burden [46]. Among studies reporting 
the inhibitory effect of intravenous administration of 
liposomal curcumin on tumor xenografts in the athymic 
mouse, doses of 40 mg/kg [33] or 50 mg/kg [47, 48] 
were used, which corresponded to the maximum volume 
that could be injected. In our study, the final amount of 
curcumin tested for i.p. injection, 1.5 mg/kg, which 
produced a significant reduction in the mean tumor mass, 
was very low compared to the 25 mg/kg i.v. dose used in 
a control group by Alam et al. [49]. Given the very low 
systemic toxicity reported for DMSO in different species 
[50], and the modest volume (1/3 v/v) used in our study, 
there appears to be a considerable margin in the maximum 
tolerated dose of this compound that could be used i.p. 
for chemotherapy. For example, in rats, i.p. injections of 
2 ml/kg (50% in saline) have even been shown to exhibit 
hepatoprotective properties [51]. 
Inflammation plays a considerable role in cancer, 
and this is particularly the case for MM. The use of 
phytochemicals to inhibit inflammatory processes 
implicated in cancer promotion has been suggested 
[52], a strategy that has been successful against the 
development of some aggressive types of cancer [53]. 
In this study, we confirm our previous suggestion that 
among phytochemicals, curcumin appears promising 
in limiting the wasting consequences of the progression 
of such aggressive cancers, as a suppressor of several 
proinflammatory factors secreted by the tumor [54]. Our 
results also tend to confirm the interest of the treatment 
strategy recently proposed by Benvenuto and colleagues, 
based on the administration of polyphenols in the serous 
cavity to reduce the chronic inflammatory response 
associated with MM development [55]. Curcumin has 
been recognized as an immunomodulatory agent that can 
modulate the activation of T cells, B cells, macrophages, 
neutrophils, NK cells and dendritic cells, through the 
downregulation of various proinflammatory cytokines 
[56]. In contrast with many anticancer drugs that exhibit 
deleterious effects on immune cells, prolonged i.p. 
curcumin injections do not impair the cytotoxic function 
of NK cells, while they do maintain the level of Th1 
regulatory cytokines and enhance the antigen-induced 
proliferation potential of T cells [57]. Interestingly, 
curcuminoids also inhibit the induction of nitric oxide 
synthase in activated macrophages [58], an effect that 
was established in vitro in 1995 [59] and confirmed in 
vivo three years later [60]. The observation of an influx 
of macrophages towards areas of dead/apoptotic tumor 
cells within the tumor tissue is consistent with the finding 
that curcumin administration increased the amount of 
plaque-forming cells in the spleen after immunization with 
SRBC, enhanced bone marrow cellularity and increased 
the phagocytic activity of macrophages in Balb/c mice 
[61]. Finally, our results highlight the therapeutic 
utility of curcumin in stimulating the immune reaction 
of the host against the tumor, and tend to confirm the 
myelopotentiating effect of this molecule, which has been 
described in a mouse tumor model [62]. 
In this study, an important concentration of clusters 
of CD8+ T lymphocytes was observed at the periphery of 
small tumor masses that remained in the peritoneal cavity 
or infiltrating microscopic masses in the omentum vicinal 
to the liver, in contrast with the case of rats treated with 
SAHA that presented numerous foci of isolated cells in 
areas of compact tumor growth in the solid tumor. The 
 Oncotarget

latter case could be explained by an increased expression 
of cancer antigens induced by inhibitors of histone 
deacetylases (iHDACs), which has previously been 
documented both in vitro and in vivo [63]. SAHA-induced 
increases in the expression of MHC class I-related chain 
molecules A and B have also been observed recently in 
two hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, resulting in 
an enhancement of immune recognition of tumors by 
innate immune cells [64]. Concerning the dense T-cell 
accumulation following treatment with curcumin, this 
has previously been observed in tumor-bearing mice, 
suggesting that the combination of multitargeting drugs 
with adoptive therapy could have the potential for clinical 
application [65]. Luo and coauthors also reported a 
proliferation of CD8+ T cells with enhancement of IFN-γ 
secretion and cytotoxicity specifically against 3LL tumor 
cells in tumor-bearing mice following i.p. treatment 
with curcumin [66]. Moreover, they documented the 
bimodal effect observed in vitro with this molecule, 
with a high dose of curcumin decreasing T-cell numbers 
whereas a low dose increased the T-cell number derived 
from 3LL tumor-bearing mice. In correlation with other 
previous observations made in vivo showing that low 
doses of curcumin downregulated the Bax level while 
augmenting Bcl-2 expression in CD4+/CD8+ T cells, 
thereby protecting the cells from tumor-induced apoptosis 
[67], our results also agree with the attenuation of tumor-
induced suppression of cell-mediated immune responses 
described by Bhattacharyya and colleagues [68]. Finally, 
in contrast with previous reports mentioning the presence 
of CD8+ macrophages in the context of glioma or various 
other CNS pathologies [69], our observations, including 
HPS staining and immunohistochemical labeling with 
anti-CD8 and anti-ED1, show that both the distribution 
and the morphology of these clusters of CD8+ cells 
differ from those of monocytes/macrophages. Overall, 
these observations, together with the disappearance of 
monocytes/macrophages from areas of compact tumor 
growth in the residual tumor mass and a significant 
decrease in the mitotic index, suggest a profound 
modification of the immunosuppressive environment 
produced by the tumor. Further evidence for this 
modification is also provided by the observation of a 
significant decrease in IL6 and vimentin expression in 
residual tumors. This observation is well correlated with 
findings by So and colleagues who demonstrated that 
different types of gynecologic cancer cells exposed to 
IL6 following co-culture with mesenchymal stem cells 
acquired facilitated metastasis and invasion by promoting 
EMT [70]. To summarize, our findings tend to demonstrate 
that the marked decrease in proinflammatory cytokines 
such as IL6, associated with a loss of mesenchymal 
character, both produced by curcumin treatment in our 
aggressive model of MM, may facilitate the emergence 
of an immune response directed against tumor cells. This 
T-cell-mediated response is evidenced by an increased 
production of CD8+ T cells in the spleen and their 
numerous presence, sometimes in contact with isolated 
tumor cells, both in normal tissues preserved from 
metastases, and in minute foci of residual tumor cells 
vicinal to these normal tissues, where these latter present 
important changes of their morphology.
In conclusion, these data open up interesting new 
prospects for the therapy of malignant mesothelioma 
with curcumin, in particular the sarcomatoid subtype. 
Future studies will determine the best sequence/dose(s) of 
curcumin or its many derivatives to use to optimize the 
specific immune response directed against M5-T1 cells. A 
complementary approach would also be the combination 
of curcumin/derivatives with current chemotherapeutic 
agents to reduce the dose used and the associated systemic 
toxicity of the latter. Finally, the treatment of these tumor 
cells with SAHA represents an interesting investigative 
tool for basic research in oncoimmunology, in particular 
to improve our understanding of the process of infiltration 
of mesothelioma by CD8+ T lymphocytes in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Rats and M5-T1 mesothelioma cell line
Fischer F344 rats were obtained from Charles River 
Laboratories (L’Arbresle, 69, France) and maintained 
under standard conditions in the UTE IRS-UN animal-
holding area, in agreement with European Union 
guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals in 
research protocols. The experiments were approved by 
the regional ethical committee for animal experiments 
(CEEA.2011.38, CEEA.2013.7, and project n° 01257.03). 
Rats were fed a pelleted standard diet (RM1, Special 
Diet Services, Witham, Essex, UK) with tap water ad 
libitum, anesthetized via an isoflurane chamber (Forene®, 
Abbott France) and euthanized with Dolethal® (Centravet, 
Pluduno, Plancoët, France) for experiments E2-E3. 
The M5-T1 mesothelioma cell line used in this study 
was selected from a biocollection established in 2011 
[https://migratech.inserm-transfert.fr/srv/tech/2/index100.
asp?cl=CL] after 136 to 415 days of induction with 10 
mg crocidolite fibers suspended in 0.5 ml 0.9% NaCl, 
administered intraperitoneally to rats (UICC analytical 
sample, ref. 02704A, Neyco, 75017 Paris, France). After 
378 days of induction, one male rat was necropsied about 
one hour after death, presenting signs of hemorrhage, 
widespread neoplastic implants and nodules in the 
peritoneal cavity, as previously described [30], which, 
when dissociated with a scalpel and cultured, led to the 
M5-T1 cell line.

Cell culture and chemicals
Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented 
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml 
penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 2 mM L-Glutamine 
(Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), in a humidified 
atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. Stock solutions of 
curcumin (Sigma-Aldrich, L’isle d’Abeau Chesnes, 
38, France), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), 
(Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., Canada) and cisplatin 
(Mylan, St Priest, 69, France) were dissolved in DMSO 
and preserved at -20°C before use. 
Modified Boyden chamber invasion assay
The in vitro invasive properties of the four 
neoplastic cell lines (M5-T1, M5-T2, F4-T2 and F5-T1) 
were assessed using a modified Boyden chamber assay. 
An aliquot of 105 cells in serum-free medium was placed 
in the upper compartment of the invasion chamber (BD 
BioCoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber, BD Biosciences, 
Bedford, MA, USA). The lower compartment was filled 
with RPMI containing 10% FCS. The chambers were 
incubated for 17 h at 37°C. The filters were then fixed in 
methanol and stained with hematoxylin. Quantification of 
the invasion assay was performed by counting the number 
of cells at the lower surface of the filters (23 fields at 400x 
magnification).
Immunofluorescence
Subconfluent monolayers of M5-T1 cells cultured on 
glass coverslips were fixed with methanol. The coverslips 
were incubated with either a mouse monoclonal antibody 
to vimentin (clone V9; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), a 
mouse monoclonal antibody to E-cadherin (clone 36, BD 
Transduction Laboratories, BD Biosciences, San Jose, 
CA) or a mouse monoclonal antibody to cytokeratin 
(clone AE1/AE3, Dako). Monolayers were next incubated 
with Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-coupled anti-
mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). Nuclei 
were stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes). The staining 
was analyzed using a Zeiss AxioImager fluorescence 
microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Germany).
Analysis 
of 
the 
concentration 
and 
time 
dependency of tumor cell killing by curcumin in 
vitro 
Cell lines were seeded at 1 x 105 cells/well at day 
-2, in 12-well plates (Nunclon delta, Nunc AS, Denmark). 
These conditions were selected in order to obtain a cell 
density in the central part of the wells corresponding to 
the beginning of three-dimensional growth of the M5-T1 
cells (which have the propensity to produce spheroids [29, 
30]). For growth-inhibition and cell-killing assays, 48 h 
after adhesion (day 0) the medium was replaced with fresh 
medium containing increasing concentrations of curcumin 
(50, 75 or 100 µM), 10 µM SAHA, 10 µM cisplatin or 
1% DMSO (control wells). F1-0e and M5-T1 tumor cells 
were incubated for 2 h, 4 h, 6 h or 8 h in these conditions, 
after which the medium was replaced with normal medium 
for 24 h. At day 1, floating cells were resuspended after 
two flushes with the medium for each well, the cells were 
centrifuged, and the pellets were resuspended in fresh 
medium and placed into the wells of two new 12-well 
plates. In parallel, fresh medium was added to each well in 
the first two 12-well plates (adherent cells). At day 2, the 
central part of each well of both plates was photographed 
at x100 and x320 magnification using a Zeiss Observer.
Z1 AX10 inverted microscope and the ZEN imaging 
software, and left for an additional period of three days. 
Each well was reexamined each day for a period of 14 
days to determine the level of confluence and the presence 
of resistant cells. 
For detection of apoptosis and necrosis, 48 h after 
adhesion, the medium was replaced with fresh medium 
containing 5 µM YO-PRO-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, 
OR), 20 µM propidium iodide (Molecular Probes), and 
either 10 µM cisplatin, 10 µM SAHA or increasing 
concentrations of curcumin (10, 25, 50, 75 or 100 µM), 
and the 12-well plate was placed under a Zeiss Axio 
Observer.Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GlbH, 
Germany) equipped with an environmental chamber 
maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 and an ORCA Flash4.0 
v2 camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, 
Japan) and driven by Metamorph software (Molecular 
Devices, Downingtown, PA). Fluorescent images at a 10-
fold magnification of cells stained with YO-PRO-1 and 
propidium iodide were successively recorded every 10 
min during 24 h.
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Tumor and tissue samples from the liver, spleen, 
pancreas, gut, diaphragm, mesenteric lymph nodes, 
parietal peritoneum and adipose tissue were fixed in 4% 
buffered paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin wax, 
cut with a Bond Max automaton (Menarini, Rungis, 
France) and stained with hematoxylin-phloxine-saffron 
(HPS). Antibodies used for immunohistochemical 
analyses were anti-rat ED1 antibody (MAB1435 1/100, 
EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) used 
as a pan-macrophage marker, mouse anti-CD3 (SM253P, 
Acris Antibodies, San Diego, USA), anti-CD8 (LS-B3665, 
LSBio France, 92000 Nanterre), mouse anti-rat IL-6 (AT-
3060, Clinisciences, Nanterre, France), and anti-vimentin 
(ab8978, Abcam), with an anti-mouse secondary antibody 
and N-Histofine Simple Stain Mouse MAX Peroxidase

reagent. Histopathology slides were scanned with a 
Nanozoomer 2.0 HT (Hamamatsu, Japan). 
 In vivo studies
Three successive in vivo experiments were 
conducted in this study. In the first experiment (E1), a 
group of three male and three female F344 rats was used 
to determine the potential of the M5-T1 mesothelioma 
cell line to produce tumors in syngeneic rats three 
weeks after i.p. transplantation of 5 x 106 cells into the 
peritoneal cavity. The second experiment (E2) was aimed 
at comparing the potential of curcumin or SAHA injected 
i.p. to kill M5-T1 cells in vivo. For this purpose, two 
successive injections of 750 µg/kg curcumin (3 rats) or 
50 mg/kg SAHA (3 rats) were given i.p. to young male 
F344 rats (8 weeks of age) at days 21 and 26 after tumor 
challenge (day 0), and the animals were euthanized at day 
28. Three other rats received only the vehicle (DMSO, 50 
µl in 0.5 ml saline, i.p.) and served as controls (euthanized 
at day 28). To optimize the curcumin treatment procedure 
and to simulate the conditions of use in patients, a third 
experiment (E3) was conducted on 12 older male rats (16 
weeks of age). In order to follow the recommendations 
on the welfare and use of animals in cancer research, 
particular attention was given in this experiment to 
incorporating the objectives of the 3Rs (replacement, 
reduction and refinement) [21]. In particular, given the 
knowledge of the pathogenesis of this model collected 
in experiments E1 and E2, the number of M5-T1 cells 
injected for tumor challenge was limited to 3 x106 cells 
and a shorter-duration endpoint was chosen for euthanasia 
(day 16), in order to limit the consequences of tumor 
burden to the animals. After challenging the rats with M5-
T1 cells (on day 0), four successive injections of 1.5 mg/
kg curcumin (corresponding to 150 µl of the 10 mM stock 
solution diluted in 0.3 ml saline) were given i.p. to six rats 
on days 7, 9, 11 and 14. The six other rats received only 
the vehicle (DMSO, 150 µl in 0.3 ml saline) and served as 
controls. All rats were euthanized at day 16, and all tissues 
including small metastatic nodules or residual tumor tissue 
were collected and fixed for further determination of total 
tumor masses and histological examination.
