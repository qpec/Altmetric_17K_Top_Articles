IMPORTANCE Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors were recently
approved for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia (FH) or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and have
potential for broad ASCVD prevention. Their long-term cost-effectiveness and effect on total
health care spending are uncertain.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors and their potential effect
on US health care spending.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model, a simulation
model of US adults aged 35 to 94 years, was used to evaluate cost-effectiveness of PCSK9
inhibitors or ezetimibe in heterozygous FH or ASCVD. The model incorporated 2015 annual
PCSK9 inhibitor costs of $14 350 (based on mean wholesale acquisition costs of evolocumab
and alirocumab); adopted a health-system perspective, lifetime horizon; and included
probabilistic sensitivity analyses to explore uncertainty.
EXPOSURES Statin therapy compared with addition of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Lifetime major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE:
cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke), incremental cost per
quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and total effect on US health care spending over 5 years.
RESULTS Adding PCSK9 inhibitors to statins in heterozygous FH was estimated to prevent
316 300 MACE at a cost of $503 000 per QALY gained compared with adding ezetimibe to
statins (80% uncertainty interval [UI], $493 000-$1 737 000). In ASCVD, adding PCSK9
inhibitors to statins was estimated to prevent 4.3 million MACE compared with adding
ezetimibe at $414 000 per QALY (80% UI, $277 000-$1 539 000). Reducing annual drug
costs to $4536 per patient or less would be needed for PCSK9 inhibitors to be cost-effective
at less than $100 000 per QALY. At 2015 prices, PCSK9 inhibitor use in all eligible patients
was estimated to reduce cardiovascular care costs by $29 billion over 5 years, but drug costs
increased by an estimated $592 billion (a 38% increase over 2015 prescription drug
expenditures). In contrast, initiating statins in these high-risk populations in all statin-tolerant
individuals who are not currently using statins was estimated to save $12 billion.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Assuming 2015 prices, PCSK9 inhibitor use in patients with
heterozygous FH or ASCVD did not meet generally acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness
thresholds and was estimated to increase US health care costs substantially. Reducing annual
drug prices from more than $14 000 to $4536 would be necessary to meet a $100 000 per
QALY threshold.

P
roprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) fa-
cilitates the degradation of low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) receptors, reducing the clearance of circulating
LDL particles.1 PCSK9 activity is inversely related to LDL
cholesterol (LDL-C) level: gain-of-function PCSK9 gene mu-
tations are one cause of elevated LDL-C and cardiovascular
risk in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH),2 whereas loss-
of-functionmutationscauselowLDL-Candreducedriskofath-
erosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).3 These observa-
tions spurred the development, testing, and US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval of 2 therapeutic agents that in-
hibit PCSK9 and lower LDL-C.1
Inclinicaltrialsof3to12months’duration,2PCSK9inhibi-
tors, alirocumab and evolocumab, reduced mean LDL-C levels
by 47.5% (95% CI, 25.3%-69.6%).4,5 Although these trials were
not powered for clinical outcomes, ASCVD events appeared to
bereducedwithPCSK9inhibitortreatment(oddsratioformyo-
cardialinfarction[MI],0.49;95%CI,0.26-0.93).4Basedonthese
data, PCSK9 inhibitors were approved for use in patients with
FH or preexisting ASCVD who require additional lowering of
LDL-C despite maximally tolerated doses of statins.1 If clinical
benefitsseeninshort-termtrialsaresustainedinthelongerterm,
PCSK9 inhibitors could become an important option for pa-
tients at high risk of ASCVD, potentially lowering health care
coststhroughpreventingASCVDevents.However,withamean
USpricein2015ofmorethan$14 000perpatientperyear,their
cost-effectiveness and effect on national health care spending
are uncertain. The goal of this study was to assess the value of
PCSK9 inhibitors from the health system perspective by con-
ducting a cost-effectiveness analysis and examining potential
effects on total US health care spending using an established
simulation model of ASCVD in the US population.
Methods
The institutional review boards of the University of Califor-
nia, San Francisco, and Columbia University approved the
analyses of Framingham data. All other analyses were con-
ducted on publicly available data.
Model Structure
TheCardiovascularDiseasePolicyModelisanestablishedsimu-
lation model of coronary heart disease and stroke incidence,
prevalence, mortality, and costs in the US population aged 35
years or older (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).6-8 In the popula-
tion without ASCVD, the model predicts incidence of coronary
heartdisease,stroke,anddeathduetononcardiovascularcauses
as a function of age, sex, and conventional ASCVD risk factors
(systolicbloodpressure,smokingstatus,diabetesmellitus,body
mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and LDL-C).
In those who develop ASCVD, the model characterizes the ini-
tial event (cardiac arrest, MI, angina, or stroke) and its se-
quelae,includingcardiovasculardeath,for30days.Inthepopu-
lationswithahistoryofASCVD,themodelpredictssubsequent
cardiovascular events, coronary revascularization proce-
dures, and cardiovascular or noncardiovascular mortality as a
function of age, sex, and clinical history.
ThemodelincludedtheentirepopulationofUSadultsaged
35 to 74 years in 2015 and followed them over their lifetime
(until death or survival to 95 years of age). The prevalence of
cardiovascular risk factors was estimated from population-
weighted National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
veys (NHANES) from 2005-2012.9 Utilities and costs were as-
signed to each clinical event and health state in annual cycles
and discounted at 3% annually10 (Table 1). The model as-
sumed the health system perspective, considering all direct
health care costs (including immediate and downstream costs
associated with disease progression or longer life expec-
tancy). Extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity
analyses were conducted to account for input parameter un-
certainty.ThemodeladheredtorecommendationsofthePanel

Target Population
Base-casesimulationsmodeledthecost-effectivenessofPCSK9
inhibitors in 2 target adult populations defined using NHANES
to approximate current FDA-approved indications38,39:
• Heterozygous FH: either (1) family history of premature coro-
nary heart disease and LDL-C level of at least 190 mg/dL
(4.91 mmol/L) without statin therapy or LDL-C level of at
least 150 mg/dL (3.88 mmol/L) with statin therapy (in line
with the recent consensus statement of the American
Heart Association)40,41 or (2) no family history of premature
coronary disease and LDL-C level of at least 250 mg/dL
(6.46mmol/L)withoutstatintherapyorLDL-Clevelofatleast
200 mg/dL (5.17 mmol/L) with statin therapy
• Preexisting ASCVD: history of angina, MI, or stroke, with
LDL-C level of at least 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) despite maxi-
mally tolerated statin therapy
The base-case assumption was that 10% of each popula-
tion was “statin intolerant,
” but the size of this population var-
ied in sensitivity analyses.42,43
Key Points
Question What are the cost-effectiveness and potential effect on
health care spending of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin
type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor treatment in heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease?
Findings In this simulation model of US adults aged 35 to 94
years, adding PCSK9 inhibitor therapy to current statin regimens
was estimated to cost $423 000 per quality-adjusted life-year
(QALY) gained compared with adding ezetimibe and increased US
health care costs by $565 billion over 5 years (including a 38%
increase in annual prescription drug expenditures over 2015
levels). Price reductions from more than $14 000 annually to
$4536 would be necessary to meet a $100 000 per QALY
threshold.
Meaning Assuming 2015 prices, PCSK9 inhibitor use did not meet
generally accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds and was
estimated to increase US health care costs substantially.

Treatment Strategies
Three treatment strategies were modeled: (1) status quo,
defined by statin use as identified in the 2005-2012 NHANES;
(2) incremental treatment with ezetimibe; and (3) incremen-
tal treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors. In each case, the incre-
mental drug was added to statin therapy or was used as
monotherapy among those intolerant to statins.
The degree of LDL-C reduction with ezetimibe and PCSK9
inhibitorswasestimatedfromthepublishedliterature(Table1).
Statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors were each assumed
to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by an identical
amount per milligram per deciliter of LDL-C reduction.13,14 Al-
ternative assumptions were modeled in sensitivity analyses.
Among patients receiving PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, 5%
were assumed to develop mild injection site reactions result-
ing in a small disutility, without an increase in costs or treat-
ment discontinuation.15,17,18,21,24
Costs and Utilities
Age- and sex-specific health care costs were estimated using
national data (Table 1).27-31 Annual drug costs were assumed
to be equal to their wholesale acquisition costs26; in the case
of PCSK9 inhibitors, this was assumed to be the mean of the
2015 annual costs of alirocumab ($14 600) and evolocumab
($14 100).26,44 Health-related quality-of-life weights and se-
verity distributions for ASCVD states were based on the Global
Burden of Disease 2010 study.32-34
Main Outcomes and Measures
The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effective-
nessratio(ICER;costperquality-adjustedlife-year[QALY])over
the lifetime analytic horizon.10 Secondary outcomes were
(1) incremental cost per life-year gained; (2) the number of
patients that would need to be treated for 5 years to avert 1 ma-
jor adverse cardiovascular event (MACE, defined as a compos-
ite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke);
(3) the price at which the drugs became cost-effective at a
willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY; (4) the
total effect on the US health care budget over the next 5 years
if all eligible patients were to receive PCSK9 inhibitors
(compared with receipt of ezetimibe); and (5) the net mon-
etary benefit of incremental therapy with a PCSK9 inhibitor
at willingness-to-pay thresholds ranging from $50 000 to
$1 000 000 per additional QALY.
Sensitivity Analyses
One-way sensitivity analyses for key input parameters were
performed by varying one input at a time while holding oth-
ers constant at their base-case estimates. Several prespeci-
fied scenario analyses were also performed, including (1) using
higher LDL-C thresholds to define heterozygous FH (LDL-C
≥250 mg/dL [6.46 mmol/L] without statin therapy or LDL-C
≥200 mg/dL [5.17 mmol/L] with statin therapy) and assum-
ing a higher ASCVD risk than predicted by LDL-C level (2 times
the risk for individuals with heterozygous FH compared with
individuals without FH for the same LDL-C level); (2) model-
ing the main effect of ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors on car-
diovascularoutcomesasseeninclinicaltrials(ratherthanbased
on the LDL-C hypothesis; eTable 6 in the Supplement)14-23;
(3) initiating PCSK9 inhibitors only after incident MI (by simu-
lating addition of PCSK9 inhibitors among those with inci-
dent MI in the base year); (4) initiating PCSK9 inhibitor

a In multiway probabilistic sensitivity analyses, model parameters varied
randomly by predefined statistical distributions. To limit the degrees of
freedom, some parameters were assumed to be correlated (all drug costs, all
other health care costs).
bConsistent with the LDL hypothesis, the base case assumed a constant relative
reduction in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction or CHD mortality for
each millimole per liter of reduction in LDL-C, independent of the agent used
to lower LDL-C (statin, ezetimibe, or PCSK9 inhibitor). This was estimated
from the most recent meta-analysis from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists.13
Sensitivity analyses explored the range of uncertainty in this end point as seen
in IMPROVE-IT for ezetimibe14 and in a meta-analysis of PCSK9 trials that
reported that end point.15-23 See the eAppendix in the Supplement for details.
c The base case assumed a constant relative reduction in the risk of stroke for
each millimole per liter of reduction in LDL-C, independent of the agent used
to lower LDL-C (statin, ezetimibe, or PCSK9 inhibitor). This was estimated
from the most recent meta-analysis from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists.13
Sensitivity analyses explored the range of uncertainty in this end-point as seen
in IMPROVE-IT for ezetimibe.14 There were too few strokes in the short-term
PCSK9 trials, so the range was extended to include no evidence of benefit with
PCSK9 inhibitors. See the eAppendix in the Supplement for details.
dDrug costs were included in 1-way sensitivity analyses but not in the
probabilistic analysis.
e In the base case, the cost of a PCSK9 inhibitor was assumed to be the average
of the wholesale acquisition price of alirocumab ($14 600) and evolocumab
($14 100).
f In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the population mean for health care
costs was varied by −20% to +25% because confidence intervals were not
available from the primary data sources.

eling a 0.5% incidence of mild neurocognitive defects in pa-
tients receiving PCSK9 inhibitor therapy; and (7) treating all
currently untreated, statin-tolerant individuals with statins.
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses simultaneously varied
multiple input parameters across prespecified statistical dis-
tributions in 1000 iterations. Table 1 shows the range and type
of distribution used for each input parameter. The results of
these simulations captured the uncertainty in key outcomes
and are presented as (1) 80% uncertainty intervals (UIs) around
the point estimate for clinical and economic outcomes and
(2) acceptability curves showing the proportion of simula-
tions in which PCSK9 inhibitor therapy was the optimal treat-
mentstrategyatvariouswillingness-to-paythresholds.Ofnote,
80% (rather than 95%) UIs were chosen to avoid issues re-
lated to extreme outliers such as flipped ordering of strate-
gies or negative ICERs. See the eAppendix in the Supplement
for additional methodologic details.
The CVD Policy Model is programmed in Lahey Fortran 95.
Modeled outcomes were analyzed using QuickBasic64 and
Excel 2011 (Microsoft) and statistical analyses were per-
formed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) and Stata ver-
sion 13 (StataCorp).
Results
Base-Case Analysis
Of 1.7 million individuals aged 35 to 74 years who met criteria
forheterozygousFH,1.1million(61%)wereeithertakingastatin
or designated as statin intolerant and thus eligible for ezeti-
mibe or PCSK9 inhibitor treatment (Table 2). Mean age was 51
years and mean LDL-C level was 207 mg/dL (5.36 mmol/L). Ad-
dition of ezetimibe to statin therapy was estimated to avert
214 400 MACE and generate 475 100 additional QALYs at an
ICERof$152 000perQALY(Table3andeTable10intheSupple-
ment). Compared with adding ezetimibe, adding a PCSK9 in-
hibitor was estimated to result in 316 300 fewer MACE and
628 500 additional QALYs. The number needed to treat over
5 years to prevent 1 MACE in patients with heterozygous FH
currently taking statins or statin intolerant was estimated to
be 72 for ezetimibe relative to status quo and 59 for PCSK9 in-
hibitors relative to ezetimibe. Treating the entire 35- to 74-
year-old FH population taking statins or statin intolerant with
PCSK9 inhibitors over their lifetime was estimated to cost $323
billion more than treating with ezetimibe; an estimated $17 bil-
lion would be offset by decreased cost of cardiovascular care
due to averted events, leading to a net of $582 000 per life-
year gained or $503 000 per QALY (Table 3).
Among the 13.0 million individuals with ASCVD, 8.5 mil-
lion(65%)eitherweretakingastatinwithanLDL-Clevelhigher
than 70 mg/dL or were statin intolerant; mean age was 61 years
and mean LDL-C level was 109 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L) (Table 2).
Addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy was estimated to avert
2.7 million MACE and generate 5.3 million QALYs at an ICER
of $154 000 per QALY (Table 4 and eTable 10 in the Supple-
ment). In contrast, addition of a PCSK9 inhibitor to statin
therapy was estimated to avert an additional 4.3 million MACE
andproduce7.9millionadditionalQALYs(comparedwithezeti-
mibe plus statin). The number needed to treat over 5 years to
prevent 1 MACE among those with ASCVD and not meeting the
LDL-C goal despite maximally tolerated statin therapy was es-
timated to be 51 for ezetimibe compared with status quo and
35 for PCSK9 inhibitors relative to ezetimibe. PCSK9 inhibitor
therapy over the lifetime in this population was projected by
the model to cost $3.3 trillion more than treating with ezeti-
mibe, but $155 billion was estimated to be offset by decreased
cost of cardiovascular care due to averted events, for a net of
$378 000 per life-year gained or $414 000 per QALY (Table 3).

In 1-way sensitivity analyses varying drug cost, analytic hori-
zon,discountfactor,magnitudeofLDL-Creduction,andthepro-
portion of statin-intolerant individuals, cost-effectiveness of

Threshold Analyses and Effect on Health Care Spending
A cost-effectiveness threshold of $100 000 per QALY was
achieved when the annual price of PCSK9 inhibitors was re-
ducedby68%to70%to$4536(Figure2andeTable11andeFig-
ure 4 in the Supplement). Simulations that modeled the use of
PCSK9 inhibitors instead of ezetimibe among all currently eli-
gible patients resulted in an estimated $592 billion increase in
drugspendingover5years(Table4andeTable12intheSupple-
ment). Although cardiovascular costs were estimated to de-
crease by $29 billion over the same period, there was an esti-
mated net increase of $568 billion in health care spending.
AddingPCSK9inhibitortherapytostatusquostatintherapywas
estimated to generate the greatest net monetary benefit if the
willingness-to-pay threshold was at least $423 000 per QALY
(eFigure 5 in the Supplement). For willingness-to-pay thresh-
olds ranging from at least $155 000 per QALY to less than
$423 000 per QALY, the greatest net monetary benefit was es-
timated to result from adding ezetimibe to status quo statin
therapy. At any level of willingness to pay less than $155 000
per QALY, neither strategy was estimated to yield a net mon-
etarybenefit,andthecomparator,statusquostatintherapy,was
projected by the model to be the optimal choice.
Scenario Analyses
Most scenarios resulted in the same or economically less fa-
vorable ICERs for PCSK9 inhibitors, including (1) modeling the
effects on ASCVD as estimated from drug-specific clinical trials
rather than the LDL hypothesis (eTable 13 in the Supple-
ment); (2) incorporating alternative quality-of-life estimates
(eTable14intheSupplement);(3)stoppingincrementaltherapy
at age 75 years (eTable 15 in the Supplement); and (4) model-
ing a decrement in quality of life related to subcutaneous in-
jections or additional adverse drug reactions (eTables 16 and
17 in the Supplement).
A few scenarios resulted in more economically favorable
ICERs or budget projections. Defining the heterozygous FH
population using higher LDL-C thresholds resulted in 460 000
fewer adults eligible for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, a lower ICER
($435 000 per QALY), and a smaller increase in estimated
spending ($28.6 billion over 5 years); assuming those with FH
have a 2-fold higher ASCVD risk than that predicted by their
LDL-C level improved the ICER to $175 000 per QALY. Restrict-
ing PCSK9 inhibitor therapy to statin-intolerant patients in the
heterozygous FH and ASCVD populations resulted in ICER es-
timates of $282 000 per QALY and $346 000 per QALY, respec-
tively (eTable 18 in the Supplement). Restricting PCSK9 in-
hibitortherapytopatientswithanincidentMIloweredtheICER
to an estimated $304 000 per QALY (eTable 19 in the Supple-
ment). Reducing the prevalence of statin intolerance from 10%
to 3% resulted in 974 000 fewer individuals eligible for PCSK9
therapy with an estimated decrease in health care spending
of $10.2 billion over 5 years. Initiating statin treatment among
all individuals with heterozygous FH or ASCVD not currently

over 5 years compared with status quo.
Discussion
This economic evaluation of PCSK9 inhibitors from the US
health system perspective demonstrates that their use as in-
dicated could substantially reduce MIs, strokes, and cardio-
vascular deaths. However, even if they prove highly effective
in preventing ASCVD, PCSK9 inhibitors are not cost-effective
at 2015 prices, and achieving commonly accepted cost-
effectiveness thresholds would require price reductions by
more than two-thirds.47 At 2015 prices, PCSK9 inhibitor use
in eligible individuals between the ages of 35 and 74 years was
estimated to increase annual prescription spending by ap-
proximately $125 billion over ezetimibe use (a 38% increase
from the approximately $329 billion spent on prescription
drugs in 2015) and US health care expenditures by about
$120 billion (a 4% increase from the $2.8 trillion dollars in total
US health care spending in 2015).48
The effect of a new medication on health care spending is
determined by the size of the target population, duration and
effectiveness of therapy, drug price, and costs of care.49 Al-
though new, expensive therapies indicated for short dura-
tion or for treatment of rare conditions have thus far been ab-
sorbedbythebudgetsofhealthsystems,thehighcostofPCSK9
inhibitors is uniquely challenging. This is because PCSK9 in-
hibitors are meant to be lifelong therapy not only for the rela-
tively small number of patients with FH but also for a large and
growing population with ASCVD. As a result, the potential in-
crease in health care expenditures at current or even moder-
ately discounted prices could be staggering, despite cost sav-
ings from averted ASCVD events.
Restricting the population treated with PCSK9 inhibitors
is one strategy for containing costs. Higher-risk patient sub-
groups (such as those with a recent MI or heterozygous FH
patients with higher LDL-C levels) would likely derive greater
benefit from PCSK9 inhibitors; use in a smaller number of

higher-risk patients lowers total spending, but PCSK9 inhibi-
tor therapy is still not cost-effective in these groups at cur-
rent prices. Identifying patients with true statin intolerance
(by rechallenging patients with statins50 or performing n-of-1
trials to assess statin tolerability51) could also reduce the
number of individuals eligible for PCSK9 inhibitors and lower
total costs.
The results of multiple scenario analyses suggest that re-
ducing the price of PCSK9 inhibitors remains the primary ap-
proachtoimprovingthevalueofthesetherapies.Althoughbio-
logic agents are inherently more expensive to study and
manufacture compared with small molecules, these costs may
not be the ultimate driver of pricing.52 Furthermore, the US
prices of biologic agents have not declined over time and have
increased 6% to 12% a year for top-selling rheumatoid arthri-
tis drugs.53 Although generic biosimilars may eventually lower
drug costs, their entry has often been delayed by complex
manufacturing and approval requirements, extending the ef-
fective market exclusivity of the pioneer drugs and reducing
pricecompetitionafterpatentexpiration.54Biosimilarsofother
therapies currently available in the European Union cost 25%
to 30% less than the reference biologic agent55; if the US ex-
perience with PCSK9 inhibitors is comparable, biosimilar ver-
sions of PCSK9 inhibitors would still not be cost-effective.
These results are consistent with those of the National Insti-
tute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom: al-
thoughPCSK9inhibitorswereinitiallyintroducedintheUnited
Kingdom at a price less than half that in the United States
(Figure 1), they were approved for use in the National Health
Service only after manufacturers agreed to an additional price
discount.56
In the face of limited health care resources, payers must
consider the potential trade-off between paying for new drug
treatments like PCSK9 inhibitors and investing in interven-
tions known to improve access, physician prescription rates,
and patient adherence to statin therapy among those at high
ASCVD risk. Nationally representative data from NHANES in-
dicate that more than one-third of both FH and ASCVD pa-
tients who have an LDL-C level of at least 70 mg/dL are not cur-
rently receiving statins, despite evidence of long-term
effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness.57 Fully treating
these populations that have an indication for statins but are
currently not receiving them would actually save an esti-
mated $12 billion over 5 years.
This analysis has several limitations. First, no long-term
data on clinical outcomes exist for PCSK9 inhibitors. Al-
though the short-term trials suggest lower rates of MI and car-
diovascular death, these were not powered for clinical out-
comes, and several nonstatin medications that lower LDL-C
have not shown clinical benefit in long-term trials.58 If ongo-
ing clinical trials demonstrate that the drugs do not improve
clinical outcomes as predicted by their effect on LDL-C, this
model will have overestimated their cost-effectiveness. Sec-
ond, the effect of PCSK9 inhibitors on total health care spend-
ing in the community setting will depend on uptake and ad-
herence, which may vary based on age, educational status,

comorbidities,andcostsharing.Thelong-termeffectofmissed
doses of PCSK9 inhibitor therapy on clinical effectiveness is
currently unknown, although from an economic standpoint,
patients who stop taking the drug accrue neither costs nor ben-
efits and therefore do not alter the cost-effectiveness of the
drug. Third, because LDL-C–lowering treatment in FH may be-
gin in childhood or young adulthood to prevent premature
coronary heart disease, the model may not have captured the
entire clinical and economic burden of FH or the benefits of
LDL-C lowering in childhood or young adulthood. However,
there are no data about the efficacy or safety of PCSK9 inhibi-
tors in children and there are limited data in young adults, and
PCSK9 inhibitors are currently approved for use only among
adults. The base case assumed that the elevated cardiovascu-
lar risk among patients with FH is mediated by their high lev-
els of LDL-C along with other known cardiovascular risk fac-
tors. Although contemporary data on cardiovascular risk in
heterozygousFHarelimited,apatientwithFHmayhavehigher
ASCVD risk than predicted by their LDL-C level, perhaps be-
cause of the early-life exposure to high LDL-C. In a sensitivity
analysis, doubling ASCVD risk related to LDL-C levels in FH re-
sulted in an improved ICER that was still above the $100 000
per QALY threshold.
Conclusions
Assuming2015prices,PCSK9inhibitoruseinpatientswithhet-
erozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or ASCVD did not
meet generally acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness
thresholds and was estimated to increase US health care costs
substantially. Reducing annual drug prices from more than
$14 000 to $4536 would be necessary to meet a $100 000 per
QALY threshold.
