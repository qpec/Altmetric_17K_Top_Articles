SUMMARY
Repeated drug use has long-lasting effects on plas-
ticity throughout the brain’s reward and memory sys-
tems. Environmental cues that are associated with
drugs of abuse can elicit craving and relapse, but
the neural circuits responsible for driving drug-cue-
related behaviors have not been well delineated,
creating a hurdle for the development of effective
relapse prevention therapies. In this study, we used
a cocaine+cue self-administration paradigm fol-
lowed by cue re-exposure to establish that the
strength of the drug cue association corresponds
to the strength of synapses between the medial
geniculate nucleus (MGN) of the thalamus and the
lateral amygdala (LA). Furthermore, we demonstrate,
via optogenetically induced LTD of MGN-LA synap-
ses, that reversing cocaine-induced potentiation of
this pathway is sufficient to inhibit cue-induced
relapse-like behavior.
INTRODUCTION
Chronic use of cocaine leads to the formation of long-term mem-
ories of the environmental stimuli associated with the drug use
experience. Over time, exposure to just the stimuli, or cues, is
sufficient to induce physiological and psychological responses
that drive continued use and relapse (Torregrossa and Taylor,
2013). Thus, a potential treatment strategy is to reduce the
strength of drug cue memories to prevent craving and relapse.
This may be possible by inducing extinction of the memory, a
process whereby repeated cue exposure without the drug re-
duces the predictive value of the cue (Rich and Torregrossa,
2018). However, a major limitation of enacting memory-based
treatments is that the neural correlates underlying drug cue
memories have not been established.
In animal cocaine self-administration (SA) models, cocaine-
cue memories form when an instrumental action (e.g., lever
pressing) results in cocaine delivery (unconditioned stimulus
[US]) paired with an audiovisual conditioned stimulus (CS). After
repeated CS-US pairings, CS presentations by themselves can
increase drug-seeking actions. Cue-driven drug seeking likely
develops through cellular processes such as long-term potenti-
ation (LTP) in neurons that are activated by the drug cue experi-
ence (Cruz et al., 2014). In contrast, extinction may reverse this
plasticity and/or result in new learning, but this has not been
determined for drug cue memories. Rather, prior animal studies
have focused on the mechanisms regulating the drug-seeking
action, not of the cue memory that drives relapse (Peters et al.,
2008). However, most clinical efforts to extinguish drug mem-
ories have focused on the cues, leaving a large gap in the
pre-clinical literature in identifying the locus and molecular
mechanisms underlying the formation and extinction of drug
cue memories.
On the other hand, fear-conditioned memories have been
investigated extensively, where manipulation of the cue is the
norm because of the purely Pavlovian nature of fear conditioning.
Formation and extinction of fear memories requires plasticity at
thalamic and cortical inputs to the lateral amygdala (LA) (Hong
et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2007a). Thalamic projections from the
medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) that synapse in the LA have
been shown to be of particular importance for the establishment
of auditory fear-associated memories (Ferrara et al., 2017; Kwon
et al., 2014), and optogenetic induction of long-term depression
(LTD) at these synapses can extinguish fear-related memories
(Nabavi et al., 2014). Given that the amygdala also encodes
memories with positive affective value (Carelli et al., 2003;
Hsiang et al., 2014; Shabel and Janak, 2009), drug cue-associa-
tive memories, particularly those that involve an auditory compo-
nent, may also be encoded at MGN-LA terminals.
Here we present evidence that cocaine-cue memory forma-
tion induces synaptic potentiation at MGN thalamo-amygdala
(T-LA) but not cortico-amygdala (C-LA) synapses and that
extinction of the cue memory, but not the lever pressing action,
reverses this plasticity. Furthermore, optogenetic LTD of MGN-
LA synapses produces physiological and behavioral changes
indicative of cue extinction. Together, these results identify a
specific neural correlate and cellular mechanism responsible
for the acquisition and extinction of drug cue memory and pre-
sent potential therapeutic approaches to prevent relapse.

 press produced an infusion of cocaine (1 mg/kg/infusion) or
saline, paired with an audiovisual CS (Figure 1A). Cocaine- but
not saline-trained animals demonstrated reliable acquisition of
SA (Figures 1B and 1C). After at least 10 days of 1-h SA sessions,
rats underwent instrumental extinction (IE) for 6–10 days, where
lever pressing produced no consequences (Figure 1A). 24 h after
the last IE session, rats had ‘‘cue re-exposure sessions’’ during
which they received passive presentations of the CS (0, 3, 60,
or 120 times) without levers available and in the absence of
cocaine reinforcement (Figure 1A). 24 h later, the capacity of
the CS to promote cocaine-seeking behavior was determined
during a cue-induced reinstatement session. Compared with
non-re-exposed controls (0 CS presentations), both 60 and
120 CS presentations significantly attenuated reinstatement in
a progressive manner (Figure 1D), confirming previous studies
showing that relapse-promoting, cocaine-cue associations that
form during cocaine SA can be extinguished by sufficient unrein-
forced re-exposures to the cue (Torregrossa et al., 2013).
In separate groups, we tested whether cocaine-cue associa-
tions were regulated by specific LA synaptic modifications by
performing ex vivo recordings in rats trained to self-administer
cocaine or saline, followed by cue re-exposure either 24 h after
the last SA session or after IE sessions (described below). The
timing of recordings corresponded to the timing of when cue-
induced reinstatement tests were conducted in the prior exper-
iment (Figures 1A and 2A). Previous studies of auditory fear con-
ditioning found that the strength of T-LA and C-LA synapses
corresponded to fear memory strength (Hong et al., 2009; Kim
et al., 2007a), so we investigated whether similar modifications
underlie cocaine-cue associations. To test this, electrically
evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded
from LA principal neurons in acute slices by stimulating either
internal capsule (IC; putative thalamic afferents) or external
capsule (EC; putative cortical afferents) fibers (Doron and
Ledoux, 2000; Hong et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2007a; Figures 2B
and 3A). We tested a series of stimulation intensities to generate
an
input-output
relationship
whereby
EPSC
amplitude
is
increased with larger stimulation intensity. These relationships
have commonly been used to assess synaptic changes following
extinction of conditioned fear memories (Kim et al., 2007a,
2007b; Hong et al., 2009). Relative to saline-trained controls,
cocaine-trained non-CS-re-exposed rats showed an upward
shift in the input-output relationship with significantly increased
EPSC amplitudes at large stimulation intensities (Figures 2C
and 2D). These data suggest that the formation of cocaine-cue
associations potentiates T-LA synapses.
We next assessed how CS re-exposure may affect T-LA syn-
aptic strength. As shown in Figures 2C and 2D, increasing the

 number of CS re-exposures progressively reduced T-LA trans-
mission efficacy. Compared with 0 CS animals, EPSC amplitude
was slightly but non-significantly increased in animals that un-
derwent brief CS re-exposure (3 CSs), suggesting that cue mem-
ory reactivation may tend to strengthen, or at least maintain, the
drug cue association through reconsolidation processes and
that 3 CS presentations are insufficient to produce any evidence
of extinction learning. However, further increasing the number of
cue presentations (60 and 120 CSs) attenuated EPSC amplitude.
Rats that underwent 120 CS re-exposures exhibited average
EPSC amplitudes similar to those of saline controls, indicating
that sufficient cue re-exposure depotentiates T-LA synapses
and reverses the synaptic changes induced by cocaine+cue
SA. To rule out the possibility that the observed synaptic poten-
tiation was simply due to re-exposure to the SA context, a sepa-
rate control group of rats underwent cocaine SA but then

 remained in their home cages rather than being re-exposed to
the SA context. Although context-re-exposed rats show slightly
higher EPSC amplitudes than home cage controls, these differ-
ences were not significant (Figure S2). Thus, our observation of
synaptic strengthening after cocaine SA is a persistent effect
and was not solely due to re-exposure to the cocaine context.
However, context re-exposure may lead to a tendency to further
strengthen T-LA synapses.
We next asked whether T-LA synaptic strength was modu-
lated by the strength of the cocaine-cue association (Figures
2E and 2F). We found a trend of a positive correlation between
the total number of cocaine infusions received during SA and
the average EPSC amplitude in rats with no cue re-exposure.
Conversely, in rats that underwent 120 CS extinction, there
was no correlation between these factors. These data suggest
that increased cocaine-cue pairing tends to be associated with
more strongly potentiated T-LA synapses. However, sufficient
cue re-exposure in the absence of drug reinforcement weakens
T-LA synapses independent of prior drug cue experience.
As described above, previous studies have found that extinc-
tion of a drug-seeking action is associated with synaptic
changes throughout the brain’s reward circuitry (Kalivas et al.,
2005; Park et al., 2002). To determine whether T-LA synapses
would be differentially regulated by inclusion of the IE phase of
the experiment, a separate group of rats underwent 6–10 days
of IE after SA. During IE, animals could press both the active
and inactive levers but received no cocaine infusion or CS pre-
sentation. During the first day of IE, rats pressed the active lever
frequently (Figure S3B), likely in anticipation of a cocaine infu-
sion. However, rats quickly adapted and extinguished the lever
press response. Interestingly, IE alone was insufficient to depot-
entiate T-LA synapses (Figure 2G). Cocaine-trained rats that
underwent IE followed by 0 CS re-exposure had EPSC ampli-
tudes similar to rats that did not undergo IE. Similarly, rats that
underwent IE plus 120 CS re-exposure exhibited depotentiated
T-LA synapses just as the group that did not receive IE.
Together, these data demonstrate that T-LA synapses are regu-
lated explicitly by the strength of drug cue associations and not
by memories of the drug-taking action.
To identify potential mechanisms underlying changes in T-LA
synaptic strength, we first examined whether alpha-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor
(AMPAR) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR)
currents changed as a result of cocaine SA and cue re-exposure.
We found that synaptic changes were driven predominantly by
AMPARs rather than NMDARs (Figures 2H and 2I). The AMPAR
current was enhanced by cocaine SA and remained elevated
following brief cue re-exposure; however, it was decreased by
cue extinction. Changes in NMDARs may also contribute to the
potential strengthening effects of memory reconsolidation
because 3 CS-exposed rats had significantly higher AMPAR
and NMDAR currents relative to saline-trained and 120 CS rats
(Figures 2H and 2I). However, NMDAR currents were not signif-
icantly altered under other CS conditions. These results suggest
a postsynaptic increase in AMPAR number and/or functionality
following cocaine SA, which was reversed by CS re-exposure
during extinction training. In addition, we compared AMPAR
EPSC paired-pulse ratios (PPRs) and found no significant differ-
ences between groups (Figure 2H), suggesting that presynaptic
glutamate release was not altered. Together, these data suggest
that, during cocaine-cue memory formation, T-LA synapses
are potentiated because of increased AMPAR transmission
via postsynaptic mechanisms, which promotes drug-seeking.
Sufficient cue re-exposure in the absence of cocaine reverses
these changes and decreases the ability of the CS to promote
drug-seeking.
Finally, we sought to determine whether C-LA synapses also
encode the strength of cocaine-cue associations. To test this,
we stimulated EC afferents while recording from LA principal
neurons (Figure 3A). Contrary to T-LA synapses, the EPSC
input-output relationship was not affected at C-LA synapses
by cocaine SA or CS re-exposure (Figures 3B and 3C). Further-
more, EPSC amplitude at C-LA synapses did not correlate with
the number of CS-US pairings received during training (Figures
3D and 3E). These results suggest that cortical afferents to the
LA are not modulated by cocaine-cue learning. However, IE
training did depotentiate AMPAR EPSCs at C-LA synapses inde-
pendent of cue extinction (Figure 3F). EPSC amplitude at C-LA
synapses was significantly decreased after IE both in rats that
received no cue re-exposure (cocaine [Coc] + 0 CSs) and those
that received extended cue re-exposure (Coc + 120 CSs). There-
fore, cortical input to the amygdala appears to be regulated not
by drug-cue associations but by extinction of the drug-taking
action.
MGN-LA Synapses Are Altered by Cocaine-Cue
Associations
Projections from multiple thalamic nuclei innervate the amygdala
(LeDoux et al., 1990; Nabavi et al., 2014), and studies of auditory
fear conditioning suggest that connections between the MGN
and LA are particularly important for mediating auditory cue-spe-
cific memories. Given that the auditory tone component of the
cocaine-paired audiovisual cue is likely to have a high degree
of salience in rats, we tested whether projections from the
MGN to the LA are strengthened by cocaine-cue associations.
We expressed a variant of channelrhodopsin in MGN neurons
(AAV5.hSyn.oChIEF.tdTomato) (Lin et al., 2009; Nabavi et al.,
2014), and approximately 2 weeks after viral infusions, rats un-
derwent a similar procedure as described above (Figure 4A),
where they were trained to SA cocaine or saline, followed by
either 0 or 120 CS re-exposures. 24 h after cue re-exposure
sessions, amygdala slices were prepared, and light-evoked
(473-nm) EPSCs were recorded from LA principal neurons (Fig-
ures 4B and 4C). Optogenetic stimulation of MGN terminals
within the LA revealed a shifted input-output relation to higher
EPSC amplitude in cocaine-trained non-CS re-exposed animals
relative to saline-trained controls, whereas 120 CS re-exposure
resulted in a reversal of this potentiation (Figure 4C). Again, the
changes in synaptic strength were primarily mediated by post-
synaptic changes in AMPAR currents. Compared with cocaine-
trained non-CS re-exposed animals, those that underwent
extended cue re-exposure had a significantly reduced AMPAR
current, but there were no group differences for either NMDAR
current or PPR (Figures 4D–4F). These results suggest that
drug-cue associations are mediated by dynamic changes in
AMPAR signaling at MGN-LA synapses.

 In Vivo Optogenetic Induction of LTD at MGN-LA
Synapses Attenuates Relapse-like Behavior
We next determined whether we could mimic extinction of drug-
cue memories by inducing circuit-specific LTD at MGN-LA syn-
apses. We first demonstrated the capacity to optically induce
LTD at MGN-LA synapses. Rats were injected with adeno-asso-
ciated virus and a channelrhodopsin variant (AAV-oChiEF) into
the MGN and were trained to SA cocaine or saline, followed by
either 0 or 120 CS re-exposure. 24 h later, ex vivo electrophysi-
ological recordings were performed. In current clamp configura-
tion, LA-projecting MGN afferents were stimulated with 473-nm
light to evoke excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs).
Following LTD induction (1 Hz, 15 min), sustained suppression
of EPSP slope and amplitude was reliably
observed
in
cocaine-trained 0 CS re-exposed rats (Figures 5A, 5B, and
S5A). However, LTD was not observed in saline-trained rats (Fig-
ures 5A and 5B) or in cocaine-trained 120 CS re-exposed rats
(Figures 5A and 5B), presumably because LTD is occluded at
non-potentiated synapses. These results suggest not only that
LTD can be induced in cocaine-trained rats but that an LTD-
like process is induced at MGN-LA synapses by cue memory
extinction.
Finally, we tested whether in vivo optogenetic LTD induction
could reduce cue-induced cocaine-seeking. Rats were injected
with AAV-oChIEF or AAV-tdTomato targeting the MGN, and
optic fibers were implanted, targeting the dorsal portion of the
LA (Figures 6A and 6B). Following SA and IE, rather than under-
going cue re-exposure, rats received either in vivo low-frequency
optical LTD (1 Hz, 15 min 473-nm light stimulation) of MGN-LA
terminals or did not receive laser stimulation (sham controls).
24 h later, either ex vivo optical recordings or cue-induced rein-
statement was performed. Rats that were exposed to optical
LTD had significantly reduced MGN-LA EPSC amplitude relative
to sham controls (Figure 6C), confirming induction of LTD by our
stimulation protocol. As further evidence that this in vivo optical
stimulation paradigm induced LTD, we found that we could not
produce LTD in neurons from rats that received the in vivo optical
stimulation but could observe LTD in neurons from rats that un-
derwent sham stimulation (Figure S5B). Thus, in vivo LTD
occluded further LTD induction in slice. We next demonstrated
that in vivo optical LTD of MGN-LA terminals reduced cue-eli-
cited drug-seeking because LTD-exposed rats made signifi-
cantly fewer lever presses during reinstatement compared with
both a group of rats expressing a control virus that received laser
stimulation as well as sham controls (Figure 6D). Rats subse-
quently underwent an additional reinstatement test 7 days later,
and LTD-exposed rats maintained a low level of responding that
was lower than that of sham controls (Figure 6E).These data
show that induction of LTD at MGN-LA synapses is sufficient
to reduce drug-seeking in a manner similar to cue extinction
and that this reduction can persist across multiple reinstatement
tests. Together, these results indicate that drug-cue memories
may be malleable to circuit-specific optogenetic manipulations.
DISCUSSION
We have previously shown that re-exposure to cocaine-associ-
ated discrete cues in the absence of cocaine reinforcement
can attenuate cue-elicited drug-seeking (Rich et al., 2016). In
this study, we extend our findings and show that sensory input
from the thalamus, but not the cortex, regulates cue-driven
drug-seeking behaviors. Specifically, T-LA but not C-LA synap-
ses are potentiated by pairing cocaine with an audiovisual
cue. Importantly, this association is long-lasting because rats
still showed T-LA synaptic potentiation after 7 days of IE.
Conversely, re-exposure to the cue in the absence of cocaine
progressively depotentiated T-LA synapses, inhibiting relapse-
like behavior. Furthermore, in vivo optogenetic induction of
LTD in the MGN-LA pathway of cocaine-trained rats was suffi-
cient to reduce reinstatement. Although optical LTD of this
pathway has previously been demonstrated to inhibit a fear-
associated memory (Nabavi et al., 2014), this study provides
direct evidence that MGN-LA circuit-specific plasticity underlies
drug-cue memories.
In our study, brief cue re-exposure (3 CSs) did not alter the
potentiation of T-LA synapses or cue-induced reinstatement.
Brief cue re-exposure likely reactivates the drug-cue memory,
initiating reconsolidation (Arguello et al., 2014; Rich et al.,
2016). Reconsolidation is thought to strengthen or at least main-
tain memory, and our experiments showed a nonsignificant

 increase in T-LA EPSC amplitude relative to cocaine-trained
non-CS re-exposed rats 24 h after reactivation, when memory
is thought to be restabilized. The lack of statistical significance
does not rule out a memory-strengthening effect. For example,
the destabilization and restabilization of memory that occur after
reactivation are likely to involve postsynaptic signaling, which
may explain the significant increase in NMDAR current.
The importance of synaptic plasticity within the amygdala has
been well documented for the regulation of other types of asso-
ciative learning. Auditory fear conditioning potentiates both the
T-LA and C-LA pathways, and cue extinction reverses these
changes and reduces the expression of fear (Hong et al., 2009;
Kim et al., 2007a). The importance of the amygdala during
reward-based learning has also been demonstrated (Carelli
et al., 2003; Fuchs et al., 2006; Hsiang et al., 2014; Robbins
et al., 2008). For example, a small percentage of neurons within
the LA are important for the formation of a cocaine place prefer-
ence memory (Hsiang et al., 2014). Moreover, in vivo electro-
physiology recordings have shown that a percentage of
amygdala neurons fire in response to presentation of cocaine-
associated cues (Carelli et al., 2003). The specific afferent inputs
involved in the encoding of drug-associated memories have not
been well-examined, although sucrose reward learning can
strengthen T-LA and C-LA synapses. C-LA synapses, however,
were only strengthened when dopamine was elevated by dopa-
mine transporter (DAT) blockade (Tye et al., 2008, 2010). In our
study, despite the DAT-blocking effects of cocaine, we did
not see C-LA potentiation, although procedural differences,
including the absence of a sucrose reward, may explain this
seeming discrepancy.
Here we show that T-LA synapses are strengthened by the
formation of a cocaine-cue association but that these alter-
ations are reversible in a cue ‘‘dose’’-dependent manner, with
120 CS re-exposure fully reversing cocaine-cue-associated
potentiation. Extinction of a fear memory also appears to be
dose-dependent, with a single extinction session promoting
fear inhibition through enhanced inhibitory tone in LA neurons,
enhanced CS-evoked activity in the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC), and enhanced synaptic efficacy at amygdala interca-
lated neurons (An et al., 2017; Amano et al., 2010; Chhatwal
et al., 2005; Milad and Quirk, 2002). Multiple extinction ses-
sions, however, produce depotentiation of T-LA synapses
and seeming erasure of fear memory. Thus, our results are
consistent with these fear studies, although we do find that a

 large number of CS presentations (120) are necessary for
consistent reductions in drug-seeking.
The lack of group effects on C-LA synapses may speak to the
importance of bottom-up signaling during reward-motivated be-
haviors that is less dependent on cognitive influence. Previous
studies have demonstrated the influence of top-down circuits
in extinction; however, these studies involved extinction of the
drug-taking action (Augur et al., 2016; Stefanik et al., 2016). Inter-
estingly, we did observe depotentiation of C-LA synapses in
response to IE, suggesting a role of this circuit in IE. Our findings
also do not rule out any cortical influence on drug-cue memory
extinction because the C-LA pathway mostly relays input from
the auditory and visual cortex (Te2 and Te3) and perirhinal cortex
(McDonald, 1998), whereas other cortical areas project via sepa-
rate pathways.
Our study identifies postsynaptic glutamatergic signaling as a
mechanism responsible for regulating drug-cue memory. Future
studies should continue to expand upon the mechanisms and
circuits involved. Calcium signaling and intracellular kinases
and phosphatases are important for cue-associated memories
(Merlo et al., 2014; Rich et al., 2016b), and these downstream
signaling mechanisms are likely involved in synaptic modifica-
tions following drug-cue re-exposure; for example, the internal-
ization of AMPARs, which is necessary for the extinction of
acquired fear (Dalton et al., 2008). Additionally, mGluR1 and
mGluR2 receptors in the amygdala are critical for depotentiation
and the extinction of fear-associated memories (Hong et al.,
2009; Kim et al., 2007b). Although our study focuses on auditory
thalamic inputs to the LA, the mediodorsal and paraventricular
nuclei of the thalamus also project to the mPFC, nucleus accum-
bens, and amygdala (Do-Monte et al., 2017; Vertes et al., 2015).
These circuits have been implicated in fear conditioning (Penzo
et al., 2015), incubation of drug-seeking (Li et al., 2015; Lu
et al., 2005), and the regulation of reward-seeking when an antic-
ipated reward is omitted (Do-Monte et al., 2017) and, therefore,
could also influence drug-cue memory. Given that our experi-
ments involve use of a multimodal (i.e., audiovisual) cue, it is
interesting that manipulating the MGN-LA pathway is so effec-
tive at reversing cocaine-cue-evoked plasticity. One explanation
for this may be the relatively greater salience of an auditory cue
to a visual cue in a rat strain with poor vision. The lateral genicu-
late nucleus (LGN) is the primary thalamic region involved in
visual processing, but the behavioral effect of LTD in LGN-LA
projections is unknown. However, it is possible that combined
manipulation of LGN and MGN pathways could more completely
eliminate cue-motivated lever pressing during reinstatement.
Finally, because drugs of abuse act on the brain’s reward sys-
tem, the role of dopaminergic inputs from the VTA in modulating
LA afferent input should also be examined. Activation of DA re-
ceptors has been shown previously to enhance Te3-evoked re-
sponses in the LA (Rosenkranz and Grace, 2001). Similarly,
elevated dopamine during cue-sucrose learning was sufficient
to enhance C-LA plasticity when measured 30 min after training
(Tye et al., 2010), so dopamine likely also influences plasticity
during reconsolidation and extinction of a drug-cue memory.
Finally, one limitation of cue extinction as a therapy is that
drug-seeking often spontaneously returns after a period of absti-
nence (Peters et al., 2008; Rescorla, 2004). Interestingly, in our
study, extended cue extinction was sufficient to reduce
relapse-like behavior, even in animals that had extensive drug-
cue experience, suggesting that long-term cue re-exposure in
the absence of drug reinforcement may be effective at prevent-
ing relapse even in chronic drug abusers. Optical induction of
LTD in the MGN-LA pathway, which is occluded by prior cue
extinction, results in similar decreases in reinstatement that lasts
for at least a week, suggesting that cue extinction occurs via a
persistent depotentiation of T-LA synapses. Together, these re-
sults support the idea that circuit-specific neuroadaptations can
support the long-term inhibition or erasure of a drug-cue memory
and offer an important consideration for the development of
novel treatments. However, future studies should determine
whether LTD-based stimulation therapy can be made selective
for maladaptive drug memories or whether adaptive reward-
associated memories would also be affected.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animals
Naive, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (Envigo/Harlan), weighing 275-325 g on arrival, were used in all studies (total n for all exper-
iments = 213). All rats were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room, in auto-ventilated racks with an automated
watering system. Animals were housed in pairs, given ad libitum access to food and water, and maintained on a 12 h light-dark cycle.
Prior to surgical procedures, rats were given at least 5 d to acclimate to the facility. Rats were food-deprived 24 h prior to the start of
behavioral experiments and maintained at �90% of their free-feeding body weight (�20 g of chow per day) for the duration of testing.
All behavioral experiments were run during the light-cycle. Animals were allocated to groups following cocaine self-administration
(SA) and, when applicable, instrumental extinction (IE), based on a matching procedure that ensured no significant differences be-
tween acquisition and IE behavior (See Figures S1 and S3). All procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes
of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Pittsburgh’s Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.
Viral Vector Construct
Adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) vectors were constructed to deliver oChIEF, a variant of the blue-light sensitive opsin
channelrhodopsin (ChR2). oCHIEF is a mammalian codon version of ChIEF, with stronger expression in mammalian cells and an
additional N-terminal amino acid residue that can respond to both low and high frequency stimulations (Nabavi et al., 2014; Lin
et al., 2009). oChIEF was flanked downstream by the fluorescent marker tdTomato and expression of oChIEF was driven by the
neuron-specific synapsin (hSyn) promoter (Lin et al., 2009). In some experiments, a control tdTomato expressing AAV5 was used.
The oChIEF construct was donated by Dr. Roger Tsien and processed for packaging and purification by the Duke Viral Vector Core.
METHOD DETAILS
Drugs
Cocaine hydrochloride (generously provided by the Drug Supply Program of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Research Triangle
Park, NC) was dissolved in sterile 0.9% saline (2 mg/ml) and filter-sterilized for SA.
Rodent Intravenous Catheterization
Rats were fully anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (87.5-100 mg/kg, i.m.) and xylazine hydrochloride (5 mg/kg, i.m.) and then
received an analgesic (Rimadyl, 5 mg/kg, s.c.) and 5 mL of Lactated Ringer’s (s.c.) prior to surgery. Betadine and 70% ethanol were
applied to all incision sites. All rats received a chronic indwelling intravenous (i.v.) catheter as described previously (Rich et al., 2016).
Catheters were implanted into the right jugular vein, then fed subcutaneously to the midscapular region, where they exited through a
round incision. After surgery, rats recovered on a heating pad. Rats were then individually housed and given at least 7 d to recover

 before behavioral training. Rimadyl (5 mg/kg; s.c.) was administered for the first two days after surgery and catheters were kept pat-
ent by daily infusions of sterile saline containing gentamicin (5 mg/ml) and heparin (30 USP/ml).
Virus Delivery and Optic Fiber Implantation
For experiments involving viral infection of MGN neurons, rats were placed in a stereotaxic frame immediately following catheter sur-
gery. They were given a small injection (�0.2-0.3 ml) of lidocaine (Henry Schein) to the scalp as a local anesthetic. A 26-gauge stain-
less steel injection cannula connected to a Hamilton syringe was used to bilaterally inject 1 mL of concentrated AAV solution into the
medial portion of MGN (in mm from bregma, anterior and posterior (AP): –5.4; medial and lateral (ML): ± 3.0; dorsal and ventral
(DV): –6.6) through a pump (Harvard Apparatus) at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min. Cannula were left in place for 5 min after infusions
were complete before being slowly withdrawn. For experiments involving in vivo optogenetic control of MGN-LA terminals, two
200-mm optic fibers (0.5 NA, Thor Labs) were implanted (See Sparta et al., 2011) at the dorsal portion of the lateral amygdala
(in mm from bregma, AP: �3.0; ML: ± 5.1; DV: �7.9 mm). Fibers were lowered at a rate of 2 mm/min, then secured to the skull
with screws, Loctite instant adhesive (Henkel Corp) and OrthoJet dental cement (Lang Dental).
Rodent Cocaine or Saline Self-Administration
Rats were trained to SA cocaine in standard operant conditioning chambers (MedAssociates), as described previously (Rich et al.,
2016). Rats administered saline (0.9%) or cocaine (2 mg/ml) during daily sessions for 1 h, on a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of rein-
forcement with a 10 s timeout. The designated active lever (counterbalanced across left and right levers) produced a cocaine or saline
infusion paired with a 10 s compound light and tone cue. Pump durations were adjusted daily according to body weight in order to
deliver the correct dose of drug (1.0 mg/kg of body weight per infusion). Responses on the other, inactive, lever were recorded, but
had no programmed consequences. Rats underwent training for at least 10 d and until they administered at least 8 infusions per day
over 3 consecutive days. Rats that did not meet acquisition criteria by 20 d were excluded from the study. The program was
controlled by and data were collected using MedPC IV (MedAssociates).
Instrumental Lever Extinction
After successful acquisition of SA, rats underwent IE for 6-10 d. During these daily 1 h sessions, responses on both the active and
inactive levers were recorded but had no programmed consequences. IE continued until extinction criteria had been met (an average
of < 25 lever presses on the last two days of extinction). Throughout IE, rats received no cocaine or cocaine-associated cue reinforce-
ment, thus reducing responses to a stable, low rate. This reduces the motivational value of other cues in the SA context, so that sub-
sequent reinstatement testing or physiological assessment specifically isolates the memory for the discrete cue associated with
cocaine infusion.
Pavlovian Cue Re-Exposure
Cue re-exposure occurred as described previously (Rich et al., 2016). Briefly, rats were returned to the SA context 24 h after the final
day of SA (or IE). During this 1 hr session, levers were unavailable, so responses could not be made. Rats that had undergone cocaine
SA received noncontingent presentations of the previously drug-paired cues: either 0, 3, 60, or 120. A separate group of cocaine-
trained rats were left in their home cages undisturbed as a control for re-exposure to the training context. Saline-trained animals
were returned to the training context and did not undergo cue re-exposure (0 cue presentations). During re-exposure sessions,
the cocaine-associated cue was presented for 10 s, with each presentation separated by 30 s. The timing of cue delivery was
such that each group of animals received their final cue presentation at the end of the session.
Cue-Induced Reinstatement
24 h after cue re-exposure, cue-induced reinstatement was assessed during a 1 h session that took place in the original SA context. A
lever press on the active lever produced a 10 s presentation of the cocaine-associated cue on an FR1 schedule, but no drug rein-
forcement. Lever presses on the inactive lever were recorded but had no programmed consequences. In the optical LTD experiment,
to measure spontaneous recovery of drug-seeking, rats underwent a second cue-induced reinstatement test 7 d later.
Ex vivo Slice Preparation
Slices were prepared as described previously (Huang et al., 2008), with slight modifications, and using methods designed to improve
neuronal health in adult rodents (Ting et al., 2014). Briefly, 24 h after cue re-exposure sessions, rats were deeply anesthetized with
isoflurane. Rats were then briefly perfused with ice-cold cutting solution containing (in mM): 92 N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG),
2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 5 sodium ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 sodium pyruvate, 10 MgSO4, and
0.5 CaCl2, saturated with carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2), pH adjusted to 7.4 with HCl. Rats were then decapitated and brains removed.
Acute coronal slices of the amygdala (250 mm thick) were obtained (normally 4–6 slices were obtained from each rat) using a VT1200S
vibratome (Leica, Weltzar, Germany) in 4 �C cutting solution. Slices were placed in a holding chamber filled with the same cutting
solution, and incubated at 37�C for 10-15 min before being transferred to a beaker of HEPES-based holding solution containing

e3
 (in mM): 86 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 35 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 5 sodium ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 sodium pyruvate,
1 MgCl2, and 2 CaCl2, saturated with carbogen. Slices were allowed to recover for > 30 min at room temperature before
experimentation.
Ex vivo Electrophysiological Recordings
Slices were transferred to an Olympus BX51WI upright microscope equipped with Dodt Gradient Contrast infrared optics. The LA
was identified using a 4X objective and this region was then magnified for identification of neurons with a 40X water immersion
lens. Whole-cell recordings were obtained from individual principal neurons in the LA using glass pipettes (3–5 MU). Principal neurons
were identified by morphology, and in voltage clamp, typically showing low levels of spontaneous activity. For a subset of cells, prin-
cipal neurons could be confirmed in current clamp by injecting current pulses to elicit action potentials, as described elsewhere (Kim
et al., 2007a; See Figure S4A). Voltage-clamp experiments used pipettes filled with a cesium-based internal solution [in mM, cesium
methanesulfonate 108, CsCl 15, CsEGTA 0.4, TEA-Cl 5, HEPES 20, Mg-ATP 2.5, Na-GTP 0.25, QX-314-Cl 1, sodium phosphocre-
atine 7.5, and L-glutathione 1, and pH to 7.3 with CsOH] and current-clamp experiments used pipettes filled with a potassium-based
internal solution [in mM, potassium methanesulfonate 108, KCl 20, K-EGTA 0.4, HEPES 10, Mg-ATP 2.5, Na-GTP 0.25, sodium phos-
phocreatine 7.5, L-glutathione 1, MgCl2 2, and pH to 7.3 with KOH]. During recordings, slices were superfused with aCSF that was
heated to 31–33 �C by passing the solution through a feedback-controlled in-line heater (Warner, CT) before entering the chamber.
External perfusion consisted of a modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), containing, in mM NaCl 119, KCl 2.5, NaHCO3 26,
NaH2PO4 1.2, glucose 12.5, HEPES 5, MgSO4 1, CaCl2 2, saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2. Neurons were voltage-clamped
at �70 mV. For experiments involving electrical stimulation, a concentric bipolar stimulating electrode (FHC, Bowdoin, ME) was
placed over axon fibers emerging from the internal capsule (putative thalamic afferents) or external capsule (putative sensory cortical
afferents). Projections to the LA were stimulated using 0.1 ms pulses at predetermined series of intensities (10-35 mA) using an iso-
lated constant current stimulator (A-M instruments; Digitimer Ltd, Hertfordshire, England), and the evoked excitatory postsynaptic
currents (EPSCs) were recorded. Picrotoxin (100 mM; dissolved in DMSO) was included to inhibit GABAA receptor-mediated currents
in all experiments. For paired pulse delivery, each pulse was separated by a 50 ms interpulse interval. AMPAR currents were elicited
at reversal potential (ERev)-70 mV holding potential and mixed AMPAR+NMDAR currents were elicited at a ERev+40 mV holding po-
tential. NMDAR amplitude was operationally defined as the amplitude of the ERev+40 mV current 35 ms after the peak of the AMPAR
current (ERev-70 mV); at this time point, AMPAR-mediated currents have subsided (Huang et al., 2008, 2009). To elicit action potential
firing, in current-clamp mode, depolarizing current pulses of �100 to +200 pA (20 pA steps, 1 s duration) were delivered.
For experiments involving optical stimulation, AAV-infected MGN projections were identified using fluorescence and then stimu-
lated using a blue light (473-nm) DPSS laser (IkeCool), driven by TTL signals generated using the Clampex software (Molecular
Devices) and a pulse generator (A-M Systems). Collimated laser light was coupled to a fluorescent port of the Olympus BX51WI
microscope, and focused onto the slice through the objective. Optical stimulations of 1 ms duration were used for paired-pulse or
AMPA/NMDA ratio measurements. Neurons receiving inputs from AAV-infected MGN neurons exhibited reliable EPSCs in response
to stimulations (See Figure S4B). Likewise, under current-clamp conditions, AAV-infected MGN neurons generated action potentials
in response to various frequencies of 473-nm-light stimulations (See Figure S4C). Ex vivo LTD experiments were performed in cur-
rent-clamp mode, with the bridge balanced routinely. Optically-evoked EPSPs were recorded at 0.1 Hz for 10 minutes prior to LTD
induction [900 2-ms pulses of 473-nm light, at 1 Hz (15 min induction protocol)]. Following LTD induction, EPSPs were continuously
recorded at 0.1 Hz for the next 60 minutes. For all experiments, series resistance was 10–25 MU, uncompensated, and monitored
continuously during recording. Cells with a change in series resistance beyond 20% were not accepted for data analysis. Synaptic
currents were recorded with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered at 3 kHz, amplified 5 times, and then digitized
at 20 kHz.
In vivo Optogenetic Procedures
Rats were transferred to a clean standard housing cage. Bilateral optic fiber implants were connected to an optic fiber patch cord,
which was connected to a 473-nm blue laser diode (IkeCool) via a rotary joint (Prismatix). The light intensity through the patch cord,
which was measured by a light sensor (S130A; Thor Labs), was adjusted to �5-7 mW. Rats were allowed to explore the environment
for 3 min prior to LTD induction. LTD was induced using the paradigm described above (900 2-ms pulses of 473-nm light delivered at
1 Hz). After induction rats remained in the cage for 3 min, before being placed back in their home cages. Control rats either expressed
the AAV5-tdTomato control virus and received the same stimulation procedure, or expressed oChIEF and had a sham optic fiber
patch cord attached to the head-mounted optic fiber for the same duration as the LTD induction. 24 hours after in vivo optogenetic
stimulations, rats were assessed for drug-seeking in a standard cue-induced reinstatement session (See above).
Staining, Fluorescence, and Imaging
Animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.). Rats were perfused through the aorta with 1X PBS
for 5 min followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS, pH 7.4 for 10 min. The brains were extracted, postfixed in 4% paraformal-
dehyde for 24 h, and transferred to 30% sucrose solution. Brains were sectioned at 50 mm using a cryostat (Leica). Slices containing
the LA or MGN were mounted onto glass slides, and coverslipped with Fluoroshield with DAPI (for nuclear identification)
mounting media (Sigma-Aldrich). Slices were imaged using an Olympus BX61VS epifluorescent slide-scanning microscope to verify

 AAV-oChIEF-tdTomato expression in the MGN and its projections to the LA (See Figure S6). Additionally, position of the optic fiber
over the LA was verified. Rats lacking expression of AAV in MGN or LA and those in which the optic fiber was not correctly positioned
were removed from the study.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPadPrism for Windows and results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Rats were
distributed into groups based on a matching procedure that ensured that each group had no statistical differences in their cocaine
infusions acquired over days, or differences in instrumental extinction behavior. For behavioral experiments, reinstatement tests
were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with repeated-measures, with the within-subjects factor being responding on the last day of
instrumental extinction versus reinstatement responding and the between-subjects factor being cue re-exposure condition. For elec-
trophysiological experiments, data were coded such that experimenters were not aware of treatment groups when performing data
analysis, and then decoded for final results. It was not always possible for experimenters to be blind to condition during electrophys-
iology recordings, but a standard protocol was used for all recording sessions. Data were analyzed offline using ClampFit 10.3. For
experiments in which the end points were from individual cells, such as EPSCs, we used the averaged value of a parameter from all
cells recorded from an animal to represent the parameter of this animal. For electrical stimulation experiments EPSC amplitude was
calculated at each stimulation intensity and compared between groups using two-way ANOVA with repeated-measures, with the
within-subjects factor being stimulation intensity and the between-subjects factor being cue re-exposure condition. For correlation
analyses, Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated, with number of infusions as the independent variable and EPSC ampli-
tude as the dependent variable. Paired pulse ratio (PPR) was calculated as the ratio of the peak current of the second EPSC to the first
EPSC. AMPAR current was calculated as the peak current at Erev �70mV and NMDAR current was calculated as the peak current at
Erev+40 mV, 35 ms after peak AMPAR current. For AMPA, NMDA, and PPR, comparisons were made using one-way ANOVA. All data
points were an average of 10 trials. For optical stimulation experiments, EPSC amplitude, PPR, and AMPA:NMDA ratios were calcu-
lated as described above and compared using one-way ANOVA or unpaired t test. For LTD experiments, peak EPSP amplitude and
EPSP rise slope were calculated for every trial and six consecutive trials were averaged together for each data point. For comparisons
of pre- and post-LTD comparisons, data points across the last 7 minutes of baseline were compared to the last 7 minutes of post-LTD
recordings with a paired t test. Each experiment was replicated in at least 5-6 rats (1-5 cells were recorded from each rat) for elec-
trophysiological analysis and at least 6 rats for behavioral tests. For all analyses, significant effects were further analyzed by Tukey’s
or Bonferroni’s post hoc tests, with significance set at p < 0.05. All data were determined to be normally distributed using the Shapiro-
Wilk test, and Bartlett’s test was used to determine that there were no significant differences in the estimated variance between
groups. Statistical parameters for each analysis can be found in the corresponding figure legends.
