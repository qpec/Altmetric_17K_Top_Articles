Clinical chronobiology: a timely
consideration in critical care medicine
Helen McKenna1, Gijsbertus T. J. van der Horst2, Irwin Reiss3 and Daniel Martin1,3,4*
Abstract
A fundamental aspect of human physiology is its cyclical nature over a 24-h period, a feature conserved across most life on
Earth. Organisms compartmentalise processes with respect to time in order to promote survival, in a manner that mirrors
the rotation of the planet and accompanying diurnal cycles of light and darkness. The influence of circadian rhythms can
no longer be overlooked in clinical settings; this review provides intensivists with an up-to-date understanding of the
burgeoning field of chronobiology, and suggests ways to incorporate these concepts into daily practice to improve patient
outcomes. We outline the function of molecular clocks in remote tissues, which adjust cellular and global physiological
function according to the time of day, and the potential clinical advantages to keeping in time with them. We highlight
the consequences of “chronopathology”, when this harmony is lost, and the risk factors for this condition in critically ill
patients. We introduce the concept of “chronofitness” as a new target in the treatment of critical illness: preserving the
internal synchronisation of clocks in different tissues, as well as external synchronisation with the environment. We describe
methods for monitoring circadian rhythms in a clinical setting, and how this technology may be used for identifying
optimal time windows for interventions, or to alert the physician to a critical deterioration of circadian rhythmicity. We
suggest a chronobiological approach to critical illness, involving multicomponent strategies to promote chronofitness
(chronobundles), and further investment in the development of personalised, time-based treatment for critically ill patients.

Background
Critical care medicine aims to maintain homeostasis in
patients undergoing extreme physiological stress, for which
they are no longer able to compensate. To this end, we
strive to maintain physiological measures within parameters
that we hope will promote optimal cell function and lead to
survival; refining our targets as new evidence emerges.
However, one fundamental facet of life has failed to form
part of our concept of a patient’s well-being: the innate
rhythmicity of their biological functions. We are all instinct-
ively aware of the diurnal nature of our own behaviour
throughout a 24-h period. We recognise the physical and
mental affliction associated with its disturbance (e.g. jet lag
and night shift work), but we give little consideration to the
impact of these rhythms on the patients we treat. Most
biological mechanisms fluctuate according to a circadian
rhythm. The conservation of circadian rhythms across
species points towards the survival advantage they convey,
including: preparing an organism for daily recurring, and
thus predictable, demands, such as the cyclical environ-
mental changes in light, temperature and food availability
imposed by the day–night cycle; and temporally segregating
conflicting processes, such as feeding and physical activity,
or sleeping and waking. The study of these cyclical
phenomena, known as chronobiology, is growing in
prominence throughout diverse disciplines, as their
pervasive nature becomes apparent. During the extreme
stress of critical illness, patients are particularly vulnerable
from further impairment of cell function resulting from
circadian rhythm disturbance. Critical care traditionally
focuses on the “normalisation” of physiological indices,
despite a limited evidence base [1, 2], but preservation of
circadian physiology is not part of clinical practice. It is
possible that neglecting the influence of circadian rhyth-
micity could contribute to the apparent lack of benefit

 from the majority of critical care targets tested in ran-
domised controlled trials. In this review we introduce
the basics of clinical chronobiology and propose the
potential value to be gained from clinicians applying these
new concepts to their daily practice. We propose that
promotion of healthy circadian rhythms may constitute a
future target for critical care medicine.
The molecular networking of circadian rhythms
Our planet rotates through 360° every 24 h, creating an
inescapable oscillation between light and darkness. Most life
on Earth evolved under the influence of this day–night
cycle, leading to the parallel oscillation of behaviour, physi-
ology and metabolism throughout the 24-h period (diurnal
rhythms). These rhythms are generated by cell-intrinsic
molecular clocks with a periodicity of approximately (circa)
24 h (diem), for which reason they are called “circadian”
clocks. Temporal compartmentalisation of functions
according to predictable daily fluctuations in the environ-
ment has been vital to the survival of even the most primi-
tive organisms, such as the single-celled Synechococcus
cyanobacterium, which separates its two fundamental meta-
bolic processes (photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation) by
time rather than place [3]. In complex organisms such as
humans, every cell has its own circadian clock. The cellular
circadian rhythm is generated via a molecular network of
transcriptional–translational feedback loops, with one cycle
taking approximately 24 h to complete [4]. In short, the
Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK) and
Brain And Muscle ARNT-Like 1 (BMAL1) genes encode a
heterodimeric transcription factor known as CLOCK/
BMAL1 that activates E-box promoter containing genes,
including the Period (PER1 and PER2) and Cryptochrome
(CRY1 and CRY2) core clock genes and a variety of clock-
controlled genes (CCG) that couple the circadian oscil-
lator to physiological and metabolic pathways. Once
formed, PER/CRY protein complexes translocate to the
nucleus where they inhibit CLOCK/BMAL1-mediated
transcription of E-box genes, including their own [5].
Between 5 and 20% of all gene transcription in mammalian
cells is controlled by this molecular oscillator depending
on tissue type [6]. The oscillating transcriptome directly
influences most biological pathways, ultimately shaping
measurable indices such as body temperature, brain
wave activity, cardiovascular and respiratory functions,
coagulation and immunity [7].
Keeping time
Coordination of mammalian circadian timekeeping involves
an integrated system composed of a central clock in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, and
peripheral clocks in virtually all other cells and tissues. The
coordinated integration of central and peripheral molecular
clocks ensures that functions in different tissues occur at an
appropriate time of day, such as sleeping at night and meta-
bolising ingested nutrients during the day in the case of
diurnal animals. Without these molecular clocks, there
would be no temporal framework for daily processes.
Although circadian clocks continue to tick indefinitely,
they require careful adjusting to keep in time. The central
clock in the SCN fulfils a key role in this, as it integrates in-
put from external cues, known as Zeitgebers, to synchronise
with the planetary light/dark cycle. Whereas light, perceived
through the eye, is the strongest Zeitgeber for daily clock re-
setting (photoentrainment), other cues include temperature,
feeding, exercise and social interaction. In turn, the SCN
maintains synchrony of peripheral clocks through humoral
and neural stimuli. Resetting the circadian clocks to alter-
ations in Zeitgebers scheduling takes time [8] and sudden
environmental changes result in cellular rhythms being
temporarily out of step with demands imposed by the
environment (external desynchronisation). This phase
shift is experienced as jet lag when we rapidly cross
longitudes and it takes approximately 1 day to adapt to
each hour time zone crossed. Clocks in different tissues
adapt to disturbance at different rates, leading to internal
desynchrony, like the individual instruments of an orchestra
playing independently [9]. The hormone melatonin appears
to play a role in both external and internal synchronisation.
Its secretion from the pineal gland is inhibited by bright
light (detected by non-visual photosensitive retinal ganglion
cells), hence circulating melatonin levels are very low
during the day [10]. Melatonin was previously thought
to regulate the sleep/wake cycle, but its secretion
follows a similar pattern in nocturnally active animals
(i.e. increasing melatonin levels at the beginning of the
dark period) and may be more accurately considered
the “hormone of the dark”.
Chronotypes
Whilst most humans follow a pattern of daytime wake-
fulness and night-time sleeping, there is natural variation
in preferred time to wake and sleep. Chronotype is the
behavioural expression of the set point of an individual’s
circadian rhythm. It describes their sleep–wake cycle in
relation to time, and the two ends of the chronotype
spectrum are called “morningness” and “eveningness”.
Morningness is characterised by early-morning waking,
with mental and physical performance peaking in the
first half of the day, and going to sleep relatively early;
eveningness is the opposite. Chronotype can be determined
by questionnaires such as the Munich Chronotype Ques-
tionnaire and the Horne–Ostberg Morningness–Evening-
ness Score [11]. A comprehensive and well-controlled study
demonstrated that questionnaires such as these closely cor-
relate to dim-light melatonin onset time, probably the most
reliable measure of central circadian timing in humans [12].
There is a strong genetic component underlying this

 phenotype [13] and ignoring its influence is known to
be detrimental to performance [14]. The eveningness
chronotype has been associated with a predisposition to
diabetes, metabolic syndrome, high body mass index
and sarcopenia, as well as depressive disorders [15–17].
Knowledge of a patient’s chronotype may be useful not
just in the assessment of disease risk, but also in tailoring
the timing of Zeitgebers such as light, food, exercise and
sleep in order to preserve their natural circadian rhythm
and optimise their biological function.
Chronopathology
Circadian rhythm disruption can be genetic or acquired,
and its impact extends far beyond the fleeting symptoms
of jet lag (Table 1), reflecting the range of functions
which follow a circadian rhythm. Chronic circadian rhythm
disruption has been linked with diverse pathologies, from
metabolic disorders, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular dis-
ease and cancer [18–21]. Genetic disruption results from
mutations of the clock genes responsible for generating
the cellular circadian rhythm. Such mutations result in
a spectrum of sleep pattern disorders [22]. Given that
clock genes regulate cell proliferation, metabolism,
DNA repair and apoptosis, it is of no surprise that poly-
morphisms in these genes (including PER1 and PER2)
have been associated with cancer in both mouse models
and humans [23]. CLOCK gene mutations have been
implicated in the development of obesity in humans
and may play a key role in metabolic syndrome, type 2
diabetes and cardiovascular disease [24, 25]. Alterations
within clock genes are also related to alcohol consumption
[26] and recreational drug rewarding in animal models
[27], indicating the far-reaching consequences of disruption
to this fundamental regulatory system.
Environmental clock disruption
Living out of phase with one’s body clock will also induce
circadian dysrhythmia, and has also been shown to result
in pathology [28]. Night shifts create a complete inversion
of the sleep–wake cycle, analogous to travelling across 12
time zones. Night shift workers have been found to have
higher rates of a number of behavioural and health-related
morbidities [29] including sleep disorders, obesity [30],
metabolic syndrome [31] and cancer [32, 33]. Sleep
restriction also disrupts the circadian rhythm and has a
profound effect on metabolic control in healthy volunteer
subjects [34]. We are currently facing an epidemic of
environmental circadian rhythm disturbance, as modern
work and social schedules forces people to live contrary to
their chronotype (social jet lag) [35].
Circadian dysrhythmia in critically ill patients
Critically ill patients are particularly susceptible to circadian
disruption (dysrhythmia) due to mistiming, or total loss, of
sensory cues disturbing the master regulation within the
environment of the intensive care unit, and/or pathology
affecting the peripheral clock mechanism at a cellular level.
The latter phenomenon is imperfectly understood, but may
relate to the inflammatory response, with septic patients
seen to have abnormal patterns of melatonin secretion
relative to non-septic ventilated patients [36]. The cellular
effect outlasts the septic insult, with animal models of
sepsis demonstrating rhythm disturbances for weeks after
the insult [37], findings mirrored in human survivors of
sepsis even after discharge from the intensive care unit.
Rhythmicity can be affected in different ways, leading to a
loss of amplitude, asynchronous timing or degradation to
a completely chaotic pattern [38]. The clinical conse-
quences of this aspect of critical illness are thought to be
manifold but may have been neglected in the past due to
the more obvious and immediately life-threatening fea-
tures of physiological instability. The two most obvious
manifestations of circadian dysrhythmia on the intensive
care unit are the two complex and interrelated phenomena
of sleep disturbance and delirium (Fig. 1). Sleep disruption

 is one of the commonest afflictions reported by survivors
of critical illness [39]. It manifests as fragmentation and
disruption of sleep architecture [40], and a displacement of
the greater proportion of sleep to the daytime [41].
Disturbed sleep is not only a manifestation of circadian
dysthymia, but also a driver of further disarray in peripheral
clocks [42], creating a vicious circle of disruption. Of the
many downstream effects of sleep disruption, its impair-
ment of the immune system has the most obvious ramifica-
tions for recovery from critical illness [43]. Evidence is also
emerging that ICU delirium, a syndrome independently
associated with increased mortality and long-term mor-
bidity from critical illness [44], and affecting up to 80%
of critically ill patients [45], is a clinical manifestation of
circadian dysrhythmia (Fig. 1). Delirium is associated with a
reduction in peak amplitude of a urinary metabolite of
melatonin (6-sulfatoxymelatonin) [46]. Circadian disruption
and sleep disturbance often precedes delirium, this temporal
link suggesting a possible causal relationship [47].
Many of the effects of critical illness circadian dysrhyth-
mia may not be detectable clinically, but the diverse
ramifications we see in chronic circadian dysrhythmia,
outlined earlier, highlight the degree to which cellular
function in different tissues is affected, beyond the overt
symptoms of sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment.
For example, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
itself exhibits circadian oscillation [48, 49], disruption of
which may result in mismatching of cellular energetics to
demand. In patients with sepsis where cellular bioener-
getic failure is already threatened [50] and drugs such as
propofol suppress mitochondrial respiration [51], such a
discrepancy may be catastrophic for cell function. We
propose that “chronofitness”, the correct alignment of
peripheral and central clocks, should be a new target in
the management of critical illness. The first step will be to
identify and address the modifiable risk factors associated
with the disruption of circadian rhythms in critically ill
patients (Table 2), and implement strategies to prevent
such disruption. Here we outline the rationale and
evidence for a number of chronobiological strategies to
improve outcome in critically ill patients.
The intensive care unit environment
Inside the intensive care unit, the usual schedule of
Zeitgebers is obliterated. In the outside world, the variation
between light and darkness ranges from 0.0001 lx on a
moonless night to 0.25 lx during a full moon, 1000 lx on
the most overcast day and 130,000 lx in brightest sunshine.
At night, artificial light leaches into patient areas from
many sources – room and corridor lights, the glare from
monitors and torches used to measure pupil size (leading
to mean night-time illumination of 10 lx in one study
[52]) – whilst during the day indoor illumination rarely
reaches that of the outside world even on an overcast
day (mean daytime illumination 158 lx [52]). Excessive
night-time light suppresses the release of melatonin, a key
molecule orchestrating circadian rhythmicity in different
tissues [53], and circadian disruption can be seen at a
cellular level when cells are exposed to constant light [54].
Animal models of critical illness have demonstrated worse
outcomes in the presence of circadian disturbance
experimentally induced by constant exposure to light
[55]. Imposing a light/dark cycle in a neonatal ICU
accelerated body weight gain and shortened time to
discharge in preterm infants [56]. “Chronofriendly” ICUs
should aim to emulate normal day-time illumination levels
with large windows, sufficient artificial lighting and
perhaps incorporating blue-enhanced lighting in refurbish-
ments and new builds [57]. A recent review summarised a
number of randomised controlled trials in which morning
bright-light therapy reduced delirium or improved sleep in
acutely ill patients [58]. In a study published after this
review, light therapy did not reduce the incidence of
delirium in the critically ill and it is possible that it was
less effective during early critical illness when patients
were heavily sedated [59]. At night, providing sufficient
light to perform critical tasks safely must be balanced
against the negative effects of interruption of the patient’s
light/dark cycle. Where possible, night light should be
minimised or the patient’s eyes protected using eye masks.
The use of lights and monitors that emit red rather than
blue light at night may blunt inhibition of melatonin

 secretion [60]. Standards for morning light intensity during
the day and night using luxmeters could be initiated.
Excessive night-time noise leads to sleep deprivation
[61]. Noise reduction can be achieved by staff behaviour
modification and the use of ear plugs in patients; the latter
showing promising signs of being able to reduce ICU
delirium [61]. Measurement of sound levels on ICU may
help staff to understand which aspects of patient care
create the most noise and facilitate the development of
local guidelines to help minimise environmental noise
pollution [62]. Other disturbances such as automated
non-invasive blood pressure measurement, physical
examination, turning and washing should be rationalised
and cohorted at night, which as part of a bundle of
interventions has been shown to improve sleep in the
critically ill [63].
Feeding
The consumption of food is probably the most powerful
Zeitgeber for peripheral clocks. Most mammals do not
eat at night and enter a period of natural fasting, during
which time they switch from using primarily glucose as
a fuel source to ketone bodies [64]. Yet it remains common
practice to feed critically ill adults continuously, whether
via the enteral or parenteral route. Time-restricted feeding
is a well-described intervention that has a profound effect
on the circadian rhythm and may be a powerful tool in the
prevention of metabolic disorders [65, 66]. Much of the
benefit seen in animal models exploring this line of work
appears to relate to the maintenance or entrainment of the
circadian rhythm [67]. Numerous animal model studies
have demonstrated that changes to normal feeding sched-
ules have
significant
metabolic
consequences
[68],
including reduction in the amplitude and an alteration
of phase in hepatic metabolite levels [69]. Daytime
feeding in nocturnally active mice shifted the liver clock
by 180° and resulted in significantly decreased survival
rates in a sepsis model, in comparison to mice fed at
night [70]. Eating out of phase with the SCN rhythm
destroys the normal relationship between this central
timekeeper and the peripheral clocks, and the resulting
conflict manifests as gastrointestinal and metabolic
disease [71]. This has been proposed as a mechanism for
the increased incidence of obesity and metabolic disorders
in shift workers [72]. A further interesting twist is the bi-
directional circadian relationship between the gut micro-
biome and its host [73], with the circadian rhythm of one
influencing the other. Whilst studies have been undertaken
to look at outcome differences between bolus versus con-
tinuous feeding in subsets of critically ill patients [74, 75],
they did not consider circadian factors in their design. A
recent and eloquent personal perspective on this topic by
Paul Marik [76] highlighted that providing continuous pro-
tein or amino acid supplementation limits skeletal muscle
protein synthesis whilst intermittent feeding promotes
it. His article concludes by stating: “Continuous tube
feeding is unphysiological and likely harmful and should
be abandoned” [76].
Physical activity
Loss of daytime physical activity may be absolute in
severe critical illness, as the result of sedation, paralysis,
muscle weakness or critical illness polyneuropathy or
myopathy. Posture on the ICU is predominantly supine,
rather than upright, for much of the day. There is a
chronobiological argument for incorporating early basic
patient mobilisation, even passively, through physiotherapy,
at the times relevant to that patient. Some have suggested
that early mobilisation may contribute to circadian health,
and early mobilisation has been suggested as being an
essential component of any strategy to reduce delirium
in the critically ill [77]. Individual chronotyping (through
questioning relatives) may be especially valuable here;
perhaps increases in compliance with valuable physio-
therapy could be achieved in awake patients, by targeting
their morningness or eveningness.
Sedation
Sedatives can be a necessary evil in critical care medi-
cine, but their side-effect profile may extend beyond our
current awareness [78]. Administration of sedatives to
the critically ill worsens sleep patterns and delirium, and
drives circadian dysrhythmia [79, 80], with desynchron-
isation of the rhythmical secretion of melatonin demon-
strated in sedated, mechanically ventilated patients [81].
Benzodiazepines appear to be the greatest offenders in
this group [81, 82]. When possible, minimising the use
of sedative drugs is likely to be beneficial for critically
patients [78], and will require the optimisation of analgesia.
In particular, it is advisable to avoid the knee-jerk reaction
to treat sleep disturbance with sedative medications, which
do not provide the active biological functions of sleep, and
exacerbate sleep disturbance and delirium in the critically ill.
Implementing an integrated “chronobundle” to
entrain faltering circadian rhythms in the critically ill
There is a biological rationale for keeping Zeitgeibers at
their “expected” time to minimise harm from desynchron-
isation of peripheral and central clocks (Fig. 2). On the
basis of the mechanisms and evidence from human and
animal studies outlined, we propose a “chronobundle” to
promote chronofitness as part of daily management of
critically ill patients, summarised in Fig. 2. There is
evidence that interventions may have greater benefit in
combination, with a systematic review of multicomponent
strategies based on environmental modifications demon-
strating decreases in delirium incidence (odds ratio 0.47)
[83]. Some chronobundle elements used to improve sleep
McKenna et al. Critical Care  (2018) 22:124 
Page 5 of 10
 in critically ill patients such as the use of ear plugs and eye
masks have demonstrated benefit [84] and influenced
circulating melatonin levels in a simulated critical care
setting [85]. Individualising Zeitgeber timing according to
a patient’s chronotype may further improve the impact of
such interventions. This chronotype-specific approach has
been explored as a performance enhancing tactic in both
athletes [14] and college students [86]. Information
regarding chronotype could be sought from close relatives
and friends, and questionnaires exist to quantify responses
from specific questions [11].
Current challenges and future perspectives on the
monitoring of circadian rhythms in the ICU
The volume of literature devoted to understanding the
impact of circadian disruption on critically ill patients is
small. In a setting in which heterogeneity of disease and
treatments is sizable, linking cause with effect is challen-
ging. Unless a patient’s circadian rhythm is accurately
determined, it is impossible to determine how it may
influence clinical outcomes. Currently, this is not pos-
sible outside the setting of complex research projects.
Improving chronofitness in critically ill patients will
require the ability to monitor circadian rhythms in the
clinical setting. Measuring circadian rhythms, in real
time and in different tissues, will be essential for identi-
fication of circadian dysrhythmias and for assessing the
effect of interventions to improve clock alignment. As
every physiological function has a circadian oscillation,
each proffers a potential biomarker for tracking rhyth-
micity. In healthy volunteers and ambulatory patients,
circadian rhythms can be mapped using activity monitors
[87]. However, this has been shown to overestimate sleep
time compared to polysomnography in the critically ill
[88], presumably as actigraphy is unable to distinguish
between true sleep and motionless wakefulness. It is usual
to collect hourly physiological information from critically
ill patients and the use of electronic data systems allows

 greater recording frequency of measurement variables
providing a rich dataset of biorhythms. Although clinicians
appreciate the importance of trends over time, we lack
the terminology for describing or quantifying biological
rhythms, or changes in their characteristics. Clinicians
need to become more familiar with normal patterns of
circadian oscillation in key physiological functions (e.g.
the nadir of temperature, blood pressure and heart rate
in the early hours of the morning), and to develop pattern
recognition strategies to identify critical circadian disrup-
tion, similar to the manner in which we identify a rhythm
disturbance in an electrocardiogram. A more sophisticated
approach would require quantitative analysis of rhythms,
perhaps via software able to process real-time physio-
logical data, to identify: timing of peaks (or troughs)
enabling phase shift determination; amplitude of variation,
from peak to trough; and the consistency of the rhythm
over days. Techniques to achieve this are commonly used
in the experimental setting [89], but have yet to transfer
across to clinical practice. Medical education in the future
may need to provide clinicians with the mathematical
competence to handle more complex data relating to
biological rhythms, or to use algorithms for their inter-
pretation. Attempts have been made to plot circadian
rhythms using biomarkers including serum melatonin
[90] and cortisol levels [91], urinary melatonin metabolites
[36, 81], sleep–wake cycles using polysomnography [41]
and hourly temperature and urine outputs [92]. A multi-
tude of hormones related to metabolism levels are under
circadian control such as insulin, ghrelin, leptin and
growth hormone [93, 94]; these too could be used to help
determine circadian profiles in the critically ill in a study
setting [95]. Finding the optimum tool to monitor
critically ill patients therefore remains a key to research
progress in this area.
Chronotherapeutics: delivering the right
treatment at the right time
The ability to map an individual’s circadian rhythm
conveys the potential ability to personalise critical care.
For example, given the typical fluctuations of physiological
variables throughout the 24-h period in health, we could
evaluate the benefit of different physiological targets for
day and night.
Monitoring circadian rhythms will be essential for the
implementation of “chronotherapeutics”, the timing of
an intervention or administration of a drug at the time
of day where it is likely to have the optimum effect.
Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics show that
predictable circadian oscillations manner [96, 97]. Whilst
we tend to prescribe certain drugs at certain times of the
day, it is generally without consideration of how each
drug’s therapeutic profile may be affected by the time of
day. Absorption, hepatic metabolism and renal excretion
all follow a circadian rhythm [97], as do the biological
processes on which drugs act. Chronotherapeutic strategies
have proved beneficial in cancer treatment [98] where
circadian-timed chemotherapy may improve outcomes.
Optimising the timing of drugs with a narrow therapeutic
index and significant circadian fluctuation, such as antibi-
otics, steroids and anticoagulants, could lead to significant
clinical benefit from improvements in efficacy and mini-
misation of toxicity [97, 99]. Benzodiazepines phase-shift
the clock according to the time of day at which they are
administered [100], and thus the circadian disruption effect
could be minimised by administering the drug at the
correct time of day relative to the patient’s circadian phase.
Our defence from trauma and its accompanying stress
response is also dependent on the time of day. Recently, it
was reported that elective cardiac operations performed in
the afternoon were associated with improved patient
outcomes, which the authors related to changes in the
oscillating gene expression of the nuclear receptor
Rev-Erbα [101]. The time-of-day factor has also been
implicated in the efficacy of wound healing in patients,
with burn injuries incurred during the day healing up
to 60% faster than those sustained at night, which may
be explained by temporal patterns of fibroblast activity
in a mouse model [102].
These preliminary data point towards the improvements
in outcome that may be achieved by greater understanding
of the temporal nature of healing responses, and highlight
the need to develop a comprehensive temporal blueprint
for different tissue rhythms to allow clinicians to plan
interventions to take advantage of the predictable cycling
of human immune and healing responses. Such a blueprint
will have to take account of differing chronotypes.
Pharmacological adjustment of circadian dysrhythmia
Melatonin is thought to align the phases of peripheral
clocks in different tissues with that of the central SCN
[103]. In humans, melatonin is released from the pineal
gland, beginning from 2100 to 2300 h, peaking between
0100 and 0300 h, and reaching its nadir between 0700
and 0900 h (virtually a mirror image of cortisol release).
Taken enterally, melatonin improves the quality of sleep
[104], and there is some evidence for its effectiveness in
treating jet lag [105]. A number of randomised controlled
trials have investigated melatonin and melatonin receptor
antagonists in critically ill patients [106]. They have
shown initial success in improving sleep quality and
reducing delirium in some subsets of critically ill patients
[107–110]. However, no large-scale randomised controlled
trials have been conducted in this area and this is clearly a
priority area for future research.
In the future we may be able to target the molecular
clockwork itself with pharmacological agents. Synthetic
ligands are currently under investigation for Rev-Erb

 (α and β) and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan recep-
tors [111]. They have a particular potential for the treatment
of metabolic syndrome [112], but as this field advances the
scope of synthetic ligands may widen to include more fields
of medicine, including critical care.
Conclusions
Circadian rhythms are currently low on the list of physio-
logical priorities during ICU ward rounds. We have argued
that recognition of the influence of this universally import-
ant system, and adoption of chronobiological strategies, has
the potential to improve patient outcomes [38]. Circadian
rhythmicity represents one of the oldest survival strategies,
present in all life-forms on earth. Traditional treatment
of critical illness ignores this fundamental physiological
function, with many of our interventions inadvertently
obliterating it. A new chronobiological approach to
patient care would involve: education for clinical staff,
regarding the recognition of circadian rhythms and
dysrhythmias; development of technology to measure
circadian rhythms quantitatively in critically ill patients; and
investing in multicomponent strategies (chronobundles) to
preserve or restore the synchronicity, phase and amplitude
of circadian rhythms. For the latter, pharmacological
solutions remain untested, but the non-pharmacological
components of these bundles are simple and logical
interventions of relatively low cost. Any chronotherapy
will ultimately need to take account of time of day and
individual patient chronotype.
