 There is no doubt that antipsychotic treatment is valuable in
acute psychotic episodes. There is also considerable evidence that
antipsychotics are useful for those with continuing positive
psychotic symptoms. Indeed, the introduction of antipsychotics
in the 1950s is credited with having contributed to the return to
the community of many previously chronically ill patients from
asylums, and the running down and eventual abolition of these
institutions.1
However, a new era was ushered in by Leff & Wing in 1971
when they reported an randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the
prophylactic value of antipsychotics in preventing the relapse of
people with schizophrenia.2 Subsequently, many other RCTs
confirmed that relapse was less common in those who continued
treatment with antipsychotics. Although most of these trials
lasted for less than 1 year,3 it became common practice for those
who had received a diagnosis of schizophrenia to remain on
antipsychotics for many years.
However, increasing doubts have been raised about the
long-term prophylactic use of antipsychotics.4 As with any drug
treatment, the beneficial effects have to be balanced against the
potential side-effects. This paper will therefore address five
troublesome issues: (a) effects of antipsychotics on physical
health, (b) effects of antipsychotics on brain structure, (c) efficacy
of
long-term
antipsychotic
use,
(d)
antipsychotic-induced
dopamine receptor supersensitivity, and (e) treatment-resistant
schizophrenia (TRS).
Physical health
People with schizophrenia die earlier than the rest of the
population.5,6 Studies from several countries show that the trend
of mortality rates in people with psychosis has not followed the
same downward course as that of the general population, resulting
in a widening disparity.7–10
Suicide accounts for part of the excess mortality, although the
most obvious remediable cause is the excessive use of tobacco;
illicit drug use, poor diet and lack of exercise are also implicated.
However, the possibility that antipsychotics also contribute has
attracted much attention recently. Antipsychotics can cause
cardiac arrhythmias11,12 and induce dyslipidaemia and obesity,
with activation of the cascade towards insulin resistance and
diabetes.13–15
Most
second-generation
antipsychotics
(SGAs)
confer a higher cardiometabolic risk than first-generation anti-
psychotics (FGAs), and some authors point out that the switch
to SGAs from the mid-1990s has paralleled the widening of the
mortality gap.8
However, there is still dispute over whether long-term anti-
psychotic prescription actually increases overall mortality. For
example, data from Swedish nationwide registers show a lower
mortality in patients with chronic schizophrenia receiving long-
term antipsychotics than in those with similar duration of illness
but no antipsychotic exposure.16 It could be that antipsychotics
reduce suicides or facilitate better self-care – or simply, as Mace
et al17 suggest, that taking antipsychotics ‘may be a surrogate
marker for overall healthy behaviour’.
Implications
In spite of the above controversy, there is enough evidence
concerning the adverse effects of antipsychotics on physical health
to compel psychiatrists to act. There are three obvious ways to
address the risk. First, to prescribe, wherever possible, anti-
psychotics with a lower propensity to induce weight gain. Second,
to facilitate a healthy diet and lifestyle from the start of treatment.
Third, to reduce the use, or at least the dosage, of long-term
antipsychotics. In implementing this last strategy, one must, of
course, consider the possible impact on the mental health of each
patient.

Summary
Patients who recover from an acute episode of psychosis are
frequently prescribed prophylactic antipsychotics for many
years, especially if they are diagnosed as having
schizophrenia. However, there is a dearth of evidence
concerning the long-term effectiveness of this practice, and
growing concern over the cumulative effects of
antipsychotics on physical health and brain structure.
Although controversy remains concerning some of the
data, the wise psychiatrist should regularly review the
benefit to each patient of continuing prophylactic
antipsychotics against the risk of side-effects and loss of
effectiveness through the development of supersensitivity of
the dopamine D2 receptor. Psychiatrists should work with
their patients to slowly reduce the antipsychotic to the
lowest dose that prevents the return of distressing
symptoms. Up to 40% of those whose psychosis remits after
a first episode should be able to achieve a good outcome in
the long term either with no antipsychotic medication or with
a very low dose.

Analysis
 Structural brain changes
Many people with schizophrenia show subtle developmental brain
abnormalities at the onset of their illness.18 However, further brain
changes occur in the years following the onset of the illness. These
were interpreted initially as reflecting an intrinsic degenerative
schizophrenic process.19 However, a number of reports have
concluded that the majority, if not all, of these brain changes
are a consequence of environmental factors; among these factors
are antipsychotic medication,20–23 illicit drug use,24 cigarette
smoking,25 obesity and diabetes.26 Animal studies have confirmed
the effects of antipsychotics in decreasing cortical volume and
have shown, at least in monkeys and rats, that the changes are
not due to a loss of neurons.27–29
Implications
Long-term use of high-dose FGAs does carry a risk of decreasing
cortical volume and increasing ventricular volume; low-dose anti-
psychotics and SGAs may carry less risk.30 These effects appear to
be reversible on stopping antipsychotics.31,32 Some preclinical
behavioural studies have suggested that chronic administration
of antipsychotics can impair memory-related task performance,
as well as spatial and working memory.33,34 Although the changes
in grey matter observed in schizophrenia are correlated with
deficits in cognitive domains, the latter have not been specifically
linked to antipsychotics.35
In short, there is still no clear link between the antipsychotic-
associated changes seen with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and cognitive decline or functional impairment. Therefore, until
more research evidence is available, the jury remains out on what,
if anything, we should do about the effects of antipsychotics on
brain structure.
Do antipsychotics improve long-term outcomes?
Many RCTs have compared outcomes in those patients with
schizophrenia continuing antipsychotics with those in whom the
drugs were stopped. These ‘discontinuation’ studies uniformly
show a greater likelihood of relapse in the latter group.36 Thus,
a meta-analysis of 65 trials3 concluded that ‘antipsychotic
maintenance treatment substantially reduces relapse risk in all
patients with schizophrenia for up to 2 years of follow-up’.
However, few studies have lasted longer than this, leading Leucht
et al to point out that ‘nothing is known about the very long-term
effects of antipsychotic drugs compared to placebo’.37 Thus, long-
term ‘maintenance’ treatment with antipsychotics is based on
hope rather than evidence.
New studies have shed light on this issue. Harrow38 repeatedly
assessed the course of 70 young patients diagnosed with schizo-
phrenia. Those 15 not prescribed antipsychotics over the 20 years
showed significantly fewer psychotic symptoms than those 25
continuously on antipsychotics. Moilanen and colleagues,39 who
followed up 74 patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) in
Finland, reported that after 10 years, the 24 not receiving
medication had better clinical outcomes than those receiving anti-
psychotics. At the ten-year follow-up of 274 FEP patients in the
UK ÆSOP sample,40 Morgan (personal communication, 2016)
found that 18% of those who received a diagnosis of schizophrenia
had not taken antipsychotics for two years and had no psychotic
symptoms. Similarly, Wils & Nordentoft (unpublished, further
details available from M.N. on request) followed up 496 patients
from the Danish OPUS study for 10 years after their first episode
of schizophrenia spectrum disorder; 30% had remission of
psychotic symptoms and were not taking antipsychotics.
There is a major confounder in all these studies, in that they
were without randomisation. Consequently, those patients who
were able to stop their medication may have had a milder
illness than those who continued. Nevertheless, these studies
demonstrate that a significant proportion of patients with
psychosis manage to come off antipsychotic medication without
detriment in the long term.
In a study less open to bias, Wunderink and colleagues selected
a group of FEP patients who had been initially treated successfully
with antipsychotics. After 6 months of remission, they were
randomised for 18 months to either (a) an approach encouraging
antipsychotic dose reduction or discontinuation; or (b) standard
maintenance treatment: 18 months later, as expected, twice as
many people had experienced a relapse in the reduction/
discontinuation group as in the maintenance group.41 However,
by 7 years, the group who had been initially helped to reduce or
discontinue their antipsychotics were reported to show twice the
recovery rate of the maintenance patients.42
Implications
Naturalistic studies indicate that a significant minority of patients
diagnosed as having psychosis and indeed schizophrenia can come
off their antipsychotics without detriment in the long term.
Wunderink and colleagues suggest that we can go further and
try to help a larger proportion of patients to decrease or
discontinue their antipsychotics. However, theirs was a small
study, and it is important to emphasise that at 7 years, only
21% of patients in the dose reduction/discontinuation group
had
actually
stopped
their
antipsychotics,
while
a
similar
proportion had taken a mean daily dose of less than 1 mg of
haloperidol for the past 2 years. In an accompanying editorial,
McGorry et al concluded that ‘It now seems probable for patients
who achieve clinical remission from FEP that as many as 40% can
achieve a good long term recovery with use of no or low-dose
antipsychotic medication’.43
Of course, the fact that some patients remain well without
antipsychotics does not mean that the drugs do not help the
remainder of the patients who either stay symptomless on anti-
psychotics or have their symptoms ameliorated by antipsychotics.
Dopamine receptor supersensitivity
The findings of Wunderink are curious and require some
explanation. Why should antipsychotics be beneficial for up to
18 months but not at 7 years? Could it be that by then, anti-
psychotics have lost some of their effectiveness? To examine this
possibility, we need to consider the mechanism of action of
antipsychotics.
All
antipsychotics
share
the
same
essential
property – they block D2 and D3 dopamine receptors. For many
years, it was thought that the abnormality in schizophrenia lay
in these receptors, and therefore it seemed logical to block them.
However, it is now clear that most acutely psychotic patients show
excessive presynaptic synthesis of dopamine in the striatum.44
Thus, antipsychotics do not address the primary locus of
abnormality but rather have their beneficial effects downstream
of it. Is it possible that prolonged prescription of antipsychotics
sometimes induces changes in the D2/D3 receptor, which diminish
the effectiveness of the drugs?
Animal studies suggest that this may be the case.45,46 Thus,
Samaha et al found that, with continuous administration,
haloperidol and olanzapine progressively lost their efficacy in
suppressing amphetamine-induced locomotion and conditioned
avoidance in rats; this was reversed temporarily by a further
increase in antipsychotic dose. Antipsychotic failure was linked
362
Murray et al
 Long-term prophylactic use of antipsychotics
to a 20–40% increase in post-synaptic D2/D3 receptor density.47
Ginovart et al 48 subsequently showed that high-dose anti-
psychotics lead to such an upregulation of D2/D3 receptors in
cats; however, this did not occur with occupancy below 80% or
with transient occupancy. Thus, D2/D3 upregulation may be a
consequence of high-dose treatment.48
Post-mortem studies show increased D2/D3 receptor density in
the brains of people with schizophrenia; however, most of the
patients in these studies had been on long-term antipsychotics.49
A meta-analysis of in vivo positron emission tomography (PET)
and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
studies50 demonstrated that patients who had previously received
antipsychotics had an increase in D2/D3 receptor availability, but,
importantly, antipsychotic-naive patients were no different from
controls. One PET study showed D2/D3 receptor availability
greater by 30% in patients who had received long-term dopamine
antagonists relative to antipsychotic-naive patients.51
There have only been two longitudinal studies. Konig et al
showed a 10% increase in D2/D3 receptor availability over
2
months
in
one
patient
treated
with
huge
doses
of
chlorpromazine.52 A more recent study,53 which scanned eight
antipsychotic-naive FEP patients, showed no elevation in D2/D3
receptor availability at baseline, but after 2–3 weeks of treatment
(olanzapine 10 mg/day or risperidone 2–3 mg/day) there was an
increase in D2/D3 receptors in some brain regions.
The idea that antipsychotics could induce supersensitivity of
the D2/D3 receptor in some patients has been championed by
Chouinard and colleagues,54,55 who pointed out as early as 1978
that antipsychotics induce a syndrome of supersensitivity of the
motor system – tardive dyskinesia – and described what they
termed ‘drug-induced psychotic relapses’ associated with tardive
dyskinesia after long-term high doses of FGAs.56 They proposed
that this supersensitivity causes tolerance to antipsychotics, such
that eventually they no longer control psychotic symptoms. This
is supported by a follow-up study of a cohort of 8620 patients,
which reported worsening of psychosis with the onset of tardive
dyskinesia.57
The evidence of antipsychotic-induced changes in the D2
receptor points to an intrinsic problem with discontinuation
studies. This was noted by Carpenter and colleagues when they
stated that ‘once patients are placed on medication, they are less
vulnerable to relapse if maintained on neuroleptics. But what if
these patients had never been treated with drugs to begin with?
We raise the possibility that antipsychotic medication may make
some schizophrenic patients more vulnerable to future relapse
than would be the case in the natural course of the illness’.58
Moncrieff, who carried out a meta-analysis of patient with-
drawal studies, concluded that ‘antipsychotic discontinuation
may also increase the risk of relapse over and above the risk
because of the underlying disorder’.59 Interestingly, there have
been occasional reports of withdrawal psychosis occurring in
people who have never had psychiatric problems but have been
prescribed D2 blockers for other reasons.60–62
Unfortunately, there are no clinical studies examining whether
relapse following antipsychotic withdrawal is linked to D2/D3
receptor changes. However, Joyce, who gave haloperidol to rats
for 9 months, showed that the increase in D2 receptors persisted
for at least 2 months after stopping antipsychotics.63 Converting
rat months to their human equivalent, this would imply a period
of increased vulnerability in patients following discontinuation of
antipsychotics of more than a year.64 Such a vulnerability period
would be consistent with views expressed by patient groups such
as the Hearing Voices Network.65 They remind us that that many
people diagnosed as having schizophrenia have successfully come
off their antipsychotics,66 but point out that this can be initially
difficult owing to agitation, insomnia and indeed recurrence of
psychotic symptoms.
Implications
The results of animal studies are clear – dopamine D2/D3 receptor
upregulation and resultant supersensitivity can occur with long-
term use of antipsychotics. There are some neurochemical
imaging studies of patients suggesting the development of D2
supersensitivity; there is indirect evidence that this may be
responsible for the decrease in efficacy of antipsychotics with their
continuing prescription, and that it may contribute to relapse
on stopping antipsychotics. However, there is surprisingly little
longitudinal data, and methodological issues need to be addressed
before a firm conclusion can be reached.
Interestingly, it seems that dopamine partial agonists do not
induce D2 receptor supersensitivity in animals.67 Furthermore,
there are clinical reports that switching from a D2 blocker to
the partial agonist aripiprazole worsens psychosis, as would be
expected in a supersensitivity state.68
There is an urgent need for neurochemical imaging studies
addressing the question of dopamine supersensitivity in patients.
We also need further RCTs to examine the risk of relapse after dose
reduction and/or discontinuation of D2 blockers, as well as of
partial D2 agonists, in order to establish guidelines on when and
how antipsychotics can be safely reduced over time.
Treatment-resistant schizophrenia
In contrast to patients who respond to dopamine D2 blockers,
neurochemical imaging shows that a proportion of patients with
TRS do not show any abnormality of dopamine synthesis. It
appears that such patients have generally never responded to D2
blockers because they have nothing intrinsically wrong with their
dopamine system.69,70
A second group of TRS patients have initially responded to
antipsychotics but gradually lose this responsiveness. Several
Japanese groups71,72 have suggested that supersensitivity due to
upregulation of D2 receptors may be the cause of this treatment
resistance. Here, it is worth pondering why clozapine is the most
effective treatment for patients with TRS, when it is not especially
effective for patients with FEP.73 Chouinard’s idea that dopamine
supersensitivity underlies both tardive dyskinesia
and TRS
reminds us that one of the most effective treatments for tardive
dyskinesia is clozapine. Clozapine, of course, produces lower
and more transient D2/D3 receptor occupancy than most other
antipsychotics.74 This allows the dopamine supersensitivity of
the motor system to gradually resolve, and tardive dyskinesia to
slowly fade. Is it possible that the effectiveness of clozapine for
some patients with TRS relies on a similar mechanism?
Implications
Some patients diagnosed with TRS do not show dopamine
dysregulation, and therefore their failure to respond to D2
blockade is hardly surprising. A second group may have developed
TRS secondary to prolonged D2 blockade, and the effectiveness of
clozapine for such patients may rely on its ability to control
positive psychotic symptoms while D2 supersensitivity resolves.
By definition, people with TRS are not going to respond to D2
blockers. However, sadly, in practice such patients are frequently
prescribed high doses of D2 blockers in the misguided hope that
if a moderate dose is not effective then a larger dose may be so.
We urgently need studies of those people with TRS who do not
respond to clozapine to ascertain whether continuing them on
363
 Murray et al
non-clozapine antipsychotics has some partial benefit or just
produces side-effects.
Conclusions
What is the wise psychiatrist to do faced with the concerns we
have reviewed? He or she will treat acute psychosis with the
minimum necessary dose of antipsychotics, employing weight-
sparing
antipsychotics
wherever
possible;
dopamine
partial
agonists have this property and may also be less likely to induce
dopamine supersensitivity. Following recovery, the psychiatrist
should work with each patient to decrease the dose to the lowest
level compatible with freedom from troublesome psychotic
symptoms; in a minority of patients, this level will be zero.
Such an approach requires ready access to non-pharmaco-
logical treatments. Many psychiatrists rely largely on anti-
psychotics, not because they dismiss the value of, for example,
cognitive–behavioural therapy or vocational training, but rather
because financial constraints limit the availability of such
interventions.75 Psychiatrists need to campaign to ensure that
their patients have access to all beneficial treatments. The greater
availability of non-pharmacological treatments would enable
clinicians to determine more objectively when the balance of
advantage lies in stopping antipsychotics.
Finally, it is worth recalling that Leff & Wing, who carried
out the first RCT of long-term prophylaxis with antipsychotics
concluded that ‘[m]aintenance therapy seems of little value in
patients with a good prognosis and in the severely ill, but it is
of value in the indeterminate group between these two extremes’
.2
Of course, this historical view refers to non-clozapine anti-
psychotics and should be modified to suggest that the severely
ill who do not respond to such drugs should be encouraged to
try clozapine. Nevertheless, it is unfortunate that so little attention
has been paid to this cautionary statement.
