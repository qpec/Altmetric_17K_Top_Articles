ABSTRACT
The impact of precision oncology on guiding treatment decisions of late-stage 
cancer patients was previously studied in a retrospective analysis. However, the overall 
survival and costs were not previously evaluated. We report the overall survival and 
healthcare costs associated with precision oncology in these patients with advanced 
cancer. Building on a matched cohort study of 44 patients with metastatic cancer who 
received all of their care within a single institution, we evaluated the overall survival 
and healthcare costs for each patient. We analyzed the outcomes of 22 patients who 
received genomic testing and targeted therapy (precision oncology) between July 
1, 2013 and January 31, 2015, and compared to 22 historically controlled patients 
(control) who received standard chemotherapy (N = 17) or best supportive care 
(N = 5). The median overall survival was 51.7 weeks for the targeted treatment group 
and 25.8 weeks for the control group (P = 0.008) when matching on age, gender, 
histological diagnosis and previous treatment lines. Average costs over the entire 
period were $2,720 per week for the targeted treatment group and $3,453 per week 
for the control group, (P = 0.036). A separate analysis of 1,814 patients with late-
stage cancer diagnoses found that those who received a targeted cancer treatment 
(N = 93) had 6.9% lower costs in the last 3 months of life compared with those who 
did not. These findings suggest that precision oncology may improve overall survival 
for refractory cancer patients while lowering average per-week healthcare costs, 
resource utilization and end-of-life costs.
INTRODUCTION
The use of advanced molecular diagnostic 
technologies, such as Next-Generation Sequencing 
(NGS) based gene panel testing, to select targeted 
therapies in advanced cancer patients is known as 
precision oncology [1]. The feasibility of this approach 
results from the confluence of emerging multiplexed 
molecular technologies and the rapidly expanding set of 
molecularly targeted therapeutics [2–6]. While precision 
oncology represents an important translational medicine 
paradigm, the associated clinical outcomes are still 
maturing [7–11]. 
The precision genomics program at Intermountain 
Healthcare was established in a single region of the 
delivery system. Patients with advanced, refractory cancer 
were referred to the precision oncology clinic where they 
received genomic testing, an in-depth interpretation of the 
genomic results from a multi-institutional molecular tumor 
board, and a list of treatment options for implementation at 
the discretion of the treating oncologist.
We previously reported the results of a retrospective 
matched control study conducted to evaluate the 
progression free survival (PFS), and healthcare costs 
among 72 patients with metastatic cancer of diverse 
subtypes [12]. That analysis found that the 36 patients who 
                                                       Research Paper

had received precision cancer medicine had longer PFS 
periods than the 36 controls who had received standard 
chemotherapy or best supportive care (22.9 weeks vs. 12.0 
weeks) and that this difference was significant (P = 0.002). 
In addition, a subset analysis of 44 patients who received 
all of their care within the Intermountain system found 
that costs for those in the targeted treatment group did not 
have higher costs than those in the control group ($4,665 
per week vs. $5,000 per week, p = 0.126).
In order to evaluate the impact of precision cancer 
medicine beyond the PFS window and to determine the 
degree to which any survival or cost advantages persisted, 
we conducted a follow up analysis on the subset of 44 
patients from the original study to measure overall 
survival, average total healthcare costs, and resource 
utilization over the entire observation period, from the 
start of the study through either death or last observed 
encounter.
RESULTS
Healthcare encounters data for all 44 patients was 
obtained from the institutional enterprise data warehouse 
and evaluated to determine the observation windows for 
each patient. As before, all patients had initially received 
either targeted treatment or standard chemotherapy 
between July 2010 and January 2015. For the current 
analysis, we included data for all encounters from the 
initial date of treatment until either the date of death, or, 
if no date of death was recorded, the date of last observed 
encounter recorded in the encounters data. Dates of death 
were available for all 22 patients in the control arm, and 
for 18 patients in the targeted treatment arm. Patients in 
the precision medicine group received targeted therapy 
based on genomic profiling and a molecular tumor board 
interpretation, while patients in the control group received 
standard molecular testing indicated for their disease type. 
Patients in the two cohorts were matched according to age, 
gender, diagnosis, and number of previous treatments. For 
the 4 patients for whom dates of death were unavailable, 
the dates of last encounter were used as the endpoint of 
the observation period, which ranged from 0 months to 
72 post-PFS.
The protocol-specified primary endpoint of overall 
survival was significantly higher in the targeted treatment 
group (Figure 1) compared to the control group (mean, 
51.7 weeks vs. 25.8 weeks, respectively; P = 0.008). 
Within the control group, one patient’s post-PFS survival 
period had a significant impact on the overall median; this 
patient survived 187 weeks after the PFS period, more 
than 400% greater than the next highest value within the 
control group. By contrast, the longest post-PFS period 
in the targeted group was 97 weeks, which was only 17% 
greater than the next highest value in that arm. 
To determine the costs associated with the two 
treatment approaches, we performed a healthcare-related 
Figure 1: Overall survival and progression-free survival for patients receiving standard chemotherapy or targeted 
cancer therapy. Colored boxes indicate lower (green) or higher (red) charge events for each week of treatment. Gray scale areas reflect 
periods of time during which no charges were generated.

cost analysis to determine the average costs per week over 
the entire observation periods for each group (Table 1). 
Medical costs were categorized by site of care, which 
included inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room 
charges. In addition, hospice, prescription drug costs, 
and NGS test charges (sequencing) were calculated for 
each arm. Average costs per week over the entire period 
were significantly lower for the targeted treatment group 
compared with the control group (mean, $2,720 per 
week vs. $3,453, respectively; N = 0.036). In addition, 
the weekly charges for the targeted group exhibited 
lower variation compared with the control group 
(standard deviation, $8,514 vs. $9,867, respectively). 
Patients receiving targeted therapies had higher drug and 
sequencing charges, as expected, but these were offset by 
lower inpatient and outpatient charges, which were $104 
and $1,209 per week lower, respectively, than the control 
group.
Relative resource use associated with providing 
health services was 40% lower for the targeted treatment 
group across all sites of care (Figure 2). Moreover, 
resource use intensity for patients in the targeted group 
was lower in both higher-cost, acute settings such as 
inpatient and ER (17% and 2% lower, respectively) as 
well in the lower acuity outpatient setting (42% lower), 
compared to control patients (Figure 2). 
Our initial analyses were limited to a well-defined, 
matched population of advanced cancer patients (n = 44). 
To determine whether the cost savings seen in the smaller 
cohort might be preserved amongst a larger population, 
we expanded the analysis to include healthcare claims for 
1,814 late-stage cancer patients who were members of 
the health system’s health plan. In an unplanned posthoc 
analysis, we sought to understand the costs amongst these 
cohorts toward the end of life and found that those who 
received a targeted cancer therapy had 6.9% lower costs in 
the last 3 months of life compared with those who received 
standard chemotherapy ($43,711 vs. $46,940; Figure 3). In 
particular, inpatient costs were 47.4% lower for targeted 
patients during that period, which offset higher outpatient, 
office, and prescription drug costs. 
DISCUSSION
This study was designed to evaluate the overall 
survival and costs of care associated with precision 
oncology, compared to standard therapy or best supportive 
care. The results appear to indicate an overall survival 
benefit for patients receiving targeted therapy based 
on genomic testing compared to the cohort of patients 
receiving standard therapy.
The per-week costs of care for targeted patients were 
also found to be lower than for those in the control group, 
consistent with the findings previously reported for the 
progression free period [12]. However, unlike the previous 
analysis, the lower costs over the entire observation period

cancer therapy.

were found to be statistically significant. The drivers of 
this difference are twofold: 1) patients in the targeted 
treatment group have higher upfront prescription drug 
costs and sequencing charges, and 2) the overall costs 
of care are allocated over a significantly longer overall 
survival period, resulting in weekly charges that are 
both lower, on average, and exhibit lower variation. The 
simultaneous improvement in overall survival, as well as 
lower per-week costs, suggest that a precision medicine 
approach may be an attractive option for refractory cancer 
patients. Lower inpatient costs during the last three months 
of life appears to be a major source of the cost savings 
observed in the targeted treatment group. 
One limitation of the current study is that dates 
of death were not available for 4 patients in the targeted 
group, and thus the complete survival and cost picture 
was not obtained for the full sample of study participants. 
We believe the impact of this limitation on the overall 
conclusions is likely to be minimal, given that, if the 
patients survived beyond the last encounter, it would only 
serve to increase the survival benefit of the targeted patient 
cohort, relative to the control group. 
The fact that all of the patients received their 
treatment within a single integrated healthcare delivery 
system may limit the ability of these results to be 
generalized to the overall population of late-stage cancer

patients. An additional caveat to the current results is the 
small sample size, which may partially account for a large 
effect size. Further studies will be required to validate 
these findings.
A major question surrounding the implementation 
of precision oncology is its relevance in the community 
setting where nearly eighty-five percent of cancer patients 
treated in the United States receive their care [13]. The 
discovery that targeted therapy was associated with 
a 7% lower RRU, compared to standard therapy, in a 
large unselected cohort of patients with advanced cancer 
suggests that the benefits of targeted cancer treatment 
may be replicable in a community setting across a larger 
population. Further study is needed to measure the extent 
to which next-generation sequencing can be best applied 
to the community setting; additional experience in using 
precision cancer medicine to guide treatment decisions 
will be critical in developing the optimal treatment and 
care models for patients with refractory cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The Intermountain Healthcare Institutional Review 
Board approved this study, and all living participants 
provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. 
The Board granted a waiver of consent for decedents. 
Study design 
Research objectives: The objective of this follow 
up retrospective observational study was to compare the 
outcomes, costs, and resource utilization of cancer patients 
who were treated with precision cancer targeted therapies 
with a historical control cohort treated with a non-targeted 
approach over the entire course of treatment (including 
during and after PFS).
Research subjects
The selection and evaluation of study participants 
was conducted as part of the original study, the details of 
which have been reported previously1. Briefly, male and 
female adults with measurable recurrent/metastatic solid 
tumors, who failed standard first-line treatments proposed 
by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
guidelines, were included in this study. Other inclusion 
requirements were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2; and adequate 
renal, hepatic and bone marrow function. Patients who 
had only brain metastases or whose brain metastases had 
not been controlled for > 3 months, patients who were 
participating in a clinical trial with an experimental drug, 
or patients who had known infections or other concurrent 
severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease which could 
compromise participation in the study were excluded. 
Pregnant or breastfeeding women also were excluded. 
All patients in the precision medicine group 
had tumor molecular abnormalities for which the 
Intermountain Healthcare Multi-Institutional Molecular 
Tumor Board (MTB) provided an interpretation. 
Actionable mutations were defined as variants that had 
been validated in the peer-reviewed literature, and for 
which a targeted therapy was available. The molecular 
tumor board selected treatment options only for actionable 
mutations for which there was published clinical evidence. 
Patients included in the control group received standard of 
care genomic testing only, without molecular tumor board 
interpretation or molecularly targeted therapy beyond the 
relevant standard of care. 
Sample size
For the original study, a simulation power analysis 
was performed for a Cox proportional hazards model with 
100,000 simulations. In all, 72 patients were selected for 
analysis: 36 in the targeted treatment arm and 36 in the 
control arm. For the cost analysis, the researchers included 
only the 44 patients who sought care entirely within the 
Intermountain system (22 in each arm). In the current 
study, we included only the subset of 44 patients in order 
to maintain a consistent sample for which to estimate 
overall survival, costs, and resource utilization. Further 
details regarding the power analysis were previously 
published [12]
Selection of endpoints: The primary endpoint for the 
current study was overall survival, defined as the time a 
patient began targeted therapy, in the precision medicine 
group, or time a patient began the next line of treatment, in 
the control group, until the date of death or last observed 
encounter. Secondary endpoints included total healthcare 
costs per week as well as healthcare provider resource 
utilization, as measured by Relative Value Units (RVU).
Blinding
Clinician researchers were blinded to the identities 
of those in the control cohort. Cancer registrars selected 
the control cohort and provided data about the controls to 
the study statistician (AB). 
Statistical methods 
Two-sample t-tests were used to investigate 
differences in overall survival and costs of treatment. 
Cost analysis 
As with the prior study, patient costs were estimated 
using standard Intermountain Healthcare payer charges. 
Patient costs included total amounts for patient treatment, 
toxicity, NGS testing, and targeted drug therapy. Treatment 
costs included all facility-based and clinic-based charges 
 Oncotarget

for both targeted and control patients associated with 
treatment including chemotherapy, drug, radiology and 
lab costs. Palliative care costs were limited to CMS daily 
reimbursement charge rates. Toxicity costs included all 
patient charges associated with treating the side effects 
of treatment. NGS testing costs for precision oncology 
patients were obtained from the test provider based upon 
estimated payer reimbursement rates. Prescription drug 
cost data was drawn from local specialty pharmacies 
and drug manufacturers based upon estimated payer 
reimbursement rates including estimates of any patient 
out-of-pocket costs. A discount rate was not applied to 
costs to adjust for the time value of money. The mean per 
patient cost per week was calculated by adding the total 
costs across all patients in each arm and dividing by the 
total number of patients in that group. 
Resource use
Relative resource use associated with providing 
health services was estimated for each group by 
calculating the total Relative Resource Use (RRU) for each 
patient over their entire course of treatment. The National 
Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) developed 
RRU measures to compare health plans on resources used 
to care for beneficiaries within certain service categories 
(Inpatient Facility, Surgery and Procedure, Evaluation and 
Management (E&M), and Pharmacy) 2. Intermountain’s 
encounter system assigns an RRU value to each service 
and encounter, and these values were aggregated and 
averaged over all patients within each study arm.
