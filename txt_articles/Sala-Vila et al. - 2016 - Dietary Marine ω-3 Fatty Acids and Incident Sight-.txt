IMPORTANCE Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a devastating complication of individuals with type
2 diabetes mellitus. The retina is rich in long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(LCω3PUFAs), which are substrate for oxylipins with anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic
properties. Experimental models support dietary LCω3PUFA protection against DR, but
clinical data are lacking.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether LCω3PUFA intake relates to a decreased incidence of
sight-threatening DR in individuals with type 2 diabetes older than 55 years.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In late 2015, we conceived a prospective study within
the randomized clinical trial Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED), testing
Mediterranean diets supplemented with extra virgin olive oil or nuts vs a control diet for
primary cardiovascular prevention. The trial was conducted in primary health care centers in
Spain. From 2003 to 2009, 3614 individuals aged 55 to 80 years with a previous diagnosis of
type 2 diabetes were recruited. Full data were available for 3482 participants (48% men;
mean age 67 years).
EXPOSURES Meeting the dietary LCω3PUFA recommendation of at least 500 mg/d for
primary cardiovascular prevention, as assessed by a validated food-frequency questionnaire.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was incident DR requiring laser
photocoagulation, vitrectomy, and/or antiangiogenic therapy confirmed by an external
adjudication committee.
RESULTS Of the 3482 participants, 48% were men and the mean age was 67 years. A total of
2611 participants (75%) met target LCω3PUFA recommendation. During a median follow-up
of 6 years, we documented 69 new events. After adjusting for age, sex, intervention group,
and lifestyle and clinical variables, participants meeting the LCω3PUFA recommendation at
baseline (�500 mg/d) compared with those not fulfilling this recommendation (<500 mg/d)
showed a 48% relatively reduced risk of incident sight-threatening DR, with a hazard ratio of
0.52 (95% CI, 0.31-0.88; P = .001). This association was slightly stronger for yearly updated
LCω3PUFA intake (relative risk, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.28-0.82; P = .007).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In middle-aged and older individuals with type 2 diabetes,
intake of at least 500 mg/d of dietary LCω3PUFA, easily achievable with 2 weekly servings of
oily fish, is associated with a decreased risk of sight-threatening DR. Our results concur with
findings from experimental models and the current model of DR pathogenesis.

T
he increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus,
coupled with an increased lifespan, has resulted in a
steady rise of disability in older diabetic individuals.1 A
major concern for this population group is diabetic retinopathy
(DR), a leading global cause of vision loss.2 Given the economic
andsocietalburdenofDR,developingeffectivestrategiestopre-
vent or at least delay its onset is a major public health issue.3
The pathogenesis of DR is not yet fully understood, but in-
flammation, oxidative stress, and hipoxia-driven microvas-
cular alterations play a pivotal role in the worsening of retinal
functioninindividualswithdiabetes.4Theretinaisrichinlong-
chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCω3PUFAs), particu-
larly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n-3).5 Once released
from cell membranes, these fatty acids are transformed to ox-
ylipinswithanti-inflammatoryandantiangiogenicproperties.6,7
Because cell membrane DHA status is modifiable and depen-
dent on intake, dietary DHA or consumption of its parent food
oily fish has been suggested to protect against DR.5 Experi-
mental studies have consistently reported a protective role of
supplemental DHA or LCω3PUFA against DR8,9 or neovascu-
larization of the retina,10,11 a hallmark of proliferative DR. How-
ever, to our knowledge, human data are lacking.
WehypothesizedthatLCω3PUFAintakewiththeusualdiet
relates to lower vision-threatening DR. To test this hypoth-
esis, we longitudinally investigated the association of dietary
LCω3PUFA intake with incident DR requiring laser photoco-
agulation, vitrectomy, and/or antiangiogenic therapy in a co-
hort of middle-aged and older individuals with type 2 diabe-
tes enrolled into the Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea
(PREDIMED) study, a nutrition intervention trial for the pri-
marypreventionofcardiovasculardiseaseconductedinSpain.12
BecauseofthelackofavailablerecommendationsforLCω3PUFA
intake regarding DR and given the vascular nature of DR patho-
physiology, we tentatively set the exposure target to meeting
the recommendation for dietary LCω3PUFA for primary car-
diovascularprotection(500mg/d),13agoalthatcanbeachieved
by following the advice of the American Heart Association to
consume 2 weekly servings of fish, preferably oily fish.14
Methods
Setting
This substudy, which was conceived in late 2015, was con-
ducted within the frame of the PREDIMED trial (http://www
.predimed.es),thedesignofwhichhasbeendescribedindetail15
(http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN35739639). From
October 2003 to June 2009, a total of 8713 candidates were
screened for eligibility, and 7447 were randomly assigned to 1
of 3 interventions. Participants were men aged 55 to 80 years
and women aged 60 to 80 years at high cardiovascular risk but
with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment. Criteria for
eligibility were the presence of either type 2 diabetes or at least
3 cardiovascular risk factors: current smoking, hypertension,
dyslipidemia,overweightorobesity,andfamilyhistoryofearly-
onsetcoronaryheartdisease.Thestudyprotocolwasconducted
according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of
Helsinki and approved by the institutional review boards of
Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain; Rovira i Virgili University,
Reus, Spain; Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain; University of
Valencia,Valencia,Spain;UniversityofNavarra,Navarra,Spain;
University of Málaga, Málaga, Spain; Instituto de Investigación
Sanitaria de Palma, Palma de Mallorca, Spain; San Pablo Health
Center, Sevilla, Spain; University Hospital of Alava, Vitoria,
Spain; University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Las Palmas,
Spain; and Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, L'
Hospitalet de
Llobregat, Spain. Written informed consent was obtained from
all study participants. The formal trial protocol can be found
in Supplement 1.
Assessment of Risk Factors
The diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was based on at least 1 of the
following criteria: current treatment with insulin or oral hy-
poglycemic drugs; fasting (no caloric intake at least for 8 hours)
glucose at least 126 mg/dL in 2 determinations (to convert to
millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555); casual glucose at least
200 mg/dL with polyuria, polydipsia, or unexplained weight
loss; or glucose at least 200 mg/dL in 2 measurements after
an oral glucose tolerance test. Participants were considered to
have hyperlipidemia or hypertension if they had a previous di-
agnosis of these conditions and/or they were treated with cho-
lesterol-lowering or antihypertensive agents, respectively.
Smoking status was categorized into never, current, or past
smoking according to self-reports. Physical activity was de-
termined with a validated Spanish version of the Minnesota
Leisure-Time Physical Activity questionnaire and expressed
in minutes at a given metabolic equivalent per day.16 Anthro-
pometric variables (height, weight, and waist circumference)
and blood pressure were measured by standard methods.
Dietary Intake
Dietary intake was assessed at baseline and yearly during fol-
low-up by using a 137-item semiquantitative food-frequency
questionnaire validated for the PREDIMED study.17 In face-to-
face interviews, participants were asked about the frequency
of consumption of each food item during the past year, speci-
fying usual portion sizes. Nine possibilities of frequency were
offered, ranging from never to more than 6 times/d. Informa-
tion on seafood products was collected in 8 items of the ques-
tionnaire (uncanned oily fish; lean fish; smoked/salted fish;
Key Points
Question Do dietary long-chain ω-3 fatty acids protect against
diabetic retinopathy?
Findings A substudy of the PREDIMED randomized clinical trial
analyzed as an observational longitudinal cohort, considering only
participants with type 2 diabetes at baseline, showed after median
follow-up of 6 years that those reporting intake of at least 500
mg/d of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids at baseline had a 46%
decreased risk of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy compared
to those not meeting this target.
Meaning Results suggest fish-derived long-chain ω-3 fatty acids
are a healthy fat in this cohort.

mollusks; shrimp, prawn, and crayfish; octopus, baby squid
and squid; oily fish canned in oil; and oily fish canned in salted
water). Nutrient intakes were computed using Spanish food
compositiontables.Thevalidationofthefood-frequencyques-
tionnaire against 4 3-day food records showed energy-
adjusted intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.51 for
LCω3PUFA (P < .001).
After the screening visit, suitable candidates were ran-
domly assigned to 1 of 3 interventions: Mediterranean diet
(MeDiet) supplemented with extra virgin olive oil, MeDiet
supplemented with nuts, or control diet (advice to reduce all
dietary fat). Quarterly individual and group sessions were
scheduled for the 2 MeDiet groups; in them, participants were
educated on how to follow the MeDiet and received supple-
mental foods at no cost. Extra virgin olive oil (1 L/wk) was pro-
vided to 1 group and 30 g/d of mixed nuts (15 g walnuts, 7.5 g
hazelnuts, and 7.5 g almonds) to the other group. Those allo-
catedtothecontrolgroupwereeducatedonhowtofollowalow-
fat diet and received small nonfood gifts. In each session, a di-
etaryscreenerofadherencetotheMeDietwasusedtotrackdiet
changes.Thescorewasdeterminedby12questionsonfoodcon-
sumptionfrequencyand2questionsonfoodconsumptionhab-

encetotheMeDietamongfrequentconsumersofseafoodcould
introduce confounding, the question about seafood consump-
tion was omitted from the brief screener; therefore, a 13-point
score was used as a covariate (minimum, 0; maximum, 13).
End point Ascertainment
Diabeticretinopathywasnotanexplicitlyprespecifiedsecond-
aryoutcomeofthePREDIMEDtrial.However,giventhatnearly
one-half of participants had type 2 diabetes, this complication
was always included as a relevant outcome in all interim analy-
ses supervised by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board.
Neweventswereidentifiedprospectivelythroughyearlyre-
viewofthemedicalrecordsofeachparticipant.ThePREDIMED
dietitians of the different teams were responsible for the accu-
rate filling of the follow-up questionnaires, which included 3
items about noncardiovascular complications of diabetes. Sus-
pected DR was investigated by clinical records made by oph-
thalmologists and hospital discharge reports. All the informa-
tionwassenttotheadjudicationcommittee,whichdetermined
the validity of diagnoses based on the information received.
Participants were considered to have sight-threatening DR if
they had undergone laser photocoagulation, intravitreal an-
tivascular endothelial growth factor injections, and/or vitreo-
retinal surgery. Only cases that were confirmed by the adju-
dicationcommitteeandthatoccurredbetweenOctober1,2003,
and December 1, 2012 (date of the last update in the extended
follow-up of the PREDIMED cohort, 2 years after the end of the
trial), were included in the analyses.

After excluding participants free of type 2 diabetes at base-
line (n = 3833) with missing data on year after diagnosis of type
2 diabetes (n = 25), food-frequency questionnaires (n = 36), 13-
point score of adherence to MeDiet (n = 5), and those who re-
ported total energy intakes outside predefined limits (>4000
or <800 kcal/d in men, and >3500 or <500 kcal/d in women;
n = 64)orwithimplausibleintakesofLCω3PUFA(>4g/d;n = 2),
3482 study participants (n = 1151 control diet, n = 1236 MeDiet
plus extra virgin olive oil, and n = 1095 MeDiet plus nuts) re-
mained for inclusion in the analysis (eFigure in Supplement 2).
The exposure of interest was meeting the International So-
ciety for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids recommenda-
tion to consume at least 500 mg/d of LCω3PUFA (DHA + ei-
cosapentaenoic acid [C20:5ω-3]) for primary cardiovascular
prevention (yes/no), which was released in June 2004.13 Base-
line differences in demographic, clinical, and selected di-
etary variables between groups of exposure were assessed by
analysis of variance or χ2 tests, as appropriate.
To assess the associations between meeting the recom-
mendation for LCω3PUFA intake (yes/no) at baseline and the
riskofincidentsight-threateningDR,weusedunadjusted,age-
and sex-adjusted, and multivariable time-dependent Cox pro-
portional hazard models including age, sex, body mass in-
dex, intervention group, year after diagnosis of diabetes (≤5
or >5), use of insulin (yes/no), use of oral hypoglycemic agents
(yes/no), smoking status (never, former, or current smoker),
systolic blood pressure, history of hypertension (yes/no), use
of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor and/or angioten-
sin-II receptor blockers (yes/no), physical activity, and adher-
ence to the MeDiet (13-point score) as potential confounders.
All analyses were stratified by recruitment center. Additional
analyses were done after stratifying for history of hyperten-
sion, year after diagnosis of diabetes, and use of insulin and
oral hypoglycemic agents at baseline. We also used Cox re-
gression models to assess the risk of the prespecified end-
point according to the joint categories of meeting target in-
take recommendations for LCω3PUFA intake (yes/no) and
intervention group (3 groups, 2 dummy variables).
Several sensitivity analyses were conducted refitting Cox
regressionanalysesforLCω3PUFAafter(1)excludingearlycases
of sight-threatening DR that occurred in the 2 first years of fol-
low-up; (2) including only events occurring after at least 3 years
of follow-up; and (3) excluding cases occurring after 5 years of
follow-up. Effect modification by sex, intervention group, and
LCω3PUFA intake on incident DR was evaluated by calculat-
ing the likelihood ratio test between the fully adjusted model
and the same model adding the interaction product term.

repeated measurements from baseline to the beginning of that
yearly period. We defined the cohort risk as participants who
remained free of DR at the beginning of each 1-year follow-up
period. Participants who had been classified as incident cases
were excluded from subsequent follow-up analyses.

Results
The mean age of participants at inclusion was 67 years, and
48% of them were men. At baseline, from the whole cohort
(n = 3482), 2611 participants (75%) met the target recommen-
dation of LCω3PUFA intake. Table 1 summarizes the baseline
clinical characteristics and treatment regimens of partici-
pants. Those not meeting the recommendation of LCω3PUFA
intake were older, smoked less, had a higher prevalence of hy-
pertension (and treatment with antihypertensive drugs), and
were treated with insulin more frequently than those meet-
ing the LCω3PUFA recommendation. Intake of energy and nu-
trients and consumption of key foods are shown in Table 2. In
brief, compared with participants meeting the LCω3PUFA rec-
ommendation, those who did not also adhered less to the
MeDiet, although they consumed less red meat.
Duringameanfollow-upof6years,wedocumented69new
events. Table 3 shows the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs as-
sociated with the exposure of interest. After adjusting for in-
tervention group and classic risk factors, participants report-
ing intake of at least 500 mg/d of eicosapentaenoic acid + DHA
at baseline showed a 46% decreased risk of incident sight-
threatening DR (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.31-0.88; P = .001) in com-
parison with participants not meeting the recommendation of
LCω3PUFAintake.Higherriskreductionswereobservedinpar-
ticipantswithhypertension,thosewithdiabetesofgreaterthan
5 years duration, and those treated with insulin at baseline
(eTable in Supplement 2). The Figure shows the multivariate-
adjusted HRs by meeting the recommendation for LCω3PUFA
atbaselinebyinterventiongroup.Whencomparedwiththeref-
erence category (participants not meeting target intake and al-
located to the control diet group, n = 326), those meeting the
recommendation had a significant decreased risk regardless of
the intervention group to which they were allocated. Notably,
compared with the reference category, only participants not
meeting the recommendation but allocated to the MeDiet with
extra virgin olive oil intervention group (n = 280) had a border-
line 63% (95% CI, 87-2) decreased risk of sight-threatening DR.
We conducted several sensitivity analyses to investigate
possible sources of bias in the estimation of the relationship
between meeting the recommendation for LCω3PUFA intake
at baseline and sight-threatening DR (Table 3). The results of
these analyses were consistent with the findings of the pri-
mary analysis. Additionally, the magnitude of the association
was strengthened when using as exposure the yearly up-
dated LCω3PUFA intake (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.28-0.82;
P = .007). Finally, a lower risk (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23- 0.72;
P = .002) was also observed when grouping the participants
by reporting to meet the advice of the American Heart Asso-
ciationtoconsumeatleast2weeklyservingsofoilyfishatbase-

of vascular diseases in arterial beds other than the coronary
and cerebrovascular ones.
Epidemiologic studies assessing exposure to LCω3PUFA
for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (in par-
ticular fatal coronary heart disease) prompted the debate of
whether increasing LCω3PUFA intake is beneficial for pa-
tients with diabetes. The effectiveness of this approach has
been questioned in recent years given the null reduction of the
rate of cardiovascular events reported in the Outcome Reduc-
tion With an Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial of
LCω3PUFA intake in patients with diabetes with a much lower
background LCω3PUFA intake19,20 coupled with a suggested
increased risk of DR secondary to peroxidation of accumu-
lated PUFA in the retina.21 However, no clincal data support a
deleterious effect of LCω3PUFA on the retina. Actually, a small
cross-sectional study reported that increased PUFA intake (al-
though not distinguishing between ω-3 or ω-6 fatty acids) was
associated with reduced odds of prevalent DR and lesser DR
severity in patients with well-controlled diabetes, while no as-
sociations were found for those poorly controlled.22 Supris-
ingly, neither epidemiologic studies nor clinical trials fo-
cused on dietary LCω3PUFA and DR, although the link has
repeatedly been proven in experimental models.8-11 By report-
ing that regular LCω3PUFA intake seems to reduce the risk of
the most severe form of DR, particularly in patients with hy-
pertension or advanced diabetes, we reinforce the benefits of
theseparticularfattyacidspeciesinacriticalpopulationgroup.
Our results are mechanistically supported by experimen-
tal studies showing that anti-inflammatory LCω3PUFA-
derived compounds, mostly lipoxins, resolvins, and protec-
tins, delay progression of DR, particularly neovascularization,
the hallmark of proliferative DR, and improve diabetic macu-
lar edema.11 Nevertheless, we must underline that this study
was conducted in a Mediterranean population with high
adherence to a plant-based diet, as attested by relatively
high mean MeDiet scores (Table 2). Therefore, it seems plau-
sible that a high intake of antioxidants, a main feature of this
dietary pattern, might contribute to counteracting the pre-
sumed membrane peroxidation of PUFA. Indeed, a prior
analysis of the PREDIMED trial concerning diabetic complica-
tions by intervention arm described a significant reduction of
incident DR in participants allocated to the MeDiet supple-
mented with extra virgin olive oil.23 In our study, when con-
sidering the 3 intervention groups, a marginal additional
reduction in DR was observed by meeting the LCω3PUFA tar-
get precisely in the MeDiet with extra virgin olive oil group
(Figure 1). This suggests that phytochemicals with antioxi-
dant and anti-inflammatory properties contained in extra vir-
gin olive oil could overrun the protection afforded by
LCω3PUFA.
Our study has limitations. First, this is a prospective
analysis of a subsample in a larger clinical trial that was not
specifically designed to examine incidence of sight-
threatening DR. Second, the assessment of diabetes compli-
cations was not the primary end point for the PREDIMED
trial, and no data on prevalent DR were available at base-
line. Nonetheless, we took care to ensure that all cases of
incident sight-threatening DR were diagnosed by experi-
enced ophthalmologists and confirmed by an external adju-
dication committee. Additionally, individuals with DR at
baseline would have been more likely to be diagnosed with

complicated DR in the first 2 years of follow-up, and results
after excluding events reported during this period were
similar to those of the primary analysis. Third, we had a
relatively low number of events with rates slightly lower
than those observed in a Spanish general population,24
resulting in imprecise estimates. Finally, because the study
participants were middle-aged and older individuals with
type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease living
in a Mediterranean country, our findings cannot be easily
extrapolated to other populations. There are also strengths
to our study, such as a prospective design with a long dura-
tion of follow-up, validation of the food frequency ques-
tionnaire, adjustment for relevant confounders, and the
confirmation of the primary results by both sensitivity
analyses and cumulative average estimates of the exposure
of interest, that provide a more robust measure than a single
baseline dietary assessment.
Conclusions
In summary, we report that meeting the target of at least 500
mg/d of dietary LCω3PUFA is associated with a reduced inci-
dence of severe DR in individuals older than 55 years with type
2 diabetes. Our findings, which are consistent with the cur-
rent model of the pathogenesis of DR and data from experi-
mental models, add to the notion of fish-derived LCω3PUFA
as a healthy fat.
