BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) include stressful and 
potentially traumatic events associated with higher risk of long-term behavioral problems 
and chronic illnesses. Whether parents’ ACE counts (an index of standard ACEs) confer 
intergenerational risk to their children’s behavioral health is unknown. In this study, we 
estimate the risk of child behavioral problems as a function of parent ACE counts.
METHODS: We obtained retrospective information on 9 ACEs self-reported by parents and 
parent reports of their children’s (1) behavioral problems (using the Behavior Problems 
Index [BPI]), (2) attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis, and (3) emotional 
disturbance diagnosis from the 2013 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) core 
interview and the linked PSID Childhood Retrospective Circumstances Study and 2014 PSID 
Child Development Supplement. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were 
used to estimate child behavioral health outcomes by parent retrospective ACE count.
RESULTS: Children of parents with a history of 4 or more ACEs had on average a 2.3-point 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–3.2) higher score on the BPI, 2.1 times (95% CI: 1.1–3.8) 
higher odds of hyperactivity, and 4.2 times (95% CI: 1.7–10.8) higher odds of an emotional 
disturbance diagnosis than children of parents with no ACEs. Maternal ACEs revealed 
a stronger association with child behavior problems than paternal ACEs. Relationships 
between parents’ 9 component ACEs individually and children’s BPI scores revealed 
consistently positive associations. Mediation by parent emotional distress and aggravation 
were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Parents with greater exposure to ACEs are more likely to have children with 
behavioral health problems.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: We can use 
adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) to predict 
early life behavioral problems and adult chronic 
illness risk and severity across the life span. 
Intergenerational associations between parents’ 
ACEs and their children’s behavioral health problems 
have not been quantified.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Children of parents 
reporting more ACEs bear higher burden of 
behavioral health problems and conditions, 
including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
and emotional disturbance diagnoses.

 Adverse childhood experiences 
(ACEs) include abuse, neglect, and 
household dysfunction experienced 
before the age of 18, and ACEs have 
well-established downstream health 
consequences over the life course. 
Higher ACE scores help us to predict 
behavioral health problems in 
childhood and adulthood, worsening 
mental health, adverse health-
related behaviors, chronic disease 
burden, and premature mortality.1 
–

Little published evidence, however, 
exists regarding intergenerational 
associations between ACE scores 
in parents and behavioral health in 
their children.
Although specific parental adverse 
experiences, such as abuse in 
childhood, have been associated  
with children’s socioemotional  
problems and risk of maltreatment, 
4 
–8  
intergenerational associations 
between more global parent ACE 
counts and children’s behavioral 
health problems remain largely 
unexamined. If various types 
of childhood adversity cause 
harm through a common set of 
stress pathways, as is commonly 
hypothesized, then parent ACE 
count might reflect the total “dose” 
across types of adversity better 
than any specific ACE. Moreover, 
intergenerational effects of ACEs 
might be transmitted through 
common pathways such as parent 
mental health and unfavorable 
parenting practices.9 
– 
11 Authors of a 
single domestic study used maternal 
ACEs to predict infant and early 
childhood developmental outcomes12 
and the authors of 2 Canadian studies 
have shown that maternal total ACE 
counts predict mothers’ perceptions 
of infants’ emotional problems and, 
separately, development, 
13, 
 
14 but 
researchers have not examined such 
relationships throughout childhood.
The ACE count bundles together 
multiple risk factors in the domains 
of abuse, neglect, and household 
dysfunction and may serve as a more 
comprehensive index of parental 
adversity experienced during 
their childhood. Estimates of the 
intergenerational behavioral health 
risk to children of their parents’ ACE 
counts could provide insight into how 
childhood adversity and adult health 
hazards are transmitted in families 
and help clinicians more accurately 
anticipate and decrease the risk of 
child behavioral health problems.
In our study, we examine differences 
in indices of children’s behavior 
problems and the risk of behavioral 
health conditions (attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
[ADHD] and any mental health 
disturbance) associated with their 
parents’ retrospective ACE counts 
in a national sample of families. We 
explore separate parent-specific 
associations between the mothers’ 
and fathers’ ACE counts and their 
children’s behavioral problems, as 
well as potential mediators of these 
associations including parental 
mental health and parenting 
aggravation.
METHODS
Design and Participants
We used data from the 2013 wave 
of the Panel Study of Income 
Dynamics (PSID), a panel survey 
with a genealogical design in which 
researchers collect household 
economic, health, and demographic 
information by telephone from a 
nationally representative sample 
of US adults, spouses or partners, 
and their children. Child behavioral 
outcomes and parents’ ACE data 
were obtained from two 2014 PSID 
supplements: the Child Development 
Supplement (CDS) 2014 and 
the Childhood Retrospective 
Circumstances Study (CRCS). All 
5636 children aged 0 to 17 in 
PSID households were eligible for 
CDS 2014, for which information 
was collected via telephone and 
in-person on children’s behavior, 
psychological and social well-being, 
family environment, education, and 
caregiver characteristics between 
the fall of 2014 and the spring of 
2015. Of the eligible children, 4333 
(77%) contributed any data after the 
families of 881 children could not be 
reached within the data collection 
period, 391 refused or had language 
barriers, and 31 were excluded 
for other reasons. Of the children 
whose behavioral outcomes were 
collected, those with any parent 
reporting information on all ACEs 
assessed by CRCS were included in 
our study. The researchers of the 
CRCS retrospectively assessed 9 
ACEs for English-speaking adults and 
their spouses or partners from the 
PSID 2013 main interview. A total of 
8072 individuals completed the CRCS 
via a Web-based or mailed survey 
between May 2014 and January 2015 
for an unweighted response rate of 
62% (weighted response rate 67%) 
that was similar to the Web-based 
supplements in other national panel 
studies.15 Among the 4333 CDS 2014 
children, 67% had either a mother 
or a father who participated in the 
CRCS, yielding 2903 children who 
were eligible for our study. Our main 
study group thus comprised children 
participating in CDS 2014 with 1 or 
more parents reporting complete 
ACE data in the CRCS, which we 
analyzed to answer the following 
primary study question: What is the 
association between parents’ ACEs 
and their children’s behavioral health 
problems?
Construction of ACE Predictor
Parents participating in the CRCS 
reported any experiences before 
age 18 of physical abuse, emotional 
abuse, sexual abuse or assault, 
emotional neglect, witnessing 
intimate partner violence at home, 
witnessing household substance 
use, having a parent with mental 
illness, any parental separation or 
divorce, and/or having a deceased 
or estranged parent. In Table 1, we 
display the proportion with each 
type of ACE and the distribution of

Downloaded from 
 participant ACE counts. Consistent 
with previous literature, ACE counts 
were binned into 4 categories: 0, 1, 2 
to 3, and 4+.16 
– 
18
For our main analysis, the parent 
ACE predictor variable was specified 
as the higher of either parent’s ACE 
count category, allowing for inclusion 
of children with only 1 parent who 
participated in the CRCS. For analyses 
in which the relationship between 
each parent’s ACE count and child 
behavioral outcomes were examined, 
we included the ACE count of each 
parent (if present) in the model 
along with an indicator variable 
for the presence of each parent. 
We examined specific parent ACE 
predictors one by one and counted 
them positive if either parent had 
experienced the specific ACE.
Given this is the first published use 
of ACEs from the PSID, we confirmed 
retrospective ACEs were associated 
with current adult health outcomes, 
measures of those adults' childhood 
stress, and their home environment 
(Supplemental Information).
Outcomes
Outcomes included the Behavior 
Problems Index (BPI), a 30-item 
battery used to assess the 
incidence and severity of child 
behavior problems.19, 
 
20 The BPI 
was administered to the primary 
caregivers of children aged 3 to 17 in 
CDS 2014. Response options for all 
BPI items included never, sometimes, 
and often, which were dichotomized 
to never (0) or sometimes or often 
(1) and summed for a total BPI score 
for each child. Primary validation 
of the BPI from the 1981 National 
Health Interview Survey Child 
Health Supplement revealed high 
internal reliability with an α of .91. 
The researchers of that validation 
study reported a mean of 6.4 points 
and an SD of 5.7. To benchmark 
the index, they also reported 
children who had previously needed 
psychiatric treatment having BPI 
scores roughly 1 SD greater than 
population average.21 Internalizing 
and externalizing behavior BPI 
subscales were provided from the 
PSID (Supplemental Table 6).22
The 10-item CDS 2014 Positive 
Behavior Scale (PBS) measured 
positive behaviors such as self-
control, persistence, self-esteem, 
social competence, and compliance 
in children aged 6 to 11.23 The 
PBS score is the average of its 10 
component items (shortened for 
the CDS from the usual 25 items), 
which ask primary caregivers to 
respond on a 5-point scale from “not 
at all like your child” (0) to “totally 
like your child” (5) (Supplemental

 Table 7). The PBS has an adequate 
internal consistency (α .79), 
moderate stability over time, and 
high construct validity with inverse 
correlations between the PBS and 
BPI between −0.48 (parent rated) 
and −0.8 (teacher rated) in previous 
CDS waves.
Two clinical outcomes included 
primary caregiver report of the child 
ever having been told by a clinician 
that he or she had 1) ADHD or 2) 
any mental illness or emotional 
disturbance.
Covariates
The PSID main interview and CDS 
2014 provided data for the following 
covariates in our analyses: an 
education variable for each parent 
(less than high school, high school 
graduate or General Equivalency 
Diploma, some college, completed 
college, and graduate degree), child 
age in years, child race (white, 
African American, Asian American 
and/or Pacific Islander, and 
multiracial or other), an indicator 
for child Latino and/or Hispanic 
ethnicity, household income (<100%, 
100%–199%, 200%–299%, 300%–
399%, and ≥400% of the federal 
poverty level), an indicator of family 
health insurance, count variables for 
the number of household members 
and children, and indicators of the 
presence of each parent. Results were 
nearly identical when a covariate for 
reasons single-parent households 
had <2 parents (ie, divorce, parent 
death, etc) was added, so it was not 
included.
We examined demographic 
differences between the subsample 
of children with complete data and 
the overall CDS 2014 sample. We 
chose not to use multiple imputation 
to address data missingness and 
instead excluded observations 
with incomplete data because we 
hypothesized that the primary 
cause of missingness (parents not 
participating in the Web-based CRCS) 
was not random and, if anything, 
would likely bias our findings toward 
the null.
To ensure that our main regression 
findings were adequately free from 
selection bias in supplemental 
analyses, we used treatment effects 
models with inverse probability of 
treatment weighting and regression 
adjustment.24 We estimated the 
probability of treatment (parent ACE 
count category) using data reported 
by the parents in the sample on their 
own parents’ (ie, their children’s 
grandparents) education levels, their 
self-rated socioeconomic status in 
childhood, their race and ethnicity, 
and childhood family structure. 
The covariates used in the main 
regression analyses were also used in 
these doubly robust treatment effects 
models as regression adjustment 
covariates.
Statistical Analyses
We regressed children’s behavioral 
outcomes on their parents’ ACE 
counts by using multivariate linear 
and logistic regression models 
adjusted for covariates. Models 
were weighted to accommodate 
the complex survey design, achieve 
population representation, and adjust 
for nonresponse. We calculated and 
report survey-robust SEs.
We performed secondary analyses 
to assess whether relationships 
between parent ACE counts and 
behavioral health outcomes were 
mediated by parents’ mental 
illness (using the Kessler-6 scale of 
emotional distress) or aggravation 
(using the Aggravation in Parenting 
Scale [APS]). Both scales have strong 
psychometric properties and are 
well validated.25, 
 
26 We performed 
formal Goodman and Gotlib5 tests 
(a well-validated approach) to 
determine the degree of reduction 
in the coefficient on continuous 
outcome variables after accounting 
for a mediator to estimate the 
proportion of the ACE count effect on 
BPI and PBS scores mediated by their 
anxiety and depression symptoms or 
aggravation parents experienced in 
their parenting roles.27 In additional 
secondary analyses, we ran separate 
linear regression analyses for each 
of the 9 parent ACEs coded as binary 
predictor variables against child 
behavioral outcomes.
We also examined parent-rated 
overall child health status and 
odds of obesity by using the parent 
ACE count predictor to determine 
if adversity tracked with other 
aspects of children’s health. The null 
results (Supplemental Table 8) of 
these analyses confirmed children’s 
behavioral health outcomes were 
distinctly associated with parent 
childhood adversity.
All analyses were conducted by 
using Stata, version 14 (Stata Corp, 
College Station, TX). The University of 
California, Los Angeles Institutional 
Review Board approved this study, in 
which we used restricted data from 
University of Michigan’s Institute for 
Social Research.
RESULTS
Of the 2903 CDS 2014 children 
whose parents participated in CRCS, 
our sample included 2529 children 
with complete data. One-fifth of 
children had a parent who reported 
experiencing 4 or more ACEs during 
their own childhood. Over 20% of 
our sample was nonwhite, one-eighth 
was Latino or Hispanic, one-fourth 
had parents with a high school 
education or less, one-eighth lived 
below the federal poverty line, and 
the average age was 9 years. The 
average scores on the BPI and PBS 
were 6.8 (SD 5.8) and 4.1 (SD 0.5), 
respectively. ADHD was reported for 
8% of children, and <4% of children 
were reported to have been given a 
diagnosis of emotional disturbance 
(Table 2).
Children who had a parent with a 
history of 4 or more ACEs had worse 
scores on the BPI and PBS, as well as 
on the internalizing and externalizing

 behavior subscales of the BPI, 
compared with children whose 
parents reported no ACEs during 
their childhood (Table 3). Higher 
odds of hyperactivity and emotional 
disturbance were also observed for 
children of parents with the highest 
ACE burden.
When we included the ACE count of 
each responding parent in our model, 
we found that high ACE counts for 
mothers were strongly associated 
with child behavior outcomes 
(Table 4). For children with mothers 
whose ACE counts were 4 or more, 
the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) 
for hyperactivity and emotional 
disturbance were 3.1 (95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.5–6.1) and 
5.4 (95% CI: 1.9–15.1) compared 
with no maternal ACEs, whereas for 
children of fathers with 4 or more 
ACEs, the aORs were 1.3 (95% CI: 
0.6–2.9) and 2.3 (95% CI: 0.7–7.7) 
compared with no paternal ACEs. 
Likewise, BPI scores were 2.3 (95% 
CI: 1.4–3.3) and 2.8 (95% CI: 1.6–3.9) 
points higher for children whose 
mothers reported, respectively, 2 
to 3 and 4 or more ACEs compared 
with no maternal ACEs, whereas BPI 
scores were 1.1 (95% CI: 0.6–2.2) 
points higher for children of fathers 
with 2 to 3 more ACEs compared 
with no paternal ACEs.
When examining which component 
ACEs for parents were associated 
with increases in children’s BPI 
scores, each ACE except neglect, 
exposure to intimate partner 
violence, and death or estrangement 
of a parent showed a statistically 
significant positive association  
(Table 5).

Downloaded from 
 Goodman and Gotlib5 mediation 
analyses showed that 27.0% of 
the association between child BPI 
total score and parents’ ACE count 
category was mediated by primary 
caregivers’ Kessler-6 emotional 
distress scores, whereas 19.0% of the 
association was mediated by parents’ 
scores on the APS. Accordingly, 
these parent mediators attenuated 
the associations between the higher 
of either parent’s ACE count and 
children’s behavioral outcomes when 
included in our primary regression 
models (Supplemental Table 9).
Analyses in which inverse probability 
of treatment weighting with 
regression adjustment was used were 
consistent with our primary analyses’ 
findings, suggesting minimal selection 
bias (Supplemental Table 10).
DISCUSSION
In our study of a national sample 
of families, we found associations 
between parents’ ACE counts 
and their children’s behavioral 
health problems. Higher parent 
ACE counts (particularly mothers’ 
ACE counts) were associated with 
children’s higher scores on validated 
measures of both internalizing and 
externalizing behavior problems 
(BPI), lower measures of positive 
behaviors (PBS), and increased 
odds of ADHD and emotional 
disturbance. Six of the 9 individual 
parent ACEs examined in our study 
were associated with statistically 
significant increases in child BPI 
scores.
This is the first report showing a 
relationship between overall parental 
ACE count and children’s behavioral 
health diagnoses, which indicates 
that the impacts of elevated ACE 
counts on emotional well-being may 
extend across generations. These 
intergenerational correlations are 
partially mediated by parents’ 
emotional distress and aggravation 
with parenting. Our findings extend 
to ACEs more generally the results of 
existing studies in which a link has 
been shown between specific ACEs 
experienced by parents (eg, physical 
abuse) and behavioral outcomes in 
their children.4 
–8
We found that mothers’ ACE counts 
exerted a stronger influence on 
child behavioral outcomes than 
fathers’ ACE counts. Mothers 
were predominantly the primary 
caregivers for children in our sample, 
which may explain the greater 
influence of their experience of 
adversity through more time spent 
with the child. There is also evidence 
from the child and adolescent 
development literature that mothers’ 
and fathers’ parenting tends to differ 
on standard dimensions of parenting 
style (authoritative, authoritarian, 
and permissive), 
28 and that the 
differences in parenting styles 
correlate with differential emotional 
adjustment in teenagers.29 This raises 
the possibility that parent ACEs 
may influence children’s behavior 
through parenting styles more 
common among mothers. In utero 
maternal influences might be another 
mechanism through which maternal 
adversity in particular could affect 
child outcomes.30 These mechanisms 
deserve additional study.
Our results reveal that parent  
ACE scores could help clinicians

 are at higher risk for behavioral 
health problems and provide an 
opportunity to prevent downstream 
consequences associated with 
childhood behavioral health  
problems, such as higher risk of 
academic underachievement, 
31 
involvement in the justice system, 
32  
mental illness, 
33 substance use, 
34 
and poorer attainment.35 If  
these hazards to lifelong success 
can be traced back, even just in 
part, to parent ACEs, this could 
help clinicians target preventive 
interventions early in an at-risk 
child’s life, perhaps by equipping 
parents with skills to promote 
their child’s healthy emotional 
development before they are even 
born. Given the relative ease of 
collecting parent ACE information, 
we suggest exploring how parent 
ACE information might be collected 
for behavioral risk stratification in 
prenatal and early childhood clinical 
settings or for better understanding 
underlying familial risks after 
behavior problems are identified. 
Additional research is needed to 
evaluate prospectively the impact 
of screening for parents’ ACEs 
and intervening to mitigate child 
behavioral health risk.
Our results revealed additional 
evidence that early childhood stresses 
have long-lasting downstream 
consequences across generations. 
Given that childhood behavior 
problems are linked to later life 
mental health and that intervention 
during the perinatal period has  
been suggested as a method to  
reduce adult mental illness burden, 
36  
our findings further support a 
growing literature on family-based, 
2-generation approaches to mental 
illness treatment. Clinically validated 
and implemented approaches to 
preventing child maltreatment and 
exposure to violence may represent 
strategies to not only minimize short-
term harms to the child but also 
prevent behavior problems in future 
generations.37
As in most studies measuring the 
long-term consequences of ACEs, we 
are limited in our study by relying 
on retrospective reports of ACEs. 
Reverse causality is a potential threat 
if behavior problems in children 
prompted parents to examine 
their upbringings through a lens of 
greater frustration, although it seems 
unlikely that parents would report 
ACEs that simply did not occur. 
Unmeasured confounding biological 
or behavioral factors in parents and 
children, ways parents relate to their 
children, or the interaction of these 
factors could play a role in linking the 
ACE predictors and child outcomes 
in our study. Resilience factors and 
childhood adversity that were not 
captured by our ACE measure were 
not addressed in this study, and 
this limits our ability to gauge the 
full dynamic effect of how adversity 
is experienced and responded to. 
Selection into the sample of children 
whose parents responded to CRCS 
may have disproportionately 
included or excluded children whose 
parents had a history of ACEs or 
other factors. Although we could 
not, authors of future studies should 
examine whether children’s behavior 
problems related to their parents’ 
ACEs predispose them to adult 
mental illness, risky behaviors, and 
lower achievement.
CONCLUSIONS
We found that child behavioral 
health problems are linked to higher 
ACE counts experienced by these 
children’s parents, particularly 
by their mothers. This is the first 
study of American families to report 
that overall parent ACE count is 
correlated with behavioral health 
problems in their children. Parent 
mental health and aggravation with 
parenting partially mediated the 
association between parent ACEs and 
child behavior. Efforts to reduce child 
behavior problems should consider 
risk stratification on parents’ 
ACEs and upstream approaches to 
reducing ACEs or interrupting their 
intergenerational impacts.
