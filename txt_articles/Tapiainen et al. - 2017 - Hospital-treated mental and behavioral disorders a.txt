ABSTRACT 
Background: Studies investigating psychiatric disorders as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk 
factors have yielded heterogeneous findings. Differences in time windows between the 
exposure and outcome could be one explanation. We examined whether 1) mental and 
behavioral disorders in general or 2) specific mental and behavioral disorder categories increase 
the risk of AD and 3) how the width of the time window between the exposure and outcome 
affects the results. 
Methods: A nationwide nested case-control study of all Finnish clinically verified AD cases, 
alive in 2005 and their age, sex and region of residence matched controls (n of case-control 
pairs 27,948). History of hospital-treated mental and behavioral disorders was available since 
1972. 
Results: Altogether 6.9% (n=1,932) of the AD cases and 6.4% (n=1,784) of controls had a 
history of any mental and behavioral disorder. Having any mental and behavioral disorder 
(adjusted OR=1.07, 95% CI=1.00–1.16) or depression/other mood disorder (adjusted OR=1.17, 
95% CI=1.05–1.30) were associated with higher risk of AD with 5-year time window but not 
with 10-year time window (adjusted OR, 95% CI 0.99, 0.91-1.08 for any disorder and 1.08, 
0.96-1.23 for depression). 
Conclusions: The associations between mental and behavioral disorders and AD were modest 
and dependent on the time window. Therefore, some of the disorders may represent 
misdiagnosed prodromal symptoms of AD which underlines the importance of proper 
differential diagnostics among older persons. These findings also highlight the importance of 
appropriate time window in psychiatric and neuroepidemiology research.

INTRODUCTION 
It is estimated that 47 million people suffered from dementia in 2015 and the amount is expected 
to nearly double every 20 years.(1) The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD), which is one of the costliest chronic diseases to society(2). Identification of potential 
AD/dementia risk factors is important, because it may aid in targeting or developing potential 
strategies to prevent or delay the dementia onset. 
Previous studies have mainly assessed specific mental and behavioral disorders, most 
commonly affective disorders(3), as AD risk factors. Two studies(4, 5) reported a higher 
prevalence of psychiatric illness history among persons with AD, but we are not aware of other 
studies assessing whether mental and behavioral disorders in general are related to AD risk. 
Most of the previous studies have assessed the association between depression and AD, with 
inconsistent findings(6). A meta-analysis(7) concluded that depression is a risk factor rather 
than a prodromal symptom of AD as the width of time window between exposure and outcome 
was positively related to the risk of developing AD. Controversially, another study(8) 
concluded that 1-year increase in time window decreases the likelihood of dementia by 8%, 
suggesting that depression is a prodromal symptom of dementia rather than a risk factor. 
Similarly, the debate on whether early-life or late-life depression is more important risk factor 
is ongoing(3, 6, 8-13). The results of studies investigating the association between bipolar 
disorder and dementia(14-17) and late-life schizophrenia and dementia(18-21) have been 
equally heterogeneous. 
Many of these studies have been hampered by methodological issues such as narrow time 
windows between the exposure (mental and behavioral disorders) and outcome (AD/dementia) 
or cross-sectional study design(13, 22, 23). Thus, in these studies the mental and behavioral 
disorders can actually have been prodromal symptoms or consequences of AD.(6) Due to the 
long latency period of AD/dementia, having an adequate time window between exposure and 
outcome (i.e., allowing a large enough time gap between them) is crucial. Otherwise the 
identified “risk factors”, may actually be manifestations of the outcome.  
Our nationwide nested case-control study was conducted to examine whether 1) mental and 
behavioral disorders in general or 2) specific mental and behavioral disorder categories increase 
the risk of AD and 3) how the width of the time window between the exposure and outcome 
affects the results. 
2 
METHODS 
2.1 
Study population 
The study was conducted in the MEDALZ-2005 (Medication use and Alzheimer’s disease) 
study population.(24) This is a nested case-control study of the population of Finland, including 
all AD cases with clinically verified diagnosis (n=28,093) and their age-, sex-, and region of 
residence matched controls (n of matched case-control pairs=28,093). To be included in the 
study sample, the participants had to be alive on December 31, 2005, and community-dwelling. 
Data were available on all residents of Finland who had a unique personal identity code(25), 
i.e., all citizens and residents who lived in Finland for at least 2 years and had not resided abroad 
for more than 1 year on December 31, 2005. Controls were identified from a register of all 
residents with a personal identity code. Some of the controls had temporarily been entitled to 
reimbursed AD medication before January 1, 2006 (n=145) and they, together with their 
matched AD cases (n=145), were excluded from the analyses. 
 4 
 
2.2 
Data sources 
The AD cases were identified from the Special Reimbursement Register maintained by Social 
Insurance Institution (SII). The Special Reimbursement Register contains information on 
reimbursement due to specific chronic diseases such as AD. To be included in this register, the 
diagnosis must be based on explicit predefined criteria and written documentary evidence, 
including results of a diagnostic test, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance 
imaging scan, must be provided to the SII by a physician. 
The Hospital Discharge Register contains data on inpatient hospital admissions. The register 
contains information of each admission, including date, reason for hospital stay (coded 
according to ICD-8, ICD-9 and ICD-10. The diagnoses for each hospital visit are made by 
attending physician. The detailed history of The Hospital Discharge register is described in 
Sund et al.(26)  
The register maintainers retrieved the data from different registers using the personal identity 
codes and de-identified the data before submitting it to the research team. Because all data were 
de-identified and participants were not contacted, ethical approval was not required according 
to Finnish legislation. 
2.3 
Identification of cases with AD 
The diagnostic criteria for probable AD were based on the National Institute of Neurological 
and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders 
Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) and The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria.(27, 28) AD cases were identified from the Special 
Reimbursement Register and had to fulfil the requirements of the reimbursement which were: 
1) symptoms consistent with AD; 2) experienced a decrease in social capacity over a period of 
at least 3 months; 3) a computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan; 4) exclusion 
of alternative diagnoses ; and 5) confirmation of the diagnosis by a registered neurologist or 
geriatrician.(29) The requirements for reimbursement were consistent during 1999–2005. 
Summary of anamnestic information from the patients and family, as well findings from clinical 
examination and all diagnostic and laboratory findings, were submitted to the SII, where a 
geriatrician/neurologist systematically evaluated the diagnostic evidence for each AD case and 
confirmed whether the pre-specified criteria are met. The physician also needs to confirm 
whether the patient has other dementing diseases, such as mixed dementia, multi-infarct 
dementia or Lewy body dementia. However, patients with these diseases are also entitled to 
reimbursed medicines if the symptoms are considered to be mainly caused by AD. 
2.4 
Extraction of mental and behavioral disorders 
Diagnoses of mental and behavioral disorders (Chapter V of the ICD-10 classification, code 
F*) during 1972–2005 were extracted from the Hospital Discharge Register. ICD-8 and ICD-9 
codes were converted to ICD-10 codes (Supplementary table). The conversion was made by 
using classification of National Centre for Health Statistics and the code lists of the Finnish 
National Institute for Health and Welfare. The mental and behavioral disorder diagnoses were 
categorized according to previously applied classification(30): ‘Mental and behavioral 
disorders due to psychoactive substance use’ (F10–F19); ‘schizophrenia, schizotypal and 
delusional disorders’ (F20–F29); ‘manic episode and bipolar affective disorder’ (F30–F31); 
‘depression and other mood disorders’ (F32–F39); ‘neurotic, stress-related and somatoform 
disorders’ (F40–F48); ‘disorders of adult personality and behavior’ (F60–F69) and ‘other 
disorders’ (F00–F09, F50–F59, F60–F69, F70–F79, F80–F89, F90–F98, F99–F99). 
Due to small number of persons with ‘manic episode and bipolar affective disorder’ and 
‘disorders of adult personality and behavior’ these categories were combined with ‘other 
 5 
 
disorders’ category, which thereafter contained ‘organic, including symptomatic, mental 
disorders’ (F00-F09); ‘manic episode or bipolar affective disorder’ (F30–F31); ‘behavioral 
syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors’ (F50–F59); 
‘disorders of adult personality and behavior’ (F60–F69); ‘mental retardation’ (F70–F79); 
‘disorders of psychological development’ (F80–F89); ‘behavioral and emotional disorders with 
onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence’ (F90–F98) and ‘unspecified mental 
disorder’ (F99–F99). 
2.5 
Confounders 
Data on chronic diseases were identified from the Special Reimbursement Register. A modified 
Charlson Comorbidity Index(31) was calculated using the following diseases with 
corresponding scores: heart failure, coronary artery disease, type 1 or 2 diabetes, chronic asthma 
or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, disseminated connective tissue diseases, rheumatoid 
arthritis and other comparable conditions (score of 1); uremia requiring dialysis, severe anemia 
in connection with chronic renal failure, leukemia, other malignant diseases of blood and bone 
marrow including malignant diseases of the lymphatic system and all cancers (score of 2). The 
comorbidity score was summed to each person at the index date (December 31, 2005). Due to 
skewed distribution the score was categorized to “0”, “1”, “2,” and “≥3”. 
A composition variable indicating substance abuse was created on the basis of the following 
data from the Hospital Discharge Register: mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive 
substance use (ICD-10 codes F10–F19), alcohol-induced chronic pancreatitis (ICD-10 codes 
K86.00, K86.01 and K86.08) and hospitalizations due to substance abuse. 
2.6 
Statistical analysis 
All analyses were performed using Stata, version 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex.). 
Student’s t test was used for comparing the age differences between groups. Other continuous 
variables were compared with Wilcoxon rank-sum test due to skewed distribution. Differences 
in categorical variables were investigated with Pearson’s chi-square test. Associations between 
mental and behavioral disorders and AD were assessed with conditional logistic regression. 
Odds ratios (ORs) are represented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). To account for reverse 
causality, only those mental and behavioral disorders and confounders that occurred at least 5 
or 10 years before AD diagnosis date of the case were taken into account. Both 5- and 10-year 
time windows were used when assessing associations between mental and behavioral disorders 
and AD. In addition to unadjusted analyses, the analyses were adjusted for 1) modified Charlson 
Comorbidity Index and 2) modified Charlson Comorbidity Index and substance abuse. In order 
to further illustrate the impact of time window, we calculated odds ratios for the associations 
between exposures and AD for 0-33-year time window between exposure and outcome. All 
statistical tests were two-sided.

RESULTS 
3.1 
Characteristics of study population 
Characteristics of study population are shown in Table 1. The mean age of the study population 
was 79.7 (SD 6.8) and majority of the population were ≥75 years old (80.5%). Proportion of 
women was 67.7%. AD cases had slightly more chronic diseases compared to controls. 
Altogether 6.5% (n=3,649) of the whole study population had a history of any mental and 
behavioral disorder requiring hospital treatment and of them, ‘depression and other mood 
disorders’ were the most frequent (37.5% of persons with mental and behavioral disorders). 
With the 5-year time window between exposure and outcome, history of mental and behavioral 
disorders, was more frequent in AD cases than in controls. Findings were similar for individual 
 6 
 
categories, except for ‘schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders’. The persons with 
mental and behavioral disorders were younger with mean age of 78.7 (SD 7.3) vs 79.7 (SD 6.8) 
and had more chronic diseases than people without mental and behavioral disorders. There were 
no sex differences between these groups. When 5-year time window was used, the mean 
difference between the first hospital admission due to any mental and behavioral disorder and 
date of AD diagnosis was 18.1 years (SD 8.9) for AD cases, 19.4 years for controls (SD 9.0; 
calculated from the AD diagnosis date of the matched case). 
3.2 
Associations of mental and behavioral disorders with Alzheimer’s disease 
The associations of mental and behavioral disorders with AD are shown in Table 2. In the crude 
analyses with 5-year time window, any mental and behavioral disorder (OR=1.09, 95% 
CI=1.02–1.17) and ‘depression and other mood disorders’ (OR=1.18, 95% CI=1.06–1.32) were 
associated with higher risk of AD. Adjustments slightly weakened both associations. These 
associations disappeared when the 10-year time window was applied. The negative association 
between ‘schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders’ and risk of AD strengthened 
after the time window was widened, but the confidence interval was wide and included also 1 
(adjusted OR=0.87, 95% CI=0.73–1.02). 
More detailed investigation of the changes in OR depending on the time of exposure is 
illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The association between any mental and behavioral disorder (the 
entire chapter V of the ICD-10 classification) was highly dependent on the time window. Those 
with the longest time window (>20 years) had lower odds of AD in comparison to persons 
without a history of any mental and behavioral disorder, and the OR was not different from 1 
when those with a mental disorder diagnosed 5-20 years before AD were included (Figure 1). 
The association became evident only with those with <5 years time window, as illustrated from 
the exponential increase in these diagnoses among AD cases around the same timepoint 
(Supplementary figure 1).The association of ‘schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional 
disorders’ and ‘neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders’ followed a similar pattern 
(Figure 2). For ‘depression and other mood disorders’ and ‘mental and behavioral disorders due 
to psychoactive substance use’ an inverse association with longer time windows was not 
observed, but also with these categories, the association became evident with shorter time 
windows. Similar exponential increase of diagnoses among AD cases was seen in specific 
mental and behavioral disorder categories as in any mental and behavioral disease. 
(Supplementary figure 2). The differences were higher for ‘schizophrenia, schizotypal and 
delusional disorders’ and ‘depression and other mood disorders’ and relatively small for 
‘mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use’ and ‘neurotic, stress-
related and somatoform disorders’. 
4 
DISCUSSION 
Our study showed that the width of time window affects the association between mental and 
behavioral disorders and AD. Having any mental and behavioral disorder or ‘depression and 
other mood disorders’ were associated with an increased risk of AD when a 5-year time window 
was applied but the associations disappeared when the time window was extended to 10 years. 
More detailed investigations revealed that the narrower time window between exposure and 
AD, especially <5-year time window, the higher the odds of AD and larger the difference in the 
cumulative annual prevalence. Similar tendency was also observed for other mental and 
behavioral disease categories (‘mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance 
use’; ‘schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders’; ‘depression and other mood 
disorders’ and ‘neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders’). These results may be due 
to misdiagnosis of prodromal symptoms of AD as mental and behavioral disorders. It might be 
that that some AD cases, possibly with mixed forms of dementia (Lewy body disease in addition 
 7 
 
to AD), had symptoms like delusions and hallucinations which could have been misdiagnosed 
as very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis, that starts after age of 60 years(32). However, 
that is a rare disease and the entity is still under discussion. 
Interestingly, the exponential increase of ‘depression and other mood disorders’ from 7 years 
before AD diagnosis was similar to a previous study(33) in which the change in the Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale in relation to AD diagnosis was investigated. 
In that study, the CES-D score of AD cases separated from that of the controls 7 years before 
AD diagnosis. The cumulative prevalence of any mental and behavioral disorder increases 
exponentially among AD cases as the time window got closer to AD diagnosis. Note that Tables 
1 and 2 were made with 5-year time window so that they were dated right at the beginning of 
the exponential growth (Supplementary figure 1). 
The inverse association between any mental and behavioral disorder and AD was observed with 
time windows of >20 years. One possible explanation could be use of lithium as treatment. 
Lithium was mainly used as a mood stabilizer to treat bipolar disorders and it was also used to 
treat depression, schizoaffective and schizophrenic disorders if there is no response to 
conventional medicines (i.e. antidepressants and antipsychotics) (34). Several studies have 
shown that lithium use could have preventive effect to AD/dementia(35-37) and that it could 
decrease P-tau concentration in cerebrospinal fluid and improve cognitive skills among mild 
cognitive impairment patients (38). Lithium used for treatment of mental and behavioral 
disorders could therefore protect these patients from AD. Similar inverse association was seen 
with ‘schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders’ and ‘neurotic, stress-related and 
somatoform disorders’. However, the number of persons with long-term psychiatric history is 
relatively small and also some selection via mortality has very likely occurred, for example, 
among those with the longest history of neurotic and stress-related disorders and schizophrenia. 
To our knowledge, ours was the first large scale study to assess the association of any mental 
and behavioral disorder and AD. Our findings are in line with previous studies on the higher 
prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in AD patients(4, 5) and studies that investigated 
depression(7, 8, 39) as a risk factor for AD. Previous studies with narrow or non-existent time 
window between depression and AD/dementia reported an association between depression and 
AD/dementia (5,22,23) while studies with wider time window yielded inconsistent results 
(5,8,10,40). Taken together, our findings and the previous research highlight the importance of 
choosing an appropriate time window for analyses. 
4.1 
Strengths 
The strengths of our study were clinically verified diagnosis of AD, representativeness and the 
length of the follow-up time. All AD diagnoses were clinically verified and the positive 
predictive value of diagnoses is good (PPV 97.1%(41)). The Finnish health care system (and 
thus the registers applied in this study) includes all citizens despite their age and income. 
Therefore, these data represent all socioeconomic classes instead of members of a certain 
private health care insurance scheme. The long-term follow-up of over 30 years enabled us to 
investigate the effect of time window selection and thus, we were also able to account for 
reverse causality (i.e. mental and behavioral disorders would be caused by AD). Too narrow 
time window could cause bias as mental and behavioral disorders could be a reaction to early 
cognitive deficits or the symptoms of pre-dementia stage of AD could be misdiagnosed as 
mental and behavioral disorders. As a register based study, this study does not rely on self-
report and therefore, it is not subject to recall bias. 
 8 
 
4.2 
Limitations 
The mortality of persons with mental and behavioral disorders, especially with ‘mental and 
behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use’, is significantly higher compared to 
general population (42, 43). Due to the higher mortality, our prevalence figures represent only 
those persons who survived to be old enough to develop AD, not the entire population. We 
accounted for the decreased life expectancy by matching the AD cases and controls by age and 
sex. In this way, the decreased life expectancy should affect similarly both cases and controls. 
In addition, we adjusted the analyses for substance abuse. Although the register data on 
substance abuse captures only the most serious cases and thus, is an underestimation, the degree 
of underestimation is likely to be independent of exposure and outcome and it should not bias 
the results. 
The Hospital Discharge Register includes stays in hospitals but does not include information 
from outpatient clinics and thus, mental and behavioral disorders were restricted to more serious 
cases and do not represent the entire spectrum of these diseases. Especially, the findings with 
‘depression and other mood disorders’ and ‘neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders’ 
represent the association with most severe forms of these disorders as they are mainly treated 
in outpatient clinics. On the other hand, previous validation studies have shown that the Hospital 
Discharge Register is able to capture nearly all persons with schizophrenia, schizotypal and 
delusional disorders.(44, 45) 
Although all AD diagnoses were clinically verified according to a standard protocol, one 
limitation is that the diagnoses were probable AD rather than definite AD. However, the validity 
was improved by the practice that diagnoses were assessed by two independent specialists in 
clinical practice, and further evaluation was done in the SII according to the predefined criteria. 
In addition, national studies with definite AD diagnosis were not possible in the study period, 
as definite AD diagnoses could only be made post mortem. To our knowledge, the same 
limitation is present in all other studies of this topic. 
Because our data were representative only of the most severe forms of mental and behavioral 
disorders e.g., depression, it would be important to examine the association between mental and 
behavioral disorders and AD with data that includes also those mental and behavioral disorders 
diagnosed in outpatient clinics. Further, the association between depression and AD/dementia 
may be dependent on the age when depression was diagnosed, or severity or episodic nature of 
the disease(3, 6), but this was beyond the scope of our study. 
4.3 
Conclusion 
Our nationwide nested case-control study did not detect a strong association between mental 
and behavioral disorders and AD. Although some associations were detected with narrow time 
windows, they disappeared when a wider time window was applied. This suggests that some of 
these mental and behavioral disorders might actually have been prodromal symptoms of AD 
and thus, underlines the importance of proper differential diagnostics of AD and mental and 
behavioral disorders. In addition, these findings highlight the importance of appropriate time 
window in psychiatric and neuroepidemiology research.
