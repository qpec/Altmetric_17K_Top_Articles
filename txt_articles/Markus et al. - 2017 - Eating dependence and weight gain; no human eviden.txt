Running head: Sugar, ‘addiction’ and body weight

ABSTRACT 
Background and Aims: There is an increasing societal concern that consumption of specific 
foods such as sugar might become ‘addictive’ and, hence, promote weight gain. Claims about 
the addictiveness of sugar however are based largely on findings from few animal studies, 
whereas there is a lack of direct human evidence for symptoms of sugar-related substance 
dependence. The current study examined in a large sample of human participants whether 
foods mainly containing sugar in particular might cause ‘addiction-like’ problems that meet 
clinical DSM criteria for substance dependence, and, also whether in turn this relates to body 
weight and negative affectivity (depressed mood). Methods: in a cross-sectional study, 
n=1495 university students from a variety of faculties were assessed for DSM-related signs of 
food addiction for particular food categories (YFAS), and, also BMI and negative affectivity. 
Results: Results revealed that from the total sample, 95% experienced at least one symptom 
of food dependence and 12.6% met the YFAS classification for ‘food addiction’ as related to 
DSM-IV criteria. The majority of respondents experienced these problems for combined high-
fat savoury (30%) and high-fat sweet (25%) foods, whereas only a minority experienced such 
problems for low-fat/savoury (2%) and mainly sugar-containing foods (5%). Overweight 
correlated only with addictive-like problems for high-fat savoury and high-fat sweet foods 
(P<0.0001), while this was not found for foods mainly containing sugar. Conclusion: The 
current findings indicate that sugary foods contribute minimally to ‘food dependence’ and 
increased risk of weight gain. Instead, they are consistent with the current scientific notion 
that food energy density, and the unique individual experience of eating,  plays an important 
role in determining the reward value of food and promoting excessive energy intake.

INTRODUCTION 
The global epidemic of overweight is considered one of the greatest threats to human health. 
Since 1980, the prevalence of clinical overweight or obesity has nearly doubled (WHO, 
2015); already affecting more than 30 percent of the population in the US (1) and in Europe 
(2) and it is expected to further increase to more than 80% in the upcoming years. People with 
obesity are known to suffer from low grade inflammation (3) resulting in a greater risk of 
developing type 2 diabetes (4), cardio vascular disease (5) as well as mood disorders, 
including depression (6).  
With the increase in worldwide prevalence of overweight and its relation to severe health 
consequences and psychopathologies, the concept of ‘food addiction’ has regained popularity; 
both among the lay public and professionals, including food researchers and nutrition 
practitioners (7). This concept in particular has regained popularity since increasingly greater 
importance has been given to environmental obesogenic factors, such as the over-whelming 
availability of inexpensive palatable calorie-dense sweet and/or fatty foods (8-10).  
In most current discussions of guilty snacks for weight gain and obesity, in particular the 
hedonic rewarding characteristic of sugar has been recently suggested by some to have abuse 
potential that is similar to classical drugs by stimulating shared brain reward pathways 
involved in drug addiction (11-13). Consequently, in lay terms this ‘sugar-addiction’ 
hypothesis now seems to offer an attractive explanation, and possibly an excuse, for excessive 
consumption of sugary foods (foods mainly containing sugar), including binge eating and 
hence overweight (14).  
This sugar-addiction hypothesis is mainly based on findings from rodent experiments that are 
interpreted in favor of the addiction-like properties of sweetness from sucrose, glucose and/or 
saccharine liquid (11, 15, 16). In most of these sugar-bingeing experiments, rats given 
 4 
 
intermittent access to sucrose –with a 12-h ad libitum access to sucrose solution followed by 
12 hours without sucrose- revealed signs of what the authors describe as sugar ‘bingeing’ 
behavior. Although in these studies sugar bingeing was not accompanied by animal weight 
gain, it often increased dopamine (DA) within the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and caused 
‘withdrawal’ signs after cessation of sucrose or glucose and administration of an opioid 
antagonist (12, 15, 17, 18). Since drugs of abuse (e.g. amphetamine, cocaine), among other 
‘rewards’, act on the same mechanisms and are also found to increase extracellular 
concentrations of DA in the striatum and related mesolimbic regions (19), these apparent 
similarities between sugar and drugs on DA have given rise to the sugar addiction hypothesis 
of binge eating. However, acting on the same mechanism does not necessarily say anything 
about (shared involvement in) addiction.    
Although rodent research may generate meaningful hypotheses for understanding human 
behavior, their translational value for human eating behavior, food addiction and binge eating 
or obesity is highly controversial in the current scientific community (20-24). Ample evidence 
from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of controlled human dietary trials do not support 
the assumption that a particular macronutrient like sugar causes binge eating and weight-gain 
more so than other food sources (20, 24, 25). Yet, in contrast to the available human evidence 
regarding the association between food and weight gain, the validity of the sugar-specific 
addiction model of binge eating and/or weight gain has only rarely been explored in human 
studies.  
A most frequently used method to explore ‘addiction-like’ properties of foods in human 
participants is to assess whether they may experience food harms that meet approximate DSM 
criteria for ‘substance use disorder’ (e.g. tolerance, withdrawal, considerable time spent on 
finding, using and recovering from the abuse, inability to cut down using despite the desire to 
do so, continued usage despite negative consequences). For this purpose, Gearhardt and 
 5 
 
colleagues (26) developed the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) that uses some (not all) 
DSM criteria for clinical-related substance disorders to quantify symptoms of ‘addiction-like 
eating’ for highly palatable, energy-dense foods. Although the use of the self-report YFAS 
questionnaire has also been criticized for its little value concerning the clinical diagnose for 
addiction and/or substance-related disorders (27), it is today’s most common and frequently 
used method to explore ‘food-related dependency like’ symptoms in human eating research. 
For this, it mainly relies on its validation in normal weight as well as obese and/or binge 
eating participants; revealing strong correlations between YFAS symptoms scores to elevated 
craving (28) as well as elevated body weight and binge eating (29, 30). Furthermore, the 
prevalence of YFAS ‘food addiction’ diagnose (FA) is found to range between 0-11% in 
general population (31, 32) with a 4-5 times greater prevalence of 20-70% in binge-eating 
and/or overweight and obese participants (27, 33). Only few authors have yet attempted to 
assess YFAS ‘food-addiction’ signs for specific foods or food attributes/nutrients  (31, 34-36).  
To our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate the prevalence of YFAS ‘food 
addiction’ symptomatology -as well as its association with body weight-, while considering 
(controlling for) the possible mediating role of specific types of problem-macronutrients 
(including sugar). Moreover, since preferences for sugary foods are often found to rise under 
negative affective and/or depressive circumstances (37, 38), ‘addiction-like’ problems for 
sugar in particular might coexist with depression symptoms. Specifically, the study explored 
in a large population sample (n=1495) of healthy young male and female participant whether 
YFAS ‘food-addiction’ symptoms more often occur for foods that largely/only contain sugar 
(as compared to combined foods) and, in turn, whether this relates to BMI and depression.  
 
METHODS 
Participants 
 6 
 
Fourteen hundred and ninety five university students, 1046 women and 449 men (age between 
18-30; 21.6±3 years), participated in this study by completing an on-line survey. Exclusively 
after full completion of the online survey (thus after receiving n=1495 completed packages), 
more than half were randomly invitation to the laboratory for extra actual weight-related 
measurements. Students from different faculties of the Maastricht University were recruited 
via e-mail, advertisements, and fliers placed and posted in the local paper of the University. 
The study was approved by the Ethics committee of the Faculty of Psychology and 
Neurosciences (ECP, Maastricht, The Netherlands) and participants were paid for 
participation.       
 
Procedure 
Besides advertisements and fliers, University students across different faculties and study-
years at the University Maastricht received a personal invitation mail to participate (N=6000). 
Responding students (N=2500) received a confirmation mail including further information 
about the study as well as a personal link to complete an on-line survey set on the digital 
research platform ‘EMIUM’. The on-line survey included standardized questionnaires 
assessing general characteristics, signs of food addiction (Yale Food Addiction Scale or 
YFAS; (26) and depressive symptomatology (39). From all responding students, finally 1495 
students fully completed and returned the electronic questionnaire packages within 3-4 weeks. 
Half of these participant (N=786) were also actually tested for (to check) weight-related 
variables in the laboratory. Invitations for these additional laboratory tests were exclusively 
and randomly done 1-3 weeks after receiving n=1495 completed electronic packages and 
these tests were conducted within 1 month after completion of the electronic on-line survey).

Signs of food addiction.  
To assess Food Addiction for food-specific categories; an elaborated version of the Yale Food 
Addiction Scale (YFAS) (26) was used. The YFAS is a 25-item scale that measures food 
addiction like symptomology based on the DSM-IV criteria for substance dependence. These 
items consists of both Likert scales and dichotomous scales that fall under criteria that 
resemble symptoms for substance-dependence as stated in the DSM and as operationalized in 
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM disorders (American Psychiatric Association, 
2000). These criteria scales include symptoms for tolerance, withdrawal, loss of control over 
consumption, continued use despite problems, repeated unsuccessful attempts to quit and/or 
clinically significant impairment/distress.  
For eight YFAS clinical symptom scales, a total score of symptoms endorsed was calculated 
by first using an algorithm based on items under each symptom (score of ≥1 indicated that the 
substance dependent criteria were met, a score of “0” indicated that the criteria were not met) 
and then by summing up the total number of symptoms that met the criteria (ranging from 0-
7). The classification (diagnose) of food addiction (FA) was made when respondents 
experienced three or more symptoms over the past year that met the substance dependent 
criteria with the presence of clinically significant impairment or distress from overeating. The 
YFAS is found to have good internal reliability (alpha = 0.86) along with good convergent 
and divergent reliability (26).  
 
Because the current study aimed to explore the effects of sugar in particular as compared to 
other food categories; we included the following parts to the YFAS. First, to avoid priming, 
we modestly changed the starting instruction text to: “when the following questions ask about 
“certain foods or snacks”, please think of any food you had a problem with in the past year”. 
Then, three extra items were added (at the end of the original 25 items) for the purpose of 
 8 
 
relating food addiction (FA) symptoms more directly to specific food categories. A first 
additional item (item 26) asked participants to assign the food problems they might have 
experienced in the past year (covered by the original first 25 items) to one of 4 explicitly 
given typical food categories: 1) Low-fat savoury foods (LFSA; light foods/snacks containing 
none/almost none fat or sugar; e.g. rice cake, crackers, vegetables, etc), 2) Sugar foods (foods 
mainly/totally containing sugar without fats or protein; e.g. sugar sweets, candy, wine gums, 
soda or lemonade, syrup, dried fruit), 3) High-fat sweet foods (HFSW; foods containing much 
fat either or not with sugar: e.g. cake, chocolate, patisserie, etc) or 4) High-fat savoury foods 
(HFSA; foods mainly containing much fat and protein like chips/fries, meat, cheese, etc). Two 
further items were added; asking whether there are any foods that have been experienced 
causing physical side effects (withdrawal-like effects: item 27) or whether there are foods that 
need to be consumed in greater amounts in order to experience the same pleasure/rewarding 
effect (tolerance: item 28).  
 
Depression symptoms. Participants’ ratings of depression symptoms were obtained using the 
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), a validated self-report questionnaire containing 21 items 
measuring severity of depression symptoms. The BDI has been studied extensively and has 
been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of the severity of depression symptoms (39, 
40). 
 
Body weight. Height and weight values were obtained from each (N=1495) participant’s 
general information questionnaire as part of the completed electronic questionnaire package. 
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (in kg) divided by the square of the height 
(in meters). To check for accuracy of self-reported height and weight values, half of the 
 9 
 
population (N=786) was also actually assessed for these variable in the laboratory (1-3 weeks 
after completion of the electronic on-line survey).  
 
Statistical analyses 
All data were first examined for accuracy of data-entry and missing values. Testing for 
normal distribution was conducted using the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality. Cross-tab and/or 
chi-square tests were conducted to explore distribution and differences in the percentages of 
separate YFAS symptoms as well as for the prevalence of YFAS FA in the total sample of 
respondents; across the different problematic-food categories (Sugar, HFSW, HFSA or 
LFSA). Bivariate-comparisons were conducted to explore associations between total YFAS 
symptoms and BMI scores as well as between depression symptomatology (BDI scores) and 
YFAS symptoms. In addition, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to 
examine whether ‘problems for specific foods’ may alter the association between YFAS and 
BMI (thus letting the model account for differences between problem-food categories with 
respect to YFAS effects on BMI). For this, YFAS symptoms (model 1), Problem-food 
category (Model 2) and Problem-food category by YFAS symptoms interaction terms (model 
3) were sequentially added as a predictor of changes in BMI. Problem-food category (PFC) 
dummy variables were computed for PFC-HFSW, PFC-HFSA and PFC-Sugar by each time  
assigning value 1 for those belonging to the one category and 0 to the others. Interaction terms 
were computed by multiplying each of the dummy variable (PFC-HFSA, PFC-HFSW or 
PFC-Sugar) with the total YFAS scores (i.e.: YFAS*PFC-HFSA). During multiple regression 
analysis, PFC-HFSA and PFC-HFSW (as well as their interaction terms) were actually 
included in the model while keeping the PFC-Sugar constant (as reference). 
To further interpret results from the hierarchical multiple regression analysis, additional 
analyses of variance (ANOVA’s) were conducted including Problem-food Category (Sugar vs 
 10 
 
HFSA vs HFSW) as between-subjects factor on YFAS symptoms and/or BMI as dependent 
variables. Only significant main or interaction effects revealed by these procedures were further 
examined by post-hoc tests. All statistics are evaluated at a two-tailed significance level of 5%. 
Data are reported as means ± SD.  
 
RESULTS 
YFAS addiction symptomatology  
The total score of YFAS symptoms endorsed during the last year (given as a continuous 
measure) ranged from 0 to 8 (mean= 1.48, SD=0.32). Figure 1 shows the percentages of 
YFAS symptoms endorsed in the total sample of respondents that reported to have at least one 
symptom (n=1414; 95%). Results reveal that in particular the symptom ‘persistent desire or 
repeated unsuccessful attempt to quit” (YFAS symptom scale 2) was the most common and 
frequently experienced symptom (93,8%), whereas the percentages for remainder symptom 
scales all fell below or around the incidence of 10%. Additionally, the prevalence of the 
categorical diagnose FA as measured by the YFAS was 12.6%.  
 
Further exploratory analysis in the group of respondents that reported having at least one 
symptom during the past year (95%, n=1414), revealed that the majority experienced such 
symptoms for the combined HFSA foods (29,5%) and HFSW foods (25%); whereas only a 
minority reported such symptoms for Sugar foods (5%) or for LFSA foods (1,8%). Further 
analysis revealed that the YFAS diagnose for FA was significantly more prevalent in 
respondents reporting to have problems for HFSW foods (4.7%) and HFSA foods (3.3%) as 
opposed to respondents reporting problems for sugar foods (0.8%) or LFSA foods (0.5%).

In addition, analysis in the group of respondents that reported having at least one symptom 
during the past year (N=1414) also revealed that 9.5% of individuals experienced 
‘withdrawal-like’ physical effects when stopping from eating the food (additional item nr 27), 
of which the majority experienced them for HFSA foods (3.8%) and HFSW foods (2.8%); 
whereas only a minority experienced this for sugar foods (1.6%) or LFSA foods (1.3%). 
Comparable results were found for ‘adaptation-like’ effects when stopping eating the food 
(additional item nr 28); of which the majority experienced this for HFSA foods (2.9%) and for 
HFSW foods (3.2%) as compared to sugar foods (1%) and LFSA foods (1.8%). ANOVA 
including problem-food category (Sugar rich vs HFSA vs HFSW) as between-subjects factor 
indeed revealed that the intensity of ‘physical withdrawal’ experiences were significantly 
higher for HFSW foods [6.5±1.5] than for sugar rich foods [6.0±2] (p=0.038) as well as for 
HFSA foods [6.6±1.2] compared to sugar rich foods (p=0.001). Also the intensity of 
‘adaptation problems’ were higher for HFSA foods (6.6±1) than for sugar rich foods [6.0±2) 
(p=0.006) as well as for HFSW foods (6.6±1.3) compared to sugar rich foods (6.0±2) 
(p=0.04).  
 
YFAS addiction symptomology & BMI  
To check for accuracy of the self-reported height and weight values during the on-line survey 
(N=1495; via the digital research platform ‘EMIUM’), half of the sample (N=786) was also 
actually measured at the University laboratory. This half of participants was only 
invited/informed for these extra measures after full completion of the on-line survey (only 
after receiving all n=1495 completed packages). Bivariate correlation analysis revealed a high 
association between BMI scores as calculated on basis of the objective laboratory measures 
and BMI scores based on self-report questionnaire data (r= 0.95: P<0.0001); indicating that 
 12 
 
current self-reported questionnaire data are highly adequate predictive measure for the actual 
BMI of the participants.  
 
Bivariate comparison between YFAS symptoms and BMI scores (n=1495) revealed a modest 
but significant positive correlation [r=0.18; P<0.0001]. Hierarchical regression analyses in 
respondents reporting at least one symptom during the past year (n=1414) revealed that when 
including YFAS symptoms as the only predictor (Model 1) it explained a small but significant 
proportion (3%) of variance in BMI scores (R2 =0.032, F(1,901)=30.523, p<0.001). When 
adding Problem-Food-Category (PFC) dummy variables (PFC-Sugar = constant) as an extra 
predictor (Model 2) the model explained 5% of variance in BMI scores (R2 =0.046, 
F(1,901)=14.358, p<0.001). After finally adding YFAS*PFC interaction terms into the model 
(Model 3, YFAS*PFC-Sugar interaction term = constant), the explanatory capacity 
significantly increased (R2change = 0.012, p=0.001) and produced a regression model that 
explained 6% of variation in BMI (R2= 0.057, F(5,901)=10,907; p<0.0001) (see Table 1). As 
the Model-3 part of Table 1 shows, the PFC-HFSA association between YFAS and BMI 
(expressed by: the YFAS*PFC-HFSA interaction term) is significantly different from the 
PFC-Sugar one at the P<0.001 level; whereas the PFC-HFSW association between YFAS and 
BMI (expressed by the YFAS*PFC-HFSW interaction term) only moderately differs from the 
PFC-Sugar one (P=0.06). Further post-hoc regression analysis for all problem-food categories 
separately indeed revealed that YFAS symptoms predicted greater BMI in participants 
reporting to experience symptoms for HFSA (R2 = 0.070, F(1,302) = 33.850; p<0.0001) and, 
to a lesser degree, for HFSW (R2 = 0.030, F(1,359) = 12.141; p = 0.001); but not in 
participants reporting YFAS symptoms for sugar (R2 = 0.007, F(1,72) = 1.489; p = 0.23).

In addition, univariate analysis of variance including problem-food category (Sugar rich vs 
HFSA vs HFSW vs LFSA) as between-subjects factor on BMI scores revealed a significant 
effect of problem-food category [F(3,898)=3.189; P=0.023], indicating significant differences 
in BMI across type of problem foods. As shown in Figure 2, BMI was highest in subjects 
reporting problems with HFSA foods (BMI= 23±3) and gradually declined across problems 
with HFSW foods (BMI= 22.4±3), sugar foods (BMI= 22.2±3) and LFSA foods (BMI= 
21.3±4).  Table 2 represents percentage of YFAS FA diagnose across weight and problem-
food categories.

Food addiction symptomology & depression  
To test whether YFAS symptomatology might change as a function of depression, a first 
regression analysis was conducted with BDI scores as predictor in the group of respondents 
having at least one YFAS symptom during the past year (n=1414). Analysis revealed a strong 
positive correlation [r=0.41; P<0.0001], indicating that an increase in BDI scores explained a 
significant proportion (17%) of variance in YFAS symptomatology (Stage 1: R2 = 0.167, 
F(1,867)=174,146; P<0.0001). When letting the regression model account for possible 
differences between the main problem-food categories Sugar, HFSA and HFSW (Stage 2: 
adding dummy interaction terms ‘HFSA x BDI’ and ‘HFSW x BDI’), BDI capacity to predict 
YFAS symptoms only increased marginally (R2change = 0.009, p=0.013), now predicting about 
18% of the variation in YFAS (F(3,865)= 61,393; p<0.0001, R2 = 0.176). Further regression 
analysis for the problem-food categories separately revealed that BDI scores only 
significantly predict increases in YFAS in participants reporting problems for HFSA (R2 = 
 14 
 
0.155, F(1,436) = 81.354; p<0.0001) and HFSW (R2 = 0.196, F(1,359) = 88.895; p<0.0001) 
but not in participants reporting problems for sugar rich foods (R2 = 0.004, F(1,72) = 1.306; p 
= 0.26).  
 
DISCUSSION 
The current study explored in a large (n=1495) sample of healthy participants the incidence of 
‘food addiction’, defined via the YFAS, for mainly sugar containing foods compared with 
other food sources, and also whether this revealed relationships with BMI and depression. 
While a majority (95%) of participants experienced at least one YFAS symptom, of which 
12% actually met the YFAS diagnosis for food addiction, these problems were mostly 
reported for the combined high-fat savoury and/or high-fat sweet foods (30%) as opposed to 
sugary specifically (5%). Moreover, there was a positive relationship between YFAS 
symptoms and increases in body weight that was only significant in participants reporting to 
have YFAS problems for HFSA and/or HFSW.  
A 12% prevalence for YFAS food addiction diagnose (FA) in the current large sample 
of n=1495 healthy college student participants is broadly consistent with previous reports (26, 
27, 31, 33, 41). On average, the prevalence of YFAS food addiction ranges between only 0-
8% in general population (31, 32) and between 20-70% in binge-eating and/or obese 
participants [see: (27, 33) for systematic reviews]. Furthermore, also consistent with previous 
studies, the most common ‘food addiction’ symptom in the current study was ‘persistent 
desire or repeated unsuccessful attempt to quit” (YFAS scale 2: >93%) whereas all the other 
symptoms were reported relatively rarely.   
 
The major aim of the current study was to explore whether YFAS ‘food addiction’ symptoms 
are more often expressed for sugary foods and whether this relates to a greater risk for weight 
 15 
 
gain. Analyses however revealed that just a minority reported food-addiction symptoms for 
sugar-sweetened specific foods (5%) whereas most participants reported to have experienced 
YFAS symptoms more frequently in relation to combined high-fat sweet and/or high-fat 
savoury foods (25-30%). In addition, FA as diagnosed by the YFAS was most prevalent in 
participants having YFAS problems related to HFSW foods and HFSA foods as compared 
with participants experiencing problems for sugary foods. Furthermore, ‘withdrawal’ and/or 
‘adaptation’ signs (included as extra items in YFAS) were more frequently reported for HFSA 
and HFSW foods than for sugar-specific foods. These results all are in line with past studies 
showing that YFAS FA is most prevalent in participants reporting high proportion of energy 
intake from fat and/or protein, or from ‘fast’ processed foods (34, 36).  
The next important question was the extent to which YFAS symptoms for sugar rich 
foods may be related to weight gain compared to YFAS symptoms expressed for other foods. 
Results first revealed that BMI significantly varied with the number of YFAS symptoms with 
BMI increasing directly as the number of ‘food-addiction’ experiences. Ample previous 
studies have already revealed that BMI scores are positively related to rates of YFAS FA (29, 
42) and/or the total number of YFAS symptoms (43); although contradictory findings have 
also been reported (44). Consequently, consistently greater prevalence of YFAS FA has been 
reported in overweight and obese samples relative to normal-weight samples [see for a 
review: (27, 33). Hence, whereas the prevalence of YFAS FA is found to range between 0-8% 
in the general population (31, 32), it has a four or more times greater prevalence of between 
20-70% (with a mean symptom count score of 3.5) in binge-eating and/or overweight and 
obese participants (27, 33). The current study extends these findings by indicating that an 
increase in BMI as a function of YFAS symptoms is most profound in individuals that 
attribute such YFAS problems to combined high-fat savoury and/or high-fat sweet foods 
rather than sugary and LF foods. This also fits the average findings from prospective cohort 
 16 
 
studies showing that HFSA foods play an equal or even greater role in weight gain and/or risk 
for obesity than sugar itself or HFSW food sources enriched with sugars (25). In addition, 
there nowadays exists consensus that palatability and/or energy density of food is a more 
determining factor for food intake and/or the risk to binge rather than that a particular type of 
macro-nutrient directly causes obesity.  
 
Interrelationships between YFAS-FA, depression symptomatology and overweight 
In support of previous findings (33), the current results revealed a high positive correlation 
between depression symptomatology (BDI scores) and YFAS symptom scores. Moreover, 
depression symptoms predicted increases in YFAS scores markedly in participants who 
reported addiction symptoms for the HFSA and/or HFSW foods. This might even suggest that 
the often reported relationship between food addiction and weight gain is mediated by 
negative affectivity and/or depression symptomatology. In support of this, studies have shown 
that around 40% of individuals increase energy intake for energy-dense high-fat sweet and/or 
savoury foods under negative mood (45-50); most likely to fulfill emotional needs (51-54), 
indicating that this ‘emotional-eating’ behavior might be major risk factor for overweight 
(50). 
 
Evidence for a sugar addiction model of binge eating and/or obesity? 
The current societal focus on foods responsible for weight gain has nowadays been shifted to 
sugar, including its suggested addictive properties. This assumption relies to a great extent on 
findings from rodent studies in which sucrose was found to cause brief moments of bingeing 
behavior (yet without affecting body weight) and concomitant stimulation of activity in brain 
dopaminergic pathways also involved in drug addiction (12, 16, 55, 56). This then has 
boosted the proposition that the animal model of sugar-bingeing provides valuable insight into 
 17 
 
the mechanisms involved in the onset and course of human obesity. Yet, ample evidence from 
human (and animal) studies fails to support the assumption that sugar differs from fat or other 
carbohydrates in equi-caloric amounts in increasing risk of overweight and obesity (25, 57-
59). Furthermore, trends for dietary sugar intake are in decline (60) whereas the prevalence of 
overweight and obesity is clearly rapidly increasing. The present results are consistent with 
the notion that food palatability and/or density, more often represented by combined HFSW 
and HFSA foods, play a more critical role in determining the reward value of food and 
promoting excessive energy intake than a particular macronutrient (10). Moreover, food 
selection and intake in human is also strongly mediated by cognitive, emotional and 
behavioural intervening factors (but this is beyond the aim of the current study). 
 
Regarding addiction, parallel the effects of drugs on dopaminergic changes by a food does not 
say anything necessarily about addiction and/or does not mean that the food is also addictive. 
First, alterations in the dopaminergic and/or opioid reward system more generally indicate a 
change in the neural circuitry involved in positive experiences and pleasure; which in human 
is also found after watching nice events (61), winning a prize (62), listening to music (63) or 
feeling love (64) and humor (65). In line, rodent dopaminergic and/or opioid changes to food 
appear to be related to palatability (reward value) rather than sweetness or nutrient per se and, 
hence, there are significant differences in neurochemical and/or electrophysiological reward 
changes caused by drugs than caused by foods or other natural rewards (20, 24). For instance, 
animal studies clearly show that dopaminergic changes caused by foods, unlike drug of abuse, 
undergo rapid adaptation and, hence, that compulsive seeking and/or continuation of 
substance (ab)use, -in spite of negative consequences,- is only found for drugs and not for 
foods like sugar (66-69). Consequently, the suggestion that sugar is addictive like a drug of 
abuse receives little support from the human literature (20, 21, 70). A more suitable 
 18 
 
conclusion is that sugar has much more in common with normal experiences of pleasure that 
cause the release of DA rather than with the effects of drugs of addiction. 
 
Critical remarks 
A first remark is that a real ‘food addiction’ is hardly to be assessed (if it exists at all) by only 
using the YFAS questionnaire. Since YFAS scores are totally based on self-report responses, 
it has also been fairly criticized for its inherent limitations concerning the diagnose for 
addiction and/or substance-related disorders (27). Like most other diagnoses of scientifically 
validated addictive disorders, ‘food addiction’ should also be based on evaluations from 
trained/experienced clinicians (and even supported by pharmacological assessment methods). 
Yet, this limitation is not restricted to the present study; in the field of human research for 
food-dependence the YFAS is currently the most frequently used method available.    
Second, since the current study focused on macro-nutrient related categorical differences 
(sugary foods vs HFS, HFSA and LFSA) the present findings cannot tell us anything about 
how palatability and/or energy-density of the different foods may relate to YFAS symptoms. 
Third, the current data does also not allow drawing conclusion about the possible rewarding 
influences of even smaller portions of (added) sugar to combined HFSW and/or HFSA foods. 
However, it seems justified to assume that if it’s the sugar it than should become most visible 
for foods mainly containing sugar. In this respect, the ‘synergy’ among different food 
ingredients rather than one typical macronutrient seems to be most important. Finally, by 
using self-report strategies for food preferences and or dependencies; it is still possible that 
the foods to which participants reported to develop a food addiction are incorrectly classified 
into the pre-defined food categories and/or product descriptions. Firm conclusions from these 
databases should therefore be (ideally) further supported xx    
 19 
 
General conclusions 
Consuming palatable energy-dense foods and drinks, including those that mainly/only contain 
sugar, can become an emotionally rewarding experience that promotes energy intake beyond 
immediate nutritional need. In particular, under adverse circumstances, this rewarding value 
of sugar food can become increasingly emotionally comforting and/or stress-releasing (37, 
38). This emotional rewarding value of sugary food will naturally be reflected by altered brain 
reward mechanisms including the endogenous opioid and/or DA systems, and will certainly 
have the potential to cause overeating. But even though this may involve comparable neuronal 
pathways that are also involved in drug use disorders; this overlap itself does not validate the 
model of ‘binge-eating and/or weight-gain by sugar-addiction’. The brain does not appear to 
respond to food and/or sugar in the same way as to drugs; and ‘addictive-like’ overeating 
seems to be distinct from drug-addiction disorders. Sugar does not seem to contribute to 
weight-gain more so than other sources of energy in the diet. Instead, the current scientific 
community nowadays seems to reach consensus that ‘food addiction’ (and its role in weight 
gain) might be better explained by ‘eating dependence’ as a result of the unique individual 
experience with food and eating (instead of being caused by a specific food).
