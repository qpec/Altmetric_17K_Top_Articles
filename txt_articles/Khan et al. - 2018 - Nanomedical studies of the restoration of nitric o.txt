Background: Clinical studies indicate that vitamin D3 improves circulation and may have 
beneficial effects in hypertension. This study uses nanomedical systems to investigate the 
role of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 in the preservation/restoration of endothelial function in an 
angiotensin II (Ang II) cellular model of hypertension. 
Methods: 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3-stimulated nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite (ONOO−) 
concentrations were measured in situ with nanosensors (200–300 mm diameter with a detec-
tion limit of 1 nM) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells of African American (AA) and 
Caucasian American (CA) donors exposed to Ang II. The balance/imbalance between NO and 
ONOO− concentrations ([NO]/[ONOO−]) was simultaneously monitored and used as an indicator 
of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling and endothelial dysfunction. 
Results: [NO]/[ONOO−] imbalance in Ang II-stimulated dysfunctional endothelium was 
0.20±0.16 for CAs and 0.11±0.09 for AAs. Uncoupled eNOS and overexpression of nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase contributed to high production of ONOO−. 
Vitamin D3 treatment reversed [NO]/[ONOO−] to 3.0±0.1 in CAs and 2.1±0.1 in AAs – exceeding 
that observed in normal endothelium. Vitamin D3 restored uncoupled eNOS and endothelial 
function by increasing cytoprotective NO and decreasing the cytotoxic ONOO−. The beneficial 
effect of vitamin D3 is associated with a favorable rate of NO and ONOO− release, restoration 
of the [NO]/[ONOO−] and the overall decrease in the overexpression of eNOS, inducible nitric 
oxide synthase and NADPH oxidase. This effect of vitamin D3 may prove to be beneficial in the 
treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, myocardial 
infarction, vasculopathy, stroke and diabetes.
Keywords: vitamin D3, hypertension, nitric oxide, peroxynitrite, endothelial dysfunction, 
nanomedicine, restoration of endothelium
Introduction
There is a large body of observational data that links vitamin D3 active metabolite 
1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 to the function of the cardiovascular system.1,2 This non-
classical effect of vitamin D3 is additional to the more classical role of vitamin D3 on 
the mineral-calcium metabolism in bone.3,4
Clinical studies suggest (somewhat inconsistently) that elevated vitamin D3 levels 
can lower arterial blood pressure.5 However, there is a strong correlation between 
insufficient serum levels of vitamin D3 that are observed in heart failure, myocardial 
infarction and elevation of arterial blood pressure.6 In cross-sectional studies (National

Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III), a deficiency in 
vitamin D3 metabolites correlated with hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, hyperglyceridemia and obesity.7
Studies carried out on vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) knock-
out and 1-α hydroxylase-deficient mouse models showed 
elevated arterial blood pressure.8,9 Other studies carried 
out on spontaneous hypertensive rats have indicated that 
vitamin D3 administration suppresses endothelium-dependent 
contraction of aorta in these models.10,11 Vitamin D3 has 
antihypertrophic, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative 
properties and may reduce cardiac hypertrophy in sponta-
neous hypertensive rats.12 Furthermore, vitamin D3 has a 
direct effect on endothelial and smooth muscle cells and 
may decrease coagulation and increase re-endothelialization 
and fibrinolysis.12
The dysfunction of endothelium in the cardiovascular 
system is a common denominator of several diseases such 
as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and heart failure – all of 
which are diseases where an insufficient level of vitamin D3 
is observed.13–15 The dysfunction of the endothelium is char-
acterized by low production of bioavailable nitric oxide16 
(NO) – a cytoprotective vasorelaxant – and a high concentra-
tion of cytotoxic vasoconstrictor, peroxynitrite (ONOO−).17 
ONOO− is one of the most powerful oxidants in the biological 
milieu, and at high concentrations ONOO− can considerably 
shift the redox balance in endothelium and negatively affect 
vascular function and hemostasis.18,19
Endothelial peroxynitrite is produced in the rapid diffusion- 
controlled reaction of superoxide (O2
−) with NO.20 There 
are two major sources of O2
− in dysfunctional endothelium: 
NADPH oxidase and uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide syn-
thase (eNOS). Partially uncoupled eNOS can concomitantly 
produce NO and O2
−, in close proximity, potentially resulting 
in high levels of ONOO−. Therefore, uncoupled eNOS can 
be a very effective generator of ONOO−, which can trigger a 
cascade of redox events leading to endothelial dysfunction.
The study presented here uses nanomedical methods 
of measurement and analysis to elucidate the role of 1,25-
dihydroxy vitamin D3 (abbreviated as vitamin D3 throughout 
the text) in the stimulation of NO and ONOO−. Normal 
and angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced dysfunctional human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) of African 
Americans (AAs) and Caucasian Americans (CAs) were 
used in this study. Nanosensors were used for the in situ 
monitoring of the concentrations of NO and ONOO− after the 
treatment of dysfunctional endothelial cells with vitamin D3. 
We developed a unique nanosystem that can be used for 
the simultaneous direct measurement in situ of bioavailable 
NO and ONOO− in single endothelial cells.21,22 No other 
currently available methods of NO and ONOO− measure-
ments (chemoluminescence, UV spectroscopy, fluorescence) 
are suitable for these kinds of measurements. The balance 
between NO concentration (NO) and ONOO− concentration 
(ONOO−) was used to evaluate the level of eNOS uncoupling 
and endothelial function/dysfunction. Vitamin D3 treatment 
can effectively restore [NO]/[ONOO−] to a level similar to 
normal endothelium for both CAs and AAs. We believe that 
the vitamin D3-stimulated improvement of endothelial func-
tion may directly benefit the treatment of the dysfunction of 
the cardiovascular system.

endothelial cell culture
HUVECs of AA (pooled, n=6, age 26±3 years) and CA 
(pooled, n=7, age 27±2 years) donors were purchased from 
Lonza (Walkersville, MD, USA). Cells were grown in T-75 
flasks (Greiner bio-one, Cat # 658175) and incubated in 
MCDB-131 complete medium (VEC technologies) at 37°C 
under 5% CO2 and 95% air and passaged every 3–4 days. 
After reaching confluence, the monolayer cells were 
trypsinized and fully detached. MCDB-131 (10 mL) com-
plete medium was then added to trypsinized cell suspension 
in order to inactivate trypsin. Cells were then centrifuged at 
1,500 rpm for 5 minutes. The cell pellet was then resuspended 
in 3 mL of fresh MCDB-131 complete media. To maintain 
the cell culture passage, 1 mL of the cell suspension was 
transferred to each of the three T-75 flasks followed by 
addition of 11 mL of fresh MCDB-131 complete media. 
For measurement, cells were resuspended in MCDB-131

Vitamin D3 improves endothelial function
and 1×105 cells were seeded in each well of 24-well cell 
culture plates.
Preparation of electrochemical 
nanosensors
NO and ONOO− nanosensors (diameter 200–300 nm) were 
prepared according to the published procedure.21,22 Briefly, 
a carbon fiber (6 µm in diameter) was inserted into a glass 
capillary (80–100 µm in diameter). The tip (8–15 µm) of 
the capillary holding protruded carbon fiber was sealed with 
mixture of bee wax and rosin, and shortened/reduced to the 
diameter of 200–300 nm by heating in propane microburners. 
The active tip of the carbon fiber was then coated by electro-
chemical polymerization of monomeric TMHPPNi to form 
a conductive polymeric film. The polymeric TMHPPNi film 
was then coated with Nafion (1% in ethanol). Similarly, the 
ONOO− nanosensor was prepared by deposition of a con-
ductive TNMPPMn polymeric film on the tip of the carbon 
fiber by cyclic voltammetry. The surface of the polymeric 
TNMPPMn sensor was then coated with poly(4-vinyl-
pyridine). The sensors were stored at room temperature in a 
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The NO and ONOO− nanosensors 
have a detection limit of 1 and 3 nmol/L, respectively, and 
can be used separately or in tandem for the simultaneous 
measurements of NO and ONOO− concentrations. Each of 
the nanosensors sample a volume of about 3–10 picoliters.
The sensor’s selectivity is based on the potential of NO or 
ONOO− oxidation/reduction, very rapid electron transfer (high 
current) generated in this reaction, as well as the preventative 
barriers for negatively charged species (NO2
−, NO3
−, dopamine, 
etc.) for the NO sensor and a barrier for positively charged 
species for the ONOO− sensor. Additionally, the response 
selectivity for NO was confirmed in separate experiments in 
the presence of inhibitor(s) of eNOS (N(G)-nitro-L-arginine 
methyl ester [L-NAME]) or scavengers of ONOO− (Mn(III) 
tetrakis) (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride. The detection 
limit of sensors is 1×10−9 mol/L for NO and 3×10−9 mol/L for 
ONOO−. The response time (limited by sensor response and 
analytical data collection system) is better than 5 µs and was 
estimated based on the response time of the sensor and pro-
cessing/storage time of analytical (electrical current) signal.
amperometric measurement of NO and 
ONOO−
Three-electrode system consisting of a platinum wire (counter 
electrode), Ag/AgCl (reference electrode) and a tandem of 
NO and ONOO− nanosensors (working electrodes) was used. 
Amperometric curves of current (proportional to concen-
tration) versus time were measured using a GAMRY dual 
potentiostat, at a potential of 0.56 V (versus Ag/AgCl) for NO 
and −0.32 V (versus Ag/AgCl) for ONOO−. HUVECs cul-
tured in a well were incubated under 5% CO2 and 95% O2 and 
allowed to grow for 1–2 days. Nanosensors were positioned at 
a well-defined and reproducible distance from the membrane 
of a single endothelial cell. X, Y and Z positions of the nano-
sensors were monitored according to the following procedure: 
first, the sensor was placed about 50 µm above endothelial 
cells, with the help of a stereotactic remote-controlled micro-
manipulator (Sexsapex, Finland) and gradually lowered 
closer to the membrane of the “sacrificial” single endothelial 
cell. When the sensor touched the membrane, a small signal 
(piezoelectric current) and a mechanically stimulated NO 
signal were recorded. The position of the sensor was assumed 
as zero distance from the cell membrane (axis Z=0). From 
Z=0, the sensor was raised about 5 µm and transferred along 
the X and Y axes (keeping the Z axis constant) and positioned 
above another endothelial cell, separated about 50–70 µm 
from the “sacrificial” cell. The “sacrificial” cell could not be 
used for further measurements because it was mechanically 
distorted by the sensor. The positioning of the nanosensor at 
the well-defined distance (5±2 µm) from the cell membrane 
is necessary to obtain reproducible results. NO concentra-
tion decreases with the increase of distance away from the 
membrane surface. A distance higher than 100 µm, NO can 
no longer be detected by the nanosensor.26
Vitamin D3 (concentration, 1 µmol/L in 0.1 mol/L phos-
phate buffer) was injected with a microinjector in a well 
and NO and/or ONOO− release was measured with a time 
response better than 5 µs. A stock solution of vitamin D3 
was prepared as follows: vitamin D3 was initially dissolved 
in several microliters of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 
subsequently diluted in water and an aqueous solution of 
0.1 mol/L of phosphate buffer. The trace amounts of DMSO 
present in aqueous stock solution of vitamin D3 did not have 
any significant effect on NO or ONOO− release.
NO and ONOO− concentration was calculated by the 
standard addition method and/or by a standard calibration 
curve for each sensor before and after measurement. The 
nitric oxide nanosensor was calibrated by using a standard 
solution (range of about 20–600 nmol/L) prepared from 
stock solution of NO (saturated solution of NO 1.8 mM) in 
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). A linear calibration curve was 
constructed from these measurements for each sensor. Also, 
a standard addition method was used to monitor the response 
of the sensor to subsequently added standard solution of 
NO. The concentration of NO standard was confirmed with 
UV-visible spectrophotometry (hemoglobin method) and/
or coulometry.

The peroxynitrite nanosensor was also calibrated in 
amperometric mode by both, the calibration curve and the 
standard addition method. The absorbance of ONOO− was 
measured in standard solution using a UV-visible spectros-
copy at a wavelength of 303 nm. The molar absorptivity 
coefficient for peroxynitrite is 1,670 M−1 cm−1. The elec-
trochemical NO or ONOO− nanosensor measured the net 
concentration of diffusible NO and ONOO−.
In a separate set of experiments, cells were incubated 
with Ang II (1 µmol/L, 1 hour) to make them dysfunctional 
and vitamin D3-stimulated NO and ONOO− were measured. 
Additionally, dysfunctional (Ang II treated) endothelial cells 
were incubated with different concentrations of vitamin D3 
before measuring NO and ONOO− in the presence or absence 
of L-arginine (eNOS substrate), VAS 2780 (NADPH 
oxidase inhibitor) or PEG-SOD (membrane-permeable 
dismutase of O2
−).
Immunoassay
For detection of our targeted proteins (eNOS, iNOS, NADPH 
oxidase), the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
was performed as per the instructions of Abcam’s protocol 
and plates were read in a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy 
HT). Protein samples were analyzed in triplicate and the 
results were recorded from absorbance at 450 nm.
statistical analysis and calculations
All data presented here are mean ± standard error, n=3–10. 
One-way analysis of variance with Student–Newman–
Keuls multiple comparisons post hoc analysis was used to 
statistically analyze the mean difference between multiple 
comparisons. A P-value of ,0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. Origin (v 6.1 for windows, originLab, 
Northampton, MA, USA) and GraphPad Prism were used 
to analyze and plot data.
Results
Typical amperograms showing changes of NO and ONOO− 
concentrations with time after stimulation of normal HUVECs 
with vitamin D3 (1 µmol/L) are shown in Figure 1A and B. 
Vitamin D3 stimulated NO release from endothelium. The 
maximal NO concentration of 370±15 nmol/L was reached

Vitamin D3 improves endothelial function
after about 7 s for CAs. For AAs, the peak of 328±21 nmol/L 
was reached after about 6 s. NO release was accompanied 
by relatively low production of ONOO−, with maximal con-
centrations of 150±12 nmol/L for CAs and 190±17 nmol/L 
for AAs. A relationship between the maximal NO con-
centration and the concentration of vitamin D3 is shown 
in Figure 1C. A linear increase in NO was observed up to 
about 1 µmol/L concentration of vitamin D3. At concentra-
tions of D3 higher than 1.5 µmol/L, the NO concentrations 
linearly decreased. A plot of the ratio of NO concentrations 
(NO) and ONOO− concentrations (ONOO−) versus the con-
centration of vitamin D3 is shown in Figure 1D. The [NO]/
[ONOO−] ratio, which reflects the balance between these two 
molecules, increased slightly, but not significantly, with the 
increase of vitamin D3 levels. However, with concentrations 
of vitamin D3 higher than 1.5 µmol/L, the ratio of [NO]/
[ONOO−] unfavorably shifted to low levels.
Figure 2A and B shows concentration changes of NO and 
ONOO− after stimulation by vitamin D3 in HUVECs treated 
with Ang II (1 µmol/L, 4 hrs) – cellular model of hypertension. 
For Ang II-treated CA endothelial cells, both maximal (NO) 
and maximal (ONOO−) changed significantly. NO decreased 
to 62±11 nmol/L, while ONOO− increased to 334±13 nmol/L. 
Maximal (NO) and (ONOO−) in AAs also changed consider-
ably: (NO) decreased to 50±5 nmol/L and (ONOO−) increased 
to 430±19 nmol/L after treatment with Ang II and indicated 
significant eNOS uncoupling. The treatment of cells with 
vitamin D3, in this cellular model of hypertension, significantly 
improved the function of eNOS and endothelium (Figure 2C 
and D). Vitamin D3 restored (NO) and diminished (ONOO−) to 
levels similar to those observed for fully functional endothelial 
cells, in both AAs and CAs.
Vitamin D3 improves NO production in 
hUVecs of cas and aas
Vitamin D3 stimulated NO release, and the rate of NO release 
was moderate in normal HUVECs (Figure 3). The rate of 
NO release was faster in normal CA cells (120±12 nmol/L s)

than in normal AA cells (80±13 nmol/L s). In contrast, the 
rate of ONOO− production was much faster in AA than in CA 
cells – about 55 and 30 nmol/L s, respectively. Ang II treatment 
slowed the rate of NO release by about 70%–75% for both 
CAs and AAs. As expected, the rate of ONOO− generation 
increased by about 80%. Vitamin D3 restored the rate of NO 
release and significantly decreased the rate of ONOO− produc-
tion to a level similar to that observed in normal CA and AA 
cells. Vitamin D3 treatment significantly increased maximal 
NO concentration as compared to Ang II-treated HUVECs 
for both ethnic groups (Figure 4). [NO] increased linearly 
with the time of incubation with vitamin D3. The increase in

Vitamin D3 improves endothelial function
the level of NO with vitamin D3 treatment was accompanied 
with a linear decrease of ONOO−. After 4 hours of incuba-
tion with vitamin D3, the concentration of NO increased by 
about 5 times, while there was an inverse fivefold decrease 
observed with ONOO− after the same incubation period. The 
beneficial effects of vitamin D3 was observed for both CA 
and AA HUVECs that were treated with Ang II (1 µmol/L).
Vitamin D3 improves the [NO]/[ONOO−] 
in hUVecs of cas and aas
To evaluate the status of endothelial function, we used the 
ratio of NO to ONOO− concentration [NO]/[ONOO−]. The 
ratio of [NO]/[ONOO−] reflects on the relative balance 
between cytoprotective NO and cytotoxic ONOO−.
In Ang II cellular model of hypertension, [NO]/
[ONOO−] was 0.20±0.16 for CA and 0.11±0.09 for AA 
cells (Figure 5A and B). After 1 hour of treatment with 
vitamin D3, there was an increase in the [NO]/[ONOO−] ratio 
to 0.70±0.05 for both CAs and AAs. The increase in [NO]/
[ONOO−] ratio was linear with vitamin D3 incubation time 
and reached a maximum of 3.0±0.1 for CAs and 2.10±0.11 
for AAs after 4 hours, which exceeded the ratio observed in 
normal HUVECs. In normal HUVECs studied, the [NO]/
[ONOO−] ratio was 2.5±0.2 and 1.7±0.2 for CA and AA 
cells, respectively (Figure 5C and D).

eNOS inhibitor, does not have a significant effect on [NO]/
[ONOO−]. However, at elevated concentrations of L-arginine 
(eNOS substrate) a substantial increase of the [NO]/[ONOO−] 
was observed. A similar increase in [NO]/[ONOO−] was 
also observed in the presence of sepiapterin, which is a 
precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin – an important cofactor 
in stabilizing eNOS dimer. An inhibitor of NADPH (VAS 
2870) also significantly increased [NO]/[ONOO−] to the 
level observed in the presence of L-arginine or sepiapterin. 
The changes of [NO]/[ONOO−] due to cofactors, inhibitors 
and substrates were slightly more pronounced in CA cells 
than in AA cells.
Vitamin D3 downregulates expression 
of NaDPh oxidase, eNOs and iNOs in 
cultured hUVecs of cas and aas
We hypothesized that the overexpression of NADPH 
oxidase, eNOS and iNOS may play a role in an unfavor-
able shift in the [NO]/[ONOO−] balance and endothelial 
function.
After 4 hours of incubation of HUVECs with Ang II, 
the eNOS expression was significantly upregulated in CAs 
and slightly in AAs (Figure 6A). Ang II further upregulated 
eNOS in HUVECs of both ethnic groups, and this effect was 
very significant after 12 hours of incubation. In contrast, 
vitamin D3 treatment downregulated eNOS expression in 
HUVECs of both ethnic groups. This effect was highly sig-
nificant after 12 hours of incubation with vitamin D3.
iNOS expression can be upregulated due to oxidative 
and nitroxidative stresses and/or inflammation. There-
fore, we estimated iNOS expression in both Ang II- and 
vitamin D3-treated HUVECs. Ang II significantly upregu-
lated expression of iNOS in HUVECs of both ethnic groups 
versus control groups after 4 and 12 hours of incubation 
(Figure 6B). Treatment with vitamin D3 downregulated the 
expression of iNOS in HUVECs of both ethnic groups.
Ang II had minimal effect on the NADPH oxidase 4 
expression after 4 hours of incubation; however, NADPH oxi-
dase expression was upregulated after 12 hours (Figure 6C), 
indicating the effect of Ang II on the expression of enzymes

Vitamin D3 improves endothelial function
responsible for O2
−-induced oxidative stress. Vitamin D3 
treatment significantly downregulated the expression of 
NADPH oxidase in HUVECs of both ethnic groups. The 
effect of vitamin D3 was more pronounced in HUVECs 
of AAs than in those of CAs. These results indicate that 
vitamin D3 may particularly protect endothelial cells from 
NADPH-generated O2
−, and oxidative stress may reduce 
ONOO− formation and improve endothelial function.
Discussion
The nanomedical system utilized in these studies offers a 
unique opportunity to monitor in situ, the near real-time 
molecular changes of two signaling molecules, NO and 
ONOO−, produced by endothelial cells. The production of 
ONOO− increases with the increased rate of NO release. 
Therefore, any rapid stimulation of NO could be considered 
unfavorable for endothelial function due to the potential 
uncoupling of eNOS and enhanced ONOO− generation. 
Therefore, a modest rate of vitamin D3-stimulated NO 
release is of crucial importance to the proper function of 
endothelium and the cardiovascular system. This is one of 
the important findings of this study. Here, we used Ang II to 
produce dysfunctional endothelium, similar to that observed 
in hypertension. Treatment with vitamin D3, in this cellular 
model of hypertension, significantly restored bioavailable 
NO with the concomitant decrease in nitroxidative stress 
that is associated with high ONOO−. The moderate NO 
production by vitamin D3 does not cause eNOS uncoupling. 
As a net result, vitamin D3 maintains a favorably high ratio 
of [NO]/[ONOO−] in the endothelium with a relatively high 
concentration of cytoprotective vasorelaxant NO and a 
relatively low level of cytotoxic vasoconstrictor ONOO−.24 
This favorable kinetics of NO generation and the subsequent 
low production of ONOO− after stimulation with vitamin D3 
are crucial factors in the process of restoring dysfunctional 
endothelium.
In long-term (hours) treatment, vitamin D3 effectively 
reversed the imbalance between [NO] and [ONOO−] in Ang II 
cellular model of hypertension. Importantly, vitamin D3 
restored eNOS coupling in dysfunctional HUVECs in both 
CAs and AAs as evidenced by increased NO bioavailability 
and reduced nitroxidative stress. The uncoupling of eNOS 
was significantly higher in AAs than in CAs, as indicated 
by [NO]/[ONOO−]. However, treatment with vitamin D3 
produces proportional results for both ethnic groups. 
There was no significant difference in the % of [NO] and 
[ONOO−] changes between AAs and CAs versus control 
group. A decrease in the expression of eNOS, as well as 
NADPH oxidase, that occurs after vitamin D3 treatment of 
the Ang II model of hypertension is an important factor in 
the overall restoration of endothelial function. Even a small 
decrease in eNOS expression improved the availability of 
substrates (especially L-arginine) and other cofactors, and 
more effectively stabilized (coupled) eNOS dimer, prevent-
ing the generation of significant O2
− by this enzyme.
The dominating product of coupled eNOS dimer is NO, 
while in the uncoupled dimer of eNOS, a rapid direct one-
electron transfer to oxygen produces O2
−. NO is the most 
effective scavenger of O2
−, which produces ONOO− in a 
diffusion-controlled reaction.23,24 Therefore, vitamin D3 treat-
ment actively reduced endothelial production of O2
− from 
two major sources: NADPH oxidase and uncoupled eNOS. 
The efficiency of O2
− production by uncoupled eNOS in dys-
functional endothelium can be comparable to that generated 
by NADPH. Vitamin D3 simultaneously decreases the level 
of O2
− generated by these two sources, by reducing the level of 
NADPH on one side and then by limiting the generation 
of O2
− from coupled eNOS dimer on the other side.
This effect accounts for the reduction of oxidative/
nitroxidative stress and the overall increase in bioavailable 
NO – both a highly beneficial effect of vitamin D3 treatment 
on endothelium and the cardiovascular system. The process 
of restoring bioavailable NO production by vitamin D3 is 
more efficient and comprehensive than other possible path-
ways of the restoration of dysfunctional endothelium, like 
elevated levels of L-arginine, sepiapterin treatment, scav-
enging or dismutase of O2
−. As shown here, L-arginine, 
sepiapterin or NADPH inhibition can only partially restore 
(20%–30%) endothelial function under physiologically 
acceptable concentrations.
In this study, we used the [NO]/[ONOO−] ratio as a pre-
cise indicator of eNOS coupling/uncoupling and endothelial 
function/dysfunction.25 In normal, functional endothelium, 
the [NO]/[ONOO−] ratio varies from 2 to 5.26 At an [NO]/
[ONOO−] level of ,2, the eNOS is considered partially 
uncoupled. When the [NO]/[ONOO−] ratio falls below 1, 
uncoupled eNOS become the dominant factor in the pro-
duction of O2
− and the highly efficient generator of ONOO−. 
Therefore, when the [NO]/[ONOO−] ratio is below 1, ONOO− 
is the main determinant of the oxidative/nitroxidative stress 
in endothelium. The nanomedical approach used in this study 
allowed us to directly measure in situ, with a time resolution 
of better than 5 ms, the concentration of NO and ONOO− in 
normal/fully functional and dysfunctional endothelium. 
In the HUVECs studied here, the initial [NO]/[ONOO−] was 
2.5±0.2 and 1.7±0.2 for CAs and AAs, respectively. As we

Khan et al
have shown in a previous study, the eNOS uncoupling is 
more advanced in AAs than in CAs.17 Treatment with Ang II 
further increased eNOS uncoupling, which was reflected by 
a decrease in [NO]/[ONOO−] ratio to 0.20±0.16 for CAs and 
0.11±0.09 for AAs. This suggests that potential damage to 
endothelial function imposed by Ang II in hypertension is 
more severe in AAs than in CAs. It is interesting to note 
that the treatment of endothelial cells of AAs (Ang II cel-
lular model of hypertension) with vitamin D3 significantly 
improved the [NO]/[ONOO−] ratio above the original levels 
observed in normal functioning HUVECs of CAs and AAs. 
The [NO]/[ONOO−] gradually increased in both groups after 
1–4 hours of vitamin D3 treatment.
The balance/imbalance of [NO]/[ONOO−] is influenced 
by NO, O2
− and ONOO−; coupled/uncoupled eNOS, iNOS 
and NADPH oxidase. All of these molecules and their 
sources may contribute to shift in oxidative/nitroxidative 
stress and bioavailability of NO. Upregulated expression of 
these three enzymes may lead to excessive oxidative stress 
in cellular environment, which effectively diminished the 
level of bioavailable NO. Furthermore, upregulation in 
the expression of iNOS, which is usually associated with 
inflammation, can contribute to this unfavorable effect. By 
design, iNOS is a secondary source of NO synthesis when 
there is a shortage of the NO generated by eNOS. High NO 
production by iNOS depletes L-arginine levels and acceler-
ates the further uncoupling of eNOS and makes the recovery 
of eNOS dimer even more difficult. Additionally, the NO 
produced from iNOS contributes minimally to the overall 
level of bioavailable NO, but has a significant effect on the 
overall increase of ONOO− due to the scavenging of O2
−. This 
further exposes the cellular environment to severe oxidative 
and nitroxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Also, 
excessive O2
− and ONOO− can oxidize tetrahydrobiopterin, 
BH4, an important cofactor of eNOS and a stabilizer of eNOS 
dimer.27,28 In the absence of BH4, eNOS produces mostly O2
−. 
Supplementation of L-arginine and/or sepiapterin (precursor 
of BH4) improved endothelial function by diminishing O2
− 
and ONOO− concentrations.
Our study provides direct molecular insight to previ-
ously published observations that have suggested that 
vitamin D3 deficiency-induced hypertension is associated 
with vascular oxidative stress.29 It is well documented that 
oxidative stress is involved in vascular complications and 
development of hypertension.30 Oxidative and nitroxida-
tive stress impairs endothelium-dependent relaxation of the 
blood vessels and is involved in the facilitation of smooth 
muscles contractions.31–33 It has been suggested that oxidative 
stress is the main source of endothelial damage, and that it is 
generated by NADPH oxidase – one of the key enzymes of 
facilitating oxidative stress. We found here that the contri-
butions of NADPH to the total oxidative stress is dominant 
in the initial stage of endothelial dysfunction. However, 
in severely dysfunctional endothelium, the contribution of 
NADPH to the total O2
− was less than that generated from 
uncoupled eNOS (40% and 60%, respectively). Results of 
the studies presented here are coherent with and comple-
mentary to the results of previous observations. Scavengers 
and inhibitors of oxidative and nitroxidative stress partially 
prevent the dysfunction of endothelium.34 It has been sug-
gested that protective effect of AT1R blockers, the major 
class of antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension, 
is associated with their antioxidative action.35,36
In SHR, it has been found that vitamin D3 reduces 
the expression of NADPH oxidase in the vasculature.37 
Vitamin D3 treatment of renal arteries of hypertensive 
patients showed improved endothelial function and reduction 
in oxidative stress.37 It was suggested that the downregulation 
of NADPH oxidase and the upregulation of SOD1 and SOD2 
may be responsible for this effect.37 Our studies support and 
confirm this hypothesis.
Based on clinical studies, it has been suggested that 
vitamin D3 may improve NO, modulate vascular tone 
and lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension.29 
However, none of these studies provided any direct proof 
of how vitamin D3 improves NO production and decreases 
nitroxidative stress. Our studies are not only coherent with 
previous observations, but provide new direct evidence, on 
the molecular level, why vitamin D3 can be highly beneficial 
for the treatment of a dysfunctional cardiovascular system. 
We proved here by direct NO measurements that vitamin D3 
stimulated NO release within the first second of its exposure 
to endothelial cells. This rapid response of endothelium to 
vitamin D3 suggests that this process is most likely controlled 
by VDRs that are present on endothelial cell membrane,38 and 
is followed by the signal transduction through the calcium–
calmodulin pathway. We suggest that the beneficial action 
of vitamin D3 on the cardiovascular system can be explained 
solely based on the enhanced effect on endothelial NO levels 
and its depreciative effect on ONOO− levels.
While the beneficial effects of vitamin D3 on dysfunc-
tional eNOS and endothelium is well supported by this 
research, the effect of a high level of vitamin D3 on normal 
cells will require more studies to establish the potential for 
an unfavorable shift of [NO]/[ONOO−] to a level higher 
than 5. The ideal ratio of NO to ONOO− for fully functional

Vitamin D3 improves endothelial function
endothelium varies from 3 to 5 and depends on the location 
of the endothelial cells in the vasculature. Generally, at [NO]/
[ONOO−] higher than 7, the NO may become a dominating 
factor, which can potentially lead to excessive production 
of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, excessive smooth and 
cardiac muscle relaxation and a dramatic decrease in blood 
pressure. Therefore, one can expect that excessive vitamin D3 
treatment of fully functional endothelial cells may produce 
risk for the cardiovascular system.
The studies presented here strongly indicate that 
vitamin D3 restores endothelial function by balancing [NO]/
[ONOO−], increasing bioavailable NO and reducing oxida-
tive and nitroxidative stress in HUVECs, thus confirming the 
potential role of vitamin D3 in the prevention and/or treatment 
of vascular complications. The improvement in the [NO]/
[ONOO−] by vitamin D3 is mainly due to the restoration of 
eNOS coupling and decrease in eNOS, iNOS and NADPH 
expressions. Vitamin D3 does not significantly scavenge 
for superoxide or peroxynitrite but attenuates oxidative/
nitroxidative stress and increases NO bioavailability by 
transcriptional regulation of the enzymes responsible for 
generating them. The net result is a decrease of the expres-
sion of iNOS and eNOS in the cellular environment. At low 
eNOS and iNOS expression, the available concentrations of 
major substrate, L-arginine and cofactor (BH4) become more 
available for eNOS coupling.
Therefore, these studies are the first to identify the molec-
ular mechanism of vitamin D3-triggered restoration of the 
function of eNOS and the function of endothelial cells in the 
cardiovascular system. While these studies were performed 
using a cellular model of hypertension, the implications of 
the influence of vitamin D3 on dysfunctional endothelium is 
much broader. The dysfunction of endothelium is a common 
denominator of several cardiovascular diseases, particularly 
those associated with ischemic events. Therefore, we suggest 
that vitamin D3 treatment may be of clinical importance in the 
restoration of dysfunctional cardiac endothelium after heart 
ischemia, capillary endothelium after brain ischemia, hypo-
volemia, vasculopathy, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Our 
suggestion is strongly supported by several clinical studies 
indicating that vitamin D3, at doses significantly higher than 
those currently used for the treatment of bone diseases, can 
be highly beneficial for the treatment of the dysfunctional 
cardiovascular system.
