Essentials
• Observational data suggest taller people have a higher
risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE).
• We used Mendelian randomization techniques to fur-
ther explore this association in three studies.
• Risk of VTE increased by 30–40% for each 10 cm
increment in height.
• Height was more strongly associated with deep vein
thrombosis than with pulmonary embolism.
Summary. Background: Taller height is associated with a
greater risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Objec-
tives: To
use
instrumental
variable
(IV)
techniques
(Mendelian randomization) to further explore this relation-
ship. Methods: Participants of European ancestry were
included from two cohort studies (Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities [ARIC] study and Cardiovascular Health
Study [CHS]) and one case–control study (Mayo Clinic
VTE Study [Mayo]). We created two weighted genetic risk
scores (GRSs) for height; the full GRS included 668 single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a previously pub-
lished meta-analysis, and the restricted GRS included a
subset of 362 SNPs not associated with weight indepen-
dently of height. Standard logistic regression and IV mod-
els were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for VTE per
10-cm increment in height. ORs were pooled across the
three studies by the use of inverse variance-weighted ran-
dom effects meta-analysis. Results: Among 9143 ARIC
and 3180 CHS participants free of VTE at baseline, there
were 367 and 109 incident VTE events. There were 1143
VTE cases and 1292 controls included from Mayo. The
pooled ORs from non-IV models and models using the full
and restricted GRSs as IVs were 1.27 (95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.11–1.46), 1.34 (95% CI 1.04–1.73) and 1.45
(95% CI 1.04–2.01) per 10-cm greater height, respec-
tively. Conclusions: Taller height is associated with an
increased risk of VTE in adults of European ancestry. Pos-
sible explanations for this association, including taller peo-
ple having a greater venous surface area, a higher number
of venous valves, or greater hydrostatic pressure, need to
be explored further.

Introduction
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein
thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), occurs
in 350 000–600 000 people and contributes to > 100 000
deaths in the USA each year [1]. Taller adult height is
associated with a greater risk of VTE [2–11]. For exam-
ple, the Longitudinal Investigation of Thromboembolism
Etiology (LITE) found that each 6.3-cm increment in

 height was independently associated with a 1.14 (95%
confidence interval [CI] 1.05–1.24) greater risk of VTE
[9].
The
physiologic
mechanism
underpinning
this
increased risk is not yet fully understood; some proposed
mechanisms include greater venous surface area, a higher
number of venous valves and greater hydrostatic pressure
in taller people [9].
It is possible that uncontrolled confounding by other
risk factors explains the association of height with VTE,
so additional techniques for causal inference would be
useful to pursue. Genome-wide association studies have
found many genetic variants related to height [12–20].
The most recent meta-analysis, by Wood et al., found
that
697
single-nucleotide
polymorphisms
(SNPs)
explained 20% of the heritability (and 16% of the overall
variance) of height [20]. The high amount of variance in
height explained by these SNPs, which should not be
influenced
by
traditional
confounding
factors
or
by
reverse causality, provides a unique opportunity to apply
Mendelian randomization methods to explore the rela-
tionship between height and VTE. We used SNPs from
the Wood et al. meta-analysis [20] as an instrumental
variable (IV) for height, allowing us to better estimate the
association between height and risk of VTE. We imple-
mented these techniques in three separate studies (the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities [ARIC] study, the
Cardiovascular Health Study [CHS], and the Mayo Clinic
VTE Study [Mayo]), and then combined these results by
using meta-analytic techniques.
Methods
Study population
LITE is a combination of two population-based cohort
studies: the ARIC study [21] and CHS [22]. The study
design and methods of LITE have been described previ-
ously [23,24]. Briefly, the ARIC study began in 1987–1989
with enrollment of 15 792 men and women aged 45–
64 years, who were predominantly black or white, and
performed follow-up examinations in 1990–1992, 1993–
1995, 1996–1998, and 2011–2013, in addition to yearly
telephone contacts. The CHS began in 1989–1990 with
enrollment of 5201 mostly white men and women aged
≥ 65 years; an additional 687 African Americans were
enrolled in the CHS in 1992–1993. Over the first 10 years
of the study, participants in the CHS were contacted
every 6 months by use of a telephone interview or clinic
visit, and then by telephone interview every 6 months
thereafter. Mayo is a case–control study of outpatients,
including
VTE
cases
referred
to
the
Mayo
Clinic
(n = 1503)
and
controls
undergoing
general
medical
examinations at the Mayo Clinic (n = 1459). Cases and
controls were selected for study participation from 1994
to 2009 and from 2004 to 2009, respectively, with fre-
quency matching on age, sex, state of residence, and prior
myocardial infarction and stroke status [25]. Each study
was approved by the institutional review board of its par-
ticipating study center, and all participants provided writ-
ten informed consent.
Height and covariate measurement
Baseline standing height was measured by trained techni-
cians with participants standing as straight as possible
without shoes and with back and heels against a vertical
mounted centimeter ruler, to the nearest centimeter in
ARIC and the nearest half-centimeter in the CHS. Weight
was measured with a balance scale. Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as weight (in kilograms) divided by
height (in meters) squared. Waist circumference was mea-
sured at the level of the umbilicus to the nearest centime-
ter. In order to confirm that potential confounders were
not associated
with the
IV for
height
(a necessary
assumption for a valid IV), we additionally considered
other measured risk factors for VTE. Blood samples were
drawn by staff, and blood measurements were performed
in study-specific central laboratories. Diabetes was defined
as
a
fasting
blood
glucose
level
of
≥ 7 mmol L�1
(≥ 126 mg dL�1), a non-fasting blood glucose level of
≥ 11.1 mmol L�1 (≥ 200 mg dL�1), a self-reported physi-
cian’s diagnosis of diabetes, or reported use of a diabetes
medication. The glomerular filtration rate was estimated
from creatinine with an existing algorithm [26]. Fac-
tor VIII and activated partial thromboplastin time (avail-
able in ARIC only) were assessed as previously described
[27,28]. C-reactive protein was measured with a high-sen-
sitivity immunoassay on visit 2 (1990–1992) plasma sam-
ples in ARIC [29] and on baseline plasma samples in the
CHS [30]. In Mayo, height and weight were ascertained
by self-report at the time of study enrollment for both
cases and controls, and BMI was calculated as weight (in
kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared.
VTE occurrence
Hospitalizations were identified by participants or proxy
reports during annual contact by telephone in ARIC and
semi-annual contact by telephone or clinic visit in the
CHS. Additional hospitalizations were found in ARIC
through 2011 and in the CHS through 2001 by surveillance
of local hospital discharge lists and Medicare records,
respectively. Copies of hospital records were obtained for
hospitalizations with International Classification of Dis-
ease discharge codes indicating possible VTE events [23].
Validation of VTE events was performed by two physi-
cians using standardized criteria requiring positive imaging
test results for diagnoses of DVT and PE [23]. VTE events
in Mayo were initially identified by a physician in the
hematology clinic, and were validated by the use of imag-
ing tests or by pathologic examination of a surgically
removed thrombus, as described previously [31]. DVT

 events in ARIC and the CHS were restricted to those
occurring in the lower extremity or vena cava. DVT events
in Mayo also included those occurring in the arm.
Genotyping and imputation
Details on genotyping, quality control and imputation
have been described previously [25,32,33]. Briefly, geno-
typing was performed in ARIC, the CHS and Mayo with
the
Affymetrix 6.0,
Illumina
370CNV
and
Illumina
Human 660W Quad genome-wide SNP arrays, respec-
tively. Before imputation, samples were filtered on the
basis of call rates, and SNPs were filtered on the basis of
call rates, allele frequencies, and Hardy–Weinberg equilib-
rium P-values (Table S1). Imputation to ≈ 2.5 million
autosomal SNPs in the HapMap Phase II sample of
European ancestry (CEU) was performed with MACH [34]
v1.0.16 in ARIC and Mayo, and with BIMBAM [35] v0.99
in the CHS.
Genetic instrument for height
The 697 height-related SNPs and their respective weights
used for creating the weighted genetic risk score (GRS)
IV were obtained from a genome-wide association meta-
analysis study of height in 253 288 people of European
ancestry [20]. The SNP weights are external to Mayo, but
are not external to ARIC and the CHS, as the two latter
studies were included in the original meta-analysis (to-
gether, ARIC and the CHS comprised 11 338 [4.5%] of
the total sample of 253 288). In order to minimize possi-
ble linkage disequilibrium among SNPs selected for the
GRS, we excluded one of two SNPs from any correlated
pair of SNPs with r2 > 0.1 as listed in Table S1 from
Wood et al. [20] (the first of the two correlated SNPs was
excluded on the basis of the listed order). We found that
29 SNPs were in possible linkage disequilibrium, leaving
a total of 668 SNPs with which to create the ‘full GRS’
(see Table S2, Column A for the list of SNPs used in the
full GRS). Exploratory analyses indicated that the full
GRS was associated with weight, independently of height,
in ARIC and the CHS (violating a key IV assumption);
therefore, as a secondary analysis, we created a ‘restricted
GRS’ that was uncorrelated with weight independently of
height. The set of SNPs used to create the restricted GRS
was determined with the ARIC cohort; in linear regres-
sion
models
(separately
for
each
SNP),
weight
was
regressed on each SNP and height, and the 306 SNPs
showing the most statistically significant associations with
weight (P < 0.4) independently of height were excluded.
This a-level was chosen because it was the smallest cut-
off for which the restricted GRS was no longer associated
with weight independently of height in ARIC. This left a
subset of 362 SNPs (see Table S2, Column B for the list
of SNPs used in the restricted GRS). Each GRS was cre-
ated
by
taking
∑ (b-value 9 estimated
no.
of
allele
copies) over all of the SNPs, by use of the b-values listed
in Column G of Table S1 from Wood et al. [20].
Statistical analysis
Only persons of European ancestry who provided written
informed consent for DNA testing were included in this
study. In ARIC and the CHS, respectively, there were
9349 and 3362 eligible participants with genotyping data
available; we excluded those who had missing height
information (n = 5 and n = 6), reported a VTE prior to
baseline (n = 160 and n = 165), or were taking anticoagu-
lants at baseline (n = 41 and n = 11), leaving a maximum
of 9143 and 3180 participants for the present analyses,
respectively. In Mayo, there were 2552 eligible partici-
pants with genotyping data available; after exclusion of
those who had missing height information (n = 117),
there was a maximum of 2435 participants for the present
analyses.
To assess the strength of the GRS IVs, we used the
F-statistic from a linear model regressing height on the
GRS. If the GRS was associated with risk factors for
VTE other than height, it would violate the assumptions
necessary for the IV analysis. To assess this, we estimated
the
proportion
of
variance
(R2)
of
each
covariate
explained by the GRS by using linear regression. For
Mayo, we used only controls to assess the association
between covariates and the GRS, because VTE is a rela-
tively rare disease, and we considered the controls to be a
better representation of the general population than the
combined group of cases and controls [36].
To examine the possibility of a non-linear relationship
between height and VTE, we initially fitted logistic regres-
sion models with VTE as the outcome and modeled
height by using restricted cubic splines. As the association
between VTE and height was approximately linear in the
logit scale (Fig. S1), we did not transform height in sub-
sequent analyses. We estimated odds ratios (OR) and
95% CIs for VTE per 10-cm increment in height by using
three separate logistic models. The first model was non-
IV logistic regression-adjusted for age, sex, BMI and
study site in ARIC and the CHS, and for age, sex, BMI,
Minnesota residence and history of stroke and myocardial
infarction in Mayo (to obtain valid effect estimates, mod-
els using matched case–control data should be adjusted
for the matching variables). The other two models were
IV logistic structural mean models using a generalized
method of moments estimator [37], with the full GRS and
restricted GRS as the IVs for height in each respective
model. Each of these models was fitted separately to each
of the three datasets. IV models using the full GRS and
restricted GRS as the IVs were also used for DVT
and PE separately. IV models were unadjusted for ARIC
and the CHS, and were adjusted for the study matching
variables for Mayo. As an alternative to using the
restricted GRS IV model, we fitted a model using the full

 GRS as the IV and adjusted for weight as a covariate in
order to assess the possibility that weight mediates the
height–VTE association.
Although using a GRS as an IV typically avoids the
problem of weak instrument bias, using the variants that
comprise the GRS as individual IVs may result in differ-
ent effect estimates [38]. Thus, we performed sensitivity
analyses to test for the influence of bias from potential
directional pleiotropy or heterogeneity of individual SNP
IVs by using three robust IV methods: inverse variance-
weighted
(IVW),
MR-Egger
regression
and
weighted
median estimation [38,39]. Summary IV estimates and
standard errors for each SNP (obtained with the ratio
estimator [40]) were analyzed with the STATA package MR-
ROBUST to obtain robust IV OR estimates for the full and
restricted set of SNPs for each of the three studies.
Evidence for directional pleiotropy or heterogeneity of
individual IV estimates was assessed by evaluating the I2
index and Q-test [41] from the IVW analysis, and the sig-
nificance of the intercept term from MR-Egger regression,
as well as by visual inspection of funnel plots for asym-
metry. The standard errors used in the funnel plots were
estimated with the delta method [42].
For each of the three sets of results for the main VTE
analysis, four sets of results for the DVT and PE analysis,
and six sets of results for the sensitivity analysis, IVW
random effects meta-analysis was performed to obtain a
pooled OR and 95% CI across the three studies. Analyses
were performed in
STATA, version 12.1 (ARIC and the
CHS), and R, version 3.1.1 (Mayo) [43,44].
Results
Baseline characteristics are summarized for ARIC and the
CHS in Table 1 and for Mayo in Table 2. Notably, par-
ticipants in the CHS were, on average, older and shorter
than those in ARIC and Mayo, and the mean BMI was
higher in Mayo participants than in ARIC and CHS par-
ticipants. In each study, height was strongly associated
with the IVs (all F-statistics > 105 and > 63 for the full
and restricted GRS, respectively, where F < 10 is indica-
tive of a weak IV [45]; Tables 1 and 2). Other anthropo-
metric
factors,
including
BMI,
weight,
and
waist
circumference, were also associated with the full or
restricted GRS IVs (Tables 1 and 2). However, these
anthropometric covariates were not associated with the
restricted
GRS
IV
after
adjustment
for
height
(all
P-values > 0.2; however, adjustment for height could
potentially create bias). The GRS IVs were also not gen-
erally associated with other common VTE risk factors in
the three different studies (Tables 1 and 2). Additionally,
a separate GRS for VTE, consisting of five SNPs in F5
(Leiden), F2, F11, FGG and ABO [46], was not associated
with the full or restricted GRS IVs in ARIC (R2 = 0.00;
P > 0.5).
Among 9143 ARIC and 3180 CHS participants, there
were 367 and 109 incident VTE events after 23 years and
12 years of follow-up, respectively. There were 1143 VTE
cases and 1292 controls included from Mayo. When the
study-specific non-IV logistic regression model results
were combined, the summary OR for VTE per 10-cm

There was slightly less precision in the estimate of the
pooled OR when the restricted GRS IV was used, poten-
tially because inclusion of fewer SNPs resulted in a
weaker instrument. The summary OR obtained from the
full GRS IV model additionally adjusted for weight was
slightly attenuated (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.96–1.61). When
study-specific
IV
model
results
obtained
with
the
restricted GRS IV were combined, height was associated
slightly more strongly with DVT (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.98–
2.16) than with PE (OR 1.20, 0.79–1.82) (Fig. S2).
The results from sensitivity analyses using robust IV
estimators that take a weighted summary of the individ-
ual effects of the SNPs are shown in Fig. S3. When the
set of 362 restricted SNPs were used as individual IVs,
the summary OR obtained with MR-Egger regression
(OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.99–1.82; I2 = 0) was similar to the
estimate obtained when the restricted GRS was used as a
single IV. By comparison, the summary ORs obtained
with
IVW
(OR 1.15,

and

methods were attenuated. Within each study, there was
little to no evidence of heterogeneity between SNP IVs in
the full or restricted set of SNPs in IVW models (I2 from
0% to 7%; all Q-test P-values ≥ 0.16; Figs S4–S9]. Fun-
nel plots did not show obvious evidence of heterogeneity
or directional pleiotropy when either set of SNPs was
used, and this
was supported by formal testing
of
MR-Egger regression intercept terms in ARIC and Mayo
(P-values > 0.2) but not in the CHS (P-values ≤ 0.02; see

Discussion
In this meta-analysis, we found a consistent positive rela-
tionship between height and VTE, whether we estimated
the association of height with VTE by using standard
logistic regression and adjusting for relevant confounders,
or used IV analysis with a single weighted GRS, which
suggested that the risk of VTE increased by approxi-
mately 30–40% for each 10-cm increment in height. Sensi-
tivity analyses using robust IV methods with multiple IVs
(i.e. individual SNPs) generally supported our main find-
ings; however, the associations were attenuated.
Previous studies have found that taller height is associ-
ated with lower risk of most cardiovascular disease out-
comes and total mortality [10], but taller height is
associated with higher risks of VTE [2–11], atrial fibrilla-
tion [47], and abdominal aortic aneurysm [48]. Previous
Mendelian
randomization
analyses
provide
additional
support for an association of taller height with a lower
risk of coronary heart disease [49,50] but not with the risk
of stroke [49]. To our knowledge, this is the first study
using Mendelian randomization to identify taller height
as a risk factor for VTE.
Vessel wall damage, blood flow changes and hypercoag-
ulability are the three important factors for the pathogene-
sis of thrombosis [51]. A recent analysis in LITE found
that the association of height with VTE risk was not medi-
ated by markers of hemostasis or inflammation, suggesting
that taller height more likely influences VTE risk through
greater venous area, venous stasis or vessel wall damage
than through hypercoagulability [52]. Taller height is a risk
factor for various types of cancer [53], which is another
key risk factor for VTE. However, the non-IV OR for
VTE was unchanged after exclusion of 112 cancer-pro-
voked VTE cases in ARIC (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.18–1.79)
per 10-cm increment in height), and active cancer was an
exclusion criterion in Mayo. Thus, it is unlikely that cancer
(and its effects on hypercoagulability) acts as a mediator
of the association between height and VTE. Taller height
is associated with higher resting venous pressure during
quiet standing in healthy people [54]. Over time, this
higher pressure could lead to more damage to venous walls
and thereby a greater VTE risk. Also, taller people have a
greater venous surface area and, possibly, more venous
valves, allowing for a greater area in which thrombi can
form. Indeed, the majority of thrombi form in valve pock-
ets of the deep veins in lower limbs, where blood flow is
stagnant [55]. This is supported by our finding of a stron-
ger association of height with DVT than with PE.
Our ability to estimate the effect of height on VTE risk
depends on the validity of our IV. In the context of this
study, the three assumptions of a valid IV are that it: (i)
is associated with height; (ii) is not associated with any
confounder of the height–VTE association; and (iii) is
conditionally independent of VTE, given height and con-
founders. Although we found that assumption (i) was sat-
isfied, it is not possible to explicitly confirm assumptions
(ii) and (iii), as they involve unmeasured confounders,
and the function of many of the SNPs used to construct
the GRS IVs is unknown. Nevertheless, we found that
the GRS IVs (particularly the restricted GRS) were gener-
ally not associated (independently of height) with mea-
sured
risk
factors
for
VTE
that
could
potentially
confound the association between height and VTE, which
provides support for the plausibility of assumption (ii).
For assumption (iii), we assume that the GRS IVs are
not related to VTE through any pathway other than
height (that is, there is no horizontal pleiotropy [also
known as biological or type I pleiotropy]) [38,56]. Given
the large number of SNPs used to construct the GRS
IVs, it is difficult to know whether this assumption is rea-
sonable. However, to our knowledge, none of the genes
containing the 697 height SNPs from the Wood et al.
meta-analysis [19] has previously been reported in gen-
ome-wide association studies of VTE [25,33,57–59], and
© 2017 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis
Height and venous thromboembolism 1339
 we found no association between the GRS IVs for height
and a previously reported five-SNP GRS for VTE [46].
Beyond the three IV assumptions, two additional assump-
tions need to be met in order to identify the effect by use
of the generalized method of moments estimator. First,
we assume that there is no effect modification (on the
multiplicative scale) by the IV on the association between
height and VTE [60]. There was no evidence that this
assumption was violated in any of the three studies (all
interaction P-values ≥ 0.52) except in ARIC when the full
GRS IV was used (interaction P-value = 0.04). Second,
we must assume that the effect of height on VTE is linear
on the logit scale and independent of the IV [37], which
appeared to be reasonable from restricted cubic spline
modeling.
The main GRS IV and IVW analyses are unbiased only
when all IVs are valid. However, the MR-Egger regres-
sion and weighted median analyses allow for consistent
effect estimation with some relaxation of IV assumptions,
albeit with some loss of precision as compared with IVW.
Specifically, MR-Egger regression allows all IVs to violate
assumption (iii) provided that they meet the weaker
assumption that any pleiotropic effects of an IV (effects
of the IV on VTE through pathways other than height)
are uncorrelated with the strength of the IV–height asso-
ciation [38], whereas weighted median estimation allows
for up to 50% of the weight contributed by IVs to violate
assumptions (ii) and (iii) [39]. Summary robust IV effect
estimates were attenuated as compared with estimates
from the main IV analysis, which could have possibly
resulted from the use of different estimation methods (ra-
tio estimator versus generalized method of moments) and
different IV weighting schemes. The fact that summary
robust IV effect estimates were slightly larger when the
restricted set of SNPs was used may suggest reduced
pleiotropy in comparison with using the full set of SNPs.
Although there was an association between height and
risk of VTE in the main meta-analyzed results overall, in
the CHS the estimated effect was weak or non-existent
and had wide CIs. The apparent lack of association in
the CHS may be partially explained by the older age of
this cohort, whereby the effect of height is masked in
older age, when there is a higher prevalence of other VTE
risk factors, or by selection bias. Other observational
studies have analogously reported that the effect of family
history as a risk factor for VTE becomes weaker with
increasing age [61,62].
Strengths of this analysis include the use of data from
three different study populations (two population-based
prospective
studies
and one
clinic-based
case–control
study) and the validation of VTE cases in each study.
However, there are some limitations of our study. We
included only people of European ancestry, in order to be
consistent with the genome-wide meta-analysis study of
height [20], which limits the generalizability of our results.
Furthermore, although we have shown that the genetic
instrument was not associated with many common VTE
risk factors (i.e. potential confounders), we were not able
to explore the precise physiologic mechanisms that may
mediate the relationship between height and VTE risk,
including taller adults having greater venous surface area,
a higher number of venous valves, and greater hydrostatic
pressure. Future studies should examine the relationship
of height and VTE risk in other racial/ethnic groups, and
further explore the mechanisms connecting taller height
with VTE risk.
In summary, this analysis provides evidence that taller
height is associated with an increased risk of VTE in
adults of European ancestry. Additionally, we supplement
the results of many previous studies reporting associations
between height and VTE by use of an IV technique that
allows for effect estimation in a way that may be less
influenced than observational analyses by traditional con-
founding factors. Future research should continue to use
IV techniques to better understand the relationships of
other exposures with VTE risk.
