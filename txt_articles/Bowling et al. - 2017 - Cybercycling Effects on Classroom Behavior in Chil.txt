BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Exercise is linked with improved cognition and behavior in children 
in clinical and experimental settings. This translational study examined if an aerobic 
cybercycling intervention integrated into physical education (PE) resulted in improvements 
in behavioral self-regulation and classroom functioning among children with mental health 
disabilities attending a therapeutic day school.
METHODS: Using a 14-week crossover design, students (N = 103) were randomly assigned by 
classroom (k = 14) to receive the 7-week aerobic cybercycling PE curriculum during fall 
2014 or spring 2015. During the intervention, children used the bikes 2 times per week 
during 30- to 40-minute PE classes. During the control period, children participated in 
standard nonaerobic PE. Mixed effects logistic regression was used to assess relationships 
between intervention exposures and clinical thresholds of behavioral outcomes, accounting 
for both individual and classroom random effects.
RESULTS: Children experienced 32% to 51% lower odds of poor self-regulation and learning-
inhibiting disciplinary time out of class when participating in the intervention; this result 
is both clinically and statistically significant. Effects were appreciably more pronounced 
on days that children participated in the aerobic exercise, but carryover effects were also 
observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic cybercycling PE shows promise for improving self-regulation and 
classroom functioning among children with complex behavioral health disorders. This 
school-based exercise intervention may significantly improve child behavioral health 
without increasing parental burden or health care costs, or disrupting academic schedules.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Children with 
behavioral health disorders (BHD) demonstrate low 
participation in aerobic exercise. Research shows 
exercise improves mood and behavior in children 
and lowers chronic disease risks, but little research 
exists in educational settings serving children with 
complex BHD.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Using a randomized 
controlled crossover design, we investigated 
whether an aerobic cybercycling physical education 
curriculum could successfully engage and improve 
behavioral regulation and classroom functioning 
among children and adolescents with complex BHD.

The Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention reports 13% to 
20% of children living in the United 
States experience behavioral health 
disorders (BHD) in a given year; such 
disorders are among the most costly 
conditions to treat in children. 
1 Those 
experiencing BHD have other chronic 
health conditions (eg, asthma, 
diabetes) more often than children 
without BHD. 
1, 
 
2
Meanwhile, there is growing evidence 
that children with BHD are less 
likely to engage in aerobic exercise/
physical activity than their typically 
developing peers. 
3, 
 
4 This can occur 
for many reasons, including exclusion 
from sports due to behavioral 
problems, comorbid sensory issues, 
delayed motor skills, and anxiety. 
4, 
 
5 
Low engagement in aerobic activity is 
linked with lower fitness, which may 
then additionally discourage exercise 
participation.3
Low engagement in exercise is 
particularly troubling given these 
children’s increased risk for chronic 
diseases and evidence that exercise 
may have cognitive, behavioral, and 
emotional benefits. Relatively short 
bouts of exercise have been shown to 
improve impulsivity and mood state 
among typically developing children 
and those with a single BHD, such 
as attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder, autism, or depression. 
6 
– 
8 
Exercise intensity has also been 
linked to cognitive effects in children; 
1 study found that vigorous intensity 
exercise resulted in better executive 
function outcomes than moderate/
light intensity exercise. 
9
These findings emphasize the 
importance of finding aerobic 
exercise modalities that overcome 
the engagement challenges facing 
this population of children with 
BHD. However, this research has 
not been translated into special 
education settings or extended to 
examine effects in children with 
heterogeneous BHD. Thus, in this 
study, we examine if a cybercycling 
physical education (PE) intervention, 
which successfully engages children 
with BHD in aerobic exercise, 
 
10 is 
linked to improvements in behavioral 
self-regulation and classroom 
functioning relative to standard 
nonaerobic PE.
METHODS
Setting and Participants
The study was conducted at a 
therapeutic day school affiliated with 
Harvard Medical School. The school 
enrolls ∼110 children each year in 
kindergarten through 10th grade with 
diagnosed BHD, many of whom have 
learning disabilities, but does not serve 
children with intellectual disabilities.
Students are predominantly boys 
and have multiple diagnoses; in 
an average school year, ∼40% of 
enrolled students are diagnosed with 
autism, 60% with attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder, 40% with an 
anxiety disorder, and 30% with a mood 
disorder. There are 14 classrooms, 
each with a head teacher, an assistant 
teacher, and a classroom counselor. 
Students are engaged with a variety 
of in-school service providers 
including psychologists, occupational 
therapists, and speech pathologists.
Intervention Design
A 14-week crossover design was used. 
Children were randomly assigned 
by classroom to receive the 7-week 
intervention during the fall or spring, 
with a 10-week washout period 
between treatment arms. A simple 
random number generator was used 
to assign 7 classes to the fall treatment; 
the remainder served as the fall control 
group and received treatment in the 
spring. Detailed information on the 
intervention and its development is 
published elsewhere. 
11
The intervention, known as “Manville 
Moves, 
” featured a progressive and 
aerobically challenging PE curriculum 
using virtual-reality exergaming 
stationary bicycles (cybercycles). 
The curriculum overview is shown in 
Supplemental Fig 3. Existing PE efforts 
at the school were not successful at 
engaging the majority of children in 
extended bouts of aerobic exercise. 
Therefore, the exercise modality was 
selected to optimally engage children 
with complex BHD who, again, often 
face exercise engagement challenges, 
such as sensory processing disorders, 
low fitness levels, socialization 
challenges, and motor delays; the 
curriculum was designed to gradually 
accustom participants to riding 
for extended durations and higher 
intensities.
During the intervention, children used 
the bikes 2 times per week during 30- 
to 40-minute PE classes, starting at 10 
minutes riding duration and building 
to >20 minutes over the 7-week 
period. During the control period, 
children continued to participate in 
standard PE programming (2 times 
per week × 30–40 mins). Standard 
PE is focused on games to build 
socialization and team skills as well 
as motor skill acquisition through 
activities, such as basketball shooting; 
thus, there are only short bouts of 
aerobic exercise and many students 
struggle to remain engaged even with 
extensive staff attention.
The study protocol was reviewed 
and approved by the Harvard 
T.H. Chan School of Public Health 
Institutional Review Board. The 
intervention was codesigned by 
school personnel and the research 
team and implemented during the 
2014–2015 academic year. The school 
elected to integrate the intervention 
into school programming; thus, an 
opt-out consent process was used. 
Demographic/baseline data were 
obtained by using an online caregiver 
survey after an active consent process.
Objectives
The study’s first research aim was to 
determine if students had improved 
classroom functioning demonstrated 
through reduced disciplinary

time out of class (TOC), as well as 
improved self-regulation scores when 
participating in the intervention PE 
curriculum compared with standard 
nonaerobic PE. Thus, the first aim 
was to assess the combined acute 
and chronic effects of exercise, along 
with programmatic effects of the 
intervention, over the duration of the 
7-week intervention compared with 
the 7-week control condition.
The second research aim was 
to specifically assess the acute 
effects of exercise by examining 
behavioral changes only on days 
that children participated in the 
aerobic cybercycling PE intervention 
compared with the control condition.
Exposure and Outcomes
Exercise exposure was measured 
using the data captured by the 
bicycles via student-specific login 
codes. Data compiled for each riding 
bout included timestamp, average 
heart rate, and minutes of riding. 
Student refusals to ride, as well as 
any occurrences of mechanical or 
electrical failure, were documented 
on paper. It was not feasible to 
collect objective exercise data for the 
control condition because children 
would not tolerate wearing heart 
rate monitors or accelerometers. 
However, the standard PE curriculum 
did not include programming 
targeting aerobic exercise while 
children were in the control 
condition. Additional information 
on fidelity of implementation and 
student engagement is described 
elsewhere. 
10
Behavioral self-regulation was 
operationalized by using the Conners’ 
Abbreviated Teacher Rating Scale 
(CATRS-10), a validated screening 
instrument for behavioral problems 
related to inattention, impulsivity/
hyperactivity, and emotional 
lability. 
12, 
 
13 Classroom counselors 
completed the CATRS-10 at the 
end of each school day for each 
student. The instrument consists of 
10 statements regarding the child’s 
behavior rated on a 4-point Likert 
scale, with a total score ranging from 
0 to 30. 
13 A score of ≥15 has been 
the standard for screening children 
with symptomatology at a level of 
clinical concern. 
14– 
16 Equivalent 
screening thresholds were used 
for the emotional lability subscale 
(4 questions, ≥6 out of a possible 
12) and impulsivity subscale (6 
questions, ≥9 out of a possible 18).
Because the classroom counselors 
accompanied students to PE, it 
was not possible to blind them 
to the participants’ treatment 
group assignment. However, the 
counselors were not explicitly 
informed of the study objectives and 
received no incentives dependent 
on the participants’ treatment 
group assignment. They were also 
prevented from viewing previous 
recordings of CATRS-10 to help 
prevent manipulations of variability 
based on previous measurements. 
The study coordinator for the school 
reviewed counselor reporting 
records on a weekly basis to ensure 
compliance. A research assistant was 
also assigned to check CATRS-10 
scores for variability on a bi-weekly 
basis; no statistically significantly 
decrease in reporting variability was 
observed during the course of the 
study. In addition, no differences in 
reporting patterns were observed on 
days when floating counselors filled 
in for classroom counselors who 
were absent. Of note, the floating 
counselors did not attend PE sessions 
with the class and therefore were not 
aware of their treatment status.
Classroom functioning was 
operationalized based on TOC. When 
teachers determined a child must 
leave class due to unacceptable 
behavior, counselors recorded 
the event using the mobile survey 
platform to enter the student 
identification code and number 
of minutes for each TOC event as 
it occurred. This measure yielded 
minutes of TOC per day and number 
of TOC events per day for each 
student. Teachers followed a school-
wide policy when determining 
whether a child receives TOC and, 
unlike counselors, were blinded to 
treatment status. Because recording 
TOC has been a longstanding 
procedure, and any TOC must be 
reported to parents, we feel that 
this measure is less vulnerable to 
subjective interpretation or bias if 
the treatment status was learned by 
teachers.
School clinicians established a priori 
thresholds for clinically relevant 
TOC per day that constituted either 
a disruption to a student’s ability to 
learn classroom material (defined 
as ≥1 events per day regardless of 
cumulative time or ≥10 minutes per 
day regardless of total number of 
events), or prevented meaningful 
learning for that day (defined as 
≥5 events per day or ≥90 minutes 
per day).
Sample Size and Analytical Plan
Because exposures and outcomes 
were measured each day, the relevant 
unit of analysis for the study is a child-
day. A logistic-normal mixed effects 
regression model 
17 was used to assess 
relationships between intervention 
exposures and clinical thresholds 
of behavioral outcomes accounting 
for both individual and classroom 
random effects. Outcome variables 
were dichotomous indicators of 
whether a child exceeded clinical 
or screening thresholds for either 
classroom functioning, measured by 
TOC, or self-regulation by using the 
CATRS-10.
The maximum possible sample size 
was 109 based on school enrollment, 
and a priori power calculations 
indicated that a sample of at least 
75 students would provide power 
>90% to detect the small to moderate 
effect sizein executive functioning 
evident in the literature. 
6, 
 
18, 
 
19 Given 
nearly universal participation, daily 
outcome measurements, crossover 
design, and minimal attrition, the 
sample size was more than adequate.

The number of child-days varied by 
outcome and are described in the 
results section.
The primary models tested aim 1 
(ie, the overall treatment effect of 
the intervention) for each outcome 
measure. Treatment status and 
treatment order were included in 
each model as independent variables 
to evaluate overall treatment effects 
while accounting for potential 
seasonality/contamination effects. 
The secondary models assessing 
aim 2 (ie, the acute exercise effects 
of the intervention) additionally 
included terms indicating whether a 
child participated in the cybercycling 
PE class intervention on that day. 
Finally, the models were also run 
introducing a dichotomous variable 
representing whether the students 
used the bikes in the virtual course 
mode or the video gaming mode 
to test for potential exergaming 
effects. All statistical analyses were 
conducted in Stata version 13.1 
(Stata Corp, College Station, TX), by 
using a two-tailed significance level 
of P = .05.

Demographic Characteristics
 
Figure 1 shows the CONSORT 
enrollment, randomization, and 
attrition flow diagram. The final 
enrollment was N = 103 students; 
the fall intervention arm included 
n = 51 students in 7 randomly 
assigned classrooms, and the 
spring intervention arm included 
n = 52 students in the remaining 7 
classrooms. Baseline demographic 
data are contained in  
Table 1. 
Participants were 83.5% boys, and 
ages ranged from 7 to 16 years 
with a mean of 11.8 years. No 
adverse events occurred during the 
intervention.
Documentation of the Exposure and 
Outcome Variables
There were 913 cybercycling PE 
days; average cycling duration in 
class was 16.1 (±5.3) minutes, while 
average heart rate was 146.6 (±25.3) 
beats per minute. This indicates that 
students achieved sustained aerobic 
exercise

classes on average.

threshold for disruptive behavior 
(fall, n = 475; spring, n = 480). 
Treatment order was not found to 
be significant in any of the models. 
Individual and classroom random 
effects are controlled for in all 
analyses; children serve as their own 
controls and group level differences 
in outcome variables between fall 
and spring do not affect the validity 
of analyses. Compared with days in 
the control condition, percentages 
of children exceeding screening 
thresholds for overall CATRS-10 
score and both impulsivity and 
emotional lability subscores declined 
on days in the intervention condition 
and were lowest on days when the 
children participated in cybercycling 
PE class ( 
Fig 2). Post-hoc tests found 
no evidence of time-of-day effects for 
morning versus afternoon PE classes.
Models Testing Overall Intervention 
Effect (Aim 1)
Results ( 
Table 2, Model 1) show 
clinically significant intervention 
effects. While in the 7-week 
intervention, students experienced 
significantly reduced odds of 
exceeding screening thresholds 
for total CATRS-10 score (odds 
ratio [OR], 0.68; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.57–0.81), emotional 
lability subscore (OR, 0.64; 95% 
CI, 0.52–0.77), and impulsivity/
hyperactivity subscore (OR, 0.49; 
95% CI, 0.36–0.67), relative to 
when they participated in standard 
nonaerobic PE (ie, the control 
condition). Students also experienced 
significantly lower odds of having 
≥5 TOC events (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 
0.32–0.91). The overall treatment 
effect was not significant for learning 
disruptive TOC outcomes (1+ events, 
10+ minutes) or preclusive to 
learning TOC minutes (90+ minutes).
Models Testing Acute Exercise 
Effects (Aim 2)
The effects of acute exercise were 
significantly more pronounced than 
the overall intervention effects 
( 
Table 2, Model 2). On days 
that students participated in 
an intervention PE class, they 
experienced clinically and statistically 
significantly reduced odds of 
exceeding screening thresholds for 
total CATRS-10 score (OR, 0.29; 95% 
CI, 0.14–0.61), emotional lability 
subscore (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.11–
0.53), and impulsivity/hyperactivity 
subscore (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.13–
0.59), relative to the control condition. 
Acute effects of cybercycling PE class 
also resulted in significantly reduced 
odds of both learning-disruptive and 
preclusive TOC events (OR, 0.43; 95% 
CI, 0.26–0.72; OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02–
0.61) and minutes (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 
0.29–0.89; OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.14–
0.84). Treatment order and video 
gaming mode were not significant in 
any of the models.
DISCUSSION
This study provides compelling 
evidence that children and 
adolescents with multiple, 
heterogeneous BHD in a school 
setting can successfully engage in 
and experience behavioral benefits 
from an aerobic, cybercycling PE 
curriculum. Across the intervention 
period, odds that children would 
display clinically disruptive 
behaviors, including impulsivity 
and emotional lability, were 32% to 
51% lower than during the control 
condition. These effects strengthened 
on days when children participated

in an intervention cybercycling class; 
here, odds of disruptive levels of 
behavioral dysregulation declined 
between 71% and 76% relative to 
the control condition. Acute exercise 
led to significant declines in odds of 
receiving learning disruptive and 
preclusive amounts of disciplinary 
TOC. These results build on previous 
research showing positive effects 
of aerobic exercise on mood and 
impulsivity in children, and translate 
those findings into a program 
implemented in a real world setting 
with children with multiple BHD.
The primary research aim was to 
determine whether intervention 
participation resulted in improved 
behavioral outcomes for students; this 
was the case; however, effects were 
more pronounced on days when the 
children participated in the structured, 
aerobic cybercycling PE classes. So 
although there seemed to be chronic 
exercise and programmatic effects of 
this intervention on behavioral self-
regulation and classroom functioning 
even on days when children did not 
bike, acute exercise is the primary 
driver of the intervention effect. This 
finding is consistent with previous 
studies and proposed mechanisms by 
which neuroendocrine and reticular-
activating systems affect mood and 
functioning in areas of the brain 
related to executive function and 
impulse control. 
21
Although it was impossible to blind 
counselors to the intervention 
condition, we feel risk of bias in 
recording student behaviors due to 
knowledge of treatment status was 
low. Neither teachers nor counselors 
were aware of the primary study 
hypotheses. Also, the outcome of 
disciplinary TOC is determined 
by classroom teachers who were 
not aware of treatment condition. 
Post-hoc tests for bias included 
comparison of CATRS-10 by blinded 
(floating) and nonblinded counselors, 
which indicated no reporting 
differences, and examination of 
scores on days students electively 
rode. If counselors were aware of 
the hypothesis/biased in reporting, 
scores should have been lower for 
children on those days as they were 
for cybercycling PE days because 
counselors accompany them to ride; 
in fact, point estimates indicated 
worse scores than on nonriding days 
(not statistically significant).
In addition to aerobic exercise, the 
cybercycling PE classes may hold 
several other advantages over 
standard PE programming. They 
require fewer transitions, which 
are often challenging to children 
with BHD. Also, the cybercycling 
PE allowed students to avoid peer 
judgments of performance, because 
other students could not see their 
performance data unless they 
shared it. It was also less noisy and 
chaotic than standard PE classes. 
10 
However, it is important to note that 
a standard PE class may confer its 
own benefits, including motor skill 
acquisition, team sports practice, 
and socialization. Cybercycles are 
also relatively expensive; because 
the key is overcoming aerobic 
exercise engagement barriers, other 
modalities should be explored with 
similar populations.
Because the intervention was 
implemented as part of school 
programming, participation was 
nearly universal; therefore, selection 
biases that generally accompany 
active participant recruitment and 
consent protocols were avoided. 
The generalizability of the results is 
enhanced because participants had a 
wide variety of diagnoses, including 
complex comorbidities. Finally, this 
study demonstrates strong ecological 
validity because the intervention was 
conducted within the existing school 
schedule and staffing. This improves 
potential for scale-up/dissemination 
in more diverse settings catering to 
children with BHD.
Despite these strengths, the 
generalizability of the results is 
limited by the setting and population 
targeted. Therapeutic day schools 
serve children who have been 
unsuccessful in public school special 
education environments. Thus, 
findings from this study are limited to 
students with substantial BHD. Future 
research that tests the intervention in 
special education programs in public 
schools is needed to determine if a 
broader group of children may benefit 
from the program.
Despite overall cuts to PE class-time 
allocation, 
 
22 efforts are taking place 
across the United States to allow 
movement in classrooms to facilitate

However, although children with 
BHD may benefit the most from the 
effects of aerobic exercise, they are 
least likely to be easily engaged in 
such activities. This study shows 
that a cybercycling PE curriculum 
can successfully engage children 
with a variety of complex BHD in 
high-quality aerobic exercise and, as 
a result, they experience significant 
improvements in important 
behavioral measures. Critically, such 
a curriculum can successfully affect 
student behavior within existing 
school programming with short 
durations and low frequency.
