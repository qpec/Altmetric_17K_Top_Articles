Technologies to Investigate the 
Impact of Nature on Mental  
 
Well-Being in Real Time

Existing evidence on the beneficial effects of nature on mental health comes from studies using cross-sectional designs. We developed a 
smartphone-based tool (Urban Mind; www.urbanmind.info) to examine how exposure to natural features within the built environment affects 
mental well-being in real time. The tool was used to monitor 108 individuals who completed 3013 assessments over a 1-week period. Significant 
immediate and lagged associations with mental well-being were found for several natural features. These associations were stronger in people 
with higher trait impulsivity, a psychological measure of one’s tendency to behave with little forethought or consideration of the consequences, 
which is indicative of a higher risk of developing mental-health issues. Our investigation suggests that the benefits of nature on mental well-being 
are time-lasting and interact with an individual’s vulnerability to mental illness. These findings have potential implications from the perspectives 
of global mental health as well as urban planning and design.

O
ver three-and-a-half billion people, more than half  
 the world’s population, live in urban areas. This num-
ber is rising fast in both developed and developing countries, 
and it is expected that 66% of the global population will live 
in cities by 2050 (UNESA 2014). This ongoing urbanization 
has major implications for global mental health, because 
people who live in urban environments are at higher risk of 
a range of mental-health issues, including depression, gener-
alized anxiety disorders, psychosis, and addictive  
disorders 
(Peen et al. 2010, Galea 2011, Lederbogen et al. 2011). 
Crucially, the observation of a dose-dependent effect pro-
vides support for a causal relationship, rather than a mere 
association, between urban living and risk for mental illness 
(Pedersen and Mortensen 2001, Haddad et al. 2015). Further 
evidence for this causal relationship comes from the finding 
that the adverse impact of urban living can be reversible, 
with some categories of patients showing improved clinical 
outcomes after moving from urban to rural environments 
(Pedersen and Mortensen 2001). Although city dwellers 
are at higher risk of mental illness, an increasing body of 
evidence suggests that natural features within the built envi-
ronment can counteract the detrimental effects of urban 
living and even promote mental health. For example, living 
in urban areas with natural features such as trees, gardens, 
parks, birds, and water is associated with higher levels of 
mental well-being and reduced incidence of chronic men-
tal illness (van den Berg et al. 2010, van Dillen et al. 2012, 
Astell-Burt et al. 2013, Nutsford et al. 2013, Richardson et al. 
2013, White et al. 2013, Astell-Burt et al. 2014, Alcock et al. 
2015, Mantler and Logan 2015, Taylor et al. 2015, Triguero-
Mas et al. 2015, Cox et al. 2017). A number of biologically 
plausible theories have been proposed to explain this effect, 
including attention-restoration theory (Kaplan S 1995), 
stress-reduction theory (Ulrich et al. 1991), and biophilia 
theory (Wilson 1993).
The existing literature on the beneficial impact of nature 
on mental health, however, is hindered by a number of 
limitations. First, most studies have used a cross-sectional 
design involving the acquisition of a single “snapshot,” with-
out accounting for the fact that people experience a diverse 
range of urban environments throughout the day. Second, 
most research has examined the role of green spaces per se 
without considering the type and amount of nature people 
require to experience beneficial effects on their mental

health. Third, most studies have attempted to measure the 
impact of green spaces without assessing how this might 
depend on individual characteristics such as age, gender, 
lifestyle, and mental health. For example, the beneficial 
effects of nature might be particularly evident in those indi-
viduals who, due to pre-existing genetic and environmental 
factors, possess greater vulnerability to mental-health issues. 
In light of these limitations, a better understanding of how 
natural features of the urban environment affect mental 
health remains an urgent priority, as was highlighted by the 
World Health Organization in their declaration of 2010 as 
the Year of Urban Health (WHO and UN-Habitat 2010).
Overcoming the limitations of the existing literature 
with smartphone-based ecological momentary 
assessment
In order to overcome the limitations of the existing literature, 
we have developed a smartphone app for examining the 
impact of the surrounding built environment on mental well-
being (a strong predictor of mental health) as people go about 
their daily lives. The Urban Mind app uses a methodology 
known as ecological momentary assessment, which involves 
repeated sampling of current experiences in real-time and 
real-world contexts (Shiffman et al. 2008). The use of smart-
phone-based ecological momentary assessment has three sig-
nificant benefits: first, it allows multiple measurements over 
time, providing insight into dynamic changes in mental states 
that could not be captured by a single snapshot; second, it 
allows the acquisition of detailed information on the type and 
amount of nature that people experience either incidentally 
or intentionally; third, it maximizes ecological validity as data 
are collected in real-world environments (Beute et al. 2016). 
A further advantage of using smartphones to collect research 
data is that people tend to carry and use them multiple times 
as part of their daily lives; in contrast, the deployment of 
paper diaries or stand-alone electronic devices places greater 
demands on the individual, resulting in high rates of miss-
ing responses. The use of smartphones is also cost-effective: 
Once the expense of developing an app has been met, it 
can easily be downloaded and installed on any smartphone 
worldwide, allowing large numbers of participants to provide 
research data with minimal operational costs.
The Urban Mind tool
With our technical provider Artists & Engineers (www.
artistsandengineers.co.uk), we developed a native software 
application (app) named Urban Mind using the Ionic 
cross-platform development framework, compatible with 
any iPhone devices running under iOS 7.1 or newer and 
any smartphone running under Android 4.4 or newer. We 
also developed back-end server software to communicate 
with the app and a public-facing, project-related website 
providing information on the research to potential partici-
pants (www.urbanmind.info). The Urban Mind tool could 
be downloaded for free from the Apple App Store and the 
Google Play Store. The participants were recruited over 
a period of 8 months (October 2015–June 2016) using 
the project-related website and social-media platforms. In 
particular, an Urban Mind page was created on Instagram 
(www.instagram.com/urban_mind_project), Twitter (www.
twitter.com/Urban_Mind_Proj), and Facebook (www.face-
book.com/UrbanMindProject) to disseminate the project 
and encourage participation. In addition, recruitment of 
the participants was enhanced by coverage of the project on 
mainstream national and international media. Participation 
in the project was self-selected and anonymous. After down-
loading and installing the app on their smartphones, the 
participants were presented with a description of the aim 
and methodology of the project and were asked to provide 
informed consent. Once informed consent was granted, the 
app acquired the following data: 
(a)  
A baseline assessment of demographics (e.g., age, gen-
der, and ethnicity), socioeconomics (e.g., education and 
occupation), mental well-being, and trait impulsivity. 
Mental well-being was assessed using the Warwick-
Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, which focuses on 
the previous 2 weeks (Tennant et al. 2007); a full list of 
questions for this scale and a description of how they 
were scored can be found in the supplemental material 
(see supplemental scale S1). Trait impulsivity was mea-
sured using the Trait Rash Impulsivity Scale (Mayhew 
and Powell 2014); a full list of questions and a descrip-
tion of how these were coded is available in the supple-
mental material (see supplemental scale S2). 
(b)  
A total of 49 ecological momentary assessments, with 
7 per day over a period of 7 days. Each ecological 
momentary assessment lasted about 2 minutes and 
covered the following three areas: (1) an individual’s 
perception of their surrounding environment, assessed 
through a series of questions tailored to whether the 
participant was indoors or outdoors; (2) an indi-
vidual’s geographical location using GPS-based geo-
tagging; and (3) an individual’s momentary mental 
well-being. Momentary mental well-being was assessed 
via an adapted version of the Warwick-Edinburgh 
Mental Well-Being Scale, which focused on the pres-
ent moment (Tennant et al. 2007); a full list of ques-
tions for this scale and a description of how they were 
scored can be found in the supplemental,material (see 
supplemental scale S3). For the purpose of the present 
investigation, we focus on six questions of interest that 
refer to natural features of the surrounding environ-
ment: Are you indoors or outdoors? Can you see trees? 
Can you see the sky? Can you hear birds singing? Can 
you see or hear water? Do you feel in contact with 
nature? Possible answers to each question included yes, 
no, and not sure.
When people received a prompt to complete an ecological 
momentary assessment, they had 30 minutes to do so before 
this was marked as incomplete. This allowed users a time

frame to respond to the prompt without the need to inter-
rupt any activities they were engaged in. If the Internet was 
inaccessible at the time of an ecological momentary assess-
ment, the data were stored on the device and uploaded when 
mobile or Wi-Fi Internet access was next available.
Within each ecological momentary assessment, different 
questions were associated with distinct icons (see figure 1 
for examples). This extensive use of iconography had two 
advantages: first, it made the experience of using the tool 
more enjoyable, thereby promoting sustained engagement; 
second, it shortened the time required to complete an eco-
logical momentary assessment, because users learned to 
recognize each question from the associated icon.
Each time a participant completed an ecological momen-
tary assessment, they were invited to collect and submit 
a photograph of the ground and/or an audio recording of 
the surrounding environment (see figure 2 for a selection 
of the photographs). The rationale for inviting participants 
to document their surrounding environment was twofold: 
first, these photographic and audio recordings were used to 
disseminate the research on the project-related website and 
social media platforms; second, the activity of documenting 
one’s environment was meant to promote sustained engage-
ment with the tool as well as the wider research project. In 
addition, we envisage that these photographic and audio 
recordings could be treated as research data amenable to 
scientific investigation in the future; for example, GIS-based 
time-graphic methods could be applied to the photographic 
and audio recordings to generate a geonarrative account of 
the data (Kwan and Ding 2008).
Using the Urban Mind tool to investigate the impact 
of nature on mental well-being in real time
We used the Urban Mind app to monitor exposure to natural 
features of the built environment and associated changes 
in mental well-being in 108 participants for a period of 1 
week. One of the aims of our project was to explore how the 
impact of the surrounding built environment on the mental 
well-being of an individual might depend on their vulner-
ability to developing mental-health issues. For this reason, we 
included an assessment of trait impulsivity, a well-established 
psychological measure of one’s tendency to behave with 
little forethought, reflection, or consideration of the con-
sequences (Mayhew and Powell 2014). Animal and human 
models suggest that this measure is predictive of future risk 
of developing mental-health issues including addictive dis-
orders (McChargue et al. 2011, Kunst and Van Wilsem 2013, 
Velázquez-Sánchez et al. 2014, Sanchez-Roige et al. 2014, 
Dalley and Robbins 2017), attention-deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (Ahmad and Hinshaw 2017, Martel et al. 2017), 
antisocial personality disorder (González et al. 2016, Martel 
et al. 2017), and bipolar disorder (Tu et al. 2017). We used the 
data to test three related hypotheses: (1) exposure to natural 
features, including trees, the sky, birdsong, and water, would 
be associated with higher levels of momentary mental well-
being; (2) these effects would still be evident in subsequent

assessments, in which people are no longer exposed to trees, 
the sky, birdsong, and water, indicating time-lasting benefits; 
(3) these effects would be more evident in people with higher 
trait impulsivity, who are thought to carry greater vulner-
ability to mental-health issues, than those with lower trait 
impulsivity (Dalley and Robbins 2017).
The research project had received full ethical approval 
from the Psychiatry, Nursing, and Midwifery Research Ethics 
Sub-Committee at King’s College London (no. PNM/14/15-
59). The data generated during the current project are 
available from the corresponding author on request.
Statistical analysis. The statistical analysis of the data was 
performed using STATA 14.1. Our main analysis was based 
on 2094 assessments from 64 participants who completed a 
minimum of 25 assessments each (more than a 50% response 
rate). We also ran two additional analyses, including 108 
participants with a response rate of 33% (total number of 
assessments: 3013) and 25 participants with a response rate 
of 66% (total number of assessments: 966).
Longitudinal associations between self-reported environ-
mental features of interest and momentary mental well-being 
were investigated using random intercept linear models and 
expressed as mean differences of momentary mental well-
being. All models were adjusted for the following potential 
confounders: gender, age, occupational status, and mental well-
being over the 2 previous weeks. In practice, this adjustment 
was implemented by including these variables as additional 
covariates within each statistical model. The interaction effect 
between self-reported environmental features and participant 
trait impulsivity on mental well-being was assessed by includ-
ing an interaction term in the random intercept linear models. 
For more information on the implementation of the statistical 
analysis, see “Technical Note” in the supplemental material.
In addition, to explore the association between self-
reported environmental features and momentary mental 
well-being at specific and concurrent time points, we cre-
ated time-shifted copies of the self-reported environmen-
tal variables and included them in the random intercept 
regression models. The relationships of all the explanatory 
variables may be immediate or occur with some lag; there-
fore, we examined models that included multiple lags of the 
explanatory variables. Because the interval between succes-
sive ecological momentary assessments was 2 hours and 25 
minutes on average, one-lagged effects would indicate that 
the impact of a feature of interest was still evident after 2 
hours and 25 minutes, two-lagged effects would indicate 
that the impact of a feature of interest was still evident after 
4 hours and 50 minutes, and three-lagged effects would indi-
cate that the impact of a feature of interest was still evident 
after 7 hours and 15 minutes. Because multiple lags could 
be correlated with each other, we also allowed the effect of 
environmental variables to decline with time with the use of 
second-order polynomial-distributed lag models.
Finally, we repeated our statistical analyses using the 
STATA routine ice, an implementation in STATA of the

under the missing at random (MAR) assumption (White

All statistical models were tested for multicollinearity 
using Pearson and Goodman and Kruskal’s gamma correla-
tion coefficients; this indicated that multicollinearity was 
not an issue, as we show in supplemental table S1.

cated to the university level, and the vast majority of them 
were either studying (32.4%) or working (45.4%). All 108 
participants completed at least 33% of the assessments; 64

participants completed at least 50%, and 25 participants 
completed at least 66%. It can be seen from table 1 that those 
completing a higher number of assessments were more likely 
to be a student when compared with those completing a 
lower number of assessments, who were more likely to be 
working. In contrast age, gender, and mental well-being over 
the previous 2 weeks appeared to be comparable between 
high and low responders (table 1).
The association between natural features and mental well-being. The 
statistical analysis adjusted for mental well-being over the 
previous 2 weeks showed positive associations between 
momentary mental well-being and being outdoors (p < 
.001), seeing trees (p < .001), hearing birds singing (p < .001), 
seeing the sky (p < .001), and feeling in contact with nature 
(p < .001) across the three different response-rate thresholds 
(33%, 50%, and 66%). In contrast, an association between 
momentary mental well-being and being able to see or hear 
water was only observed at the 66% response-rate threshold. 
For most features of interest, effect estimates did not differ 
significantly when using the MICE procedure (table 2).
These results were replicated when, in addition to adjust-
ing for mental well-being over the previous 2 weeks, we fur-
ther adjusted for gender, age, and occupational status. Here, 
consistent associations with momentary mental well-being 
across the three different response-rate thresholds (33%, 
50%, and 66%) were seen for being outdoors (p < .001) and 
seeing trees (p < .001). Associations with momentary mental 
well-being across two thresholds (33% and 50%) were found 
for hearing birds singing (p < .001) and feeling in contact 
with nature (p < .001). Specifically, the effect sizes for being 
outdoors versus being indoors were 2.31 (95% confidence 
intervals [CI] = 1.52–3.11), 2.41 (95% CI = 1.43–3.39), and 
2.90 (95% CI = 1.48–4.33) for the 33%, 50%, and 66% thresh-
olds, respectively; the effect sizes for seeing trees versus not 
seeing trees were 1.78 (95% CI = 1.14–2.42), 1.82 (95% 
CI = 1.06–2.57), and 1.31 (95% CI = 0.16-2.46), respectively. 
The effect sizes for hearing birds singing versus not hear-
ing birds singing, across the 33% and 50% thresholds, were 
3.82 (95% CI = 2.21–5.43) and 3.71 (95% CI = 1.75–5.68), 
respectively; the effect sizes for feeling in contact with 
nature, across the 33% and 50% thresholds, were 3.77 (95% 
CI = 2.20–5.34) and 3.51 (95% CI = 1.62–5.41), respectively 
(see figure 3 and supplemental table S2).
The time-lag association between natural features and mental well-
being. The use of models with multiple lags revealed a num-
ber of significant lagged effects, indicating a time-lasting 
effect of nature on momentary mental well-being, after 
adjusting for gender, age, occupational status, and mental 
well-being over the previous 2 weeks. In particular, seeing 
trees and seeing the sky during an assessment had a statisti-
cally significant effect on momentary well-being in the next 
subsequent assessment, which took place an average of 2 
hours and 25 minutes later (p values: 0.015 and 0.031, respec-
tively). The effect size of seeing trees on momentary mental 
well-being in the next subsequent assessment was 1.62 (95% 
CI = 0.31–2.92), whereas the effect size of seeing the sky on 
momentary mental well-being in the next subsequent assess-
ment was 1.46 (95% CI = 0.13–2.80). In addition, feeling in 
contact with nature during an assessment had a statistically 
significant effect on momentary mental well-being during the 
second subsequent assessment, which took place an average 
of 4 hours and 50 minutes later (p value: .018), with an effect 
size of 1.70 (95% CI = 0.31–3.10). The associations between 
the six different environmental features under investigation

The interaction between natural features and trait impulsivity on men-
tal well-being. There was a statistically significant interaction 
between exposure to our environmental features of interest 
and trait impulsivity on momentary mental well-being. In 
particular, the effects of being outdoors (p value for interac-
tion term: .037), seeing trees (p value for interaction term: 
.026), hearing birdsong (p value for interaction term: .021), 
hearing birds singing (p value for interaction term: .001), 
and feeling in contact with nature (p value for interaction 
term: .025) were greater in people with higher levels of trait 
impulsivity than those with lower levels of trait impulsivity. 
Figure 5 and supplemental table S4 present the interaction 
terms for the six natural features under investigation.
Cross-disciplinary implications of the findings
The aim of this study was to use a novel smartphone-based 
tool to monitor the impact of nature on momentary men-
tal well-being in real-time and real-world environments. 
Consistent with our first hypothesis, we found that being 
outdoors, seeing trees, hearing birds singing, seeing the 
sky, and feeling in contact with nature were associated with 
higher levels of momentary mental well-being; in contrast, 
a consistent effect was not detected for seeing or hearing 
water. These findings provide empirical support for the 
notion that short-term exposure to specific natural features 
has measurable beneficial effects on mental well-being, 
complementing existing evidence from previous studies 
that examined cumulative long-term exposure to nature 
(Kaplan 2001, Evans 2003, Velarde et al. 2007, Grinde and 
Patil 2009, Sarkar et al. 2013, Cox et al. 2017). In addition, 
consistent with our second hypothesis, we found that these 
beneficial effects could still be observed even if the partici-
pant was no longer outdoors and no longer had access to 
nature. This lagged effect indicates a time-lasting impact of 
nature on mental well-being that can still be observed after 
several hours. Finally, consistent with our third hypothesis, 
we found that the effects of being outdoors, seeing trees, 
seeing the sky, hearing birds singing, and feeling in contact 
with nature on momentary mental well-being were greater 
in people with higher levels of impulsivity. In light of the 
associations between impulsivity and addictive disorders

Dalley and Robbins 2017), attention-deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (Ahmad and Hinshaw 2017, Martel et al. 2017), 
antisocial personality disorder (González et al. 2016, 
Martel et al. 2017), and bipolar disorder (Tu et al. 2017), 
this finding supports the notion that the beneficial effects 
of nature may be especially evident in those individuals 
who possess greater vulnerability to mental-health issues.
The implications of these results are twofold. First, from 
the perspective of urban planning and design, the data pro-
vide a much-needed evidence base that could inform future 
investments and policies. There is an urgent need for such 
an evidence base because at present, decisions on urban 
planning and design aimed at improving the mental health 
of the general population tend to be based on “conventional 
wisdom” because of the lack of robust scientific data. In 
particular, our findings suggest that greater access to natural 
features within the built environment can be especially ben-
eficial to individuals who show higher levels of impulsivity 
and, as such, may be at greater risk of developing mental-
health issues. Second, from the perspective of mental health, 
the data could inform the development of low-cost scalable 
interventions aimed at promoting mental health in urban 
populations. This is an urgent global health priority because 
mental illness is the leading causes of disability worldwide, 
accounting for 32.4% of years lived with disability (YLDs) 
and 13% of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; Vigo et al. 
2016). In particular, our findings suggest that increasing 
and promoting access to nature could be a simple but effec-
tive intervention to help vulnerable individuals maintain 
high levels of mental well-being, thereby reducing risk 
of developing a mental illness. This conclusion extends a 
previous report of a beneficial effect of nature in patients 
with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder to a nonclinical 
population (Kuo and Taylor 2004).
From a methodological perspective, our investigation 
shows that it is feasible to use smartphone-based ecological

adjusted for age, gender, occupational status, and mental well-being over the previous two weeks with the use of the 
MICE procedure. The mean difference (MD) refers to the mean difference in momentary mental well-being score per 
category increase. The horizontal axis represents the assessments lagged from 0–3, and the vertical axis represents the 
MD with 95% confidence interval. L0 indicates the impact of a feature of interest on momentary well-being at the time 
of the first assessment;  L1 indicates that the impact of a self-reported environmental feature of interest was still evident 
after 2 hours and 25 minutes; L2 would indicate that the impact of a feature of interest was still evident after 4 hours and 
50 minutes; and L3 would indicate that the impact of a feature of interest was still evident after 7 hours and 15 minutes.

momentary assessment to examine the relationship between 
specific aspects of the built environment and mental well-
being as people go about their daily life. A crucial advantage 
of this approach is that it maximizes ecological validity, 
because data are collected in real-world environments (Beute 
et al. 2016). A further advantage is that it minimizes recall 
bias—a common issue in psychological research—because 
data are collected in real time (Shiffman et al. 2008). In 
comparison with cross-sectional studies, our approach also 
allows the investigation of both immediate and lagged effects 
within individuals, allowing us to capture dynamic tempo-
ral associations that would be diluted in population-based 
surveys.
In addition, our investigation shows that it is feasible to 
use smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment 
to test for interactions between the environment and the 
individual. For example, through the inclusion of a well-
established measure of trait impulsivity as part of the base-
line assessment, we were able to demonstrate an interaction 
between natural features of the built environment and an 
individual’s susceptibility to specific mental-health issues 
characterized by addictive and externalising behaviours. 
However, we know that all mental disorders are the results 
of the complex interplay between environmental and indi-
vidual factors. Therefore, future studies could replace trait 
impulsivity with transdiagnostic measures of mental health 
(e.g., the Mental Health Continuum; Oprana et al. 2017).
Limitations. Our investigation has a number of limitations. 
First, because the data were acquired using an observational 
rather than an experimental design, it was not possible to 
establish whether the observed associations between nature 
and mental well-being reflect a direct causal impact of the 
former on the latter. One could speculate, for example, that 
individuals who already feel low may be less likely to leave 
the home and experience natural habitat. However, the 
observation of time-lagged effects, in which the beneficial 
effects of nature could still be detected after the participant 
was no longer exposed to trees, the sky, and birdsong, pro-
vides indirect support to our interpretation that nature had

responded Yes and for those that responded No/Not sure to the questions “Are you indoors or outdoors?”, “Can you see

you see the sky?”. P-value for interaction term for the question “can you see the sky?” > 0.05. All the other p-values for the 
interaction terms < 0.05. See supplemental Table S4 for more details.

a beneficial impact on mental well-being. Second, the pres-
ent investigation relied on self-reports, which are known to 
be prone to potential bias (Shiffman 2014). For example, 
individuals with lower levels of mental health tend to pay 
greater attention to negative than positive stimuli (Mogg et 
al 1995); for example, someone with low mental well-being 
might have paid more attention to aversive traffic sounds 
than sounds of birds or water. Third, our sample comprised 
smartphone users with higher-than-average levels of educa-
tion and an average age of just 31.1 years and therefore can-
not be considered representative of the general population. 
In addition, this sample was not randomly derived from 
a specific population because it was based on participants 
choosing to download and use the app. However, it was not 
our aim to make inferences about a specific population, and 
because of the self-selected nature of the sample, we did not 
think it would be appropriate to calculate sampling weights. 
Future studies would benefit from recruiting a more diverse 
sample and investigating how the results change as a func-
tion of demographic and socioeconomic factors. This could 
be achieved, for example, through the use of “ambassadors” 
from a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic back-
grounds who could disseminate the project and promote 
participation among their peers and communities. Finally, 
it is important to acknowledge that mental well-being and 
mental health are not the same: mental well-being refers 
to positive states of being, feeling, thinking, and behaving, 
whereas mental health incorporates a range of negative 
and positive states, from several mental illness to excellent 
mental health (Tennant et al. 2007). Nevertheless, mental 
well-being is thought to be good indicator of the extent to 
which individuals are able to function and thrive in their 
day-to-day life and is predictive of future risk of mental ill-
ness (Keyes 2007).
Comparison with previous research. It should be noted that pre-
vious studies have employed smartphone-based ecological 
momentary assessment to examine the relationship between 
the built environment and mental well-being in situ. For 
example, MacKerron and Mourato (2013) developed an 
app that combines GPS information with mood ratings and 
reported that exposure to natural environments leads to 
greater “happiness.” Other studies employed smartphone 
technologies to measure mental well-being within a specific 
natural habitat of interest (Doherty et al. 2014) or evalu-
ate the beneficial impact of a brief exposure to nature on 
cognition (Berman et al. 2012). Our investigation, however, 
provides a distinct contribution for several reasons. First, 
we assessed the impact of self-reported exposure to specific 
natural features of interest (e.g., “can you see trees?”) irre-
spective of whether these were located within a rural or an 
urban environment. In contrast, previous studies used GPS 
information to infer the habitat (e.g., rural versus urban) 
in which an individual was located at the time of each eco-
logical momentary assessment and therefore were unable 
to capture the impact of natural features within the urban 
environment (MacKerron and Mourato 2013). Second, we 
estimated not only immediate but also lagged associations 
with momentary mental well-being; this revealed a time-
lasting effect of exposure to nature on mental well-being 
that, to our knowledge, has not been reported in previous 
studies using the ecological momentary assessment tech-
nique. Finally, through the inclusion of a scale measuring 
trait impulsivity in the baseline assessment, we were able to 
demonstrate that the impact of natural features on mental 
well-being depends on an individual’s personality. Despite 
these distinct aspects, the findings of our investigation are 
consistent with the results of these earlier studies, providing 
further empirical evidence to the notion that nature can have 
a beneficial impact on mental well-being.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our investigation represents a successful 
example of citizen science, enhanced by the development of 
a project-related social media (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, and 
Facebook). Our findings indicate that (a) it is feasible to use 
smartphone-based ecological assessment to examine the rela-
tionship between natural features of the built environment 
and momentary mental well-being in real time; (b) exposure 
to natural features including trees, the sky, and birdsong 
has a time-lasting beneficial impact on momentary mental 
well-being; and (c) the beneficial effects of nature may be 
especially evident in those individuals with greater levels of 
trait impulsivity who are at greater risk of developing addic-
tive disorders and other mental-health issues. These findings 
have potential implications from the perspectives of global 
mental health and urban planning and design.
