Abstract
Background: Relatively little is known about the stability of a diagnosis of episodic migraine (EM) or chronic migraine
(CM) over time. This study examines natural fluctuations in self-reported headache frequency as well as the stability
and variation in migraine type among individuals meeting criteria for EM and CM at baseline.
Methods: The Chronic Migraine Epidemiology and Outcomes (CaMEO) Study was a longitudinal survey of US adults
with EM and CM identified by a web-questionnaire. A validated questionnaire was used to classify respondents with
EM (<15 headache days/month) or CM (≥15 headache days/month) every three months for a total of five assessments.
We described longitudinal persistence of baseline EM and CM classifications. In addition, we modelled longitudinal
variation in headache day frequency per month using negative binomial repeated measures regression models
(NBRMR).
Results: Among the 5464 respondents with EM at baseline providing four or five waves of data, 5048 (92.4%) had EM
in all waves and 416 (7.6%) had CM in at least one wave. Among 526 respondents with CM at baseline providing four
or five waves of data, 140 (26.6%) had CM in every wave and 386 (73.4%) had EM for at least one wave. Individual plots
revealed striking within-person variations in headache days per month. The NBRMR model revealed that the rate of
headache days increased across waves of observation 19% more per wave for CM compared to EM (rate ratio [RR],
1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.26). After adjustment for covariates, the relative difference changed to a 26% increase per wave
(RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.2–1.33).
Conclusions: Follow-up at three-month intervals reveals a high level of short-term variability in headache days per
month. As a consequence, many individuals cross the CM diagnostic boundary of ≥15 headache days per month.
Nearly three quarters of persons with CM at baseline drop below this diagnostic boundary at least once over the
course of a year. These findings are of interest in the consideration of headache classification and diagnosis, the design
and interpretation of epidemiologic and clinical studies, and clinical management.

 Background
Episodic migraine (EM) and chronic migraine (CM) are
primarily differentiated by monthly headache days, with
EM having fewer than 15 headache days per month and
CM having 15 or more headache days per month for at
least three months [1]. The epidemiologic profiles of
people with EM and CM are well characterized [2–5], as
are annual rates of CM remission and CM onset from 1
year to the next [6]. However, relatively little is known
about the longitudinal within-person variation in self-
reported headache frequency when assessed repeatedly
over the course of 1 year.
Migraine can be characterized as a chronic disorder
with episodic attacks [7]. Within-person variation in head-
ache days per month logically influences the epidemio-
logic estimates of EM and CM incidence and persistence
reported in the literature [2–5], as well as the assessment
of treatment response. However, epidemiology studies, for
the most part, have evaluated incidence, persistence, re-
mission, and disease progression by examining only two
adjacent points in time. Furthermore, typically, only group
mean data are reported. The natural within-person vari-
ation in headache day frequency, which is the fundamental
driver of the instability in diagnostic classification for EM
and CM reported in the literature, has been studied inad-
equately, if at all. Understanding of this natural history has
been obscured in epidemiologic studies because of infre-
quent repeated measures and the emphasis on aggregated
rather than within-person data.
To better characterize within-person change in head-
ache days we analyzed longitudinal data from the Chronic
Migraine Epidemiology and Outcomes (CaMEO) Study
[8]. We examined transitions from EM to CM and from
CM to EM. Of primary importance, we modelled nat-
ural history of self-reported headache day variation in
quarterly assessments across the span of 15 months.
Natural history of headache frequency was modeled ac-
counting for both within-person and between-person
changes in headache days per month. These findings
have implications for classification and diagnosis, the
design and conduct of observational studies, and for
the design, management, and interpretation of random-
ized controlled trials (RCTs).
Methods
CaMEO study design and baseline survey
The CaMEO Study used a web-based panel (Research
Now) constructed to be demographically representative of
the US population, as previously detailed [8]. The baseline
survey, e-mailed to participants, assessed headache symp-
toms and severity, headache frequency, headache-related
disability, healthcare consulting and utilization, medica-
tion use for headache, comorbid medical and psychiatric
conditions, and family-related burden associated with
headache (Fig. 1).
Ethics, consent and permissions
Independent ethics committee approval was obtained
before initiation of the CaMEO Study. Given that par-
ticipation by individuals in the web-based survey was
voluntary and that survey research does not expose
respondents to known health risks, informed consent
was not requested. No person-level identifiable data are
included in this study report.
Study classifications of EM and CM
Respondents were identified as having migraine if they
met modified International Classification of Headache
Disorders Third edition (beta version) (ICHD-3 [beta])
criteria [1]. Among those with migraine, respondents
were classified as having CM if they reported ≥15 head-
ache days per month averaged over the preceding 90 days
(i.e., the Silberstein-Lipton approach [9]), otherwise they
were classified as having EM. This definition of CM
differs from standard ICHD-3 (beta) criteria by not re-
quiring that headaches on eight of the 15 headache days
per month be migraine (Criterion C).
Questionnaire
Of the 58,418 respondents to the baseline survey,
16,789 met criteria for EM or CM and received follow-
up surveys at three-month intervals from September
2012 to November 2013. The baseline and four quar-
terly follow-up assessments constituted the five quar-
terly waves of data collection in the CaMEO Study, as
previously described [8].
Headache frequency was assessed in all five waves
using a question from the MIDAS questionnaire about
the number of headache days over the last three months
[10]. The three-month estimate was rescaled to a
monthly estimate by dividing by three, paralleling the
approach taken in the American Migraine Prevalence
and Prevention (AMPP) study [3]. A diagnosis of EM or
CM was assigned at each quarterly assessment. In
addition, a continuous measure of headache days per
month was retained to model variation in headache days
within- and between-persons.
Sociodemographic covariates assessed at baseline
included sex (female vs. male), employment status
(full-time/part-time employment vs. other), education
(college graduate or higher vs. less than college),
race (Caucasian vs. non-Caucasian), Hispanic ethnicity
(Hispanic vs. not), health insurance status (having health
insurance vs. not), household income at or above the
national median, and personal income at or above the
national median. The two income variables were coded
based on median income estimates obtained from the

 2012 American Community Survey conducted by the Na-
tional Census Bureau [11].
In addition, the Migraine Disability Assessment ques-
tionnaire (MIDAS) categories were used as a disability
covariate, with categories of zero to five indicating no
disability (Grade I), six to 10 indicating mild disability
(Grade II), 11–20 indicating moderate disability (Grade
III), 21–40 indicating severe disability (Grade IV-A), and
≥41 indicating very severe disability (Grade IV-B) [4]. A
count of the self-report of physician diagnosis of comor-
bid conditions was used to generate a comorbidity index;
included conditions were asthma, diabetes, high blood
pressure, overactive bladder, shingles or herpes zoster,
and post-herpetic neuropathy, with a count range of
zero (no comorbidities) to six (all comorbidities). Lastly,
age at migraine onset reported at baseline and migraine
duration (age at baseline minus reported age at migraine
onset) were included as disease duration covariates.
The longitudinal wave-specific participation rates for
the total sample and stratified by baseline EM and CM
status have been presented previously [8]; rates of
participation were nearly identical between baseline EM
and CM over time.
Analyses
Analysis first measured longitudinal persistence of base-
line EM and CM classification, while accounting for at-
trition patterns in participation [8]. Analysis was also
completed to model variation in average monthly head-
ache days using the longitudinal negative binomial
mixed effect models. Orthogonal polynomial terms were
used to characterize the longitudinal variation in repeated
measures trends and random effects were employed to ac-
count for subject-level variance in repeated measures.
Technical details of the model building process are avail-
able in a separate document. Interested readers may re-
quest this document from the first author.
After determining the best-fitting mixed-effect polyno-
mial parameterization, two primary models were fit. The
first was an unadjusted model that included only the re-
peated measures trend terms and main effects and inter-
actions between the repeated measures trend terms and
EM/CM status (with EM as reference). The second
model adjusted the first with the incorporation of demo-
graphic characteristics as well as MIDAS disability,
comorbidity count, and disease duration covariates. For
the adjusted models, EM and CM status varied over
time while all other covariates were entered as predictors
based on their baseline status. The GLIMMIX procedure
as implemented in SAS (Version 9.2) was used to esti-
mate negative binomial models. All available data were
used. Respondents with baseline data only contributed
to the estimation of the intercept only. Respondents with
more than a single wave of data contributed to estimates
of longitudinal trends.
Results
Previously presented data [8] on the sampling design
and participation rates will be reviewed to contextualize
our findings. Sampling response, attrition, and cleaning
rates have been published previously (see Table 2 in
Manack et al. 2015) [8]. Of the 16,789 respondents with

 EM or CM at baseline, (wave one), 10,023 (59.7%)
responded and 9741 provided clean and useable returns
(58.0% of the baseline sample) at wave two. For subse-
quent waves, data are available for 7517 participants at
wave three, 6363 participants for wave four and 5915
participants at wave five (Fig. 2). The attrition rate
decreased with increasing follow-up.
The stability in headache diagnosis was examined de-
scriptively by evaluating the proportion of individuals
whose headache diagnosis was maintained across all
waves (Table 1). The variation in headache diagnosis was
examined by evaluating the proportion of individuals
who had at least one wave with the alternative diagnosis.
Among the 5464 respondents with EM at baseline pro-
viding four or five waves of data, 5048 (92.4%) had EM
at all waves and 416 (7.6%) had CM in at least one wave.
Among 526 respondents with CM at baseline providing
four or five waves of data, 140 had CM at every wave
(26.6%) and 386 (73.4%) had EM for at least one wave.
We modeled headache days per month at three-month
intervals using linear, quadratic and cubic polynomial
trends for time as well as measures of headache status.
In these models, each individual subject is a random ef-
fect while the fixed effects represent average trends. As
seen in Table 2, relatively large random-effect variances
were observed for the polynomial trend terms, including
the intercept (0.82), linear trend (0.17), and quadratic
trend (0.09), as well as the negative binomial scaling
variance parameter (0.09). These random effects reflect
the substantial individual variation in monthly headache
days. Plots of headache days at an individual-level re-
vealed substantial subject-specific differences and strik-
ing curvatures (Additional file 1: Figure. S1). In addition,
many fixed-effect estimates were statistically significant.
The significant linear trend by headache status inter-
action indicated that headache days per wave changed
differently for those with EM vs CM. Headache days per
wave decreased slightly in the EM group and increased
slightly in the CM group. This difference in change
resulted in a rate of headache day increase of 19% more
per wave for CM compared to EM (rate ratio [RR], 1.19;
95% CI 1.13–1.26).
In Table 3, we augmented the unadjusted model with
a set of covariates which diminished the random-effect
variance estimates compared with the unadjusted model,
particularly the baseline variance (intercept random ef-
fect). After adjustment, the random effect variance esti-
mates for the intercept was 0.52, with limited or no
reductions in the linear trend variance (0.15), quadratic
trend variance (0.09), and the negative binomial scaling
variance (0.08) (Table 3). Nearly all fixed effects were
statistically significant in the final model. After adjust-
ment, the headache status by linear trend interactions
revealed that headache days per month increased 26%
more per wave for CM compared to EM (RR, 1.26; 95%
CI, 1.20–1.33). Figure 3 demonstrates how closely pre-

 are shrunken toward the mean relative to the observed
values, they recover the observed value oscillations quite
well. Figure 4 presents a plot of the EM- and CM-
specific longitudinal trajectories characterizing this inter-
action. One can see that headache frequency for EM
diminishes over time. In contrast, headache frequency
oscillates for CM, but the overall trend is one of subtle
increase. The reported rate ratios of 1.19 and 1.26
(adjusted) arise from this difference between headache
frequency decreasing over time for EM while increasing
over time for CM.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that in persons with migraine
assessed at three-month intervals, there are frequent tran-
sitions between CM and EM with substantial within-
person variation in the number of headache days per
month over the course of 15 months. Random-effect vari-
ance estimates demonstrated that there was significant
temporal variability in headache days, both within and be-
tween the EM and CM populations. We observed statisti-
cally significant increases in headache frequency for CM
relative to EM over time, both before and after adjust-
ment for potential confounders. The high rates of
transition between EM and CM have implications for
headache classification and diagnosis, epidemiologic
studies and clinical trial design.
Implications for headache classification, diagnosis, and
clinical practice
We found that 73.4% of people with CM at baseline and
four or five follow-up waves of data had at least 1 three-
month period when they did not meet the 15 or more
headache day per month criteria for CM. Among
persons with EM at baseline and four or five waves of
follow-up, 7.6% had at least one period when they met
the headache frequency criteria for CM. These findings
suggest that over the course of 15 months, transitions

 between EM and CM are very common. In clinical
practice, headache diagnosis is often assumed to be
relatively stable for an individual, and yet we have found
headache frequency changes substantially over time,
potentially
moving
individuals
between
diagnostic
categories (i.e., between EM and CM). When a person
transitions from 16 headache days per month to 14
headache days per month, their ICHD-3 (beta) diagnos-
tic label may change but the biology of their disorder
most likely does not. The finding that headache day
frequency within an individual changes substantially over
time poses a considerable challenge to headache classifi-
cation, diagnosis and subsequently clinical management.
As diagnosis is intended to reflect a relatively stable set
of clinical features and is used to predict treatment
response and clinical course, this level of diagnostic in-
stability is disconcerting. Perhaps headache days alone
are not sufficiently stable to be the basis for distinguish-
ing two related nosological entities such as EM and CM.
We believe that there are more severe and less severe
migraine biological subtypes of migraine, imperfectly
differentiated by headache days criteria as EM and CM.
Future work could focus on identifying trait predictors
of biotype, rather than time-varying features such as
headache days per month.
When it comes to interpreting the effects of preventive
treatment in practice, we often rely on a short-term
reduction in headache days per month. The present
findings suggest that at least part of the improvements
we attribute to our treatments in practice may represent
variation in headache days unrelated to treatment. This
hypothesis requires further exploration by examining
changes in headache days associated with stable treat-
ment and with changes in treatment.
Implications for epidemiologic studies
Among people with EM at baseline, when assessed every
three months, 7.6% of individuals met headache day cri-
teria for CM at least once over a 15-month period. This
is much larger than the 2.5% rate of CM onset in per-
sons with EM we reported after 1 year of follow-up in
the AMPP study [12]. This apparent three-fold increased
rate of CM onset in persons with EM with more fre-
quent assessments, when coupled with the evidence of

Page 7 of 12
 transition from CM to EM, suggests that in studies using
annual assessments, persons whose CM developed and
remitted over the course of the year may be missed.
Prior studies have also examined risk factors for CM
[3, 13–16] and rates and risk factors for the remission of
CM [12, 17, 18]. Previously reported factors associated
with an increased risk of CM onset include headache fea-
tures (such as cutaneous allodynia) [19], a broad array of
comorbidities (including depression, allergic rhinitis, and
asthma) [15] and poor acute treatment optimization
among others [12]. Given the observed relative fluid and
repeated movement across the “boundary” of 15 headache
days per month in this systematically recruited sample of
persons with migraine, the underlying framing of these
studies may need to be reconsidered. The defining feature
of CM, the number of headache days per month over
three months in a person with migraine, may reflect a
process of continuous change within a single classification
of migraine and not a change in the classification of dis-
ease as implied by the previous framing. It is likely that
more frequent sampling will identify both higher rates of
CM onset and stronger associations between risk factors
and this outcome.
Implications for clinical trial design
Studies of CM use symptom profiles and headache day
frequency to determine participation eligibility [20]. In
preventive treatment trials of CM, individuals judged by
a clinician to have CM typically enter into a four-week
diary study prior to study enrollment. If individuals have
<15 headache days per month they are deemed ineligible
for enrollment into the study. If they have ≥15 headache
days per month they are likely to be eligible and offered
enrollment into the study. The primary endpoint in pre-
vention trials is typically the change from baseline in the
number of headache days per 28-day period on active
drug vs. placebo or an active comparator [20]. Change in
headache day frequency is typically assessed across two
periods (from baseline to follow-up). The spontaneous
and rarely measured variation in headache days provides
a backdrop for interpreting treatment effects in individ-
uals. There is a substantial probability that persons with
CM at baseline will experience reductions unrelated to
treatment in headache days as illustrated by the data re-
ported here. Enrolling people with headache days above
a threshold may lead to regression to the mean and high
“placebo rates” [20]. This in turn can lead to modest

 therapeutic gains when active drug and placebo are
compared [21]. We suggest that the high rate of spon-
taneous reduction in headache day frequency in RCTs
may have contributed to what is widely regarded as an
inescapably large placebo effect. This high presumed pla-
cebo effect observed in several studies may simply reflect
the cyclic nature of CM [22–25].
When the results of our analysis (Fig. 3) are consid-
ered, one would expect that a majority of subjects
selected at any high monthly headache-frequency value
would, within three months, have a period of low
headache-frequency suggesting that the high placebo
rate may be, at least in part, an artifact of inclusion cri-
teria interacting with the natural history of headache fre-
quency. To empirically evaluate this point, we took the
data from the CaMEO Study analyzed here, and looked
at two waves of data. In the next three paragraphs we
demonstrate that by selecting two waves of data and
computing change in headache frequency between the
two waves, headache frequency decreases for CM in a
context where models fit to all waves demonstrated that
frequency actually increased for CM. This calls into
question the interpretability of two time-point change
computations for headache frequency outcomes in both
epidemiology studies and clinical trials.
Change in one-month recall of headache frequency
was compared across two pairs of complete data from
the CaMEO Study waves. The first pair was composed
of waves one and two, which, with three months be-
tween them, directly mimics the assessment interval for
the placebo arm in many prophylaxis trials. The second
pair assessed longer-term change and was composed of
waves one and five. Two variables were considered: (1)
raw headache frequency and (2) change in headache fre-
quency (headache frequency reported in the follow-up
wave minus that reported in wave one). The effect of
interest was whether change in headache frequency
across the waves was different for EM and CM. Descrip-
tive statistics, including wave EM- and CM-specific sam-
ple sizes and means for these three variables are given in
Table 4. For the wave-specific headache frequency vari-
ables, a repeated measures negative binomial model was
parameterized to calculate the difference between waves
and estimate the difference in this difference between
EM and CM through a time-by-headache status inter-
action
term.
The resulting
time-by-headache status
interaction RR emerging from this model along with the
corresponding 95% CI and P values are reported in
Table 4. This model was employed because it matches
the modeling framework for the other models reported
in this paper. For the variable in which change from
baseline was calculated, a simple one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was conducted in which the only ef-
fect was baseline headache status. This model estimated
the mean difference in change in headache frequency be-
tween baseline and follow-up between EM and CM,
treating EM as the reference group. The resulting mean
difference and corresponding 95% CI and P values are
reported in Table 4.
In both cases (wave one and two pairing or wave one
and five pairing), the results were identical. It appears
that no matter what pairing of waves is used, headache
frequency significantly decreases for CM, while headache
frequency for EM remains mostly constant. The change
in headache frequency for CM was so great that at
follow-up the average headache frequency would have
resulted in the average population being classified as
having achieved CM remission in both wave pairings
through the natural history of the condition alone. The
reported RRs for the time-by-baseline headache status
interaction and the ANOVA mean difference support
this conclusion and indicate that the CM reduction in
headache frequency between wave pairings was statisti-
cally significantly greater than that of EM.
Results presented here suggest that when subject se-
lection is made on the basis of high frequency of head-
ache days at baseline, as a direct consequence of the
cyclical nature of monthly headache day frequency, there
is a nontrivial probability that within a short period of
time, headache frequency will organically fall to lower
levels. However, and most importantly, headache day
frequency does not remain low, and for a sizeable num-
ber of people, headache frequency values return to even
higher levels. This appears as a fundamental paradox: in
the full data headache frequency for CM increases over
time while comparisons between pairs of waves suggest
that headache frequency decreases for CM. This paradox
is related to a variant of the Yule-Simpson effect [26],
where conclusions are distorted by specific binning or
grouping of the data that is not representative of the
true global trend in the phenomenon. Results presented
in this manuscript would suggest that variation in head-
ache frequency is substantial. Moreover, the practice in
RCTs of restricting attention to a baseline period ob-
tained through selection based on a high frequency of
headache days in the baseline period coupled with exam-
ination of only a single subsequent follow-up period
leads to the frequently observed placebo effect for CM
prophylaxis
trials.
The
use
of
more
sensitive
and
sophisticated designs and analyses may enable more
accurate
characterization
of
longitudinal
headache
epidemiology and determine with greater certainty the
efficacy of treatment.
Strengths and limitations

aSample sizes were based on complete case data, and are therefore lower for the second time contrast than the first because less subjects chose to respond to the survey by wave 5 than wave 2. The combined
sample sizes are less than the wave 2 or wave 5 sample sizes respectively (i.e., 4407 + 502 = 4909, which is <5915) because the complete case data restriction also required the same subjects contribute data on the
past month HA frequency variable at both the baseline and follow-up assessments

fRaw means, raw RRs, and random-effect model-based rate ratios indicate that HA frequency for CM declines over time while HA frequency for EM remains stable. Moreover, CM declines more as the amount of time
between assessments increases (2 waves vs. 5). Specifically, with only three months between assessment, HA frequency declines 33% more for CM than EM (100*[1–0.67]), while HA frequency declines 36% more for
CM than EM (100*[1–0.64]) when the time between assessments is 12 months

 follow-up interval over a period of 15 months and our
well-accepted modeling strategy. Limitations include the
modest participation rate and the relatively high drop-out
rate from wave to wave. The modest participation rate is
offset in part by the evidence that results from the
CaMEO Study are largely comparable to those from the
larger AMPP study [6] and the non-responder study that
did not provide any suggestion of participation bias [8]. As
headache frequency varies over longer periods, modeling
headache days using control theory–based models may
provide better long-term characterization of the natural
history of migraine across multiple intervals. Furthermore,
the dynamic nature of migraine (transitioning between
EM and CM) needs to be considered when a categorical
description (i.e., EM or CM) is captured at baseline or in-
dividual time points. For example, a person categorized as
having EM at baseline may have been classified with CM
previously.
In addition, this study used modified ICHD-3 criteria
which did not confirm ≥ five lifetime migraine events (cri-
terion A) or duration of attack untreated from four to
72 h (criterion B). Likewise, the definition of CM did not
include criterion C which states that migraine occurred
≥ 8 days per month. Confirmation of these parameters is
difficult to evaluate via self-report retrospective surveys
and requires data collection via diary cards and physician
interview to verify.
Conclusions
Results confirm that there is substantial variation in
headache day frequency in people with EM and CM
followed at three-month intervals. Transitions from EM
to CM are more common (7.6%) than previously ob-
served when sampled less frequently; in addition, nearly
75% of people with CM will remit to EM at some point
during a 12-month period. More research is required to
more fully understand the implications of these findings.
Importantly, this natural variation should be considered
when designing epidemiologic and clinical trials and
when clinicians diagnose, treat and study CM.
