 Abstract
Background
Heatwaves are a critical public health problem. There will be an increase in the frequency
and severity of heatwaves under changing climate. However, evidence about the impacts of
climate change on heatwave-related mortality at a global scale is limited.
Methods and findings
We collected historical daily time series of mean temperature and mortality for all causes or non-
external causes, in periods ranging from January 1, 1984, to December 31, 2015, in 412 com-
munities within 20 countries/regions. We estimated heatwave–mortality associations through a
two-stage time series design. Current and future daily mean temperature series were projected
under four scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions from 1971–2099, with five general circulation
models. We projected excess mortality in relation to heatwaves in the future under each scenario
of greenhouse gas emissions, with two assumptions for adaptation (no adaptation and hypothet-
ical adaptation) and three scenarios of population change (high variant, median variant, and low
variant). Results show that, if there is no adaptation, heatwave-related excess mortality is
expected to increase the most in tropical and subtropical countries/regions (close to the equator),
while European countries and the United States will have smaller percent increases in heat-
wave-related excess mortality. The higher the population variant and the greenhouse gas emis-
sions, the higher the increase of heatwave-related excess mortality in the future. The changes in
2031–2080 compared with 1971–2020 range from approximately 2,000% in Colombia to 150%
in Moldova under the highest emission scenario and high-variant population scenario, without
any adaptation. If we considered hypothetical adaptation to future climate, under high-variant
population scenario and all scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions, the heatwave-related
excess mortality is expected to still increase across all the countries/regions except Moldova and
Japan. However, the increase would be much smaller than the no adaptation scenario. The sim-
ple assumptions with respect to adaptation as follows: no adaptation and hypothetical adaptation
results in some uncertainties of projections.
Conclusions
This study provides a comprehensive characterisation of future heatwave-related excess
mortality across various regions and under alternative scenarios of greenhouse gas emis-
sions, different assumptions of adaptation, and different scenarios of population change.
The projections can help decision makers in planning adaptation and mitigation strategies
for climate change.

 • There will be an increase in the frequency and severity of heatwaves in the future world-
wide because of climate change.
• Evidence about the impacts of climate change on heatwave-related mortality at a global
scale is limited.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We developed a model to estimate heatwave–mortality associations in 412 communities
within 20 countries/regions from January 1, 1984 to December 31, 2015. The associa-
tions were used to project heatwave-related excess mortality, with projected daily mean
temperature series from four scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions during 1971–2099.
• We used three scenarios of population changes (low, moderate, and high variant) and
two adaptation scenarios (no adaptation and hypothetical adaptation).
• If people cannot adapt to future climate change, heatwave-related excess mortality is
expected to increase the most in tropical and subtropical countries/regions, while Euro-
pean countries and the United States will have smaller increases. The more serious the
greenhouse gas emissions, the higher the heatwave-related excess mortality in the
future.
• If people have ability to adapt to future climate change, the heatwave-related excess
mortality is expected to still increase in future under the most serious greenhouse gas
emissions and high-variant population scenarios. However, the increase is expected to
be much smaller than the no adaptation scenario.
What do these findings mean?
• Future changes in heatwave-related excess mortality are highly affected by greenhouse
gas emissions and human adaptation to climate change.
• Stricter mitigation policy to reduce greenhouse gas emission is expected to produce
greater health benefits related to heatwaves.
• Adaptation strategies should be planned to reduce the health impacts of heatwaves in all
the countries/regions, particularly developing countries in tropic and subtropical
regions.
Introduction
A heatwave is often defined as hot outdoor temperature or hot weather that lasts for several
days that is outside the normal range of ambient temperatures [1]. Heatwaves can cause heat
exhaustion, heat oedema, heat cramps, heat syncope, and heatstroke [2]. They are related to
acute cerebrovascular accidents, aggravate chronic pulmonary conditions, cardiac conditions,
kidney disorders, and psychiatric illness [3, 4]. Heatwaves can cause a significant impact on
population health, including a rise in mortality [5] and morbidity [6]. A number of major heat-
wave events occurred over the past decade, many of which had devastating effects [7–9]. For

 example, the European heatwaves in the summer of 2003 were responsible for the deaths of
tens of thousands of people [10]. The 2010 Russian heatwaves killed the estimated 55,000 peo-
ple [11]. Importantly, heatwaves have a greater impact on mortality or morbidity than the
reported number of deaths or cases due to classical heat illness (e.g., thermoplegia, heatstroke,
heat cramp, and heat syncope), because heatwaves also induce the onset of other diseases, for
example, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes. Thus, heatwaves are a crit-
ical public health problem.
There will be an increase in the frequency and severity of heatwaves as the globe warms up
[12]. An important aspect of understanding the overall risk of climate change for human
health is how heatwaves could affect mortality and morbidity under a changing climate [13].
Population vulnerability to heatwaves is strongly influenced by social and physical environ-
ments. Thus, the associations between heatwaves and health effects differ by cities, countries,
and regions [5]. However, little attention so far has been paid to the projections of heatwave
effects across different regions using the same method [14, 15]. To date, most projections of
heatwave-related deaths are limited to a few cities/one country or used a small number of cli-
mate models [14, 15]. Therefore, the usage of data from different countries and climate zones
may help reveal potential spatial heterogeneity in heatwave-related excess mortality and
projections.
Our previous study showed the temperatures associated with the lowest mortality averages
around the 75th percentile of ambient temperature in all the countries/regions [16]. This per-
centile of temperature varies slightly by region, suggesting that populations have possibly
adapted to some degree to their local climate type. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that people
may also have the ability to adapt to increases in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves
through adaptation interventions, up to physiological limits. The degree of adaptation to heat-
waves is probably explained, in large part, by six levels of adaptation interventions, including
individual, interpersonal, community, institutional, environmental, and public policy levels
(Table 1). These adaptation interventions could change the human physiology and behaviours

 affecting the impacts of high temperatures. The details of this process are complex and not
completely understood but include physiological change (e.g., rise in core temperature), beha-
vioural changes (e.g., time spent outdoors, clothing, physical activity, healthy lifestyles),
improving health services, and environmental improvements (e.g., thermal properties and
nature of the built environment including building design and city planning) [3]. Thus, more
robust estimates would be generated by accounting for the uncertainties in heatwave adapta-
tion when projecting future heatwave-related excess mortality.
This study aimed to quantify the excess deaths associated with heatwaves in 412 communi-
ties in 20 countries/regions, for the period of 2031–2080 under several global climate change
scenarios. An important aspect of this analysis was the partitioning of uncertainties from dif-
ferent sources in the estimation of the excess deaths attributable to heatwaves, including those
from statistical variation, climate models, climate change scenarios, adaptation, and popula-
tion change.
Methods
Data collection
Historical data on mortality and weather.
We partly described data collection in our
previous publications [5, 16, 18–21]. A detailed description of the data is provided in S1
Appendix. In brief, since 2012, we have developed a Multi-City Multi-Country (MCC) Collab-
orative Research Network (http://mccstudy.lshtm.ac.uk/) to collect historical data on weather
and mortality. In this study, we used daily time series data from 412 communities within 20
countries/regions (Fig 1). The study periods overlapped largely, ranging from January 1, 1984,
to December 31, 2015 (Table 2). The dataset included observed daily time series for deaths
counts for all causes or nonexternal causes (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]—
ICD-9: 0–799; ICD-10: A00–R99) and daily mean temperature, in addition to weather

 variables (daily minimum and maximum temperatures and relative humidity). The observed
daily mean temperature was measured as the average across 24 h or between maximum and
minimum daily temperature from a single or multiple monitoring stations within the adminis-
trative boundaries of each community. Community-specific metavariables include weather
indices derived from the series of observed temperatures (e.g., average and range of annual,
summer, and winter temperatures), climatological zones based the Ko
¨ppen–Geiger classifica-
tion, and country-specific gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.
Projected daily temperature series under climate change scenarios.
We obtained cli-
mate projections from a database developed under the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercom-
parison Project (ISIMIP, https://www.isimip.org/), in the form of daily temperature series for
historical (1950–2005) and future (2006–2100) periods. The ISIMIP database includes single
runs of General Circulation Models (GCMs) developed within the Coupled Model Intercom-
parison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Four greenhouse gas emission scenarios (Representative
Concentration Pathway [RCP]2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) [22], described in the Fifth
Assessment Report (AR5) of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), were used. Specifically, the ISIMIP Fast Track database provides temperature series
for each RCP for five GCMs, namely GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIRO-
C-ESM-CHEM, and NorESM1-M.15. These GCMs are representative of the range of

 projections of future climate across the CMIP5 models [23]. The model outputs were bias-cor-
rected and downscaled through bi-linear interpolation at a 0.5˚ × 0.5˚ spatial resolution and
linear interpolated by day of the year [24]. The modelled daily temperature series for each of
the 412 communities in the period 1971–2099 were extracted by linking the coordinates with
the corresponding grid cells of the climate projections.
The five GCMs reproduced the temperature distribution during the observed period with
reasonable accuracy [25]. Differences between the observed and modelled temperature series
can occur for several reasons, including different resolution of the data (point sources versus
gridded) and poor performance of climate models in areas with sparse information from mete-
orological stations [26, 27]. Non-negligible deviations between the two sources can produce
biased results in the impact projections, in which the modelled temperature series are applied
to exposure–response relationships estimated using observed temperature. For this reason, we
additionally corrected modelled temperature series using the bias-correction method devel-
oped and applied in ISIMIP [24]. This approach produced recalibrated modelled temperature
series using the monthly mean and the daily variability around the monthly mean of observed
temperature series. This calibration method ensures that the trend (i.e., the warming signal) in
the original data is preserved.
Population scenarios.
We downloaded the population prospects under three fertility sce-
narios (high variant, medium variant, and low variant) from the UN Population Division dur-
ing 1950 and 2099, for each country (https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/). As the population
prospects data is only available for the country level, we assumed that the change of population
in each city was the same as its nationwide population prospect trend. Then, we calculated the
annual population data for each city for the years 1950–2099.
Data analysis
Heatwave definition.
There is no universally accepted definition of a heatwave, but most
incorporate notions of intense heat experienced over a period of days [5]. In the present study,
relative thresholds based on the community’s recent long-term daily mean temperature were
used to define heatwaves, as they describe historic regional acclimatization to temperatures
that were normal for a community. Heatwaves in each of the communities were defined as at
least two consecutive days with daily mean temperature exceeding the 95th percentile of the
year-round daily temperatures of that city from recent data (i.e., the years representing ‘cur-
rent’ data).
Historic heatwave–mortality relationships.
We estimated the association between heat-
waves and risk of mortality in each community separately based on the years of data within the
‘current’ timeframe. The analyses were limited to the hot season (four hottest months) for each
community. The heatwave–mortality association was examined with a two-stage analytic
approach previously applied in an analysis of the historical mortality risk associated with heat-
waves using a subset of the same dataset [5].
In the first stage, we used a time series Poisson regression model for hot season data to
obtain community-specific estimates allowing for over-dispersed death counts. Seasonality
was controlled for using a natural cubic spline with 4 degrees of freedom (equally spaced
knots) for day of the season. Long-term trend was controlled for using a natural cubic spline
with 1 degree of freedom per 10 years. A categorical variable was used to control for the poten-
tial confounding effect of day of the week. As the effects of heatwaves on mortality usually
appeared immediately and lasted for several days, a natural cubic spline with 4 degrees of free-
dom was used to capture the distributed lag effect of waves (as a 0–1 variable) over time, up to
10 days [5]. The residual deviance was used to check the model fit, which is a standard method

 for time series analysis of the associations between air pollution/temperature and mortality
[28]. We chose the last year’s data as test data and other years’ data as training data for each
city, to cross-validate our model. The cross-validation indicated that our model had a high pre-
dictive ability, with correlation of R2 = 0.9 between predicted deaths and observed deaths dur-
ing heatwave days (Fig A in S1 Appendix).
In the second stage, we modelled the community-specific effect estimates of the overall
cumulative risk ratios (lag 0–10 days) associated with heatwaves using a meta-regression [21].
The meta-regression included a set of meta-predictors to capture part of the heterogeneity
across locations (specifically, indicators for country, indicators for climate classification, and
indicators for community-specific hot season average and range of temperature). We then
derived the best linear unbiased prediction of the overall cumulative association in each com-
munity by the meta-regression, expressed as relative risk. This meta-prediction is only per-
formed for the historical data and not for future data.
Projection of future heatwave-related excess mortality.
Using the daily mean tempera-
ture output from each of five GCMs for the timeframe representing ‘future’ years, we calcu-
lated the number of heatwaves per year and the total number of heatwave days under a
changing climate [14]. We calculated expected excess deaths during heatwave days per year for
each set of climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) and GCMs, from
which we can compute the statistics of change. The expected number of excess deaths during a
given heatwave period was calculated for each community as follows:
EDHW ¼ N � ðRR � 1Þ � HWN
N ¼ POP � MR;
in which EDHW is excess deaths related to heatwaves; N is the average number of deaths on
non-heatwave days (calculated from the ‘current’ years); HWN is the number of the future
heatwave days; and RR is the relative risk of mortality in relation to heatwaves. POP is annual
population, and MR is daily mortality rate (MR) across all non-heatwave days from the histori-
cal data for each community. To quantify the overall mortality impact of heatwaves, we com-
puted the annual excess mortality attributable to heatwaves, which is the expected number of
deaths in a 1-year period caused by all heatwaves in that year [3]. This summary of health
impact incorporates the change in both the rate at which heatwaves occur and the number of
heatwaves in the future. We calculated this summary in the two time periods (1971–2020 for
present day and 2031–2080 for the future period), summing the excess deaths across all heat-
waves and dividing by the total number of years. Then, we calculated the percent change for
the period 2031–2080, using the period 1971–2020 as the baseline reference.
Uncertainty assessment
It is clear that HWN will be affected by the threshold definition of heatwaves in the future. If
we assumed humans would not acclimatise/adapt to the warming temperature, the future heat-
wave threshold should be the same as present absolute temperature threshold in each commu-
nity. While the actual adaptation mechanisms and timing are unknown, if we assumed human
acclimatise/adapt to the warming temperature with the same response relative to the tempera-
ture distribution, the future heatwave threshold would be defined by using the same percentile
temperature (95th percentile) within its period 2031–2080 in each community. Thus, to better
understand the impacts of future heatwaves, we considered these uncertainties on heatwave
adaptation by using two assumptions: 1) no adaptation (using current heatwave threshold)
and 2) hypothetical adaptation (heatwave threshold was defined by using the future 95th

 percentile of temperature, reflecting extreme adaptation through six levels of adaptation inter-
ventions [Table 1]). We also considered three population scenarios in the future: 1) high vari-
ant, 2) median variant, and 3) low variant. We assumed no change in demographic
distribution or baseline mortality rate. In other words, our estimates of excess mortality from
heatwaves represent the projected impact of climate change and population change, not the
combined impact of changes in other characteristics, such as demographic distribution, mor-
tality rate, and socioeconomic factors.
Other sources of uncertainty in the excess deaths are related to the estimate of the expo-
sure-response relationships and the variability in temperature projections between GCMs
[21]. These quantities are represented by the variance of the model coefficient and the variabil-
ity of the five future daily temperature series generated in each RCP, respectively. We quanti-
fied this uncertainty by generating 1,000 samples of the coefficients through Monte Carlo
simulations, assuming a normal distribution for the estimated coefficients, and then generat-
ing results for each of the five GCMs. We reported the results as point estimates, using the
average across climate models (GCM ensemble) obtained by the estimated coefficients, and as
empirical confidence intervals (eCIs), defined as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the empiri-
cal distribution across coefficients samples and GCMs. These empirical 95% eCI account for
both sources of uncertainty. A quantitative comparison of the two components is provided by
the ratio between the average standard deviation of the empirical distribution within each
GCM and the standard deviation of the average value between GCMs.
Results
We analysed multicountry data for 412 communities within 20 countries/regions (Table 2). It
covers nine regions characterised by different climatic conditions: North America, Central
America, South America, northern Europe, central Europe, southern Europe, East Asia, South-
east Asia, and Oceania. The dataset included 79,287,540 deaths observed within overlapping
current periods. The 95th percentile of temperature is projected to increase the most in 2031–
2080 under RCP8.5, while a small increase is estimated under RCP2.6. Similar patterns are
projected for the mean of daily temperature (Table A in S1 Appendix). Population will
increase under the high-variant scenario in all countries except Japan and Moldova (Table 2).
Most cities had significant relative risks of mortality associated with heatwaves (Table B in S1
Appendix).
Fig 1 shows the percent change of heatwave-related excess mortality in the period 2031–
2080 compared to the period 1971–2020 (representing the present day), under RCP8.5 and the
high-variant population scenario, without any adaptation. The change in future heatwave-
related excess mortality varies by community. But there is a clear pattern that communities
close to the equator or located in tropical or subtropical climates are projected to have a large
increase. Communities located in temperate regions are projected to experience a relatively
small increase. The results from different population scenarios (high variant, median variant,
and low variant) and different greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0,
and RCP8.5) show similar spatial patterns (Fig B-L in S1 Appendix). But the magnitude of the
change varies by scenario.
If we didn’t consider any adaptation, heatwave-related excess mortality is expected to
increase the most in tropical and subtropical countries/regions, with the highest increase in
Colombia, followed by Philippines and Brazil (Fig 2). European countries and the US are
expected to have smaller percent increases. For all the countries, RCP8.5 will have a higher
change than the other three RCPs in the same period. For the same RCP, the high-variant pop-
ulation scenario produce higher increases than the low-variant and median-variant population

 scenarios. The details for the effect estimates and 95% eCIs are shown in Table C in S1 Appen-
dix. Table E in S1 Appendix shows the predicted annual average deaths related to heatwaves
in the period 1971–2020.
If we considered hypothetical adaptation to the 95th percentile temperature, the increases
are much lower than those without accounting for adaptation (Fig 3 and Table D in S1
Appendix). For the high-variant population scenario, the heatwave-related excess mortality is
expected to increase in all the countries/regions except Moldova and Japan, under all scenarios
of greenhouse gas emissions. For the low-variant population scenario, heatwave-related excess
mortality is expected to decrease in Italy, Japan, Moldova, and Spain, under all the scenarios of
greenhouse gas emissions. The decreases in heatwave-related excess mortality in Japan and
Moldova are mainly driven by population decrease in the future (Table 2). The results for each
community are similar to the country/region level results (Fig M-X in S1 Appendix).
Discussion
We estimated future changes in heatwave-related excess mortality for 412 communities in 20
countries/regions, using five GCMs and four RCPs. To the best of our knowledge, this study is
by far the largest international study for the potential health impacts associated with heatwaves
under climate change scenarios. The assessment includes and compares results from hundreds
of locations across regions of the world, characterised by different climates, socioeconomic
and demographic conditions, and levels of development of infrastructures and public health

 services. The analysis applies advanced analytical methods to project heatwave-related mortal-
ity under different ranges of temperature increase consistent with the RCPs and population
change scenarios and accounts for several types of uncertainties. Our results showed that with
no adaptation to warmer temperatures, the changes in heatwave-related excess mortality differ
substantially across countries/regions. Countries/regions near the equator are projected to
experience higher percentage increases in heatwave-related excess mortality under future cli-
mate scenarios than those in temperate climate zones. Under the hypothetical adaptation sce-
narios based on relative temperature, most of heatwave-related excess mortality would be
offset in the future, but it is expected to still increase in all countries/regions under high-vari-
ant population scenarios except Moldova and Japan, where populations will decrease in the
future. However, there is no clear evidence that such hypothetical adaptation would actually
happen and be effective and timely, resulting in adverse health outcomes from heatwaves over
this century.
The projections indicate strong geographical variability. Some tropical and subtropical
areas such as Brazil, Colombia, and Philippines are characterised by a relatively high projected
warming and increase in heatwave-related excess mortality. By contrast, all the European
countries and the US are projected to experience a small increase in heatwave-related excess
mortality. The results are comparable with studies performed in the US [29], Europe [30],
China [31], and Korea [32]. Notably, arid or equatorial regions that include a large proportion
of the current and projected global population will contribute greatly to the global impact of
climate change.

 Changes in heatwave-related excess mortality are also highly affected by the extent of warm-
ing under different RCPs. The strongest increase in heatwave-related excess mortality is pro-
jected under RCP8.5, which is characterised by unabated greenhouse gas emissions, leading to
a steep increase in temperature. Conversely, the effects of climate change, and particularly the
increase in heatwave-related excess mortality in all countries/regions, are significantly smaller
in scenarios assuming mitigation strategies and null or marginally negative under the stricter
RCP2.6. These findings highlight the importance of implementation of effective climate poli-
cies to minimize increases in ambient temperatures and prevent the associated negative
impacts on human health.
Individuals have adapted to and will likely continue to adapt to local climate change,
including increasing ambient temperature [16, 29] through six levels of adaptation interven-
tions (Table 1), but only within certain limits [33]. These adaptation interventions could result
in a lower rise in core temperature and a lower increase in heart rate at a given heat load [34].
Our findings show that, when we consider hypothetical adaptation related to heatwave thresh-
olds (based on relative temperature), heatwave-related excess mortality would level off for all
countries/regions, with a lowered expected heatwave-related excess mortality. This means
ignoring adaptation in projections would result in a substantial overestimate of future heat-
wave-related excess mortality. In addition, there will be small differences in heatwave-related
excess mortality between RCPs. However, this hypothetical adaptation may be quite difficult
to achieve in the short-term, because it depends on many factors (Table 1), including the abil-
ity of individuals, society, and populations to make modifications within a timeframe adequate
to keep pace with changing temperatures. Furthermore, the ability of populations to adapt will
differ dramatically by country and by subpopulations.
We have to highlight that we only considered a change of the heatwave threshold as a possi-
ble adaptation. We did not consider the change of heatwave-related relative risks (reflecting
increasing resilience and vulnerability) affected by behavioural change, improvement of physi-
cal activity, healthier housing, and environmental changes through six levels of adaptation
interventions, which also indirectly affect the process of physiological change (Table 1) [35].
Incorporating this into models requires projections on adaptation interventions including
prevalence of air conditioning, improvement in cooling technology over time, improvement
in healthcare systems against heat-related diseases, and improvement in heatwave warning sys-
tems [29]. In addition, we also didn’t consider the changes in heatwave intensity (mean tem-
perature during heatwaves) and summer average temperature [36]. With our historical data,
we found that higher heatwave intensity was associated with higher heatwave-related mortality
risk, while higher summer average temperature was related to lower heatwave-related mortal-
ity risk (Fig Y in S1 Appendix). As both heatwave intensity and average summer temperature
will increase in the future, the change in relative risks of mortality related to heatwaves would
be balanced by these two factors. Further research is needed to better understand the mecha-
nisms of adaptation interventions with the goal of reducing the detrimental health impacts of
future heatwaves.
To estimate future heatwave-related excess mortality, we relied on many assumptions. Mul-
tiple climate model simulations of future climate change were used to account for variation in
climate models’ structural assumptions, an important source of uncertainty in future projec-
tions [14]. Intermodel variability is significant even at global average scales, but it becomes
increasingly relevant as the output of global models is used to describe climate change at small
regional scales and for high-frequency quantities like daily output, as in the case of our analy-
sis. In addition, we used meta-regression with historical data to project historical community-
specific heatwave–mortality relative risks to project future heatwave-related excess mortality
in that community. Although this method cannot solve the problem that future relative risks

 might be different than those in the past, this can eliminate the potential between-city differ-
ences when applying historical data from a warmer city to predict the future mortality of
another warming city [37].
There is a problem in relation to projections of daily temperatures at local scales. The down-
scaling methods assume future variation/trend of daily temperature are the same as current.
This assumption may be appropriate for the near future, but the situation is uncertain for
more distant future climates. Although there are good estimates of future climates from
GCMs, it is clear that present and future predictability of temperature variability is not the
same everywhere [38]. It is difficult to evaluate the adequacy of different downscaling methods,
because there is limited information on how climate change affects local-level daily weather.
Importantly, there is a significant gap between the available information at seasonal time scales
and the information at longer time scales. Information about what is likely over the next
decades is largely unknown [39]. This highlights the importance of using different scenarios
and different models to assess possible future daily temperatures and their impacts.
Our findings are consistent with previous studies in single locations or countries for results
considering no adaptation [30–32] and adaptation [29]. Most findings were limited to a no
adaptation assumption and reported large increases in future heatwave-related excess mortal-
ity. A study projected that Chicago is expected to have 166–2,217 heatwave-related excess
deaths per year during 2081–2100, based on estimates from seven global climate models under
three different climate change scenarios, without any adaptation. The largest cause of variation
in the projections was the choice of climate model [14]. A recent study conducted in the US
estimated that, accounting for adaptation, the overall heat-related mortality by 2050 would not
change substantially compared to 2006 [29]. In particular, the variety of analytical designs,
with alternative effect summaries, statistical modelling, and assumptions, makes it difficult to
quantitatively compare results and to draw a comprehensive picture of the global impact of cli-
mate change directly attributable to changes in heatwaves. By contrast, our assessment applies
an advanced and well-tested statistical framework uniformly across various counties/regions
and climates, accounting for community-specific heatwave–mortality relationships, and pro-
vides a consistent overview of geographical and temporal differences.
Some limitations have to be acknowledged. Our projections of heatwave–related mortality
associations under five greenhouse gas emission scenarios only include simple assumptions
with respect to adaptation: no adaptation and hypothetical adaptation. Our assessment of
adaptation does not comprehensively address the complexities of this issue, including the tim-
ing of adaptive measures, effectiveness, existence of prerequisites for implementing adaptation
options, etc. This work considered the number of heatwaves and heatwave days, although pre-
vious research indicates that the intensity of heatwaves also impacts health response. Should
heatwaves be more intense in the future, even if the number of heatwave days stays the same,
an increase in adverse health outcomes would be anticipated. The method we used to define
heatwaves allows for regional acclimatization to temperatures normal for a community, but
this would possibly make every community have heatwaves. The findings should therefore be
interpreted as potential impacts under hypothetical scenarios and not as projections of future
excess mortality. This study does not provide evidence for large areas of the world owing to
insufficient data. Estimates are also affected by considerable uncertainty, due to variability in
the climate models, population change scenarios, and imprecision in the estimated heatwave–
mortality associations. The heatwave–mortality association is often larger and mainly related
to uncertainty in applying current associations to the future. This would result in an underesti-
mation of heatwave-related excess deaths. As there were limited data for verification of models
in some tropical countries, the projections for those places have larger uncertainties. While we
generated community-specific estimates of heatwaves and mortality, the health response may

 differ by subpopulation within a community. We did not consider the influence of climate–
urban heat island (UHI) interaction on heatwave–mortality associations. However, its influ-
ence is much smaller than adaptation, mitigation, and population change, and the data on cli-
mate–UHI interactions are not available. Future work could consider these population
differences, as well as how demographic shifts, urbanization patterns, and population migra-
tion/dynamics could affect heatwave–mortality risk from climate change (e.g., larger effects for
older populations in conjunction with an aging population).
In summary, the uncertainties of climate change and adaptation assumptions are not
assigned probabilities but rather can be deemed as possible futures, which depend on demo-
graphic, technological, political, social, and economic developments [40]. Informed by quanti-
tative or qualitative evidence, projections provide decision makers with information on a
range of possible future trends, contexts, risks, and opportunities. Our findings can provide
suggestions for real-world practices for climate change mitigation and adaptation. First, stric-
ter mitigation policy has to be applied to reduce greenhouse gas emission, because lower
greenhouse gas emissions are associated with fewer deaths due to heatwaves. Second, adapta-
tion interventions should be planned to reduce the health impacts of heatwaves in all the coun-
tries/regions, particularly for developing countries in tropical and subtropical regions. The
adaptation interventions include six levels (individual, interpersonal, community, institu-
tional, environmental, and public policy levels) with many methods, for example, communi-
cating the health risks of heatwaves to the public and policy makers, establishing early warning
systems and urban cooling centres, and developing smart house technology (cost effective to
keep cool in summer) (Table 1).
