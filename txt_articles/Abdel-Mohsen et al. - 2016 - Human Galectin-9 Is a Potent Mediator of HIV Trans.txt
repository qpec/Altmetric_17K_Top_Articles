Abstract
Identifying host immune determinants governing HIV transcription, latency and infectivity in
vivo is critical to developing an HIV cure. Based on our recent finding that the host factor
p21 regulates HIV transcription during antiretroviral therapy (ART), and published data
demonstrating that the human carbohydrate-binding immunomodulatory protein galectin-9
regulates p21, we hypothesized that galectin-9 modulates HIV transcription. We report that
the administration of a recombinant, stable form of galectin-9 (rGal-9) potently reverses HIV
latency in vitro in the J-Lat HIV latency model. Furthermore, rGal-9 reverses HIV latency ex
vivo in primary CD4+ T cells from HIV-infected, ART-suppressed individuals (p = 0.002),
more potently than vorinostat (p = 0.02). rGal-9 co-administration with the latency reversal
agent "JQ1", a bromodomain inhibitor, exhibits synergistic activity (p<0.05). rGal-9 signals
through N-linked oligosaccharides and O-linked hexasaccharides on the T cell surface,
modulating the gene expression levels of key transcription initiation, promoter proximal-
pausing, and chromatin remodeling factors that regulate HIV latency. Beyond latent viral
reactivation, rGal-9 induces robust expression of the host antiviral deaminase APOBEC3G
in vitro and ex vivo (FDR<0.006) and significantly reduces infectivity of progeny virus,
decreasing the probability that the HIV reservoir will be replenished when latency is
reversed therapeutically. Lastly, endogenous levels of soluble galectin-9 in the plasma of
72 HIV-infected ART-suppressed individuals were associated with levels of HIV RNA in
CD4+ T cells (p<0.02) and with the quantity and binding avidity of circulating anti-HIV anti-
bodies (p<0.009), suggesting a role of galectin-9 in regulating HIV transcription and viral
production in vivo during therapy. Our data suggest that galectin-9 and the host glycosyla-
tion machinery should be explored as foundations for novel HIV cure strategies.

 Author Summary
While antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly decreased the morbidity and mortal-
ity associated with HIV infection, a cure is not achieved due to the persistence of HIV
latently-infected cells during treatment. Identifying the principal host immune determi-
nants governing HIV transcription, latency, and infectivity in vivo will be a critical step in
developing an effective curative strategy for HIV infection. In this study, we demonstrate
that the human immunomodulatory carbohydrate-binding protein galectin-9 is a determi-
nant of HIV latency in HIV-infected individuals on suppressive ART. Administration of
galectin-9 potently reactivates latent HIV in CD4+ T cells ex vivo, by signaling through
specific glycans on the cell surface to modulate the gene expression levels of key host fac-
tors that regulate HIV transcription. Furthermore, galectin-9 induces the host APOBEC3
proteins which lethally mutagenize the HIV genome, attenuating viral infectivity. Our
findings reveal a novel biological function of human galectin-9, and demonstrate that host
glycans on the surface of infected cells mediate signals that define the transcriptional state
and infectivity of HIV. Our findings suggest that galectin-9 and the host glycosylation
machinery may be exploited to eradicate the latent HIV reservoir.
Introduction
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has demonstrated efficacy and durability in suppressing HIV
replication in infected individuals. However, ART does not achieve viral eradication due to the
persistence of latently infected long-lived cells [1,2]. Several recent studies demonstrating con-
tinued morbidity during suppressive ART have created profound interest in developing a cure
for HIV infection. The elimination of the latent reservoir is critical to achieving HIV eradica-
tion, as demonstrated by resurgence of virus post ART-cessation [3,4]. Alternatively, a “func-
tional cure” involving control of virus to undetectable levels in the absence of complete
eradication may be established to minimize ART-associated morbidity and enable ART-inde-
pendent suppression of HIV to clinically undetectable levels, as demonstrated in recent clinical
studies [5]. Identifying host determinants governing HIV transcription, latency, and infectivity
in vivo will be a critical step in developing both of these curative modalities for HIV infection.
The “shock and kill” strategy is currently one of the most widely discussed approaches to
eliminate the viral reservoir [6]. In this approach, drugs are administered to reverse HIV
latency and induce viral production, ultimately resulting in the death of infected cells by direct
viral cytopathic effects or immune-mediated clearance. Latency reversing agents (LRAs) are
administered during suppressive ART, thereby preventing reactivated virus from replenishing
the reservoir through infection of new cells. Clinical trials involving LRAs such as romidepsin,
vorinostat, disulfiram, and panobinostat have failed to demonstrate significant reduction in
reservoir size, although transient elevation in plasma viral RNA has been observed [7–13].
Accordingly, ex vivo experiments have revealed that the majority of existing LRAs exert weak
effects on HIV transcription and reactivation [14]. The future success of shock and kill will
depend on our capacity to design or identify highly efficacious LRAs and/or adjuvant therapies
to boost the reactivation potential of existing LRAs.
Based on our recent finding that the p21 (CDKN1A) host restriction factor and cell cycle
regulator [15,16] modulates HIV transcription in ART-suppressed HIV-infected individuals
[17], and reports suggesting that the human lectin galectin-9 (Gal-9) regulates p21 expression
[18–20], we pursued the hypothesis that Gal-9 modulates HIV transcription and latency. The
galectin family of animal lectins consists of a group of glycan-binding proteins characterized

 by conserved carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs), defined by shared consensus amino
acid sequences which confer specific binding to β-galactoside-containing glycoconjugate pro-
teins [21]. Galectins are ubiquitously expressed throughout the animal kingdom, from lower
organisms, such as nematodes and sponges, to higher mammalian species, including humans
[22]. Fifteen members of the mammalian galectin family have been identified to date [23]. Gal-
9 has been recently recognized to play an important role in several diseases including HIV
infection through regulation of both adaptive and innate defense mechanisms [24–26]. Recom-
binant Gal-9 (rGal-9) has been used successfully and safely as a therapy in a number of mouse
disease models including graft versus host disease [27], rheumatoid arthritis [28], asthma [29],
leukemia [30], and colon cancer [31].
Results
rGal-9 potently reverses HIV latency in vitro
We recently demonstrated that the expression levels of particular cell-intrinsic immune factors
are associated with levels of cell-associated HIV RNA in the setting of ART [17]. Based on
reports demonstrating that Gal-9 regulates the expression of these key cell-intrinsic immune
mechanisms [18–20], we hypothesized that manipulation of Gal-9 may induce transcription of
latent HIV. We initially assessed the ability of a biologically active and stable form of rGal-9
[32,33] to modulate HIV transcription and reactivate latent HIV in the established “J-Lat”
model of HIV latency. J-Lat cells harbor a latent, transcriptionally competent HIV provirus
that encodes green fluorescent protein (GFP) as an indicator of reactivation [34,35]. We per-
formed dose-response experiments by stimulating J-Lat 5A8, 6.3 and 11.1 clones [36] with
rGal-9 for 24 hours. Our data revealed that rGal-9 reactivated latently-infected J-Lat cells in a
dose-dependent manner (up to 17.9% in the 5A8 clone, up to 6.96% in the 6.3 clone, and up to
40.1% in the 11.1 clone), and with potency greater than that seen with αCD3/αCD28 stimula-
tion (Fig 1A–1C). When we assessed the ability of other galectins (galectins-1, 3, 4, 7, 8) to
reverse HIV latency, none of the other galectins (including those structurally similar to galec-
tin-9, such as the other tandem-repeat type galectins, galectin-4 and galectin-8) exhibited any
capacity to reactivate latent HIV infection at the same concentrations used for rGal-9, suggest-
ing that HIV latency reversal is a unique feature of Gal-9 amongst members of the galectin
family (Fig 1A–1C). Limiting duration of exposure of the J-Lat 5A8 cell to 1000 nM of rGal-9
for 6 hours achieved ~67% of the activity observed after continuous 24 hours of treatment,
while pulse treatment for only one hour achieved equivalent reactivation to αCD3/αCD28
stimulation (S1 Fig). In addition, we examined the effects of rGal-9 treatment on the expression
of the HIV p24 and Vif proteins in J-Lat 5A8 cell lysates. Our data demonstrate that rGal-9
induces the expression of HIV viral proteins (S2 Fig).
rGal-9 potently reverses HIV latency ex vivo
We assessed the ability of rGal-9 to reactivate latent HIV in isolated CD4+ T cells derived from
13 HIV-infected individuals on suppressive ART. CD4+ T cells were treated with either DMSO
0.5% as negative control, rGal-9 at two different concentrations (500 nM and 1000 nM), PMA/
ionomycin (2 nM, 500 nM), or vorinostat (1μM) for 24 hours. 500nM and 1000 nM of rGal-9
induced a mean 6.4-fold and 7.3-fold increase in intracellular HIV RNA levels after 24 hours,
respectively, as compared to DMSO negative control (p = 0.002). Induction was significantly
higher than vorinostat (p = 0.02, 3.2 fold) (Fig 2A). Depleting CD4+ T cells expressing CD69,
CD25, HLA-DR surface activation markers did not significantly affect rGal-9-mediated latent
HIV reactivation ex vivo in CD4+ T cells, determined in a representative subset of three HIV-
infected ART-suppressed individuals (Fig 2B and 2C). We additionally investigated the effects

 of limited exposure ex vivo in the same subset of three HIV-infected ART-suppressed individu-
als. Our data demonstrate that six hours of exposure to 1000 nm of rGal-9 induces an average of
59.2% of the viral reactivation observed after 24 hours of continuous exposure ex vivo (S3 Fig).
We next explored synergy between rGal-9 and established latency reversal agents. In five
HIV-infected ART-suppressed individuals, CD4+ T cells were treated with 500 nM of rGal-9,
1 μM vorinostat [7,10,11,14], 40 nM romidepsin [14,37], 10 nM bryostatin [14,38,39], 300 nM
prostratin [14,40–42], 1 μM JQ1 [14,43–45], or 30 nM panobinostat [14,46,47] alone or in
combination with 500 nM of rGal-9, in addition to αCD3 + αCD28-conjugated beads (Dynal,
at 1:1 bead:cell ratio) as positive control. Fold induction of cell-associated HIV RNA was deter-
mined using quantitative real-time PCR 24 hours after treatment. Based on the Bliss indepen-
dence model for the quantitative analysis of synergy [14,43,48], we determined that rGal-9 co-
administration with the latency reversal agent "JQ1", a bromodomain inhibitor, exhibits syner-
gistic activity (p<0.05) (Fig 2D and 2E). In addition, we evaluated the effects of rGal-9 on the
viability of freshly obtained primary CD4+ T cells from multiple HIV-infected ART-sup-
pressed individuals. Our experiment demonstrated that rGal-9 at high dosages (500 nM and
1000 nM) results in 15–20% reduction in cell viability, which is comparable to or better than
existing LRAs such as romidepsin [37] (S4 Fig).
rGal-9 reverses HIV latency in a glycan-dependent manner
Published data have identified three T cell surface glycoproteins, T cell immunoglobulin and
mucin protein-3 (Tim-3) [49], protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) [50], and CD44 [51], as recep-
tors for Gal-9. Addition of anti-Tim-3 antibody, anti-PDI antibody, or anti-CD44 antibody
prior to the addition of rGal-9 did not reduce rGal-9-mediated reactivation of latent HIV in
5A8 cells. α-lactose (30 mM), an established neutralizer of Gal-9 activity [24], completely
inhibited rGal-9-mediated reactivation of latent HIV (Fig 3A), while other saccharide deriva-
tives (glucose and galactose at 30 mM) did not affect rGal-9 capacity for latency reversal (S5
Fig). Based on the known carbohydrate-binding nature of lectins, we investigated the require-
ment for complex N- and O-glycans in rGal-9-mediated HIV latency reversal. J-Lat 5A8 cells
were treated for 24 hours with either tunicamycin or an enzymatic deglycosylation mix prior to
rGal-9 stimulation. Tunicamycin is an antibiotic that chemically blocks N-glycosylation of
newly synthesized proteins at asparagine residues, and the deglycosylation mix enzymatically
removes all N-linked and O-linked carbohydrates from glycoproteins. rGal-9-mediated HIV
latency reactivation (%GFP+) was reduced from 14.1±0.6% to 0.3±0.03% (mean±SD) when
glycan synthesis was chemically inhibited by tunicamycin, or to 8.0±1.0% with enzymatic
removal of cell surface glycans after 24 hours (Fig 3B and 3C). Conversely, the effects of PMA/
ionomycin on HIV latency reversal were enhanced by deglycosylation, while the activity of
TNFα was unaffected (S6 Fig).
The enzymatic deglycosylation mix contains several enzymes (PNGase F, O-Glycosidase, α-
(2!3,6,8,9)-Neuraminidase, β(1!4)-Galactosidase, and β-N-Acetylglucosaminidase). We
tested the ability of each enzyme individually or in combination to reduce the capacity of rGal-
9 to reverse HIV latency. A combination of PNGase F, β(1!4)-Galactosidase, and β-N-Acetyl-
glucosaminidase demonstrated the most potent reduction of rGal-9 mediated HIV reactivation
as compared to non-deglycosylated cells (14.7±1.2% to 7.9±0.1%) (Fig 3D). Thus, N-linked oli-
gosaccharides and the less common, but widely distributed O-linked hexasaccharide structures
(β(1!4)-linked galactose and β(1!6)-linked N-acetylglucosamine) are essential ligands in
rGal-9-mediated latency reversal. These data suggest that the ability of rGal-9 to reverse HIV
latency depends on binding to a preferred set of glycan structures on the T cell surface mem-
brane to transduce intracellular signals driving HIV transcription.

 rGal-9 modulates the gene expression of key transcription initiation,
chromatin remodeling and promoter-proximal pausing factors that
regulate HIV transcription
We implemented RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify a host gene expression signature
associated with rGal-9-mediated HIV latency reversal. We examined sorted GFP-positive and
GFP-negative cells containing reactivated (transcriptionally active) HIV proviruses and latent
(transcriptionally inactive) proviruses, respectively, after stimulation with rGal-9, αCD3/

 αCD28, or a combination of both agents. Cells with transcriptionally active proviruses (GFP+)
as a result of rGal-9 stimulation exhibited a distinct gene expression pattern, compared to cells
with transcriptionally active proviruses as a result of αCD3/αCD28 stimulation (Fig 4A, S7
Fig). We determined that rGal-9 significantly modulates the expression of genes involved in
several established signaling pathways that are known to play important roles in maintaining
HIV latency (FDR<0.05) (Fig 4B). rGal-9 induces the gene expression of several HIV proviral
transcription initiation factors including the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of acti-
vated B cells (NFkB), AP-1 nuclear complex, and the calcium-dependent activator of HIV tran-
scription initiation (NFAT). In addition, rGal-9 inhibits the gene expression of several
chromatin modification and remodeling factors, including histone deacetylase 1, 2, and 3,
EZH2, SUV39H1, DNMT1, BAF complex, and BCL11B. Lastly, rGal-9 inhibits the gene
expression of the promoter-proximal pausing factors belonging to the NELF family.
rGal-9 partially activates primary CD4+ T cells and induces naïve CD4+
T cell proliferation
In addition to evaluating the effects of rGal-9 on latent HIV reactivation, we sought to deter-
mine the effects of rGal-9 on primary CD4+ T cell phenotype, focusing on CD4+ T cell activa-
tion, proliferation and apoptosis. 500 nM and 1000 nM of rGal-9 induced surface expression of
the CD69 activation marker (73.9%, 81.8%, respectively), and marginally induced CD25 (4.6%,
6.4%, respectively) (Fig 5A and 5B) on the surface of isolated CD4+ T cells from six HIV-
infected ART-suppressed individuals. 200 nM and 500 nM of rGal-9 resulted in proliferation
of primary CD4+ T cells isolated from three HIV-infected ART-suppressed individuals after
five days of culture (10.3%, 12.6%, respectively) (Fig 5C), as measured by CFSE staining. rGal-9
selectively induced proliferation of naïve CD4+ T cells (CD4+ CD45RA+) (12.6%, 13.7%,
respectively) rather than memory CD4+ T cells (CD4+ CD45RA-) (3.1%, 4.9%, respectively)
(Fig 5E and 5F). In accordance with our ex vivo phenotypic data, we observed that rGal-9 mod-
ulates the expression of a subset of genes associated with regulation of T cell activation and pro-
liferation in vitro (S8A–S8C Fig), and up-regulates multiple genes responsible for T cell
apoptosis (S8E Fig).
rGal-9 induces the expression of several anti-HIV host restriction factors
including APOBEC3G
Achieving reservoir clearance or sustained virologic control of HIV following LRA administra-
tion will likely require involvement of innate and intrinsic immunity [8]. We therefore sought
to determine the effects of rGal-9 on the expression of genes involved in innate immunity, cell-
intrinsic immunity, and cytokine production (S9 Fig). We implemented a qPCR array to mea-
sure the expression of 42 established anti-HIV host restriction factors in vitro (in J-Lat 5A8
cells) and ex vivo (in primary CD4+ T cells isolated from ten ART-suppressed HIV-infected
individuals). rGal-9 significantly modulates the expression of several established anti-HIV cell-
intrinsic immune defenses. Of particular relevance, we determined that the APOBEC3 cytidine
deaminases, including APOBEC3G, were potently induced by rGal-9 in vitro (up to 55 fold)
(S10 Fig). This induction was confirmed by targeted digital RT-dPCR at the mRNA level (Fig
6A–6C) and by western blotting at the protein level (Fig 6D and 6E). In addition, we deter-
mined that APOBEC3G expression was induced by rGal-9 ex vivo (p = 0.016) in CD4+ T cells
from HIV-infected ART-suppressed individuals at the mRNA level (up to 14 fold) using qPCR
(Fig 7A and 7B, S11 Fig) and at the protein level using western blotting (Fig 7C and 7D). In
contrast to the induction observed in response to rGal-9 treatment, APOBEC3G expression
was significantly reduced by vorinostat treatment ex vivo (p = 0.016) (Fig 7A and 7B).

 rGal-9 significantly reduces infectivity of progeny virus
APOBEC3G is an innate antiviral factor that is incorporated into virions and drives extensive
G-to-A mutation, or “hypermutation”, of the HIV genome, typically rendering it non-viable
within a single replicative cycle [52,53]. We therefore hypothesized that latent virus that is reac-
tivated by rGal-9 (in the setting of elevated APOBEC3G expression) will likely be hypermu-
tated and rendered replication incompetent upon infection of a new cell. To test the hypothesis
that virus produced in the presence of rGal-9 is associated with reduced infectivity, we spinocu-
lated MOLT4-CCR5 cells with replication-competent HIV for two hours. After six hours of
incubation, cells were washed and were treated with PBS, 200 nM of rGal-9, or 5000U/ml of
interferon-α for 24 hours, followed by incubation for three days (Fig 8A). Culture supernatants
were concentrated and aliquots of the concentrated culture supernatants were used to measure
HIV production by quantifying viral p24 antigen concentration (Fig 8B), and equal amounts of
the remaining culture supernatants were used to infect Jurkat cells (by spinoculation) for 12
days. Alu-qPCR was used to quantify the levels of integrated HIV in the Jurkat target cells
every 3 days (Fig 8A). rGal-9 treatment of producer cells resulted in a 7.1-fold reduction in the
level of integrated HIV DNA in target cells (normalized to producer cell p24 supernatant lev-
els) after 3 days of culture. This reduction remained stable up to 12 days (6.9 fold at day 6, 6.3
fold at day 9, and 12.1 fold at day 12) (Fig 8C and 8D). These data suggest that a significant
fraction of the viral particles produced by MOLT4-CCR5 cells treated with rGal-9 were defec-
tive in a manner that prevented successful integration into the host genome.
Soluble galectin-9 (sGal-9) levels in plasma of HIV-infected ART-
suppressed individuals are associated with HIV transcription in vivo
Based on our data that rGal-9 potently induces HIV transcription in vitro and ex vivo, we
hypothesized that endogenous sGal-9 regulates HIV transcription in vivo, in HIV-infected,
ART-suppressed individuals. We examined relationships between plasma levels of sGal-9 in 72
HIV-infected individuals on suppressive ART and levels of CD4+ T cell-associated HIV RNA
(marker of HIV transcription), and the quantity and binding avidity of HIV-specific antibod-
ies, which have been associated with HIV production in multiple studies [4,54,55]. Levels of
sGal-9 were positively correlated with levels of CD4+ T cell-associated HIV RNA (p = 0.02,
Spearman r = 0.27), as well as with the quantity and binding avidity of anti-HIV antibodies
(p = 0.0005, Spearman r = 0.39) (Fig 9A and 9B). These data suggest that endogenous Gal-9
likely plays an important role in regulating HIV transcription and viral production during sup-
pressive therapy.
Discussion
In this study, we have revealed a novel biological function of lectins and cell surface carbohy-
drates in the biology of viral latency. Our findings strongly suggest that manipulation of Gal-9
(via modulation of endogenous production or exogenous administration of recombinant pro-
tein) should be explored as a foundation for novel HIV curative strategies. A large body of liter-
ature demonstrates that recombinant Gal-9 is well-tolerated and exhibits therapeutic potential
for a range of disorders in animal models [27–31], reinforcing its potential as a therapeutic tool
for HIV infection. Furthermore, the observed synergy with the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1
suggests that Gal-9 may serve as a useful component of multi-drug HIV eradication cocktails.

 Galectins recognize galactose-containing saccharide sequences displayed on cell surface gly-
coconjugates [21]. Activated CD4+ T cells and HIV latently-infected cells exhibit an altered
cell surface glycosylation pattern with respect to resting, uninfected cells [56]. This aberrant
pattern includes loss of sialic acid and an increase of core 2 O-Glycans [56]. In addition, the
association between hyposialylation and HIV infection has been established in vivo [57,58]. It
has been further demonstrated that the loss of sialic acid promotes oligosaccharide binding to
Gal-9 and promotes Gal-9 activity [59]. Collectively, these data suggest that the effects of Gal-9
may be more pronounced in HIV latently-infected cells than in uninfected cells. This specificity
may allow for potent viral reactivation and reservoir clearance in vivo with minimal undesir-
able perturbation of uninfected cells. Additional studies are needed to decipher the nature of
glycan-mediated recognition responsible for Gal-9-mediated signal transduction.
The APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases, including APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F, were strongly
induced by rGal-9 in CD4+ T cells. Based on the established mechanism of action associated
with the APOBEC3 factors, the pronounced APOBEC3 induction by rGal-9 would be expected
to override the antagonistic activity of the HIV Vif protein [60,61] and result in hypermutation
of progeny virus upon infection of a new cell, rendering the virus replication incompetent. This
phenomenon is supported by our observation that rGal-9 treatment reduces viral infectivity by
over seven-fold. This detail is highly relevant to the shock-and-kill HIV cure framework, as it is
becoming increasingly clear that ART does not completely block viral replication, especially in
tissues with suboptimal drug penetration [62]. APOBEC3 induction in the producer cell will
reduce the probability that the HIV reservoir is replenished when latency is reversed therapeu-
tically. This pattern is in stark contrast to our observation that vorinostat significantly sup-
presses expression of APOBEC3G in CD4+ T cells. This unintended effect of vorinostat may
contribute to the published observation that vorinostat enhances cellular susceptibility to HIV
infection [63].
The involvement of host immunity will be critical in achieving clearance of the latent HIV
reservoir. On this front, rGal-9 was previously found to have immunopotentiating effects [64].
rGal-9 enhanced cytotoxic T cell activity against tumor cells, enhanced IFN-γ and IL-4 produc-
tion, and promoted dendritic cell maturation via Gal-9-Tim-3 interactions. Our CFSE staining
data demonstrate that rGal-9 induces T cell proliferation, compatible with immunopotentiat-
ing activity. Although induction of proliferation by an LRA may inadvertently expand the
latent reservoir, it is important to note that proliferation driven by rGal-9 was observed primar-
ily in the naïve CD4+ T cell compartment rather than in memory CD4+ T cells. Multiple recent
studies have shown that naïve CD4+ T cells rarely harbor latent HIV[65]. Therefore, the induc-
tion of CD4+ T cell proliferation by rGal-9 is unlikely to significantly contribute to the expan-
sion of the latent pool. Other studies have demonstrated immunosuppressive effects of rGal-9
in the setting of autoimmune arthritis and organ transplantation rejection models [66,67].
Taken together, it is likely that rGal-9 exhibits immunopotentiating activity in the setting of
immunosuppression, and immunosuppressive activity in the setting of hyperimmunity. The
effect of rGal-9 on cell-mediated immunity against HIV warrants proper investigation in ani-
mal models and clinical studies. Although in vitro methods are available to investigate the
effects of rGal-9 on innate and adaptive immune responses, recent reports demonstrate that
the effects of LRAs on anti-HIV immunity in vitro do not accurately reflect the immunologic
consequences of administration in vivo [13,68].

 In summary, our study provides the first evidence that Gal-9 should be considered as a
foundation for novel lectin-based strategies to eliminate the latent HIV reservoir. Detailed
exploration of biochemical pathways associated with Gal-9 and implementation of animal
models will be critical in translating our findings into novel therapeutic or curative approaches
for HIV infection.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study utilized retrospectively and prospectively collected specimens from HIV-infected
individuals enrolled in the UCSF SCOPE and Hawaii HIV cohorts. Research protocols were
approved by the relevant University of California, San Francisco and University of Hawaii
Committees on Human Research. All participants were enrolled after obtaining written
informed consent, and all subject data and specimens were coded to protect confidentiality.
Subjects and specimen processing
One milliliter (ml) of plasma was collected retrospectively from 72 ART-suppressed HIV-
infected individuals enrolled in the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) SCOPE and
Options cohorts who have been on ART for 1–2 years at time of sampling. We previously mea-
sured levels of cell-associated HIV RNA in CD4+ T cells from the same 72 individuals [17,69].
We prospectively recruited 10 participants from the SCOPE cohort. Participants met strict
selection criteria and had well-documented persistent viral suppression for over 3 years. This
study was approved by the UCSF Committee on Human Research. Fresh blood (100 ml) was
collected and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood
using SepMate (STEMCELL Technologies). CD4+ T cells were isolated from PBMCs using
negative selection (EasySep, STEMCELL Technologies). In addition, one billion cryopreserved
PBMCs were collected from five ART-suppressed HIV-infected individuals enrolled in the
Hawaii HIV-1 cohort (HHC). Subject characteristics for all 15 participants involved in our pro-
spective sample collection are documented in detail in S1 Table. The characteristics of the 72
ART-suppressed HIV-infected individuals samples used to measure soluble levels of Gal-9 are
described in detail in our previous publications [17,69]. CD4+ T cells were enriched from the
cryopreserved PBMCs by negative selection using the EasySep Human CD4+ T Cell Enrich-
ment Kit (Stemcell Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Recombinant and natural galectins
Stable forms of recombinant galectins 1 and 9 were obtained through our collaborators at Gal-
Pharma Co., Ltd. (Kagawa, Japan). Galectin-1 and galectin-9 are very unstable in nature, hence
stable forms with retaining biological activities were used. For the other galectins (-3, -4, -7,
and, -8), the natural, stable form was used [70,71].
Measurement of HIV latency reversal in vitro
We performed experiments in the established “J-Lat” model of HIV latency (kindly provided
by Drs. Warner Greene and Eric Verdin, Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology).
J-Lat cells harbor latent, transcriptionally competent HIV provirus that encodes green
varying concentrations of rGal-9 (100 nM, 200n M, and 500 nM) or interferon-α (5000 units/ml), as determined by western blot.
Immunoblotting bands were quantified with ImageJ software. The quantified APOBEC3G protein expression levels were normalized to
corresponding Tubulin protein levels to account for variation in loading.

 fluorescent protein (GFP) as an indicator of viral reactivation [34,35]. We performed dose-
response experiments by stimulating J-Lat 5A8, 6.3, and 11.1 clones with varying concentra-
tions of rGal-9 for 24 hours. We used beads coated with anti-human αCD3 (10 μg/ml, eBios-
ciences, clone:OKT3) and αCD28 (5 μg/ml, eBiosciences, clone: CD28.2) to stimulate T cells in
a manner that partially mimics stimulation by antigen-presenting cells as positive control. We
used PMA/ionomycin (16 nM/500 nM), and TNFα (10 ng/ml) as positive controls. J-Lat cells
were also stimulated with varying concentrations of galectins-1, 3, 4, 7, 8 to evaluate the ability
of other recombinant galectins to reverse HIV latency. Flow cytometric analysis in a LSR II
flow cytometer using the FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) was
used to assess mean fluorescence intensity of HIV-encoded GFP expression after stimulation.
Data were analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar Inc., Ashland, OR).
Measurement of HIV latency reversal ex vivo
Isolated CD4+ T cells were plated at a density of 1x106 cells per well at a volume of 1 mL Ros-
well Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI) containing 20% FBS (R20) in a 6-well flat-bot-
tom plate. The cells were either untreated or treated with DMSO 0.5% as negative control,
PMA (Sigma) at 2 nM and Ionomycin (Sigma) at 0.5 μM, vorinostat at 1 μM, and varying con-
centrations of rGal-9 (500nM, and 1000 nM) for 24 hours. All stimuli solutions were prepared
in R20 culture medium or DMSO solvent from stock solutions. The exposure time of cells to
compounds was 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA
Universal Kit (Qiagen) with the optional on-column DNase treatment step. Cellular total HIV-
1 RNA was quantified with a qPCR TaqMan assay using LTR-specific primers F522-43 (5’
GCC TCA ATA AAG CTT GCC TTG A 3’; HXB2 522–543) and R626-43 (5’ GGG CGC CAC
TGC TAG AGA 3’; 626–643) coupled with a FAM-BQ probe (5’ CCA GAG TCA CAC AAC
AGA CGG GCA CA 3) on a ViiA7 Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Inc. Foster
City, CA, USA). Cellular total HIV-1 RNA copy number was determined in a reaction volume
of 20 μl with 10 μl of 2x TaqMan RNA-to-Ct 1 Step kit (Life Technologies), 4 pmol of each
primer, 4 pmol of probe, 0.5 μl reverse transcriptase, and 5 μl of RNA. Cycling conditions were
48°C for 20 min, 95°C for 10 min, then 60 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 59°C for 1 min. Exter-
nal quantitation standards were prepared from full length NL4-3 virion RNA. Specimens were
assayed with up to 500 ng cellular total RNA in replicate reaction wells and copy number was
determined by extrapolation against a 7-point standard curve (1–10,000 copies) performed in
triplicate. Nucleic acid input was normalized for cell number using 18S housekeeping gene
copy number by qPCR. For cellular 18S RNA qPCR, the reaction volume was 20 μl with 10 μl
of 2x TaqMan RNA to Ct 1 Step kit, 1 μl of human 18S Endogenous Control (Life technolo-
gies), 0.5 μl reverse transcriptase, and 5 μl of RNA. Cycling conditions were 48°C for 20 min,
95°C for 10 min, then 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min. 18S external standard
curves (8 points curve, from 1–100,000 copies) were prepared from RNA extracted from HIV-
1-uninfected CD4+ T cells.

 Depletion of CD4+ T cells harboring CD69, CD25, and HLA-DR
activation markers
CD4+ T cells were isolated from PBMCs of three HIV-infected ART-suppressed individuals
using negative selection (EasySep, STEMCELL Technologies). Resting CD4+ T cells were fur-
ther enriched through depletion of cells expressing CD69, CD25, or HLA-DR surface markers
from half of the isolated CD4+ T cells (CD69 MicroBead Kit II, Miltenyi Biotec; CD25
MicroBeads, Miltenyi Biotec; Anti-HLA-DR MicroBeads, Miltenyi Biotec). The remaining half
was processed through the exact enrichment produce, except PBS was added instead of the
depleting antibodies. Both of these cell populations were treated with 0.5% DMSO (negative
control), 500 nM rGal-9, 1000 nM rGal-9 or αCD3/αCD28-conjugated beads. Induction of
cell-associated HIV RNA was measured 24 hours post treatment using RT-qPCR.
Quantitative analysis of synergy of latency reversing agent combinations
CD4+ T cells isolated from five HIV-infected ART-suppressed individuals were treated with
500 nM of rGal-9, 1 μM vorinostat, 40 nM romidepsin, 10 nM bryostatin, 300 nM prostratin,
1 μM JQ1, or 30 nM panobinostat alone or in combination with 500 nM of rGal-9, in addition
to αCD3 + αCD28-conjugated beads (Dynal, at 1:1 bead:cell ratio) as a positive control. Fold
induction of cell-associated HIV RNA was determined using quantitative real-time PCR 24
hours after treatment. qPCR data were normalized using three independent methods; cell
count post-treatment and immediately prior to total RNA extraction, 18S housekeeping gene
quantification by qPCR, and RNA mass quantity measured by NanoDrop Spectrophotometer
ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies). We adapted the Bliss independence model [48] as imple-
mented by Jiang et al and Laird et al [14,43] to test for synergy when rGal-9 500nM was com-
bined with several latency reversing agents ex vivo. For drugs x and y, we used the equation

 faxyP = fax +fay−(fax)(fay), where faxyP represents the predicted fraction affected by the combi-
nation of drug x and drug y given the observed effects of drug x (fax) and drug y (fay) adminis-
tered individually and faxy,O = the observed effect when x and y were tested together.
Calculation of fax utilized the following approach adapted from the above cited publications:
HIV RNA: fax = (HIV RNA copies with drug x–background copies with DMSO)/ (HIV RNA
copies with αCD3-αCD28 stimulation—background copies with DMSO). In cases where one
or more experimental drug conditions resulted in RNA expression exceeding the αCD3-
αCD28 stimulation, we imputed the highest HIV RNA value in that experiment +1 to represent
the denominator for calculation of fax. Δfaxy = faxyO (the observed fraction affected by the drug
combination)—faxyP (the predicted fraction affected by the drug combination) provides an
indication of synergy (Δ faxy > 0), additive effect (Bliss independence) (Δ faxy = 0), or antago-
nism (Δ faxy< 0). Statistical significance was determined using two-tailed paired t-tests.
Blocking of Tim-3, PDI, or CD44 receptors
J-Lat 5A8 cells were either untreated were treated with one of the following: 30 mM of α-Lac-
tose monohydrate (Sigma), 5 μg/ml rat anti-human TIM-3 monoclonal antibody (R&D sys-
tems, Clone # 344801), 5 μg/ml mouse anti-human PDI monoclonal antibody (Millipore,
Clone # 1D3), or 5 μg/ml rat anti-human CD44 monoclonal antibody (Thermo-scientific,
Clone # Hermes-1). After 30 minutes of incubation, cells were treated with 200nM of rGal-9.
αCD3 (10 μg/ml) and αCD28 (5 μg/ml) stimulation was used as a positive control. Glucose
and galactose (30 mM) (Sigma) were used to examine the effects of other saccharide derivatives
on rGal-9-mediated HIV latency reversal. Mean fluorescence intensity of HIV-encoded GFP
expression in the 5A8 cells was assessed using flow cytometry after 24 hours.
Cell deglycosylation assay
J-Lat 5A8 cells were either left untreated, or treated with 1 μg/mL tunicamycin (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO), enzymatic protein deglycosylation mix (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), or individual
deglycosylation enzymes for 24 hours. Cells were washed with RPMI media with 20% FBS,
then were either left unstimulated or stimulated with rGal-9 (200 nM), PMA/inonmycin (16
nM, 500 nM), or TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 12 hrs, 24 hrs, or 48 hrs. Mean fluorescence intensity of
HIV-encoded GFP expression in the 5A8 cells was assessed using flow cytometry after 24
hours.
RNA-sequencing of CD4+ T cell transcriptome
J-Lat 5A8 cells were either untreated, or treated with 200 nM of rGal-9, αCD3 (10 μg/ml) and
αCD28 (5 μg/ml), or a combination of 200 nM rGal-9 + αCD3 and αCD28 for 24 hours. Cells
were sorted based on their GFP expression using the BD FACSAria III. Total RNA was
extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen) with the optional on-
column DNase treatment step. RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer
ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies) and integrity was assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agi-
lent Technologies). cDNAs were generated using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample
Preparation kit (Illumina Technologies) using 400 ng of total RNA as input. Paired-end
sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument to obtain 30–50 million
2×51 bp reads. RNA-Seq data were preprocessed by adaptor trimming and low quality 3'-tail
trimming (Phred > 20). The preprocessed reads were mapped using Tophat[72] to the refer-
ence genome hg19. Gene level expression quantification in FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of
transcript per Million mapped reads) was calculated using Cufflinks suite including Cufflinks,
Cuffmerge, Cuffquant and Cuffnorm[72]. Significant changes in transcript expression were

for false discovery rate (FDR <0.05). The gene annotations and gene ontology terms were
extracted from BioMart using the Bioconductor/biomaRt package [72].
CD4+ T cell activation assay
The surface expression of CD69 and CD25 markers of T-cell activation were measured using
flow cytometry. Isolated CD4+ T cells were either treated with DMSO 0.5% as negative control,
PMA (2 nM) and Ionomycin (0.5 mM), vorinostat (1μg/ml), or two concentrations of rGal-9
(500nM, and 1μM) for 24 hours. Cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell
Stain Kit (Invitrogen) and then stained with the following fluorescently-conjugated monoclo-
nal antibodies: V450 mouse anti-human CD69 (BD Biosciences, clone: FN50) and APC-cy7
mouse anti-human CD25 (BD Biosciences, clone: M-A251). Rainbow beads (Spherotec) were
used to standardize instrument settings between runs. Data were analyzed using FlowJo
(TreeStar Inc., Ashland, OR).
Proliferation assays
CD4+ T cells were negatively selected from thawed cryopreserved PBMCs. Isolated CD4+ T
cells were stained with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) at a final con-
centration of 10 μM for 15 min. 1 X 106 CFSE-stained CD4+ T cells were either left unstimu-
lated, or stimulated for 24 hours with rGal-9 (200nM, and 500nM). After 24 hours, cells were
washed and cultured for another 4 days. Cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua
Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen) and then stained with the following fluorescently-conjugated
monoclonal antibodies: Brilliant violet 421 anti-human CD4 (BioLegend, clone: OKT4) and
FE/cy7 antihuman CD45RA (BioLegend, clone: HI100). Rainbow beads (Spherotec) were used
to standardize instrument settings between runs. Data were acquired on the flow cytometer as
above and were analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar Inc., Ashland, OR).
Quantitative PCR gene expression profiling
400ng of RNA were transcribed into cDNA using random primers and the SuperScript VILO
cDNA Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative real-
time PCR utilized custom-made TaqMan Low Density Arrays (TLDA) from Applied Biosys-
tems following the manufacturer’s instructions. Thermal cycling was performed using an
Applied Biosystems ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System. Up to 450 ng cDNA in 200 μl of Applied
Biosystems TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix with UNG was loaded onto the designated
ports of the TLDA plates. Data was analyzed using the Applied Biosystems ViiA 7 software. A
panel of 6 housekeeping genes was included in the TLDA plates (GAPDH, 18S, ACTB, PPIA,
RPLP0, and UBC). 18S ribosomal RNA was identified as the most stably expressed gene from
this panel among all samples using the GeNorm algorithm[73]. Therefore, raw cycle threshold
numbers of amplified gene products were normalized to 18S ribosomal RNA to control for
cDNA input amounts. Fold induction was determined using the comparative Ct method [73].
Droplet digital PCR gene expression profiling
Starting with 10 ng of input RNA, absolute quantification of HIV gag, p21 (Life technologies),
and APOBEC3G (Life technologies) mRNA was performed, in addition to RNAse P (Ribonu-
clease P) as a housekeeping gene, in four-plex digital droplet PCR reactions using the RainDrop
system (RainDance Technologies). The RainDrop Source instrument was used with a micro-
fluidic chip (RainDrop Source chip) containing 8 sample wells to generate a collection of

 uniformly sized (5 picoliter) aqueous droplets from each sample mixed with assay reagents in a
reaction volume of 25 μl with 12.5 μl of SuperScript III, 1 μL of SuperScript III Taq Polymerase
(Life Technologies), 2.5 μL 10x Droplet Stabilizer (RainDance Technologies), 2.5 μl of each
primer/probe mixes, and 5 μl of RNA. Droplets were thermocycled at 50°C for 25 min, 95°C
for 10 min, then underwent 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min. The thermal-
cycled 8-tube strip was placed into the deck of the RainDrop Sense instrument with a second
microfluidic chip (RainDrop Sense chip) used for single droplet fluorescence measurements.
Data were analyzed using the RainDrop Analyst software. Data from each sample or control
was converted to a 2-dimensional histogram displaying FAM intensity on the x-axis and VIC
intensity on the y-axis. Spectral compensation factors were calculated from the positive control
data and applied to all samples. Gates used to count the number of droplet events with specific
fluorescence properties were defined using graphical tools to outline regions from the positive
control, and these gates were applied to all samples. For each sample, the number of PCR-posi-
tive droplet events was counted within each gate. Droplet counts were normalized to RNAseP
counts.
Western blotting
Cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40
(vol/vol), 0.5% AB-deoxycholate (vol/vol), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (vol/vol), 50
mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm DTT), and EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor (Calbiochem). Cellular
lysates were used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) immunoblotting
analysis. The primary antibodies used were anti-APOBEC3G mAb (NIH AIDS Reagent Pro-
gram, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: Anti-APOBEC3G from Dr. Warner C. Greene [74]),
anti-p24 mAb (NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: Anti-HIV-1 p24
Monoclonal (71–31) from Dr. Susan Zolla-Pazner [75]), anti-Vif mAb (NIH AIDS Reagent
Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: HIV-1 Vif Monoclonal Antibody (#319)) from Dr.
Michael H. Malim [76–78]), and anti-Tubulin (B-Tubulin 926–42211 from LI-COR). The
immunoblotting bands were quantified using ImageJ software.
Infectivity assay and virion quantification by p24 ELISA
Five million MOLT4-CCR5 cells (1x106 cells per ml of R10 media) were spinoculated with
NLENG1 replication competent virus (MOI = 10) for 2 hours, cells were incubated for 6 hours
at 37°C, then washed twice and were treated with PBS, 200 nM rGal-9, or IFNα (5000U/ml) for
24 hours. Then, cells were washed twice and left in culture for 3 additional days. Culture super-
natants were concentrated using Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech) and aliquots of the concen-
trated culture supernatants were used to measure HIV production through the quantification
of viral p24 antigen by p24 HIV Antigen ELISA (PerkinElmer), according to the manufac-
turer's instructions. The remaining equal amounts of concentrated culture supernatants were
used to infect 5 million Jurkat cells (1x106 cells per ml of R10 media) by spinoculation for two
hours. Jurkat cells were collected at days 3, 6, 9, and 12 post-infection, and total genomic DNA
was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit (Qiagen). qPCR was used to
quantify the levels of integrated HIV-1 as described below [79].
Quantification of integrated HIV DNA by qPCR
Integrated HIV DNA levels were quantified using two-step PCR reactions, as previously
described[79]. Integrated HIV-1 DNA was pre-amplified with two Alu primers and a primer
specific for the HIV LTR region, in addition to primers specific for the CD3 gene to determine
cell count. Nested qPCR was then used to amplify HIV and CD3 sequences from the first

 round of amplification. Specimens were assayed with up to 500 ng cellular DNA in triplicate
reaction wells and copy number was determined by extrapolation against a 5-point standard
curve (3–30,000 copies), performed in triplicate using extracted DNA from ACH-2 cells.
sGal-9 level measurement by ELISA
The levels of sGal-9 in the plasma of 72 ART-suppressed HIV-infected individuals were mea-
sured using the solid-phase Human Galectin-9 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D systems) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Measurement of anti-HIV antibodies in plasma
The Limiting Antigen-Avidity (LAg) EIA (Sedia Biosciences, Portland, OR) was used to quan-
tify and characterize the HIV-specific antibody profile in 72 HIV-infected individuals on sup-
pressive ART. The single-well plate-based LAg EIA measures the quantity and avidity of HIV-
specific IgG to subtype B, E and D recombinant HIV-1 envelope antigens [4,54,55].
Statistical analysis
The nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test was used for unpaired comparisons, Wilcoxon
matched-pairs signed ranked test was used for paired comparisons, and Spearman’s r and Pear-
son's r tests were used for correlation analyses (the Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine
normality prior to implementation of the Pearson’s r test). All statistical analyses were con-
ducted using GraphPad Prism release 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and sta-
tistical significance was set at a p-value of 0.05. False discovery rates (FDR) were computed
using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [80] to adjust for multiple comparisons in the RNA-
seq data and qPCR array analysis. The heatmaps were generated using standardized Z-scores,
and the clustering dendrogram depicting relatedness between gene expression profiles was gen-
erated using hierarchical clustering with complete linkage (created using the R statistical
package).
