Background
Acupuncture is often used for prevention of tension-type headache but its effectiveness is still controversial. This is an update of our
Cochrane review originally published in Issue 1, 2009 of The Cochrane Library.
Objectives
To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no prophylactic treatment/routine care only; b) more effective than ’sham’
(placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as other interventions in reducing headache frequency in adults with episodic or chronic
tension-type headache.
Search methods
We searchedCENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and AMED to 19 January 2016. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO)
International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to 10 February 2016 for ongoing and unpublished trials.
Selection criteria
We included randomised trials with a post-randomisation observation period of at least eight weeks, which compared the clinical effects
of an acupuncture intervention with a control (treatment of acute headaches only or routine care), a sham acupuncture intervention
or another prophylactic intervention in adults with episodic or chronic tension-type headache.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors checked eligibility; extracted information on participants, interventions, methods and results; and assessed study
risk of bias and the quality of the acupuncture intervention. The main efficacy outcome measure was response (at least 50% reduction
of headache frequency) after completion of treatment (three to four months after randomisation). To assess safety/acceptability we
extracted the number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects and the number of participants reporting adverse effects. We
assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation).

 Main results
Twelve trials (11 included in the previous version and one newly identified) with 2349 participants (median 56, range 10 to 1265) met
the inclusion criteria.
Acupuncture was compared with routine care or treatment of acute headaches only in two large trials (1265 and 207 participants), but
they had quite different baseline headache frequency and management in the control groups. Neither trial was blinded but trial quality
was otherwise high (low risk of bias). While effect size estimates of the two trials differed considerably, the proportion of participants
experiencing at least 50% reduction of headache frequency was much higher in groups receiving acupuncture than in control groups
(moderate quality evidence; trial 1: 302/629 (48%) versus 121/636 (19%); risk ratio (RR) 2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1 to 3.0;
trial 2: 60/132 (45%) versus 3/75 (4%); RR 11; 95% CI 3.7 to 35). Long-term effects (beyond four months) were not investigated.
Acupuncture was compared with sham acupuncture in seven trials of moderate to high quality (low risk of bias); five large studies
provided data for one or more meta-analyses. Among participants receiving acupuncture, 205 of 391 (51%) had at least 50% reduction
of headache frequency compared to 133 of 312 (43%) in the sham group after treatment (RR 1.3; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.5; four trials;
moderate quality evidence). Results six months after randomisation were similar. Withdrawals were low: 1 of 420 participants receiving
acupuncture dropped out due to adverse effects and 0 of 343 receiving sham (six trials; low quality evidence). Three trials reported
the number of participants reporting adverse effects: 29 of 174 (17%) with acupuncture versus 12 of 103 with sham (12%; odds ratio
(OR) 1.3; 95% CI 0.60 to 2.7; low quality evidence).
Acupuncture was compared with physiotherapy, massage or exercise in four trials of low to moderate quality (high risk of bias); study
findings were inadequately reported. No trial found a significant superiority of acupuncture and for some outcomes the results slightly
favoured the comparison therapy. None of these trials reported the number of participants dropping out due to adverse effects or the
number of participants reporting adverse effects.
Overall, the quality of the evidence assessed using GRADE was moderate or low, downgraded mainly due to a lack of blinding and
variable effect sizes.
Authors’ conclusions
The available results suggest that acupuncture is effective for treating frequent episodic or chronic tension-type headaches, but further
trials - particularly comparing acupuncture with other treatment options - are needed.

Acupuncture for tension-type headache
Bottom line
The available evidence suggests that a course of acupuncture consisting of at least six treatment sessions can be a valuable option for
people with frequent tension-type headache.
Background
Tension-type headache is a common type of headache. Mild episodes may be treated adequately by pain-killers. In some individuals,
however, tension-type headache occurs frequently and significantly impairs their quality of life. Acupuncture is a therapy in which thin
needles are inserted into the skin at particular points. It originated in China and is now used in many countries to treat tension-type
headache. We found randomised controlled trials to evaluate whether acupuncture prevents tension-type headache. We looked mainly
at the numbers of people who responded to treatment, which means a halving of the number of days on which they experienced a
headache.
Key results
We reviewed 12 trials with 2349 adults, published up to January 2016. One new trial is included in this updated review.
Acupuncture added to usual care or treatment of headaches only on onset (usually with pain-killers) in two large trials resulted in 48
in 100 participants having headache frequency at least halved, compared to 17 of 100 participants given usual care only.
Acupuncture was compared with ’fake’ acupuncture, where needles are inserted at incorrect points or do not penetrate the skin, in six
trials. Headache frequency halved in 52 of 100 participants receiving true acupuncture compared with 43 of 100 participants receiving
2

 ’fake’ acupuncture. The results were dominated by one large, good quality trial (with about 400 participants), which showed that the
effect of true acupuncture was still present after six months. There were no differences in the number of side effects of real and ’fake’
acupuncture, or the numbers dropping out because of side effects.
Acupuncture was compared with other treatments such as physiotherapy, massage or relaxation in four trials, but these had no useful
information.
Quality of the evidence
Overall the quality of the evidence was moderate.
B A C K G R O U N D
This review is an update of a previously published review in the
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009, Issue 1) on
’Acupuncture for tension-type headache’ (Linde 2009).
Description of the condition
Patients with tension-type headache suffer from episodes of pain
that is typically bilateral, pressing or tightening in quality, of
mild to moderate intensity, and which does not worsen with rou-
tine physical activity (IHS 2004; IHS 2013). There is no nau-
sea, but photophobia or phonophobia (fear of bright light or
loud sounds) may be present. Infrequent episodic tension-type
headache (episodes of headache lasting minutes to days, which
occur once per month or less often) often has limited impact on
individuals. If headaches occur on more than one but fewer than
15 days per month, this is classified as frequent episodic tension-
type headache. In some patients this can evolve into chronic ten-
sion-type headache (on 15 or more days per month). Tension-type
headache should not be confused with migraine, which is charac-
terised by recurrent attacks of mostly one-sided, severe headache,
although some patients suffer from both types of headaches. Ten-
sion-type headache is the most common type of primary headache
and the disability attributable to it is larger worldwide than that
due to migraine (Stovner 2007). Epidemiological studies report
highly variable prevalence, depending on case definition and coun-
try (Stovner 2007). According to the International Headache Soci-
ety (IHS), the lifetime prevalence in the general population varies
between 30% and 78% (IHS 2013). If headache episodes are not
too frequent (up to a maximum of 10 days per month), unbearable
pain can be treated with analgesic drugs or non-steroidal anti-in-
flammatorydrugs(Pfaffenrath 1998). Inpatientswith chronicten-
sion-type headache,guidelinesrecommendantidepressantssuch as
amitriptyline (Pfaffenrath 1998). In addition to, or instead of drug
therapy, behavioural interventions such as relaxation or biofeed-
back have been shown to be beneficial (McCrory 2000). However,
additional effective intervention tools with good tolerability are
desirable.
Description of the intervention
Acupuncture, in the context of this review, is defined as the
needling of specific points of the body. It is one of the most widely
used complementary therapies in many countries (Bodeker 2005).
For example, according to a population-based survey in the year
2002 in the United States, 4.1% of the respondents reported life-
time use of acupuncture and 1.1% recent use (Burke 2006). A
similar survey in Germany performed in the same year found
that 8.7% of adults between 18 and 69 years of age had received
acupuncture treatment in the previous 12 months (Härtel 2004).
Acupuncture was originally developed as part of Chinese medicine
wherein the purpose of treatment is to bring the patient back to
the state of equilibrium postulated to exist prior to illness (Endres
2007a). Some acupuncture practitioners have dispensed with these
concepts and understand acupuncture in terms of conventional
neurophysiology. Acupuncture is often used as an intervention to
reduce the frequency and intensity of headaches. For example,
9.9% of the acupuncture users in the US survey mentioned above
stated that they had used acupuncture for treating migraine or
other headaches (Burke 2006). Practitioners typically claim that a
single course of treatment, such as 12 sessions over a three-month
period, can have a long-term impact on the frequency and inten-
sity of headache episodes.
How the intervention might work
Multiple studies have shown that acupuncture has short-term
effects on a variety of physiological variables relevant to anal-
gesia (Bäcker 2004; Endres 2007a). However, it is unclear to
what extent these observations from experimental settings are rel-
evant to the long-term effects reported by practitioners. It is as-
sumed that a variable combination of peripheral and local effects;

 spinal and supraspinal mechanisms; and cortical, psychological or
’placebo’ mechanisms contribute to the clinical effects in routine
care (Carlsson 2002). While there is little doubt that acupunc-
ture interventions cause neurophysiological changes in the human
body, the traditional concepts of acupuncture involving specifi-
cally located points on a system of ’channels’ called meridians are
controversial (Kaptchuk 2002).
Why it is important to do this review
Despite its widespread use for a variety of chronic pain conditions
the effectiveness of acupuncture is still controversial. In 2009 we
published the first version of our systematic review of acupuncture
for tension-type headache (Linde 2009). After six years an update
of the review was overdue.
O B J E C T I V E S
To investigate whether acupuncture is a) more effective than no

’sham’ (placebo) acupuncture; and c) as effective as other interven-
tions in reducing headache frequency in participants with episodic
or chronic tension-type headache.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included controlled trials in which allocation to treatment was
explicitly randomised, and in which participants were followed up
for at least eight weeks after randomisation. We excluded trials
in which a clearly inappropriate method of randomisation (for
example, open alternation) was used.
Types of participants
We included trials conducted among adult participants with
episodic and/or chronic tension-type headache. We excluded stud-
ies including participants with headaches of various types (e.g.
50% participants with migraine and 50% participants with ten-
sion-type headache) unless separate results were presented for par-
ticipants with tension-type headache. Duration of disease had to
be at least six months in the great majority (> 80%) of partici-
pants. We considered this criterion met if 1) duration ≥ 6 months
was an inclusion criterion; OR 2) the mean duration - 1 standard
deviation was > 6 months; OR 3) the mean duration (standard
deviation not reported) was > 5 years; OR 4) other information
was presented that made it highly likely that the criterion was met
(e.g. proportions with duration ranges were presented).
Change to the previous version of this review: we have added
the criterion regarding disease duration (to better comply with
common diagnostic standards).
Types of interventions
Experimental interventions considered were:
Any treatment involving needle insertion (with or without manual
or electrical stimulation) at acupuncture points, pain points or
trigger points, described as acupuncture. The planned treatment
course must have had at least six treatment sessions and been
given at least once per week. We included trials with individualised
strategies if the median or mean number of treatments was at least
six sessions and there was no reason to believe that treatments
were given less frequently than once per week in the majority of
participants.
We excluded studies 1) exclusively investigating acupuncture at
specific ’micro-systems’ (e.g. scalp or ear acupuncture - trials us-
ing micro-system points in addition to body acupuncture were
included); 2) studies investigating other methods of stimulating
acupuncture points without needle insertion (for example, acu-
pressure, laser stimulation or transcutaneous electrical stimula-
tion); 3) studies in which fluids were injected at acupuncture
points.
Control interventions considered were:
• no treatment other than treatment of acute headaches or
routine care (which typically includes acute treatment, but might
also include other treatments; however, trials normally require
that no new experimental or standardised treatment be initiated
during the trial period);
• sham interventions (interventions mimicking ’true’
acupuncture/true treatment, but deviating in at least one aspect
considered important by acupuncture theory, such as skin
penetration or correct point location);
• other active treatments, such as pharmacological, cognitive
and physical treatment. We excluded trials comparing
acupuncture to food supplements, herbal drugs or combinations
of herbal drugs.
We also excluded trials that only compared different forms of
acupuncture.
Changes to the previous version of this review: 1) we added a
minimum number of six acupuncture sessions, given at least once
per week, for inclusion, to warrant that participants received an
adequate minimum dose of treatment; 2) we limited eligible other
active treatments to pharmacological, cognitive and physical treat-
ment to sharpen the focus of the review.

Studies had to measure and report at least one of the following
outcome measures for at least eight weeks after randomisation:
headache frequency (days, hours, headache-free days) per defined
time period, response (≥ 50% frequency reduction documented
in a headache diary), pain intensity, disability or quality of life
with a validated measure.
We excluded trials only reporting measures such as ’total effective-
ness rate’ (e.g. proportion of participants healed, much improved,
improved, unchanged); trials reporting only physiological or lab-
oratory parameters; trials with outcome measurement periods of
less than eight weeks (from randomisation to final observation);
and trials focusing on the treatment of acute headache.
Change to the previous version: acceptable outcome measures are
now more explicitly defined.
Primary outcomes
• Response (at least 50% reduction of headache frequency)
after completion of treatment (three to four months after
randomisation).
(See section Measures of treatment effect for details).
Secondary outcomes
• Response at other time points.
• Number of headache days.
• Headache intensity.
• Frequency of analgesic use.
• Headache scores.
(See section Measures of treatment effect for details).
To assess safety/acceptability we used:
• the number of participants dropping out due to adverse
effects; and
• the number of participants reporting adverse effects.
Search methods for identification of studies
We performed the search for this update together with the liter-
ature search for the update of the review on the prophylaxis of
episodic migraine (Linde 2016).
Electronic searches
For this update we searched the following databases without lan-
guage restrictions:
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL 2016, Issue 1), searched for years 2008 to 2016;
• MEDLINE (via PubMed) 2008 to week 1 of January 2016;
• EMBASE (via Ovid) 2008 to 19 January 2016;
• AMED (via OVID) 1985 to January 2016.
The search strategies are reported in Appendix 1. For additional
searches we also regularly checked PubMed new entries using a
simple search string (’acupuncture headache’; last search 10 Febru-
ary 2016). For the previous version of this review (Linde 2009),
we searched the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Trials
Register (whose results are now included in CENTRAL without
relevant delay) and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative & Supportive
Care Trials Register (no longer updated).
Searching other resources
We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) Inter-
national Clinical Trials Registry Platform (http://apps.who.int/
trialsearch/) for completed or ongoing trials using the search string
’acupuncture AND headache’. The last update search was on10
February 2016.
We also searched the reference lists of all eligible studies and pre-
vious systematic reviews (Davis 2008; Endres 2007a; Hao 2013;
McCrory 2000; Wang 2007) for additional studies.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors screened all abstracts identified by the updated
search and excluded those that were clearly irrelevant (for example,
studies focusing on other conditions, reviews, etc.). We obtained
the full texts of all remaining references and again screened them to
exclude clearly irrelevant papers. Two review authors then formally
checked for eligibility all remaining articles and all trials included
in the previous version of our review (Linde 2009) , according to
the above-mentioned selection criteria. We resolved disagreements
by discussion.
Data extraction and management
At least two review authors independently extracted information
on participants, methods, interventions, outcomes and results us-
ing a specially designed form, before entry into Review Man-
ager (RevMan 2014). In particular, we extracted exact diagnoses;
headache classifications used; number and type of centres; age; sex;
duration of disease; number of participants randomised, treated
and analysed; number of, and reasons for, dropouts; duration of
baseline, treatment and follow-up periods; details of acupuncture
treatments (such as selection of points; number, frequency and
duration of sessions; achievement of de-chi (an irradiating feeling
considered to indicate effective needling); number, training and
experience of acupuncturists); and details of control interventions
(sham technique, type and dosage of drugs). For details regarding
methodological issues and study results, see below.

Acupuncture for the prevention of tension-type headache (Review)

 Where necessary, we sought additional information from the first
or corresponding authors of the included studies.
For three trials included in the individual patient database of the
Acupuncture Trialists Collaboration (ATC), an international col-
laborative network for high quality randomised trials of acupunc-
ture for chronic pain (see Vickers 2010; Vickers 2012 and https://
www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/treatments/symptom-management/
integrative-medicine/acupuncture-trialists-collaboration), we ob-
tained uniformly re-analysed summary data for number of
headache days and the number of responders for calculation of
effect sizes (Jena 2008; Melchart 2005; Vickers 2004). We use
these data a) to make our findings as comparable to the results of
the ATC as possible and b) to make sure that a comparable high
quality analysis method was used. For each trial, we created an
ANCOVA model for each numeric outcome at each time point
and adjusted for the baseline value of that outcome, treatment
group (acupuncture or control) and any variables that were used
to stratify randomisation in the original trial. Using this model,
we calculated the adjusted mean outcome values for each group
(acupuncture and control), and we used the standard error for
the effect of treatment from the ANCOVA model to calculate the
standard deviation for the difference in adjusted means. Therefore,
effect sizes calculated in our analyses might to some degree deviate
from those in the original publications of the six trials. Use of raw
data also allowed us to calculate response rates, such as for a 50%
reduction in pain, even if this was not reported in the original trial
publication.
In addition to the ATC data we received additional data relevant
for effect size calculation from the authors of one study (Karst
2001). We receivedsome additional informationfora furtherthree
trials (Carlsson 1990; Söderberg 2006; Wylie 1997). In two tri-
als, additional information was not needed (White 1996; White
2000), and for two older trials, we were unable to contact the study
authors (Ahonen 1984; Tavola 1992). The first author of the new
trial did not respond to inquiries (Kwak 2007).
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
For the assessment of study quality, we used the risk of bias ap-
proach for Cochrane reviews (Higgins 2011). We used the follow-
ing six separate criteria:
• adequate sequence generation;
• allocation concealment;
• blinding;
• incomplete outcome data addressed (up to three months
after randomisation);
• incomplete follow-up outcome data addressed (4 to 12
months after randomisation);
• freedom from selective reporting.
We did not include the item ’other potential threats to validity’ in
a formal manner, but we noted if relevant flaws were detected.
In a first step, we copied information relevant for making a judge-
ment on a criterion from the original publication into an assess-
ment table. If additional information from the study authors was
available, we also entered this in the table, along with an indica-
tion that this was unpublished information. At least two review
authors independently made a judgement as to whether the risk
of bias for each criterion was considered low, high or unclear. We
resolved disagreements by discussion.
For the operationalisation of the first five criteria, we followed the
recommendationsof the CochraneHandbook for SystematicReviews
of Interventions (Higgins 2011). For the ’selective reporting’ item,
we used a more liberal definition. Headache trials typically mea-
sure a multiplicity of headache outcomes at several time points
using diaries and there are a plethora of slightly different out-
come measurement methods. While a single primary endpoint is
sometimes predefined, the overall pattern of a variety of outcomes
is necessary to get a clinically interpretable picture. If the strict
Handbook guidelines had been applied, almost all trials would
have been rated ’unclear’ for the ’selective reporting’ item. We
considered trials as having a low risk of bias for this item if they
reported the results of the most relevant headache outcomes as-
sessed (typically a frequency measure, intensity, analgesic use and
response) for the most relevant time points (end of treatment and,
if done, follow-up), and if the outcomes and time points reported
made it unlikely that authors had picked them out because they
were particularly favourable or unfavourable.
We considered trials that met all criteria, or all but one criterion,
to be of higher quality. Some trials had both blinded sham control
groups and unblinded comparison groups receiving no prophy-
lactic treatment or drug treatment. In the ’Risk of bias’ tables, the
’Judgement’ column always relates to the comparison with sham
interventions. In the ’Description’ column, we also include the
assessment for the other comparison group(s). As the ’Risk of bias’
table does not include a ’not applicable’ option, we rated the item
’incomplete follow-up outcome data addressed (4 to 12 months
after randomisation)?’ as ’unclear’ for trials that did not follow up
participants for longer than three months.
Assessment of the adequacy of the acupuncture intervention
We also attempted to provide a crude estimate of the quality of
acupuncture. Two review authors (mostly GA and BB, or, for trials
in which one of these review authors was involved, AW) who are
trained in acupuncture and have several years of practical experi-
ence, answered two questions. The trial from Korea was assessed
by only one review author (BCS). First, review authors were asked
how they would treat the participants included in the study. An-
swer options were ’exactly or almost exactly the same way’, ’sim-
ilarly’, ’differently’, ’completely differently’ or ’could not assess’
due to insufficient information (on acupuncture or on the partic-
ipants). Second, they were asked to rate their degree of confidence
that acupuncture was applied in an appropriate manner on a 100
6

 mm visual scale (with 0% = complete absence of evidence that the
acupuncture was appropriate, and 100% = total certainty that the
acupuncture was appropriate). The latter method was proposed
by a member of the review team (AW) and has been used in a
systematic review of clinical trials of acupuncture for back pain
(Ernst 1998). In the Characteristics of included studies table, the
acupuncturists’ assessments are summarised under ’Methods’ (for
example, ’similarly/70%’ indicates a trial where the acupuncturist-
review author would treat ’similarly’ and is 70% confident that
acupuncture was applied appropriately).
Measures of treatment effect
For the purposes of summarising results, we categorised the in-
cluded trials according to control groups: 1) comparisons with no
acupuncture (treatment of acute headaches only or routine care);
2)comparisonswith shamacupuncture interventions; and 3) com-
parisons with other treatments.
We defined four time windows for which we tried to extract and
analyse study findings:
• up to eight weeks/two months after randomisation;
• three to four months after randomisation;
• five to six months after randomisation; and
• more than six months after randomisation.
In all included studies acupuncture treatment started immediately
or very soon after randomisation.
If more than one data point was available for a given time window,
we used: for the first time window, preferably the data closest to
eight weeks; for the second window, the data closest to four weeks
after completion of treatment (for example, if treatment lasted
eight weeks, data for weeks 9 to 12); for the third window, the
data closest to six months; and for the fourth window, data closest
to 12 months.
We extracted data for the following outcomes (taking the guide-
lines of the International Headache Society Clinical Trials Sub-
committee (IHS Clinical Trials Subcommittee 2009) into ac-
count).
• Proportion of ’responders’. For trials investigating the
superiority of acupuncture compared to no acupuncture or sham
intervention, we used, if available, the number of participants
with a reduction of at least 50% in the number of headache days
per four weeks and divided it by the number of participants
randomised to the respective group. In studies comparing
acupuncture with other therapies, we used for the denominator
the number of participants analysed. If the number of responders
regarding headache days was not available, we used global
assessment measures by participants or physicians. We calculated
responder rate ratios (risk ratio of having a response) and 95%
confidence intervals as effect size measures.
• Number of headache days (means and standard deviations)
per four-week period (calculation of mean differences).
• Headache intensity (any measures available, extraction of
means and standard deviations, calculation of standardised mean
differences).
• Frequency of analgesic use (any continuous or rank
measures available, extraction of means and standard deviations,
calculation of standardised mean differences).
• Headache score (any measures available, extraction of
means and standard deviations, calculation of standardised mean
differences).
The main outcome measure was the proportion of responders for
the three- to four-month window (close to the end of the treat-
ment cycle and a time point for which outcome data are often
available). Secondary outcomes of major interest were responder
proportions at other time points and the number of headache days
(all four time points; this outcome is recommended as a primary
outcome for randomised trials by the International Headache So-
ciety Clinical Trials Subcommittee). We calculated risk ratios of
having a response and 95% confidence intervals as effect size mea-
sures. Risk ratios > 1 indicate that there were more responders in
the acupuncture group compared to the comparator group. For
headache days we calculated mean differences and their respective
95% confidence intervals. For continuous measures, we used, if
available, the data from intention-to-treat analyses with missing
values replaced; otherwise we used the data presented on available
cases. All these outcomes rely on patient reports, mainly collected
in headache diaries.
As safety/acceptability outcomes we used the number of partici-
pants dropping out due to adverse effects and the number of par-
ticipants reporting at least one adverse event or effect. As the num-
ber of events was typically low we calculated odds ratios instead of
risk ratios. Odds ratios > 1 indicate more events (e.g. dropouts) in
the acupuncture group.
Unit of analysis issues
The unit of analysis was the individual participant.
Dealing with missing data
If publications reported study findings with insufficient detail or
in an inconsistent manner we attempted to obtain further infor-
mation from the authors. Regarding missing patient data due to
dropout or loss to follow-up in the included studies we used the
following strategies: for continuous measures we used, if available,
the data from intention-to-treat analyses with missing values re-
placed; otherwise, we used the data presented on available cases.
For response we used the number of responders and divided it
by the number of participants randomised to the respective group
(counting missing information as non-response).

 Assessment of heterogeneity
We pooled individual studies only for the comparison versus sham.
We assessed heterogeneity with the Cochrane Chi² test and the I²
statistic.
Assessment of reporting biases
Given the low number of trials per comparison we did not use
formal methods for assessing reporting biases.
Data synthesis
As the only two trials comparing acupuncture and no acupuncture
differed strongly regarding participants and care in the control
group (details see below), we did not pool the findings of these
trials and only present the effect size of the individual studies at the
available time points. For the comparison versus sham we calcu-
lated pooled fixed-effect estimates, their 95% confidence intervals,
the Chi2 test for heterogeneity and the I2 statistic. If the P value
of the Chi² test for heterogeneity was < 0.2 and/or the I² > 40%
we reported random-effects estimates in addition. Following the
recommendation of the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive
Collaborative Review Group we presented forest plots only if there
were at least two trials and 200 participants (for at least one time
window).
We have summarised findings from trials comparing acupuncture
with other active treatment descriptively due to insufficient data
presentation and the great diversity of the available trials.
Change to the previous version:
Based on the recommendation of the statistician in our team (AV)
we now use fixed-effect models for calculating pooled estimates.
This is primarily because a fixed-effect analysis constitutes a valid
test of the null hypothesis. Moreover, due to very large discrep-
ancies in sample size, a random-effects model would have partic-
ipants in small studies counting considerably more than partici-
pants in large studies. Nonetheless, if the P value of the Chi² test
for heterogeneity was < 0.2 and/or the I² > 40% we reported ran-
dom-effects estimates in addition.
Quality of the evidence
We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence
related to key outcomes as appropriate (GRADEpro GDT 2015;
Schünemann 2011). Key outcomes were our primary outcome,
response three to four months after randomisation, the number of
headache days for the same time window, the number of patients
dropping out due to adverse effects and the number of patients
reporting adverse effects. The GRADE Working Group grades of
evidence are:
• High quality: We are very confident that the true effect lies
close to that of the estimate of the effect.
• Moderate quality: We are moderately confident in the effect
estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the
effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
• Low quality: Our confidence in the effect estimate is
limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the
estimate of the effect.
• Very low quality: We have very little confidence in the effect
estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from
the estimate of effect.
We decreased the grade due to:
• serious (-1) or very serious (-2) limitation to study quality;
• important inconsistency (-1);
• some (-1) or major (-2) uncertainty about directness;
• imprecise or sparse data (-1);
• high probability of reporting bias (-1).

Description of studies
Results of the search
The common update searches performed for this review and the
update of the review on the prophylaxis of episodic migraine
(Linde 2016) identified 527 hits (517 by database searches, five by
checking references and alerts, and four from checking entries in
trials registries not otherwise identified). The majority of the 75
full-text publications obtained and all four additional entries from
clinical trial registries addressed migraine. We formally checked
eight publications, which we deemed potentially eligible, against
the eligibility criteria (see Figure 1). Only one new trial could be
included (Kwak 2007). For one trial already included in the pre-
vious version (Söderberg 2006), a new, additional publication was
available. However, this new publication did not report informa-
tion that was directly usable in our review.

 Included studies
Thisupdate includes12trialsdescribedin22 publications(includ-
ing published protocols and papers reporting additional aspects
such as treatment details or cost-effectiveness analyses) (Ahonen
1984; Carlsson 1990; Endres 2007; Jena 2008; Karst 2001; Kwak
2007 Melchart 2005; Söderberg 2006; Tavola 1992; White 1996;
White 2000; Wylie 1997).
A total of 2349 participants with tension-type headache were
included in the studies (median 56, range 10 to 1265). Five
were multicentre trials (Endres 2007; Jena 2008; Melchart 2005;
Söderberg 2006; White 2000); the remaining seven were per-
formed in a single centre. Four trials originated from Germany
(Endres 2007; Jena 2008; Karst 2001; Melchart 2005), three from
the UK (White 1996; White 2000; Wylie 1997), two from Swe-
den (Carlsson 1990; Söderberg 2006), and one each from Fin-
land (Ahonen 1984), Italy (Tavola 1992), and Korea (Kwak 2007).
Two trials included only participants with episodic tension-type
headache (White 1996; White 2000), and three only participants
with chronic tension-type headache (Carlsson 1990; Kwak 2007;
Söderberg 2006). The remaining trials either explicitly stated that
they included both forms (Endres 2007; Jena 2008; Karst 2001;
Melchart2005), ormade noclearstatement(Ahonen 1984; Tavola
1992; Wylie 1997).
All trials used a parallel-group design (no cross-over trials). Ten
trials had two groups (one acupuncture group and one control
group), and two trials had two control groups (Melchart 2005;
Söderberg 2006). In two trials acupuncture was compared to
routine care (Jena 2008), or treatment of acute headaches only
(Melchart 2005). Seven trials used a sham control but the actual
techniques varied. In four trials, non-acupuncture points were nee-
dled (Endres 2007; Kwak 2007; Melchart 2005; Tavola 1992),
while inthe remainingthree non-skin-penetratingtechniqueswere
used (Karst 2001; White 1996; White 2000) (see Characteristics
of included studies for details). Three trials compared acupunc-
ture with physiotherapy (Ahonen 1984; Carlsson 1990; Söderberg
2006); one of these had an additional relaxation control group
(Söderberg 2006). Wylie 1997 compared acupuncture with a com-
bination of massage and relaxation. There was no trial that com-
pared acupuncture with prophylactic drug treatment.
The largest study by far used a quite unusual approach and has
to be described in greater detail (Jena 2008). In this very large,
highly pragmatic study, 15,056 headache participants recruited by
more than 4000 physicians in Germany were included. A total of
11,874 participants who did not give consent to randomisation re-
ceived up to 15 acupuncture treatments within three months and
were followed up for an additional three months. This was also the
case for 1613 participants randomised to immediate acupuncture,
while the remaining 1569 participants remained on routine care
(not further defined) for three months and then received acupunc-
ture. The published analysis of this trial is on all randomised par-
ticipants, but the authors and the Acupuncture Trialists Collabora-
tion provided us with unpublished results of subgroup analyses on
the 1265 participants with tension-type headache. The large num-
ber of practitioners involved and the pragmatic approach make it
likely that there is some diagnostic uncertainty as to whether all
participants truly had tension-type headache.
The number of acupuncture sessions varied between 6 and 15.
Three trials selected acupuncture points in an individualised man-
ner (Jena 2008; Tavola 1992; Wylie 1997), and eight in a semi-
standardised manner (either by having some mandatory points
in all participants plus individualised points, or by using prede-
finedpointselectionsdependingonsyndrome diagnosesaccording
to Chinese medicine) (Ahonen 1984; Endres 2007; Karst 2001;
Kwak 2007; Melchart 2005; Söderberg 2006; White 1996; White
2000). One trial used a standardised point selection (Carlsson
1990). In two trials, brief needling was used (needles inserted for
a few seconds only) (White 1996; White 2000). For one trial,
both acupuncturist-reviewers considered the treatment ’inade-
quate’ (Carlsson 1990). Both acupuncturist-review authors would
have used different treatment approaches for the participants in
a further four trials (Ahonen 1984; Karst 2001; Söderberg 2006;
White 2000). In trials using individualised strategies, assessments
were difficult because of a lack of detail about the actual interven-
tions used.
Post-randomisation observation periods varied between 8 and 64
weeks. Apart from three trials (Ahonen 1984; Carlsson 1990; Jena
2008), all trials used diaries for the measurement of the most im-
portant headache outcomes. All but two trials, Ahonen 1984 and
Jena 2008, included a baseline observation period before randomi-
sation. The trials comparing acupuncture to other therapies rarely
presented their findings in a manner allowing effect size calcula-
tion, while for trials comparing acupuncture with no acupuncture
or sham acupuncture, effect size estimates could be calculated for
the most relevant outcomes.
Excluded studies
We excluded four newly identified trials for this update. Chassot
2015 was a cross-over trial in which the observation period per
phase was less than eight weeks. Guerreiro da Silva 2012 included
only pregnant women in whom headache started during preg-
nancy. Hong 2007 followed participants for only three weeks af-
ter randomisation (two weeks treatment and one-week follow-up
observation); furthermore, it seems that participants with recent
onset of headache were included. Sozen 2013 was a trial in partic-
ipants with chronic daily headache (chronic migraine or chronic
tension-type headache); results for participants with tension-type

 headache were not available separately.
Risk of bias in included studies
Figure 2 provides a summary of the assessments of risks of bias
in the individual studies; Figure 3 provides an overview across
studies for the single items. It has to be taken into account that the
four trials without long-term follow-up had to be rated unclear
although this criterion has to be considered as not applicable (
Ahonen 1984; Jena 2008; White 1996; Wylie 1997). Five trials
have major risks of bias, important uncertainties or are reported so
insufficiently that a reliable assessment was not possible (Ahonen
1984; Carlsson 1990; Kwak 2007; Söderberg 2006; Wylie 1997).

Allocation
Anadequate methodof sequence generationwasreportedforseven
trials (Endres 2007; Jena 2008; Karst 2001; Kwak 2007; Melchart
2005; White1996; White2000)(lowriskof bias), andanadequate
method for allocation concealment for five (Endres 2007; Jena
2008; Melchart 2005; White 1996; White 2000).
Blinding
Participants were blinded only in the seven sham-controlled trials
(Endres 2007; Karst 2001; Kwak 2007; Melchart 2005; Tavola
1992; White 1996; White 2000 (low risk of bias). We judged the
remaining five studies to be at high risk of bias.
Incomplete outcome data
Attrition was low or adequately accounted for in analyses up to
three months after randomisation in seven trials (Endres 2007;
Jena 2008; Karst 2001; Melchart 2005; Söderberg 2006; Tavola
1992; White 2000), and in three of seven trials that had a follow-
up longer than three months (Endres 2007; Melchart2005; Tavola
1992). We judged the remaining five studies to be at unclear risk
of bias.
Selective reporting
While the reporting of study results was variable and often not
easily usable for effect size calculation, we considered the risk of
selective reporting to be low in 10 of 12 studies. We judged two
studies to be at unclear risk of bias (Carlsson 1990; Wylie 1997),
and the remaining study to be at high risk of bias (Ahonen 1984).
Other potential sources of bias
We did not assess the included studies for other potential sources
of bias.
Effects of interventions
Comparisons with routine care/treatment of acute
headaches only
The two trials comparing acupuncture to routine care only (Jena
2008; n = 1265) or treatment of acute headaches only (Melchart
2005; n = 207) were unblinded but otherwise had a low risk of bias.
In both trials, participants received acupuncture three months af-
ter randomisation (waiting list condition), so it is only possible
to assess short-term effects up to three months after the start of
the treatment. We did not calculate pooled effect size estimates,
as headache baseline frequency and management in the control
groups of the two trials were quite different. The participants
included in Melchart 2005 (n = 207) had much more frequent
13

 headaches at baseline (mean 17.6 days/month) than those in Jena
2008 (7.0 days). While the effect size estimates of the two trials
differed considerably the proportion of participants experiencing
at least 50% reduction of headache frequency was much higher in
groups receiving acupuncture than in control groups (moderate
quality evidence; trial 1: 302/629 (48%) versus 121/636 (19%);
risk ratio (RR) 2.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.11 to 3.02;
number needed to treat 3; 95% CI 3 to 5; trial 2: 60/132 (45%)
versus 3/75 (4%); RR 11.36; 95% CI 3.69 to 34.98; number
needed to treat 2; 95% CI 1 to 9; see Analysis 1.1).
The differences between acupuncture and waiting list groups for
the number of headache days at three months were 5.8 days (95%
CI 4.0 to 7.5) and 3.9 days (95% CI 3.3 to 4.6), respectively
(Analysis 1.2). Again, while the effect size in the two trials differed,
both showed a clinically important difference (moderate quality
evidence). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for both
headache days and reduction by at least 50% to moderate due to
the variable effect sizes and lack of blinding.
Large differences were also found for headache intensity (Analysis
1.3).
Only the Melchart 2005 trial reported on days with analgesic
use and headache score findings. For both outcomes acupuncture
showed significant and clinically relevant benefits over waiting list.
As adverse effects and the number of participants dropping out
due to adverse effects were not measured in the waiting list groups
comparative results for these outcomes are not available.
Comparisons with sham treatment
Five of the six interpretable trials with sham comparisons had com-
parably good quality (Endres 2007; Karst 2001; Melchart 2005;
Tavola 1992; White 2000), despite some problems with attrition
during long-term follow-up (Karst 2001; White 2000), and some
uncertainties regarding the details of randomisation (Karst 2001;
Tavola 1992). In one trial it was difficult to assess quality reliably
due to insufficient reporting (Kwak 2007). Four trials had follow-
up periods of about six months after randomisation and one more
than 12 months (Tavola 1992). Five trials reported findings on
response and headache in a manner that allowed effect size cal-
culation for at least one time window (Endres 2007; Karst 2001;
Melchart 2005; Tavola 1992; White 2000).
After treatment (time window three to four months) 205 of 391
(52%) participants receiving acupuncture had at least 50% reduc-
tion of headache frequency compared to 133 of 312 (43%) in the
sham group (RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.48; I2 = 0%; four tri-
als; moderate quality evidence; Analysis 2.1; Figure 4). We down-
graded the quality of the evidence to moderate given the small
number of trials, the limited precision of the effect estimate and
the dominance of one large trial. This corresponds to a number
needed to treat of 8 (95% CI 5 to 25). The findings are very similar
in the time windows up to two months after randomisation (RR
1.26; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.45) and up to six months after randomi-
sation (RR 1.17; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.35; Figure 4). Only one small
trial (n = 30) provided data for the time window more than six
months after randomisation (RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.53 to 4.26).

The same five trials also reported data on the number of headache
days per month for at least one time window. After treatment (time
window three to four months) the pooled estimate indicated 1.62
fewer headache days in the acupuncture groups (95% CI 0.54
to 2.69 days; I² = 0%; four trials with 653 participants; number
of headache days in sham groups varying between 9 and 16 days
per month; moderate quality evidence; Analysis 2.2; Figure 5).
We downgraded the quality of the evidence to moderate for the
same reasons as for the outcome at least 50% reduction. The find-
ings are very similar in the time windows up to two months after
randomisation (mean difference 1.49 days; 95% CI 0.39 to 2.58
days) and up to six months after randomisation (1.51 days; 95%
CI 0.43 to 2.59 days; Figure 5). Data for the time window more
than six months after randomisation were not available. It should
be noted that the by far largest trial (409 participants) dominated
the meta-analyses (75% to 80% weight) (Endres 2007). There
was no indication of relevant statistical heterogeneity in any of the
analyses; however, these analyses have limited power.

headache days.
Regarding headache intensity, a small, statistically significant dif-
ference was found at five to six months (standardised mean dif-
ference (SMD) -0.20; four trials with 670 participants) but not at
up to two months (SMD -0.12; three trials with 143 participants)
or three to four months (SMD -0.10; four trials with 655 partici-
pants) after randomisation (see Analysis 2.3).
Three trials reported data on the frequency of analgesic use for the
first two time windows (266 and 261 participants, respectively;
see Analysis 2.4). When we pooled these trials, there was a small,
significant effect of acupuncture over sham controls (standardised
mean differences 0.31 and 0.30, respectively).
Headache score data were measured in only two small trials, but
they did not provide usable data for effect size calculation.
One of 420 participants receiving acupuncture dropped out due to
adverse effects compared to none of 343 receiving sham (odds ratio
(OR) 1.45; 95% CI 0.06 to 36.06; six trials; low quality evidence).
The number of participants reporting adverse effects in the three
trials reporting this outcome was 29 of 174 (17%) versus 12 of
103 (12%; OR 1.26; 95% CI 0.60 to 2.65; low quality evidence).
We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low due to the very
low precision of the estimates and the somewhat unclear methods
for assessing adverse effects in the trials.
Comparisons with other treatments
The four trials comparing acupuncture with physiotherapy (
Ahonen 1984; Carlsson 1990; Söderberg 2006), relaxation (
Söderberg 2006), or a combination of massage and relaxation
(Wylie 1997), provide almost no data for effect size estimation
and must be interpreted with great caution. There is high risk of
bias in the three older trials (Ahonen 1984; Carlsson 1990; Wylie
1997, see Characteristics of included studies), and the reporting
of results is insufficient. The most recent trial has somewhat bet-
ter quality and reported means (but no standard deviations) for a
large number of outcomes measured (Söderberg 2006).
Ahonen 1984 reported slightly higher response rates in the
acupuncture group, Carlsson 1990 reported better results in the
physiotherapy group, Söderberg 2006 found significantly fewer
headache days per four weeks in the relaxation group immediately
after treatment but no other significant differences, and Wylie
1997 found no significant differences.

 None of the trials reported the number of participants dropping
out due to adverse effects or the number of participants reporting
adverse effects.
Effect size estimates for response, intensity, frequency of analgesic
use and headache scores could not be calculated due to insufficient
reporting.

Summary of main results
Since the publication of the previous version of our review (Linde
2009), only one new small, sham-controlled trial has become avail-
able. Therefore, our findings remain largely unchanged. Two un-
blinded, but otherwise adequately performed, large studies show
that adding acupuncture to routine care or treatment of acute
headaches reduces the frequency of headaches in the short term
(three months). Long-term effects were not investigated. Seven
trials compared various acupuncture strategies with various sham
interventions. Pooled analyses of the trials found a small but sig-
nificant reduction of headache frequency over sham over a period
of six months. None of the four trials comparing acupuncture with
physiotherapy, massage or exercise found a superiority of acupunc-
ture, and for some outcomes better results were observed with a
comparison therapy. However, these mostly small and older trials
of limited quality are difficult to interpret.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Acupuncture is a therapy that is applied in a variable manner in
different countries and settings. For example, in Germany, where
the three largest trials included in this review were performed,
acupuncture is mainly provided by general practitioners and other
physicians. Their approach to acupuncture is based on the the-
ories of traditional Chinese medicine, although the amount of
training they receive in traditional Chinese medicine is limited
(Weidenhammer 2007). In the UK, the providers are likely to be
non-medical acupuncturists with a comparatively intense tradi-
tional training, physiotherapists or medical doctors with a more
’Western’ approach (Dale 1997). The trials included in this re-
view come from a variety of countries and used a variety of study
approaches. However, as with other therapies for tension-type
headache (McCrory 2000), the evidence base available is far from
complete. Despite its frequency, tension-type headache is investi-
gated much less often than migraine. For the German setting, the
two large studies available clearly show clinically relevant short-
term benefits of adding acupuncture to no treatment or routine
care (Jena 2008; Melchart 2005). However, it is unclear whether
these findingscanbe extrapolatedtoothersettings. Itisalsounclear
whether patients with episodic and chronic tension-type headache
respond in a different manner to acupuncture.
The findings of our review are consistent with the increasing
evidence that true acupuncture has a small effect over sham
acupuncture interventionsforavarietyof chronic pain (Lam 2013;
Linde 2016; Manheimer 2010; Vickers 2012). If the reduction of
headache days over sham is expressed as a standardised mean dif-
ference to make it comparable with the findings of trials in other
chronic pain conditions, the estimates (between 0.20 and 0.22 for
the three time windows with available data) are very similar to
those in the cited reviews. If the true effects are of that size this
has a number of implications. First, all available trials - even the
largest trial in our review (Endres 2007) - have been underpow-
ered. To achieve 80% power a trial would have to include around
400 participants per group (Linde 2010b). Second, as it is almost
impossible to blind acupuncturists and to rule out some degree
of unblinding of participants in acupuncture trials (as in trials
of many other non-pharmacological interventions) this small ef-
fect might even be overestimated due to performance and detec-
tion bias. Traditional theories underlying acupuncture are scien-
tifically questionable; therefore, many sceptics consider acupunc-
ture a placebo only (e.g. McGeeney 2015). On the other hand,
there are both physiological concepts and experimental evidence
that acupuncture has ’specific’ effects beyond the traditional con-
cepts (e.g. Kong 2009; Yang 2012). There is also increasing ev-
idence that sham acupuncture is either more potent than other
placebos, not an inert placebo, or both (Corbett 2013; Kaptchuk
2006; Linde 2010a; Linde 2010b; Meissner 2013), that acupunc-
ture has clinically relevant effects over usual care controls (Lam
2013; Linde 2016; Manheimer 2010; Vickers 2012), and that
acupuncture compares well with a number of active interventions
(Corbett 2013; Linde 2016).
We did not find any comparisons of acupuncture with prophy-
lactic drug treatment. The trial by Endres 2007 was originally
designed to include a third arm of participants randomised to
amitriptyline, the currently most widely accepted therapy (Diener
2004). However, as participants were unwilling to participate in a
trial with the possibility of being randomised to amitriptyline, this
arm was dropped after one year of very poor accrual. This suggests
that participants ready to accept treatment with acupuncture and
amitriptyline differ. Apart from the trial by Söderberg 2006, the
trials comparing acupuncture with physiotherapy, relaxation and
massage are reported insufficiently or have relevant methodolog-
ical shortcomings. The question of how acupuncture compares
to other non-pharmacological treatments cannot be answered at
present.
Overall, the evidence on the effects of acupuncture for tension-
type headache far is from complete. For the comparison with no
treatment (beyond treating acute pain) or non-structured routine
care it is not possible to reliably estimate the size of the effects. In
the two trials short-term effects are large (standardised mean dif-
ferences 0.73 and 1.02), but without further large studies the con-
17

 fidence in these estimates is low. Long-term effects have not been
investigated. Findings on the effects over sham seem to be con-
sistent but the number of trials in our analyses is limited. Future
trials might lead to important changes in our effect estimates (al-
though our findings are consistent with those in other conditions).
The available evidence is insufficient to assess how acupuncture
compares with other treatment options.
Quality of the evidence
While some new trials have acceptable quality, overall there are
relevant methodological problems or uncertainties in about half
of the studies (high risks of bias). Designing and performing clin-
ical trials of acupuncture is a challenge, particularly with respect
to blinding and selection of control interventions. As all relevant
headache outcomes have to be assessed by the participants them-
selves, reporting bias is possible in all trials comparing acupuncture
to no treatment, routine, care, drug treatment or other therapies.
Using GRADE, we considered the overall quality of the evidence
that acupuncture reduces headache frequency over usual care/
treatment of acute headaches only and sham to be moderate. Rea-
sons for not considering the quality of evidence to be high were
the lack of blinding of participants (for the comparison with usual
care/treatment of acute headaches only), the unblinded treatment
providers (both comparisons), and the variable effect sizes in clini-
cally diverse trials (comparison with acupuncture usual care/treat-
ment of acute headaches only). We did not further downgrade our
rating for the comparison of acupuncture with usual care/treat-
ment of acute headaches only because the findings consistently
showed clinically relevant effects in spite of the variable effect sizes.
Our safety outcomes (the number of participants dropping out
due to adverse effects and the number of participants with adverse
effects) were only reported in trials with sham controls. As these
events were rare both in the acupuncture and sham groups these
estimates are very imprecise (low quality evidence).
Potential biases in the review process
We are confident that we have identified the existing large clinical
trials relevant to our question, but we cannot rule out the pos-
sibility that there are additional small trials that are unpublished
or published in sources not accessible by our search. We have not
systematically searched Chinese or Korean databases for this ver-
sion of the review, but trials meeting our selection criteria beyond
the one included Korean trial, Kwak 2007, might exist. The few
Chinese and Korean trials identified through our literature search
did not meet the inclusion criteria. There is considerable skepti-
cism toward clinical trials from China because results that have
been reported in the past have been almost exclusively positive
(Vickers 1998). However, the quality and number of randomised
trials published in Chinese and other Asian languages have im-
proved over recent years (Wang 2007), and it seems inadequate
to neglect this evidence without examining it critically. Reviewers
from China (YF) and Korea (BCF) have been included in the team
to overcome this shortcoming in future updates.
Three members of the review team were involved in at least one
of the included trials. These trials were assessed by other members
of the review team. All review authors are or were affiliated to a
CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) research centre
and six (GA, BB, YF, MM, BCS, AW) of the review authors use
acupuncture regularly in their patients.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
There are two other sufficiently up-to-date relevant systematic re-
views that summarise randomised trials of acupuncture for ten-
sion-type headache. The review by Davis 2008 was restricted to
sham-controlled trials, but included cross-over trials with obser-
vation periods shorter than eight weeks per phase, which we ex-
cluded in our review. The main outcome measure was the number
of headache days per month during treatment (broadly compa-
rable to our first time window) and at long-term follow-up (20
to 25 weeks). Eight trials met the inclusion criteria for the re-
view and five provided sufficient data for meta-analysis. Interest-
ingly, although the authors’ meta-analytic calculations for the ef-
fect during treatment yielded a larger group difference than ours
for the first time window (2.93 days compared to 1.56 days), their
findings were statistically not significant, while ours are statisti-
cally significant. This is due to the fact that Davis 2008 includes
the extremely positive cross-over trial by Xue 2004 (using elec-
tro-acupuncture), excluded by us, which leads to heterogeneity,
and uses earlier, slightly more negative data for the White 2000
trial. Together with the use of a random-effects model for meta-
analysis these factors result in much wider confidence intervals (-
7.49 to 1.64 in Davis 2008 compared to -3.02 to -0.10 in our
review). Findings for the long-term outcomes are very similar to
ours (a small but significant benefit of acupuncture over sham).
Davis 2008 concludes that acupuncture has limited efficacy for
the reduction of headache frequency compared to sham treatment.
The meta-analysis by Hao 2013 includes the same five trials also
analysed by Davis 2008. The authors performed several subgroup
analyses to explore sources of heterogeneity. Due to the small num-
ber of trials these are hypothesis-generating at best. The authors
conclude that stimulation mode, needle retention and treatment
frequency might influence trial outcomes in a relevant manner.

 Implications for practice
The available results suggest that acupuncture may be considered
for treating frequent episodic or chronic tension-type headaches.
Implications for research
There is clearly a need for large, high quality trials compar-
ing acupuncture to other effective (pharmacological and non-
pharmacological) treatments for frequent or chronic tension-type
headache. Further trials investigating the long-term effects of
adding acupuncture to routine care or treating acute headaches
only are also desirable as both available trials originate from Ger-
many and have short observation periods. We do not consider
sham-controlled trials a priority for the future. The cumulative
evidence suggests that acupuncture is effective in various chronic
pain conditions, that correct point selection plays a role, but a less
important role than acupuncturists have thought, and that a rel-
evant part of the clinical benefit might be due to needling effects
not dependent on the selection of traditional points or powerful
placebo effects, or both. If researchers decide to perform a sham-
controlled trial, they should seriously consider including a third
group receiving another treatment or no treatment beyond treat-
ment of acute headaches. Furthermore, they should be aware that
the way the treatment is delivered might have an important impact
on outcomes (Kaptchuk 2008), and that large sample sizes might
be needed to identify any small point-specific effects.

Methods
Blinding: participants, telephone interviewers; blinding tested and successful
Dropouts/withdrawals: only a very small number of participants, bias unlikely
Observation period: 4 weeks baseline; 6 weeks treatment; 20 weeks follow-up
Assessment of acupuncture: GA similarly/40% - BB similarly/75%
Participants
Number of participants included/analysed: 409/409
Condition: episodic or chronic tension-type headache (IHS)
Demographics: median age 38 years (range 29 to 48 years); 78% female
Setting: 122 primary care practices in Germany
Time since onset of headaches: median 7.3 (acupuncture) and 8.7 (sham) years (range
3.1 to 18.3 years)
Interventions
Acupuncture points: semi-standardised - depending on Chinese syndrome diagnosis,
predefined collections of obligatory and flexible points
Information on acupuncturists: 122 primary care physicians; at least 140 hours of
acupuncture training, average experience 8.5 years (range 2 to 36 years)

(Continued)
DeChi achieved?: yes
Number of treatment sessions: 10 (if moderate response further 5 sessions possible)
Frequency of treatment sessions: 2/week
Control intervention: sham acupuncture (superficial needling at distant non-acupunc-
ture points)
Outcomes
Method for outcome measurement: diary and interviews
Main outcome measure: at least 50% frequency reduction and no protocol violations
Otheroutcomes: number of headache days per 4 weeks, at least 50% frequency reduction
(regardless of protocol violations), quality of life (SF-12), von Korff chronic pain grading
scale, global patient rating
Notes
Large, rigorous trial with unusual main outcome measure (responders were re-classified
to non-responders for various reasons, for example if there were minor changes in acute
medication (participants were allowed to use only one of their pre-baseline oral headache
analgesics)). The trial initially included a third arm with amitriptyline, which had to be
close as no one was willing to be randomised to this arm(therefore this arm was closed)

Methods
Sequence generation: computer program (information from author)
Concealment: central telephone randomisation (information from author)
Blinding: none
Dropouts/withdrawals: 1479 of 1613 included in the acupuncture group with 3-month
data versus 1456 of 1569 in the control group; sensitivity analyses with missing values
replaced confirm main analysis based on available data
Observation period: no baseline period; treatment 3 months; no follow-up (for ran-
domised comparison)
Assessment of acupuncture: GA insufficient information for an assessment - BB ?
Participants
Number of participants included/analysed: 3182/2935 with migraine or TTH (of those
included 1265 with TTH, no information on numbers of TTH participants analysed)
Condition: migraine and/or tension-type headache (IHS)
Demographics: mean age 44 years, 77% female (for total group)
Setting: several thousand practices in Germany
Time since onset of headaches: 10.8 years (for total group)
Interventions
Acupuncture points: individualised selection
Information on acupuncturists: multiple physicians with at least 140 hours of acupunc-
ture training
DeChi achieved?: no information
Number of treatment sessions: up to a maximum of 15
Frequency of treatment sessions: individualised
Control intervention: waiting list receiving “usual care”
Outcomes
Method for outcome measurement: questionnaires, no diary
Primary outcome: headache days in the third month
Other outcomes: intensity, quality of life
Notes
Large, very pragmatic study including both participants with migraine and tension-
type headache reporting some outcomes for headache subgroups; treating physicians
were completely free to choose points, number of sessions (upper limit allowed 15) etc.
Unclear what usual care consisted of. Some diagnostic misclassification likely. Authors
provided raw means, standard deviations and number of observations for headache days
and headache intensity

Comment: NICE has recently issued guidance about not using acupuncture for lower back pain because of lack of robust evidence of
effectiveness http://www.csp.org.uk/news/2016/03/24/no-more-acupuncture-low-back-pain-say-nice-draft-proposals
At the same time, this review is being suggested as an example of a review with *positive* results to be used to teach students about
Cochrane.
http://community.cochrane.org/news/speaking-to-students-about-cochrane
I realise the condition is different, but it concerns me that most or all of the authors of this review practice and teach acupuncture.
Reply
Response prepared by the author team, Linde K, Allais G, Brinkhaus B, Fei Y, Mehring M, Shin BC, Vickers A, White AR.
The comment refers to a website commenting on a draft document on low back pain by NICE. We do not think that we as authors of
a review on tension-type headache should discuss in detail a draft of a guideline for a quite different condition, particularly, as serious
concerns regarding the evidence summary underlying the draft and the conclusions drawn have been raised (http://blogs.bmj.com/
aim/).
If the editors of the Cochrane Library choose our review as an example for teaching we are pleased, but we neither had any influence
on this decision nor do we think we should justify or comment on it. We tried our best to summarize the available data and carefully
discuss our findings including the limitations of the evidence.
Caroline Struthers is concerned “that most or all of the authors of this review practice and teach acupuncture”. First, at least two of the
authors (A Vickers, a statistician, and K Linde, a clinical epidemiologist) have never practiced acupuncture. Second, only one of the
authors (G Allais) actually teaches the practice of acupuncture, but he is also a headache specialist and head of a University Headache
Center in which all types of pharmacological approaches to headache treatment are regularly used. Third, reporting the results of
research at acupuncture meetings is not “teaching acupuncture”. Systematic reviews of any treatment involve both methodologists
and context experts. We think it is a distinct strength that we included epidemiologists, a trial statistician, acupuncture experts who
published high-quality acupuncture trials, and acupuncturists using this treatment clinically. Our review is no different from a review
of surgery, where there might be some statisticians and some surgeons.
Editor note, added 10 August 2016: Please note that author ‘employment in a clinical speciality relevant to the Cochrane Review
should be declared in the interests of transparency, but this does not prevent an individual from being a review author, including taking
on the role of lead (first) author.’ (see http://community.cochrane.org/editorial-and-publishing-policy-resource/ethical-considerations/
conflicts-interest-and-cochrane-reviews).

I read with interest the recent review by Linde et al. entitled “Acupuncture for the prevention of tension - type headache.” However I
number of concerns regarding the data as it is presented in the paper.
Having manually re-read the paper by Endres et al. that is cited in the paper I notice some discrepancies between the published data
and the data included in this meta-analysis.
In the original paper Endres provides the following data for >50% reduction in headache days.
At 6 weeks 138/204 vs. 106/191, at 3 months 119/199 vs. 91/192, 135/204 vs. 106/194.
This data is different than the data provided by Linde et al. in their paper and may serve to conflate the effect size.
On another matter, I do not believe it is appropriate to perform a fixed effects meta-analysis in this setting. Regardless of what the I-
square statistic is, given the differences in study designs and patient populations, a random effects meta-analysis would have been more
appropriate and I believe it should included in the analysis.
Reply
Christopher Labos is correct in noting that the response data in the Endres et al. [1] paper are slightly different from those used in our
meta-analyses. There are two reasons for this:
1. As described in our method section (page 7) we use as response criterion ≥ 50 reduction of headache frequency as recommended
in the guidelines of International Headache Society for controlled trials in tension-type headache ([2], page 11). Endres et al. used the
slightly different criterion of >50% for their original analyses. As we had access to the individual patient data of the Endres trial
through the Acupuncture Trialists’ Collaboration (see page 6 in our review) we re-calculated response data to keep the analysis
approach across trials as similar as possible. We believe this is more than reasonable;
2. Throughout the review we used the number of patients randomized to a group as denominator to calculate the percentage of
responders counting patients with missing data as non-responders.
Using the data originally reported by Endres et al. for meta-analysis for calculating pooled risk ratios results in similar effects sizes (1.22
at up to 8 weeks, 1.20 at up to 4 months and 1.18 at up to 6 months) as in our calculations (1.26, 1.27 and 1.17, respectively).
There is debate among statisticians whether fixed or random effect models should be preferred. Clearly, the fixed effect meta-analysis is
a valid test of the null hypothesis of no effect. Furthermore, in five of six meta-analyses presented in our review I² was 0. In these cases
point estimates and confidence intervals are identical in random and fixed effects models. Only in the meta-analysis of response up to
8 week I² was 16%. Using a random effects model results in the same point estimate as in the4 fixed effects model with slightly wider
confidence intervals (1.26 [1.10, 1.45]).

7 November 2008
New citation required and conclusions have changed
1) A previously published Cochrane review on
’Acupuncture for idiopathic headache’ has been split
into two reviews: the present review on ’Acupuncture
for tension-type headache’ and a separate review on
’Acupuncture for migraine prophylaxis’
2) Six new trials of acupuncture for tension-type
headache are included in the present review (Endres
2007; Jena 2008; Karst 2001; Melchart 2005;
Söderberg 2006; White 2000).
3) Conclusions have changed as follows: In the previ-
ous version of this review, the evidence in support of
acupuncture for tension-type headache was considered
insufficient. Now the authors conclude that acupunc-
ture might be considered as a treatment option for fre-
quent episodic or chronic tension-type headache, al-
though the selectionof specificacupuncture pointsmay
not be as important as has been thought by providers
4) The list of review authors has been slightly amended
vis-à-vis the earlier review (D Melchart and B Berman
no longer authors; E Manheimer added as new author)

This review includes trials in which some of the review authors were involved: Jena 2008 - Benno Brinkhaus; Melchart 2005 - Benno
Brinkhaus and Klaus Linde; White 1996 and White 2000 - Adrian White. These trials were reviewed by at least two other members
of the review team.
Gianni Allais, Benno Brinkhaus, Yutong Fei, Byung-Cheul Shin, Michael Mehring and Adrian White use acupuncture in their clinical
work.
Within the last three years (January 2013 to December 2015): Gianni Allais received fees for teaching acupuncture in private schools;
Klaus Linde once received a fee from the German Medical Acupuncture Society for speaking about research at a conference; Benno
Brinkhaus has received fees for presenting research findings at meetings of acupuncture societies in various countries; Adrian White is
employed by the British Medical Acupuncture Society as a journal editor and has received fees for lecturing on acupuncture on several
occasions.
Andrew Vickers’ contribution to this review was supported by the NIH grant R01AT006794 (see Sources of support).
We believe that none of the statements above constitute a potential conflict of interest in relation to this review.

For this 2016 update we made a number of changes to the protocol/previous versions.
To make it more clear that this review does not address the treatment of acute headaches we changed the title from ’Acupuncture for
tension-type headache’ to ’Acupuncture for the prevention of tension-type headache’.
We defined the selection criteria in more detail: we have added the criterion regarding disease duration to the description of the
participants section to better comply with common diagnostic standards.
Changes to the ’Types of interventions’ section: 1) we added a minimum number of six acupuncture sessions, given at least once per
week, for inclusion to warrant that participants received an adequate minimum dose of treatment; and 2) we limited eligible other
active treatments to pharmacological treatment, cognitive and physical treatment to sharpen the focus of the review.
Acceptable outcome measures are now more explicitly defined and we also assessed adverse events in line with current Cochrane policy.
Based on the recommendation of the statistician in our team (AV), we now use fixed-effect models for calculating pooled estimates.
This is primarily because the fixed-effect analysis constitutes a valid test of the null hypothesis.
We have added judgements of the overall quality of evidence according to the GRADE approach for key outcomes.
N O T E S
A new search is not likely to identify any potentially relevant studies likely to change the conclusions. Therefore, this review has now
been stabilised following discussion with the authors and editors. The review will be re-assessed for updating in ten years.
