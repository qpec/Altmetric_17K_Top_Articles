statin therapy is associated with a modest increase in the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (about one per thousand
patient-years), generally defined by laboratory findings (glycated haemoglobin >
_6.5); this risk is significantly higher in the
metabolic syndrome or prediabetes. Statin treatment does not adversely affect cognitive function, even at very low levels
of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and is not associated with clinically significant deterioration of renal function, or
development of cataract. Transient increases in liver enzymes occur in 0.5–2% of patients taking statins but are not clini-
cally relevant; idiosyncratic liver injury due to statins is very rare and causality difficult to prove. The evidence base does
not support an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke in individuals without cerebrovascular disease; a small increase in
risk was suggested by the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction of Cholesterol Levels study in subjects with prior
stroke but has not been confirmed in the substantive evidence base of RCTs, cohort studies and case–control studies.

Conclusion
Long-term statin treatment is remarkably safe with a low risk of clinically relevant adverse effects as defined above;
statin-associated muscle symptoms were discussed in a previous Consensus Statement. Importantly, the established
cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy far outweigh the risk of adverse effects.

Introduction
Statins [3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-
CoA) inhibitors] are recommended as the treatment of first choice
for management of hypercholesterolaemia and combined hyperlipi-
daemia by European guidelines for cardiovascular disease (CVD) pre-
vention and lipid management.1,2 The efficacy of these agents in
decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), a causal fac-
tor in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,
and in preventing both first and recurrent cardiovascular events (with
or without type 2 diabetes), is indisputable.2–4
Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have clearly established
the benefit/risk ratio of this treatment.4,5 Since several trials are evalu-
ating the effects of a statin-containing polypill on modifiable risk fac-
tors,6 the use of statins is likely to expand into a wider cross-section
of the population. Consequently, critical appraisal of evidence relating
to possible unintended effects of long-term statin therapy is needed,
on the one hand to accurately assess their incidence, and on the
other, to place often exaggerated perceptions of side effects among
patients, the general public and some healthcare providers, in their
correct perspective.
Data from RCTs provide reliable information on the safety of statin
therapy, but this information relates to the specific patient populations
which fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were treated for a relatively
short duration, typically less than 5years. Less frequent adverse effects
of treatment may only emerge after long-term exposure in very large
numbers of patients. For example, while single studies were contradic-
tory with respect to the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM),7,8
meta-analyses and large data bases provided clear evidence, especially
in susceptible individuals with the risk factor cluster of the metabolic
syndrome who may already be in a pre-diabetic state.9
It remains to be seen if the pharmacology of different statins
(Table 1) is relevant to the issue of statin side effects.10 Indeed, the
metabolism of statins is distinct. For example, genetic differences in
the activity of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system can affect statin
interactions with other drugs, whereas genetic differences in mem-
brane transporters can alter first pass hepatic uptake, a major
determinant of residual circulating concentrations and ultimately of
peripheral tissue exposure.11 The issues described above highlight
the critical need for an objective appraisal of adverse effects attrib-
uted to statins in order to differentiate the perception from the real-
ity of the potential risks associated with statin therapy, specifically on
glucose homeostasis, and cognitive, renal and hepatic function, as
well as the risk for haemorrhagic stroke and cataract. This appraisal
will provide important evidence-based information not only for
patients, clinicians and the wider spectrum of healthcare professio-
nals, but also for public health policy makers.
Statin-associated muscle symptoms
Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS, the focus of a separate
Consensus Statement)12 are the predominant adverse effect encoun-
tered in clinical practice (Figure 1), and impact adherence and ulti-
mately clinical outcomes (Box 1).13,14 A much-debated issue is
whether SAMS represent real or nocebo effects. A nocebo effect is
caused by negative expectations about the effects of treatment, aris-
ing from information provided by clinicians and/or the media about
possible side effects, which lead to higher reporting rates for adverse
effects of the treatment than would otherwise be expected.12,15,16
The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial—Lipid-Lowering
Arm (ASCOT-LLA) Study Group addressed this issue by comparing
the incidence of four different types of adverse events with statin
therapy, including muscle-related symptoms, during both the blinded,
placebo-controlled trial and its open-label extension study. They con-
cluded that a nocebo effect may explain the higher incidence of SAMS
in observational studies vs. RCTs,17 although others have noted that
the overall rate of muscle-related events decreased from 2.03% in the
blinded phase to 1.26% when subjects were aware that they were on
a statin. Perhaps the take home message for clinicians is that they
should be cautious about prematurely attributing muscle symptoms
to statin therapy, without further investigation of their cause.

Effects on glucose homeostasis
Statin therapy is known to be associated with a small increment in
fasting blood glucose levels.2 In a meta-analysis of 13 RCTs involving
91 140 subjects without diabetes at baseline, statin treatment
increased incident DM by �9%, representing one additional case of

diabetes (12.23 cases with statin vs. 11.25 cases with control) per
1000 patients per year of exposure, but also prevented five first CVD
events. This is, however, an underestimate as multiple recurrent
events were not considered.9 Another meta-analysis including
�40000 patients with stable coronary heart disease or recent acute
coronary syndrome in five RCTs showed that high intensity statin
therapy increased the risk of incident DM by 12%, but also reduced
the risk of CVD events by 16%, or in absolute terms, prevented 3.5
CVD events for each additional case of diabetes.18 In this analysis, a
‘case of diabetes’ was defined by serum glycated haemoglobin
(HbA1c) >6.5, a laboratory finding that has no immediate impact on
the quality of life, and therefore should not be compared with out-
comes such as stroke or death from myocardial infarction.
The risk of incident DM with statin treatment increases with an
increasing number of components of the metabolic syndrome, as
shown by post hoc analyses of the Justification for the Use of Statins in
Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER),
Treating to New Targets (TNT), Incremental Decrease in End Points
Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering (IDEAL), and Stroke Prevention
by Aggressive Reduction of Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trials, espe-
cially in individuals with the highest fasting blood glucose levels at ini-
tiation of statin therapy; this effect may be substantially higher in
women than men.8,19–21 In the Metabolic Syndrome in Men
(METSIM) cohort in 8749 men (2142 on a statin) aged 45–73 years
with features of the metabolic syndrome but without a diabetes diag-
nosis, intense statin treatment was associated with a 46% increase in
incident DM (11.2% vs. 5.8% in those not on a statin, P < 0.001) over
5.9 years follow-up, representing 10 new cases per 1000 patients per
year of exposure.22 These individuals were older, more obese, less
physically active, and exhibited lower levels of high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol (HDL-C) and higher triglycerides, fasting blood glu-
cose and HbA1c.22 To put these findings in context, the rate of
conversion to DM in subjects with confirmed impaired glucose toler-
ance not on a statin was 110 per 1000 subjects per year of exposure
in the Diabetes Prevention Program,23 and 200 per 1000 Japanese
participants per year of exposure in the J-PREDICT trial (Odawara M,
Late Breaking Studies, American Diabetes Association Congress, 2013).
Among such high risk patients who developed new- onset DM, the
risk of CVD events was lower on statin therapy supporting the
notion that, at least within the time scale of these trials, potential
adverse effects of hyperglycaemia do not negate the benefits of LDL-
C reduction.8,24 Furthermore, observational data show that patients
who developed DM while receiving a statin not only had a lower rate
of macrovascular disease but also microvascular disease complica-
tions normally linked to diabetes.25 Thus, the net benefit among high
risk patients in need of statins favours their use, consistent with the
Joint Task Force guidelines recommendations.1,2,4,5 These data are
consistent with findings among patients with DM treated with statins
who derive a similar relative risk (RR) reduction per unit reduction in
LDL-C but a greater absolute benefit.4,26
Determining whether the effect of statins on DM risk is an on-
target (i.e. inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase) or off-target action will
help in understanding whether the effect of a statin on glucose
metabolism is a drug or drug class effect. Mechanistically, statins could
increase blood glucose by increasing insulin resistance, possibly medi-
ated by changes in circulating free fatty acids,27 impairing beta- cell
function, or alternative mechanisms, or a combination of these
(Figure 2).28 Indeed, a meta-analysis of new-onset DM and weight
change data from up to 20 major RCTs (n = 129 170) also showed
that patients who received a statin gained on average 0.24 kg com-
pared with control at study close.29 This overall question was clarified
by a Mendelian randomization study in �200000 individuals, in which
the associations between common genetic variants (rs17238484 and
rs12916) of the HMGCR gene, the target of statins, and body weight,
body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, plasma insulin and glu-
cose, and DM risk were evaluated.29 These two variants were not
only associated with lower LDL-C at a genome wide level of signifi-
cance, but also a small increase in the risk of DM, and higher blood
glucose, insulin levels, body weight, waist circumference and BMI
(Table 2).29–34 Other meta-analyses of genome-wide association
studies of BMI30 and plasma insulin31 revealed directionally concord-
ant associations of the same variants (or suitable proxies) with both
these traits, although associations of both variants with fasting insulin
were not statistically significant after adjustment for BMI. Long-term
follow-up from the METSIM cohort showed that the increased DM
risk with statin therapy was attributable to decreases in insulin sensi-
tivity and insulin secretion,21 although recent reports associated the
gut microbiota and the metabolomic profile with these metabolic
traits, as well as the effects of statin treatment on such traits.32,33
Alternatively, this effect on glucose homeostasis may be a class
effect of statins mediated via LDL. Three large genetic studies which
assessed life-long exposure to lower LDL-C levels due to carriage of
genetic variants of other LDL-lowering drug targets, namely
PCSK934,35 and NPC1L1,36 showed an increased risk of DM but only
Box 1
Key points about SAMS for clinicians
• What are SAMS? Muscle pain, weakness and aches, usually symmetrical and proximal, affecting the thighs, buttocks, calves and back muscles. Not
normally associated with marked creatine kinase (CK) elevation.
• When do SAMS occur? Tend to occur early (within 4–6 weeks of starting a statin), after an increase in statin dose, or with initiation of an interacting
drug.
• Who is at risk of SAMS? The very elderly (>80 years), notably female, or with low body mass index or of Asian descent, with a history of muscle dis-
orders, or concurrent conditions (e.g. acute infection, impaired renal or hepatic function, diabetes, HIV) or concomitant interacting medications.
• How did the EAS Consensus Panel define SAMS? By the nature of muscle symptoms, and their temporal association with statin initiation, discon-
tinuation, and response to repetitive statin re-challenge.
• What determines management of SAMS? The magnitude of CK elevation, and the patient’s global cardiovascular risk.

in those individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. Whilst this pre-
dicted increased risk has not been observed so far at very low LDL-C
levels attained with add-on treatment with a PCSK9 (proprotein con-
vertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor,37,38 or ezetimibe,39 pro-
longed drug exposure particularly among those more at risk of
developing diabetes may be required to observe an effect. It is also
noteworthy that a reduced incidence of diabetes has been observed
in individuals with causative LDLR mutations for familial hypercholes-
terolaemia.40 On the other hand, causative APOB mutations for fami-
lial hypercholesterolaemia were not associated with diabetes.41
Clearly, the relationship of circulating LDL to predisposition to diabe-
tes is unresolved, as highlighted by the Randomized EValuation of the
Effects of Anacetrapib Through Lipid-modification (REVEAL) trial
with the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor, anacetrapib, in
which a lower risk of diabetes was observed despite an additional
17% reduction in LDL-C on top of background statin treatment with
�100 000 person years of exposure.42
Thus, evidence suggests that statins affect glucose homeostasis and
are associated with a small risk of incident DM. Caution is needed,
however, as studies have generally not included glucose tolerance
testing, the gold standard for the diagnosis of diabetes, before and
after statin treatment. Moreover, while this effect has been thought
to be a drug class effect, recent insights suggest that this may not be
the case.43–45 Both pravastatin and pitavastatin have been recognized
as neutral for effects on glycaemic parameters in patients with and
without DM, as reflected by regulatory labelling.46,47 In the absence
of head-to-head studies, definitive statements as to whether any of
the statins differ in their effect on glycaemia are not possible.
Take home messages
• Concordant evidence from RCTs and genetic studies indicate that
statin treatment is associated with a modest increase in the risk of
new-onset DM of approximately one case per 1000 patients per
year of exposure but also prevents five new CVD events.
• People with features of the metabolic syndrome or prediabetes
are at significantly greater risk of this adverse effect, although con-
version to DM without statin is also higher.
• In most studies diagnosis of ‘DM’ was based on a laboratory find-
ing of an HbA1c >6.5 without symptoms; the relevance of this
HbA1c based conversion to diabetes for long-term morbidity and
mortality will require long-term follow-up.
• Patients should be reassured that the benefits of statins in prevent-
ing CVD events far outweigh the potential risk from elevation in
plasma glucose, especially in individuals with increased HbA1c.
Cognitive function
Whether statin treatment has a possible effect on cognitive function
is an important issue, especially with the pandemic of dyslipidaemia
associated with diabetes and insulin resistance on the one hand, and
changing demographic patterns affecting the prevalence of dementia
on the other. Epidemiological studies have documented an associa-
tion between high cholesterol levels and increased risk of

Alzheimer’s disease,48,49 leading some to suggest that improved vas-
cular function with statin treatment could be beneficial in the context
of several pathologies that cause dementia.50 On the other hand, it
has been suggested that reduction in cholesterol levels with statin
therapy may be potentially detrimental for cognitive function.51 Yet
the view that statins directly affect the brain is simplistic, given the
brain-blood barrier and the fact that the brain is largely self-sufficient
with respect to endogenous cholesterol synthesis.52
The variable quality of data pertaining to this question is also prob-
lematic. Most clinical trials rely on patient self-report of neurological
symptoms such as memory impairment, but have not incorporated
rigorous objective testing for cognitive function. Furthermore, the
study populations were at low risk for cognitive decline and the study
duration may not have been sufficient to observe a cognitive effect. In
the post-marketing setting, case reports and observational studies
predominate (Table 3).39,53–60 Additionally, whether factors present
in midlife that are known to be associated with impaired physical
function in the longer-term, equally impact cognitive function is often
overlooked.61–64
In a review of published literature, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) concluded that there was no evidence that sta-
tins increase the incidence of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or
decline in cognitive performance.54 Despite this, the labelling for sta-
tins was amended to include cognitive side effects such as memory
loss and confusion, although the FDA emphasized that the cardiovas-
cular benefits of statins outweighed these possible effects.54 Similar
conclusions were reported in an updated review.55 These findings
are supported by data from prospective studies. The Heart
Protection Study used the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status
at final follow-up to assess cognitive performance, and showed no dif-
ferences between simvastatin and placebo groups for the proportion
of patients classified as cognitively impaired, either overall or by base-
line age subgroups.65 Additionally, in the Pravastatin in elderly individ-
uals at risk of vascular disease (PROSPER) study, which assessed
cognitive function at six different time points during the study using
four neuropsychological performance tests, there was no difference
in cognitive decline between pravastatin and placebo groups over a
mean follow-up of 42months.66

Subsequent
analyses
have
also
addressed
this
question.
Prospective observational data analysis (>57 000 subjects fol-
lowed for a median of 4 years) showed that statin use was associ-
ated with a lower risk of dementia [RR 0.62, 95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.43–0.81; P = 0.001].53 A meta-analysis of more than
46 000 patients in 25 RCTs (23 with cognitive testing), did not
identify any significant negative effect of statins on cognitive func-
tion, both for cognitively normal subjects or those with
Alzheimer’s disease.57 Added to this, a Cochrane review of four
trials
including
1154
patients
with
probable
or
possible
Alzheimer’s disease found no significant differences in the
Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale—cognitive subscale and
the Minimal Mental State Examination between patients treated
with statin or placebo,56 implying that statins do not delay cogni-
tive deterioration in patients with known dementia. While transi-
ent global amnesia has been linked with statin use in case
reports,67 there is no evidence to support causality from the total-
ity of evidence to date.
Another question is whether there is any risk of adverse effects on
cognitive function with the very low LDL-C levels attained with the
combination of a statin and ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor. A prespe-
cified analysis of the [Examining Outcomes in Subjects With Acute
Coronary Syndrome: Vytorin (Ezetimibe/Simvastatin) vs. Simvastatin]
IMPROVE-IT trial showed no increase in neurocognitive adverse
events with ezetimibe compared with placebo when associated with
exposure to LDL-C levels <0.78 mmol/L (<30mg/dL) for up to
6 years.39 Data from the Open-Label Study of Long-term Evaluation
Against LDL-C (OSLER) trial involving treatment with evolocumab
for up to 4 years, and a pooled analysis of studies of alirocumab treat-
ment for up to 2 years, add further support.68,69 Even at the very low
LDL-C levels (<0.5 mmol/L or <20 mg/dL) attained with evolocumab
plus moderate or high intensity statin therapy in the Further
Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With PCSK9 Inhibition in
Subjects With Elevated Risk (FOURIER) trial, there was no increase
in neurocognitive adverse events compared with placebo (statin
alone).58
The Evaluating PCSK9 Binding antiBody Influence oN coGnitive
HeAlth in high cardiovascUlar risk Subjects (EBBINGHAUS) study59
assessed the effect of very low LDL-C levels on cognitive function in
a subset of 1204 patients who were enrolled in the FOURIER trial
over a mean follow-up of 1.8years. This study used the Cambridge
Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB, http://
www.cambridgecognition.com), a computerized assessment tool
that is specifically designed to assess cognitive function across a range
of domains, including episodic and working memory, executive func-
tion, psychomotor speed, and attention. Assessment is independent
of nuances in language and culture, and therefore suitable for applica-
tion in large multinational clinical studies. Even at very low LDL-C lev-
els [interquartile range 0.28–0.44 mmol/L (11–17 mg/dL) for the
lowest LDL-C subgroup] attained with the addition of evolocumab
to moderate to high intensity statin therapy in some patients in the
FOURIER trial, there was no change in cognitive function over the
trial. Indeed, as reported by the authors, the changes seen over time
in each group were an order of magnitude less than the changes
found in patients with mild cognitive impairment preceding
dementia.70
Finally, in a Mendelian randomization study involving 111194 indi-
viduals from the Danish general population, the Copenhagen
General Population Study and the Copenhagen City Heart Study,
low LDL-C levels associated with PCSK9 and HMGCR variants had no
causal effect on the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia,
any dementia, or Parkinson’s disease (Table 3).60 Summary level data
from the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project on risk of
Alzheimer’s disease for variants of PCSK9, HMGCR, or other variants
associated with LDL-C lowering supported the same conclusion.60
Take home messages
• Statin treatment does not adversely affect cognitive function.
• At very low LDL-C levels attained with the combination of statin
plus ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor, there was no signal for any
adverse effect on cognitive function.
• Mendelian randomization analyses support the finding that low
LDL-C levels, due to PCSK9 and HMGCR variants mimicking
PCSK9 inhibitors and statins, had no causal effect on the risk of
Alzheimer’s
disease,
vascular
dementia,
any
dementia,
or
Parkinson’s disease.
Effects on renal function
With the exception of the hydrophilic statins pravastatin and rosuvas-
tatin, statins are metabolized by the liver and cleared minimally by the
kidney. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)
guideline has provided recommendations for lipid management in
chronic kidney disease (CKD).71 Dose reduction based on estimated
glomerular filtration rate may be prudent in patients with severe kid-
ney dysfunction who are receiving intensive statin regimens.71
While few studies have been performed in CKD patients, recent
meta-analyses indicate that statin treatment reduces CVD risk in
patients with CKD, especially those with mild kidney disease.72–75
There was, however, no clear benefit in patients on dialysis.72,76–78
Given that statins reduce CVD events by 20% in CKD,79 this has
prompted guidelines to recommend statin therapy in CKD patients
except those on dialysis.71,75
Mild proteinuria, often transient, is seen at low frequency with high
dose statin treatment but is not associated with impaired renal func-
tion (as reviewed previously80,81). This may be caused by reduced
tubular reabsorption of albumin, related to inhibition of HMG-CoA
reductase and reduced prenylation of proteins involved in endocyto-
sis.82,83 A potential concern, however, is whether high dose statin
therapy increases the risk of acute kidney disease.84–86 One retro-
spective analysis involving more than two million statin users (59 636
with CKD) newly treated with a statin between 1997 and 2008,
reported a 34% higher RR of acute renal injury within 120days of ini-
tiation of high vs. moderate intensity statin treatment, although this
was attenuated with prolonged statin exposure. This was not seen in
patients with CKD.84 While this retrospective analysis may raise con-
cerns, data from RCTs have not shown any increase in risk. A meta-
analysis of 24 RCTs involving 15 000 patient years exposure reported
no change in the risk of acute renal impairment, and no increase in
serious adverse renal events during statin treatment.87 Furthermore,
in a number of meta-analyses that have focused on CKD patients,
there was no increase in progression of CKD or acute renal events
on statin therapy.75,88,89 Indeed, it has been suggested that statins

of CKD,88–94 although no such benefit on renal function was evident
in other studies.75,79,95

• Statin treatment is not associated with clinically significant deterio-
ration of renal function.
• Dose reduction based on estimated glomerular filtration rate may
be prudent in patients with severe kidney dysfunction who are
receiving intensive statin regimens.
• A protective effect of statins on the kidney cannot be excluded
but further study is merited.
Effects on hepatic function
It is difficult to determine the role of statins in the extremely rare
cases of severe liver injury associated with statins. Drug-induced liver
injury (DILI) is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure and the
need for liver transplantation in Western countries.96 The most com-
mon biomarkers for DILI are alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspar-
tate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT),
serum
total
bilirubin
and
alkaline
phosphatase
(ALP).97,98
Hepatocellular injury is generally detected by elevations in serum
ALT or AST, elevated ALP marks injury to cells in the bile excretory
ducts, and elevated serum total or conjugated bilirubin is indicative of
reduced excretory function of the liver.96 In most cases, DILI is rare,
idiosyncratic and unpredictable. Moreover, estimating the frequency
of DILI is challenging due to potential genetic, epigenetic, environ-
mental and clinical factors that may confound accurate diagnosis.
Liver-mediated drug metabolism and transport have also been impli-
cated in mechanisms underlying DILI (Figure 3).99,100 These interact-
ing factors plus the rarity of severe liver toxicity associated with
statins, contribute to the difficulty in assessing the role of statins
in DILI.
Elevation in liver enzymes
Mild elevation in liver transaminases occurs in 0.5–2.0% of patients
on any statin, usually within 3 months of initiation of therapy. This
may not differ significantly from placebo, and in isolation, is unlikely to
be clinically relevant.1,2,101 A systematic meta-analysis of 135 RCTs
involving more than 246000 patients reported that statins as a class
produced �50% higher risk of transaminase elevation compared
with control or placebo. There was a clear dose–response relation-
ship for atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin. These elevations
were transient, and usually normalized with continuing therapy.102
Clinically relevant ALT elevations are rare. An analysis of 49 trials
involving more than 14 000 patients, reported persistent elevations in
hepatic transaminases [>3� upper limit of normal (ULN)] in 0.1%,
0.6%, and 0.2% of patients on atorvastatin 10mg, atorvastatin 80mg,
and placebo (Table 4).103
In patients with mild ALT elevation due to steatosis or non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not result in wor-
sening of liver disease,106 although caution may be needed in
patients with pre-existing primary biliary cirrhosis.107 Moreover,
the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy are likely to outweigh
any potential safety issues, as highlighted by the Joint Task Force
guidelines.1,2,108 Indeed, an updated meta-analysis in more than
120 000 patients with chronic liver disease showed that statin use

was associated with a lower risk of hepatic decompensation and
mortality, and possibly reduced portal hypertension.109 Statins
should not be prescribed, however, in patients with active hepati-
tis B virus infection until serum levels of AST, ALT, GGT, total
bilirubin, and ALP have normalized.110

moderate to severe hepatotoxicity (bilirubin >60 lmol/L, AST or
ALT >200 U/L, or ALP >1200 U/L) was reported in 0.09% (71/
76 411) patients on atorvastatin vs. 0.06% (101/164 407) on
simvastatin (hazard ratio for atorvastatin 1.9, 95% CI 1.4–2.6;
P < 0.001). Reporting rates were higher at higher doses (40–
80 mg/day) (0.44% on atorvastatin and 0.09% on simvastatin).105
Data from the Swedish Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory
Committee (1998–2010),104 reported that 1.2 per 100 000
patients had DILI (defined as transaminase elevation >5� ULN
and/or ALP >2� ULN) on statin therapy. A similar pattern of liver
injury was produced on re-exposure after recovery. Despite
increasing statin prescription since the late 1990s, however, the
FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database did not identify
any increase in the rates of fatal or severe liver injury cases caused
by statin use.97 Reports of statin-associated serious liver injury
were extremely low (<
_2 per one million patient-years). There
were 75 reports of severe liver injury, including requirement for
liver transplant (n = 11) or death (n = 37), of which 30 (14 deaths,

Conclusion
2006103
Retrospective pooled analysis of 49 trials
(n = 14 236); patients were treated with
atorvastatin (10 mg or 80 mg) or placebo
• 0.1%, 0.6%, and 0.2% of patients in the atorvastatin
10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo groups had
clinically relevant ALT elevation (>
_3� ULN on two
occasions)
Clinically relevant transami-
nase elevation with statin
therapy is rare; higher
doses are associated with
a higher risk of transami-
nase elevation

Network meta-analysis of 135 RCTs
(n = 246 955)
• Statin treatment was associated with �50% higher risk
of transaminase elevation (odds ratio 1.51, 95% CI
1.24–1.84) compared with control; however, the fre-
quency of clinically significant transaminase elevation
associated with statin therapy was low
• Higher doses of statins were associated with higher
odds of transaminase elevation

Swedish Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory
Committee (1998–2010)
Only cases with transaminase elevation >5� ULN and/or
ALP elevation >2� ULN were included
• Statin-induced liver injury was reported for 1.2 per

7 liver transplantations, and 9 cases of severe liver injury) were
assessed as possibly or probably associated with statin therapy.
No cases were assessed as highly likely or definitely associated
with statin therapy (Table 4).97 A recent update from the US
National Lipid Association’s Statin Liver Safety Task Force con-
cluded that recorded hepatotoxicity due to statins remains a very
rare event.113
Clinically apparent liver injury is likely to be a class effect of statins
occurring any time after initiation of statin treatment.114,115
Autoimmune hepatitis is perhaps the most common phenotype for
DILI of statin-induced hepatotoxicity. Statins may trigger idiopathic
inflammatory myositis or immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy,12
with antibodies against HMG-CoA reductase. Similar mechanisms
could contribute to a statin-associated autoimmune hepatitis.
Monitoring liver enzyme elevation
Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes during statin therapy is
not supported by current evidence, and is thus not recommended in
asymptomatic patients.1,2,116 Indeed, routine periodic monitoring
could identify patients with isolated increased ALT, AST, or GGT lev-
els, and prompt physicians to reduce or discontinue statin therapy,
thereby placing patients at increased risk for CVD events. It is, how-
ever, reasonable to measure hepatic function if symptoms suggestive
of hepatotoxicity arise (e.g. unusual fatigue or weakness, loss of appe-
tite, abdominal pain, dark-coloured urine, or yellowing of the skin or
sclera). If the patient develops ALT levels >3� ULN (or lower when
combined with a new increase in bilirubin levels), the statin should be
discontinued. Other potential aetiologies should be considered
before assuming that the elevated liver enzymes are due to the statin.
Take home messages
• Mild ALT elevation in isolation in asymptomatic statin users is not
clinically relevant. In patients with mild ALT elevation due to stea-
tosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, statin therapy does not
worsen liver disease.
• Clinically apparent liver injury with statin therapy is very rare and
likely to be a class effect of statins.
• Routine periodic monitoring of liver enzymes is not justified.
• Liver enzymes should be measured in the rare patient who devel-
ops symptoms suggestive of hepatotoxicity.
Haemorrhagic stroke
There is substantive evidence from RCTs that statin treatment
reduces the risk of ischaemic stroke by 26% (99% CI 15–35%) per
mmol/L reduction in LDL-C.117 While this benefit on ischaemic
stroke is established, lower LDL-C levels have been associated with
an increase in haemorrhagic stroke in the general population.118 The
possibility that statins increase the risk of haemorrhagic stroke was
suggested by a meta-analysis of over 8000 patients with a history of
cerebrovascular events, which showed a higher risk of haemorrhagic
stroke events (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.19–2.50).119 These results were
mainly driven by the SPARCL trial, which evaluated atorvastatin
80mg/day in patients with a prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack
and with LDL-C levels of 2.6–4.9 mmol/L (100–190mg/dL).120
Atorvastatin reduced ischaemic stroke in SPARCL (218 events with
atorvastatin vs. 274 with placebo), but produced a numerically higher
number of haemorrhagic strokes (55 vs. 33). This event was more
frequent in older individuals, men, or those with prior haemorrhagic
stroke.121A meta-analysis of eight RCTs (38 153 patients on statin
therapy), showed a trend between attained LDL-C level and risk for
haemorrhagic stroke, although the absolute number of haemorrhagic
strokes was low.122
A subsequent meta-analysis including 248 391 patients, however,
found no significant increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage
based on data from RCTs (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.86–1.41), cohort stud-
ies (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.81–1.10), and case–control studies (RR 0.60,
95% CI 0.41–0.88).123 A further meta-analysis of these patients found
no association between the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage and
the magnitude of LDL-C reduction.124 Moreover, even at very low
attained LDL-C levels in FOURIER, there was no increase in the risk
of haemorrhagic stroke.58
Take home messages
• Statin treatment reduces the risk of first or subsequent ischaemic
strokes by 15–35% per mmol/L reduction in LDL-C.
• While SPARCL suggested a small increase in haemorrhagic stroke
in subjects with prior stoke, this possible increased risk associated
with LDL-C reduction has not been confirmed by analysis of a
substantive evidence base of RCTs, cohort studies, and case–con-
trol studies.
• No alteration in the statin regimen in patients with a history of
cerebrovascular disease is indicated.
Cataract
Age-related lens opacity (cataract) is the main cause of vision loss in
the older population. Whether statin use exacerbates this risk has
been a potential concern. Investigation of this question, however, has
been hampered by methodological issues such as the lack of standar-
dized definition of cataract as an outcome,125 as well as failure to
account for the impact of statin adherence and the frequency of oph-
thalmological check-ups.
Observational data and limited preclinical studies suggested a pos-
sible link between cataract and statin use.126,127 A propensity score-
matched analysis of a US administrative dataset of 46249 subjects,
including 13262 statin users, showed that the risk of cataract was
slightly higher (by 9%) with statin treatment.128 In addition, both the
Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE)-3 study and a retro-
spective nested case–control study showed an increase in risk for
cataract surgery with statin use.129,130
On the other hand, evidence from RCTs provides reassurance on
this question. In the Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin
(EXCEL) study in 8032 patients randomized to lovastatin (40 mg or
20 mg once or twice daily) or placebo, there were no significant dif-
ferences in ocular opacities, visual acuity, or cataract extraction over
a follow-up of 48weeks.131 The Oxford Cholesterol Study Group
trial in 539 patients randomized to simvastatin (40 mg or 20mg daily)
or placebo also showed no differences in visual outcomes or cataract
grading after 18months of treatment.132 Similarly, the Simvastatin
and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) study in 1873 patients with
asymptomatic aortic stenosis and no history of diabetes, coronary
heart disease, or other serious co-morbidities (average follow-up of
4.3years) found that the risk of cataract was significantly lower with

the use of simvastatin and ezetimibe compared to placebo (hazard
ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.33–0.96).133 A subsequent meta-analysis of
313 200 patients in cohort trials (n = 6, follow-up duration of up to
5 years), case–control studies (n = 6, follow-up duration of up to
5 years), and RCTs (n = 5, follow-up duration 0.9–5.4years) did not
show any association between statin use and the development of cat-
aracts.134 Mechanistically, it has been suggested that the antioxidant
and anti-inflammatory effects of statins could slow the development
of cataracts,135,136 although further study is needed.
Take home messages
• Statin treatment is not associated with cataract development.
• No change in cardiovascular prevention strategies are indicated,
even in patients with cataracts.
Conclusion
Public perception of the adverse effects of statins is often exagger-
ated, in part as a consequence of media reports.13,15 While statins
generally have an acceptable safety profile,2 questions have been
raised regarding possible unintended effects on glucose homeostasis,
and cognitive, renal, and hepatic function, as well as the risk for hae-
morrhagic stroke or cataract. This Consensus Panel Statement there-
fore addressed these persistent uncertainties.
We conclude that statin treatment is remarkably safe. While there
is a modest risk (about one new case per 1000 patients per year of
exposure) of new onset DM with long-term statin treatment, this
comes with the benefit of five new CVD events avoided. Patients
with the metabolic syndrome or prediabetes are at higher risk of
DM. In the absence of head-to-head studies, however, definitive
statements as to whether any of the statins differ in their effect on
glucose homeostasis are not possible. Statin use is not associated
with adverse effects on cognitive function or clinically significant dete-
rioration of renal function and does not increase the risk of cataract
or haemorrhagic stroke in individuals without prior stroke, although
the SPARCL data suggested statins may possibly increase the risk of
haemorrhagic stroke in those with prior stroke. Clinical liver injury
with statin therapy is very rare.
Finally, clinicians should be reassured by the long-term safety of
statins, and the low risk of clinically relevant adverse effects, as dis-
cussed above. Importantly, and reinforcing recommendations from
the recent European guidelines on CVD prevention and lipid man-
agement,1,2 the Panel emphasizes that the established cardiovascular
benefits of statin therapy far outweigh the risk of any such adverse
effects (Take home figure).
