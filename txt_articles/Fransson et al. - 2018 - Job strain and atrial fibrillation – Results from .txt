Abstract  
Background: Knowledge about the impact of occupational exposures, such as work 
stress, on the risk of atrial fibrillation is limited. The present study aims to investigate the 
association between job strain, a measure of work stress, and atrial fibrillation.  
Design: Prospective cohort study design and fixed-effect meta-analysis. 
Methods: Data from the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health (SLOSH) 
was utilised for the main analysis, combining self-reported data on work stress at 
baseline with follow-up data on atrial fibrillation from nationwide registers. Cox 
proportional hazard regression analyses were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 
95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A fixed-effect meta-analysis was conducted to pool 
the results from the present study with results from two similar previously published 
studies. 
Results: Based on SLOSH data, job strain was associated with an almost 50% increased 
risk of atrial fibrillation (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.00-2.18) after adjustment for age, sex and 
education. Further adjustment for smoking, physical activity, body mass index and 
hypertension did not alter the estimated risk. The meta-analysis of the present and two 
previously published studies showed a consistent pattern, with job strain being associated 
with increased risk of AF in all three studies. The estimated pooled HR was 1.37 (95% 
CI 1.13-1.67). 
Conclusions: The results highlight that occupational exposures, such as work stress, may 
be important risk factors for incident atrial fibrillation.

Introduction 
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia and is associated 
with severe consequences such as a 2 to 5-fold increased risk of stroke and premature 
mortality.1-3 In a European perspective, it is estimated that approximately 10 million 
people currently suffer from atrial fibrillation, with 100,000-200,000 new-onset cases 
every year.2 The incidence of AF has increased during recent decades, and with an 
ageing population, this trend is expected to continue.4  
Even though AF is prevalent in the population and should be viewed as a major public 
health concern, there is limited knowledge about the underlying risk factors and 
biological mechanisms of the disease. Except for high age and male sex, other heart 
diseases and hypertension have been associated with increased risk of AF, as well as 
smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, obesity, sleep apnea and prolonged physical 
exertion.5-7 More research on risk factors for AF and underlying mechanisms for the 
disease has been called for.1 
It has been observed that occupational exposures, such as noise, night work, long 
working hours, and work-related psychosocial factors, including work stress, are 
associated with coronary heart disease and stroke.8-11 However, few studies have been 
undertaken to explore occupational exposures in relation to AF risk,12-14 and to our 
knowledge, only two studies have previously been published regarding work stress and 
AF.15, 16  
The most frequently used model for research on work stress is the demand-control 
model, which postulates that a job characterised by high psychological demands in 
Accepted Manuscript, European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, 2018
 5 
 
combination with low control over the work situation (job strain) implies an increased 
risk of ill-health.17,18 
The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between work stress, 
defined as job strain, and incident atrial fibrillation in a representative sample of the 
Swedish working population. A further aim was to pool the results from the present study 
with available data from two previously published studies on the same topic. 
Methods 
The Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health 
In the present study, data from the Swedish Longitudinal Occupational Survey of Health 
(SLOSH) was utilised.19 The overall aim of SLOSH is to increase the understanding of 
the complex associations between labour force participation, work organisation, work 
environment and health. The study population is drawn from the Swedish Work 
Environment Survey, aiming to cover a representative sample of the working population 
in Sweden. The first SLOSH follow-up of these participants was carried out in 2006, 
with subsequent data collections every second year over the period 2008-2016. In each 
data collection wave after 2006, previous participants were re-invited. New participants 
have been added successively to the study population.  
The surveys consist of postal self-completion questionnaires covering a broad range of 
topics, including socio-demographic characteristics, work-related factors, lifestyle and 
health. Registry data from national registries covering inpatient and outpatient hospital 
care, as well as cause-specific mortality, is also available. The response rate was 65% in 
2006, 61% in 2008, and 57% in 2010.

SLOSH has been approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, and all 
participants gave informed consent to participate in the study. 
Analytical sample 
For this study, we used data from participants included for the first time in SLOSH 2006, 
2008 or 2010, who were gainfully employed and worked at least 30% (n=13,477). 
Participants with a history of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction or heart failure prior 
to inclusion in the study (n=201), or for whom information on job strain at baseline was 
missing (n=76) were excluded, leaving 13,200 participants (5,980 men and 7,220 
women) as our analytical sample. 
Work stress according to the job demand-control (job strain) model 
Work stress was measured at baseline (i.e. the time of study inclusion) and was defined 
as job strain according to the job demand-control model. The Swedish demand-control 
questionnaire with five job demand items and six control items was used to measure job 
demands and control.20 Mean response scores for job demands and control, respectively, 
were calculated for each participant. The median scores for job demands and control for 
the total study population were used as cut-points, defining high demands as demand 
scores strictly above the median, and low control as control scores strictly below the 
median. 
In the main analyses, those with job strain (high demands and low control) were 
compared with all others. We also constructed four categories based on the combinations 
of job demands and control: low strain jobs (low demands, high control); passive jobs 
(low demands, low control); active jobs (high demands, high control); and high strain 
jobs (high demands, low control).

Atrial fibrillation 
Incident cases of atrial fibrillation, and flutter were identified through the Swedish 
national inpatient, outpatient and mortality registers using ICD-10 code I48. 
Potential confounders 
Several socio-demographic, lifestyle and health-related factors have previously been 
observed to be associated with both job strain and atrial fibrillation, and could thus 
potentially act as confounders when studying the association between job strain and atrial 
fibrillation. In the analyses, the following factors were considered to be potential 
confounders: Age in years (continuous), sex (man/woman), education (compulsory 
school; 2-years upper secondary school; 3 or 4 years upper secondary school; university 
education <3 years; university education ≥ 3 years), smoking (daily; occasional; no), 
leisure-time physical activity (never or seldom; every now and then; regularly), body 
mass index (≤24.99 kg/m2; 25.00-29.99 kg/m2; ≥30.00 kg/m2), and self-reported 
hypertension (yes; no). 
Studies included in meta-analysis 
To our knowledge, only two studies have previously been published presenting results on 
the association between job strain and atrial fibrillation, briefly described below.  
The Primary Prevention Study (PPS) 
PPS is a population-based cohort study conducted in Gothenburg, Sweden.15 The study 
includes men born between 1915 and 1925, with study baseline 1974-1977. The analyses 
comprised 6,035 men, with an average follow-up time of 16.8 years. Job strain was 
Accepted Manuscript, European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, 2018

measured by using a job-exposure matrix based on occupation at baseline. During 
follow-up, 436 atrial fibrillation cases were identified by linkage to national registers. 
The Work, Lipids and Fibrinogen Study (WOLF) 
The WOLF study is a longitudinal occupational cohort study conducted in Sweden.16 The 
baseline examination was carried out 1992-1998, and the analyses comprised 10,121 men 
and women, with a median follow-up time of 13.6 years. Job strain was measured by the 
Swedish Demand-Control questionnaire. In total, 253 atrial fibrillation cases were 
identified during follow-up using national registers. 
Statistical analyses 
All participants were followed from the time of inclusion in SLOSH to their first 
recorded AF event, death or end of study follow-up (31 December 2013), whichever 
came first. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to illustrate the hazard function for incident 
atrial fibrillation during follow-up by job strain category. Cox proportional hazard 
regression analyses were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) to evaluate the association between job strain and risk of incident atrial 
fibrillation. The assumption of proportional hazard over time was checked by inspecting 
the plot for the hazard function, and by including an interaction term between job strain 
and follow-up time in the Cox hazard regression model. Potential difference in the 
association between job strain and AF by sex was analysed by stratified analyses and by 
including an interaction term between sex and job strain in the Cox hazard regression 
model. All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 21. 
In addition to analyses of original SLOSH data, we also performed a meta-analysis in 
which we pooled the estimated HR from the present study with the results from the two 
Accepted Manuscript, European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, 2018
 9 
 
previously published studies on the same topic. We pooled the study-specific HR 
estimates in a fixed-effect meta-analysis, using R version 3.4.2. Weights for the included 
studies were derived by the inverse variance method. Heterogeneity between studies was 
evaluated using the I2 statistic. 
Results  
During a total follow-up time of 79,738 person-years (median follow-up time 5.7 years), 
145 incident cases of atrial fibrillation (94 men and 51 women) were identified using 
national registers. The background characteristics of the study population are shown in 
table 1. The mean age was 47.4 years at baseline, and 54.7 percent of the study 
population were women. Those categorised as being exposed to job strain were on 
average slightly younger (46.9 vs 47.5 years), more often female, had shorter education, 
were smokers, exercised less often and reported a higher frequency of hypertension, 
compared with those who were not exposed to job strain (Table 1).  
The plotted hazard function showed a higher risk of atrial fibrillation for those exposed to 
job strain as compared to all others (Figure 1). No obvious violation of the proportional 
hazard assumption was observed when inspecting the plot, which was also confirmed 
when including a job strain*time interaction term in the Cox proportional hazard 
regression model.  
In the Cox regression model adjusted for age, sex and education, job strain was 
associated with an approximately 50% higher risk of atrial fibrillation (HR 1.48, 95% CI 
1.00-2.18). Further adjustment for smoking, leisure-time physical activity, body mass 
index and hypertension did not alter the estimated HR in any major way, but as expected, 
the confidence intervals became slightly wider when more variables were included in the

model (Table 2). When analysing the four different groups based on the combinations of 
job demands and control, using the low strain group as reference, the estimated HRs for 
the high strain group were similar to those observed for the job strain group when only 
two exposure groups were used (Table 2). Both the passive and active groups had 
estimated hazard ratios close to the low strain group.  
When stratifying the analyses by sex, the association between job strain and AF was only 
observed in men (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.10-2.90 for men; HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.53-1.96 for 
women, adjusted for age and education). However, no statistically significant effect 
modification was found when evaluated by including an interaction term sex*job strain 
in the model (p=0.26). 
When pooling the results from the present study with two previously-published studies in 
a fixed effect meta-analysis, job strain was associated with a 37% increased risk of atrial 
fibrillation (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.13-1.67), with a consistent pattern across studies. The I2 
statistic indicated that there was no heterogeneity between studies (I2=0%).  
Discussion 
In the present study, we found that job strain was associated with an almost 50% 
increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation in the general working population in Sweden. 
The results were consistent with two previously published studies, and when pooling the 
results from all three studies, job strain was associated with a 37% higher risk of AF. 
The present study is one of few where occupational factors have been investigated in 
relation to atrial fibrillation,12-14 with only two previously focusing on work stress.15, 16 In 
accordance with the results from the present study, long working hours, which could be 
seen as an indicator of work-related stress, has also been found to be associated with

increased AF risk,13 further strengthening the idea that occupational stress is associated 
with AF. However, in studies using more general measures of stress, the results have 
been mixed.21-23 
The biological mechanisms linking work stress to AF are not fully known. However, 
reactions to stress include physiological responses involving both the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomous nervous system, leading to increased release of 
glucocorticoid hormones, such as cortisol, and increased sympathetic activity.24,25 In line 
with this, chronic stress has been associated with low-grade inflammatory state and 
elevated blood pressure.25-28 Both inflammation and hypertension may in turn contribute 
to atrial fibrosis and structural remodelling of the atrium.29 Furthermore, mental stress 
has been observed to be associated with altered left atrial electrophysiology.30 Autonomic 
imbalance, neurohormonal activation, altered left atrial electrophysiology, and structural 
remodelling of the atrium, have all been proposed to play important roles in the 
development of AF,29,31 making a biological pathway between work stress and atrial 
fibrillation plausible.  
The current study has several strengths. The SLOSH study has a prospective design, and 
is based on a large sample from the general working population in Sweden, including 
both men and women. An established and validated operationalisation of work stress, job 
strain, was used, which has frequently been used in research on work stress and 
cardiovascular outcomes.9,10 Furthermore, national registers of high quality32,33 were used 
to identify incident atrial fibrillation cases.  
All three studies included in the meta-analysis in the present study used the same concept 
of work stress, i.e. job strain based on the demand-control model, had a prospective 
cohort study design, and the outcome was identified by means of national registers, 
Accepted Manuscript, European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, 2018

improving the comparability between studies and making the pooling of the results 
highly relevant. However, it should be noted that the PPS study used a job-exposure 
matrix to measure job strain, while the demand-control questionnaire was used in the 
WOLF and SLOSH studies. By that, slightly different dimensions of the work conditions 
may have been captured in PPS as compared with the other two studies. Still, the 
estimated effect sizes were similar across the three studies.  
Some limitations should also be considered. Even if the sampling procedure in SLOSH 
was aimed at generating a representative sample of the working population in Sweden, 
the participation rate has declined over more recent data collection waves. The study 
population can still be viewed as broadly representative, but lower participating rates 
have been observed for those who were younger, male, had less education and were born 
outside Scandinavia.  
Atrial fibrillation as a disease is known to develop over several years, and the disease can 
remain “silent” and undiagnosed by the health care system for a long time. We used high 
quality registers to identify incident AF, but we cannot preclude the possibility that some 
cases were not identified in our study. However, this potential misclassification of the 
outcome is likely to be non-differential in relation to exposure and is thus likely to yield 
an attenuated hazard ratio, if any effect.  
Other clinical conditions, including hyperthyroidism and cardiac valvulopathy, are 
known to be associated with incidence of AF. If these conditions are present at baseline 
and are associated with increased likelihood of rating the work situation as stressful, the 
observed hazard ratios might have been slightly overestimated. However, we do not think 
this potential bias is likely to explain all of association between job strain and AF 
observed in this study.

We found only two previously published articles on the same topic, both showing 
associations between job strain and AF in the same direction as those found in the 
SLOSH study. When doing meta-analysis including published studies, the potential 
effect of publication bias, i.e. that studies showing negative results are less likely to be 
published, should always be considered. Furthermore, in the meta-analysis, all three 
studies were based on Swedish samples, and studies from other countries and different 
regions of the world are needed. Other measures or indicators of work stress, for example 
effort-reward imbalance and job insecurity should also be analysed in relation to AF risk 
in order to get a more comprehensive understanding of the role of work stress as a 
potential risk factor for AF. In addition, as the results in the present study are based on 
observational data, the ability to draw conclusion about causation is limited.  
In conclusion, our study adds further support to the hypothesis that occupational factors 
such as work stress, may be associated with increased risk of AF.
