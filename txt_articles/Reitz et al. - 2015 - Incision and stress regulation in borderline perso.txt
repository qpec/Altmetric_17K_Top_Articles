 Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a widespread phenomenon
with a prevalence of 18% in adolescents.1 NSSI, predominantly
skin-cutting, is also seen in 69–90% of female patients with
borderline personality disorder,2 where it is closely related to
emotion dysregulation.2,3 Since the primary motive for NSSI in
people with borderline personality disorder is to downregulate
aversive tension,4 self-injurious behaviour can be conceptualised
as a dysfunctional emotion regulation attempt5 and may be
maintained by negative reinforcement.6,7 Aberrant impulse control,
another symptom of borderline personality disorder, could be a
critical factor as well, so one might suggest that NSSI is frequently
driven by poor inhibitory control and disproportionate responses
to stressors.8 However, experimental evidence for this assumption
is sparse. Strongly connected to NSSI are findings in people with
borderline personality disorder showing reduced sensitivity to
pain.9,10 This hyposensitivity is further increased under stress.11,12
Research has found that painful stimulation is related to a
deactivation of the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex as well
as the amygdala,13 a region with increased activity during the
presentation of emotionally aversive pictures in patients with
borderline
personality
disorder
compared
with
healthy
controls.14–16 Simultaneously, painful stimulation led to increased
activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in participants with
borderline personality disorder.13 These findings led to the
hypothesis that a potential neural mechanism behind NSSI in
borderline personality disorder is a pain-mediated downregulation
of elevated limbic activity by prefrontal cortex. This was supported
in recent studies from our group, demonstrating that thermal
stimuli led to a decrease in limbic activation induced by negative
pictures in patients with borderline personality disorder17 and,
more specifically, that painful stimulation enabled amygdala–
prefrontal coupling.18 It was argued that this pattern of neural
activation mirrors dysfunctional emotion regulation by means
of an attentional shift, i.e. painful stimulation may serve to direct
attention away from the emotional contents.19
Previous studies on pain processing in borderline personality
disorder have used different types of non-damaging nociceptive
thermal stimuli, such as heat, cold or laser-evoked pain.11,20
However, most patients use methods of NSSI that lead to skin
lesions, by means of cutting or burning.4,5 This is important
because different neural processes are activated by mechanical
compared with thermal nociceptive stimuli, suggesting that
different stimuli may also lead to different brain responses.21
Therefore, one could argue that skin lesions in particular have
an important role within the mechanisms of NSSI. A pain
model that takes the aspect of the skin lesion into account is the

Background
Patients with borderline personality disorder frequently show
non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). In these patients, NSSI often
serves to reduce high levels of stress.
Aims
Investigation of neurobiological mechanisms of NSSI in
borderline personality disorder
Method
In total, 21 women with borderline personality disorder and
17 healthy controls underwent a stress induction, followed
by either an incision into the forearm or a sham treatment.
Afterwards participants underwent resting-state functional
magnetic resonance imaging while aversive tension, heart
rate and heart rate variability were assessed.
Results
We found a significant influence of incision on subjective and
objective stress levels with a stronger decrease of aversive
tension in the borderline personality disorder group following
incision than sham. Amygdala activity decreased more and
functional connectivity with superior frontal gyrus normalised
after incision in the borderline personality disorder group.
Conclusions
Decreased stress levels and amygdala activity after incision
support the assumption of an influence of NSSI on
emotion regulation in individuals with borderline personality
disorder and aids in understanding why these patients
use self-inflicted pain to reduce inner tension.

 incision–pain model,22 where a 4 mm long incision with a scalpel
is applied to the volar forearm. This model has been found
acceptable by several ethics committees, because (a) pain levels
are moderate, (b) bleeding is minimal and usually stops by
itself and (c) healing is rapid and without visible scars.22–24
Pogatzky-Zahn et al23 investigated 44 right-handed male healthy
volunteers with a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
block design. Fourteen out of 44 experienced a sham condition
(pressing the handle bar of the scalpel on the skin of the right
volar forearm), 30 underwent the incision procedure (as explained
for our study). Dependent on painfulness, a ‘high-sensitivity’ and a
‘low-sensitivity-subgroup’ were analysed separately. In the latter,
similar to our present borderline personality disorder sample
and our earlier findings,13 a deactivation of the left amygdala after
incision could be shown, whereas the high-sensitivity subgroup
showed an activation of the amygdala. In a pilot study24 we
confirmed the feasibility of the incision model and tested whether
tissue damage reduces stress in patients with borderline personality
disorder. The incision was applied after a stress induction25 and
resulted in a short-term increase in aversive tension in the healthy
control group in contrast to a decrease in tension and heart rate in
the borderline personality disorder group. In the present study, we
aimed to investigate neural mechanisms of NSSI-associated tissue
damage in borderline personality disorder by transferring the
established
incision
paradigm into the fMRI environment.
Specifically, we compared the effects of incision v. sham treatment
following a stress induction while participants were undergoing
fMRI. We hypothesised that subjective and objective stress
responses would show a stronger decrease in the borderline
personality disorder group compared with the healthy control
group after incision, whereas in the sham condition, we expected
the healthy control group to show a stronger decrease in stress
measures (i.e. functional stress regulation) than the borderline
personality disorder group. Furthermore, we hypothesised that
incision after stress would lead to altered connectivity between
the amygdala and prefrontal brain regions in the borderline
personality disorder group. Given previous findings pointing to
the relevance of the amygdala and its interaction with prefrontal
areas in the context of stress regulation, we decided to focus on
this brain region as a seed region of a functional connectivity
analysis of the stress regulation phase after incision. On the basis
of previous work, we also hypothesised that inhibitory coupling
(i.e. negative connectivity between prefrontal and limbic regions)
would be present in people with borderline personality disorder
under the incision condition only, whereas it should be present
in the healthy control group in the sham condition.
Method
Participants
Twenty-one female patients with borderline personality disorder
and current NSSI (borderline personality disorder group) and
17 female healthy controls without any NSSI events in their
history (control group) participated in this study. Both groups
did not differ significantly in age (borderline personality disorder
group: 25.95 (s.d.= 6.92), control group: 26.88 (s.d.= 8.29),
t(36) = 0.38, P = 0.71) or in educational background (Z = 0.81,
P = 0.53). For demographic characteristics see Table 1. Patients
met DSM-IV26 criteria for borderline personality disorder according
to the International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE).27
Axis I comorbidity was assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview
for Axis I disorders (SCID-I).28 Both interviews were administered
by trained clinical psychologists. Interrater reliability for border-
line personality disorder was kappa (k) = 0.69 for the SCID-I
(primary diagnosis) and k = 0.77 for the IPDE. Exclusion criteria
comprised a current episode of major depression, a lifetime
diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, acute suicidal
tendencies, major medical or neurological illness and psychotropic
medication within the 4 weeks prior to the investigation. We only
included patients who had shown NSSI at least once in the 6
months prior to study, as assessed with the structured self-rating
Questionnaire for Non-Suicidal Self-Injury,4 and who did not
express a request for treatment. This questionnaire assesses
frequency, motives and methods of self-injurious behaviour
without the intent to die, preferred methods, as well as intensity
and medical treatment of wounds. A total of 71% endorsed
cutting as their preferred NSSI method. NSSI was mainly used
to reduce aversive inner tension (57%) and negative emotions
(21%). The healthy controls were excluded if they had any Axis
I or Axis II lifetime morbidity or a history of NSSI.
Participants were given a written as well as a verbal explanation
of the task. Remaining questions were answered, and after that
all participants gave written informed consent. No participant
withdrew consent during the course of the investigation. The

 Incision and stress regulation in borderline personality disorder
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of the Medical
Faculty Mannheim/University of Heidelberg (application no.
2008-234N-MA).
Stimulus material and procedure
Participants were investigated twice on two consecutive days.
During fMRI, stress was induced in the first 21 min using the
Montreal
Imaging
Stress
Task
(MIST),25
which
combines
arithmetic with an algorithm causing disappointment. Both
difficulty and time limit are manipulated to simulate poor
performance (45–50% performance range). During the stress task,
we employed a block design with three 7 min sessions of image
acquisition.
After stress induction and disinfection with 70% alcohol,
incision/sham was conducted according to the standardised
incision protocol.22,23 With a sterile ceramic scalpel, a small
4 mm long and 5–7 mm deep incision through the skin, fascia,
and muscle of the anterior aspect of the volar forearm was
conducted by one of the authors (T.K.). Painfulness of this
procedure is comparable with a venipuncture and incision was
well tolerated by all participants. In all participants, bleeding
stopped spontaneously within 1 min. For the sham condition,
the participants’ skin was touched with the blunt end of the scalpel
without cutting. On both days in permutated order, participants
were not told which treatment they would receive. They were told
the incision could happen once or on both days of the experiment.
After incision/sham, participants underwent three 7 min blocks of
resting-state fMRI, during which they were asked to relax and look
at a fixation cross. Figure 1 shows an overview of the study design.
Subjective and objective assessment of stress levels
Participants rated their level of aversive tension at five time points,
namely baseline, after stress induction and sessions 1 to 3 (7, 14 and
21min post incision/sham, respectively) with a Self-Assessment
Manikin (SAM)29 on a visual analogue scale ranging from 1
(none) to 9 (extreme). Heart rate was calculated based on the
analysis of the systolic peaks of the oximetry signal measured by
finger mounted pulse oximetry. Heart rate was expressed as the
number of beats per min and averaged for the rest and stress
conditions of the MIST as well as the three time periods after
incision/sham corresponding to the time intervals for which
aversive tension was rated. Additionally, heart rate variability
(HRV) was calculated non-parametrically with the HRV triangular
index (HRV index; see Task Force of the European Society of
Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and
Electrophysiology30), and log-transformed because of violations
of the normality assumption. Reliable HRV scores can be
calculated based upon pulse oximetry data,31 although compared
with electrocardiogram data the derived parameter estimates have
a lower precision because of a rather low sampling rate. As a result
of technical problems and artefacts, heart rate and HRV data of
four participants in the borderline personality disorder group
and six in the control group had to be excluded from the analyses.
MRI acquisition
All imaging data were acquired using a 3-Tesla MRI scanner
(TRIO, Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) equipped
with a 32-channel head coil. In addition to a high resolution
T1-weighted structural scan, we acquired T2*-weighted echo
planar images with blood oxygenation level-dependent contrast
(BOLD, repetition time (TR) = 2 s, echo time (TE) = 30 ms,
192mm field of view, 64664 matrix, 36 slices, 3 mm slice thickness,
3 mm slice gap; flip angle, 808). As a result of technical problems or
movement, we had to exclude two participants in the borderline
personality disorder group and one in the control group. Imaging
data were preprocessed using SPM 8 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm,
Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College
London, London, UK) according to standard procedures. The
fMRI images pertaining to the three post-stress/incision/sham
runs were further subjected to detrending using the REST toolbox
version 1.7 (www.restfmri.net, Hangzhou Normal University,
Zhejiang, China) in order to remove linear drifts.
Statistical analysis
Analysis of subjective and objective stress responses
To verify the effectiveness of the experimental stress induction
through the MIST procedure, we computed a repeated measures
analysis of variance (rm-ANOVA) for condition (incision, sham)
and time (baseline, stress). Aversive tension, heart rate and HRV
were analysed using a rm-ANOVA with the between-subjects
factor group (borderline personality disorder, control) and the
within-subjects factors condition and time. We included data for
four time points: after stress induction, 7, 14 and 21 min after
incision/sham. In case of significant effects, post hoc tests were
computed, and effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were reported. According
to Cohen,32 d = 0.2 reflects a small effect, d = 0.5 a medium and
d = 0.8 a large effect size. All statistical analyses were carried out
with SPSS for Windows (20.0.0).

 Reitz et al
MRI image analysis
In order to investigate functional connectivity post incision/sham,
we extracted each participant’s BOLD signal time courses from the
three post-stress/incision/sham runs using in-house MATLAB code.
For subsequent connectivity analyses, we extracted BOLD time
signal from detrended data; for regression analyses of amygdala
activity, we extracted BOLD time signal from non-detrended data.
In both cases, bilateral amygdala was selected as a seed region and
identified in each data-set using an anatomical mask defined by
automated anatomical labeling (AAL) software (Groupe d’Imagerie
Neuro-fonctionelle, Bordeaux Cedex, France).33
First, to analyse changes in amygdala activity over time,
regression analyses of the extracted BOLD time signal were
computed for each person using simple linear regression (ordinary
least squares) in MATLAB, and the resulting regression coefficient
(gradient) for each person was entered into subsequent statistical
analyses. For connectivity analyses, the resulting time courses were
entered as regressors of interest into first-level analyses in SPM 8
to identify regions showing a time course correlated with amygdala
activity. The first-level analyses also included eight regressors of
no interest comprising the six movement parameters as well as
regressors for white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. For each
participant, we computed separate first-level analyses for each of
the three post-stress sessions. The resulting contrast images were
then subjected to a full factorial second-level analysis with the
between-subjects factor group (borderline personality disorder,
control group) and the within-subjects factors condition (sham,
incision) and time (session 1–3 after stress).
To reduce the possibility of type I errors, we combined a
statistical threshold of P50.001 with the cluster extent correction
procedure implemented in SPM 8, which computes the number of
expected voxels per cluster according to random field theory.34
Based on this correction procedure, the minimum cluster size
for the factorial analysis was determined to be 27 adjacent voxels.
We focused on regions showing a group6condition interaction,
i.e. effects that were stable over the post-stress course of the
experiment.
Results
Effects of condition and stress induction
on aversive tension and heart rate
Stress induction was successful in all participants, i.e. a 26262
rm-ANOVA for the time points ‘baseline’ and ‘stress’ revealed
an increase in aversive tension
after
the stress
induction
(F(1,36) = 69.9, P50.001, f2 = 1.39, Fig. 2(a)). A main effect of group
(F(1,36) = 16.07, P50.001, f 2 = 0.67) confirmed higher aversive
tension in the borderline personality disorder group compared
with the control group. There was no interaction effect time6group
(F(1,36) = 046, P= 0.500, f 2 = 0.11). Heart rate increased with the
induction
of
stress
(main
effect
of
time
(F(1,26) = 59.02,
P50.001, f 2 = 1.51; Fig. 2(b)), but the data revealed neither a
main effect of group (F(1,26) = 2.40, P= 0.133, f 2 = 0.30) nor an
interaction
effect
of
timegroup
(F(1,26) = 0.04,
P= 0.843,
f 2 = 0.04). The HRV index showed a decrease during the stress
induction (F(1,26) = 15.27, P= 0.001, f 2 = 0.77; Fig. 2(c)). The
rm-ANOVA for HRV index further revealed a significant inter-
action effect time6group (F(1,26) = 4.23, P= 0.05, f 2 = 0.40) but
no significant main effect of group (F(1,26) = 0.33, P= 0.572). For
none of the aforementioned parameters was a main or interaction
effect regarding condition (sham/incision) observed, implying a
successful stress induction independent of the day or condition
of the investigation.
Effects of incision on aversive tension and heart rate
In order to test the immediate effects of the incision, we computed
a 26262 rm-ANOVA, including condition (sham/incision), group
(control/borderline personality disorder), and the two time points
‘stress’ and ‘session 1’. For aversive tension, we found a significant
condition6time6group interaction (F(1,36) = 16.28, P50.001,
f 2 = 0.67; Fig. 2(a)) with the borderline personality disorder group
revealing a stronger decrease after incision compared with the
control group (t(36) = 2.19, P50.05, d = 0.71). In contrast, the
control group showed a stronger decrease after sham treatment

 Incision and stress regulation in borderline personality disorder
compared
with
the
borderline
personality
disorder
group
(t(36) = 2.17, P50.05, d= 0.72). For heart rate, no immediate effect
of incision could be confirmed statistically (condition6time6
group: F(1,26) = 2.55, P= 0.123; incision: t(26) = 0.53, P= 0.603;
sham: t(26) = 1.40, P= 0.173; Fig. 2(b)). However, the analysis
of
HRV
showed
a
condition6time6group
interaction
(F(1,26) = 5.07, P50.05, f 2 = 0.44), with a stronger increase in the
HRV index in the control group after sham treatment compared
with the borderline personality disorder group (t(26) = 3.27,
P50.01, d= 1.27). Contrarily, no significant group difference could
be found regarding HRV for the effects of incision (t(26) = 0.51,
P = 0.612; Fig. 2(c)).
In order to test the intermediate effects of the incision, we com-
puted 46262 rm-ANOVAs with the four time points after the stress
induction. We found an interaction of condition6time6group
(F(2.32,83.43) = 5.95,
P50.01,
f 2 = 0.41)
and
condition6group
(F(1,36) = 6.01, P50.05, f 2 = 0.41) for aversive tension (Fig. 2(a)).
After the stress induction, in particular during the first two
sessions of resting state fMRI, those in the borderline personality
disorder group stayed at a lower level of aversive tension after
incision compared with sham (session 1: t(20) = 3.13, P50.01,
d = 0.60); session 2: t(20) = 4.64, P50.001, d= 0.77). The analysis
of heart rate (Fig. 2(b)) showed a trend effect of condition6
time6group (F(2.19,56.88) = 2.49, P= 0.087, f 2 = 0.31). Analogous
to aversive tension, heart rate remained higher following the stress
induction after sham compared with incision in the borderline
personality disorder group. This effect was confirmed statistically
for session 2 (t(16) = 2.74, P50.05, d= 0.37), and found as a trend
for session 1 (t(16) = 2.07, P= 0.055, d= 0.38) and session 3
(t(16) = 2.02, P= 0.061, d= 0.30). HRV again revealed a condition6
time6group effect (F(1.83,47.49) = 3.64, P50.05, f 2 = 0.37; Fig. 2c).
Specifically, the control group showed a higher value on the HRV
index in session 2 after sham compared with incision (t(10) = 2.51,
P40.05, d= 0.64).
Effects of incision on amygdala BOLD time series
In order to analyse bilateral amygdala activity over time, we
computed a 262 ANOVA with the regression coefficient for
amygdala activity in the resting-state session after the stress
induction of each person as dependent variable and the factors
group and condition as independent variable. This resulted in a
main effect for group (F(1,66) = 6.73, P50.05, f 2 = 0.09), showing
that
amygdala
activity
decreased
more
in
the
borderline
personality disorder group than in the control group. More
specifically, we found that regression coefficients were positive
for the control group (mean = 0.014, s.d.= 0.029), pointing to
an increase over time. In the borderline personality disorder
group, regression coefficients were negative (mean = 70.015,
s.d.= 0.059), pointing to an overall decrease of amygdala activity
(T(68) = 2.581, P= 0.012) (Fig. 3(b)).
Effects of incision on functional connectivity
The seed-based correlation analysis of fMRI data with the bilateral
amygdala revealed a group6condition interaction effect in
Brodmann area 8/superior frontal gyrus (Montreal Neurological
Institute (MNI) coordinates 2, 24, 56; P50.001, k= 34, Z= 3.50,
Fig. 3(a)). Post hoc t-tests showed a significant difference of

Discussion
Main findings
This is the first study to explore the effects of incision-induced
pain and/or skin lesions on neural stress regulation in patients
with borderline personality disorder. Our findings revealed a
stress-reducing effect of tissue damage that affects subjective
experience,
psychophysiological
functioning
and
cerebral
processing (i.e. amygdala activity and connectivity) after stress
selectively in the borderline personality disorder group. This offers
a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying NSSI in
people with borderline personality disorder.
Analysing subjective tension ratings, heart rate data and
amygdala activity, we have replicated and extended our previous
findings of decreased stress levels in people with borderline
personality disorder in response to tissue damage.24 Given that
subjective tension associated with an increased reactivity to stress
is one of the most aversive feelings for those with borderline
personality disorder,4 our findings support the notion that tissue
damage has a soothing effect for these individuals. Lower levels on
the HRV index in the borderline personality disorder group are
consistent with the suggestion that reduced HRV indices may
be linked to dysregulated affective styles.36 In general, HRV is
influenced by the interaction of sympathetic and parasympathetic
outputs of the central autonomic nervous system (ANS), with high
HRV indicating a healthy and adaptive organism.37 Changes in
ANS tone are found in different mental disorders, for example
in patients with depression.38 An increase in the range of HRV
is related to a more vagally influenced heart rate (corresponding
to an increased HRV index), whereas a decrease is related to a
more sympathetically influenced heart rate (corresponding to a
lower HRV index) and an increased risk of cardiac morbidity.38
Because it has been suggested that psychological distress in
borderline personality disorder is related to an inability to regulate
intense physiological arousal,39 we interpret our finding of
reduced HRV in the borderline personality disorder group in
terms of revealing a higher sympathetic tone and reduced
resources for stress adaptation.
By simulating NSSI with an experimental pain model
involving mild skin lesions, a higher ecological validity should
be achieved, thereby enhancing our
understanding
of the
psychological
and
neural
processes
underlying
self-injury.
Furthermore, we used a powerful method of stress induction,
resulting in high and sustained aversive tension. We found that
amygdala activity, which has been repeatedly found to be elevated
in patients with borderline personality disorder,40 decreased over
time in the borderline personality disorder group, which was most
pronounced after incision. Furthermore, we conducted an analysis
of
functional
connectivity
during
the
resting-state
period
following incision/sham. Here, the borderline personality disorder
group showed a medium-sized effect (albeit only resulting in a
statistical trend) for enhanced coupling between the amygdala
and superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 8) following incision
compared with sham. The opposite pattern was observed in the
control group. This is in line with previous findings13,18 and
provides further evidence for the conceptualisation of NSSI as a
dysfunctional attempt to cope with dysregulated affect.
Other groups also investigated the intermediate influence of
stress on resting-state functional connectivity of the amygdala in
the recovery phase after stress.41 They found a coupling between
amygdala and prefrontal regions and interpreted this finding in
terms of a downregulation of emotional states and an adaptive
recovery from stress. In our study, functional connectivity between
amygdala and superior frontal gyrus was enhanced in the
borderline personality disorder group in the incision condition
compared with sham, whereas control group showed modulatory
coupling only for the sham condition. Given these similarities, we
speculate that healthy people’s ‘normal’ connectivity between the
amygdala and superior frontal gyrus is disturbed by incision. In
contrast,
we
conclude
that
in
individuals
with
borderline
personality disorder the downregulation of emotional states and
a recovery from stress are promoted by incision. In accordance
with this view, it has previously been shown that prefrontal
regions modulate emotional responses via functional coupling
to limbic regions like the amygdala.42 Activation in the superior
frontal gyrus, or rather Brodmann area 8, has also repeatedly been
observed
during
attentional
distraction.43,44
Therefore,
our
current findings may represent an enhanced prefrontal–limbic
interaction through pain, which may have acted as an attentional
distractor.18

 Incision and stress regulation in borderline personality disorder
Strengths and limitations
This study established the incision model in an fMRI environment
and thereby links the elucidation of clinically relevant mechanisms
with alterations in neuronal systems involved in NSSI in patients
with borderline personality disorder. However, several important
limitations must be kept in mind when interpreting our results.
First, we did not use a conventional fMRI design, which is why
we cannot draw inferences regarding brain activation patterns in
response to a task/intervention, but only regarding brain activity
over time and connectivity regarding resting state after stress. This
approach was deemed necessary because incision treatment can
only be applied once for ethical reasons. Second, aiming at a
replication and extension of our prior results24 to brain activity,
we used a similar study design. As a consequence, we analysed
resting-state connectivity after stress with a focus on intermediate
(10–20 min) effects. Thus, one could argue that we cannot infer
direct effects of incision on stress, which is only possible when
combining both experimental factors at the same time. Although
the analysis of seed-voxel connectivity is an adequate method to
detect connections between brain areas, it is based on correlations,
and causal interpretations should be treated with caution.
However, our conclusions are based on combined observations
regarding decreased amygdala activity and enhanced connectivity
in participants with borderline personality disorder after incision,
allowing for a more complex interpretation than connectivity
analyses alone. Nevertheless, future studies should test explicit
models of the assumed interactions, for example by dynamic
causal modelling.
Third, our method does not enable us to differentiate
neuronal traits underlying NSSI from changes in neuronal
connectivity. Therefore, our results may also be traced back to
previously existing traits, such as impulsivity. Besides, although
we provided a more realistic model of NSSI than earlier studies,
we cannot disentangle the effects of painful stimulation and tissue
damage. Further studies should focus on this differentiation as
well as the difference between an injury applied by an investigator
and a self-inflicted injury.45 One might assume that self-inflicted
pain implicates cognitive appraisal processes that, in turn, have
an impact on actual pain processing. Fourth, although our sample
size is appropriate to detect large interaction effects between
condition and group, the statistical power was insufficient to
detect medium effect sizes (17b = 0.96 and 0.65, respectively).
Especially with regard to our connectivity analyses, this could be
an explanation why we found only a statistical trend in the border-
line personality disorder group (with 17b = 0.82), although this
was related to a medium sized effect. Because we investigated only
female participants, our results cannot be generalised to men with
borderline personality disorder. Likewise, given that we excluded
patients with borderline personality disorder taking medication,
our findings pertain to a ‘borderline personality disorder sub-
group’ and cannot be generalised to the average patient with
borderline personality disorder. Interrater reliabilities for SCID-I
and IPDE were relatively low. Finally, it has to be mentioned that
NSSI not only occurs in people with borderline personality
disorder, but also in depression and post-traumatic stress
disorder.46 Therefore, an important question for future studies
is whether patients with other psychiatric disorders and who
self-harm differ from those with borderline personality disorder.
Implications
Taken together, we found higher levels of inner tension and lower
parasympathetic tone in patients with borderline personality
disorder than in healthy controls. An experimental skin lesion
normalised these symptoms and increased the connectivity
between the amygdala and medial prefrontal brain regions. This
was paralleled by decreased amygdala activity in people with
borderline personality disorder in response to incision after a
stress induction. Thus, we were able to confirm and extend
previous findings on the important role of pain in emotion
regulation in borderline personality disorder. Our data lend
support to the assumption that NSSI may help to normalise
disturbed emotion regulation circuits in borderline personality
disorder and thus elucidate why these patients use NSSI to reduce
high levels of stress.
