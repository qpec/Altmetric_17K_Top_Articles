Abstract
Objective
To investigate whether staffing levels of maternity units affect prelabor urgent, elective, and
intrapartum cesarean delivery rates.
Methods
This population-based retrospective cohort study covers the deliveries of the 11 hospitals of
a French perinatal network in 2008–2014 (N = 102 236). The independent variables were
women’s demographic and medical characteristics as well as the type, organization, and
staffing levels for obstetricians, anesthesiologists, and midwives of each maternity unit.
Bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted with multilevel logistic models.
Results
Overall, 23.9% of the women had cesarean deliveries (2.4% urgent before labor, 10% elec-
tive, and 11.5% intrapartum). Independently of individual- and hospital-level factors, the
level of obstetricians, measured by the number of full-time equivalent persons (i.e., 35 work-
ing hours per week) per 100 deliveries, was negatively associated with intrapartum cesar-
ean delivery (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 0.55, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.36–0.83, P-value
= 0.005), and the level of midwives negatively associated with elective cesarean delivery
(aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69–0.90, P-value < 0.001). Accordingly, a 10% increase in obstetrician
and midwife staff levels, respectively, would have been associated with a decrease in the
likelihood of intrapartum cesarean delivery by 2.5 percentage points and that of elective
cesarean delivery by 3.4 percentage points. These changes represent decreases in intra-
partum and elective cesarean delivery rates of 19% (from 13.1% to 10.6%) and 33% (from
10.3% to 6.9%), respectively.

 Conclusion
Staffing levels of maternity units affect the use of cesarean deliveries. High staffing levels for
obstetricians and midwives are associated with lower cesarean rates.
Introduction
Cesarean delivery rates have risen steadily in recent decades. Between 1990 and 2014, the abso-
lute increases in these rates were 19% in Latin America, 15% in Asia, 14% in Europe, and 10%
in North America [1–3]. This increase, which has affected especially high-income countries
with widespread access to medical services [2, 4, 5], has taken place despite the lack of evidence
that it provides additional benefits for either the mother or the baby [6–8]. Currently cesarean
rates exceed 50% in Brazil and are slightly lower in China; they are around 30% in the USA
and Germany and 25% in the UK [4, 9, 10]. In France, the cesarean rate rose from 15% in 1995
to 20% in 2003, but remained stable around 21% till 2016 [11, 12]. It nonetheless continues to
show a significant degree of unexplained clinical variation across hospitals [12].
Cesarean deliveries may lead to significant adverse consequences for maternal and child
health. Maternal risks include postpartum infection, venous thromboembolism and anesthe-
sia-related complications [13], and for future pregnancies, fertility disorders and especially pla-
centa previa and/or accreta [14, 15]. Some of these may lead to maternal death [16]. Child
health disorders associated with cesareans include neonatal respiratory distress [17], and child-
hood asthma and obesity [18, 19]. Finally, they impair the health system by increasing hospital
costs [20, 21]. For all these reasons, reducing cesarean rates is a major public-health objective.
The determinants of cesarean deliveries are interrelated, complex, and may differ from one
country to another. Because clinical indications are unlikely to explain more than a portion of
all cesarean deliveries [22, 23], the involvement of nonclinical factors should also be studied.
Individual preferences and characteristics of women affect cesarean use [24–26], as do physi-
cians’ attitudes and incentives [27–29]. Factors related to the maternity unit are also important.
Many studies have shown the heterogeneity of cesarean delivery practices across hospitals,
varying according to their ownership status [30–32], facility level [33], teaching status [34],
and organization [35–37]. However, only a few analyses have examined the impact of hospital
staffing on cesarean births [38–40], even though several studies have previously shown that
some specific characteristics of professionals, such as physician’s gender or fear of malpractice
litigation, are explanatory factors for the decision to perform a cesarean delivery [41–43].
The objective of this study was to assess the effect of maternity unit staffing levels for health-
care professionals on cesarean rates, while taking characteristics of women and maternity
units into account. We hypothesized that if staffing levels affect cesarean delivery rates, the
increase of cesarean delivery rates over recent decades might be attributable in part to changes
in these levels, given that hospitals have gradually been induced to control their staff levels to
reduce their costs [44].
Materials and methods
We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of deliveries in the perinatal net-
work covering the district of Yvelines (west of Paris) in 2008 through 2014. The network com-
prises 11 maternity units including two hospitals affiliated to a university (Universite
´
Versailles-Saint Quentin). Data were extracted from two French datasets. The first,

 CoNaissance 78, is a program that monitors maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.
It includes all deliveries in the district. This dataset contains demographic characteristics and
medical information about the pregnancy, the delivery, and maternal, fetal, and neonatal
health. Data are continuously recorded from the first health certificate of infants born in net-
work maternity units; another health certificate reports additional data such as severe maternal
morbidity, and a stillbirth certificate for all fetal deaths and medical terminations of pregnancy
from 22 weeks of gestation. These certificates are completed by midwives and physicians and
then collected and recorded; regular quality control takes place. The missing data rates
were < 3% for all variables in this study. The second dataset, the Annual Statistics for French
Hospitals, provides detailed information on the characteristics and location of all hospitals in
France, compiled by the Ministry of Health, from information the hospitals provide. The two
datasets were linked by using the name of the hospital of delivery and its identification num-
ber. The National Committee for Data Protection (Commission Nationale de l’Informatique
et des Liberte
´s, registration number 1295794) approved the study, which was conducted in
accordance with French legislation. Because the study was about standard care and because
the dataset contained no information that could enable patient identification, the study was
exempt from informed consent requirements and from Institutional Review Board approval.
Our variables were selected according to the previous literature on cesarean deliveries in
high-income countries. Previous studies have shown that demographic [45, 46], medical [47,
48], and hospital factors may affect the use of cesarean deliveries [30–37]. The demographic
characteristics included were maternal age and parity (nulliparous or parous). The following
medical characteristics were considered: previous cesarean, medical risk condition, plurality
(singleton or multiple), preterm delivery (defined by a gestational age < 37 weeks), fetal pre-
sentation (cephalic or breech/transverse), induced labor, and birth weight (< 2500 grams,
2500 to 4000 grams, or > 4000 grams). A medical risk condition was defined by any of the fol-
lowing maternal or fetal conditions and co-morbidities: diabetes, hypertension, preeclampsia
(including HELLP syndrome and eclampsia), fetal growth restriction, placental bleeding
(including abruptio placentae, placenta previa, and placenta accreta), or other pregnancy con-
ditions (such as obesity, infection, or congenital anomaly). Hospital (maternity unit) informa-
tion used was type, organization, and staffing. Type included ownership status (public or
private), university status (non-teaching or teaching), and level of neonatal care (no neonatol-
ogy unit, neonatology unit, or neonatal intensive care unit). Maternity unit organizational fac-
tors considered were: day of delivery (working day or weekend/holiday), obstetrician
availability (present 24 hours per day and 7 days per week in the unit or on-call but not neces-
sarily present), and size of unit, measured by the number of annual deliveries (< 1000, 1000 to
1999, or � 2000). Finally, staffing of the maternity unit included the number of obstetricians,
of anesthesiologists, and of midwives.
Hospitals reported their staffing in terms of full-time equivalents (FTEs) according to the
available information on working hours. A FTE corresponds to 35 working hours per week.
We used the average annual FTE of each staff category, which took into account the possible
variations that may exist across weeks, and was thus comparable between hospitals. We con-
sidered all professionals of the maternity unit involved in decisions about cesarean delivery
(i.e., obstetricians, anesthesiologists, and midwives), as they were not assigned to a particular
ward of the maternity unit (e.g., labor ward, outpatient clinic, inpatient unit), and as the cesar-
ean delivery decision may be made at different times during pregnancy and delivery. In partic-
ular, French maternity units usually provide prenatal care for women scheduled to deliver
there. The numbers of FTEs were related to the total number of deliveries per year and
expressed as numbers of FTEs per 100 deliveries. Because private-practice physicians in private
hospitals are self-employed, their working hours were not known and they were reported only

 as numbers of individuals. To consider the actual practice rates of those part-time private-
practice physicians, we used the assumption that each spent 50% of his or her time at the hos-
pital. This standard assumption has been used in previous studies [49]. Nonetheless, we con-
ducted a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our results, applying two more extreme
assumptions (25% and 75%).
Mode of delivery was the variable of interest. Because many factors associated with cesarean
delivery depend on the timing of delivery (before or during labor) or the degree of urgency or
both, we conducted three distinct analyses to obtain the most appropriate comparison groups
for our variable of interest: (1) prelabor urgent cesarean deliveries (such as those performed
for severe fetal growth restriction or abruptio placentae) versus all other deliveries including
elective and intrapartum cesarean and vaginal deliveries; (2) planned elective cesarean deliver-
ies versus all deliveries with a planned vaginal delivery, including both intrapartum cesarean
and vaginal deliveries; and (3) intrapartum cesarean deliveries versus all vaginal deliveries
[50].
The structure of our data was hierarchical, with women (first level) nested within
maternity units (second level). We therefore used multilevel logistic regression models
with hospital-specific random intercepts and estimated the robust variance that
accounted for the dependence between observations. These models took differences in
unmeasured hospital-level characteristics into account and considered the lack of inde-
pendence of observations within each hospital by assuming that women from the same
maternity unit were more likely to deliver in the same way than women from different
units [51]. Both bivariate (adjusted for the trend) and multivariate analyses were con-
ducted. For the bivariate analysis, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs). Because many variables were correlated, all factors, regardless of
their association with cesarean delivery in the bivariate analysis, were considered for the
multivariate analysis, and the final models included all variables. All models included a
trend to capture the heterogeneity in time and to examine the course of cesarean rates
over the study period. Results are reported as adjusted ORs (aORs) with their 95% CIs. In
all analyses, a two-sided P-value < 0.050 was considered significant. When any staffing
level was significantly associated with cesarean delivery, we estimated the percentage
change in the probability of cesarean delivery predicted to be associated with a percentage
change in this level (elasticity) [52]. A sensitivity analysis used hospital fixed effects mod-
els to consider possible correlations between the characteristics of maternity units not
explicitly taken into account in the final models and any staff variable. All statistical analy-
ses used Stata 13.1 software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) [53].
Results
The analysis included 102 236 live deliveries during the study period. Of these, 77 766 had vag-
inal deliveries (spontaneous or instrumental) and 24 470 cesarean deliveries. The percentage
of cesarean deliveries was 23.9% (95% CI 23.7–24.2). Overall, 11 719 (47.9%) were intrapar-
tum, 10 243 (41.9%) elective, and 2588 (10.2%) prelabor urgent. Table 1 presents the character-
istics of the study population, including the mean of the staffing level variables.
According to the bivariate analysis, staffing levels of the maternity unit were associated with
cesarean deliveries (Table 2). Notably, the number of FTE obstetricians per 100 deliveries was
negatively associated with intrapartum cesarean delivery (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40–0.71, P-
value < 0.001). The number of FTE anesthesiologists and that of FTE midwives per 100 deliv-
eries were not associated with cesarean deliveries. We checked that the number of deliveries
was not significantly correlated with the cesarean delivery rate (S1 Table).

 After adjustment for all factors in the multivariate models, maternity unit staff levels were
associated with cesarean deliveries (Table 3). As expected, well-known individual- and hospi-
tal-level characteristics, used as control variables, had significant effects on the mode of deliv-
ery. The independent significant variables associated with prelabor urgent cesarean delivery
were maternal age, nulliparity, previous cesarean, medical risk condition, multiple pregnancy,
preterm delivery, breech/transverse presentation, birth weight, and size of unit. Those associ-
ated with elective cesarean delivery were maternal age, previous cesarean, medical risk condi-
tion, preterm delivery, breech/transverse presentation, birth weight, private status, level of
neonatal care, weekend/holiday delivery, and size of unit. Intrapartum cesarean delivery was
associated with maternal age, nulliparity, previous cesarean, medical risk condition, preterm
delivery, breech/transverse presentation, induced labor, and birth weight. Regardless of indi-
vidual- and hospital-level characteristics, the higher the number of FTE obstetricians per 100
deliveries, the lower the intrapartum cesarean rate (aOR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36–0.83, P-
value = 0.005), and the higher the number of FTE midwives per 100 deliveries, the lower the
probability of elective cesarean delivery (aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69–0.90, P-value < 0.001).

 Because the obstetrician and midwife staffing levels were significantly associated with intra-
partum and elective cesarean deliveries, respectively, we used an elasticity study to estimate the
impact of a percentage change in these levels on the probability of a cesarean delivery. The
elasticity for the probability of an intrapartum cesarean delivery with respect to the number of
FTE obstetricians per 100 deliveries was -0.25 (95% CI -0.43,-0.08, P-value = 0.004). The elas-
ticity for the probability of an elective cesarean delivery with respect to the number of FTE
midwives per 100 deliveries was -0.34 (95% CI -0.52,-0.15, P-value < 0.001). The likelihood of
an intrapartum cesarean delivery would have been associated with a decrease of 2.5 percentage
points if the obstetrician level had increased by 10%, and that of an elective cesarean delivery
with a decrease of 3.4 percentage points if the midwife level had increased by 10%. This means

 that intrapartum and elective cesarean delivery rates would have been associated with
decreases of 19% (from 13.1% to 10.6%) and 33% (from 10.3% to 6.9%), respectively.
Rates of elective and intrapartum cesarean deliveries were stable while the use of prelabor
urgent cesarean deliveries decreased over time. After adjustment for all the study factors, sig-
nificant variability between hospitals remained for all types of cesarean deliveries (variance
0.106, 95% CI 0.033–0.336, for urgent cesarean deliveries; variance 0.295, 95% CI 0.200–0.436,

ean deliveries). The non-significant P-values for the Hosmer-Lemeshow test validated the
goodness-of-fit of the models.
Finally, we conducted sensitivity analyses. First, our analyses assumed that private part-
time physicians worked 50% of a full-time equivalent. To check whether this staff weighting
affected the results, we also considered two more extreme assumptions (25% and 75%). Our
findings were similar both for the bivariate (S2 and S3 Tables) and the multivariate analyses
(S4 and S5 Tables), regardless of the weighting used to assess the time private practice physi-
cians spent in hospitals. Second, our multivariate models considered each hospital as a unit
(random-effect models). To take into account correlations between maternity unit characteris-
tics not included in the models and any independent variable, we re-estimated all models by
considering each hospital as a variable (fixed-effect models). Results remained the same and
thus confirmed that our findings are robust and conservative (S6–S8 Tables).
Discussion
In this study, we observed a statistically significant association between staffing levels of the
maternity unit and cesarean delivery use. Independently of all other characteristics, staffing
levels for obstetricians and midwives had a significant impact on the use of intrapartum and
elective cesarean deliveries, respectively.
As the number of FTE obstetricians per 100 deliveries per unit increased, the rate of intra-
partum cesarean deliveries decreased. Several hypotheses might explain why higher obstetri-
cian staffing levels in a maternity unit may be associated with a lower probability of
intrapartum cesarean delivery. The presence of more obstetricians should improve the organi-
zation of obstetricians’ clinical practice. First, it might facilitate the availability of a full-time
laborist in the unit. Recent studies report that a dedicated full-time laborist staff model is asso-
ciated with lower cesarean delivery rates [54–56]. Second, obstetricians may share their deci-
sions about mode of delivery more often with their colleagues who would be more available.
Lessened time pressure might also encourage them to participate in their unit’s medical staff
meetings and in the development of hospital-wide protocols for medical management, which
in turn might improve their coordination. A Latin American cluster-randomized controlled
trial found that hospitals applying a policy of mandatory second opinion, based on the best
existing scientific evidence, reduced their cesarean delivery rates, mainly for intrapartum
cesarean deliveries, without affecting maternal or perinatal morbidity or maternal satisfaction
[57]. Likewise, a Canadian cluster-randomized controlled trial of a multifaceted intervention
involving audits of indications for cesarean delivery, provision of feedback to health profes-
sionals, and implementation of best practices resulted in a significant reduction in the cesarean
delivery rate, particularly for low-risk women, without adverse effects on maternal or neonatal
outcomes [58]. Another study in the Netherlands examined the impact of the introduction of a
cesarean delivery audit within the existing structure of daily report meetings in a regional
teaching hospital. Implementing this obstetric audit facilitated the discussion among staff
members about indications for cesarean delivery, improved awareness about lack of necessity
of some cesarean deliveries, and thus decreased the hospital cesarean delivery rate [59]. An
analysis in Taiwan examined physicians’ propensity for cesarean deliveries in obstetric clinics
and found that physicians with solo practices were more likely to provide a cesarean delivery
than those with group practices [60].
Similarly, as the number of FTE midwives per 100 deliveries per unit increased, the rate of
elective cesarean deliveries decreased. The more midwives, the greater their potential partici-
pation in pregnancy care. Previous studies have showed that midwives may have a positive

 effect on outcomes of delivery, reducing the rates of some instrumental interventions, includ-
ing cesarean deliveries [61–64]. Because midwives essentially provide care for low-risk
women, they may be less affected by the fear of malpractice litigation, which numerous analy-
ses have identified as a factor that increases the number of cesarean deliveries, particularly for
obstetricians, who do manage high-risk pregnancies and may therefore be more likely to antic-
ipate problems [43, 65, 66]. Accordingly, midwives may affect women’s preferences about
labor and delivery, encouraging them to deliver normally [67–69]. Pregnant women are often
anxious and afraid of delivery, which may lead them to feel uncertain about their ability to
deliver vaginally [70, 71].
No staffing level was associated with urgent cesarean delivery. Nonetheless, this type of
delivery accounts for only a small portion of all deliveries, 2.4% in our study, and is expected
to be affected most strongly by medical risk factors.
The large size of our sample (more than 100 000 deliveries in 11 maternity units) as well as
the high number of cesarean deliveries (more than 24 000) allowed us to obtain very accurate
statistical estimates. The high quality of data is a major strength of our study. The CoNaissance
78 program dataset underwent a double quality control. The contents of the certificates were
regularly checked by researchers at the General Council of Yvelines. The perinatal bureau of
the Ile-de-France Regional Public Health Administration Agency performed a second consis-
tency check under the scientific direction of Inserm Research Unit 1153. These quality control
procedures prospectively enabled the correction of false and missing data, thus optimizing the
accuracy and reliability of this dataset and the credibility of our results. Moreover, the informa-
tion on hospitals extracted from the Annual Statistics for French Hospitals was checked and
supplemented through the local perinatal network. Finally, we were able to disentangle the dif-
ferent types of cesarean deliveries. Since each of these types of cesarean delivery is performed
under different conditions, this distinction between types is an added value of our study.
Our study nonetheless may have some limitations. Although we had access to a large set of
individual- and hospital-level characteristics, confounding cannot be totally ruled out. We
nonetheless controlled for many available covariates, which allowed us to reduce the potential
for confounding. Body mass index (BMI) was not available but obesity, which is defined by a
BMI � 30 kg/m2, was available as a variable, so that we could adjust for it. Moreover, we could
not adjust for ethnicity since this information was not available. The midwife staffing level var-
iable was not significantly associated with elective cesarean delivery in the bivariate analysis,
contrary to the multivariate analysis. Such a result was expected because staffing level variables
are highly correlated with the characteristics of both patients and maternity units. This finding
thus highlights the importance of the multivariate analysis.
Although our dataset was large, it concerned a single perinatal network of 11 hospitals. Nev-
ertheless, both individual- and hospital-level characteristics in our study were similar to those
in the 2010 National Perinatal Study, a representative population of 535 maternity units in
France [11]. Similarly, the characteristics of the staff variables in the Yvelines district were
almost the same as those nationwide [72]. Further analyses focusing on other regions or coun-
tries are desirable to confirm our results. Lastly, we assumed in our analyses that part-time pri-
vate physicians worked 50% of their time at the hospital. This assumption may be a limitation.
However, to ascertain that it did not affected our results, we also ran sensitivity analyses using
two more extreme cases (25% and 75%) reporting similar results.
Our results may also have a broad public interest component outside France. Our models
enabled us to take many staffing differences into account, according to hospital type and orga-
nization. All of these exist across healthcare systems. Therefore, our findings on medical staff-
ing levels may be extended to other high-income countries, and in particular the results on
midwife staffing to those with midwifery programs. In other healthcare settings where the staff

 of maternity units includes nurses instead of midwives, the potential impact of nursing staff on
cesarean delivery rates should also be examined.
Conclusion
Using a large database, we showed that levels of obstetricians and midwives affected cesarean
delivery use. Decreasing unnecessary cesarean deliveries is clearly useful, but it is not yet clear
how best to achieve this objective. Reassessment of the staffing levels of maternity units may be
helpful since they are a potentially modifiable factor of the use of cesarean deliveries. High-
quality research is still needed to evaluate the possible impact of changing staff configuration
on perinatal outcomes.
