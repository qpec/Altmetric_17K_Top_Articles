Abstract
Background: Recent nutrition recommendations advocate a reduction in protein from animal sources (pork,
beef) because of environmental concerns. Instead, protein from vegetable sources (beans, peas) should be
increased. However, little is known about the effect of these vegetable protein sources on appetite regulation.
Objective: To examine whether meals based on vegetable protein sources (beans/peas) are comparable to
meals based on animal protein sources (veal/pork) regarding meal-induced appetite sensations.
Design: In total, 43 healthy, normal-weight, young men completed this randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, three-way, cross-over meal test. The meals (all 3.5 MJ, 28 energy-% (E%) fat) were either high
protein based on veal and pork meat, HP-Meat (19 E% protein, 53 E% carbohydrate, 6 g fiber/100 g); high
protein based on legumes (beans and peas), HP-Legume (19 E% protein, 53 E% carbohydrate, 25 g fiber/100 g);
or low-protein based on legumes, LP-Legume (9 E% protein, 62 E% carbohydrate, 10 g fiber/100 g).
Subjective appetite sensations were recorded at baseline and every half hour using visual analog scales until
the ad libitum meal 3 h after the test meal. Repeated measurements analyses and summary analyses were
performed using ANCOVA (SAS).
Results: HP-Legume induced lower composite appetite score, hunger, prospective food consumption, and
higher fullness compared to HP-Meat and LP-Legume (pB0.05). Furthermore, satiety was higher after
HP-Legume than HP-Meat (pB0.05). When adjusting for palatability, HP-Legume still resulted in lower
composite appetite scores, hunger, prospective consumption, and higher fullness compared to HP-Meat
(pB0.05). Furthermore, HP-Legume induced higher fullness than LP-Legume (pB0.05). A 12% and 13%
lower energy intake, respectively, was seen after HP-Legume compared to HP-Meat or LP-Legume (pB0.01).
Conclusion: Vegetable-based meals (beans/peas) influenced appetite sensations favorably compared to animal-
based meals (pork/veal) with similar energy and protein content, but lower fiber content. Interestingly, a
vegetable-based meal with low protein content was as satiating and palatable as an animal-based meal with
high protein content.

andomized controlled trials and some prospective
cohort studies have demonstrated that a high
protein intake can induce increased weight loss
and improve weight maintenance after weight loss com-
pared to a low protein intake (1�5). This effect appears
to be associated with reduced feelings of hunger and
increased satiety (6, 7), although increased energy expen-
diture may also be a contributing factor (8, 9).
In recent years, increasing attention has been put on the
environmental impact of different foods, and it has become
clear that meat products may contribute with more
negative effects, for example, production of greenhouse
gasses and CO2 emission,
than vegetable products
(10�12). Therefore, a replacement of protein from animal
sources such as beef and pork with protein from vegetable
sources, such as legumes, would be an environmental-
friendly approach. Such an approach would also lead to an
increased intake of dietary fiber.
Recently, the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations were
revised to reflect the issue on environmental impact of

 food production. Thus, a reduction in consumption of
protein from animal sources such as beef and pork and
an increase in vegetable sources such as legumes and
pulses was recommended (13). Furthermore, focus should
be on whole foods rather than single macronutrients.
When comparing CO2 emission for legumes with meat,
the CO2 equivalent (in kg) is increased with a factor of 30
(12). Despite this, the consumption of protein-rich legumes
is very low among Danes compared to the intake of,
for example, red meat. Adults in Denmark consume on
average 137 g of red meat and meat products per day (14),
whereas the intake of legumes is approximately 7 g per
day (15). The obstacles that could be accountable for the
low intake could be palatability, gastrointestinal discom-
fort, but probably even more importantly, that legumes
are not part of a typical Western dietary culture. A study
investigated
how chick
pea
supplementation
in
an
Australian diet affected satiation and bowel health (16).
They found that perceived satiation and perceived bowel
function were improved. However, inconvenience and
gastrointestinal upset were considered to discourage
legume consumption.
Very little is still known about the effect of Nordic-
grown vegetable sources of protein on appetite and body
weight regulation. The aim of the present study was
therefore to examine whether a meal based on vegetable
sources (legumes: beans and peas) was comparable to a
meal based on natural animal sources (pork and veal)
regarding acute meal-induced appetite sensations and ad
libitum energy intake.
Methods and materials
Study design
The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, three-way cross-over intervention.
Each meal test was separated by a washout period of at
least 2 weeks. Subjects were instructed to refrain from
alcohol consumption and intense physical activity for the
24 h proceeding each test day. In the evening before the test
day, the subjects consumed a 4.0 MJ standardized evening
meal (50.3 energy-% (E%) carbohydrate, 33 E% fat, 16.7
E% protein), consisting of pork and vegetable stew with
rice (prepared by kitchen staff at the department) before
8:00 p.m. After this time subjects fasted (consumption of
half a liter of water was allowed).
On each test day, the subjects met fasting in the morning
at the department. After voiding, they were weighed to the
nearest 0.05 kg on a decimal scale (Lindeltronic 8000,
Copenhagen, Denmark). Before the test meal was served,
subjects filled in the first visual analog scales (VASs). The
test meal was served and consumed within 15 min. After
the meal, subjects filled in VAS at time points 15, 30, 60, 90,
120, 150, and 180 min. VAS for palatability of the test
meals were filled in immediately after finishing the meal.
Three hours after the test meal, an ad libitum lunch meal
was served, and subjects were instructed to eat until they
felt comfortably satiated. The ad libitum lunch consisted
of Pasta Bolognese and was served with 300 ml water.
The meal had an energy content of 961 kJ/100 g and a
macronutrient composition of 55 E% carbohydrates,
30 E% fat, and 15 E% protein. Food intake was registered
and energy intake calculated. The subjects were not
allowed to consume any other foods or drinks throughout
the test day, but were allowed to read, listen to the radio, or
use their computer.
Subjects
Healthy young men were recruited through university
intranet systems and advertisements on websites. Sub-
jects should be normal-weight to moderately overweight
(body mass index (BMI) 22�28 kg/m2), between 18 and
40 years of age, and free of any chronic health conditions.
Subjects who smoked, were athletes (�10 h exercise/
week), used regular medication, had food allergies, or used
dietary supplements were excluded. In total, 60 subjects
were screened; 7 subjects did not meet the inclusion/
exclusion criteria, and 5 withdrew consent before starting
the study. Thus, 48 subjects started the study. The subjects
were given both verbal and written information, where-
upon all gave written consent. Subjects meeting all the
inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to the three
meals. Meal sequences were generated by hand to make
an even number of each sequence and a computer was
used to generate a list of these sequences in random order.
The list was kept by the investigator and not disclosed
to the study coordinator who enrolled the subjects in the
study.
The study was carried out at the Department of
Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Faculty of Science,
University of Copenhagen, Frederiksberg, Denmark,
April�July 2011. It was approved by the Municipal Ethical
Committee of The Capital Region of Denmark to be
in accordance with the Helsinki-II declaration. Subjects
received �300 US$ as compensation on completion of all
the test days. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT01345487.
Test meals
The test meals were given as breakfast meals and
each provided 3.5 MJ (Table 1). Three test meals were
compared: one with a high protein content from meat,
HP-Meat (19 E% protein, 53 E% carbohydrate, 28 E% fat,
6 g fiber/100 g); one with a high protein content from
legumes, HP-Legume (19 E% protein, 53 E% carbohy-
drate, 28 E% fat, 25 g fiber/100 g); and one with a low
protein content from legumes, LP-Legume (9 E% protein,
62 E% carbohydrate, 28 E% fat, 10 g fiber/100 g). The
meals were all composed of oven-baked patties, made of
veal and pork meat (HP-Meat) or of fava beans (HP-
Legume and LP-Legume), and a mash of either potato

 (HP-Meat), split peas (HP-Legume), or a combination of
the two (LP-Legume) (Table 1). Water was added to the
recipes of the HP-Legume and LP-Legume meals in order
to achieve similar serving weight and energy density of
all three meals. The final serving weight was 591 g for the
three meals. The test meals were served with 300 ml of
drinking water. The meals were prepared by the experi-
enced kitchen staff at the department, but were blinded
when served by the study responsible to the subjects. The
energy content and nutrient composition of the test meals
were calculated using Dankost 3000 dietary assessment
software (Danish Catering Center, Herlev, Denmark). The
software is based on the food database from the Danish
Technical University. The energy factors used are 17 kJ/g
for protein, 37 kJ/g for fat, 17 kJ/g for available carbohy-
drate, and 8 kJ/g for dietary fiber. Fiber content was
analyzed by a standard method (17) and protein content
was measured using the Kjeldahl method (18).
Measurements of subjective appetite
VASs were used to assess subjective perception of palat-
abilityof the test meals aswell as appetite sensations before
and for 180 min after consumption of the test meals. VAS,
100 mm in length with words anchored at each end,
expressing the most positive and the most negative rating,
were used to answer questions regarding the meal (palat-
ability, taste, aroma, physical appearance, and off- taste)
and appetite sensations (satiety, hunger, fullness, prospec-
tive food consumption, thirst, well-being, and desire to
eat something fatty, sweet, salty, or meaty). The four
standardized questions in relation to satiety feelings were:
How satisfied do you feel? (‘completely empty’ to ‘cannot
eat another bite’); How hungry do you feel? (‘not hungry
at all’ to ‘as hungry as I have ever felt’); How full do you
feel? (‘not full at all’ to ‘totally full’); and How much do
you thinkyou can eat? (‘nothing at all’to ‘a large amount’).
The four questions related to desire were: Do you feel
like eating something sweet? (‘yes, very much’ to ‘no, not
at all’); Do you feel like eating something salty? (‘yes,
very much’ to ‘no, not at all’); Do you feel like eating
something fatty? (‘yes, very much’ to ‘no, not at all’); Do
you feel like eating something meaty/fishy? (‘yes, very
much’ to ‘no, not at all’). The questionnaires were made
as small booklets showing only one question at a time.

 Subjects were not allowed to discuss or compare their
ratings with
each
other
and
could
not
refer
to
their previous ratings when filling in the VAS booklets.
The use, reproducibility, and validity of the VAS have
been described before by Flint et al. (19).
In order to integrate the different feelings of appetite, a
composite appetite score was calculated for each time
point. The score has been described before (20) and is
calculated with this formula:
[Satiety�hunger�(100-fullness)�(100-prospective
food consumption)]/4.
Sample size calculation
Power calculation was done based on the primary end-
point, composite appetite score (area under the curve
[AUC]) as well as on ad libitum energy intake. From
unpublished data we estimated that a minimum of 42
subjects was required to detect an absolute difference of
275 mm*60 min in composite appetite score and 385 kJ in
ad libitum energy intake between diets with a statistical
power of 80%, and a two-sided significance level of 5%. To
allow for an estimated �10% drop out rate, 48 partici-
pants were recruited.
Statistical analyses
The statistical analyses were performed on participants
who completed the intervention (n�43) using SAS
9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The statistical
significance level was defined as pB0.05. Data are
presented as estimated means9SEM, unless otherwise
stated. The appetite scores were analyzed using repeated
measurements and AUC, calculated by the trapezoidal
rule. Repeated measurements analyses were done using
ANCOVA-type linear mixed models including a time-
treatment interaction and adjusting for age, BMI, order
of treatments, baseline appetite score, and with and
without adjustment for assessed overall palatability of
test meal. Additionally, differences between subjects were
accounted for by means of random effects. AUCs were
analyzed using ANCOVA models including treatment
and adjusting for age, BMI, order of treatments, baseline
appetite score, and with and without adjustment for
assessed overall palatability of test meal. Ad libitum
energy intake was analyzed using an ANCOVA model
including treatment and adjusting for age, BMI, and
order of treatments. For the repeated measurements we
saw no significant time�treatment interactions. If a
significant overall treatment effect was found, post hoc
tests with Tukey-Kramer adjustment for multiplicity were
carried out to identify significant differences between
meals.
Results
Of the 48 included subjects, 43 completed all three
meal sessions and were included in the analyses (Age:
24.494.8 years; height: 182.697.2 cm; body weight:
76.897.3 kg; BMI: 23.092.1 kg/m2). Two subjects
withdrew after the first test meal because of gastrointest-
inal discomfort and three withdrew after the second test
meal because of lack of time.
Ratings of palatability of test meals
The test meals were assessed in terms of physical ap-
pearance, aroma, taste, off-taste, and overall palatabil-
ity (Table 2). The palatability of the HP-Legume meal
was rated significantly poorer than that of the other two
meals (pB0.0001). No difference between the HP-Meat
and the LP-Legume meal was observed for any of these
parameters. The palatability of the ad libitum meal
was rated similarly after the three test meals (data not
shown).
Ratings of subjective appetite sensations
Postprandial responses in appetite ratings are illustrated
by the scores for composite appetite and fullness sensa-
tions (Fig. 1). A significant effect of time was seen for all
appetite parameters (pB0.0001). Furthermore, an effect
of meal was seen for all appetite parameters (pB0.05).
After adjusting for overall palatability, an effect of meal was
still seen for composite appetite score (pB0.01), prospec-
tive food consumption (pB0.05), hunger (pB0.01), and
fullness (pB0.05).
Pairwise comparisons (without adjusting for overall
palatability) showed that the HP-Legume meal resulted in
lower ratings for composite appetite scores, hunger, and
prospective food intake compared to the HP-Meat and
LP-Legume meal (pB0.05 for all). Furthermore, the
HP-Legume meal was significantly more satiating than
the HP-Meat meal (pB0.05), but not than the LP-Legume

 meal (p�0.05). When adjusting for overall palatability of
the test meals, the HP-Legume meal still resulted in lower
ratings of composite appetite, hunger, and prospective
food intake compared to the HP-Meat meal (pB0.05), but
not the LP-Legume meal. Fullness after the HP-Legume
meal was significantly higher than after the HP-Meat and
LP-Legume meal, both with and without adjustment for
overall palatability (pB0.05 for both).
The AUCs showed lower composite appetite score,
hunger, and prospective food intake and higher satiety
after the HP-Legume meal compared to the HP-Meat
meal (pB0.05 for all). Additionally, the HP-Legume
meal caused lower composite appetite fullness ratings
compared
to
the
LP-Legume
meal
(pB0.05
for
both). When adjusting for overall palatability of the
test meal no significant differences in AUCs were seen
any more.
Ad libitum energy intake
A significant meal effect was seen for ad libitum energy
intake 3 h after the test meal (pB0.001). Thus, energy
intake was reduced by 400 kJ and 440 kJ (12 and
13%), (pB0.001) after the HP-Legume meal compared
to the HP-Meat and LP-Legume meals, respectively
(Fig. 2).
Ratings of subjective sensory-specific desires
The overall well-being of the subjects was rated lower
after consumption of the HP-Legume meal compared
with the two other meals (pB0.01 for pairwise compar-
isons) and the HP-Legume meal induced greater feelings
of thirst than the LP-Legume meal (pB0.05) (Table 2).
The specific desires to eat something fatty, sweet, salty,
or meaty were not different between meals (p�0.05, data
not shown).

 Discussion
The current study showed that a high-protein meal
based on vegetable sources (legumes: beans and peas),
induced higher post-meal satiety ratings and lower energy
intake compared with a high-protein meal based on
animal sources (veal and pork). Even more interest-
ingly, a low-protein meal based on legumes was both as
satiating and as palatable as a high-protein meal based on
veal and pork.
Although the vegetable meal was more favorable with
regard to appetite regulation, this does not document
that vegetable protein per se is more satiating than animal
protein. Because of the choice of natural food sources,
the HP vegetable meal had a higher fiber content than the
HP animal meal, and this may have induced a higher
satiety feeling. Also palatability of the HP legume meal
was rated lower than the other two meals and this partly
affected the results. Still, if choosing such vegetable
protein sources, our results indicate that it is possible to
obtain similar satiety, but for less protein, than with
animal sources such as those chosen here.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare
the effect on appetite regulation of vegetable meals based
on beans and peas with animal meals based on pork
and veal. There are several previous studies in this field.
However, they have mainly examined soy vs dairy (whey,
casein, milk) and used supplements and not real foods
as test meals (e.g. soy or whey dissolved in water) (21).
A few studies have compared pea vs dairy, but also as
supplements (22, 23). Only a handful of studies have used
real foods (solid) foods or meals and can therefore more
readily be compared with the current study (24�28).
Douglas et al. (24) evaluated the effect of meals with
beef or soy protein (34 E%) on appetite and hormonal
signals in 21 young, normal-weight adults. Meals were
macronutrient and fiber-matched or serving-size-matched.
There were no significant differences in postprandial hunger,
fullness, peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1
responses, or ad libitum energy intake after the beef or soy
lunches, whether matched for macronutrients and fiberor for
serving size. Another short-term cross-over study investi-
gated iso-energetic, high-protein breakfasts and lunches
(30 E% protein) based on meat (lean beef and ham) or soy
(soy protein powder mixed in a shake) in 12 normal- or
overweight men and women (25). No differences were
seen in satiety during an 8 h postprandial period, however,
lack of power could perhaps explain the lack of differences
here (19).
Similar results were found in a more long-term cross-
over study, which compared vegetarian (soy protein or
soy-textured vegetable protein) and meat-based (chicken
and beef) high-protein diets (30 E% protein) (23). Twenty
overweight or obese men were included and each diet
period lasted for 14 days with three meals per day. No
differences in daily rated subjective appetite sensations or
motivation to eat were found between the two diets (26).
Still, differences in rated pleasantness of the diets might
have biased the results.
Bayham et al. (27) compared egg vs cereal in energy-
and macronutrient-matched breakfast meals (20 E%
protein) using a 7-day cross-over design and 21 overweight
men and women. They found that fullness and PYY was
higher after egg vs cereal on the first study day, but there
were no differences after 7 days’ exposure.
The last meal test study using foods compared protein
(17 E%) from mycoprotein (plant), tofu (plant), or
chicken (meat) served as a pasta dish 4 h after breakfast
to 42 overweight women in a cross-over design (28). The
meals were isocaloric and macronutrient-matched, but the
mycoprotein meal contained twice as much fiber (6 g) as
Fig. 2. Ad libitum energy intake (mean9SEM) 3 h after the test meals. Ad libitum energy intake was reduced by 12% and 13%,
respectively, after consumption of the HP-Legume meal, compared to HP-Meat and LP-Legume (pB0.01 for both). HP-Meat:
high protein (19 E%) from veal and pork meat. HP-Legume: high protein (19 E%) from legumes. LP-Legume: low protein
(9 E%) from legumes.

 the other two meals (3 g). Subjective appetite sensations
did not differ, but ad libitum energy intake was signifi-
cantly higher after intake of the chicken meal vs either of
the two plant meals. This finding partly corresponds to
our present findings.
As mentioned above, soy is in general the most studied
vegetable protein source, whereas no or few studies have
looked at brown beans or green peas, more commonly eaten
in the Nordic countries. Furthermore, soy was most often
given as a protein powder mixture. It can be assumed that
the different vegetable sources matter when comparing
studies, as the amino acid composition is not identical.
Thus, in contrast to other vegetable protein sources, soy
contains all essential amino acids, although in relatively
small amounts. One previous study comparing soy with
pea (supplements) did not see any differences, though (29).
Because only 12 subjects were included here, lack of power
could, however, also explain this finding (19).
One prospective cohort study which investigated the
intake of animal and plant protein and subsequent weight
changes is worth mentioning. The result was based on
89,432 European men and women who filled in country-
specific food frequency questionnaires and were followed
for a mean of 6.5 years. A positive association between
animal protein and subsequent weight gain was found,
but this was not the case with vegetable protein (30). This
indicates less satiety from eating animal protein than plant
protein. However, it is not possible to exclude whether
other macronutrients or dietary factors in the food items
(i.e. dietary fiber) influenced the results (30, 31).
A recent meta-analysis supports that dietary pulses can
be a beneficial weight-loss strategy (32). Thus, analyses of
data from 21 studies showed an overall significant weight
reduction of �0.34 kg when diets included dietary pulses
compared with when diets did not. The analyses also
suggested that dietary pulses may reduce body fat mass.
The relatively large difference in fiber content between
our test meals most likely plays an important role with
regard to the satiating effects (33, 34). The fact that
there was no difference between the LP-Legume meal and
the HP-Meat meal indicates that a low-protein meal with
fiber-rich beans/peas is as satiating as a high-protein
meal with pork/veal and suggests that vegetable protein
sources can be efficient alternatives for weight regulation
with less use of protein than with animal protein sources.
Thus, in respect to satiety, a high content of dietary fibers
may be as effective as a high content of protein, when
using real foods.
The strengths and weaknesses of the present study
should be considered. We consider it a strength that we
used real foods in realistic meals. Thus, such meals could
be expected to be consumed outside the clinical setting.
This is in contrast to many of the previous studies, where
more unnatural meals and supplements were used. It
could be argued, though, that a weakness in our design
was that dietary fiber content was then not matched in
the two HP meals. However, this is a consequence of
using real foods. If a 2�2 factorial design had been used,
we might have been able to obtain a clearer picture of the
factor of interest (protein) without changing other factors
that could influence the primary outcome.
The current study also highlights that a high protein
level is difficult to obtain solely from vegetable sources
without compromising palatability. Statistical analyses
were therefore done with and without adjustment for
palatability of the test meals. This resulted in similar,
although less significant results for the appetite para-
meters. Such a finding is in line with the notion that food
not considered palatable is perceived as more satiating
than palatable food (35). It may be that our study subjects
were not familiar with vegetable-based foods and meals
and that this influenced their palatability ratings. Energy
density and weight or volume are also factors important
for energy intake and appetite sensations. We strived
to compose meals with similar weight and hence energy
density. Therefore, these factors were not likely to be of
importance in the present study.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a vegetable-based meal (beans/peas) influ-
enced appetite sensations and energy intake favorably
compared to an animal-based meal (pork/veal) with
similar energy and protein content. Interestingly, a vege-
table-based meal with low protein content was as satiating
and palatable as an animal-based meal with high protein
content. Differences in dietary fiber and palatability are
likely important contributing factors.
