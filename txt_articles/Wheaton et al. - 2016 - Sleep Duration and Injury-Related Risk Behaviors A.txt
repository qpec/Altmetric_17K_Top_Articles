Sleep Duration and Injury-Related Risk Behaviors Among 
High School Students — United States, 2007–2013
Anne G. Wheaton, PhD1; Emily O’Malley Olsen, MSPH2; Gabrielle F. Miller, PhD1; Janet B. Croft, PhD1
Insufficient sleep is common among high school students 
and has been associated with an increased risk for motor vehicle 
crashes (1), sports injuries (2), and occupational injuries (3). 
To evaluate the association between self-reported sleep dura-
tion on an average school night and several injury-related risk 
behaviors (infrequent bicycle helmet use, infrequent seatbelt 
use, riding with a driver who had been drinking, drinking and 
driving, and texting while driving) among U.S. high school 
students, CDC analyzed data from 50,370 high school students 
(grades 9–12) who participated in the national Youth Risk 
Behavior Surveys (YRBSs) in 2007, 2009, 2011, or 2013. 
The likelihood of each of the five risk behaviors was signifi-
cantly higher for students who reported sleeping ≤7 hours on 
an average school night; infrequent seatbelt use, riding with 
a drinking driver, and drinking and driving were also more 
likely for students who reported sleeping ≥10 hours compared 
with 9 hours on an average school night. Although insufficient 
sleep directly contributes to injury risk, some of the increased 
risk associated with insufficient sleep might be caused by 
engaging in injury-related risk behaviors. Intervention efforts 
aimed at these behaviors might help reduce injuries resulting 
from sleepiness, as well as provide opportunities for increasing 
awareness of the importance of sleep.
The national YRBS monitors health-risk behaviors among 
students in public and private high schools and is conducted 
by CDC in the spring of odd-numbered years. Each national 
YRBS uses an independent, three-stage cluster sample design 
to obtain a nationally representative sample of students in 
grades 9–12. The overall response rates* were 68% in 2007, 
71% in 2009, 71% in 2011, and 68% in 2013, and sample 
sizes ranged from 13,583 (2013) to 16,410 (2009).† Students

completed the anonymous, self-administered questionnaires 
during a single class period.
The combined analytic sample was composed of 50,370 high 
school students who responded to questions about sleep dura-
tion on an average school night (≤4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 
7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, ≥10 hours); demographic charac-
teristics (sex, grade, and race/ethnicity); and how frequently 
they used a bicycle helmet (among students who had ridden a 
bicycle during the past 12 months; responses = never or rarely 
versus sometimes, most of the time, or always); wore a seatbelt 
when riding in a car driven by someone else (never or rarely 
versus sometimes, most of the time, or always); rode in a car 
or other vehicle with a driver who had been drinking alcohol 
(i.e., rode with a drinking driver; at least one time during the

they had been drinking alcohol§ (i.e., drinking and driving; 
at least one time during the past 30 days versus 0 times); or 
texted or e-mailed while driving a car or other vehicle¶ (i.e., 
texting while driving; at least 1 day during the past 30 days 
versus 0 days). The percentage reporting insufficient sleep 
duration (≤7 hours according to the Healthy People 2020 sleep 
objective for adolescents**) and distribution of hours of sleep 
were calculated by survey year, sex, grade, and race/ethnicity; 
pairwise t-tests and ANOVA (i.e., linear trend) were used to 
assess crude significant differences.
Because no differences were found in mean sleep duration 
or prevalence of insufficient sleep duration by survey year, 
data from all four survey years were aggregated for subsequent 
analyses. Aggregating the data from four survey years provided 
adequate sample size for the calculation of low prevalence risk 
behaviors among students reporting each category of sleep 
duration. Unadjusted prevalence of each risk behavior was

compatibility with the results for the drinking and driving question in the 
2007, 2009, and 2011 surveys, students who responded “I did not drive” on

calculated by sleep duration. Pairwise t-tests were used to assess 
significant differences compared with 9 hours, the median of 
the sleep duration recommendation for teens by the National 
Sleep Foundation (4). Logistic regression analyses were used 
to calculate adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for the likelihood of each injury-
related behavior with a referent sleep duration of 9 hours and 
were adjusted for sex, grade, and race/ethnicity. All analyses 
accounted for the sampling weights and complex survey design. 
P-values of <0.05 were defined to be statistically significant.
Reported sleep duration during an average school night 
was ≤4 hours for 6.3% of respondents, 5 hours (10.5%), 
6 hours (21.9%), 7 hours (30.1%), 8 hours (23.5%), 9 hours 
(5.8%), and ≥10 hours (1.8%). Sleep duration varied by sex, 
grade, and race/ethnicity (Table 1). Female students reported 
a higher prevalence of insufficient sleep (≤7 hours) than did 
male students (71.3% versus 66.4%, p<0.001). The percentage 
reporting insufficient sleep ranged from 59.7% of students in 
9th grade to 76.6% of students in 12th grade (p<0.001 for 
linear trend). Among racial/ethnic groups, the prevalence of 
insufficient sleep was lowest for American Indian/Alaska Native 
students (60.3%) and highest for Asian students (75.7%).
Overall, 86.1% of students reported infrequent bicycle 
helmet use and 8.7% reported infrequent seatbelt use. Twenty-
six percent of students reported riding with a drinking driver 
at least one time during the past 30 days; 8.9% of students 
reported drinking and driving; and 30.3% reported texting 
while driving during the past 30 days. Unadjusted prevalence

of all five injury-related risk behaviors varied by sleep duration 
(Table 2). The likelihood of each of the five risk behaviors 
was significantly higher (APR >1.0) among students with 
sleep durations ≤7 hours; infrequent seatbelt use, riding with 
drinking driver, and drinking and driving were also more likely 
among students reporting sleeping ≥10 hours compared with 
9 hours (Table 3). The likelihood of drinking and driving 
was also significantly higher among students sleeping 8 hours 
compared with 9 hours.
Discussion
Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death for 
adolescents, with approximately two thirds of these fatalities 
related to road traffic crashes (5). Excessive sleepiness, which 
is most often a result of not getting adequate sleep, has been 
shown to increase the risk for motor vehicle crashes and other 
unintentional injury among adolescents (1–3). Although 
insufficient sleep contributes to injury risk directly by slowing 
reaction time, impairing ability to pay attention, or causing 
a driver to fall asleep (6), this study provides evidence that 
some of the increased risk associated with insufficient sleep 
might be caused by engaging in injury-related risk behaviors. 
In addition to a higher likelihood of engaging in injury-related 
risk behaviors among students who reported typically sleeping 
≤7 hours on school nights, infrequent seatbelt use, riding with 
a drinking driver, and drinking and driving were also more 
likely for students sleeping ≥10 hours compared with 9 hours. 
Although short and long sleep might simply be associated with 
other adolescent risk behaviors, insufficient sleep might cause 
persons to take more risks and disregard the possibility of nega-
tive consequences (7). However, depression might contribute to 
both sleep problems and participation in risk behaviors. Sleep 
problems, including both not sleeping enough and sleeping too 
much, are common symptoms of depression; one study found 
that adolescents who reported more depressive symptoms were 
more likely to engage in several injury-related risk behaviors, 
including infrequent seatbelt use, infrequent bicycle helmet 
use, and drinking and driving (8).
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita-
tions. First, the data were self-reported and the extent of any 
underreporting or overreporting cannot be determined. However, 
the survey questions demonstrate good test-retest reliability.††

who do not attend school. Nationwide, in 2012, approximately 
3% of persons aged 16–17 years were not enrolled in a high 
school program and had not completed high school.§§
The National Sleep Foundation recommends that ado-
lescents aged 14–17 years sleep 8–10 hours per night (4). 
To help ensure that adolescents get adequate sleep, they can 
practice good sleep hygiene (i.e., habits that promote good 
sleep). These habits include going to bed and getting up at 
the same time each day both during the school week and 
weekends, minimizing light exposure in the evenings, and 
keeping computers and other electronic devices, such as com-
puters, video games, and cell phones, out of the bedroom.¶¶ 
Parents can help by setting bedtimes and limiting when (only 
before a set time or “media curfew”) and where (not in their 
bedrooms) their teenagers can use electronic devices. Early 
school start times contribute to insufficient sleep among 
adolescents. Delaying school start times has been proposed 
as a means of allowing adolescents to get adequate sleep (9). 
Some students naturally need more sleep than their peers, 
but waking up and feeling unrested in spite of adequate sleep 
might be an indication of a problem such as poor sleep quality 
or an underlying health condition. Poor sleep quality might 
result from poor sleep hygiene, a bad sleep environment (e.g., 
too warm, too noisy, or cell phones in the bedroom), or a 
sleep disorder. In addition, long sleep durations might be a 
symptom of depression.
Various resources are available to address injury-related risk 
behaviors. Public health practitioners can refer to system-
atic reviews of interventions included in The Community 
Guide (http://www.thecommunityguide.org/mvoi/index.
html). Some evidence exists that health care providers, in 
collaboration with health educators, might be able to change 
adolescent injury-related behavior through screening and 
brief counseling, followed by a visit by a health educator 
(9,10). Information for parents of teen drivers on what they 
can do to encourage safe driving by their teens is available 
at http://www.cdc.gov/parentsarethekey/parents/index.html.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Insufficient sleep is common among high school students and is 
associated with an increased risk for unintentional injury from 
drowsy driving crashes and other causes.
What is added by this report?
Students who reported sleeping ≤7 hours on school nights were 
more likely to report several injury-related risk behaviors 
(infrequent bicycle helmet use, infrequent seatbelt use, riding 
with a driver who had been drinking, drinking and driving, and 
texting while driving) compared with students who sleep 9 hours.
What are the implications for public health practice?
High school faculty and administrators, as well as parents of 
high school students, should be made aware of the increased 
likelihood for risky behavioral choices among students who do 
not get enough sleep.
