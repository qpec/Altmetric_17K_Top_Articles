Abstract
Background: Despite the problem of inadequate recruitment to randomised trials, there is little evidence to guide
researchers on decisions about how people are effectively recruited to take part in trials. The PRioRiTy study aimed
to identify and prioritise important unanswered trial recruitment questions for research. The PRioRiTy study - Priority
Setting Partnership (PSP) included members of the public approached to take part in a randomised trial or who
have represented participants on randomised trial steering committees, health professionals and research staff with
experience of recruiting to randomised trials, people who have designed, conducted, analysed or reported on
randomised trials and people with experience of randomised trials methodology.
Methods: This partnership was aided by the James Lind Alliance and involved eight stages: (i) identifying a unique,
relevant prioritisation area within trial methodology; (ii) establishing a steering group (iii) identifying and engaging with
partners and stakeholders; (iv) formulating an initial list of uncertainties; (v) collating the uncertainties into research
questions; (vi) confirming that the questions for research are a current recruitment challenge; (vii) shortlisting questions
and (viii) final prioritisation through a face-to-face workshop.
Results: A total of 790 survey respondents yielded 1693 open-text answers to 6 questions, from which 1880 potential
questions for research were identified. After merging duplicates, the number of questions was reduced to 496. Questions
were combined further, and those that were submitted by fewer than 15 people and/or fewer than 6 of the 7
stakeholder groups were excluded from the next round of prioritisation resulting in 31 unique questions for
research. All 31 questions were confirmed as being unanswered after checking relevant, up-to-date research
evidence. The 10 highest priority questions were ranked at a face-to-face workshop. The number 1 ranked
question was “How can randomised trials become part of routine care and best utilise current clinical care
pathways?” The top 10 research questions can be viewed at www.priorityresearch.ie.

Conclusion: The prioritised questions call for a collective focus on normalising trials as part of clinical care,
enhancing communication, addressing barriers, enablers and motivators around participation and exploring
greater public involvement in the research process.

Background
Challenges in how randomised trials are designed and
conducted are commonly experienced at various stages of
the trial process. Uncertainties remain on many aspects of
the trial process, from planning and design to conduct,
analysis, reporting and dissemination.
Participant recruitment is critical to the success of every
randomised trial yet optimising recruitment remains a diffi-
cult, ongoing challenge for the trial community. Evidence
suggests that less than 50% of trials meet their recruitment
target with or without an extension [1, 2]. Difficulties in
recruitment often result in delays and additional costs in
conducting trials and additional costs associated with the
need for extensions. Having to commit additional resources
for recruitment efforts may also impact negatively on the
quality of follow up for those already recruited, further
compromising the trial outcome. Difficulties arise in using
the trial results to make informed decisions about clinical
care if they have failed to reach the recruitment target
necessary for an adequately powered study. From a funder
perspective, inadequate recruitment wastes available fund-
ing and the question the trial was funded to answer remains
unanswered, leaving treatment decisions uncertain. Fur-
thermore, a number of systematic reviews, focusing on
interventions to improve recruitment, reveal a shortage of
high-quality evidence from randomised evaluations of trial
recruitment interventions, and what little evidence that is
available has a very narrow scope [2–5]. This is reinforced
by Tudur-Smith et al. (2014) who conducted a Delphi study
with Clinical Trials Units (CTUs) in the United Kingdom
(UK) to identify topics of importance and to establish
consensus for research priorities around trial methodology
with “Methods to boost recruitment in trials” being identi-
fied as the highest priority [6].
For these reasons, it is important that research into how
trial recruitment might be improved is conducted urgently
so that scarce resources might be directed to areas consid-
ered important by key stakeholders. Research questions that
are both important to stakeholders and have not been
answered to date, may be identified and prioritised through
a priority setting partnership (PSP) [7]. This paper reports
on the processes and prioritised questions for research
identified by the Prioritising Recruitment in Randomised
Trials Priority Setting Partnership (PRioRiTy PSP). PSPs
have previously used the James Lind Alliance (JLA) method
to bring relevant stakeholders together to jointly identify
priorities for research concerning treatment for conditions
and illnesses [8, 9].
The role of the PSP is to identify questions for research
(or “uncertainties”) that are both important to stakeholders
and have not been answered to date, and to then prioritise
these through engagement across the various stakeholder
groups [7]. Prioritised questions are usually broad over-
arching questions, for which several more specific questions
might be identified. The PRioRiTy PSP was a collaborative
project by the Health Research Board Trials Methodology
Research Network (HRB-TMRN; https://www.hrb-tmrn.ie)
in Ireland with the support of the JLA in the UK. The
HRB-TMRN is an all-Ireland collaborative network, which
seeks to improve the planning, design, conduct, analysis,
reporting and dissemination of randomised trials nationally.
The HRB-TMRN was established in 2015 and endeavours
to improve the understanding of trial methodology nation-
ally through a suite of activities including training and edu-
cation, online support and primary methodology research.
The JLA is a non-profit making initiative that was estab-
lished in 2004. The JLA is funded by the National Institute
for Health Research (NIHR) and is centrally coordinated by
NIHR, Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre
(NETSCC). It brings patients, carers and clinicians together
in PSPs to identify and prioritise the unanswered questions
about the effects of treatments that they agree are most
important [7]. While the JLA PSP framework is a tried and
tested methodology for treatment uncertainties, this is the
first PSP concerned with research methodology uncertain-
ties. Therefore, the methods used during the study were
developed to accommodate a focus on methodological
rather than treatment uncertainties while utilising the JLA
PSP framework.
The purpose of the study was to identify unanswered
questions around trial recruitment research, and then
prioritise these based on agreement from across the rele-
vant trial stakeholder groups.
Methods
The PRioRiTy PSP was formally initiated in a meeting at
the International Clinical Trials Methodology Conference
in November 2015, where members (from the HRB-
TMRN, Trial Forge (http://trialforge.org), NIHR Evaluation,
Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre (NETSCC; http://
Healy et al. Trials  (2018) 19:147 
Page 2 of 12
 www.southampton.ac.uk/netscc/index.page) and the MRC-
HTMR (https://www.methodologyhubs.mrc.ac.uk)) agreed
the scope and nature of the project. Methodological uncer-
tainties around trial recruitment were defined as the recruit-
ment challenges encountered by recruiters, trial designers
and persons being recruited to randomised trials of health
care interventions. To collect a representative range of opin-
ions, the PRioRiTy working group brought people together
from across the UK and Ireland who were, or had been,
involved directly in any aspect of randomised trials.
Establishing the Steering Group
A Steering Group to oversee the PSP was established in
accordance with JLA guidance and held its first meeting
in May 2016. Potential steering group members were
identified by the HRB-TMRN and the JLA through an
open and inclusive approach of peer knowledge and
consultation with respective networks and existing con-
tacts. Membership included equal representation from
researchers, clinicians, trial experts, the public and/or
their representatives, as well as JLA staff. The primary
role of the Steering Group was to discuss and agree the
strategic orientation and processes of the PRioRiTy PSP.
The protocol was developed in collaboration with the
JLA and with reference to the JLA guidebook modified
as appropriate for the methodology, rather than treat-
ment, focus of the PSP.
Identifying and inviting potential partners
The first stage in the process was to invite potential
partner organisations to engage with the PRioRiTy PSP.
As per the JLA PSP guidance, industry representation
was excluded from this PSP, as traditionally the health
research agenda has been largely directed by the indus-
try agenda, with the voice of patients and carers rarely
included. However, the unique subject of the PRioRiTy
PSP meant that some changes to the usual exclusion
criteria of stakeholder groups were made. The JLA PSP
process does not usually invite representatives of the
research community (e.g. front line research staff and
methodologists) who are not also clinicians, patients or
carers to participate in the priority setting process; this
stakeholder group was included in this PSP given their
various roles in randomised trials.
Potential partner organisations were identified through
a process of peer knowledge and consultation, through
the Steering Group members’ respective networks and
through the JLA’s existing contacts. The PRioRiTy PSP
ensured that a wide range of partners representing the
broad stakeholder groups across Ireland and the UK
were secured so that the uncertainties gathered would
be from as wide a range of potential contributors as
possible. Potential partners were contacted and informed
of the establishment and aims of the PRioRiTy PSP and
invited to participate in the PSP. Partners were expected
to help promote the PSP to their members and to
encourage participation in the survey used to gather un-
certainties. In line with JLA guidance, we did not include
representatives of the pharmaceutical industry.
Identifying and engaging the stakeholders
The stakeholders for this PSP (listed below) were the
people to whom the online survey for the initial gather-
ing of information around possible uncertainties was
distributed:
� Members of the public who had been invited to
participate in a randomised trial or participated in
Trial Steering Committees (TSCs). They could be an
individual or representing a patient organisation;
� Front line clinical and research staff who were or
had been involved in recruitment to randomised
trials (e.g. postdoctoral researchers, clinicians,
nurses, midwives, allied health professionals);
� People who had established expertise in designing,
conducting, analysing and reporting randomised
trials (e.g. Principal Investigators/Chief
Investigators);
� People who are familiar with the trial methodology
research landscape (e.g. funders, programme
managers, network coordinators).
Initial survey development and deployment
Initial feedback from stakeholders on the challenges in
trial recruitment that they perceived as important and
wished to see addressed was sought in an online survey,
which was available between July and August 2016 (4
weeks). This survey contained five questions (Table 1)
asking people to consider their own experiences of being

 involved in randomised trials across specific areas. The
specific areas or domains (planning and design, con-
duct, information, trial recruiters and motivation) were
derived from the Online Resource for Recruitment
research in Clinical triAls (ORRCA) project recruit-
ment research domains [10]. The ORRCA project has a
web-enabled database (http://www.orrca.org.uk/) popu-
lated with published and ongoing recruitment research.
Respondents were invited to submit comments in an
open-ended format to a broad question about each of
the ORRCA domains. For example; what questions or
comments do you have (if any) about improving how
trials are planned and designed? They were also offered
a sixth open-ended comment box for any other items
not considered in the five thematic questions. The
survey also asked demographic questions and asked
respondents to identify which stakeholder group they
belonged to.
Collating and analysing initial survey responses and
developing questions
The constant comparative method of analysis was used
to identify emergent themes in the survey responses.
The constant comparative analysis method is an itera-
tive and inductive process of reducing the data through
constant recoding [11]. The information obtained from
the initial survey was assembled and categorised using
Microsoft Excel and merged into a single database.
Responses to each survey question were re-written as
research questions by two members of the project
team who independently extracted the data. Longer
responses were broken down into several key excerpts
as appropriate and multiple questions were created.
Responses judged to be not relevant to trial recruit-
ment were classed as “out of scope” and saved for
future analysis. Questions with common themes and
issues were merged into broader questions where
appropriate and duplicates removed. The reliability of
emerging themes and issues was reviewed regularly by
the two project team members swapping a portion of
their
respective
data
and
comparing
findings
for
consistency. Any discrepancies or issues arising from
specific responses were adjudicated by a third team
member and discussed by the research team if neces-
sary. The recruitment research domains used for the
searchable database ORRCA (http://www.orrca.org.uk/)),
were used as a framework to aid this process [10]. This
allowed members of the team to use the same classifica-
tion of research questions across recruitment themes. A
literature review was conducted in parallel with this
process to ensure that all of the included questions in the
interim survey were questions for which there was insuffi-
cient evidence to adequately consider them as being
unanswered. Our search strategy was developed by
reviewing and combining search strategies from the
Cochrane systematic review on “Strategies to improve re-
cruitment to randomised controlled trials” [4] and from
the ORRCA project [10]. The search was run (July 2016)
across MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Sys-
tematic Reviews, Social Sciences Citation Index and ERIC.
The findings of relevant, up to date (published in the pro-
ceeding 3 years as per standard JLA guidance) systematic
reviews identified were mapped to the questions and
reviewed by at least two members of the Steering Group
(see Appendix).
Development of the interim survey
A second follow-up interim survey was conducted to
prioritise and shortlist the newly developed questions.
The interim survey was open during November 2016 (3
weeks) and asked the stakeholders to select up to 10
important questions. Invitations to this survey were not
restricted to those participating in the initial survey. The
resulting shortlist of questions for research was cross
referenced with the identified systematic reviews. Ques-
tions were confirmed as unanswered if there was no
systematic review of research evidence addressing the
recruitment question or if a systematic review of re-
search evidence confirmed that the recruitment question
remains unanswered. The literature review to establish if
the proposed research questions were unanswered con-
firmed that all 31 questions formulated from the initial
survey where included in the interim survey.
Survey dissemination and promotion
While no formal target sample size was set for both
surveys, the number of surveys being returned by each
stakeholder group was monitored on a weekly basis.
Where any stakeholder group participation in the survey
was < 10% of the total responders, efforts were made to
ensure targeted promotion of the survey among that
group across the relevant partners.
Both the initial survey and the interim survey to
collect recruitment uncertainties were constructed in
SurveyMonkey® and embedded into the PRioRiTy sub-
page of the HRB-TMRN website. The survey link was
distributed by email and the survey was also available in
paper format if participants preferred this format. Steering
Group members and partners were asked to promote the
PSP and surveys to stakeholders via email, web sites, rele-
vant meetings, social media and any other opportunities
that arose. A social media promotion plan was developed,
with all Steering Group members requested to use
pre-worded tweets, which included the link to the survey.
No incentives were offered for return of the survey.

 Voting and ranking survey items
The Steering Group used ranked weighted scores to
decide which of the interim survey research questions
to take forward to the final priority setting workshop.
We followed the standard JLA approach as described
in detail in the JLA Guidebook (www.jla.nihr.ac.uk/
jla-guidebook/). Response counts were allocated for
each research question across each stakeholder group.
Summed scores from each stakeholder group were
calculated separately.
For each
of
the
stakeholder
groups, the highest ranked question was allocated a
maximum score (for example if there were 30 ques-
tions in the list, the number 1 ranked question would
be assigned a score of 30), the next one down a
lower score (i.e. minus 1) and so on down the list,
until the lowest ranked question received the lowest
score (i.e. 1). To obtain the overall ranking, the scores
for each question from each of the stakeholder groups
were added together. The question with the highest
aggregated score was ranked number 1 overall and
the lowest score was ranked lowest overall. This gave
the overall interim ranking to the research questions
and the rankings for each of the stakeholder groups,
whilst minimising bias owing to numbers of responses
from each stakeholder group.
Priority setting workshop
A final prioritisation workshop was held in December
2016 in Birmingham, UK, in order to condense the
number of questions generated by the stakeholder
surveys to (a minimum of) a “Top 10” list of research
questions agreed by consensus. The workshop followed
the standard JLA approach as described in detail in the
JLA Guidebook (www.jla.nihr.ac.uk/jla-guidebook/) and
was facilitated by the JLA’s Senior Advisor. Reimbursement
of expenses (all members) and remuneration for people’s
time (members of the public only) was guided by the
INVOLVE UK guidelines. All expenses were processed
centrally by the JLA for all stakeholders. Streamlining
of this process through a single line of communica-
tion facilitated appropriate procurement, efficient sub-
mission of expenses and timely reimbursement.
Results

Completeness of initial survey
The initial survey was completed by 790 respondents
with 382 (48%) of those answering at least one of the
open ended questions. Only one person requested a
hard copy of the initial survey. Completeness of the
initial survey across survey sections is outlined in
Table 2.
Demographic information – initial survey
The proportion of completed surveys from each stake-
holder group is presented in Table 3. The stakeholder
group with the highest response were researchers in-

 Information about the clinical subject area of ex-
perience was available for 711 respondents. The high-
est proportion of respondents identified cancer (18%),
followed by neurology – neurodegenerative diseases,
vascular diseases (12%) (Table 4).
Respondents to the survey were predominantly from
England (74%), followed by the Republic of Ireland (17%),
Scotland (4%), Wales (2%) and Northern Ireland (< 1%).
Initial survey responses, collating themes and merging
questions
A total of 1880 questions for research were formulated
from the 790 survey responses, which had 1693 open
text responses. Merging similar themed questions and
removing duplicates reduced this to 496 questions.
Where a duplicate question was removed, the total
cumulative frequency of the number of times this ques-
tion was mentioned across stakeholders was noted and
each new version of the database was saved to allow
traceability of concepts and questions from verbatim
quotations from individual respondents.
Where appropriate, questions were merged into
broader questions following review and discussion with
the steering group. Finally, questions asked by more
than 15 people and/or at least 6 of the 7 stakeholder
groups were selected to progress to the interim survey
of stakeholders. These criteria were developed through
consultation with the Steering Group after presenting
data across stakeholder groups. This resulted in the in-
clusion of 31 unique questions for research.
Interim survey
Completeness of interim survey
The interim survey was completed by 815 respondents
(female 71%, male 29%), of whom 100% selected at least
one research question for prioritisation.
Demographic information – interim survey
A total of 802 respondents provided information on
their stakeholder group. A full breakdown of affiliated
roles is presented in Table 5.
Respondents to the interim survey were predominantly
from England (77%, n = 603), followed by the Republic
of Ireland (9%, n = 72), Scotland (7%, n = 54), Wales
(5%, n = 38) and Northern Ireland (2%, n = 14).
Information about the clinical subject area of experi-
ence was available for 775 respondents (Table 6).

 groups to decide which of the interim survey research
questions to take forward to the final priority setting
workshop. For this workshop, based on JLA experience
in prioritising questions, 25 questions were brought for-
ward for discussion and final prioritising by the group.
Final prioritization workshop
The
final
prioritisation
workshop
took
place
in
Birmingham in December 2016 and a final Steering
Group meeting was held the following day to review
the results of the workshop. There were 31 partici-
pants representing the stakeholder groups who were
invited to the face-to-face final priority setting work-
shop and on the day 26 participants attended. This
was made up of 10 public members from trials or
trial steering committees, 7 frontline researchers or
non-researchers involved in recruitment, 6 trial meth-
odologists, and 3 researchers or principal investiga-
tors. Some members of the PRioRiTy Steering Group
attended
as
observers.
The
26
participants
were
divided into three groups with a JLA facilitator for
each group. Each group was provided with the short-
listed
questions
in
individual
question
cards
with
stakeholder group rankings from the voting process
and
an
example
quote
from
the
original
survey
submissions noted on the back of them. The ques-
tions had been sent to the participants prior to the
meeting so that they could have some time to famil-
iarise themselves with the list and decide on what
was important to them. The facilitators then guided
the participants through the process of discussing the
questions and agreeing, by consensus, a “Top 10”
from within them.
The group agreed that a ranked “Top 10” list would
be created and ranking for an additional ten questions
(11–20) would also be carried out. Therefore, the PRi-
oRiTy list of research questions features a list of both
the “Top 10” (Table 7) and the research questions
ranked 11–20 are available (www.priorityresearch.ie).
The process of managing the data analysis is illustrated
in Fig. 1.

 Accessibility of the research question list and repository
of relevant research
The top 10 questions for research can be viewed on a
user-friendly, dedicated website (www.priorityresearch.ie).
Research teams conducting specific research relevant to
any of the PRioRiTy research questions are requested to
submit basic details of their work to the HRB-TMRN
through the PRioRiTy website as a repository and cen-
tral record platform for the level of research ongoing
for each research question. This resource will be main-
tained by the HRB-TMRN and will be freely searchable
and accessible.
Discussion
The JLA process of priority setting through partner-
ship and consensus is already well-established around
treatment uncertainties. We believe this is the first
time the process has been used to identify uncertain-
ties around research methodology.
This Priority PSP identified that stakeholders believe
that to improve the process of how people are recruited
to randomised trials, research attention needs to focus
on normalising trials as part of clinical care, enhancing
communication, addressing barriers, enablers and moti-
vators around participation and exploring greater pub-
lic involvement in the research process.
Challenges encountered
While using a modified JLA process contributed greater
efficiency to the study, there were several challenges
throughout the process that had to be addressed at
each stage. Given that the topic under discussion was
research methodology, we were concerned that the
voice of the public may have been overshadowed by
that of research academics and practitioners. This issue
was discussed at all stages, from completing the surveys
through to the face-to-face workshop. To minimise this
risk, regular checking of survey responses and dedi-
cated promotion of the survey to the public, in particu-
lar, was carried out. Our experience suggests that
engaging people to take part in research about how to
improve recruitment of people into trials is difficult
and this is reflected in a lower response to the initial
and interim surveys from members of the public rela-
tive to other stakeholder groups. However, our efforts
from the beginning of the work, and in particular our
Steering Group public representatives, helped ensure
that the involvement of the public was meaningful and
relevant throughout the project, that the process and
language was accessible and that public representatives
understood the work and felt that they could contribute
on an equal basis.
The
face-to-face
workshop
was
not
without
its
challenges. The workshop participants were assigned
to small groups initially, each of which had a mixture
of stakeholders. The dynamic of each group was
slightly different, due to different backgrounds, per-
spectives, personalities, communication styles, expert-
ise
and
levels
of
confidence.
The
groups
were
required to cover some complex issues regarding re-
search methodology in discussing the uncertainties
presented and reach a consensus around prioritising
them. The discussions were robust and lively with
each person, as might be expected, taking strong
ownership of their own priorities and personal prefer-
ences. The presence of an experienced facilitator to
moderate those discussions was fundamental in en-
suring full, fair, respectful and equal participation.
The facilitators took steps to ensure that no one
dominated, or was excluded from, the discussion.
Pragmatism was required within each group to reach
acceptable compromises and revision of opinions in
the search for consensus. The small groups then
reconvened to one large group to agree the final “top
ten”. Good facilitation was again instrumental here to

 reach a democratic compromise where no-one felt
coerced to let go of the priorities around which they
felt strong ownership.
Another significant challenge centred on the lan-
guage used during all stages of this PSP, for example,
how the term “trial participants” was interpreted; some
viewed this as patients only, others thought of clini-
cians and healthcare workers as “trial participants”.
Other items centred around classifying “hard-to-reach”
or “vulnerable” groups, for which public and patient
contributors on the Steering Group were able to
provide more appropriate wording such as “seldom-
heard” groups. To overcome issues around appropriate
language and in a bid to provide distilled language, the
“GET IT” glossary (http://getitglossary.org/ [12] was
used and words were hyperlinked to their specific
translation on all materials, from website to initial
survey to interim survey.
The submission of a large volume of data in the
initial survey raised challenges around data manage-
ment. The large volume of data needed to be inter-
preted, categorised and combined into themes whilst
at the same time remaining true to the richness of
the submission. The two members of the project
group independently analysing the data, randomly
and regularly checked a sample of each other’s inter-
pretation and categorisation with a third member ad-
judicating on any disagreements. All data were filed
in a manner that facilitates tracking each recruit-
ment question back to the original submission by
the stakeholder.
The involvement of a wide stakeholder group in a
face-to-face meeting also presented new challenges to
the team, for which the JLA have considerable experi-
ence. For example, while the research team may be
very familiar with using email for communication, this
was less so for some of the invited participants, with
many not familiar with using email attachments or
checking their email infrequently. The team adapted
by communicating via phone and text, making sure
that every email was accompanied by a phone re-
minder or text message where needed.
Many of the challenges we encountered have previously
been described by others attempting public involvement
with research [13–15]. Similar to their experiences, we
found that a flexible and responsive approach was needed
to successfully address the challenges.
Implications of PRioRiTy
We believe that the PSP model was applied successfully
to the identification and prioritisation of methodo-
logical uncertainties in trial recruitment and that such
an approach has merit in identifying uncertainties in
other trial processes e.g. retention, reporting etc. The
use of the PSP process for this project also provided
some very useful learning around the successful en-
gagement of the public and patients in the conversation
about trial methodology. Given that the challenge of
recruiting to trials is an international problem, repeat-
ing this priority setting exercise in other countries may
need to be considered. The PRioRiTy study was Ireland
and UK centred but having found the PSP process to
be effective it could be replicated in other jurisdictions
where different trial infrastructural supports are avail-
able. International collaborations should now be fos-
tered and the efforts of research groups all over the
globe combined to address these prioritised methodo-
logical questions.
Conclusion
This
bringing
together
of
people,
engaged
re-
searchers, clinicians and the public in an exercise of
discussion, knowledge exchange and consensus, in
identifying, agreeing, prioritising and disseminating a
list of the most important methodological uncertain-
ties surrounding recruitment to trials. Methodology
research, such as the PRioRiTy PSP, is an essential
adjunct to clinical research. Such so called “research
on research” is acknowledged as an important con-
tributor to reducing waste and inefficiencies in re-
search [16]. The critical end point of the PRioRiTy
PSP is a top ten list of trial recruitment uncertain-
ties, determined by those directly involved in trials,
which will inform future research around developing
more effective recruitment procedures and processes
that encourage participation in randomised trials.
The investigation of, and answers to, the research
questions identified by PRioRiTy will inform future
research designs and increase the efficiency of re-
cruitment to trials. This, according to Salman et al.
(2014), will minimise avoidable sources of waste and
inefficiency in research [17]. Further, ongoing part-
ner engagement in designing future studies around
the identified priorities will be encouraged and sup-
ported so that trials might be better designed and
implemented in the future. Recruitment to trials is
an international issue that would be best addressed
by engaging in international collaborations for those
ongoing partner engagements.
International research groups are encouraged to col-
laborate and contribute evidence to answer the priori-
tised recruitment questions. Researchers are encouraged
to identify opportunities for building robust proposals to
answer these priorities and research funders are encour-
aged to integrate the priorities into their organisational
plans, research strategies and funding calls.
