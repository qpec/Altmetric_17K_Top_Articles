Abstract
Current pharmacotherapies for depression exhibit slow onset, side effects and limited efficacy. 
Therefore, identification of novel fast-onset antidepressants is desirable. GLO1 is a ubiquitous 
cellular enzyme responsible for the detoxification of the glycolytic byproduct methylglyoxal 
(MG). We have previously shown that MG is a competitive partial agonist at GABA-A receptors. 
We examined the effects of genetic and pharmacological inhibition of GLO1 in two antidepressant 
assay models: the tail suspension test (TST) and the forced swim test (FST). We also examined 
the effects of GLO1 inhibition in three models of antidepressant onset: the chronic FST (cFST), 
chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm, and olfactory bulbectomy (OBX). Genetic knockdown of 
Glo1 or pharmacological inhibition using two structurally distinct GLO1 inhibitors (S-
bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (pBBG) or methyl gerfelin (MeGFN)) reduced 
immobility in the TST and acute FST. Both GLO1 inhibitors also reduced immobility in the cFST 
after 5 days of treatment. In contrast, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) reduced 
immobility after 14, but not 5 days of treatment. Furthermore, 5 days of treatment with either 
GLO1 inhibitor blocked the depression-like effects induced by CMS on the FST and coat state,

 and attenuated OBX-induced locomotor hyperactivity. Finally, 5 days of treatment with a GLO1 
inhibitor (pBBG), but not FLX, induced molecular markers of the antidepressant response 
including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induction and increased phosphorylated 
cyclic-AMP response binding protein (pCREB) to CREB ratio in the hippocampus and medial 
prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Our findings indicate that GLO1 inhibitors may provide a novel and 
fast-acting pharmacotherapy for depression.
Introduction
Depression affects at least one in six adults at some point in their lifetime1,2. Current 
pharmaceutical treatments for depression are limited by slow onset of therapeutic effects (2–
4 weeks), side effects and limited efficacy3,4. Thus, identification of novel targets for 
antidepressant drug development is urgently needed.
GLO1 is a ubiquitous cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of methylglyoxal (MG), 
which is a non-enzymatic side product of glycolysis5. Therefore, MG concentrations are 
inversely proportional to GLO1 enzymatic activity. Electrophysiological recordings from 
primary neuronal cultures demonstrated that MG is a competitive partial agonist at GABA-A 
receptors6, suggesting that GLO1 inhibitors and direct administration of MG could act to 
increase GABA-A receptor activity.
A previous study reported increased depression-like behavior in mice overexpressing Glo1 
in the tail suspension test (TST)7, a highly reliable screen for antidepressant drug activity8. 
Previous studies have also shown that increased expression of Glo1 also increases anxiety-
like behavior in mice6,9,10. Additionally, administration of MG or a GLO1 inhibitor, S-
bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (pBBG), decreased anxiety-like behavior in 
mice6. Anxiety and depression are highly comorbid, show shared genetic liability, and can 
both be treated with antidepressants11–13. However, no studies have examined the potential 
antidepressant effects of GLO1 inhibition.
Therefore, we investigated the effect of genetic and pharmacological GLO1 inhibition in 
acute preclinical screens for antidepressant efficacy using Glo1 knockdown mice and two 
structurally distinct GLO1 inhibitors. We then assessed the time-course of antidepressant 
action of the two GLO1 inhibitors using the chronic forced swim test (cFST), chromic mild 
stress (CMS), and olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) models of antidepressant onset. Finally, we 
assessed whether 5 days of treatment with GLO1 inhibitors induced molecular markers of 
the antidepressant response, including Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) 
induction and cyclic-AMP response binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in 
hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC).
Materials and Methods
Mice
Glo1 knock-down (KD) mice on a C57BL/6J (B6) background (Dr. Michael Brownlee, 
Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY) have a 45–65% reduction in GLO1 
enzymatic activity14. Hemizygous male knockdown mice were bred to WT females all on a

 B6 background. Resulting offspring (KDs and WT littermates) were tested at ages 8–14 
weeks.
For studies using the GLO1 inhibitors pBBG or methyl-gerfelin (MeGFN), male and female 
B6, BALB/cJ (BALB) or FVB/NJ (FVB) mice were purchased from The Jackson 
Laboratory (JAX) and tested at ages 8–15 weeks of age. Multiple strains were tested to rule 
out strain-specific effects. All mice were group housed on a standard 12/12 hour light/dark 
cycle unless otherwise noted (e.g. during CMS) and underwent behavioral testing in the 
second half of their light cycle (12–5pm). Separate cohorts were used in each behavioral 
study unless otherwise noted. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee at the University of Chicago or at the University of California and 
performed in accordance with the National Institute of Health Guidelines for the Care and 
Use of Laboratory Animals.
Drugs
We synthesized pBBG (see McMurray et al. 2015)15 and MeGFN (see supplemental 
materials) based on previously described methods (see Thornalley et al. 1996; Kawatani et 
al. 2008; Kanoh et al. 2013)5,16,17. For the TST and acute FST mice received pBBG (50 
mg/kg in 8% DMSO/18% Tween80 in H2O), MeGFN (12.5, 25 or 50 mg/kg in 4%DMSO/
9%Tween80 in H2O) or their corresponding vehicle by I.P. injection 2 hours before testing. 
For the cFST, CMS and OBX, minipumps were filled with pBBG, MeGFN, or vehicle (50% 
DMSO, 50% PEG400) and inserted into a small subcutaneous incision made on the back18. 
Fluoxetine hydrochloride (FLX; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was delivered via the 
drinking water in opaque water bottles at a concentration of 160mg/L to achieve a dose of 18 
mg/kg/day19.
Behavioral Studies
TST—Male and female B6, FVB, Glo1KD and their WT littermates were assessed in the 
TST as described previously8. B6 and Glo1KD mice were scored using an observer blind to 
treatment/genotype. FVB mice were scored using EthoVision (Noldus Information 
Technology, Leesburg, VA); scoring from this system was strongly correlated with scores 
from human observers (data not shown).
Acute FST—FST procedures were performed as previously described20. Briefly, male and 
female B6, FVB, BALB, Glo1KD and their WT littermates were placed into round buckets 
22 cm across and 20 cm deep that were filled with water (23–25°C; 16 cm deep) for 10 min. 
On day 2, mice were placed in the same buckets for 6 min. The final 4 min on the second 
day were scored for immobility by a trained observer.
Chronic Forced Swim Test (cFST)—When treated chronically rather than by acute 
bolus injection, BALB mice show reduced immobility in the FST. In particular, this response 
is observed in response to chronic (14 days), but not subchronic (5 days) treatment with 
SSRIs19; therefore the cFST can be used to determine the timing of antidepressant onset. 
BALB mice were implanted with minipumps delivering pBBG (5, 10 or 15mg/kg/day), 
MeGFN (5, 10, 15 mg/kg/day) or vehicle for either 5 days (male and female) or 14 days

 (males) and then underwent the FST as described above (the design was between subjects; 
mice tested at 5 days were never retested at 14 days).
Chronic Mild Stress (CMS)—Female BALB mice were exposed to a series of stressors 
that varied daily and repeated weekly, as described previously (Opal et al. 2013). Following 
6 weeks of stress, mice were surgically implanted with minipumps delivering vehicle, 
10mg/kg/day pBBG, or 10mg/kg/day MeGFN. Mice continued to receive stressors 
following surgery. After 5 days of drug treatment, coat state (see supplemental methods) was 
evaluated, followed by the sucrose preference test and finally the splash test (see 
supplemental methods). The next day, mice underwent the FST. Non-stressed control 
animals were housed in a separate room under standard housing conditions and received 
only vehicle treatment. Thus, there were 4 groups: unstressed + VEH, stressed + VEH, 
stressed + pBBG, and stressed + MeGFN.
In a follow up control experiment, mice were subjected to the conditions of the unstressed 
VEH treated mice (described above), but then received minipumps delivering VEH, pBBG 
(10mg/kg/day) or MeGFN (10mg/kg/day) for 5 days. After 5 days of treatment, coat state 
was evaluated, followed by the sucrose preference test, splash test and FST using identical 
procedures to the previous groups. (above) To determine whether chronic inhibitor treatment 
produces any possibly confounding effects on motor behaviors, these mice were also 
evaluated with the OFT, balance beam, and grip strength tests on the day following FST (see 
supplemental methods).
Olfactory Bulbectomy (OBX)—Male B6 or female BALB mice underwent OBX or 
sham surgery as described previously18. Following surgery, mice were allowed to recover for 
14 days after which minipumps containing 0 or 10 mg/kg/day pBBG or 0 or 10 mg/kg/day 
MeGFN were implanted. Five days after minipump implantation, mice were placed into 
OFT for 30 minutes to assess locomotor hyperactivity.
Western Blots
Westerns were performed as previously described6,18. Briefly, 1.5mm tissue punches were 
taken from mPFC or hippocampus. Membranes were probed with primary antibodies against 
pCREB, CREB, BDNF, and α-tubulin, and then labeled with peroxidase-conjugated 
secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Additional details can be found in 
supplemental methods.
Brain concentration of MeGFN
We have shown previously that i.p. injection with pBBG increases MG levels in the brain 
(Distler et al., 2012). To confirm that MeGFN also acts centrally, we assayed MeGFN 
concentration in brain tissue at 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes after i.p. injection (see 
supplemental methods).

 Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed using ANOVA or Student’s t-test. Holm-Sidak post hoc tests (Glantz 
2005) were used to determine which doses yielded significantly different responses. All data 
appeared to be normally distributed and variance across groups appeared to be similar.
Methodological details
Outliers were removed if they were greater than two standard deviations from the mean, this 
standard was applied to all studies and was predetermined (see Supplemental Methods for an 
exhaustive list of outliers that were removed). p-values <0.05 were considered significant 
and are for two-sided tests unless specifically indicated. With the exception of the Holm-
Sidak post hoc tests, we did not correct for multiple testing. For figures that use histograms, 
data represent the mean ± standard error. Sample sizes were determined based on the 
availability of mice of the appropriate strain, genotype, sex and age. Beyond this we used 
our experience with similar studies to determine the sample sizes. In some cases, data from 
multiple iterations of the same study were combined to obtain the final sample size, in those 
instances additional animals were sometimes added only if analyses of preliminary data 
were not significant. No specific procedure was used to assign mice to different 
pharmacological treatments, however mice were inbred and should have been equivalent in 
every way, we did counterbalance known differences such as age, sex and genotype (KD or 
TG); for studies comparing mice of different genotypes randomization of genotype was 
inherent to the design. Some behavioral studies were scored by a computer, for studies 
scored by human observers, the observer was blind to the genotype and/or treatment of the 
mice. Neither the genetic manipulations (KD, TG) not the doses of pBBG and MeGFN used 
in this study altered behavior to an extent that they would have unblended the observer.
Results
TST
In the TST, Glo1KD mice showed significantly less immobility than their WT littermates 
(F(1,44)=7.447, p<0.01; Fig. 1A). There was no significant effect of sex on immobility nor 
was there a significant interaction between sex and genotype. IP injection of pBBG 50 
mg/kg significantly reduced immobility in B6 (F(1,20)=12.022, p<0.01; Fig. 1B) and FVB 
mice (FVB F(1,39)=4.642, p<0.05; Fig. 1C). There was no effect of sex on immobility nor 
was there an interaction between treatment and sex in either B6 or FVB mice. In contrast, 
the same dose of pBBG was not sufficient to reduce immobility in the TST in transgenic 
Glo1 overexpressing mice on a B6 background, presumably because of their increased 
enzymatic capacity (Supplemental Fig. 7). A second GLO1 inhibitor, MeGFN also reduced 
immobility in the TST in male B6 mice (F(3, 51)=3.186, p<0.05; Fig. 1D and Supplemental 
Fig. 1). Posthoc tests revealed that MeGFN significantly reduced immobility at 12.5 and 25 
mg/kg (p<0.05), while there was a non-significant trend at 50 mg/kg (p=0.067).
Acute FST
GLO1KD mice also showed significantly less immobility than littermate WT mice in the 
FST (F(1,48)=4.15, p<0.05; Fig. 1E). There was no significant effect of sex on immobility

 nor was there a significant interaction between treatment and sex (p>0.05). pBBG 
significantly reduced immobility in all 3 inbred mouse strains (B6: F(1,29)=3.681, p<0.05, 
Fig. 1F; FVB: F(1, 43)=10.105, p<0.01, Fig. 1G; BALB: F(1,58)=10.989, p<0.01, Fig. 1H). 
There was no significant effect of sex on immobility nor was there a significant interaction 
between treatment and sex in B6 or BALB mice (p>0.05); although there was a significant 
effect of sex in FVB mice (F(1,43)=7.895, p<0.01), but the interaction between sex and 
treatment was not significant. MeGFN also reduced immobility in FST (F(1,36)=7.803, 
p<0.01; Fig. 1I) in male B6 mice.
cFST
After 14 days of treatment with pBBG (0, 5, 10 or 15mg/kg/day), there was a significant 
effect of treatment on the cFST in male BALB mice (F(3,93)=3.926, p<0.05, Fig. 2A). Post 
hoc testing indicated that the 5 and 10 mg/kg/day doses significantly reduced immobility 
(p’s<0.05), while 15 mg/kg/day showed a nearly significant trend towards a reduction in 
immobility compared to vehicle (p=0.056). We did not observe any effect on body weight 
(data not shown; F(3, 93)=1.095, p>0.05) of mice treated for 14 days with pBBG. In a 
separate cohort of male BALB mice treated with FLX in the drinking water we confirmed 
that 14 days of treatment with FLX reduced immobility (t=1.996, p<0.05 by one-tailed t-
test, Fig. 2B).
These same animals were also tested in the OFT prior to cFST to determine whether they 
showed anxiolytic or general locomotor effects after 12 days of treatment. There was a 
significant effect of treatment with pBBG on center duration, reflecting the expected 
anxiolytic effect (F(3, 90)=4.267 p<0.01, Supplemental Fig. 2A). Post hoc tests revealed that 
10 mg/kg/day significantly increased center duration compared to VEH treatment (p<0.01); 
no other doses showed significant effects. None of the doses of pBBG altered general 
locomotor activity in the OFT (F(3, 94)=0.334 p>0.05, Supplemental Fig. 2B). Based on the 
significant reductions in depression-like and anxiety-like behaviors in the cFST and OFT 
studies, and the lack of any confounding differences in general locomotor behavior, we 
chose to treat mice with 10 mg/kg/day pBBG in subsequent studies.
Next, we investigated subchronic (5 day) treatment with pBBG in cFST to determine 
whether GLO1 inhibition might have a faster onset of antidepressant effects versus FLX. 
Because male and female BALB mice were tested separately, we performed separate 
analyses. There was a significant effect of treatment in both male (F(2,38)=4.526, p<0.05, 
Fig. 2C) and female (F(2,41)=4.775, p<0.05, Fig. 2D) mice. Post hoc tests confirmed that 5 
days of treatment with pBBG (p’s<0.05) but not 5 days of treatment with FLX (p’s>0.05) 
reduced immobility compared to the vehicle treatment. There was also a trend towards an 
increase in center duration in the OFT following subchronic treatment with pBBG and FLX 
(F(2,42)=3.107, p=0.056, Supplemental Fig. 3A & 3C). In the OFT, FLX but not pBBG, 
significantly increased locomotor activity compared to VEH (p<0.05).
In a separate cohort of mice, we examined the effect of 5 days of MeGFN treatment (5, 10 
and 15 mg/kg/day) on immobility in the cFST used female BALB mice. There was 
significant effect of treatment on immobility (F(3,58) =2.794, p<0.05; Fig. 2E). Post hoc 
tests revealed 10 and 15 mg/kg/day MeGFN reduced immobility in the cFST (p<0.05); there

 was a non-significant trend of reduced immobility following 5 mg/kg/day (p=0.061). There 
were no significant effects of 4 days of MeGFN treatment on center duration or locomotor 
activity in the OFT (F(3,56)=1.568, p>0.05; F(3,57)=0.24, p>0.05, Supplemental Fig. 3B & 
3D). We chose the 10 mg/kg/day dose of MeGFN for subsequent studies because it was 
effective in the cFST and had no confounding effects on general locomotor activity.
CMS
CMS is a commonly used model of depression-like behavior that responds to chronic but not 
subchronic treatment with classical antidepressants21. Following CMS and treatment with 
VEH, pBBG (10 mg/kg/day) or MeGFN (10 mg/kg/day) for 5 days, we performed the 
sucrose preference test, which is intended to model anhedonia, which is a common symptom 
of depression in humans. There was no significant effect of group on sucrose preference 
(F(3,47)=0.546 p>0.05, Fig. 3A) or total consumption (F(3,59)=1.858 p>0.05, not shown). 
Because stress did not have the expected effect on sucrose preference, the failure of pBBG 
or MeGFN to ameliorate the effects of stress on sucrose preference are difficult to interpret.
Following CMS and 5 days of treatment with pBBG (10 mg/kg/day) or MeGFN (10 mg/kg/
day), there was a significant effect of group in the FST (F(3,52)=2.94 p<0.05, Fig. 3B). Post 
hoc tests revealed that stress increased immobility relative to unstressed mice (Stressed VEH 
vs unstressed VEH; p<0.05); no other between group comparisons were significant, which 
we interpreted as evidence that both GLO1 inhibitors blocked the effects of stress on the 
FST. There was also a significant effect of group on coat state (F(3, 59)=5.713 p<0.01, Fig. 
3C). Stress led to a significantly deteriorated coat state (indicated by an increased score) 
compared to unstressed mice (p<0.001), which was improved by treatment with either 
pBBG (p<0.05 vs stressed VEH) or MeGFN (p<0.05 vs stressed VEH). We also performed 
the splash test and found a significant effect of group on the number of grooming bouts 
(F(3,59)=3.194 p<0.05, Supplemental Fig. 4A). Post hoc tests revealed that stressed mice 
had fewer bouts relative to unstressed mice (p<0.05), but there were no differences between 
stressed mice treated with vehicle and stressed mice treated with either pBBG or MeGFN 
(p>0.05). Finally, there were no group effects on the total duration of grooming 
(F(3,56)=0.396 p>0.05, Supplemental Fig. 4B) or the latency to begin grooming 
(F(3,55)=1.914 p=0.139, Supplemental Fig. 4C).
In a follow up study, mice were subjected to the conditions the unstressed VEH treated mice 
experienced in the CMS study and then treated with VEH, pBBG (10 mg/kg/day) or 
MeGFN (10 mg/kg/day) for 5 days. There was no effect of treatment on sucrose preference 
(F(2,36)=2.765; p>0.05; Supplemental Fig. 5a) or coat state (F(2, 38)=0.0627; p>0.05; 
Supplemental Fig. 5b). In the FST, there were no main effects of treatment, but there was a 
significant interaction between treatment and time (F(6,155)=2.402; p=0.032; Supplemental 
Fig. 5c). Post hoc tests revealed a significant effect of MeGFN and pBBG on immobility in 
the last minute of the FST (p<0.05, one-tailed). There were no effects of treatment on the 
splash test (bouts: F(2,38)=0.0246; p>0.05; latency: F(2,38)=0.0886; p>0.05; duration: F(2, 
38)=0.0592; p>0.05; Supplemental Fig. 5d–f). We also tested the mice for ataxia and 
locomotor depression. There was no effect of treatment on the balance beam (Footslips: 
F(2,38)=0.027; p>0.05; Supplemental Fig. 6a) or general locomotor behavior in the OFT 
McMurray et al.

 (F(2,38)=0.834; p>0.05 Supplemental Fig. 6b), and no gross deficits in grip strength as 
measured by the vertical pole test (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that in 
the absence of stress, both GLO1 inhibitors had the expted effect on the FST, but did not 
affect sucrose preference, coat state or the splash test; furthermore, these 5 days of treatment 
with these GLO1 inhibitors had no more general effects on ataxia, general locomotor 
activity or grip strength.
OBX
We found that pBBG reversed OBX-induced hyperactivity in both male B6 (Fig. 4A) and 
female BALB mice (Fig. 4B). There was a significant interaction between OBX and 
treatment in male B6 mice (F(1,47)=4.927; p<0.05). Post hoc tests revealed a trend towards 
pBBG reducing locomotor hyperactivity in the OBX group (p=0.07), while there was no 
effect of pBBG in SHAM operated animals (p>0.05). There was also a significant 
interaction between OBX and pBBG treatment in female BALB mice (F(1,45)=4.506 
p<0.05). Post hoc tests revealed that pBBG reduced hyperactivity in the OBX group 
(p<0.01) but not in the SHAM group (p>0.05). We also found that MeGFN attenuated OBX-
induced hyperactivity in male B6 mice (Fig. 4C). There were significant main effects of 
OBX (F(1,44)=66.985 p<0.001) and treatment (F(1,44)=6.624 p<0.05), but not the 
interaction between OBX and treatment. However, when we performed a priori post hoc 
testing we found that MeGFN significantly reduced locomotor activity within OBX 
(p<0.05), but not SHAM mice (p>0.05).
Western Blots
Finally, we examined whether pBBG treatment could upregulate BDNF and the ratio of 
pCREB to CREB (pCREB/CREB) in the hippocampus and mPFC, which are associated 
with antidepressant onset (Duman and Voleti 2012; Browne and Lucki 2013; Opal et al. 
2013). There was a significant effect of treatment on BDNF expression in the hippocampus 
(F(2,27)=3.87, p<0.05, Fig. 5A) and mPFC (F(2, 29)=7.577, p<0.01, Fig. 5B). Post hoc tests 
revealed that 5-days of pBBG treatment (10 mg/kg/day) significantly upregulated BDNF in 
both mPFC and hippocampus compared to VEH (mPFC: p<0.01; hippocampus: p<0.05). In 
contrast, BDNF levels following 5-days of FLX treatment were not different from vehicle 
for either brain region (p>0.05). There was also a significant effect of treatment on the ratio 
of pCREB/CREB in the hippocampus (F(2,29)=3.781; p<0.05, Fig. 5C) and mPFC 
(F(2,29)=5.576; p<0.01, Fig. 5D). In the hippocampus, pCREB/CREB levels were 
upregulated following pBBG treatment compared to VEH (p<0.05), while there was a non-
significant trend of pBBG treatment compared to VEH in mPFC (p=0.071). Subchronic 
FLX treatment did not alter pCREB/CREB levels in either of these brain regions (p’s>0.05).
Brain concentration of MeGFN
We found that MeGFN was present in brain within minutes of i.p. injection and showed a 
halflife of 90.8 minutes. (Supplemental Fig. 8).

 Discussion
The present results show that inhibition of GLO1 has antidepressant-like effects in multiple 
acute and chronic preclinical paradigms. The use of both genetic and pharmacological tools 
to inhibit GLO1, including two chemically distinct GLO1 inhibitors, suggests that the effects 
are not due to non-specific effects of these treatments. Additionally, there were no locomotor 
effects in mice treated with pBBG or MeGFN, suggesting that these effects cannot be 
explained by hyper- or hypo-activity. In addition to the significance of identifying a novel 
mechanism for achieving anti-depressant effects, our results also indicate that manipulations 
of this system have the potential to produce fast acting antidepressant effects. Specifically, 
five days of GLO1 inhibition produced antidepressant effects in three tests sensitive to the 
timing of antidepressant onset: the cFST, CMS and OBX models. In contrast, our lab18–20,24 
and others21,25,26 have shown tricyclic and SSRI (e.g. FLX) antidepressants, have 
consistently been shown to require 14 days of treatment before they become effective in 
these tests. Finally, we showed that two molecular markers of the antidepressant response 
changed after chronic treatment with Glo1 inhibitors.
The most straightforward explanation for the observed antidepressant-like effects is that 
GLO1 inhibition increases MG concentrations; we have previously shown that MG is a 
competitive partial agonist at GABA-A receptors (Distler et al. 2012). GABA has been 
implicated in depression and the antidepressant response in a variety of ways. For example, 
depression is associated with reductions in cerebrospinal fluid GABA levels and the number 
of GABA-A receptors in cortical regions. Additionally, chronic antidepressant treatment 
correlates with an increase in GABA28,29, supporting a potential role for GABAergic 
signaling in depression30,31. Though not typically used to treat depression, numerous reports 
indicate antidepressant effects in humans and/or animal models with the benzodiazepine, 
alprazolam32,33, as well as both positive34–36 and negative modulators of GABA-A 
receptors37. Additionally, co-administration of eszopiclone (a preferential GABA-A partial 
agonist at α1, α2 and α3 subtypes) with FLX produced a greater antidepressant efficacy and 
a faster antidepressant onset in depressed patients than FLX alone38, suggesting that GABA-
A receptor activation may contribute to the rapid antidepressant response.
The effects of GLO1 inhibitors on GABAergic signaling is qualitatively distinct from any 
other GABA-A acting compounds. Inhibition of GLO1 will increase MG concentrations in 
proportion to local glycolytic activity39,40, thus tying GABAergic neuronal inhibition to 
local energy utilization. We have previously shown that MG easily crosses cell membranes6, 
indicating that it acts like a paracrine factor rather than as a neurotransmitter. Additionally, 
because MG acts as a competitive partial agonists at GABA-A receptors, modulation of MG 
concentrations by GLO1 inhibitors may have qualitatively different effects as compared to 
other GABA-A acting compounds, including potentially inhibition of GABA-A signaling 
when local endogenous GABA concentrations are high41,42. Indeed, common side effects of 
GABA-A receptor agonists and modulators are sedation and locomotor ataxia, yet we 
previously showed that 50mg/kg pBBG does not alter footslips on the balance beam test. 
Here, we also show that subchronic (5 day) treatment with GLO1 inhibitors (pBBG and 
MeGFN) has no effect on footslips on the balance beam, nor did either inhibitor decrease 
locomotor behavior in the OFT or affect grip strength in the vertical pole test.

 Increased BDNF levels in hippocampus and mPFC are associated with an antidepressant-
like response in behavioral models of depression, providing a biomarker that corroborates 
the onset of the behavioral effects (Duman and Monteggia, 2006; Polyakova et al., 2015). 
With traditional antidepressants, upregulation of BDNF requires 14–21 days of treatment, 
and occurs concurrently with the onset of antidepressant-like effects (Nubuya et al., 1995; 
Duman and Voleti 2012; Browne and Lucki 2013; Opal et al. 2013). In the present study, 
BDNF and pCREB/CREB were upregulated in the hippocampus and mPFC after just 5 days 
of pBBG treatment. This rapid elevation of BDNF and pCREB/CREB levels are consistent 
with other putative fast-onset antidepressants, including short-term treatment with 
ketamine43,44, serotonin2C receptor antagonists18, and a serotonin4 receptor agonist45. An 
increase in BDNF levels following GLO1 inhibition is also consistent with previous reports 
of upregulated BDNF expression in rat hippocampal cultures following incubation with 
MG46. However, this correlation does not prove causality and further studies are necessary 
to determine whether upregulation of BDNF and pCREB/CREB are necessary for the rapid 
onset of GLO1 inhibitor antidepressant-like activity.
We have previously shown that genetic and pharmacological GLO1 inhibition, as well as 
MG administration, are anxiolytic6, have anti-seizure effects47 and reduce ethanol 
consumption15. The current results show that GLO1 inhibition might provide a unique 
strategy for treating depression with comorbid anxiety, epilepsy or alcohol use disorders, 
which would constitute a unique class of therapeutic compounds and would address an 
urgent need given the high comorbidity of these disorders. Future mechanistic studied are 
needed to fully dissect the precise mechanism by which GLO1 inhibition alters depression-
like behavior. Finally, our findings suggest that modulation of GABA-A signaling may be a 
promising approach for the development of fast-acting, antidepressants.
