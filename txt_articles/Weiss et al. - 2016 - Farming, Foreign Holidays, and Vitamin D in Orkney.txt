Abstract
Orkney, north of mainland Scotland, has the world’s highest prevalence of multiple sclerosis
(MS); vitamin D deficiency, a marker of low UV exposure, is also common in Scotland.
Strong associations have been identified between vitamin D deficiency and MS, and
between UV exposure and MS independent of vitamin D, although causal relationships
remain to be confirmed. We aimed to compare plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in Ork-
ney and mainland Scotland, and establish the determinants of vitamin D status in Orkney.
We compared mean vitamin D and prevalence of deficiency in cross-sectional study data
from participants in the Orkney Complex Disease Study (ORCADES) and controls in the
Scottish Colorectal Cancer Study (SOCCS). We used multivariable regression to identify
factors associated with vitamin D levels in Orkney. Mean (standard deviation) vitamin D
was significantly higher among ORCADES than SOCCS participants (35.3 (18.0) and 31.7
(21.2), respectively). Prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency was lower in ORCADES
than SOCCS participants (6.6% to 16.2% p = 1.1 x 10−15). Older age, farming occupations
and foreign holidays were significantly associated with higher vitamin D in Orkney. Although
mean vitamin D levels are higher in Orkney than mainland Scotland, this masks variation
within the Orkney population which may influence MS risk.
Introduction
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, complex disease with genetic, environmental and behavioural
factors implicated in its aetiology [1]. Greater distance from the equator is associated with
increasing MS prevalence [2]; increasing latitude is also noted for weaker ultraviolet B (UVB)
radiation which inhibits cutaneous production of vitamin D [3]. As such, one environmental
risk factor is thought to be vitamin D deficiency, however, vitamin D is also a marker for expo-
sure to UV radiation, the benefits of which may be independent of vitamin D production [4–
6]. A variety of factors hinder or prevent UVB from reaching the earth's surface, including lati-
tude and weather [7], or from initiating cutaneous vitamin D synthesis, such as sun protection
creams and clothing cover.

 Although a recent systematic review of vitamin D status worldwide found that vitamin D
concentrations do not appear to be dependent upon latitude [8], exposure to ultraviolet B
(UVB) radiation from sunshine is the most potent source of vitamin D for humans [9]. In the
United States, a latitudinal relationship exists between wintertime vitamin D and wintertime
UV doses [10], likely resulting from the few days in which vitamin D can be produced at such
latitudes [3, 10]. This latitudinal relationship further reflects the latitudinal MS prevalence dis-
tribution in the US [10]. Additionally, a significant relationship between regional UVB radia-
tion and MS prevalence has been noted in France in the French farming population and their
families [11]. Increasing MS prevalence was associated with decreasing ambient UVB; the
trend was additionally found to be stronger in both wintertime and in women [11]. A similar
relationship between decreasing UV and increasing prevalence has been identified in New-
foundland [12] and Australia [13].
Controversy remains regarding the role of vitamin D in chronic conditions; whilst defi-
ciency may have a causal role in the aetiology of some diseases it may also simply be a bio-
marker for ill health. A body of evidence is however accumulating, suggesting a causal role for
vitamin D in MS risk, pathology and progression [14–16]. A recent Mendelian randomisation
study found genetically lowered 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level by one standard devia-
tion in log-transformed 25(OH)D was associated with a two-fold increased risk of MS [16].
Interactions between vitamin D and the major genetic risk factor, HLA-DRB1�1501, have been
identified [17], and several rare variants conferring MS risk have been found in the CYP27B1
gene, which encodes an enzyme which catalyses the conversion of 25(OH)D to the bioactive
form [18]. Further, early exposure to vitamin D in-utero and in neonatal mice led to optimal
numbers of invariant natural killer T cells [19], deficiency of which are observed in MS patients
[19, 20]. Alongside the month-of-birth effect, where children born after a winter gestation are
at higher risk of MS [21], the role of adequate in-utero vitamin D increasingly appears to be
critical for future autoimmunity.
The beneficial role of UV exposure independent of vitamin D production has been sup-
ported in animal studies, using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as the
model for MS. Continuous treatment with UVB was found to suppress clinical signs of EAE
which, although leading to slight elevations in serum 25(OH)D3, were insufficient to cause dis-
ease suppression by vitamin D [4]. Furthermore, suppression of EAE was found to occur upon
irradiation of mice to narrow-band UV light, with a wavelength of between 300 and 315 nm
and a peak of effectiveness at 311 nm. As vitamin D requires a wavelength between 270 and
300 nm, optimally between 295 and 300 nm to initiate cutaneous synthesis, the narrow band
UV supressing EAE had no effect on 25(OH)D levels [5], strongly suggesting a role of UV
exposure independent of vitamin D. In MS, an Australian multi-centre case-control study
found higher sun exposure and higher vitamin D levels to be independently associated with
lower risk for first demyelinating events [6].
Scotland, between latitudes 54° and 60° north, has inadequate strength of sunshine between
October and March for vitamin D synthesis [22]; a cloudy climate year-round further leads to
widespread vitamin D deficiency [23] strongly indicating limited UV exposure in the popula-
tion. The protective effect of supplementation and sunny holidays on 25(OH)D in Aberdeen, a
Scottish city at 57° north, has previously been noted in a study of postmenopausal women [24].
Orkney, an isolated archipelago ten to sixty miles from the north coast of Scotland, is an area
of exceptionally high MS prevalence [25]. Seventeen of the 70 islands are inhabited with a pre-
dominantly rural population totalling 21,349 at the 2011 census. The 2011 census also revealed
an ongoing agricultural tradition with 10% of the workforce employed in agriculture or fishing.
As an independent risk factor, or as a marker of UV exposure, it is important to understand
the determinants of plasma vitamin D in the context of MS and other diseases of public health

 importance. In this study we aimed to describe vitamin D levels in Orkney (Fig 1). This
involved identifying the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Orkney compared to the Scottish
mainland, and establishing the determinants of circulating plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25
(OH)D) in Orkney.
Methods and Materials
Study Populations
The study population comprised Orkney Complex Disease Study (ORCADES) participants,
recruited from 2005 to 2011, and Scottish Colorectal Cancer Study (SOCCS) controls, which
ran from 1999 to 2006. Both these studies have been described in detail elsewhere [26, 27].
Briefly, ORCADES, a cross-sectional genetic epidemiology study concerned with identifying
genetic factors that influence complex disease, comprised 2078 participants with at least one
Orcadian grandparent. SOCCS, a case-control study of colorectal cancer in Scotland, included
2235 adult controls without colorectal cancer, identified from the Community Health Index in
Scotland as being aged within 5 years their matched case, of the same sex and living in the
same area. All participants provided written, informed consent prior to participation. Both
studies have ethical approval from NHS Orkney, NHS Grampian or NHS Lothian.
25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement
Fasting blood samples were drawn from ORCADES participants using the Sarstedt Monovette
system. Samples were processed and transferred for storage at -400 C, and later -800 C, until
analysis. Blood was drawn from all SOCCS participants, processed and transferred for storage
at -800 C. Both studies ran over multiple years, and therefore measures per month comprise
blood drawn in multiple Januarys, multiple Februarys and so on.
Vitamin D status is determined by measuring circulating 25(OH)D which is generally con-
sidered the best indicator of vitamin D status [28]. Both 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 were mea-
sured using the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. The
total of the two measures was taken for total circulating 25(OH)D, however most samples from

 both studies contained no 25(OH)D2. The lower limit of detection using LC-MS/MS was 10
nmol/L. All samples were measured in the same laboratory following standard protocols; qual-
ity control procedures were performed according to current best evidence for 25(OH)D mea-
surement in population studies [29].
A range of cut-offs to define sufficiency and deficiency have been proposed, however in line
with other recent studies we considered circulating 25(OH)D of 50 nmol/L or over to be suffi-
cient [30], 25 to 50 nmol/L to be at risk of deficiency or insufficient, and deficiency to be less
than 25 nmol/L [31]. We additionally explored those at the lower end of deficiency, where we
considered circulating 25(OH)D below 12.5 nmol/L to be severely deficient [32].
Lifestyle factors
ORCADES participants attended clinics where several biometric measures were recorded. Each
participant also completed a medical and lifestyle questionnaire from which vitamin D intake,
physical activity (PA) and socioeconomic status (SES) were derived.
BMI was calculated as kg/m2 and treated as a continuous variable. Height was taken without
shoes and weight wearing only light clothing. Based on questionnaire data we derived a variable
encompassing work and leisure time PA throughout the year. Participants classified leisure
activity as either 1) light (mostly sitting, light housework) or 2) moderate exercise; and likewise
work activity as 1) mostly sitting, 2) mostly standing, 3) manual work or 4) heavy manual
work. Dietary vitamin D intake was estimated from two self-administered food frequency ques-
tionnaires, the cardiovascular disease questionnaire (CVDQ) and bone density questionnaire
(BDQ). The CVDQ was treated as the primary source due to the higher response rate, however
information contained in the BDQ that was not present in the CVDQ was merged to create the
most comprehensive variable possible. Further, a research nurse-administered drug question-
naire sought information about medications and dietary supplements. Participants also
described their frequency of taking holidays within or outside the UK (never, less than once a
year, once a year, more than once a year). Although the Scottish Index for Multiple Deprivation
(SIMD) is available for Orkney, the scattered and heterogeneous population means that con-
centrations of poverty or affluence are difficult to identify; moreover neighbouring islands are
grouped together in units thus there is little discrimination [33]. Principal Components Analy-
sis (PCA) is a statistical technique to reduce a number of variables into a few independent
dimensions reflecting the underlying patterns in the data, and was used here to construct SES
indices [34]. To establish a variable that differentiates between individuals, three SES variables
were thereby derived from 10 questionnaire items with significant loadings in PCA (S1 Table).
Additionally, we applied an occupational prestige score to questionnaire occupation informa-
tion which was then included in the PCA [35]. Holidays, car age and council tax band loaded
significantly onto the first component; housing tenure, length of car ownership and highest
qualification loaded significantly onto the second component, and job prestige score, years in
education and supervisory role at work loaded significantly onto the third. This third compo-
nent captures “non-traditional” lifestyles reflecting managerial, administrative and professional
positions in contrast to traditional agricultural work. Time outside in summer was summed
from participants’ estimates of average time spent without a roof covering on summer work
and leisure days. Data from SOCCS included age, sex, month of blood sample and 25(OH)D
measurement.
Statistical analysis
We matched the ORCADES and SOCCS datasets on age to within two years (Table 1) to
remove any differences arising from age structures. Matching was carried out blind excepting

 dataset of origin and age. Because of the large effect of season on vitamin D levels, we standard-
ised 25(OH)D measurements to the month of May; values obtained thereby represent those
that would be expected if every sample were drawn in May [32]. The mean of monthly means
in the mainland Scottish data is 34.4 nmol/L; in the Orcadian data the mean of monthly means
is 37.7 nmol/L. The May means are 33.8 nmol/L and 35.5 nmol/L, respectively. We used May-
standardised measurements for all analyses concerned with determinants of vitamin D, and
also to compare Orkney and mainland Scotland in deficiency levels. For analyses concerned
with vitamin D and time of year we used crude 25(OH)D measures. Data are presented as
mean (standard deviation).
We plotted crude 25(OH)D by location as a density plot and by month, and compared
using a t-test. We compared vitamin D by age group using t-tests. To compare levels of defi-
ciency in Orkney and mainland Scotland, we divided participants into groups of deficiency and
plotted May-adjusted vitamin D for each deficiency group and location and tested for differ-
ences using chi-square tests.
For determinants of May-adjusted 25(OH)D in Orkney, we ran a series of bivariable models
of May-adjusted 25(OH)D against environmental and demographic variables of interest.
Those that were significant were put into a multivariable model. These significant variables
comprised BMI, age at venepuncture, foreign holidays, PA, SES, dietary vitamin D and working
status. Sex was also a covariate. A large percentage of missing data (S2 Table) was imputed
using Multiple Imputation of Chained Equations (MICE)[36] after excluding 28 individuals
with missing outcome data. We ran 68 cycles of 100 imputations and pooled the results in a lin-
ear regression model. We ran the same model using complete cases only. Statistical tests were
two-sided with p<0.05 taken as significant. Finally, we applied a one-way ANOVA to compare
mean May-adjusted 25(OH)D across the three groups of participants that we identified as a
result of our analyses.
We assessed homoscedasticity by inspection of a QQ plot, and distribution of residuals
using a histogram with superimposed normal curve. Independence was checked using the Dur-
bin Watson statistic, multicollinearity and outliers using the vif statistic and Cook’s distance,
respectively. All analyses were conducted using R software version 3.2.0 [37].
Results
For this study, 64 individuals were excluded from ORCADES who were not resident in Orkney,
10 who had MS, as well as 8 duplicate measures. Characteristics of ORCADES participants are
presented in Table 2. Twenty-three people were excluded from the Scottish Colorectal Cancer

 Study who lived above the 57th degree of latitude. For comparison analyses, data were age-
matched giving a final count of 1453 people in each dataset.
Using age-matched data we compared mean 25(OH)D in Orkney to mainland Scotland
(Fig 2). Orkney had significantly higher crude 25(OH)D than mainland Scotland (Orkney
35.3 (18.01), Mainland 31.7 (21.18), t(2800) = -4. 93, p = 8.5 x 10−7). Mean 25(OH)D was
higher in Orkney for every month except August when the mainland peaks at ~50 nmol/L.
The distribution of vitamin D levels is shifted to the right in Orkney (Fig 3). We compared
vitamin D in Orkney and mainland Scotland by age group (Table 3). Results for each age
group are significantly different, however in the under 40s, 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 age groups,
mainland Scotland has higher vitamin D, whilst in the 60 to 69 and over 70s age groups, Ork-
ney has significantly higher vitamin D. Comparing Orkney with the mainland by deficiency
group, we found that more people in Orkney had insufficient vitamin D, χ2 (1, N = 2863) =
30.3, p = 3.8 x 10−8; however, Orkney had significantly fewer people with circulating 25(OH)
D of <12.5nmol/L (severely deficient) compared with the mainland, χ2 (1, N = 2863) = 64.3,
p = 1.1 x 10−15 (Fig 4).
To explore correlates of vitamin D in Orkney we ran two multivariable regression analyses,
using both imputed data and complete cases. Each model yielded similar results (Table 4). Var-
iables significantly associated with higher 25(OH)D included lower BMI, more foreign holi-
days, older age and increased PA. Associated with lower 25(OH)D was the “non-traditional”
SES grouping.

 The association between older age and higher vitamin D required further exploration; we
began by comparing foreign holiday-takers and their non-holidaying counterparts. We found
that people over 50 were significantly more likely to take foreign holidays at least once a year
compared to people under 50 (Table 5, Fig 5) (χ2(1) = 6.4, p = 0.0083). We termed this the
‘Saga’ effect. Additionally, we found that foreign holidays had a stronger effect on people over
50 who had their blood drawn in the low vitamin D (weaker UVB) season (October to March)
Fig 2. Mean crude vitamin D concentration (nmol/L) per month by location, using age-matched data. Orkney’s mean vitamin D
is higher than the mainland for every month except August and November. Each study ran over consecutive years and measurements
taken in the same month each year were pooled.

 compared with people who had their blood drawn in the high vitamin D (stronger UVB) sea-
son (April to September) (Table 6).
To explore under-40s further, we ran the same analyses comparing those who do and do
not holiday outside the UK that were used for over-50s (S3 Table). The same results were sig-
nificant, excepting body fat percentage, socio-economic status 2, age, and summer minutes
spent outside.

 We also identified a ‘farmer effect’ (Table 7). Participants employed in “traditional” agricul-
tural occupations that kept them outdoors had significantly higher mean vitamin D levels than
participants in non-traditional professions that kept them indoors (farmers 36.9 (18.0), non-
farmers 33.8 (11.8), t(383) = 2.46, p = 0.014). Further, farmers tended to be older.
To test for differences in mean vitamin D across the ‘Saga’ group, farmers, and non-farmers
who are under 50 and do not take foreign holidays, we did a one-way ANOVA. This ANOVA

occur in the severely deficient group (<12.5 nmol/L) which has significantly fewer people from the Orkney sample (χ2(1) = 64.2,
p = 1.10 x 10−15), and the ‘at risk’ category (25-<50 nmol/L) which has significantly fewer people from the mainland Scottish sample
(χ2(1) = 30.3, p = 3.78 x 10−8).

 was significant: Welch's F(2, 481.99) = 54.49, p = 2.2 x 10−16, and we therefore concluded that
vitamin D varies significantly across these groups with people over 50 who take foreign holi-
days having higher vitamin D than farmers, who had higher vitamin D than non-farmers and
people under 50 who remain in the UK (Fig 6).
Discussion
We aimed to compare vitamin D levels in Orkney and mainland Scotland, and to identify the
determinants of Orkney vitamin D. Definitions of vitamin D deficiency are much discussed,
however it has been proposed that circulating 25(OH)D above 50 nmol/L are sufficient [30,
38]. Vitamin D status in Scotland has been previously explored [32]. Deficient and high risk
individuals comprised 63.4% in the previous study; in our Orkney dataset deficient and high
risk individuals comprised 65.3%. However, people with severe deficiency (<12.5 nmol/L)
comprised 11.8% of the former study and only 5.0% of the latter. Therefore although perhaps
initially surprising that mean vitamin D was higher in Orkney despite the higher latitude, the
smaller percentage of people with severe deficiency in Orkney led to this elevation. In both
datasets the majority are either deficient or at risk of deficiency which could have significant
health implications [9].
Ability to synthesise vitamin D decreases with age [39]; it is well established that older age is
associated with lower vitamin D and increased deficiency risk [32, 40]. However, we found that
lifestyle factors particular to Orkney contributed to better vitamin D in older compared to
younger people.

Vitamin D in Orkney

 Participants who took foreign holidays had higher vitamin D than those who did not take
foreign holidays; furthermore, taking foreign holidays increased by age group. Less than 20%
of under-40s in our Orkney sample took foreign holidays, whereas over 30% in the 70 and over
group reported leaving the UK at least once a year. Weak sunshine within the UK leads to
fewer opportunities for UV exposure and UVB-mediated vitamin D synthesis, and the effect of
foreign holiday sun exposure has been previously associated with improved vitamin D in Scot-
land [24]. Orkney mean vitamin D remained higher than mainland Scotland throughout the
year with the exception of two months: August and November. Although we were unable to
explore this further, mainland Scotland’s August elevation of vitamin D could be attributed to
the effect of holidays, following one month after school holidays. In November, however, main-
land Scotland’s mean vitamin D levels were only minimally higher than Orkney. We found
that mean vitamin D in people 50 and over taking foreign holidays was significantly higher
than vitamin D levels in the rest of the sample. Foreign holidays contributed more to vitamin
D levels on blood drawn in months of weaker UVB. We were unable to explore at what time of
year people take holidays, however this finding suggests that foreign holidays become more
important as a source of UV exposure and therefore vitamin D for Orkney residents in winter.
As older people tend to have more freedom to travel outside peak season, they are able to derive
most benefit by seeking sun in seasons of scarce sunshine in Orkney. People over 50 who take
foreign holidays were found to differ from those who do not take holidays mainly in variables
denoting financial security. They were also more likely to have lower BMI and body fat per-
centage suggesting possible healthier lifestyles than their non-holidaying counterparts.

 We also examined under 40s, the age group in which MS is most likely to be diagnosed and
pregnancies are most likely to occur, thereby potentially conferring risk to the unborn child. In
this group, we found that the main differences in those who do or do not take holidays out of
the UK are related to financial security. Only 75 of the 400 people who are under 40 reported
leaving the UK for a holiday at least once a year, therefore, in the most at-risk group, inade-
quate UV exposure in Orkney is compounded by a low prevalence of foreign holidays.
The ‘non-traditional’ SES group derived from PCA, comprising job prestige score, educa-
tion years and supervisory role at work, was associated with vitamin D. These variables, reflect-
ing “non-traditional” lifestyles of managerial, administrative and professional occupations in
contrast to traditional agricultural work, related to farmers and non-farmers. Farmers were
found to be slightly less educated, possibly as a result of leaving school at the minimum leaving
age about half a year to a year before the first set of examinations. Farmers were also less likely
to describe themselves as having a supervisory role at work than non-farmers, and also had a
slightly lower-than-average job prestige score. The inverse association between vitamin D and
a higher score in this variable means that farmers, who scored lower, had better vitamin D.
Farmers in our cohort were also more likely to be older than non-farmers, further contributing
to our finding of vitamin D increasing with age.
Physical inactivity and obesity have previously been related to low vitamin D in a large
American cohort [41]; the association between lower BMI and higher 25(OH)D is also well
established [42]. The mechanism for lower vitamin D in the presence of higher BMI is thought
to be a result of increased deposition of vitamin D in body fat [43], making BMI a proxy for
adiposity. However, BMI does not distinguish between body fat and fat free mass, and is not

 always a reliable indicator of adiposity in people with lower body fat but greater muscle mass
[44]. The farmers in our cohort reflected this difficulty: they had lower body fat percentage but
higher BMI than non-farmers. We found farmers were more active and leaner than non-farm-
ers and it is perhaps therefore fair to assume they have higher than average muscle mass. Nev-
ertheless, in the multivariable models BMI followed what is expected.
Farmers had mean vitamin D significantly higher than non-farmers, but significantly lower
than people over 50 who take foreign holidays. Summer minutes outside was not significant in
the multivariable analyses, however we performed a t-test for farmers versus non farmers and
time spent outside. Farmers, perhaps unsurprisingly, were found to spend significantly more
time outside than non-farmers which enables maximisation of even the smallest window of
vitamin-D strength sunshine. Although Zgaga et al. found higher vitamin D consumption led
to slight improvements in plasma vitamin D [32], we found that diet was not associated with
vitamin D in Orkney. However, difficulties involved in building a variable with the available
data likely contributed to this finding.
Both studies were recruited on an ‘opt in’ basis which may result in the samples representing
a healthier than average population; however a strength of this study was the large number of

 participants in each cohort. Particularly novel was the number of farmers in our Orkney
cohort, enabling us to explore vitamin D in a select group within a rural population which is
not often studied. All vitamin D samples from both cohorts were analysed in the same labora-
tory using the same procedures, helping maintain consistency and reliability of results. We had
access to a variety of detailed measures to explore vitamin D in Orkney; however data on time
spent outside and vitamin D intake were somewhat limited and these may thus be more
strongly implicated in vitamin D than we were able to detect. Nevertheless, we found signifi-
cant effects and reliable relationships for vitamin D with foreign holidays, BMI, physical activ-
ity and age.
Conclusion
Mean vitamin D in Orkney was higher than mainland Scotland, driven largely by a lower per-
centage of individuals with severe deficiency in Orkney. Overall concentrations in both cohorts
were low with most people either deficient or at risk of deficiency, suggesting that UV exposure
for much of the year is low. Older Orkney residents were more likely to have better vitamin D
than younger residents, largely resulting from the ‘Saga’ and ‘Farmer’ effects. Those most at
risk of deficiency in Orkney were under 40, an age group traditionally considered at lower risk
of deficiency, but at increased risk of MS diagnosis. Within these main child-bearing years, a
lack of UV exposure and vitamin D deficiency may result in significant autoimmune implica-
tions for offspring. The significant contribution of foreign holidays to Orkney vitamin D is
consistent with the findings of previous UK studies; the importance of foreign holidays in pro-
viding adequate UV exposure to UK residents is underappreciated. We have found that youn-
ger ages are more at risk from inadequate UV exposure and vitamin D deficiency in Orkney, a
county with a very high prevalence of MS. Further research exploring the relationship between
vitamin D and quantitatively-measured exposure to UV radiation from sunshine and physical
activity, as well as more detailed dietary information in Shetland, the most northerly UK
county with an MS prevalence lower than Orkney, would help further elucidate the roles of UV
exposure and vitamin D as MS risk factors in these islands.
