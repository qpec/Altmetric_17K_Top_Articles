Abstract
In a webinar in 2015 on health financing and gender, the question was raised why we need to focus
on gender, given that a well-functioning system moving towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC)
will automatically be equitable and gender balanced. This article provides a reflection on this ques-
tion from a panel of health financing and gender experts.
We trace the evidence of how health-financing reforms have impacted gender and health access through
a general literature review and a more detailed case-study of India. We find that unless explicit attention
is paid to gender and its intersectionality with other social stratifications, through explicit protection and
careful linking of benefits to needs of target populations (e.g. poor women, unemployed men, female-
headed households), movement towards UHC can fail to achieve gender balance or improve equity, and
may even exacerbate gender inequity. Political trade-offs are made on the road to UHC and the needs of
less powerful groups, which can include women and children, are not necessarily given priority.
We identify the need for closer collaboration between health economists and gender experts, and
highlight a number of research gaps in this field which should be addressed. While some aspects
of cost sharing and some analysis of expenditure on maternal and child health have been analysed
from a gender perspective, there is a much richer set of research questions to be explored to guide
policy making. Given the political nature of UHC decisions, political economy as well as technical
research should be prioritized.
We conclude that countries should adopt an equitable approach towards achieving UHC and,
therefore, prioritize high-need groups and those requiring additional financial protection, in particu-
lar women and children. This constitutes the ‘progressive universalism’ advocated for by the 2013
Lancet Commission on Investing in Health.

Introduction
The world is rallying round Universal Health Coverage (UHC) as a
common health goal, whereby everybody receives the quality health
services they need without suffering financial hardship (WHO 2010a).
UHC has been incorporated as a sub-goal within the overall health
Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agreed at the special UN devel-
opment summit in September 2015 (United Nations 2015). Many of
the leading health agencies (including WHO and the World Bank) are
promoting UHC as the best strategy to achieve the overall health SDG.
UHC is built on the notion of equity (United Nations 2015).
First, the universal aspect of the concept clearly indicates that every-
body should be covered—nobody should be left behind. Second, it
states that health services should be allocated according to people’s
needs, which implies that people with higher needs (e.g. pregnant

 women, young children and the chronically sick) should receive
more services than others. Finally, the financial protection compo-
nent of UHC implies that people’s financial contributions towards
funding health services should be according to their ability to pay.
UHC, therefore, requires that healthy and wealthy members of soci-
ety cross-subsidise services for the sick, the vulnerable and the poor.
One only has to look at health indicators across the world to see
that we are a long way from achieving this goal. The World Bank
and WHO have estimated that around 400 million people lack ac-
cess to basic health services, and that 6% of people in low- and
middle-income countries are tipped into or pushed further into ex-
treme
poverty
because
of
health
spending
(World
health
Organization 2015). Also, it is clear in many countries large inequal-
ities in health outcomes and service coverage rates persist between
different population groups, indicating that the equity principles en-
trenched in UHC are not being fulfilled (Ruger and Kim 2006;
Oxfam 2013). In disaggregating health coverage data, one group
which is often shown to be disadvantaged are women, who through
their life-cycle often have greater healthcare needs than men but
who, due to economic inequalities, often have a lower ability to pay
for services (World Health Organization 2016). According to the
definition of UHC, many women ought to be the beneficiaries of
cross-subsidies from more privileged groups in society in accessing
health services, but this is clearly not happening at sufficient scale
(Nanda 2002; Oxfam 2013).
Achieving genuine universal health coverage ought to help re-
duce these inequalities, and will, therefore, not only represent a
means to achieve the health SDG but also to make progress towards
SDG 5 on achieving gender equity. It is, therefore, to be welcomed
that the world is now committed to UHC; however, how this is
achieved is vitally important as some routes are likely to be more
equitable than others in closing gender gaps in coverage. As coun-
tries plan and implement strategies to reach UHC they will need to
address a broad range of systems reforms, involving all of the health
systems ‘building blocks’ identified by WHO (WHO 2007) includ-
ing governance, health care financing, health workforce, medical
products and technologies, information and research, and service de-
livery. However, as WHO identified itself in its World Health
Report in 2010, the area that is likely to have the greatest impact on
improving equity will concern reforming the health financing system
(WHO 2010a).
While the financing of healthcare clearly influences its demand,
access and utilization are also influenced by a diverse range of other
factors operating on the patient’s side (i.e. demand-side). Social
stratifications and inequalities (e.g. socio-economic status, gender,
ethnicity, race, caste) and their intersections with each other (e.g.
African-American men in the United States, scheduled-caste women
in India) are additional influences which might shape men’s and
women’s access to household and societal resources and their per-
ceptions and experiences of the cultural acceptability of services
(Larson et al. 2016a,b). There is a substantial body of literature
across a range of different contextual settings indicating that men
and women are different in the ways they perceive and experience
illness, and ultimately seek care for a range of curative and promo-
tive health services (Gao and Yao 2006; Batnitzky 2008; Braitstein
et al. 2008; Mwachofi 2009; Ringheim 2011). There is less litera-
ture, however, exploring the gendered effects of different financing
mechanisms, and how these affect healthcare access and utilization
(Ravindran and de Pinho 2005; Sen and Govender 2015).
The purpose of this paper is to highlight the gaps in the health sys-
tems literature in relation to health financing and gender, and to ex-
plore which financing reforms are likely to be the most effective at
accelerating progress toward UHC while at the same time addressing
gender inequities (Research in Gender and Ethics 2015). While evidence
is drawn from the overall literature, we utilize a case study of India in
order to showcase a country where health-financing reforms are having
an impact on gender inequities. The paper concludes by calling for
greater collaboration between gender and health financing experts.
Methods
This paper draws on the expertise of the authors and on a rapid re-
view of the health literature (grey and peer-reviewed articles).
Although there are bodies of work on related topics in the economics
and wider development literature, our interest was to capture the ex-
tent to which health practitioners had researched and reflected on this
topic, so our focus was on health literature. With respect to universal
health coverage, there were several primary documents and reports
(i.e. grey literature) that were drawn on. These included WHO reports
(i.e. 2010 report on universal coverage, the 2008 report on primary
health care) and technical reports (Carrin and James 2004). With re-
spect to gender and women, primary documents included reports by
the United Nations (United Nations 2009 2010). In addition, we
included reports and publications focusing on the gender implications
of health financing (Witter and Ensor 2012), health-financing reforms
Key Messages
•
Insufficient attention has been paid to the interaction of gender and health financing; we call for better collaboration to
fill this gap.
•
While Universal Health Coverage (UHC) emphasizes equity, some groups have higher health needs and lower financing
capabilities than others; this implies the need for progressive universalism, which puts the needs of vulnerable groups
like women and children first.
•
Broad recommendations from our review include public financing of health care services with resources mobilized from
progressive taxation of income and wealth; firm action by governments to regulate the private health sector, especially
in the area of price controls; attention to coverage of different groups of women when implementing health financing re-
forms; and social protection schemes that go beyond women from households below the poverty line and with pack-
ages covering more than maternal health.
•
The underlying political and social determinants that undermine access for vulnerable and marginalized groups (e.g.
poor indigenous women, adolescents) must also be tackled to achieve the broader equity and effectiveness goals of
UHC.

 (WHO 2010 b) and universal coverage (Witter and Ensor 2012; Sen
and Govender 2015) that were relevant to this paper. The reference
lists of these documents were also reviewed and relevant articles iden-
tified for inclusion in this paper.
For published articles, both empirical and review, searches were
conducted on PubMED and Google Scholar as well as specific jour-
nals focusing on gender and sexual and reproductive health (e.g.
Reproductive Health Matters) and health policy (e.g. Health Policy
and Planning, WHO Bulletin). The following key words were used
for searches: ‘universal health coverage’, ‘universal coverage’,
‘health care financing’, ‘health financing reforms’, ‘insurance’, ‘com-
munity-based insurance’, ‘demand-side financing’, ‘gender’, ‘wom-
en’, ‘maternal health’, ‘sexual and reproductive health’, ‘access’,
‘equity’, ‘equality’ and ‘efficiency’. The search limits included all art-
icles published since 2000 in English.
The India case study was based on published articles and reports
about health financing in India since 2000 available from the same data-
bases and journals, and key Indian sources publishing policy related art-
icles (e.g. Economic and Political Weekly). The key words for the search
included, in addition to those already mentioned, names of specific health
financing schemes (e.g. Rashtriya Swasthya Bhima Yojana (RSBY)).
Results
In its seminal World Health Report (WHO 2010a), WHO looks at
three main functions of a health financing system: how revenues for
health services are collected, how they are pooled to spread financial
risks and what purchasing mechanisms are used to pay for health
services. This article looks at these functions in turn to assess the ex-
tent of research into gender equity considerations in each area. The
findings are presented below, grouping the first two functions (rev-
enue collection and pooling) which are heavily interrelated.
Overview of evidence on gendered effects of
revenue collection and pooling for health care
This section explores the evidence on gendered effects of the health
financing functions identified by WHO as revenue collection and
pooling and how these affect healthcare access and utilization.
One can classify the main health-financing mechanisms into two
broad groups—those that are private and voluntary in nature and
those that are public and compulsory (WHO 2010a). With the first
group, individuals and households have a large degree of choice as
to whether and how much they choose to contribute towards the
health financing system. The main mechanisms here include direct
patient fees, voluntary private insurance schemes, voluntary health
savings accounts and personal philanthropic aid.
In the latter group, there is a tendency for the state to compel peo-
ple to make contributions and specify how much they pay, with the
rich often having to contribute more than the poor. The main mech-
anisms here include financing from general taxation, compulsory so-
cial health insurance, mandatory health savings accounts and
overseas development assistance. These groupings of financing mech-
anisms have different capacities to pool resources and in particular
perform very differently against an equity measure of being able to fa-
cilitate cross-subsidies to poor and vulnerable groups in society.
Private, voluntary mechanisms
User fees
User fees are out-of-pocket (OOP) payments which users pay for ser-
vices at the point of use. OOP payments have been described by
WHO (2008, p24) as ‘. . .the most inequitable method for financing
healthcare services’. There are clear gender implications related to
user fees, which have been shown to affect men and women differ-
ently. In many contexts, across both high- and low-income coun-
tries, for example, gender biases operating at the societal and
household level often mean that women have less voice in the con-
trol and distribution of how household resources are shared among
household members (United Nations 2009). In such contexts, user
fees limit women’s access to health care due to their lack of control
over financial resources, the implications of which are expanded as
a result of their greater reproductive healthcare needs (WHO 2010
b). According to WHO (2010a, p. 23), for example, [w]omen incur
more out-of-pocket payments than men. . .paying for delivery care
and other reproductive health services places a higher financial bur-
den on women. . .[and] out-of-pocket expenditure may prevent more
women than men from utilizing essential services.
Additionally, gender intersects with other social stratifications
(e.g. socio-economic status, race, ethnicity, caste, age), further chal-
lenging access to and utilization of care (Ravindran 2012). Studies
in Africa and Asia, for example, indicate that user fees severely con-
strain access to healthcare for the most vulnerable (such as elderly
men and women, widows and women who are heads of their house-
holds) (Balagopal 2009; Onah and Govender 2014). In contexts
where women and their families are required to pay for reproductive
health services, delivery and obstetric care has been found to be un-
affordable, even catastrophic (Parkhurst et al. 2005; Honda et al.
2011). A study covering Mombasa in Kenya and Mysore in India
(2012–13) confirms the highly regressive nature of spending on sex-
ual and reproductive health services. The poorest households spent
2 times as much and 10 times as much as the least poor in India and
Kenya, respectively (Haghparast-Bidgoli et al. 2015).
When user fees have either been completely abolished or
removed for selected services, utilization and access have improved,
and in some instances key health indicators have improved. For ex-
ample, significant improvements were recorded in utilization of ma-
ternity services and maternal mortality rates declined when user fees
were removed for pregnant women in Ghana (Donnelly 2015).
The removal of user fees on its own, however, does not inevit-
ably lead to improvements in healthcare access, and quality of care
issues often persist (Schneider and Gilson 1999; Parkhurst et al.
2005; De Allegri et al. 2011). In South Africa, free maternal health
care and the introduction of the Termination of Pregnancy bill
within the public sector were important policies for improving
healthcare access and improving maternal health, however, accept-
ability and quality of care remained a challenge (Schneider and
Gilson 1999). A recent four-country study of obstetric fee exemp-
tion policies found that there are high risks of favouring better off
households unless exemption policies are accompanied by concerted
efforts to address other barriers, such as physical and cultural and
those related to perceptions of quality of care. It also emphasized
the need to address underlying systemic weaknesses, including in
stewardship, and to embed exemption policies in an overall national
plan to achieve UHC (Witter et al. 2016).
Private and voluntary health insurance
Evidence from both high- (e.g. USA) and middle-income countries
(e.g. South Africa) with significant private health insurance coverage
indicates that private health insurance is inequitable by excluding
the unemployed and socio-economically disadvantaged (Govender
et al. 2014). A study of privately insured households in South Africa
found that almost half of privately insured households were partially

 insured,1 and ‘on average, more household heads in partially insured
households were female, unmarried, with primary school education
or no education, Black and unemployed’ (Govender et al. 2014). In
the Indian context, ‘household members within male-headed house-
holds were twice as likely to be insured as those in female-headed
households,’ with implications for healthcare access. Voluntary,
community-based health insurance schemes which intend to meet
the gap in insurance coverage in the informal sector through low
premia, targeting women, the poor and rural populations, have also
been unable to provide coverage for those ‘without access to cash–
including the elderly and women from non-poor households’
(Ravindran 2012).
The need for explicit legislative measures to prevent gender
rating in private health insurance is brought home by the experience
of the USA. Gender rating is the practice of charging different rates
for identical health services on the basis of gender. There is little
known about how widespread gender rating is in LMICs. Before the
Affordable Care Act was implemented in the USA, gender rating in
individual plans caused women to pay an estimated US$1 bil-
lion more annually than men. Further, only 12% of individual plans
included maternity benefits, and many preventive sexual and repro-
ductive health services were not covered. The Affordable Care Act
implemented since 2014 has made gender-rating illegal and also
included a range of sexual and reproductive health services including
contraception, screening and counselling for domestic and interper-
sonal violence, mammograms and colonoscopy. These benefits are
now under threat from plans to reform Obamacare.
Compulsory public mechanisms
Countries such as Thailand (Tangcharoensathien et al. 2014) and
Mexico (Ib�
a~
nez and Garita 2015) have made rapid progress towards
universal coverage through a combination of social health insur-
ance, which covers those who are formally employed and salaried,
and tax revenue, which covers the financial contributions of those
who are economically vulnerable (i.e. poor, children, elderly, infor-
mal sector). The evidence from both these countries indicates that
universal coverage has been effective in reducing financial costs of
health care for the economically vulnerable; however, important
challenges persist in both these contexts, particularly in relation to
sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services.
In Mexico, inadequate resourcing of SRH services (i.e. distribu-
tion of services and health personnel including midwives), alongside
‘inequalities affecting women’s access to health services, especially
those that are based on income, age, ethnic origin and geographical
residence’ (Ib�
a~
nez and Garita 2015, 244), have contributed to unsat-
isfactory progress in reducing maternal mortality and adolescent
pregnancy rates. In comparison, Thailand’s maternal health picture
is considerably better since explicit attention and effort was made in
including ‘almost all relevant SRH services envisioned in the
Programme of Action (POA) of the International Conference on
Population and Development (ICPD), including treatment of re-
productive
tract
cancers
in
the
UHC
benefit
package’
(Tangcharoensathien et al. 2014, p. 246). Despite this progress, ado-
lescent pregnancy rates have increased, access to safe abortions re-
mains a challenge, and gender-based violence continues to be a
major societal and public health challenge. Key messages emerging
from both of these countries are that progress towards UHC in
terms of developing effective financing mechanisms needs to be
accompanied by (1) attention to services which predominately affect
women, such as SRH, and (2) efforts to tackle the underlying polit-
ical and social determinants that undermine access for vulnerable
and marginalized groups (such as poor indigenous women and
adolescents).
In many countries, health insurance is mandatory in theory but
remains voluntary in practice for the informal sector. In these coun-
tries, many of the problems of voluntary financing schemes recur.
Dixon (2014), for example, illustrates the intensely gendered nature
of health insurance enrolment through her study of the National
Health Insurance Scheme in Ghana. Major factors determining en-
rolment and dropping out were wealth, education and desire for
health insurance. However, while only the poorest men were more
likely to never enrol, wealth was a determinant of enrolment for
women across the wealth spectrum, with the poorest women >6
times less likely to enrol as the wealthiest and even women from the
middle wealth group almost 2.5 times less likely to enrol. Women
with children under five and living in non-nuclear households were
more likely to drop-out, and the three-month block-out time before
reactivating coverage for premium defaulters was likely to penalize
women for their mothering and family-related responsibilities
(Dixon 2014).
Development assistance
Development assistance accounts for an average of 25% of overall
financing for health care in low-income countries (WHO 2015a). In
the health sector, the OECD estimates that 51% of total bilateral
aid to health focuses on gender equity, largely through investments
in basic health care, such as primary health care programmes and
health education. Support for family planning and reproductive
health care made up a very small share of total gender equity
focussed aid in the health sector OECD 2013 despite its potential
contribution to MDG 5, focused on reducing maternal deaths,
which was one of the least performing MDG goals (WHO 2015a).
Aid effectiveness studies have found a link between overall vol-
umes of aid and improved outcomes, including reduced maternal
mortality; however, improved outcomes are strongly affected by do-
mestic conditions, including increases in the volume of domestic
financing allocated for health and education (RECOM 2016).
Overview of evidence on gendered effects of
health purchasing
Resource allocation
There have been some attempts to track allocation of resources to
RMNCH through sub-accounts within national health accounts, as
a part of the tracking of international commitments made to women
and children’s health (WHO 2012). However, wider gendered ana-
lyses of health financing resource allocation are limited.
Purchasing and benefits packages
In recent years, there have been a number of initiatives to channel
publicly sourced financing resources (usually from taxation and aid
financing) to target populations (e.g. low socio-economic, pregnant
women and children) to increase their capacity to purchase
RMNCH health services. This demand-side financing, as opposed to
supply-side financing of services, has often used mechanisms such as
vouchers or conditional cash transfers (Handa and Davis 2006; Lim
et al. 2010; Ahmed and Khan 2011).
The overall experience from both South America and Asia has
been that demand-side financing, which has primarily focused on
maternal and child health, can be effective in reducing the financial
barriers to access, increasing utilization of prioritized health services
(Witter and Somanathan 2012). However, there have been concerns
Health Policy and Planning, 2017, Vol. 32, Suppl. 5
v7
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article-abstract/32/suppl_5/v4/4036321 by guest on 03 June 2019
 from a range of settings about the need for adopting supply-side
interventions to improve the performance of demand-side interven-
tions. For example, a demand-side strategy may not be very effective
without significant expansion of the service delivery capacity of
health facilities at the sub-district level (Handa & Davis 2006;
Barber 2010; Ahmed and Khan 2011). Moreover, work in Uganda
has shown that while demand-side financing, such as vouchers, has
improved access to maternal health services, it does not address the
underlying causes (such as negative gender power relations) affect-
ing women’s ability to pay for and access services (Morgan et al.
paper in this supplement).
In addition, there is growing evidence from community groups
working on the ground in a number of countries that weaknesses in
the availability of beds and personnel, combined with insufficient
training in the face of growing demand, leads to a number of ques-
tionable practices: women are discharged from the labour wards too
soon after delivery; practices during delivery include routine episiot-
omies, application of excessive fundal pressure, unnecessary oxyto-
cin injections and other practices meant to speed up the delivery;
unnecessary caesarean sections become the norm; and poorly trained
personnel are unable to recognize or manage obstetric emergencies
before it becomes too late to save the life of the woman (Sen and
Govender 2015). This implies that policies established to improve
women’s access to quality care may in some cases increase harms ra-
ther than benefits for poor women in particular (who are typically
the target of these demand-side finance programmes). The evidence
of disrespect and abuse during childbirth, often linked to power rela-
tionships, creates another barrier and risk for women (Department
of Reproductive Health and Research, World Health Organization
2015a,b). The focus within the literature on benefits packages and
gender has been on reproductive health and safe motherhood, which
while important by no means does justice to the wide range of gen-
dered needs for health services. For example, mental health needs
are known to be varied across men and women, as are risks related
to air pollution and suicide, to name just a few examples (WHO
2009). These are, however, rarely discussed in relation to purchasing
strategies in low and middle-income countries. Equity is predomin-
antly conceptualized in relation to income and geography.
Governance of health financing
A recent WHO guide to conducting country-level health-financing
diagnoses mentions the importance of good governance, account-
ability and transparency in health financing arrangements (McIntyre
and Kutzin 2016). Structuring the governance of health financing in-
stitutions to ensure the engagement and perspectives of all segments
of society, including different genders, is another area in which lit-
erature is lacking.
Case study: India
Although gender analysis of health financing mechanisms and re-
forms is limited, it is instructive to dig more deeply into the case
study of India, which has the largest population of poor women in
the world (World Bank 2014a–c; Office Registrar General of India
2011). The country has high levels of gender-based inequality with a
Gender Development Index of 0.795 in 2014, which places it among
countries with the lowest equality in Human Development Index
achievements between women and men (UNDP 2015). While India
has initiated a number of health financing initiatives with the aim of
increasing coverage of healthcare services to low-income groups, es-
pecially for maternal health care of women from poor households
and less economically developed states of India, the gendered impact
of the health financing schemes has yet to be studied in detail. The
following case study draws on available evidence to make a prelim-
inary assessment.
Very low-public investment in health, which stood at 1.05% of
the GDP in 2015 (Singh and Mehta 2016), has been a feature of
health care financing in India for many decades. Health care in India
has been predominantly financed by household out-of-pocket ex-
penditure for several decades, ranging from 67% in 2000 to 61% of
total health expenditure in 2012 (WHO 2015b). India’s government
funding for health is through taxes, and the government is also a
health service provider with a network of health facilities at the pri-
mary-, secondary- and tertiary-care levels. India has a low-income
and wealth tax-base and the health sector has to compete with other
sectors for allocation of resources (Gudwani et al. 2012). Cuts to
health (and other social sector) budgets are a common means of con-
taining fiscal deficits.
Chronic funding shortfalls have resulted in a public sector char-
acterized by shortages in service delivery points, especially in poorer
states and districts; inadequate staffing; shortage of drugs; non-
availability of diagnostic services; and limited range of services at
the primary and secondary care levels. For example, in 2011, India
had a hospital bed to population ratio of 0.7 per 1000 (World Bank
2015a), a physician to population ratio of 0.7 per 1000 (World
Bank 2015b) and a nurse/midwife to population ratio of 1.7 per
1000 (World Bank 2015c), all figures well below benchmarks set by
the World Health Organization.
The poor state of public sector health facilities affects women
disproportionately. When services for essential health needs are not
available in the subsidised government facilities, a large proportion
of women are compelled to forego health care because they cannot
afford to use private health care, which involves out-of-pocket
expenditure.
According to India’s National Sample Survey (2004), untreated
morbidity was higher among women as compared with men, espe-
cially among those in the 15–45 age group (Mukherjee and
Karmakar 2008). However, the most recent round of the same sur-
vey (2014) does not indicate a gender gap (National Sample Survey
Organization 2015). Smaller scale studies from the previous decade
have shown steeper differences: in low-income settlements in
Mumbai, untreated episodes of illness among men was 18%, and
among women it was 20% without probing and 45% when they
were probed (Nandraj et al. 2001). Among urban slum dwellers in
Delhi and Chennai, 27.5% and 9% respectively of men stated finan-
cial constraints as the main reason for not seeking treatment in a
2002 study; the figures were 46% and 25% for women from the
same communities (Sundar and Sharma 2002).
It is not only women from low-income households and those not
engaged in paid employment who may be unable to seek health
care
because
of
financial
constraints.
The
National
Family
Health Survey-3, 2005–06, reported that 40–50% of women with
>12 years of education, employed for cash, and belonging to the
highest wealth quintiles did not have the autonomy to decide how to
spend money (IIPS, Macro International 2007).
Since the early 1990s, India has witnessed a number of policy
measures that aim to create a ‘positive economic climate’ for the
growth of the private health care sector. The new Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) government that took office in 2014 has continued with
the previous government’s support for the private sector in health
and has introduced a few major reforms to further strengthen it
(Government of India 2015). Increasing the role of the private for-
private health sector has meant increasing average out-of-pocket

 expenditure for each health care seeking episode. Expenditure on
medicines are estimated to constitute about 50–80% of treatment
costs (Srinivasan 2011), and a series of changes introduced since
2010 in drug price control policies have contributed to escalating
costs of essential medicines (Srinivasan et al. 2014).
Increasing privatization of health service provision affects
women from across the socio-economic spectrum. Low-income
women have to pay for all SRH services other than delivery care,
while women who use private sector facilities for delivery care often
incur very high out-of-pocket expenditure. A study using national
survey data for 2007–08 reported the mean expenditure incurred for
a normal delivery in a private health facility to be 84 USD, and for a
caesarean delivery as high as 256 USD (Mohanty and Srivastava
2013).
The federal government also finances a nation-wide Social
Protection Mechanism for households living ‘below the poverty
line’. This is the RSBY, which is tax-funded and purchases health
care from public as well as ‘empanelled’ private health care facilities.
In addition, there are a number of state-government sponsored
schemes in Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala
and Tamil Nadu, which cover secondary or tertiary health care with
varying extents of financial coverage (Selvaraj and Karan 2012).
India’s main social protection scheme—RSBY—covers only house-
holds living below the poverty line for a selected range of inpatient
services. However, as seen from NFHS-3 data, it is not only women
from poor households but also educated and employed women from
middle- and upper-income households who encounter financial bar-
riers. Failure to take this fact into account results in the deprivation
of much-needed coverage of inpatient services for a section of
women and men.
Studies indicate that the RSBY has increased access to care for
low-income women (Cerceau 2012). However, a more gender-
aware design could have removed some major barriers. For ex-
ample, Rs.30 000 per annum is available for covering hospitaliza-
tion for the ‘household’; however, only five members may be
enrolled per household. Thus, the RSBY leaves the choice of who is
to be covered to household dynamics. It has been found that girls
and elderly women are more likely to be excluded when there are
more than five members in a household, and overall enrolment of
women is lower than that of men (Cerceau 2012). There are also
non-financial barriers to utilizing the RSBY even among women
who are enrolled, arising from gendered inequities. These include in-
adequate information on which health facilities are empanelled and
what services are covered and lack of confidence to negotiate with
health care providers about their entitlements under the RSBY
(Cerceau 2012).
In addition, in India, there is a tax-funded Conditional Cash
Transfer Scheme (CCT)—the Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY)—which
offers a cash incentive to women who deliver in a health facility.
The eligibility criteria for receiving the cash incentive vary across
states. States with a low proportion of institutional deliveries offer it
to all women, while other states offer it only to women from house-
holds ‘below the poverty line’ (National Health Mission 2013).
While the JSY has increased the proportion of women delivering in
institutions significantly, gender-based vulnerabilities were not fac-
tored into the design of the scheme. Across all states, the scheme ex-
cludes women who already have two live births. As fertility levels
are considerably higher among women from the two lowest wealth
quintiles and among women with lower educational levels (IIPS and
Macro International 2007), the exclusion of women with more than
two live births from the JSY scheme disproportionately affects
marginalized groups of women.
In states of India with a high proportion of institutional deliv-
eries, only women from households below the poverty line, and
those above 18 years of age, are eligible for the JSY. Even among
those satisfying all eligibility criteria, women from the most margi-
nalized groups tend to be excluded. For example in a Tamil Nadu
study, only 25% of women who satisfied the eligibility criteria bene-
fitted from the conditional cash transfer scheme of the state govern-
ment, as caste and landowning status were significantly associated
with receiving benefits. The main reasons for exclusion were diffi-
culties encountered in producing the necessary papers to prove eli-
gibility
because
of
lack
of
information,
time
and
contacts
(Balasubramanian and Ravindran 2012).
There have also been some unexpected perverse effects from the
conditional cash transfer schemes for promoting institutional deliv-
eries. The dramatic increase in institutional deliveries in public sec-
tor health facilities has resulted in the neglect of almost all other
essential SRH care, especially at primary- and secondary-care levels.
Women have to seek all other SRH services from the private health
sector, incurring high levels of out-of-pocket expenditure. A study of
49 women from low-income households who were hospitalized for
hysterectomy in rural Tamil Nadu, for example, found that costs
incurred for the surgery in private hospitals was Rs. 25 000 in a pri-
vate hospital, an amount equivalent to 30 times monthly per capita
expenditure
in
rural
Tamil
Nadu
(approximately
Rs.
850)
(Balasubramanian 2011).
Discussion
This article was based on a rapid review to examine the extent of and
focal areas within the literature on health financing and gender. It is,
therefore, not comprehensive but does bring out some overall findings
and highlights key gaps in the health literature. Our rapid review of
the literature reveals that there has been relatively little gendered ana-
lysis of health financing arrangements and, where analysis has been
conducted, the focus has been on a few areas. In order to help fill this
gap, Table 1 gives examples of the kinds of questions which could be
approached from a gender angle within each health financing func-
tion, and a summary of the volume of work which has done in rela-
tion to these questions. Most work appears to have focused on the
gender implications of user fees, and to a lesser extent on resource al-
location to specific service package areas, such as mother and child
health. However, other areas of potential significance, such as analysis
of the gender implications of different service packages or of different
provider payment mechanisms, are neglected.
It indicates the need for more collaboration across professional
‘silos’—not only health financing people giving more attention to
gendered differences but also gender experts taking an interest in
health financing arrangements and how they can help or hinder pro-
gress towards universal health coverage. Gender analysis frame-
works (Morgan et al. 2016) could help to highlight important
underlying patterns relating to access to resources, division of la-
bour, social norms and roles, which affect health financing processes
and outcomes and reproduce gender inequities at household, meso
and macro levels. For example, targeted financing mechanisms re-
inforce women’s roles as vectors for child health rather than as
rights-bearing citizens with comprehensive needs. This can link to
other bodies of gender analysis on health systems—for example, the
small but growing literature on the gendered health workforce,
which puts women into lowly paid caring roles as an extension of
the household division of labour (George 2008; Witter et al.). There
is also a need to better understand specific contexts. Fragile and

 post-conflict states, for example, face-specific challenges, and while
work is starting to emerge on how to develop more gender-sensitive
health financing policies (Ssali et al. 2016), more work is needed.
Given the political nature of UHC decisions, the political economy
as well as technical research should be prioritized. The effects and
interactions of technical interventions in complex systems are inher-
ently unpredictable, but clear policy goals and an openness to moni-
tor and respond to unintended consequences are important starting
points.
In reviewing the performance of different health fund-raising
and pooling mechanisms, it is evident that some are much better
than others both in terms of improving efficiency and also in meet-
ing the equity requirements, including reducing gender inequalities,
implicit in the UHC definition. Specifically it is evident that compul-
sory public financing mechanisms (in countries such as Thailand,
Brazil or Sri Lanka) outperform private voluntary mechanisms be-
cause only the former can facilitate the cross-subsidies necessary to
cover the poor and vulnerable (Kutzin 2012; Rottingen et al 2014).
However, one should not assume that building a health financing
system based on compulsory public financing mechanisms will be
sufficient to reduce gender inequities. This is because health-financ-
ing reforms are inherently political processes and there will always
be a tendency for powerful groups to capture a disproportionate
proportion of benefits and minimize costs for themselves. This can
be seen in the tendency for governments to establish health insur-
ance schemes that cover people working in the formal sector—which
disproportionately benefits civil servants and men. Linking health
coverage to employment status originated in Europe in the 19th and
early 20th centuries when health benefits were prioritized for men be-
cause states wanted a healthy male workforce to fight wars and work
Table 1. Gendered questions on health financing and summary of current literature
Health financing function
Examples of gendered questions
Summary of state of evidence
Revenue raising
1.
Fairness of financial contributions: who is paying for health
care? How is that changing over time
2.
How far does the burden fall disproportionately on one
sex?
3.
What is the gender implication of changing revenue sources
(e.g. out of pocket likely to fall heavily on women; prepaid
mechanisms may be more protective)?
4.
How do different payment systems affect men and wom-
en’s access to health care?
5.
How are they affected by household arrangements (liveli-
hoods, access to cash, decision-making power etc.) and
how do they affect these in turn?
6.
What is the pattern of private and public funding and what
does that mean for meeting the needs of different popula-
tion groups?
This has received most attention but focussed on ques-
tions 4 and 5, especially in relation to user fees.
Other areas need more probing
Risk pooling
1.
Who is protected under different risk pooling systems (tax-
based, insurance, prepaid mechanisms etc.)?
2.
How effective are the risks pools in protecting men and
women against health shocks (ensuring access and also fi-
nancial protection)?
This question is usually examined in relation to quin-
tiles, but not gender
Resource allocation
1.
How do patterns of resource allocation at different levels
(national, regional, district) and within different systems
and schemes affect equity of access and use for both gen-
ders, as well as quality of care? (Not just allocation of fund-
ing, but also infrastructure, human resources, etc.)
This is an important but neglected area
Purchasing
1.
Which programmes are being prioritized for funding and
how do these reflect different gender needs?
2.
Does the public/private mix serve the interests of both men
and women effectively?
3.
Are gender-sensitive services being purchased (e.g. facilities
which provide confidentiality, sensitivity, right staffing
mix, at appropriate opening times, etc.)?
4.
Are provider payment mechanisms incentivising appropri-
ate and high quality services for both genders?
Work has been done on resource allocation to mother
and child health and sexual and reproductive health
programmes but limited wider analysis (including of
gender implications of different public private
partnerships)
Benefits package
1.
Is there a clear and fair entitlement to services?
2.
Are different genders equally aware of them and able to ac-
cess without stigma?
3.
Do utilization patterns suggest that needs are being fairly
met across the genders, or are there remaining financial and
social barriers?
Not usually approached from a gender angle, but bene-
fits packages do have gendered implications (e.g. may
neglect some common male conditions, or important
elements for women, such as family planning, safe
abortion, infertility treatment and treatment for vic-
tims of sexual violence)
Health financing governance 1.
Is there adequate and fair representation of different gen-
ders in health financing governance structures? Who is rep-
resented in health facility management committees, for
example? Who decides on resource allocations?, etc.
2.
Does the regulatory system ensure fairness and quality of
care for both genders?
This is an important but neglected area

 in rapidly industrializing economies. This is incompatible with the
more modern approaches which emphasize women’s contribution to
the workforce, as well as a universal right to health, as illustrated by
the UN Declaration on Human Rights, which recognizes the wider so-
cial and economic benefits of women’s health (Langer et al. 2015).
Due to large political pressure from civil society organizations and
excluded populations, many countries have moved away from this se-
lective approach, to establish coverage systems built on a universal en-
titlement to services and financial protection (Evans et al. 2012;
Rannan-Eliya and Sikurajapathy 2009). As countries move towards
UHC they should ensure that everybody is covered in an equitable
manner and that vulnerable groups, notably women, are prioritized
from the outset. This preferred route to UHC has been called ‘progres-
sive universalism’ by the Lancet Commission on Investing in Health,
which called for a grand convergence of health indicators (and there-
fore an elimination of inequalities) by 2035 (Jamison et al. 2013).
Conclusion
Our review has drawn attention to two main gaps: research gaps (areas
where collaboration across disciplines could yield more gender-
responsive analysis) but also the more substantive gaps in health cover-
age, and the contribution which health financing can make to closing
them. The pattern of health financing in countries like India has clear
gendered implications, with women at a relative disadvantage. A more
gender-equitable approach to health financing would include, for ex-
ample: tax-based public financing of health care services with resources
mobilized from progressive taxation of income and wealth; firm action
by governments to regulate the private sector in health, especially in
the area of price controls; attention to coverage of all sections of
women when implementing health financing reforms (e.g. social insur-
ance, micro-insurance); and social protection schemes that go beyond
women from households below the poverty line and with packages
covering services across the life-cycle (not just reproductive health).
Unless explicit attention is paid to gender and its intersectionality
with other social stratifiers, through explicit protection and careful
linking of benefits to needs of target populations (e.g. poor women,
unemployed men, female-headed households), movement towards
UHC can fail to achieve gender balance or improve equity, and may
even exacerbate gender inequity. Political trade-offs are made on the
road to UHC and the experiences and interests of less powerful
groups, which can include women and children, are not necessarily
given priority. Countries should adopt an equitable approach to-
wards achieving UHC and through progressive universalism priori-
tize high need groups and those requiring additional financial
protection, in particular women and children.
