Title: The difficulties experienced by nurses and healthcare staff involved in the process of 
breaking bad news 
Authors: Clare Warnock, Jean Buchanan, Angela Tod 
 
Abstract 
Aims 
To explore the difficulties experienced by nurses and healthcare professionals when 
engaging in the process of breaking bad news   
Background 
The challenges faced by staff when breaking bad news have previously been researched in 
relation to particular settings or subjects. This study involved staff from diverse settings and 
roles to develop broader insights into the range of difficulties experienced in clinical 
practice.     
Design 
The study utilised a descriptive survey design involving self-reported written accounts and 
framework analysis. 
Methods 
Data was collected using a structured questionnaire containing a free text section that asked 
participants to describe a difficult experience they had encountered when involved in the 
process of breaking bad news. Data was collected from healthcare staff from hospital, 
community, hospice and care home settings attending training days on breaking bad news 
between April 2011 and April 2014.  
Findings 
Multiple inter-related factors presented challenges to staff engaging in activities associated 
with breaking bad news. Traditional subjects such as diagnostic and treatment information 
were described but additional topics were identified such as the impact of illness and care at 
the end of life.  A descriptive framework was developed that summarises the factors that 
contribute to creating difficult experiences for staff when breaking bad news. 
Conclusion 
The framework provides insights into the scope of the challenges faced by staff when they 
engage in the process of breaking bad news. This provides the foundation for developing 
interventions to support staff that more closely matches their experiences in clinical 
practice.

Title: The difficulties experienced by nurses and healthcare staff involved in the process of 
breaking bad news 
 
INTRODUCTION 
This paper presents the findings of a study that explored the difficulties encountered by 
nurses and healthcare professionals during the process of breaking bad news. Bad news in 
healthcare settings has been described as any bad, sad or significant information that has a 
�������� ������ �� � �������� ����� �� ������������ �� ����� ������� �� ������ �F���������� � 
Jenkins 2004).  A diverse range of subjects can be perceived as bad news by patients and 
relatives and many healthcare workers play a role in providing this information (Eggly et al 
2006, Rassin et al 2013). The potential challenges associated with breaking bad news have 
tended to be explored in relation to pre-planned consultations when information about 
prognosis or diagnosis is given by medical staff.   
 
Background 
The majority of patients want to be given reliable and accurate information about their 
diagnosis, treatment options and potential outcomes (Clayton et al 2007). Patients who 
understand their situation are better equipped to make informed decisions, have a greater 
sense of control and are less likely to pursue inappropriate or ineffective treatments 
(Campbell et al 2010, Hancock et al 2007). Information plays a role in coping; without 
adequate knowledge patients may experience uncertainty about their present and future, 
and be unable to marry what is happening to them with the information they have received 
(Innes & Payne 2009, Hancock et al 2007).   
 
How bad news is given influences satisfaction with care and the way in which patients 
subsequently cope with their situation (Randall & Wearn 2005). A number of guidelines 
have been developed to support healthcare staff when breaking bad news, but these are 
often focused on the events that take place in pre-planned consultations when medical 
information about diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and death is given to patents and 
relatives (Baile et al 2000, Campbell et al 2010).  This perspective captures significant 
healthcare moments that require careful management to ensure distressing information is 
given well (Rassin et al 2006). However, there is increasing recognition that this focus may 
 4 
 
be too narrow in terms of the information which is classified as bad news, the emphasis on a 
single interaction and the contexts in which patients receive and healthcare staff provide 
this information (Eggly et al 006, Griffiths et al 2015).  
 
Patients have described the moment of receiving significant information as part of a process 
or journey rather than an isolated event (Tobin & Begley 2008). In supporting patients 
through this process healthcare staff engage in a range of activities such as preparing 
patients for receiving bad news, clarifying the information received, supporting decision 
making and helping patients and relatives adapt as the implications of the news become 
apparent (Gauthier 2008, Warnock et al 2010). This process can be ongoing and involve 
multiple interactions when healthcare staff find themselves engaging in the process of 
breaking bad news (Dewar 2000, Warnock et al 2010).        
 
While there are considerable benefits to patients being knowledgeable about their 
situation, there are challenges for healthcare staff involved in providing this information 
(Fallowfield & Jenkins 2004). These challenges can arise from a diverse range of intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors. Problems can arise when the context is complex, where there is 
uncertainty about outcomes (Pavlish et al ����� �� ��� �� ��������� ����������� ��� ��� 
reactions to, the information being given (Prouty et al 2014, Eggly et al 2006). Other 
challenges include the effectiveness of communication between the healthcare team 
(Wittenburg-Lyes et al 2013), the need to tailor information to meet individual needs (Innes 
and Payne 2009) and addressing differences in opinion between patients, relatives and care 
providers on the content and timing of information and who it should be disclosed to 
(Prouty et al 2014, Erichsen et al 2010).  
 
Difficulties experienced by healthcare staff involved in providing bad, sad or significant 
information have previously been explored by focusing on a particular type of information, 
patient group, healthcare provider or care setting. Examples include providing cancer 
patients with prognostic information (Helft et al 2011), transitions from curative to palliative 
and end of life care (Shannon et al 2011) and the demands associated with specific care 
settings such as intensive care (Stayt 2006), inpatient wards (Warnock et al 2010) and 
community care (Griffiths et al 2014). While differences are revealed according to the 
 5 
 
research focus, shared themes and concerns can be identified. Examples include not having 
adequate time to anticipate or meet the emotional needs of patients and relatives (Pavlish 
et al 2014, Prouty et al 2013, Hancock et al 2007), lack of congruence within the healthcare 
team (Pavlish et al 2014, Wittenberg-Lyles et al 2013, Tobin 2012, Helft et al 2011, Erichsen 
et al 2010), knowing when to initiate difficult subjects (Griffiths et al 2015, Leung et al 2011) 
and dealing with emotional reactions (Campbell et al 2010, Gauthier 2008).        
 
Guidance currently exists to support those involved in breaking bad news but its narrow 
focus on planned consultations means there are limitations to its usefulness in the diverse 
contexts and situations when events may occur (Warnock et al 2010). Identifying the 
difficulties experienced by staff engaging in the process of breaking bad news is an 
important step in the development of interventions, education and guidance that more 
closely reflects the reality of clinical practice.  
 
In an earlier study the challenges faced by in-patient ward nurses when involved in the 
process of breaking bad news were explored by analysing written descriptions of difficult 
experiences provided by participants (Warnock et al 2010). Factors that contributed to the 
challenges faced were identified which provided insights into the hospital ward context. The 
study presented here builds on this work by exploring the experiences of nurses and other 
healthcare staff employed across a range of settings to develop a framework for describing 
shared concerns that reflects their experiences in clinical practice.   
 
THE STUDY 
Aim 
The aim of the study is to explore the difficulties experienced by nurses and healthcare 
professionals when involved in the process of breaking bad news in diverse contexts and 
clinical settings. 
 
Design 
A descriptive survey design was employed. A questionnaire generated qualitative data to 
identify the difficulties encountered when breaking bad news in clinical practice.  
 
 6 
 
Participants 
Participants were nurses and healthcare professionals attending an education day designed 
to support healthcare staff involved in the process of breaking bad news. The study day was 
run twice a year and was open to all healthcare staff who worked in a region in the North of 
England. There were a total of 145 participants in a two stage study. 
 
Stage 1. Initial analysis: Data was collected on seven separate study days. 158 staff attended 
in total and 138 returned questionnaires. 109 of these completed the part of the 
questionnaire relating to difficult experiences encountered when involved in the process of 
breaking bad news and were included in the initial analysis. The age ranged from 21 to 61, 
mean 40.7, the number of years of employment in healthcare ranged from 1 to 40 years, 
mean 13.3.  
 
Stage 2. Verification: Verification data was collected on a further two study days. 36 
participants returned questionnaires with the appropriate section completed. The age range 
for this group was 23 to 64, mean 36, the number of years in healthcare ranged from 1to 37, 
mean 13.5.  
 
All study days were predominantly attended by female healthcare staff and only four 
participants in total were male. Participants were from a wide range of professional 
backgrounds and settings including acute hospitals, hospices, nursing homes and 
community teams. Details of participants roles and areas of practice are in table one.  
 
Data collection 
Questionnaire 
Data was collected using a structured questionnaire that had been developed for a previous 
study which explored the experiences of nurses when breaking bad news in in-patient care 
settings (Warnock 2010). The original questionnaire was adapted for use on the study day 
by using terms applicable to all healthcare settings but was otherwise unchanged. 
Difficulties experienced when breaking bad news were explored in a free text question that 
was worded as follows: �Describe briefly one example of a difficult experience you have 
encountered when involved in the process of breaking bad news�.  
 7 
 
The questionnaire was completed at the start of the study day by attendees with the 
intention of providing them with an opportunity for quiet, structured reflection on their 
own experiences in relation to breaking bad news. At the end of the session attendees were 
invited to hand in the questionnaire if they wished to do so.  
 
Data for the initial analysis was collected over seven study days between April 2011 and 
March 2013. The framework verification analysis was carried out on questionnaires 
completed on two study days between November 2013 and April 2014. 
 
Ethical considerations 
The project was reviewed by the Trust clinical effectiveness department and identified as 
service evaluation. Full ethics committee approval was deemed not necessary and the 
T������ ����������� ��� ������� �������� �� ������� ���������� ���� followed (Mawson et al 
2007). Participants were informed verbally and in writing on the front of the questionnaire 
that the findings would be used for the development of future study days and would be 
written up in reports and publications. It was emphasised that participation was voluntary. 
No names or identifiers were on the questionnaires and participants were informed that 
confidentiality would be maintained and no content that could identify individuals would be 
used in written or published reports.   
 
Data analysis  
The free text descriptions were analysed using framework analysis (Ritchie et al 2014). The 
process of analysis involved a series of independent and collaborative phases by two 
investigators (CW and JB). Each stage of the analysis was carried out separately by the 
investigators and then agreed.  
 
The investigators read all of the descriptions to identify themes, which formed a preliminary 
�������� ������ T�� ������������� ������������ ���� ���� ������ �� ��� ����������� ����� 
under all themes where they were relevant; some were placed in two or more themes. Both 
investigators agreed the placement of the descriptions within the thematic index.  The 
investigators independently developed summaries of the characteristics and content of each 
of the themes within the index. The summaries were discussed until agreement was 
 8 
 
reached on the final description of each theme within the framework.  Descriptions of 
difficult experiences from the questionnaires of attendees on a further two study days were 
then reviewed against the framework to search for similarities and differences, identify 
additional characteristics and confirm the content of the initial analysis. 
 
Rigour  
Rigour was established using approaches appropriate to qualitative research (Ryan-Nichols 
& Will 2009, Guba & Lincoln 1985).  Measures which aimed to enhance the credibility of 
data analysis included the use of constant comparison analysis, which is inherent to 
framework analysis (Ritchie et al 2014). Participants descriptions were returned to 
frequently throughout analysis to ensure the findings were grounded in their accounts. In 
addition, two researchers carried out data analysis and interpretation independently and 
the findings were discussed, refined and agreed. Dependability was approached by both 
researchers maintaining a clear documented trail of the decision making processes through 
written records. Verification of the initial findings was strengthened by comparison with 
additional data.   
 
FINDINGS 
Activities carried out in relation to breaking bad news 
In total 145 accounts were provided describing difficulties experienced when breaking bad 
news. In 70 of these the participants described the role they had played. These roles were 
categorised into four subject areas as follows (details in figure one):  
 
 Diagnostic and treatment information, including test results: in some descriptions the 
role was to give this information, in others it was to provide support before, during or 
after the patient or relative received it.  
 The impact of illness: a range of roles were described by participants that helped 
patients manage the consequences of their situation such as loss of independence or 
reduced function. Roles included activities around decision-making, discharge planning 
and practical guidance on adaptation and self-care. Many of these descriptions involved 
patients or relatives who had found it difficult to accept or come to terms with the 
information they had been given.  
 9 
 
 Managing reactions: these roles included preparing patients for information before it 
was given, anticipating their reactions or needs for additional information and support 
and picking up the pieces when others had mishandled information giving.  
 Care at the end of life: many descriptions related to end of life care. Examples of the 
����� ������� ��� �� ������������ �������� ��������� ��������� �� � ��������� ������������� 
or death, supporting patients and families through the transition to end of life care and 
explaining the process of, and care around, dying. 
 
Additional activities were identified that that did not fit within these groups including failing 
a student nurse on placement and supporting patients through treatment procedures.      
 
Consequences of difficult breaking bad news events 
The potential consequences arising from the difficult events described were identified. For 
patients and relatives they included, not receiving the care the participant felt was 
needed/optimum, additional difficulties coping with information and events, increased 
and/or unnecessary distress and breakdown in the relationships between the patient/ 
family and healthcare team. Consequences for participants included increased demand on 
resources such as workload and time, breakdown in relationships within the multi-
disciplinary team and feeling unsupported or let down by colleagues or the organisation. 
Personal consequences were also described such as doubts about their own practice, feeling 
guilty or compromised and a sense of helplessness when unable to resolve the situation. 
 
Sources of difficulty 
Four main sources of difficulty were identified:  situation, organisation, patients and 
relatives, and individual. 
 
Situation 
This theme related to the circumstances surrounding the breaking bad news event and 
included difficult subjects, challenging situations and the practicalities surrounding 
communication such as location and method (for example over the phone). Illustrative 
extracts ���� ������������� ������������ are provided in figure two. Complex ethical or care 
events featured frequently as difficult subjects for breaking bad news. These included 
 10 
 
transitions in treatment pathways such as moving from curative to palliative treatment and 
emotive aspects of care such as explaining the process of dying or hydration at the end of 
life.  
 
News and events that were not expected created a difficult context for breaking bad news. 
Unexpected situations could arise from events that were not anticipated, such as a sudden 
death or not being pre-warned or adequately prepared that significant information was to 
be communicated. Early reassurance from healthcare staff that was not borne out by later 
developments contributed in some cases to events seeming unexpected from the 
perspective of the patient or relative. The difficulties associated with unplanned situations 
were compounded by practical factors that restricted how they were managed such as lack 
of privacy or having to give information over the phone.  
 
Tensions within the multi-professional team due to different perspectives or practices 
regarding information provision also featured in this theme.  Seeing information given badly 
�� ������ �� ������ �� ����� �� ��� ������� ���������� ��� � ������ �� ���������� ������� �� 
many descriptions. Examples of poor communication from others included an abrupt 
manner, not answering questions and use of jargon and euphemisms. Inadequate planning 
and preparation was a common factor in many descriptions and included medical staff 
giving bad news to patients without family members, or nurses, being present. 
Disagreement between the team regarding who should be given information also featured, 
for example, acting on relatives requests that the patient is not given diagnostic 
information.  
 
Organisation 
This theme encompassed work related factors such as time, staffing, relationships between 
departments and the services available to support information provision. Illustrative 
�������� ���� ������������� �������� ��������� �������������� are contained in figure three. 
Not having enough time to manage events or support the patient and relatives was a 
common source of difficulty which was linked with staff shortages in some descriptions. 
Staffing issues also arose when key personnel were absent due to shift changes, events 
 11 
 
��������� ���� �� ������ �� ��������ants working outside their usual role expectations by 
standing in for more experienced colleagues.  
 
Poor communication between services featured in the descriptions and occurred when 
participants had been given inadequate information by staff from other departments so 
were unable to respond to questions or concerns raised by patients and relatives. The 
�������������� ����� ��� ���������� ��� ����������� ��������� ����� ���� �� ������������ F�� 
example, one participant described how a patient had to wait until their outpatient 
appointment to receive test results and felt this had left the patient in limbo. Organisational 
factors could also exacerbate challenging circumstances where inadequate resources or 
services were provided such as quiet, private spaces free from interruptions and lack of 
appropriate interpreting services.  
 
Patients and relatives  
This theme contained four categories: reactions to information and events, family context, 
breakdown in relationships with the healthcare team and communication barriers. 
Illustrative extracts are detailed in figure four. A significant number of descriptions included 
patient and/or relative reactions that were emotionally heightened such as anger, 
���������� �������� ����� ���������� �� ������������ T�� ����� �������� �� ����-
����������� ���� ������� �� ���� �������� ��� ���� ������� �������� ���� �� ��������� 
multiple meanings. For example, both words were used to describe the following situations: 
when patients/relatives did not want information or events to be true, when they refused to 
accept the reality of the situation, when they could not cope with what was happening or 
when they refused to think about or engage with events.  
 
Family context contained two key elements; issues around disclosure, where one, or more, 
family members wanted to control information provision, and family dynamics where pre-
existing issues, such as long-standing rifts entered the care setting. Tensions could be 
created in the relationships between patients and/or relatives and the healthcare team 
when their expectations of care or treatment differed. Examples included, wanting curative 
treatment after being told the aim was palliative and wanting to live at home when the 
multi-disciplinary team felt this was not feasible.  Barriers to communication were also 
 12 
 
��������� �� ������������� ��������� T���� �������� �������� �� ��������� ���� ������ �� 
hearing problems, events where there was no shared language between the patient/relative 
or healthcare team, difficulties with comprehension due to health related conditions, such 
as dementia or inability to take in the information due to being overwhelmed by events.    
 
 
Individual 
T��� ����� ��������� ������� �������� �� ��� ������������� ��� ���������� ����������� ������ 
and emotional responses. Figure five contains illustrative extracts of these factors. Balancing 
was a key concept in this theme and had both positive and challenging consequences. Many 
descriptions contained evidence that participants felt a sense of responsibility for the care 
����� �������� �������� ��� ���� ������ ���� ���� ������� ��� �� ��� ��������� ���� ���������� 
While this was described in a positive way it could have negative consequences when it 
brought about increased workload and emotional labour that was not matched by 
additional resources. Where events had not gone well feeling responsible was accompanied 
by expressions of negative feelings such as guilt and distress. Evidence of this was seen in 
��� �������� �� ���������� ��������� ���� �� �I ��� ���� ��������� ����� I ���� ���� ������ 
������������� “��� ���� ��������� �������������� ��� ���������� �� �������� ���� ���� ��� 
able to control. Often descriptions revealed how being involved in the process of breaking 
bad news triggered emotional reactions and responses for the participants. This could be 
heightened when the participants identified with the patient or their circumstances. 
  
Descriptive framework     
A descriptive framework was developed to provide a summary of the factors that were 
associated with difficult experiences (figure six). It presents a systematic overview, but many 
of the factors are interrelated as individual descriptions contained elements of multiple 
categories. This is exemplified in the following extracts with the categories identified in bold 
and bracketed: 
 
�H����� �� ���� � �������� ���� ���� ���� ������ ��-�� ���� ������ �����������

and events). Found news difficult and needed a lot of telephone support while

DISCUSSION  
Much of the research into the difficulties and challenges surrounding breaking bad news has 
tended to focus on a specific setting, patient group, subject or problem. This approach has 
provided insights into particular aspects of breaking bad news. By taking a broader inclusive 
approach, this study has identified factors that contribute to difficulties encountered across 
a range of settings, professional groups and scenarios. This provides a framework for 
understanding the challenges associated with the process of breaking bad news.   
 
The findings support the proposal that bad news encompasses diverse subjects and can be 
seen as a process that occurs over time involving the multi-disciplinary team (Eggly et al 
2006, Rassin et al 2013, Griffiths et al 2015). In this current study, descriptions of difficult 
experiences included the subjects traditionally associated with bad news such as 
information about tests, diagnosis and prognosis. However, additional subjects were 
revealed, particularly regarding managing the impact of illness and transitions in care, that 
suggest that the participants in this study had a broad perspective on the type of 
information they classified as bad news.  
 
The range of activities being carried out by participants indicates that that there are multiple 
moments across the healthcare pathway when significant information is given or managed.

functional ability, discharge planning and supporting patients and families through end of 
life care. Their descriptions also revealed how their involvement in the process of breaking 
bad news was not restricted to information provision. For the study participants, engaging 
in activities such as listening to concerns, explaining information, clarifying 
misunderstandings, assisting with decision making and helping patients and relatives cope 
with emotional reactions were ways in which they were involved in breaking bad news.   
 
Many of the themes and categories identified in the study are present in research that has 
explored factors that influence communication around significant information. For example, 
P����� �� �� ������ �������� ���� ���������� ������������ �� ��� ������� ��� 
communication breakdown in cancer care and discovered that influential factors included 
poor information exchange between healthcare providers and insufficient time available to 
spend with patients.  The transition between curative and palliative care has also been 
identified as a challenging subject which can be made more difficult when there is denial, 
conflict or issues around disclosure between family members (Griffiths et al 2015). All of 
these factors were present in the descriptions provided by the participants in our study, 
suggesting they may reflect common experiences.  
 
In developing the thematic framework, it was noted that the descriptions frequently 
contained multiple factors representing more than one theme. This suggests that the 
difficulties faced when engaging in the process of breaking bad news can be influenced by 
multiple, complex and inter-related factors. Some factors will be prevalent in particular 
settings and contexts, for example, different challenges will be faced by those engaged in 
diagnostic and treatment contexts compared with rehabilitation or end of life care. 
However, many were present across contexts, subjects and settings such as time, resources, 
reactions to bad news, family context, personal confidence and support between services. 
While challenges may be experienced differently depending on the context there are 
common factors that shape experiences of being involved in breaking bad news.   
 
There are factors that were not present in our findings that have been described elsewhere.

healthcare staff involved in initiating discussions around the transition to end of life care 
(Griffiths et al 2015, Leung et al 2011, Gauthier 2008) but this did not feature in our 
������������� ������������� F������ ���� ��� ��������� ���� ��� ��������� �� ��� ���������, 
for example staff confidence to introduce subjects (individual factors) and congruence 
between medical and nursing staff that end of life care is the appropriate treatment 
pathway (complex ethical or care events). Our findings may provide a preliminary 
framework that could be developed and refined using evidence from existing literature and 
further research.  
 
Cultural factors can affect the provision of bad news, particularly around diagnosis and 
prognosis (Hancock et al 2007). Information disclosure is the norm in Western Anglo-Saxon 
societies but in some cultures there can be a preference for the family to be given 
information while the patient is not provided with the full facts (Hancock et al 2007). 
Culture does not appear as a separate theme or category in the framework as it did not 
emerge as a consistent theme. Events were usually described in relation to the individual 
preferences and behaviours of the patients and their family. In the majority of the accounts 
where there were issues around disclosure culture was not mentioned in the description 
and it is possible, or likely, that some of these events occurred in white British families. The 
�������� �� ��� ������� ��� ���� ������� �������� H��������� ��� A������� ������ �������� 
that significant differences exist within cultural groups, and individuals may personally wish 
to be informed and involved in decision making even when they are part of a culture that 
prefers non-disclosure. Similarly, not all people of Western Anglo-Saxon cultures want to be 
fully informed (Hancock et al 2007).

descriptions of their difficult experiences to develop insights into the difficulties they 
encountered when involved in the process of breaking bad news (Warnock et al 2010). All of 
the challenges identified in the previous work were present in this current study but 
additional items were revealed.  
 
The approach to data analysis led to the development of a structured framework that has 
multiple potential uses. It can be used by nurses and other healthcare staff to reflect on 
 16 
 
clinical events and practice. It identifies the breadth of knowledge and skills required by 
staff involved in the process of breaking bad news that could provide direction to both 
education commissioners and providers. In particular, it suggests the need to look beyond 
the traditional focus on communication skills in education and include topics such as 
working with family systems, managing ethical dilemmas, conflict resolution, team working 
and supporting coping and adaptation. The framework also highlights factors that need to 
be addressed at an organisational level such as staff resources, availability of facilities to 
support breaking bad news such as interpreters and private spaces and the provision of 
opportunities for structured learning and reflection.   
 
Limitations 
One limitation of the study is that was a carried out within a relatively small geographical 
area in England, UK. While a range of disciplines and clinical settings were included the 
findings may be reflective of a local culture surrounding the provision of bad news. The 
participants were nurses and healthcare staff who were motivated to attend a study day on 
breaking bad news and may have had a particular interest due to their prior experiences. 
Self-report methods were used to obtain the descriptions and no other data was collected 
to triangulate the findings against. These factors may have influenced the content and type 
of descriptions generated.  Other methods, such as in-depth interviews, may have yielded 
different insights into difficult experiences but using self-report descriptions allowed the 
collection of a greater range of perspectives of clinical experiences. There was good 
compliance with the methods used and the diversity may have been difficult to capture 
using other approaches.       
 
Participants represented a breadth of roles and settings but further research is required to 
increase the relevance to other healthcare contexts and events. The framework provides a 
basis for conducting such work.   
 
CONCLUSION 
The breaking bad news framework has been derived from the personal accounts of 
healthcare staff and as such has the potential to capture experiences that reflect clinical

community, hospice and care home settings carry out a diverse range of roles as they 
provide information and support to patients and relatives during significant health related 
events.  They also highlight the ways in which multiple, inter-related factors can act as 
sources of difficulty for healthcare staff engaged in the process of breaking bad news.  
 
Previous guidance on breaking bad news has tended to focus on the way in which 
information is given (for example, Baile et al 2000, Campbell et al 2010). Our framework 
suggests other factors may also be fundamental to ensuring bad news is given well and 
could provide the foundation for developing education, practice and organisational 
interventions that take account of the complexity of the challenges faced.
