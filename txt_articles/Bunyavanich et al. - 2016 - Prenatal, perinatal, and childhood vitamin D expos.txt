 pregnancy, cord blood, and in children at school age (median age 7.7 years, IQR 1.0 years). Tests 
for associations between vitamin D exposure with ever allergic rhinitis, serum total IgE, and 
allergen sensitization at school age were conducted.
Results—The correlations between maternal intake of vitamin D during pregnancy and serum 
25(OH)D levels in pregnant mothers, cord blood, and children at school age were weak to 
moderate (r = −0.03 to 0.53). Each 100 IU/day of food-based vitamin D intake during the first and 
second trimesters (equivalent to the amount of vitamin D in an 8-ounce serving of milk) was 
associated with 21% and 20% reduced odds of ever allergic rhinitis at school age (OR 0.79 (95% 
CI 0.67–0.92) and OR 0.80 (95%CI 0.68–0.93), respectively). There were no associations between 
maternal supplemental vitamin D intake or serum 25(OH)D levels at any time point with ever 
allergic rhinitis. There were no associations between any vitamin D exposure and serum total IgE 
or allergen sensitization at school age.
Conclusions—Inclusion of foods containing vitamin D in maternal diets during pregnancy may 
have beneficial effects on childhood allergic rhinitis.

Introduction
The role of early life vitamin D exposure in the development of childhood allergy remains 
controversial. Vitamin D modulates both the innate and adaptive immune systems, with 
direct effects on B cells, T-cell activation and antigen presenting cells.1–3 Vitamin D 
deficiency may impair epithelial barrier integrity, leading to increased and inappropriate 
mucosal exposure to antigens and a pro-sensitization immune imbalance that compromises 
immunologic tolerance.1, 4 As such, vitamin D has been the focus of many studies 
examining its relationship with allergic disease. Because vitamin D may exert 
immunomodulatory effects in utero as early as the first trimester,1 prenatal vitamin D 
exposure should be considered when examining the potential effects of early-life vitamin D.
Some epidemiologic studies suggest a protective effect of higher vitamin D exposure in 
early life, while other results point to increased odds of childhood allergy or no associations 
with vitamin D exposure.1, 2 Differences in exposure assessment, outcome definitions, study 
population, and study design account for many of these disparate results. The majority of 
studies examining the relationship between vitamin D and allergy outcomes have assessed 
vitamin D at single time points, either via a one-time assessment of dietary intake or serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level.1, 2 These singular measures of exposure each have 
their limitations. While vitamin D intake assessment (via food frequency questionnaire) 
reflects long-term diet,1 it does not account for sun exposure, another source of vitamin D in 
people. On the other hand, while 25(OH)D levels may reflect biologically available vitamin 
D, these levels fluctuate between measurements and season5 and do not capture circulating 
levels of other vitamin D metabolites.6 Distinct modalities of vitamin D assessment capture 
disparate dimensions of its biologic effects, and it is therefore unlikely that a single

 assessment of vitamin D status is sufficient to address whether vitamin D is associated with 
allergic disease.1, 2, 7
The hypothesis of this study was that early life vitamin D exposure is associated with 
allergic rhinitis at school age. This study sought to address the limitations of previous 
studies by examining early life vitamin D exposure in a well-characterized prebirth cohort 
via multiple modalities over time, including assessments of maternal vitamin D intake 
during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy and serum 25(OH)D levels during the 
prenatal, perinatal, and childhood periods. Allergic rhinitis was chosen as the primary 
outcome (with allergic sensitization as a secondary outcome), as few studies of vitamin D 
have focused on allergic rhinitis despite the high population prevalence of this disease.
Methods
Study design and subjects
Project Viva is a prospective, prebirth cohort study of participants recruited from Atrius 
Health, a large multispecialty practice in eastern Massachusetts. The goal of this longitudinal 
epidemiologic cohort was to study dietary factors that could influence health in early life. 
Participants were not selected for any disease. Study details have been previously 
described.8
Enrollment occurred between 1999 and 2002 for women with singleton pregnancy. In-
person interviews and questionnaires were administered after the initial prenatal visit, at an 
average of 10 weeks of gestation, and at 26–28 weeks of gestation. Interviews and 
questionnaires on child health were administered at 6 months, 1 year, and annually 
thereafter. Outcome data for this study was collected between study inception and the school 
age in-person visit (median age 7.7 years, age range 6.6–10.9 years, IQR 1.0 years). Study 
protocols were approved by the institutional review boards of participating institutions. Of 
the 2128 children delivered in Project Viva, 1248 mother-child pairs who came to the school 
age in-person visit and responded to the questionnaire item regarding allergic rhinitis or had 
allergen sensitization measured were included in this study.
Maternal dietary and supplemental vitamin D intake assessment
Maternal dietary assessments at the first and second trimester visits were based on a 
validated 166-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) modified for 
pregnancy9 that has been previously described10 and is fully available here: https://
www.hms.harvard.edu/viva/Data-collection-forms/early-preg-ffq1.pdf. Food-based intake of 
vitamin D was calculated by summing the amount of vitamin D in foods in the FFQ 
containing vitamin D based on the Harvard nutrient composition database used for the 
Nurses’ Health Study and other large cohort studies.11 Supplement-based intake of vitamin 
D was calculated based on queried dose, duration, and brand/type of multivitamin, 
prescribed prenatal vitamin, and supplements by separate interview during the first trimester, 
and by self-completed questionnaire during the second trimester.10 Total vitamin D intake 
was the sum of vitamin D from food and supplement sources. Vitamin D intake was energy-
adjusted using the nutrient residual method.12

 Serum 25(OH)D assessment during the prenatal, perinatal, and childhood periods
Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured at three time points: in mothers during the second 
trimester of pregnancy, in cord blood at birth, and in children at school age. Each sample 
was analyzed in duplicate for 25(OH)D concentration, once using an automated 
chemiluminescence immunoassay,13 and once using a manual radioimmunoassay.14 As has 
been done in prior studies, two values were averaged to obtain more stable estimates of 
25(OH)D level.15–17 For quality control, the laboratory used U.S. National Institutes of 
Standards and Technology level 1.
Childhood outcomes
Ever allergic rhinitis at school age was defined as positive if a mother answered yes to “Have 
you ever been told by a health care professional, such as a doctor, physician assistant or 
nurse practitioner, that your child has hay fever, seasonal allergies or allergic rhinitis (runny 
nose due to allergies)?” at the school age interview. This question was based on the 
questionnaire from the International Study of Asthma and Childhood.18 Maternal and 
paternal asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis were each considered positive if a 
mother reported at week 10 of gestation that she or the child’s biological father had a history 
of the respective condition. Maternal allergy was considered positive if maternal asthma, 
allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis was positive, and paternal allergy was defined 
analogously. Parental allergy was considered positive if maternal or paternal allergy was 
positive.
Of the 1248 children in the analysis sample, 702 had blood drawn at school age for 
additional studies, of which 616 children had sufficient sample to measure serum total IgE 
and allergen specific IgE (sIgE levels) by Phadia ImmunoCAP (Uppsala, Sweden). A variety 
of perennial and seasonal environmental allergens common to the United States Northeast 
were assessed, including Dermatophagoides farinae, Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria 
alternata, rye grass, ragweed, cat dander, dog dander, and Blattella germanica. Sensitization 
to environmental allergens was considered positive if the subject had an allergen specific IgE 
level ≥ 0.35 kU/L to any of the environmental allergens tested.
Statistical analyses
Spearman rank correlation was used to assess the pairwise correlation between measures of 
vitamin D. Unadjusted and multivariable adjusted logistic regression models were used to 
examine associations between vitamin D measures and ever allergic rhinitis at school age. 
For ease of interpretation, 100 IU of vitamin D (the amount of vitamin D in an 8 ounce glass 
of milk) was used as the unit of exposure for vitamin D intake, and 25 nmol/ml of serum 
25(OH)D was used as the unit of exposure for serum measures of vitamin D. Models 
included as covariates factors that could confound the association of vitamin D with allergic 
rhinitis, including maternal education, maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), 
smoking during pregnancy, parity at enrollment, parental allergy, and child sex, ethnicity, 
season of birth, breastfeeding history, and child BMI at school age. To explore potential bias 
related to follow up at school age, sensitivity analyses limited to subjects with school age 
25(OH)D levels (n=652) were performed. In the 616 subjects for whom serum total IgE 
levels and environmental allergen sensitization status were available, association testing was

 performed for vitamin D and these intermediate phenotypes of allergy. All analyses were 
performed using R 2.15.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and 
SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Study population
The baseline characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1. Compared to the 880 
participants excluded, the 1248 participants with school age data included showed higher 
proportions of maternal Caucasian ethnicity (69% vs. 63%), maternal college or graduate 
education (69% vs. 58%), annual household income exceeding $70,000 (63% vs. 58%), and 
parental allergy (59% vs. 57%). Compared to the general US population,19 the study 
population contained a higher proportion of African Americans and lower proportion of 
Hispanics. The majority of mothers were college-educated and most households were not 
low income. Rates of parental asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis were consistent 
with those for the general US population.20–22
Maternal intake of vitamin D by food, supplement, and all sources was higher during the 
second trimester than the first trimester (Table 1). Serum 25(OH)D levels were < 50 nmol/L 
(“deficient” per Endocrine Society guidelines23) in 33% of mothers during the second 
trimester, 61% of infants, and 18% of children at school age. Of note, norms for cord blood 
25(OH)D are not well-established, and guidelines for adult serum 25(OH)D are typically 
applied.23
Among the 616 children in with IgE levels, serum total IgE levels ranged from 2 to 3284 
kU/L with a geometric mean level of 48.5 kU/L (Table 1). 42% of children were sensitized 
to at least one of the 8 environmental allergens tested at school age. The prevalence of ever 
allergic rhinitis at school age (23.8%) was consistent with the 10–30% prevalence of allergic 
rhinitis reported for Americans.21
Weak to moderate correlations between pairs of vitamin D measures
There was moderate correlation between total maternal vitamin D intake during the first and 
second trimesters (r=0.38), and relatively low correlation between these intake measures and 
maternal, cord blood, and childhood serum 25(OH)D levels (Figure 1A). Maternal serum 
25(OH)D levels modestly correlated with cord blood levels (r=0.53), and cord blood levels 
modestly correlated with childhood serum levels (r=0.46), but maternal and child levels were 
not well correlated (r=0.29).
Comparisons of the mode of maternal vitamin D intake during the first and second trimesters 
showed no significant correlation between vitamin D intake by food and by supplement 
during the first trimester, and low correlation during the second trimester (r=0.10) (Figure 
1B). Intake of vitamin D by food sources was moderately correlated between the first and 
second trimesters (r=0.54), while intake of supplemental vitamin D weakly correlated 
between the first and second trimesters (r=0.28).

 Food-based vitamin D intake during pregnancy is associated with reduced odds of ever 
allergic rhinitis at school age
Each additional 100 IU of maternal intake of food-based vitamin D (the amount of vitamin 
D contained in an 8-ounce glass of milk) during the first trimester was associated with a 
21% reduced odds of ever allergic rhinitis at school age in our adjusted model (OR 0.79, 
95%CI 0.67–0.92) (Figure 2). Similarly, each additional 100IU of maternal intake of food-
based vitamin D during the second trimester was associated with a 20% reduced odds of 
ever allergic rhinitis at school age (OR 0.80, 95%CI 0.68–0.93). There were no associations 
between maternal intake of supplemental vitamin D and ever allergic rhinitis at school age 
(OR 1.00, 95%CI 0.91–1.10 for first trimester supplemental intake, and OR 0.98, 95%CI 
0.88–1.10 for second trimester supplemental intake). Adjusted models also did not show 
associations between serum 25(OH)D levels measured during the second trimester in 
mothers, in cord blood, and at school age in children with allergic rhinitis by school age.
Similarly, sensitivity analyses constrained to subjects with school age 25(OH)D levels 
(n=652) showed that maternal intake of food-based vitamin D during the first and second 
trimesters were associated with 21–22% reduced odds of ever allergic rhinitis at school age 
(Supplementary Table S1), with no associations between maternal supplemental or total 
vitamin D intake and this outcome. In this subset, maternal 25(OH)D during the second 
trimester was associated with 27% reduced odds of ever allergic rhinitis at school age. There 
were no associations between cord blood or school age 25(OH)D levels and allergic rhinitis.
No association between vitamin D and serum total IgE or environmental allergen 
sensitization
There were no associations between maternal vitamin D intake (food-based, supplemental, 
or total) and serum total IgE at school age (Supplementary Figure 1A). There were also no 
associations between any of the serum 25(OH)D levels (second trimester in mothers, in cord 
blood, and at school age in children) and serum total IgE at school age (Supplementary 
Figure 1B). Likewise, the adjusted models did not show associations between vitamin D 
measures and sensitization to environmental allergens (Figure 3).
Discussion
Main findings
We found that higher maternal intake of food-based vitamin D during the first and second 
trimesters of pregnancy was associated with ~20% lower risk of ever allergic rhinitis at 
school age. A protective association between vitamin D and childhood allergic rhinitis was 
not seen with prenatal intake of supplemental vitamin D or with serum 25(OH)D levels in 
mothers during pregnancy, during the perinatal period (cord blood), or in children during 
school age.
A major strength of this study is that vitamin D exposure in this prospective prebirth cohort 
was multiply assessed by two methods (intake and serum 25(OH)D level) and at three time 
points (prenatal, perinatal, and childhood). Many studies examining the relationship between

 vitamin D and allergy have examined vitamin D intake or serum level individually, and 
typically at single time points.1, 2
This study’s finding of an association between food-based (but not supplemental) vitamin D 
intake and reduced odds of ever allergic rhinitis at school age may be due to biologically 
available forms of vitamin D that are present in foods but not in supplements. 
Unmetabolized forms of vitamin D include cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol 
(vitamin D2).7 These must be activated into the hormone 1,25(OH)2D for vitamin D to 
function in the body, or are converted to 25(OH)D, the storage form.24 Vitamin D intake (by 
food and/or supplement) is quantified by estimating intake of unmetabolized vitamin D (e.g. 
combining vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 intake). This approach may reasonably reflect the 
vitamin D content of supplements, which are typically vitamin D2 and D3, as well as the 
vitamin D content of foods that are fortified with vitamin D2 and D3 (e.g. milk, breakfast 
foods, orange juice). However, foods from animal sources that naturally contain vitamin D 
(e.g. all types of meats) also contain 25(OH)D. 25(OH)D is not currently accounted for in 
usual measures of food-based vitamin D intake. Not accounting for 25(OH)D naturally 
present in animal-based foods is problematic, because the presence of this metabolite raises 
the vitamin D content of these particular foods.7 Indeed, a recent study examining USDA 
data showed that accounting for the 25(OH)D content of animal-based foods reduced 
discrepancies between vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D levels.7 It is therefore possible 
that this study found significant associations with food-based vitamin D intake because 
intake measures covaried with additional 25(OH)D in these foods.
The study’s finding of a protective effect of maternal vitamin D intake from food sources but 
not from supplemental vitamin D intake or 25(OH)D levels may also be due to nutrients that 
accompany vitamin D in vitamin D-containing foods. These nutrients may reduce the odds 
of allergic rhinitis either directly or in synergy with vitamin D. Many studies in nutritional 
epidemiology have focused on specific nutrients and their association with asthma and 
allergy outcomes, with unresolved questions about whether individual nutrients are 
responsible for the associations observed, or whether they are markers of other nutrients or 
overall dietary pattern.25, 26 Foods are a rich mixture of many nutrients, and consistent with 
the concept of “food synergy” 26, there may be interactive effects on allergic diathesis 
between vitamin D and other nutrients in vitamin D-containing foods. This study’s finding 
of a protective effect of vitamin D from food sources could be because the vitamin D content 
of vitamin D-containing foods is a marker of the beneficial food synergy in these foods.
Comparison with other studies
Consistent with this study, Erkkola and colleagues reported an inverse relationship between 
maternal food-based intake of vitamin D during late pregnancy and allergic rhinitis in 5-
year-old children. The subjects of this Finnish cohort had HLA-DQB1-conferred 
susceptibility for Type 1 diabetes.27 A relative strength of our study is that subjects were 
unselected for any disease or condition, which supports the generalizability of this study’s 
findings. An additional relative strength of our study is minimal recall bias-- mothers 
completed FFQs during the first and second trimesters, before any outcomes in their children 
occurred. In contrast, Erkkola et al. retrospectively assessed food intake during pregnancy by 
Bunyavanich et al.

 asking mothers of these diabetes susceptible children after delivery to recall their diet during 
the eighth month of pregnancy. Additionally, our examination of maternal intake of vitamin 
D occurred at two points during pregnancy. Maternal diet changes during pregnancy,10, 28 
and this is particularly important to consider when examining vitamin D because maternal 
intake of vitamin D-rich foods varies between trimesters. For example, intake of skim or 
reduced fat dairy foods increases by 22%, of whole dairy foods by 15%, and of red and 
processed meats by 11% between the first and second trimesters of pregnancy.10 In our 
study, the inverse association between food-based vitamin D intake and ever allergic rhinitis 
at school age was present during both the first and second trimesters.
In contrast to this study’s findings and those of Erkkola et al., Maslova et al. found no 
association between vitamin D intake during the second trimester and childhood allergic 
rhinitis at age 7 years in the Danish Birth Cohort Study.5 Mothers in our study had higher 
levels of vitamin D exposure than those in the Danish study-- the median second trimester 
vitamin D intake by mothers in our prebirth cohort was 31% higher, with 80% higher 
median food-based intake and 19% higher median supplemental intake. The relatively 
higher vitamin D exposures in our study may have enabled detection of associations between 
maternal vitamin D intake and childhood allergic rhinitis.
We had hypothesized that there would be an association between vitamin D exposure and 
allergic rhinitis because a growing body of literature supports that vitamin D has 
immunomodulatory functions relevant to allergic disease.1–3 However, it was unclear from 
prior studies which mode of vitamin D exposure in early life would have greatest effect. This 
study’s results support that maternal food-based vitamin D intake during the first and second 
trimesters of pregnancy are exposures of high interest. This is consistent with the fact that 
early pregnancy is a formative period of fetal immune system development, with early forms 
of many cells involved in allergy developing and potentially influenced during this period. 
For example, during the first trimester, early dendritic and macrophage cells develop, 
positive and negative T cell selection occurs, immunoglobulin isotypes develop, and IgE 
production begins.1–3 As maternal vitamin D is bioavailable to the fetus during this time,1 
maternal intake of vitamin D during early pregnancy could modulate the fetal immune 
system toward or away from allergic disorders in childhood.
Null findings
Although higher maternal intake of food-based vitamin D during pregnancy was associated 
with lower odds of ever allergic rhinitis at school age, there were no associations between 
serum 25(OH)D levels and this outcome (Figure 2). This was the case whether the serum 
level was assayed from mothers during the second trimester, cord blood, or the children at 
school age. Previous studies examining maternal,29 cord blood30–32 or childhood serum 
levels of 25(OH)D33–35 in many different populations (Danish, Australian, German, and 
Asian) have similarly reported no association with allergic rhinitis. The distinct association 
between vitamin D intake (as compared to serum 25(OH)D levels) with the development in 
allergic rhinitis may be because 25(OH)D levels fluctuate between measurement and 
season5, while vitamin D intake assessment (via food frequency questionnaire) reflects long-
term diet and may be a more accurate measure of vitamin D exposure.1

 Although there was an inverse association between maternal intake of food-based vitamin D 
during pregnancy with ever allergic rhinitis at school age, there was no association between 
vitamin D by any measure and serum total IgE or environmental allergen sensitization 
(Supplementary Figure 1, Figure 3). As environmental allergen sensitization and serum total 
IgE are intermediate phenotypes of allergic rhinitis and allergy, it may seem counterintuitive 
that vitamin D intake was not also associated with these outcomes, but these null findings 
can be explained in several ways. First, allergic rhinitis results from environmental allergen 
sensitization that leads to naso-ocular symptoms upon exposure to the corresponding 
allergen.36 But environmental sensitization may not necessarily lead to symptoms of allergic 
rhinitis, so these outcomes are never in complete agreement. Indeed, in the 616 children who 
had serum total and allergen specific IgE levels measured in the cohort, 26% were sensitized 
to an environmental allergen but did not report allergic rhinitis. Vitamin D intake may be 
associated with risk for sensitization that leads to an allergic phenotype, but not with 
sensitization only. Second, environmental sensitization was based on allergen specific IgE 
levels to 8 common indoor and outdoor environmental allergens. The inclusion of more 
environmental allergens in our sensitization assessment may have changed the outcome. 
Third, tests for association between vitamin D and allergen sensitization were restricted to 
the 616 children for whom serum total and allergen-specific IgE levels were available, while 
the full school age cohort (n=1277) was used for the primary analysis of allergic rhinitis. 
That said, a previous study examining 18,224 subjects similarly found no association 
between serum 25(OH)D levels and allergen sensitization, and power was not likely a 
limitation in that large study.37 As context, results of studies examining the relationship 
between early-life vitamin D exposure and serum IgE levels have been very inconsistent, 
with studies showing inverse,38–40 non-linear,30 and null31, 37, 41, 42 relationships.
Limitations
In an effort to address the limitations of previous studies, where single measures of vitamin 
D exposure were typically employed, 1, 2, 7 vitamin D exposure was measured by two 
methods (food intake questionnaire and serum 25(OH)D level) and at three time intervals 
(prenatal, perinatal, school age) in this study. Our focus on multiple exposures may raise 
concern regarding multiple testing, but this is strongly counterbalanced by the benefit of 
having multiple measures of vitamin D in a single cohort, as single measures of vitamin D 
exposure incompletely capture its potential effects.1, 2, 7
Conclusions
In conclusion, we performed a multifaceted assessment of vitamin D exposure during early 
life in a prebirth cohort of mothers and children unselected for any disease. Weak to 
moderate correlations between maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy and serum 
25(OH)D levels during the prenatal, perinatal, and childhood periods were observed. Food-
based, but not supplemental, vitamin D intake by mothers during the first and second 
trimesters was associated with 20% reduced odds of ever allergic rhinitis at school age. 
There were no associations between any other measure of vitamin D and allergic rhinitis; 
likewise, all measures of vitamin D were not associated with serum total IgE level or 
environmental allergen sensitization at school age. This study’s results provide further

 Key Messages
•
Higher maternal intake of food-based vitamin D during pregnancy was 
associated with reduced odds of ever allergic rhinitis at school age.
•
Supplemental vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D levels during the prenatal, 
perinatal, or childhood periods) were not associated with ever allergic rhinitis at 
school age.
•
Inclusion of foods containing vitamin D in maternal diets during pregnancy may 
have beneficial effects on childhood allergic rhinitis.

 Figure 1. Correlation between vitamin D measures obtained during the prenatal, perinatal, and 
childhood periods in Project Viva participants
A: Spearman rank correlation coefficients are shown for tests of correlation between total 
maternal vitamin D intake during the first and second trimesters, maternal serum 25(OH)D 
level during the second trimester, cord blood 25(OH)D level, and child serum 25(OH)D level 
at school age. B: Spearman rank correlation coefficients are shown for tests of correlation 
between maternal intake of vitamin D analyzed by source, including food, supplemental, and 
total intakes during the first and second trimesters. Color scale and eccentricity of the shapes 
correspond to numerical values of Spearman rank correlation coefficients. All Spearman 
rank correlation coefficients in this figure were statistically significant (at P value ranging 
from < 2.2 × 10−16 to 0.0009), except for the three correlation coefficients marked with *.

 Figure 2. Associations between vitamin D measures (obtained during the prenatal, perinatal, and 
childhood periods) and ever allergic rhinitis at school age
The unit of exposure for intake was 100IU/day (the amount of vitamin D contained in an 8 
ounce serving of milk) and the unit for serum 25(OH)D level was 25 nmol/L. Models were 
adjusted for potential confounders, including maternal education, pre-pregnancy BMI, 
smoking during pregnancy, parity at enrollment, parental allergy, and child sex, ethnicity, 
season of birth, breastfeeding history, and BMI at school age. A forest plot is shown for 
results from the adjusted models.

 Figure 3. Associations between vitamin D measures (obtained during the prenatal, perinatal, and 
childhood periods) and environmental allergen sensitization at school age
The unit of exposure for intake was 100IU/day (the amount of vitamin D contained in an 8 
ounce serving of milk) and the unit for serum 25(OH)D level was 25 nmol/L. Environmental 
allergen sensitization was based on allergen specific IgE level ≥ 0.35 kU/L to any of the 
environmental allergens tested. Models were adjusted for potential confounders, including 
maternal education, pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy, parity at enrollment, 
parental allergy, and child sex, ethnicity, season of birth, breastfeeding history, and BMI at 
school age. A forest plot is shown for results from the adjusted models.
