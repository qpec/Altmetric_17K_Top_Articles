Background: Youth athletes with intensive sports participation are at an increased risk
of sustaining injuries. Neuromuscular training programs reduce sports-related injury risk
in this population, however, the dose-response relationship is largely unknown. Thus,
the aim of this meta-analysis was to identify the optimal frequency, volume, duration,
and period of neuromuscular training to prevent injuries in youth athletes.
Methods:
Computerized database searches (PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, The
Cochrane Library, PEDro) were conducted in January 2017, with search terms related
to youth sports, neuromuscular training, and injury prevention. Eligible trials (i) evaluated
a neuromuscular training program; (ii) included youth athletes of 21 years or younger;
(iii) had an analytical design (RCTs, quasi-experimental, cohort studies); (iv) contained
original data; (v) and provided injury data. Two reviewers independently extracted data
and assessed quality of eligible studies. Injury rate ratios (IRRs) for lower extremity injuries
were pooled meta-analytically, and moderator analyses examined the effect of training
frequency, duration, volume, and period.
Results: Data from 16 trials yielded an overall risk reduction of 42% with neuromuscular
training (IRR = 0.58, 95%CI 0.47–0.72). Training frequencies of two (IRR = 0.50; 95%CI
0.29–0.86) or three times (IRR = 0.40; 95%CI 0.31–0.53) per week revealed the largest
risk reduction, and a weekly training volume of more than 30 min tended to be more
effective compared to lower volumes. Programs with 10–15 min (IRR = 0.55; 95%CI
0.42–0.72) session duration produced effects comparable to those with longer session
duration (IRR = 0.60; 95%CI 0.46–0.76). Interventions lasting more than 6 months were
not superior to shorter programs.
Conclusion:
This meta-analysis revealed that NMT performed in short bouts of
10–15 min, two to three times per week, with a weekly training volume of 30–60 min
had the largest preventive effect for lower extremity injuries in youth athletes. These
effects can be achieved within 20–60 sessions and training periods of <6 months. The
present results are derived from a relatively small number of studies with heterogeneous
methodological quality and should be treated with caution.
The study was a priori registered at PROSPERO (CRD42016053473).

Dose-Response Relationship of Neuromuscular Training
INTRODUCTION
The high participation rates as well as a growing specialization
and professionalization of sports in young ages entail multiple
benefits. However, this comes at the expense of an increased
risk of injury and illness. The sport-related injury risk of youth
athletes has been demonstrated in a variety of age ranges and
sport activities (Pickett et al., 2005; Emery and Tyreman, 2009),
with incidence rates of up to 34.4/1,000 h of sport exposure
reported in young male ice hockey players for instance (Caine
et al., 2008). These data emphasize the urgent need for developing
effective strategies to prevent injuries. Hence, a growing number
of injury prevention programs have been developed in recent
years, with the majority containing multiple exercise components
addressing neuromuscular performance (Emery et al., 2015). The
positive effects of neuromuscular training (NMT) programs on
the incidence of injuries in adults are well established (Hübscher
et al., 2010; Lauersen et al., 2014; Schiftan et al., 2015; al
Attar et al., 2016). A recent meta-analysis found that a soccer-
specific NMT program reduced injury rates by 20–50% (al Attar
et al., 2016). Regarding ankle injuries, neuromuscular multi-
intervention, and proprioceptive programs have been found
to decrease risk by 35–50% in sporting adult populations
(Hübscher et al., 2010; Schiftan et al., 2015). Similar effects have
also been reported for youth athletes. Two meta-analyses have
demonstrated a risk reduction for lower extremity injuries of
around 25–35% (Emery et al., 2015; Soomro et al., 2016).
While the preventive effects of neuromuscular interventions
in youth athletes are indisputable, little is known with
respect to their optimal dose. The investigated programs vary
substantially with respect to training content and individual
dosage parameters. Neuromuscular injury prevention programs
for youth athletes have been examined in various sports,
including basketball (Hewett et al., 1999; McGuine and Keene,
2006; Emery et al., 2007; LaBella et al., 2011), handball
(Wedderkopp et al., 1999; Olsen et al., 2005), soccer (Hewett
et al., 1999; Heidt et al., 2000; Malliou et al., 2004; Mandelbaum
et al., 2005; Soligard et al., 2008; Steffen et al., 2008), and
volleyball (Hewett et al., 1999; Heidt et al., 2000). Besides
sport-specific contents, these programs typically either include
multiple components, or focus on balance exercises (Hübscher
et al., 2010; Zech et al., 2010). Frequent contents of multi-
intervention programs include strength, balance, flexibility,
plyometric, speed, and agility exercises (Hübscher et al., 2010),
thereby focusing on neuromuscular control and active joint
stabilization. Importantly, parameters such as the duration
and volume of single training sessions, the training frequency,
the intervention volume or training period vary substantially
between individual studies (Soomro et al., 2016). Hence, it is
difficult to infer the most effective training prescription based
on findings from individual studies. A better understanding of
dose-response relationships is a fundamental basis for designing
well-tailored, population-specific exercise programs.
At present, prospective studies on the analysis of the dose-
response relationship in NMT programs are lacking. In adult
athletes, preliminary evidence has suggested that a session
duration of at least 10 min, and a training frequency of more
than once a week for at least 3 months is necessary in order to
prevent injuries (Hübscher et al., 2010). In addition, the optimal
dose to prevent anterior cruciate ligament injuries in female
athletes should include training for at least twice a week, with
a minimum of 20 min per session (Sugimoto et al., 2014). Two
recent meta-analyses which investigated dosage-effects of balance
training, a key component of NMT programs, reported the
largest improvements in neuromuscular outcomes with training
frequencies of three times a week, session durations of 11–15 min,
and training periods of ∼12 weeks (Zech et al., 2010; Lesinski
et al., 2015). In youth athletes on the other hand, information on
the optimal dose of NMT is scarce. However, such information is
particularly relevant in this population, considering the biological
and anthropometric inter-individual differences caused by the
maturational status. The little data available on dose-response
relationships has suggested that training periods of more than 8
months have comparable preventive effects compared to shorter
periods (Soomro et al., 2016). From a practical point of view,
a deeper understanding of the best training dosage is crucial
for tailoring training parameters to the specific population, and
would increase coaches’ and athletes’ confidence in applying
NMT programs (van Tiggelen et al., 2008; Zech and Wellmann,
2017).
Taken together, although NMT programs have demonstrated
preventive effects in youth athletic populations, no consistent
recommendations can be inferred from the current literature
with respect to the duration, frequency, volume and training
period of such programs. Establishing the minimal and optimal
effective dose would not only help practitioners in designing
tailored programs, but could also increase coaches’ and athletes’
compliance to such interventions (van Tiggelen et al., 2008;
Zech and Wellmann, 2017). This is particularly relevant
in youth athletes, where differences in maturational status
can cause large inter-individual variation in anthropometrics
and neuromuscular performance. Consequently, this systematic
review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate dose-response
relationships of NMT programs to prevent lower extremity
injuries in adolescent athletes. Specifically, the optimal training
frequency, session duration, training volume, and intervention
period were targeted to provide recommendations for sports
practice.
METHODS
This systematic review and meta-analysis was preregistered
(registration number: CRD42016053473) at the international
prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO). The
registration protocol is accessible at http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/
PROSPERO/display_record.asp?ID=CRD42016053473.
Search Strategy
A systematic computerized database search was conducted in
five databases (PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, The Cochrane
Library, PEDro) from their inception up until January 12,
2017. Articles in English and published in peer-reviewed
journals were considered. We developed a systematic search
strategy by clustering key terms according to the PICOS

 Steib et al.
Dose-Response Relationship of Neuromuscular Training
(Patient/Problem, Intervention, Control/Comparison, Outcome,
Study design) strategy. Selected key words related to youth sports,
neuromuscular training, and injury prevention were connected
using Boolean terms. A detailed list of the exact terms and search
strategies used is provided in the Supplementary Material. In
addition to electronic database searching, the reference lists of
articles were searched during full text screening in an effort to
obtain additional eligible studies.
Selection Criteria
Based on the PICOS strategy, the following criteria had to
be fulfilled in order for studies to be considered in this
meta-analysis: (i) the study population consisted of youths of
21 years or younger (Malina et al., 2015), participating in
structured/organized sport programs on a competitive level (P);
(ii) a neuromuscular training program (including components
such as balance, agility, strength, neuromuscular control) was
evaluated with no co-interventions (e.g., education) provided
(I); (iii) the study contained a control arm either performing
usual practice routine or sham exercises without specific focus
on neuromuscular control (C); (iv) data for at least one outcome
of lower extremity sports injury was provided (O); and (v)
an analytical design was used (RCTs, quasi-experimental trials,
cohort studies) (S). Studies without original data (review articles)
or without obtainable data for meta-analysis were excluded.
Risk of Bias Assessment
We analyzed risk of bias of included studies using the PEDro
scale (Maher et al., 2003). This scale consists of eleven items,
addressing internal validity (8 items), interpretability (2 items),
and external validity (1 item). A point was scored for each item
clearly fulfilling the criterion, allowing a maximal score of 11
points. Two reviewers (SST, ALR) independently performed the
quality rating. Disagreements between ratings were discussed
and solved via consensus. This process was piloted on three
studies not included in the review before actual quality rating was
performed.
Data Extraction
Two
researchers
(SST,
ALR)
extracted
predefined
study
characteristics from publications and collected the information
in
tabular
form.
These
characteristics
included
authors,
publication year, study design, participants (age, gender, sports,
expertise level, sample size), interventions (types of exercises,
training
period,
training
frequency,
number
of
sessions,
and session duration for experimental and control groups,
respectively), and results (type of injury, injury incidence by
type/ location, player exposures).
Outcome Measures
Data was extracted for lower extremity (LE) injury, including any
form of muscular, ligamentous or bony injuries (traumatic or
overuse). If available, the total number of LE injuries was used
for meta-analysis. In cases where studies only reported knee or
ankle injuries, this data was used accordingly.
NMT dosage was divided into the following components:
training session duration and frequency, weekly volume, and
total intervention volume and period.
– Session duration: The time (minutes) spent for one NMT
session.
– Training frequency: The weekly number of NMT sessions.
– Weekly training volume: The time (minutes) per week spent
for NMT (training frequency x session duration).
– Intervention volume: The total number of training sessions,
equaling the sum of all sessions throughout the intervention
period.
– Intervention period: The total intervention duration in weeks.
For moderator analyses, further subgroups were formed within
each variable: session duration was categorized into low
(10–15 min), medium (20–30 min), and high (>30 min); training
frequency was clustered into 1x, 2x, 3x, and >3x per week; weekly
volume was categorized as low (<30 min), medium (30–60 min),
and high (>60); intervention volume was clustered into low (<30
sessions), moderate (30–60 sessions), and high (>90 sessions);
and intervention period was separated into short term (≤6
months) and long-term (>6 months).
Statistical Analysis
Meta-Analysis
All analyses were performed using the Cochrane review manager
(version 5.3.5, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen).
Injury rate ratios (IRRs) with corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were calculated representing an effect estimate
for each included study: IRR = (number of injuries in
NMT group/player exposures)/(number of injuries in control
group/player exposures). In cases where player exposure hours
were not available, IRRs were calculated using the players’
number of practice and game exposures. The IRR resembles
a ratio of the within-group (NMT, control) injury incidence
rates. Consequently, a value smaller than 1 indicates an injury
risk reduction in favor of NMT, and the closer the value
to 0, the larger is the effect. Both cluster RCTs and cohort
studies were included in this meta-analysis, and sensitivity
analyses indicated that no systematic difference in effect sizes
existed between these study designs (I2 = 0%; Q = 0.14;
p = 0.71).
As significant heterogeneity in individual studies’ IRRs
was present (I2 = 71%, Q = 55.77; p < 0.0001), the
assumption of a unified true intervention effect was dismissed.
Consequently, a random effect model (inverse-variance) was
used for weighting individual studies and estimating the overall
pooled effect size (IRR). Z statistics and respective P-values were
calculated to assess whether this effect was statistically significant.
Heterogeneity between studies’ IRRs were observed using chi-
squared tests, and I2 values were calculated to quantify the
proportion (in %) of observed variance.
Sensitivity analyses were performed for the influence of study
design (RCT vs. cohort study) and study quality on the overall
effect, in order to detect potential bias from studies with lower
levels of internal validity.

Dose-Response Relationship of Neuromuscular Training
Moderator Analysis
Moderator analyses were performed in order to examine whether
specific dosage features would have a stronger effect on injury risk
reduction. The following moderators were examined: (i) training
frequency; (ii) training session duration; (iii) weekly training
volume; (iv) total number of training sessions; (v) intervention
period.
For each moderator, subgroups were defined as described
above (data extraction). A pooled effect estimate was then
calculated for each subgroup containing at least two studies,
and differences between subgroups were tested by assessing
heterogeneity across subgroup effects using chi-squared tests.
Besides statistical comparison, we descriptively compared
subgroups IRRs, considering a ≥10% difference as meaningful
(Soomro et al., 2016). Meta-regression was not performed due
to the limited number of studies and the lack of precision in
the continuous data (e.g., training session duration data reported
resembled the prescribed duration, rather than the actually
performed and precisely measured time).
RESULTS
Trial Flow
Our search strategy identified a total of 1261 records (Figure 1).
We screened titles and abstracts from 904 articles after duplicate
removal. From these, 849 were discarded and full texts obtained
from the remaining 55 articles. After full text screening, another
39 articles were excluded, mostly due to lack of original data
or inadequate study population. Consequently, 16 trials were
included in the final meta-analysis.
Study Characteristics
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included studies. The
sample size varies substantially, from 54 (Cumps et al., 2007) up
to 4,546 (Walden et al., 2012). In six studies, both male and female
athletes were examined (Hewett et al., 1999; Olsen et al., 2005;
McGuine and Keene, 2006; Cumps et al., 2007; Emery et al., 2007;
Emery and Meeuwisse, 2010), while two studies focused on male
athletes (Longo et al., 2012; Owoeye et al., 2014), and seven trials
on females only (Wedderkopp et al., 1999; Mandelbaum et al.,
2005; Pfeiffer et al., 2006; Soligard et al., 2008; Steffen et al., 2008;
LaBella et al., 2011; Walden et al., 2012). The mean age of the
participants varied between 14 (Walden et al., 2012) and 17 years
(Steffen et al., 2008; Owoeye et al., 2014), and age groups typically
ranged from 12 to 18 years. With respect to players’ competitive
level, 12 studies focused on sub-elite athletes organized in clubs
(Mandelbaum et al., 2005; Olsen et al., 2005; Soligard et al., 2008;
Emery and Meeuwisse, 2010; Walden et al., 2012) or high-school
sports (Hewett et al., 1999; McGuine and Keene, 2006; Pfeiffer
et al., 2006; Emery et al., 2007; McHugh et al., 2007; Steffen
et al., 2008; LaBella et al., 2011). Three studies investigated elite
players (Cumps et al., 2007; Longo et al., 2012; Owoeye et al.,
2014), and one study included a mixed sample (Wedderkopp
et al., 1999). All trials studied team sport athletes, with soccer
(Mandelbaum et al., 2005; Pfeiffer et al., 2006; Soligard et al.,
2008; Steffen et al., 2008; Emery and Meeuwisse, 2010; Walden
et al., 2012; Owoeye et al., 2014), and basketball (Cumps et al.,
2007; Emery et al., 2007; Longo et al., 2012) being the most
common. The NMT programs typically consisted of either
multiple components (generally strength, balance, and agility)
or balance exercises only. The most commonly investigated
standardized multi-component programs were FIFA “the 11”
(Steffen et al., 2008) or FIFA “11+” (Soligard et al., 2008; Longo
et al., 2012; Owoeye et al., 2014). Balance training only was used
in six studies (Wedderkopp et al., 1999; McGuine and Keene,
2006; Cumps et al., 2007; Emery et al., 2007; McHugh et al., 2007).
The training parameters reported in the included studies were
as follows: The duration of NMT sessions varied from 5 to 10
(Cumps et al., 2007) up to 60–90 min (Hewett et al., 1999), but the
majority of trials (N = 12) implemented sessions of 15–20 min
length (Wedderkopp et al., 1999; Mandelbaum et al., 2005; Olsen
et al., 2005; Pfeiffer et al., 2006; Emery et al., 2007; Soligard et al.,
2008; Steffen et al., 2008; Emery and Meeuwisse, 2010; LaBella
et al., 2011; Longo et al., 2012; Walden et al., 2012; Owoeye et al.,
2014). Training frequencies of two and three times a week were
most common, however, three studies reported one (Olsen et al.,
2005; Steffen et al., 2008) or five (Emery et al., 2007) weekly
sessions. The intervention period varied between 6 (Hewett et al.,
1999) and 40 weeks (Wedderkopp et al., 1999), and the total
number of scheduled training sessions ranged from 18 (Hewett
et al., 1999) to 140 sessions (Wedderkopp et al., 1999).
Methodological Quality
Table 2 presents the methodological quality assessment of
included studies. The majority of studies were of moderate
(PEDro score 5–7; N = 5) or high (PEDro score ≥ 8;
N = 5) methodological quality. Six studies presented low
methodological quality (PEDro score 1–3). Statistical between-
group comparisons were reported in all trials, and all but one
study provided point and variability measures for key outcomes.
Other criteria that were fulfilled in the majority of studies
include random group allocation (N = 11), intention-to-treat
analysis (N = 10), specification of eligibility criteria (N = 10),
and allocation concealment (N = 8). Similarity of experimental
groups at baseline was ensured in only six trials. Similarly, only
six trials reported assessor blinding and follow-up data from
more than 85% of participants.
Sensitivity analyses (Table 3 and Supplementary Material)
revealed that the study design (randomized vs. non-randomized)
had little impact on the effect estimate (I2 = 0%; Q = 0.14;
p = 0.71). There was a significant difference between study
quality subgroups (I2 = 66.1; Q = 5.90; p = 0.05), with higher
effect estimates in studies with low internal validity (Pedro score
<5; IRR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.23–0.60), compared to moderate
(IRR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.44–0.82) and high (IRR = 0.74, 95%
CI 0.56–0.98) PEDro scores. This was further supported by
inspection of the funnel plot (Figure 2).
Meta-Analysis Results: Overall Effect of
NMT
A summary of the individual studies’ IRRs and the meta-analysis
is provided in Figure 3. Data was pooled from a total of 16
studies to establish the overall effect of NMT interventions,
representing 1,417,730 player exposures, and 1,724 LE injuries.

DISCUSSION
The main aim of this meta-analysis was to identify the optimal
training dose of NMT programs to reduce lower extremity injury
risk in youth athletes. Overall, and consistent with previous

reports, the included studies revealed a substantial preventive
effect of NMT (IRR 0.58, 95% CI 0.47–0.72), with a 42%
risk reduction for lower extremity injuries. Examination of
dosage parameters indicated that the highest risk reductions
were attained by NMT performed for two to three times per
week, and a weekly training volume of 30–60 min. Consequently,
injury prevention in youth athletes can be achieved with
relatively modest training volumes. Pooled effects of training
session durations indicated that short bouts of 10–15 min
sessions may be sufficient to achieve this volume for a strong
preventive impact. In terms of intervention period, preventive
effects were already observed with fewer than 30 sessions and
interestingly intervention periods of more than 6 months did
not lead to an additional injury risk reduction. The results from
the present meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution
and considered a first step in understanding dose-response
relationships, since comparisons are based on a relatively
small number of studies with heterogeneous methodological
quality.
Duration, Frequency, and Volume
The results of this meta-analysis revealed that training frequency
significantly affected the preventive effect of NMT. Programs
with frequencies of two or three times a week demonstrated
a substantially larger risk reduction compared to training once
a week. Similar findings were demonstrated in a recent meta-
analysis which investigated dose-response relationships of NMT
to reduced ACL injury risk in young and adult female athletes
(Sugimoto et al., 2014), which also suggested that the preventive
effect increases with increasing numbers of weekly training
sessions. Lesinski et al. (2015) reported that neuromuscular
adaptations to balance training, a key component of NMT injury
prevention programs, were high when conducted for two to
three times a week. Thus, these training frequencies seem to

be particularly effective for improving neuromuscular control,
which has been proposed as a modifiable injury risk factor
(Alentorn-Geli et al., 2009). From a practical point of view, this
finding emphasizes the importance of regular implementation of
NMT into an athlete’s training routine. Since NMT programs,
such as the “FIFA 11+” (Soligard et al., 2008), are typically
designed as warm-up programs, this is easily achievable even in
amateur level teams with less frequent training.
With respect to the optimal NMT session duration, our results
indicate that session lengths of 10–15 min are sufficient to achieve
a substantial risk reduction of 45%, with durations up to 30 min
not appearing to have any additional effect. This is an important
finding with respect to the practicability and feasibility of these
programs, since it demonstrates that large preventive effects can
be achieved with very short bouts of NMT. This makes exercise
based injury prevention easily applicable for athletes and coaches,
particularly in team sports settings where practice time is limited.
While it is not possible to infer about the optimal timing within
a practice session based on our meta-analysis, the integration
of NMT bouts into athletes’ warm-up routine was the most
commonly chosen strategy. The efficacy of such NMT warm-up
programs, such as the FIFA 11+, are well-established (Thorborg
et al., 2017). Training effects may also be age-dependent, with
Sugimoto et al. (2014) finding that session durations of more
than 20 min were more effective for ACL injury prevention in
both youth as well as adult female athletes. Thus, our results
might point at a potential window of opportunity in young ages,
where athletes might already benefit from short training bouts
of <20 min, whereas longer sessions may be needed in older
ages. This is further supported by a meta-analysis from Myer
et al. (2013) who found an age effect for the effectiveness of
NMT interventions, demonstrating a higher efficacy of NMT
programs in young age groups. With respect to the underlying
mechanisms, this finding could be explained by neuromuscular
performance improvements, which have been shown to respond
particularly well to short bouts of neuromuscular training
sessions of 11–15 min (Lesinski et al., 2015). It is conceivable that
the sensorimotor system in youth age has a greater potential for
reorganization, which would consequently lead to more efficient
and rapid adaptations during neuromuscular interventions. A

second reason for the discrepancy between our findings and
those of Sugimoto et al. (2014) may be related to the fact
that they exclusively reviewed studies on female athletes. Thus,
female athletes may respond better to training durations of more
than 20 min, while young males might already adapt to shorter
training stimuli. A previous meta-analysis by Rössler et al. (2014)
demonstrated gender differences in the efficacy of exercise-based
injury prevention programs, which would support this idea.
However, it remains speculative based on the currently available
data.
Our analysis revealed that a weekly volume of 30–60 min
produced the highest injury risk reduction (IRR = 0.45; 95%CI
0.25–0.81), which equals two to three weekly sessions of
10–20 min duration. This finding confirms the aforementioned
dosage effects for training frequency and duration, emphasizing
the efficacy of short but frequent NMT sessions. In consequence,
injury prevention is achievable with a modest volume of weekly
training, which is a strong argument for the practicability of
these intervention strategies. Coaches should aim at a regular
incorporation of short NMT bouts in multiple practice sessions
a week, which adds particular relevance to programs that can be
incorporated in regular warm-up routines. Another strategy to
ensure the required weekly volume is to have athletes perform
additional sessions at home, since NMT programs are typically
designed to require little space and equipment.
In summary, the results from this meta-analysis suggest that
neuromuscular injury prevention programs should be conducted
for at least two to three times a week, in short bouts of 10–15 min,
ensuring a weekly volume of 30–60 min. This allows athletes and
coaches to easily incorporate NMT contents into regular practice
routines or in additional home training programs. Although, it
is difficult to conclude on the optimal timing of NMT within
a practice session based on the existing data, the majority
of effective programs implement the training during athletes’
warm-up.
Intervention Volume and Period
The total volume and period of NMT interventions are additional
important factors to consider. We found the largest preventive
effects in studies with a low amount of sessions (IRR = 0.48;
95%CI 0.27–0.85). However, this category only contained
two studies, which both demonstrated poor methodological
quality (Hewett et al., 1999; McHugh et al., 2007). Thus, an
overestimation of this effect is likely. More importantly, there

 Steib et al.

FIGURE 7 | Subgroup analysis for the influence of the number of NMT sessions on IRRs.
was no difference in the preventive effects between studies with
moderate (30–60) and high (>60) total numbers of training
sessions. Our findings suggest that about 20–60 training sessions
may already induce a considerable injury risk reduction provided
a frequent incorporation into practice, which will then be
sustained with further regular practice. In addition, analysis of
the total intervention period revealed that studies with short-
term interventions of 1.5–6 months demonstrated similar effects
compared to studies with longer training periods of 7–12 months.
A possible explanation for these findings might be the specific
time course of training-induced neuromuscular adaptations:
Neuromuscular performance improvements, including increased
balance, muscular power, and strength, have recently been
demonstrated after NMT injury prevention programs in youth
athletes (Faude et al., 2017). These adaptations were consistently
demonstrated within only a few weeks of training (Steffen et al.,
2013; Zech et al., 2014; Rössler et al., 2016; Steib et al., 2016),
and the meta-analysis by Lesinski et al. (2015) reported a peak
after 11–12 weeks of training in healthy adults. Consequently,
rapid initial adaptations in neuromuscular abilities might lead to
the fast reductions of injury risk, potentially reaching a plateau
after the first months of training. However, it is noteworthy
that this comparison only considers the prescribed, but not the
actual number of sessions completed by the athletes. This would
obviously provide more valuable information (Stevenson et al.,
2015), but was not available in most cases.
In summary, the present evidence indicates that substantial
injury prevention can be expected with just a moderate amount
of 20–60 training session, within a period of <6 months. From
a practical point of view, this further emphasizes the value of
incorporating NMT contents into regular practice at any time
of the competitive season. Further, the data suggest that these
early adaptations will be sustained with continuing training,
which emphasize the value of a continuous incorporation of
neuromuscular contents into the athletes’ long-term training
process.
Limitations
We decided to include randomized and non-randomized as
well as cohort designs in order to obtain more data for
investigating dose-response relationships. A sensitivity analysis
revealed that the study design (randomized vs. non-randomized)
had no substantial effect on the studies’ effect sizes, which

is in accordance with the findings from a previous meta-
analysis (Rössler et al., 2014). However, the methodological
quality of included studies varied substantially, and one third
of the included studies scored poorly on the PEDro scale.
Inspection of the funnel plot as well as a sensitivity analysis
of trial quality revealed a tendency for smaller sampled
and low-quality studies to report greater risk reductions
than larger trials with moderate to high quality. This may
have affected some of our moderator analyses, particularly
when subgroups contained only few studies. In addition,
even where substantial differences for effect estimates existed
between subgroups, confidence intervals showed considerable
overlap. Thus, on the basis of the current existing data,
results can only serve as a first step in understanding dose-
response relationships and need to be treated with some
caution.
Study populations were diverse with respect to the type of
sport, the gender and competitive level of participants. Seven
studies investigated female and two trials male athletes only.
Participants’ competitive level ranged from amateur to high
school or elite levels. While Soomro et al. (2016) did not find
differential effects of injury prevention programs on male and
female youth athletes, Rössler et al. (2014) reported that girls
benefit more substantially from exercise-based injury prevention
programs compared to boys. Further, they demonstrated that
studies including sub-elite level athletes tended to show greater
risk reductions compared to studies on elite athletes (Rössler
et al., 2014). Consequently, the heterogeneity of effects we
observed in the meta-analysis is likely not only attributable
to difference in the NMT programs’ content and dosage, but
may at least partly be explained by specific differences in study
populations.
In addition, our meta-analytical approach cannot consider
the influence of specific program contents and the interactions
between individual training modalities (e.g., duration, frequency,
intervention period). Hence, subgroup analyses for selected
dosage parameters neglect differences between studies in other
training modalities. This may also explain why there was
still considerable heterogeneity in some of the subgroups
investigated. Where possible, we made efforts to account for this
aspect by combining several parameters (i.e., weekly volume). In
addition, training intensity, which is difficult to specify in multi-
component NMT programs, was not addressed due to the lack of
reported data. Further, athletes’ compliance data was not available
for many studies, and thus, is not considered in the analyses. This
however is an important aspect influencing the efficacy of injury
prevention programs (Soligard et al., 2010; Hagglund et al., 2013).
Lastly, a differentiation between the effects of NMT programs on
different types of injuries (e.g., overuse vs. traumatic; ankle vs.
knee injuries) would add additional value to the dose-response

analysis. This, however, was not possible in the present study due
to the little data available at present.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this meta-analysis revealed that NMT performed
in short bouts of 10–15 min, two to three times per week,
with a weekly training volume of 30–60 min had the largest
preventive effect for lower extremity injuries. These effects
were already observed within 20–60 sessions and training
periods of <6 months, and seem to be sustainable with
continued regular practice. Consequently, our results emphasize
the value of short NMT bouts, such as structured warm-up
protocols or home-training programs, which foster the regular
incorporation of NMT in athletes practice routines. The fact
that even modest weekly training volumes achieve desirable
effects should encourage coaches to implement NMT contents
into their practice regimes. The conclusions from this meta-
analysis mainly represent results from studies including youth
athletes between the ages of 12 and 21 years, and inferences
for injury prevention in children are not possible at present.
Further, the data underlying the dose-response analyses are
derived from a limited number of studies with partly low
methodological quality, which reduces the strength of the
present recommendations. Further studies are needed to better
understand the optimal program contents and training dosage,
and the underlying mechanisms. Studies directly comparing the
effects of individual dosage components are lacking. More work
in this field is important in order to better educate athletes and
coaches with respect to designing effective injury prevention
programs.
