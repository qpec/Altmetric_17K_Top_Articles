Abstract
Background—Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanics. The burden of cancer 
mortality within Hispanic groups has not been well quantified.
Methods—Cancer mortality rates for 2008–2012 in Florida were computed based on race, 
ethnicity, and birthplace, specifically focusing on major Hispanic groups – Mexicans, Puerto 
Ricans, Cubans, Central Americans, South Americans, and Dominicans. Age-adjusted mortality 
rate ratios derived from negative binomial regression were used to compare Hispanics, aggregated 
and by group, to non-Hispanic whites (NHWs).
Results—205,369 cancer deaths from 2008–2012 were analyzed, of which 22,042 occurred in 
Hispanics. Overall cancer mortality rates were lower for Hispanics, 159 and 100 per 100,000 in 
males and females, respectively, compared to 204 and 145 per 100,000 in NHWs, largely driven 
by relatively low rates of lung and breast cancers among Hispanics. However, Hispanics had a 
higher risk of death from stomach and liver cancers, both infection-related. Of all Hispanic groups, 
Mexicans had the lowest mortality, while Cubans had the highest, with significantly higher 
mortality for colorectal, endometrial and prostate cancers.
Conclusions—Compared to other Hispanic groups, Cubans and Puerto Ricans had significantly 
higher rates. For these longer-established populations in the US, increases in diet and obesity-

 related cancers are evident. Some groups show excesses that clearly fall out of the common 
Hispanic patterns, with implications for public health: Cubans for colorectal cancer, Puerto Ricans 
for liver cancer and Dominicans for prostate cancer.
Impact—Cancer mortality outcomes in Hispanics vary between ethnic groups. Research and 
public health strategies should consider this heterogeneity.

Introduction
Hispanics are the largest minority population in the United States (US), numbering 55 
million in 2014 (1). Cancer is the leading cause of death for Hispanic men and women (2), 
although the cancer mortality burden born by Hispanics is less than that of non-Hispanic 
whites (NHWs) and non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) (3). Hispanics, comprising 17% of the US 
population in 2014 and projected to increase to 29% by 2060 (4), are heterogeneous, with 
varying nativity, immigration experiences, language dominance, and socioeconomic 
circumstances (5), reflected in considerable diversity among Hispanic groups in cancer 
incidence (6,7) and mortality rates (2,8). Aggregating these distinct groups in cancer 
research limits the ability to detect and address determinants of disparities that arise from 
differences in the prevalence of risk and prognostic factors. Irrespective of whether these 
differences are attributable to biological, cultural, or socioeconomic factors, it is critical to 
assess and accurately characterize intra-ethnic Hispanic cancer outcomes in order to 
maximize effectiveness in meeting the needs of this fast-growing minority population.
Mortality is the most useful indicator of progress against cancer because it is dependent 
upon both incidence and survival. Unbiased cancer incidence and survival studies of distinct 
Hispanic groups have been impeded by the incompleteness in cancer surveillance systems of 
birthplace and specific Hispanic ethnicity information (6). However; these are nearly 
complete on death certificates, presenting an invaluable opportunity to accurately assess 
cancer outcomes among different groups of Hispanics in the US.
We used cancer mortality data from Florida, home to 9% of the total US Hispanic population 
(1), for two main reasons. First, Florida, which is 25% Hispanic (9), is the only US state 
with numerically meaningful representation from all major Hispanic ethnic groups: Cubans 
(30%), Puerto Ricans (21%), South Americans (17%), Mexicans (16%), Central Americans 
(11%), Dominicans (4%), and Spaniards (1%) (9). Secondly, unlike in other states with large 
Hispanic populations, the Hispanic cancer experience in Florida is overwhelmingly foreign-
born (6), providing a unique circumstance favorable to avoiding confounding by birthplace 
(US or foreign-born), a known strong determinant of cancer mortality (10). In this study, we 
compared cancer mortality across these six major Hispanic groups, the aggregate Hispanic 
population, NHWs and NHBs.

 Materials and Methods
Cancer mortality data for 2008–2012 for Florida residents only were obtained from the 
Florida Department of Health, Bureau of Vital Statistics (11). In addition to all-sites-
combined, inclusive of all cancers, the six most common causes of cancer death – lung and 
bronchus, breast, prostate, colorectal, pancreas, and unknown primary - were analyzed, as 
well as cancers of special interest and/or rising incidence in Hispanic populations: cervical, 
liver, stomach, and endometrial. Cancer sites were coded according to the International 
Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10). Cancers of unknown primary included 
causes of death C79 and C80.
Race and ethnicity, including text fields, and birthplace of decedents were examined to 
obtain accurate Hispanic group information for each decedent, thereby minimizing 
misclassification. For example, persons born in Brazil, Italy, Portugal and individuals of 
Asian race born in the Philippines, even if labelled Hispanic, were categorized as non-
Hispanic. Decedents from Spanish speaking countries in Central America (CA) and South 
America (SA) were categorized into these two groups; a few decedents classified as 
Hispanic but born in Guyana, French Guyana, Suriname and Belize were included in the SA 
or CA groups accordingly. Those born in Spain or with a descriptive in the ethnicity field as 
“Spaniard” or “Spanish European” were categorized as Spaniard, and included in the overall 
Hispanic category, although not reported as a standalone group. Decedents identified as two 
or more Hispanic groups (0.1%) in the text fields were placed into the specific group 
described first: e.g., Mexican-Cuban was classified as Mexican; Cuban-Mexican as Cuban. 
Ninety Hispanic decedents (0.4%) had vague descriptive ethnicity text indicating CA or SA 
origins, and 186 US-born Hispanics were of unknown Hispanic group; these were 
proportionally reassigned by imputation models stratified by age, sex, and cancer site for 
mortality rate calculations, using methodology described elsewhere (6).
Population denominators for the state of Florida were obtained from the 2010 Census (9), 
coinciding with the mid-year of this study period. Hispanics who were Not Otherwise 
Specified (NOS) from the census data were bridged to each of the specific populations 
proportionately by age group and sex (Table 1). Cancer mortality rates for 2008–2012 for 
Hispanics in aggregate, six Hispanic groups, NHBs, and NHWs were calculated per 100,000 
persons, by sex, annualized and age-standardized to the 2000 US Standard Population using 
eighteen age group bands, all 5-year except the last, which was 85 and older. Corresponding 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality rates were calculated with gamma intervals 
modification.
To directly compare rates of Hispanics, in aggregate and by group, to the referent NHW 
group, we computed age-adjusted site-specific mortality rate ratios using negative binomial 
regression. Models included decedents ages 40 and over.
SAS 9.3 was used for data analysis. This study was approved by the University of Nevada, 
Las Vegas Institutional Review Board.

 Results
In 2008–2012, cancer was the cause of death for 205,369 Florida residents, of which 22,042 
(11%) were Hispanic. Ninety-two percent of Hispanic decedents were either foreign-born or 
born on the island of Puerto Rico (Table 1).
Lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer were the leading causes of cancer mortality among 
Hispanic males, with the exception of Dominicans and Mexicans for whom liver was third, 
and Dominicans for whom prostate was first. Among women, lung and breast cancers were 
either the first or second leading cause of death in all Hispanic groups, with colorectal 
cancer always third (Table 2).
Compared to NHWs in Florida, Hispanics had lower all-sites-combined cancer mortality 
rates. In aggregate, Hispanics had significantly higher mortality rates for stomach and 
prostate cancers than NHWs, but significantly lower rates for lung, pancreas and breast 
cancers (Table 2). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in rates by Hispanic 
ethnicity. Mexicans had the lowest cancer mortality rates per 100,000 of all analyzed groups 
for all-sites-combined, 117 and 82 among males and females, respectively, compared to 236 
and 148 among NHBs, who had the highest rates. Among Hispanics, the highest rates per 
100,000 were in Cuban males and females, 174 and 104, respectively, followed closely by 
Puerto Ricans, 158 and 103 for males and females (Table 2).
Compared to NHWs, the overall risk of cancer death in Hispanics was approximately 30% 
lower for both sexes (p<0.05). Of all cancers analyzed, lung and breast cancers had the 
greatest mortality risk differentials by race/ethnicity. Compared to NHWs, Hispanic females 
had a marked 67% lower risk of lung cancer death, while Hispanic males had a 42% lower 
risk (Table 3). For breast cancer, Hispanic women had a 25% lower mortality compared to 
NHWs. On the other hand, Hispanics females in Florida had an 86% higher mortality risk 
than NHWs, while Hispanic men had 85% and 12% higher risk for stomach and prostate 
cancer mortality, respectively.
Discussion
This is the first comprehensive analysis of cancer mortality in all major Hispanic ethnic 
groups in the US. Our results reveal both overarching Hispanic patterns and significant 
differences between Hispanic groups: for most cancers, Cubans have the highest mortality 
rates, followed closely by Puerto Ricans. The other analyzed groups, Central Americans, 
Dominicans, South Americans, and especially Mexicans, have overall lower cancer 
mortality.
Aggregated, Hispanics have lower all-sites-combined mortality compared to NHWs and 
NHBs in Florida, driven largely by their lower rates of two major causes of cancer death: 
lung and breast cancer. Past smoking trends for all Hispanics (12) and higher fertility in 
Hispanic women (13) likely account for the diminished risk for these cancers. Lower 
smoking prevalence among Hispanics may also partially explain relatively low rates in other 
tobacco-related cancers (2) such as pancreas and bladder (data not shown) compared to

 NHW. However, Hispanics have higher mortality than NHWs for some cancers, including 
stomach, prostate, and liver for females.
Cubans and Puerto Ricans
Among all Hispanic populations, Cubans have the highest overall cancer mortality rates for 
both sexes. Their site-specific mortality pattern is most similar to NHWs: relatively lower 
liver and stomach cancer risk than other Hispanic groups, but the highest lung cancer 
mortality rates among Hispanics. Compared to other Hispanic groups, Cubans are 
historically the heaviest daily smokers (14) and have higher smoking prevalence (15), likely 
explaining their high lung and overall cancer mortality. Mortality rates among Cubans 
significantly exceed those of NHWs for colorectal, endometrial and prostate cancers.
Puerto Ricans also have high rates of colorectal and endometrial cancers. Both of these 
cancers are strongly linked to obesity and diabetes (16) and are often considered “western” 
cancers, with risk commonly increasing among first generation immigrants (6). National 
surveys show that Mexicans have the highest rates of these risk factors, not Cubans or Puerto 
Ricans (17). Nonetheless, Cubans and Puerto Ricans have longer average time spent in the 
US, (continental US for Puerto Ricans), than other Hispanic immigrants (Table 1); hence 
there is a possibility of more persistent acculturation and sustained prevalence of risk factors 
among these Hispanic groups. Heavy smoking and drinking, more common in Puerto Ricans 
and Cubans (17, 18), are also risk factors for colorectal cancer (16). Cubans have the lowest 
colorectal cancer screening rates among all Hispanics (2) and the highest mortality rates, so 
potential reductions in colorectal cancer mortality could be achieved by increased colorectal 
cancer screening. Consistent with a more “Western” pattern of cancer occurrence, Cubans 
and Puerto Ricans had the highest mortality rates of all Hispanic groups for breast cancer, 
typical of populations with lower parity (2), as well as high prostate cancer mortality. 
Prostate cancer risk increases have been observed in populations transitioning to a high-
calorie, fatty diet (19, 20).
Puerto Ricans are second to Cubans in overall cancer mortality rates. Yet their specific 
patterns are distinct from Cuban outcomes, with high mortality for the infection-related 
cancers, (i.e., stomach, liver and cervix). Puerto Rican men in Florida have the highest liver 
cancer mortality of any Hispanic group, 63% higher than NHWs. Additionally, Puerto Rican 
women not only have the highest cervical cancer mortality rate among Hispanic women, 
they also are the only group for whom mortality significantly exceeds that of NHW women, 
despite evidence of high uptake of cervical cancer screening (2), and higher rates of 
insurance coverage due to US citizenship status (5). Our findings are consistent with a 
previous study that showed higher infection-related mortality for island Puerto Ricans than 
NHWs (21).
Mexicans, Central Americans, South Americans, Dominicans
The remaining four Hispanic groups have lower overall cancer mortality rates as well as 
lower rates for the two most common causes of cancer deaths, lung and breast, likely 
partially explained by lower rates of smoking (14) and higher parity (5) than their Cuban and 
Puerto Rican counterparts. Our findings are similar for colorectal cancer: lower rates

 compared to Cubans and Puerto Ricans. These lower breast and colorectal cancer mortality 
rates in the more recent immigrant populations, despite less health insurance coverage (5) 
and lower use of screening tests (2), likely indicates lower disease incidence, as confirmed in 
other studies (6). Lower risk for CA, SA, and Dominican populations may be a result of 
lower prevalence of many cancer risk factors concomitant with shorter periods of time living 
in the US.
Of all Hispanic groups in Florida, Mexicans of both sexes consistently have the lowest 
cancer mortality rates, except for stomach and liver. Stomach cancer mortality rates, higher 
than NHWs for all Hispanics, are especially high among both CAs and SAs. This mirrors the 
high burden of stomach cancer, associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, in Central and 
South America (22). Given that the over 99% of CA and SA populations are foreign-born 
(Table 1), it is natural that the country of origin risk persists after emigration to Florida. 
Liver cancer mortality is high among Mexican men and particularly high for CA women, 
although reasons for this are unclear.
Prostate cancer mortality among Dominicans is nearly double that of NHWs. Notably, of all 
Hispanic groups, Dominicans had the highest proportion of black race in our dataset. Men of 
African ancestry are known to have high prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates (16, 
23), particularly for aggressive forms that present in late stages (24). Dominicans, with the 
highest prostate cancer mortality among Hispanic groups in Florida, also have the lowest 
documented rates of prostate cancer screening (25). As such, the debate surrounding targeted 
PSA screening recommendations for blacks (26), in light of differences in incidence and 
mortality, could possibly be expanded to include Dominican populations.
Liver cancer is a paramount problem for the overall US population due to rapidly increasing 
incidence and mortality rates, in contrast to most other cancers (3, 16). Complicating 
prevention and treatment efforts is the fact that there are multiple causes of liver cancer, 
including viral infection, obesity/diabetes, and alcoholism, and prevalence of these causes is 
not evenly distributed among NHWs, NHBs, and Hispanic groups (27). Hispanic group 
differences in infection with the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
likely play an important role in the patterns observed in liver cancer mortality in our study. 
Among the foreign-born, HBV infection is more prevalent, while HCV is less prevalent (2). 
However, for US-born populations, including Puerto Ricans irrespective of birthplace, 
chronic HCV infection likely plays a larger role (28). Studies show substantially higher 
HCV prevalence in Puerto Ricans than other Hispanics (28,29), and our study revealed that 
Puerto Ricans had a 62% higher risk of liver cancer death than NHWs in both sexes, higher 
than all other Hispanic groups for males. In light of this, Puerto Ricans might be considered 
a priority population for targeted HCV testing, since effective HCV antiviral treatment that 
reduces liver cancer risk is now available (3).
Strengths and Limitations
Florida is the only US state with significant representation from each of the major Hispanic 
groups. Thus, this study is able to circumvent biases from ethno-regional differences arising 
from disparate baseline risks. While a few studies reported cancer mortality rates for 
Mexicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans (2, 8), none have included Dominicans, CAs and SAs.

 Accurate direct comparison between all major Hispanic groups as well as NHWs and NHBs 
was possible for the first time. Moreover, our study benefits from very high completeness 
(>99%) of birthplace information for all Florida deaths, which, combined with ethnicity and 
text descriptives, allowed for unprecedented reliable classification of Hispanic groups, not 
possible with cancer incidence data.
Our study has the usual limitations of descriptive epidemiology. Risk factor data specific to 
Hispanic groups in Florida are lacking. Hispanic populations in Florida may not be entirely 
representative of the same Hispanic groups in the US. Theoretically, our mortality numbers 
could be affected by out-migration of Mexicans, Dominicans, CAs, and SAs who return to 
their home countries of origin to die. However, the magnitude of this phenomenon, known as 
the Salmon Bias, was found to be small for Hispanics (30). Central American and South 
American rates are themselves aggregates of diverse populations, although in Florida 
predominantly Nicaraguan and Colombian, respectively (5). Lastly, individual-level data for 
length of stay in the US among cancer decedents was not available.
Mortality is a function of cancer incidence and survival. While our results are consistent 
with previous reports on cancer incidence rates for Hispanic groups (6, 7), it is possible that 
limited health care access and/or low healthcare quality for Hispanics result in poor cancer 
survival, thus impacting the mortality burden. However, analyzing any differential survival 
by Hispanic group is currently problematic. The accuracy of survival data among the 
foreign-born in the US, especially for Hispanics, is prone to biases arising from passive 
follow-up methods in registries (31, 32) and missing information on specific Hispanic group 
(33). The SEER cancer surveillance program greatly reduces the problem of passive follow-
up by systematically collecting dates of last alive contact for all cancer cases, but its 
coverage does not include a meaningful representation of Caribbean and SA populations, 
together comprising 23% of the Hispanic population (9). Nonetheless, prior studies using 
SEER registries, albeit overwhelmingly represented by Mexican Hispanics, have not shown 
large differences in survival between Hispanics and NHWs (34). Thus, differences in 
incidence, rather than survival, likely drive most of the mortality differences seen in our 
study. Even so, future accurate survival studies in Florida could explain some of our 
unexpected findings, such as the high ovarian and prostate cancer mortality rates among 
CAs, given that they are more recent immigrant arrivals (35) from countries at low-risk for 
these cancers (19).
In conclusion, considerable heterogeneity in cancer mortality is observed between Hispanic 
groups. Two distinct group patterns emerge among Hispanics: low cancer mortality for 
Mexicans, CAs, SAs and Dominicans, and intermediate mortality for Cubans and Puerto 
Ricans, higher than the aggregate Hispanic population although still mostly lower than 
NHWs. The significantly higher mortality rates for colorectal, endometrial and prostate 
cancers among the longer-established Cuban immigrant population in comparison to NHWs 
suggest that “Western” risk factors such as obesity may be an important focus for 
intervention, especially in the context of acculturation. Our study also shows that for certain 
populations, public health interventions may be warranted, including those that increase 
colorectal screening among Cubans, HCV testing and treatment for Puerto Ricans, and 
awareness of the likely elevated prostate cancer risk for Dominicans.

 Hispanics, the largest racial/ethnic minority group in the US, have diverse cultural, 
socioeconomic, racial, and geographic backgrounds. Aggregated, this population of 55 
million is relatively “low risk” for most cancers, although certain groups, especially Puerto 
Ricans and Cubans, bear a disproportionate mortality burden. It is important to monitor 
these trends, identifying protective factors that can be preserved or even replicated in other 
populations, as well as opportunities to resist the acquisition of major risk factors for cancer. 
Future studies should attempt to elucidate selective acculturation mechanisms among 
Hispanic immigrants that would potentially counteract unfavorable trends towards 
worsening cancer outcomes.
