Abstract
Objective To investigate whether the English health inequalities strategy
was associated with a decline in geographical health inequalities,
compared with trends before and after the strategy.
Design Time trend analysis.
Setting Two groups of lower tier local authorities in England. The most
deprived, bottom fifth and the rest of England.
Intervention The English health inequalities strategy—a cross
government strategy implemented between 1997 and 2010 to reduce
health inequalities in England. Trends in geographical health inequalities
were assessed before (1983-2003), during (2004-12), and after (2013-15)
the strategy using segmented linear regression.
Main outcome measure Geographical health inequalities measured as
the relative and absolute differences in male and female life expectancy
at birth between the most deprived local authorities in England and the
rest of the country.
Results Before the strategy the gap in male and female life expectancy
between the most deprived local authorities in England and the rest of
the country increased at a rate of 0.57 months each year (95%
confidence interval 0.40 to 0.74 months) and 0.30 months each year
(0.12 to 0.48 months). During the strategy period this trend reversed
and the gap in life expectancy for men reduced by 0.91 months each
year (0.54 to 1.27 months) and for women by 0.50 months each year
(0.15 to 0.86 months). Since the end of the strategy period the inequality
gap has increased again at a rate of 0.68 months each year (−0.20 to
1.56 months) for men and 0.31 months each year (−0.26 to 0.88) for
women. By 2012 the gap in male life expectancy was 1.2 years smaller
(95% confidence interval 0.8 to 1.5 years smaller) and the gap in female
life expectancy was 0.6 years smaller (0.3 to 1.0 years smaller) than it
would have been if the trends in inequalities before the strategy had
continued.
Conclusion The English health inequalities strategy was associated
with a decline in geographical inequalities in life expectancy, reversing
a previously increasing trend. Since the strategy ended, inequalities
have started to increase again. The strategy may have reduced
geographical health inequalities in life expectancy, and future approaches
should learn from this experience. The concerns are that current policies
are reversing the achievements of the strategy.
Introduction
Between 1997 and 2010 the UK government implemented a
comprehensive programme to reduce health inequalities in
England,1 one of the most ambitious strategies of its kind.2 The
strategy specifically focused on reducing geographical
inequalities in life expectancy; with a target set to reduce by at
least 10% the gap in life expectancy between the fifth of local
authorities with the worst health and deprivation indicators (the
Spearhead areas) and the population as a whole.3
The strategy focused on four themes4 5: supporting families;
engaging communities in tackling deprivation; improving
prevention, treatment, and care; and tackling the underlying
social determinants of health. Several government departments
made 82 commitments across these four themes (see
supplementary appendix 1).6 During the initial stages of the
strategy, up to 2006, there was a broad focus across these four
themes. By 2007 most of the departmental commitments had
been met, at an estimated cost of more than £20bn ($26bn;
€23bn) (see supplementary appendix 1).2 7 Many actions were
targeted at areas with high levels of socioeconomic deprivation,
including several area based regeneration and health initiatives,
and Sure Start children’s centres that provided early years child
care and education.5 A new policy was introduced to allocate
an increasing proportion of UK National Health Service
resources to more deprived areas.8 Other actions targeted
disadvantaged individuals and families, such as the introduction
of the national minimum wage, tax and benefit changes to reduce
child poverty, and interventions to improve education, housing,
and employment.5 Actions that were focused on the health
service included interventions to improve chronic disease
management and access to primary care and smoking cessation

 services.2 Overall, this period in England was characterised by
a large increase in public spending on social programmes and
a focus across governments on widening opportunities for more
disadvantaged areas, individuals, and families.5 9 From 2006
greater emphasis was placed on the Spearhead areas. This
included the setting of local targets for inequalities, aligned to
national targets that local public sector organisations were
obliged to report against,3 10 and the establishment of a Health
Inequalities National Support Team that provided technical
advice for Spearhead areas to implement evidenced based
approaches to reduce health inequalities3 10 (see supplementary
appendix 1 for a timeline for the main elements of the strategy).
The strategy came to an end with the change in government in
2010. While inequalities in some determinants of health had
improved, including unemployment, child and pensioner
poverty, housing quality, and educational attainment,2-13 others
remained stable or widened, including income inequality,
smoking, and obesity.2-15 The Department of Health’s own
assessment in 2010, using data up to 2008 (the latest available
at the time) estimated that the gap in life expectancy between
the Spearhead areas and the country as whole had widened, and
several commentators therefore concluded that the strategy had
not been successful.2-17 The effects of the strategy, however,
may not have been fully realised by this time and this assessment
did not consider any change from the pre-existing trend in health
inequalities before the implementation of the strategy. Also,
after the 2011 census, life expectancy estimates were revised
based on new population estimates, and definitive data for the
full strategy period only became available in 2013.18 More
recently several studies have reported that inequalities in
mortality did actually narrow between areas during the strategy
period, based on their level of socioeconomic deprivation,19-21
and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that
inequalities in male life expectancy between occupational
socioeconomic groups also narrowed during this time.22 A recent
study, however, found no evidence that the strategy had had an
impact on educational inequalities in self assessed health,
smoking, and obesity.23
It therefore remains unclear whether the English health
inequalities strategy did or did not have an impact on
geographical health inequalities. We investigated whether the
period of the health inequalities strategy was associated with a
reduction in the difference in life expectancy between the most
disadvantaged local authorities and the country as a whole
compared with trends before and after the strategy.
Methods
Setting and data sources
We used data from the UK Data Archive24 and the ONS on the
annual number of deaths and population estimates for five year
age groups for men and women in local authority areas across
England between 1983 and 2015. Although the earliest data
available were from 1979, we used data from 1983 because
there are known issues with the quality of mortality data in 1981
and 1982 due to the registrars strike in those years.25 All data
were mapped to 324 local authorities based on 2009 boundaries,
excluding the City of London and Isles of Scilly because of
their small population sizes. We used the income domain of the
2004 indices of multiple deprivation to identify the most
deprived local authorities that included approximately 20% of
the population of England (population weighted quintile). The
income domain of the indices of multiple deprivation 2004 is
a non-overlapping count of the numbers of people in each local
authority on a low income and in receipt of means tested benefits
or tax credits, or both.26 Supplementary appendix 11 gives the
summary data and the geographical location of these most
deprived local authorities.
Analyses
Initially we calculated life expectancy27 at birth for men and
women in the most deprived group of local authorities and the
rest of England from 1983 to 2015 and the relative and absolute
differences between these groups to investigate trends in
inequalities before, during, and after the strategy was
implemented. We then tested whether there was a statistically
significant change in inequalities between the deprived group
of local authorities and the rest of the country during the strategy
period, compared with the period before and after. We calculated
male and female life expectancy for each local authority area
from 1983 to 2015. We then used this panel of data to estimate
segmented regression models for male and female life
expectancy, including linear spline terms for time with two
breakpoints at the beginning and the end of the strategy period,
and an interaction term between these time trend terms and a
dummy variable indicating the most deprived group of local
authorities (see supplementary appendix 2 for full model
formula). All models included controls for local trends in
unemployment, using annual data on the percentage of 16-64
year olds claiming unemployment benefits.28 This segmented
regression model provided an estimation of the trend in the
absolute difference in life expectancy between the most deprived
local authorities and the rest of England during each period and
whether there was a statistically significant change in this trend
between periods. All models were weighted for the local
authority population and included local authority fixed effects
and clustered standard errors to adjust for the clustering of
variance within local authorities (see supplementary appendix
2).
As the strategy developed incrementally (see supplementary
appendix 1), and it is likely that there was a lag between
implementation and any impacts on life expectancy, it was not
possible to determine a priori at which time points we might
expect the trend in inequalities to change. We therefore
investigated empirically whether there was a statistically
significant change in the trend in health inequalities around the
beginning of the strategy period (1997 to 2006) and around the
end of the strategy period (2008 to 2015). We used an iterative
search procedure to identify which combination of breakpoints
at the beginning and end of the strategy provided the best fit for
the data by comparing all models with these alternative
breakpoints29 (see supplementary appendix 4). In all further
analyses we then used the model with breakpoints that best
fitted the data.
Although the national target for the strategy was based on the
gap in life expectancy between Spearhead areas and the rest of
the country, we investigated the gap in life expectancy between
the most income deprived local authorities and the rest of the
country. The Spearhead areas were mainly selected because
they had the worst health indicators in the country in 1995-97
rather than necessarily the worst levels of socioeconomic
deprivation (see supplementary appendix 5). Health inequalities,
however, are usually categorised as differences in health between
groups defined by their socioeconomic status (eg, income) rather
than their baseline health status.30-32 We also found that there
was a high chance that the “Spearhead gap” would not narrow
even if socioeconomic inequalities in health did narrow, and
that there was also a high risk of biased conclusions from using
this comparison owing to regression to the mean (see
supplementary appendix 5). Most of the actions in the strategy

 were actually targeted generally at socioeconomically
disadvantaged areas and groups rather than specifically at the
Spearhead group, and therefore differences in life expectancy
between the most income deprived local authorities and the rest
of the country provide a measure of geographical health
inequalities that was likely to be sensitive to the impact of the
strategy. As a sensitivity analysis, we replicated the models
using Spearhead and non-Spearhead areas rather than deprived
areas and the rest of the country, and also investigated whether
there was any additional increase in life expectancy in Spearhead
areas compared with non-Spearhead areas after 2005, while
adjusting for differential trends in deprived and non-deprived
areas (see supplementary appendix 6).
Robustness tests
To assess the robustness of our findings we subjected our
analysis to several tests. We estimated models using the log of
life expectancy in each local authority, including random rather
than fixed effects, additionally including a random slope term,
removing outliers, removing controls for the local
unemployment rate, and using Driscoll and Kraay standard
errors that are robust to serial autocorrelation.33 34 We estimated
models including a continuous term for deprivation rather than
two groups of local authorities (see supplementary appendix 4).
We investigated any non-linear relation between deprivation
and change in life expectancy before, during, and after the
strategy (see supplementary appendix 14). We estimated models
adjusting for local internal and international migration rates (see
supplementary appendix 4). To investigate differences in effect
by age group we estimated models using age specific mortality
rates (see supplementary appendix 12). To identify whether
trends in the gap in life expectancy between groups of local
authorities reflected changes in inequalities across
neighbourhoods within these groups of local authorities, we
provided additional analyses (see supplementary appendix 8)
investigating the change in inequalities between small
neighbourhoods within the most deprived group of local
authorities and within the rest of the country.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research question or
the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing
plans for design or implementation of the study. No patients
were asked to advise on interpretation or writing up of results.
There are no plans to disseminate the results of the research to
study participants or the relevant patient community.
Results
Figure 1⇓ shows the trend in life expectancy in the most
deprived local authorities and the rest of England between 1983
and 2015, and the relative and absolute differences in life
expectancy between these two groups of local authorities. Life
expectancy generally increased over this period for all groups;
however, between 2012 and 2015 life expectancy declined
slightly, particularly in the most deprived local authorities (fig
1⇓). The gap in male and female life expectancy between the
most deprived local authorities and the rest of England increased
in the period before the introduction of the English health
inequalities strategy, up to around 2000 to 2003, and then
declined during the strategy period and increased again between
2012 and 2015.
Comparing segmented regression models with different
breakpoints indicated that breakpoints at 2003 and 2012
provided the best fit for the data (see supplementary appendix
7). Table 1⇓ shows the trend in health inequalities estimated
from the segmented regression models during the three periods
defined by these breakpoints—before (1983-2003), during
(2004-12), and after (2013-15) the health inequalities strategy.
Before the strategy, the gap in male and female life expectancy
between the most deprived local authorities in England and the
rest of the country increased at a rate of 0.57 months each year
(95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.74 months) and 0.30 months
each year (0.12 to 0.48 months), respectively. During the
strategy period this trend reversed and the gap in life expectancy
reduced by 0.91 months each year (0.54 to 1.27 months) for
men and by 0.50 months each year (0.15 to 0.86 months) for
women. Since the end of the strategy period the inequality gap
has increased again at rate of 0.68 months each year (−0.20 to
1.56 months) for men and 0.31 months each year (−0.26 to 0.88
months) for women. For both male and female life expectancy,
there was a statistically significant change in the trend in
inequalities before and after the strategy (P<0.001). By 2012
the gap in male life expectancy was 1.2 years (34%) smaller
(95% confidence interval 0.8 to 1.5 years smaller) and the gap
in female life expectancy was 0.6 years (28%) smaller (0.3 to
1.0 years smaller) than it would have been if the trends in
inequalities before the implementation of strategy had continued.
Additional analysis indicated that the reduction in inequalities
during the strategy period was largely due to decreased
inequalities in mortality in those aged less than 65 years (see
supplementary appendix 12). The reductions in inequalities
during the strategy period were also particularly due to greater
improvements in the most deprived areas, rather than
proportional improvements across all levels of deprivation (see
supplementary appendix 14). We also found that there was a
greater decline in inequalities between small neighbourhoods
within the deprived group of local authorities during the strategy
period than within the rest of the country (see supplementary
appendix 8), suggesting that the decline in inequalities observed
at the local authority level was achieved in part through reducing
inequalities within the deprived local authorities.
Our results were similar when using alternative model
specifications and when removing potential outliers (see
supplementary appendix 4). We found that there was a
statistically significant upturn in the trend in life expectancy in
both deprived areas and the rest of the country in 2003; however,
this change in trend was greater in the more deprived areas,
hence inequalities narrowed. Similarly, the downturn in life
expectancy from 2012 affected both deprived areas and the rest
of the country, but this change in trend was greatest in more
deprived areas, widening inequalities (see supplementary
appendices 3 and 6). We found that the narrowing of the gap in
life expectancy between Spearhead areas and the rest of the
country did not occur until after 2005 and was less pronounced
for women than men. The national target to reduce the gap
between Spearhead areas and England as a whole by at least
10% was achieved for male life expectancy but not for female
life expectancy. We found that male and female life expectancy
increased after 2005 in Spearhead areas compared with
non-Spearhead areas by an additional 2.8 months (95%
confidence interval 0.02 to 5.5 months) and 3.14 months (0.97
to 5.31 months), respectively, after adjusting for the differential
trends in deprived and non-deprived areas. In other words, there
appeared to be an additional Spearhead effect narrowing
inequalities after 2005 (see supplementary appendix 6).

 Discussion
We found that absolute and relative inequalities in life
expectancy between the most deprived English local authorities
and the rest of the country, increased before the English health
inequalities strategy, declined during the strategy period, and
have increased since the strategy came to an end. This study
provides the first evidence indicating that the English health
inequalities strategy may have reduced geographical health
inequalities in life expectancy and raises concerns that current
policies are reversing these gains.
Comparison with previous research
Our conclusions differ from previous, less favourable
assessments of the impact of the strategy.2-23 Most of these
assessments were based on the Department of Health’s own
estimate that the gap in life expectancy between Spearhead areas
and the country as a whole had not narrowed.17 There are several
reasons for this difference in conclusions. Firstly, while the gap
in life expectancy between income deprived areas and the rest
of the country narrowed from 2003, this was not reflected in a
narrowing of the Spearhead gap until 2006. This is probably
because most of the actions of the strategy before 2006 were
targeted generally at socioeconomically deprived areas and
groups and not specifically at Spearhead areas. We do, however,
observe a narrowing of the Spearhead gap from 2006. Secondly,
in contrast with the Department of Health’s assessment we
compared trends in inequalities during the strategy period with
pre-existing trends, using life expectancy estimates revised after
the 2011 census. Both of these factors led to a clearer indication
that the strategy was associated with a narrowing of inequalities
(see supplementary appendix 10). Other more recent analysis
is consistent with our findings, also reporting a narrowing of
inequalities in life expectancy during the period of the health
inequalities strategy.22 35 A recent study, however, found no
evidence that the strategy had had an impact in inequalities in
self reported health, smoking, and obesity between educational
groups.23 Other studies have also reported widening inequalities
in self reported health during the strategy period that were
largely driven by increasing inequalities in mental health.36 37
Alongside our findings this suggests that while inequalities in
life expectancy decreased during the period of the strategy,
inequalities in mental health may have increased. Others have
also reported that inequalities in smoking remained fairly stable
during the strategy period,14 while inequalities in obesity
increased,15 suggesting that the narrowing of inequalities in life
expectancy we observed was not due to reduced inequalities in
these lifestyle factors.
Role of economic trends, public investment,
and welfare policy during strategy period
We found that there was a reversal in the trend in health
inequalities from 2003. We cannot conclusively say whether
this change would or would not have happened in the absence
of the strategy. During the 1980s and 1990s there were relatively
high levels of unemployment and increases in income inequality
and poverty, whereas from the late 1990s to 2008 there was
considerable economic stability, relatively low unemployment,
and reductions in child and pensioner poverty (see
supplementary appendix 9). These economic trends could in
part explain changes in these health inequalities. Although some
of these economic changes were due to global forces, some
national policies such as the introduction of tax and pension
credits, that were part of the health inequalities strategy,
contributed to these economic trends by reducing levels of
poverty.5 13 From 2000 to 2010 there was also a noticeable upturn
in public expenditure—in particular on health, education,
housing, and local government (see supplementary appendix
9). This increased social investment may have led to the reduced
health inequalities we observed. These investments, however,
can also be seen as part of the health inequalities strategy. For
example, increased investment in housing was necessary to
achieve one of the departmental commitments of the strategy,
to improve the quality of 370 000 homes.7 An important
component of the health inequalities strategy was to influence
the distribution of this increased investment, with NHS and
local government expenditure growing most in the most deprived
areas during the strategy period (see supplementary appendix
9). There was not always a clear distinction between policies
that were part of the health inequalities strategy and policies
that would have happened anyway in the absence of the strategy.
Our analysis shows, however, that this period of increased social
investment across the whole of government, targeted at
disadvantaged areas and groups, was associated with a decline
in health inequalities.
Role of health service
From our analysis we were not able to determine the relative
contribution of health service focused actions compared with
those tackling the social determinants of health. We know there
was a shift in NHS resources to more disadvantaged areas,
leading to a substantial decline in inequalities in the provision
and quality of primary care21-39 and a narrowing in inequalities
in mortality amenable to healthcare.19 However, regeneration
initiatives, improved child care, antipoverty measures, and
improvements in housing may also have been important. The
actions in the Spearhead areas, which started from 2006, focused
on increasing uptake of smoking cessation services and drugs
to control blood pressure and reduce cholesterol levels.3 We
found that there was an additional decline in inequality, from
2006, that particularly affected the Spearhead areas, suggesting
that these actions might have had an impact. Other studies also
have found that some indicators of primary care quality
disproportionately improved in Spearhead areas, even when
accounting for a narrowing of inequalities between
socioeconomically deprived and less deprived areas.38 39
Role of financial crisis and austerity policies
The reversal of the trend in health inequalities from 2012 could
be related to the delayed effects of the 2008-09 recession. There
is little evidence, however, that recessions in themselves have
an impact on inequalities in mortality.40-44 A more likely
explanation is that this is related to the reductions in public
spending that occurred since 2010 as part of the government’s
austerity programme. Several recent papers investigating
increases in mortality since 201245-47 have come to similar
conclusions. Other studies have linked recent adverse trends in
the health of more disadvantaged groups to cuts in welfare
benefits.48-50 The austerity programme reversed many of the
policies that were introduced as part of the strategy51-53 and we
cannot distinguish between the ending of the strategy and the
wider programme of austerity that started at the same time (see
supplementary appendix 9).
Implications for policy
Our results have important implications for policy. Whereas
previous assessments have concluded that the English health
inequalities strategy had little or no effect on geographical health
inequalities,31 we have found that it was associated with a

 reduction in geographical inequalities, reversing a long term
adverse trend. The findings indicate that a comprehensive
strategy characterised by an increase in social investment
targeted at the most deprived parts of the country, in conjunction
with high level commitment from across government
departments backed up by national targets, could be effective
at reducing geographical heath inequalities.10 This approach
has, however, been disbanded by the governments in power
since 2010 and it is of particular concern that we are now seeing
a reversal of the gains made during the strategy period. In her
first speech in July 2016, the UK’s new Prime Minister, Theresa
May, stressed her desire to tackle health inequalities. To do this
she will need to build on and learn from the successes of the
previous health inequalities strategy, rather than following a
policy programme that may further widen health inequalities.

 What is already known on this topic
Between 1997 and 2010 the UK government implemented a comprehensive strategy to reduce health inequalities in England
The Department of Health’s own assessment in 2010 concluded that the targets of the strategy had not been met, and several
commentators concluded that it had not been successful
The effects of the strategy, however, may not have been fully realised by this time, and more recent studies have reported that inequalities
in mortality narrowed during the strategy period
What this study adds
Trends in geographical health inequalities before, during, and after the strategy show that the strategy may have reduced these inequalities,
reversing a previously increasing trend
The findings suggest that a cross government strategy that targets increased social investment at more deprived areas and population
groups can reduce health inequalities
Current government policies are potentially reversing these gains, and future approaches should learn from the experience of the
1997-2010 strategy
