 Association Between Playing American Football
in the National Football League and Long-term Mortality

IMPORTANCE Studies of the longevity of professional American football players have
demonstrated lower mortality relative to the general population but they may have been
susceptible to selection bias.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association between career participation in professional American
football and mortality risk in retirement.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study involving 3812 retired US
National Football League (NFL) players who debuted in the NFL between 1982 and 1992,
including regular NFL players (n = 2933) and NFL “replacement players” (n = 879) who were
temporarily hired to play during a 3-game league-wide player strike in 1987. Follow-up ended
on December 31, 2016.
EXPOSURES NFL participation as a career player or as a replacement player.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was all-cause mortality by December
31, 2016. Cox proportional hazards models were estimated to compare the observed number
of years from age 22 years until death (or censoring), adjusted for birth year, body mass
index, height, and position played. Information on player death and cause of death was
ascertained from a search of the National Death Index and web-based sources.
RESULTS Of the 3812 men included in this study (mean [SD] age at first NFL activity, 23.4 [1.5]
years), there were 2933 career NFL players (median NFL tenure, 5 seasons [interquartile
range {IQR}, 2-8]; median follow-up, 30 years [IQR, 27-33]) and 879 replacement players
(median NFL tenure, 1 season [IQR, 1-1]; median follow-up, 31 years [IQR, 30-33]). At the end
of follow-up, 144 NFL players (4.9%) and 37 replacement players (4.2%) were deceased
(adjusted absolute risk difference, 1.0% [95% CI, −0.7% to 2.7%]; P = .25). The adjusted
mortality hazard ratio for NFL players relative to replacements was 1.38 (95% CI, 0.95 to 1.99;
P = .09). Among career NFL players, the most common causes of death were cardiometabolic
disease (n = 51; 35.4%), transportation injuries (n = 20; 13.9%), unintentional injuries (n = 15;
10.4%), and neoplasms (n = 15; 10.4%). Among NFL replacement players, the leading causes
of death were cardiometabolic diseases (n = 19; 51.4%), self-harm and interpersonal violence
(n = 5; 13.5%), and neoplasms (n = 4; 10.8%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among NFL football players who began their careers between
1982 and 1992, career participation in the NFL, compared with limited NFL exposure
obtained primarily as an NFL replacement player during a league-wide strike, was not
associated with a statistically significant difference in long-term all-cause mortality. Given the
small number of events, analysis of longer periods of follow-up may be informative.

 C
oncerns around the long-term health of professional
football players in the National Football League (NFL)
have intensified since 2009.1,2 Career participation in
professional football may be potentially harmful for several
reasons, including exposure to harmful league-specific life-
style factors and substance abuse (such as the use of anabolic
steroids3) that may confer long-term harm, repeated expo-
sure to head trauma that may result in adverse neurodegen-
erative changes (eg, chronic traumatic encephalopathy4,5),
and difficulties in adjusting to life after retirement from the
NFL.6 In contrast, other factors, such as exceptional access to
training, health care, and greater income, may be protective
of long-term health.7,8
Two studies of NFL pension-eligible retired players
found significantly lower overall and cardiovascular mortal-
ity for career NFL players compared with age- and race/
ethnicity-matched US general population controls.9,10 Simi-
larly designed studies using these data have found no
differences in mortality from suicide,11 although perhaps a
higher risk of mortality from neurodegenerative diseases.12
A limitation of existing observational studies of mortality of
NFL players is bias that may result from the comparison of
participants who differ in underlying mortality risk. NFL
players—and professional athletes more generally—are physi-
ologically distinct from members of the general population,
often in ways that suggest more robust health.13 A more
valid comparison group would be individuals with similar
athletic or physiologic attributes and lifestyles.
This study proposes such a comparison group. Specifi-
cally, in 1987, a 3-game league-wide NFL player strike neces-
sitated the replacement of regular NFL players with substi-
tute rosters. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to
examine the risk of mortality during retirement among ca-
reer NFL players compared with NFL “replacement players.”
Methods
The Partners Healthcare Human Research Committee ap-
proved the study protocol (2017P001511), which included use
of the US National Death Index (NDI) in the manner that did
not require participant consent.
Background and Research Strategy
This study’
s primary objective was to examine the associa-
tion between career exposure to the NFL and mortality. To
obtain an appropriate comparison group for NFL athletes, the
study used data from a period during which the NFL Players’
Association initiated a 24-day strike over collective bargain-
ing rules around free agency.14 During this period, which
occurred after the second week of the 1987 season, team
owners enlisted replacement players to fill rosters and con-
tinue play during the fourth through sixth weeks of the sea-
son, after which the strike ended. NFL replacement players
were typically former college football players, players who
were released from their NFL team during the preseason, or
former players from rival leagues.14,15 NFL replacement play-
ers in the 1987 season serve as an appropriate comparison
group for career NFL players under the assumption that
replacement players were experienced athletes fit enough to
obtain an NFL roster position with the exit of another profes-
sional athlete, but relatively unexposed to an NFL career (ie,
expected to play at most 3 games).
Study Population
Pro Football Reference (PFR), an online database cover-
ing the census of professional American football players
since the 1920s, was used to obtain baseline character-
istics of the study population.16 The PFR database, main-
tained by Sports Reference LLC and freely available online
(http://www.pro-football-reference.com), draws from a wide
variety of historic and current team and game statistics. It
includes information on player demographics (date and
location of birth and date of death); tenure (number of years
and games played); position; and height and body mass index
(BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared), in addition to detailed information on
professional football statistics. These data have been used in
other studies.17-21
NFL replacement players were identified in the PFR data-
base using team media guides and online compilations of
team rosters from the 1987 season.16,22 Roster information
specifically denoting NFL replacement players was cross-
checked against game-by-game summaries from the fourth
to sixth weeks of the 1987 season when the player strike was
in force. We focused on career NFL players who debuted
between 1982 and 1992 based on sample size considerations
and to form a narrow window around the strike year and
increase birth cohort overlap between NFL career and
replacement players. Players who played primarily as place
kickers and punters, as well as players who died prior to
retirement from the NFL, were excluded from the cohort.
Covariates, including birth year, BMI and height (recorded in
the last year of participation in the NFL), and position, were
drawn from the PFR database.

ber 31, 2016. All-cause mortality and dates and causes of
Key Points
Question Is regular participation as a player in the National
Football League (NFL) associated with long-term mortality risk?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study of 3812 NFL players
who debuted between 1982 and 1992, there was no statistically
significant difference in the risk of long-term all-cause mortality
among career NFL players compared with NFL replacement
players who participated in the NFL during a 3-game league-wide
player strike in 1987 (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI,
0.95-1.99).
Meaning Career participation in NFL football, compared
with participation as an NFL replacement player, was not
associated with a statistically significant difference in the risk
of all-cause mortality.

 death were ascertained and validated using 2 complemen-
tary strategies. In the first strategy, a research assistant
blinded to the purpose of the study identified mortality
events using a variety of sources, including football player
databases (PFR, the Oldest Living Pro Football Players
database,23 and NFL.com24), Google searches, genealogy
databases (Ancestry.com and FamilySearch.org), and the
Social Security Death Index. If no record of death was found,
attempts were made to verify that the player was currently
alive using additional Google searches as well as through
professional social networks (eg, LinkedIn). In the second
strategy, the NDI was used to search for matches based on
player first and last name, exact dates of birth, sex, and state
of birth (social security numbers were not available).25
Deaths that were initially found in web searches but not
listed as exact matches in an NDI search were verified among
probablematchesintheNDI.Similarly,deathsfoundintheNDI
but not in initial web searches were verified in a second, tar-
geted web search. Potential deaths deemed sufficiently prob-
able in the NDI were also subjected to targeted web searches.
Full details of this approach are provided in the eAppendix in
theSupplement.Thecombineduseofweb-basedsearches,the
Social Security Death Index, and NDI has been shown to re-
sultinhighsensitivityandspecificityinotherpopulations,such
as elderly US individuals.26
Statistical Analysis
As the number of NFL replacement players was fixed (n = 879),
thelog-ranktest–basedmethodwasusedtocalculatethenum-
ber of career NFL players needed to detect a relative mortal-
ity hazard of 1.4 with 80% power and a 2-sided type I error of
.05 (see the eAppendix and eFigure 1 in the Supplement for
further details).27 The chosen hazard ratio reflects the hazard
of death estimated in an analysis of NFL player mortality by
length of tenure.21 The required sample size was 2850 career
NFL players, which was met by focusing on career players de-
buting between 1982 and 1992.
Baseline characteristics of career NFL players and NFL re-
placement players were compared using t tests and χ2 tests.
Unadjusted and adjusted differences in absolute mortality risk
were estimated across the 2 groups. Kaplan-Meier curves and
Coxproportionalhazardmodelswereusedtoestimatethemor-
tality hazard for career NFL players relative to NFL replace-
ment players. Time was measured on an attained age time
scale28 starting from the year the individual turned 22 years
old—the time at which most NFL players graduated college and
entered the league—to the end of the study (end line; Decem-
ber 31, 2016). The models accounted for left truncation, as in-
dividuals were at risk from the time of last football activity.29
Statistical significance of estimates from Kaplan-Meier
curves was ascertained using the log-rank test. In Cox pro-
portional hazards models, covariates that were adjusted
for included birth year; BMI and player height (the latter
of which was included given well-described associations with
mortality in the literature30); and player position, which fol-
lowing prior studies, was grouped into 3 categories denoting
different physiologic requirements (1: defensive back, quar-
terback, and wide receiver; 2: running back (including full-
back and halfback), linebacker, and tight end; and 3: offen-
sive linemen and defensive lineman).9 The proportional
hazards assumption was formally tested by examining the re-
lationship between Schoenfeld residuals and event time.31
Causes of death were descriptively examined among NFL
career and replacement players, grouping International Clas-
sification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and International Statis-
tical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems,
Tenth Revision codes denoting the underlying cause of death
into broad categories defined by the Global Burden of Disease
Project.32,33 The percentage of deaths represented by each
broad cause was calculated within each player group and pre-
sented descriptively.
Sensitivity Analyses
Two sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, the main
hazard models were additionally adjusted for birth county–
level socioeconomic measures (rates of unemployment, pov-
erty, high school graduation, and nonwhite race/ethnicity
percentage obtained from the 1970 US Census). This allowed
assessment of the sensitivity of the findings to adjusting for a
proxy for player race/ethnicity7 and differences in early child-
hood environments, which are key drivers of long-run socio-
economic status and health in population-based studies.34,35
Second, the models were reestimated after removing all
NFL replacement players who had professional football expe-
rience (in the NFL or other professional leagues) prior to the
strike year.
All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata ver-
sion 15 (StataCorp). All 95% CIs and P values were based on
2-sided hypothesis tests, where P < .05 was considered sta-
tistically significant.
Results
Sample Characteristics
The study sample consisted of 2933 career NFL players and
879 NFL replacement players (Table 1). Four career NFL play-
ers were excluded from the sample because they died while
actively employed on an NFL roster. By the study’
s end point,
the career NFL players’mean age was 1.5 years younger than
that of NFL replacement players (mean [SD] age, 52.7 [3.2]
years vs 54.2 [1.9] years [difference, 1.5; 95% CI of difference,
1.25-1.70]; P < .001). The career NFL players’mean age was 1
year younger than that of NFL replacement players at debut
(mean [SD] age, 23.2 [1.2] years vs 24.2 [1.8] years [difference,
1.0; 95% CI of difference, 0.85-1.07]; P < .001) and 2.7 years
older at retirement (mean [SD] age, 27.6 [3.9] years vs 24.9
[2.2] years [difference, 2.7; 95% CI of difference, 2.4-3.0];
P < .001). The 0.7-year difference between mean age at debut
and retirement for NFL replacement players reflects that 155
(18%) played at least 1 game in seasons prior to the strike year
and another 54 (6%) played in a subsequent season.
Mean BMI and mean height at the time of NFL participa-
tion were similar between career NFL players and NFL replace-
ment players (mean [SD] BMI, 29.7 [3.7] vs 29.4 [3.3]; P = .03;
mean [SD] height, 187.2 [6.8] cm vs 187.0 [6.4] cm; P = .62).

 All-Cause Mortality
A total of 181 deaths occurred over a total time at risk of 95 441
person-years. A total of 144 deaths occurred among career NFL
players (median follow-up, 30 years; interquartile range, 27-
33) and 37 deaths occurred among NFL replacement players
(median follow-up, 31 years; interquartile range, 30-33). The
mortality risk by study end line was 4.9% for career NFL play-
ers and 4.2% for NFL replacement players, and the unad-
justed absolute risk difference was 0.7% (95% CI, −0.9% to
2.2%; P = .39). Adjusting for birth year, BMI, height, and po-
sitiongroup,theabsoluteriskdifferencewas1.0%(95%CI,−0.7
to 2.7; P = .25) (Table 2).
The Figure presents unadjusted time-to-death curves
for career NFL players vs NFL replacement players. The
mortality curve for career NFL players was not significantly
different from the curve for NFL replacement players (log-
rank test: χ 2
1 = 3.26; P = .07). Table 2 presents the Cox pro-
portional hazard estimates of differential mortality risk.
Career NFL players had a mortality hazard of 1.39 (95% CI,
0.97 to 2.00; P = .08) relative to NFL replacement players.
The estimate did not vary substantively with the inclusion
of additional covariates: in the model with all covariates,
the estimated mortality hazard was 1.38 (95% CI, 0.95 to
1.99; P = .09). Among statistically significant variables, BMI
was positively associated with mortality risk (see eTable 1 in
the Supplement for the full set of estimates). Formal tests
did not reveal failure of the proportional hazard assumption
(eFigure 2 in the Supplement).

 Causes of Death
Table 3 presents the distribution of deaths among career NFL
players and replacement players by cause of death categories
(eTable 2 in the Supplement lists detailed causes of death re-
corded in the NDI). A known cause of death was identified for
176 of 181 players (97%), including 35 of 37 NFL replacement
players (95%) and 141 of 144 career NFL players (98%).
Among career NFL players (144 deaths), the most com-
mon causes of death were cardiometabolic disease (n = 51;
35.4%), transportation injuries (n = 20; 13.9%), unintentional
injuries (n = 15; 10.4%), and neoplasms (n = 15; 10.4%). Among
NFL replacement players (37 deaths), the leading causes of
death were cardiometabolic diseases (n = 19; 51.4%), self-
harm and interpersonal violence (n = 5; 13.5%), and neo-
plasms (n = 4; 10.8%). Ten of the 15 career NFL player deaths
(and 1 of the 2 replacement player deaths) from unintentional
injuries were due to accidental poisonings (from substances,
medications, and/or biological substances, most of which were
unspecified). There were 7 deaths (4.9%) from neurological
causes in the career NFL player group and none in the NFL re-
placementplayergroup.All7ofthesedeathswereduetoamyo-
trophic lateral sclerosis.
Sensitivity Analyses
Findings were similar after adjusting for county-of-birth race/
ethnicity distributions and socioeconomic characteristics
(adjusted absolute risk difference, 0.9% [95% CI, −0.8% to
2.6%],P = .29;adjustedhazardratio,1.36[95%CI,0.94to1.96],
P = .11; eTable 3 in the Supplement) and in models excluding
NFL replacement players with professional experience prior
to 1987 (adjusted absolute risk difference, 0.8% [95% CI, −1.0%
to 2.6%], P = .41; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.33 [95% CI, 0.90 to
1.96], P = .15; eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this study of NFL players who debuted between 1982 and
1992, career participation in the NFL, compared with limited
NFL exposure obtained primarily as a replacement player dur-
ing a league-wide strike, was not associated with a statisti-
cally significant difference in the risk of long-term all-cause
mortality.
In this study, the use of NFL replacement players pro-
vided a comparison group that is more likely closely matched
in terms of unobserved characteristics that affect long-term
health than age- and race/ethnicity-matched general popula-
tion controls, the main comparison group used in prior stud-
ies of the association between NFL participation and mortal-
ity to date.9,10,12 Other research has examined differences in
mortality by position played or length of tenure, both of which
may be associated with mortality.9,18,21 However, these ap-
proaches cannot address the question of whether playing pro-
fessional football is associated with an increased risk of mor-
tality relative to not playing. The use of NFL replacement
players as a control group in the current study allows a more
direct comparison.
While the present study could not precisely determine an
association between career NFL participation and mortality,
the 95% CIs are not consistent with a large inverse associa-
tion with mortality such as found in research that used gen-
eral population controls.9,10,12 Moreover, the estimates in this
study may represent lower bounds on the association be-
tween career NFL participation and mortality as it is possible
that there remained systematic differences between the player
groups—such as better physical health, skill, and earnings, par-
ticularlyamongNFLplayerswithlongertenures—thatareposi-
tively correlated with long-term health.

The figure plots Kaplan-Meier mortality curves for career NFL players vs NFL
replacement players. The median duration of follow-up was 30 years
(interquartile range, 27-33) in the career NFL player group and 31 years
(interquartile range, 30-33) in the NFL replacement player group. The mortality
curve for career NFL players was not significantly different from the mortality
curve for NFL replacement players (log-rank test: χ2
1 = 3.26). The numbers at
risk initially increase because players are not considered at risk until retirement
(left truncation). The drop in the number at risk at the end of event time was
due to differences in player birth cohort.

 Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the residual differ-
ences between career NFL players and NFL replacement play-
ers that may bias the results could not be addressed. Addi-
tional research that collects data on medical comorbidities,
lifestyle factors, and earnings across the 2 groups could fur-
ther address this bias. A complementary approach might fo-
cus on groups of NFL career and replacement players who are
more similar in their duration of NFL exposure. For example,
comparing career NFL players with shorter tenures vs NFL re-
placement players may avoid healthy worker bias from play-
ers who are able to persist in the league because of better un-
observed health. Another consideration for researchers is how
to model exposure for NFL replacement players who partici-
pated in the NFL outside of the strike year or played in other
professional leagues in the United States and Canada. In the
current analyses, excluding these players did not substan-
tively change the findings.
Second, the estimates were based on a small number of
events: 181 deaths, of which only 37 occurred among NFL re-
placementplayers.Consequently,thepresentanalysiscouldbe
underpowered to detect meaningful associations. Additional
analyses with longer-term follow-up may be informative.
Third, the data were drawn from online databases. While
these have been used in other analyses,17-21 it is possible that
some information was misreported, particularly for NFL re-
placement players. A consequence of the use of web-based
sources was that reliable information on player race/ethnicity
was not available. However, in sensitivity analysis, the use of
county-of-birth measures of race/ethnicity, which follows
from other research in which reliable information on indi-
vidual race/ethnicity was not available,7 did not appreciably
change the point estimates.
Fourth, the data used in this study cannot be used to iden-
tify mechanisms underlying career participation in profes-
sional football and health. In this regard, studies that account
for differences in medical comorbidities or lifestyles may pro-
vide useful insights.
Fifth, the results may be specific to NFL players who de-
buted between 1982 and 1992. It is possible that cohorts who
debuted at other times faced different mortality risks.
Conclusions
Among NFL football players who began their careers be-
tween 1982 and 1992, career participation in the NFL, com-
pared with limited NFL exposure obtained primarily as an NFL
replacement player during a league-wide strike, was not as-
sociated with a statistically significant difference in long-
term all-cause mortality. Given the small number of events,
analysis of longer periods of follow-up may be informative.
