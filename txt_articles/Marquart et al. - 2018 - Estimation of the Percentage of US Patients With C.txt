IMPORTANCE To date, the benefit of genome-driven cancer therapy has not been quantified.
OBJECTIVE We sought to estimate the annual percentage of patients in the United States
with advanced or metastatic cancer who could be eligible for and benefit from US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved genome-driven therapy from 2006 to 2018.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cross-sectional study using publically
available data of (1) demographic characteristics of patients with advanced or metastatic
cancer; (2) FDA data on cancer drugs approved from January 2006 through January 2018;
(3) measures of response and duration of response from drug labels; and (4) published
reports estimating the frequency of various genomic aberrations used to estimate what
percentage of patients would have been eligible for and would have benefited from
genome-driven therapy during the studied period.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Estimated percentage of US patients with cancer eligible
for and benefiting from genome-targeted and genome-informed therapy by year, response
rate of genome-informed indications, and duration of response.
RESULTS A total of 31 drugs with 38 FDA-approved indications met our inclusion criteria for
genome-targeted or genome-informed therapy from January 1, 2006, through January 31,
2018. The estimated number of patients eligible for genome-targeted therapy in 2006 was
28 729 of a total 564 830 patients with metastatic cancer, or 5.09% (95% CI, 5.03%-5.14%).
By 2018, this number had increased to 50 811 of 609 640, or 8.33% (95% CI, 8.26%-8.40%).
For genome-informed therapy in 2006, the eligible number of patients was 59 301 of
564 830, or 10.50% (95% CI, 10.42%-10.58%). In 2018, genome-informed treatment could
be offered to 94 157 of 609 640, or 15.44% (95% CI, 15.35%-15.53%) of patients with
metastatic cancer. The percentage of patients with cancer estimated to benefit from
genome-targeted therapy in 2006 was 0.70% (95% CI, 0.68%-0.72%), and in 2018, it had
increased to 4.90% (95% CI, 4.85%-4.95%). For genome-informed treatment in 2006, the
percentage estimated to benefit was 1.31% (95% CI, 1.28%-1.34%), and in 2018, it had
increased to 6.62% (95% CI, 6.56%-6.68%). The median overall response rate for all
genome-informed drugs through January 2018 was 54%, and the median duration of
response was 29.5 months.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although the number of patients eligible for genome-driven
treatment has increased over time, these drugs have helped a minority of patients with
advanced cancer. To accelerate progress in precision oncology, novel trial designs of genomic
therapies should be developed, and broad portfolios of drug development, including
immunotherapeutic and cytotoxic approaches, should be pursued.

ince the earliest reports of the clinical efficacy of ima-
tinib, a potent targeted inhibitor of the ABL kinase, in-
terest in the use of genome-driven therapies has grown
in cancer medicine. Recently, many have sought to take stock
of genomic cancer medicine.1-5 These assessments docu-
ment reasons for optimism. Clear success stories of genome-
targeted medicine, such as targeting BRAF V600 mutations in
melanoma,6 ERBB2/HER2-directed therapy in breast cancer,7
and targeting the BCR-ABL fusion gene in chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML), have demonstrated the power of genomic
therapy and its benefit to patients. Genomic oncology has
indeed led to transformational successes.
Despite considerable excitement at the prospect of ge-
nome-driventherapytoimproveoncologiccare,therehasbeen
littleempiricalassessmentofitsbenefit.Allrecentreviewshave
been narrative in nature. For this reason, we sought to esti-
mate the penetrance of genome-driven oncology. We asked
whatpercentageofUSpatientswithcanceroverthelast12years
were eligible for and benefited from genome-targeted and
genome-informed therapies. In our primary analysis, we con-
sidered advanced and metastatic tumors (which account for
thelargestuseofthesetherapies),andinasupplementalanaly-
sis, we broadened our review to consider incident cancers and
the use of genome therapies in the adjuvant setting.
Methods
Overview
Thisstudywasnotsubmittedforinstitutionalreviewboardap-
proval because it did not involved health care records, and all
data are publically available. The study was conducted be-
tween January 12, 2018, and March 20, 2018. We sought to es-
timate what percentage of patients in the United States with
advancedormetastaticcancerannuallywere(1)eligibleforand
(2) benefited from either genome-targeted or genome-
informedtherapies.Wedefinedgenome-targeteddrugsasthose
approved to be given based on findings of a genomic test where
the drug targeted the aberration detected by that test. We
defined genome-informed therapies more broadly, as all
genome-targeted drugs and additionally any drug given after a
genomic test, regardless of whether the drug was meant to tar-
get the abnormalities found in the test or acted via an alterna-
tive mechanism of action. We defined patients as eligible for
these treatments if they had the tumor type and genomic
abnormality that were the indications for the given drug; we
defined benefit from according to available published sources
on what proportion of patients could expect to experience a
response; and we reported the findings on an annual basis.

Estimating the Number of Patients Eligible for Therapy per Year
Wecollectedannualmortalitystatisticsbycancertypefromthe
AmericanCancerSociety9toascertainthenumberofpatientswho
died annually and could have benefited from genome-targeted
or genome-informed therapies. For this group, we used death

For each cancer drug approval, we estimated what propor-
tionofpatients(bymortalitystatistics)wouldhavebeeneligible
for that therapy in each year from the drug approval date to the
present.Forinstance,considerafatinib,whichwasapprovedin

gible for this drug, we first obtained the number of deaths from
lungcancerinthatyear,whichwas159 480.Wethenestimated
that 85% of these deaths would be due to NSCLC.10 Finally, we
estimated that 15% of such patients would have an activating
mutation of EGFR.11 A full list of all assumptions, and their
supporting references, for all genome-targeted and genome-
informed drug approvals is provided in eAppendix 2 in the

 Supplement.Usingtheseassumptions,weestimatedthat20334
patients of a total 580 350 cancer deaths in 2013, or 3.50% of
patients, would have been eligible for afatinib in that year. We
performedthiscalculationbyyearinallsubsequentyearsadjust-
ing accordingly as newer drugs were approved. Our analysis is
a best-case scenario assuming immediate and 100% market
penetration of the drug following approval.
EstimatingtheNumberofPatientsWhoBenefitFromTherapyperYear
To estimate the percentage of US patients with cancer who
could benefit each year, we performed an additional calcula-
tion. We multiplied the proportion of patients eligible for that
therapy by the response rate of the drug. In the case of afa-
tinib, the FDA label reports an overall response rate of 50.4%,
which would indicate that 10 248 of 580 350 patients or 1.77%
could benefit that year. We performed this calculation by year
inallsubsequentyearsadjustingaccordinglyasnewdrugswith
higher response rates became available.
Manyofthedrugsweexaminedwereapprovedonthebasis
ofsingle-arm,uncontrolledstudies,andpriorresearchsuggests
that these studies may have response rates 10% to 20% higher
than those seen in subsequent trials or real-world experience.12
For this reason, we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a
10%or20%relativereductionintheresponserate.Inotherwords,
ifaresponseratewas20%,weperformedananalysiswithan18%
and 16% response rate. This is reported separately.
Multiple Drugs
When the second and third drugs were approved for the same
genome abnormality, we used the single highest response rate
(orresponseratedifferencefordrugstestedincombinationwith
chemotherapybackbone).Ingeneral,whentherewerediscrep-
ancies between sources, we erred on the side of the highest
documented rates to give the most generous estimates for how
manypatientswouldbeeligibleandthenhowmanywouldben-
efit from genome-driven therapy. When ranges of mutational
prevalence were provided, we used the median.
Adjuvant Drugs
As a final analysis, we estimated the benefit of genome-
targeted drugs in the adjuvant setting. Here we used incident
cancer as the denominator. We used the increase in curative
fraction or long-term disease control to define “benefit from.
”
Statistical Analysis
We sought to provide a descriptive estimate of the percent-
ageofUSpatientswithadvancedormetastaticcancerwhowere
eligible for and benefited from genome-targeted and genome-
informed therapy. Thus, we provided 4 sets of estimates. This
wasadescriptivestudywithanalysisusingMicrosoftExceland
STATA version 13.0.
Results
We examined 31 drugs with 38 FDA approvals that met our cri-
teria as genome-targeted or genome-informed drugs be-
tween January 1, 2006, and January 31, 2018. Of these 38
approvals, 28 (73.7%) were categorized as genome-targeted
drugs, defined as those given based on the findings of a ge-
nomic test where the drug targets the aberration detected by
that test. The other 10 were part of our expanded classifica-
tion that includes all genome-targeted drugs plus any drug
given after a genomic test, even if the drug does not directly
target the abnormality detected by that test (ie, acts via an al-
ternative mechanism of action). The Table lists genome-
targeted and genome-informed as well as approved indica-
tions. Further information can be found in eAppendix 2 in the
Supplement. Detailed herein are the estimated percentages of
patients who were eligible for and benefited from genome-
targeted and genome-informed therapy; graphic illustrations
of these findings are provided in eAppendixes 3 through 6 in
the Supplement with a pie chart shown for each study year.
Estimated Percentages of Eligible Patients
In 2006, we estimate that 28 729 of the total 564 830 patients,
or 5.09% (95% CI, 5.03%-5.14%), were eligible for genome-
targeted therapy. We found that by 2018, the number of pa-
tients eligible for genome-targeted therapy had increased to

 50 811of609 640,or8.33%(95%CI,8.26%-8.40%)(Figure1A).
Forgenome-informedtherapyin2006,weestimatedthat59301
of 564 830, or 10.50% (95% CI, 10.42%-10.58%) of all patients,
were eligible for treatment. This number increased to 94 157 of
609 640, or 15.44% (95% CI, 15.35%-15.53%), for genome-
informed therapy in 2018 (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Estimated Percentages of Patients Who Benefited
Estimating the benefit of genome-targeted therapy, we found
that in 2006, 3965 of 564 830 patients, or 0.70% (95% CI,
0.68%-0.72%) of all patients, would have experienced a re-
sponse. By 2018, 29 899 of the 609 640, or 4.90% (95% CI,
4.85%-4.95%) of all patients, would have experienced a re-
sponse (Figure 1B). For genome-informed therapy in 2006, a
total of 7396 of 564 830 patients, or 1.31% (95% CI, 1.28%-
1.34%) of all patients would have benefited from these drugs.
By 2018, this number had increased to 40 349 of 609 640, or
6.62% (95% CI, 6.56%-6.68%) of all patients (eFigure 1 in the
Supplement).
Other Factors in Measuring Genome-Driven Therapy
Overall, the estimated number of patients eligible for genome-
targeted or genome-informed therapy increased from 2006 to
2018, as shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement. A jump in 2011
is attributable to the approval of the anaplastic lymphoma ki-
nase (ALK) inhibitor crizotinib for the treatment of NSCLC and
the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in melanoma. The second
jump in 2017 is due to the approval of dabrafenib (a BRAF in-
hibitor) and trametinib (a MEK inhibitor) for treatment of
NSCLC,aswellasenasidenibandmidostaurin,respectivelytar-
geting IDH2 and FLT3 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Genome-informed therapies experienced a jump with the
approval of PD-1 (programmed cell death 1) antibody drugs
(nivolumab and pembrolizumab) for colorectal cancer and
other solid tumors harboring high microsatellite instability.
Figure 2 illustrates the best overall response rate across the
study period for genome-informed drugs per genomic aber-
ration (Figure 2A) as well as the summed median duration of
responses (ie, the duration of all sequential therapies used for
the genomic aberration) (Figure 2B). Many trials have not re-
ported data on median duration of response. The median re-
sponse duration shown in Figure 2 assumes that the duration
of response was more than 80 months for drugs for which the
sources did not report the median or reported that the me-
dian was not reached. The median response rate for genome-
informed drugs was 54%, and the median duration of re-
sponse was 29.5 months.
We further explored the benefit in the treatment of local-
ized cancer of these genome-informed drugs, such as ima-
tinib, midostaurin, and trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting for
CML, GIST, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, AML, and breast
cancer. Regarding eligibility, we found that a total of 52 513 of
1 735 350 incident cancer cases, or 3.03% (95% CI, 3.00%-
3.05%)ofpatients,wouldbeeligibleforsuchtreatmentin2018.
We then estimated that a total of 11 923 of those 1 735 350, or
0.69% (95% CI, 0.67%-0.70%) might benefit from this treat-
ment in 2018 (eAppendix 7 in the Supplement). Finally, as-
suming a 10% and 20% reduction in response rates in real-
worlduse,wefoundthepercentageofpatientsbenefittingfrom
genome-targeted therapy to be 4.41% (95% CI, 4.36%-4.47%)
and 3.92% (95% CI, 3.87%-3.97%) in 2018, respectively, and
thosebenefittingfromgenome-informedtherapiestobe5.96%
(95% CI, 5.90%-6.02%) and 5.29% (95% CI, 5.24%-5.35%) in
2018, respectively.
Discussion
Cancer is, in part, a disorder of genomic regulation.1 Accord-
ingly, there is widespread interest in genome therapies, and
genomic drugs have led to major treatment successes. The
genome-informed therapies examined herein have a median
response rate of 54%, with a duration of response of 29.5
months. Yet, simultaneously, our investigation reveals oppor-

 tunity for improvement. Genome-informed therapies have
expanded slowly over time (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Cur-
rently, the percentage of patients who are eligible to receive
these therapies and the subset who may respond are rela-
tively small compared with the total burden of cancer deaths
in America. Visual inspection of the estimates over time does
not reveal clear evidence of an exponential increase in the dif-
fusion of genomic treatments. Such a pattern would be antici-
pated for early adoption of new innovations.13 For those who
hope that genome-informed therapies will lead to major
improvements in treatment of the overall population, novel
ways to accelerate diffusion should be considered.
One such approach is the use of next-generation sequenc-
ing efforts in broad collections of tumors, as detailed in re-
cent coverage guidance from the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services to cover Foundation Medicine (F1CDx) for
all patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.14 Yet,
even this expansive effort may only incrementally advance the
numbers presented in our analysis, which focus on FDA-
approved therapies. Consider the recent MOSCATO-1 Trial.15
In this study of 1035 adult patients originally intended to
undergo next-generation sequencing, only 199 (19%) were
paired with a genome-informed therapy. This percentage is
comparable to the highest reported estimates from single
centers.16 However, just 22 patients, or 2.1%, of the original
cohortwereabletoachieveanobjectiveresponse.15Thus,even
adding in the estimated number of patients who may achieve
a response from broad genomic sequencing, we may realisti-
cally expect this to be less than 10% of all US patients with can-
cer who will die annually. Many researchers have pointed to
other limitations of these broad sequencing strategies, includ-
ing cost, harms, and missed opportunities for conventional
therapies.17-22
Other researchers have anticipated that genome-
informed therapies might not be able to result in benefit for
most patients with cancer and have proposed a broader pur-
suit of functional cancer medicine.23 Other groups also have
proposedbroadgoalstoimprovepopulationcancerstatistics.24
Our findings suggest that broader portfolios of research fund-
ing may be required to improve cancer statistics for the
majority of Americans.
Limitations
As with any observational study, particularly one that seeks
to estimate a complex phenomenon, our study has limita-
tions. First, the decision to code a drug as genome-targeted or
genome-informed requires judgment. We sought to use a trans-
parent definition on which 2 oncologists agreed (E.Y.C. and
V.P.); however, we understand that others may have different
definitions. To accommodate these views, we performed a
sensitivity analysis using genome-informed drugs—a broader
set—yielding similar results.
Second, our analysis may be an overestimate of the ben-
efit of these drugs. We tended to use optimistic assumptions
in our estimate. First, we assumed immediate and 100%
penetrationofdrugandmoleculartesting.Real-worlddatasug-
gest that many mutations are poorly utilized in therapeutic
decisions and predictive tests, such as EGFR testing in
NSCLC,25or moderate testing, such as BRAF in melanoma.26
Our analysis assumes 100% testing for all patients in the year
the drug is approved. Where multiple drugs were approved for
the same genomic indication (eg, ALK-rearranged NSCLC), we
used the highest response rate of a targeted drug.
Third, we used deaths from a specific cancer as a surro-
gate for patients presenting with advanced or metastatic can-
cer in the year a drug was approved. We chose this measure

 because cancer stage is assigned in the Surveillance, Epide-
miology, and End Results (SEER) registry only at first
presentation,27 and the use of staging as a measure would
underestimatethenumberofpatientseligiblefortherapy.How-
ever, for drugs that transformed the natural history of a dis-
ease (such as CML), this method may underestimate the value
of the genomic agent. To overcome this limitation, we per-
formed a separate analysis for incident cases (detailed in
eAppendix 7 in the Supplement). Moreover, we did not
notice a marked change in cancer tumor death statistics by
year after genomic approvals.
Fourth, we began our analysis in 2006, owing to a lack of
obtainable data from the FDA website prior to this year, and
could have missed genome-targeted drugs that were
approved between 2000 and 2005. However, our analysis
includes all molecular drugs that were approved before this
date, such as ERBB2/HER2-directed, BCR-ABL-directed and
EGFR-directed therapies.
Fifth, we did not consider the use of off-label targeted
therapy. However, elsewhere our research group has per-
formed an analysis of these drugs28 and noted that drugs that
appear efficacious tend to receive subsequent approval and
would enter our data set. We also did not include efforts of
broad next-generation sequencing.
Sixth, our analysis was intended to approximate rates in a
broad fashion across a panel of different diseases with differ-
ent prognoses. Because there is a time lag between actual
diagnosis and death, by relying on mortality data, our
approachcalculatespenetrationrateswithinagivenyearforcan-
cers that were actually diagnosed in prior years. This could bias

anybiasislimitedgiventhegenerallypoorprognosisforthecan-
cersweexamined.Also,giventheconservativeassumptionswe
made throughout the estimation process, our estimates likely

For these reasons, we believe that the estimates reported
herein of patient eligibility for and benefit from genomic
therapy is fair and optimistic.
Conclusions
Although there are clear successes of genome-informed can-
cer drugs, our empirical analysis suggests that fewer than 16%
of patients are eligible for, and fewer than 7% benefit from,
these agents, even using permissive definitions. Over time, the
diffusion of genome-informed drugs has expanded linearly at
a rate of 0.5% per year, with no sign of inflection or change in
pace. Including the early results of broad next-generation
sequencing in the treatment of all solid tumors increases our
figures by approximately 2%. Therefore, we conclude that to
improve cancer outcomes for most Americans, we will need
to accelerate progress with genome-targeted approaches and
foster other approaches to improve patient outcomes, such as
drug development in immunotherapy and cytotoxic thera-
pies, among other strategies.
