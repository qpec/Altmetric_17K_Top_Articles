IMPORTANCE Physicians need information on how to use the first available high-sensitivity
troponin (hsTnT) assay in the United States to identify patients at very low risk for 30-day
adverse cardiac events (ACE).
OBJECTIVE To determine whether a negative hsTnT assay at 0 and 3 hours following
emergency department presentation could identify patients at less than 1% risk of a 30-day
ACE.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective, observational study at 15 emergency
departments in the United States between 2011 and 2015 that included individuals 21 years
and older, presenting to the emergency department with suspected acute coronary
syndrome. Of 1690 eligible individuals, 15 (no cardiac troponin T measurement) and 320
(missing a 0-hour or 3-hour sample) were excluded from the analyses.
EXPOSURES Serial hsTnT measurements (fifth-generation Roche Elecsys hsTnT assay).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Serial blood samples from each patient were collected after
emergency department presentation (once identified as a potential patient with acute
coronary syndrome) and 3 hours, 6 to 9 hours, and 12 to 24 hours later. Adverse cardiac
events were defined as myocardial infarction, urgent revascularization, or death. The upper
reference level for the hsTnT assay, defined as the 99th percentile, was established as 19 ng/L
in a separate healthy US cohort. Patients were considered ruled out for acute myocardial
infarction if their hsTnT level at 0 hours and 3 hours was less than the upper reference level.
Gold standard diagnoses were determined by a clinical end point committee. Evaluation of
assay clinical performance for acute myocardial infarction rule-out was prespecified; the
hypothesis regarding 30-day ACE was formulated after data collection.
RESULTS In 1301 healthy volunteers (50.4% women; median age, 48 years), the upper
reference level was 19 ng/L. In 1600 patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome
(48.4% women; median age, 55 years), a single hsTnTlevel less than 6 ng/L at baseline had a
negative predictive value for AMI of 99.4%. In 974 patients (77.1%) with both 0-hour and
3-hour hsTnT levels of 19 ng/L or less, the negative predictive value for 30-day ACE was
99.3% (95% CI, 99.1-99.6). Using sex-specific cutpoints, C statistics for women (0.952) and
men (0.962) were similar for acute myocardial infarction.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A single hsTnT level less than 6 ng/L was associated with a
markedly decreased risk of AMI, while serial levels at 19 ng/L or less identified patients at less
than 1% risk of 30-day ACE.

 M
ore than 7 million patients annually present to US
emergency departments (EDs) with symptoms sug-
gestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).1 Many of
these individuals (approximately 90%) will not have an acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) and will have no major adverse
cardiac events (ACEs), defined as MI, urgent revasculariza-
tion, or cardiac death, within the next 30 days. However, these
patients are commonly hospitalized or kept under observa-
tion for an evaluation that is often negative.2 In fact, rule-in
rates in some studies approach zero.3-6 This high rate of
negative evaluation occurs because of the nonspecific presen-
tation of ACS and the potential for ACE with inappropriate dis-
charge. There is general consensus that an acceptable ACS risk-
stratificationstrategyfordischargefromtheEDshouldidentify
a cohort with 30-day ACE rates less than 1%.7-9 This 1% rate
representsthebreakpointbetweentheriskofunnecessaryhos-
pitalizationresultinginmorbidityfromahospital-acquiredcon-
dition and the potential harm from an inappropriate ED dis-
charge.
Cardiac troponin T and I are well-established biomark-
ers for AMI diagnosis and outcome prediction.10-12 However,
conventional troponin assays lack the necessary sensitivity
and/or precision to be used reliably for the early identifica-
tion of patients at risk for 30-day ACE.13,14 Compared with
conventional assays, high-sensitivity troponin (hsTnT)
assays have significantly greater analytical sensitivity and
clinical negative predictive value (NPV) for the diagnosis of
AMI.15,16 Furthermore, they may allow the identification of
a cohort of ED patients with very low 30-day ACE.15,16 The
ability to identify patients at low risk of 30-day ACE could
have a significant effect on ACS risk stratification. It could
allow for more efficient inpatient resource use as well as
improved patient satisfaction and reduced operational
costs. Safe and rapid ED discharge could contribute to
reducing pressure on EDs and decreasing wait times, thus
allowing greater attention to other ED patients.
The first hsTnT assay in the United States became avail-
able in January 2017 (the fifth-generation Elecsys assay).
Our purpose was to evaluate the ability of this assay to iden-
tify ED patients with suspected ACS who are at very low risk
for 30-day ACE.
Methods
This was a prospective, observational study of patients with
suspected ACS enrolled at 15 US EDs from 2011 to 2015
(Charleston Area Medical Center, Charleston, West Virginia;
Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio; Cooper Uni-
versity Hospital, Camden, New Jersey; Duke University,
Durham, North Carolina; Health Science Center of Houston
Medical School, Houston, Texas; Henry Ford Health System,
Detroit, Michigan; Indianapolis University, Indianapolis,
Indiana; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota; Minneapolis

ton Wellesley Hospital, Newton, Massachusetts; Prince

eral Hospital, San Francisco, California; South Shore Hospi-
tal, Weymouth, Massachusetts; Thomas Jefferson Univer-
sity Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill; eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Roche Diagnostics, in collaboration with the clinical investi-
gators, collected data as part of a US Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) submission to evaluate the hsTnT Fifth Gen-
eration Elecsys TnT Short Turn Around Time (hsTnT Gen 5
STAT) assay (Roche Inc). All authors could request any
analysis from the database and assumed responsibility for
the complete manuscript and data integrity. Prior to study
start, ethics approval was obtained from all relevant institu-
tional review boards. The studies were conducted in accor-
dance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the
International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for
Good Clinical Practice, and the Code of Federal Regulations
21, Part 50.
After written informed consent, patients 21 years and
older presenting to the ED with symptoms of ACS were pro-
spectively enrolled. Inclusion criteria were symptoms sug-
gestive of ACS and ability to provide a baseline blood
sample within 24 hours of symptom onset. Exclusion crite-
ria were AMI within the last 3 months, transfer from another
medical facility, surgery (including percutaneous coronary
intervention) or hospitalization within the last 3 months,
recent cardioversion or defibrillation, acute noncardiac pri-
mary illness prior to enrollment (eg, severe sepsis), cardio-
genic shock, and pregnancy.
Serial blood samples from each patient were collected
after ED presentation (once identified as a potential patient
with ACS) and 3 hours, 6 to 9 hours, and 12 to 24 hours later.
Clinical care was otherwise dictated by local care standards.
An independent clinical events committee (CEC), made
up of 2 cardiologists and 1 emergency physician, adjudi-
cated the rule-in AMI diagnosis for each patient per the
Third Universal Definition of AMI criteria.13 The CEC had
access to all clinical data (including the local troponin assay
results), but was blinded to hsTnT Gen 5 STAT results and
the local diagnosis. Any discrepancies between the assigned
cardiologist and emergency physician (15% of cases) were
resolved by discussion or case review by the full committee.
The performance of the hsTnT Gen 5 STAT assay was deter-
mined by comparison of the hsTnT assay results with the
CEC-adjudicated diagnosis. Patients were followed up for
30 days to determine ACE, defined as all postdischarge
Key Points
Question Can a negative high-sensitivity troponin assay at 0 and
3 hours following emergency department presentation identify
patients at less than 1% risk of 30-day adverse cardiac events?
Findings In this multicenter evaluation, a single high-sensitivity
troponin level less than 6 ng/L ruled out myocardial infarction,
while serial levels at 19 ng/L or less identified patients at less than
1% risk of 30-day adverse cardiac events.
Meaning Identifying a low-risk cohort may permit early
emergency department discharge and avoid unnecessary
hospitalization.

 death, AMI, or urgent myocardial revascularization.
Follow-up was conducted via medical record review and
telephone contact.
Samples were collected in lithium heparin tubes, centri-
fuged for 15 minutes, and stored at –70°C. Troponin T con-
centrations were measured by laboratory personnel blinded
to sample origin identity, using the hsTnT Gen 5 STAT assay
on the cobas e 601 analyzer at 1 of 4 sites. The assay is an
electrochemiluminescence sandwich immunoassay, which
uses both ruthenium-labeled and biotin-labeled antibodies
to form a sandwich complex with troponin T. It has a speci-
fied range of 6 ng/L to 10 000 ng/L (all platforms) and a
limit of quantification (LoQ) of 6 ng/L. Although the limit of
detection for the hsTnT used in this analysis has been
reported to be 3 ng/L, results less than the LoQ are not
reported, per FDA regulations. Finally, no changes have
occurred in the manufacture of this assay since the start of
this investigation.
Reference Range Evaluation
Prior to this study, we performed a prospective, 4-center
evaluation to identify the reference range for the hsTnT
assay. After written informed consent was obtained, healthy
individuals 21 years and older were enrolled, and blood
samples were obtained to determine the 99th percentile
upper reference level (URL). Inclusion criteria were no cur-
rent diagnosis of cancer and no history of chronic disease
(heart, cancer, renal, thyroid, respiratory [excluding
asthma], autoimmune, or diabetes). Exclusion criteria
included a history of ACS, pregnancy or birth within 6
weeks, currently taking prescription drugs for chronic dis-
ease, hospitalization within the previous 3 months, or blood
pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg. The 99th percentile
hsTnT concentration from this cohort was subsequently
used as the URL for the evaluation of diagnostic perfor-
mance.
Data Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using R, version 3.2.2 (R
Foundation)17 and SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute) software.
TheCECadjudicationdiagnosiswasenteredintoaCodeofFed-
eral Regulations Part 11–compliant database. Clinical sensitiv-
ity, specificity, NPV, and positive predictive value (PPV) are ex-
pressed as point estimates and 95% Clopper-Pearson
confidence intervals for each sample time. We also evaluated
diagnostic test characteristics for the 99th percentile URL cut-
off overall and for sex-specific cutoffs.18 Cutoff-independent
receiver operator characteristic curves were plotted, and the
C statistic was calculated.
A post hoc analysis of serial hsTnT concentrations was per-
formed and the NPV for 30-day ACE determined. We second-
arily evaluated the effect of different 99th percentile URL cut-
offs (19 ng/L vs 14 ng/L).
Because the FDA restricts results less than the LoQ from
being reported, an analysis of the following hsTnT results at
time 0 hours and 3 hours, respectively, was performed in pa-
tients with hsTnT results of 19 ng/L or less: less than 6 ng/L
and less than 6 ng/L, less than 6 ng/L and between 6 and 19
ng/L inclusive, between 6 and 19 ng/L inclusive and less than
6 ng/L, and between 6 and 19 ng/L inclusive and between 6
and 19 ng/L inclusive.

Reference Range Evaluation
A total of 1312 healthy individuals were enrolled in the refer-
ence range analyses, of whom 11 were excluded (blood not ob-
tainable in 7 and inadequate sample in 4), leaving 1301 for
analysis. Of these, 656 were women (50.4%); 891 were white
(68.5%), 242 were African American (18.6%), 86 were Asian
(6.6%), and 77 were classed as “other” race/ethnicity (6.3%).
The median age was 48 years (interquartile range [IQR], 33-55
years) and did not differ between women and men (48 years;
IQR, 33-55 years and 47 years; IQR, 32-54 years, respec-
tively). The overall 99th percentile URL hsTnT concentration
was 19 ng/L. Sex-specific values were 22 ng/L and 14 ng/L in
men and women, respectively. The coefficient of variation for
imprecision at the URL was less than 10%.
Diagnostic Performance in Patients With Suspected ACS
A total of 1690 eligible patients with ACS symptoms were en-
rolled (Figure 1). Of these, 1679 had hsTnT measured at 1 or
more points. Follow-up information (30-day) was available for
1678 patients: 1564 were followed up by telephone (n = 1054)
and/or medical records review (n = 1618), 113 were lost to fol-
low-up, and for 1 patient, follow-up was not applicable. Pa-
tient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Median time
from symptom onset to presentation and presentation to base-
lineblooddrawwas2.9hours(IQR,1.4-6.6hours)and2.9hours
(IQR, 0.8-3.4 hours), respectively. Overall, 173 patients (10.3%)
had an adjudicated AMI diagnosis. The sensitivities, specifici-
ties, PPVs, and NPVs for the diagnosis of AMI, using the over-
all and sex-specific URL, are presented in Table 2. Diagnostic
performanceoftheassayusing99thpercentilesex-specificcut-
offs (14 ng/L in women and 22 ng/L in men) was comparable
with that based on the overall cutoff, with an NPV of 99.3% at
3 hours for both sexes. Because we used contemporary tropo-
nin gold standard, further research will be necessary to deter-
mine the need for sex-specific cutpoints. Overall, the C statis-
tic for AMI at 3 hours was 0.958, with little difference between
men and women (0.952 and 0.962, respectively).
The sensitivity and NPV peaked/plateaued at the 3-hour
sampling time. A single hsTnT measurement using the URL at
baselinehadinadequateperformanceforclinicaldecisionmak-
ing.Basedonasingle3-hoursample,thesensitivity,NPV,speci-

84.6%-88.4%), and 43.6% (95% CI, 37.9%-49.4%), respec-
tively.Unfortunately,basedonhsTnTalone,therewere8false-
negative results at 3 hours (Table 2); none of these patients ex-
perienced an additional ACE during the 30-day follow-up.

 Overall,of1355patientswithserialhsTnTresultsat0hours
and 3 hours (Figure 2A), 1052 had a non-AMI CEC diagnosis.
There were 1264 patients with hsTnT results at 0 hours and 3
hours and who had 30-day follow-up information (Figure 2B),
ofwhom290(22.9%)hadahsTnTlevelexceedingtheURL(>19
ng/L) at either point. This non–rule-out cohort had a 30-day
ACE rate of 2.8% (n = 8) vs 0.7% (n = 7) in the 974 patients
(77.1%) with both serial hsTnT measurements that were less
than the URL. Serial hsTnT levels less than the URL resulted
in a 99.3% NPV for 30-day ACE (Figure 2B). None of the 7 pa-
tients with serial 3-hour time false-negative results experi-
enced AMI or death within the subsequent 30 days.
Troponin trajectory was evaluated in greater detail in 974
patients with an hsTnT level of 19 ng/L or less at 0 and 3 hours.
For most of these patients, the hsTnT result did not cross the
LoQ margin during the 3 hours but had either both measures
less than (n = 559; 57.4%) or both greater than (n = 345; 35.4%)
theLoQ(6ng/L).TheirNPVfor30-dayACEwas99.3and99.1%,
respectively. Only 70 patients had their hsTnT result rise
(n = 35) or fall (n = 35) across the LoQ during the 0-hour and
3-hour sampling. Both of these cohorts had a 100% NPV for
30-day ACE (Figure 2B).
Figure3presentstheassay’sdiagnosticperformancebased
on various cutoffs. Using a cutoff of less than 6 ng/L for base-
line hsTnT concentrations (n = 1600) provided an AMI NPV of
99.4% (95% CI 98.6-99.8) and ruled out AMI in 50.3%. At 3
hours, the less than 6 ng/L cutoff (n = 1415) gave an NPV of
99.7% (95% CI, 99.0-100.0) for AMI rule-out in 48.7%.
Because clinicians were blinded to hsTnT, we evaluated
index visit hospitalization (defined as length of stay greater
than 24 hours) and coronary revascularization rates in
patients with a 0-hour and 3-hour hsTnT levels of 19 ng/L or
less (57.5% and 3.6%, respectively) vs the cohort with hsTnT
levels greater than 19 ng/L (89.2% and 21.8%, respectively).
Because of the time difference between presentation and
hsTnT measurement, a sensitivity analysis was performed
at the single baseline hsTnT before and after 6 hours follow-
ing symptom onset. While there were no statistical differ-
ences in performance, improvements in sensitivity (82%-
90.7%) and NPV (97.6%-98.9%) occurred at the cost of
specificity (88.8%-86.9%) and PPV (47.4%-42.8%), with lon-
ger times.
Because the rest of the world uses a lower URL (14 ng/L)
than the United States, an analysis of the diagnostic reclassi-
fication occurring between URLs was performed. This analy-
sis found only 2 of 140 CEC-confirmed AMIs having hsTnT val-
ues between the 2 URLs at the 3-hour sampling point (eFigure
2 in the Supplement).

 Discussion
We report that, in patients presenting to US EDs with sus-
pected ACS, hsTnT levels identified a large proportion at very
low 30-day ACE risk. Identifying a low-risk cohort may per-
mit early ED discharge and avoid unnecessary hospitaliza-
tion. Rapid turnaround of low-risk patients could translate into
a reduction in ED volumes, which would benefit patients
(shorter waiting times, increased satisfaction, improved out-
comes, and saved costs), clinicians (decreased diagnostic am-
biguity and medicolegal burden), and hospitals (by providing
cost-saving benefits).19-21
In this analysis, we used a hsTnT URL cutoff level of 19
ng/L. Derived from a healthy cohort, it represents the 99th per-
centile in the United States, consistent with the Third Univer-
sal Definition of AMI.13 This cutpoint exceeds the 14 ng/L used
globally and may be explained by geographically dependent
cardiovascular risk.22,23 When applied in clinical practice, the
clinician must consider the similarities of their population to
that used for the derivation of this cutpoint because the 99th
percentile is entirely dependent on the reference study popu-
lation. We also evaluated sex-specific URLs (14 ng/L for women
and 22 ng/L for men) and found diagnostic performance was
largely unchanged, in contrast to a prior report with high-
sensitive troponin I reporting a doubling of the female AMI rate
with sex-specific URLs.24,25
Based on the 19 ng/L cutoff and compared with a CEC-
adjudicated clinical diagnosis, the hsTnT assay had excellent

 sensitivity and NPV for the diagnosis of AMI and 30-day ACE.
Values for sensitivity and NPV at the 3-hour sampling point ex-
ceeded 99%, such that a 3-hour point may be adequate for the
earlyruleoutofAMIusingthe99thpercentileURL.Wedonote
that the high sensitivity and NPV were achieved at the cost of
a lower specificity and PPV.
Importantly, we demonstrate a very low rate of false-
negative results, associated with only limited clinical conse-
quences. None of the seven 3-hour time false-negative re-
sults were associated with AMI or death in the subsequent 30
days. We also evaluated the false-negative results between 0
and 3 hours to determine whether the magnitude of a serial
hsTnT change (ie, the Δ) could be predictive. Of the 8 false-
negative results, 6 did not have a hsTnT change greater than
22 ng/L, thus limiting the clinically utility of applying a serial
change (Δ).
An ACS diagnostic strategy with NPV of 99.3% for 30-day
ACE is clinically useful and acceptable. In this cohort, the NPV
for 30-day ACE exceeded 99% in all subgroups with hsTnT lev-
els of 19 ng/L or less at 0 and 3 hours. A rule-out strategy based
on a single hsTnT at presentation and using lower cutoffs has
been proposed by others.26,27 However, in our study, a single
hsTnT level of 19 ng/L or less is probably inadequate because
it provided an AMI NPV of only 98.2% at baseline presenta-
tion. Conversely, use of the LoQ cutoff (6 ng/L) may represent
a potential option because it demonstrated an AMI NPV of
99.4%.
The median time from symptom onset to ED presenta-
tion was 2.9 hours, while time from symptom onset to base-
line hsTnT was 5.8 hours. Clinicians should consider that the
performance characteristics of hsTnT may not be duplicated
at earlier times.
Limitations
This study has several limitations in the clinical application of
its results. First, as an observational analysis with the results
blindedtotheclinician,noclinicaldecisionmakingoccurredas
a result of the hsTnT results, although fewer patients were hos-
pitalized in the rule-out cohort (57.5%) vs the rule-in cohort
(89.2%).SomepatientswithanegativehsTnTwerehospitalized

of hsTnT (eg, recent prior AMI or renal insufficiency) were ex-
cluded from enrollment in this trial; thus, the patients enrolled
in this study should be considered when making clinical deci-
sions.Third,thesedataarenotapplicabletoenvironmentsthat

ingrelianceonsubjectivelygatheredinformation;however,the
potential for risk stratification tools to affect a “one-and-done”
singletroponinstrategyrequiresadditionalinvestigation.Finally,
because of the blinded nature of the hsTnT, we cannot present

cal criteria.
Strengths of the study include that the reference range
population was representative of the US population (with the
caveat that most of participating hospitals were larger aca-
demiccenters)andgenerallyinlinewithNationalHospitalAm-
bulatory Medical Care Survey data for patients receiving car-
diac biomarker testing in the ED, more than double the size of
the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry criteria,28,29
and is relevant to the region where the test is used most. Fur-
thermore, the precision criteria of the assay at the cutoff met
the criteria defined in the third universal definition of AMI.13
Finally, we focused on a clinically relevant outcome (NPV) to
identify patients potentially safe for early ED discharge.
Conclusions
In this multicenter evaluation, we demonstrated that a
0-hour and 3-hour hsTnT assay using less than 6 ng/L pro-
vides a safe and early rule-out for AMI and identified a large
cohort of patients with suspected ACS at very low risk of
30-day ACE.
