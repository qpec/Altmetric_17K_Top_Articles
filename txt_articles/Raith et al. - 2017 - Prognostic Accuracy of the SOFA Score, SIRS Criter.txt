IMPORTANCE The Sepsis-3 Criteria emphasized the value of a change of 2 or more points in
the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, introduced quick
SOFA (qSOFA), and removed the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria
from the sepsis definition.
OBJECTIVE Externally validate and assess the discriminatory capacities of an increase in SOFA
score by 2 or more points, 2 or more SIRS criteria, or a qSOFA score of 2 or more points for
outcomes among patients who are critically ill with suspected infection.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort analysis of 184 875 patients with
an infection-related primary admission diagnosis in 182 Australian and New Zealand intensive
care units (ICUs) from 2000 through 2015.
EXPOSURES SOFA, qSOFA, and SIRS criteria applied to data collected within 24 hours
of ICU admission.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. In-hospital
mortality or ICU length of stay (LOS) of 3 days or more was a composite secondary outcome.
Discrimination was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC). Adjusted analyses were performed using a model of baseline risk determined using
variables independent of the scoring systems.
RESULTS Among 184 875 patients (mean age, 62.9 years [SD, 17.4]; women, 82 540 [44.6%];
most common diagnosis bacterial pneumonia, 32 634 [17.7%]), a total of 34 578 patients
(18.7%) died in the hospital, and 102 976 patients (55.7%) died or experienced an ICU LOS of
3 days or more. SOFA score increased by 2 or more points in 90.1%; 86.7% manifested 2 or
more SIRS criteria, and 54.4% had a qSOFA score of 2 or more points. SOFA demonstrated
significantly greater discrimination for in-hospital mortality than SIRS criteria or qSOFA. SOFA
also outperformed the other scores for the secondary end point. Findings were consistent for
both outcomes in multiple sensitivity analyses.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adults with suspected infection admitted to an ICU,
an increase in SOFA score of 2 or more had greater prognostic accuracy for in-hospital
mortality than SIRS criteria or the qSOFA score. These findings suggest that SIRS criteria
and qSOFA may have limited utility for predicting mortality in an ICU setting.

S
epsis remains difficult to define1-4 but represents a sig-
nificant burden of disease. A recent meta-analysis esti-
mated its annual global incidence at 31.5 million cases,
with 19.4 million cases of severe sepsis, resulting in 5.3 mil-
liondeaths.5Ithasbeenrecognizedthatsurvivalfollowingsep-
sis is associated with long-term physical, cognitive, and psy-
chosocial morbidity,6 and an increased mortality rate up to 2
years after an event.7
Accurate diagnostic criteria and consensus definitions
have an important role in adult intensive care medicine, pro-
viding tools for research, benchmarking, performance moni-
toring, and accreditation.8 Seymour and colleagues9 pub-
lished data concerning the validity of a 2 or more–point
change in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure
Assessment (SOFA) score as a means of identifying sepsis
among patients who are critically ill with suspected infec-
tion, assuming a SOFA of 0 for patients not known to have
preexisting organ dysfunction. In addition, the concept of the
quick SOFA (qSOFA) score was introduced as a possible pre-
dictive tool among encounters with suspected infection out-
side the intensive care unit (ICU). These data were drawn
from North American cohorts and a single German cohort9
and have not been validated externally.
The primary aims of this study were to (1) assess the
effect of an increase in SOFA score of 2 or more points, 2 or
more systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
criteria, and a qSOFA score of 2 or more points measured
within the first 24 hours of admission in discriminating
in-hospital mortality or prolonged length of stay among
patients with suspected infection admitted to ICUs through-
out Australia and New Zealand and (2) to validate the use of
qSOFA in this setting.1,2,10
Methods
The Alfred Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee in
Melbourne, Australia, approved this study with a waiver of
informed consent.
Study Design and Population
A retrospective cohort study was performed using young
and older adult (aged ≥17 years) admissions with suspected
infection in the Australian and New Zealand Intensive
Care Society (ANZICS) Adult Patient Database. All patient
records between 2000 and 2015 were screened for study
inclusion. Repeat ICU admissions from the same hospital
episode and patients transferred to another ICU facility
whose eventual outcome was unknown were excluded.
Infection or suspected infection was then inferred from
infection-related ICU admission diagnoses according to the
ANZICS modification of the Acute Physiology and Chronic
Health Evaluation (APACHE) III scoring system,11 as used in
previous work.10,12
Data Extraction
The following data were extracted: demographic informa-
tion, indigenous status, ICU and hospital length of stay, vital
status at ICU and hospital discharge, physiological and labo-
ratory variables collected for calculation of APACHE II and III
scores, and the Australian and New Zealand Risk of Death
(ANZROD) prediction model.13,14 Serum lactate levels were
not available. SOFA scores (range, 0 [best] to 24 [worst]
points),4,15 SIRS status (range, 0 [best] to 4 [worst] criteria),1
and qSOFA scores (range, 0 [best] to 3 [worst] points)4,9 were
calculated using physiological and laboratory parameters
recorded from within the first 24 hours of ICU admission.
Standard criteria were applied, with a threshold of 2 or more
points being used with each scoring system. In keeping with
the Sepsis-3 consensus statement,4 a Glasgow Coma Scale
Score (range, 3 [worst] to 15 [best] points) of less than 15 was
used for estimation of the qSOFA score. In the primary analy-
sis, a baseline SOFA score of 0 was assumed for all patients.4
Where individual components of SIRS criteria, SOFA, and
qSOFA were missing, no contribution was made to the total
score (eg, equivalent to assigning 0 or imputing a normal
value). Where all components were unknown, the patient
was assigned a missing score, and excluded from the primary
analysis. In subsequent sensitivity analyses, 2 additional
approaches were employed: first, patients with known
chronic renal, liver, or respiratory dysfunction (defined per
APACHE II and III comorbidity codes13) were excluded, and
second, a baseline SOFA score of 4 was assigned for chronic
renal or hepatic dysfunction and a baseline score of 2 for
chronic respiratory impairment.
Outcomes
In accordance with Seymour et al,9 the primary study out-
come was in-hospital mortality with a composite secondary
outcome of in-hospital mortality or an ICU length of stay of
3 days or longer.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were performed using SAS (SAS Institute), ver-
sion 9.4. Group comparisons were conducted using χ2 tests for
equal proportions, t tests for normally distributed data, and
Wilcoxon rank sum tests otherwise. Discriminatory power was
Key Points
Question Does an increase of 2 or more points in Sequential
[Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score have
greater prognostic accuracy in patients who are critically ill
with suspected infection than 2 or more systemic inflammatory
response syndrome (SIRS) criteria or quick SOFA (qSOFA)
score points?
Findings In this retrospective cohort analysis that included
184 875 adults, SOFA (area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.753) demonstrated significantly
greater discrimination for in-hospital mortality than SIRS criteria
(AUROC, 0.589) or qSOFA (AUROC, 0.607).
Meaning Among patients admitted to the intensive care unit with
suspected infection, defining sepsis by an increase in SOFA score
provided greater prognostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality than
either SIRS criteria or qSOFA.

determined by comparing the area under the receiver operat-
ing characteristic curve (AUROC) for each score individually
(unadjusted analysis) and in conjunction with a baseline risk
model (adjusted analysis). Specific AUROC (99% CI) values
were generated, along with incremental improvement be-
tween the scores (99% CI).
Baseline risk models for in-hospital mortality and
in-hospital mortality or ICU stay of 3 or more days were cre-
ated using hierarchical logistic regression with patients
nested within sites and sites treated as a random variable.
Both models were constructed using all available informa-
tion at the time of ICU admission including factors relating
to the ICU (size, type, location, and admission source),
admission time (month, day, and hour) and patient (age,
sex, comorbidities, pregnancy, diabetes, indigenous status,
and treatment limitations) (eTables 1-2 in the Supplement).
Predictive validity was determined by dividing baseline risk
into deciles and comparing outcomes among patients with
an increase of 2 or more points (SOFA) or qSOFA and SIRS
criteria of 2 or more against patients with an increase of less
than 2 for SOFA score or qSOFA and SIRS criteria of less than
2 at each decile of risk.
Sensitivity analyses were performed for ventilation sta-
tus, multiple imputation to account for missing data, qSOFA
calculated using Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 14 for al-
tered mentation, the presence of chronic comorbidities, ad-
mission source, and improved baseline models that sequen-
tially include diagnosis and physiological variables (separate
to those used to calculate each of the candidate scores) col-
lected over the first 24 hours in the ICU. Agreement between
the SOFA score, SIRS criteria, and qSOFA score was deter-
mined using Cronbach α with 99% CIs generated with boot-
strapping (100 samples). To increase the robustness of the
analysis, a 2-sided P value of .01 was used to indicate statisti-
cal significance. Further details of the statistical analysis can
be found in the eAppendix of the Supplement.

Study Population
Data pertaining to 1 499 753 adult admissions were recorded
in the ANZICS Adult Patient Database for the period of 2000-
2015, drawn from 182 ICUs across Australia and New Zealand.
Following restriction to completed index ICU admissions and
selection of infection-related diagnoses,10,12 a final cohort of
184 875 cases were identified (eFigure 1 and eTable 3 in the
Supplement). As shown in Table 1 (also in eTable 3 of the
Supplement), mean age was 62.9 years (SD, 17.4), 55.4%
(n = 102 335) were male, and 44.6% (n = 82 540) were female.
Bacterial pneumonia was listed as the most common diagno-
sis among 32 634 patients (17.7%). There were 34 578 patients
(18.7%) who died in the hospital. The secondary outcome of
in-hospital mortality or length of stay in the ICU of 3 days or
more occurred in 102 976 patients (55.7%).
SOFA, SIRS, qSOFA, and Study Outcomes
Of the study cohort, 165 103 patients (90.1%) had an increase
of SOFA score from baseline of 2 or more; 158 710 patients
(86.7%) manifested 2 or more SIRS criteria, and 99 611 pa-
tients (54.4%) had a qSOFA score of 2 or more. The distribu-
tions of each score and their relationship with in-hospital mor-
tality are presented in Figure 1 and Figure 2.
The SOFA score could not be calculated in 1544 patients
(0.8%); SIRS status, 1901 patients (1.0%); qSOFA score, 1797
patients (1.0%). In-hospital mortality was 28.6%, 27.2% and
27.2% for each of these groups, respectively, for which com-
plete data were missing (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Score Discrimination
Discrimination of in-hospital mortality (Table 2) was sig-
nificantly higher using SOFA (AUROC, 0.753 [99% CI,
0.750-0.757]) than either SIRS criteria (AUROC, 0.589 [99% CI,
0.585-0.593]) or qSOFA (AUROC, 0.607 [99% CI, 0.603-

[99% CI, 0.142-0.151]; SOFA vs SIRS criteria, 0.164 [99% CI,
0.159-0.169]; qSOFA vs SIRS criteria, 0.018 [99% CI, 0.013-
0.023]; all P < .001) (Figure 3A). Similarly, when considered in
conjunction with baseline prediction of mortality, SOFA
(AUROC, 0.815 [99% CI, 0.811-0.818]) outperformed both SIRS
criteria (AUROC, 0.755 [99% CI, 0.752-0.759]) and qSOFA
(AUROC, 0.762 [99% CI, 0.758-0.765]) for discrimination of
hospital mortality (Figure 3B), with all incremental differ-
ences being statistically significant (between-group differ-
ence:SOFAvsSIRScriteria,0.047[99%CI,0.044-0.049];SOFA
vs qSOFA, 0.042 [99% CI, 0.040-0.044]; qSOFA vs SIRS cri-
teria, 0.005 [99% CI, 0.003-0.006]); all P < .001).
The superior discriminatory performance of SOFA over
bothSIRScriteriaandqSOFAwasfurthermaintainedwhencon-
sidering the secondary outcome of hospital mortality or ICU
length of stay of 3 or more days when considered in isolation
or in conjunction with the baseline prediction (Table 2,
Figure 3C, and Figure 3D).
Additional data showing calibration plots for observed
and expected outcomes are demonstrated in eFigure 3 and 4
of the Supplement. Full baseline risk models for in-hospital
mortality and for the secondary outcome of hospital mortal-
ity or ICU length of stay of 3 or more days are also provided in
eTables 1 and 2 of the Supplement.
Incremental Increase in Mortality Associated
With 2 or More Points or Criteria for Each Measurement
The in-hospital mortality of patients who had an increase
from baseline in SOFA score of 2 or more was 20.2% (33 365
of 165 103 patients) vs 4.4% (793 of 18 228 patients), P < .001
(between-group difference, 15.9% [99% CI, 15.4%-16.3%]);
for those who manifested 2 or more SIRS criteria, mortality
was 19.9% (31 648 of 158 710 patients) vs 9.8% (2387 of
24 264 patients), P < .001 (between-group difference, 10.1%
[99% CI, 9.5%-10.7%]); and for those who had a qSOFA score
of 2 or more, mortality was 22.8% (22 758 of 99 611 patients)
vs 13.6% (11 332 of 83 457 patients), P < .001 (between-group
difference, 9.3% [99% CI, 8.8%-9.7%]); when compared
with those with less than 2 points or criteria on each respec-
tive score.
Patients with an increase from baseline in SOFA score of
2 or more had a greater incremental increase in mortality

across all deciles of baseline risk, than patients with 2 or
more SIRS criteria, or those with a qSOFA score of 2 or more
(Table 3 and Figure 4A). The incremental increase in mortal-
ity when a patient had an increase in SOFA score of 2 or more
ranged from an odds ratio (OR) of 7.46 (99% CI, 4.01-13.89)
among those in the lowest baseline risk decile to an OR of
2.70 (99% CI, 2.14-3.42) among those in the highest decile.
This analysis was repeated with the composite second-
ary outcome (Table 3 and Figure 4B). Those with an increase
of SOFA score of 2 or more had a significantly greater incre-
mental increase in risk of the composite outcome of
in-hospital mortality or length of stay in the ICU of 3 or
more days, at all deciles of baseline risk, than patients who
manifested 2 or more SIRS criteria or those with a qSOFA
score of 2 or more points. The incremental increase in risk
of the composite secondary outcome when a patient had an
increase in SOFA score of 2 or more varied from an OR of
3.59 (99% CI, 3.15-4.10) among those in the lowest baseline

risk decile to an OR of 4.13 (99% CI, 3.38-5.03) among those
in the highest decile.
Sensitivity Analyses
A number of sensitivity analyses were performed, wherein the
AUROC over and above the baseline level for the primary out-
come (using each scoring system) was calculated in a range of
scenarios. These included (1) mechanically ventilated vs non-
ventilated patients, (2) using multiple imputation to account
formissingdata,(3)usingaGlasgowComaScalescorelessthan
14 vs less than 15 for calculation of qSOFA, (4) having patients
with chronic organ dysfunction either excluded or assigned a
given baseline SOFA score, (5) differing the ICU admission
source, and (6) using improved baseline models. In each case,
SOFA demonstrated superior discrimination compared with
SIRS criteria or qSOFA (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Key Findings
In comparison with SIRS criteria or a qSOFA score of 2 or more,
an increase in SOFA score of 2 or more within 24 hours of ICU
admission demonstrated superior prognostic accuracy for in-
hospital mortality and the composite outcome of in-hospital
mortality or ICU length of stay of 3 days or more among pa-
tients with suspected infection admitted to Australian and
New Zealand ICUs.

Relationship With Previous Studies
This study examined and compared the discriminatory capac-
ity of SOFA, SIRS criteria, and qSOFA in a large ICU popula-
tion of patients outside of the cohort used to develop the new
definition of sepsis. Kaukonen and colleagues10 have previ-
ously demonstrated that SIRS criteria are an imperfect predic-
tor of ICU mortality, inappropriately excluding otherwise simi-
lar patients with infection, organ failure, and increased
mortality. Furthermore, use of SIRS criteria failed to define a
transition point in risk of death, despite adjustment for base-
line characteristics.10
Conversely, SOFA scores have been demonstrated to be a
useful predictor of ICU mortality.15 Rivera-Fernández and
colleagues16 demonstrated that 28-day mortality was related
to mean and maximum daily SOFA scores in a cohort of pa-
tients who were critically ill with an AUROC of 0.95.16 The re-
lationshipbetweenSOFAscoresandriskofdeathhasbeencon-
firmed in a variety of subgroups14,16-18 including sepsis.9,15 In
the sepsis consensus definition, the ability of SOFA, SIRS cri-
teria, and qSOFA scores to discriminate in-hospital mortality
or prolonged ICU length of stay was determined in a cohort of
both ICU and non-ICU encounters with suspected infection.9
SOFA demonstrated significantly greater capacity compared
with qSOFA and SIRS criteria in the ICU cohort.9 This study
demonstrated findings consistent with these reports.
The mean age (63 years) in this study was similar to that
reported in the ICU validation cohort for the definition of sep-
sis by Seymour et al,9 as was the proportion of males (approxi-
mately 55%). In-hospital mortality in this study was margin-
allyhigher(19%inthisstudyvs16%inSeymouretal),although
roughly equal fractions manifested an increase in SOFA score
of 2 or more (90% in this study vs 91% in Seymour et al). Im-
portantly, this cohort was more than 11 times larger than the
total number of ICU encounters used by Seymour et al,9 and
was derived from multiple ICUs dispersed among 2 coun-
tries. The adjusted AUROCs for in-hospital mortality for SOFA
score, SIRS criteria, and qSOFA score in this ICU cohort were
substantially higher than previously reported,9 which was, in
part, likely a reflection of the strength of the baseline model
used in analysis.
Study Implications
Using a large binational database independent of the sepsis
consensus development cohorts, this study confirmed that

an increase in SOFA score of 2 or more points within the first
24 hours of ICU admission had superior prognostic accuracy
for mortality or ICU length of stay of 3 days or more com-
pared with SIRS criteria or qSOFA. It established that the use
of an increase in SOFA score of 2 or more points to define sep-
sis was an appropriate data-based starting point, and would
likely have broad external validity in ICU patients from devel-
oped countries. This study’
s findings confirmed that the SIRS
criteria provided no additional predictive use for mortality or
prolonged ICU length of stay beyond that achieved with
SOFA. Finally, this study confirmed that, as already sug-
gested in the consensus statement, the qSOFA score had little
additional predictive value over the SIRS criteria among
patients admitted to the ICU with suspected infection, and
that among these patients, the use of qSOFA may be low.
Strengths
This study had a number of strengths. It was based on one of
the largest complete ICU data sets, with a cohort of 184 875 in-
fection-related admissions over a 16-year period, encompass-
ing a wide geographical area. Moreover, due to the use of a pro-
spective, quality-surveillance data collection process, these
results were unlikely to be biased. This study used the pri-
mary diagnosis leading to ICU admission for patient selection
recorded in the ANZICS Adult Patient Database. This use of a
clinical diagnosis, rather than administrative coding data in-
creased the generalizability and applicability of the study’
s
findings.Thereportedpatientshadsimilarcharacteristics,sex,
age, and outcomes to those used by Seymour et al,9 for which
they provide an important external validation. This study was
further strengthened by the use of a reproducible identifica-
tion process for infection,10,12 and the use of the same meth-
odology as in the consensus paper.9 This study considered in-
hospital mortality as a primary end point, but also measured
a composite of in-hospital mortality or ICU length of stay of 3
days or more (as applied to the consensus definition), thus as-
sessing the discrimination for both of these outcomes for the
3 measures. Finally, these data had excellent internal valid-
ity, as evidenced by an in-hospital mortality rate (18.7%) that
is highly consistent with a recent multicenter study explor-
ing early goal-directed therapy for early septic shock con-
ducted in Australia and New Zealand.17
Limitations
The data used for this analysis were not primarily collected for
suchstudypurposes.SOFA,SIRScriteria,andqSOFAcouldonly
be studied for the first 24 hours in ICU. Biochemical and physi-
ological values could have come from any time within the first
24 hours of ICU admission and, as a result, could not be more
accurately linked to the timing of the diagnosis of infection.
The SOFA score used should be considered a modification of
the original because the cardiovascular component was esti-
matedwithoutknowledgeofinotropeorvasopressordose.The
incidence of nosocomial infections and of infections in pa-
tients admitted with another diagnosis were unknown.18 How-
ever, although this study could not comment specifically on
the applicability of these scores to patients who develop in-
fections later during their ICU stay, the consistency of find-
ings across multiple sensitivity analyses suggests that these
scores might have similar performance in all ICU patients. A
population at risk for sepsis could not be studied to assess the
diagnostic value of all 3 measures. Finally, this study did not
examine the non-ICU population. As a result, although the ad-
vantageoftheqSOFAscoreisitsbrevityanduseofclinicalvari-
ables only, its applicability to patients with suspected infec-
tionintherestofthehospital(onthewardsorintheEmergency
Department) could not be determined by this study.9,19-21
Conclusions
Among adults with suspected infection admitted to an ICU, an
increase in SOFA score of 2 or more points had greater prog-
nostic accuracy for in-hospital mortality than SIRS criteria or
qSOFA. These findings suggest that SIRS and qSOFA may have
limited use for predicting mortality in an ICU setting.
