Febrile seizures occurring in a child older than one month during an episode of fever affect 2% to 4% of children in Great Britain
and the United States and recur in 30%. Rapid-acting antiepileptics and antipyretics given during subsequent fever episodes have been
used to avoid the adverse effects of continuous antiepileptic drugs.
Objectives
To evaluate primarily the effectiveness and safety of antiepileptic and antipyretic drugs used prophylactically to treat children with
febrile seizures; but also to evaluate any other drug intervention where there was a sound biological rationale for its use.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2016, Issue 7); MEDLINE
(1966 to July 2016); Embase (1966 to July 2016); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness (DARE) (July 2016). We imposed
no language restrictions. We also contacted researchers in the field to identify continuing or unpublished studies.
Selection criteria
Trials using randomised or quasi-randomised participant allocation that compared the use of antiepileptic, antipyretic or other plausible
agents with each other, placebo or no treatment.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors (RN and MO) independently applied predefined criteria to select trials for inclusion and extracted the predefined
relevant data, recording methods for randomisation, blinding and exclusions. For the 2016 update a third author (MC) checked all
original inclusions, data analyses, and updated the search. Outcomes assessed were seizure recurrence at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months
and at age 5 to 6 years in the intervention and non-intervention groups, and adverse medication effects. We assessed the presence of
publication bias using funnel plots.

 Main results
We included 40 articles describing 30 randomised trials with 4256 randomised participants. We analysed 13 interventions of continuous
or intermittent prophylaxis and their control treatments. Methodological quality was moderate to poor in most studies. We found no
significant benefit for intermittent phenobarbitone, phenytoin, valproate, pyridoxine, ibuprofen or zinc sulfate versus placebo or no
treatment; nor for diclofenac versus placebo followed by ibuprofen, acetaminophen or placebo; nor for continuous phenobarbitone
versus diazepam, intermittent rectal diazepam versus intermittent valproate, or oral diazepam versus clobazam.
There was a significant reduction of recurrent febrile seizures with intermittent diazepam versus placebo or no treatment, with a risk
ratio (RR) of 0.64 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.85 at six months), RR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.84) at 12 months, RR
0.37 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.60) at 18 months, RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.95) at 24 months, RR 0.58 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.85) at 36
months, RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.15 to 0.89) at 48 months, with no benefit at 60 to 72 months. Phenobarbitone versus placebo or no
treatment reduced seizures at 6, 12 and 24 months but not at 18 or 72 month follow-up (RR 0.59 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.83) at 6 months;
RR 0.54 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.70) at 12 months; and RR 0.69 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.89) at 24 months). Intermittent clobazam compared
to placebo at six months resulted in a RR of 0.36 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.64), an effect found against an extremely high (83.3%) recurrence
rate in the controls, which is a result that needs replication.
The recording of adverse effects was variable. Lower comprehension scores in phenobarbitone-treated children were found in two
studies. In general, adverse effects were recorded in up to 30% of children in the phenobarbitone-treated group and in up to 36% in
benzodiazepine-treated groups. We found evidence of publication bias in the meta-analyses of comparisons for phenobarbitone versus
placebo (eight studies) at 12 months but not at six months (six studies); and valproate versus placebo (four studies) at 12 months, with
too few studies to identify publication bias for the other comparisons.
Most of the reviewed antiepileptic drug trials are of a methodological quality graded as low or very low. Methods of randomisation and
allocation concealment often do not meet current standards; and treatment versus no treatment is more commonly seen than treatment
versus placebo, leading to obvious risks of bias. Trials of antipyretics and zinc were of higher quality.
Authors’ conclusions
We found reduced recurrence rates for children with febrile seizures for intermittent diazepam and continuous phenobarbitone, with
adverse effects in up to 30%. Apparent benefit for clobazam treatment in one trial needs to be replicated to be judged reliable. Given
the benign nature of recurrent febrile seizures, and the high prevalence of adverse effects of these drugs, parents and families should be
supported with adequate contact details of medical services and information on recurrence, first aid management and, most importantly,
the benign nature of the phenomenon.

Prophylactic drug management for febrile seizures in children
Background
Seizures occurring with a fever in children are common and affect about one in thirty under the age of six years. On average, one out of
three children who have had a febrile seizure will have at least one more. We reviewed the evidence about the effect of drugs to prevent
seizures (antiepileptics), drugs to lower temperature (antipyretics) and zinc on children with febrile seizures.
Objective
We wanted to know in how many children these drugs would prevent a recurrence or bring unwanted effects.
Methods
We included 30 studies with a total of 4256 children in the review. Children who had had at least one febrile seizure were put into
groups who either had the study treatment or not. The studies recorded any further seizures at various time intervals between 6 months
and up to 6 years of age in each group. Unwanted medication effects were also noted.
Results
The quality of study design and evidence provided by these studies was often low or very low for the antiepileptic drugs. Poor methods
known to lead to obvious risks of bias were used. This was to do with the way children were put in each group and how random this

 allocation was. Other issues included whether the parents and/or doctors knew which group each child was in or perhaps if the study
was of treatment compared to no treatment. The quality of trials of antipyretics or zinc was better, with the evidence graded moderate
to high.
Zinc therapy gave no benefit. Nor was there benefit in treating children just at the time of the fever with either antipyretic drugs or
most antiepileptic drugs.
At times a significant result was noted. In statistics this means there was a less than 1 in 20 chance of this happening by chance. For
example, at times between 6 and 48 months follow-up, intermittent diazepam (an antiepileptic drug) led to a reduction in the number
of recurrent seizures by about a third. Continuous phenobarbitone resulted in significantly fewer recurrences at 6, 12 and 24 months,
but not at 18 and 60 to 72 months
However, as recurrent seizures are only seen in about a third of children anyway this means that up to 16 children would have to
be treated over a year or two to save just one child a further seizure. As febrile seizures are not harmful we viewed these significant
findings (in the statistical sense) to be unimportant. This is particularly so as adverse effects of the medications were common. Lower
comprehension scores in phenobarbitone-treated children were found in two studies. In general, adverse effects were recorded in up
to about a third of children in both the phenobarbitone and benzodiazepine-treated groups. The benefit found for treatment with
clobazam in one study published in 2011 needs to be repeated to show that this finding is reliable.
Author’s conclusions
Neither continuous nor intermittent treatment with zinc, antiepileptic or antipyretic drugs can be recommended for children with
febrile seizures. Febrile seizures can be frightening to witness. Parents and families should be supported with adequate contact details of
medical services and information on recurrence, first aid management and, most importantly, the benign nature of the phenomenon.
The evidence is current to 21 July 2016.

Description of the condition
The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defines a febrile
seizure as “a seizure occurring in childhood after one month of
age associated with a febrile illness not caused by an infection of
the central nervous system, without previous neonatal seizures or
a previous unprovoked seizure, and not meeting the criteria for
other acute symptomatic seizures” (ILEA 1993). The cumulative
incidence of febrile seizures is estimated between 2% and 5% in
the US and Western Europe, (Shinnar 2003; Verity 1991) between
6% to 9% in Japan, and 14% in India and Guam (ILEA 1993).
Febrile seizures have a peak incidence at 18 months and are most
common between the ages of six months and six years. (Berg 1996;
Hauser 1994; Offringa 1991)
In 2010 the ILAE proposed that febrile seizures could be organised
by typical age at onset (that is, infancy and childhood). Conven-
tionally, febrile seizures have been classified as simple or complex
based on duration, recurrence during the same illness episode, and
the presence of focal features. Most febrile seizures are generalised
tonic-clonic seizures, and about 30% - 35% of febrile seizures have
one or more complex features (focal onset, duration > 10 min-
utes, or multiple seizures during the illness episode) (Berg 1996).
Febrile status epilepticus, a subgroup of complex febrile seizures
with seizures lasting more than 30 minutes, occur in about 5% of
cases (Berg 1996).
Causation is thought to be multifactorial with environmental fac-
tors and increasing evidence for genetic factors contributing to
pathogenesis (Audenaert 2006; Offringa 1994). No single suscep-
tibility gene for febrile seizures is known. In contrast, gene iden-
tification has been successful in families with genetic epilepsies
with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) where kindreds may well in-
clude children with Dravet syndrome (Berg 2010; Kasperaviciute
2013; Tang 2013). In these conditions febrile seizures persist be-
yond the age of six years; mutations have been found in SCN1A
and SCN1B (both sodium channel genes important for neuro-
transmission) and GABRG2 (related to γ -aminobutyric acid, an
important inhibitory neurotransmitter) (Audenaert 2006; Baulac
2004; Gérard 2002; Hirose 2003; Johnson 1998, Kananura 2002,
Nabbout 2002; Nakayama 2006).
Description of the intervention
Despite the frequent nature of these seizures, debate regarding the
optimal management arose at an early stage (Baumann 1999) and
continues. After resolution of the acute episode, the possibility of
recurrent seizures during subsequent febrile illnesses must be ad-
dressed. This risk of recurrent seizures in previously healthy, un-
treated children was estimated in a collaborative study that used
the individual data from five follow-up studies with similar defini-
tions of febrile seizures and risk factors (Offringa 1994). Of 2496
children with 1410 episodes of recurrent seizures in this study,
32% had at least one, 15% had at least two and 7% had three
or more recurrent seizures after a first febrile seizure. The hazard
of recurrent seizures was highest between the ages of 12 and 24
months. A historyof febrile orunprovokedseizuresinafirst-degree
family member, a relatively low temperature at the first seizure,
young age at onset (< 12 months), a family history of unprovoked
seizures, and a partial initial febrile seizure were all associated with
an increased risk of subsequent seizures.
If a child is considered at increased risk of frequent or complicated
seizures (Berg 1990), prophylactic medication might be consid-
ered. However, such treatment may have adverse effects on the
child’s behaviour and cognitive development. Thus, the decision
to treat requires assessment of the potential risks and benefits to
the child. Since 1990, at least 300 articles have been published
on the drug management of seizures associated with fever (Gram
1984). This has long been a controversial area, with a persistent
variety of opinions on management. Part of this controversy re-
flects the fact that it is uncertain whether prophylactic medication
with antiepileptics and antipyretics is effective and has no impor-
tant adverse effects. Yet, phenobarbital has adverse effects such as
irritability, hyperactivity, and somnolence, and may even lower
the cognitive development of the toddlers (Farwell 1990; Herranz
1988). To avoid the side effects of continuous antiepileptic drugs
(AEDs), rapid-acting antiepileptics given only during fever peri-
ods have been used in an attempt to reduce the risk of recurrent
febrile seizures. Phenobarbital at times of fever has been proven
ineffective, probably because of the delay in achieving appropri-
ate serum and tissue levels. Thus far, only prophylactic diazepam,
given orally or rectally, has been studied in placebo-controlled
trials. The efficacy of intermittent antipyretic treatment during
febrile episodes in the prevention of seizure recurrence has recently
been studied.
Newton 1988 assessed the efficacy of phenobarbitone and val-
proate for the prophylactic treatment of febrile seizures by sum-
marising the results from all eight British placebo-controlled clin-
ical trials that were done before 1988. Data were pooled and anal-
ysed on an intention-to-treat basis. The overall odds ratio of recur-
rent febrile seizures for phenobarbitone was 0.8 and for valproate
1.42; neither result was statistically significant. The author there-
fore concluded that neither treatment is to be recommended. A
second meta-analysis summarised four published non-British ran-
domised, placebo-controlled trials that had been done up to 1996
using phenobarbital as a preventive treatment of febrile seizures
(Rantala 1997). The risk of recurrences was lower in children
receiving continuous phenobarbital therapy than in the placebo
group (odds ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to
0.90). On average, eight children would have to be treated with
phenobarbital for two years continuously to prevent one febrile
seizure (number needed to treat (NNT) 8, 95% CI 5 to 27)

 (Rantala 1997).
How the intervention might work
The rationale for using prophylactic antiepileptic drugs in chil-
dren with febrile seizures is to raise seizure threshold in the face of
a potentially triggering fever. Antipyretics are used to attenuate the
effect of fever as a triggering factor. Previous studies demonstrated
blood and cerebrospinal fluid zinc levels to be significantly lower
in children with a febrile seizure tendency than in children with
afebrile seizures. Zinc level is known to stimulate the excitatory
neurotransmitter glutamate and to increase the inhibitory neuro-
transmitter gamma-amino-butyric acid.
Why it is important to do this review
We undertook this review to answer the question whether pro-
phylactic treatment with an antiepileptic drug or an antipyretic
can, as compared to no therapy, decrease the likelihood of future
febrile seizures in children with febrile seizures.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included all trials using randomised or quasi-randomised par-
ticipant allocation that compared the use of antiepileptic or an-
tipyretic agents with each other or with placebo or with no treat-
ment.
Types of participants
Children aged between six months and seven years with a history
of febrile seizures and who received treatment with an antiepilep-
tic drug or an antipyretic drug in an attempt to prevent recur-
rent seizures. We also planned subgroup analyses of neurologically
healthy children, of children with previous recurrent seizures, and
of studies limited to children at a perceived relatively high risk of
recurrence.
Types of interventions
We included trials if they compared one treatment with an-
other or with placebo (or no treatment) in children with febrile
seizures. Specific drugs included the benzodiazepines (diazepam,
lorazepam, clobazam and midazolam), phenytoin, phenobarbi-
tone, valproate, diclofenac, acetaminophen and ibuprofen. We
planned a subgroup analysis of intermittent AED therapies versus
continuous AED therapies, and of antipyretics during episodes
of fever versus AED therapy during fever. A six-month course of
zinc (shown previously to have been significantly lower in children
with febrile seizures) was evaluated in one study.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
Efficacy - proportion of children with recurrence of febrile or
non-febrile seizures at certain time points after treatment onset (6
months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months, and at age five years).
Secondary outcomes
1) Treatment adherence (as measured in the studies).
2) Safety: the incidence of specific adverse unwanted effects, in-
cluding irritability, hyperactivity, somnolence, impaired cognitive
development for phenobarbital and intermittent diazepam, gas-
tro-enterologic unwanted effects for valproate and antipyretics, of
any administered antiepileptic or antipyretic.
3) As it is of clinical interest, we analysed pooled data at the chosen
study time points to estimate the recurrent febrile seizure risk in
the placebo and no-treatment groups. This analysis could provide
a useful insight into the natural history of the disorder.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched the following databases. We imposed no language
restrictions.

Details of the search strategies used are outlined in Appendix 1.
Searching other resources
We checked the reference lists of articles identified by the above
searches for additional studies. We also contacted researchers in
the field to find any ongoing or unpublished studies.

 Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (RN and MO) independently assessed trials
for inclusion, resolving any disagreements by discussion. For the
2016 update, a third review author (MC) checked all original
inclusions.
Data extraction and management
Two review authors (RN and MO) extracted the outcome data
specified above as well as the following data, resolving any dis-
agreements by discussion. For the 2016 update a third review au-
thor (MC) checked all data extracted.
Methodological and trial design:
a. method of randomisation;
b. method of double blinding;
c. whether any participants had been excluded from the reported
analyses.
Where data were missing, we tried to contact original authors for
this information.
Participant and demographic information:
a. total number of participants allocated to each treatment group
or audited in any protocol;
b. the proportion of participants in each treatment group with
a recurrence at certain time points (6 months, 12 months, 24
months, 36 months, 48 months and 72 months, where these data
were available);
c. risk factors associated with recurrent seizures, i.e. age at first
seizure below 18 months, positive family history of seizures, tem-
perature at index seizure below 40.0 °C.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Review author MC made an initial assessment of all included stud-
ies for risk of bias using the Cochrane ’Risk of bias’ tool for RCTs (
Higgins 2011). This was compared to an independent assessment
by either review author RN or MO, with a third party resolving
any disagreements by discussion.
Measures of treatment effect
We treated efficacy (recurrence of febrile or non-febrile seizures)
as dichotomous outcomes and expressed them as risk ratios (RR)
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
We summarised treatment adherence and incidence of adverse ef-
fects narratively according to the definitions reported in the study.
We calculated numbers needed to treat (NNTs) as the reciprocal
of the absolute risk reduction (McQuay 1998).
Unit of analysis issues
We did not have any unit of analysis issues. Medication dosages
were standard. Outcome measures were simply seizure recurrence.
No studies were of a repeated measure (longitudinal) nature or of
a cross-over design.
Dealing with missing data
At times recurrence data had to be reconstructed from published
survival curves. We were careful to cross-check this with quoted
cumulative incidence rates for in-study data. We cross-checked
trial details against any additional published report of the trial and
contacted original trial authors if we found missing data, errors or
inconsistencies (although the response was uniformly poor). No
author provided individual patient data (IPD) when requested but
we are satisfied with the consistency checks we performed.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed clinical heterogeneity by reviewing the differences
across trials in the characteristics of recruited participants and
treatment protocols. We assessed statistical heterogeneity using a
Chi2 test for heterogeneity. We assessed heterogeneity using the
Q test (P < 0.10 for significance) and the I² statistic (greater than
50% indicating considerable heterogeneity (Higgins 2003)) and
visually by inspecting forest plots.
Assessment of reporting biases
We assessed the presence of publication bias using funnel plots for
each meta-analysis that included results of five or more studies.
Data synthesis
We included studies comparing either different drugs or different
treatment approaches, for example intermittent AED therapies
versus continuous AED therapies, antipyretics during episodes
of fever versus AED therapy during fever, or all versus placebo.
The primary analysis was intention-to-treat and included all ran-
domised participants analysed in the treatment group to which
they were allocated, irrespective of which treatment they actually
received.
We conducted meta-analysis if sufficient data were available, that
is at least two trials looking at the same two treatments and the
same outcomes. All meta-analyses were conducted using a fixed-
effects model, regardless of the presence of heterogeneity. If we
had concerns regarding variability of study design and whether
pooling data was appropriate, meta-analysis would not have been
conducted.
We conducted meta-analysis only for the primary outcome of ef-
ficacy (recurrence of febrile or non-febrile seizures).
We summarised treatment adherence and incidence of adverse ef-
fects narratively according to the definitions reported in the study;
8

 we did not pool numerical data for these outcomes, due to vari-
ability in definitions and the level of detail reported in the studies.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We had no hypotheses needing subgroup analyses.
Sensitivity analysis
We felt no need for any sensitivity analyses as misdiagnosis of
febrile seizures or their recurrence is unlikely within the reported
study groups.
Summary of Findings and Quality of the Evidence
(GRADE)
In a post hoc change from protocol, we present 13 ’Summary of
findings’ tables (Summary of findings for the main comparison;
Summary of findings 2; Summary of findings 3; Summary of
findings 4; Summary of findings 5; Summary of findings 6;
Summary of findings 7; Summary of findings 8; Summary of
findings 9; Summary of findings 10; Summary of findings 11;
Summary of findings 12; Summary of findings 13); one for each
comparison of the review.
The primary outcome of efficacy (recurrence of febrile or non-
febrile seizures) was reported in all tables at the following time
points: 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months,
48 months, 60 or more months.
We determined the quality of the evidence by using the GRADE
approach, where evidence was downgraded in the presence of a
high risk of bias in at least one study, indirectness of the evidence,
unexplained heterogeneity or inconsistency, imprecision of results,
high probability of publication bias. Evidence is downgraded once
if the limitation is considered to be serious and twice if very serious.

1980; Williams 1979), continuous oral pyridoxine in one study
(McKiernan 1981), intermittent oral ibuprofen in one study (Van
Stuijvenberg 1998), intermittent oral clobazam in one study (Bajaj
2005); continuous zinc sulfate for six months in one study (Fallah
2015); and intermittent rectal diclofenac versus placebo followed
after eight hours by either ibuprofen or acetaminophen or placebo
in one study (Strengell 2009). Other studies compared interven-
tionsagainsteach other: continuousphenobarbitone andintermit-
tent diazepam in two studies (Garcia 1984; Salehiomran 2016);
intermittent rectal diazepam and intermittent rectal valproate in
one study (Daugbjerg 1990); and a comparison between intermit-
tent oral diazepam and intermittent oral clobazam in two studies
(Ghazavi 2016; Khosroshahi 2011).
These studies enrolled 4361 participants with febrile seizures
among whom 4256 were used in the analysis of this review. The
number of participants analysed for each intervention (number
of participants included in placebo trials only) was as follows: di-
azepam 1476 (771); continuous phenobarbitone 1075 (494); in-
termittent phenobarbitone 341 (32); phenytoin 90 (90); valproate
303 (48); pyridoxine 107 (107); ibuprofen 230 (230); clobazam
60 (60); zinc sulfate 100 (100); diclofenac versus placebo fol-
lowed after eight hours by ibuprofen, acetaminophen or placebo
231 (231); continuous phenobarbitone versus diazepam 245; di-
azepam versus valproate 169; diazepam versus clobazam 143. It
should be noted that a number of these papers included a compar-
ison of outcomes in placebo versus one of two randomised seizure
treatments (that is A versus C; B versus C). As no pooled anal-
yses were done in which the effects of different antiepileptic or
antipyretic drugs were summarised and compared with (placebo)
controls, we did not introduce unit-of-analysis errors. Families
withdrew from these studies for various reasons, including change
of residence, withdrawal of consent, and a variety of unacceptable
adverse effects detailed in so far as was possible in the additional
table ’Unwanted medication effects’ (Table 1).
Study outcomes included a comparison of observed and ex-
pected seizure recurrence frequency at time points ranging be-
tween six and 48 months after randomisation, and in one case
(Ramakrishnan 1986) at 60 to 72 months.

 A brief description of the 30 original studies reported in the
articles included in this review:
1. Autret 1990 was a study of 185 children, aged 8 to 36
months, after their first febrile seizure and with fewer than two
risk factors for recurrence. Interventions were intermittent oral
diazepam (0.5 mg load and 0.2 mg/kg maintenance) or placebo.
Outcomes assessed were recurrent seizures at 12 months after
randomisation and adverse medication effects during the 12
months of treatment.
2. Bacon 1981 reported a study involving 270 children
following a first febrile seizure. There were three arms to this
study. Children were allocated either to treatment with
continuous oral phenytoin 8 mg/kg/day, continuous
phenobarbitone 5 mg/kg/day, or placebo and followed for
assessment of recurrent seizures at 12 months after
randomisation and adverse medication effects during the 12
months of treatment.
3. Bajaj 2005 studied 60 children aged six months to five years
presenting with one or more febrile seizures. Children were
allocated to intermittent oral clobazam (0.75 mg/kg body weight
twice daily) or placebo during the course of fever and followed
for assessment of recurrent seizures at six months after
randomisation and adverse medication effects during the six
months of treatment.
4. Camfield 1980 was a study of 79 children aged 6 to 36
months following a first febrile seizure. Children were allocated
either to treatment with continuous phenobarbitone 4 to 5 mg/
kg/day or placebo (both groups treated with antipyretics) and
followed for assessment of recurrent seizures at 12 months after
randomisation. In their second paper, the authors assessed the
adverse effects of phenobarbitone in toddlers, including
behavioural and cognitive aspects, during the 12 months of
treatment using the same cohort.
5. Daugbjerg 1990 studied 169 children following a first
febrile seizure. Children were allocated either to intermittent
rectal diazepam (5 mg for those younger than three years or 7.5
mg for those three years or over) or intermittent valproate
suppositories (150 mg for those weighing less than 10 kg or 300
mg for those weighing 10 kg of more). They were followed for
assessment of recurrent seizures at six and 12 months after
randomisation and adverse medication effects during 12 months
of treatment.
6. Fallah 2015 was a randomised single-blind clinical study
comparing zinc sulfate with placebo. One hundred children,
aged 1½ to 5 years, with a first simple febrile seizure, with weight
and height above the third percentile and with normal serum
zinc levels, were randomised to either daily zinc sulfate 2 mg/kg
(maximum 50 mg) for six consecutive months or to placebo.
Authors assessed seizure recurrence at 12 months and unwanted
effects.
7. Farwell 1990 was a study of 217 children following a first
febrile seizure and who had at least one risk factor for recurrence.
They were allocated either to treatment with continuous
phenobarbitone 4 to 5 mg/kg/day or placebo, and followed for
assessment of recurrent seizures at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after
randomisation; and adverse medication effects after 24 months
of treatment. Sleep disturbances were reported in a second paper
and late cognitive effects of phenobarbital for this study in a
third publication.
8. Garcia 1984 studied 100 children aged six to 60 months
following a first febrile seizure (simple or complex) with random
allocation either to intermittent rectal diazepam (0.5 mg/kg/dose
eight-hourly for the duration of the fever) or continuous
phenobarbitone (5 mg/kg/day) plus antipyretics for both group.
Children were followed for assessment of recurrent seizures at 18
months after randomisation and adverse medication effects
during these 18 months of treatment.
9. Ghazavi 2016 was an open-label trial that randomised
children (six to 60 months of age) who presented with at least
one simple febrile seizure. They were treated with either oral
diazepam 0.33 mg/kg every eight hours for two days or oral
clobazam for two days dosed by participant’s weight (daily 5 mg
when weight ≤ 5 kg, twice daily 5 mg when 6 to 10 kg, twice
daily 7.5 mg when 11 to 15 kg, and twice daily 10 mg when >
15 kg). In a follow-up period of 12 months, authors assessed
seizure recurrence and adverse effects.
10. Heckmatt 1976 was a study of 165 children with a mean
age of 20 months following a first febrile seizure. They were
allocated either to treatment with continuous phenobarbitone 4
to 5 mg/kg/day or no treatment. The children were followed for
assessment of recurrent seizures at six months after
randomisation and adverse medication effects during the six
months of treatment.
11. Khosroshahi 2011 studied 80 children aged six months to
five years who had had one or more simple febrile seizures. They
were allocated either to intermittent oral diazepam (0.33 mg/kg/
dose every eight hours for two days) or intermittent oral
clobazam for two days with the following dosages: 5 mg daily in
children up to 5 kg; 5 mg twice daily in children six to 10 kg; 7.5
mg twice daily in children 11 to 15 kg; and 10 mg twice daily in
children > 15 kg. Children were followed for assessment of
recurrent seizures at 12 months after randomisation, and adverse
medication effects during these 12 months of treatment.
12. Knudsen 1985 reported on a single study of 289 children
following their first febrile seizure, allocated either to
intermittent rectal diazepam (5 mg for children less than three
years or 7.5 mg for those aged over three years) compared to no
treatment. They were followed for assessment of recurrent
seizures at 6, 12, and 18 months after randomisation and adverse
medication effects during 18 months of treatment.
13. Mackintosh 1970 was a study of 32 children aged six to 16
months who had had a first febrile seizure. They were allocated
either to intermittent phenobarbitone at 30 mg with acetyl acetic
acid 150 mg or placebo and followed for assessment of recurrent

 seizures at six and 12 months after randomisation; adverse
medication effects were not addressed.
14. Mamelle 1984 reported on one study of 69 children aged
six to 48 months following a first febrile seizure (excluding those
with focal seizures or neuropsychiatric disorders). These were
allocated either to treatment with continuous phenobarbitone 3
to 4 mg/kg/day, continuous oral valproate 30 to 40 mg/kg/day,
or placebo, and followed for assessment of recurrent seizures at
18 months after randomisation; adverse medication effects were
not addressed.
15. McKiernan 1981 studied 107 children aged six to 52
months who had had a first or second febrile seizure. Children in
the active treatment arm received continuous oral pyridoxine (in
two doses of 20 mg) or placebo. They were followed for
assessment of recurrent seizures for 12 months after
randomisation. We used estimates from the reported Kaplan
Meier curves to assess recurrent seizures at six and 12 months.
Adverse medication effects were not addressed.
16. McKinlay 1989 was a study of 151 children aged six to 72
months who had had at least one previous febrile seizure or a
complicated febrile seizure. There were three arms to this study.
Children were allocated either to treatment with continuous
phenobarbitone 5 mg/kg/day, continuous oral valproate 30 mg/
kg/day or no treatment and followed for assessment of recurrent
seizures at 6, 12, and 24 months after randomisation, and
adverse medication effects during the 24 months of treatment.
17. Mosquera 1987 studied 69 children following a first febrile
seizure and allocated to intermittent rectal diazepam 0.5 mg/kg/
dose, continuous oral valproate 30 mg/kg/day or no treatment.
Children were followed for assessment of recurrent seizures at 6,
12, and 24 months after randomisation; adverse medication
effects were not addressed.
18. Ngwane 1980 was a study of 64 children aged six to 18
months following a first febrile seizure. There were three arms to
this study with allocation either to phenobarbitone 3 to 6 mg/
kg/day or valproate 30 to 60 mg/kg/day. Patients that were
eligible but not included were consider the control group
receiving no treatment. Children were followed for a mean of 12
months after randomisation to assess recurrent seizures and
adverse medication effects.
19. Pavlidou 2006 studied 139 children aged six to 36 months
that were randomly assigned in a prospective controlled trial to
receive either intermittent prophylaxis with rectal diazepam or
no prophylaxis. The children were followed for assessment of
recurrent seizures at 6, 12, and 36 months after randomisation
and adverse medication effects during 36 months of treatment.
20. Ramakrishnan 1986 studied 120 children aged two to 72
months following a first febrile seizure. These children were
allocated to continuous phenobarbitone 3 to 5 mg/kg/day,
intermittent phenobarbitone in the same dosage, intermittent
oral diazepam 0.6 mg/kg/day or no treatment. They were
followed for assessment of recurrent seizures at 60 to 72 months
after randomisation and adverse medication effects during the
period of treatment.
21. Rosman 1993 studied 406 children aged six to 60 months
who had had at least one febrile seizure. The interventions were
intermittent oral diazepam 1 mg/kg/day or placebo. Outcomes
were recurrent seizures and adverse treatment effects during 24
months of treatment. We used estimates from the reported
Kaplan Meier curves to assess recurrent seizures at 6, 12, and 24
months.
22. Salehiomran 2016 studied 145 children (six to 60 months
of age) with ≥ 3 simple febrile seizures or with complex febrile
seizure in a randomised controlled trial. Included participants
were either treated with continuous phenobarbitone 3 to 5 mg/
kg/day in two doses for at least a year, or intermittent oral
diazepam 0.33 mg/kg/ three times a day for two days at each
febrile episode. Seizure recurrence was assessed at 12 months, as
were adverse effects.
23. Strengell 2009 was a study of 231 children aged four
months to four years who had had a first febrile seizure. All
febrile episodes during follow-up were treated first with either
intermittent rectal diclofenac or placebo. After eight hours,
treatment was continued with oral ibuprofen 5 mg/kg up to four
times a day, oral acetaminophen 10 mg/kg up to four times a
day, or placebo. Children were followed for assessment of
recurrent seizures. We used estimates from the reported Kaplan
Meier curves to assess recurrent seizures at 6, 12, 18, and 24
months. Adverse medication effects were not addressed.
24. Taghdiri 2011 studied 80 children, aged nine months to
five years after their first febrile seizure, and treated them with
either rectal diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) combined with
acetaminophen or acetaminophen only. Children were followed
for 12 months for assessment of recurrence.
25. Thilothammal 1993 studied 60 children aged six to 72
months following a first febrile seizure and allocated either to
treatment with continuous phenobarbitone 5 mg/kg/day or
placebo. An additional 30 children with an atypical seizure were
not randomised but treated with phenobarbitone (not included
in our analyses). The children were then followed for assessment
of recurrent seizures at six and 12 months and for adverse
medication effects after six and 12 months of treatment.
26. Uhari 1995 studied 180 children following a first febrile
seizure and allocated to intermittent rectal followed by
intermittent oral diazepam 0.6 mg/kg or placebo. Both groups
were treated with antipyretics for the duration of the fever. They
were followed for assessment of recurrent seizures and adverse
medication effects for 24 months. Kaplan Meier curves were
used to assess recurrence at six and 12 months.
27. Van Stuijvenberg 1998 studied 230 children aged 12 to 48
months who had a febrile seizure and at least one risk factor for
recurrence. Children were allocated either to intermittent oral
Ibuprofen 5 mg/kg/day or placebo and followed for assessment
of recurrent seizures during 24 months after randomisation. We
11

 used estimates from the reported Kaplan Meier curves to assess
recurrent seizures at 6, 12, and 24 months after randomisation;
adverse medication effects were not addressed.
28. Verrotti 2004 studied 110 children aged six months to five
years with one simple febrile seizure; 45 children were ’randomly’
allocated to treatment with intermittent oral diazepam (0.35 mg/
kg every eight hours) during each episode of fever higher than
38.8 °C, continuing until the child had been afebrile for 24
hours; and 65 children were allocated to a group with no
treatment. They were followed for assessment of recurrent
seizures at 48 months after randomisation and adverse
medication effects during the 48 months of treatment. We used
estimates from the reported Kaplan Meier curves to assess
recurrent seizures at 6, 12, and 24 months after randomisation.
29. Williams 1979 studied 58 children aged six to 72 months
after two or more simple febrile seizures. Children in the active
treatment group were allocated to continuous oral valproate 40
mg/kg/day and were compared with children on no treatment.
They were followed for assessment of recurrent seizures and
adverse medication effects at 12 months after randomisation.
30. Wolf 1977 was a study of 355 children aged six to 48
months who had had a first febrile seizure. There were three arms
to this study. Children were allocated either to continuous
phenobarbitone 3 to 4 mg/kg/day, intermittent phenobarbitone
5 mg/kg/day or no treatment. They were followed for assessment
of recurrent seizures for a median of 28 months after
randomisation and adverse medication effects during 24 months
of treatment. We used estimates from the reported Kaplan Meier
curves to assess recurrent seizures at 6, 12, and 24 months after
randomisation. In a following paper, the authors reported
behaviour disturbances and the long-term effect of phenobarbital
on cognitive function.
Excluded studies
We excluded all studies which were not RCTs. Some trials con-
fined the analysis to participants completing the trial period free of
unwanted effects, in which case we had no access to the outcome
of those who stopped treatment early when they could not tolerate
it. As we felt that the lack of intention-to-treat data introduced
an important potential for bias, we excluded these trials. One trial
of antipyretics did not address the central issue of febrile seizure
recurrence but researched the question of effect on temperature,
and was also excluded.
Risk of bias in included studies
Allocation
Satisfactory allocation concealment was noted in 10 of the
30 included studies (Autret 1990; Fallah 2015; Farwell 1990;
Mackintosh 1970; McKiernan 1981; Rosman 1993; Strengell
2009; Uhari 1995; Van Stuijvenberg 1998; Verrotti 2004); no
concealment was attempted in 13 of the 30 included studies
(Daugbjerg 1990; Garcia 1984; Heckmatt 1976; Khosroshahi
2011; Knudsen 1985; Mamelle 1984; McKinlay 1989; Mosquera
1987; Ngwane 1980; Pavlidou 2006; Taghdiri 2011; Williams
1979; Wolf 1977), which used a method of quasi-randomisation.
In the remainder of the studies the method of allocation conceal-
ment, if any, was unclear.
Blinding
Eleven studies were double-blinded (Autret 1990; Bajaj 2005;
Camfield 1980; Farwell 1990; Mackintosh 1970; McKiernan
1981; Rosman 1993; Strengell 2009; Thilothammal 1993; Uhari
1995; Van Stuijvenberg 1998); two studies were single-blinded
(Fallah 2015; Mamelle 1984); and there was no blinding in 17
studies (Bacon 1981; Daugbjerg 1990; Garcia 1984; Ghazavi
2016; Heckmatt 1976; Khosroshahi 2011; Knudsen 1985;
McKinlay 1989; Mosquera 1987; Ngwane 1980; Pavlidou 2006;
Ramakrishnan 1986; Salehiomran 2016; Taghdiri 2011; Verrotti
2004; Williams 1979; Wolf 1977).
Incomplete outcome data
In many studies the data analysis did not include all enrolled par-
ticipants as follows: Autret 1990: nine of 185 included children
were lost in the analyses - six on diazepam, three on placebo; Bacon
1981: 69 of 270 enrolled participants lost - unsure of group allo-
cation but study groups similar in size - i.e. 48 on phenobarbitone,
47 on phenytoin and 43 on placebo with no recurrences in any to
the time of withdrawal; Camfield 1980: two of 79 lost - one on
phenobarbitone, one onplacebo; Daugbjerg 1990: twowithdrawn
and four in each group lost to follow-up; Farwell 1990: 26 of 217
lost - 10 on phenobarbitone and 16 on placebo; Heckmatt 1976:
four of 165 lost - two on phenobarbitone, two on no treatment;
Khosroshahi 2011: eight of 80 lost - five on clobazam and three
on diazepam; Knudsen 1985: 16 of 289 lost - five on diazepam
and 11 on no treatment; Mamelle 1984: four of 69 lost - one on
valproate, two on phenobarbitone and one on placebo; Mosquera
1987: four of 69 lost - all four on placebo. It must be noted that
most of the included studies were undertaken 20 to 30 years ago,
since when the rigour of conducting and reporting RCTs has im-
proved. We attempted to contact study authors to obtain IPD, but
without success.
Selective reporting
Protocols were not available for any of the included trials. We made
a judgement of the risk of bias based on the information included
in the publications (see Characteristics of included studies and
’Summary of findings’ tables for more information).

 Other potential sources of bias
Study population sizes varied from 32 to 406. These were as-
sociated with numbers in one treatment arm ranging from 16
(Mackintosh 1970) up to 204 (Rosman 1993). The smaller studies
were prone to distortion of treatment effect because of the small
numbers of participants.
Publication bias
Four of the 38 analyses included results from more than five trials
(Analysis 1.1, Analysis 1.2, Analysis 2.1, Analysis 2.2). For these
analyses, we assessed publication bias with funnel plots. We did
not find evidence of publication bias for Analysis 1.1, Analysis 1.2
and Analysis 2.1 (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3), but we did find
evidence of publication bias for Analysis 2.2 (asymmetry indicated
in Figure 4). There were too few studies to comment on whether
there was publication bias for the other comparisons.

We describe the results of 13 comparisons, followed by a descrip-

tion groups and the occurrence of adverse medication effects.
1. Intermittent oral or rectal diazepam versus placebo or no
treatment (see Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.2; Analysis 1.3; Analysis
1.4; Analysis 1.5; Analysis 1.6; Analysis 1.7)
Nine trials compared oral or rectal diazepam versus placebo or
no treatment. (Autret 1990; Knudsen 1985; Mosquera 1987;
Pavlidou 2006 Ramakrishnan 1986; Rosman 1993; Taghdiri
2011; Uhari 1995; Verrotti 2004).
In three trials (Autret 1990; Rosman 1993; Uhari 1995) the con-
trol group received placebos and in the remaining six the controls
received no treatment. Most trials assessed recurrence at 6 (6 tri-
als), 12 (8 trials) and 24 months (4 trials), recurrence at 18, 36,
48 and 60 to 72 was only assessed by one trial each.
All trials included participants with a first febrile seizure (FS), ex-
cept Rosman 1993 (≥ 1 FS) and Taghdiri 2011 (all FSs), and some
16

 included only participants with simple febrile seizures (Autret
1990; Verrotti 2004). This analysis contains two treatment sub-
groups (diazepam given orally or rectally), but within each sub-
group some treatment differences existed. First, the oral diazepam
subgroup: In Autret 1990 diazepam was administered in a 0.5 mg/
kg load with a maintenance dose during the febrile period of 0.2
mg/kg/day. Rosman 1993 used a slightly higher dose, of 1 mg/
kg/day. Verrotti 2004 used 0.35 mg/kg every eight hours during
each episode of fever higher than 38.8 °C, continuing until the
child had been afebrile for 24 hours. Ramakrishnan 1986 used
oral diazepam 0.2 mg/kg three times daily for the duration of the
fever. Second, the rectal diazepam subgroup: differences existed in
the way the doses were calculated (either based on age or weight)
and the interval and duration of the dosing. Knudsen 1985 was
the only study using an age-based dosing scheme (5 mg for age
above 3 years and 7.5 mg for older children) with intervals of 12
hours during fever. Mosquera 1987 and Taghdiri 2011 used 0.5
mg/kg every eight hours during fever, while Pavlidou 2006 used
0.33 mg/kg every eight hours on first day and every 12 hours on
the following days. Uhari 1995 started with a first rectal dose (2.5
mg for < 7 kg, 5 mg 7 to 15 kg and 10 mg > 15 kg) followed after
six hours by oral diazepam 0.2 mg/kg every eight hours during
fever with a maximum of two days.
There were significant overall findings at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48
months, not at 60 to 72 months: At six months, 65 (11.4%) of
570 treated children had a recurrence compared with 104 (17.9%)
of 581 children in the control group (Risk Ratio (RR) 0.64, 95%
CI 0.48 to 0.85); NNT 16, Analysis 1.1. At 12 months, 123
(17.5%) of 703 treated children had a recurrence compared with
181 (25.4%) of 713 children in the control group (RR 0.69,
95% CI 0.56 to 0.84); NNT 13, Analysis 1.2. At 18 months,
19 (12.5%) of 152 treated children had a recurrence compared
with 46 (33.6%) of 137 children in the control group (RR 0.37,
95% CI 0.23 to 0.60); NNT 5, Analysis 1.3. At 24 months, 72
(20.3%) of 355 treated children had a recurrence compared with
105 (27.3%) of 384 in the control group (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56
to 0.95); NNT 15, Analysis 1.4. At 36 months, 24 (54.5%) of 44
treated children had a recurrence compared with 43 (60.6%) of
71 children in the control group (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.85);
NNT 4, Analysis 1.5. At 48 months, 5 (11.1%) of 45 treated
children had a recurrence compared with 20 (30.8%) of 65 in the
control group (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.89); NNT 6, Analysis
1.6. At 60 to 72 months, none (0%) of 30 treated children had a
recurrence compared with 6 (20.0%) of 30 in the control group
(RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.31); NNT 5, Analysis 1.7.
Subgroup analyses did not always yield significant results when
the overall analyses did. Oral diazepam did not reach significance
at six months, and rectal diazepam was not significantly different
at 24 months.
2. Continuous phenobarbitone versus placebo or no treatment
(see Analysis 2.1; Analysis 2.2; Analysis 2.3; Analysis 2.4; Analysis
2.5; Analysis 2.6).
Ten trials compared continuous phenobarbitone versus placebo or
no treatment. (Bacon 1981; Camfield 1980; Farwell 1990; Garcia
1984; Heckmatt 1976; Mamelle 1984; McKinlay 1989; Ngwane
1980; Thilothammal 1993; Wolf 1977).
In five trials (Bacon 1981; Camfield 1980; Farwell 1990; Mamelle
1984; Thilothammal 1993) the control group received placebos
and in the remaining five the controls received no treatment. Most
trials assessed recurrence at 6 months (6 trials) and 12 months (7
trials), while recurrence at 18, 24 and 60 to 72 was assessed in 2,
3 and 1 trials respectively. Behavioural changes were assessed by
Camfield 1980 at 12 months.
All trials included participants with a first seizure, except McKinlay
1989 (> 1 FS or complicated FS) and Thilothammal 1993 (≥
2); three included only participants with simple febrile seizures
(Camfield 1980; Ngwane 1980; Thilothammal 1993), and two
included participants with complicated seizures (Farwell 1990: >
1 risk factor; McKinlay 1989: > 1 FS or complicated FS). Initial
dosing varied between 3 to 6 mg/kg. Some trials adjusted dosing
based on drug levels measured in saliva (Bacon 1981: 8 - 15 mg/
L) or blood (Heckmatt 1976: 65 - 129 µmol/l; Mamelle 1984: >
60 µmol/l, Wolf 1977: 10 - 20 µg/ml). In the other trials dosing
was not adjusted during follow-up.
Continuous phenobarbitone resulted in significantly fewer recur-
rences at 6, 12 and 24 months, but not at 18 and 60 to 72 months.
At six months, 43 (10.4%) of 412 treated children had a recur-
rence compared with 75 (17.8%) of 421 children in the control
group (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.83); NNT 14, Analysis 2.1.
At 12 months, 67 (17.0%) of 395 treated children had a recur-
rence compared with 127 (30.8%) of 412 children in the control
group (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.70); NNT 8, Analysis 2.2.
At 18 months, 43 (33.3%) of 129 treated children had a recur-
rence compared with 58 (43.0%) of 135 children in the control
group (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.05); NNT 10, Analysis 2.3. At
24 months, 61 (23.9%) of 255 treated children had a recurrence
compared with 96 (34.5%) of 278 children in the control group
(RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.89); NNT 10, Analysis 2.4. At 60
to 72 months, 9 (30.0%) of 30 treated children had a recurrence
compared with 6 (20.0%) of 30 children in the control group (RR
1.50, 95% CI 0.61 to 3.69); NNT 10, Analysis 2.5
3. Intermittent phenobarbitone versus placebo or no treatment
(see Analysis 3.1; Analysis 3.2; Analysis 3.3; Analysis 3.4).
Three trials compared intermittent phenobarbitone versus placebo
or no treatment (Mackintosh 1970; Ramakrishnan 1986; Wolf
1977).
Inone trial (Mackintosh 1970)the control groupreceivedplacebos
and in the remaining two (Ramakrishnan 1986; Wolf 1977) the
controls received no treatment. Recurrence was assessed at six and
12 months in two trials each, and at 24 and 60 to 72 months in
one trial each.
All studies included children with a first febrile seizure, and in ad-
dition Mackintosh 1970 included only those with simple seizures.
Dosing schemes differed between trials. In Mackintosh 1970, par-

 ticipants received an initial dose of 60 mg, followed by 30 mg
every six hours for the duration of fever. Participants included in
Ramakrishnan 1986 received 3 - 5 mg/kg/day divided into two
doses, and participants included in Wolf 1977 received 5 mg/kg
for the duration of fever, as well as an initial ’load’ of 30 mg/kg to
a maximum of 120 mg.
Intermittent phenobarbitone did not lead to fewer recurrences at
6, 12, 24 and 60 to 72 months. At six months, 18 (11.5%) of
156 treated children had a recurrence compared with 11 (8.8%)
of 125 children in the control group (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.67 to
2.81); NNT 37, Analysis 3.1. At 12 months, 34 (21.8%) of 156
treated children had a recurrence compared with 27 (21.6%) of
125 children in the control group (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.65 to
1.59); NNT 500, Analysis 3.2. At 24 months, 35 (25.0%) of 140
treated children had a recurrence compared with 32 (29.4%) of
109 children in the control group (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.57 to
1.28); NNT 23, Analysis 3.3. At 60 to 72 months, 5 (16.7%) of
30 treated children had a recurrence compared with 6 (20.0%) of
30 children in the control group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.44);
NNT 31, Analysis 3.4.
4. Phenytoin versus placebo (see Analysis 4.1)
One trial compared phenytoin to placebo (Bacon 1981).
Of the children allocated to phenytoin treatment, 16 (34.0%) of
47 had a recurrence at 12 months compared to 15 (34.9%) of the
43 in the placebo group (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.73); NNT
112, Analysis 4.1.
5. Valproate versus placebo or no treatment (see Analysis 5.1;
Analysis 5.2; Analysis 5.3; Analysis 5.4).
Two trials compared valproate versus placebo or no treatment (
McKinlay 1989; Mosquera 1987).
McKinlay 1989 included 151 children with more than one febrile
seizure or with complicated febrile seizures, and compared val-
proate 30 mg/kg versus placebo, while Mosquera 1987 included
69 children with a first febrile seizure and treated with valproate
30 mg/kg or no treatment.
Valproate only reduced recurrence at 18 months, but not at 6, 12
and 24 months. At 18 months, 1 (4.5%) of 22 children in the
active treatment group had a recurrence compared to 9 (34.6%)
of 26 children in the control group (RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to
0.96); NNT 4, Analysis 5.3. At six months, 10 (14.1%) of 71
children in the active treatment group had a recurrence compared
to 10 (11.8%) of 85 in the control group (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.55
to 2.62); NNT 44, Analysis 5.1. At 12 months, 24 (19.8%) of
121 treated children had a recurrence compared with 32 (23.9%)
of 134 children in the control group (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.52 to
1.29); NNT 25, Analysis 5.2. At 24 months, 19 (26.8%) of 71
treated children had a recurrence compared with 18 (21.2%) of
85 children in the control group (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.18);
NNT 18, Analysis 5.4.
6. Pyridoxine versus placebo (see Analysis 6.1; Analysis 6.2).
McKiernan 1981 was the only study comparing pyridoxine with
placebo.
At six months, 4 (7.3%) of 55 had a recurrence compared to 8
(15.4%) of 52 in the placebo group (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.15 to
1.48); NNT 13, Analysis 6.1. At 12 months, 7 (12.7%) of 55
children in the active treatment group had a recurrence compared
to 10 (19.2%) of 52 in the placebo group (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.27
to 1.61); NNT 16, Analysis 6.2.
7. Intermittent ibuprofen versus placebo (see Analysis 7.1;
Analysis 7.2; Analysis 7.3).
Van Stuijvenberg 1998 was the only study comparing intermittent
ibuprofen with placebo.
At six months, 26 (23.4%) of 111 children allocated to the active
treatment group had a recurrence compared to 25 (21.0%) of 119
allocated to the placebo group (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.81);
NNT 42, Analysis 7.1. At 12 months, 31 children (27.9%) of
111 allocated to the active treatment group had a recurrent seizure
compared to 35 (29.4%) of 119 allocated to the placebo group
(RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.43); NNT 67, Analysis 7.2. At 24
months, 36 (32.4%) of 111 children allocated to the ibuprofen
group had a recurrent seizure compared with 46 (38.7%) of 119
children allocated to the placebo group (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.59
to 1.19); NNT 16, Analysis 7.3.
8. Intermittent clobazam versus placebo (see Analysis 8.1).
Bajaj 2005 was the only study comparing clobazam with placebo.
At six months, 9 (30.0%) of 30 children allocated to the clobazam
group had a seizure recurrence compared to 25 (83.3%) of 30
allocated to the placebo group (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.64);
NNT 2, Analysis 8.1.
9. Zinc sulfate versus placebo (see Analysis 9.1).
Fallah 2015 was the only study comparing zinc sulfate to placebo.
At 12 months, 11 (22.0%) of 50 children allocated to six months
daily zinc sulfate treatment had a seizure recurrence compared to
19 (38.0%) of 50 children allocated to placebo (RR 0.58, 95% CI
0.31 to 1.09), NNT 7, Analysis 9.1.
10. Diclofenac versus placebo followed, after eight hours,
by ibuprofen, acetaminophen or placebo (see Analysis 10.1;
Analysis 10.2; Analysis 10.3; Analysis 10.4).
Strengell 2009 randomised 231 children who had a first febrile
seizure to receive either diclofenac (1.5 mg/kg) or placebo. Af-
ter eight hours, treatment was randomly continued with either
ibuprofen, acetaminophen or placebo. Since outcomes were un-
affected by the second randomisation, we only consider the first
in this meta-analysis. At six months, 14 (12.0%) of 117 children
allocated to the diclofenac group had a seizure recurrence com-
pared to 17 (14.9%) of 114 children allocated to the placebo group
(RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.55), NNT 25, Analysis 10.1. At 12
months, 19 (16.2%) of 117 children allocated to the diclofenac
group had a seizure recurrence compared to 27 (23.7%) of 114
children allocated to the placebo group (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.40 to
1.16); NNT 14, Analysis 10.2. At 18 months, 23 (19.7%) of 117
children allocated to the diclofenac group had a seizure recurrence
compared to 31 (27.2%) of 114 children allocated to the placebo
group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.16); NNT 14, Analysis 10.3.

 At 24 months, 26 (22.2%) of 117 children allocated to the di-
clofenac group had a seizure recurrence compared to 32 (28.1%)
of 114 children allocated to the placebo group (RR 0.79, 95% CI
0.51 to 1.24); NNT 17, Analysis 10.4.
11. Phenobarbitone versus intermittent diazepam (see Analysis
11.1; Analysis 11.2).
Two studies compared phenobarbitone with intermittent di-
azepam (Garcia 1984, Salehiomran 2016).
At 12 months, 17 (23.0%) of 74 children treated with continuous
phenobarbitone had a recurrence versus 11 (15.5%) of the 71 chil-
dren treated with intermittent oral diazepam (RR 1.48, 95% CI
0.75 to 2.94); NNT 14, Analysis 11.1. At 18 months, 5 (10.0%)
of 50 children allocated to the phenobarbitone group had a seizure
recurrence compared to 4 (8.0%) of 50 children allocated to the
intermittent rectal diazepam group (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.36 to
4.38); NNT 50, Analysis 11.2.
12. Intermittent rectal diazepam versus intermittent valproate
(see Analysis 12.1; Analysis 12.2).
This comparison was examined in one study, Daugbjerg 1990.
At six months, 11 (12.4%) of 89 children allocated to intermittent
rectal diazepam had a recurrent seizure compared to 7 (8.8%) of
80 children allocated to the valproate treatment group (RR 1.41,
95% CI 0.58 to 3.47); NNT 28, Analysis 12.1. At 12 months,
23 (25.8%) of 89 children allocated to the intermittent rectal
diazepam group had a seizure recurrence compared to 14 (17.5%)
of 80 children allocated to the valproate group (RR 1.48, 95% CI
0.82 to 2.67); NNT 12, Analysis 12.2.
13. Intermittent diazepam versus intermittent clobazam (see
Analysis 13.1).
Two studies compared intermittent diazepam with intermittent
clobazam (Ghazavi 2016; Khosroshahi 2011). At 12 months, 3
(4.2%)of 71childrenallocatedtothe clobazamgrouphadaseizure
recurrence compared to 7 (9.7%) of 72 allocated to the diazepam
group (RR 2.28 (95% CI 0.62 to 8.42), NNT 19, Analysis 13.1.
Recurrence risk of febrile seizures in the non-intervention
groups
As a number of studies included children with risk factors known
to be associated with a higher recurrence risk, the data on this
issue were skewed towards higher recurrence risk in the placebo or
control groups. Nonetheless, viewing pooled data on this issue al-
lowed us to weigh the clinical importance of any significant results
in the intervention arms of the studies. The data are summarised
below and in Figure 5.

 Recurrence risk in control groups at six months: these pooled data
included the studies of Bajaj 2005; Camfield 1980; Farwell 1990;
Heckmatt 1976; Knudsen 1985; Mackintosh 1970; McKinlay
1989; McKiernan 1981; Mosquera 1987; Pavlidou 2006; Rosman
1993; Strengell 2009; Thilothammal 1993; Uhari 1995; Van
Stuijvenberg 1998; Verrotti 2004; Wolf 1977. A total of 259
(19.4%) of 1333 children had a recurrent febrile seizure within
six months of study entry (placebo-controlled trials: 166/804
(20.6%); no-treatment controlled trials: 93/529 (17.6%)).
Recurrence risk at 12 months: pooled data at 12 months in-
cluded the studies of Autret 1990; Bacon 1981; Camfield 1980;
Fallah 2015; Farwell 1990; Knudsen 1985; Mackintosh 1970;
McKiernan 1981; McKinlay 1989; Mosquera 1987; Ngwane
1980; Pavlidou 2006; Rosman 1993; Strengell 2009; Taghdiri
2011; Thilothammal 1993; Uhari 1995; Van Stuijvenberg 1998;
Verrotti 2004; Williams 1979; Wolf 1977. A total of 415 (26.7%)
of 1554 children had a recurrent seizure at 12 months (placebo-
controlled trials: 262/1009 (26.0%); no-treatment controlled tri-
als: 153/545 (28.1%)).
Recurrent risk at 18 months: pooled data included the studies
of Farwell 1990; Knudsen 1985; Mamelle 1984; Strengell 2009.
One hundred and thirty-five (35.0%) of 386 children in these
studies had a recurrent seizure within 18 months (placebo-con-
trolled trials: 89/249 (35.7%); no-treatment controlled trials: 46/
137 (33.6%)).
Risk of recurrence at 24 months: pooled data included the
studies from Farwell 1990; McKinlay 1989; Mosquera 1987;
Rosman 1993; Strengell 2009; Uhari 1995; Van Stuijvenberg
1998; Verrotti 2004; Wolf 1977. Two hundred and seventy-nine
(31.2%) of 895 children had a documented recurrent febrile
seizure at 24 months (placebo-controlled trials: 210/636 (33.0%);
no-treatment controlled trials: 69/259 (26.6%)).
Risk of recurrence at 36 months: data included only Pavlidou
2006: 43 (60.5%) recurrences among 71 children receiving no
treatment.
Risk of recurrence at 48 months: only data from Verrotti 2004
were available; 20 (30.8%) of 65 children receiving no treatment
had a documented recurrent febrile seizure at 48 months.
Recurrent risk at 60 to 72 months: analysis included data from
only one study (Ramakrishnan 1986); 6 (20.0%) of 30 children
receiving no treatment had a recurrent seizure at this point in time.
Treatment adherence
Fifteen of 30 trials assessed treatment adherence using various ap-
proaches. Their results are summarised in Table 1. Some measures
were relatively crude, e.g. Camfield 1980 reported the presence or
absence of the drug in serum samples. Others, e.g. Heckmatt 1976
and McKinlay 1989, measured drug levels on a random, ad hoc
basis. There was no reported consistency between the relationship
of drug levels ascertained in this way and seizure control. This is
in accordance with current clinical practice, which recommends
drug level measurement only when non-adherence is suspected; in
such a situation only the presence or absence of the drug is helpful.
Our observations serve to emphasise the importance of intention-
to-treat analysis.
Adverse events and medication effects
Antiepileptic drugs are know for frequent and sometimes severe
side effects in children. A variety of adverse effects were reported in
some studies. Some were described as “unacceptable” or as reasons
for the child to stop medication and, in some instances, to leave
the trial. A descriptive summary, detailed in so far as was possible
from the information provided in the articles, is given in Table 2
’Unwanted medication effects’. We consider the fact that adverse
effects were not addressed at all in eight included studies and only
in one arm of the study in a further two as a measure of the
generally poor quality of these studies.
Camfield 1980 was the only one to address behavioural change in
a focused way. The authors recorded the incidence of behavioural
changes in those allocated to the active phenobarbitone treatment
group, comparing them to those in the placebo group, at 12-
month follow-up. Fifteen of 35 (42.8%) allocated to phenobarbi-
tone reported behavioural change or sleep disturbance, compared
to eight of 30 (26.3%) allocated to the placebo group (RR 1.61,
95% CI 0.79 to 3.26). More detail on the adverse effects in this
study is given in the summary table under ’adverse effects’, see
below.

Summary of main results
We note no significant benefit for intermittent phenobarbitone,
phenytoin, valproate, pyridoxine, ibuprofen or zinc sulfate versus
placebo or no treatment; nor for diclofenac versus placebo fol-
lowed by ibuprofen, acetaminophen or placebo; nor for continu-
ous phenobarbitone versus diazepam, intermittent rectal diazepam
versus intermittent valproate, or oral diazepam versus clobazam.
There was a significant reduction of recurrent febrile seizure risk
with intermittent diazepam versus placebo or no treatment at all
time points, except for 60 to 72 months, with a risk ratio (RR)
ranging from 0.37 to 0.73 and a number needed to treat (NNT)
from 5 to 14 patients (rounded to integer). A significant reduction
in febrile seizure recurrence risk was also seen in continuous phe-
nobarbitone versus placebo or no treatment in each meta-analyses
that included three or more trials (at 6, 12 and 24 months, but
not at 18 and 60 to 72 months). Risk ratios ranged from 0.54 at
12 months to 0.69 at 24 months, with a NNT of 8 to 10.
Another significant reduction in febrile seizure recurrence was seen
in the intermittent clobazam group compared to placebo at six
months follow-up: the risk ratio was 0.36, with a NNT of 2.
However, with anextraordinarilyhigh numberof recurrencesin 25
out of 30 (83.3%) children in the control group, we feel the play of
chance has most likely led to an unrepeatable apparent beneficial
effect for the treatment group. The median recurrence rate in the
control groups of all included trials was approximately 20% at
six months (Figure 5), indicating how potentially misleading this
study’s findings are likely to be.
Ashasbeenindicated,the recordingof adverse effectsinthese stud-
ies was very variable and often non-existent. Camfield 1980 doc-
umented lower comprehension scores in phenobarbitone-treated
children (yet with small numbers), which correlated with length
of phenobarbitone treatment. The findings were supported by the
data of Farwell 1990. In general, adverse effects were recorded in
up to 30% of children in the phenobarbitone-treated group, al-
though notably the studies by Bacon 1981 and Camfield 1980
(the latter for behavioural change or sleep disturbance) observed
no difference with control groups. Knudsen 1985 noted mild tran-
sient adverse effects in up to 36% of children in the diazepam-
treated groups.
Fallah 2015 offered a novel approach by evaluating the effect of
zinc supplementation on febrile seizure recurrence risk. Previous
studies demonstrated blood and cerebrospinal fluid zinc levels to
be significantly lower than in children with afebrile seizures. Zinc
level is known to stimulate pyridoxal kinase enzyme activity and
the decarboxylation of glutamic acid, as well as increasing brain
gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) levels. Although it was hy-
pothesised that decreased zinc levels might play a role in the patho-
genesis of febrile seizures supplementation in this study, it con-
ferred no significant benefit over placebo (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31
to 1.09).
Figure 5 offers useful data when counselling parents on the natural
history of the condition. As one might predict, there was no signif-
icant difference in recurrence rate in those treated with placebo or
those who had no treatment. For each follow-up epoch recurrence
rates stay remarkably similar at between 20% and 35%, except
for the remarkable 36-month follow-up rate in Pavlidou 2006 of
60.5%, an outlier unlikely to be repeated. This continuing risk
serves to emphasise the importance of conveying appropriate sup-
portive advice to parents (see below).
In summary, we found reduced recurrence rates in children treated
with intermittent diazepam or continuous phenobarbitone. Both
drugs lead to the advent of mild to moderate adverse effects in up
to 30% of its recipients. However, since the long-term outcome
of children with febrile seizures is good, irrespective of whether
their febrile seizures are successfully prevented or not, only short-
term benefits may be expected from treatment and they should be
weighed against possible drug-related adverse events. To empha-
sise the point we should bear in mind we would need to treat 100
children with either intermittent diazepam or phenobarbitone to
save up to 10 children from a recurrence, while giving 33 children
unwanted effects. The mainstay of intervention should be the pro-
vision of information for the families involved on recurrence risk,
first aid management and the benign nature of the phenomenon.
Parents should be provided with contact details for medical ser-
vices so that they will feel supported in the event of a recurrence,
which inevitably leads to anxiety and fright for the vast majority
of those involved.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Completeness: The two interventions found to be effective in re-
ducing future seizure recurrence were supported by nine (intermit-
tent diazepam) and 10 (continuous phenobarbitone) unique trials
of predominantly low quality. The results of the related meta-anal-
yses were fairly consistently in favour of the intervention, more
so for diazepam (for which there was only one trial with results
favouring control) than for phenobarbitone (which had two trials
favouring control). The majority of these trials included children
after their first simple febrile seizure. Thus there is reasonable evi-
dence to conclude their effectiveness to prevent a recurrent seizure
in this population with a NNT ranging from 5 to 14.
Applicability: All studies concern the population at risk of re-
current febrile seizures, and evaluate commonly-used medical in-
terventions. Knudsen 1991 have indicated that the long-term
outcome of children with febrile seizures is good, irrespective of
whether their febrile seizures are successfully prevented or not. His
early observations on the benign nature of the phenomenon for
most children is in keeping with common experience in clinical
practice and the opinion cited in standard texts. No additional
long-term benefit can therefore be expected in addition to the re-
duced risk of recurrence for both intermittent diazepam and con-
45

 tinuous phenobarbitone. This benefit should be weighed against
the clear risk of adverse events. Hence the decision to treat must
rest on whether quality of life and shorter-term morbidity may be
altered by the use of drugs.
Quality of the evidence
Most of the reviewed trials date from 20 or more years ago and are
of a methodological quality which nowadays would be recognised
as needing improvement. Methods of randomisation and alloca-
tion concealment often do not meet current standards, and treat-
ment versus no treatment is more commonly seen than treatment
versus placebo, leading to obvious sources of bias. Nonetheless,
the size of the data pool does allow us to draw some conclusions
about the value of intervention with medication for this common
childhood phenomenon.
Potential biases in the review process
The review authors worked closely together at each step of the
review, double-checking each other’s assessments. We found that
the methodological quality of most of the antiepileptic drug stud-
ies was very low, low or moderate. The ’Risk of bias’ tables iden-
tify examples of selection, performance and detection, attrition,
and reporting bias. Publication bias is also likely, as shown in the
present analysis. We contacted all UK neurologists and selected
North American colleagues before the original review to assess this
risk. They were asked to declare if they knew of any studies unpub-
lished for showing a lack of treatment effect. None came forward
with an example.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
We are not aware of any other current review, or that our review
findings and conclusion contradict those of any other review pub-
lished more than 20 years ago.

Implications for practice
There were some significant results, although no clinically impor-
tant benefits, for the management of children with febrile seizures
for intermittent diazepam and continuous phenobarbitone. No
benefit was demonstrated for phenytoin, valproate, pyridoxine, in-
termittent phenobarbitone or antipyretics in the form of intermit-
tent ibuprofen, acetaminophen or diclofenac in the management
of febrile seizures. Intermittent clobazam conferred some benefit
at six months follow-up but the result may be difficult to repli-
cate. Zinc supplementation offered no benefit. Parents should be
supported with adequate contact details of medical services and
information on recurrence, first aid management and, most im-
portantly, the benign nature of the phenomenon.
Implications for research
If future studies are to be considered, then due attention should
be given to the quality of randomisation allocation and conceal-
ment with placebo as a control. Adverse effects should be recorded
systematically for both intervention and control groups. However,
given the long-term benign nature of the phenomenon of febrile
seizures and the relatively higher rate of reporting of adverse ef-
fects to date, unless a significant case of justification can be made
it seems difficult to justify further research in this area.

Strengell 2009
Methods
Randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial
Participants
231, 4 - 48 months, first febrile seizure; 63 of these had had a complicated first seizure
Interventions
Random allocation first into 2 groups (rectal diclofenac (1.5 mg/kg suppository) versus
placebo) and then to 3 groups (oral placebo versus acetaminophen (15 mg/kg) versus
ibuprofen (10 mg/kg)) - each up to four times per day for as long as temp. > 38 °C
Outcomes
Actuarial analysis of seizure recurrence up to 24 months
Notes
Participants included in analyses for as long as they participated because Kaplan Meier
used with no imputations for the dropouts

72 children randomised, 36 to phenobarbital and 36 to carbamazepine, but 32 not included in final analysis. In
15 there was no follow-up, 5 were excluded because of low or no anti-epileptic drug level, 9 excluded because of
unacceptable adverse effects, 2 had afebrile seizures and 1 child was incorrectly entered. Unfortunately no follow-
up detail is given for any of these 32 children (44%!)
