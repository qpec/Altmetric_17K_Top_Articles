Future Direct
Assessing the Optimal Position for Vedolizumab in the Treatment 
of Ulcerative Colitis: A Simulation Model

Background: Vedolizumab, an α4β7 integrin monoclonal antibody inhibiting gut lymphocyte trafficking, is an effective treatment for ulcerative 
colitis (UC). We evaluated the optimal position of vedolizumab in the UC treatment paradigm.
Methods: Using Markov modeling, we assessed multiple algorithms for the treatment of UC. The base case was a 35-year-old male with 
steroid-dependent moderately to severely active UC without previous immunomodulator or biologic use. The model included 4 different algo-
rithms over 1 year, with vedolizumab use prior to: initiating azathioprine (Algorithm 1), combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine 
(Algorithm 2), combination therapy with an alternative anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) and azathioprine (Algorithm 3), and colectomy 
(Algorithm 4). Transition probabilities and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) estimates were derived from the published literature. Primary 
analyses included simulating 100 trials of 100,000 individuals, assessing clinical outcomes, and QALYs. Sensitivity analyses employed longer time 
horizons and ranges for all variables.
Results: Algorithm 1 (vedolizumab use prior to all other therapies) was the preferred strategy, resulting in 8981 additional individuals in re-
mission, 18 fewer cases of lymphoma, and 1087 fewer serious infections per 100,000 patients compared with last-line use (A4). Algorithm 1 also 
resulted in 0.0197 to 0.0205 more QALYs compared with other algorithms. This benefit increased with longer time horizons. Algorithm 1 was 
preferred in all sensitivity analyses.
Conclusion: The model suggests that treatment algorithms positioning vedolizumab prior to other therapies should be considered for individu-
als with moderately to severely active steroid-dependent UC. Further prospective research is needed to confirm these simulated results.

U
lcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condi-
tion involving the colon. More than 10% of UC patients 
require colectomy within 20 years of diagnosis due to inad-
equate symptom control with medical therapy.1
Over the last 2 decades, there have been significant 
advances in the medical management of UC, with the develop-
ment of infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab, which target 
tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNFs). These medications dem-
onstrate even greater efficacy when used in combination with 
a thiopurine,2 and they have changed the natural history of 
UC. For example, colectomy and mortality rates for UC have 
decreased in the anti-TNF era.1, 3, 4 However, a large propor-
tion of patients either fail to respond or lose response to anti-
TNF drugs5; these patients often have lower rates of response 
to other medications within that class.6
Vedolizumab is a Food and Drug Administration–
approved biologic that selectively inhibits the α4β7 integrin 
heterodimer, targeting gut-specific lymphocyte trafficking. 
Vedolizumab has demonstrated efficacy in moderately to se-
verely active UC for inducing and maintaining remission and 
has been approved for the treatment of both biologic-naïve 
and experienced patients.7–10 While vedolizumab is superior to 
placebo irrespective of prior anti-TNF treatment history, anti-
TNF-naïve patients achieve higher rates of response and re-
mission than those who have previously received anti-TNFs.11
Management of moderately to severely active UC has 
typically consisted of a “step-up model,” whereby patients 
with moderate to severe disease or steroid dependence initially 
received a thiopurine (with a steroid taper), followed by an

Optimal Position of Vedolizumab in UC Therapy
anti-TNF either alone or in combination with a thiopurine. In 
those who failed to respond or lost response to this therapy, 
an alternative anti-TNF was often prescribed, followed poten-
tially by colectomy.12 There is uncertainty regarding where new 
biologic agents with different mechanisms of action should be 
incorporated into the UC treatment paradigm. There currently 
exists no scientific rationale for limiting the use of vedolizumab 
to those who have failed other biologic therapies, as those who 
are naïve to other steroid-sparing therapies may derive the most 
potential benefit from this medication.10 Furthermore, balanc-
ing both the efficacy and safety profiles for the different treat-
ment options can be particularly challenging.
In the absence of clinical trials comparing treatment algo-
rithms, mathematical simulation can be used to address this 
question. A previously published cost-effectiveness study sug-
gested that infliximab should be used as the first biologic ster-
oid-sparing agent but only examined the choice of first agent, 
that is, comparing vedolizumab directly with an anti-TNF over 
the course of 1 year, without considering longitudinal care, 
which often requires the sequential use of multiple medications 
to sustain control of symptoms.13 In this study, we employ a 
novel application of simulation modeling techniques to predict 
where in the current treatment paradigm vedolizumab use may 
result in the greatest potential clinical benefit for patients with 
moderately to severely active UC.
METHODS
We constructed a Markov simulation model to assess the 
ideal position of vedolizumab in the current treatment para-
digm for UC. The model structure was designed by 2 authors 
(F.I.S., J.D.L.) and consisted of the base case of a 35-year-old 
male with steroid-dependent moderately to severely active UC 
who was initiating steroid-sparing medical therapy in the out-
patient setting, comparable in disease severity to those individ-
uals included in the SUCCESS trial.2 The time horizon for the 
primary analyses was 1 year, with 3-month cycle lengths. For 
models extending beyond 1 year, rewards were discounted at 
a rate of 3%. All effectiveness estimates were calculated using 
half-cycle correction to reduce bias introduced by the cycle 
length.
Therapeutic decision-making was modeled after a 
step-up treatment paradigm (Fig. 1). In this algorithm, indi-
viduals would initially receive azathioprine. Those who did 
not respond or lost response would then move on to the next 
therapeutic options, which were arranged in the following 
order: combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine, 
combination therapy with another anti-TNF and azathioprine, 
and, lastly, colectomy. Colectomy was presumed to be the least 
preferred option for all individuals. Four algorithms were then 
simulated, each incorporating vedolizumab in a different pos-
ition within this treatment paradigm: Use of vedolizumab 
prior to azathioprine (Algorithm 1), prior to combination 
therapy with infliximab and azathioprine (Algorithm 2), prior 
to combination therapy with an alternative anti-TNF and aza-
thioprine (Algorithm 3), and as last-line therapy after combin-
ation therapy with an alternative anti-TNF prior to colectomy 
(Algorithm 4) (Fig. 1). Thus, the model compared 4 different 
treatment algorithms for UC, allowing us to estimate which al-
gorithm would yield the greatest expected quality of life.
Regardless of the algorithm, with each medication that 
is started, individuals first enter an induction phase where they 
could achieve: (a) steroid-free remission, (b) clinical response 
without steroid-free remission, or (c) nonresponse. Individuals 
could also experience serious adverse events (SAEs) requiring 
medication discontinuation or serious infections during induc-
tion. Those with clinical response or remission remained on 
that therapy, entering a maintenance phase. During mainten-
ance therapy for each medication, individuals could experience 
a loss of response, SAE requiring discontinuation of therapy, 
serious infections requiring a temporary pause in therapy for 
treatment, or lymphoproliferative disorders. Those with SAEs 
requiring discontinuation, nonresponse, or loss of response 
subsequently received the next medication in the treatment al-
gorithm. All individuals were continuously exposed to age-spe-
cific all-cause mortality, which was calculated using baselines 
rates of death per US Census data, with subsequent sensitivity 
analyses evaluating possible increased mortality risk.14
Individuals undergoing colectomy were exposed to a 
1-cycle period of increased peri-operative mortality, reduced 
quality of life, all-cause age-specific mortality, and a risk of a 
complicated postoperative course.15 Those who survived sur-
gery received a disutility related to life with a J-pouch based on 
previously published estimates.16
Clinical Variables and Outcome Estimates
Transition probabilities for each medication were derived 
from relevant randomized controlled trials when available 
(Table 1). If no randomized controlled trials were available for 
a specific estimate, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and ob-
servational studies were employed. The relevant attributes of 
each clinical trial used to derive transition probabilities, includ-
ing study design, year of publication, authors, cohort size, 
and disease-related factors, are summarized in Supplemental 
Table 1. Transition probabilities related to immunomodula-
tor monotherapy induction were based on azathioprine and 
derived from the SUCCESS trial.2 Rates of medication-related 
complications and risk of flare with immunomodulators were 
derived from a recently published meta-analysis.17 Rates of in-
duction for infliximab combination therapy were derived from 
SUCCESS, while maintenance therapy estimates were derived 
from the ACT trials.5, 18 SUCCESS was employed for induction 
in both infliximab and azathioprine as it was the most modern, 
head-to-head induction trial for these agents. The use of an al-
ternative anti-TNF was modeled after adalimumab using in-
duction and maintenance estimates derived from the ULTRA-2 
study, stratified by prior anti-TNF exposure when possible.6

Vedolizumab estimates were derived from pooled data collected 
during the GEMINI studies,19 and stratified by prior anti-TNF 
exposure: Algorithms 1 and 2, which employed vedolizumab 
prior to an anti-TNF, used estimates derived from patients who 
were anti-TNF-naïve, whereas estimates for Algorithms 3 and 
4, which used vedolizumab after an anti-TNF, were derived 
from anti-TNF-experienced individuals. Week 14 data were 
used for the probability of response, remission, adverse events, 
and serious infections during induction, whereas maintenance 
data were derived from week 52 data (Table 1; Supplemental 
Methods and Results).
The incremental risks of lymphoma with exposure to aza-
thioprine or anti-TNFs were modeled independently of each 
other. The baseline probability of lymphoproliferative complica-
tions was determined utilizing age- and sex-specific rates derived 
from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 
age- and sex-specific data.20 These baseline risks were modi-
fied dependent on the current medications the individual was 
taking with drug-specific increased risks.21, 22 Thiopurine-specific 
lymphoma risks were derived from the Cancers Et Surrisque 
Associé aux Maladies Inflammatoires Intestinales En France 
(CESAME) cohort.22 The baseline hazard of lymphoma with 
anti-TNF use was defined as 1.0, as no significant associations 
between this class of medications and non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
(NHL) were appreciated in either the CESAME registry or the 
TREAT registry.23 As an increased risk of lymphoma with ved-
olizumab use was not appreciated in a recent study by Colombel 
and colleagues with up to 5 years of follow-up,24 we did not 
assign an increased risk of NHL to vedolizumab in this model. It 
was assumed that all individuals developing lymphoma received 
standard-of-care chemotherapy and did not receive additional 
UC-specific therapy.25
FIGURE 1. Overview of model structure and vedolizumab insertion sites. Four potential algorithms were constructed and compared with each 
other, each inserting vedolizumab into the algorithm at a separate position in the model. For each medication, individuals were exposed to the risk 
of not responding or entering remission, subsequently flaring, experiencing an adverse drug event requiring drug discontinuation, developing a 
serious infection requiring temporarily withholding the medication, and developing lymphoma. Colectomy was assumed to be the least preferred 
strategy.

Outcomes were defined in quality-adjusted life-years 
(QALYs). QALYs are measures of one’s quality of life for a 
given period of time. To compute QALYs, the utility, or prefer-
ence, of a specific health state (ranging from 1 for perfect health 
to 0 for death) is multiplied by the number of years lived in this 
health state.26 QALY estimates were derived both from the pre-
viously published literature and expert opinion27 (Supplemental 
Methods).
Statistical Methods
Analyses were conducted using TreeAge Pro 2016 
(TreeAge Software, Inc., Williamstown, MA). Expected out-
comes in QALYs were calculated for all algorithms. Incremental 
effectiveness, or the number of QALYs gained for a specific al-
gorithm of care, was calculated as the difference in the mean 
values of QALYs between 2 algorithms.26 First-order Monte

Optimal Position of Vedolizumab in UC Therapy
iterations of the model was performed to calculate mean val-
ues and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all estimates. These 
analyses were repeated extending the time horizon from 1 year 
to 3, 5, and 7 years to determine if this impacted the preferred 
algorithm. Markov cohort analyses were conducted to simu-
late outcomes at the end of 1 year and 3 years for a cohort of 
 
100,000 individuals.
Sensitivity Analyses
One-way sensitivity analyses were performed, varying 
all transition probabilities by 25% and all QALY estimates by 
15%. FOMCS analyses were repeated from age 35 to 75 years in 
10-year increments to assess the impact of age on the preferred 
strategy at 1 year. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (second- 
order Monte Carlo simulation) were conducted using normal 
and Dirichlet distributions derived from relevant clinical liter-
ature where appropriate over 50,000 iterations of the model. 
These methods allow for incorporating uncertainty in transi-
tion probabilities into the model’s outcomes28 (Supplemental 
Methods).
Alternative model structures assessed several assump-
tions in the model (Supplemental Fig. 1). As clinicians are more 
frequently employing anti-TNFs earlier in the course of disease 
in lieu of azathioprine, we constructed a model where firstline 
therapy was anti-TNF monotherapy, followed by combination 
therapy with an anti-TNF and azathioprine. We constructed a 
model beginning with combination thiopurine and anti-TNF 
therapy, removing thiopurine monotherapy. We also performed 
an analysis where adalimumab use preceded infliximab.29 We 
performed an additional analysis examining an increased risk 
of colectomy during UC flares. In this model, individuals who 
had active disease due to lack or loss of response to treatment, 
SAEs, or serious infection were exposed to an increased risk of 
colectomy for 1 cycle of 2.4%.30 Sensitivity analyses were per-
formed, increasing this value up to 10% per cycle.
We performed a structural sensitivity analysis allowing 
for dose optimization in both anti-TNFs and vedolizumab. 
Rates of response and remission after dose optimization for 
anti-TNFs were derived from a cohort of patients with Crohn’s 
disease31 and were assumed to be similar between all anti-
TNFs. Rates of dose optimization and optimization-related 
clinical efficacy for vedolizumab were derived from Loftus 
et al.32 Given varying rates of efficacy of dose optimization in 
retrospective studies in UC,33, 34 the limited available data on the 
efficacy of optimization with vedolizumab, and our assumption 
regarding similar effects across anti-TNFs, threshold analyses 
were performed for all additional inputs used in this analysis 
to determine if the estimated preferred strategy was sensitive 
to these inputs (Supplemental Methods and Results). FOMCS 
estimates were calculated at 1, 3, and 5 years for these analyses.
Vedolizumab use after anti-TNF failure has been associ-
ated with lower response and remission rates, as compared with 
anti-TNF-naïve patients.19 Little is known about the anti-TNF 
response rates following vedolizumab therapy. It is possible that 
those who fail to respond to vedolizumab are also less likely to 
respond to anti-TNFs. To assess the potential impact of this 
hypothesis, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine 
the magnitude of reduction in response and remission rates 
with anti-TNFs when used after vedolizumab that is required 
to modify the preferred algorithm of care (Supplemental 
Methods and Results). Furthermore, we assessed the impact 
of using prior anti-TNF exposure-stratified inputs for vedol-
izumab on our model. To perform this analysis, we used overall 
estimates for induction and maintenance of remission derived 
from GEMINI, irrespective of prior anti-TNF exposure, to de-
termine if this influenced the results of our primary analyses.
RESULTS
In this model, Algorithm 1 (using vedolizumab prior to 
azathioprine) yielded the greatest number of QALYs at the end 
of 1 year when compared with all other strategies (Algorithm 
1: expected value [EV], 0.6057 QALYs; Algorithm 2: EV, 0.5841 
QALYs; Algorithm 3: EV, 0.5860 QALYs; Algorithm 4: EV, 
0.5852 QALYs), with an incremental benefit (IB) of Algorithm 
1 over other algorithms ranging from 0.0197 to 0.0205 QALYs. 
In first-order Monte Carlo simulation, Algorithm 1 was also 
preferred (Table 2). This benefit persisted in probabilistic anal-
yses as well, with firstline vedolizumab use (mean expected 
QALYs, 0.6072; 95% CI, 0.5865–0.6276) producing the greatest 
QALYs at the end of 1 year (Table 3). Over 50,000 iterations of 
the probabilistic model, Algorithm 1 was the preferred strategy 
97.7% of the time at the end of 1 year.
When considering longer time horizons, Algorithm 
1 was the preferred strategy with a 3-year time horizon, and 
Algorithm 2 was preferred when considering a 5- or 7-year 
time horizon (Table 2). The incremental benefit of early ved-
olizumab use increased as the time horizon was extended, with 
the greatest benefit of vedolizumab prior to anti-TNFs appreci-
ated at 7 years (Fig. 2).
When simulating the clinical outcomes of a cohort of 
100,000 individuals, Algorithm 1 resulted in 8981 additional 
individuals in remission, 18 fewer cases of lymphoma, and 
1087 fewer serious infections at the end of 1 year compared 
with Algorithm 4 (utilizing vedolizumab as last-line therapy 
after thiopurines and combination therapy with anti-TNFs). 
Mortality rates were similar between the firstline and last-line 
strategies (0.165% vs 0.164%). When comparing the 2 algo-
rithms at 3 years, Algorithm 1 resulted in 9257 more individuals 
in remission, 36 fewer cases of lymphoma, 5359 fewer colec-
tomies, and 2631 fewer serious infections per 100,000 treated 
patients.
Sensitivity Analyses and Alternative Models
Early vedolizumab use (Algorithm 1) remained the pre-
ferred strategy at the end of 1 year, with variation of all tran-
sition probabilities by 25%. The model was robust to estimates

of infection risk with all medications, including those for induc-
tion and maintenance therapy with vedolizumab. The benefit of 
early vedolizumab use remained stable with increasing age up 
to 75 years (IB at age 75 years, 0.0205 QALYs).
In sensitivity analyses examining algorithms without aza-
thioprine monotherapy as firstline therapy (eg, starting with 
either infliximab or adalimumab monotherapy) (Supplemental 
Fig. 1), algorithms that used vedolizumab prior to anti-TNF 
therapy yielded the greatest expected quality of life. In a sen-
sitivity analysis examining starting with azathioprine mono-
therapy and then progressing to infliximab monotherapy, 
followed by combination therapy with anti-TNF drugs with 
azathioprine, use of vedolizumab as firstline therapy remained 
the preferred strategy at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years (Supplemental 
Fig. 3, Supplemental Table 2).
When including the opportunity for dose modification 
to treat a flare when on maintenance biologic therapy, firstline 
vedolizumab use remained the preferred strategy in FOMCS at 
1 year (IB, 0.0219–0.0280 compared with other strategies). This 
benefit increased with longer time horizons and was not sen-
sitive to threshold analyses employing rates of remission with 
infliximab dose optimization efficacy as high as 70%.
When including an increased risk of colectomy during 
active flares of disease, vedolizumab use as firstline therapy 
remained the preferred strategy (IB relative to last-line use 
prior to surgery, 0.0232), with increasing benefit over time 
(IB at 7 years, 0.0682 when comparing firstline steroid-spar-
ing therapy with last-line use). The model was not sensitive 
to variations in surgical risk up to 10%. A threshold ana-
lysis assessed the potential impact of reduced anti-TNF ef-
ficacy after vedolizumab use. Early vedolizumab use yielded 
the greatest benefit when reducing both the absolute induc-
tion response and remission rates of infliximab and adal-
imumab by as much as 9% when used after vedolizumab

Optimal Position of Vedolizumab in UC Therapy
at 1 year (Supplemental Fig. 2A). However, when extend-
ing the time horizon to 3 years, firstline vedolizumab use 
was no longer the preferred strategy if there was >8.7% 
absolute reduction in infliximab’s rate of remission and 
response after vedolizumab (Supplemental Fig. 2B). In con-
trast, employing GEMINI 1 inputs without stratification 
by prior anti-TNF exposure produced different results. In 
this model, vedolizumab use prior to colectomy (Algorithm 
4: mean EV, 0.5853; 95% CI, 0.5846–0.5859) and prior to 
a second anti-TNF (Algorithm 3: mean EV, 0.5867; 95% 
CI, 0.5861–0.5873) were preferred over use as firstline 
(Algorithm 1, mean EV, 0.5583; 95% CI, 0.5576–0.5587) or 
first biologic therapy (Algorithm 2: mean EV, 0.5646; 95% 
CI, 0.5640–0.5652).
DISCUSSION
Most clinical trials in UC compare a novel therapy 
with either placebo or an established standard-of-care ther-
apy. There are currently limited data comparing treatment 
algorithms incorporating sequential therapies in UC. In this 
study, we employed state-of-the-art simulation modeling to 
compare multiple permutations of the treatment algorithm 
for moderately to severely active UC. Using the best evidence 
currently available, the model predicts that an algorithm using 
vedolizumab as the first steroid-sparing therapy followed by 
other therapies may provide the greatest benefit, as measured 
in QALYs over the course of 1 year or longer. This also is 
predicted to result in fewer surgeries, lymphomas, infectious 
complications, and serious adverse events compared with 
employing this medication after other steroid-sparing ther-
apies. The predicted greater quality of life with early use of 
vedolizumab was largely due to higher remission rates when 
vedolizumab is used prior to anti-TNF therapy rather than fol-
lowing anti-TNF therapy.
Clinical trial data have demonstrated that vedolizumab, 
with its gut-selective mechanism of action, has a favorable safety 
profile among the biologic therapies.24 Data from multiple clin-
ical trials also demonstrate that vedolizumab may be less ef-
fective if used after failing anti-TNF therapy.19 Consequently, 
some experts recommend using vedolizumab as a firstline ster-
oid-sparing therapy in UC.35, 36 However, without clinical trial 
data comparing algorithms, clinicians and payers lack quanti-
tative data on which to base this decision. This simulation pro-
vides a quantitative synthesis of the available data to guide this 
treatment decision.
The results of the simulation suggest that patients with 
UC would potentially derive the greatest benefit from using 
vedolizumab prior to anti-TNF therapy. This does not imply 
that vedolizumab would be more efficacious than anti-TNF 
therapy in a head-to-head trial. Rather, the results of the model 
were sensitive to the reduced efficacy of vedolizumab when 
used after anti-TNF therapy. Although the model was not sen-
sitive to estimates of the potentially reduced effectiveness of 
anti-TNF therapy when used after vedolizumab, these results 
highlight the need for future pragmatic clinical trials compar-
ing specific sequences of agents, as a significant proportion of 
patients will fail at least 1 biologic therapy over the course of a 
given year.5, 6, 18, 19
This study has several important strengths. The use of 
simulation modeling to assess where a new therapy should be 
positioned in a complicated treatment paradigm is novel. We 
also assessed variation in clinical practice by modifying the 
order of medications and employed transition probabilities that 
accounted for previously used medications. Similar techniques

therapies (Algorithm 2) from 1 to 7 years. The incremental benefit of early vedolizumab use was appreciated to increase over time, both in those 
receiving this medication as firstline therapy and prior to combination therapy, when compared with using it as last-line therapy. Abbreviation: VDZ:

can be employed in the future to model other inflammatory 
bowel disease medications as they become available. Likewise, 
the model can be updated as new information becomes avail-
able. We also employed numerous deterministic and probabilis-
tic sensitivity analyses to confirm our results.
There are several important caveats to consider when 
interpreting our results.It is possible that those who are primary 
nonresponders to anti-TNFs may also have a reduced response 
rate to vedolizumab. We employed vedolizumab effect estimates 
that were specific to prior anti-TNF exposure to account for 
this. In addition, the model was not sensitive to variation of up 
to 25% of the induction and maintenance estimates for vedol-
izumab in any analysis. The preferred algorithm did not change 
when evaluating the impact of anti-TNF and vedolizumab dose 
optimization.
While we were able to model the impact of prior anti-
TNF use on vedolizumab efficacy, there are currently no 
published data to inform our model on the impact of prior 
vedolizumab use on subsequent anti-TNF effectiveness. 
Threshold analyses in simulation modeling are ideally suited 
to address potential input deficiencies such as this. In this 
model, we demonstrated that even with up to a 9% absolute 
reduction in anti-TNF efficacy (equivalent to a 41% and 19% 
relative reduction in efficacy of infliximab to induce remission 
and response, respectively), early vedolizumab use remained 
the preferred strategy when employing a 1-year time hori-
zon. However, when modeling longer time horizons, this may 
have a significant impact on the preferred treatment strategy 
(Supplemental Results). As early vedolizumab use is increas-
ingly selected by clinicians and their patients, further research 
should determine what effect anti-integrin therapy has on sub-
sequent anti-TNF responsiveness.
We employed transition probabilities derived from rele-
vant clinical trials. There are several potential caveats with 
this approach. First, these clinical trials included patient pop-
ulations in different eras with varying disease characteristics, 
which could contribute to differences in measured treatment 
effect. We have summarized these differences in Supplemental 
Table 1. Importantly, previous publications demonstrated that 
the randomized controlled trials included here are at low risk 
for bias.37 Second, there are currently no clinical trials directly 
comparing vedolizumab with other biologic agents, although 
several are ongoing.38 While several recently published network 
meta-analyses attempt to make head-to-head comparisons,39, 40 
network meta-analyses do not consider the relative efficacy of 
different sequences of medications patients with UC may re-
quire over time. Third, it is possible that the real-world safety 
and effectiveness of these medications may differ from rates 
appreciated in clinical trials. However, most published data 
have demonstrated that the real-world effectiveness of the bio-
logic therapies for UC are similar to the efficacy rates observed 
in clinical trials.41, 42 Like most decision models, we used ab-
solute estimates of efficacy from clinical trials, as opposed to 
placebo-adjusted rates analogous to network meta-analysis. 
For infliximab, we relied on the results from the SUCCESS trial 
rather than ACT-1/2 as this provided estimates from azathio-
prine and combination therapy as well. Of note, the estimated 
efficacy of anti-TNFs and combination therapy was higher in 
SUCCESS than in ACT 1/2. Moreover, our model was robust 
to variation in these transition probabilities by up to 25% in 
sensitivity analyses. However, despite these additional anal-
yses, caution should be exercised in generalizing these results 
until further prospective evaluation of sequential therapies is 
conducted.
We based our model on clinical remission, as opposed to 
mucosal healing. Mucosal healing is an evolving end point in 
clinical trials, with differing definitions, and has not been fully 
integrated into clinical practice. There are very limited data to 
inform the impact of medication changes for patients who have 
responded to a therapy but have persistent mucosal inflamma-
tion. In addition, our base case was defined as an individual 
who was steroid-dependent in the outpatient setting. Given the 
time to clinical response and lack of data on steroid-refractory, 
inpatient UC, our results are likely not applicable to these pa-
tient populations. As such data become available in the future, 
the model could be updated to include this treatment strategy. 
Finally, the intent of this model was to determine the optimal 
position of vedolizumab to improve clinical outcomes. As such, 
we did not incorporate cost data into this model. However, this 
framework can be employed for cost-effectiveness analyses in 
the future.
In summary, this study used state-of-the-art modeling to 
compare treatment algorithms for moderately to severely active 
UC. When considering algorithms of immunomodulator and 
biologic use in UC, vedolizumab as firstline steroid-sparing 
therapy demonstrated the greatest potential benefit in QALYs, 
lower risk of infection, and lower risk of colectomy at the end 
of 1 year. These data support the use of vedolizumab as an ini-
tial steroid-sparing therapy in steroid-dependent UC. Clinical 
trials are needed to directly compare sequential treatment algo-
rithms for UC.
