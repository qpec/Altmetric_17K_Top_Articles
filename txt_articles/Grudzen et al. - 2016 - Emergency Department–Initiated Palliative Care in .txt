IMPORTANCE The delivery of palliative care is not standard of care within most emergency
departments (EDs).
OBJECTIVE To compare quality of life, depression, health care utilization, and survival in ED
patients with advanced cancer randomized to ED-initiated palliative care consultation vs care
as usual.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A single-blind, randomized clinical trial of ED-initiated
palliative care consultation for patients with advanced cancer vs usual care took place from
June 2011 to April 2014 at an urban, academic ED at a quaternary care referral center. Adult
patients with advanced cancer who were able to pass a cognitive screen, had never been
seen by palliative care, spoke English or Spanish, and presented to the ED met eligibility
criteria; 136 of 298 eligible patients were approached and enrolled in the ED and randomized
via balanced block randomization.
INTERVENTIONS Intervention participants received a comprehensive palliative care
consultation by the inpatient team, including an assessment of symptoms, spiritual and/or
social needs, and goals of care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was quality of life as measured by the
change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–General Measure (FACT-G) score at 12
weeks. Secondary outcomes included major depressive disorder as measured by the Patient
Health Questionnaire-9, health care utilization at 180 days, and survival at 1 year.
RESULTS A total of 136 participants were enrolled, and 69 allocated to palliative care (mean
[SD], 55.1 [13.1] years) and 67 were randomized to usual care (mean [SD], 57.8 [14.7] years).
Quality of life, as measured by a change in FACT-G score from enrollment to 12 weeks, was
significantly higher in patients randomized to the intervention group, who demonstrated a
mean (SD) increase of 5.91 (16.65) points compared with 1.08 (16.00) in controls (P = .03
using the nonparametric Wilcoxon test). Median estimates of survival were longer in the
intervention group than the control group: 289 (95% CI, 128-453) days vs 132 (95% CI,
80-302) days, although this did not reach statistical significance (P = .20). There were no
statistically significant differences in depression, admission to the intensive care unit, and
discharge to hospice.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Emergency department–initiated palliative care consultation
in advanced cancer improves quality of life in patients with advanced cancer and does not
seem to shorten survival; the impact on health care utilization and depression is less clear and
warrants further study.

A
report by the Institute of Medicine1 delineated many
barriers to improving cancer care at the end of life, in-
cluding the historical separation of palliative or hos-
pice care from other health care environments. The emer-
gency department (ED) serves as the health care safety net for
society’
s most vulnerable, with both ethnic and/or racial mi-
norities and the poor presenting to the ED for care in dispro-
portionate numbers.2-4 Despite this, care within the ED has not
beenrealignedtobetterreflectthispopulation’
sneedsorgoals.
For patients with advanced cancer, visits to the ED are
common,5,6 often because patients are in physical and/or emo-
tional crisis.7-9 During these visits, decisions are made about
the intensity of care, including whether to admit (and to what
level of care) and whether to begin life-sustaining therapies,
such as intubation or other invasive procedures. Although the
availabilityofpalliativecareservicescontinuestoincrease,10-13
consultation typically does not occur until a week into a pa-
tient’
s hospital stay.14,15 Thus, the ED presents a key decision
point at which physicians set the subsequent care trajectory
during a hospitalization.
Because hospice use has increased in patients with can-
cer at the end of life, intensive care unit (ICU) use has also in-
creased in the last month of life, from 24% to 29%.16 ED to ICU
admissions are increasing at a rate greater than population
growth and are outpacing ED use.17 Patients’main concerns
at the end of life include maintaining control, relieving bur-
dens,andstrengtheningfamilyrelationships,18whichmaycon-
flict with ICU admission. Physicians often fail to initiate dis-
cussion of patients’goals of care, despite the fact that those
discussions are well received by patients and cause minimal
distress.19
Data suggest that early palliative care consultation can im-
prove quality of life (QOL), decrease hospital length of stay and
ICU admission, and may even extend life.14,20-24 Better match-
ing of patients’goals of care to treatments would not only re-
sult in better concordance of ED disposition with patients’pre-
ferred site of care, but also might decrease ICU admissions at
the end of life and increase referrals to hospice. A consulta-
tion prompted from the ED may be a unique point at which to
ensure that care is congruent with patients’wishes and inter-
rupt the cascade of intensive, end-of-life care that could be a
marker of low-quality care. To compare QOL, depression,
health care utilization, and survival for ED patients with ad-
vanced cancer, we conducted a single-blind randomized clini-
cal trial (RCT) of ED-initiated palliative care consultation vs
usual care.
Methods
Study Design
To evaluate the impact of ED-initiated palliative care consul-
tation on QOL, depression, health care utilization, and sur-
vivalinpatientswithadvancedcancer,weconductedapatient-
level, single center, single-blind pilot RCT of 136 participants.
The institutional review board at the Icahn School of Medi-
cine at Mount Sinai approved all study procedures, and every
participant provided written, informed consent. Patients were
offered a $20 gift card as an incentive to participate. See the
trial protocol in Supplement 1.
Setting
Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) is a quaternary care, academic
referral center in New York City, and the MSH ED is an active,
urban emergency department. Annually, approximately
100 000 patient visits are seen in the ED’
s adult and pediat-
ric divisions. The ED provides patient care 24 hours per
day, 7 days per week, to all who seek care. The trial was
conducted in the flow of routine patient care.
Participants
Research assistants screened the electronic medical record ED
trackboardforpatientswithourspecificadvancedcancerstag-
ing criteria (see eTable 1 in Supplement 2) 8 to 12 hours a day
Sunday through Friday. Medical oncologists at our institu-
tion were able to opt out of participation. Of 79 full-time medi-
caloncologyfacultyatMSH,allbut1agreedtohaveanyoftheir
patients enrolled in the study. All voluntary medical oncolo-
gists were called in real-time prior to approaching any of their
patients who were eligible to participate. Patients eligible for
participation were those with a known advanced cancer that
met our staging criteria, who were able to speak English or
Spanish fluently, and who were being admitted to or ob-
served in the hospital. Patients were excluded if they were un-
able to answer questions because of severe pain or lethargy, if
they had been seen by palliative care in the past, or if they had
evidence of cognitive impairment based on the 6-item
screener.25 Patients planning to leave the immediate geo-
graphic area (ie, move to another state or country) were also
excluded.
Intervention
Randomization and Blinding
After the baseline survey was completed, the research coor-
dinator then relayed the participant information to a sepa-
rate research staff member (the “randomizer”) with no role in
study recruitment, follow-up, or analysis. Participants were
randomized via prespecified balanced block randomization in
blocks of 50. If the participant was assigned to the interven-
tion group, the randomizer then paged the palliative care con-
sultation team to relay information about the participant
(name, medical record number, ED attending, and oncologist
Key Points
Question: Does palliative care in the emergency department affect
quality of life, depression, health care use, and survival in patients
with advanced cancer?
Findings: In this randomized clinical trial, patients with advanced
cancer who were offered emergency department–initiated
palliative care vs usual care had statistically significant better
quality of life at 12 weeks with no significant difference in survival
rates at 1 year.
Meaning: Emergency department–initiated palliative care
improves quality of life without shortening survival.

of record) and the reason for consultation. If assigned to the
usual care group, no further action was necessary. The list link-
ing participant name and group assignment was stored on a
secure network computer under password protection, and was
accessible only to the randomizer. All research staff involved
in recruitment and follow-up were blind to participant assign-
ment. It was not feasible to blind participants or care provid-
ers to participant assignment. See the eFigure in Supplement
2 for the CONSORT flow diagram demonstrating subject flow
through each stage of the study.
Intervention Arm
If the participant was assigned to the intervention arm, the
palliative care team was consulted within a few hours. Inter-
vention participants received a comprehensive palliative
care consultation by the inpatient team on the same or fol-
lowing day. At MSH, inpatient comprehensive palliative care
consultation consists of 3 components: (1) symptom assess-
ment and treatment, (2) goals of care and advance care
plans, and (3) transition planning. The palliative care team is
composed of a physician, a nurse practitioner, a social
worker, and a chaplain. The team uses validated symptom
assessments to make recommendations for symptom man-
agement using National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) guidelines.26 They communicate these recommen-
dations to consulting physicians (in this case, the oncologist
or hospitalist) verbally, either in person or by telephone, and
electronically through standardized palliative care team
medical chart notes. The palliative care team meets with
patients, families, and care teams to identify goals of care,
complete advance directives, and communicate difficult
news (if requested) using standardized communication pro-
tocols. If admitted, the team sees patients daily to monitor
implementation and results of treatment recommendations
and to assess for new and ongoing symptoms. Reassessment
and treatment modifications occur as needed to achieve
goals of care. The palliative care team conducts or assists
with discussions about new or changing goals of care, com-
municates bad news, and adjusts treatments accordingly.
The team also works with the patients’social workers and
family to facilitate transition management consistent with
goals of care. If the team finds ongoing palliative care needs
that are expected to continue after discharge, they refer
patients to the outpatient palliative care clinic.
Usual Care Arm
Participantsassignedtotheusualcarearmcompletedthesame
baseline interviews and follow-up as intervention partici-
pants. If requested by the admitting team or oncologist of rec-
ord, usual care participants may also have received a pallia-
tive care consultation.
Outcome Measures
Outcomes were specified ahead of time. The primary out-
come was the measure of the change score of the QOL at 12
weeks. Secondary outcomes included survival at 1 year, health
care utilization at 180 days (hospital days, hospice use, and ICU
admission), and major depressive disorder at 12 weeks.
Data Collection and Management
Patient-Reported Outcomes
A face-to-face English or Spanish survey was administered to
the participant in the ED prior to randomization. The survey
included questions regarding demographics, including sex,
race/ethnicity, marital status, income, education, religious af-
filiation, type of residence, history of an advance directive or
designation of a health care proxy, and health insurance; func-
tional performance status was measured using the Eastern
Oncology Cooperative Group score (ECOG)27; QOL was mea-
sured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-
General Measure (FACT-G)28; and the 9-item Patient Health
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)29 was used to screen for depres-
sion. Quality of life and depression were measured again at
6and12weeks,eitherbytelephoneorinpersonduringasched-
uled follow-up visit. The 6-week measurement was added
1monthintotheprotocolbecausealargeproportionofourfirst
participants died before the 12-week follow-up.
Measures of Health Care Use
Measure of Health Care use outcome data was collected via the
electronic medical record. Administrative data review using
the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse was used for health care uti-
lization and billing information. For the medical chart and ad-
ministrative data review, a codebook was created, and the re-
search coordinator performing medical chart abstraction was
blinded to participant assignment.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (ver-
sion 9.3.2; SAS Institute Inc). Descriptive statistics were used
to estimate the frequencies, and means (SDs) of the study vari-
ables.Differencebetweentheinterventiongroupandtheusual
care group in baseline characteristics and outcomes were as-
sessed with the use of 2-sided Fisher exact tests and χ2 tests
for categorical variables, and independent 2-sample t tests and
Wilcoxon rank tests for continuous variables. Multivariate lo-
gistic regression analyses, adjusted for baseline scores, were
used to examine the effect of the intervention on depression.
We used an intention-to-treat analysis. We chose a conserva-
tive method of carrying baseline values forward to account for
missingdepressionandQOLfollow-upmeasures.Survivaltime
was calculated from the date of enrollment to the date of death
using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference of sur-
vival time between the intervention and the usual care group
was compared using the Log-rank test. P < .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant. Please refer to our published pro-
tocol for additional methodological and logistical details.30

that depression was well balanced between the intervention
group and the usual care group at baseline (χ2 test P = .49), and
that there were no significant differences at week 6 (χ2 test
P = .61) or week 12 from baseline between the 2 groups (χ2 test

evaluates symptoms of major
depressive disorder according to
the criteria of the fourth edition of

depressive disorder was coded as a
binary variable (yes/no). A major
depressive disorder was noted if a
patient reported at least 5 of the 9
symptoms of depression on the
PHQ-9, with 1 of the 5 symptoms
being depressed mood or a lack of
pleasure. Symptoms had to be
present for more than half the time
over the past 2 weeks, except for
the symptom of suicidal thoughts,
which was included in the notation
of major depressive disorder, if it
was present at any time.
dQuality of life was assessed by the
use of the measure FACT-G, on
which scores range from 0 to 108,
with higher scores indicating a
better quality of life.

results were similar for the analysis at week 12 (P = .46).
Health Care Utilization
Hospice Use
We compared hospice use between the intervention group and
the usual care group at 180 days (see eTable 3 in Supplement
2). Although hospice use was slightly higher in the interven-
tion group, 28% vs 25% in the usual care group, we found no
significant difference in hospice usage between the 2 groups
(χ2 test P = .93; Fisher exact test P = .85).
Hospital Days
We compared hospital days between the intervention group
and the usual care group both for the index-admission and up
to 180 days. We truncated the hospital days at 180 days for 5
participantswithalengthofstaythatcrossedthe180-daymark.
See eTable 4 in Supplement 2, which lists the summary sta-
tistics (mean [SD]) for inpatient days. We found no signifi-
cant difference in hospital days between the intervention and
usual care groups during the index-admission (Wilcoxon test
P = .67).Theinterventiongrouphadslightlymorehospitaldays

statistically significant (Wilcoxon test P = .14).
ICU Admission
We compared ICU admission between the intervention group
and the usual care group during the index-admission and at
180 days. Since only 1 participant had more than 1 ICU admis-
sion, we treated the ICU admission as a binary outcome. See
eTable 5 in Supplement 2 which lists 2 contingency tables for
the ICU admission analysis. During the index-admission, there
was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups
(seeeTable5AinSupplement2)(FisherexacttestP > .99).Simi-
larly, for the ICU admission up to 180 days, there was no sta-

Discussion
Herein,wepresentresultsfromthefirsttrialofED-initiatedpal-
liativecareinadvancedcancer,provingthatearlyreferraltopal-
liative care significantly improves QOL and does not seem to
have a negative impact on survival. Quality of life was signifi-
cantly higher in participants randomized to the intervention
group, who demonstrated a statistically and clinically mean-
ingful increase in QOL at 12 weeks (P < .05 using the nonpara-
metricWilcoxontest).31,32Mediansurvivalwasalmost5months
longer in the intervention group. The lack of statistical signifi-
cance was due to the highly variable length of survival in our
cohort. It is likely that a future trial that limits enrollment to pa-
tients at a similar stage in their disease, and thus has a less vari-
ablelengthofsurvivalfromenrollment,wouldbothfindasimi-
lar survival benefit and reach statistical significance.

Whileofobviousimportancetopatients,thesefindingsare
alsotremendouslyimportanttohospitalsandpolicymakerswho
are concerned with initiating palliative care earlier in the dis-
ease course. The results of a recently completed trial of early
vs delayed palliative care in cancer by Bakitas et al24 demon-
strate a survival benefit at the 1 year mark for early-entry par-
ticipants. This study demonstrates that we can now generalize
from what we already know about palliative care in metastatic
non–small-cell lung cancer to other advanced cancers.20 The
results presented herein also add to the knowledge base about
palliativecareandcancerbydemonstratingsimilareffectswith
a different population and setting. Despite tremendous racial,
ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity in our cohort, as well as
variability in cancer type and functional status, we were able
to illustrate similar improvements in QOL. In addition, partici-
pants randomized to the intervention group in our study lived
4.9 months longer than those in usual care, although this dif-
ference was not statistically significant because of the hetero-
geneityofsurvivalamongourparticipants.Thisshouldnotonly
be reassuring to hospitals who hope to initiate palliative care
triggers from the ED but also provoke further interest among
policymakers hoping to find ways to decrease disparities in ac-
cess to palliative care. It is well established that large dispari-
tiesexistincancersurvivalforracial/ethnicminoritiesandthat
these groups are more likely to access the ED for care. While in-
tegrated models of palliative care in oncology clinics are criti-
cal to beginning palliative care early in the course of disease,
they may miss important, vulnerable populations who use the
ED in disproportionate numbers.

variety of physical, social, and psychological reasons, and ad-
dressing them during an inpatient stay takes time. It is also im-
portanttonotethatpalliativecareisnotsynonymouswithend-
of-life care, and one of the primary goals of palliative care is to
align the care plan with a patient’
s goals, regardless of whether
these goals include the pursuit of invasive, life-sustaining pro-
cedures, admission to the ICU, or discharge to hospice.
Future research must examine ways in which we can more
accurately measure patient goals and evaluate whether care
plans run concordant to these wishes. This is also a limitation
to our work, in which we were unable to ascertain whether ICU

the system and team offered the patient. Another limitation

Depressive symptoms indicating the presence of MDD were assessed with the
use of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), a 9-item measure that
evaluates symptoms of major depressive disorder according to the criteria of
the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-IV). Major depressive disorder was coded as a binary variable (yes/no).
A major depressive disorder was noted as a Yes if a patient reported at least 5 of
the 9 symptoms of depression on the PHQ-9, with 1 of the 5 symptoms being
depressed mood or a lack of pleasure. Symptoms had to be present for more
than half the time over the past 2 weeks, except for the symptom of suicidal
thoughts, which was included in the notation of major depressive disorder, if it
was present at any time. The percentages of patients with noted MDD mood
symptoms at 3 different time points, assigned to intervention group, and those
assigned to the usual care group are shown. The analyses were performed with
an intention to treat, and we chose a conservative method of carrying baseline
values forward to account for all missing data.

inherent to the design of research in any population with lim-
ited life expectancy is missing data, insofar as many patients
do not survive to complete follow-up. We accounted for this
in our analysis by using the conservative methods of carrying
the last value forward for missing follow-up data on depres-
sion and QOL, as was done by Temel et al.20
Conclusions
We found that initiating palliative care in the ED for patients
with advanced cancer improved QOL and did not seem to
shorten survival. Given the diversity of the ED population
and its often limited access to specialty care, this is an
important place to initiate palliative care consultation. The
impact on depression, hospital days, ICU admission, and
hospice is less clear, and better ways of measuring whether
care plans are congruent with patient goals are sorely
needed.
Emergency department–initiated palliative care consul-
tation improves QOL in patients with advanced cancer and
does not seem to shorten survival; the impact on health
care utilization and depression is less clear and warrants
further study.

Editor's Note
Prospective, Interdisciplinary Randomized Clinical Trials
for Patients With Cancer in the Emergency Department
A Step Forward for Palliative Oncology Care
Charles R. Thomas Jr, MD
It is clear that the emergency department (ED) is a source of
care for a considerable portion of the population, including
patients experiencing acute and subacute effects of
the underlying malignant
disease or perhaps adverse
effects of treatment.1 For
those with advanced disease
and/or symptoms requiring
prompt palliation, it would
seem intuitive to begin formal palliative care in the ED. In
fact, ED practitioners offer end-of-life care management.2
Grudzen and colleagues3 from Mt Sinai and New York
University are to be congratulated on their attempt to
address this question in a prospective, randomized clinical
trial.4 The investigators did show an improvement in quality
of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer
Therapy–General Measures (FACT-G) score at 3 months, in
those patients randomized for immediate palliative care
team consultation while they were in the ED. There was a
trend in survival. It would be important to know whether
ED initiation of the palliative care chain will result in a
decrease in readmission rates and the ethnic/racial and
socioeconomic disparity of these services rendered. Future
prospective interdisciplinary studies involving the intersec-
tion of emergency and/or urgent care, oncology, and pallia-
tive care practitioners are necessary to further refine opti-
mal and cost-effective, patient-centered care for patients
with cancer and caregivers.
