Background 
43 
Large-scale evidence from randomised placebo-controlled trials has shown that statin therapy 
44 
reduces the incidence of major vascular events (i.e., coronary deaths or myocardial infarctions, 
45 
ischaemic strokes and coronary revascularisation procedures) by about one quarter for each 1 
46 
mmol/L LDL-cholesterol reduction during each year (after the first) that it continues to be taken.1 
47 
The proportional reductions in risk were similar in secondary and primary prevention, and were 
48 
somewhat greater among lower-risk individuals (although the absolute benefits were smaller). 
49 
These findings have resulted in guidelines recommending that statin therapy be considered for all 
50 
patients who have experienced an atherosclerotic event and, in primary prevention, for individuals 
51 
who have a 10 year risk of having a cardiovascular event (defined as coronary death, myocardial 
52 
infarction, angina stroke, or transient ischaemic attack) of at least 10%, as well as for those with 
53 
high LDL-cholesterol levels or relevant co-morbidity (such as diabetes).2,3 
54 
 
55 
Concerns have been expressed about the expansion in statin use produced by lowering risk 
56 
thresholds for offering statin therapy to patients.4,5 In making the argument against so-called 
57 
“over-medicalization” of the population, it has been claimed that statin therapy causes increased 
58 
rates of adverse events and symptomatic side-effects (chiefly muscle pain and weakness) that 
59 
prevent as many as one fifth of patients from continuing to take statin therapy long-term.5,6  These 
60 
claims have usually derived from observational studies using health-care databases which, since 
61 
they are neither randomised nor blinded, are subject to potential biases in the assessment of 
62 
causation.7 By contrast, in double-blind randomised trials of statin therapy, the reported rates of 
63 
different types of adverse event have generally been similar among patients receiving statin or 
64 
placebo treatment (except for reductions in atherosclerotic events), with no differences between 
65 
the groups in the rates of treatment cessation in association with adverse events7,8,9,10.  
66 
 
67 
It has been suggested that the lack of an excess of AEs in randomised controlled trials of statin 
68 
therapy might be due to their ascertainment not being sufficiently specific or sensitive.5,11  The 
69 
Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT)12 provides a unique opportunity to assess the 
70 
impact of blinded and un-blinded ascertainment of AEs identified using the same approach during 
71 
blinded randomised statin therapy in the Lipid-lowering arm (LLA) of the trial13 (i.e., the “blinded 
72 
randomised” phase) and during the subsequent follow-up period when a proportion of patients 
73 
were taking open-label statin (the “non-blinded non-randomised” phase).14 Four AEs of interest 
74 
(AEOI) were pre-specified due to the public health impact of widespread claims about muscle-
75 
related side-effects and the addition to the drug label of erectile dysfunction, sleep disturbance 
76 
and cognitive impairment as possible side-effects based on reviews by MHRA and FDA.15,16 
77 
 
78 
Methods  
79 
Details of the ASCOT protocol, including study design, organization, clinical measurements, power 
80 
calculations, recruitment rates, and baseline characteristics have been published12 and further 
81 
information is available on the trial website (www.ascotstudy.org). ASCOT was an independent, 
82 
investigator-led, multicentre study. Men and women aged between 40 and 79 years were eligible 
83 
if they had > 3 risk factors for CV disease but had no history of myocardial infarction and were not 
84 
being treated for angina. They were randomly assigned in an open-label comparison between two 
85 
antihypertensive treatment regimens and, by using a 2 X 2 factorial design, between atorvastatin 
86 
10 mg daily versus placebo in the blinded LLA comparison.  
87 
 
88 
The study conformed to good clinical practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. The 
89 
protocol and all subsequent amendments were reviewed and ratified by central and regional 
90 
  
3 
 
ethics review boards in the UK and by national ethics and statutory bodies in Ireland and the 
91 
Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Finland). 
92 
 
93 
ASCOT-LLA and LLA-extension phases 
94 
Patients included in the ASCOT blood pressure-lowering comparison (BPLA) were also eligible for 
95 
inclusion in the LLA comparison if they had a total cholesterol concentration of 6·5 mmol/L or less 
96 
and were not taking a statin or a fibrate. There was no formal run in period to test for tolerance to 
97 
statins and few, if any, patients had any prior exposure to statin treatment. 10,305 patients were 
98 
randomised in the LLA between 1998 and 2000, but 65 were withdrawn soon after randomisation 
99 
due to concerns about source documentation validation. For the remaining 10,240 patients, the 
100 
randomly assigned atorvastatin or placebo  was stopped for efficacy (at the recommendation of 
101 
the Data Safety and Monitoring Board)  in 2002, after a median of 3·3 years of active follow-up,  
102 
(the period hitherto referred as the “blinded randomised phase” of the ASCOT-LLA).13 The patients 
103 
were then told whether they had been assigned atorvastatin or placebo, but they  continued to be 
104 
actively followed in the same way until 2004, for a median of 2·2 years, while the ASCOT-BPLA 
105 
comparison continued.14 During that period they were offered open-label atorvastatin (the “non-
106 
blinded non-randomised phase”), approximately two thirds of the patients opted to commence or 
107 
continue open-label statin therapy (“users”) while one third did not (“non-users”); see figure 1.  
108 
  
109 
Adverse Event recording, classification and adjudication 
110 
Following randomisation, study participants were scheduled to be seen at six weeks, three months 
111 
and, thereafter, at six monthly intervals during both the blinded randomised and the non-blinded 
112 
non-randomised phase of the ASCOT-LLA (until the ASCOT-BPLA completed ). At each study visit, 
113 
all AEs reported by participants were recorded by the study team in the case report form (CRF). 
114 
Specific questions relating to any putative AEs were not asked at these visits. During total follow-
115 
up for a median of 5·5 years among 10,240 randomised patients in the LLA, there were 60,612 
116 
distinct AEs (i.e., after removing multiple reports from the database of the same AE occurrence).  
117 
 
118 
Reports of AEs by study participants were initially recorded verbatim and subsequently classified 
119 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)17 into 26 separate system organ 
120 
classification (SOC) groups, 2,288 unique preferred terms, and 5,109 separate lower level terms. 
121 
For the present report, two physicians (AW and DT) adjudicated the four AEs of interest (AEOI): 
122 
muscle-related, erectile dysfunction, sleep disturbance and cognitive impairment. Each of the 
123 
adjudicators reviewed (blind to baseline characteristics, randomised treatment, non-study statin 
124 
use, and trial phase) all reported AEs for the presence of any of the four AEOIs and, based on the 
125 
description in the CRF, classified their degree of certainty (definite, probable or possible) according 
126 
to pre-specified definitions. Further details are given in supplementary table 4. Any disagreements 
127 
between the two adjudicators were independently resolved by a third physician (AG), who was 
128 
similarly blinded.  
129 
 
130 
Statistical analysis 
131 
Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare time to first AE in the blinded  phase 
132 
between patients randomly assigned atorvastatin versus those randomly assigned placebo, and in 
133 
the non-blinded non-randomised phase between patients who were exposed to statin therapy 
134 
during that phase (“users”) versus those who were not exposed (“non-users”). Patients were 
135 
considered to be non-users in the non-blinded non-randomised phase until statin treatment was 
136 
given for at least two consecutive days (i.e., events occurring beforehand were included in the 
137 
non-user group, whereas events occurring after statin use had started were included in the “user” 
138 
group even if the treatment had been stopped). Consequently, time-updated Cox-models were 
139 
  
4 
 
used for the comparisons of time to first AE between statin users and non-users. Hazard ratios 
140 
(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for the pre-specified primary 
141 
outcome for each AEOI of the combination of definite and probable events,  with subsidiary 
142 
sensitivity analyses of definite AEOIs only and of all AEOIs (i.e., including those considered to be 
143 
only possible AEOIs). Primary analyses did not involve adjustment for baseline characteristics at 
144 
the time of randomisation, but subsidiary analyses were conducted of the non-blinded 
145 
comparisons with adjustment for baseline characteristics.  All of the reported AEs not classified as 
146 
one of the four AEOIs were also analysed grouped by SOC. Incident rates where applicable were 
147 
reported as percentage per annum (% pa). 
148 
 
149 
Results 
150 
The blinded randomised phase of the LLA was conducted from 1998 to 2002, and the non-blinded 
151 
non-randomised phase from 2002 to 2004. Of the 10,240 eligible randomised patients, 60 (33 
152 
atorvastatin; 27 placebo) were excluded from these analyses as they were missing end dates for 
153 
the blinded phase. A further 281 patients (129 atorvastatin; 152 placebo) had either died or been 
154 
censored (i.e., those who stopped routine follow-up prior to the end of LLA), and were therefore 
155 
only included in the blinded analyses. Among 9,899 patients in the non-blinded non-randomised 
156 
phase, 6,409 (64·7%) were users of statin therapy (most commonly atorvastatin 10mg) at some 
157 
time during that period, with 52% using it immediately after the end of the blinded randomised 
158 
phase.   
159 
 
160 
Table 1 describes the baseline characteristics at the time of randomisation among patients who 
161 
were randomly assigned atorvastatin or placebo in the blinded randomised phase, and among  
162 
those who were users and non-users of statin therapy in the non-blinded non-randomised phase. 
163 
The patients were predominantly male, with an average age of 63 years at baseline.  No material 
164 
differences in baseline characteristics were observed between the randomised treatment groups. 
165 
However, in the non-randomised phase, users of statin therapy were less likely than non-users to 
166 
be women or to have been smokers, and more likely to have had diabetes at baseline. Patients 
167 
who had reported AEOIs during the blinded phase were slightly less likely to use a statin during the 
168 
open phase. (supplementary table 1). 
169 
 
170 
Adverse events in the blinded randomised phase 
171 
Adverse events of interests (AEOI): During the blinded randomised phase of ASCOT-LLA, the rate 
172 
of reporting of definite or probable muscle-related AEOIs was similar among patients randomly 
173 
assigned atorvastatin or placebo (298 [2·03%pa] vs 283 [2·00%pa]; HR 1·03 [95%CI 0·88-1·21]: 
174 
table 2). Compared with placebo, the rate of reports of erectile dysfunction was slightly, but non-
175 
significantly, lower among the patients assigned atorvastatin (272 [1·86%pa] vs 302 [2·14%pa]; HR 
176 
0·88 [0·75-1·04]). Patients assigned to receive atorvastatin reported sleep disturbance significantly 
177 
less often than did those assigned placebo (149 [1·00%pa] vs 210 [1·46%pa]; HR 0·69 [0·56-0·85]; 
178 
p=0.0005 before any adjustment for multiple comparisons). However, too few cases of cognitive 
179 
impairment were reported (31 [0·20%pa] vs 32 [0·22%pa]) for a statistically reliable analysis (HR 
180 
0·94 [0·57-1·54]). There were similar findings in sensitivity analyses based on definite AEOIs alone 
181 
or when the larger number of possible AEOIs were included (figure 2). 
182 
 
183 
Other adverse events: Compared with patients assigned placebo, the rates of reports of all other 
184 
AEs grouped by SOC categories were similar among patients assigned atorvastatin (table 3), with 
185 
the exception of a small excess of AEs attributed to renal and urinary disorders (481 [1·87%pa] vs 
186 
392 [1·51%pa]; HR 1·23 [1·08 to 1·41]; p=0.0021: table 3). Subdivision of that SOC, indicates the 
187 
excess was chiefly due to reports of nocturia and urinary frequency (supplementary table 2).  
188 
  
5 
 
 
189 
There were no differences between the treatment groups in the rates of serious AEs (except for 
190 
reductions in atherosclerotic events)13 or treatment cessation in association with adverse events 
191 
(supplementary table 3; www.ascotstudy.org). In particular, there was no excess of serious AEs 
192 
that had been attributed to musculoskeletal or connective tissue disorders. However, one case of 
193 
non-fatal rhabdomyolysis was reported in a man receiving atorvastatin who had had a very high 
194 
alcohol intake and a recent febrile illness. 
195 
 
196 
Adverse events in the non-blinded non-randomised phase 
197 
Adverse events of interest: During the non-blinded non-randomised extension phase of ASCOT-
198 
LLA, overall reporting rates for AEOIs were lower than in the blinded phase of the trial.  However, 
199 
muscle-related AEOIs were reported at a higher rate by statin users than by those who were not 
200 
(161 [1·26%pa] vs 124 [0·90%pa]; HR 1·41 [1·10-1·79]; p=0.0059: table 2). The proportional excess 
201 
was similar among patients who had been assigned atorvastatin (HR 1·49 [1·05-2.11]) or placebo 
202 
(HR 1·33 [0·96-1·84]) during the blinded randomised phase (interaction p=0·63). 
203 
 
204 
There were no significant differences between statin users and non-users in the reported rates of 
205 
erectile dysfunction (88 [0·68%pa] vs 99 [0·80%pa]; HR 0·89 [0·66 to 1·20]), sleep disturbance (72 
206 
[0·56%pa] vs 82 [0·66%pa]; HR 0·87 [0·63 to 1·20]) or cognitive impairment (22 [0·17%pa] vs 36 
207 
[0·29%pa]; HR 0·59 [0·34-1·02]: table 2). 
208 
 
209 
There were similar findings in the sensitivity analyses based on definite AEOIs alone or when the 
210 
larger number of possible AEOIs were included (figure 2). A subsidiary analysis of the non-blinded 
211 
comparisons adjusted for baseline characteristics (age, sex, race, smoking, diabetes, left 
212 
ventricular hypertrophy, total cholesterol and systolic blood pressure), had minimal effect on the 
213 
HRs. For muscle-related AEs, the adjusted HR was 1.43 [1.12-1.83]  
214 
 
 
215 
Other adverse events: The rates of reports of all other AEs grouped by SOC categories, were 
216 
similar among the patients who were using and not using statin therapy (table 4), with the 
217 
exception of an excess among statin users of AEs attributed to musculoskeletal and connective 
218 
tissue disorders (992 [8·69%pa] vs 831 [7·45%pa]; HR 1·17 [1·06-1·29]; p=0·0012). There were no 
219 
differences in the rates of serious AEs between users and non-users (supplementary table 5). 
220 
 
221 
Discussion 
222 
The ASCOT-LLA trial provides a unique opportunity to compare the rate of reporting of AEs using  
223 
an identical follow-up procedure and AE ascertainment process in the same individuals during 
224 
blinded randomised  and non-blinded non-randomised statin therapy.   There was no excess of 
225 
reports of muscle-related AEs among patients assigned statin therapy during the blinded 
226 
randomised phase, but there was a significant excess when patients knew that they were taking a 
227 
statin during the subsequent non-blinded phase. This observation is consistent with a “nocebo” 
228 
effect, whereby subjective AEs (e.g., symptoms reported by patients) may be more likely to be 
229 
attributed to a treatment thought to cause some particular side-effect.18 
230 
 
231 
Statin therapy has been shown to cause myopathy (i.e., muscle pain or weakness combined with 
232 
large increases in blood concentrations of creatine kinase) in about 1 per 10,000 patients per year 
233 
of treatment.19 However, in  double-blind randomised trials of statin therapy, muscle-related 
234 
symptoms have generally been reported with similar frequency by patients  assigned statin or 
235 
placebo treatment.  
236 
 
237 
  
6 
 
Although muscle-related problems were not sought systematically in all such  trials, sufficiently 
238 
large numbers of cases have been reported to detect or rule out small excesses.7 For example, a 
239 
meta-analysis of 26 blinded randomised trials found little difference in the  rates of muscle 
240 
problems reported during an average treatment duration of three years: 7,544 cases (12·7%) 
241 
among 59,237 participants assigned statin versus 6,735 (12·4%) among 54,458 assigned placebo.20  
242 
Combination of the reported  results in the large placebo-controlled trials eligible for the 
243 
Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ Collaborative meta-analyses1 yielded similar results: 5,162 (11·7%) 
244 
cases allocated statin therapy versus 5,015 (11·4%) allocated placebo during an average of five 
245 
years of treatment (p=0·10).7, The numbers of cases of muscle-related problems that led to the 
246 
randomised study treatment being stopped were also found to be similar. Consequently, it has 
247 
been estimated that any excess of symptomatic muscle pain or other muscle-related problems 
248 
that is actually caused by statin therapy is likely to be no more than about 0·1-0·2% per year of 
249 
treatment.7  
250 
 
251 
Despite these results from blinded randomised trials, the increasingly widespread use of statins 
252 
has been associated with increasingly common reports of so-called “statin intolerance”6,21 chiefly 
253 
attributed to muscle pain or weakness.6   Indeed, based on non-randomised observational studies 
254 
of statin use in routine care, it has been claimed that as many as one-fifth of patients are not able 
255 
to tolerate statin therapy.5,22  However, patients who are taking a treatment as part of their 
256 
routine care know they are doing so (as do their doctors) and they may also be specifically told 
257 
that the treatment has particular side-effects (e.g. patients given statin therapy are typically 
258 
advised that serious muscle problems can arise rarely).  This inherent lack of blinding in 
259 
observational studies may introduce substantial ascertainment bias, particularly for the 
260 
assessment of the effects of a treatment on substantive outcomes.7,18  The contrast between the 
261 
similarity of the rates of muscle-related symptoms reported during the blinded randomised phase 
262 
of ASCOT-LLA and the excess associated with statin use during the non-blinded non-randomised 
263 
phase illustrates this problem.  Moreover, the present analyses may well under-estimate the 
264 
impact of the nocebo effect because ASCOT-LLA was conducted during 1998-2004, before claims 
265 
that statin therapy causes high rates of side-effects had become as common as they are now. 
266 
 
267 
 
268 
We selected three other categories of AE for scrutiny because the regulatory authorities  had  
269 
added them to the drug label as possible statin side-effects16,17 based largely on  associations in 
270 
observational studies (and despite a general lack of support for such associations in randomised 
271 
trials).7 Unexpectedly, and by contrast with the regulatory concerns, the rate of reports of sleep 
272 
disturbances was reduced by about one third among patients assigned  atorvastatin during the 
273 
blinded randomised phase of ASCOT-LLA ( but not with statin use  during the non-blinded non-
274 
randomised phase).. A beneficial effect of statin use on sleep disturbance has not previously been 
275 
reported,7,23 and it may be that this difference was due to chance (although it  is conventionally 
276 
significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons).  There were also fewer reports of erectile 
277 
dysfunction in ASCOT-LLA among patients assigned atorvastatin during the blinded randomised 
278 
phase, but that difference did not achieve statistical significance (irrespective of whether the 
279 
analyses were restricted to definite cases or included all reported cases). 
280 
 
281 
There were too few reported cases of cognitive impairment during ASCOT-LLA to assess the effects 
282 
of statin therapy reliably. However, specific assessment of this outcome among large numbers of 
283 
older people in the PROSPER and HPS randomised placebo-controlled trials,24,25 as well as in trials 
284 
among people who already had pre-existing cognitive impairment, provides good evidence that 
285 
statin therapy has little effect on memory loss or other measurers of cognitive function.7,13 Most 
286 
  
7 
 
recently, it has been reported that there was no effect of statin therapy on cognitive decline or 
287 
memory loss among the 12,000 patients in the randomised blinded HOPE-3 trial.26 In exploratory 
288 
analyses of all other AE reports grouped according to SOC, we did not find significant differences 
289 
during the blinded randomised phase, with the exception of a small excess of reports of renal and 
290 
urinary disorders in the atorvastatin group which appeared to be related to increased frequency of 
291 
micturition and nocturia. As far as we are aware, such an excess has not previously been reported. 
292 
Given the small number of events on which it is based, the large number of separate comparisons 
293 
made, and their exploratory nature, it may well be that this apparent difference is due to chance.  
294 
 
295 
Our findings were not materially altered when the analyses were based on reports of only those 
296 
AEs that were considered to be definite, or when the larger numbers of probable and possible AEs 
297 
were included (which tend to increase statistical power to detect an effect of a particular size, but 
298 
might decrease sensitivity due to dilution of the treatment effect by including events that are not 
299 
actually the AE of interest). 
300 
  
301 
The ASCOT trial was conducted in a hypertensive population in the UK, Ireland and the Nordic 
302 
countries among patients who were predominately aged over 60 years, male and of European 
303 
ancestry. It seems likely that the findings would  be generalisable to younger and older patients, 
304 
(particularly given the results from other blinded randomised trials in such individuals), but it may 
305 
not be generalisable to people from other ethnic groups.   Atorvastatin at a daily dose of 10mg 
306 
was studied specifically only in the blinded phase of the trial, but most of the patients in the open 
307 
phase who took a statin used the same dose of atorvastatin, with only a few using simvastatin. 
308 
Atorvastatin  10mg daily would now be considered a relatively low dose, but randomised trials of 
309 
higher doses have also not found differences in muscle-related  AEs, other than the very small 
310 
excess of myopathy (as described above).  
311 
 
312 
The widespread media coverage that has been engendered by claims that statin therapy causes 
313 
side effects in up to one fifth of patients,5,27 and the failure to correct such misleading claims 
314 
rapidly and properly has led to high risk patients with established cardiovascular disease stopping 
315 
their statin therapy.28,29 It has been estimated that such reductions in statin use may result in 
316 
thousands of fatal and disabling heart attacks and strokes occurring, that would otherwise have 
317 
been avoided. Seldom in the history of modern therapeutics have the substantial proven benefits 
318 
of a treatment been compromised to such an extent by serious misrepresentations of the 
319 
evidence about its safety. We hope that the demonstration in ASCOT-LLA of not only the lack of 
320 
adverse effects of statin therapy on muscle-related and other AEs, but also the impact of 
321 
ascertainment bias in non-blinding studies (which have been the basis of many of the misleading 
322 
claims) will help to counter the adverse effect on public health of exaggerated claims about statin 
323 
side-effects. 
324 
 
325 
Role of the funding source 
326 
ASCOT was conceived, designed and coordinated by an investigator-led independent Steering 
327 
Committee with two non-voting members from the principal funding source (Pfizer Inc).  Data 
328 
analyses and preparation of all reports were conducted independently of the funding sources.

Adjudication Definitions 
Myalgia 
 
1: Possible 
 
2: Probable 
 
3: Definite 
 
- 
Poorly localised complaints 
suspicious for potential 
myalgia (incl. tiredness, 
fatigue, lassitude, weakness, 
loss of power or physical 
strength) 
- 
Also included are areas such as 
shoulder, unilateral limb 
symptoms, descriptions 
affecting small individual 
muscles or muscle groups e.g. 
suprascapularis, or 
descriptions affecting unlikely 
areas e.g. groin. 
- 
Exclusions: chest pain, non 
cardiac chest pain,  
‘musculoskeletal chest pain’, 
thoracic pain, abdominal pain, 
headache, lower back pain, 
neck pain, hand and foot pain, 
claudication and claudication-
equivalent descriptions 
 
- 
Complaints  well-localised to a 
large, muscular area that are 
reasonably likely to represent 
pain but have not specifically 
used pain or pain-equivalent 
terms, or are present with 
bilaterality, or affect large 
continuous body regions. 
- 
Muscular areas include: 
bilateral limbs, bilateral 
shoulders, large continuous 
areas of torso and/or limbs. 
- 
Terminology includes: muscle 
fatigue, muscle tiredness, 
muscle weakness 
- 
Exclusions: chest pain, non 
cardiac chest pain,  
‘musculoskeletal chest pain’, 
thoracic pain, abdominal pain, 
headache, lower back pain, 
neck pain, hand and foot pain, 
claudication and claudication-
equivalent descriptions 
 
- 
Pain or pain-equivalent term 
described as muscular or 
referring to a specified muscle.  
If the AE  specifically 
mentions ‘myalgia’ this is 
included automatically,  but 
excludes back, neck, hands, 
feet. 
- 
Pain equivalent terms: ache, 
spasm, cramp, dolor, myositis 
- 
Examples: myalgia, muscle 
pain, muscle cramp, calf ache, 
thigh pain, polymyalgia, 
polymyalgia rheumatica, 
fibromyalgia. 
Excludions: chest pain, non 
cardiac chest pain,  
‘musculoskeletal chest pain’, 
thoracic pain, abdominal pain, 
headache, lower back pain, 
neck pain, hand and foot pain, 
claudication and claudication-
equivalent descriptions

are concerning for potential 
cognitive decline 
e.g. delerium, confusion 
Depression and  low mood 
excluded 
 
Clear reporting of symptoms or 
behavioural patterns likely 
suggestive of cognitive 
impairment 
e.g. Memory trouble, 
forgetfulness, difficulty with tasks 
such as reading, slowness of 
thought 
Depression and  low mood 
excluded 
 
Clear medical or diagnostic 
terminology reporting confirmed 
deficits in memory, concentration, 
planning, decision making 
e.g. Memory disorder, dementia 
Depression and  low mood 
excluded 
Symptoms or events reported that 
are concerning for potential 
cognitive decline 
e.g. delerium, confusion 
 Depression and  low mood 
excluded 
 
Erectile Dysfunction 
1: Possible 
 
2: Probable 
 
3: Definitive 
 
 
Complaints of sexual disturbance 
E.g. sexual dysfunction 
 
Symptoms more clearly suggestive 
of ED 
E.g. Loss of libido 
 
Impotence, erectile dysfunction
