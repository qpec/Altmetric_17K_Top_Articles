New and Evolving Treatment Goals in Multiple 
Sclerosis – the Role of Teriflunomide

eriflunomide is an oral immunotherapy agent that acts primarily as an inhibitor of dihydroorotate-dehydrogenase (DHODH), a key 
mitochondrial enzyme involved in the synthesis of pyrimidines in rapidly proliferating cells such as T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, 
thus attenuating the inflammatory response to auto-antigens. The TEMSO and TOWER phase III clinical studies have demonstrated 
the efficacy and safety of teriflunomide in the first-line treatment of patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS), with long-term follow-up 
data available up to 9 years. Teriflunomide has also been shown to decrease the risk of conversion to clinically definite MS (CDMS) in patients 
with a first clinical sign of MS or risk of conversion to CDMS after a clinically isolated syndrome. In addition to reducing disability progression 
and relapse rate, teriflunomide has also been found to decrease imaging activity and is associated with significant reductions in brain volume 
loss. The convenience of administration of teriflunomide should establish its role within the growing number of treatment options for MS.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive disease of the central nervous system (CNS), 
resulting from inflammatory lesions that become sites of demyelination and axonal injury. 
These lesions are associated with infiltrating T cells and monocytes, as well as B cells and 
plasma cells.1 Treatment of MS presents a challenge, since disease-modifying treatments 
(DMTs) must limit immune responses associated with disease initiation and propagation 
while also minimising any adverse effect on normal protective immune function. Enhanced 
understanding of the roles of T and B lymphocytes in the pathophysiology of relapsing MS have 
facilitated new approaches to managing MS with markedly improved efficacy.2,3 Treatment 
goals have changed: halting disability progression and promoting some degree of functional 
improvement are becoming achievable for many patients.3–5 The burden of treatment has also 
been decreased with the approval of a number of oral DMTs for relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS).6 
Teriflunomide (Aubagio® Sanofi-Genzyme, Massachusetts, US) is an oral immunomodulatory 
agent that selectively targets T and B cells and has been approved both in the US and in Europe 
for the treatment of RRMS.7,8 This article will discuss the clinical evidence for the efficacy and 
safety of teriflunomide in MS, as well as clarifying the role of teriflunomide in the context of 
current and emerging MS treatment options. 
Teriflunomide in the treatment of multiple sclerosis 
Teriflunomide is the active metabolite of the parent drug, leflunomide, which has been in clinical 
use for many years as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.9 Following oral ingestion, leflunomide 
is rapidly converted almost entirely into teriflunomide. The latter has been found to have highly 
effective immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties.7 Its precise effect of reducing 
 
T and B cells on the pathophysiology of MS has not been fully elucidated but is related to its action 
on the proliferation of activated lymphocytes. Teriflunomide selectively and reversibly inhibits 
the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase in de novo pyrimidine synthesis, 
halting cell division in cells such as autoreactive T- and B-lymphocytes in MS and limiting their 
involvement in the inflammatory processes underlying MS.10-15 Mean reductions of white blood 
cell counts of around 15% occur during the first 6 weeks of teriflunomide initiation and persist 
during treatment, although mean absolute counts remain within the normal range for most 
patients.18 A similar reduction has been reported for dimethyl fumarate (DMF).16 Cells that do not 
proliferate in response to activation, e.g. resting lymphocytes, can divide through homeostatic 
proliferation in which pyrimidines are synthesised by means of the salvage pathway.10,11 
As a result of teriflunomide action, fewer autoreactive T- and B-lymphocytes cross the blood–
brain barrier into the CNS but there is no apparent effect on the viability of stimulated T or B cells, 
a limited impact on lymphocyte activation and no direct effects on DNA.10,17,18
The impact of teriflunomide on adaptive immune cell subsets in humans was recently 
demonstrated in the TERI-DYNAMIC study:19 patients (n=39) with RRMS received teriflunomide 
14 mg once daily for 24 weeks. From baseline to week 12 and week 24, the proportion of CD19+

B cells and absolute counts of Th1 cells decreased and the proportion 
of CD4+ cells versus CD8+ cytotoxic cells increased. Results also 
showed that teriflunomide decreases clonal diversity, which provides 
an immunomodulatory action without impairing immune function.19 
Clinical evidence for the efficacy of 
teriflunomide
Two multicentre, multinational, randomised double-blind parallel-arm, 
placebo-controlled studies, TEMSO20 and TOWER,21 have examined the 
efficacy and safety of teriflunomide 14 mg and 7 mg/day in patients with 
MS. The study designs and baseline characteristics were similar in both 
trials; patients had relapsing MS, were between the ages of 18 and 55 
years old, had Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores ≤5.5, and 
at least two clinical relapses in the preceding 2 years, or at least one 
relapse in the previous year. Patients were randomised to teriflunomide 
14 mg or 7 mg/day or placebo once daily for 108 weeks (Table 1). 
 
In the TEMSO and TOWER studies, compared with placebo, teriflunomide 
reduced the annualised relapse rate (ARR) relative risk by 32% (p<0.001) 
and 36% (p=0.0001), for 14 mg and 7 mg respectively. Results showed 
29.8% (p=0.028) and 31.5% (p=0.044) relative risk reductions for 14 mg 
teriflunomide versus placebo for confirmed disability progression in the 
TEMSO and TOWER studies, respectively (Figure 1).20,21 In the TEMSO study, 
teriflunomide 14 mg treatment resulted in a 67.4% relative reduction in 
new T2 lesion volume (p<0.001)20,24 and an 80.4% reduction in the number 
of gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing T1 lesions per scan at week 108.24 
Recently, long-term data from TEMSO has been released: no new 
or unexpected adverse events (AEs) occurred in patients receiving 
teriflunomide for up to 9 years. Disease activity decreased in patients 
switching from placebo and remained low in patients continuing 
 
on teriflunomide.25
In the TOWER study extension, the improvement in disability progression 
has been sustained up to 5.5 years. A mean change in EDSS from baseline 
of <0.15 points26 and the median EDSS was in the range 2.0–2.5 at all time 
points.27 Similar control of disability progression has also been observed 
in the TEMSO long-term extension study.28
A post-hoc analysis of pooled data from both the TEMSO and TOWER studies 
showed that ARR was reduced by 33.7% with teriflunomide 14 mg versus 
placebo (p<0.0001) and by 27.0% with teriflunomide 7 mg versus placebo 
(p<0.0001). Confirmed disability progression was reduced by 30.5% with 
teriflunomide 14 mg (p=0.0029 versus placebo). However, teriflunomide 
7 mg did not show a significant effect on disability progression.29
Teriflunomide has also been investigated in MS at different disease 
stages. The TOPIC study was a phase III clinical trial that evaluated the 
efficacy of teriflunomide in preventing conversion to clinically definite 
MS (CDMS) in patients with first demyelinating events suggestive of 
MS.30 Patients (n=618) with clinically isolated syndrome (defined as 
a neurological event consistent with demyelination, starting within 
90 days of randomisation, and two or more T2-weighted magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) lesions ≥3 mm in diameter) were randomised 
to once-daily oral teriflunomide 14 mg, teriflunomide 7 mg, or placebo. 
At 108 weeks, teriflunomide (14 mg) decreased the risk of conversion 
to CDMS by 42.6% versus placebo (p=0.0087), as well reduced the risk 
of another relapse or new MRI lesion by 34.9% (p=0.0003) compared 
with placebo.30 Teriflunomide 14 mg reduced risk in the number and 
volume of Gd-enhancing lesions by 58.5% (p=0.0008). Teriflunomide 
 
7 mg decreased conversion to CDMS by 37.2% versus placebo (p=0.0271) 
and the risk of recurrent relapse or new MRI lesion formation by 31.4% 
versus placebo (p=0.0020), and reduced the number but not the volume 
of Gd-enhancing lesions.30

 New and Evolving Treatment Goals in Multiple Sclerosis – the Role of Teriflunomide
39
EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
To gain a better understanding of the clinical implications of the results 
of the phase III pivotal teriflunomide studies, compared with those of 
other disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) pivotal phase III trials, it is 
useful to calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) to benefit one 
patient.31 This takes into account not only the treatment effect, but also 
the rarity of the event in question (e.g., relapse); thus, a higher NNT 
would be expected if fewer patients experienced the event in the time 
period of interest. There has been a downward trend in MS relapse rates 
over the past decade, making it difficult to compare studies conducted 
at different times. A post-hoc analysis found that the absolute ARR 
reductions for TEMSO and TOWER were –0.17 and –0.18, and NNTs were 
5.9 and 5.6, respectively.32 This was similar to findings of the two pivotal 
studies of DMF 240 mg (DEFINE33 [Determination of the Efficacy and 
Safety of Oral Fumarate in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis] and 
CONFIRM34 [Comparator and an Oral Fumarate in Relapsing-Remitting 
Multiple Sclerosis]) in which the relapse rates were also significantly 
reduced versus placebo. The absolute ARR reductions for DEFINE and 
CONFIRM were –0.19 and –0.18 and NNTs were 5.3 and 5.6, respectively. 
This similarity in NNTs was observed despite a higher relative relapse 
risk reduction for DMF compared with teriflunomide.35 In the TEMSO, 
TOWER, DEFINE and CONFIRM studies, the NNTs for prevention of 
disease progression were 13.8, 17.4, 10.8, and 30.2, respectively. These 
data suggest a potentially greater treatment effect of teriflunomide. 
However, it should be noted that there was a low number of relapses 
in the DMF studies, which may confound this comparison. In an 
analysis of pivotal studies of DMF, fingolimod and teriflunomide, NNTs 
to prevent any relapse, more severe relapses (such as those leading to 
hospitalisation or requiring intravenous corticosteroids), and disability 
worsening. were similar for DMF and teriflunomide, and marginally 
lower for fingolimod.32
Another post-hoc analysis of TEMSO found that teriflunomide reduced 
relapses leading to hospitalisation (by 36% in the 7 mg group [p=0.015] 
and 59% in the 14 mg group [p<0.0001]) and intravenous corticosteroid 
use versus placebo (29% [p=0.001]; 34% [p=0.0003]) and also that 
teriflunomide-treated patients spent fewer nights in hospital for relapses 
(p<0.01). In addition, teriflunomide reduced the annualised rate of all 
hospitalisations (p=0.01) and emergency room visits (p=0.004). This may 
translate to reduced healthcare costs.36
A further demonstration of teriflunomide efficacy was the achievement 
of no evidence disease activity (NEDA) status during the core phase of 
the TEMSO study.37 NEDA was defined as no Gd-enhancing T1 lesions or 
new/enlarging T2 lesions, and no clinical relapse or 12-week sustained 
disability progression. In Year 1 significantly more patients receiving 
teriflunomide achieved NEDA than those receiving placebo (33.1% 
versus 19.4%, p<0.0001). In Year 2 this difference was maintained (35.3% 
and 21.2%, respectively, p=0.0002).37 These data support the continued 
efficacy benefits of ongoing treatment with teriflunomide.
While clinical measures of efficacy are essential, patient-reported 
outcomes are also important in establishing the usefulness of a drug in 
routine clinical practice. The improvement in disability from the patients’ 
perspective has been investigated in the phase IV, single-arm, open-label 
TeriPRO study (n=1,001).38 Patients receiving teriflunomide indicated 
disability level during the past month in eight domains of the Multiple 
Sclerosis Performance Scales (MSPS). In a 6-month, interim analysis, 
52.8% reported an improvement, 10.2% reported no change and 37.0% 
reported worsening. There were improvements reported for domains of 
mobility, hand function and vision. A 6-month interim analysis showed 
that at baseline 41.3% of patients reported normal/minimal disability 
due to cognitive symptoms; after 6 months of teriflunomide treatment 
this had increased to 48.1%. In patients switching from another DMT 
within 6 months of enrolment, mean TSQM (Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire for Medication) Global Satisfaction score was 74.9, a 22.7- 
point improvement compared with baseline.38
 
Effect of teriflunomide on brain volume
There is increasing interest in brain volume (BV) atrophy and its effects on 
disability in MS, largely due to wider adoption of protocols that specify its 
measurement. In the MRI investigations of the TEMSO study, an analysis 
using the SIENA (Structural Image Evaluation using Normalization 
of Atrophy) protocol revealed significant treatment effects.39 With 
teriflunomide 14 mg, there was a 39.6% reduction in BV loss after 1 year 
(p<0.0001) and 30.6% reduction after 2 years (p<0.0001) versus placebo 
(Figure 2). Median BV was reduced by 0.39% with teriflunomide and 0.61% 
with placebo after 1 year and by 0.90% and 1.29% after 2 years (p=0.0001 
for both comparisons). These findings using an established measure of 
brain tissue loss, are consistent with the effects of teriflunomide on 
delaying disability progression.
Safety findings of studies of teriflunomide
The safety profile of teriflunomide is based on a population of over 5,000 
patients, mostly with RRMS.27 A pooled analysis of TEMSO, TOWER, and

EUROPEAN NEUROLOGICAL REVIEW
TOPIC study data investigated the effect of teriflunomide on lymphocyte 
and neutrophil counts.40 The mean lymphocyte and neutrophil counts 
decreased during the first 6 or 12 weeks of treatment versus placebo. 
After the initial treatment period, levels remained stable (Figure 3) and 
were well above the lower limit of normal, suggesting preserved immune 
function. Neutrophil and lymphocyte count decreases were mostly mild 
to moderate (Grade 1–2).41 There was no association between infection 
and decreased lymphocyte counts in all three clinical studies.
Infection rates were similar for patients receiving teriflunomide 14 mg 
versus placebo (52.7% versus 53.4% for any infection and 2.7% versus 
2.2% for any serious infection).41,42 Two serious opportunistic infections 
occurred in the teriflunomide 14 mg group.43 One patient experienced 
gastrointestinal tuberculosis, leading to permanent discontinuation of 
treatment. Another patient developed hepatitis with cytomegalovirus 
infection, again leading to treatment discontinuation. Two patients died 
as a result of infections: one was in the placebo group (respiratory tract 
infection) and one in the teriflunomide 14 mg group (gram-negative 
bacterial sepsis).43
The overall incidence of AEs was similar for teriflunomide 14 mg 
and placebo (Table 2).41,42 The frequencies of all AEs for teriflunomide 
and placebo were 88.3% and 85.6%, respectively. Serious AEs were 
reported in 13.3% and 11.9%, respectively. The distribution of mild, 
moderate and severe AEs was also similar between teriflunomide and 
placebo. The most common AEs reported with teriflunomide were: 
hair thinning, diarrhoea, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase, 
nausea, and headache; the majority resolved on treatment. A low 
incidence of malignancy (≤0.4%) was observed in all treatment groups, 
with no unusual pattern of malignancy, including haematological 
malignancies and lymphoproliferative tumours.41 The most common 
reason for treatment discontinuation in all treatment groups was ALT 
elevation, reflecting the labelling indication to discontinue treatment 
on confirmation of ALT >3-times the upper limit of normal (ULN). 
The proportion of patients with hepatic disorders was higher in the 
teriflunomide groups (14 mg, 21.5%; 7 mg, 19.8%; placebo, 15.2%), 
largely due to transient and reversible ALT increases ≤3-times the ULN.41 
Follow-up for 12 years in the phase II study showed the types of AEs 
were similar to those of the placebo-controlled studies.44
 
Preservation of protective immunity after teriflunomide has been 
addressed by the TERIVA (teriflunomide and vaccination) study, which 
investigated the effects of influenza vaccination patients with RRMS.45 At 
28 days post vaccination, the proportions treated with 14 mg teriflunomide 
who had a ≥40 titre to influenza antigens H1N1, H2N3 and B were: 97.4%, 
76.9% and 97.4%, respectively. These proportions in patients treated with 
IFNβ-1a were 97.7%, 90.7% and 93.0%, respectively. These responses 
were all above the European Medicines Agency (EMA)-defined threshold 
for efficacy of influenza vaccination in 18- to 60-year-olds.46
 
No signals for teratogenicity have been reported in the teriflunomide 
clinical trial database. In a 2014 report, no structural or functional deficits 
had been reported in 83 patients who had taken teriflunomide during 
pregnancies leading to live births and 22 pregnancies in partners of male 
patients.47 Median birth weight, for 18 newborns, was 3.3 kg, and mean 
gestational age, documented in 23 cases, was 39 weeks (range 36–44 
weeks). All newborns were healthy and did not have any structural or 
functional abnormalities at birth. The spontaneous abortion rate in 
teriflunomide-exposed patients was 18.6%,47 within the range reported 
for the general population.48
In a further study on healthy human subjects (n=46), teriflunomide 
produced no notable impact on immune response to recall antigens 
(Candida albicans, Trichophyton, and tuberculin) or neoantigens (rabies 
vaccine) versus placebo.49 
Discussion and Conclusion 
Continuing advances in the management of MS have markedly raised 
the bar in treatment goals in recent years. It is now possible to stabilise 
disability progression and even reverse it. Selective targeting of T and B 
cells has proven to be a successful strategy in MS treatment. The oral 
treatment, teriflunomide, can be used as a first-line therapy in MS. This 
drug depletes autoreactive T and B cells but does not eliminate precursor 
or non-autoreactive cells. Decreased inflammation in neuronal tissue is 
accompanied by normal immune function allowing continued immune 
responses to infection and vaccination. 
The selective action of teriflunomide is reflected in efficacy and safety 
findings from up to 12-years in a clinical development programme 
involving over 5,000 patients that showed effective control of MS 
symptoms and progression, and the risk of infection was little different 
to either placebo or a comparator treatment interferon beta-1a (IFNβ-
1a). Teriflunomide treatment has yielded significant reductions in BV 
loss compared with placebo or comparator in the TEMSO study. Interim 
analyses show improvements in cognition and studies are ongoing to 
further explore this effect. 
The role of teriflunomide among the growing number of treatment options 
for MS is unclear. In the absence of head-to-head trials, its efficacy relative 
to other first-line parenteral agents is unknown, but phase III clinical trial

data suggest its efficacy is similar to existing injected agents. Its efficacy 
appears to be lower than that of other oral agents such as fingolimod 
but its ease of use and favourable safety profile compared to fingolimod 
make it an attractive treatment option. However, the convenience of oral 
administration, as well as safety and tolerability, should lead to more 
widespread use. The use of an oral drug such as teriflunomide may improve 
adherence and reduce lifestyle restrictions associated with injected 
therapies. Further studies are needed to determine the optimum sequence 
of administering teriflunomide and existing therapies and whether it 
can be used in combination with other agents. There is also a need to 
identify the ideal responder profile to teriflunomide. Individual genetic or 
clinical features might predict an optimal response to teriflunomide for 
a patient at particular stage of the disease. The mechanism of action of 
teriflunomide suggests that it may be most effective between the early 
and the relapsing–remitting stage of MS, when immune and inflammatory 
processes need to be controlled.11
In conclusion, there is a need for further clinical data as well as 
postmarketing studies to fully define the role of teriflunomide among the 
MS treatment armamentarium.
