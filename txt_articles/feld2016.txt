Abstract (word count: 248/250) 
Background: Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and cirrhosis have higher risk for 
liver-related complications and have historically been more difficult to cure than patients without 
cirrhosis. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir, 
without ribavirin, for 12 weeks in patients with HCV GT1b infection and compensated cirrhosis. 
Methods: Treatment-naïve and peginterferon/ribavirin treatment-experienced patients received 12 
weeks of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir (25/150/100 mg once daily) and dasabuvir (250 mg twice 
daily). Key inclusion criteria were hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL, albumin ≥2.8 g/dL, platelet count ≥25 x 109/L, 
creatinine clearance ≥30 ml/min, and Child-Pugh score ≤6. Efficacy was assessed by the percentage of 
patients achieving SVR (HCV RNA <25 IU/mL) 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12). Efficacy and safety were 
assessed in all patients receiving study drug. 
Results: Sixty patients with HCV GT1b infection and cirrhosis received treatment. The study population 
comprised 62% male, 55% treatment-experienced, 83% with IL28B non-CC genotype, 22% with platelet 
count <90 x 109/L, and 17% with albumin <3.5 g/dL. All 60 patients completed treatment, and SVR12 was 
achieved in 100% (95% CI, 94.0 – 100%) of patients. The most common adverse events were fatigue 
(22%), diarrhea (20%), and headache (18%). Only one patient (1.7%) experienced a serious adverse 
event. Laboratory abnormalities were infrequently observed and not clinically significant. 
Conclusions: The HCV regimen of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir without ribavirin for 
12 weeks achieved 100% SVR12 and was well tolerated in HCV GT1b-infected patients with cirrhosis, 
suggesting that this 12-week ribavirin-free regimen is sufficient in this population.

INTRODUCTION 
Among 7 recognized genotypes (GTs) of hepatitis C virus (HCV), GT1 is the most common HCV infection, 
accounting for 46 – 60% of cases worldwide [1, 2]. Subgenotype 1b encompasses approximately 68% of 
all GT1 infections and is the most prevalent subgenotype in Europe, Central America, Middle East, and 
Asia. Patients with chronic HCV infection and cirrhosis are at greatest risk for progression to 
decompensation, end-stage liver disease and disease-related death, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver 
transplantation [3]. As a result, the recommendations from the American Association for the Study of 
Liver Diseases (AASLD), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and the European Association for 
the Study of the Liver (EASL) prioritize these patients for treatment [4, 5]; however, achieving a 
sustained virologic response (SVR) has been more challenging in patients with cirrhosis. First-generation 
protease inhibitors in combination with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and ribavirin (RBV) achieved low 
rates of response in these patients (33 – 77%), in part due to significant toxicities leading to drug 
discontinuation [6-8]. New IFN-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapies have greatly improved SVR 
rates in patients with cirrhosis, nonetheless, rates are still lower than in patients without cirrhosis [9-13]. 
Furthermore, longer treatment and/or the addition of RBV has been required with most regimens to 
maximize SVR rates in patients with cirrhosis [9, 11, 12, 14, 15]. As the prevalence and burden of HCV 
cirrhosis is projected to increase significantly in the coming years [16, 17], treatments that optimize SVR 
in patients with cirrhosis are greatly needed. 
Ombitasvir (OBV) is an NS5A inhibitor co-formulated with the NS3/4A protease inhibitor paritaprevir 
(PTV) and the pharmacokinetic enhancer ritonavir (r), which increases peak and trough drug exposures 
allowing for once daily PTV dosing [18]. Administered with the non-nucleoside NS5B polymerase 
inhibitor dasabuvir (DSV), this multi-targeted 3-DAA regimen with or without RBV is approved in many 
countries to treat HCV GT1 infection. Approval for the treatment of HCV GT1 patients with compensated 
cirrhosis was based on the evidence of a phase 3 trial of 380 patients with compensated cirrhosis in 
   
Feld et al_TURQUOISE-III Primary_Response_tracked 20151002 
6 
 
which OBV/PTV/r and DSV plus RBV achieved SVR rates at post-treatment week 12 (SVR12) of 91.8% and 
95.9% after 12 or 24 weeks of therapy, respectively [9]. SVR12 rates were 98.5% (67/68) in those 
infected with GT1b receiving 12 weeks of treatment, and 100% (51/51) following 24 weeks of treatment. 
In that study, all patients received RBV, leading to the treatment recommendation of OBV/PTV/r and 
DSV plus RBV for 12 weeks in patients with GT1b infection and cirrhosis [4, 5, 19]. However, RBV is not 
required in GT1b-infected patients without cirrhosis in whom 100% SVR12 was achieved in 301 patients 
who received OBV/PTV/r and DSV without RBV for 12 weeks [20-22] and the high rates of SVR achieved 
in those with compensated cirrhosis raises the question of whether RBV is necessary for GT1b-infected 
patients with cirrhosis. Eliminating RBV in this population with cirrhosis without sacrificing efficacy is 
expected to improve the safety profile, particularly with respect to anemia and hyperbilirubinemia. 
We report the results of the TURQUOISE-III phase 3b, open-label study designed to assess the safety and 
efficacy of OBV/PTV/r and DSV without RBV for 12 weeks in adults with chronic HCV GT1b infection and 
compensated cirrhosis, both with or without prior treatment experience with pegIFN/RBV.

PATIENTS AND METHODS 
Study Patients. Patients 18 years or older were eligible for enrollment if they had HCV genotype 1b 
infection for at least 6 months prior to screening, or an HCV RNA of >1,000 IU/mL at the time of 
screening with a liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection. Eligible patients had documented 
cirrhosis by means of liver biopsy (Metavir score >3 or Ishak score of >4) or transient elastography 
(FibroScan score ≥12.5 kPa within 6 months of screening or during screening), and a Child-Pugh score of 
5 or 6 with no evidence of decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma. Those with a positive test 
result for hepatitis B or human immunodeficiency virus were excluded. Laboratory eligibility criteria 
were a serum albumin ≥2.8 g/dL, calculated creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min, hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL, 
platelet count ≥25 × 109/L, total bilirubin ≤3.0 mg/dL, and an international normalized ratio (INR) ≤1.8. 
Treatment-experienced patients were allowed with documented treatment failure with pegIFN/RBV at 
least 2 months prior to screening; prior treatment experience with any DAA or investigational agent was 
not permitted. More detailed eligibility criteria are provided in the online supplement. 
Study Design. All patients in this phase 3b, open-label study were assigned to receive 12 weeks of 
OBV/PTV/r and DSV without RBV. Co-formulated OBV/PTV/r was administered once daily (25/150/100 
mg) and DSV 250 mg twice daily. Patients were followed up to 24 weeks post-treatment. Written 
informed consent was obtained from each patient and the study protocol conformed to the ethical 
guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in a priori approval by the institutional review 
board of each study site.  
Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetic Assessments. Plasma samples collected at screening and each 
study visit were processed by a central laboratory for HCV RNA levels using the Roche TaqMan real-time 
reverse transcriptase-PCR assay version 2.0. Efficacy was assessed by the percentage of patients with 
SVR12, defined as an HCV RNA below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ = 25 IU/mL) 12 weeks after 
   
Feld et al_TURQUOISE-III Primary_Response_tracked 20151002

last dose of study drug. The first primary endpoint was non-inferiority of the SVR12 rates achieved with 
OBV/PTV/r and DSV for 12 weeks to the historical SVR12 rate achieved by sofosbuvir plus pegIFN/RBV in 
HCV GT1b-infected patients with cirrhosis (73.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 59.8 – 83.2%). Non-
inferiority of the 3-DAA regimen could be claimed if the SVR12 95% CI lower limit was greater than the 
upper limit of the CI for the historical rate minus a 10.5% noninferiority margin (72.7%). The second 
primary endpoint was superiority of the 3-DAA SVR12 rate to the historical SVR12 rate for sofosbuvir 
plus pegIFN/RBV in this patient population (83.2%). Secondary assessments included the percentage of 
patients with on-treatment virologic failure, and post-treatment relapse. Further details of historical 
non-inferiority calculations are provided in the online supplement.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were collected from the start of study-drug administration 
until 30 days after the last dose and were assessed by the investigators for relation to study drug and 
severity. Serious AEs were collected from the time of signed consent until 30 days after last study-drug 
dose. Clinical laboratory chemistry and hematology tests were assessed throughout the study. 
Blood samples were collected at baseline for IL28B (IFNL4-rs12979860) genotyping.[23] Blood samples 
for the pharmacokinetic assessment of the study drugs were collected at treatment weeks 2, 4, 8, and 
12. Plasma concentrations of OBV, PTV, r, DSV, and DSV M1 metabolite were determined using a 
validated liquid chromatography method with tandem mass spectrometric detection with LLOQ of 
0.462, 0.601, 4.93, 4.58, and 4.77 ng/mL, respectively. Drug concentrations summarized as trough levels 
(Ctrough) were binned based on sample collection time within the 22 – 26 hour or 10 – 14 hour bins for 
once or twice daily drugs, respectively. 
Statistical Analyses. Efficacy and safety analyses were performed using all patients receiving at least one 
dose of study drug. The 2-sided 95% CIs for binomial proportions were calculated using the Wilson score 
method. With a sample size of 60 patients, an observed SVR12 rate of 90% (95% CI 79.9 – 95.3%) would 
   
Feld et al_TURQUOISE-III Primary_Response_tracked 20151002 
9 
 
provide >90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority to the historical sofosbuvir plus pegIFN/RBV rate. 
An interim analysis was planned after all patients reached post-treatment week 12 or prematurely 
discontinued the study. SAS (SAS Institute) for the UNIX operating system was used for all analyses.

RESULTS  
Baseline Patient Demographics and Characteristics. Screening of patients occurred from September 19, 
2014 through November 28, 2014 at 19 sites in the United States, Canada, and Belgium. Of 72 patients 
screened, 12 did not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria; 60 were enrolled and received study drug. 
Demographics and disease characteristics are presented in Table 1. The majority of patients had prior 
treatment experience with pegIFN/RBV, and had IL28B (IFNL4-rs12979860)[23] non-CC genotype. At 
baseline, 19 (31.7%) patients had surrogate markers for portal hypertension and/or hepatic synthetic 
dysfunction: 13 had baseline thrombocytopenia (platelet count <90 × 109/L), 10 had baseline 
hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin <3.5 g/dL), and 4 had both surrogate markers. Of 41 patients enrolled 
with a cirrhosis determination by FibroScan, 20 had baseline scores of >20 kPa. 
Efficacy Outcomes. All 60 patients completed 12 weeks of treatment with OBV/PTV/r and DSV. Rapid 
serum HCV RNA decline was observed with 61.7% of patients (37/60) below LLOQ at treatment week 2, 
and 100% (60/60) below LLOQ by week 4 through the end of treatment. After 12 weeks of treatment, 
100% (95% CI, 94.0 – 100%) of patients achieved SVR12 (Fig. 1.). Thus, the SVR12 rate of OBV/PTV/r and 
DSV was both non-inferior and superior to the historical rate achieved with sofosbuvir plus pegIFN/RBV 
in GT1b-infected patients with cirrhosis.  
All baseline patient characteristics that have historically been predictive of poor response to treatment, 
including those identified in HCV GT1 patients with cirrhosis treated with OBV/PTV/r and DSV plus RBV 
(prior null response to pegIFN/RBV and former injection-drug use [9]), had no impact on SVR12 rates. 
Similarly, baseline laboratory abnormalities or measures of liver disease severity associated with 
reduced SVR12 rates with IFN and/or DAA-containing regimens, including serum albumin, platelet count, 
alpha fetoprotein, interferon-γ inducible protein 10, and FibroScan score did not influence the 100% 
SVR12 rate achieved.

Improvement in Laboratory Assessments. Liver enzyme mean values rapidly declined by week 2 of 
treatment. Aminotransferases were normalized at the end of treatment in 45/53 (84.9%) patients with 
elevated baseline alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and 41/55 (74.5%) patients with elevated aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST). Mean improvements in laboratory values at post-treatment week 12 were also 
observed for albumin (+0.31 g/dL), alpha fetoprotein (-24.0 ng/mL), total bilirubin (-0.3 mg/dL), and 
FibroTest (-0.16). 
Safety Outcomes. The majority of patients had AEs (76.7%; Table 2), though no patient discontinued the 
study. The most common AEs were fatigue in 13 (21.7%) patients, diarrhea in 12 (20.0%) patients, and 
headache in 11 (18.3%) patients. Of these patients, 8 with fatigue, 6 with diarrhea, and 6 with headache 
had events assessed as possibly related to study drug. Most AEs were mild or moderate, and only 1 
patient experienced a severe event (Table 2). This patient experienced serious events of acute 
hypotension and syncope secondary to hypotension requiring hospitalization on day 2. At study start, 
this patient was taking metoprolol, lisinopril, and nisoldipine to treat hypertension. Due to CYP3A4 
inhibition by ritonavir possibly leading to increased nisoldipine exposures, a 50% dosage adjustment to 
nisoldipine was recommended prior to study start, but was not initiated. Following the serious events, 
nisoldipine was discontinued with concurrent lisinopril dose increase, which stabilized the patient’s 
blood pressure. Study drug was interrupted from day 3 – 8, whereupon treatment was re-initiated and 
this patient achieved SVR12.  
Post-baseline laboratory abnormalities were infrequent, not clinically significant, and no grade 4 
abnormalities were observed (Table 2). Total bilirubin elevations were the most common laboratory 
abnormalities observed occurring in 12 (20.0%) patients. Hyperbilirubinemia was primarily attributed to 
increases in indirect bilirubin, consistent with the inhibition of the organic anion-transporting protein 
1B1 and 1B3 by paritaprevir, and were not accompanied by concurrent aminotransferase elevations. 
   
Feld et al_TURQUOISE-III Primary_Response_tracked 20151002

Seven of the 12 patients experiencing post-baseline grade 2 elevations in total bilirubin had 
abnormalities at baseline, including 4 with grade 2 total bilirubin elevations. The highest total bilirubin 
value observed during treatment in any patient was 3.0 mg/dL (1.6 mg/dL indirect bilirubin). One patient 
experienced a grade 2 hemoglobin decline (9.9 g/dL) at week 12; this male patient had a baseline 
hemoglobin level of 11.3 g/dL, below the lower limit of normal. Aminotransferase elevations were 
observed in 1 patient. This 77-year old woman had asymptomatic coincident grade 3 ALT and grade 2 
AST elevations at day 16 that decreased at the next study visit and normalized during the post-
treatment period.  
Pharmacokinetic results. Trough plasma concentrations of OBV, PTV, r, DSV, and DSV M1 metabolite 
were generally comparable to the Ctrough levels observed in GT1-infected population receiving 12 or 24 
weeks of OBV/PTV/r and DSV plus RBV in the phase 3 TURQUOISE-II trial (Table 3) [9]. Ctrough values of 
OBV, PTV, r, DSV, and DSV M1 metabolite observed in TURQUOISE-III were 16%, 61%, 8%, 16%, and 14% 
higher, respectively, than those from TURQUOISE-II.

DISCUSSION 
Patients with HCV infection and cirrhosis are at the highest risk for progression to hepatic 
decompensation, transplantation, liver-related and all-cause mortality. Studies have shown that HCV 
eradication in patients with cirrhosis can reduce the risk of liver decompensation, hepatocellular 
carcinoma, morbidity, and improve hepatic synthetic function [24-26]. In this study, treatment with 
OBV/PTV/r and DSV without RBV resulted in a SVR12 rate of 100% in HCV GT1b-infected patients with 
compensated cirrhosis, meeting the primary endpoints of non-inferiority and superiority to the SVR12 
rate of sofosbuvir plus pegIFN/RBV. These results are consistent with the SVR12 rates achieved in 
patients from phase 3 trials including 68 patients with GT1b-infection and cirrhosis who received 
OBV/PTV/r and DSV with RBV for 12 weeks (98.5%) and 301 patients without cirrhosis who received the 
3-DAAs alone for 12 weeks (100%) [9, 20-22]. These data suggest that RBV does not provide incremental 
efficacy benefit in patients with cirrhosis with GT1b infection when treated with OBV/PTV/r and DSV. 
The results of this trial can be compared to data available for other IFN-free DAA regimens either under 
investigation or already approved. Although guidelines recommend 24 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
alone or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with RBV for 12 weeks in patients with cirrhosis who have failed prior 
therapy [5], the 12-week RBV-free combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir led to SVR12 rates of 96% in 
57 GT1b patients with cirrhosis[27]. In the OPTMIST II trial evaluating simeprevir plus sofosbuvir without 
RBV for 12 weeks in patients with cirrhosis, 26 of 31 (84%) GT1b-infected patients achieved SVR[28]. 
Treatment with grazoprevir and elbasvir for 12 weeks in treatment-naïve GT1b-infected patients 
without cirrhosis resulted in an SVR12 rate of 93%, and no additional benefit was gained with co-
administration of RBV [29]. In another study of this combination, all 15 GT1b-infected, pegIFN/RBV prior 
null responders with cirrhosis achieved SVR, however the numbers of patients who received treatment 
without RBV and for 12 or 18 weeks was not reported [10]. Daclatasvir with sofosbuvir has only been 
evaluated with RBV in patients with cirrhosis, in whom all 11 genotype 1b patients achieved SVR12.[30]  
   
Feld et al_TURQUOISE-III Primary_Response_tracked 20151002 
14 
 
Finally, the triple combination of daclatasvir, asunaprevir, and beclabuvir led to a 96% response rate in 
27 GT1b-infected patients with cirrhosis [15].  While difficult to compare across studies, these data 
clearly show that OBV/PTV/r and DSV is a highly effective interferon and RBV-free regimen for GT 1b-
infected patients with cirrhosis.  
The disease characteristics of the patients enrolled in this study were comparable to the GT1b-infected 
population receiving 12 weeks of OBV/PTV/r and DSV plus RBV in the phase 3 TURQUOISE-II trial 
(Supplemental Table 1) [9]. Patients with less-well documented experiences of prior treatment were 
permitted in this study, making comparisons to prior types of virologic failure across the 2 studies 
difficult. The 2 study populations were similar in terms of baseline indices of liver disease severity 
including platelet count, albumin, total bilirubin, alpha fetoprotein, and FibroTest. Although the 
FibroScan cut-off for inclusion in this study was 12.5 kPa compared to 14.6 kPa in the TURQUOISE-II trial, 
all but 5 patients in this study with FibroScan measurements had values above 14.6 kPa, and the median 
value was 19 kPa with 20 patients (48%) above 20 kPa.  Nonetheless, efficacy in both studies was 
exceedingly high, with the only GT1b failure being a prior partial responder in TURQUOISE-II with 
elevated alpha fetoprotein and thrombocytopenia at baseline. Similarly, 100% of 301 GT1b-infected 
patients without cirrhosis administered OBV/PTV/r and DSV without RBV achieved SVR12, including 91 
with prior treatment experience and 32 prior null responders [22]. Baseline factors suggestive of portal 
hypertension or more advanced liver disease including thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and 
FibroScan score >20 kPa, which have been shown to predict lower rates of response with some DAA 
regimens [27, 28], did not impact SVR rates, consistent with observations in this population receiving 
OBV/PTV/r and DSV plus RBV[31]. These findings suggest that RBV is not required with OBV/PTV/r and 
DSV in the treatment of HCV GT1b patients with cirrhosis, regardless of prior pegIFN/RBV treatment 
response or surrogate markers of portal hypertension.

Although these results show that RBV is not required for GT1b patients with cirrhosis, all 3 DAAs are 
likely required for optimal efficacy with 12 weeks of treatment. In the PEARL-I study, patients were 
treated with OBV/PTV/r without DSV for 24 weeks.[32] SVR rates of 97.9 and 96.2% were reported for 
treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced GT1b patients with cirrhosis, respectively. The results from 
both TURQUOISE-II and now TURQUOISE-III demonstrate the additional value of DSV, which has a better 
side effect profile than RBV and allows for shorter treatment duration.   
In the absence of RBV, trough plasma concentrations of OBV, PTV, r, DSV, and DSV M1 metabolite were 
comparable to this regimen administered with RBV in TURQUOISE-II. However, the 61% higher PTV 
Ctrough values observed in TURQUOISE-III compared to TURQUOISE-II could be due to the smaller number 
of samples analyzed coupled with high variability observed with PTV in both studies (Table 3). The 
results are consistent with the renal elimination of RBV that would not interfere with the hepatic 
metabolism of OBV, PTV, r, and DSV [19, 33, 34].  
A limitation of this study includes the open-label, single-arm, non-comparator design; however, safety 
comparisons for the 3-DAA regimen with RBV to placebo, or to 3-DAA without RBV, were performed in 
phase 3 studies. Rates of AEs, serious AEs, and some laboratory abnormalities for OBV/PTV/r and DSV in 
this study were numerically lower than that of OBV/PTV/r and DSV plus RBV in the TURQUOISE-II study, 
presumably due to the lack of RBV in this study (Supplemental Table 2). No new safety signals were 
identified compared to the reported safety profile of this RBV-free regimen in HCV GT1-infected patients 
without cirrhosis [20, 21]. The majority of laboratory abnormalities, particularly events of 
hyperbilirubinemia, were influenced by preexisting liver disease due to the permissive 
inclusion/exclusion criteria of this study. One patient experienced AEs considered severe (and serious), 
attributable to concomitant medication and DAAs. This regimen was well tolerated and no patient 
prematurely discontinued study drug.

In conclusion, the 12-week 3-DAA regimen of OBV/PTV/r and DSV achieved an SVR12 rate of 100% in 
previously pegIFN/RBV treated and untreated patients with HCV GT1b infection and compensated 
cirrhosis. Treatment was well tolerated with a low rate of serious AEs and no premature treatment 
discontinuations. Based on a cross-study comparison in a similar patient population, the rates of 
common adverse events, anemia, and hyperbilirubinemia were lower in this study without RBV than 
was observed in TURQUOISE-II where RBV was given. These results suggest that OBV/PTV/r and DSV for 
12 weeks is a highly efficacious treatment for GT1b patients with compensated cirrhosis, and RBV is not 
required to maximize SVR rates.
