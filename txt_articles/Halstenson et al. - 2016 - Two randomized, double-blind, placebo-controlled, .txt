Summary Background BTH1677 is a beta glucan pathogen
associated molecular pattern (PAMP) currently being investi-
gated as a novel cancer therapy. Here, the initial safety and
pharmacokinetic (PK) results of BTH1677 in healthy subjects
are reported. Subjects and Methods In the Phase 1a
single-dosing study, subjects were randomized (3:1 per co-
hort) to a single intravenous (iv) infusion of BTH1677 at
0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 6 mg/kg or placebo, respectively. In the Phase
1b multi-dosing study, subjects were randomized (3:1 per co-
hort) to 7 daily iv infusions of BTH1677 at 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg or
placebo, respectively. Safety and PK non-compartmental anal-
yses were performed. Results Thirty-six subjects (N = 24
Phase 1a; N = 12 Phase 1b) were randomized to treatment.
No deaths or serious adverse events occurred in either study.
Mild or moderate adverse events (AEs) occurred in 67 % of
BTH1677-treated subjects in both studies. Treatment-related
AEs (occurring in ≥10 % of subjects) included dyspnea, flush-
ing, headache, nausea, paraesthesia, and rash in Phase 1a and
conjunctivitis and headache in Phase 1b. BTH1677 serum
concentration was linear with dose. Clearance, serum elimina-
tion half-life (t1/2) and volume of distribution (Vss) were
BTH1677 dose-independent. In Phase 1b, area under the
curve, t1/2, and Vss values were larger at steady state on days
6–30 versus day 0. Conclusions BTH1677 was well tolerated
after single doses up to 6 mg/kg and after 7 daily doses up to
4 mg/kg.

Introduction
Microbial beta glucans are polymers of glucose extractable
from yeasts and fungi [1]. These conserved molecules func-
tion as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that
are efficiently recognized by the mammalian innate immune
system as non-self molecules and assist in elimination of mi-
crobial pathogens [2, 3]. PAMP recognition drives enhanced
killing capacity of innate immune effector cells (e.g., macro-
phages, monocytes, neutrophils), repolarization of macro-
phages from an M2 to a more M1 state, and the maturation
and activation of dendritic cells—professional antigen-
presenting cells that cross talk to cells of the adaptive immune
system (i.e., T-cells, B-cells). BTH1677 (Biothera
Pharmaceutical Inc., Eagan, MN, USA) is an intravenous
(iv) formulation of a yeast-derived, uncharged, water-soluble,
1,3–1,6 beta glucan purified from the cell wall of a proprietary,
non-recombinant, strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
BTH1677 is a PAMP that can orchestrate a coordinated anti-
cancer immune response, involving both the innate and adap-
tive immune system, when administered with other anti-
cancer therapies.

 When BTH1677 enters the blood, it is bound by endoge-
nous plasma anti-beta glucan antibodies (ABA) resulting in
complement activation and opsonization with complement
protein iC3b [4]. The BTH1677/ABA/iC3b complex initially
binds to innate immune effector cells through complement
receptor 3 and Fc gamma receptor IIA (FcγIIA) [4–6], acti-
vating innate immune cell function and direct killing of
antibody-targeted tumor cells [7, 8]. BTH1677 also enables
re-education of the tumor microenvironment, shifting the nor-
mally suppressive M2-state macrophages to a more M1 (tu-
mor attack) state, [9, 10] and promotes depletion and/or mat-
uration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor mi-
croenvironment [11]. BTH1677 treatment additionally acti-
vates antigen-presenting cells, driving co-stimulatory marker
expression on macrophages and dendritic cells, as well as
dendritic cell maturation, CD4 and CD8 T-cell expansion,
and production of key anti-tumor cytokines (e.g., interferon
gamma) [10, 12–15]. In murine syngeneic and xenogeneic
tumor models, the administration of BTH1677 with various
tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies has resulted in greater
suppression of tumor growth and longer survival than with
either agent alone [16–18]. Similar effects have been observed
with BTH1677 combined with anti-angiogenic [11, 19, 20]
and checkpoint inhibitor [13] antibodies.
Here, we report the initial safety and pharmacokinetic (PK)
results of dose-escalating single- and multiple-dose Phase 1
studies of BTH1677 in healthy volunteer subjects.
Materials and methods
Study objectives
The primary objective of each study was to evaluate the safety
profile and tolerability of BTH1677 versus placebo by
assessing the frequency, type, and severity of adverse events
(AEs), as well as by assessing changes in physical exam find-
ings, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) responses, and
clinical laboratory results. The secondary objective of each
study was to evaluate the PK profile of BTH1677. The
Phase 1b study was initiated following completion of the
Phase 1a study.
Subjects
Subjects, 18 to 45 years of age (inclusive), were eligible for
study inclusion if they provided written informed consent and
had a body weight of 45 to 125 kg (inclusive), and a body
mass index ≤30 kg/m2. Females could not be pregnant or
nursing and, if premenopausal, were required to have a nega-
tive urine pregnancy test prior to enrollment and be practicing
at least 2 methods of birth control. All subjects were deter-
mined to be healthy by the principal investigator on the basis
of medical history, physical examination, ECG, and clinical
laboratory test results. Subjects enrolled in the study under-
stood the study requirements, agreed to abide by the study
restrictions and to return for required assessments, and provid-
ed written authorization for use and disclosure of protected
health information.
Subjects were excluded from the study if they had either a
known hypersensitivity to baker’s yeast; a history of tobacco
use within 3 months of the screening period; an active yeast
infection, a positive hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immu-
nodeficiency virus test (conducted during the screening peri-
od); or were a known or suspected abuser of alcohol or other
drugs/substances of abuse. In addition, subjects were excluded
if they had donated or lost more than a unit of blood within
30 days of the last day of the screening period; had any clinical
condition that, in the opinion of the principal investigator,
warranted exclusion from the study for either a scientific, pro-
cedural, or safety perspective; had taken any prescription med-
ication within 14 days (30 days for Phase 1b); had taken any
over-the-counter medication, herbal preparation, or vitamin
within 7 days (acetaminophen [maximum 3 g/day], female
hormone replacement therapy, and oral contraceptives were
allowed); or had participated in an investigational drug study
within 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever was longer). Phase
1b also excluded subjects who had ever participated in a study
with BTH1677.
Study design
Both Phase 1a (NCT00542217) and Phase 1b
(NCT00542464) were single-center, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation studies that evalua-
ted infusion of BTH1677 in healthy volunteer subjects.
The Phase 1a, single-dosing study consisted of a 1-day
treatment period and an additional 6-day follow-up period that
enrolled 24 subjects in 5 sequential BTH1677 dose cohorts
(0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 mg/kg). The Phase 1b multiple-dosing
study consisted of a 7-day treatment period and an additional
23-day follow-up period and enrolled 12 subjects in 3 sequen-
tial dose cohorts (1, 2, and 4 mg/kg). The initial BTH1677
dose chosen for the Phase 1a study was based on safety mar-
gins calculated from animal toxicology studies according to
regulatory guidelines [21]. For each cohort, in a double-blind
manner, 3 subjects were randomized to BTH1677 and 1 sub-
ject was randomized to placebo. AEs were assessed as mild—
awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily tolerated;
moderate—discomfort enough to cause interference with usu-
al activities and may warrant intervention; severe—incapaci-
tating with inability to do usual activities or significantly af-
fecting clinical status, and warranting intervention; or life
threatening—immediate risk of death. Each dose increase
was dependent on the approval of an AE taskforce (AETF),
based on review of safety data from the previous cohort. The
Invest New Drugs (2016) 34:202–215
203
 AETF consisted of the principal investigator and 3 members
of the Biothera clinical team, including the medical monitor.
Dose escalation of study drug was to be discontinued if
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed in the previous
cohort. DLT was defined as 2 or more subjects experiencing
at least 1 moderate AE judged to be study drug related or 1 or
more subjects experiencing at least 1 severe AE or serious AE
(SAE) judged to be study drug related.
It was the original intent of the Phase 1a protocol to dose all
subjects over a 1-h (hr) period; however, during the study the
protocol was amended to revise dosing times resulting in en-
rollment of an additional 4 subjects to an amended dosing
schedule in the 4 mg/kg cohort (see additional information
provided in the Results section). Planned dose cohorts and
infusion information for the Phase 1a and Phase 1b studies
are shown in Table 1. Figure 1 illustrates the design of the
Phase 1a and Phase 1b studies.
BTH1677
Biothera Pharmaceutical Inc. (Eagan, MN, USA) supplied
BTH1677 (Imprime PGG; β(1,6)-[poly-(1,3)-D-
glucopyranosyl]-poly-β-(1,3)-D-glucopyranose) to the clini-
cal site in 20-mL glass vials at a concentration of 1 mg/mL
in 0.14 M sodium chloride and 0.11 M sodium citrate. The
average molecular weight of BTH1677 is approximately 150,
000 Da and the empirical formula is (C6H10O5)n. For infusion,
BTH1677 was diluted at the clinical site in 0.9 % normal
saline.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
In both studies, serum BTH1677 levels were analyzed using
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method that
was qualified at Biothera Pharmaceutical Inc. (Eagan, MN,
USA). The assay was based on galactosylceramide (GalCer;
CAS #85305–88-0) capture of BTH1677 and detection with a
beta-glucan-specific IgM monoclonal antibody (BFD IV).
Test serum samples were incubated in 96-well microtiter
plates coated with GalCer to allow for BTH1677 binding to
the GalCer coating. The bound BTH1677 was then detected
by sequential incubations with unlabeled BFD IV, then
biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM, and finally with
streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase and peroxi-
dase substrate. Color development was quenched by adding
the substrate stop solution to each well and absorbance was
read at 450 nm. The lower limit of detection for the assay was
1.2 ng/mL and the lower limit of quantitation was 4.7 ng/mL.
For PK analysis in the Phase 1a study, blood samples were
collected before dosing and at 1, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24,
48, 72, 96, and 168 h relative to the start of the infusion. For
PK analysis in the Phase 1b study, on the first day (day 0) and
last day (day 6) of dosing, blood samples were collected be-
fore dosing, at the end of infusion, and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 7,
and 12 h relative to the end of infusion. Additional blood
samples were collected at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168, 192, 216,
240, 336, and 720 h relative to the start of infusion on day 0.
After blood collection, serum was separated, frozen, and ana-
lyzed for BTH1677 concentrations. For both studies, PK pa-
rameters were calculated using non-compartmental analysis
(NCA) methods.
Statistical analysis
Because of the nature of the Phase 1a and Phase 1b studies,
statistical analyses were descriptive only. In each study, data
for all subjects randomized to placebo were pooled to create
the placebo treatment group. Categorical data were summa-
rized in tables listing the frequency and the percentage of
subjects in each treatment group. Continuous data were sum-
marized in tables listing the mean, standard deviation, median,
minimum, and maximum in each treatment group. All statis-
tical computations were performed using the SAS® system.

 Results
Phase 1a study
Subject demographics
Baseline demographics of subjects in the Phase 1a single-
dosing study are shown on the left-hand side of Table 2.
Overall, the majority of the population in both treatment
groups was male (72.2 % BTH1677; 100 % placebo) and
Caucasian (72.2 % BTH1677; 83.3 % placebo). The mean
age was 25.1 years (range, 18–44 years) for subjects receiving
BTH1677 and 28.0 years (range, 21–43 years) for subjects
receiving placebo.
BTH1677 drug administration
In this study, 24 subjects were randomized and dosed with
single doses of placebo (n = 6) or escalating doses of
BTH1677 at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 6 mg/kg (n = 18). It was originally
intended in the protocol to dose all subjects over a 1-h period.
However, after initiating dosing of 3 subjects in the 4-mg/kg
cohort, 2 subjects reported moderate AEs of flushing, pruritus,
tachycardia, dyspnea, and hyperhidrosis within 5 to 10 min of
initiation of infusion. At the onset of the AEs, study drug
administration was stopped in all 3 subjects (which included
1 subject randomized to placebo who had experienced no
AEs) and initiation of dosing in the fourth subject planned
for this cohort (a subject randomized to BTH1677) was
suspended. The dosed subjects experiencing AEs were admin-
istered diphenhydramine (i.e., Benadryl®) intravenously and
their AEs resolved within approximately 10 to 15 min after
discontinuation of the infusion. At the time study drug admin-
istration was discontinued in the 4-mg/kg (1-h infusion) treat-
ment cohort, the subjects exhibiting the abovementioned AEs
had received approximately 9 % to 14 % of the total targeted
infusion volume. Thus, the total study drug dose administered
to these subjects was far less than the total dose safely admin-
istered to the 2-mg/kg treatment cohort. Although the 4-mg/kg
(1-h infusion) dose was diluted in a 500-mL volume of normal
saline versus the 250-mL volume of normal saline used for the
previous 2-mg/kg dose, the infusion time was kept constant at
1 h. As a result, the concentration of the study drug infused
was similar between the 4-mg/kg (1-h infusion) and 2-mg/kg
treatment cohorts (mean concentration of 0.64 mg/mL for the
2-mg/kg treatment cohort compared to 0.73 mg/mL for the
4-mg/kg [1-h infusion] treatment cohort). However, the rate
of administration of the 4-mg/kg (1-h infusion) dose was ap-
proximately twice that of 2-mg/kg dose. The rate of drug
administration for the 4-mg/kg (1-h infusion) cohort varied
from 5.7 to 6.5 mg/min, whereas the rate of drug administra-
tion for the 2-mg/kg cohort varied from 1.9 to 3.4 mg/min.
After review of the clinical and safety data, it was conclud-
ed that the AEs observed at the 4-mg/kg (1-h infusion) dose
level were most likely not the result of the BTH1677 drug
dose, but rather were a result of the rapid infusion rate and were

a During the Phase 1a study, infusion rate was shown to have an effect on infusion-related AEs which became evident at the 4 mg/kg dose. This resulted in extending infusion time from 1 h to 2 h for a
second 4-mg/kg cohort and to 3 h for the 6-mg/kg cohort. This subgroup analysis eliminates the 4-mg/kg 1-h infusion subjects shown to have AEs due to the infusion rate.
b For subjects receiving placebo, infusion time matched that of the corresponding treatment group.

 not considered DLTs. A protocol amendment was submitted
and approved to allow enrollment of 4 additional subjects into
the 4-mg/kg treatment cohort with a 2-h, rather than 1-h, infu-
sion time to allow an infusion rate similar to that of the
previous 2-mg/kg treatment cohort in which BTH1677 had
been well tolerated. In support of the conclusion that the ob-
served AEs were the result of infusion rate rather than dose
level, there were no treatment-related AEs reported in subjects
treated with 4 mg/kg BTH1677 administered over a 2-h infu-
sion. The protocol amendment also modified the infusion time
for the 6-mg/kg dose cohort to 3 h, which was also generally
well tolerated.
Safety
An overview of the safety summary is shown on the left side
of Table 3. Twelve of the 18 BTH1677 subjects (66.7 %) and 3
of 6 placebo subjects (50.0 %) experienced AEs. AEs were
assessed as treatment related in 9 of 18 BTH1677 subjects
(50.0 %) and in none of the 6 placebo subjects (0.0 %). All
AEs were mild or moderate in intensity, with no AEs classi-
fied as severe. No SAEs or deaths occurred in the study.
Excluding the 4-mg/kg 1-h infusion group, the mean number
of treatment-related AEs per BTH1677 subject in the 0.5-, 1-,
2- and 4-mg/kg groups ranged from 0.0 to 1.0 and increased to
2.7 in the 6-mg/kg group. Four subjects (2 in the 4-mg/kg 1-h
infusion group) discontinued the study prematurely because
of AEs that were considered treatment related; these AEs are
further discussed below.
The highest frequency of AEs was reported among subjects
receiving 6-mg/kg BTH1677 over a 3-h infusion period
(Table 4). AEs reported by more than 1 subject included head-
ache (4 events; 2 events in BTH1677 subjects [both mild] and
2 events in placebo subjects [1 mild and 1 moderate]), dys-
pnea (3 events in BTH1677 subjects [1 mild and 2 moderate]),
and 2 events each of nausea [1 mild and 1 moderate], paraes-
thesia [both mild], rash [both moderate] and flushing [both
moderate] in BTH1677 subjects.
The treatment-related AEs reported by the 9 BTH1677
subjects are also reported in Table 4. In the 4-mg/kg 1-h infu-
sion group, all AEs but 1 (moderate decreased white blood
cell count) were considered treatment related. Across all sub-
jects, treatment-related AEs reported by more than 1 subject
included dyspnea (3 events [1 mild and 2 moderate]) and 2
events each of nausea (1 mild and 1 moderate), headache
(both mild), paraesthesia (both mild), rash (both moderate),
and flushing (both moderate). Treatment-related AEs leading
to premature study discontinuation consisted of moderate rash
in a 2-mg/kg subject; moderate tachycardia, moderate nausea,
moderate dizziness, moderate dyspnea, moderate hyperhidro-
sis, moderate pruritus and moderate flushing in the two
4-mg/kg 1-h infusion subjects (only dyspnea and flushing
were experienced by both subjects); and mild paraesthesia,
mild hypoaesthesia, and moderate rash in a 6-mg/kg subject.
Overall, moderate treatment-related AEs experienced by sub-
jects other than those undergoing infusion reactions in the
4 mg/kg 1-h infusion group consisted of only 1 subject at
2 mg/kg (rash) and 1 subject at 6 mg/kg (rash), hence, DLT
was not observed at any dose tested.
Overall, only minor deviations from the normal range were
observed for hematology, chemistry, or urinalysis parameters
at various times during the study. These deviations were ob-
served in subjects treated with both placebo and BTH1677,
and there were no consistent mean changes from baseline
among the treatment groups. As indicated above, only 1 lab-
oratory abnormality was considered clinically significant and
reported as an AE. This AE, decreased white blood cell count,
occurred in a subject dosed with BTH1677 in the 4-mg/kg 1-h
infusion group and had resolved by the end of the study (day
6). Other than physical changes captured as AEs above, all of
which had resolved by the end of the study, no additional
abnormal physical examination findings were observed after
BTH1677 administration nor were changes from baseline not-
ed in vital signs or ECGs.
Phase 1b study
Subject demographics
Baseline demographics of subjects in the Phase 1b multiple-
dosing study are shown on the right-hand side of Table 2. The
subject population was predominately female (55.6 %
BTH1677; 66.7 % placebo) and included Caucasians
(88.9 % BTH1677; 66.7 % placebo) and Hispanics (11.1 %
BTH1677; 33.3 % placebo). The mean age was 28.0 years
(range, 19–44 years) for subjects receiving BTH1677 and
23.7 years (range, 20–28 years) for subjects receiving placebo.
BTH1677 drug administration
Twelve subjects were randomized and dosed with 7 consecu-
tive daily doses of BTH1677 at 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg. Based on
experience from the Phase 1a study, the 1- and 2-mg/kg doses
were infused over 1 h and the 4-mg/kg dose was infused over
2 h.
Safety
As shown on the right-hand side of Table 3, 6 of 9 BTH1677
subjects (66.7 %) and 2 of 3 placebo subjects (66.7 %) expe-
rienced AEs. AEs were assessed as treatment related in 2 of 9
BTH1677 subjects (22.2 %) and in 1 of 3 placebo subjects
(33.3 %). As in the Phase 1a study, all AEs were mild or
moderate in intensity. Furthermore, no SAEs or deaths oc-
curred in the study. All AEs designated as treatment related
occurred in subjects in the 4-mg/kg BTH1677 group. Two

AE adverse events
a During the Phase 1a study, infusion rate was shown to have an effect on infusion-related AEs which became evident at the 4-mg/kg dose. This resulted in extending infusion time from 1 h to 2 h for a
second 4-mg/kg cohort and to 3 h for the 6-mg/kg cohort. This subgroup analysis eliminates the 4-mg/kg 1-h infusion subjects shown to have AEs due to the infusion rate.
b For subjects receiving placebo, infusion time matched that of the corresponding treatment group.
c A single subject may have multiple AEs with different intensities; only the most severe intensity is included in this count.
d Relatedness definitions differed between the studies; Phase 1a used not related, related, and unknown and Phase 1b used unrelated, unlikely related, possibly related, probably related, definitely related,
and unknown. Treatment-related AEs include AEs assessed by the investigator as related for Phase 1a and possibly, probably, or definitely related for Phase1b.
e A single subject in this group reported 8 adverse events.

b Data are presented as the number of subjects experiencing any AE and the number of subjects experiencing treatment-related AEs separated by B/^. For both categories, each subject was counted only once
for each SOC and each preferred term; a single subject may have had multiple AEs within a specific SOC. Treatment-related AEs included AEs assessed by the investigator as related from the options of not
related, related, and unknown.

 subjects discontinued the study prematurely because of AEs
that were considered treatment related; these AEs are
discussed further below.
The highest frequency of AEs was reported in the 4-mg/kg
group (Table 5). Only 1 AE, headache, was reported by more
than 1 subject; this AE was reported by 1 subject in both the
BTH1677 1-mg/kg group (mild) and the BTH1677 4-mg/kg
group (mild). AEs assessed as treatment-related in the Phase
1b study are also reported in Table 5. Three subjects experi-
enced treatment-related AEs. In separate subjects in the
BTH1677 4-mg/kg group, these included conjunctivitis
(moderate) and headache (mild) and, in a placebo subject,
moderate increase in blood creatinine kinase (CK). The con-
junctivitis and increased CK led to premature study discontin-
uation in the subjects experiencing these events. DLT was not
observed at any dose tested.
No clear trends in mean changes from baseline among the
treatment groups were noted for hematology, clinical chemis-
try, or urinalysis parameters. In addition, other than conjunc-
tivitis captured, as an AE above and which had resolved by
end of study, no additional abnormal physical examination
findings or changes in vital signs from baseline were observed
after BTH1677 administration. There were some abnormal
ECG results (or normal ECG results with variants) observed
after study drug administration compared with baseline; how-
ever, these changes were not deemed clinically significant.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
Key PK results from the Phase 1a single-dose study based on
NCA methods are shown in Table 6. BTH1677 exposure was
generally linear in the range of 0.5 mg/kg to 6.0 mg/kg for

AE adverse events
a Coded by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MEdDRA; V 8.1) by System Organ Class (SOC) (bolded terms) and preferred term (non-
bolded terms).
b Data are presented as the number of subjects experiencing any AE and the number of subjects experiencing treatment-related AEs separated by B/^. For
both categories, each subject was counted only once for each SOC and each preferred term; a single subject may have had multiple AEs within a specific
SOC. Treatment-related AEs included AEs assessed by the investigator as possibly, probably, or definitely related from the options of unrelated, unlikely
related, possibly related, probably related, definitely related, and unknown.

 single iv doses based on area under the curve (AUC) values
for AUC(0–24), AUC(0-last), and AUC(0-∞). The PK parameter
for maximum drug concentration (Cmax) in this study was
generally linear in the dose range of 0.5 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg,
in which all subjects were dosed over 1 h, but not in the 4 mg/
kg and 6 mg/kg doses given over longer periods. This was
attributed to the different infusion times used among treat-
ments. PK parameters for clearance (CL), serum elimination
half-life (t1/2) and volume of distribution (Vss) were BTH1677
dose independent, but time to maximum concentration (Tmax)
was dose dependent. The dose dependency of Tmax was again
attributed to the different infusion times used among treat-
ments. Tmax occurred at approximately 1 h for the 1-h infusion
groups, 2 h for the 2-h infusion group, and 2.67 h for the 3-h
infusion group. Mean CL values ranged from 441.76 mL/h to
619.25 mL/h, mean t1/2 values ranged from 23.36 h to 32.75 h,
and mean Vss values ranged from 7794.36 mL to 14,
400.69 mL.
Key PK results from the Phase 1b multi-dose study based
on NCA methods are shown in Table 7. BTH1677 concentra-
tion was generally linear in the range of 1.0 mg/kg to 4.0 mg/
kg for multiple iv doses on day 0 and at steady state (days 6–
30), based on Cmax, AUC(0–24), AUC(0-Tau), AUC(0-last), and
AUC(0-∞) values. PK parameters CL, t1/2, Vss, and Tmax were
dose independent for BTH1677 on day 0 and at steady state
(days 6–30). Among the different treatment groups, compari-
sons were evaluated on the PK parameters for day 0 versus
days 6–30. True Ke on day 0 could not be estimated because of
protocol design, thus t1/2, Vss, and CL on day 0 were calculat-
ed based on the 0–24-h serum concentration versus time pro-
file. AUC, t1/2, and Vss values all tended to be larger on days
6–30 versus day 0.
Discussion
BTH1677 is a novel beta glucan PAMP being developed for
the treatment of cancer in combination with tumor-targeted
antibodies, as well as anti-angiogenic and checkpoint inhibitor
antibodies. Here, the results of initial safety and tolerability
studies of BTH1677 administered alone in healthy volunteer
subjects are reported.
In healthy volunteer subjects, the safety and tolerability of
single doses and of 7 consecutive daily doses of BTH1677
were investigated by monitoring AEs as well as changes in
clinical laboratory parameters, physical exam findings, vital
signs, and ECG responses. After adjusting for infusion rate,
single doses of BTH1677 up to 6 mg/kg and repeated doses of
BTH1677 up to 4 mg/kg (highest doses tested) demonstrated
an acceptable safety profile and were well tolerated based on
the aforementioned evaluations. Regarding the infusion reac-
tions, it is difficult to distinguish whether the administration of
diphenhydramine or simply cessation of infusion (i.e., fluid

 volume distribution) was responsible for resolution. All ob-
served AEs were mild or moderate in intensity and no DLTs
were observed. Although the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
was not reached, an increase in the total number of
treatment-related AEs between the 4-mg/kg (2-h infusion)
dose group and the 6-mg/kg dose group in the Phase 1a study
suggested that higher doses may approach a MTD and, hence,
the maximum dose chosen for the Phase 1b multi-dose study
was 4 mg/kg.
The PK evaluations in the single-dose study demonstrated
linearity with dose and a t1/2 of approximately 30 h. The
multi-dose PK evaluations demonstrated linearity with dose;
however, AUC, t1/2 and Vss values tended to be larger on days
6–30 versus day 0. In particular, mean t1/2 values were notice-
ably different across studies following single-dose administra-
tion, with mean values ranging from 23.36 h to 32.75 h when
blood samples were collected over 168 h in the Phase 1a study,
and from 11.66 h to 13.83 h when blood samples were col-
lected over only 24 h in the Phase 1b study. Additionally,
mean t1/2 values under steady-state conditions (after 7 daily
consecutive doses of BTH1677) were noticeably different
than those observed under single-dose conditions, with mean
t1/2 values ranging from 80.97 h to 109.51 h when blood
samples were collected over 24 days (Phase 1b study).
When using NCA methods, if blood is sampled over an insuf-
ficient time span, the apparent terminal elimination phase may
be representative of a distribution half-life, as opposed to the
true elimination half-life. As such, extending the timing of the
blood sampling strategy may be expected to result in different
assessments of the terminal elimination phase, as was ob-
served at the first dose in the Phase 1b study (tlast = 24 h,
t1/2 = 11.66–13.83 h), the only dose of the Phase 1a study
(tlast = 168 h, t1/2 = 23.36–32.75 h), and the final dose of the
Phase 1b study (tlast = 24 days, t1/2 = 80.97–109.51 h). Overall,
the above results suggest that the true elimination phase of
BTH1677 was not well characterized using NCA methods
and in future studies additional models will be explored.
There were no clear dose correlations of AE occurrence or
AE type with PK parameters in the multi-dose study, but in the
single-dose study (excluding the 4 mg/kg 1-h infusion group,
which prompted infusion rate modification for the 4 mg/kg
and 6 mg/kg doses), the greatest number of AEs occurred in
the 6-mg/kg group, which also had the greatest exposure to
BTH1677.
Based on the favorable safety and tolerability results ob-
served in the above described safety studies in healthy volunteer
subjects, Phase 2 investigations dosing BTH1677 in combina-
tion with anti-tumor monoclonal antibodies have proceeded in
cancer patients [22–26] and will be reported separately.
