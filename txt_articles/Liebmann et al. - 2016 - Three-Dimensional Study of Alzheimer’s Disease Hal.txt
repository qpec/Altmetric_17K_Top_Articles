SUMMARY
Amyloidosis is a major problem in over one hundred
diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Using
the iDISCO visualization method involving targeted
molecular labeling, tissue clearing, and light-sheet
microscopy, we studied plaque formation in the
intact AD mouse brain at up to 27 months of age.
We visualized amyloid plaques in 3D together with
tau, microglia, and vasculature. Volume imaging
coupled to automated detection and mapping en-
ables precise and fast quantification of plaques
within the entire intact mouse brain. The present
methodology is also applicable to analysis of frozen
human brain samples without specialized preserva-
tion. Remarkably, amyloid plaques in human brain
tissues showed greater 3D complexity and surpris-
ingly large three-dimensional amyloid patterns, or
TAPs. The ability to visualize amyloid in 3D, espe-
cially in the context of their micro-environment, and
the discovery of large TAPs may have important sci-
entific and medical implications.
INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative
disorder, is characterized by initial short-term memory loss fol-
lowed by subsequent severe deficits attributed to neuronal and
neuritic loss (Probst et al., 1991; Holtzman et al., 2011). The
two main pathological hallmarks of the disease are (1) the
abnormal accumulation of the b amyloid peptide (Ab) and its
aggregation leading to amyloid plaques localized in the brain
parenchyma, and (2) the presence of intracellular hyperphos-
phorylated tau protein inclusions (neurofibrillary tangles or
NFTs) (Haass and Selkoe, 2007; Castellani et al., 2010). There
are still many unknowns about the origin and the role of these
hallmarks, including the debate about the importance of oligo-
mers versus amyloid plaques and NFTs (Berger et al., 2007;
Lesne
´ et al., 2006; Walsh et al., 2002), but we believe that a better
understanding of the three dimensionality of disease hallmarks
and their complex association with the immediate environment
(e.g., vasculature and microglia) will help clarify the underlying
mechanisms of neurodegeneration.
Until recently, volume imaging of a human brain sample or an
entire mouse brain hemisphere has been restricted by micro-
scopy techniques with limited light penetration and/or insuffi-
cient resolution; the workhorse techniques of confocal and
2-photon microscopy are not compatible with large volume im-
aging, and positron emission tomography has a relatively poor
resolution, especially when studying rodents (Pan et al., 2015).
Due to a renewed interest in light-sheet fluorescence micro-
scopy, also referred to as selective plane illumination micro-
scopy (Huisken et al., 2004; Dodt et al., 2007), coupled with
the development and optimization of tissue clearing technolo-
gies, it has become possible to investigate large intact tissue vol-
umes, including the mouse brain, with cellular resolution (Hama
et al., 2011; Ert€
urk et al., 2012; Renier et al., 2014; Kuwajima
et al., 2013; Ke et al., 2013; Chung et al., 2013; Tomer et al.,
2014; Yang et al., 2014; Susaki et al., 2014). Recent attempts
at comprehensive 3D imaging of AD mouse models have given
momentum to volume imaging strategies for the field of AD,
but have failed to reveal the entirety of the plaque content in
the brain due to volume limitations, incomplete illumination/
detection, or restricted quantitation (Ja
¨ hrling et al., 2015; Ando
et al., 2014; Hama et al., 2015).
The combination of multiple technologies (volume immunolab-
eling, tissue clearing, light-sheet microscopy, and computational
analysis) described previously (immunolabeling-enabled 3D
imaging of solvent cleared organs, iDISCO; Renier et al., 2014,
2016) allowed us to study AD hallmarks in the intact mouse brain
hemisphere. As immunodetection was crucial for this study,
iDISCO was the ideal method for labeling and volume imaging
of b-amyloid, tau protein, cell nuclei, microglia, and vasculature,
allowing visualization of up to three parameters simultaneously.
We compared 3D imaging using optical slices to the conven-
tional immuno-histochemical (IHC) method performed on phys-
ical sections. As a faster and more economical alternative for
b-amyloid plaque labeling, we showed that antibodies could
be replaced by the small molecule Congo red [PubChem CID:
11313]. We studied the progression of amyloid plaque accumu-
lation in the 2xTg AD mouse model (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) in an-
imals ranging from 4.4 to 27 months of age. iDISCO facilitated
more comprehensive detection of b-amyloid plaques at earlier
stages than allowed by the classical IHC method, which typically
does not effectively sample plaques until later stages due to the

 scarcity of plaques in thin sections. There were five major brain
regions that were optically dissected and analyzed for plaque
density. For more comprehensive and non-biased quantification
of the entire brain, we applied ClearMap, a recently developed
method for automated detection and alignment to an anatomical
atlas. The combination of volume imaging and ClearMap anal-
ysis allowed us to automate detection of amyloid plaques and
alignment to the Allen Brain Atlas.
Remarkably, volume analysis of archived human brain tissue
led to the discovery of large 3D amyloid patterns (TAPs)
measuring up to 27 mm3. In these human samples, contrary to
the mouse brains, we observed a larger diversity of amyloid pla-
ques in terms of size and 3D shape. These intriguing differences
between animal models and human samples might highlight a
trait of, and specific to, human AD pathogenesis.
The combination of various parameters (3D co-labeling with
up to three antibodies and/or small molecules and light-sheet/
confocal/two-photon microscopy) provides access to an in-
creased set of possibilities for facilitated quantitative preclinical
studies and for pathological exploration through correlative ex-
amination using retrospective studies of archival tissues, which
may even lead to disease classification.
RESULTS
Detecting 3D b-Amyloid Plaques in a Full Mouse
Brain Hemisphere with Anti-Ab Peptide Antibodies or
Congo Red
Here, we explored the possibilities of studying amyloidosis in
3D. We propose that studies of b-amyloid plaques and their
surroundings could gain substantially by resolving b-amyloid
plaques in their 3D context. We applied iDISCO, a method devel-
oped (Renier et al., 2014) to combine whole-mount immunolab-
eling with the high transparency offered by the solvent-based
clearing technique 3DISCO (Ert€
urk et al., 2012). We first tested
11 anti-Ab antibodies for compatibility with the iDISCO meth-
anol-based immunostaining protocol for their capacity to reveal
b-amyloid plaques in large mouse tissue blocks (see Table S1).
Based on label specificity and effective tissue penetration (see
Figure S1), one antibody was selected (referred to as PAb #10)
for Ab labeling throughout the study. Full mouse hemispheres
were then prepared and treated with PAb #10 and imaged utiliz-
ing high-speed light-sheet microscopy, resulting in image data
sets that enable optical isolation of arbitrary image planes (opti-
cal slice) or volumes throughout the brain. A representative
sagittal optical slice obtained from a 27-month-old 2xTg mouse
brain reveals the presence of b-amyloid plaques in the cortex
and hippocampus (Figure S2A, top image). A magnified view of
this optical slice shows a large concentration of amyloid plaques
throughout the cortex and in the hippocampus (Figure 1A, top
image). A direct comparison (two hemispheres from the same
mouse brain) between the most promising antibodies (PAb #10
and PAb #9) showed a similar distribution even though many
fewer amyloid plaques are visible in the center of the sample
labeled with PAb #9, presumably due to reduced penetration
depth for PAb #9 as a result of antibody depletion (Figures
S2B and S3).
Next, in an attempt to circumvent some of the limitations
inherent to antibodies (cost, slow diffusion, and occasional un-
specific surface labeling), we tested the possibility that a small
molecule known to bind b-amyloid plaques, Congo red, could
be effectively used in combination with iDISCO, as demon-
strated with other small molecules and clearing protocols (Ja
¨ hrl-
ing et al., 2015). We performed a comparison between Congo
red and PAb #10 on the two hemispheres of a 27-month-old
2xTg brain. Single optical slices and orthogonal planes reveal
that both antibody and Congo red stainings of amyloid plaques
are visible throughout the volume of the hemispheres (Fig-
ure S2A). Magnified views of cortices and hippocampi clearly
demonstrate the specificity of both antibody and dye staining
of plaques (Figure 1A) when compared with control wild-type tis-
sue (Figure 1B). Maximum projection images highlight the distri-
bution of staining in the intact large tissues. Staining of full hemi-
spheres with PAb #10 and Congo red is shown in an aged 2xTg
AD mouse and an aged wild-type control mouse (Figure 1C).
Highlighting the time efficiency of using Congo red for plaque
visualization, we found effective staining throughout an intact
hemisphere after only 2 hr of dye incubation (Figure 1D).
To illustrate the feasibility of increased lateral resolution
imaging, whole hemispheres were also imaged using confocal
microscopy. Optical slices further confirm the specificity of
PAb#10 labeling in the 2xTg AD mouse brain compared to
wild-type brain staining (Figure S3D). Maximum intensity projec-
tions and animated volume rendering of intact brain hemi-
spheres reveal plaques with exceptional detail, combining the
resolving capabilities of confocal microscopy with the volume
capacity enabled by clearing (Figures S3E and S3F; Movie S1),
though axial resolution is reduced and acquisition times are
longer compared to light sheet microscopy.
To directly compare the efficacy of the antibody versus small
molecule dye staining of b-amyloid plaques, we simultaneously
applied both labels to a single brain hemisphere of a 2xTg AD
mouse. Optical slices and volume projections within the hippo-
campus and cortex demonstrate a comparable efficacy of the
two labeling strategies for targeting large amyloid plaques
deep in the brain (Figures 1E and 1F; Movie S2). Based on these
results, the two staining methods are generally comparable.
Interestingly, detailed inspection of enlarged images of a cortical

 region reveals differences in labeling patterns between the two
methods. Magnification of thin optical slices shows prominent
labeling of the plaque core in both cases, whereas subtle outer
structures surrounding the core are seen only with antibody
staining, suggesting a greater sensitivity of the antibody detec-
tion method (Figure 1G). Surface rendering further emphasizes
the 3D differences between the two stains and clarifies the pla-
que ramifications (Figure 1H, cyan) visible around the core of
the plaque (Figure 1H, red) and surrounding b-amyloid deposits
labeled by antibodies (Figure 1H, green).
Next, as immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the prevailing method
of choice to detect b-amyloid plaques in brain tissue, we
compared quantitation of plaques in physical sectioning and
DAB staining versus optical sectioning in age-matched animals.
In one 17-month-old 2xTg AD mouse, we used iDISCO to stain
plaques with both Congo red and PAb #10 and acquire serial
sagittal sections (Figure 2A). An additional animal was treated
according to standard IHC sectioning and staining for plaques
(Figure 2B). A comparative quantification of antibody-labeled
plaques in tissue sections versus matched optical planes from
iDISCO labeling validates that there is statistically equivalent pla-
que detection between strategies (Figure 2C). When plaque
staining is combined with the autofluorescence in the green
spectrum, iDISCO provides optical sectioning with detailed
plaque morphology as well as local topography. Volume imaging
of plaques with iDISCO also accommodates additional labels,
such as nuclear staining to reveal neighboring cell density
(Figure S4A).
As cleared samples are imaged intact (without sectioning), a
more complete and accurate morphological characterization of
b-amyloid deposits is possible. iDISCO permits staining and im-
aging of large intact tissue volumes (Figure 2D), upward of 1 cm3,
while simultaneously maintaining resolved details of individual
amyloid deposits. Furthermore, representative maximum inten-
sity projections and surface renderings of individual stained
structures from small image volumes reveal the diversity of am-
yloid deposits found in the brain, ranging from plaques of varying
sizes and shapes, integrated or not in larger networks (e.g.,
vasculature deposits) (Figure 2E; Movie S2). iDISCO is compat-
ible with a multitude of accessible microscopy techniques, as
demonstrated with laser scanning multiphoton (Figure S4B)
and confocal (Figure S4C) microscopies. With each imaging
system, we can access volume data, while resolving a variety
of plaque sizes, morphologies, and aggregates, as well as other
relevant parameters such as vascular deposits.
Evaluating Dynamics and Distribution of Plaque
Formation in the Whole Mouse Brain
We evaluated the development of b-amyloid plaques in the 2xTg
AD mouse line starting with a time at which mice are usually
considered b-amyloid plaque-free and ending with old mice
with high amyloid plaque burden. Maximum intensity projections
of the entire hemispheres show a gradual progression of amyloid
plaque staining at each time point (Figure 3A, left image). With
whole hemisphere image data, smaller volumes of interest can
be digitally segmented to compare the plaque development pro-
file in any of the prominent structures of the brain (Figure 3A).
With images of the complete population of b-amyloid plaques
in the intact brain hemisphere, we can directly quantify plaque
abundances. The object detection algorithm from the volume im-
age analysis software (Imaris spot detection) was applied to
each of the digitally dissected regions of our AD time profile im-
age data set (Figure 3B). Quantification of each region and age
shows the time course of amyloid plaques appearance in the
2xTg mouse model, starting in the cortex and, surprisingly,
increasing in the cerebellum earlier than in the hippocampus
(Figure 3C). Furthermore, with volume analysis, we have the abil-
ity to evaluate distances, in 3D space, between plaques in a
given region over time (Figure 3D).
Automated Whole Brain Quantitation Using ClearMap
Whole brain image data sets require manual input for region-
specific quantitation. To circumvent this, we applied a recent
tool to streamline region segmentation and allow automated
mapping of segmented data, such as amyloid deposits, to anno-
tated references such as the mouse Allen Brain Atlas (Renier
et al., 2016). This available toolbox for python, called ClearMap,
uses open source modules to rapidly align the autofluorence
reference channel from the aligns light-sheet stacks to a refer-
ence brain (here, a STP reference aligned to the Allen Brain Stan-
dard Annotation). To demonstrate the applicability of ClearMap
for comparative studies on plaque distribution, we performed a
time course evaluation of 2xTg AD mouse brains using rapid
Congo red staining. Intact hemispheres from mice of increasing
age were incubated overnight for convenience (shorter incuba-
tion times are sufficient) in Congo red before clearing and light-
sheet imaging (Figure 3E). In addition to atlas alignment, Clear-
Map also provides object detection, which works especially
well for regular-shaped objects like spherical cell bodies or
b-amyloid plaques. Quantitation can then be reported for any re-
gion of interest annotated in the Allen Brain Atlas. In this case, we
present the 12 regions containing the largest plaque burden in
the oldest mouse tissue (Figure 3F). The combination of Congo
red staining, volume imaging, and ClearMap analysis should
help to streamline the analysis of the plaque burden in mouse
models of AD, as a brain can be prepared overnight, scanned
in under 2 hr on the light sheet microscope, and analyzed in
less than 1 hr.
Combined Volume Imaging of b-Amyloid and Microglia
Detection
High resolution confocal imaging of combined b-amyloid and
TO-PRO-3 staining revealed that each plaque is surrounded by
a perimeter of nuclei forming a nest-like ring (Figure 4A, circles),
suggesting recruitment or displacement of cells, possibly micro-
glia, by the plaques upon amyloid buildup. Though activation of

 microglia has been associated with AD since the mid-1980s
(Vostrikov, 1985; Rozemuller et al., 1986), the role of reactive
gliosis in beneficial plaque clearance or adverse neurotoxicity
is yet to be fully clarified. Staining for glia in wild-type tissue re-
vealed a homogeneous dispersion of densely labeled cells with
discrete arborization (Figure 4B, left image). In comparison, mi-
croglia in the 2xTg model form clustered patterns of more
diffusely labeled cells with enlarged bodies and less discrete
branching (Figure 4B, right image). Upon comparison with the
distribution of b-amyloid, it is evident that the clustered microglia
are principally associated with amyloid plaques. High resolution
volume imaging and surface rendering emphasize that microglia
surrounding the plaques enlarge and envelop the plaques, in
contrast to the smaller, isolated microglia distant from amyloid
plaques (Figure 4C; Movie S3).
Combined Volume Imaging of b-Amyloid and Axonal
Dystrophy
As mentioned previously, it is crucial to reconsider the way we
analyze b-amyloid plaques while emphasizing their surround-
ings. Among the numerous mechanisms contributing to the
dementia associated with AD is the deterioration of axon projec-
tions in proximity of plaques described as dystrophic neurites
(for a review, see Reitz and Mayeux, 2014). Visual access to
axons in intact tissue will aid studies looking to characterize
the toxicity of plaque buildup or evaluate strategies for reversing
axonal dystrophy (Brendza et al., 2005). Simultaneous imaging of
b-amyloid plaques and axon filaments was demonstrated with
Congo red and neurofilament H antibodies, respectively (Fig-
ure 4D). Owing to the high density of axons and abundance of
neurofilament antibody binding sites, labeling is dramatically
reduced beyond 1 mm from the tissue surface. Completeness
of filament labeling is enhanced by sectioning tissue into blocks.
Filaments detected in regions void of b-amyloid plaques were
regular in diameter and largely undisrupted (Figure 4E), whereas
filaments surrounding prominent plaques were markedly dystro-
phic (Figure 4F).
Evaluation of Amyloid Plaques and the Complete Brain
Vascular Network
Because brain vasculature and associated abnormalities remain
an important theme in the deposition and clearance of b-amyloid,
we included a strategy for labeling the full network of brain vascu-
lature. Intact adult 2xTg brains were labeled for amyloid plaques
and blood vessels, providing complete access to the entire brain
vasculature network and total plaque deposition. Combined pla-
que and vasculature imaging was demonstrated with b-amyloid
antibodies and Congo red (Figures 4G and 4H, respectively).
Optimal tissue evaluation would maximize the information ex-
tracted from single brain volumes. A few studies have sug-
gested the removal of antibodies for serial labeling of multiple
targets (Chung et al., 2013; Murray et al., 2015), though this
approach could potentially lead to incomplete stain removal
and difficult image interpretation, especially in intact mouse
brains. Previously used as a background image for topograph-
ical reference, the green spectrum channel can also be utilized
for a third label. Here, we present simultaneous labeling of
b-amyloid plaques, microglia, and vasculature for effective tri-
ple labeling of the entire brain hemisphere. Maximum intensity
projections from sagittal optical sections, rendered columns,
and animations within the mouse brain hemisphere show effi-
cient labeling of all three stains throughout the tissue (Figures
5A–5D; Movie S4). We observed a large occurrence of co-
segregation between the three parameters. Samples of magni-
fied optical sections from the hippocampus show clustered
reactive microglia and blood vessels coincident with amyloid
plaques (Figures 5A and 5E, upper image). Surface rendering
of a magnified optical volume captures the near complete en-
compassing of plaques by the recruited microglia and the im-
mediate proximity of nearby vessels (Figure 5E, lower image;
Movie S4). The flexibility of iDISCO for evaluating AD mouse
models allows for comparison of a large list of potential targets.
As a demonstration of an alternate combination for full brain
analysis, we stained an intact 2xTg AD mouse hemisphere for
vasculature, cell nuclei, and b-amyloid (antibody PAb #10).
From a single block of imaged tissue, we can evaluate amyloid
plaque correlation with the intricate vascular network and
regional cell density (Figures S5A and S5B). Importantly, this
can be achieved from the scale of the whole brain down to the
resolution of a single cell (Figures S5A and S5C).
Variation of TAPs in Archived Brain Tissues from Human
AD Patients
Clearing methods have been previously applied to mouse em-
bryos and various adult mouse tissues including brains. Gaining
insight into amyloidosis in AD pathology necessitates the evalu-
ation of human tissues. With a collection of frozen post-mortem
tissue blocks from nine patients, we applied iDISCO for 3D fluo-
rescence analysis of amyloid plaques in large volumes of human
brain tissue. All archived AD human samples at our disposal
were of hippocampal origin. It is critical to note that these were
fresh-frozen samples, none of which had been handled or pre-
pared in any specific way prior to iDISCO application. Most sam-
ples were effectively labeled, cleared, and imaged with the
iDISCO method. Notably, interesting features of amyloid staining
with PAb #10 were revealed; perhaps most striking was the pres-
ence of complex tertiary structures forming TAPs of up to
27 mm3 (Figure 6A). Volume imaging also revealed a remarkable
3D diversity of individual amyloid plaque morphology and 3D for-
mations ranging from dense, strongly labeled patches to less

 intensely labeled and more isolated plaques. 3D images reveal
TAPs that appear as dense volumes, thin sheets, parallel rib-
bons, and density gradients (Figure 6A, see patient 3, 8, and 9,
respectively). High-magnification volume projection images
again reveal pronounced differences in b-amyloid plaque mor-
phology and size. As with the AD mouse model, staining ap-
peared as large and small spheres, thin filament-like structures,
and vasculature deposits (Figure 6B). Surface rendering high-
lights the dramatic differences in density, shape, and size
between samples (Figure 6B; Movie S5). In addition to visuali-
zation of b-amyloid plaques in large volumes of human tissue,
volume imaging enables direct measurement of amyloidosis
parameters such as individual plaque volume, inter-plaque dis-
tance, and morphological characteristics like sphericity (Fig-
ure 6C). Inclusion of additional markers can increase the
informative value of amyloid volume imaging. As with the
mouse tissue, simultaneous imaging of multiple stains in human
tissue can provide anatomical reference or enable correlative
evaluation. As proof of principle, we present successful double
staining of a human tissue block with PAb #10 and vasculature
(Figure 6D). Volume imaging of amyloid plaques in human brain
tissue can feasibly be combined with any of the previously
demonstrated markers or other iDISCO-compatible stains of
interest.
The origin of AD is still largely debated and scientists remain
divided between two main hypotheses (Ab oligomers and amy-
loid plaques versus Tau-dependent NFTs), while other important
parameters such as inflammation and hormonal regulation
among others are also important. Accordingly, we also applied
iDISCO for volume evaluation of tau in AD tissue, starting with
validation of anti-tau antibody compatibility in 3xTg AD mice
(see Table S1). Optical slices from cleared brain hemispheres
(29-month-old mice) obtained after labeling with anti-tau anti-
bodies show prominent staining in pyramidal neurons in CA1
of the hippocampus, as well as positive staining in the neigh-
boring subiculum and the stratum oriens (Figure 7A; Movie S6).
Full hemisphere imaging shows the expected distribution
throughout the hippocampus and around the entorhinal cortex
(Figure 7B). Double labeling of 3xTg mouse brains (29 months
old) with Congo red and Tau antibodies shows a highly restrictive
parallel distribution of b-amyloid plaques and tau positive cells in
the subiculum (Figures 7C and 7D; Movie S6). Volume images
reveal that the pattern of plaque distribution is dramatically influ-
enced by the selected animal model, as seen when comparing
1xTg, 2xTg, and 3xTg AD mouse models (Figure S6). Interest-
ingly, co-labeling for the two AD hallmarks in human AD brain
samples reveals a degree of regional co-localization. Tau stain-
ing is clearly prominent in dendritic branching of individual cells
as well as thin axons projecting through the cleared tissue
blocks, possibly highlighting the presence of neuropil threads
(Figure 7E).
DISCUSSION
3D Perspective on Neurodegeneration
We have combined the iDISCO clearing method, light-sheet
microscopy, and biochemical and chemical tools relevant to
AD (e.g., b-amyloid antibodies, tau antibodies, Congo red,
axon, vasculature, and microglia detection) to examine the
diseased brains of several AD mouse models and patients in
three dimensions. This revealed clear differences between
mouse brains from AD models and material from patient
brains. Our volume image analysis unveiled strikingly large
patterns of amyloid staining in human brain samples, which
we refer to as TAPs. We did not observe comparable large
amyloid patterns in any of the mouse AD models. This inconsis-
tency highlights a possible difference in the aggregation pro-
cess between human and mouse species. However, it is not
clear if the time required for the TAPs to form is compatible
with studies carried out on mice due to their short life
expectancy.
AD Mouse Models Present Clear Differences Compared
to Human Samples
AD mouse models are in constant need of refinement to address
the biochemical, temporal, and phenotypic discrepancies that
exist between those mouse models and AD pathogenesis (for
a review, see Ashe and Zahs, 2010). b-amyloid plaque distribu-
tion can also dramatically differ between the animal models (Fig-
ure S6). The present work reinforces the notion that better mouse
models are needed, and it offers the possibility of efficiently and
globally evaluating the anatomical and temporal distributions of
AD hallmarks in promising mouse models (Liu et al., 2015) and
future genetic models aiming to better recapitulate the pathology
presented in humans.
Amyloid Plaques, Microglia, and Vasculature
The immune surveillance provided by microglia is an important
topic for AD pathology (for a review, see Aguzzi et al., 2013).
Here, we present detailed 3D renderings and videos that un-
equivocally demonstrate strong association between microglia
and b-amyloid plaques. It is remarkable to observe the targeted
activation of microglia in contact with plaques. The precise
role(s) of microglia segregating around plaques remains unclear,
but their visualization in 3D opens avenues to better understand
where, and perhaps, how they are recruited.
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an integral component
of a series of important disorders strongly associated with
dementia as well as cerebral hemorrhage. It is known that,
in the case of AD, some arteries are more targeted by deposi-
tion of b-amyloid plaques than others (Viswanathan and Green-
berg, 2011; Yarchoan et al., 2012). We demonstrated that
we could visualize such associations and that this is facilitated

 by 3D volume rendering. As such, the present study provides a
relevant
approach
to
examine
the
relationship
between
amyloidosis and CAA. Additionally, further 3D characterization
will help clarify why the amyloid plaques congregate around
blood vessels. Do they have a specific affinity for blood vessels
or, on the contrary, do the plaques appear as a consequence of
other phenomena such as local inflammation, micro-hemor-
rhage, etc.?

 Tau and NFTs
In addition to the effort dedicated to the Ab peptide amyloidosis
in this study, we also examined tau staining in 3D. While we do
not aim here to resolve the long standing Ab-tau debate, tau
and NFTs are important in disease progression, if not generation,
and therefore warrant examination. It is obvious that the
multiple phosphorylation states of Tau considerably increase
the complexity of the problem, especially regarding the antibody
testing for our current approach (Jicha et al., 1997; Espinoza
et al., 2008). We have, however, demonstrated that iDISCO is
an effective method for labeling tau with a number of total and
phospho-specific tau antibodies, allowing for more detailed
evaluation of the volumetric formation of NFTs in the context of
AD mouse models and human tissues, a necessary contribution
toward complete understanding of the disease.
Future Studies
Future studies analyzing large numbers of samples anatomically
identical and from various origins will be necessary to fully
characterize the extent of these TAPs in human samples. Such
large-scale evaluation might allow correlation studies, such as
indexing TAPs and ultimately matching them with specific symp-
toms or clinical traits documented prior to death. While diagnosis
of individual patient TAPs might remain limited mostly to post-
mortem samples and brain biopsies, we do foresee that compre-
hensive retrospective analyses may even help categorize
patients based on specific 3D pathological features, will
contribute to the understanding of some clinical trial failures by
retrospective identification of responsive or non-responsive
groups, and, ideally, might aid the categorization of patients for
future clinical trials. It will be also informative to compare familial
versus sporadic AD TAPs, and determine if specific familial AD
mutations correspond to unique TAPs. Furthermore, a similar
approach using iDISCO clearing should be easily transposable
to any form of amyloidosis or related diseases, including non-
AD dementias such as vascular dementia (O’Brien and Thomas,
2015), frontotemporal dementia (Bang et al., 2015), dementia
with Lewy bodies (Goldberg et al., 2015), and transmissible de-
mentia (Watts and Prusiner, 2014; Sanders et al., 2016). This
work also may have the potential to advance the evaluation stra-
tegies for therapeutic approaches in preclinical stages such as
immunotherapies (Wisniewski and Gon
˜ i, 2015).
In conclusion, we believe that the discovery of large TAPs and
the surprising complexity of amyloid plaques in human (but not
mouse) brain samples may help revisit disease classification
and lead to a better understanding of the initial causes of AD.
In more general terms, the methodology developed here to
detect b-amyloid plaques in their 3D context, both in murine
and human brains, and allowing for the study of up to three
markers at a time, including tau protein, is a valuable approach
to tackling various characteristics of Ab-amyloidogenesis and
amyloidogenesis in general.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mouse Line Genotypes and Related Work
All procedures were approved by the Rockefeller University Institutional Ani-
mal Care and Use Committee. All mice were housed with a 12 hr light/12 hr
dark cycle and fed ad libitum. Transgenic mouse lines (2xTg: APPswe/
PSEN1dE9;
1xTg:
Tg2576
harboring
HuAPP695.KM670/671NL;
3xTg:
PS1M146V, APPswe and tauP301L], and C57BL/6J WT mice were obtained
from The Jackson Laboratory). Mice were anesthetized via Nembutal intraper-
itoneal (i.p.) injection (50–100 ml) and intracardiac perfusion was performed first
with 20 ml ice cold PBS then 20 ml ice cold PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde.
Dissected cerebral tissue was post-fixed overnight in PBS with 4% parafor-
maldehyde (PFA) at 4�C followed by 1 hr at room temperature.
Human Tissue Origin and Related Work
Frozen human hippocampal brains blocks were obtained from the New York
Brain Bank (Columbia University, Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Taub
Institute) in agreement with our Institutional Review Board. The brain tissues
were collected from autopsied patients with AD clinical diagnosis as well as
post-mortem histo-pathological signature for AD. Frozen tissue kept at
�80�C was cut into blocks approximately 0.125 cm3 and defrosted on ice
for 20 min before fixation in PBS with 4% PFA overnight at 4�C and 1 hr at
room temperature.
Tissue Permeabilization
Tissue was pretreated following the methanol protocol provided in Renier et al.
(2014). Briefly, whole brains were dehydrated with gradual addition of meth-
anol in PBS (50% 3 1, 80% 3 1, 100% 3 2, each for 1 hr). Overnight bleaching
with a 1:5 ratio of hydrogen peroxide:methanol was done at 4�C. Tissue was
then gradually rehydrated in PBS by removing methanol at 20% increments
(1 hr for each step, followed by two additional washes in PBS). Detergent
washing was then performed in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 (2 3 1 hr).
Immunolabeling
To block any residual active aldehyde groups, tissue was incubated overnight
at 37�C in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.3 M glycine, followed by blocking
in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 and 6% normal goat serum. Blocking and stain-
ing incubation times were 7 days for whole hemispheres and 2 days/mm
(maximum of 7 days) for sectioned blocks. For 7 day incubation steps,
0.02% sodium azide was included to prevent contaminants. Following block-
ing, the tissue was washed for 1 hr twice in PBS with 0.2% Tween-20 and
10 mg/ml heparin (PTwH). Antibodies were applied for the indicated time in
PTwH with 3% NGS at 37�C with rocking. Excess primary antibodies were
washed for 1 day in PTwH with periodic solution changes before starting incu-
bation of secondary antibodies. After secondary antibody labeling, tissue was
washed in PTwH for 2 days with periodic solution changes.
For vasculature staining, tissue was fixed in 4% PFA without perfusion to
preserve the endogenous immunoglobulins. Dye-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies (1:100 dilution) against the tissue species were then used without
need of primary antibodies. There were no detectable differences in amyloid
plaque and glial staining in the non-perfused tissue.
Primary antibodies against amyloid plaques and NFTs were selected by eval-
uation on 1–2 mm tissue sections after methanol pretreatment described in the
iDISCO protocol (Renier et al., 2014) and are listed in Table S1. Microglia and
neuronal axons were labeled with rabbit Iba1 antibodies from Wako Chemicals
and chicken neurofilament antibodies from EMD Millipore. Secondary anti-
bodies were selected based on the number of labels in a given sample. Alexa
647, if available as a conjugate against the respective primary antibody, was
prioritized for single labels, followed by Alexa 568 as a second label, and Alexa
488 as a third label as demonstrated with vasculature staining. Autofluores-
cence was imaged using 488 nm excitation, eliminating the option for simulta-
neous Alexa 488 staining. Secondary antibody concentrations were matched
to that of the respective primary antibody, with a maximum limit of 20 mg/ml.
For samples additionally stained with chemical dyes, the respective dye was
included in the secondary antibody incubation step. For samples stained
solely with a chemical dye, the respective dye was incubated at 37�C in
PTwH for 2 days before 2 days of washing and clearing. On samples labeled
with dye for volume imaging, Congo red and TO-PRO-3 were used at 10 mM
and 2 mM, respectively.
Standard immunofluorescence labeling was done on 45 mm cryosections.
Sections were washed in PBS for 20 min and PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100
for 20 min then blocked in PBS with 6% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton
1150
Cell Reports 16, 1138–1152, July 26, 2016
 X-100 for 1 hr, all at room temperature (RT) with rocking. b-amyloid was
stained overnight at 4�C in PBS with 3% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton
X-100 (anti-b-amyloid, 1:250; Congo red, 3.3 mM). Slices were washed 3 3
10 min in PBS prior to secondary labeling (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 647, 1:250)
for 2 hr at RT and washed in PBS 3 3 10 min before imaging.
IHC
Mouse brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sci-
ences), washed with PBS, and incubated in 25% sucrose for 48 hr. Brains
were then frozen on dry ice with freezing medium (VWR) and sliced in 50 mm
sections. Sections were stained using PAb #10 and a DAB Peroxidase Sub-
strate Kit (Vector Laboratories). Sections were imaged using a wide field mi-
croscope at 2.53 with a QI Click color digital camera. Images were assembled
using the Fiji plugin for ImageJ (Preibisch et al., 2009).
Tissue Clearing
After washing away excess secondary antibodies, optical clearing of iDISCO
samples was performed as described in Renier et al. (2014). Tissue was grad-
ually dehydrated in resistant glassware with tetrahydrofuran in water (50% 3 1,
80% 3 1, 100% 3 2, 1 hr each). Remaining lipids were extracted with dichloro-
methane for 1 hr and dibenzyl ether (DBE) was used for refractive index match-
ing. Samples were kept in a full vial of DBE. Samples stained with Congo red
for automated ClearMap analysis were treated with a modified protocol to
allow for anatomical alignment described in Renier et al. (2016). The most sig-
nificant change is removal of tetrahydrofuran to avoid shrinkage of some tissue
layers that prevents effective atlas matching.
Imaging and Image Processing
Images of large samples were principally acquired on a light-sheet ultramicro-
scope (Ultramicroscope II, LaVision BioTec). High resolution images were
takes on a confocal (Zeiss 710 LSM) or multi-photon (FV1000MPE Fluoview,
Olympus). The light-sheet and multi-photon microscopes were provided by
the Bio-Imaging Resource Center of The Rockefeller University. All cleared tis-
sue images were acquired with tissue submerged in DBE. Volume images
were acquired with 16-bit depth to allow for a broad range of intensity values
and rendered using Imaris software from Bitplane.
The ultramicroscope was used with a fixed 23/0.5 N.A. MVPLAPO objec-
tive. Exposure time was 100 ms for each frame, spaced axially with a 2.5 mm
interval. Laser intensities were set to prevent saturated pixels (typically
50% to 70% of maximum power). The following laser excitations were used:
autofluorescence and Alexa 488, 488 nm; Alexa 568, 561 nm; and Alexa
647, 640 nm. Images were taken with an Andor Neo sCMOS (2,160 3 2,560
pixels).
For visualization of volume images, gamma corrections and background
subtractions were applied to reveal the range of staining intensities and re-
move global background signal, respectively, for each data set. Automated
amyloid plaque detection was done with the Imaris ‘‘spots’’ feature, using an
estimated diameter of 30 mm and minimum threshold values for maximum
peak intensity (3,000) and SD (500) that most accurately detected visible pla-
ques in random test regions without including background signal. Digital
dissection of volumes was done with Imaris by manual tracing of autofluores-
cence channels at appropriately spaced planes, typically 250 mm and 50 mm
for large and small surfaces, respectively. Surface rendering for small volumes
of amyloid plaques, glia, and vessels was automated on Imaris, with manual
threshold adjustments for each channel to remove background.
Automated Quantitation with ClearMap
ClearMap, a light-sheet image analysis toolbox, is available upon request by au-
thors (Renier et al., 2016). The free package operates on a Linux operating sys-
tem with python programming software. Light-sheet images were collected
from autofluorescence (488 nm at 100%, 50 ms exposure) and Congo red
(561 nm at 100%, 50 ms exposure, this time with a 20-point horizontal focus
and contrast blending). Autofluorescence images were applied for automated
alignment to the Allen Brain Atlas, and Congo red images were used for object
detection. ClearMap detection parameters for the plaques were: background
subtraction (7 pixels), difference of Gaussian filter (4,4,6), extended maxima
h-max (20) and size (5 pixels), and cell shape threshold (125).
