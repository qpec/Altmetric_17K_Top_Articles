ABSTRACT
Background Higher screen time is associated with
type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk in adults, but the association
with T2D risk markers in children is unclear. We
examined associations between self-reported screen time
and T2D risk markers in children.
Methods Survey of 4495 children aged 9–10 years
who had fasting cardiometabolic risk marker
assessments, anthropometry measurements and reported
daily screen time; objective physical activity was
measured in a subset of 2031 children.
Results Compared with an hour or less screen time
daily, those reporting screen time over 3 hours had
higher ponderal index (1.9%, 95% CI 0.5% to 3.4%),
skinfold thickness (4.5%, 0.2% to 8.8%), fat mass
index (3.3%, 0.0% to 6.7%), leptin (9.2%, 1.1% to
18.0%) and insulin resistance (10.5%, 4.9% to 16.4%);
associations with glucose, HbA1c, physical activity and
cardiovascular risk markers were weak or absent.
Associations with insulin resistance remained after
adjustment for adiposity, socioeconomic markers and
physical activity.
Conclusions Strong graded associations between
screen time, adiposity and insulin resistance suggest that
reducing screen time could facilitate early T2D
prevention. While these observations are of considerable
public health interest, evidence from randomised
controlled trials is needed to suggest causality.
INTRODUCTION
The global prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D),
overweight and obesity has been increasing in
adults as well as adolescents and children.1
2
Awareness of the early determinants of adiposity
and T2D risk in young people may be important
for reducing risks of T2D and obesity across the
life course. The health effects of activities that
encourage sedentary behaviour, such as time spent
watching television, using computers or games con-
soles (together referred to as ‘screen time’) have
been a particular focus. Increased screen time has
been prospectively associated with adiposity3 and
T2D risk in adults.4 Studies have shown graded
positive
associations
between
prolonged
screen
time and adiposity in childhood.5 6 However, less
is known about the effects of prolonged screen
time on T2D risk markers in childhood, particu-
larly insulin resistance (IR) and glycaemia. Such
associations could be of public health importance
in providing evidence-based recommendations for
healthy screen-time duration, especially as recent
trends suggest that screen time is increasing in
childhood.7 W
e therefore examined the association
between self-reported daily screen time and risk
markers for T2D and cardiovascular disease, in a
large-scale multi-ethnic population-based study of
children aged 9–10 years.
METHODS
The Child Heart and Health Study in England
(CHASE) was a cross-sectional survey of cardiovas-
cular
health
in
UK
schoolchildren
of
white
European,
black
African-Caribbean
and
South
Asian origin aged 9–10 years carried out in a
sample
of
200
primary
schools
in
London,
Birmingham and Leicester; full details of the study
have been reported elsewhere.8–10 Ethical approval
for the study was obtained from the relevant multi-
centre ethics committee. A single survey team
carried out all measurements between October
2004 and February 2007. Children’s ethnic origin
was based on the ethnicity of both parents or
(where not available) the parentally defined ethni-
city of the child; in a small proportion of children
where this was not available (1%), child informa-
tion on the place of birth of parents and grandpar-
ents was used to define ethnicity. Ethnic group was
classified as ‘white European’, which includes those
of white European including white British ethni-
city;
‘black
African-Caribbean’,
which
includes
black African, black Caribbean and black other;
‘South Asian’, which includes Indian, Pakistani,
What is already known on this topic?
▸ Increased screen time is prospectively
associated with adiposity and type 2 diabetes
in adults.
▸ Evidence suggests graded associations between
screen time and adiposity in children.
What this study adds?
▸ This study demonstrated strong graded positive
associations between screen time, adiposity
and risk markers for type 2 diabetes
(particularly insulin resistance) in children.
▸ The associations between screen time and
insulin resistance markers were largely
independent of socioeconomic status, pubertal
status, objectively measured physical activity
and adiposity.

 Bangladeshi and South Asian other; those of mixed or other
ethnic origins were included in an ‘other ethnic groups’ cat-
egory. Socioeconomic status was based on self-reported parental
occupation (highest of mother or father) and coded using the
National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC).11
Height was measured to the last complete millimetre using a
portable stadiometer (Chasmors, London, UK) and weight was
measured using an electronic digital scale (Tanita, Tokyo,
Japan). Ponderal index was calculated as a weight divided by
height cubed (kg/m3), providing a weight for height measure
which was largely independent of height in the study popula-
tion. Right-sided skinfolds were measured at four locations
(biceps,
triceps,
subscapular,
suprailiac)
and
summed.
Hand-to-foot bioimpedance was measured using the Bodystat
1500 bioimpedance monitor (Bodystat, Isle of Man, UK); fat
mass was derived using ethnic and sex-specific validated equa-
tions12 and presented as a fat mass index (fat mass/height5),
which was independent of height. Blood samples were collected
after an overnight fast. HbA1c was analysed in whole blood by
ion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography. Plasma
glucose was measured using the hexokinase method; triglycer-
ide, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and total choles-
terol were measured in serum using an Olympus autoanalyser.
Insulin was measured in serum using an ELISA method,13 C
reactive protein (CRP) using ultra-sensitive nephelometry and
leptin using a radioimmunoassay. Homeostasis model assessment
(HOMA) equations provided an estimate of IR.14 Seated blood
pressure was measured twice in the right arm after 5 min rest
using an Omron 907 blood pressure monitor and adjusted for
appropriate cuff size15; average systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sures were calculated from the two readings. In a subset of chil-
dren in the last 80 schools studied, objective physical activity
counts and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(MVPA) were measured using a waist-worn accelerometer
(ActiGraph
GT1M,
ActiGraph,
Pensacola,
Florida,
USA).9
Pubertal status was measured in girls only, using the Tanner
breast development score.16 Child questionnaires administered
on the same day that physical measurements were taken asked,
‘How many hours each day do you spend watching television or
video and playing computer games?’ and children were asked to
tick one of the following options: ‘none; an hour or less; one to
two hours; two to three hours or more than three hours’.
Outcomes following approximately log-normal distributions
were log-transformed; geometric means and percentage differ-
ences are presented for log-transformed variables. W
e compared
differences in outcomes by self-reported screen time category
using those that reported ‘an hour or less of screen-time’ as a
reference group and tested for a linear trend using multilevel
linear regression models adjusted for sex, age (in quartiles) eth-
nicity and month as fixed effects. The intraclass correlation
(ICC) for school-level clustering was between 0.02 and 0.09 for
all cardiometabolic risk markers and physical activity counts and
was higher for time spent in MVPA (ICC=0.32); hence, it was
important to adjust for school as a random effect to account for
clustering of children within schools. The effect of adjustment
for socioeconomic status (NS-SEC), pubertal status (girls only)
and physical activity was assessed because these are potential
confounders of the association between screen time and diabetic
risk markers. Further adjustment for adiposity was also made,
acknowledging that this may be a potential mediator. W
e exam-
ined whether associations between screen time and outcome
variables were consistent in boys and girls and in different
ethnic groups by testing for an interaction between screen time
and sex or ethnic group.
RESULTS
Of the 8641 children who were invited, 5887 (68%) took part
in the study. Of these, 4884 (83%) provided a fasting blood

 sample. Analyses focused on 4495 children (2337 girls and
2158 boys), average age 9.9 years (95% reference range 9.2 to
10.7 years), who answered the question on daily screen time,
had full anthropometric measurements and a fasting blood
sample. Of these, 2031 children also had measurements of phys-
ical activity using accelerometery. Participant characteristics are
shown in online supplementary table S1, including mean age of
participants, gender and ethnic balance, head of household
socioeconomic
classification
and
month
of
measurement.
Overall 4% of the study population reported no screen time,
37% reported an hour or less, 28% reported 1–2 hours, 13%
reported 2–3 hours and 18% reported more than 3 hours of
screen time. A larger proportion of boys (22%) than girls (14%)
reported more than 3 hours of daily screen time. A higher pro-
portion of black African-Caribbeans (23%) reported more than
3 hours of daily screen time compared with white Europeans
(16%) and South Asians (16%). Adiposity and cardiometabolic
risk markers are shown by sex and overall in table 1. In general,
girls had higher levels of adiposity markers, leptin, fasting
insulin, IR, triglyceride, CRP and lower levels of fasting glucose
and HDL cholesterol than boys; girls had lower levels of phys-
ical activity counts and time spent in MVPA than boys. There
were trends between screen time and ponderal index, sum of
skinfolds and fat mass index (table 2). Levels of these adiposity
variables were higher among children who reported more than
3 hours of screen time compared with those who reported an
hour or less of screen time. There was a strong trend between
screen time, leptin, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR (table 2).
Children who reported more than 3 hours of screen time had
higher levels of leptin (9.2%, 95% CI 1.1% to 18.0%), insulin
(10.7%, 5.1% to 16.7%) and HOMA-IR (10.5%, 4.9% to
16.4%) compared with those who reported an hour or less.
Adjustment for fat mass index reduced effect sizes for insulin
and IR by approximately one-quarter (7.9%, 95% CI 2.9% to
13.1%; 7.7%, 2.8% to 13.0% respectively). There was a border-
line significant trend between screen time and triglycerides and
physical activity counts and time spent in MVPA. There was no
formal evidence of a trend between screen time and HbA1c,
fasting glucose and other cardiovascular risk factors, including
lipids and blood pressure (even with further adjustment for
height). Associations between screen time and fasting insulin,
IR, ponderal index, sum of skinfolds and fat mass index were
not appreciably affected by adjustment for socioeconomic status
or physical activity measures in a subset (ie, the magnitude of
associations were similar and statistically significant associations
remained significant). Adjustment for pubertal status in girls
slightly weakened associations for IR markers though associa-
tions for fasting insulin and HOMA-IR remained statistically sig-
nificant; associations for adiposity markers were attenuated
though the association with ponderal index remained statistic-
ally significant. There was no evidence that associations differed
in boys and girls and between ethnic groups (all tests for inter-
action p≥0.05, data available from authors).
DISCUSSION
The present study showed an association between screen time
and measures of adiposity, which has previously been observed
in prospective studies of children.5 W
e extend these observations
by demonstrating strong graded associations with T2D risk
factors, particularly IR (although not glucose or HbA1c).
The association for IR was independent of socioeconomic
markers, pubertal status and objectively measured physical

 activity levels. The association with IR was substantially inde-
pendent of adiposity (fat mass index).
Strengths of the present study include the large sample size,
measurement of key T2D risk markers including IR17 18 and the
assessment of potential confounders including socioeconomic
markers, pubertal status and physical activity. The children in
the study were asked about the amount of time spent watching
television, video or playing computer games which was appro-
priate to capture ‘screen-time’ when the study was conducted in
2004–2007. Studies in current settings would also need to take
account of the use of more recently introduced electronic
devices, for example, electronic tablets and smartphones, also
potentially related to sedentary behaviour, which are now more
widely used by children. Pubertal status was only assessed in
girls in the present study, as evidence suggests that age of puber-
tal onset in boys is substantially higher than that in our study
population.19–21 The CHASE study was powered to detect small
(∼0.2 SD) ethnic differences in risk markers presented here;
however, we have been able to estimate associations between
screen time and adiposity and cardiometabolic risk markers
with narrow CIs, suggesting a high level of precision. Although
the study response rate was modest, the characteristics of partici-
pants who provided a fasting blood sample were mostly similar
to participants who did not.10 The participants in this study
were recruited from three UK cities (London, Birmingham and
Leicester) which together account for two-thirds of South Asians
and black African-Caribbeans in the UK. The study sample is
therefore likely to be representative of these ethnic minority
populations; it may be less representative of white Europeans, as
they were recruited from the same schools as the ethnic minority
participants. However, the representativeness is unlikely to have
biased the association between screen time and IR.22
While the present findings are of considerable potential
public health interest, evidence from randomised controlled
trials is needed to establish causality. Intervention studies in chil-
dren showing decreased body size associated with reduced
screen time are supportive of a causal effect,23
24 although
causal associations between screen viewing and early T2D risk
factors remain to be established. Future studies could illuminate
the causal pathways by which screen time manifests itself such
as diet and lack of breaks in sedentary behaviour as well as
decreased
physical
activity.
Recommendations
from
the
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) previously suggested that
children should limit daily screen-time to <2 hours,25 although
the most recent AAP guidance did not propose a time-limit,
instead suggesting that parents should place consistent limits
on hours per day of media use,26 proposing a more pragmatic
interpretation given the pervasive use of electronic devices.7
However, such limitations, which may be beneficial for other
aspects of health, must not overlook the underlying sedentary
nature of screen-related activities and their potential impact on
metabolic health. Our findings suggest that reducing screen time
may be beneficial in reducing T2D risk factors, in both boys and
girls and in different ethnic groups from an early age. This is
particularly relevant, given rising levels of T2D, the early emer-
gence
of
T2D
risk1
and
recent
trends
suggesting
that
screen-time-related activities are increasing in childhood7 and
may pattern screen-related behaviours in later life.27

Breastfeeding and obesity
A number of observational cohort studies, including some from the UK, have shown lower 
rates of long-term obesity in children who are breastfed for longer. This is one of the many 
potential benefits used to encourage hesitant new mothers. However all these studies are 
inevitably biassed by confounding: whatever it is that makes a mother choose to breastfeed is 
associated with other, sometimes unmeasurable, favourable parenting practices. Thus only a 
randomised trial could show any true benefit.
This has now effectively been done: a long-term study in Belarus recruited over 17 000 
mother-infant pairs who were already breastfeeding back in 1996–7 (Martin R et al. JAMA 
Pediatr 2017. doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2017.0698). Using a cluster-randomisation method, 
the 31 polyclinics that they were attending were randomised to undertake either a breast-
feeding promotion scheme based on the internationally recognised Baby-Friendly Hospital 
initiative, or usual care as controls. The promotion scheme was very effective: 45% of those in 
it were exclusively breastfeeding at 3 months compared with 6% among the controls.
These children have now been followed to age 16 years: an age at which their adult obesity 
trajectory will probably have become inevitable. The results give no comfort to promoters of 
breastfeeding: there was no reduction in BMI or obesity rates in the intervention group, either 
in the earlier years or at 16. In fact if anything they were heavier than controls (OR for BMI 
≥ 85th centile 1.14; 95% 
CI 1.0 to 1.3). The only measurable benefit seen in the intervention 
group was more rapid vertical growth post-infancy. Blood pressure was also measured and did 
not differ significantly.
This is obviously disappointing but some caveats are needed: first, this was not a compar-
ison of breast vs formula feeding from birth, as all received some breast milk, although for 
only a few weeks in the controls. Second, the social and cultural circumstances in Belarus 
may have been quite different to Western European and North American communities, where 
obesity is more prevalent anyway, and the results are not necessarily generalisable.
So breastfeeding, a practice so beneficial that it seems to prevent almost everything bad, has 
come up against obesity, a societal problem so intractable that almost no public health inter-
vention seems to prevent it, and failed to deliver. We have to keep looking for other solutions.
