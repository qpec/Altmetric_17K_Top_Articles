Research indicatesthat the motoractionpattern of yawning functionsto promote
cortical arousal and state change through enhanced intracranial circulation and
brain cooling. Because the magnitude of this response likely corresponds to the
degree of neurophysiological change, we hypothesized that interspecies vari-
ation in yawn duration would correlate with underlying neurological
differences. Using openly accessible data, we show that both the mean and var-
iance in yawn duration are robust predictors of mammalian brain weight and
cortical neuron number (r-values . 0.9). Consistent with these effects, primates
tend to have longer and more variable yawn durations compared with other
mammals. Although yawning has long been considered a stereotyped action
pattern, these findings reveal substantial variation in this response and highlight
the importance of measuring yawn duration in future research.
1. Background
Yawning is characterized by a powerful gaping of the jaw with inspiration, a
brief period of peak muscle contraction and a passive closure of the jaw with
shorter expiration [1]. Yawn-like mandibular gaping patterns have been ident-
ified across vertebrate classes [2], though it remains unknown whether the jaw
stretching observed in fish, amphibians and reptiles functions in the same way
as yawns in birds and mammals [3]. Nonetheless, the relative ubiquity of this
response in vertebrates suggests it is an evolutionarily conserved behaviour
that holds basic and important adaptive value. Although the function to
yawning remains debated [3–6], previous research supports a role in promot-
ing cortical arousal and state change [7–11] through enhanced intracranial
circulation and brain cooling [12–13].
Yawning is controlled by several neurotransmitters and neuropeptides [14]
and has been linked with numerous neurological diseases and clinical con-
ditions [15–16]. Despite the potential applications of studying differences in
yawning as a marker of neural processing, variation in this response has yet
to be fully explored. Naturalistic reports on the frequency of yawning across
taxa are quite limited [17,18], and yawns have long been considered a stereo-
typed action pattern with limited variation in expression within or between
species [8]. However, recent studies on non-human primates have identified
previously overlooked variation in the mouth aperture associated with
yawning, and it has been shown that different forms of yawning tend to
correspond to distinct contexts and situations [18,19].
Another measure of variability that could be easily catalogued across
species is the duration of yawning. Although early research examined average
yawn duration in humans (approx. 6 s) [8], this variable has not been used in
studies of non-human animals. Given that the primary circulatory effects
associated with yawning are localized within the skull, differences in the dur-
ation or magnitude of this response likely correspond to the degree of
neurophysiological change. Therefore, we hypothesize that differences in
yawn duration will correlate with neurological variation between species.

 Here, we examine this possibility by linking openly acces-
sible videos of yawning from the Internet (primarily from
www.youtube.com)
to
previously
published
brain
par-
ameters in a representative sample of mammalian taxa [20].
Based on previous research supporting a neurophysiological
function to yawning, we hypothesized that mammals with
larger brains would yawn longer, even when controlling for
body size, and that yawn duration would correlate with
number of cortical neurons.
2. Methods
The Roth & Dicke [20] paper on mammalian brain evolution and
intelligence was used as a guide for identifying yawns across a
representative sample of mammalian taxa [20]. This publication
provides average brain weight, encephalization quotient (EQ)
and cortical neuron number (where applicable) for 29 selected
mammalian taxa (see [20] p. 251, table 1). Using this list, one
researcher attempted to find up to a dozen individuals yawning
from each mammalian taxa (though this number was only
achieved
for
humans)
by
using
openly
accessible
video
clips from the Internet. This resulted in primarily accessing
www.youtube.com, along with the video search tool on www.
google.com. Once a video was identified, the researcher noted
the time(s) at which the yawn(s) on the clip occurred and the
duration of all yawning events using the operational definition
provided by Barbizet [1] to the nearest 0.01 s using the stop-
watch feature on an iPhone. When possible, the researcher also
noted for each yawn whether the animal was an adult or sub-
adult.
In
order
to
obtain
inter-rater
reliability
on
yawn
duration, a second research assistant who was blind to the
hypothesis was provided with the same list and set of instruc-
tions, but in this case was asked to identify only two to three
yawns from each taxon. As expected, this additional search
resulted in a significant overlap in the videos initially identified
(37.7%).
Both
researchers
also
independently
scored
an
additional set of seven videos, and the overall inter-rater
reliability for yawn duration for video clips scored by both
research assistants was very high (r ¼ 0.960). A third researcher
then confirmed all yawns from both searches.
The average yawn duration was calculated for each taxon by
summing all the respective durations from that group and
dividing by the number of yawners. In cases where the same
individual displayed multiple yawns in a given video, the aver-
age duration for this animal was used as a single data point
when generating the overall average for that taxon to avoid
pseudo-replication. One video with multiple yawning clips
from a litter of kittens was excluded owing to the inability to
distinguish between individuals. There were also nine cases
where the start or end of the yawn was not clear (e.g. video
began when the animal was already yawning, the animal was
looking away during the execution of the yawn or there was
no clear endpoint to identify), and these were removed from
the analysis. In addition, there were a total of five videos with
URLs that were no longer available on www.youtube.com,
and thus could not be confirmed and were removed. Lastly,
two videos that were duplicates with different URLs (one rat,
one chimpanzee) were also removed from the analysis. In
total, 205 full yawns were confirmed from 177 individuals
across the following 24 taxa (see supplementary material for
URLs and full dataset): African elephant (1), camel (5), capuchin
monkey (1), cat (9), chimpanzee (9), dog (12), fox (10), gibbon
(6), gorilla (7), hedgehog (12), horse (7), human (27), lion (7),
marmoset (3), mouse (6), opossum (9), rabbit (12), rat (13),
rhesus monkey (2), sheep (3), squirrel (8), squirrel monkey (1),
walrus (4) and white-fronted capuchin (3). In addition, the over-
all mean yawn duration from nine African elephants was
provided from the lead investigator of an ongoing study (Ben
Hart 2016, personal communication).
The taxon averages for yawn duration were then linked to the
brain weight, EQ and cortical neuron data [20]. In cases where
ranges were applied for brain weight and EQ, the average of
the ranges was used. Standard error of mean (s.e.m.) duration

 was used as a measure of variance. Owing to the non-normal dis-
tribution of all variables of interest (as measured by skewness
and kurtosis), a non-parametric Spearman’s correlation was
used to assess the linear relationships. Given notable differences
in brain size and cortical neuron number among primates, a
Mann–Whitney
test was used
to compare average yawn
durations and s.e.m. of yawn duration between primates and
other mammals. Because brain parameters were based on adult
averages, analyses below were performed using only taxa with
at
least
three
representative
adult
yawns.
This
reduced
the original sample from 24 to 19 taxa and from a combined
186 to 109 individual data points. Importantly, however, none
of the following results change when including the remaining
taxa with fewer than three adult yawns, combining all adult
and subadult data or just using subadult data (see electronic
supplementary material).
3. Results
Analyses revealed that average yawn duration is a robust
predictor of brain size and cortical neuron number across mam-
mals. In particular, average yawn duration was highly
correlated with brain weight (r19 ¼ 0.911, p , 0.001; figure 1a),
and this relationship remained significant after taking into
account
relative
brain
size
(EQ)
(r19 ¼ 0.651,
p , 0.005;
figure
1b).
Yawn
duration
was
also
highly
correlated
with the number of cortical neurons between taxa (r12 ¼
0.951, p , 0.001; figure 1c). The steepest rises in yawn duration
(approx. 0.8–2.6 s) occurred within a narrow range of brain
weight and cortical neuron number (approx. 0.3–60 g; 4–600
million), with a comparatively smaller difference in duration
observed for larger
brain
masses
and cortical neurons
(60–4200 g; 600–11 500 million). As expected from these overall
relationships, yawns from primates were significantly longer
than from other mammals (Z ¼ 2.129, p , 0.05; figure 2).
Furthermore, within-taxon variance in yawn duration was
highly correlated with mean duration (r18 ¼ 0.902, p , 0.001)
and all three neurological parameters (brain weight: r18 ¼
0.921, p , 0.001; EQ: r18 ¼ 0.632, p , 0.005; cortical neurons:
r11 ¼ 0.966, p , 0.001). Similarly, variance in yawn duration
was higher for primates compared with other mammals
(Z ¼ 2.224, p , 0.05). Importantly, within-taxon variance
in yawn duration was not related to taxon sample size
(r18 ¼ 0.057,
p ¼ 0.821)
and
therefore
does
not
reflect
sampling error.
4. Discussion
Although yawning has been considered a stereotyped action
pattern [8], we document substantial variation in the duration
of this response in mammals. In particular, we found that
both the mean and variance in yawn duration are robust
predictors of brain weight and cortical neuron number
(r-values . 0.9). Consistent with these results, we also
found that primates tend to have longer and more variable
yawn durations compared with other mammals. These
results apply irrespective of variation in the mouth aperture
of yawns in some non-human primates [18,19].
These combined effects represent a striking scaling
relationship between brain and behaviour. Importantly,
neither the size of the body nor the anatomical structures
specific to yawning (cranium and mandible) are driving
these effects, because gorillas, camels, horses, lions, walruses
and African elephants all have shorter average yawns
than humans. Furthermore, having a larger skull does not
necessitate more variable motor pattern duration. Instead,
differences in yawn duration appear to be specifically linked
to interspecies variation in brain size and complexity, with cor-
tical neuron number being the most significant factor. Future
research should investigate whether mean and variation in
yawn duration also predict similar brain parameters recently
documented across avian taxa [21].
These findings are consistent with the view that yawning
holds a basic neurophysiological function. In particular, previous
research suggests that yawning is an adaptation to enhance intra-
cranial circulation and brain cooling [11–13], which in turn could
promote cortical arousal and state change [7–9]. While the neural
structures necessary for yawning appear to be located within the
brainstem [22], based on these results, we hypothesize that the
neurophysiological consequences of yawning affect the brain
more globally, whereby longer yawns may be necessary to
more effectively modulate cortical arousal for animals with
larger and more complex brains. Furthermore, we predict that
the greater within-taxon variance in yawn duration observed
for large-brained mammals may be related to increased cognitive
capacities and more variable behavioural repertories. We note
that while a primarily social/communication (i.e. signalling)
function to yawning has been posited [4], it is unclear how
such an explanation would account for the current effects.

distinction of being the least understood, common, human

 behavior’. Unfortunately, 30 years later, we still know relatively
little about the biological significance of this evolutionarily con-
served response. The difficulty in uncovering the ultimate
function(s) of yawning may, in part, be owing to the fact that
it can be elicited by numerous stimuli and researchers have by
and large overlooked subtle distinctions in the expression of
this behaviour. Based on the current findings, we believe
yawn duration deserves further attention. We close by offering
suggestions for future research in this area (table 1).
