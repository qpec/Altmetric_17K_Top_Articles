Abstract
Introduction—Variation in treatment and survival outcomes for Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer 
(NSCLC) is high among patients with stage III or IV, but untreated NSCLC patients have not been 
critically analyzed to evaluate for improvable outcomes. We evaluated treatment trends and their 
association with oncologic outcomes for NSCLC, hypothesizing that there are a substantial 
number of untreated patients who are similar to patients who undergo treatment.
Methods—Linear regression was used to calculate trends in utilization of treatment. Kaplan-
Meier and Cox regression modeling were used to determine predictors of receiving treatment. 
Propensity-matching was used to compare survival among subsets of treated versus untreated 
patients.
Results—Patients with primary NSCLC were identified from the National Cancer Data base 
from 1998–2012 and 21% (190,539) of patients received no treatment. For stage IIIA and IV, the 
proportion of untreated patients increased over the study period by 0.21% and 0.4% respectively

 (p= 0.003, <0.0001). Regardless of stage, untreated patients had significantly shorter OS 
(p<0.0001). Propensity-matched analyses of 6,144 stage IIIA patient pairs treated with 
chemoradiation vs no treatment confirmed shorter OS for untreated patients (Median, 16.5 vs 6.1 
months, p <0.0001). For 19,046 stage IV patient pairs treated with chemotherapy vs no treatment, 
similar results were obtained (Median OS, 9.3 vs 2.0 months, p<0.0001).
Conclusions—The proportion of untreated stage IIIA and IV patients is increasing. Survival 
outcomes among advanced stage patients are superior with treatment, independent of selection 
bias. The benefits and risks of treatment should be carefully assessed prior to choosing to forego 
treatment.
Introduction
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the number one cause of cancer-related death in the 
US, with an estimated 158,080 deaths in 2016.1 Despite the introduction of new systemic 
treatment approaches, 5-year survival remains dismal at approximately 17%.2 Despite 
changing demographics, such as greater numbers of women who are younger and who have 
better performance status patients and improvements in systemic therapies and clinical trial 
enrollment, overall survival rates have changed slowly and incrementally.3
The National Cancer Care Network releases updated guidelines annually for the evaluation 
and management of NSCLC, and standard therapy regimens are based on stage.4 For 
patients with stage I and II disease, local therapy with surgery or radiation is recommended 
depending on medical operability. In contrast, patients with advanced stages (III or IV), are 
recognized to be heterogeneous, and greater latitude is acknowledged regarding treatment 
approaches. As a general rule, however, for stage IIIA and IIIB, chemoradiation is typically 
considered standard management with surgery recommended only in specialized settings. 
For patients with stage IV disease, chemotherapy is typically the recommended treatment, 
with surgery and radiation being utilized in highly selected circumstances.
Yet, despite these guidelines, a substantial proportion of NSCLC patients remain untreated, 
and the number of patients in the United States who undergo no treatment for NSCLC has 
remained fairly constant since the 1990s. Overall, the proportion of untreated NSCLC 
patients varies by stage, ranging from 7 – 45%, but in subsets of older, medically inoperable 
patients, the untreated population can reach as high as 90%.5–11 Significantly, untreated 
patients tend to be older, black, lack insurance and have lower income than patients who 
undergo treatment for NSCLC, underscoring the impact of socio-economic, racial, and other 
disparities in treatment decisions.6 Given the particularly poor survival among untreated 
NSCLC patients (reaching a nadir of approximately 7.2 months in the 1990s),12 we sought 
to characterize the patient and provider factors of untreated NSCLC patients in a hospital-
based cohort. We hypothesized that patients who are older, poorly educated, without health 
insurance and having higher disease stage would have a higher likelihood of being untreated, 
but we also hypothesized that there are a substantial number of untreated patients who are 
statistically similar to patients who undergo treatment.

 Methods
We queried the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for cases of biopsy-proven NSCLC from 
1998 – 2012. The NCDB is a joint program of the Commission on Cancer (CoC) and the 
American Cancer Society (ACS). Data captured in the NCDB represent 1,500 CoC- 
accredited facilities and over 70% of all newly diagnosed cancer cases in the United States 
and are used to track treatments and outcomes as well as provide quality related performance 
measures.13 We abstracted data on key clinical/pathologic characteristics and analyzed the 
factors associated with patients’ untreated status. We used propensity matching to identify 
untreated patients who were not different from patients who underwent standard of care 
therapies.
This study received a determination letter from the University of California, Davis 
Institutional Review Board. Data for patients with primary NSCLC were obtained from the 
NCDB participant user file for patients treated from 1998–2012. Patients with stage I–IV 
NSCLC with histologic data available were included. Patients with an additional cancer 
diagnosis were excluded. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are summarized in Figure 1.
Patient, tumor, and treatment data were extracted and categorized as appropriate. Surgical 
operations included wedge resection, sublobar resection, lobectomy, bilobectomy, and 
pneumonectomy. Patient comorbidities were assessed using the Charlson comorbidity index, 
described by Deyo et al14. Additional categorical variables examined included sex, race, 
income, education, insurance status, year of diagnosis, clinical stage group, clinical node 
status, histology, and treatment facility. Income categories were defined as follows: low <
$38,000; middle >$38,000–47,999, and high >$48,000. Education categories were defined 
by the percent of patients who did not graduate from high school: low ≥13%; middle =7– to 
<13%, and high <7%. Continuous variables included age and tumor size. Continuous 
variables were compared using Kruskal-Wallis tests and categorical variables were 
compared using chi-square tests to determine differences in the treatment groups.
Types of treatment included chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery; chemotherapy and 
surgery; chemoradiation; surgery only; chemotherapy only; radiation only; surgery and 
radiation; unknown; and no treatment. The unknown treatment group included patients with 
missing data for chemotherapy, surgery or radiation; whereas the no treatment group 
included patients who did not have surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. Linear regression 
analysis was used to determine the trend in treatment over the study period, using the 
proportion of patients who received treatment at a certain year as a continuous variable as 
the outcome. Overall survival (OS) functions were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method 
within treatment groups. Log-rank tests were conducted to examine whether the unadjusted 
differences in OS between the treatment groups were statistically significant within each 
stage. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to study the association 
of each of the variables on OS.15 The multivariable logistic regression model was used to 
study the association of each of the variables with being untreated.
Propensity score matching was used to identify 2 similar groups of patients for the stages 
(stage IIIA and IV) where the proportion of untreated patients increased over the study

 period. Propensity score matching of patients with stage IIIA disease who were treated with 
chemoradiation vs no treatment was used to identify 2 comparable groups of patients.16 
Similarly, propensity score matching of patients with stage IV disease who were treated with 
chemotherapy only vs. no treatment was used to identify 2 comparable groups. Patients in 
these analyses were matched for age, gender, race, income, education, clinical tumor size, 
clinical node status, Charlson/Deyo score, and facility type. P-values less than 0.05 were 
considered as statistically significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS for 
Windows, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Cary, NC).
Results
The distribution of treatment group by stage is shown in Figure 2 and eFigure 1. Overall, 
21% (190,539) of patients received no treatment (by stage: I-13.5%, II-15.4%, IIIA – 16.5%, 
IIIB-22.2%, IV – 25.5%). For each stage, treatment groups varied significantly by age, 
Charlson-Deyo score, Sex, Race, Insurance Status, Income, Education, Year of Diagnosis, 
Facility Type, Histology, Tumor Size, and Clinical N Status (data not shown, but available 
upon request). Across all stages, untreated patients were more likely to be older and have 
Medicare insurance rather than private insurance.
When considered as a continuous variable, the proportion of patients in each treatment group 
for each year was used to calculate the trends in changes in treatment patterns. The results 
are shown in Tables e1A–E. For stage I and II, the proportion of untreated patients decreased 
by 0.66% and 0.23% over the 14 year study period (p<0.0001, p= 0.022). For stage IIIA and 
IV, the proportion of untreated patients increased over the study period by 0.21% and 0.4% 
respectively (p= 0.003, <0.0001) (Figure 3). For stage IIIB there was no significant change 
in the proportion of untreated patients.
Factors associated with OS (available in online supplement, eTable 2) and receiving no 
treatment were analyzed and are shown in Table 1. A subset of the cohort with complete data 
was used for these analyses, secondary to missing and unavailable data within the NCDB 
PUF. Type of treatment, age, sex, race, insurance status, income, education, Charlson-Deyo 
score, year of diagnosis, clinical stage, tumor size, clinical nodal status, histology and type 
of treatment facility were all significantly associated with OS (p<0.0001). As expected, 
older age, female sex, non-white race, no insurance, low income, low education, higher 
Charlson-Deyo score, earlier year of diagnosis, higher clinical stage, larger tumor size, 
higher nodal status, were all significantly associated with receiving no treatment.
In the stages of disease where the number of untreated patients increased (stage IIIA and 
IV), propensity score matching was used to identify comparable groups of patients treated 
with standard of care approaches (chemotherapy and radiation for stage IIIA; chemotherapy 
only for stage IV) vs untreated patients. We were able to identify 6,144 matched pairs of 
patients with stage IIIA disease (eTable 3) and 19,046 matched pairs of stage IV patients 
(eTable 4) (data available online). Significant differences in OS were observed between the 
matched pairs. For stage IIIA disease, median OS was 16.5 vs 6.1 months, p <0.0001 
(Figure 4A) and for stage IV median OS, 9.3 vs 2.0 months, p<0.0001 (Figure 4B).

 Discussion
It is unrealistic to expect that all patients with lung cancer will be candidates for and choose 
to undergo treatment for NSCLC, especially in advanced stage NSCLC. However, as novel 
therapies have been introduced which offer improved survival, there have also been 
improvements in supportive care and side effect management which have also improved 
patient tolerance of standard cytotoxic therapies such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and 
even surgery.17 Consequently, a plausible hypothesis would be that the number of untreated 
patients in advance stage NSCLC would decrease over time, as we observed for patients 
with stage I and II disease. However, using the NCDB hospital-based data set, we observed 
the opposite, namely there was significant increase in the prevalence of patients receiving no 
treatment in stage IIIA and IV disease. Among stage IIIA patients tracked in the California 
Cancer Registry, a similar trend was identified for increased numbers of patients being 
untreated between 2004–2012 (0.9%, p<0.001).9 Additionally, among stage IIIA, IIIB and 
IV patients there was a trend of significantly decreased use of multimodality regimens in the 
California Cancer Registry.
By employing a propensity matching analysis, we attempted to assess the number of 
untreated patients who were statistically similar to patients who received standard of care 
treatments as outlined in NCCN guidelines.4 We identified 8,457 untreated stage IIIA 
patients and we were able to match 73% (6,144) to comparable treated patients. Among the 
stage IV patients, we were able to match 55% (19,046) of the untreated cohort to patients 
who underwent chemotherapy. The substantial fraction of matched patients receiving no 
treatment is evidence that other factors besides selection bias are affecting decisions to 
forego treatment in advanced stage NSCLC.
There are many factors that influence the decision not to undergo treatment for NSCLC, 
including patient and disease characteristics, as well as physician factors. Wassener et al 
found that primary care physicians are less likely to refer patients with advanced NSCLC to 
an oncologist than patients with breast cancer.18 Similarly, Goulart et al observed that family 
practice physicians were less likely to refer advanced stage NSCLC patients to medical 
oncologists than general internists.19 Thus, it is possible that physician referral patterns and 
preferences influence treatment patterns and outcomes, as Goulart et al also found that 
practice patterns influenced the delivery of guideline-based therapy. It should also be noted 
that patient factors likely influence physician referral patterns as well, such as rural location 
and insurance status which may not only limit options for care but also raise barriers to 
receiving treatment.
Socioeconomic disparities are strongly linked with differences in treatment and poor 
outcomes for NSCLC. Berglund et al identified a decreased likelihood of treatment with 
chemotherapy for advanced stage NSCLC patients as economic status declined (p<0.01) and 
as age (p<0.01) and comorbidities increased (p<0.01).20 Among the patients in the highest 
quintile of economic status, survival was the longest. Racial differences in rates of surgery 
between black and white patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results 
(SEER) Program have also been identified, and an analysis of SEER data suggests that an 
additional 44 lives could have been saved if surgery had been used equally along racial lines

 for early-stage NSCLC.21 Insurance status also significantly impacts treatment decisions. 
Groth et al found that stage I NSCLC patients with private insurance were more likely to 
undergo treatment with lobectomy than patients with Medicare, Medicaid or no insurance (p 
not specified).22 Similarly, geographic factors have been associated with oncologic 
outcomes. For example, Johnson et al found that rural NSCLC patients in Georgia were 
more likely to have unstaged disease (OR=1.63, 95% CI: 1.45–1.83) and less likely to 
receive radiation (OR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.82–0.96) or chemotherapy (OR=0.92, 95% CI: 0.85–
0.99) than urban patients.23
In our analysis, older patients were also less likely to undergo treatment, and previous 
studies have suggested that this contributes to marked survival disparities. An analysis by 
Nanda et al. using the NCDB evaluated patients over the age of 70 with early stage NSCLC 
and compared outcomes between stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) and no treatment.10 
Despite similar Charlson-Deyo scores, untreated patients had a median survival of 10.1 
months, compared to 29 months following SBRT (p<0.001). This survival benefit to SBRT 
was consistently observed across all age groups, including those patients age 85 and over, 
suggesting that a substantial proportion of older patients may be undertreated.
Nevertheless, it is important to consider our analysis within the context of its strengths and 
limitations. The large sample size in the NCDB allows for identification of patterns of 
treatment, but it does not allow for a granular assessment of individual subsets of patients. 
Despite our attempts to create distinct subsets of patients, it is not possible to fully account 
for the heterogeneity seen within each stage for patients with NSCLC using an 
administrative dataset. Additionally, we are unable to assess the extent of multidisciplinary 
evaluation or the role of a tumor board in treatment decisions using this dataset, which 
would enhance our analysis.
Ultimately, our analysis could be interpreted as yet another manuscript demonstrating a 
selection bias for treated patients. However, it is important to underscore the significant 
numbers of untreated patients who were able to be matched with treated patients in both 
stage IIIA or IV NSCLC. This identifies a potentially notable area for improvement in order 
to develop innovative ways to improve access to care for higher stage NSCLC patients, 
especially those from lower socioeconomic status, lower education, lower income and 
nonprivate insured groups. Future studies will need to investigate additional factors which 
influence treatment decisions for NSCLC patients including: regional treatment variations, 
proximity to treatment, and presence of regional treatment resources; as these may all be 
areas which can be improved with targeted interventions to overcome barriers to treatment.
Conclusion
Substantial numbers of patients remain untreated for NSCLC in the United States, but high 
percentages of these patients are statistically similar to treated patients when compared by 
age, sex, race, income, education, tumor size, nodal status, Charlson-Deyo score, and 
treatment facility type. Physicians should endeavor to ensure that patients from disparate 
populations are evaluated and counseled thoroughly by multidisciplinary teams before 
choosing to forego treatment for NSCLC.
