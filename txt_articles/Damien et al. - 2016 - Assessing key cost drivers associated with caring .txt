Abstract
Background: To examine key factors influencing chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients’ total expenditure and offer
recommendations on how to reduce total cost of CKD care without compromising quality.
Methods: Using the 2002–2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data, our cross-sectional study analyzed 197
patient records—79 patients with one record and 59 with two entries per patient (138 unique patients). We used three
patient groups, based on international statistical classification of diseases version 9 code for condition (ICD9CODX)
classification, to focus inference from the analysis: (a) non-dialysis dependent CKD, (b) dialysis and (c) transplant.
Covariate information included region, demographic, co-morbid conditions and types of services. We used descriptive
methods and multivariate generalized linear models to understand the impact of cost drivers. We compared actual and
predicted CKD cost of care data using a hold-out sample of nine, randomly selected patients to validate the models.
Results: Total costs were significantly affected by treatment type, with dialysis being significantly higher than non-dialysis
and transplant groups. Costs were highest in the West region of the U.S. Average costs for patients with public insurance
were significantly higher than patients with private insurance (p < .0743), and likewise, for patients with co-morbid
conditions over those without co-morbid conditions (p < .001).
Conclusions: Managing CKD patients both before and after the onset of dialysis treatment and managing co-morbid
conditions in individuals with CKD are potential sources of substantial cost savings in the care of CKD patients. Comparing
total costs pre and post the United States Affordable Care Act could provide invaluable insights into managing the
cost-quality tradeoff in CKD care.
Keywords: Chronic kidney disease, Total costs drivers, Co-morbid conditions
Background
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects approximately 10% of
the population worldwide, and millions die each year be-
cause they do not have access to affordable treatment [1].
The global costs of CKD quadrupled in the 20 years leading
up to 2001 [2] and are expected to continue to increase
due to world population growth and aging [3–5]. Accord-
ing the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study, CKD was
ranked 27th in the list of causes of total number of deaths
worldwide in 1990, and rose to 18th in 2010 [6]. Over 80%
of patients who receive treatment for kidney failure live in
affluent countries with universal access to health care and
large elderly populations [6]. Patients with CKD incur 85%
higher costs and 50% higher government subsidies than
those without CKD, and costs of care increase by CKD
stage [7]. In the United States, treatment of CKD is esti-
mated at $48 billion per year, consuming 6.7% of the total
Medicare budget to care for less than 1% of the covered
population; and China’s economy is estimated to lose $558
billion over the next decade due to morbidity and mortality
attributable to heart disease and kidney disease [1]. Under-
standing the key cost drivers associated with caring for indi-
viduals with CKD could suggest new strategies to bend the
cost curve of this complex and debilitating condition.
The severity of CKD is classified into five stages with stage
1 constituting the mildest disease state where few clear
symptoms are present, and stage 5 constituting severe illness
with poor life expectancy if left untreated. Individuals with
stage 5 CKD typically require one of two types of renal
replacement therapy, namely dialysis or transplant. These
individuals are further classified as having End-Stage Renal

 Disease (ESRD). Individuals diagnosed with CKD stages
1 to 4 and do not require life-supporting treatments for
renal failure are labeled Non-Dialysis Dependent CKD
(NDD-CKD). At times, even stage 5 patients that have
not yet started renal replacement therapy are grouped
under NDD-CKD.
Managing the tradeoff between costs and quality in
health care in general is a tremendous challenge [8–12].
Managing the cost/quality tradeoff in patients with CKD
presents a unique set of challenges [13, 14], including an
increased burden of CKD patients in the world population
and the rising expenses associated with it. In 2011, the
Fresenius Medical Care worldwide network, estimated
that roughly 2.8 million patients globally were being
treated for ESRD with a 6–7% growth annually. Of these,
approximately 2.1 million were undergoing hemodialysis
or peritoneal dialysis, and around 622,000 were living with
kidney transplants. The prevalence of treated ESRD pa-
tients in the general population shows high global vari-
ation, ranging from under 100 to over 2,000 patients per
million populations (pmp). ESRD prevalence is highest in
Taiwan with around 2,850 pmp, closely followed by Japan
with around 2,490 pmp and the US with around 1,970
pmp. Of the CKD cases in the US, about 65% were identi-
fied as undergoing dialysis and 30% were identified as liv-
ing with kidney transplants.
In 2011, Medicare spending in the U.S. per patient, per
year, by renal replacement therapy type was: hemodialysis -
$87,945; peritoneal dialysis - $71,630; and transplant -
$32,922. To curb rapid spending growth in dialysis costs in
the Medicare patient population, CMS implemented pro-
spective bundled payments and pay-for-performance incen-
tives. It is unclear whether these strategies will reduce the
total cost of dialysis or their effect on quality of care [15].
Additional research is needed to better understand the
costs associated with caring for individuals with CKD [16].
A key step in devising cost-efficient strategies for provid-
ing high quality care for patients with CKD is identifying the
major drivers of cost and their attendant implications for
cost of services for each patient. The primary objective of
this study is to evaluate the total health care cost for patients
with CKD by identifying the drivers of total cost for these
patients. Once such factors are determined, the study quan-
tifies, where possible, the reduction in costs per CKD patient
associated with these factors. Such inferences could help
policy, practice and research stakeholders develop more
effective protocols to better manage the cost of caring for
patients with CKD without compromising quality. To better
focus the inferences drawn from these analyses, we consider
three patient groups based on the above classifications: (a)
NDD-CKD; (b) Dialysis; and (c) Transplant patients. These
are the most commonly defined and used patient groups in
the context of worldwide treatment of CKD patients, and
hence they form the basis for this research.
Methods
Study design
This was a cross-sectional study of CKD adults using a na-
tionally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
(MEPS) from 2002 to 2011. MEPS is co-sponsored by the
Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and
the National Center for Health Statistics. The MEPS
survey, initiated in 1996, has collected data annually that
can be utilized to provide nationally representative esti-
mates of the intensity, frequency, and the cost of health-
care services that Americans use and how these services
are covered and paid for by different insurance providers.
MEPS data can be accessed through the website adminis-
tered by AHRQ at www.meps.ahrq.gov. Data from chil-
dren were not included in our analysis.
Study data
We started out with an analysis of 211 patients whose data
were collected over a 10-year period and ensured there
were sufficient number of patients in each year, and that
no one year represented less than 6% or more than 13% of
the sample. Data were also balanced for the region of the
country,
gender,
marital
status,
ethnicity,
education,
patient health status, hospital visits and costs. Duplicate
records were then deleted bringing down the number of
records to 197. Thus, after carefully eliminating a multi-
tude of recording errors, there were 197 patient re-
cords—79 patients with one record and 59 with two
entries per patient for a total of 138 patients. To be sure,
what we have is a patient level analysis, but since some
patients have multiple cost records, we have a repeated
measures dataset; hence, at times, we use the phrase
‘patient record’. These patients were segmented into
Dialysis, Transplant and Non-Dialysis Dependent CKD
(NDD-CKD) treatment groups based on ICD9CODX
classification – International Classification of Disease, 9th
Revision. Recall that those undergoing the former two
treatment types are also described as ESRD patients.
The response or dependent variable of interest in this
study is the Total Expenditure (or Total Costs) incurred by
each CKD patient each year, which is the sum of the follow-
ing expenses: Emergency, Inpatient, Outpatient, Office visits,
Medical equipment/supply, Prescription drug, and Other
home healthcare. In the time frame considered, it should be
noted that almost half of the patients had only one record of
Total Costs while the remainder had two. The database did
not contain any information as to when patients died.
Typically, health care costs (both charges and payments)
are collected for all persons for each medical event they
experience in the year, including the amount from each
payment source. Charges are the dollar amounts asked
("charge") for a service by a health care provider. This is
often different from the actual payments made to providers.
Expenditure estimates are based on payments, not charges.

 More specifically, expenditures in MEPS are comprised of
direct payments for care provided during the year, including
out-of-pocket payments and payments by private insurance,
Medicaid, Medicare, and other sources. All payments were
inflation adjusted to target year using the annual PPI
Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Bringing in
normative external data introduces additional variation
which we sought to avoid.
MEPS also includes covariate information on household
income, medical conditions and clinical classification codes.
Data on demographic and socioeconomic variables, such as
gender, age, race, family income, region, insurance coverage
are available for respondents and families residing in the
U.S. To understand how to better minimize total costs, it is
important to examine the influence of covariates on costs.
To this end, based on targeted discussions with health care
providers and CKD specialists, we categorized these covari-
ates into five major groups.
1. REGION: Northeast, South, Midwest, and West in
the United States
2. TREATMENT TYPE: Dialysis, Transplant, and
NDD-CKD
3. DEMOGRAPHIC data on each patient: gender, race,
age, family income, source of care provider, and
health insurance coverage. Gender, age, and health
insurance coverage feature only in the descriptive
analysis, since they did not correlate to expenditure.
Furthermore, since the number of non-whites and
non-blacks in the final sample were very few,
without loss of generality, we grouped ‘whites’ and
‘other non-blacks’ into the reference group. From a
multivariate analysis perspective, the inferences and
conclusions would be identical if we had grouped
‘blacks’ and ‘other non-whites’ as the reference
group. The only changes would be in the magnitudes
and signs of the intercepts and slope parameters.
4. CO-MORBID conditions for each patient: diabetes,
high blood pressure, other heart disease
5. TYPE OF SERVICES used by a patient: Costs
associated with office-based visits; outpatient visits;
hospital discharges; nights in hospitals; and
prescription medications were the most
predominant in the list of costs for each patient,
and hence these factored into the multivariate
analysis.
Details on certain key variables from the above list used
in the study are provided below:
(A)Insurance Coverage: Individuals were classified into
the following three insurance categories based on
household responses to the health insurance status
questions.
Any private health insurance: Individuals who, at
any time during the year, had insurance that
provided coverage for hospital and physician care
(other than Medicare, Medicaid, or other public
hospital/physician coverage) were classified as
having private insurance. Coverage by TRICARE
(Armed Forces-related coverage) was also included
as private health insurance. Insurance that pro-
vided coverage for a single service only, such as
dental or vision coverage, was not included.
Public coverage only: Individuals were considered
to have public coverage only if they met both of
the following criteria: 1) they were not covered by
private insurance at any time during the year, and
2) they were covered by one of the following
public programs at some point during the year:
Medicare, Medicaid, or other public hospital/
physician coverage.
Uninsured: Individuals were considered uninsured
if they were not covered by private hospital/
physician insurance, Medicare, TRICARE,
Medicaid, or other public hospital/physician
programs at any time during the entire year or
their period of eligibility for the survey. There
were only two uninsured patients in this study.
Without loss of generality, therefore, we pooled
them with those in the public insurance group.
(B) Office-based visit costs included expenses for visits
to both physician and non-physician medical
providers seen in office settings.
Hospital inpatients costs included room and board
and all hospital diagnostic and laboratory expenses
associated with the basic facility charge, payments
for separately billed physician inpatient services,
and some emergency care expenses incurred
immediately prior to inpatient stays.
Hospital outpatient costs included expenses for
visits to both physicians and other medical
providers seen in hospital outpatient departments,
including payments for services covered under the
basic facility charge and those for separately billed
physician services.
Emergency care costs included payments for
services covered under the basic facility charge and
those for separately billed physician services, but
excluded expenses for emergency room services
that were included in a hospital inpatient admission.
Prescribed medicines costs included expenses for all
prescribed medications that were initially
purchased or refilled during the year, as well as
expenses for diabetic supplies.
Ambulatory costs combined office-based, hospital
outpatient, and emergency room expense
categories described above.
Damien et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2016) 16:690 
Page 3 of 10
 Home health costs include expenses for home care
provided by agencies and independent providers.
Other costs include expenses for care in all
categories not specified as a separate category
including those for miscellaneous medical
equipment and supplies.
To complete the data discussion, we now focus on the
type of variables (categorical vs. continuous) under Groups
2 through 5 above to be used in the multivariate analysis.
Many of the variables under Groups 2 through 5 are cat-
egorical. To include these in the multivariate analysis,
dummy (or 0–1 binary) variables were created.
Group 2 categorical variables: NDD-CKD was used as
the reference group to be used as the basis of compari-
son with Dialysis and Transplant patients.
Group 3 categorical variables: Non-black was the refer-
ence group for race. Low income patients (annual family
income of less than $45000) were treated as the reference
group versus high income patients.
Group 4 variables: For all the covariates in this collec-
tion, the reference groups, coded 0, corresponded to absence
of the clinical conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure and
other heart conditions.
Group 5 variables: None were categorical.
In the multivariate analyses, Models 1 through 4 corres-
pond, respectively, to the covariate analyses resulting from
the variables detailed above under Groups 2 through 5.
Statistical analyses
Consider Panel a in Fig. 1 that depicts the unimodal histo-
gram of the Total Cost data used in this study where these
data range from $294 to $335,000. Since a few patients tend
to have much higher costs than the rest, the histogram is
skewed right. This suggests that a natural log transformation
of the data would be appropriate to ensure approximate
normality [17]. Panel b in Fig. 1 shows the Total Cost data
post log transformation. Throughout, we work with these
log-transformed Total Cost data as the dependent variable
(Y) in the four log-linear models described later. In these
models, Region and Health Insurance Coverage were
omitted since they were best addressed by descriptive ana-
lysis, as shown later in the paper. Additionally, we found
that, as covariates, these two variables do not correlate with
total expenditure data.
Model validation
The multivariate log-linear models are further used to predict
or forecast the total expenditures for a hold-out sample of
nine, randomly selected patients. In addition to illustrating
the feasibility and robustness of the methodology, such ex
ante inferences could prove useful to patients and providers
to better plan ahead.
Results
The results are classified into descriptive and multivariate
where the latter are based on the log-linear statistical
models. The descriptive results complement the inferences
from the model-based analysis. Where appropriate, pairwise
t-tests were carried out to check for statistical significance of
the descriptive results and, in the following, these are indi-
cated via p-values.
Descriptive results
Exploratory inferences from the data for each of the five
groups detailed earlier are first described since they
often provide useful insights, and also serve as prelimin-
ary analytic steps to help build multivariate models.

 Region
Out of 197 patient records, 46% were from South, 23%
from West, 22% from Midwest and 9% from Northeast.
Total patient cost is found to be highest and statistically
significant in the West ($39,905) and least in the South
($30,239) with p-value < .05. In percent terms, compared to
the West, cost of treatment in the: South is 28% lower;
North-East is 20% lower; Midwest is 12% lower. To control
for the known Medicare allowable increase in payments to
different regional markets and to avoid the subsequent bias
in unadjusted dollar figures, all payments were inflation
adjusted to target year using annual Cost of Living for the
specific region from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Treatment type
Of the 197 records, 43% corresponded to Dialysis patient
visits and 22% were Transplant patient visits. Dialysis patients
experienced
significantly
higher
(p-value < .001)
average
expenditures ($48,225) compared to NDD-CKD ($27,862) or
Transplant ($16,190) patients.
Demographic
Men accounted for 62% while women accounted for 38% of
the costs. In terms of race, Black patients topped the list
with 41% of costs. 98% of costs were incurred by patients
that have source of care providers while 2% had no
providers. Finally, patients with public insurance had sig-
nificantly higher costs than those with private insurance
(p < .0743). The key reason for this result stems from the
fact that the cost of office-based visits for the former
group of patients was, on the average, $8239 more than
the latter group. Other researchers have seen mixed
results in this regard since insurance related conclusions
could vary from country to country.
Co-morbid conditions
Hypertension, Diabetes and Heart-Related conditions were
the most common co-morbid conditions associated with
CKD patients. About 90% have high BP, 44% suffer from
Diabetes and 61% have heart related disease. Average ex-
penditure for patients with co-morbid conditions ($95,749)
was significantly higher (p-value < .001) than those without
co-morbid conditions ($36,360).
Types of services
Some conclusions regarding the top three service related
expenditures are the following. Rank ordering the average
costs for the three treatment groups from highest to lowest,
we found:
� Office-based visits, in-patient, and out-patient services
contribute most to costs incurred by Dialysis patients.
� For NDD-CKD patients, the rank order is office-
based visits, prescription, and outpatient costs.
� For Transplant patients, the top three costs in
decreasing order are prescription, office-based visits,
and outpatient.
Multivariate models and results
Recall that “Y” refers to the natural logarithm of Total
Costs. Figure 1 depicts the unimodal histogram of the
Total Cost data used in this study where these data
range from $294 to $335,000. Since a few patients tend
to have much higher costs than the rest, the histogram is
skewed right. Hence, to enable robust statistical analyses,
a natural log transformation of the data to ensure ap-
proximate normality is required Fox [12]. In all the
analyses discussed in the paper, we worked with these log-
transformed Total Cost data as the dependent variable (Y)
in the four models given below. This means the regression
coefficients would have to be expressed as percent
changes in the untransformed dependent variable (Total
Costs); see Fox [17] for details. Note that collapsing all the
four models into one would be statistically unsound since
the sample size would have to be increased substantially
in order to keep the ratio of number of independent
variables to sample size large enough to obtain adequate
statistical accuracy and power; see, Fox [17] for a discus-
sion on sample size requirements in regression analysis.
The entire analysis was carried out in SAS.

Model 1: Y versus Treatment Type
Consider Table 1. Compared to NDD-CKD patients we
found that the Total Cost of treating transplant patients is
44% lower (p < .0267). Also, Total Cost of treating dialysis
patients is 53% higher (p < .0017) than NDD-CKD patients.
Model 2: Y versus Demographic Factors
Again, consider Table 1. Cost of treating CKD is 47% higher
for black patients than non-black patients (p < .0062). Fur-
thermore, compared to high income patients, low income
patients’ costs are 34% higher (p < .0570).
Model 3: Y versus Co-morbid Conditions
Now, consider Table 2. Cost of treating CKD patients with
high blood pressure is 44% higher when compared to
patients with normal blood pressure. Diabetic CKD patients
incur 39% more in costs than non-diabetic CKD patients. A
final inference for Co-morbid Conditions is that compared
to CKD patients without heart disease, costs for those with
heart disease are 49% higher.
Model 4: Y versus Types of Services
From Table 2, we have the following marginal effects:
� For every additional in-patient visit in the year,
patient expenses rises by 13%
� For every additional outpatient visit in the year,
patient expenses rises by 1%
� For every additional office-based visit in the year,
patient expenses rises by 1%
� For every additional hospital night stay in the year,
patient expenses rises by 0.8%
� For every additional prescription medicine in the
year, patient expenses rises by 0.4%
Out-of-sample forecasting results
Since practitioners and patients would be well-served to
know what expenditures are likely to be, it is useful to
examine how well the statistical models are able to pre-
dict or forecast expenditures for a given patient. To ac-
complish this task, we set aside the actual costs incurred
by nine randomly selected patients of which there were
six CKD patients, two Dialysis patients and 1 NDD-CKD
patient. Using the estimated regression models given
above, we predicted the total costs for each patient
under each of the four models, and the corresponding
95% prediction interval for these nine point forecasts.
Recalling that the dependent variable is the natural
logarithm of Total Costs, consider Fig. 2 below, where the
vertical axis is the natural log of Total Costs, and the
horizontal axis is the patient ID number. The top left and
right panels correspond to the predictions from Model 1
and Model 2, respectively, while the bottom left and right
panels correspond to the predictions from Model 3 and
Model 4, respectively. In each panel, the outer most curves
are the 95% prediction limits for the Total Costs, and the
red and green lines correspond to the actual and predicted
costs for each of the nine patients, respectively. The models
generally tend to underestimate expenditures for three
patients, while for the rest the predicted values track the ac-
tual expenditures somewhat closely. These patients’ costs
were among those extreme expenditure values in the sample
that resulted in the histogram of total costs to be skewed
right, thereby requiring a natural logarithm transformation
of the dependent variable. Overall, the four models perform
satisfactorily using a predictive criterion.

 Discussion
Our findings suggest that CKD patient costs are signifi-
cantly affected by treatment type, namely dialysis, trans-
plant, and non-dialysis dependent CKD; costs differed by
region (highest in the West region of the U.S.); and average
expenditure for patients with co-morbid conditions is sig-
nificantly higher than those without co-morbid conditions.
Also, patients with public insurance incurred higher costs
than those with private insurance, a finding that adds to the
mixed results in the literature on cost variation between
publically and privately insured individuals [18, 19]. The
finding that costs are different by geographic region is con-
sistent with the body of knowledge on geographic variation
in care [20–22], and that topic has been well researched.
Targeting decision-making units rather than geographic
units has been recently discussed in the literature as a way
to reduce variation and total cost in health care spending
[23]. Because most medical decisions are made by individ-
uals or small groups of individuals rather than by geo-
graphic units, findings ways to improve care coordination
across medical specialties and use real-time data sharing to
support communication and group decision making among
multiple providers seems important for improving cost
effective care for patients with CKD. The following discus-
sion mainly focuses on the treatment of CKD patients on
dialysis and on managing CKD patients with co-morbid
conditions because of the relatively higher costs these
patients incur.
Given that the total cost of patients on dialysis is signifi-
cantly higher in comparison to NDD-CKD and transplant
patients, CKD specialists and policy and decision-makers
should focus attention on managing the expenditures of
dialysis patients. It is not surprising that once technology
(i.e. a dialysis machine) is introduced in caring for the sick-
est patients or the most severe of cases, health care costs
escalate. In some conditions, where patient costs dramatic-
ally escalate, investment in technology and expenditures on
invasive procedures for the “sickest of the sick”, it could be
argued, does pay off [24]. An example of this is the use of
Biventricular heart assist devices (BiVad) in the congestive
heart failure population. For patients with the most severe
illness, the BiVad offers a decrease in hospitalization rates,
but at considerable upfront costs. In contrast, if one con-
siders CKD and dialysis, there has only been a small incre-
mental improvement in the mortality rate of dialysis
patients. The prevalence of End Stage Renal Disease is
about seven percent per annum and the longevity of the
average dialysis patient is five years. These numbers are
actually quite interesting, if one considers the CKD/dialysis
mortality rate that amounts to a 20% drop off each year,

 which is worse than most forms of cancer and many other
chronic diseases.
The prevalence of stage 5 CKD is increasing and costs
are escalating with the steepest portion of the costs for a
dialysis patient being incurred during the first 180 days of
dialysis treatment. This suggests that one potentially
impactful strategy for decreasing these costs is to ensure
patients are dialysis-ready well in advance of actually start-
ing a patient on dialysis. Likewise, starting prospective
dialysis patients on an outpatient dialysis schedule (where
costs are lower), or making use of urgent-start peritoneal
dialysis programs [25], and avoiding traumatic scenarios,
whereby dialysis patients require emergency care and con-
sequently incur a minimum five-day hospital stay, could
significantly lower total costs for patients with CKD.
Some efforts to reduce the costs associated with caring
for patients with CKD are already underway. The Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ESRD Seamless
Care Organization is the first disease specific Accountable
Care Organization designed by CMS to identify, test, and
evaluate new ways to improve care for Medicare beneficiar-
ies with ESRD. Likewise, the Large Dialysis Organizations
are developing strategies to reduce costs incurred by CKD
patients by identifying "high spenders". These include
reaching out to such patients to remind them of their dialy-
sis appointments and helping them with other disease
related activities, such as managing their medications, diet,
and transportation needs to and from appointments.
Additionally,
some
dialysis
providers
are
developing
methods to mine their databases to identify “high spenders"
and build economic models to determine what CKD care is
best. Future research should examine the efficacy of these
efforts and investigate how to best scale up successful as-
pects of these efforts.
We found that total costs for patients with CKD are sig-
nificantly affected by co-morbid conditions (such as
hypertension, diabetes, and other heart disease) and their
associated costs. Cardiovasular disease and diabetes melli-
tus are the two leading causes of CKD. Better manage-
ment of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, common co-
morbidities associated with CKD, would slow the progres-
sion of kidney disease and reduce healthcare expenditures.
Awareness of potential side effects due to the medications
or renal insufficiency could prevent unnecessary harm to
patients and provide cost-containment. Active involve-
ment of all healthcare team members can reduce progres-
sion of CKD and improve quality of life outcomes in CKD
patients. Moreover, while it is not surprising that more
medically complex CKD patients incur higher costs, it re-
inforces the importance of delivering coordinated patient-
centered care that is attentive to the whole person includ-
ing the management of polypharmacy, the use of multiple
medications and/or the administration of more medica-
tions than are clinically indicated. Polypharmacy continues
to increase in the U.S. and is a known risk factor for mor-
bidity and mortality. Additionally, treatment plans for
CKD patients that activate and educate patients, family
members and other care providers to better manage co-
morbid conditions and adhere to targets established by
physicians should be at the forefront of cost reduction
strategies for treating individuals with CKD.
Our findings suggest that reducing the number of in-
person visits and the number of prescription drugs might
also reduce total costs per CKD patient. Reducing the fre-
quency of in-person visits could be accomplished by using
computer technologies, such as secure messaging (email)
or telehealth systems, for non-essential office visits. Many
medical systems are already using secure messaging sys-
tems to share the results from routine medical tests with
patients [26, 27]. Reducing costs associated with prescrip-
tion drugs is perhaps more difficult to address. One path
to lowering the number of prescription medications used
in the CKD population could come from better manage-
ment of co-morbid conditions, as noted above. Another
way could be through better efforts to more systematically
address polypharmacy in this patient population. Predict-
ing which CKD patients will end up on dialysis is very
difficult. Often, patients at stage 3 or stage 4 will never
receive dialysis. For every five to seven CKD patients seen,
only one will end up on dialysis. The others will either not
progress and/or die (usually of cardiovascular disease).
Efforts might be best spent focusing on the cardiovascular
health of the CKD patient population with less costly
solutions (e.g. statins, blood pressure control, nutrition
and exercise counseling) as a way to reduce long-term
costs associated with co-morbid conditions.
Our findings also suggest that better care and reduced
total costs for caring for patients with CKD could come
from applying approaches to care that are grounded in
systems thinking [28]. The majority of the frameworks
applied
to
understand
health
care
delivery
systems
emphasize the linear relationships among system compo-
nents, where all variables and their relative weights are
known [29]. Acknowledging the presence of nonlinear re-
lationships and unpredictability in CKD treatment could
help the individuals and organizations more accurately
conceptualize the impact of various components of CKD
care. Along these lines, models of care such as Patient-
Centered Medical Homes, Accountable Care Organiza-
tions and Home-Based Primary Care are a step in the
right direction for achieving a more integrated and holistic
view of the complex needs shared by high-cost, high need
patients with chronic disease. Such a reconceptualization
of CKD processes and care trajectories could provide
decision makers and policy makers with new insights into
observed gaps in care and for visualizing novel paths for-
ward for implementing CKD treatments and interventions
more effectively.

 Limitations and future research
The above analyses and conclusions are relevant steps to-
ward understanding and minimizing cost of care for CKD
patients. However, there are enhancements not addressed
in this paper that may be worthy of further research.
First, the models could be adapted to account for various
co-morbid combinations (or interactions) and their subse-
quent impact on costs. For instance, high blood pressure
and obesity are two variables that could jointly influence the
type of treatment to which a patient is subjected, which in
turn would have a differing impact on costs. Introducing
interaction variables, however, would require a much larger
dataset since one would have to include more independent
variables. Second, it would be interesting to develop a time-
series model for total costs that would allow one to project
expenditures at least two or three years into the future. Kid-
ney disease is progressive as are its attendant costs. Thus,
patients would be better informed if at least some costs were
predicted ahead of time. Such long-term prediction models,
while useful, are non-trivial to develop since, when viewed
as a time series, expenditure data are highly non-stationary.
Third, assessing percentage changes to total costs by chan-
ging existing protocols is worthy of study. For instance, sup-
pose the source-of-care provider days were increased by 5%.
How would that increase impact the total cost to patients by
different treatment types? This type of sensitivity analysis
could help providers evaluate the tradeoffs between cost and
quality of care decisions. Fourth, our results suggest that
costs of treating CKD patients are lower for those with
private as opposed to public insurance. Research assessing
this relationship perhaps comparing costs pre and post the
recent U.S. Affordable Care Act is needed. Fifth, in this
paper we wanted to understand CKD costs before the roll-
out of the ACA whose impact on CKD patient behavior and
treatment started to alter in 2013. Given the dynamics of
the current election cycle, this wait-and-see approach is bet-
ter justified. Also, we wanted a clean, comprehensive data
that reflected some important considerations such as: use of
Erythropoietin stimulating agents (which was at its peak in
2006); growing momentum for payment policy reform in
certain states; and moving toward bundled payments. Some
of these criteria were corrupted in data starting roughly
around 2012–2013. Nonetheless, it would be useful to revisit
certain aspects of this research using new data. Sixth, it
would be useful to investigate the CKD cost data across
different countries, given the different health care plan
choices available in different nations. Perhaps, one could
adapt the U.S. model for CKD costs by borrowing strength
from the analysis of such data from other countries: a meta-
analysis study may be appropriate to address this research
issue. Finally, insights from this study could be used to
inform future research to understand and manage the cost-
quality tradeoff for other complex and debilitating chronic
conditions such as epilepsy, asthma, and heart disease.
Conclusions
Managing CKD patients both before and after the onset of
dialysis treatment and managing co-morbid conditions in
individuals with CKD are potential sources of substantial
cost savings in the care of CKD patients. Future research
comparing total costs pre and post the U.S. Affordable
Care Act could provide invaluable insights into managing
the cost-quality tradeoff in CKD care.
