Abstract
Background: Antidepressant use has been associated with an increased risk of falling, but no studies have been
conducted on whether antidepressant use is associated with an increased risk of head injuries which often result
from falling among older persons. The objective of this study was to investigate the risk of head and brain injuries
associated with antidepressant use among community-dwelling persons with Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods: A matched cohort study was conducted by comparing new antidepressant users (n = 10,910) with two
matched nonusers (n = 21,820) in the MEDALZ study cohort. The MEDALZ cohort includes all community-dwelling
persons newly diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease between 2005 and 2011 in Finland. Incident antidepressant users
were identified based on register-based dispensing data from the Prescription register with a 1-year washout period
for antidepressant use. Nonusers were matched with users based on age, gender, and time since Alzheimer’s
disease diagnosis. The outcome events were defined as any head injuries and traumatic brain injuries based on
diagnoses in Hospital Discharge and Causes of Death registers. Propensity score adjusted Cox proportional hazard
models were utilized. Sensitivity analyses with case-crossover design were conducted. All registers are linkable with
unique personal identification numbers assigned for each resident.
Results: Antidepressant use was associated with an increased risk of head injuries (age-adjusted event rate per 100
person-years 2.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.49–3.06) during use and 2.43 (95% CI 2.06–2.35) during nonuse,
adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.35, 95% CI 1.20–1.52) and traumatic brain injuries (age-adjusted event rate per 100
person-years 1.33 (95% CI 1.13–1.53) during use and 1.10 (95% CI 1.00–1.20) during nonuse, adjusted HR 1.26, 95%
CI 1.06–1.50). The risk was highest during the first 30 days of use (HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.10–2.66 for head injuries; HR 2.
06, 95% CI 1.12–3.82 for traumatic brain injuries) and remained at an elevated level for head injuries for over 2 years
of use. In case-crossover analyses, antidepressant use was consistently associated with a higher risk of head injuries.

Conclusions: Antidepressant use was associated with an increased risk of the most severe outcomes, head and
brain injuries, in persons with Alzheimer’s disease. Antidepressant use should be carefully considered and the
association confirmed in future studies.

Background
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of de-
mentia, is a major public health challenge due to popula-
tion aging [1]. Age is the most important risk factor for
AD. As AD leads to dependency on other people it is as-
sociated with significant health care and societal costs.
For these reasons, optimal care of this vulnerable patient
group is a key challenge for the future.
Antidepressant use is frequent among older persons and
especially among persons with AD or other dementia [2–
4]. In a Finnish AD cohort, prevalence of antidepressant
use was 3.5-times more frequent among persons with AD
than among persons without AD [4]. In addition, the inci-
dence of antidepressant use peaks after the AD diagnosis,
suggesting that antidepressants are frequently initiated for
various symptoms among persons with AD [5]. Antipsy-
chotics have been traditionally used for treatment of be-
havioral
and
psychological
symptoms
of
dementia
(BPSD), but their use has been associated with an in-
creased risk of cerebrovascular adverse events and
mortality [6]. Consequently, recent studies report decreas-
ing use of antipsychotics together with increasing use of
antidepressants [2, 7]. Due to more frequent use of antide-
pressants and changes associated with both aging and the
AD disease process, investigating adverse drug events
(ADE) associated with antidepressant use is crucially
important in this population.
Among older persons, antidepressant use has been fre-
quently associated with an increased risk of falls [8, 9],
injurious falls like fractures [9], and hip fractures [10]. In
addition, the risk for head and brain injuries increases
with aging [11]. Among older persons, falls are the main
causal factor for traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), whereas
younger persons experience TBIs as a result of motor
vehicle, sports, and other accidents [12]. Older persons
(aged ≥65 years) are about two-times as likely to experi-
ence a TBI compared with younger persons [13]. Thus,
fall-related head and brain injuries are a significant health
problem among older persons. However, we found no stud-
ies investigating the risk of head or brain injuries associated
with antidepressant use. One previous study assessed risk
factors for TBIs during falls among older persons, but
medication use was assessed only 4 h before the fall and
the number of users was small [14].
The objective of our study was to investigate whether
antidepressant use is associated with risk of head and
brain injuries among community-dwelling persons with
AD. We also studied the risk in terms of duration of use
and compared the risk between selective serotonin re-
uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants.
Methods
Cohort
The MEDALZ (Medication use and Alzheimer’s disease)
cohort consists of all 70,718 community-dwelling per-
sons diagnosed with AD between 2005 and 2011 in
Finland. These persons were identified from the Special
Reimbursement register [3, 15]. Current care guidelines
in Finland recommend that all persons with clinically
verified Alzheimer’s disease should be prescribed anti-
dementia drugs if there is no contraindication for use
[16]. The diagnostic process was conducted according to
a predefined protocol which includes computed tomog-
raphy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan accord-
ing to the NINCDS-ADRDA [17] and DSM-IV criteria. A
certificate of the fulfillment of the diagnostic criteria must
be confirmed by a geriatrician or neurologist and sent for
evaluation to the Social Insurance Institution of Finland
which grants special reimbursement if the criteria are
fulfilled.
Registers
Data for the cohort have been collected from several
nationwide registers including the Prescription register
(years 1995–2012), the Special Reimbursement register
(1972–2012), the Hospital Discharge register (1972–2012),
and socioeconomic data since 1970 and causes of death
2005–2012 from Statistics Finland. All registers are link-
able with unique personal identification numbers assigned
for each resident. The Prescription register includes in-
formation on purchases of reimbursed drugs classified
according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)
classification system [18]. The purchased amount is re-
corded in the register as Defined Daily Dose (DDD), which
is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a
drug used for its main indication in adults. Drug use data
are restricted to community-dwelling persons since drugs
used during stays in hospitals and public nursing homes
are not recorded in the register. The Special Reimburse-
ment register includes records of persons entitled for
higher reimbursement of drugs due to chronic diseases.

 The Hospital Discharge register includes inpatient stays in
hospitals with corresponding discharge diagnoses.
Exposure
Antidepressants were defined according to ATC class
N06A. SSRIs were defined as N06AB (fluoxetine, citalo-
pram, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, and escitalopram
on the market in Finland). Other antidepressants (N06A
excluding SSRIs N06AB) were grouped together. When
drug use started and ended, i.e., drug use periods, were
modeled with a previously utilized method, PRE2DUP [19].
The modeling is based on sliding averages of daily dose (in
DDDs) and modeling separately each ATC code for each
person according to purchase regularity taking into account
hospitalizations, stockpiling of drugs, and changing dose.
After modeling all antidepressant drugs separately, overlap-
ping drug use periods of any antidepressant use were com-
bined to retrieve continuous duration of any antidepressant
use. For drug class analyses, SSRI-use periods were formed
by combining drug use periods of SSRI drug substances
together, and similarly for other antidepressants.
Outcome
Diagnoses of head injuries and TBIs were collected from
the Hospital Discharge register and Causes of Death
register data. Thus, our study outcome represents head
injuries and TBIs both treated in hospital and as a direct
or underlying cause of death. Based on ICD-10 codes,
head trauma was defined as S0* (injuries to the head),
and TBIs were defined as S06 (intracranial injury). For
each person, we considered only the first recorded out-
come event (with the most specific diagnosis recorded
in that period). Diagnoses of head and brain injuries be-
fore the AD diagnosis (with corresponding ICD-8 and -9
codes) were used for exclusion of persons with previous
injury, and new diagnoses after AD were considered as
the outcome of interest.
Study setting
Exclusion criteria for this study were prevalent anti-
depressant use and long hospitalization during a 1-year
washout period before AD diagnosis (Fig. 1). Persons
using antidepressants, or who were hospitalized for >50%
of the washout period or were hospitalized/institutional-
ized for >90 days at the end of the washout period, were
excluded from all analyses. Exclusions due to long-term
hospitalizations during the washout period were conducted
because drug use during hospitalizations is not recorded in
the Prescription register. Persons with previous head injury
since 1972 until the AD diagnosis were excluded from all
analyses. Furthermore, persons hospitalized/institutional-
ized for the entire follow-up period were excluded as the
follow-up time for them never started.
After these exclusions, we constructed a matched cohort
by selecting two nonusers as comparison persons for each
person who started antidepressant use. The same exclusion
criteria were applied for nonusers. At the start date of anti-
depressant use, two nonusers were matched for each user
based on age (±2 years), gender, and time since AD diagno-
sis (variation allowed at maximum ±90 days), resulting in
10,910 antidepressant users and 21,820 matched nonusers.
The purpose of this matching was to ensure that nonusers
are similar to users especially in terms of time since
AD diagnosis as a proxy for severity of illness. The same

 persons are included in both outcome analyses (head in-
jury and TBI) and persons with head injury in TBI ana-
lyses were censored at the point when they experience
head injury other than TBI. For 63 users, two comparison
persons could not be identified and they were excluded
from further analyses. The follow-up started on the date
of antidepressant initiation for users and the correspond-
ing matching date for nonusers.
Covariates
Covariates potentially having an impact on the risk of
head or brain injury and antidepressant use were con-
sidered as described in Additional file 1. Traditional
multivariable analyses were adjusted for cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, asthma/chronic obstructive pulmon-
ary disease (COPD), epilepsy, substance abuse, cancer,
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or depression, baseline
use of antipsychotics, opioids, benzodiazepines and re-
lated drugs, history of stroke and hip fracture, and so-
cioeconomic
position.
In
order
to
simultaneously
control for a wider range of covariates that may have
impact on initiation of antidepressants, we derived a
propensity score by logistic regression. Propensity score
represents the probability of treatment (antidepressant
use) given the measured confounders that are included
in the propensity score [20]. Propensity scores help to
deal with the selection bias in which a number of ob-
served (confounding) covariates might be unbalanced
between the groups to be compared. This propensity
score, including comorbid conditions (both somatic
and psychiatric), use of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines
and related drugs, and other drugs (ever before the
follow-up or at the beginning of follow-up), and history
of previous fractures, was used for adjusting. The co-
variates are described in Additional file 1 and all covar-
iates presented in Table 1 (except age and gender,
which were matching variables) were included in the
propensity score. Socioeconomic class included missing
data (no records at Statistics Finland) for about 1% of
the cohort and this was coded as one category (un-
known). Other variables did not include missing data.
Statistical analyses
Analyses were restricted to the first antidepressant use
periods as the new user design avoids prevalent user bias
(i.e., prevalent users are the selected group as they toler-
ate the drug). Thus, the follow-up for users ended on
discontinuation of use if that happened before other rea-
sons for the end of follow-up. In all analyses, the follow-
up ended on the outcome of interest (head injury or
TBI), on >90 days hospitalization/institutionalization
period, death, or the end of study follow-up (31 December
2012). In TBI analyses, the follow-up was censored if the
person experienced a head injury other than TBI.
The analyses were conducted with Cox proportional
hazard models by taking into account the matched de-
sign (own strata were used for each matching group).
The main analyses compared antidepressant users with
nonusers. Time-varying exposure was modeled using
categorical time-dependent variable with classes for
≤30 days, 31–180 days, 181–365 days, 366–733 days,
and over 733 days of exposure. Drug class analyses clas-
sified antidepressant users to SSRI users and other anti-
depressant users and compared these with nonusers. In
drug class analyses, 38 persons starting concurrently with
both SSRI and other antidepressant use were excluded and
the analyses were censored if a person started concomitant
use or switched the drug class during the follow-up. The
drug class analyses were also restricted to the first 2000 days
of use due to sparsity of data with a longer follow-up time.
We conducted intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses to assess
the effect of informative censoring, i.e., drug use is discon-
tinued due to adverse effects that would lead to the studied
outcome. In these ITT analyses, antidepressant users were
considered as users for 180 days regardless of possible dis-
continuation of use or hospitalizations (the follow-up ended
on outcome, death, and the end of study follow-up after
which data were no longer available). The follow-up was re-
stricted to the first 180 days as the initial intention for treat-
ment was assumed to hold for only a certain time period.
In as-treated analyses, comparison of users with nonusers
was restricted similarly to the first 180 days of follow-up.
All analyses were conducted unadjusted, adjusted for
selected covariates, and adjusted for propensity score.
The covariate balance across treatment groups before
and after propensity score adjustment was assessed
with logistic regression.
In addition, the dose-response relationship between
antidepressant use and head injuries and TBIs was con-
ducted by categorizing the mean dose in DDDs used in
antidepressant monotherapy into <1 and ≥1 DDDs per
day. Dose categories were compared to nonusers and by
comparing higher dose with lower dose.
Sensitivity analyses with a case-crossover design were
used with the aim to controlling for unmeasured con-
founding. Head and brain injury cases without exclusion
of prevalent users were included in these within-
individual analyses in which each person served as their
own control. Persons with a previous head injury before
AD diagnosis were excluded, and included persons
needed to have at least 120 days of follow-up before the
event. The case period was defined as 1–14 days before the
outcome event (head injury or TBI), and three control pe-
riods were applied before the outcome (31–45, 60–74, and
120–134 days before the event). Multiple control periods
were used to test the robustness of the results. Conditional
logistic regression analyses were utilized to compare preva-
lence of antidepressant use between the case and control

 periods. The analyses were adjusted for time-dependent use
of benzodiazepines and related drugs, antipsychotics, and
opioids.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS statis-
tical software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC,
USA). Data were retrieved from the registers by the
register maintainers and de-identified register data were
submitted to the research team. Participants were not
contacted in any way. According to Finnish legislation,
no ethics committee approval is required in these
circumstances.
Results
In this study, 10,910 antidepressant users and 21,820
matched nonusers were included; the majority of these
were women in both groups (69.0%). The mean age of
antidepressant users was 79.5 (standard deviation (SD)
6.8) years and 79.6 (SD 6.7) years for nonusers. Table 1
shows the comparison between users and nonusers in
terms of baseline characteristics. Antidepressant users
were more likely to use other psychotropic drugs (anti-
psychotics and benzodiazepines and related drugs) and
opioids and to have history of hospital-treated bipolar
disorder or depression. None of the factors were associ-
ated with antidepressant use after adjusting for propen-
sity score.
During the follow-up (median 249 days, interquartile
range (IQR) 77–642 days, for antidepressant users and
656 days, IQR 316–1155, for nonusers), 1373 head injur-
ies were recorded and 677 (49%) of them were TBIs.
Age-adjusted incidence rate for head injuries per 100
person-years was 2.98 (95% confidence interval (CI)
2.49–3.06) during antidepressant use and 2.43 (95% CI
2.06–2.35) during nonuse (incidence rate difference 0.55,
95% CI 0.52–0.58). Age-adjusted incidence rate for TBIs
per 100 person-years was 1.33 (95% CI 1.13–1.53) during
antidepressant use and 1.10 (95% CI 1.00–1.20) during
nonuse (incidence rate difference 0.23, 95% CI 0.21–0.25).
Antidepressant use was associated with an increased
risk of head injury (propensity score adjusted hazard ra-
tio (HR) 1.35, 95% CI 1.20–1.52) and TBI (HR 1.26, 95%
CI 1.06–1.50) (Tables 2 and 3). The risk was highest at
the beginning of antidepressant use (HR 1.71, 95% CI
1.10–2.66, for head injury, and HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.12–
3.82, for TBI). For head injury, the risk remained ele-
vated even until 2 years of use whereas, for TBI, the risk
was significant only for the first 30 days of use, although
the point estimate was indicative of an increased risk
with longer durations of use. SSRI use was associated
with an increased risk of head injury (HR 1.26, 95% CI
1.10–1.45), whereas drug class analyses for TBI showed
no risk for either drug classes. Antidepressants were
associated with both outcomes in as-treated and
intention-to-treat analyses for the first 180 days of
use, although the confidence intervals for TBI also in-
cluded 1. No significant dose-response for risk of head
injuries or TBIs was found in analyses of dose categories
(Additional file 1: Table S1).
In case-crossover analyses, antidepressant use was
consistently associated with higher risk of head injury in
all control periods, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) ranging
from 1.64 to 2.04 (control periods 30-45, 60–74 and
120–134 days, respectively; Table 4). For TBI, anti-
depressant use was significantly associated with an in-
creased risk only with the control period 120–134 days
(OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.22–2.69), although the point esti-
mates were indicative of the increased risk.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the
risk of head and brain injuries associated with anti-
depressant use. Antidepressant users had an increased
risk of head injuries and TBIs among persons with Alz-
heimer’s disease in the exposure-matched cohort design
while adjusting for propensity score. The risk was high-
est at the beginning of antidepressant use and, for head
injuries, lasted for over 2 years of use and, for traumatic
brain injury, the risk was evident only at the beginning
of use although the risk estimates were also suggestive
of increased risk after that. As-treated and intention-to-
treat analyses for the first 180 days resulted in similar re-
sults as for the main analyses. Sensitivity analyses with
within-individual case-crossover design indicated that
antidepressant use is associated with an increased risk of

 head injuries but not consistently with TBIs. In general,
the associations between antidepressant use and TBIs
were less consistent and some analyses lacked statistical
significance although the risk estimates indicated an in-
creased risk, possibly due to small number of events for
users.
Our study population included persons with Alzheimer’s
disease who are at increased risk of falling compared with
cognitively intact older persons [21]. Previous studies also
show that persons with AD have two- to three-times
higher risk of injurious falls such as hip fractures [22, 23].
Previous studies have indicated that antidepressant use is
associated with an increased risk of falls and fractures
among older persons [8–10]. Our results on an increased
risk of head and brain injuries which typically are caused
by falls are in line with these previous results. As anti-
depressant use has been associated with an increased
risk of falling among the general older population it is
likely that the risk of head and brain injuries is not lim-
ited to persons with AD or dementia and further stud-
ies should be conducted among older persons without
dementia/AD. Our findings are particularly concerning
in the light of recent studies reporting an increasing
trend of antidepressant use among persons with de-
mentia [2, 7]. These trends imply that antidepressants
are used as the “safer choice” instead of antipsychotics
for various BPSD symptoms, and this treatment prac-
tice may prove problematic.
The mechanisms behind the high risk for injurious
falls are assumed to be related to the fall-risk increasing
features of antidepressants [8], as the majority of head
and brain injuries are caused by falls among older per-
sons [12]. Sedative drug use has been associated with
slower walking speed, impaired balance [24], and lower
strength among older persons [25]. These findings may
partially be explained by the sedative effects of antide-
pressants to various receptor activities in the central
nervous system. The second-generation antidepressants
antagonize H1 and alpha2-receptors leading to sedation
[26, 27]. Antagonism of muscarinic receptors is known
to cause sedative effects [26], although tricyclics were
infrequently used in our study. Antidepressant use is
shown to impair cognitive processing and produce impair-
ments in alertness, reaction time, and motor abilities, and
these have been also associated with SSRIs [28]. In
addition, antidepressants are also known to increase the
risk of hyponatremia [9, 29] which may lead to falls [30].
For head injuries, SSRI use was associated with an in-
creased risk whereas other antidepressants were not
significantly associated. For TBI, neither SSRI or other
antidepressants resulted in significant associations pos-
sibly due to the smaller number of TBIs. It is unlikely

 that the risk of head injuries would be limited to SSRIs.
Many antidepressants in the “other antidepressant” cat-
egory, such as mianserine, mirtazapine, and some tri-
cyclic antidepressants, have more pronounced sedative
effects than SSRIs [26, 28]. In the study by Coupland et
al., SSRIs were associated with a somewhat higher risk
of falls than other antidepressants but a lower risk of
many other adverse outcomes, and a similar risk of
fractures [9]. Thus, differential risks associated with
antidepressant classes should be further studied in
future.
Strengths and limitations
We investigated antidepressant use and the associated
risk of head and brain injuries in a large, nationwide
cohort
including community-dwelling persons with
Alzheimer’s disease. The results are generalizable to
community-dwelling persons with AD. The analyses
were restricted to the first head or brain injury to avoid
multiple hospitalizations due to the same event. The new
user design, with exclusion of prevalent users, controls for
survival and selection biases associated with prevalent use.
As aging and the progression of AD increases the risk of

 head and brain injuries, we formed an exposure-matched
cohort design by matching nonusers to every antidepres-
sant initiator. With this design, we were able to control for
time since AD diagnosis which is a proxy for progression
of the disease. We also matched comparison persons in
terms of age since age is a major risk factor for falling [31].
Besides having age, gender, and time since AD diagnosis
utilized in the matching, the analyses were adjusted for
propensity score predicting antidepressant treatment
and propensity score adjusted analyses confirmed the
increased risk. Intention-to-treat analyses controlled for
informative censoring and led to similar results. As in all
observational studies, residual confounding may still exist.
It is possible that the indications of antidepressant use
may partially explain the observed association. In the ob-
servational study setting we lacked precise knowledge on
indications for drug use, and the severity, frequency, and
duration of symptoms for which antidepressants were
used. However, sensitivity analyses with a case-crossover
design were conducted to further assess unmeasured
confounding at an individual level, such as problems
with balance or mobility, and capabilities for activities
of daily functioning. The sensitivity analyses confirmed
results for head injuries and partly for TBIs.
We utilized a mathematical modeling method, PRE2DUP
[19], to construct drug-use periods from Prescription regis-
ter data to retrieve valid estimates of drug exposure [32].
Previous research has demonstrated that the Prescription
register provides valid data for antidepressant use among
older persons [33]. Due to limitations in the registers (i.e.,
lack of data from outpatient care), head and brain injuries
are limited to the cases treated in hospitals or who died due
to injury. Thus, milder events may be lacking and the risks
may be underestimated. Although registers widely cover
data on important confounders, many important factors,
such as the severity of AD, frequency and nature of be-
havioral symptoms, or indication for drug use, are not
recorded and, thus, residual confounding may exist.
These factors were controlled for to some extent in
within-individual analyses.
Conclusions
Antidepressant use has been previously associated with
an increased risk of falls, but our novel findings indicate
that they are associated with severe injurious falls, i.e.,
those resulting in head or brain injuries among persons
with Alzheimer’s disease. The association between anti-
depressant use and head and brain injuries should be
confirmed in further studies. As antidepressant use has
also been associated with an increased risk of falling in
previous studies, clinicians should keep on carefully con-
sidering indications and use of antidepressants for the
safety of vulnerable patients.
