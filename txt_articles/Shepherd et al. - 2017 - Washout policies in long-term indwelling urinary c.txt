Background
People requiring long-term bladder draining with an indwelling catheter can experience catheter blockage. Regimens involving different
solutions can be used to wash out catheters with the aim of preventing blockage. This is an update of a review published in 2010.
Objectives
To determine if certain washout regimens are better than others in terms of effectiveness, acceptability, complications, quality of life and
critically appraise and summarise economic evidence for the management of long-term indwelling urinary catheterisation in adults.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, Clinical-
Trials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings to 23 May 2016. We also examined all reference
lists of identified trials and contacted manufacturers and researchers in the field.
Selection criteria
All randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing catheter washout policies (e.g. washout versus no washout, different washout
solutions, frequency, duration, volume, concentration, method of administration) in adults (aged 16 years and above) in any setting
(i.e. hospital, nursing/residential home, community) with an indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheter for more than 28 days.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently extracted data. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Data were assessed and analysed as
described in the Cochrane Handbook. If data in trials were not fully reported, clarification was sought from the study authors. For
categorical outcomes, the numbers reporting an outcome were related to the numbers at risk in each group to derive a risk ratio (RR).
For continuous outcomes, means and standard deviations were used to derive mean differences (MD).

 Main results
We included seven trials involving a total of 349 participants, 217 of whom completed the studies. Three were cross-over and four
were parallel-group randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, two trials were added for this update (one parallel-group RCT with
40 participants and one cross-over RCT with 67 participants). Analyses of three cross-over trials yielded suboptimal results because
they were based on between-group differences rather than individual participants’ differences for sequential interventions. Two parallel-
group trials had limited clinical value: one combined results for suprapubic and urethral catheters and the other provided data for only
four participants. Only one trial was free of significant methodological limitations, but there were difficulties with recruitment and
maintaining participants in this study.
The included studies reported data on six of the nine primary and secondary outcome measures. None of the trials addressed: number
of catheters used, washout acceptability measures (including patient satisfaction, patient discomfort, pain and ease of use), or health
status/measures of psychological health; very limited data were collected for health economic outcomes. Trials assessed only three of
the eight intervention comparisons identified. Two trials reported in more than one comparison group.
Four trials compared washout (either saline or acidic solution) with no washout. We are uncertain if washout solutions (saline or acidic),
compared to no washout solutions, has an important effect on the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection or length of time each
catheter was in situ because the results are imprecise.
Four trials compared different types of washout solution; saline versus acidic solutions (2 trials); saline versus acidic solution versus
antibiotic solution (1 trial); saline versus antimicrobial solution (1 trial). We are uncertain if type of washout solution has an important
effect on the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection or length of time each catheter was in situ because the results are imprecise.
One trial compareddifferentcompositionsof acidicsolution(strongerversusweakersolution). We are uncertainif differentcompositions
of acidic solutions has an important effect on the rate of symptomatic urinary tract infection or length of time each catheter was in situ
because only 14 participants (of 25 who were recruited) completed this 12 week, three arm trial.
Four studies reported on possible harmful effects of washout use, such as blood in the washout solution, changes in blood pressure and
bladder spasms.
There were very few small trials that met the review inclusion criteria. The high risk of bias of the included studies resulted in the
evidence being graded as low or very low quality.
Authors’ conclusions
Data from seven trials that compared different washout policies were limited, and generally, of poor methodological quality or were
poorly reported. The evidence was not adequate to conclude if washouts were beneficial or harmful. Further rigorous, high quality trials
that are adequately powered to detect benefits from washout being performed as opposed to no washout are needed. Trials comparing
different washout solutions, washout volumes, and frequencies or timings are also needed.

How effective are urinary catheter washout solutions?
Review question
We aimed to assess effectiveness of urinary catheter washout solutions. This is an update of a review previously published in 2010.
Background
For a range of reasons, some people are unable to empty their bladders properly or leak urine (urinary incontinence). Urinary catheters,
which are soft tubes inserted into the bladder to drain urine to a collection bag, are often used to help people with urinary incontinence.
The same type of catheter is used for men and women.
In the UK, about 4% of people receiving home care, and around 9% of patients in nursing homes (but possibly up to 40% in some
places), are living with long-term catheters.
Urinary catheter care can be difficult, and problems can occur, especially if used for a long time.

 Catheter blockages can occur when kept in place in the bladder for a long time. Blockages may affect half of all people with long-term
catheters causing pain and distress. Liquid solutions may be injected into the catheter to prevent or relieve blockages. This is known as
a washout. These problems mean that assistance from healthcare professionals is needed for people with urinary catheter blockages.
Search date
The evidence is current up to 23 May 2016.
Study characteristics
We included seven studies that presented information on 217 people who completed the studies of 349 who started in the trials. Two
studies were new for this update. The studies, published between 1979 and 2014, were conducted in the USA (3 studies), the UK (2
studies), and one each in Canada and Finland.
The studies included people with long-term catheters. People were allocated randomly to have catheter washouts or not, and the effects
compared. We also included studies that compared different types of washout solutions.
Four studies reported on possible harmful effects of washout use, such as blood in the washout solution, changes in blood pressure and
bladder spasms.
Study funding sources
The included studies were funded by Novobay Pharmaceuticals Inc (Linsenmeyer 2014); Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical
Research and the Canadian Nurses Foundation (Moore 2009); National institute of Aging, National Institutes of Health (Muncie
1989); Paralyzed Veterans of America Spinal Cord Research Foundation (Waites 2006). Three studies did not report funding sources.
Key results
There was not enough good research evidence to determine if catheter washouts were useful.
Quality of the evidence
The included trials were generally small with methodological flaws. This included limited details on how participants were randomly
allocated into groups and how both participants and researchers were blinded to these groups. Evidence quality was low to very low.
New trials are needed to definitively answer this research question.

Description of the condition
Indwelling catheterisation may be used for people with intractable
incontinence or chronic bladder outlet obstruction. People may
require long-term urinary catheterisation for a number of reasons:
urinary retention (incomplete emptying of the bladder) caused
by benign prostatic hyperplasia (enlarged prostate) or prostate tu-
mour, reduced bladder contractility, or urinary incontinence (in-
voluntary leakage of urine) not amenable to toileting, intermittent
catheterisation, or any other method of management. People with
conditions such as multiple sclerosis, dementia, stroke, spina bi-
fida, and spinal cord injury may be susceptible to these problems.
Numbers of people being managed using long-term catheters is
difficult to estimate. Between April and May 2013, 1181 long-
term care facilities in Europe participated in a point prevalence sur-
vey of healthcare-associated infection and related risk factors. The
median percentage of long-term care facility residents with a uri-
nary catheter was 6.3%; the highest percentage of urinary catheter-
isation was reported in the Czech Republic (33.3%) (ECDC
2014). The percentage of people receiving care at home with a
urinary catheter was estimated to be 5.4% in another European
study (range 0% to 23%) (Sørbye 2005). Those using catheters
long-term often experience complications such as blockage, leak-
age and infection. These complications can have significant impli-
cations for resource use and quality of life due to increased general
practitioner and hospital outpatient appointments, emergency ad-
missions and nursing resource demands (Evans 2000).
Bacterial infection
Bacteriuria, which occurs when bacteria colonise the urinary tract,
is the root cause of catheter-associated complications. Bacteriuria
risk increases with days of catheterisation (Garibaldi 1974; Stark
1984); over time, all people with a catheter will develop bacteruria
(SIGN 2012). Increased levels of bacteriuria may expose people to
increased risk of complications, including catheter-associated uri-
nary tract infection (CAUTI), secondary bacteraemia (blood in-
fection) and infection at other sites, such as the joints. Up to 30%
of long-term catheterised people will become symptomatic and
require some intervention (Saint 1999). Bacteriuria and CAUTI
are significant problems in long-term care. People with urinary
catheters are up to 6.5 times more likely to develop urinary tract
infection (Sørbye 2005); the prevalence of CAUTI has been esti-
mated to be 8.5% (Getliffe 2006).
In an attempt to deal with the problems of bacterial colonisation,
encrustations (biofilm) and CAUTI, catheter washouts or irriga-
tions (sometimes called bladder washouts or irrigations) were in-
troduced (Getliffe 2003). Over the last few decades, various antibi-
otic and antiseptic solutions have been used as washout solutions
with the aim of preventing and treating catheter-associated prob-
lems. However, evidence about their effectiveness is conflicting.
Concerns exist that use of washouts can damage the bladder mu-
cosa and increase infection rates due to opening the closed catheter
system. Current UK National Health Service guidelines specify
that antibiotic solutions are not effective in treating CAUTI (HIS
2004). Use of antiseptic washouts is also believed to be of little
value for the prevention and treatment of CAUTI and is no longer
advised in practice (Pellowe 2003).
Catheter blockage
The most common problem of long-term indwelling catheters
is the formation of encrustations on the luminal and outer sur-
faces of the catheter with consequent blockage and by-passing of
urine resulting in urinary leakage. Nearly half of all people with an
indwelling catheter experience problems with catheter blockage
due to encrustation (Getliffe 1992; Kohler-Ockmore 1996; Kunin
1987; Roe 1987). Blockage of an indwelling catheter is traumatic,
causing pain and distress. The most commonly isolated bacteria
in blockages is Proteus mirabilis (Stickler 2010), which may cause
crystalline deposits (such as calcium phosphate and magnesium
ammonium phosphate (struvite)) to build up through a rise in pH
caused by the metabolism of urea to ammonia and bicarbonate
(Hesse 1992; Wilks 2015).
Fungal infection
Candiduria (the presence of Candida species in the urine) can also
occur in people with long-term indwelling catheters, and its inci-
dence is directly related to duration of catheterisation, hospitalisa-
tion and antibiotic use (Hamory 1978). Candida spp are thought
to be the second most common micro-organisms causing CAUTI
or asymptomatic colonisation in people who are catheterised
(Padawer 2015). Candiduria is generally asymptomatic but rare
complications can include fungal balls in the bladder or renal
pelvis, kidney infection and disseminated candidiasis (infection
with Candida spp). Management for people with asymptomatic
catheter-associated candiduria is unclear. Removing the catheter
results in the disappearance of candiduria in about a third of peo-
ple. For people who are asymptomatic. but in whom candiduria
persists or must remain catheterised, several management tech-
niques have been used, primarily involving oral medication or
bladder irrigation. The solutions used and the method of admin-
istration (continuous irrigation), in the treatment of fungal infec-
tions are very different and hence were not evaluated in this review.
Description of the intervention
Current practice for the management of people with catheter en-
crustation and blockage varies but is largely dependent on the use
of catheter maintenance solutions. Treatments commonly used for

 people living in the community include washing out the catheter
with saline or acidic solutions or both. However, there is much
debate about this practice.
How the intervention might work
Invitroevidence suggeststhatnormal saline is ineffective in dimin-
ishing encrustations but there is some evidence that methenamine
preparations and acidic washouts reduce catheter encrustation
(Getliffe 1994; Hesse 1989; King 1991). Other research work
questions the efficacy of acidification of the urine for prevent-
ing catheter encrustation (Bibby 1993). Furthermore, none of the
continence advisers questioned in a 1993 study thought that reg-
ular washouts were useful compared to 25% of district nurses who
thought they were (Capewell 1993). Despite the controversy sur-
rounding the effectiveness of washouts for managing encrustation
and blockage, they are widely used (Pomfret 2004).
Why it is important to do this review
There is no consensus regarding the indications for use of catheter
washoutsnorthe methodof administration, frequency, durationof
administration or choice of solution. The wide variety of solutions
available, combined with the multiplicity of possible procedures
for their application, and potential risks posed, indicated need for
an update of this systematic review. We aimed to summarise the
evidence from randomised controlled trials on the use of catheter
washouts for the management of adults with long-term indwelling
urinary catheters.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials, including
cross-over designs, evaluating the use of urinary catheter washouts
in long-term catheterised adults.
Types of participants
Adults,agedatleast16years,inanysetting(i.e.hospital,nursingor
residential home, community) with an indwelling urethral, supra-
pubic or perineal catheter in situ for more than 28 days. Adults
whose treatment combined intermittent catheterisation with pe-
riods of indwelling catheterisation were included only if the in-
dwelling catheter had been in situ for more than 28 days at the
time of data collection.
Types of interventions
The interventions considered included catheter washouts with wa-
ter, saline, antiseptic, acidic, antimicrobial or antibiotic solutions
alone or in any combination. Studies were considered that com-
pared:
1. washouts with controls who did not receive washouts;
2. washouts with other participants who received different
washouts;
3. different washout regimens at different time periods i.e.
cross-over studies; and
4. different washout regimens i.e. frequency, duration,
volume, concentration, method of administration.
Throughout the literature, the terminology used to refer to
the ’washing-out’ of catheters is somewhat confusing. The term
’washout’ tends to be used in the US literature whereas in the
UK, catheter washouts are often referred to as ’catheter mainte-
nance solutions’ or ’bladder washout’ which can cause confusion
with bladder irrigation/lavage used after surgery (Getliffe 1996).
In this review all trials referring to catheter or bladder washouts
were considered with the exception of post-surgical bladder irri-
gations, therapeutic bladder instillations used, for example, in the
treatment of people with cancer, and continuous irrigations with
antifungal solutions.
Trials that involved irrigation of catheter drainage bags were not
considered in this review. Other types of interventions to prevent
or reduce encrustation or infection, such as changes in fluid intake
or use of oral prophylactic antibiotics, were also excluded.
We planned to compare:
1. use of any type of catheter washout (e.g. water, saline,
antiseptic, antibiotic) versus not using one;
2. one type of catheter washout solution versus another type;
3. clinically or microbiologically indicated washout versus
routine washout;
4. long intervals between catheter washouts versus short
intervals;
5. one method of administration of catheter washouts (e.g.
agitation, gravity, syringe) versus another method;
6. smaller volumes of washout solution versus larger volumes;
7. a stronger solution of washout versus a weaker solution; and
8. a single washout instillation versus two or more sequential
washout instillations of the same type.

 Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
Catheter washouts were introduced to prevent or reduce the occur-
rence of catheter-associated infection. In recent years their use has
been primarily aimed at minimising the effects of recurrent encrus-
tation and blockage. Primary outcomes considered were objective
measures of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI;
which ranged in definitions among trials) and catheter blockage.
Such measures include:
• symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) (as defined by
the trialists);
• number of catheters used;
• length of time each catheter was in situ;
• catheter removal rates due to blockage or infection
(definitions of blockage or infection were those used in the trial
reports); and
• rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria.
Secondary outcomes
1. Washout acceptability measures
Reported levels of patient discomfort associated with washouts;
patient satisfaction with the outcome of washouts (i.e. minimisa-
tion of catheter-associated problems, reduction in pain and trauma
when the catheter was withdrawn); and ease of use of washouts/
washout regimens for patients, their carers and healthcare practi-
tioners were considered.
2. Health status or measures of psychological health
Quality of life and psychological outcome indicators as measured
by generic validated instruments such as Short Form 36 (SF-36)
(Ware 1993) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS)
(Zigmond 1983) were sought.
3. Measures of complications or adverse effects of washouts
Adverse effects that result at the time of washout administration,
such as inability to tolerate washout solution and irritation or
trauma to urethral or bladder tissue were considered. These effects
may be indicated by bypassing or bleeding around the catheter or
by volume of red blood cells returned during washout procedure.
Use of prophylactic antibiotics and rescue antibiotics were also
included.
4. Health economic outcomes
Economic measures considered included costs of washouts, re-
source implications associated with different washouts/washout
regimens, and any reports of formal economic evaluations of
washouts, such as cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis.
Search methods for identification of studies
We did not impose any language or other limitations on the
searches.
Electronic searches
We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials
Register for this update. Details of the search methods used to
build the Specialised Register are presented in the Group’s module
in the Cochrane Library. The Register contains trials identified
from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CEN-
TRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub
Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP,
UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio and results from hand-
searching journals and conference proceedings. Many of the trials
in the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register are also
contained in CENTRAL. The last search was conducted 23 May
2016.
The terms used to search the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised
Register are given in Appendix 1.
Searches performed by the review authors for the 2010 version of
this review (Hagen 2010) are detailed in Appendix 2.
Searching other resources
We searched the reference lists of relevant articles for other possibly
relevant trials.
For the 2010 version of the review key researchers in the field of
catheter management, and catheter maintenance solution manu-
facturers (BBraun, Coloplast and Bard) were contacted to identify
other possibly relevant trials (Hagen 2010).
We contacted the authors of any ongoing studies to enquire as to
whether any results were available (October 2015).
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (AS, SH) independently screened titles and
abstracts for inclusion of all the potential studies identified as a
result of the search. We retrieved the full-text study reports and
the same two review authors independently screened the full-text
to identify studies for inclusion. We recorded reasons for exclusion
of the ineligible studies. We resolved disagreements through dis-
cussion or, if required, we consulted a third review author (WM).
We identified and excluded duplicates and collated multiple re-
ports of the same study so that each study rather than each report
9

 was the unit of interest in the review. We recorded the selection
process in a PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1), and Characteristics
of excluded studies.
Figure 1.
Study flow diagram
Data extraction and management
We used a data collection form for study characteristics and out-
come data which was used for the 2010 version of this review
(Hagen 2010). Two review authors (AS, SH) extracted study char-
acteristics from included studies. We extracted the following study
characteristics.
1. Methods: study design, total duration of study, details of
any run-in period, number of study centres and location, study
setting, withdrawals, random allocation sequence, outcome

 assessment blinding and date of study.
2. Participants: N, mean age, age range, gender, inclusion
criteria, and exclusion criteria.
3. Interventions: intervention, comparison, method of
administration.
4. Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and
collected, and time points reported.
5. Notes: funding for trial, and notable conflicts of interest of
trial authors.
Two review authors (AS, SH) independently extracted outcome
data from included studies. We noted in Characteristics of
included studies if outcome data were not reported in a usable
way. We resolved disagreements by consensus or by involving a
third review author (WM). One review author (SH) transferred
data into the Review Manager file (RevMan 2014). We double-
checked that data were entered correctly by comparing the data
presented in the systematic review with the study reports. A second
review author (AS) spot-checked study characteristics for accuracy
against the trial report.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (AS, SH) independently assessed risk of bias
for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). We resolved
disagreements by discussion or by involving another review author
(WM). We assessed the risk of bias according to the following
domains.
1. Random sequence generation.
2. Allocation concealment.
3. Blinding of participants and personnel.
4. Blinding of outcome assessment.
5. Incomplete outcome data.
6. Selective outcome reporting.
7. Other bias.
We graded each potential source of bias as high, low or unclear and
justified our judgement in the ’Risk of bias’ table. We summarised
the risk of bias judgements across different studies for each of the
domains listed. We considered blinding separately for different
key outcomes, where necessary. Where information on risk of bias
related to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we
noted this in the ’Risk of bias’ table.
When considering treatment effects, we took into account the risk
of bias for the studies that contribute to that outcome.
Measures of treatment effect
We intended to enter the outcome data for each study into the
data tables in Review Manager 5 to calculate the treatment effects
(RevMan 2014). We planned to use risk ratio for dichotomous
outcomes, and mean differences or standardised mean differences
forcontinuousoutcomes.Thiswasnotpossible because onlysingle
studies were available for analyses.
Unit of analysis issues
We planned to analyse cross-over trials with continuous outcomes
by determining the mean and standard error of the person dif-
ference between treatment periods; however, data from cross-over
trials were not reported appropriately and this was not possible.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted investigators or study sponsors to verify key study
characteristics and obtain missing numerical outcome data where
possible. Where this was not possible, and the missing data were
thoughttointroduce seriousbias, we plannedtoexplore the impact
of including such studies in the overall assessment of results by a
sensitivity analysis. However, this was not possible.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We planned to use the I² statistic to measure heterogeneity among
the trials in each analysis. If we identified substantial heterogeneity,
we planned to report it and explore possible causes by prespecified
subgroup analysis. However, this was not possible as only single
studies were identified.
Assessment of reporting biases
We planned that if the meta-analysis included more than 10 trials,
we wouldconstructafunnel plottoassessreportingbiases(Higgins
2011). However, this was not possible.
Data synthesis
Included trial data were to be analysed as described in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
It was planned that where possible (only with two independent
comparisons from one trial), meta-analysis would be undertaken
using a fixed-effect model approach, if there was no evidence of
significant heterogeneity. For cross-over trials we planned to anal-
yse data as recommended in section 16.4 of the Handbook. How-
ever, no suitable data were available and meta-analysis was not
performed.
GRADE and ’Summary of findings’ table
We created ’Summary of findings’ tables using clinically important
primary outcomes:
• rates of symptomatic UTIs (as defined by the trialists);
• number of catheters used;
• length of time each catheter was in situ;
• catheter removal rates due to blockage or infection
(definitions of blockage or infection were those used in the trial
reports); and
• rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria.
11

 We used the five GRADE considerations (study limitations, con-
sistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias)
to assess the quality of the body of evidence as it relates to the stud-
ies which contribute data to the meta-analyses for the prespecified
outcomes (Atkins 2004). We used methods and recommendations
described in Section 8.5 and Chapter 12 of the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011) using
GRADEpro GDT software (GRADEpro GDT 2015). We justi-
fied all decisions to down- or up-grade the quality of studies using
footnotes, and made comments to aid the reader’s understanding
of the review where necessary.
Summary of findings tables were not presented for comparisons
where no studies were identified. Presentation of summary of find-
ings tables for these comparisons will be considered in future up-
dates of the review if more data becomes available.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We intended to perform subgroup analysis to explore the impact
of subgroups on the intervention. Insufficient data were provided
and analyses was not performed.
Sensitivity analysis
We intended to conduct sensitivity analysis by including or ex-
cluding trials we judged as high risk of bias. We did not conduct
sensitivity analysis because meta-analysis was not performed.

Description of studies
Results of the search
The search identified 686 records (Figure 1). Of these, 23 reported
potentially eligible studies. Clarification was sought at this stage
regardingstudycharacteristicsfromfive studyauthors: twoauthors
responded, two authors could not be contacted and a response was
not received from one author.
This update included two new studies (Airaksinen 1979;
Linsenmeyer 2014; 107 participants) to bring the total num-
ber of included studies to seven (349 participants randomised).
Airaksinen 1979 was identified as a study awaiting assessment
in the 2010 review. Four studies were parallel-group randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) and included a total of 213 participants
(Airaksinen 1979; McNicoll 2003; Moore 2009; Waites 2006)
and three were randomised cross-over trials which included a total
of 136 participants (Kennedy 1992; Linsenmeyer 2014; Muncie
1989). Three studies were conducted in the USA (Linsenmeyer
2014; Muncie 1989; Waites 2006), twointhe UK (Kennedy 1992;
McNicoll 2003), and one each in Canada (Moore 2009) and Fin-
land (Airaksinen 1979).
One study (NCT02130518) is ongoing and results are not yet
available (see Characteristics of ongoing studies).
Included studies
Participants
Airaksinen 1979 studied 40 participants (16 males, 24 females)
who were recruited from a Finnish health service centre and were
randomly assigned into four groups (two experimental and two
control). Washouts were withheld in the control groups.
Kennedy 1992 studied 25 elderly women from three UK hospitals
who were long-term catheterised. This study comprised a within-
patient comparison of three different solutions (saline, citric acid
3.23%, citric acid 6%). Participants received all three washout
solutions but in different orders.
Linsenmeyer 2014 studied 67 adults with neurogenic bladder
who had long-term indwelling transurethral or suprapubic urinary
catheters in this multicentre study conducted in the USA. This
study compared the use of an antimicrobial washout solution with
saline. The study was funded by Novobay Pharmaceuticals.
McNicoll 2003 studied 11 people in this UK-based study who
were living in the community with long-term catheters known to
block with encrustation. This study compared the use of citric
acid washouts with planned catheter changes.
Moore 2009 studied 73 (36 males, 37 females) Canadian commu-
nity-dwelling or long-term care adults with long-term indwelling
catheters that required changing every three weeks or less, requir-
ing supportive or continuing care. Participants were randomly as-
signed to one of three groups: control (usual care, no washout),
saline washout or acidic washout. The study was funded by the
Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research and the Cana-
dian Nurses Foundation.
Muncie 1989 studied 44 long-term hospitalised female patients
at one centre in Baltimore USA, aged 18 years or more who had
indwelling urethral catheters in place for 30 consecutive days or
longer. This randomised cross-over trial compared saline washout
with no washout and was funded by the National Institutes of
Health.
Waites 2006 randomised 89 community-residing patients (49
male, 40 female) in this USA-based study with neurogenic bladder
managed by indwelling catheter. This trial compared twice daily
washout using one of three different solutions (saline, acetic acid,
neomycin-polymyxin). This study was funded by the Paralyzed
Vetrans of America Spinal Cord Research Foundation.
Interventions
12
Washout policies in long-term indwelling urinary catheterisation in adults (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Three trials compared washout (using saline and/or acidic solu-
tion) with no washout (Airaksinen 1979; Moore 2009; Muncie
1989). Three trials compared different types of washout solution
(Kennedy 1992; Linsenmeyer 2014; Waites 2006). Kennedy 1992
included a comparison of alternative compositions of an acidic
solution, and Linsenmeyer 2014 compared an antimicrobial so-
lution with saline. McNicoll 2003 compared washout use with
planned catheter removal. The protocol for the planned catheter
removal group in McNicoll 2003 was not described, but varied
from patient to patient. McNicoll 2003 was included in analyses
comparing washout versus no washout.
Washout versus no washout
Moore 2009 reported that participants were randomised to one of
three groups: usual care with no washout; weekly catheter washout
with 50 mL sterile normal saline; and weekly catheter washout
with 50 mL sterile Contisol (also known as Suby G) (citric acid
3.23%). Study endpoints were eight weeks, three or more catheter
changes, or symptomatic UTI requiring antibiotics.
Muncie 1989 compared 10 weeks of once daily normal saline
washout (30 mL via syringe) with 10 weeks of no washout. New
catheters were inserted at the beginning and end of each study
phase, and drainage bags were changed weekly in both groups.
The intervention duration was 24 weeks (2-week no washout run-
in period, 10-week washout or no washout phase, and 2-week no
intervention period before entering alternate phase).
Airaksinen 1979 randomised 40 patients to four groups of 10
participants. Group 1 had Silicath catheter with regular wash out;
group 2 also had Silicath catheter but without washout; group
3 had Silastic catheter with wash out; and group 4 had Silastic
catheter but without washout. Those groups who received the
washout had this at two week intervals with normal saline; the
volume used was 10 mL or 20 mL depending on the size of the
catheter.
McNicoll 2003 included two parallel groups: daily instillation of
citric acid catheter maintenance solution, and planned catheter
removal. The volume of solution and method of administration
in the washout group were not stated. The control group were to
receive “planned catheter changes” but the protocol was not de-
scribed and this varied among patients. The intervention duration
was 12 weeks.
Different types of solution
Three types of solution were evaluated in Kennedy 1992: three
weeks of twice weekly washout with 0.9% sodium chloride
(saline); three weeks of twice weekly washout with Suby G; three
weeks of twice weekly washout with Solution R (citric acid 6%,
gluconolactone 0.6%,lightmagnesiumcarbonate 2.8%,disodium
edetate 0.01%). All washouts were administered by attaching a
100 mL sterile, pre-packed sachet to the catheter and allowing it to
drain into the bladder via gravity. The intervention duration was
12 weeks (1-week normal saline washout run-in period, plus a 3-
week phase with each of the solutions, and 1-week normal saline
washout between solutions).
Waites 2006 compared three solutions: eight weeks of twice daily
normal saline washout; eightweeksof twice daily0.25%aceticacid
washout; and eight weeks of twice daily neomycin-polymyxin GU
washout (containing 40 mg/mL neomycin sulphate and 200,000
U/mL polymyxin B). At each washout, 30 mL of the irrigant was
instilled for 20 minutes via a syringe.
Moore 2009 had three arms and provided a comparison of saline
and Contisol washout solutions in addition to a washout versus
no washout comparison.
Linsenmeyer 2014 compared different treatment regimens: 0.2%
auriclosene in preliminary formulation was dosed for over 2 weeks
(3 times/week), 0.2% auriclosene was dosed on the same schedule,
0.2% auriclosene twice weekly over four weeks. The control was
saline. Participants were randomised to one irrigation solution for
the first treatment regimen and after a washout period, irrigated
with the other solution.
A stronger solution of washout versus a weaker solution
In Kennedy 1992, two groups received washouts with different
compositions of acidic solution: one solution contained 3.23%
citric acid (Suby G) and the other 6% citric acid (Solution R).
However, other chemical components of the two solutions also
differed.
Excluded studies
See Characteristics of excluded studies. We excluded 14 studies;
the most common reasons for exclusion were that participants
were not catheterised for more than 28 days or the study was
not an RCT (Andersson 1986; Bach 1990; Bruun 1978; Davies
1987; Elliott 1989; Elliott 1990; Furuno 1998; Gelman 1980;
Kennedy 1984; Meyers 1964; Robertson 1990; Ruwaldt 1983;
Vainrub 1977; Warren 1978).
Ongoing studies
One randomised, double-blinded study (NCT02130518) is cur-
rently ongoing and aims to compare the use of 0.2% auriclosene
solution (8 treatments over 4 weeks) with a placebo comparator
auriclosene vehicle solution (8 treatments over 4 weeks). Authors
were contacted and responded that no results for this trial were
currently available. This study is being conducted in the USA and
is funded by NovoBay Pharmaceuticals. Further details are pre-
sented in Characteristics of ongoing studies.

 Allocation
Little information was provided about the process of concealment
of group allocation in most included trials. In Kennedy 1992 it
was assumed the allocation process was not concealed because
random number tables were used to determine the order in which
participants received the three solutions; this study was assessed at
unclear risk of bias. Five studies indicated that participants were
randomly allocated to study groups, but details were not provided
(Airaksinen 1979; Linsenmeyer 2014; McNicoll 2003; Muncie
1989; Waites 2006). These studies were assessed as unclear risk of
bias. Group assignment was determined by a computer-generated
list of random numbers, placed in opaque envelopes, which were
opened by the participant after consent was obtained in Moore
2009 (low risk of bias).
Blinding
Most studies gave insufficient or no information relating to blind-
ing. This may have been because blinding in this area of research
is difficult; both participants and healthcare providers are aware
of bladder washout being performed, and different washout solu-
tions may look different and can be identified. There were no de-
tails about blinding of participants, healthcare providers or study
assessors in relation to the intervention in four studies (Airaksinen
1979; Kennedy 1992; McNicoll 2003; Muncie 1989). These were
assessed as unclear risk of bias. Moore 2009 acknowledged that
it was not possible to blind the research nurse (who was also the
outcome assessor who performed the washout) to the two washout
solutions due to the nature of the packaging. Participants and
healthcare providers in two studies were blinded to treatment sta-
tus but descriptions were not provided (Linsenmeyer 2014; Waites
2006). These studies were assessed at low and unclear risk of bias,
respectively.
Incomplete outcome data
All included trials reported significant rates of withdrawals and
drop-outs, resulting in incomplete outcome data. However, with-
drawals and drop-outs were well described generally with four
trials assessed as low risk and three of unclear risk. Two trials
(Muncie 1989; Waites 2006) explored differences between com-
pleters and non-completers. Two small trials (Kennedy 1992;
McNicoll 2003) reported serious losses of participants resulting
in few data for analysis (14 and 4 participants, respectively), com-
pared with larger analysis data sets of other trials (Airaksinen 1979
N = 36, Linsenmeyer 2014 N = 48, Moore 2009 N = 53, Muncie
1989 N = 32, and Waites 2006 N = 52).
Selective reporting
Most trials reported all outcomes in results sections and were as-
sessed as low risk. There was some discrepancy in outcomes re-
ported in Airaksinen 1979 which was assessed as unclear risk of
bias. McNicoll 2003 stated in the methods section that UTI rates
were to be reported, but these were not described in the results.
This trial was judged at high risk of bias.
Other potential sources of bias
Only Moore 2009 stated that data were analysed using an inten-
tion-to-treat analysis for the primary outcome variable; that is, the
length of time each catheter was in situ was recorded as the date
the participant withdrew from the study. The remaining trials ei-
ther did not analyse according to the intention-to-treat principle
(Linsenmeyer 2014; McNicoll 2003; Muncie 1989; Waites 2006)
or this was unclear (Airaksinen 1979; Kennedy 1992).
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Any
washout compared to no washout for participants with long-term
indwelling urinary catheterisation; Summary of findings 2 One
washout solution versus another for participants with long-term
indwelling urinary catheterisation
With two exceptions (Linsenmeyer 2014; McNicoll 2003), all in-
cluded studies reported data on bacteriuria or symptomatic UTI.
All except two trials (Airaksinen 1979; Waites 2006) presented
data on catheter removal rates, either reporting mean number
of days a catheter was in situ (Kennedy 1992; Moore 2009) or
mean number of replacements (McNicoll 2003; Muncie 1989).
Kennedy 1992, Linsenmeyer 2014, and Moore 2009 looked
specifically at the problem of catheter blockage due to encrusta-
tion. Four trials reported data on complications or adverse events
of washouts: Kennedy 1992 reported red blood or urothelial cells
in the washout fluid; Moore 2009 investigated incidence of micro-
scopic haematuria and leukocytes in pre-washout dipstick urinal-
ysis; Linsenmeyer 2014 looked at irrigation-induced autonomic
dysreflexia; and Waites 2006 reported bladder spasms due to the
washout procedure. Only McNicoll 2003 considered health eco-
nomic outcomes, reporting on the cost and time of administra-
tion.
Some included trials addressed more than one pre-identified in-
tervention comparison. Four trials provided data on washout ver-
sus no washout (Airaksinen 1979; McNicoll 2003; Moore 2009;
Muncie 1989). Four trials compared different types of washout so-
lutions (Kennedy 1992; Linsenmeyer 2014; Moore 2009; Waites
2006). Kennedy 1992 compared three washout solutions: saline
with one acidic solution (Solution R, contained 6% citric acid)
16

 with another alternative composition (Suby G, contained 3.23%
citric acid).
Insufficient data were available in a form that enabled entry for
meta-analysis. No data were entered from four trials (Kennedy
1992; McNicoll 2003; Muncie 1989; Waites 2006). Kennedy
1992 andMuncie 1989 were cross-overtrialswhich didnotpresent
data in a way that highlighted the paired nature of the data, mak-
ing assessment problematic. Data from only four participants were
reported in McNicoll 2003. In Waites 2006 and Linsenmeyer
2014 investigators reported combined outcome data for partici-
pants with urethral and suprapubic catheters which made clini-
cally-relevant interpretation difficult.
The trials had small sample sizes (range 25 to 89), although num-
bers of participants who completed were far fewer (range 4 to 53).
The authors of one of the largest trials (Moore 2009) (N = 73; N
= 53 completed) proposed, based on their data, that a trial with at
least 400 participants per arm would be required to give adequate
power to detect a 20% difference in length of time each catheter
was in situ.
1. Any catheter washout versus no washout
Four trials addressed this comparison (Airaksinen 1979; McNicoll
2003; Moore 2009; Muncie 1989).
Symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI)
Moore 2009 reported no symptomatic UTIs in any study partici-
pants in the washout or non-washout groups (Analysis 1.1). Symp-
tomatic UTI was defined by Moore 2009 as the presence of at least
one of five indications: fever, urgency, dysuria or suprapubic ten-
derness, haematuria or positive urine culture. Self-reported UTIs
(which did not meet the study criteria for symptomatic UTI) were
noted in each group (citric acid 5/24, saline 2/18, no washout 3/
23, P not reported).
Number of catheters used
No data were reported.
Length of time each catheter in situ
Moore 2009 recorded the number of weeks until first catheter
change and reported no significant differences in the mean time
for the three groups: citric acid 4.57 (SD 2.61) (N = 19); saline
5.18 (SD 2.90) (N = 16); and no washout 4.55 (SD 2.91, N =
20) (P = 0.642; Analysis 1.2).
Catheter removal rates due to blockage or infection
The meancatheterreplacementrate per100daysof catheterisation
was reported by Muncie 1989: for the saline washout periods the
mean was 5.5 catheters replaced (n = 32 ), for the no washout
periods the mean was 4.7 catheters replaced (n = 32). Muncie 1989
also reported (saline washout/no washout) numbers of catheters
for each period: replaced due to obstruction (39/32); replaced due
to leakage (11/21); and removed out with the study protocol (87/
63). The study authors concluded that daily saline washouts had
no significant effect on the incidence of total number of catheter
replacements. No details of statistical tests were presented.
McNicoll 2003 reported on the mean number of catheter replace-
ments during a 12 week period: the citric acid washout group
mean was 9 (SD 0) (n = 1), the no-washout group mean was 14.3
(SD 11.2, n = 3; P not reported).
Airaksinen 1979 also compared different types of silicone
catheters. All participants received new catheters on day 0; partic-
ipants in both Silicath catheter groups had these replaced at three
months (as per manufacturers’ guidelines). Airaksinen 1979 stated
that in the Silicath catheter group with regular irrigation, 5/10
participants required a catheter change in the first three months
of the study compared to those with similar catheters who were
in the control group (no irrigation) in which 8/10 participants
required a catheter change (Analysis 1.3; stated P < 0.01). In the
silastic catheter intervention group 2/11 participants required a
catheter change compared with 2/9 participants in the silastic con-
trol group (Analysis 1.3; RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.31, P < 0.50;
1 study. 40 participants; very low quality evidence).
Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria
Given that catheter obstructions may be related to particular bac-
terial species, Muncie 1989 reported the mean number of species
at ≥10
CFU/mL per urine specimen for each group (N = 23
participants) who completed the cross-over trial. Urine specimens
were obtained for culture every two weeks. For the saline washout
periods the mean was 4.0, for the no washout periods the mean was
3.8. No test of statistical difference was reported. The four most
prevalent organisms were Providencia stuartii, Escherichia coli, P
mirabilis and Enterococcus spp. The percentage of specimens in
which each strain was present was similar in the saline washout
and no washout periods of the study.
Washout acceptability measures
No data were reported.
Health status or measures of psychological health
No data were reported.
Complications and adverse events
Muncie 1989 looked at episodes of high temperature with possible
urinary origin as a proxy for symptomatic UTI. Data were reported
for32participants(includingthose whodidnotcomplete the trial)
17
Washout policies in long-term indwelling urinary catheterisation in adults (Review)

 for combined phases of this cross-over trial. The mean number of
episodes of high temperature of possible urinary origin per 100
days of catheterisation for the three periods was reported: mean for
the saline washout period was 1.2 (SD 1.3), and for the no washout
period was 0.9 (SD 1.1). This was also reported separately for
each period of the study: period 1, irrigation versus none; period
2, irrigation versus none; and for all episodes of high temperature
(Analysis 1.4) as well as those of urinary origin (Analysis 1.5).
The study authors reported that the difference was not statistically
significant, although no details were given.
Health economic outcomes
McNicoll 2003 reported that 37.25 hours were spent adminis-
tering washouts over the 12 week period for one participant in
the intervention group. McNicoll 2003 reported that care for the
“planned catheter change” group took less time, but no compar-
ison data were presented. The cost of the intervention was GBP
975.51 for the participant in the washout group whose treatment
required over 37 hours of washout time compared to a mean GBP
189 (SD GBP 103) per person for the cost of care in the control
group. The price per year was not given.
2. One type of catheter washout solution versus
another
Four
trials
addressed
this
comparison
(Kennedy
1992;
Linsenmeyer 2014; Moore 2009; Waites 2006).
Symptomatic UTI
The rate of participants discontinuing the use of washouts due to
the development of a symptomatic UTI was reported by Waites
2006: saline 1/29 participants (3%), acetic acid 6/30 participants
(20%), and neomycin-polymyxin 4/30 participants (13%). The
difference between groups was not statistically significant (P =
0.15). Overall, a significantly greater proportion of acetic acid
group participants discontinued (P = 0.0005), but this difference
was due to more participants in this group discontinuing for “per-
sonal reasons unrelated to health”. Moore 2009 found no symp-
tomatic UTIs in any group in the trial using the citric acid or saline
solutions (Analysis 2.1).
Number of catheters used
No data were reported.
Length of time each catheter in situ
Kennedy 1992 reported mean days the catheter was in situ: saline
16.3 days, Suby G 14.3 days, Solution R 14.2 days. No standard
deviations were reported, but the study authors reported no signifi-
cant differences between groups (P not reported). It was noted that
only three participants retained their catheter for the full length
of each trial period. Moore 2009 reported the mean time until
first catheter change; there was no significant difference among
trial groups, including the two groups receiving different washout
solutions (citric acid versus saline, Analysis 2.2).
Catheter removal rates due to blockage or infection
In Kennedy 1992, 100 of 120 study catheters were examined for
encrustation. The number of catheters found to be blocked (de-
fined as the eye or lumen completely blocked resulting in no flow
of urine) when removed after each three week solution period was
reported: saline 18/44 catheters (41%), Suby G 14/29 catheters
(48%), Solution R 7/27 catheters (26%). The study authors con-
cluded that Solution R produced the best results and Suby G the
worst, but no statistical tests were presented, and a time effect was
noted such that blocked catheters would be removed early (before
they could be examined) thus distorting the data. Regarding de-
gree of visual encrustation, Kennedy 1992 reported little differ-
ence among the three solutions up to day 10, after which it was
felt Solution R did not reduce encrustation. Mean encrustation
scores were presented but without standard deviations. Similarly,
insufficient information was presented relating to the mean num-
ber of episodes of bypassing per week (saline 1.55, Suby G 1.4, So-
lution R 1.9), although the study authors reported that differences
among groups for this outcome were not statistically significant
(P value not reported).
Linsenmeyer 2014 compared auriclosene and saline washouts and
reported encrustation rates only for participants in this study (N
= 14). The area of encrustation (expressed as a percentage) within
the catheter was assessed at three pre-selected locations. The max-
imum encrustation in any part of the catheter was used to deter-
mine catheter patency and was the primary endpoint of this trial.
The auriclosene irrigation resulted in an average encrustation of
21.7% (95% CI 2.1% to 41.2%), versus 76.9% (95% CI 54.9%
to 98.8%) average encrustation with saline (P value not reported).
Linsenmeyer 2014 reported percentages of catheters removed for
clinical blockage and due to 100% encrustation. Of those irrigated
with the auriclosene solution, 14% had to be removed due to any
clinical blockage; none of these catheters were 100% encrusted.
By contrast, 64% of catheters irrigated with saline were removed
due to clinical blockage, and of these, all were completely blocked.
Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria
In the cross-over trial by Kennedy1992 comparing three solutions,
the percentage of participants with bacteria observed in washout
fluid at the end of a washout period with one of the trial solu-
tions were: saline 100%, Suby G 75%, Solution R 76%. Only
percentages were presented and the denominators were unclear
for these percentages. The presence of bacteria was also measured
in 66 urine specimens collected from 25 participants at the time
18

 of catheter change. Of these, four samples showed no significant
bacterial growth (3 after antibiotic treatment and 1 after saline
washouts). It was therefore concluded that none of the solutions
tested eliminated bacteria. The study authors stated that Suby
G and Solution R appeared to reduce levels of bacteria but that
differences were not statistically significant (statistical test results
were not presented). It was further concluded that treatment with
acidic solutions (Suby G and Solution R) did not prevent or re-
duce urease-producer bacteria. The published data on presence of
bacteria were inadequately reported.
The percentagesof participantsharbouringEnterococcus spp (alone
or in conjunction with other types of bacteria) after completing
the Waites 2006 trial were: saline 13/21 participants (62%), acetic
acid 7/9 participants (87%) and neomycin-polymyxin 19/22 par-
ticipants (86%). No test of significant difference between groups
was presented. In the antibiotic group, from study start to finish
there was a significant increase in the number of participants with
Enterococci spp bacteria (P = 0.02). Data were reported graphically;
exact values were not available. The study authors reported de-
tecting no advantages from the antibiotic or acidic solutions over
saline in reducing urinary bacterial load.
Washout acceptability measures
No data were reported.
Health status or measures of psychological health
No data were reported.
Measures of complications or adverse effects
Blood in the urine
The presence of blood in the urine may indicate damage caused by
the washout procedure. Kennedy 1992 reported the percentage of
participants in each group who had red blood cells in their washout
fluid at the end of each treatment period (saline 21%, Suby G
17%, Solution R 14%). Study authors also reported a significant
difference among treatment groups (P = 0.028) associated with a
higher red blood cell count in the Suby G group compared to other
groups. Moore 2009 reported results from urine dipstick testing,
and found that all participants, irrespective of group, exhibited
blood in the urine consistently.
Urothelial cells in the urine
Presence of urothelial cells in washout fluid at the end of each
treatment period was reported by Kennedy 1992: saline 100%,
Suby G 86%, Solution R 100%. Study authors reported finding
evidence of a significant difference among treatment groups for
urothelial cells over time (P = 0.068), but that this was unlikely to
be clinically significant.
Bladder spasms
Waites 2006 reported on the incidence of bladder spasms directly
attributable to bladder washout, which occurred on a small num-
ber of occasions (saline 0/29 participants, acetic acid 1/30 partic-
ipants, neomycin-polymyxin 2/30 participants). Bladder spasms
caused these participants to discontinue with washouts (P not re-
ported).
Health economic outcomes
No data were reported.
3. Clinically or microbiologically indicated washout
versus routine washout
No data were reported.
4. Long intervals between catheter washouts versus
short intervals
No data were reported.
5. One method of administration of catheter
washouts versus another method
No data were reported.
6. Smaller volumes of washout solution versus larger
volumes
No data were reported.
7. A stronger solution of washout versus a weaker
solution
Kennedy 1992 addressed this comparison in a cross-over trial.
Kennedy 1992 compared two acidic solutions with different com-
positions. The citric acid content of one solution (solution R, 6%)
was higher than the other (Suby G, 3.23%), however it was noted
that the other elements of the solutions also differed. Therefore,
any differences may not be attributable to the strength of the citric
acid solution.
Symptomatic UTI
No data were reported.

 Number of catheters used
No data were reported.
Length of time each catheter in situ
The meantime forcatheterinsituwas14.3days(SubyG)and 14.2

Catheter removal rates due to blockage or infection
The study authors concluded that Solution R performed better
than Suby G in terms of fewer blocked catheters (26% versus
48%, no significance test reported). The results presented did not
utilise the cross-over nature of the trial and were not informative
(Kennedy 1992).
Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria
Kennedy 1992 concluded there was no significant difference (P
not reported) between Suby G (containing 3.23% citric acid) and
Solution R (containing 6% citric acid) in terms of reducing the
level of bacteria in the urine.
Washout acceptability measures

 D I S C U S S I O N
There were insufficient data providing reliable evidence about the
benefit or harms of washout policies to prevent catheter block-
age or encrustation or for the relative merits of different washout
solutions. Given that it was not possible to obtain sufficient in-
formation for further interpretation or analysis of existing pub-
lished data from study authors, further high quality trials must
be considered to provide rigorous evidence relating to the use of
washouts. There are several important issues raised by this review
which have implications for future research in this area.
Summary of main results
We identified seven trials eligible for inclusion in this review relat-
ing to the use of washouts for people with long-term indwelling
catheters. Most trials were small and under powered with inade-
quate reporting to permit judgement. The studies reviewed con-
sisted of three randomised cross-over trials which had poor data re-
porting, three parallel group randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
with very limited data, and one well-designed, but potentially un-
der-powered, RCT. Of the nine primary and secondary outcome
measures sought, data were available for six. Trials assessed only
three of the eight intervention comparisons identified. Due to the
imprecision of the results of the included trials we are uncertain
if washouts have an important effect on the primary outcomes of
numbers of participants with symptomatic urinary tract infections
(UTIs) and length of time each catheter was in situ. Main results
are summarised in Summary of findings for the main comparison
and Summary of findings 2.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
None of the included trials addressed: number of catheters used,
washout acceptability measures (including patient satisfaction, pa-
tient discomfort, pain and ease of use), or health status/measures
of psychological health and very limited health economic data
were available. Any new policy regarding the management of long-
term urinary catheters with or without the use of washout solu-
tions must be shown to be favourable for these important out-
comes. As for the eight pre-identified washout comparisons, the
included trials provided data relating to only three (any catheter
washout solution versus no catheter washout; one type of catheter
washout solution versus another type; and a stronger washout so-
lution versus a weaker washout solution). No trials looked at dif-
ferent volumes of the same washout solution. Studies tended to
use the volume of solution provided in the manufacturer’s pre-pre-
pared containers. Volumes ranged from 10 mL (Airaksinen 1979)
to 100 mL (Kennedy 1992). None of the trials compared dif-
ferent washout frequencies. However, washout frequency varied:
twice daily (Waites 2006), daily (McNicoll 2003; Muncie 1989),
twice weekly (Linsenmeyer 2014; Waites 2006), weekly (Moore
2009), and every two weeks (Airaksinen 1979). The length of
time the washout was retained in the bladder ranged from 15
minutes (Linsenmeyer 2014; Moore 2009) to 20 to 30 minutes
(Kennedy 1992)), as did the duration of the intervention from 3
weeks (Kennedy 1992) to 26 weeks (Airaksinen 1979).
It is important that a washout period is used in cross-over tri-
als where there is potential for a carry-over effect from one treat-
ment period to the next. Both included cross-over trials used
this approach; Muncie 1989 used a two-week phase between trial
periods with no intervention, and Kennedy 1992 used a one-
week phase during which participants had a saline washout. Both
Muncie 1989 and Kennedy 1992 also used run-in periods of two
weeks of no washout and one week of saline washout respectively.
Linsenmeyer 2014 stated that a washout period was used between
different solutions but the timing was not provided. No reason
was given for length of the run-in or washout periods.
Included trials’ participants varied in several ways. In some trials
participants had histories of blocked catheters (Linsenmeyer 2014;
McNicoll 2003; Moore 2009); other trials did not limit participa-
tion in this way, or did not mention any history of catheter block-
ing. There may be merit in looking specifically at those people
with a history of catheter blocking; anecdotally, it is thought that
some people are more susceptible than others.
The participant characteristics and settings varied in the trials.
Kennedy 1992 and Muncie 1989 studied older women (mean ages
82 years and 71 years, respectively) who were inpatients in long-
term or geriatric care settings compared to community-dwelling
men and women with neurogenic bladder studied by Waites 2006
(mean age 45.8 years) and Linsenmeyer 2014 (mean age 46.6
years). Moore 2009 and Airaksinen 1979 studied a mix of long-
term or hospital care and home care participants. No information
onage andgenderwasavailable forMcNicoll 2003. The effectsof a
washout, if any, may differ in such diverse populations and careful
thought is needed regarding whether such trials results could be
usefully compared in future reviews.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the trials and their reporting was generally inade-
quate. All the trials had small sample sizes; overall 349 participants
were randomised and 217 completed the studies. The randomi-
sation sequence of participants was clearly described in only two
trials (Kennedy 1992; Moore 2009) and unclear in five. Conceal-
ment of group allocation was poor or inadequately described in all
but one trial (Moore 2009). Three trials were deemed at high risk
of bias for lack of blinding (McNicoll 2003; Moore 2009; Muncie
1989). However, depending on the washout regimen, blinding
of participants or the health professional to the intervention may
have been impossible. In regard to detection bias, the seven studies
did not describe accurately the methods of detecting outcomes;
therefore, all were assessed as unclear risk of bias. We assessed four
23

 trials (Kennedy 1992; Moore 2009; Muncie 1989; Waites 2006)
to be at low risk of attrition bias. Three lacked detail and were
judged to be an unclear bias (Airaksinen 1979; Linsenmeyer 2014;
McNicoll 2003).
The included trials were somewhat heterogeneous in terms of the
outcomes measured. Most trials assessed bacteriuria, and block-
age/encrustation, although methods for doing so and definitions
used varied greatly. Definitions of symptomatic UTI in particu-
lar were poorly described and differed among trials. Standardised
methods for assessing these key outcomes in catheter research are
needed. There was a consistent lack of adequate reporting of sta-
tistical information e.g. denominators for percentages, summary
statistics such as standard deviations and details of statistical tests.
This made interpreting the study results difficult, and extracting
the data impossible in many cases. The methods used by study
authors to analyse data from the cross-over trials were referenced
and seemed appropriate, taking into account the paired nature of
the data. However, the reporting of these analyses in the reports
was poor and assessment of the findings and data extraction were
not possible.
Potential biases in the review process
We searched all relevant databases without language restriction to
obtain as many reports of trials as possible. We also included trial
registries in this search and contacted authors for further infor-
mation about trials that were reported as completed, where appli-
cable. However, despite these attempts to minimise publication
bias it is possible that not all eligible trials were included in the
databases that we searched. To reduce the risk of bias during the re-
view process, we used the methodology described in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011),
this included two authors screening the literature search results for
potentially eligible studies and double data extraction.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Guideline
for prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI)
was updated in 2009 due to an increasing focus on the non-acute
setting and patients in need of long-term urinary catheterisation.
The Guideline considered the best practices for preventing CAUTI
associated with obstructed urinary catheters and concluded that
no recommendation could be given for the use of irrigation solu-
tions because the evidence was not available to answer the ques-
tion. Many of the studies referred to by Gould 2010 considered
patients who used intermittent catheterisation and therefore were
not included in this review because they did not match our in-
clusion criteria. The findings of Gould 2010 agree with findings
from this review and provide further support for the need for high
quality trials in this area. No other systematic reviews of catheter
washout solutions were found.

Implications for practice
There is currently insufficient evidence from randomised con-
trolled trials (RCTs) to guide clinical practice regarding all as-
pects of using washouts for long-term indwelling catheters. It is
unknown if washouts convey any benefits or harms for patients
using indwelling catheters in the long-term. We found very little
evidence on economic outcomes associated with managing long-
term indwelling catheter use.
Implications for research
There is a need for a large RCT with rigorous methods which will
determine the optimal policies to prevent or relieve catheter block-
age. This trial would initially include a ’no washout’ arm as there
is first a need for evidence regarding whether catheter washouts
compared to no washout are beneficial. Objective measures of
catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) and blockage
including length of time catheter in situ, catheter removal rates,
and number of catheters used would be key outcome measures.
Washout acceptability (patient discomfort, satisfaction, pain), and
psychological health (quality of life) using validated tools must
also be considered. Health economic analysis associated with dif-
ferent washout regimens must also be reported. Other variables
that may influence outcome, and which should be allowed for
in the design of a future trial, include baseline characteristics of
urine (e.g. acidity), condition of patient dictating the need for in-
dwelling catheterisation, and the patient’s fluid intake. We would
also suggest that long-term follow up is needed; this would pro-
vide very valuable evidence. Given the difficulty experienced in
previous trials in recruiting and retaining participants, it may be
sensible to standardise the different types of catheters in future tri-
als to maximise the chances of detecting any differences between
groups.
With one exception (Waites 2006), the washout procedure was
undertaken by a healthcare professional in the included studies.
After the first washout Waites 2006 gave pre-prepared solutions to
the participant to use at home. This is an interesting, and poten-
tially cost-saving, approach to catheter care which may be appro-
priate for certain patient groups, and could perhaps be the subject
of a future trial.
Most trials assessed bacteriuria, symptomatic urinary tract infec-
tions (UTIs) and blockage/encrustation, although methods for do-
ing so and definitions used varied. Standardised methods for as-
sessing these key outcomes in catheter research are needed. There

 was a consistent lack of adequate reporting of statistical informa-
tion e.g. denominators for percentages, summary statistics such as
standard deviations and details of statistical tests. This made inter-
preting the study results difficult, and extracting the data impossi-
ble in many cases. The methods used by study authors to analyse
data from the cross-over trials were referenced and seemed appro-
priate, taking into account the paired nature of the data. However,
the reporting of these analyses in the reports was poor and assess-
ment of the findings and data extraction were not possible.

Participants
Inclusion criteria: Elderly women in long-term geriatric care with long-term catheter
in situ
Setting: 3 geriatric hospitals
Country: UK
Health status: Not stated
Number: 25 entered trial. 11 women lost to follow up (5 died, 3 catheters removed, 2
withdrawn by nursing staff, 1 discharged). 14 women completed full 12 weeks of trial
Age: mean age 82 years, range 65 years to 100 years
Sex: Female
Other relevant Information: Catheter type and material not stated (type patient already
wearing used); median duration catheter in situ at start of study: 12 months (range 1
month to 204 months)
Exclusion criteria: no exclusion criteria stated
Interventions
Intervention: Cross-over study of 3 washout treatments
Group A: 3 weeks of twice weekly 0.9% sodium chloride washout
Group B: 3 weeks of twice weekly Suby G washout (citric acid 3.23%, light magnesium
oxide 0.38%, sodium bicarbonate 0.7%, and disodium edetate 0.01%)
Group C: 3 weeks of twice weekly Solution R washout (citric acid 6%, gluconolactone
0.6%, light magnesium carbonate 2.8%, disodium edetate 0.01%)
Other relevant information: Each washout administered by attaching 100 mL sterile
pre-packed sachet to catheter and allowing to drain into bladder via gravity, clamped for
20 minutes to 30 minutes and then allowed to drain out. Catheters changed at weeks 1,
5, 9 and 12
Outcomes
• Bacteriuria: patients with bacteria observed in washout fluid at end of washout
period: A 100%, B 75%, C 76% (insufficient data presentation); conclusion was that
treatment with acidic solutions did not prevent or reduce urease-producers
• Catheter blockage (definition of blocked catheter: eyes or lumen completely
blocked, resulting in no flow of urine, definition of partially blocked catheter: still able
to allow urine drainage): blocked catheters: A 18/44, B 14/29, C 7/27, partially
blocked catheters: A 14/44, B 12/29, C 10/27, non-encrusted catheters: A 12/44, B 3/
29, C 10/27 (in each case denominator = no. of catheters)
• Degree of visual encrustation: little difference between 3 treatments up to day 10,
after which Solution R did not reduce encrustation (insufficient data presentation)
• Mean episodes of bypassing per week: A 1.55, B 1.4, C 1.9 (insufficient data
presentation); differences not statistically significant
• Catheter removal/replacement: mean days catheter in situ: A 16.3, B 14.3, C 14.2
(insufficient data presentation); no significant differences between groups; only 3
patients retained catheter for full length of each trial period
• Patients with red blood cells in washout fluid at end of washout period: A 21%, B
17%, C 14% (insufficient data presentation), higher counts during treatment B
• Patients with urothelial cells in washout fluid at end of washout period: A 100%,
B 86%, C 100% (insufficient data presentation), some evidence of a significant
difference in the changes over time within the 3 treatments (Chi² (14) = 22.5, P = 0.
068) but proportions all consistently high thus unlikely to be clinically significant
Other outcomes reported (not analysed within this review):
• 1 patient developed haematuria following treatment with solution C
• Type and volume of crystals observed in washout fluid: significantly more crystals

found during saline washouts than during acidic solutions (Chi² (2) = 29.06, P < 0.
001); struvite appeared significantly more often in the saline washouts than in the Suby
G and Solution R washouts (Chi² (2) = 22.075, P < 0.001); uric acid crystals appeared

Participants
Inclusion criteria: Aged 18 years and older, spinal cord injury or other neurogenic blad-
der patient requiring a chronic indwelling urinary catheter with a history of 2 episodes
of catheter blockage and/or encrustation, and urine pH ≥ 6.5
Setting: Not stated
Country: USA
Health status: Not stated
Number: 7 participants: Part 1 N = 20, Part 2 N = 28, Part 3 N = 19
Age: Age of total group (N = 67 years) mean 46.6 years (range = 21 years to 81 years)
Sex: male N = 50 (75%)
Other relevant Information: Catheter type: transurethral N = 34 (51%), suprapubic
N = 33 (49%)
Exclusion criteria: Antibiotics within 7 days, current infections, recent history of auto-
nomic dysreflexia
Interventions
• Part 1: 0.2% auriclosene in preliminary formulation dosed over 2 weeks (3 times/
week), Part 2: auriclosene dosed on same schedule as part 1, Part 3: auriclosene dosed
for 4 weeks (2 times/week). The control for all parts was 0.9% w/v saline
• Participants randomised to one irrigation solution for the first treatment regimen
and after a washout period, irrigated with the other solution. A single treatment
consisted of 2 sequential irrigations of 25 mL retained in the catheter for 15 minutes
Outcomes
Results are given from Part 3 of the study (N = 14 completed) only:
• Mean % encrustation ’catheter patency’ (95% CI): Auriclosene group 21.7 (2.1,
41.2), Saline group 76.9 (54.9, 98.8). Catheter luminal encrustations documented by
computerised microscopic assessment
• Percent of catheters removed for clinical blockage: Auriclosene group 14.3%,

• Numbers of participants completing parts 1, 2 and 3 were 14, 20 and 14
respectively
• Further details of this study were found from the Clinical trials document
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01243125) and the pharmaceutical company responsible for
the trial. Where appropriate, data has been used from these documents to augment the
Linsenmeyer 2014 abstract.
• Unclear how the data were analysed and whether analysis was appropriate for
cross-over trial design. Implied that the degree of encrustation data were analysed by
group (i.e. all catheters after auriclosene vs all catheters after saline), and also within
subject (i.e. paired analysis comparing each individual’s encrustation after auriclosene
and after saline)

years, control group mean 68.56 years)
Sex (m/f): 36/37
Exclusion criteria: Symptomatic UTI (individuals were eligible for the study following
successful treatment of the UTI after a symptom-free period of 14 days); urethral erosion
allowing continuous bypassing (leakage) around urinary catheter; history of bladder
cancer, or radiation or interstitial cystitis; impaired renal function as evidenced by a
serum creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL or higher; gross haematuria; or indwelling catheter
that was changed less frequently than every 8 weeks
Interventions
• Group A: 8 weeks of usual care, no washout (control)
• Group B: 8 weeks of weekly washout with 50 mL sterile normal saline washout
• Group C: 8 weeks of weekly washout with 50 mL sterile Contisol solution
(containing citric acid 3.23%, light magnesium oxide 0.38%, sodium bicarbonate 0.
7%, and disodium edetate 0.01%)
Outcomes
• Mean time to first catheter change: Contisol 4.57 (SD 2.61) (N = 19), saline 5.18
(SD 2.90) (N = 16), no washout 4.55 (SD 2.91) (N = 20)
• Incidence of symptomatic UTI (defined as at least one of five indications with no
other recognised cause: fever ≥ 38 degrees C, urgency, dysuria or suprapubic
tenderness, haematuria or positive urine culture (≥ 100,000 micro-organisms per cc of
urine with no more than two species of microorganisms). None were detected in any
group: Contisol 0/17, saline 0/16, control 0/20.
• Incidence of microscopic haematuria. All participants had haematuria consistently
(no data provided).
• Incidence of microscopic leukocytes. All participants had haematuria consistently
(no data provided).
• Urine pH: mean pH 6.3 (SD 1.04) (range 5 to 8.5), not reported for groups
• Measurement of cross sectional catheter lumen. slicing of first 50 catheters
supported the theory that biofilm or encrustations begins at the catheter tip, first at the
eyes, proceeding down the shaft. % of catheters with encrustation was low and the
majority were obstructed with thick biofilm
Notes
Funding source: Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research and the Canadian
Nurses Foundation
• Cross sectional measurement of catheter was abandoned as the method did not
prove useful for comparing effectiveness of washouts
• Data on all available patients was included in the Kaplan Meier analysis of time to
first catheter change (with censoring when an individual withdrew, died, had a UTI
treated with antibiotics, etc), however results on mean time to first catheter change are
based on data for those who completed the trial only
• Authors gave reviewers access to data for further analysis

Appendix 1. Search strategies for 2017 review update
The Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register was searched using the Group’s own keyword system. The search terms used were:
({design.cct*} OR {design.rct*})
AND
({intvent.mech.cath.washout*}
OR
{intvent.mech.cath.irrigation*}
OR
{intvent.prevent.cath*}
OR
{INTVENT.MECH.CATH.MaintenanceSolutions*})
(All searches were of the keyword field of Reference Manager 2012)
Appendix 2. Search strategies used for 2010 review
For the first published version of this review (Hagen 2010) we searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Trials Register (searched
30 April 2009), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2009), MEDLINE In-Process (30 April 2009), EMBASE (January 1980 to April
2009) and CINAHL (December 1981 to April 2009). Additionally, we examined all reference lists of identified trials and contacted
manufacturers and researchers in the field.
The Incontinence Group Specialised Register was searched using the Group’s own keyword system. The search terms used were:
({design.cct*} OR {design.rct*})
AND
({intvent.mech.cath.washout*} OR {intvent.mech.cath.irrigation*} OR {intvent.prevent.cath*})
(All searches were of the keyword field of Reference Manager 9.5 N, ISI ResearchSoft).
For this first version of the review specific extra searches were performed by the review authors (Hagen 2010). These are detailed below:
• MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2009),
• MEDLINE In-Process (searched on 30 April 2009),
• EMBASE (January 1980 to Week 17 2009) was searched on 27 April 2009,
• CINAHL on OVID (1982 to July Week 1 2007) was searched on 18 July 2007,
• CINAHL on EBSCO (December 1981 to Week 4 April 2009) was searched on 28 April 2009.
These databaseswere searchedbythe reviewauthorsusingappropriate free textand MeSHterms/EMTREEterms/controlledvocabulary.
This was done by adapting terms drawn from the existing search strategies of the Cochrane Incontinence group to meet the objectives
of this review. Full details of the search terms used are given below:

This set of terms was combined with the Cochrane suggested search strategy for identifying reports of randomised controlled trials in
EMBASE (available via OVID on the NHS eLibrary) using the Boolean operator ’AND’. An optimal strategy for EMBASE has not
yet been tested and formally approved. However, the suggested strategy has been employed in searches for the Cochrane collaboration.
The UK National Research Register, Controlled Clinical Trials and ZETOC database of conference abstracts were searched on 17
October 2006 using various combinations of the following search terms: catheter, bladder, washout, maintenance, solution, irrigation,
instillation, care, infection, bacteriuria, encrustation, blockage, occlusion, crystallisation, anti-infective agents, anti-bacterial agents.
Searching other resources
We placed calls for information about other possibly relevant trials on the Association for Continence Advice (ACA) website (March
2007), the ACA quarterly Journal (Volume 26 Issue 2 2007), and the weekly Update of Royal College of Nursing Research &
Development Co-ordinating Centre electronic bulletin (W/C 26 March 2007). Presentations were given at the 2007 RCN International
Nursing Research Conference (April 2007), the 22nd Annual Scottish Task Force Symposium on Incontinence (May 2007) and the
Scottish NMAHP Research into Practice Conference (October 2007) to inform others of this review and invite information on other
possibly relevant studies.

For the 2017 update of the review there was no additional searching of databases other than the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised
Register as this now includes relevant searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE,
MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and UK Clinical Research
Network Portfolio. Cochrane now organises centralised searches of Embase (including conference abstracts) that are included in
CENTRAL so no additional Embase searches were performed. We continued to search the reference lists of relevant articles. The order
of primary outcomes presented in the review has changed from the 2010 version following editors’ advice.
