Abstract
Background: Comfort is frequently ranked important for a good death. Although rising numbers of people are dying
in very old age, many with dementia, little is known about symptom control for “older old” people or whether care in
different settings enables them to die comfortably. This study aims to examine, in a population-representative sample,
associations between factors potentially related to reported comfort during very old people’s final illness: physical and
cognitive disability, place of care and transitions in their final illness, and place of death.
Methods: Retrospective analyses linked three data sources for n = 180 deceased study participants (68% women) aged
79–107 in a representative population-based UK study, the Cambridge City over-75s Cohort (CC75C):
i) prospective in-vivo dementia diagnoses and cognitive assessments,
ii) certified place of death records,
iii) data from interviews with relatives/close carers including symptoms and “How comfortable was he/she in his/her
final illness?”
Results: In the last year of life 83% were disabled in basic activities, 37% had moderate/severe dementia and 45%
minimal/mild dementia or cognitive impairment. Regardless of dementia/cognitive status, three-quarters died
following a final illness lasting a week or longer. 37%, 44%, 13% and 7% of the deceased were described as having
been “very comfortable”, “comfortable”, “fairly comfortable” or “uncomfortable” respectively during their final illness, but
reported symptoms were common: distress, pain, depression and delirium or confusion each affected 40–50%. For only
10% were no symptoms reported. There were ≥4-fold increased odds of dying comfortably associated with being in a
care home during the final illness, dying in a care home, and with staying in place (dying at what death certificates
record as “usual address”), whether home or care home, compared with hospital, but no significant association with
disability or dementia/cognitive status, regardless of adjustment.

Conclusions: These findings are consistent with reports that care homes can provide care akin to hospice for the very
old and support an approach of supporting residents to stay in their care home or own home if possible. Findings on
reported high prevalence of multiple symptoms can inform policy and training to improve older old people’s end-of-life
care in all settings.

Background
Increasing longevity means more people are dying at
increasingly
older
ages,
often
with
multiple
co-
morbidities complicating their end-of-life care [1, 2].
In the UK, for example, over just the last quarter
century the proportion of deaths occurring at the age
of 85 or older has risen steeply from around a fifth
in 1990 to almost half current annual deaths [3]. De-
mentia prevalence rises with proximity to death, over
and
above
age-associated
increases
[4].
Multiple
symptoms are common amongst older people with
dementia as they approach the end of life and poor
symptom control may increase distress and worsen
quality of life [5]. Past research in both hospital and
long-term care settings has highlighted concerns that
failure to recognise dementia as a terminal condition
and communication breakdown may both contribute
to poor symptom management [5, 6]. Variation in
levels of symptom control for all older people dying
in different care settings, with or without dementia, is
an important concern. [7, 8] Comfort and effective
symptom
management
feature
high
in
patients’
[9–13], relatives’ [14, 15] and professionals’ [16] per-
ceptions concerning what factors are important for a
good death. In a study of advance care planning
amongst older adults 92% of patients prioritised com-
fort [17].
Most people taking part in surveys about their fu-
ture wishes [18–20] or reporting what they believe
their relatives wanted [7, 21] state a preference to die
at home, if expressed at all. These widely quoted
findings may not be representative [22], nor reflect
how views can vary with proximity to death [20, 23,
24] and personal circumstances [25, 26]. Although
policy encourages support for patients to die wher-
ever they would prefer [27, 28], dying at home is a
more measurable outcome than death in preferred
place of care so is often taken as a surrogate indicator
of end-of-life care supporting choice [29, 30]. However, a
minority of the oldest old people die in their own
homes [8, 31–33] and indeed research shows that
many older people anticipate preferring to be cared
for elsewhere in the final illness [18, 19, 25, 26, 34].
In the UK fewer older people die in hospices or re-
ceive specialist palliative care at home than younger
age-groups [35–38] and the trend for older deaths is
gradually moving away from death in hospital towards
long-term care facilities [39, 40].
For older people in many countries care transitions
are common during the last weeks [41], months [42, 43]
or year [31] of life. Those with cognitive impairment are
most likely to live in and subsequently die in care homes
[44, 45], while those with no or mild cognitive impair-
ment are more likely to live at home in the community
and then be admitted into acute facilities during the
terminal phase [32]. As well as cognitive status, other
factors have been reported to influence transitions such
as gender, affluence of area and diagnosis [39, 46, 47]. In
studies that analysed causes of transitions a common
theme was that uncertain diagnosis, less skilled members
of staff, communication difficulties and needing to
access out of hours services made hospital admission
more likely [43, 48–50].
Transitions towards the end of life can be burdensome
and may not be associated with symptom improvement
nor with better quality end-of-life care. They may result in
exclusion of the main carer and a disjointed experience of
the health service [51], even leading to adverse events in
drug prescription [52]. Admission to hospital at the end of
life is also associated with greater cost [53–55]: UK health
service spending exceeding £750 m a year on emergency
admissions ending in death [27], and evidence suggests
hospitalisation for patients with severe dementia is not
cost effective [56].
There are several gaps in the literature concerning
comfort at the end of life amongst older old people.
Although there is extensive research concerning their
preferred place of care, few studies have compared end-
of-life care across different settings and there is little
evidence to support the commonly-held view that transi-
tions have a negative effect on quality of end-of-life care.
Few studies have been able to link individual-level data
including dementia or cognitive status prospectively
assessed before death with information on where and
how dying individuals were cared for. This study has
achieved this, examining in a population-representative

 sample
the
associations
between
factors
potentially
related to reported comfort during the final illness of
very old people – in particular, their cognitive and phys-
ical disability, the setting where they were cared for in
their final illness, and where they died.
Methods
Analyses of data from a prospective population-based
study of ageing in which almost all respondents have died,
the Cambridge City over-75s Cohort (CC75C) study [57],
linked i) in vivo dementia diagnoses and cognitive assess-
ments with ii) certified place of death records and iii) data
from interviews with bereaved relatives or other closely
involved carers (“informants”) for the maximum sub-
sample with all three data sources (n = 180). The CC75C
study [58] has followed up 2166 men and women aged at
least 75 at baseline (1985–87) enrolled through general
practices (95% response rate) in Cambridge, UK, with
surveys every few years until death (all deceased by
December 2015). The study remained highly representa-
tive of the older old population, with mortality the main
reason for attrition.
Cognitive assessment
Each survey wave has included a detailed cognitive
assessment, including the Mini Mental State Examin-
ation (MMSE) [59]. Almost half the cohort (n = 1022)
had further in-depth investigation at least once following
Surveys 1–3: the Cambridge Mental Disorders of the
Elderly Examination (CAMDEX) [60], a psychiatrist-
administered interview schedule for the diagnosis of
dementia.
After death, a consensus diagnosis of dementia status
at death consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders version 4 (DSM-IV) [61]
criteria was made by two clinicians experienced in old
age psychiatry. This diagnosis was based on review of all
available
information
including
survey
data,
proxy
informant data, general practitioner (GP) confirmation
of dementia diagnosis, death certificates and data from
retrospective informant interviews after participants had
died [62].
Definition of dementia status
“Dementia status” was categorized in three categories: “no
cognitive impairment – no dementia”, “cognitive impair-
ment - minimal/mild dementia” and “moderate/severe de-
mentia”. Participants who had undergone CAMDEX
assessments less than a year before death or clinical diag-
nosis at death were assigned to these categories according
to dementia severity ratings. Those whose death certificate
recorded dementia were assumed to have moderate/severe
dementia. Participants who had no confirmed dementia
status were categorized on the basis of severity of
cognitive impairment as measured by MMSE less than
two years before death: no dementia – no cognitive im-
pairment (26–30), cognitive impairment – minimal/mild
dementia (18–25) and moderate/severe dementia (0–17).
Reported symptoms and comfort
For participants who joined the study’s brain donor
programme, or another sub-study, a retrospective inter-
view after their death with a close relative or carer
collected information on the period between the partici-
pant’s last interview and death (n = 290). Funding limita-
tions meant only informants for these participants were
approached (81% response rate) and for a minority
approaches
to
request
interview
were
missed
but
followed-up later (n = 10 more than ten years after the
participant died). This included the CAMDEX informant
interview schedule and questions about the participant’s
care at the end of their life [63]. Questions included
“Overall, how comfortable was s/he during the final
illness?” (very/fairly comfortable, somewhat/very uncom-
fortable), “Did s/he suffer any of the following symptoms
during his/her final illness?” (see Results for symptom
list) and “If YES to any of these, was treatment given for
this problem and how effective was it?” (free text
responses categorised “Yes”, “Somewhat”, “No” or “Un-
known”). Informants were asked for their estimate of
duration of what they considered the “final illness”
(≤1 week, 1 week to 1 month, >1 month).
Analyses
The analysed sample (n = 180) was all participants with
retrospective informant interviews providing data on
comfort in their final illness, excluding participants of
unknown dementia status whose last cognitive assess-
ment was two or more years before they died. Descrip-
tive analyses summarised participant and informant
characteristics, the prevalence of reported symptoms,
treatment and effectiveness for these symptoms, and
reported comfort in the final illness. Logistic regression
examined the relationship between being described as
comfortable (four responses dichotomised comfortable/
uncomfortable) in the final illness and each potentially
related factor. Factors identified as significantly associated
with comfort in univariate analyses (p < 0.05) and demen-
tia status, which was hypothesised a priori to be a relevant
factor, were separately entered in regression analyses
adjusting for each of these factors individually. The extent
of correlations between factors found to be significant in
univariate regression, and between these and dementia
status, were explored using descriptive bivariate cross-
tabulations. Sample size, the number of factors of interest
and
their
strong
inter-dependence
meant
multiple
regression was inappropriate. All statistical and descriptive
analyses were performed using the statistical package

Patient involvement
When the CC75C study began in the mid-1980s there
was no patient involvement. Participants and their rela-
tives have been included in dissemination of the cohort
study’s findings through annual newsletters until the last
participant died in 2015. The broad public involvement
in the James Lind Alliance Palliative and End of Life
Care Priority Setting Partnership [64] helped inform
research questions for the study here reported.
Ethical approval
Each stage of the CC75C study has been approved by
the local Research Ethics Committee.
Results
Characteristics of the study participants
The sample for this analysis was all 180 cohort partici-
pants (57 men, 123 women) for whom dementia status
was defined and informant data were available reporting
symptoms and how comfortable they were in their final
illness (see Fig. 1). Table 1 shows the deceased study
participants’ characteristics, overall and by dementia
status.
Over a third of individuals (37%) were assessed as
having
“moderate/severe
dementia”,
45%
as
having
“cognitive impairment – minimal/mild dementia” and
18% as having “no dementia - no cognitive impairment”
when last interviewed. The age at time of death across
all groups ranged from 79 to 107 years, (median [IQR]
91.3
[87.5–94.4]).
Participants
without
dementia
or
cognitive impairment were younger at death than those
with moderate/severe dementia (median [IQR] 89.7
[87.1–92.0], 92.3 [88.5–95.7] respectively). There were
more women than men (68%, 32% respectively), espe-
cially amongst the individuals with any severity of
dementia and/or cognitive impairment, and two-thirds
had been widowed (68%). Demographics and distribu-
tions of cognition and dementia status in the analysis
sample reflected those in the full cohort.
Participants with ‘no cognitive impairment – no de-
mentia’ or with “cognitive impairment – minimal/mild
dementia” were mainly living at home when last inter-
viewed (94%, 90% respectively), compared with only 45%
those with moderate/severe dementia. The majority of
community-dwelling participants at home lived alone
(61%) and received service support at least once a week
when last interviewed (66%). Nearly all the participants
had disabilities in both instrumental and basic activities
in daily living (83%), ranging from 64% to 97% across
categories of increasing dementia severity. For about
three-quarters of the participants the duration of their
final illness was reported to be longer than six days,
regardless of dementia status.
There were marked differences in the older adults’
place of care during their final illness and their place of
death depending on their dementia status. Although
fewer than half the participants had been admitted to a
hospital since they were last interviewed, hospital was
the most common place of end-of-life care and death for
individuals in the unimpaired or intermediate groups.
For those with “moderate/severe dementia” long-term
care was the most likely setting for both end-of-life care
(76%) and death (76%), although about one in six had

cohort, analysed data from the branch study in which for approximately one in ten of the full cohort, by design, proxy informant interviews were
conducted after participants died. Participants were excluded if their dementia / cognitive status by the time they died was unknown or if retrospective
informant interview questions on their level of comfort and symptoms experienced during their final illness had missing data

 received hospital care during their final illness and a fifth
had died in hospital. Very few of this group had received
community end-of-life care or died at home (8% and 5%
respectively).
Overall, the majority had experienced a change in
residence or care in the period prior to death (the “usual
address” recorded on their death certificate differed from
their place of death), though this was far less common
for people with moderate/severe dementia (35%) than
for the cognitively unimpaired (79%).
The median time from the last study interview until a
participant’s death was 1.8 years (IQR 1–2.8), with a
slightly longer duration amongst participants with “mod-
erate/severe dementia”.
The
analysis
sample
broadly
reflected
the
full
representative cohort’s demographics, with very similar
distributions by sex, education level and social class, but
they were just over a year older at death (91.1 versus
89.9 years), more likely to be widowed (68% versus 56%)
and more likely living in care (26% versus 16%). Disabil-
ity levels were higher in our sample but the distribution
of known dementia status and cognition were similar.
Characteristics of the retrospective interview informants
Most informants were relatives of the participants (86%,
of whom nearly two-thirds were sons or daughters) and
68% were women (see Table 2). Most had been in regu-
lar contact with the participants, seeing them more than
once a week (84%). For 17% of participants who died in
long-term care the only available informant was a
member of staff in the care home. The median time

view was 2.3 years (IQR 1.3–3.7 years; range 1 month to

Reported symptoms in the final illness
Informants were asked whether the study participant
suffered any of a list of seven symptoms in their final
illness. The distribution of symptoms reported (Fig. 2a)
varied for older people of different cognitive status
(Fig. 2b); both figures show firm reports and cases
when informants were unsure whether or not a symp-
tom was experienced (responses “Yes” and “Don’t
know”). Apart from expected high rates of “delirium and
confusion” amongst those with moderate/severe dementia,
pain and distress were the most commonly reported
symptoms. Informants were most unsure whether or not
the participant had suffered from depression. For only n =
18 (10%) were none of these symptoms reported, and for
a further n = 7 (4%) informants were unsure whether the
participant had suffered any of these symptoms. A quarter
were reported to have experienced just one symptom, but
the majority (61%) reportedly suffered at least two
symptoms and 42% three or more. Figure 3 illustrates for
the full sample the complex overlap of symptoms, show-
ing only symptoms reported as “Yes”.
Figure 4 illustrates what percentage of the people who
were reported to have had pain (n = 73, 41%), depression
(n = 51, 29%) and pressure sores (n = 29, 16%) were also
reported to have had treatment for these and, of these
treated, for what percentage treatment was reported to
have been effective. For example, of the 41% reported to
have had pain 78% reportedly had pain-relieving treat-
ment, for whom informants reported 53% found this
effective, i.e. only 41% of those in pain were thought to
have had adequate pain relief (53% of 78%). Informants
were frequently uncertain as to whether these symptoms
were experienced, treated and, if so, whether symptoms
were relieved. This was particularly so for depression
and pressure sores.
Reported comfort in the final illness
“How comfortable was s/he in his/her final illness”
was answered positively by the majority of infor-
mants: 37% described the deceased older person as
having been “very comfortable”, 44% “comfortable”,
13% “somewhat uncomfortable” and 7% “very un-
comfortable”. These high proportions reported as
comfortable included many with symptoms as de-
scribed above, with informants reporting effective
treatment more often for those rated comfortable
than for those rated uncomfortable (60% versus 44%,
non-significant difference, p = 0.2, in the small sub-
sample reported to have received symptom treat-
ment: n = 67). Informants for individuals in the more
severe cognitive impairment group were more likely
uncertain whether any treatment given was effective
than for the cognitively intact (25% and 8% respect-
ively, p = 0.6) and less likely to report treatment as
effective (52% and 75% respectively, p = 0.3). None-
theless,
the
most
cognitively
impaired
individuals
were most likely to be rated comfortable (respect-
ively 76%, 75% and 89% of each dementia status cat-
egory, p = 0.07), a finding consistent with the high
prevalence of reported comfort for those whose end-
of-life care was in long-term care (see Table 3).
Table 3 shows the distribution of reported comfort
in the final illness across categories of each descriptive
characteristic and gives the unadjusted odds ratio (OR)
for reportedly having been comfortable associated with
each factor. Compared with care or death in hospital,
there was at least a 4-fold increased odds of dying
comfortably associated with being in a care home dur-
ing the final illness, with dying in a care home, with
staying in place in a care home (i.e. when a care home
was the location for both end-of-life care and death)
and dying at the participant’s “usual address” (home or

 care home). Although people who died at home or in
long-term
care
were
similarly
commonly
reported
comfortable (89% and 91%, versus 69% for hospital
deaths), there were too few deaths at home for the as-
sociation between dying at home and comfort to reach
significance: OR 3.7 (95% CI 0.8–17.4). People with
home or hospital care in the final illness were equally
commonly
reported
comfortable
(both
73%,
versus
92% in long-term care). However, compared with those
who were cared for in hospital until death, the odds of
dying comfortably were just significantly lower for those
who died in hospital after having been cared for at home:
OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.09–0.98). Those who were living at
home when last surveyed, needing no support from for-
mal services or needing support only once a week, had a
3-fold increased odds of a comfortable death compared
with those needing support twice a week or more.
Adjusting for the covariates found significant in univari-
ate analyses had minimal impact on most associations
with reported comfort, but reduced effect sizes and
significance for some most closely inter-related factors,
though not all (see Additional file 1: Table S1). For ex-
ample, taking into account ‘death at usual address’ re-
duced the effect of end-of-life care location factors, but
adjusting for the level of service support needed in the
community-dwelling sub-sample strengthened the associ-
ation with comfort of dying in long-term care. The non-
significant association between dementia status and
dying comfortably was slightly reduced by adjusting
for any significant factor. Adjusting for the time inter-
val between participant deaths and informant inter-
views
also
made
minimal
or
no
difference
to
associations with other factors (see Additional file 2:
Table S2).
Figure 5 illustrates how closely inter-related the place of
care factors are: the majority of people who died in a care
home had also been cared for in their final illness in a care
home. This was usually the same home. Likewise, when
care during the final illness was in hospital, this was usually
the place of death too. However, more than half the

symptom during their final illness: distress, pain, depression and delirium or confusion were each reported to affect 40–50% of the deceased
study participants. Depending on the symptom, 6–13% of informants were unsure whether or not their relative had experienced symptoms.

during the final illness except for the expected higher prevalence of ‘delirium or confusion’ amongst those most cognitively impaired

dTo explore the effects of transitions in place of care at the very end of life, the variable Places of care at the end of life was derived from data on where each individual
was cared for during their final illness and where they died. Frequencies in other categories were too small (between 1 and 4 people) to calculate any estimates for other
combinations of place of care
End-of-life care in long-term care, avoiding transition between care settings at the end of life and not needing support from formal services were associated with
dying comfortably, as reported by informants

 evidence to inform service planning to support very
old people to die comfortably. Nearly half this repre-
sentative sample of very old people, who died at a
median age of 91, experienced at least three symp-
toms during their final illness. Pain and distress were
the most commonly reported, but no clear pattern of
symptom clusters emerged. There was some uncer-
tainty
about
which
symptoms
were
present,
particularly depression. Even the largest single symp-
tom group, unconsciousness, was small, suggesting
fewer than 10% of the very old simply ‘slip away’. Of
the treatable symptoms reported, pain was addressed
in the majority affected, though effectively for only
half these, but only a fraction of those with depres-
sion were treated. Nonetheless, despite high symp-
tom prevalence when dying, death was described as
comfortable for the majority. The association found
between
comfort
and
effective
treatment,
non-
significant within the small sub-sample reported to
have had symptoms addressed, may partially explain
informants describing many with multiple symptoms
as comfortable. Comfort was significantly associated
with being cared for in a long term care facility,
dying in a long term care facility and also with dying
at the individual’s usual address. Despite the high
proportions of the most cognitively impaired in all
these categories, the association between dementia
status and reported comfort at the end of life was
not significant. Of the majority still living at home
when last interviewed, those receiving support more
than once a week were more likely to move before
they died and less likely to be described as dying
comfortably.
A major strength of this study is its combination of
prospectively
collected
data
from
a
representative
population-based cohort with retrospective informant
interviews and death certificate data, allowing individual-
level examination of aspects of end-of-life care experi-
enced by very old people. The CC75C study is one of the
very few longstanding population cohorts with partici-
pants of such advanced age followed-up to death and data
including cognitive assessments from the last year of life.
Our sample is sizeable for end-of-life research with very
old people, but our focus on deaths in advanced old age
inevitably means it is nonetheless too small to fully
examine all potentially relevant factors. The hypotheses
generated by some of these findings may need testing by
combining studies in order to gain sufficient power in
future research.
The very nature of such longitudinal research also
carries limitations, such as the inevitable absence of
more recent measurement approaches [65] and the
extended data-collection period. It is possible that
experience of death is changing over time, though
one study that explored this (in a younger old age-
range) found minimal 10-year change in home-to-
hospital
end-of-life
transfers
and
proportions
of
deaths at home [66]. Information explaining reasons
for hospitalisation before death is limited. However,
few studies have been able to look at a whole “older
old” population and the CC75C data provide rare
insight. Limitations of proxy data from bereaved rel-
atives are well-recognised [67, 68] and our informant
interview post-bereavement timings varied. Others
have
explored
stability
of
family
informants’
responses over time [69, 70] and our analyses found
no impact on findings of these interval variations. A
further limitation with potentially more relevance to our
findings is the fact that, although drawn from a represen-
tative population-based cohort, our sample inevitably did
not include those for whom there was no informant to
give a retrospective interview. Assessing potential missing
data impacts, we confirmed the analysis sample broadly
reflected the full representative cohort.
Fig. 5 Transitions between place of care in the final illness and place of death. More than half the individuals whose care during the final illness
was at home died elsewhere, whereas the majority of those whose end-of-life care was in hospital or long-term care died there

 Other large population-based studies find prevalences of
dementia and cognitive impairment at the end of life at ad-
vanced age in line with this study, though most reporting
advanced age prevalence [71–74] are not specifically from
populations near death [2, 4]. As expected, we found higher
disability levels than reported from other “older old”
but not end-of-life cohorts [75, 76] and from studies
of older people nearing death but including a younger
old age range [77, 78]. Other population-wide research
provides broadly similar figures for the proportion of
those dying in different settings, with general concordance
that those with no cognitive impairment were most likely
to live at home and then move to hospital whereas those
with moderate-severe dementia were most likely to live
and die in a care home [39, 44, 47, 66, 79]. Other UK
research confirms transitions to hospital before death are
usually from home and least likely from nursing homes
[33, 43].
We found higher comfort ratings in long-term care; the
large UK VOICES study also found that care homes and
hospices were rated better than home for non-cancer
deaths, [7] and the Swedish NONA study found similar
satisfaction with care amongst relatives of over-90-year-
olds dying in care homes [80]. We recognise that an infor-
mant’s report of a comfortable death is a subjective meas-
ure that may be coloured by many factors and reported
comfort in care homes may reflect family hopes or even
staff defensiveness, but these conjectures are beyond what
the data can elucidate. The non-significant association of
moderate-severe dementia with reported comfort is some-
what supported by the VOICES study which found that
relatives of people who died with dementia tended to rate
the overall level of care better than ratings for those dying
without dementia, though they were less likely to rate care
excellent. [7] Authors of another study which found it
paradoxical that end-of-life care was improved when the
person had dementia hypothesised this was possibly due
to increased attention levels [81].
The symptom burden is also similar to that found in
other research, with pain and distress being common symp-
toms found in hospitals, care homes and at home in other
studies [82–86], and inadequate symptom relief also re-
ported as common [86]. There is discordance in the litera-
ture about the impact of symptoms on quality of dying
with some finding their presence has no effect [84]; we also
found no significant association between symptom pres-
ence and comfort.
It is heartening that these very old people, including
those with dementia, were described as being comfortable
at the end of life. However, the high symptom prevalence,
some reportedly inadequately addressed, reinforces calls
to improve end-of-life care from a plethora of recent
reports [87–89]. That symptoms were common is relevant
to current attention to the design and delivery of palliative
care [90, 91], particularly the low proportion of depression
treated. Mental health at the end of life for the very old
needs to be assessed and addressed, likewise the adequacy
of pain relief offered, especially considering the inter-play
of dementia, depression and distress.
It is important to note the strong inter-relationship of
many variables we considered. People with high support
needs at home are least likely to ‘stay in place’. People
with dementia at advanced ages are more likely to live in
care homes and experience fewer end-of-life transitions
to other settings. From a policy perspective the finding
that long-term care settings are associated with dying
comfortably supports recent evidence that is starting
to encourage re-thinking the focus on dying at home
[20, 22, 25, 26, 30, 92], particularly for this very old
age group. Cost-savings arguments based on cancer
care service models may be inappropriate to the very
different palliative care context for frail older people
[53, 55, 93], who cannot always be adequately sup-
ported at home [94–97]. There is growing recognition
that good care homes increasingly play a role akin to
hospices for the frail elderly [98, 99], but common
public perceptions [100] tend more to reflect con-
cerns over the wide variability in standards and the
challenges many homes face in providing end-of-life
care [101–104]. Recent research confirms this is no
less a challenge at home [33, 48, 51, 105–110], the
setting where the fewest very old people die, though
our findings suggest home can be a comfortable place
of

circumstances
support
staying
there. However, the number of older old people dying
in acute hospitals, where we found the odds of dying
comfortably were lowest, makes this another priority
area for improving end-of-life care [111–119].
Informants sometimes found it difficult to say when
the “final illness” began, even in retrospect: this is not
unexpected, given many participants’ health had been
fragile long before death [120]. In all settings, recognis-
ing at what point along a frailty trajectory someone is
dying is a challenge [49, 80, 104, 121–123] that some-
times hinders advance care planning (ACP). Older
people and their families’ choices need to be fully
informed through realistic discussion anticipating deteri-
oration, something many, but not all, very old people
would welcome [105, 124–127]. Early and more wide-
spread discussion of place of care and death, using clear
language and frank information could be helpful in
reducing the discomfort in talking about death, alleviat-
ing some distress and opening communication channels
for better symptom control. Transfer to a preferred
place of care should be facilitated whenever possible, but
all too commonly a patient is admitted to hospital
without those concerned having considered where they
can be best cared for, or would wish to die. If social/
Fleming et al. BMC Geriatrics  (2017) 17:222 
Page 13 of 17
 community care use is predictive of end-of-life comfort,
as found in our study, this has implications that can
guide planning future management of considerable care
needs. However, although ACP may reduce unwanted
transitions, including hospital admissions [17, 128], even
well-informed choices discussed in advance are no
guarantee when services cannot cope with changed
circumstances [129]. This very unpredictability underlies
some reluctance to make plans [105, 124, 127] and poses
big questions for future research and practice: how care
for the very old and frail at the end of their lives can be
responsive to their preference and deliver the best pos-
sible support in all settings for dying comfortably [130].
Conclusions
This study’s findings are consistent with reports that care
homes can provide care akin to hospice for the very old
and support an approach of supporting residents to stay in
their care home or own home if possible. The reported high
prevalence of multiple symptoms, but less frequently re-
ported symptom control, can inform policy and training to
improve older old people’s end-of-life care in all settings.

Additional file 1: Table S1. Factors potentially related to comfort
during the final illness. Factors found in univariate logistic regression
analyses to be significantly associated with reported comfort during the
final illness related to the place of end-of-life care and death, to transitions
between these and, for those living at home when last interviewed, to the
level of support received from services. As many variables of interest were
clearly inter-related, Table S1 shows the effects of adjusting for key signifi-
cant variables separately on odds ratios associated with all factors potentially
related to reported comfort (The ‘transitions at the end of life’ variable is
derived from ‘place of care in the final illness’ and ‘place of death’). Sample
size limitations precluded full stepwise multivariable regression modelling.
Cognition was hypothesised a priori to be important so, although univariate
analyses did not find this a significant factor, ORs adjusted for dementia/
cognitive status are also shown: this adjustment slightly reduced effect sizes
but did not remove significance of any associated factors. (DOC 131 kb)

Funding
We thank all the past CC75C sponsors for financial support spanning the
decades since the Medical Research Council enabled the first follow-up
survey (see study website for full list of project grants: http://www.cc75c.
group.cam.ac.uk/background/grants/). A BUPA Foundation Health and
Care of Older People grant supported data collection for these analyses
and we particularly thank our current funder Abbeyfield Research Foun-
dation. CC75C was a member study of the National Institute for Health
Research funded Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research
& Care (CLAHRC) for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. No funder spon-
sor played any role in the study design; in the collection, analysis, and
interpretation of data; or in the writing of the report and the decision
to submit the article for publication. All researchers were independent
from funders.
