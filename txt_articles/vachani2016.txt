ABSTRACT 
 
Background 
Bronchoscopy is often the initial diagnostic procedure performed in patients with pulmonary lesions suspicious 
for lung cancer.  A bronchial genomic classifier was previously validated to identify patients at low risk for lung 
cancer after an inconclusive bronchoscopy.  In this study, we evaluate the potential of the classifier to reduce 
invasive procedure utilization in patients with suspected lung cancer.  
 
Methods 
In two multicenter trials of patients undergoing bronchoscopy for suspected lung cancer, the classifier was 
measured in normal appearing bronchial epithelial cells from a mainstem bronchus. Among patients with low 
and intermediate pretest probability of cancer (n=222), subsequent invasive procedures following an 
inconclusive bronchoscopy were identified.  Estimates of the classifier’s ability to reduce unnecessary 
procedures were calculated. 
 
Results 
Of the 222 patients, 188 (85%) had an inconclusive bronchoscopy and follow-up procedure data available for 
analysis.  Seventy-seven (41%) patients underwent an additional 99 additional invasive procedures, which 
included surgical lung biopsy in 40 (52%) patients. Benign and malignant disease were ultimately diagnosed in 
62 (81%) and 15 (19%) patients, respectively.  Among those undergoing surgical biopsy, 20 (50%) were 
performed in patients with benign disease. Were the classifier used to guide decision making, procedures 
could have been avoided in 50% (21 of 42) of patients undergoing further invasive testing. Further, among 35 
patients with an inconclusive index bronchoscopy that were diagnosed with lung cancer, the sensitivity of the 
classifier was 89%, with 4 (11%) patients having a falsely negative classifier result.    
 
Conclusions 
Invasive procedures following an inconclusive bronchoscopy occur frequently and the majority are performed 
in patients ultimately diagnosed with benign disease. Using the genomic classifier as an adjunct to 
bronchoscopy may reduce the frequency and associated morbidity of these invasive procedures.

INTRODUCTION 
Lesions that are suspicious for lung cancer on chest imaging present a unique diagnostic challenge.    
Incidental lung lesions are increasingly common given the rapid rise in the use of chest computed tomography 
for a variety of indications [1]. Coupled with the recent evidence from the National Lung Screening Trial 
supporting the use of low-dose CT (LDCT) screening for lung cancer [2], there will likely be a significant increase 
in the identification of patients with suspicious lung lesions that require diagnostic evaluation.   
Bronchoscopy is often the initial diagnostic procedure performed in patients with suspected lung 
cancer, and can provide a definitive diagnosis and allows for simultaneous staging [3]. Despite advances such 
as navigational and ultrathin bronchoscopy and peripheral endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) [4], the sensitivity 
of bronchoscopy for smaller, peripherally located nodules is limited [5]. Given its limited sensitivity and low 
negative predictive value, a bronchoscopy that does not provide a definitive diagnosis of cancer frequently 
leads to additional invasive testing, such as transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNB) or surgical lung biopsy.  In 
patients with a low to intermediate probability of cancer and an inconclusive bronchoscopy the decision of 
whether to pursue additional invasive testing or watchful waiting can be a difficult one. It requires balancing 
the risks of invasive procedures in patients who may have a benign lesion versus the possibility of a delayed 
lung cancer diagnosis [6].   
Recently a bronchial genomic classifier was validated in two prospective multicenter studies and 
shown to improve the sensitivity of bronchoscopy and better identify patients who are at low probability 
(<10%) of lung cancer after an inconclusive bronchoscopy [7, 8].  The classifier is based on analysis of gene 
expression measured in cytologically normal appearing bronchial epithelial cells collected from a mainstem 
bronchus at the time of bronchoscopy [7, 7].  The classifier does not require direct sampling of the lung lesion, 
but instead detects lung-cancer associated gene expression changes occurring in the airway ‘field of injury’ [9, 
10].  In patients with a low or intermediate risk of cancer, the classifier achieved a sensitivity of 88% and 
specificity of 52%. The sensitivity of the classifier was similar across different lung cancer histologies, stages, 
and lesion sizes. When bronchoscopy did not result in a diagnosis of cancer, the observed probability of lung 
cancer for patients with a negative classifier result was low (9%) among patients at intermediate pre-test 
probability of cancer (defined as 10 – 60%), and very low (0%) among patients with a low pre-test probability 
(defined as < 10%) [8]. 
Although the above studies establish clinical validity of the genomic classifier, the clinical utility of this 
test has not been established.  The performance of the classifier suggests that a negative score would support 
a more conservative diagnostic approach in low and intermediate pre-test probability patients and has the 
potential to reduce the use of invasive procedures in patients who are likely to have benign disease. The

present study examines the rate of invasive diagnostic procedures observed in the AEGIS trials with a low or 
intermediate pre-test probability of cancer as it is this population where additional diagnostic testing after an 
inconclusive bronchoscopy is frequently performed and a biomarker with high negative predictive value may 
result in greater utilization of surveillance imaging. We also estimate the ability of the classifier to reduce the 
rate of invasive procedures in patients ultimately diagnosed with benign disease. 
 
METHODS 
Study Population 
The Airway Epithelial Gene Expression in the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer (AEGIS) trials (AEGIS-1 and -2, 
NCT01309087 and NCT00746759), were two prospective, multicenter (n=28 centers), observational studies 
that enrolled 939 current and former smokers without a prior history of cancer who underwent bronchoscopy 
for suspected lung cancer.  The design of these studies have been described in detail elsewhere [8].  The study 
protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each center, and all patients provided written 
informed consent before enrollment. 
At the time of bronchoscopy, two brushings of bronchial epithelial cells from a normal appearing area 
of a mainstem bronchus were collected and profiled for gene-expression by Affymetrix GeneST1.0 arrays. A 23-
gene expression classifier for detecting lung cancer (Percepta™, Veracyte Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was 
trained using samples from a cohort of 299 patients from AEGIS-1 [7], then validated in samples from two 
independent cohorts (AEGIS-1; n=298) and AEGIS-2; n=341) [8].   Physicians and patients were blinded to 
results of the classifier.  Bronchoscopy was considered diagnostic if a lung cancer diagnosis was established by 
cytopathology.  All other patients were followed until a definitive diagnosis was established or one year post 
bronchoscopy.  Patients determined to be cancer-free had either a specific benign diagnosis or radiographic 
stability/resolution by 12 months.  Patients without a diagnosis of lung cancer, a specific benign diagnosis, or 
stability or resolution at 12-months were excluded from further analysis.  
Prior to bronchoscopy, the treating physician assessed each patient’s pretest probability of cancer with 
the use of a five-level scale (<10%, 10 to 39%, 40 to 60%, 61 to 85%, and>85%), which were then binned into 
three risk categories of low (<10%), intermediate (10-60%), and high (>60%).  Since our prior studies found that 
the classifier’s negative likelihood ratio (NLR=0.06) would not reduce the post-test risk  among the high pre-
test probability  group to under 10% [8], the current analysis assesses the classifier’s impact on procedure 
utilization in the 222 patients (24%) with a low or intermediate pre-test probability (i.e., <60%) where a 
negative classifier score would reduce the post-test risk of cancer to under 10% and potentially alter clinical 
decision making (i.e. deferring further invasive procedures and instead adopting surveillance imaging).

Data Collection and Analysis of Classifier  
Baseline data collection included demographics, tobacco use, medical history and previous diagnostic 
tests.  For patients in whom the initial bronchoscopy did not yield a diagnosis of lung cancer, data was 
collected on all subsequent diagnostic procedures within the first 12 months or until a cancer diagnosis was 
confirmed.  
 
Invasive procedures were categorized as: repeat bronchoscopy, TTNB, and surgical biopsy (open 
thoracotomy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, or mediastinoscopy). Other tests (e.g. imaging, sputum 
analysis, thoracentesis, bone scans, nuclear medicine scans, ultrasound, and pulmonary function tests), as well 
as biopsies of organs other than the lungs, were not considered in this analysis.   
 
Statistical Analysis 
Summary statistics are reported as medians and interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables and 
as proportions for categorical variables.  Comparison of differences in baseline variables between low and 
intermediate probability patients were calculated using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test for continuous 
variables and Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables.  Subsequent invasive procedures following the index 
bronchoscopy were summarized as counts and rates. These were calculated overall, and stratified by pre-test 
probability (low vs. intermediate). Procedures within the initial reporting period (0-3 months) vs. the follow up 
period (3-12 months) were counted separately and together to examine the timing of procedure use. 
Statistical analysis was performed using CRAN R software (version 3.2.1). 
Since the performance of the classifier (as measured by the AUC) was not different between the 
training and two validation sets (data not shown), they were combined for the analysis of procedure 
utilization. Results of the classifier were used to estimate the number of patients in whom the decision to 
pursue subsequent invasive procedures may have been influenced by the test.  The potential reduction in the 
rate of invasive procedure utilization was calculated on the assumption that a negative classifier result would 
result in the treating physician deferring further invasive procedures and instead adopting a watching waiting 
approach with surveillance imaging.  Among patients who did not have lung cancer identified on the index 
bronchoscopy, the number and proportion of true negatives (patients with benign disease and a negative 
classifier result) and false negatives (patients with lung cancer and a negative classifier results) were reported.

RESULTS 
Patient Population 
 There were 222 patients with a low or intermediate pre-test probability of cancer enrolled in AEGIS-1 
and -2; 199 (90%) had an inconclusive index bronchoscopy (Figure 1). Data on the subsequent use of additional 
procedures was available for 188 (94%) of these patients; demographic data and details of the specific 
bronchoscopic techniques employed are shown in Table 1. Patients with an intermediate probability were 
significantly older (p=0.001), had greater cumulative tobacco exposure (p<0.001), were more likely to have 
lesions over 3cm in size (p=0.01), but were similar in terms of race, and sex distribution.  Overall, lung cancer 
was diagnosed in 35 patients (19%); the remaining 153 (81%) were ultimately diagnosed with benign disease.  
In patients with an inconclusive bronchoscopy, the lung cancer prevalence was 3% and 28% in patients with a 
low and intermediate pre-test probability respectively.  
 
 
Diagnostic Procedure Utilization  
In the 188 patients with an inconclusive index bronchoscopy, subsequent invasive biopsy procedures 
were performed in 77 (41%) (Table 2).  A total of 99 procedures were performed in these 77 patients and 
included 18 procedures in 15 low probability patients and 81 procedures in 62 intermediate probability 
patients.  The type and rate of subsequent invasive procedures performed among these 77 patients included 
surgical lung biopsy in 40 (52%) patients, TTNB in 20 (26%) patients, and repeat bronchoscopy in 39 (51%) 
patients. Physicians were more likely to pursue additional procedures in patients with an intermediate 
probability compared to those with low probability (53% vs. 21%, p<0.001; Table 2).   
 Forty-two (55%) of the 77 of the patients in the combined low and intermediate probability categories 
who underwent additional invasive testing were ultimately diagnosed with benign disease.  Among 
intermediate probability patients who underwent a subsequent procedure, 29 (47%) of 62 patients were 
diagnosed with benign disease, compared to 13 (87%) of 15 of low probability patients who were found to 
have benign disease (Figure 2A).  Among the 42 patients with benign disease, a total of 52 procedures were 
performed, with 16 procedures performed in 13 low probability patients and 36 procedures performed in 29 
intermediate probability patients (Figure 2B).   
Among the 77 patients that underwent subsequent invasive testing, 40 (52%) had a surgical lung 
biopsy, of which half were performed in patients with benign disease (20 of 40 patients); this included 86% (6 
of 7) low probability and 42% (14 of 33) in intermediate probability patients, respectively.

To examine the likelihood of a delayed lung cancer diagnosis, we calculated the timing of additional 
invasive procedures in the 35 patients diagnosed with lung cancer following an inconclusive bronchoscopy; 27 
(80%) had a lung cancer diagnosis established within 3 months of the index bronchoscopy while 8 (20%) had a 
delay in their diagnosis of between 3 and 12 months. 
 
Potential Impact of the Classifier on Invasive Procedure Utilization 
The potential for the bronchial genomic classifier to reduce the number of invasive procedures in 
patients with an inconclusive bronchoscopy was assessed by examining the rate of a negative classifier result 
among patients who underwent subsequent invasive procedures.  This analysis assumes that a negative 
classifier score would result in a decision to use surveillance imaging instead of proceeding to an additional 
invasive procedure. Among the 153 total patients with benign disease (including 84 intermediate and 69 low 
pre-test probability), 83 (54%) had a negative classifier result, yielding a reduction in the post-test probability 
of cancer (Figure 3A).  Forty-one (49%) intermediate probability patients were determined to have a low post-
test probability on the basis of a negative classifier result, with the balance of patients remaining at 
intermediate post-test probability.  Forty-two (61%) low pre-test probability patients were determined to have 
a ‘very low’ post-test probability (0%) on the basis of a negative classifier result, while the remaining 27 (39%) 
remained at low post-test probability.    
Of the 153 low and intermediate pre-test probability patients with benign disease, 42 (27%) 
underwent a total of 52 subsequent invasive procedures. The classifier was negative (i.e. true negatives) in 21 
(50%) patients leading to the possible avoidance of 24 procedures (including 12 bronchoscopies, 3 TTNA, and 9 
surgeries).  This represents a 46% (24 of 52) reduction in all invasive procedures performed in patients with 
benign disease.  Of the 21 patients with benign disease who were classifier negative, 9 (43%) were low pre-test 
probability patients, and 12 (57%) were intermediate pre-test probability patients (Figure 3B).    
Among 35 patients with an inconclusive index bronchoscopy that were diagnosed with lung cancer, 
there were 4 patients with a negative classifier result (false negative rate of 11%) (Figure 4).  This occurred in 4 
patients with an intermediate pre-test probability of cancer prior to bronchoscopy in whom a negative 
classifier result yielded a low post-test probability.   
 
DISCUSSION 
In this study, we have examined the rate of invasive diagnostic procedures among current and former 
smokers with low and intermediate pre-test probability of cancer following an inconclusive bronchoscopy. We 
found that there is a relatively high frequency of invasive diagnostic procedures in this clinical setting (41%

overall), with a majority of those procedures occurring in patients ultimately diagnosed with benign disease.  
Our estimates suggests that a significant proportion of invasive procedures could be avoided after an 
inconclusive bronchoscopy with the use of the genomic classifier.   
Subsequent invasive procedures following an inconclusive bronchoscopy have the potential for 
substantial morbidity from procedural complications. In this study 50% of surgical lung biopsies were 
performed in patients with benign disease.  This rate is consistent with the rate of surgical biopsies resulting in 
a diagnosis of benign disease seen in lung cancer screening studies and in a populations based study of lung 
nodule management [2,11,12,13,14].  Surgical lung biopsy has a moderate complication rate and a 30-day 
mortality of approximately 1% [15, 16]. TTNB is also associated with substantial complications, including a 15% 
rate of pneumothorax and a 6% rate of pneumothorax requiring chest tube drainage [17, 18, 19].  The classifier 
will likely result in a reduction in invasive procedure utilization in patients with pre-test low and intermediate 
probability lesions, the majority of whom have benign disease.   Fifty-four percent of patients with benign 
disease and an inconclusive bronchoscopy had a negative classifier result, enabling a lower post-classifier 
probability of cancer, which could facilitate the decision by physicians to recommend watchful waiting rather 
than proceed with another invasive procedure.  Of the patients with benign disease that subsequently 
underwent additional procedures, 50% were classifier negative.   The primary clinical value of the bronchial 
genomic classifier is conferred on patients with an intermediate probability and an inconclusive bronchoscopy 
in whom a negative classifier results in a low post-test likelihood of lung cancer.  The classifier may also be 
useful in patients with a low pre-test probability as the majority (87%) that went on to an invasive procedure 
were classifier negative and were ultimately diagnosed with benign disease.   
In the current study, 4 (11%) of 35 patients with lung cancer were classifier negative (false negatives) 
and may have experienced a delayed diagnosis if they were followed with surveillance imaging as a result of 
the classifier.  However, we found that in the absence of the classifier, 20% (7 of 35) of patients with lung 
cancer and an inconclusive bronchoscopy were not diagnosed within 3 months after their initial procedure, 
due to decision to pursue surveillance imaging prior to the decision to pursue additional procedures.  The low 
rate of false negative results observed with the classifier may result in a modest increase in the number of lung 
cancer patients that undergo surveillance prior to additional invasive evaluation.  If patients with a negative 
classifier are evaluated with serial imaging (i.e. repeat scan at 3 months) there should not be a lengthy delay in 
identifying lesions that are growing which should proceed to another biopsy.  
Although the AEGIS trials provided us with a unique opportunity to estimate the clinical utility of the 
bronchial genomic classifier, there are a number of important limitations to our study.  In our current analysis

we estimated the ability of the classifier to decrease subsequent invasive procedure utilization.  This approach 
rests on the underlying assumption that a negative classifier result would have been sufficient to warrant a 
more conservative diagnostic evaluation in patients who would have otherwise been sent for an invasive 
procedure.  Our study was not designed to assess the factors associated with physicians’ decisions to pursue 
additional invasive procedures. In addition, as physicians were blinded to results of the classifier we are unable 
to directly evaluate the actual impact of that classifier on their decision-making.  In some patients with a 
negative classifier result, physicians may still choose to proceed with further invasive testing. We also did not 
estimate the effect that patient preferences may have on subsequent invasive procedure utilization following 
an inconclusive bronchoscopy.  Importantly, we were unable to evaluate whether some of the invasive 
procedures in patients with benign disease resulted in a diagnosis that altered clinical management of that 
patient, providing clinically useful results to the physician. 
Given that these observational studies did not mandate that subsequent evaluation following 
bronchoscopy occur at the study center, there may have been additional invasive procedures performed that 
are not accounted for in our data. The studies were limited to 12 months of clinical follow-up post index 
bronchoscopy. We do not believe that we missed a significant number of lung cancers that would have been 
found with an additional year of follow-up. The high sensitivity of CT to detect nodule growth makes it unlikely 
that solid nodules that are stable for 12 months will grow subsequently.  This is supported by lung cancer 
screening studies that showed only 1 of 1000 nodules that were stable in the first year were determined to be 
malignant in the second year of follow-up [13].  Finally, we used data from all patients enrolled in both trials 
given the similar accuracy estimates observed in the training and test sets.  As our goal was to estimate 
downstream procedure use after an index bronchoscopy, the similar AUC estimates allowed for this approach 
to increase statistical power.  
There are a number of strengths to our study that contribute to the potential impact of our findings.  
First, we leveraged two large multicenter studies that enabled us to include geographically diverse academic 
and community practices in our estimate of invasive procedure use. Second, our data was collected in a clinical 
setting identical to that in which the classifier would be used (pre-diagnosis), allowing us to better estimate the 
potential clinical utility of the test. Third, we limited these studies to patients with low and intermediate 
pretest probability where physicians are most uncertain about the likelihood of cancer and where the classifier 
holds the greatest ability to alter clinical decision-making. Finally, probability of cancer was based on a 
physician’s subjective assessment (as opposed to risk prediction models) which both mirrors clinical practice 
and was shown to reflect cancer prevalence rates in the AEGIS trials [8].

In summary there is a high frequency of invasive procedures performed in patients with a low or 
intermediate pre-test probability of lung cancer after an inconclusive bronchoscopy, and a majority of these 
procedures are performed in patients ultimately diagnosed with benign disease. This analysis suggests that 
using the bronchial genomic classifier during bronchoscopy may reduce invasive procedures in this population.  
Future studies should attempt to confirm reductions in invasive procedures that result from the finding of a 
negative genomic classifier that prompts a physician to pursue serial imaging surveillance after an inconclusive 
bronchoscopy, as well as examine the impact of the classifier on cancer endpoints such as stage at diagnosis as 
well the impact on costs and patient reported outcomes.

A total of 222 patients in the AEGIS trials were found to have a low or intermediate pretest probability of 
cancer. Of those, 23 patients had a diagnosis of lung cancer at bronchoscopy and the remaining 199 (90%) had 
an inconclusive bronchoscopy, where no malignancy was found. Longitudinal diagnosis and procedure 
utilization data was unavailable for 11 patients; the final analytical cohort of 188 patients consisted of 35 
diagnosed with lung cancer and 153 with benign diagnoses during the follow-up period.
