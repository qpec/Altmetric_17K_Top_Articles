ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To quantify how a period of intense media coverage of 
controversy over the risk:benefit balance of statins 
affected their use.
Design
Interrupted time series analysis of prospectively 
collected electronic data from primary care.
setting
Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in the 
United Kingdom.
PartiCiPants
Patients newly eligible for or currently taking statins for 
primary and secondary cardiovascular disease 
prevention in each month in January 2011-March 2015.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Adjusted odds ratios for starting/stopping taking statins 
after the media coverage (October 2013-March 2014).
results
There was no evidence that the period of high media 
coverage was associated with changes in statin 
initiation among patients with a high recorded risk 
score for cardiovascular disease (primary prevention) 
or a recent cardiovascular event (secondary prevention) 
(odds ratio 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.87 to 1.13; 
P=0.92) and 1.04 (0.92 to 1.18; P=0.54), respectively), 
though there was a decrease in the overall proportion 
of patients with a recorded risk score. Patients already 
taking statins were more likely to stop taking them for 
both primary and secondary prevention after the high 
media coverage period (1.11 (1.05 to 1.18; P<0.001) and 
1.12 (1.04 to 1.21; P=0.003), respectively). Stratified 
analyses showed that older patients and those with a 
longer continuous prescription were more likely to stop 
taking statins after the media coverage. In post hoc 
analyses, the increased rates of cessation were no 
longer observed after six months.
COnClusiOns
A period of intense public discussion over the risks: 
benefit balance of statins, covered widely in the media, 
was followed by a transient rise in the proportion of people 
who stopped taking statins. This research highlights the 
potential for widely covered health stories in the lay 
media to impact on healthcare related behaviour.
Introduction
Statins reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease1  and are 
widely recommended as part of the strategy for primary 
and secondary prevention.2-6  Severe adverse effects asso-
ciated with statins are extremely rare,7 but concerns over 
purportedly high rates of side effects such as muscle pain 
and weakness have been raised in the academic press 
and reported in the national media. In October 2013, two 
articles published in The BMJ were perceived as critical 
of statins, with one suggesting that side effects might out-
weigh the overall health benefits in patients at low and 
intermediate risk.8 
9  Although the comments on rates of 
side effects were based on evidence from non-blinded 
observational data, and the articles were focused on the 
benefit:risk ratio in those with low risk, they generated 
extensive and broader discussion in the media about 
statins. The debate peaked in March 2014, when most 
national media outlets in the United Kingdom covered 
the subject.10 
11 Media coverage of these articles was prob-
ably intensified because of the impending changes in the 
guidelines proposed by the UK National Institute for 
Health and Care Excellence (NICE, July 2014), which 
broadened eligibility for statins from patients with a high 
(≥20%) 10 year risk of cardiovascular disease to those 
with intermediate (≥10%) 10 year risk.
As a society we are increasingly exposed to numerous 
and disparate sources of health information, and it has 
been shown that this bombardment leads to a lack of 
clarity about which sources patients and others should 
trust.12  Studies in Denmark, Australia, Turkey, and 
France have suggested that media debate about side 
effects of statins has led to measurable effects on certain 
aspects of use,13-16  and qualitative work has shown that 
concerns over side effects and a desire for clearer infor-
mation regarding the risks and benefits can affect use in 
patients in the UK.17-19 No large studies to date, however, 
have comprehensively evaluated the effects of media 
debates about treatment with statins on prescribing for 
both the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovas-
cular disease and the consequences for public health.
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Studies from Denmark, Australia, Turkey, and France have suggested that negative 
media stories can affect statin cessation and prescribing rates
Two controversial articles about statins were published in October 2013 in the UK, 
with a subsequent high volume of debate in the media about the associated 
potential risks and benefits
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
After the media coverage, there were no changes in statin initiation among those 
with a recorded new indication but an 11% and 12% increase in the likelihood of 
existing users stopping their treatment, for primary and secondary prevention, 
respectively
These effects could result more than 2000 extra cardiovascular events across the 
UK over a 10 year period
This research provides unique evidence describing the potential for widely covered 
health stories in the media to affect real world behaviour related to healthcare, with 
implications for public health, and has the potential to inform future interactions 
between clinicians, researchers, the academic press, and the wider media

RESEARCH
2
Using prescribing data from routinely collected UK 
primary care records, we quantified the potential associ-
ation between the debate in the media about the side 
effects of statins and initiation and cessation of treat-
ment in UK primary care for both primary and secondary 
prevention of cardiovascular disease. We investigated 
whether any potential media effects differed by key 
patient level characteristics and estimated the public 
health impact of any changes in patterns of use that 
might have arisen from the controversy, in particular 
the resulting number of excess cardiovascular events.
Methods
study design and setting
This ecological interrupted time series study used pro-
spectively collected data from the UK Clinical Practice 
Research Datalink (CPRD), a primary care database con-
taining anonymised data from about 6.9% of the UK pop-
ulation.20 
21  General practitioners play a key role in the 
UK healthcare system as they are responsible for primary 
healthcare and specialist referrals. The CPRD includes 
prescriptions and clinical diagnoses from primary care, 
as well as diagnoses from secondary care that are typi-
cally fed back to general practitioners. Those represented 
in the database are broadly representative of the UK pop-
ulation in terms of age and sex.21  In the interrupted time 
series design, population level outcomes (in this case, 
proportions of people starting/stopping statins) are cal-
culated over time, and then statistical regression tech-
niques are used to investigate how trends in these 
outcomes are affected by a population level exposure 
that occurs in a single well defined time period (here, 
widespread media coverage about statins over a six 
month period)—that is, the exposure is viewed as a 
potential “interruption” to the underlying trends in the 
outcome(s) over time.22
We produced a code list for statins by identifying all 
drugs that included the word “statin” in either the prod-
uct name or the drug substance name. The proportions 
of patients initiating and stopping statins were calcu-
lated for each month from January 2011 to March 2015. 
Definitions for our study populations and ascertainment 
of statin initiation and cessation are described below.
statin initiation
Study population
For each calendar month, we identified all individuals 
aged >40 registered at their general practice for at least 
a year, with no previous recorded prescriptions for a sta-
tin, and no previous cardiovascular disease events, and 
who had either a newly recorded 10 year cardiovascular 
risk score (hereafter referred to as simply 10 year risk 
score) of >20% (appendix part 1) (that is, eligible to start 
taking a statin for primary prevention of cardiovascular 
disease) or an incident cardiovascular event (that is, eli-
gible to start taking a statin for secondary prevention). 
Incident events were defined as a first record of coronary 
heart disease (myocardial infarction, angina, revascu-
larisation procedures), cerebrovascular disease (stroke, 
transient ischaemic attack), or peripheral vascular 
 
disease (abdominal aortic aneurism and  
intermittent 
claudication) dated at least a year after the start of a 
patient’s CPRD follow-up. These events were identified 
within patient records by searching for NHS Read codes 
corresponding to any of these diagnoses; we used code 
lists developed for the CALIBER programme.23
Defining initiation
We then calculated the proportion of patients who 
started taking statins for primary and secondary preven-
tion separately for each calendar month throughout the 
study period. Patients were defined as starting a statin 
for primary prevention if they had received a first pre-
scription within 28 days of the date of the risk score 
being recorded. The denominator was all patients eligi-
ble to start treatment for primary prevention (as above) 
who remained alive, under follow-up, and free from car-
diovascular disease for the full 28 day period after their 
risk score. Patients were defined as starting a statin for 
secondary prevention if they received a first prescription 
in primary care ≤60 days after their first cardiovascular 
event; the 60 day grace period was chosen to allow for a 
period of admission to hospital, based on preliminary 
analyses (appendix part 2). The denominator for this 
calculation was all those eligible to start treatment for 
secondary prevention (as above) who remained alive 
and under follow-up for the full 60 day grace period.
statin cessation
Study population
For each calendar month, we identified all individuals 
aged >40 and in receipt of a statin prescription that 
ended within that calendar month. Prescription end 
dates were calculated based on the date of prescription 
and quantity of tablets prescribed (appendix part 3). 
Patients could be included in more than one monthly 
cohort if they had multiple prescriptions ending during 
the study period. The study population was then strati-
fied into those taking statins for primary prevention 
(defined as those with no record of a previous cardio-
vascular event) and those taking statins for secondary 
prevention (those with any previous event).
Defining cessation
We calculated the proportion of patients who stopped 
their statins each month: stopping was defined as 
receiving no further prescription within 28 days of the 
end date of the previous prescription. This 28 day grace 
period allowed time for patients with previously over-
lapping prescriptions to use their excess tablets, based 
on a preliminary analysis in which we identified all pre-
scriptions from January 2011 to October 2013 and calcu-
lated that 90% of prescriptions were followed up with a 
new prescription within 28 days of the initial prescrip-
tion ending. Only those remaining alive, under fol-
low-up, and free from cardiovascular disease (for the 
primary prevention analysis) for the full 28 day grace 
period were included in the denominator.
Period of exposure to high media coverage
We defined an exposure period of October 2013 to March 
2014, and we compared patterns of statin initiation and

cessation before and after this time period. The start 
date of the exposure was chosen to coincide with the 
publication of The BMJ papers about statins.8 
9 The end 
date was determined by carrying out a Google trend 
analytics search for the term “statin side effects” in the 
UK, which tracks the popularity of this search term over 
time, and by taking the date of peak searching for this 
term after October 2013 as the end of the exposure 
period (appendix part 4). This led to the choice of March 
2014, which coincided with a spell of widespread cover-
age of the debate over statin side effects across most 
major national media outlets in the UK.
statistical analysis
We carried out an interrupted time series analysis using 
a generalised linear model with a binomial error struc-
ture, which accounts for the month by month variation 
in denominators (that is, the number of people eligible 
to initiate or stop taking a statin each month).22  Sea-
sonal effects were accounted for by adjustment for cal-
endar month,24  and first order lagged residuals were 
included to account for autocorrelation.25  Standard 
errors were scaled to account for overdispersion.26 Time 
was divided into three segments: before, during, and 
after the exposure period of high media coverage.
Within this modelling framework, we conducted sep-
arate analyses to investigate changes in statin initiation 
for primary prevention; statin initiation for secondary 
prevention; statin cessation in primary prevention; and 
statin cessation in secondary prevention. In each analy-
sis, we looked at whether there was a step change in the 
log odds of initiating or stopping a statin after the expo-
sure period compared with before, assuming an under-
lying linear month on month trend throughout the study 
period. We also investigated whether the underlying 
trend over time in the log odds of initiating/stopping a 
statin changed after the exposure period, compared 
with before. A Wald test was used to compare the trends 
(log odds ratio per month) before and after exposure. 
Linear predictions of the log odds and 95% confidence 
intervals of an event were calculated from the models 
and converted into probabilities, which we plotted along 
with a scatter of the raw proportion of patients that initi-
ated/stopped treatment with a statin. We did not directly 
estimate trends during the exposure period itself 
because in this period individual level exposure to the 
coverage would probably have been dynamically chang-
ing, and the small number of data points in this period 
would have led to imprecise and inconclusive estimates.
We then investigated effect modification by the follow-
ing prespecified factors: age group (40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 
70-79, ≥80), sex, diabetes (identified with Read codes), 
and length of previous continuous prescription (up to six 
months, six months to one year, one to two years, two to 
four years, longer than four years). When stratifying by 
length of previous continuous prescription, we restricted 
the analysis to patients whose most recent continuous 
prescription began at least a year after their current reg-
istration into CPRD, to ensure that the initiation date was 
accurate and duration could be reliably categorised. By 
re-fitting the models with the monthly counts stratified 
by the above factors, and an interaction term added 
between the potential effect modifier and the parameter 
representing the  
post-exposure change in cessation, we 
examined each potential effect modifier in a separate 
model and generated P values with likelihood ratio tests. 
For ordinal covariates, we further explored effect modifi-
cation by testing for linear trend.
Post hoc analyses
After observing an increase in statin cessation that 
seemed to be transient in our primary analyses, we then 
separated post-exposure time into two periods of six 
months, and tested whether there was a difference 
between the modelled levels of cessation in each 
post-exposure period versus the pre-exposure period. 
We also carried out analyses investigating both a step 
change and trend change simultaneously after the expo-
sure period, which allowed us to determine the monthly 
rate at which cessation fell after the initial level increase.
To examine changes in the application of risk scoring 
by GPs over time, we calculated the monthly proportion 
of patients in the whole of CPRD with any recorded 10 
year risk score for cardiovascular disease, as well as the 
proportions of patients with very high (≥30%), high (20-
30%), intermediate (10-20%), or low (<10%) risk scores 
recorded; these data were then analysed with similar 
methods as for the main analysis.
negative control analysis
In a preplanned negative control analysis, we replicated 
the main analyses using drugs prescribed for glaucoma 
(appendix part 5). Like statins, these drugs are given to 
those at high risk of disease as a preventive measure, 
are prescribed with similar frequency, and are typically 
intended to be continued for life after initiation. The 
purpose of this analysis was to ensure that any changes 
in statin use after the exposure period were not 
explained by broader unrelated underlying trends in 
prescriptions coincident with our exposure period or by 
other biases arising from the methods. In a second neg-
ative control analysis, we re-ran our main analyses 
using an alternative exposure period of 12 months ear-
lier as we had no reason to expect any changes in pre-
scribing trends around this time.
Public health impact
To estimate the potential public health impact of changes 
in statin cessation, we compared the modelled cessation 
level in the first six months after the high media coverage 
exposure period (see “post hoc analyses” above) with the 
expected cessation level in the same period had there 
been no changes after exposure (that is, simply project-
ing the modelled “before” trend line for cessation for-
ward). This estimated the number of patients who might 
have stopped taking a statin because of the controversy 
reported in the media, under the assumption of causal-
ity. We then estimated the number of excess cardiovascu-
lar events among these patients, assuming an average 10 
year risk of 20% among those stopping, and assuming 
that statins would reduce risk by 19%, based on statin 
efficacy

Trialists’  
Collaboration.27  We also used historical data 
from CPRD to estimate and take account of the propor-
tion of patients who would have stopped taking statins or 
died in the following 10 years regardless of the media 
controversy. On the basis of results from a published 
study,28 we assumed that 66% of patients who stopped 
statins would restart within the following 12 months with 
no loss of protection. In a second calculation, to obtain 
an upper bound on the impact, we made the more pessi-
mistic assumption that all those who stopped taking 
statins did not ever take them again. Full details of these 
calculations are given in appendix part 6.

Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to 
 
disseminate the results of the research to study partici-
pants or the relevant patient community
Results
Throughout the study period we identified 88 010 
records of a 10 year risk score of ≥20% for cardiovascu-
lar disease, 28 593 incident cardiovascular events, 
9 286 148 prescriptions of statins for primary preven-
tion, and 5 130 148 prescriptions of statins for second-
ary prevention. Table 1 provides an overview of study 
populations.
Figure 1 shows the estimated step change in the like-
lihood of patients initiating and stopping taking a statin 
for primary and secondary prevention after the expo-
sure period, over and above the underlying time trend. 
Figures showing the estimated change in the month-on-
month trends in statin initiation/cessation are in

.
Changes in statin initiation
There was no evidence of a stepped change in statin 
initiation for primary prevention after the exposure 
period compared with before, adjusted for the under-
lying trend over time (odds ratio 0.99, 95% confi-
dence interval 0.87 to 1.13; fig 1  A), and no evidence 
of a stepped change in statin initiation for secondary 
prevention (1.04, 0.92 to 1.18; fig 1 B). When we looked 
at month on month trends in initiation over time, we 
estimated an underlying increase in initiation for pri-
mary prevention before the exposure period, which 
seemed to accelerate after the exposure period 
(appendix part 7a, P<0.001). We observed no change 
in the underlying trend in initiation for secondary 
prevention after the exposure period (appendix part 
7b, P=0.41).
Changes in statin cessation
Patients were more likely to stop taking statins after the 
exposure period compared with before, after we 
accounted for the underlying trend over time, for both 
primary and secondary prevention (odds ratio 1.11 (95% 
confidence interval 1.05 to 1.18) and 1.12 (1.04 to 1.21), 
respectively; fig 1 C/D). We found no evidence of any 
change in the underlying month on month trends in sta-
tin cessation (appendix part 7c and 7d, P=0.17 and 
P=0.16, respectively, for statins used for primary and sec-
ondary prevention).
stratified analysis
The increase in statin cessation after the exposure 
period seemed to vary by both duration of previous 
statin use and age group (fig 2). The increase in the 
 
likelihood of stopping after the exposure period was 
more pronounced among those who had taken statins 
for longer than those with shorter previous use 
(P<0.001 for trend in both primary and secondary pre-
vention analyses). To aid comparability with other 
studies, we also divided duration of previous continu-
ous prescription into less than and more than a year, 
and again we found a larger increase in the odds of 
stopping among those prescribed for longer (for cessa-
tion for primary prevention odds ratios were 1.10 (95% 
confidence interval 1.03 to 1.17) among those with less 
than one year of continuous prescription and 1.23 (1.15 
to 1.32) among those with more than one year of con-
tinuous prescription; for cessation for secondary pre-
vention the odds ratios were 1.10 (1.01 to 1.19) and 1.23 
(1.13 to 1.33), respectively). The increased likelihood of 
stopping a statin used for primary and secondary pre-
vention after the exposure period also became more 
pronounced in older age groups (P<0.001 for trend in 
both cases). We did not carry out stratified analyses for 
initiation as there were no measurable effects in the 
primary analyses.

Post hoc analyses
In primary and secondary prevention, the increase in ces-
sation seemed to be restricted to the first six months after 
exposure, after which cessation fell to a level similar to 
that expected based on pre-exposure trends for the next 
six months (fig 3). Consistent with this pattern, when we 
investigated both a step change and trend change simul-
taneously in a single model, there was evidence that 
immediately after the exposure period, patients were 
more likely to stop statins used for primary prevention 
(odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.39), fol-
lowed by a month on month reduction back towards 
baseline (0.98 (0.97 to 0.99) per month). A similar pattern 
was seen for cessation of statins used in secondary pre-
vention (1.25 (1.02 to 1.53) for immediate step change after 
exposure period and 0.98 (0.97 to 0.99) per month for sub-
sequent month on month trend) (appendix part 8).
We also found evidence that patients were less likely 
to have any recorded risk score in the post-exposure 
period (odds ratio 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.78 to 
0.93) compared with pre-exposure); a similar pattern 
was seen for specific categories of risk score (fig 4).
negative control analysis
We found no evidence of changes in prescribing of 
treatment for glaucoma after the exposure period 
(appendix parts 9 and 10). When we moved the 
 
exposure period to 12 months earlier, the “post expo-
sure” change in statin cessation rates disappeared as 
expected (odds ratio 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.99 
to 1.03) and 1.00 (0.98 to 1.03), respectively, for cessa-
tion in primary and secondary prevention).
impact on public health
We estimated that across the UK there was an excess of 
218 971 patients who stopped taking a statin in the six 
months after the media coverage. When we applied a 
previously estimated restart rate of 66% among patients 
who stopped taking a statin without a statin related 
event,28 we calculated the number of excess cardiovas-
cular events to be at least 2173 within the subsequent 10 
years. Under the most pessimistic assumption that all 
the patients who stopped taking statins did so indefi-
nitely, the estimated number of excess cardiovascular 
events rose to 6372.

Key findings
A period of intense media coverage of statins and their 
side effects was followed by an increase in cessation of 
statins prescribed for both primary and secondary pre-
vention of cardiovascular disease in UK primary care. 
This increase seemed to be temporary, and cessation 
had returned to expected levels after six months.

We also identified that the tendency to stop was higher 
among patients who had used statins for longer and 
among older patients. Among those defined as newly 
eligible to receive statins, we did not observe a change 
in patients’ likelihood of initiating, over and above the 
underlying trend. Further investigation, however, 
showed a marked decrease in the proportion of patients 
having any cardiovascular disease risk score recorded 
after the media coverage, and hence a smaller pool of 
patients whose records met the criteria for initiation of 
statins for primary prevention.
Findings in context of previous research
Our study is the first to attempt to quantify the effects 
of the UK media coverage of statins on prescribing in 
primary care and, to our knowledge, the first study in 
any country to look comprehensively at the effect of 
negative media coverage on rates of statin initiation 
and cessation, in both primary and secondary pre-
vention of cardiovascular disease. A few recent stud-
ies have looked at specific aspects of media impacts 
on statin use. A study in Denmark reported that 
patients newly starting to take a statin were less 
likely to fill a second prescription if there were more 
negative statin related media stories in the period 
immediately after initiation.15 This is consistent with 
our findings that statin cessation rates are affected 
by negative news stories, and, importantly, our 
results suggest a similar effect is detectable even 
among those with longer established use. In Austra-
lia, Schaffer and colleagues reported a 28.8% (95% 
confidence interval 15.4% to 43.7%) increase in the 
discontinuation of statins in the week of the contro-
versial TV programme Catalyst, which was deemed to 
be critical of statins.13  It should be noted that this 
refers to the peak increase in discontinuation at a 
weekly resolution, so is not comparable with our 
odds ratio estimates. In addition, the type, duration, 
and intensity of media coverage differed; neverthe-
less the results are qualitatively consistent with our 
findings. Kocas and colleagues reported that in Tur-
key, as news articles about statins increased from 
2011 to 2013, the percentage of days covered by 
statins decreased (57% (interquartile range 8-83) in 
2011, 58% (17-83) in 2012, and 50% (8-83) in 2013) 
(P=0.01).16  The overarching message is consistent 
with our study, but they focused on trends in statin 
adherence over a three year period. In France, Saib 
and colleagues also reported an increase in the num-
ber of patients that intended to stop statin therapy 
after media controversy,14  but their study was ques-
tionnaire based and no prescribing data were used, 
so, while again consistent with our findings, the 
results are difficult to compare directly with those in 
our study. Finally, consistent with our findings, a 
Dutch study by van Hunsel and colleagues used 
adverse drug reaction reports and found that, after a 
television programme about the benefits and risks of 
statins, there was a transient increase in the number 
of patients reporting reactions, a substantial propor-
tion of whom also reported stopping treatment.29
Further studies have examined the impact of various 
other examples of health related media coverage on 
patients’ behaviour. A 2002 Cochrane review identified 
15 mass media health interventions, and five studies of 
media coverage outside the context of a planned inter-
vention (including coverage of breast cancer surgery 
for a public figure, side effects of drugs, and the disclo-
sure of a sporting personality’s HIV status); all but one 
was associated with a change in health service use in 
the direction expected.30  Several more recent examples 
are also noteworthy. A New Zealand study found that 
media coverage about adverse events after a formula

change in the thyroid drug Eltroxin (levothyroxine; 
GlaxoSmithKline) was followed by an increase in 
adverse event reports to a national medicines monitor-
ing database, most markedly for the specific symptoms 
mentioned in television coverage.31  Data from Austra-
lia suggested that coverage of the singer and actress 
Kylie Minogue’s breast cancer was followed by a six 
week period in which self referral rates for breast can-
cer screening doubled among eligible women who had 
never previously presented for screening,32 33  while UK 
celebrity Jade Goody’s diagnosis of cervical cancer was 
similarly associated with increased attendance for cer-
vical screening,34  an increased incidence of referrals 
for colposcopy, and increased diagnoses of high grade 
cervical neoplasia.35
It is difficult to disentangle whether the changes in 
statin prescribing that we observed were driven by 
changes in the behaviour of physicians, patients, or 
both.36  It is noteworthy that we observed increases in 
cessation rates after the exposure period, but no corre-
sponding decrease in statin initiation. The absence of 
a decrease in initiation rates for primary prevention, 
however, needs to be considered in the context of the 
observed decrease in the number of risk scores 
recorded after the exposure period, both overall and 
within risk strata, which indicates that the widespread 
debate and media coverage on risks and benefits of 
statins could have changed the general discourse 
between GPs and patients about management of risk 
of cardiovascular disease. It is possible that this was 
driven by a change in GP behaviour or by refusal of 
patients to engage with risk scoring for cardiovascular 
disease and discussions about statin use because of 
concerns about the potential side effects, which is a 
known worry for patients.18 Conversations between 
GPs and the most vocally concerned patients might 
have led to a reluctance to carry out risk scores 
because of the known worries surrounding the possi-
ble side effects of statins, leaving only those more 
likely to initiate in the denominator. These apparent 
changes in patterns of recording risk scores might also 
explain the unexpected acceleration in the already 
increasing trend in initiation of statins for primary 
prevention of cardiovascular disease among those 
with a recorded high risk score (appendix 7a). It is per-
haps less surprising that there was no change in 
patients initiating statins for secondary prevention 
after the intense media coverage. After a potentially 
serious cardiovascular event, it is highly likely that a 
patient will be willing to take drugs proved to reduce 
their risk of having a recurrent event, regardless of 
critical media stories and potential side effects.
We observed an increasing tendency to stop taking 
statins as the length of previous continuous prescrip-
tion increased. This might have been driven by imme-
diate concerns about a recent indication for treatment 
(such as a cardiovascular event or high 10 year risk 
score) causing patients to be more reluctant to quit 
their treatment. In comparison, patients whose origi-
nal indication occurred several years in the past 
might be comparatively comfortable to stop treatment 
after witnessing critical stories. Further qualitative 
research exploring attitudes among patients at differ-
ent stages of statin use, however, would be needed to 
confirm this. Another possible explanation for appar-
ent variation in the effect of media coverage is that 
particular groups of people might pay more attention 
to, or be more influenced by, health new stories; this 
might in particular explain why older patients were 
more likely to stop taking statins after the exposure 
period.
strengths and limitations
The CPRD is a large dataset and broadly represents the 
UK population,21 meaning our findings are generalis-
able to the wider population, and we were able to 
detect small effect sizes with great precision. We also 
believe that our populations will be similar to other 
developed populations as the indications for statins 
are broadly the same worldwide. Data were available 
for only a limited number of months after the exposure 
period, limiting the timescale over which we could 
detect effects, but as our analyses suggested that cessa-
tion rates were affected for only up to six months after

the exposure period, this is unlikely to have been an 
important limitation.
Recording of prescriptions in the CPRD is automatic 
at the point of issue and therefore complete, though one 
limitation is that we could not be certain that prescrip-
tions were subsequently dispensed at a pharmacy or 
taken by the patient. The actual proportions of patients 
initiating and stopping taking statins are likely to be 
subject to some measurement error as some patients 
will have initiated or restarted statins after the end of 
the predefined grace periods that we used. Also, if a 
patient began to self manage their prescription by tak-
ing a lower dose, it is possible that we could have incor-
rectly classified them as stopping statins because of 
longer than expected gaps between prescriptions. We 
believe that such error will be minimal because the 
grace periods were specifically selected such that in 
preliminary analyses only a small minority of patients 
went on to start (or restart) a statin after the selected 
times. Furthermore, our definitions for initiation and 
cessation remained the same throughout our study 
period, and it is unlikely that any measurement error 
would have changed after the exposure period and 
affected our main results. We did not capture use of low 
dose over-the-counter statins, which have been avail-
able since 2004, though it seems that uptake has been 
low,37 and there is no reason to think that the high level 
of media coverage would have led people to switch to 
over-the-counter statins.
Interrupted time series cannot confirm a causal link 
between the media coverage and the observed changes 
in the likelihood of stopping taking statins. The design 
avoids confounding by individual level factors such as 
smoking and obesity that are unlikely to vary over short 
term timescales, but it is possible that other external 
factors played a role in the observed changes. We car-
ried out two negative control analyses in an attempt to 
exclude this, using both a different class of drug and a 
different time period, and we found no post-exposure 
changes in either of these analyses, strengthening our 
main finding. Nevertheless, it is still possible that other 
changes in the same time period, unrelated to the media 
controversy and affecting only statin use, could have 
driven the observed results.
If we assume causality, we estimated that increases 
in statin cessation due to the period of media coverage

of side effects could result in at least 2173 excess cardio-
vascular events over 10 years, depending on the propor-
tion of “stoppers” who re-started later. Our calculations 
were based on several assumptions and approxima-
tions and clearly could not take account of future 
changes in statin use and perceptions and other devel-
opments in prevention of cardiovascular disease. Vary-
ing assumptions also lead to substantial changes in the 
outcome, meaning these estimations should be inter-
preted with caution. We also cannot know from our 
data the extent to which patients were appropriately 
informed about the risk:benefit balance of statins and 
whether those who stopped would have been aware and 
accepting of the consequent increases in risk of cardio-
vascular disease. Patients can vary widely in the 
choices that they make about long term preventive drug 
treatment, and some choose not to take drugs that will 
extend their life.38 Finally, we did not attempt to take 
into account any possible benefits of stopping treat-
ment with statins, which might have offset the increase 
in risk.
Conclusion
Controversy over the risks and benefits of statins 
reported in both the medical and popular press was fol-
lowed by a transient increase in patients stopping treat-
ment prescribed for primary and secondary prevention. 
Additionally, a marked reduction in the proportion of 
patients receiving a risk score for cardiovascular dis-
ease suggests other important impacts on GP and/or 
patient behaviour. This research highlights the poten-
tial for widely covered health stories in the media to 
have an effect on real world behaviour related to health-
care and could be used to inform future interactions 
between clinicians, researchers, the academic press, 
and the wider media.
