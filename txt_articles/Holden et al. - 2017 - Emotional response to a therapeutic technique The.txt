Objectives. It has been suggested that savouring positive memories can generate
positive emotions. Increasing positive emotion can have a range of benefits including
reducing attention to and experiences of threat. This study investigated individuals’
emotional reactions to a guided mental imagery task focussing on positive social memory
called the ‘social Broad Minded Affective Coping (BMAC)’ technique. The study examined
possible predictors of individuals’ responses to this intervention.
Method. An internet-based, within-group, repeated-measures design was used. One
hundred and twenty-three participants completed self-report measures of self-attacking
and social safeness/pleasure. They were then guided through the social BMAC.
Participants completed state measures of positive and negative affect and social
safeness/pleasure before and after the intervention. Forty-nine participants took part in
a 2-week follow-up.
Results. It was found that safe/warm positive affect, relaxed positive affect and feelings of
social safeness increased following the social BMAC, whilst negative affect decreased. In
addition, it was found that people scoring higher on inadequate self-attacking benefited most
from this intervention. Changes in affect were not maintained at the 2-week follow-up.
Conclusion. The results provide preliminary support for the efficacy of the social
BMAC in activating specific types of mood (those associated with safeness rather than
drive/reward). This task has potential as part of therapeutic interventions directed at
clinical groups, but further evaluation is needed.

Broad Minded Affective Coping (BMAC; Tarrier, 2010) is an intervention that aims to elicit
positive affect through the use of mental imagery of a positive memory. The BMAC has
been used as a therapeutic technique in a Cognitive Behavioural Suicide Prevention for
Psychosis trial with the aim of reducing threat within therapy sessions, bringing about
change through building positive schemas, increasing sense of agency and reducing
retrieval bias for negative memories (CBSPp; Tarrier & Gooding, 2009; Tarrier et al., 2013,
2014). This technique has been found to increase hope and happiness in individuals with
psychosis (Johnson, Gooding, Wood, Fair, & Tarrier, 2012). Anecdotal evidence has found
the BMAC to be clinically feasible and acceptable (Tarrier, 2010). This study aimed to
investigate individuals’ emotional reactions to the mental imagery of a positive social
memory using the BMAC technique. A secondary aim was to examine possible predictors
of individuals’ responses to this intervention. It was expected that the results would help
to indicate when the social BMAC may be used most optimally in clinical settings, and
what factors may contraindicate its use.
It has been well documented that mental imagery can elicit strong emotional
responses (Holmes & Mathews, 2010; Holmes, Mathews, Mackintosh, & Dalgleish, 2008).
The BMAC technique uses mental imagery to help a person to savour a positive memory
with the aim of eliciting positive emotions. Savouring is thought to generate positive
emotions through attending to a positive event or feelings about a positive event from
either the past, the present, or the hypothetical future (Bryant & Veroff, 2007). The BMAC
aims to bring an individual’s attention to the sensory components and the emotions
associated with the positive memory, as well as eliciting, elaborating and processing
personal meaning held by the individual that may run counter to more negative beliefs.
Increasing positive emotion can have a range of benefits. Positive emotions are associated
with increased mental wellbeing, better physical health and occupational success and
thought to increase access to more psychological resources, broaden potential
behavioural options and reduce attention to, and experiences of, threat (Fredrickson,
2001; Lyubomirsky, King, & Diener, 2005).
The work of Depue and Morrone-Strupinsky (2005) encourages us to look beyond the
unitary positive affect construct and to focus on distinct brain systems when considering
threat regulation. Through examining psychometric and neurobehavioural evidence,
they suggest that positive emotions actually comprise of at least two distinct brain
systems; a dopamine seeking drive-based reward system and an oxytocin-opiate system of
contentment, soothing and safeness. The former is linked to achievement-based emotions
such as excitement whilst the latter is tied to feelings of contentment, safeness, and
warmth. These can be distinguished from negative, threat-based emotions such as fear,
anxiety, anger, and disgust, which are important in that they alert us to danger, and down-
regulate motivations for exploration and pro-social behaviours (Gilbert, 2005).
Gilbert (2005) suggested that the reward, soothing and threat systems form a tripartite
model of affect regulation, each with the potential to down-regulate the other. The system
of contentment, soothing and safeness, or the affiliative system, is the main regulator of
the threat system. This theory is supported by Kelly, Zuroff, Leybman, and Gilbert (2012)
who found that social safeness is an emotional response to affiliation which may then
protect against psychosocial suffering. If this is the case, then savouring positive affiliative
emotions may help to regulate threat.

Natasha Holden et al.
 A well-balanced integration of threat-based and positive-based emotions allows us to
negotiate a complex world of acquiring rewards, gaining and giving care and also
remaining safe from threat (Gilbert, 2012; Le Doux, 1998; Panksepp, 1998). An inability to
down-regulate threat-based emotions can have numerous negative consequences for an
individual’s mental health (Bowlby, 1969; Gerhardt, 2004). Garland et al. (2010) suggest
the down regulation of threat occurs through the stimulation of ‘positive emotions’. In
their review of evidence from behavioural and brain sciences research, they argue that
positive and negative emotional states tend to be self-perpetuating spirals, engendering
more of the same. Hence, feelings of shame may trigger social avoidance and emotion-
consistent appraisals which further maintain these feelings. They suggest that an upward
spiral of positive emotions can counteract the downward spiral of threat-based emotions
that characterize psychopathology. Garland et al. (2010) argue that these positive and
negative emotional states are incompatible, so that stimulated feelings of contentment
and warmth should be able to replace previous threat-based emotions (fear, shame).
Furthermore, they suggest that repeated activation of positive emotions may result in
changes in brain function and structure that confer long-term resilience to negative
emotions and ultimately, emotional difficulties. For example, positive mood has been
linked to activation of reward circuits involving dopamine release in several brain areas
(nucleus accumbens, striatum, cortical and limbic areas; Mitchell & Phillips, 2007), and
the potential plasticity of such circuits has been suggested by observations of change
following long-term use of substances which activate these systems (Garland et al., 2010).
Garland et al. (2010) also suggest that the savouring of pleasant life events is one way that
this could be achieved. Savouring positive emotions through the use of mental imagery
would therefore be expected to boost threat regulation.
Compassion focussed imagery has been found to increase positive affect (Jacob et al.,
2011; Rockliff et al., 2011), decrease negative affect (Jacob et al., 2011; Lincoln,
Hohenhaus, & Hartmann, 2013) and reduce feelings of shame (Kelly, Zuroff, & Shapira,
2009).However,ithasbeenfoundthatindividualswhoaremoreself-criticalfinditharderto
self-soothe when receiving compassionate imagery (Rockliff, Gilbert, McEwan, Lightman,
& Glover, 2008), are more resistant to positive emotions associated with compassion, and
finditmoredifficulttoreceivecompassionateemotions(Duarte,McEwan,Barnes,Gilbert,
& Maratos, 2015; Rockliff et al., 2011). It has been proposed that self-attacking can take
differentformswithdifferentfunctions(Gilbert,Clarke,Hempel,Miles,&Irons,2004).The
function of inadequate self-attacking is thought to be for self-correction, whereas the
function of hated self-attacking is thought to be for self-punishment.
It is thought that experiencing care and soothing from a parent stimulates oxytocin and
endorphins and creates calming feelings that can reduce threat (Carter, 1998). Drawing
from attachment theory (Bowlby, 1969), if a parent is able to soothe their child when the
child becomes distressed, they will stimulate pathways in their child’s brain that will
enable the child to self-soothe later in life (Gilbert, 2009). Individuals who have received
this care would be expected to have a well-developed affiliative system which could
regulate threat. However, if an individual has experienced harsh and punishing
environments, they may have developed a threat system that dampens down affiliative
emotions in order to prevent external attack and will therefore be fearful of compassion
(Gilbert, 2000). This can be seen as an adaptive strategy as the individuals affect system is
adjusting to an environment where they expect harsher treatment from others. However,
operating this way could have longer term negative consequences.
In everyday life people regulate their levels of threat through affiliative interactions and
self-soothing. However, as discussed, some people find it more difficult to self-soothe than
The social BMAC
57
 others, particularly those with higher levels of shame and self-criticism (Gilbert & Proctor,
2006). Fear of compassion is thought to develop as an adaptive strategy when an
individual has experienced harsh or punishing environments early in life or not
experiencing safeness in early attachment relationships, and is also likely to impact on the
ability to self-soothe (Gilbert, 2005). The aim of the social BMAC is to shift attention to
things that happen naturally in people’s lives; to savour positive social interactions with
the aim of decreasing perceived threat. However, for those high in self-criticism or with a
fear of compassion, it is possible that attempts to activate this affiliative system will be
associated with threat. It is therefore important to test empirically how individuals
respond to imagery of a real event and what might predict these responses.
The primary aim of the current study is to investigate individuals’ emotional reactions
to the BMAC technique. It was predicted that there will be a significant increase in feelings
of safeness and warmth following the social BMAC. A reduction in active (drive-related)
positive affect was not, however, expected. It was also predicted that there would be a
significant decrease in negative affect following the social BMAC. Finally, it was predicted
that fear of compassion and self-attacking (inadequate and hated) will be negatively
associated with the degree of change in feelings of safeness and warmth following the
social BMAC. The sensitivity to threat-based emotions is an evolved tendency existing
upon a continuum, and as such within a student sample we expect individual differences
in this regard. This is therefore a suitable population to trial the social BMAC, in particular,
establish what individual characteristics may influence its efficacy. Identifying such
relationships in a student sample is a helpful first step before research into the social
BMAC is extended to clinical groups.
Method
Participants
Participants from a University in the North of England were recruited via an online advert
placed on the University announcement service. Participants who left their contact details
were entered into a draw to win a £150 shopping voucher. Participants were included if
they were aged over 18 years, were able to follow written and verbal instructions, and had
access to a computer with headphones or speakers. Participants were not asked if they
had a clinical diagnosis. Two-hundred and thirty-one participants started the study (151
female, Mage = 24.23 years, SD = 6.84), 155 completed all the pre-task assessments,
whilst 124 completed both pre- and post-task assessments (77 female, Mage = 24.89 years,
SD = 7.95). Mann–Whitney tests did not identify any significant differences between
those who completed all pre- and post-task study measures and those who did not
(n = 32–74; p ≥ .10). Participants were given the option to leave their contact details to
receive a link to a short follow-up assessment 2 weeks later. Forty-nine participants
completed the follow-up assessment (32 female, Mage = 24.39 years, SD = 6.09).
Scores on the study measures were similar to results obtained from other non-clinical
samples (Gilbert, McEwan, Matos, & Rivis, 2011; Gilbert et al., 2004, 2008) for relaxed
affect (M = 14.33 vs. 13.74 here); safe affect (M = 11.07 vs. 10.82 here) fear of
compassion-self (M = 16.12 vs. 13.40 here) fear of compassion from others (M = 15.78
vs. 13.00 here) inadequate self-attacking (M = 16.75 vs. 19.09 here) hated self-attacking
(M = 3.86 vs. 4.09 here), but the current sample had more notably lower levels of active
positive affect (M = 21.14 vs. 14.15 here), negative affect (Crawford & Henry, 2004;
M = 16.00 vs. 7.27 here) and fear of compassion for others (Gilbert et al., 2008;
58
Natasha Holden et al.
 M = 21.18 vs. 14.25 here). These results suggest on the whole a slightly healthier sample,
and may represent location-specific differences since these studies took place in different
locations. Despite the apparently ‘healthier’ scores, there was variability here with some
individuals’ scores suggesting difficulties around affect and self-compassion.
Measures
State positive and negative affect
The Types of Positive Affect Scale (Gilbert et al., 2008) is an 18 item scale rated on a 5-
point Likert scale. The instructions were changed to ask participant how they were feeling
at the moment (e.g., ‘secure’, ‘calm’, ‘active’) and the Likert scale was changed so rather
than measuring trait emotions (0 = not at all like me, 4 = extremely like me) it measured
state emotions (0 = not at all, 4 = extremely). The scale consists of three subscales; active
(e.g., ‘Energetic’, ‘Lively’), relaxed (e.g., ‘peaceful’, ‘calm’) and safe/warm (e.g., ‘Content’,
‘secure’). The internal consistency in the current sample was between a = .86 and .94.
The safe/warm subscale has been found to be the best predictor of alexithymia,
mindfulness and depression when compared to the other subscales, supporting the
distinction between types of positive affect (Gilbert et al., 2011). The negative subscale of
the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) was used to
measure negative affect. This scale consists of 10 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale and
has previously demonstrated high reliability (Crawford & Henry, 2004). The internal
consistency in the present sample was a = .89.
Social safeness
The Social Safeness and Pleasure Scale (SSPS; Gilbert et al., 2009) consists of 11 items
rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Instructions were modified to measure state social safeness
and pleasure. Participants are asked how they feel ‘right now’ (e.g., ‘I feel connected to
others’; 0 = agree, 4 = disagree). Kelly, Zuroff, et al. (2012) provide evidence that Social
Safeness as operationally distinct from positive and negative affect and was more strongly
related to various indicators of vulnerability and psychopathology. The internal
consistency for the state measure of social safeness in the current sample was a = .95.
Self-attacking
The Forms of Self-Attacking and Self-Reassurance Scale (FSCRS; Gilbert et al., 2004) is a 22
item scale rated on a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., ‘I am easily disappointed with myself’). The
scale comprises three subscales (inadequate-self, hated-self and reassure-self). Kupeli,
Chilcot, Schmidt, Campbell, and Troop (2013) confirmed the three sub-scales as the best-
fitting structure in a confirmatory factor analysis and validity was supported by finding that
the FSCRS was associated with depression. Only the inadequate-self and hated-self
subscales are used in this study. The present study demonstrated an internal consistency
of a > .87 for inadequate-self and hated-self subscales in the present sample.
Fear of compassion
The Fear of Compassion Scale (FCS; Gilbert et al., 2011) is a 38 item scale rated on a 4-
point Likert scale. The scale consists of three subscales; expressing compassion for others,

59
 responding to the expression of compassion from others, and expressing kindness and
compassion towards oneself. Internal consistency on the subscales in the current sample
was between a = .88 and a = .94. The FCS has demonstrated expected relationships with
alexithymia, self-criticism, depression, anxiety and stress in healthy samples, supporting
its validity (Gilbert et al., 2011, 2012).
Design
A within-group repeated-measures design was utilized, with participants completing
measures of positive and negative affect at pre-task, post-task and at 2-week follow-up.
Procedure
Ethical approval was granted by the University research ethics committee. An initial pilot
study (n = 10) was conducted in order to ensure that there were no technical difficulties
with the online study and to get feedback on the quality of audio recording, the length of
imagery exercise, and whether the instructions were clear. The general feedback was that
the instructions were clear, the audio quality was good, the pauses in the imagery exercise
were the right length, but that the imagery exercise was too long. In light of the feedback
the relaxation component of the imagery exercise was shortened for the main study.

complete state measures of positive and negative affect, and social safeness/pleasure. The
study took approximately 45 min to complete.
Participants who chose to leave their contact details were contacted via email 2 weeks after
completing the study and with a link to the follow-up study. The follow-up study involved
repeating the state measures of positive and negative affect and social safeness and pleasure.
Data analysis
An analysis of change in affect across the three time periods (pre-, post-task, follow-up)
was undertaken using non-parametric Friedman’s tests due to non-normality in the affect
variables. Bootstrapped paired t-tests (5,000 re-samples) to compared scores across two
time points (pre vs. post). Bootstrapping provides a non-parametric way of generating
Confidence Intervals (CI) and so determining significance (Mooney & Duval, 1993).
60
Natasha Holden et al.
 Analyses of predictors of change in affect were undertaken via multiple linear regression.
As the goal of the BMAC was primarily to produce a change in safe/warm affect and social
safeness we focussed on the predictors of change for these outcomes. The outcome was
either safe/warm affect or social safeness at post-task, with these variables at pre-task
(either safe/warm affect or social safeness depending on the outcome) entered as a
covariate, so that the change in affect was being assessed. The different forms of self-
attacking (inadequate-self, hated-self) and FCSs were then entered as predictors of this
change. CI for regression coefficients were bootstrapped with 5,000 re-samples as
residuals demonstrated a degree of heteroscedasticity. Multicolinearity was not present
(Tolerance > 0.2). BootCI (Bakerman, 2014) was used to calculate bootstrapped (10,000
resamples) percentile CI for the change in R2 associated with subsequent steps in the
regression (Algina, Keselman, & Penfield, 2007).
Results
Emotional reactions to the social BMAC
Friedman’s analysis of variance showed that there was a significant effect of time (pre, post
and follow-up) on relaxed positive affect (p ≤ .01), safe/warm positive affect (p ≤ .01),
social safeness and pleasure (p ≤ .01), and negative affect (p ≤ .01). There was no
significant effect of time on active positive affect (p = .58). These significant effects were
followed-up with bootstrapped pair-wise, paired t-tests, the results of which are reported
in Table 1. It was found that safe/warm positive affect, relaxed positive affect and feelings
of social safeness and pleasure significantly increased from pre-task to post-task (p ≤ .01)
and that negative affect significantly decreased (p ≤ .01). There was no significant change
in any of the measures of affect from pre-task to follow-up, suggesting that change in affect
was momentary and not sustained over time.
Predictors of responses to the social BMAC
Social safeness and pleasure
In the first multiple hierarchical regression analysis, post-task social safeness score was
entered as the outcome variable. The first step, including pre-task social safeness, resulted
in f(1, 121) = 561.52, p < .01, and R2 = .82 (bootstrapped 95% CI: 0.749–0.881).
Including the five predictors (hated-self, inadequate-self, fear of compassion subscales)
made a small but significant improvement in the variance explained by this model,
f(5, 116) = 2.01, p = .08, DR2 = .02 (bootstrapped 95% CI: 0.006–0.047). This was
significant at the a = .05 level for the bootstrapped R2, though not with the traditional
parametric test for change in R2. The regression coefficients and associated CI for all
variables in the regression are reported in Table 2. Notably, inadequate-self was the only
significant predictor of change in social safeness following the social BMAC, with greater
inadequate-self attacking leading to a greater improvement in social safeness, but this was
a relatively small effect.
Safe/warm positive affect
The multiple hierarchical regression analysis was then repeated with post-task safe/warm
positive affect score being entered as the outcome variable. The first step, including
pre-task safe/warm affect, resulted in f(1, 122) = 283.79, p < .01, and R2 = .70

 (bootstrapped 95% CI: 0.592–0.790). Including the three predictors (hated-self, inade-

 The regression coefficients and associated CI for all variables in the regression are
reported in Table 3. Notably, inadequate-self, hated-self and fear of expressing compas-
sion towards others significantly predicted change in safe/warm affect following the
social BMAC, with inadequate-self attacking leading greater improvement, whilst hated-
self attacking and fear of expressing compassion to others led to less improvement in
reported safe/warm affect.
Discussion
The primary aim of this study was to investigate individuals’ emotional reactions to the
mental imagery of a positive social memory using the BMAC technique. It was predicted
that the social BMAC would be associated with improvement in feelings of safeness and
warmth, whilst sadness would decline, and that fear of compassion and self-attacking
(inadequate and hated) would negatively predict improvement in safeness and warmth.
As predicted, the results demonstrated significant, small-to-moderate increases in safe/
warm positive affect and relaxed positive affect and small but significant increases in
feelings of social safeness and pleasure following the social BMAC. There was also a
significant decrease in negative affect. These changes were momentary and not sustained
in the 2-week follow-up period. This is perhaps not surprising considering the brief nature
of the task. Future research looking at more sustained or repeated use of the social BMAC
would be helpful in determining if longer term benefits can be identified. There was no
significant change in active positive affect, which is consistent with the theory that the
social BMAC would tend to operate on specific forms of positive affect. Caution is of
course needed in interpreting these findings as the lack of a randomized control group
means the observed change cannot definitely be attributed to the task. Future studies
adopting control groups are therefore needed. Nonetheless, these results provide
preliminary evidence for the efficacy of the social BMAC.
Gilbert’s (2005) three systems affect regulation model would suggest that the affiliative
system can dampen down the threat and drive system and allow for feelings of social
safeness. The differential stimulation of positive affect systems supports Gilbert’s three
systems theory (Gilbert, 2005, 2009), in that the social BMAC appears to activate the
affiliative system, resulting in momentary increases in safe/warm and relaxed feelings,
which increases feelings of social safeness and decreases negative emotions related to

 threat. These findings are also consistent with previous research that suggests that social
safeness is an emotional response to affiliation (Kelly, Zuroff, et al., 2012). The results
could also be understood in the context of a cognitive model (Beck, 1976); whereby a
positive interpretation of an event (the memory) leads to the experience of positive
emotions. The suggestion that positive emotions broaden attention and reduce focus on
threat may also explain findings (Fredrickson, 2001).
In contrast to predictions, inadequate self-attacking positively predicted greater
improvement in both safe/warm positive affect and social safeness/pleasure. It was
originally predicted that high levels of self-attacking (both forms) develop as a
consequence of an inability to experience affiliative affect. Inadequate self-attacking is
thought to be for self-correction, whereas the function of hated self-attacking is thought to
be for self-punishment (Gilbert et al., 2004). Considering the self-corrective function of
inadequate self-attacking (Gilbert et al., 2004; Gilbert & Irons, 2005), individuals high in
this variable may be seen as striving to achieve and to get things right in order to gain
approval from others. It may be that these individuals engage well with the BMAC because
they are striving to do well. The social BMAC encourages the person to focus on and
savour the positive feeling another has in relation to oneself. It could also be that
individuals high in inadequate self-attacking are receptive to receiving positive regard
from others, even if they struggle to generate this by themselves. As the social BMAC
encourages the person to focus on and savour the positive feelings they receive from
others these individuals high in inadequate self-attacking may still benefit from the task.
In contrast, individuals who self-attack in order to punish themselves (hated-self) and
who fear expressing compassion towards others experienced less safe/warm affect in
response to the task. Both these variables may leave individuals less receptive to signals of
positive regard from others, possibly because they have developed a threat system that
dampens down affiliative emotions in order to prevent external attack (Gilbert, 2000).
These variables did not affect the experience of social safeness. Thus, such individuals may
still be able to savour and enjoy memories of social connectedness but struggle more to
generate a secure and safe affective state. Notably, because these three variables (hated-
self, inadequate-self, fear of compassion) are positively inter-correlated but act in different
ways upon the outcome, there is a suppression effect at play in this analysis (Paulhus,
Robins, Trzesniewski, & Tracy, 2004). As such it may be important for future research to
consider these variables together within statistical models in order to account for such
suppression effects.
It should, however, be noted that these effects were relatively small, explaining only a
small amount of variance in the outcomes. Thus, whilst response to the social BMAC does
appear to vary as a function of these variables, the impact they have, at least in terms of
response to a single BMAC exercise, is still minimal. It may be that with repeated use of the
BMAC, as part of a longer term intervention, the effect that self-attacking styles and fear of
compassion have on change would be more pronounced.
Taken together, these findings could have numerous clinical implications. Tarrier
(2010) has suggested that the BMAC could be used in cognitive therapy with different aims
such as providing a temporary lift in mood which could increase motivation to engage in
activities, improving mood before/after exposure work, and helping to build positive
schema. The social BMAC significantly increased positive affect and feelings of safeness in
this group, although the degree of improvement was less in individuals with more hated-
self attacking and fear of compassion. Clinically, these findings are consistent with
Gilbert’s tripartite model of emotional systems (Gilbert, 2005, 2009), which provides a
basis for formulating a person’s likely response to affiliative affect and critically, how
64

 previous experiences may have led this type of emotion to be conditioned to threat-based
emotions. Before stimulating affiliative affect through use of interventions such as the
social BMAC, it may therefore be helpful for clinicians to use the FCS (Gilbert et al., 2011)
and the forms of self-attacking and self-reassurance scale (Gilbert et al., 2004) to aid them
in this formulation and to decide which intervention would be most appropriate.
A novel aspect of this study was the delivery of the intervention via the internet. The
results provide proof-of-concept evidence for the possibility of delivering an imagery-
based intervention in this way. The idea of internet-mediated psychological interventions
has become an area of increasing clinical and research interest (see review by Barak, Hen,
Boniel-Nissim, & Shapira, 2008). The potential for improving the accessibility of
interventions, and bring interventions out of the therapy room and into individual’s
everyday lives are some of the potential benefits of internet-mediated intervention. Some
have further suggested the potential for online or mobile phone-based interventions to
become individualized to a particular clients need (e.g., adjusting the timing or form of
interventions delivered; Kelly, Gooding, et al., 2012). The social BMAC represents one
specific intervention that could be readily applied via the internet, or incorporated into a
mobile phone application.
A limitation of this study is that a comparison group was not used. It is therefore
unclear whether it was the social BMAC that brought about change or whether it was
some non-specific element of the intervention. It could be that focusing on any sort of
imagery could bring about change in affect. In future research, it would be helpful to have
a comparison group who complete a relaxation imagery exercise to allow for the
exploration of change brought about by the social BMAC above that of relaxation alone. It
would also be useful to evaluate this technique within a clinical group, where problems
around accessing positive social memories and emotions will be more pronounced. As
self-criticism is a trans-diagnostic phenomenon (Gilbert & Irons, 2005), this could be
carried out with various clinical populations such as those with depression, anxiety,
borderline personality disorder, bipolar disorder, deliberate self-harm, or psychosis.
Nonetheless, the current study helps us to establish a proof-of-concept regarding the
social BMAC.
