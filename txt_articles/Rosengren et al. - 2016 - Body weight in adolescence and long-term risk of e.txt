Aims
To study the relation between body mass index (BMI) in young men and risk of early hospitalization with heart failure.
Methods
and results
In a prospective cohort study, men from the Swedish Conscript Registry investigated 1968–2005 (n ¼ 1 610 437; mean
age, 18.6 years were followed 5–42 years (median, 23.0 years; interquartile range, 15.0–32.0), 5492 first hospitaliza-
tions for heart failure occurred (mean age at diagnosis, 46.6 (SD 8.0) years). Compared with men with a body mass
index (BMI) of 18.5–20.0 kg/m2, men with a BMI 20.0–22.5 kg/m2 had an hazard ratio (HR) of 1.22 (95% CI,
1.10–1.35), after adjustment for age, year of conscription, comorbidities at baseline, parental education, blood pres-
sure, IQ, muscle strength, and fitness. The risk rose incrementally with increasing BMI such that men with a BMI of
30–35 kg/m2 had an adjusted HR of 6.47 (95% CI, 5.39–7.77) and those with a BMI of ≥35 kg/m2 had an HR of
9.21 (95% CI, 6.57–12.92). The multiple-adjusted risk of heart failure per 1 unit increase in BMI ranged from 1.06
(95% CI, 1.02–1.11) in heart failure associated with valvular disease to 1.20 (95% CI, 1.18–1.22) for cases associated
with coronary heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension.
Conclusion
We found a steeply rising risk of early heart failure detectable already at a normal body weight, increasing nearly 10-fold
in the highest weight category. Given the current obesity epidemic, heart failure in the young may increase substantially
in the future and physicians need to be aware of this.

Heart failure † Adolescence † Hospital admission † Epidemiology
Heart failure, with a prognosis worse than that of many common
forms of cancer,1 predominantly afflicts the elderly. However, we
have recently documented an increasing incidence of heart failure
in Sweden among persons younger than 45 years, while there was
a fall among those aged 55 years and older.2
An obvious factor that coincides with the increase in heart failure
among the young is a marked rise in body weight and obesity3 in
Sweden and elsewhere. Obesity is a recognized risk factor for heart
failure,4 starting at a high-normal or slightly elevated body mass in-
dex (BMI).5 In a study of Danish male conscripts,6 high BMI was as-
sociated with increased risk of heart failure but because there were
only 106 cases the effect of body weight across a wide range could
not be studied.
The Swedish registry of conscripts contains anthropometric
data on .1.5 million young men. Through linkage to the Swedish
national inpatient registry (IPR), we evaluated all cases of

 hospitalizations for heart failure in relation to their BMI over an
extended period.
Methods and statistics
Participants
In a prospective cohort study, we used data from the Swedish Con-
script registry.7 – 9 Until recently, Swedish law required that all
18-year-old Swedish men enlist. Exemptions were granted only
for men serving time in prison, or with severe chronic medical or
mental conditions (�2–3% each year). From 1968 to 2005, all en-
listed men (n ¼ 1 810 348) underwent standardized physical and
cognitive examinations at six conscription centres, where they
were seen by a psychologist and a physician. After excluding men en-
listing late (aged ≥25 years) (n ¼ 49 208) and men with missing BMI
(n ¼ 150 703), 1 610 437 men were included. The Ethics Commit-
tee of the University of Gothenburg approved the study.
Swedish military service conscription
register data and covariates from other
sources
The 2-day examination involved measurement of weight, height,
and blood pressure in the supine position after 5–10 min of
rest. Height (m) was measured by use of wall-mounted stadi-
ometers, and weight (kg) was measured by use of analogue or
digital scales. Body mass index was calculated as weight/height2.
Cardiovascular fitness was assessed using cycle ergometry.7 The
cognitive performance tests and fitness tests8,9 are described in
Supplementary material online.
The longitudinal integration database for health insurance and la-
bour market studies (Swedish acronym LISA) held by Statistics Swe-
den provided information on parental education (80% coverage).
Follow-up procedures
Sweden has a universal healthcare system that provides low-cost
hospital care to all citizens. Data from the Swedish Military Service
Conscription Register was linked to the Swedish inpatient and death
registries through the Swedish personal identification number.
Definition of heart failure and
comorbidities
Because a large proportion of patients with heart failure had other
primary discharge diagnoses (e.g. cardiomyopathy or congenital
heart disease), a first-ever heart failure diagnosis code in any pos-
ition was accepted. The International Classification of Diseases, Eighth
Revision (ICD-8) was in use from 1968 to 1986, the ICD-9 from 1987
to 1996, and the ICD-10 since 1997. We defined heart failure by
427,00 and 427,10 for ICD-8, 428 for ICD-9, and I50 for ICD-10.
Diagnoses for concomitant or pre-existing comorbidity were in-
cluded up to the point of the heart failure discharge diagnosis and
are listed in the Supplement. We assigned mutually exclusive causes
of heart failure in the following hierarchical order2: (i) congenital
heart disease and valvulopathies, (ii) coronary heart disease
(CHD) and/or diabetes and/or hypertension, (iii) cardiomyopathy,
and (iv) other causes.
Statistical analysis
Incidence rates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were
calculated using Poisson regression. We used Cox proportional ha-
zards models to assess the influence of BMI at the time of conscrip-
tion and potential confounders on a first hospitalization for heart
failure. Subjects were followed from the date of conscription until
the time of (i) first heart failure hospitalization, (ii) death, (iii) emigra-
tion, or (iv) the end of follow-up (31 December 2010) (minimum,
5 years; maximum, 42 years at the time of the last follow-up). To
avoid underestimating the true risk associated with high adolescent
BMI, we refrained from adjusting for follow-up comorbidities such
as CHD, diabetes, or hypertension, conditions which in themselves
are strongly associated with an elevated BMI and constitute steps in
the pathway toward heart failure. The proportional hazard assump-
tions were investigated using tests and plots based on weighted
residuals.10 Diabetes and cardiovascular fitness showed signs of
non-proportional hazards; hence, we stratified the models for these
variables where applicable. Diastolic blood pressure also showed
signs of non-proportional hazards, but further investigation by strati-
fying on quintiles or modelling its interaction with time showed a
negligible effect on the estimates of BMI. Therefore, diastolic blood
pressure was used in the models without any remedial measures.
The year of conscription was modelled as a cubic restricted spline
with four knots placed at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles.11
We used the same approach in the analysis of BMI, where BMI
was constrained to be linear in log hazard at a BMI of ,18 and
.27.5 kg/m2. Age at conscription was modelled as a categorical
variable. To examine how strength, fitness, and IQ at the age of
18 years would impact the association between BMI and risk of
heart failure in adulthood, we included these variables as covari-
ates. Muscular strength, IQ, fitness stanines, and parental educa-
tion were trichotomized as low (1–3), medium (4–6), and high
(7–9). Due to the large number of observations, the P-values
were very small (in all analyses when the 95% confidence interval
was separated from 1, the P-values were ,0.0001) and are there-
fore not reported.
Population-attributable risk, or the association of a specific risk
factor with a specific disease as a proportion of all risk factors for
that disease, was calculated using the method described by Natara-
jan.12 using the hazard ratios from the Cox proportional hazard re-
gression models.
Statistical calculations were performed with SAS version
9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), with the exception of model check-
ing, which was performed with R version 3.2.2 (http://www.
R-project.org).
Results
Study population
Of the 1 610 437 men in the study (mean BMI, 21.9 kg/m2; standard
deviation [SD], 3.1), 79.6% were of normal weight (BMI of 18.5–
25.0 kg/m2), 10.0% were overweight (BMI of 25–30 kg/m2), and
only 2.3% were obese (n ¼ 36 608, of which 7723 had a BMI of
≥35.0 kg/m2) (Table 1). Baseline data for fitness, muscular strength,
IQ, parental education, diagnoses at baseline and during follow-up
are shown in Supplementary material online, Table S1.

 Hospitalizations for heart failure
During follow-up lasting 5–42 years (median, 23.0 years; interquar-
tile range, 15.0–32.0), we identified 5492 incident cases of heart fail-
ure (defined as a principal or secondary discharge diagnosis of heart
failure) at a mean age of 46.6 years (SD, 8.0). Figure 1 shows a slightly
J-shaped association between BMI and heart failure. The lowest risk
was present at a BMI of �20 kg/m2, and a steep linear increase oc-
curred with increasing body weight.
Of the 5492 cases, 704 (12.8%) were associated with congenital
or acquired valvular disease; 2731 (49.7%) with CHD, diabetes, or
hypertension; and 803 (14.6%) with cardiomyopathy. One fourth
of the cases (1255, 22.9%) did not have a registered associated diag-
nosis prior to, or concomitant with, the diagnosis of heart failure.
For all categories, including cases with a principal diagnosis of heart
failure (n ¼ 2576) the two lowest normal weight categories had the
lowest incidence (Table 1). For heart failure overall, these two cat-
egories had a risk of 12.03 and 11.72 per 100 000 person-years, re-
spectively, increasing to 64.18 among men with baseline BMI of
≥35 kg/m2. Supplementary material online, Figures S1A–E, shows
associations between BMI at the time of conscription and heart fail-
ure as a principal diagnosis, or associated with specific causes.
Using low-normal weight (BMI of 18.5–20.0 kg/m2) as the refer-
ence category, a moderate increase in risk was discernible at a slight-
ly elevated normal weight (Table 2). Compared with men with
low-normal weight men with a BMI 20.0–22.5 kg/m2 had an hazard
ratio (HR) of 1.22 (95% CI, 1.10–1.35), after adjustment for age and
year of conscription, comorbidities at baseline, parental education,
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, IQ, muscle strength, and fit-
ness. Men with a BMI of 22.5–25.0 kg/m2 had a corresponding ad-
justed HR of 1.90 (1.70–2.13). Hazard ratio for successively
increasing BMI rose incrementally such that the HR for a BMI of
30–35 kg/m2 was 6.47 (5.39–7.77), while that for a BMI of
≥35 kg/m2 was 9.21 (6.57–12.92). The population-attributable
risk for a BMI of ≥22.5 vs. ,22.5 kg/m2 was 24.0% (95% CI,
21.4%–26.5%) in the fully adjusted model.
Cases associated with CHD, diabetes, or hypertension demon-
strated very high multiple-adjusted HRs of 11.38 (9.01–14.38) for
a BMI of 30 to ,35 kg/m2 and 14.75 (9.64–22.59) for a BMI of
≥35 kg/m2. For heart failure associated with cardiomyopathy, risk
increased to a multiple-adjusted HR of 6.86 (2.93–16.02) for a
BMI of ≥35 kg/m2. The fully adjusted population-attributable risk
for a BMI of ≥22.5 vs. ,22.5 kg/m2 ranged from 9.7 (2.8–17.0),
for heart failure associated with valvular disease, to 33.4 (29.7–
37.0) for heart failure associated with CHD, diabetes, or hyperten-
sion. Associations were similar for heart failure as a main diagnosis
(Supplementary material online, Table S2), but less strong for acute
myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death, and all-cause
mortality. Table 3 shows the HRs associated with heart failure per
1-unit increase in BMI in men with BMI of ≥20 kg/m2, with
multiple-adjusted estimates ranging from 1.06 (1.02–1.11) (valvular
disease) to 1.20 (1.18–1.22) (CHD, diabetes, or hypertension).
Discussion
The present data set enabled us to investigate the association be-
tween body weight across a wide range and early heart failure.
We documented an increase in risk that was almost 10-fold among
the very obese, and detectable already at body weight levels that are
considered to be normal. The effect was broadly similar across our
predefined categories of heart failure, and for heart failure as a main
diagnosis.
Body weight is increasing in Sweden.13 Recent estimates of obes-
ity, which are fairly typical for Europe, are �4% of those ,20 years
of age and just ,20% of adults,14 with considerably higher estimates
of obesity found in other Western countries, such as the USA. In a
study of the present cohort of adolescent men, the prevalence of
moderate obesity (BMI 30.0–34.9 kg/m2) almost quintupled from
the early 1970s and over the next 35 years, while the prevalence
of BMI ≥35 kg/m2 increased 10-fold.3
We found that risk of heart failure started to increase at body
weights that are normal and considered desirable (BMI of 22.5–
25.0 kg/m2). Most studies use a cut-off of 25 kg/m2, which will
underestimate the risk of heart failure associated with elevated
weight. Although high body weight has long been linked to cardio-
megaly, cardiomyopathy, and sudden death,15 these conditions
were thought only to be associated with severe obesity. However,
Kenchaiah et al.16 demonstrated that the risk of heart failure began
to increase at much lower BMI levels, with a 5% and 7% increase in
the risk per 1-unit BMI increase men and women, respectively, who
were middle-aged or older. Our estimate (16% per 1-unit BMI
increase) is markedly higher.
The mechanisms linking obesity to cardiac structural and func-
tional abnormalities are not well understood. A complex interplay
exists between body weight and haemodynamic, neurohormonal,
and metabolic factors as well as inflammation and oxidative
stress.17 –20 These factors contribute to the development of cardiac
hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis,17 and other forms of cardiac dys-
function.18 – 20 Bariatric surgery reportedly dramatically reverses
the disturbances in left ventricular function.21 Importantly, obesity
early in life is not only associated with cardiometabolic risk factors22

 but also with impaired cardiovascular structure and function.23 Even
so, the greatest population burden of heart failure among the
young and middle-aged is driven by the high-normal weight or
overweight categories because these categories are the most highly
represented.
The association between body weight and heart failure was stron-
gest in patients with conditions well known to be associated with
heart failure (CHD, diabetes, or hypertension) and weakest, but still
highly significant, in patients with valvular disease. There was also a
strong association for heart failure attributed to cardiomyopathy, al-
though this is a highly heterogeneous condition.24
With respect to limitations to our findings, diagnoses of heart fail-
ure, and other conditions were collected for administrative reasons,
cases were not formally validated, and there was no data on cardiac
function or other clinical characteristics. Nonetheless, a hospital
diagnosis of heart failure in Sweden has been shown to have high val-
idity, particularly as a main diagnosis,25 and so have other major car-
diovascular diagnoses.26 In our study, risk estimates were similar
regardless of whether cases were assigned a primary diagnosis or
not. In a recent unpublished validation study that we performed
on 964 hospital records with a discharge diagnosis of heart failure
(mean age 78 years) the diagnosis was definite or probable in
94.4%, the most common reason for assigning a probable and not
definite diagnosis being that an echocardiography had not been
done. This would apply in very few cases below the age of 65, where
a careful evaluation of any case of suspected heart failure would be
mandatory. Accordingly, it is unlikely that the strong association that
we found would be due to misclassification of heart failure.

Long-term risk of early heart failure in adulthood

 A second limitation is the lack of information on subsequent
weight development, and on other risk factors in adult life such as
dyslipidaemia. A mildly elevated weight at the age of 18 years might
be a marker of an increased risk of developing subsequent obesity.27
The extent to which weight gain in adulthood contributes to the de-
velopment of early heart failure cannot be established from our
data. A third limitation was that the findings of the present study
are limited to Swedish men and may not be applicable to women
or to other settings. The main strength of the present study is the
uniquely large number of cases occurring at a young age.
In conclusion, we found a steep increase in the risk of early heart
failure associated with increasing body weight starting at levels that
are considered normal. Given the global trend in adolescent over-
weight and obesity, early heart failure might well become a major
threat worldwide, an aspect that has not received much attention
in current prevention guidelines.28 The strong association that we
found between body weight and early heart failure serves to under-
line the urgent need for global action to curb the obesity epidemic.

A 38-year-old man was admitted with vasculitic rash and horizontal diplopia 9 months post allogenic stem cell transplantation for T-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Magnetic resonance (MR) of the orbits showed enlarged extra-ocular muscles and an echocardiogram,
to exclude cardiac embolic sources, showed bi-ventricular hypertrophy and speckled myocardium. A 12-lead ECG showed diffuse T-wave
inversion (Panel 1A). A cardiovascular MR (CMR) showed preserved bi-ventricular systolic function, septal left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy
(max 21mm, normal <12mm) (Panel 1B) with increased LV mass (88 g/m2, normal 48–77 g/m2). Multiple areas of myocardial and pericardial
infiltration (n ¼ 9, largest 18�50mm) were noted on advanced tissue characterisation, showing markedly increased T1 values on native T1
mapping, and non-enhancing after contrast administration (Panel 1C and D, white arrows). The CMR findings raised the suspicion of acute
cardiac involvement of ALL. A MR-guided biopsy of the swollen ocular left rectus muscle confirmed the diagnosis of relapsed acute T-cell
ALL (Panel 2A and B), further supported by evidence of 0.09% T-lymphoblasts on bone marrow flow cytometry and low-level central ner-
vous system (CNS) disease on lumbar puncture. As all the investigations confirmed acute multi-organ ALL relapse (heart, extra-ocular mus-
cles, bone marrow, and CNS), systemic chemotherapy with nelarabine, and intra-thecal cytosine arabinoside were started. Diplopia rapidly
improved, and a repeat orbit MR 14 days after commencement of chemotherapy showed complete resolution of extra-ocular muscle en-
largement. A 1-month repeat CMR to assess cardiac response demonstrated complete resolution of all nodular lesions with normalization
of LV wall thickness (10 mm) and mass (60 g/m2) (Panel 3B, C, and D), and of the widespread T-wave inversion on ECG (Panel 3A).
