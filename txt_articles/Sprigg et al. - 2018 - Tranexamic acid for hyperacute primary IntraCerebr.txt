Summary
Background Tranexamic acid can prevent death due to bleeding after trauma and post-partum haemorrhage. We 
aimed to assess whether tranexamic acid reduces haematoma expansion and improves outcome in adults with stroke 
due to intracerebral haemorrhage.
Methods We did an international, randomised placebo-controlled trial in adults with intracerebral haemorrhage from 
acute stroke units at 124 hospital sites in 12 countries. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 1 g 
intravenous tranexamic acid bolus followed by an 8 h infusion of 1 g tranexamic acid or a matching placebo, within 
8 h of symptom onset. Randomisation was done centrally in real time via a secure website, with stratification by 
country and minimisation on key prognostic factors. Treatment allocation was concealed from patients, outcome 
assessors, and all other health-care workers involved in the trial. The primary outcome was functional status at day 90, 
measured by shift in the modified Rankin Scale, using ordinal logistic regression with adjustment for stratification 
and minimisation criteria. All analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with the 
ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN93732214.
Findings We recruited 2325 participants between March 1, 2013, and Sept 30, 2017. 1161 patients received tranexamic 
acid and 1164 received placebo; the treatment groups were well balanced at baseline. The primary outcome was 
assessed for 2307 (99%) participants. The primary outcome, functional status at day 90, did not differ significantly 
between the groups (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·88, 95% CI 0·76–1·03, p=0·11). Although there were fewer deaths 
by day 7 in the tranexamic acid group (101 [9%] deaths in the tranexamic acid group vs 123 [11%] deaths in the placebo 
group; aOR 0·73, 0·53–0·99, p=0·0406), there was no difference in case fatality at 90 days (250 [22%] vs 249 [21%]; 
adjusted hazard ratio 0·92, 95% CI 0·77–1·10, p=0·37). Fewer patients had serious adverse events after tranexamic 
acid than after placebo by days 2 (379 [33%] patients vs 417 [36%] patients), 7 (456 [39%] vs 497 [43%]), and 90 (521 [45%] 
vs 556 [48%]).
Interpretation Functional status 90 days after intracerebral haemorrhage did not differ significantly between patients 
who received tranexamic acid and those who received placebo, despite a reduction in early deaths and serious adverse 
events. Larger randomised trials are needed to confirm or refute a clinically significant treatment effect.

Introduction
Spontaneous (non-traumatic) intracerebral haemorrhage 
is the cause of up to 20% of all strokes, yet accounts for 
nearly half of all stroke deaths worldwide. Survival after 
intracerebral haemorrhage has not changed for several 
decades,1 and the only intervention that improves 
functional outcome is early intensive blood pressure 
lowering.2
Around a quarter of intracerebral haemorrhages are 
complicated by haematoma expansion, which most often 
occurs within the first few hours, but can occur at up to 
24 h, and is associated with poor outcomes.3–5 Radiological 
markers, including the CT angio 
graphy (CTA) spot sign, 
have been used to try to predict which patients are at 
greater risk of haematoma ex 
pansion.6 Drug therapies 
aimed at limiting haematoma expansion include 
recombinant factor VII, but a meta-analysis of this and 
other haemostatic therapies found no benefit on 
functional outcome.7
In patients with traumatic haemorrhage (including 
from head injuries), tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic 
drug, significantly reduces death due to bleeding and

all-cause mortality, with no increase in vascular occlusive 
events.8 A post-hoc analysis of the CRASH-2 trial showed 
that because death due to bleeding occurred early after 
trauma, timely administration of tranexamic acid was 
necessary for patients to receive any benefit.9 A meta-
analysis of tranexamic acid in traumatic intracranial 
haemorrhage showed that it was associated with a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
subsequent 
intracranial 
bleeding,10 and a larger trial is ongoing.11 Tranexamic 
acid also reduced the number of deaths due to bleeding 
in women with post-partum haemorrhage.12 Use of 
tranexamic acid after acute intracerebral haemorrhage 
has been tested in two small randomised studies,13 
including TICH-1,14 which assessed the feasibility of a 
larger trial. The administration of tranexamic acid was 
feasible and well tolerated.
Therefore, the Tranexamic acid for hyperacute primary 
IntraCerebral Haemorrhage (TICH-2) trial tested the 
hypo 
thesis that intravenous tranexamic acid reduces death 
and dependence when given within 8 h of spontaneous 
intracerebral haemorrhage.
Methods
Study design and participants
TICH-2 was an international double-blind, randomised, 
placebo-controlled, parallel group, phase 3 trial. Partici-
pants were enrolled by investigators from acute stroke 
units at 124 hospital sites in 12 countries: Denmark, 
Georgia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Poland, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK. Ethics 
approval was obtained at each site and country before 
the start of the study. The trial was adopted in the UK by 
the National Institute Health Research (NIHR) Clinical 
Research Network and registered as ISRCTN93732214. 
The full TICH-2 trial protocol and statistical plan have 
been published.15
Adults with acute intracerebral haemorrhage were 
eligible for inclusion if they were admitted to a 
participating hospital within 8 h of stroke symptom 
onset (or time last seen well). We chose 8 h as the 
treatment window for consistency with both of the 
previous trials of tranexamic acid in traumatic intra-
cerebral 
haemorrhage.9 
We 
sought 
to 
include 
participants as quickly as possible because haematoma 
expansion usually occurs in the first few hours after 
intracerebral haemorrhage,3,5 but allowed randomisation 
up to 8 h because some patients present later and 
haematoma expansion can occur up to 24 h.16,17 Key 
exclusion criteria were intracerebral haemorrhage 
secondary to anticoagulation, thrombolysis, trauma, or 
a known underlying structural abnormality; patients 
for whom tranexamic acid was thought to be contra-
indicated; prestroke dependence (modified Rankin 
Scale [mRS] score >4); life expectancy less than 
3 months; and Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 5. 
The complete list of exclusion criteria has been 
published previously.15
Investigators obtained written informed consent from 
each participant if they had the capacity to provide it. If 
participants could not give consent, a relative or re-
presentative gave proxy consent. When consent was 
deferred or given by a proxy, we informed the partici-
pant about the trial as soon as possible and sought 
their consent.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched the Cochrane Stroke Trials register, the Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE Ovid, and 
Embase Ovid for randomised controlled trials of 
antifibrinolytics and tranexamic acid up to Nov 27, 2017, 
using the terms “tranexamic acid” and “exp basal ganglia 
hemorrhage”or “intracranial hemorrhages” or “cerebral 
hemorrhage” or “intracranial hemorrhage, hypertensive”. To 
identify further published, ongoing, and unpublished 
randomised controlled trials we scanned bibliographies of 
relevant articles and searched international registers of 
clinical trials in Nov 27, 2017. We searched for trials in all 
languages. The quality of evidence was assessed with the 
GRADE approach. We found two small randomised controlled 
trials of tranexamic acid with a total of 54 participants, with 
no clear evidence of benefit or harm associated with 
tranexamic acid. Five further randomised controlled trials 
are ongoing.
Added value of this study
TICH-2 is, to our knowledge, the first large multicentre, 
international, randomised controlled trial of tranexamic acid 
in acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. It included 
an older population than in previous tranexamic acid trials 
after trauma and post-partum haemorrhage. Tranexamic acid 
was not associated with any significant improvement in 
functional outcome at 90 days, despite a significant reduction 
in the number of participants with haematoma expansion and 
fewer deaths by days 2 and 7 among those allocated 
tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid was safe, with fewer serious 
adverse events and no increase in thromboembolic events 
compared with placebo.
Implications of all the available evidence
Although there is insufficient evidence to support the routine 
use of tranexamic acid in clinical practice for spontaneous 
intracerebral haemorrhage, the results do not exclude a possible 
small effect. The reductions in haematoma expansion and early 
deaths are promising, but larger randomised trials are needed 
to confirm or refute a clinically significant treatment effect. 
Future research should also investigate which subgroups of 
patients are most likely to benefit.

Randomisation and masking
Randomisation was done centrally in real time. A secure 
website was used to randomly assign all participants 
eligible for inclusion to receive tranexamic acid or 
matching placebo, with 1:1 allocation. The random 
allocation sequence was generated by the trial 
programmer. Randomisation was stratified by country, 
with minimisation for key prognostic factors: age, sex, 
time since onset, systolic blood pressure, stroke severity 
on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
(NIHSS), presence of intraventricular haemorrhage, and 
known history of antiplatelet treatment use immediately 
before stroke onset.
Sharp Clinical Services (Crickhowell, UK) prepared 
individual masked treatment packs containing four 
5 mL glass ampoules of tranexamic acid 500 mg or 
sodium chloride 0·9%, which were made identical in 
appearance by the addition of a heat shrink sleeve. 
Ampoules and the treatment pack were labelled with a 
unique pack number. Sharp Clinical Services stored the 
treatment packs and distributed them to pharmacies 
within trial sites using a web-based sys 
tem of control. 
The pharmacy at each participating site received 
numbered supplies from Sharp Clinical Services. The 
packs were stored at room temperature and protected 
from excessive heat and freezing in a restricted access 
area (more detail is provided in the protocol). The 
randomisation system allocated each participant a 
unique number corresponding to a treatment pack con-
taining either tranexamic acid or placebo. Treatment 
allocation was concealed from all staff and patients 
involved in the trial.
Procedures
The intervention, tranexamic acid, was given intra-
venously as a 1 g loading dose in 100 mL normal saline 
0·9% infused over 10 min, followed by another 1 g in 
250 mL normal saline 0·9%, which was infused over 8 h. 
The comparator was a matching placebo (normal saline 
0·9%), administered with an identical regimen.
At randomisation, investigators recorded the partici-
pants’ age, sex, and medical history, as well as their 
assessment of intracerebral haemorrhage location, intra-
ventricular haemorrhage, and spot sign. Investigators 
assessed prestroke dependence with the mRS, and stroke 
severity using the NIHSS and Glasgow Coma Scale. 
Participants were reviewed at day 2, day 7, and on the day 
of death or hospital discharge, whichever came first, to 
gather information on clinical assessment (NIHSS), the 
process of care measures (eg, blood pressure lowering 
treatment, neurosurgical intervention), and discharge 
date and destination (eg, home or institution).
Adherence was assessed by examining the participant’s 
drug chart and recording the trial treatment administered 
at day 2 (ie, whether all treatment was given, the time 
and date of the two doses, and any other comments). 
Adherence was verified by both central review of the drug 
chart and pharmacies recording returns of residual or 
unused trial medications.
Central assessors, who were trained and certified in 
administration of the mRS and masked to treatment 
allocation, did the final follow-up at 90 days by telephone 
from the coordinating centre in each country. If the 
participant or carer could not be contacted, they received 
a questionnaire covering the same outcome measures 
by post.
Brain imaging by CT was done as part of routine care 
before enrolment; a second research CT scan was done 
after 24 h of treatment to assess haematoma expansion. 
When multiple scans were done, the scan closest 
to 24 h after randomisation was used. Central indepen-
dent expert assessors, who were masked to treatment 
assignment, assessed CT scans for the location of 
the intracerebral haemorrhage using a web-based ad-

judication system. Semi-automated seg 
ment 
ation of the 
intracerebral haemorrhage was done on Digital Imaging 
and Communications in Medicine-compliant images to 
give intracerebral haemorrhage volumes. The user-guided 
three-dimensional active contour tool18 in the ITK-SNAP 
software (version 3.6) was used for segmentation and one 
of three assessors did manual editing as required. All 
assessments were masked to treatment assignment. 
Haematoma expansion was defined as an absolute 
increase of more than 6 mL or a relative growth of greater 
than 33%.
As part of standard routine care, participants received 
blood pressure lowering treatment, neurosurgery, and 
venous thromboembolism prophylaxis as appropriate, in 
accordance with clinical guidelines.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was functional status at day 90, 
as assessed with the mRS, which was administered 
by telephone or postal questionnaire and masked to 
treatment allocation. This scale is a 7-level ordered 
outcome ranked as 0 (no symptoms), 1 (no disability 
despite symptoms), 2 (slight disability but able to look 
after own affairs), 3 (moderate disability but able to 
walk without assistance), 4 (moderately severe disability; 
unable to walk or attend to own bodily needs), 5 (severely 
disabled; bedridden and requiring constant nursing 
care), or 6 (death). It is the most commonly used primary 
outcome in the context of acute stroke trials, and is 
recommended in international guidelines.
Prespecified secondary outcomes included neuro 
logical 
impairment at day 7 or discharge (whichever came first) 
assessed with the NIHSS, health-related quality of life 
measured with EuroQoL-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) health 
utility status and visual analogue scale, activities of daily 
living according to the Barthel index, cognition assessed 
via a modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status-
modified.(TICS-M) and verbal fluency, mood assessed 
with the Zung depression scale (ZDS), costs (length of 
hospital stay and discharge destination), and radiological 
efficacy (change in haematoma volume from baseline to 
24 h and haematoma location). Data on the day 365 
outcomes specified in the protocol are still being collected 
and will be reported separately. 
We prespecified subgroups in the statistical analysis 
plan:19 age (<70 years vs ≥70 years), sex (female vs male), 
time from onset to randomisation (<3 h vs ≥3 h), mean 
systolic blood pressure (<170 mm Hg vs ≥170 mm Hg), 
stroke severity (NIHSS score <15 vs ≥15), presence of 
intraventricular haemorrhage (no vs yes), known history 
of antiplatelet treatment before stroke onset (no vs yes), 
spot sign on CTA (yes vs no), intracerebral haemorrhage 
location (supratentorial deep vs supratentorial lobar), and 
ethnicity (other vs white).
Prespecified safety outcomes were death, venous 
thromboembolism, ischaemic events (stroke, transient 
ischaemic attack, myocardial infarction, acute coronary 
syndrome, peripheral artery disease), and seizures. 
These were reported up to day 90, along with all serious 
adverse events in the first 7 days. Safety outcomes and 
serious adverse events were independently adjudicated 
masked to treatment assignment. Serious adverse 
events were categorised in accordance with the medical 
dictionary for regulatory authorities (MeDRA).
Statistical analyses
The total sample size based on an ordinal primary 
analysis was estimated at 2000 participants, assuming 
significance of 5%, power of 90%, an ordinal odds ratio 
(OR) of 0·79, a distribution of the mRS based on data 
from participants with primary intracerebral haemorrhage 
in the ENOS trial20 (4% had mRS 0, 17% had 1, 16% had 2, 
19% had 3, 24% had 4, 7% had 5, and 13% had 6), increases 
due to loss of follow-up at 5%, and a 20% reduction 
for baseline covariate adjustment. The OR of 0·79 was 
chosen because it lay in the range seen in related trials.10,21 
The effect of tranexamic acid on an unfavourable 
functional status (ie, death, vegetative state, or fully 
dependent requiring attention day and night or dependent 
but not requiring constant attention) had a relative risk of 
0·77 (95% CI 0·59–1·02) when given within 8 h of 
traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage.11
We followed a prespecified statistical plan19 and analysed 
the primary outcome as a shift in the mRS at 90 days,

using ordinal logistic regression with adjustment for the 
stratification and minimisation criteria. We tested the 
assumption of proportional odds with the likelihood ratio 
test. We also did sensitivity analyses of the day 90 mRS 
without adjustment and as a binary outcome (dichotomised 
at mRS 0–3 vs 4–6). Analyses were done in accordance with 
the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, with participants 
kept in the groups to which they were allocated by the 
minimisation algorithm. We defined the ITT group as 
all participants who underwent randomisation. Safety 
outcomes were also analysed in the ITT population.
We analysed prespecified subgroups using ordinal 
logistic regression, with adjustment for the stratification 
and minimisation criteria, to assess the heterogeneity 
of the treatment effect on the primary outcome. We 
analysed secondary outcomes with multiple linear 
regression for continuous outcomes, binary logistic 
regression for binary outcomes, and Cox proportional 
hazards regression for time-to-event data. The nominal 
level of significance for all analyses, including interaction 
testing, was a p value less than 0·05. No adjustment was

order for that participant to be included in the analyses. 
For one participant for whom we did not know if they were 
taking previous antiplatelet therapy before their intra-
cerebral haemorrhage, we assigned the highest risk value, 
which in this case was yes. No other missing values were 
imputed. In case treatment was associated with asymmetric 
effects on death and other outcome measures, an extreme 
value was used in participants who had died before day 90 
for outcomes that do not include death as part of their 
scale (0 for EQ-5D health utility status, –1 for EQ visual 
analogue scale, –1 for TICS-M, and 102·5 for ZDS).
The trial was overseen by a trial steering committee, 
and an international advisory committee consisting of 
each national coordinator. A trial management com-
mittee based at the Stroke Trials Unit in Nottingham, 
UK, was responsible for day-to-day conduct of the trial. 
An independent data monitoring committee reviewed 
the unmasked data every 6 months. Study data were 
collected, monitored, and analysed in Nottingham. The 
trial was done in accordance with the principles of good 
clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing 
of the report. The corresponding author had full access 
to all the data in the study and had overall responsibility 
for the decision to submit for publication. 
Results
Recruitment started on March 1, 2013, and ended on 
Sept 30, 2017, after a 12-month extension was sought 
and approved to enable the trial to reach its target 
sample size. This slower than planned recruitment was 
due to delays in opening trial sites outside the UK. 
Subsequently, recruitment increased, and the Trial 
Steering Committee agreed that the study should exceed 
the target of 2000 and continue until the end of the 
extension. Therefore, a total of 2325 participants were 
recruited from 124 sites in 12 countries over 55 months. 
1161 participants were randomly assigned to receive 
tranexamic acid and 1164 to receive placebo.
Most participants were recruited in the UK (1910 [82%] of 
2325; appendix). The mean age was 68·9 years (SD 13·8) 
and 1301 (56%) participants were male (table 1). The 
median time from stroke onset to randomisation was 
3·6 h (IQR 2·6–5·0) and 833 (36%) participants were 
recruited within 3 h. Mean baseline systolic blood 
pressure was 173 mm Hg (SD 27·5) and diastolic blood 
pressure was 93 mm Hg (18·4). 1371 (59%) participants 
had a haematoma that was deep and supratentorial, 
whereas 738 (32%) had one that was lobar and 
supratentorial; 745 (32%) participants had intraventricular 
haemorrhage. Mean haematoma volume was 24·0 mL 
(SD 27·2) and median haematoma volume was 14·1 mL 
(IQR 5·9–32·4). Contrast-enhanced imaging in the form 
of CTA was done in 249 (11%) participants. Of these 
individuals, 24 (20%) of 121 in the tranexamic acid group 
and 32 (25%) of 128 in the placebo group were spot 
positive. Treatment groups were well balanced at baseline 
(table 1).
Adherence to per protocol treatment for the allocated 
treatment was high: 2207 (95%) of 2325 participants 
received all of their randomised treatment, where 
as 
only 15 (1%) received no treatment (appendix). Ad-
herence did not differ between the groups. The median 
time from randomisation to treatment was 21 min 
(IQR 13–33).
The primary outcome of mRS at day 90 was assessed 
in 2307 (99%) of 2325 participants; nine (<1%) were lost 
to follow-up and nine (<1%) withdrew from their 
day 90 follow-up (figure 1). There was no difference in 
the distribution (shift) in the mRS at day 90 after 
adjustment for stratification and minimisation criteria, 
with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0·88 (95% CI 
0·76–1·03, p=0·11; table 2 and figure 2). A formal 
goodness-of-fit test showed no evidence that the 
proportional odds assumption was violated (p=0·97). In 
a sensitivity analysis, we detected no difference between 
the groups in the proportion of participants who were 
dead or dependent at day 90 (mRS >3) and the aOR was 
0·82 (95% CI 0·65–1·03, p=0·08; table 2).
When the primary outcome was assessed in pre-
specified subgroups (figure 3), the only significant inter-
action was between mRS and baseline systolic blood 
pressure (interaction p=0·0188), such that partici 
pants 
with a baseline systolic blood pressure less than or equal 
to 170 mm Hg had a favourable shift in mRS with 
tranexamic acid compared with those with a systolic 
blood pressure greater than 170 mm Hg. There was 
no heterogeneity of treatment effect by time of 
administration (figure 3), whether dichotomised as less 
than 3 h versus 3 h or longer (interaction p=0·75) or as 
less than 4·5 h versus 4·5 h or longer (interaction 
p=0·28); similarly, there was no interaction between 
treatment effect and time when analysed as a continuous 
variable (aOR 0·98, 95% CI 0·90–1·07, p=0·69).
Fewer participants had haematoma expansion at 
day 2 in the tranexamic acid group (265 [25%] of

placebo 
group 
(304 [29%] of 1058 participants; aOR 0·80, 95% CI 
0·66 to 0·98, p=0·0300). The mean increase in 
haematoma volume from baseline to 24 h was also less 
in the tranexamic acid group (3·72 mL, SD 15·9) than 
in the placebo group (4·90 mL, 16·0; adjusted mean 
difference –1·37, 95% CI –2·71 to –0·04, p=0·0432). 
Neurological impairment (mean NIHSS score at day 7) 
did not differ between the tranexamic acid group and 
placebo group (adjusted mean difference –0·43, 95% CI 
–0·94 to 0·09; p=0·10).
There were no significant differences in any of the 
day 90 functional outcomes between treatment groups—
ie, activities of daily living, mood, cognition, or quality of 
life (table 2). Length of hospital stay and discharge 
disposition did not differ between treatment groups 
(table 2).
By day 7, fewer patients had died in the tranexamic acid 
group (101 [9%] of 1161) than in the placebo group 
(123 [11%] of 1164; table 2). However, the numbers of deaths 
by day 90 did not differ between the tranexamic acid 
group (250 [22%] patients) and the placebo group 
(249 [21%] patients; table 2). Survival did not differ between 
the treatment groups over 90 days (adjusted hazard 
ratio 0·92, 95% CI 0·77–1·10, p=0·37; appendix).

(521 [45%] vs 556 [48%], p=0·0393; appendix). There 
was no increase in venous thromboembolic events 
(39 [3%] patients in the tranexamic acid group vs 
37 [3%] in the placebo group; p=0·98) or arterial 
occlusions 
(myocardial 
infarction, 
acute 
coro-
nary syndrome, or peripheral arterial occlusion) in the 
tranexamic acid group compared with the placebo group 
(appendix). Seizure was the most common safety 
outcome (77 [7%] patients in the tranexamic acid group 
vs 85 [7%] in the placebo group) and nervous system 
disorders were the most common serious adverse 
events (149 [13%] vs 163 [14%]), followed by infections 
(98 [8%] vs 116 [10%]). 
Discussion
In this trial of tranexamic acid versus placebo after acute 
intracerebral haemorrhage, there was no significant 
difference between the groups in the primary outcome of 
functional status at day 90. However, in the tran 
examic 
acid group, we detected significant reductions in 
the prespecified secondary outcomes of early death, 
haematoma expansion, and serious adverse events, con-
sistent with tranexamic acid having an antifibrinolytic 
effect after intracerebral haemorrhage.
Tranexamic acid was associated with a small but 
significant reduction in haematoma expansion and 
smaller haematoma volumes, key factors that are known 
to affect outcomes after intracerebral haemorrhage.4,6 
However, the small reduction in haematoma volume 
(1·37 mL smaller in the tranexamic acid group than in 
the placebo group) might have been insufficient to 
translate into improved functional status in this 
population.
One explanation for our findings could be that the 
anticipated treatment effect (OR 0·79) was too large, which 
the trial was unable to detect. Indeed, previous randomised 
controlled trials of tranexamic acid in other settings have 
enrolled more than ten times the number of participants 
to identify smaller effects on bleeding-related deaths 
after trauma (OR 0·85)8 and post-partum haemorrhage 
(OR 0·81).12 Furthermore, the find 
ings of an individual 
patient data meta-analysis of 40 138 participants have 
subsequently shown that it is necessary to start tranexamic 
acid within 3 h of the start of bleeding to receive any benefit 
in other conditions.14
We found no evidence of an increase in serious 
adverse effects with tranexamic acid; notably, there was 
no increase in venous thromboembolism in this signifi-
cantly older population with more comorbidities than

participants in previous studies of tranexamic acid.8,12 It 
is therefore unlikely that any potential benefit of 
tranexamic acid was offset by harm, as has been 
suggested with recombinant factor VIIa.22 In a 
phase 3 trial, there was no evidence of clinical benefit 
from recombinant factor VIIa, which was associated 
with a reduction in haematoma expansion but an 
increased risk of arterial occlusive events.22 Although 
tranexamic acid and recombinant factor VIIa are both 
haemostatic agents, tranexamic acid acts through 
antifibrinolytic mechanisms and recom 
binant factor 
VIIa is a procoagulant, so they have different risk-
benefit profiles.
To date, the only intervention to improve functional 
outcome after intracerebral haemorrhage is early 
intensive blood pressure lowering.2 Although no signifi-
cant effects on haematoma growth were detected in 
INTERACT-2,2 secondary analysis suggested that blood 
pressure lowering did attenuate bleeding in a dose-
dependent manner.23 The interaction between baseline 
systolic blood pressure and treatment in our study 
suggests that participants with lower blood pressure 
were more likely to benefit from tranexamic acid. This 
finding could have been confounded by stroke severity, 
given that larger haematomas have increased blood 
pressure and worse outcomes.21,24
Baseline haematoma volume is the strongest pre-
dictor of outcome after spontaneous intracerebral 
haemorrhage, and in an exploratory post-hoc analysis, 
participants with a baseline haematoma volume of 
between 30 mL and 60 mL who received tranexamic acid 
seemed to have better outcomes (figure 3). Although this 
finding could be due to chance, it is also compatible 
with the notion that patients with moderately sized 
haematomas might be more likely to benefit from 
tranexamic acid, and hence could be targeted for future 
studies, as has been postulated with recombinant 
factor VIIa.21,22
The strengths of this study include its double-
blinding, allocation concealment, low risk of bias, high 
adherence to treatment, and very few missing data on 
primary outcomes. Treatment groups were well 
balanced for baseline factors. The use of approved brief 
and proxy consent processes allowed the rapid 
enrolment of patients without the capacity to consent, 
which is important to avoid bias in acute stroke studies. 
Our inclusion criteria were deliberately broad to reflect 
the clinical population and to facilitate recruitment 
from multiple international sites. Nevertheless, most 
participants were recruited from the UK. The study had 
several other limitations. We did not collect screening 
logs so are unable to present data on eligibility. Wide 
inclusion criteria led to a heterogeneous population 
with more severe strokes, larger haematoma volumes, 
and a greater proportion of lobar haematomas and 
intraventricular haemorrhage than populations in other 
intracerebral haemorrhage trials,2,21,22,25 which could have 
diluted any potential treatment effect. Finally, despite 
efforts to ensure rapid treatment, most participants 
were enrolled more than 3 h after the onset of 
intracerebral haemorrhage, which could explain the 
absence of a significant interaction with time in the 
subgroup analysis.
Several smaller randomised controlled trials of 
tranexamic acid in intracerebral haemorrhage are 
ongoing (STOP-MSU [NCT03385928], STOP-AUST 
[NCT01702636], TRAIGE [NCT02625948], TRANSACT 
[NCT03044184], and TICH-NOAC [NCT02866838]; total 
enrolment is fewer than 1000 participants across the 
trials), and a meta-analysis of individual patient data is 
planned.26 Future trials would need to enrol far more 
patients to allow the detection of a small treatment effect, 
or enrich their population with patients at greatest risk of 
haematoma expansion, primarily by treating patients 
earlier.27 Although patients presenting early are at greater 
risk of haematoma expansion, they also have more severe 
strokes and larger haematoma volumes.24 Identification 
of patients most likely to benefit from haemostatic 
therapy on the basis of factors other than time of onset 
has been suggested,28 but enrichment with the CTA spot 
sign has yet to be successful.29
In summary, tranexamic acid did not affect functional 
status at day 90, although potential benefits were 
seen with reductions in haematoma expansion, early 
death, and serious adverse events. The observed effect 
size was smaller than anticipated and is compatible with 
a lack of efficacy or the presence of a smaller treatment 
effect than expected. Future re 
search should investigate 
which subgroups of patients might benefit. Tranexamic 
acid is inexpensive, easy to administer, seems to be safe, 
and is widely available, so even a modest treatment effect 
could have an important impact on the global scale. 
Larger randomised trials are warranted.
