IMPORTANCE There have been concerns raised by patients and regulatory agencies regarding
serious psychiatric adverse effects associated with 5α-reductase inhibitors.
OBJECTIVE To determine if there is an increased risk of suicide, self-harm, or depression
among older men starting a 5α-reductase inhibitor for prostatic enlargement.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A population-based, retrospective, matched cohort
study using linked administrative data for 93 197 men ages 66 years or older (median [IQR]
age, 75 [70-80] years) in Ontario, Canada, who initiated a new prescription for a
5α-reductase inhibitor during the study period (2003 through 2013). Participants were
matched (using a propensity score that included 44 of our 96 covariates that included
medical comorbidities, medication usage, and health care system utilization) to an equal
number of men not prescribed a 5α-reductase inhibitor.
EXPOSURES Duration of finasteride or dutasteride usage.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide. Secondary outcomes were self-harm and
depression.
RESULTS Men who used 5α-reductase inhibitors were not at a significantly increased risk of
suicide (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.53-1.45). Risk of self-harm was significantly increased during the
initial 18 months after 5α-reductase inhibitor initiation (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.34-2.64), but not
thereafter. Incident depression risk was elevated during the initial 18 months after
5α-reductase inhibitor initiation (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.73-2.16), and continued to be elevated,
but to a lesser degree, for the remainder of the follow-up period (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08-1.37).
The absolute increases in the event rates for these 2 outcomes were 17 per 100 000
patient-years and 237 per 100 000 patient-years, respectively. The type of 5α-reductase
inhibitor (finasteride or dutasteride) did not significantly modify the observed associations
with suicide, self-harm, and depression.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a large cohort of men ages 66 years or older, we did not
demonstrate an increased risk of suicide associated with 5α-reductase inhibitor use.
However, the risk of self-harm and depression were increased compared with unexposed
men. This is in keeping with postmarketing experience and patient concerns, and
discontinuation of the medication in these circ umstances may be appropriate.

B
enign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a major contribu-
tor to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in older
men. Symptoms are found in approximately one-
quarter of men over 70 years.1 Guidelines from American, Ca-
nadian, and European urology societies recommend a 5α-
reductase inhibitor (5ARI) as medical therapy for BPH related
LUTS.2-4 As a medication class, 5ARIs target the 5α-reductase
enzyme family, which is responsible for transforming steroid
precursors into active hormones.5 This includes the conver-
sion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which accounts
for the use of 5ARIs for androgenic alopecia and BPH.5 Among
BPH patients, 5ARIs reduce prostate volume, LUTS, and fu-
ture BPH-related complications and surgery.6,7 There are 2
equally efficacious 5ARI medications available for the treat-
ment of BPH8: finasteride (which inhibits type 2 5α-
reductase)anddutasteride(whichinhibitsbothtype1andtype
2 5α-reductase).
The potential adverse neurologic effects of these medica-
tions are an emerging area of concern. In 2011 the United States
FoodandDrugAgency(FDA)receivedapostmarketingsubmis-
sion suggesting that self-harm and suicide may be associated
with finasteride use, and may persist after discontinuation of
the medication.9 Health Canada recently identified similar
concerns.10AnanalysisoftheFDAAdverseEventReportingSys-
temfoundadisproportionatelyhighrateofsuicidalideationre-
ported among men taking finasteride for alopecia.11 Postmar-
keting experience resulted in the addition of depression to the
5ARIproductmonographs.Twopriorclinicalstudies12,13(asec-
ondaryanalysisofarandomizedtrialandacross-sectionalstudy
of patients with BPH) suggested there is an increased risk of de-
pression associated with 5ARI use. There is ancillary evidence
supporting a potential relationship between 5ARIs and suicid-
alityordepression.First,5α-reductaseisresponsibleforthepro-
duction of several neuroactive steroids.5,14 Second, testoste-
rone and dihydrotestosterone modulate the neuroendocrine
stress response and are inversely related to depression
indices.15-18 Third, levels of the neurosteroid allopregnano-
lone (produced by 5α-reductase) are lower among men with
depression.19,20 Finally, patients with clinical depression have
lower levels of type I 5α-reductase in the prefrontal cortex.18
To date, very little research has assessed the potential risks
of suicidality and depression from 5ARI medications, despite
concerns from regulatory agencies and plausible underlying
biologic mechanisms. Our objective was to conduct a popula-
tion-based retrospective study among older men to assess for
a potential relationship between 5ARI use and suicide, self-
harm, and depression.
Methods
Design and Setting
We conducted a retrospective, matched-cohort study using ex-
isting population-based data from the province of Ontario in
Canada. Patient-level data was linked using unique encoded
identifiers and analyzed at the Institute for Clinical Evalua-
tive Sciences. A deterministic, patient-level record linkage pro-
cess was used. Ontario is Canada’
s largest province (popula-
tion of 12.9 million people at study midpoint) and the entire
population has access to a single health care system. Univer-
sal medication coverage is provided for those 65 years or older.
This study was approved by the institutional review board at
Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, and in-
dividual patient consent was not required. The study proto-
col is included in Supplement 1. Study reporting follows the
STROBE/RECORD guidelines for observational studies using
routinely collected data (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).21
Data Sources
We used several administrative data sources for this study: (1)
Registered Persons Database (containing vital statistics),22 (2)
OntarioDrugBenefitdatabase(containingallprescriptiondrug
use for Ontarians older than 65 years),23 (3) Canadian Insti-
tute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database (iden-
tifying all inpatient admissions and procedures, and inpa-
tient psychiatric care prior to 2005),24 (4) National Ambulatory
Care Reporting System (identifying all emergency depart-
ment encounters),25 (5) Ontario Health Insurance Plan (con-
taining all physician billing and diagnostic codes for patient
assessment or treatment),26 (6) Ontario Registrar General-
Death database (containing the manner and cause of death),27
and (7) Ontario Mental Health Reporting System (containing
records of all inpatient psychiatric care from 2005 onwards).28
Our study variables were complete, aside from less than 0.4%
missing data for socioeconomic status and rurality (these pa-
tients were retained for analysis).
Patient Population
Using the unique drug identification numbers in the Ontario
Drug Benefit Database (which has greater than 99% accuracy
in prior validation studies)23 we identified a cohort of men
66 years or older who filled their first prescription for finas-
teride or dutasteride between January 1, 2003 and December
30, 2013 (exposed men). The prescription fill date was con-
sidered the index date for the patient, and the beginning of
the observation period. All remaining men in the province of
Ontario during the study period (unexposed men) were
assigned a random index date based on the distribution of
index dates among the exposed men. Within both groups,
Key Points
Question Is the use of 5α-reductase inhibitors for the treatment
of benign prostatic hyperplasia associated with a risk of suicide,
self-harm behavior, or depression?
Findings Using a matched cohort design and population-based
data, 5α-reductase inhibitors were not found to be associated with
an increase in suicide. However, the risk of self-harm and
depression were significantly increased, primarily during the first
18 months after initiation of the medication.
Meaning The risk of self-harm and depression should be
considered when prescribing 5α-reductase inhibitors. In patients
presenting with thoughts or evidence of self-harm, or with a new
diagnosis of depression, the continued use of this medication
should be reevaluated.

we conducted standard data cleaning steps, and then
excluded men who had used a 5ARI in the 2 years prior to
2003, those who used multiple 5ARIs on their index date,
those who were younger than 66 years, those without any
prescription in the prior 3 months in the Ontario Drug Ben-
efit Database, and those who were in hospital or visited an
emergency department in the 2 days prior to the index date
(to limit the potential confounding of serious concurrent
medical illness). Further details are shown in eFigure 1 in
Supplement 2.
We matched men with a 5ARI prescription to those with-
out any 5ARI prescriptions, based on their index date (within
1 year), a history of depression or self-harm in the 5 years prior
to the index date, evidence of antidepressant medication us-
age in the 6 months prior to the index date, and the logit of a
propensity score. We assessed 96 different covariates, repre-
senting medical and psychiatric comorbidities, medication us-
age, and health care utilization (coding definitions and look-
back windows are detailed in eTable 2A-C in Supplement 2).
Qualitative variables were analyzed as categorical variables.
Among the 96 measured covariates, 44 were selected for in-
clusion in the propensity score based on standardized differ-
ences of 7% or greater or a high likelihood of confounding (fur-
ther details in eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Study Outcomes
We prespecified suicide as our primary outcome. Our a priori
hypothesis was that suicide would be significantly higher
among men exposed to 5ARIs. All cases of unnatural death in
Ontario are investigated by a coroner (who is a licensed phy-
sician); deaths with clear evidence of suicidal intent29 are reg-
istered as a suicide on the death certificate by the coroner and
enteredintheOntarioRegistrarGeneral-Deathdatabase.There
is good inter-rater agreement among Ontario coroners for rel-
evant mechanisms of suicide.30 Our secondary outcomes were
self-harm, and incident depression (determined using a vali-
dated definition).31 Self-harm included both emergency de-
partment visits for a suicide attempt or parasuicide behavior,
and psychiatric hospital admission for recent self-harm or
thoughts of self-harm. To identify incident cases of depres-
sion, patients with an existing history of depression in the 5
years prior to the index date were excluded for the analysis of
thisoutcome.Detailsofthedatasources,diagnosticcodes,and
validity of these outcomes are presented in eTable 4 in
Supplement 2.
We observed patients for our study outcomes during an
at risk period, which was defined as continuous medication
usage plus 12 months. Continuous usage started on the day the
prescription was filled, and continued for the prescription du-
ration; it was extended for the duration of each follow-up pre-
scription that was filled within 1.5 × the number of days of pre-
vious prescription supply.32 The 12-month post-5ARI period
was included owing to the possible persistence of symptoms
after the discontinuation of the 5ARI medication.33,34 Pa-
tients were allowed to switch among 5ARI medications dur-
ing this at risk period, and on discontinuation of the 5ARI the
patient was not reentered in the cohort if they restarted a 5ARI
in the future.
Statistical Analysis
Baselinecharacteristicswerecomparedusingstandardizeddif-
ferences (SD); an SD greater than 10% was considered a po-
tentially important difference.35 We used greedy matching (1:1
without replacement) and a caliper of 0.2 standard devia-
tions of the logit of the propensity score.36
Our primary analysis was completed using SAS statistical
software (version 9.4, SAS institute). Stratified Cox propor-
tional hazards models were used to account for matching and
to censor matched pairs based on the end of the at risk pe-
riod, or when either member of the pair reached a specified
outcome, died, emigrated from the province, or reached the
end of the study period (December 31, 2013). The Cox propor-
tional hazards model assumption of proportionality was as-
sessed statistically using a time-dependent covariate, and
graphically using Schoenfeld residuals. When proportional-
ity was violated, the model was stratified based on fixed time
periods after the index date so that proportionality was re-
stored. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs are reported (and the
SAS program and output for the primary analysis is included
in the eAppendix in Supplement 2), as well as absolute risk.
Secondary outcomes were assessed using similar methodol-
ogy. Three preplanned secondary analyses were conducted.
First, we included probable suicide cases in the primary out-
come definition (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). Second, 3 poten-
tial effect modifiers were assessed (prior depression, prior self-
harm, and recent antidepressant usage). Finally, results were
stratified by type of 5ARI. The statistical significance of the lat-
ter 2 secondary analyses was assessed by adding an interac-
tion term in the model. Two posthoc analyses were per-
formed: outcome models were repeated after matched pairs
with a history of prostate cancer (a potential confounder)37
were excluded, and a competing risk model (using Fine and
Gray’
smethod)38fornonsuicidemortalitywasusedforourpri-
mary and secondary outcomes. For all analyses, we consid-
ered 2-tailed P values less than .05 statistically significant.
Results
Cohort selection is presented in eFigure 1 in Supplement 2. Af-
ter matching we retained 93 197 pairs. Baseline characteris-
tics of the matched exposed and unexposed men that are par-
ticularly relevant to our study are presented in Table 1
(complete covariates are presented in eTable 5 in Supplement
2). Acknowledged risk factors for suicide in the elderly,39,40
such as mental illness, chronic medical conditions (seizure,
neurologic disease, cancer), depression, substance abuse, and
prior self-harm episodes were very well balanced between co-
horts, and no standardized differences greater than 8% per-
sisted in our final matched cohort for any of the covariates. The
index 5ARI was dutasteride for 48 505 (52.0%), and finaste-
ride for 44 692 (48.0%) of men. Dosage, duration of use ,and
index prescriber specialty are described in eTable 6 in
Supplement 2.
The absolute risk of suicide was very low in both exposed
and unexposed men (0.04%), and there was no significantly
increased HR among men exposed to 5ARI medications (HR,

cide cases identified only a few additional outcomes, and did
not change our model results significantly.

pression violated our statistical test and graphical assess-

for self-harm was not significantly elevated after the initial 18
months, whereas the hazard for depression was lower in
magnitude but still significantly elevated for the remainder
of the follow-up period (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.08-1.37). The

by 5ARI use, are included in eFigure 3 in Supplement 2. The

self-harm outcome represented an actual suicide attempt or
parasuicide behavior in 58% (75/130) of unexposed men and
57%(96/169)ofexposedmen.Whenconsideringonlythissub-
set of self-harm patients, the HR during the first 18 months was
still significantly increased (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.04-2.48;
P = .03). Of the men with self-harm during the study period,
6.9% (9/130) unexposed and 5.9% (10/169) exposed men later
died of suicide during our defined at risk period.
In our secondary analysis, the potential effect modifiers
did not have a significant statistical interaction with our pri-
mary outcome of suicide (prior history of depression, P = .32;
activedepression,P = .56)(eTable7inSupplement2).Theprior
self-harm subgroup was too small to fit to a statistical model.
Stratification of our primary and secondary outcomes by ini-
tial type of 5ARI did not reveal any significant differences in
the primary or secondary outcomes (Table 3). Posthoc, the
model excluding men with a prior history of prostate cancer
(eTable 8 in Supplement 2), and the model accounting for the
competingriskofnonsuicidemortality(eTable9inSupplement
2) both had similar results to our primary analysis of suicide,
self-harm and depression.
Discussion
We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study
of approximately 186 000 men ages 66 years or older to as-
sess for concerning psychiatric problems potentially associ-
ated with 5ARIs. We did not demonstrate a significant in-
crease in the risk of suicide among older men using 5ARIs for
BPH,andpriordepressionorantidepressantusedidnotmodify
this result. The rate of suicide among men exposed to 5ARIs,
and similar men not exposed to 5ARIs was approximately 15
of100 000personyearsinbothgroups(inkeepingwithayearly
suicide rate of 19 of 100 000 Ontario males ages 60 or older).41
However, we did demonstrate a significantly increased risk of
self-harm (for the initial 18 months after initiation of a 5ARI),
and new diagnoses of depression (throughout follow-up)
among men exposed to 5ARI medications. The initial in-
creased risk, which attenuates for both outcomes after 18
months, is in keeping with an acute change associated with the
initiation of a 5ARI. These significant differences were con-
sistent among both the finasteride and dutasteride users. De-
pression in elderly persons is associated with reduced func-
tioningandqualityoflife,increasedhealthcareutilization,and
a chronic and relapsing course.42,43 Although the absolute risk
of self-harm is low, this is still potentially important given the
increasing rate of self-harm in adults,44 the high costs associ-
ated with subsequent treatment,45 and the strength of this as
a risk factor for future self-harm and suicide.46,47 Several theo-
ries have been proposed to explain the transition from self-
harm thoughts to self-harm behavior to completed suicide.48
Because we only measured outcomes with a temporal rela-
tionship to 5ARI use, the discontinuation of the 5ARI may have
occurred prior to some men dying from suicide, or this may
havepreventedfurtherself-harm.Alternatively,theremayhave
beeneffectiveinterventionsafteranepisodeofself-harmwhich
reduced the risk of progression to suicide.
Two secondary analyses of a randomized, placebo-
controlledclinicaltrial49evaluatingfinasterideforprostatecan-
cer prevention are relevant to our study. Moinpour et al50 dem-
onstrated that there was no difference in mental health
domains over 7 years of finasteride use, however when Unger
et al12 linked a subset of trial patients to Medicare claims, they
found a modest increase in depression among the finasteride
users (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.19). A cross-sectional survey13
of 4035 Polish men with BPH measured a 1.5 fold increased fre-
quency of depressive symptoms among men using 5ARIs. The
majority of other research in this area focuses on young men
taking finasteride for alopecia. A case series51 in 2002 re-
ported on 19 patients with alopecia who developed moderate
to severe depression with finasteride use. Among men who

sought treatment for persistent adverse effects after the dis-
continuation of finasteride, 1 mg, there were high rates of de-
pression, and suicidal thoughts, although there is an obvious
selection bias in these studies, and some of these findings may
be explained by preexisting psychiatric problems.33,34,52
Strengths and Limitations
We used a retrospective, matched-cohort design and mea-
sured 96 relevant covariates, of which 44 were included in a
propensity score. We carefully considered the validity of our
primary and secondary study outcomes (eTable 4 in
Supplement 2), and censored patients to limit their risk pe-
riod to ensure there was a temporal association between our
exposure and outcomes. Finally, our exposure was defined
using the Ontario Drug Benefit database, which has consider-
able accuracy.23 Limitations of our study include the possibil-
ityofmisclassificationofkeystudyvariables,andresidualcon-
founding. Nondifferential misclassification of our outcomes
is likely to have occurred given their measurement character-
istics, (and would generally bias our results toward the null).53
The true incidence of suicide was likely underestimated, given
the limited sensitivity of coroner records for identifying sui-
cide, and depression can be both overdiagnosed and under-
diagnosed in the elderly population.30,40,42,54 Residual con-
founding is a consistent limitation of any observational study,
andwhilethepropensityscoreaccountsformanydefinedvari-
ables,therearecovariates(suchasfamilyhistoryofsuicideand
psychosocial supports)39,46,55 that were not measured; how-
ever, they are unlikely to be differentially distributed based on
5ARI use. Furthermore, surveillance and the propensity for a
patient to be diagnosed with self-harm and depression may
have been different after the initiation of the 5ARI. It is pos-
sible there is a small but significant association between sui-
cide and 5ARI usage which we were unable to detect with our
sample size (our 95% CI suggests a true HR between 0.53 and
1.45ispossible).Lowerurinarytractsymptomsthemselvesmay
be related to depression, or may lower a patient’
s quality of life
and therefore lead to depressive symptoms.56 We tried to ad-
just for this by matching on a history of depression, and bal-
ancingrecentuseofanαantagonistoroveractivebladdermedi-
cation, and prior BPH diagnosis or transurethral prostate
surgery. Finally, medication compliance was not directly mea-
sured, although, given a median duration of use of approxi-
mately 12 months, it is unlikely that men would be refilling a
prescription they were not taking.
Implications
The recognition of depression and self-harm as potential ad-
verse effects of 5ARIs is important given their significant im-
pact. However, the relatively small magnitude of these risks
should not dissuade physicians from prescribing these
medications in appropriate patients. This research may help
physicians counsel patients on the risks of 5ARIs. Discontinu-
ation of the 5ARI may be appropriate in the setting of new-
onset depression or self-harm after the initiation of a 5ARI.51
The outcomes from this study need to be assessed in younger
men using finasteride for alopecia. A foundation dedicated to
studying the adverse effects of finasteride speaks to the inter-
est among patients in this research topic.57
Conclusions
The risk of suicide was not significantly elevated in men ages
66 years or older using 5ARIs for BPH, however the risks of self-
harmandincidentdepressionweresignificantlyincreased,pri-
marily during the first 18 months after the initiation of either
finasteride or dutasteride. The absolute increased risk of these
2 outcomes was low, and the potential benefits of 5ARIs in this
population likely outweigh these risks for most patients.

Invited Commentary
The Risk of Suicidality and Depression
From 5-α Reductase Inhibitors
Stephen Thielke, MD, MS
The Scottish philosopher David Hume observed a fundamen-
tal incompatibility between factual and moral propositions,
known as Hume’
s Law: that facts are not the basis for right and
wrong, or, put another way, that “should” cannot be derived
from “is.
” Clinicians constantly face this problem, even if they
are unconscious of it: striving do the morally right thing on the
basis of factually right knowledge, yet depending ultimately
on the patient’
s and their own ideas of what is Good as a means
to establish a goal. Scientific advances may thus complicate
moral decision-making.
In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, the findings re-
ported by Welk et al1 about mental health effects of 5-α reduc-
tase inhibitors (5ARIs) illustrate this dilemma. The authors dis-
covered, using more precise methods than in any previous
research, a clear association
between 5ARI prescription
and some negative mental
healthoutcomesamongolder
men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Comparing
5ARI users and carefully matched nonusers, there was no dif-
ference in risk of suicide. Risk of self-harm was increased by
17 per 100 000 patient-years, but only during the first 18
months of treatment. Risk of incident depression was in-
creased by 272 per 100 000 patient-years, with a mitigated risk
after 18 months. Based on these numbers, clinicians would oc-
casionallyencounterpatientswithdepression,andwouldvery
rarely encounter cases of self-harm, that could be attributed
to 5ARIs.
What ought a clinician to do with these findings? Some op-
tions include (1) prescribing other medications for LUTS that
are not known to increase risk of depression, (2) giving clear
warning to all patients about the possible risks, (3) warning
those who have had prior depression about the risks, (4) moni-
toring carefully for depression during 5ARI use, or (5) doing
nothing, insofar as the absolute differences in risk were small
and the events rare. Hume’
s Law posits that the facts about
5ARIsanddepressiondonotinthemselvesinformwhatshould
be done. Instead, to get to “should,
” one must introduce some
conception of the desired outcome: doing no harm, increas-
ingsomespecificaspectofqualityoflife,reducingratesofmen-
tal illness, maximizing patient autonomy, following treat-
ment guidelines, minimizing polypharmacy, ensuring patient
satisfaction,avoidingmalpractice,orsomeotheraim.Evenper-
fect knowledge about the mechanisms, risks, and benefits of
a treatment will not direct either the clinician or patient to-
ward what they want to accomplish. Because some of these
aims conflict with others, there is no way to accomplish them
all at once, and a moral decision must be made between them,
even if no one acknowledges that this occurred.
A key conundrum is weighing dissimilar hypothetical con-
ditions: potentially worsening mood or self-harm behavior vs
potentially improved urinary tract symptoms. Lower urinary
tract symptoms and depressive symptoms can have signifi-
cant effects on health-related quality of life, but in a complex
way. Mental health variables seem to mediate the relation-
ship between LUTS and quality of life,2 so causation is un-
clear. More problematically, there is no common currency for
the utility value of not having depression or LUTS, in real or
hypothetical form. “Quality of life,” as a measurable con-
struct, is almost always defined by researchers rather than pa-
tients, and patients may have other frameworks for charac-
terizing a good life. Even when patient-reported outcomes are
assessed,3 it is unclear if patients and researchers are apply-
ing the same standards of desirable and undesirable states or
outcomes.
Thispointmayseemofpurelyacademicinterest,butmedi-
cation adherence patterns provide striking evidence of its cen-
trality in clinical care. In the current study, during 6 years of
