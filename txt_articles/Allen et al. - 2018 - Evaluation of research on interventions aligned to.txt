AbstrACt
background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are 
the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, with 
low-income and middle-income countries experiencing 
a disproportionately high burden. Since 2010 WHO has 
promoted 24 highly cost-effective interventions for 
NCDs, dubbed ‘best buys’. It is unclear whether these 
interventions have been evaluated in low-income and 
lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs).
Aim To systematically review research on interventions 
aligned to WHO ‘best buys’ for NCDs in LLMICs.
Methods We searched 13 major databases and included 
papers conducted in the 83 World Bank-defined LLMICs, 
published between 1 January 1990 and 5 February 2015. Two 
reviewers independently screened papers and assessed risk 
of bias. We adopted a narrative approach to data synthesis. 
The primary outcomes were NCD-related mortality and 
morbidity, and risk factor prevalence.
results We identified 2672 records, of which 36 were 
included (608 940 participants). No studies on ‘best 
buys’ were found in 89% of LLMICs. Nineteen of the 
36 studies reported on the effectiveness of tobacco-
related ‘best buys’, presenting good evidence for group 
interventions in reducing tobacco use but weaker evidence 
for interventions targeting individuals. There were fewer 
studies on smoking bans, warning labels and mass 
media campaigns, and no studies on taxes or marketing 
restrictions. There was supportive evidence that cervical 
screening and hepatitis B immunisation prevent cancer 
in LLMICs. A single randomised controlled trial supported 
polypharmacy for cardiovascular disease. Fourteen of the 
‘best buy’ interventions did not have any good evidence for 
effectiveness in LLMICs.
Conclusions We found studies on only 11 of the 24 
interventions aligned with the WHO ‘best buys’ from 
LLMIC settings. Most LLMICs have not conducted 
research on these interventions in their populations. 
LLMICs should take action to implement and evaluate 
‘best buys’ in their national context, based on national 
priorities, and starting with interventions with the 
strongest evidence base.
IntroduCtIon
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) include 
cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory 
diseases, cancers and diabetes. They are the 
leading cause of morbidity and mortality, 
accounting for 68% of global deaths in 
2012, of which 16 million occurred in people 
younger than 70 years.1 The financial reper-
cussions of NCDs are commensurate with 
the global burden, representing an esti-
mated $47 trillion in lost output to the global 
economy by 2030.2 Previously conceived of as 
‘diseases of affluence’, the risk of premature 
death is actually highest in low-income and 
middle-income countries.3 
The inclusion of NCDs in the 2015 ‘Sustain-
able Development Goals’ acknowledges both 
the outsized global impact of NCDs and the 
unequal distribution of human and economic 
costs. Governments have committed to 
reducing premature NCD mortality by a 
third4; however, many policymakers have 
been unsure where to prioritise their efforts. 
Responding to these concerns, WHO iden-
tified a number of highly cost-effective NCD 
policy options, dubbed ‘best buys’ (table 1). 
These 
interventions, 
including 
tobacco 
taxation, salt reduction and cervical cancer 
screening, were first outlined in the 2010 
WHO Global Status Report on NCDs and have 
been endorsed by the World Economic Forum 
and Harvard School of Public Health.5–7
Although the reasoning behind the ‘best 
buys’ is relatively uncontroversial, it is possible 
that context-specific factors may influence 
the effectiveness of the 'best buys' in low-in-
come and lower-middle-income countries 
(LLMICs). This is important because LLMICs

bear the greatest burden of premature NCD deaths.8 
The evidence for many of the interventions comes from 
high-income countries and may not be generalisable 
to low-income settings. As the WHO ‘best buys’ repre-
sent the de facto global strategy to control NCDs, it is 
important that these interventions work, especially in 
populations facing the highest burden disease.
We aimed to systematically review studies evaluating 
‘best buy’ interventions in LLMICs in order to estab-
lish whether all of the 'best buys' have been evaluated in 
these settings, how much research has been conducted 
on each intervention and where the research has been 
performed.
MetHods
Identification and selection of studies
Using a registered protocol (PROSPERO: 42016039051) 
and following the Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines9 
(online supplementary material), we identified records 
published from 1 January 1990 to 5 February 2015, 
searching MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Ovid 
MEDLINE and Web of Science Core Collection. We 
also searched grey literature in Digital Dissertations, the 
WHO Global Health Library Regional Index and the first 
100 hits from Google Scholar. We scrutinised reference 
lists and contacted key authors to uncover additional or 
forthcoming work.
The same dates and strategy (online supplemen-
tary appendix 1) were used for all searches, tailored to 
specific databases by an experienced medical librarian. 
We conducted the search in English but did not restrict 
results by language or age of participants.
study selection
Studies were included if they provided quantitative 
evaluation of one or more ‘best buy’ interventions 
based in one or more of the 83 LLMICs, as defined by 
the 2014 World Bank analytical classifications (fiscal 
year 2016).10 Studies were included if they reported 
primary quantitative data on outcomes relating to 
NCD behavioural risk factors, morbidity or mortality, 
for instance smoking quit rates or systolic blood pres-
sure. As the first scoping review on this topic, we 
wanted to include all research on ‘best buys’, so we 
also included studies reporting process indicators and 
proximal measures such as changes in awareness and 
knowledge, and self-reported intentions, for example 
intention to quit smoking.
We excluded reviews, editorials and studies that 
could not be used to quantify the impact of ‘best 
buy’ interventions, that is, those that did not provide 
two or more sets of outcome data to allow compar-
ison before and after the instigation of a 'best buy', 
or between exposed and unexposed groups. In prac-
tice this excluded case series and traditional cross-sec-
tional studies that only provide outcome data for one 
population at one point in time. We excluded studies 
that compared two different forms of the same inter-
vention without reference to a control/usual care 
group, for example studies comparing the effect 
of two different polypills on hypertension. We had 
the resources to translate studies written in English, 
French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Sinhalese. 
Papers that were written in any other language were 
excluded.
We defined the ‘best buy’ interventions as the 24 inter-
ventions that were presented in the 2011–2020 NCD 
Global Action Plan11 and the supporting WHO discus-
sion paper (summarised in table 1).6
Using a piloted form JP and LA independently 
screened titles and abstracts, calculating percentage 
agreement and Cohen’s kappa statistic at 10% inter-
vals (every 267 records). Once inter-rater agreement 
exceeded 95% and Cohen’s kappa >0.75 (‘excellent’ 
agreement12), JP screened all remaining records. 
Uncertainties were resolved by group consensus. The 
same protocol was used for full-text review. Authors 
were contacted by email if more information was 
required.
Key questions
What is already known about this topic?
 
► The WHO published a number of highly cost-effective 
non-communicable disease (NCD) policy options—dubbed 
‘best buys’—that are included in the Global Action Plan for the 
prevention and control of NCDs.
 
► Low-income and middle-income countries face the greatest 
burden of NCDs and have been encouraged to implement these 
polices as a priority.
 
► The ‘best buys’ are identified from the global evidence base, 
but it is unclear how many research activities are carried out in 
low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs) related 
to these priority NCD actions.
What are the new findings?
 
► There is a general lack of published evidence for the ‘best buy’ 
interventions in LLMICs, and a number of the interventions have 
not been evaluated at all in these settings.
 
► Most of the existing research is concentrated  
in South-East Asia. Our search only returned five studies from the 
African region, two from  
the Eastern Mediterranean, two from South- 
East Asia, one from the Americas, and none  
from the European or Western Pacific  
regions.
 
► More than half of the identified studies evaluated tobacco-related 
interventions.
recommendations for policy
 
► This study highlights the need for prioritising NCD 'best buys' in 
national research agendas in LLMICs. This would contribute to the 
generation of more ‘context specific’ evidence for NCD prevention 
and control, and improve the implementation of those policies.
 
► Countries that introduce 'best buys' should try to evaluate these 
interventions and publish findings in the public domain.

data extraction and quality assessment
JP and LA used a piloted version of the Cochrane 
Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) 
data collection checklist13 to independently extract 
relevant data, including study type, population, inter-
vention, comparator, methods, outcomes and results 
(see online supplementary appendix 2 for a full list 
of extracted variables). KKW and NT independently 
cross-checked a random 10% sample of included 
papers. Disagreements were resolved by group 
consensus.
We assessed the risk of bias for randomised controlled 
trials (RCTs) using the Cochrane Collaboration’s 
tool.14 15 We used the EPOC criteria to assess risk of bias 
in interrupted-time-series studies, and we used study-spe-
cific versions of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale16 for all 
other non-randomised trials, as recommended by the 
Cochrane Collaboration.14 Scores from the latter two 
instruments were based on selection methods, compara-
bility and outcome reporting, and were reported as ‘low’, 
‘medium’ or ‘high’ risk of bias (online supplementary 
appendix 3).
We graded level of evidence (1=high, 5=low) using a 
modified scheme from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-
based Medicine (online supplementary appendix 4).
synthesis
Variation in the interventions and outcome measures 
of different studies precluded quantitative synthesis 
and meta-analysis. We adopted a narrative approach, 
grouping studies by intervention category.

results
Our initial search returned 2672 records. After excluding 
2392 records based on title and abstract screening, 280 
papers were included for full-text review (figure 1).
Thirty-six studies (608 940 participants) were included: 
19 RCTs (of which 3 were phase II drug trials), 7 
cohort studies, 6 longitudinal studies and 4 retrospec-
tive cross-sectional studies. Eight of the studies were 
published before 2007 (figure 2).
There were no studies from 74 of the 83 LLMICs (89%). 
Our search returned five studies from the WHO African 
region, two from the Eastern Mediterranean, 28 from 
South-East Asia, one from the Americas, and none from 
the European or Western Pacific regions.
Almost three-quarters of the studies came from India. 
Of the 26 Indian studies, 17 examined tobacco-related 
'best buys', 5 looked at cancer and 4 examined 'best buys' 
related to cardiovascular disease. Single studies from 
Indonesia and Bangladesh evaluated cervical cancer 
screening and a group smoking cessation programme, 
respectively.
A single Pakistani study examined the effectiveness of 
a mass media campaign on diet and physical activity. The 
single Egyptian study examined group smoking cessation; 
the Guatemalan paper examined longitudinal air quality 
measurements before and after a national smoking ban; 
and the studies from Senegal, Zambia and Gambia all 
examined cancer interventions (figure 3).
In total, 19 of the 36 studies reported on the effec-
tiveness of tobacco-related ‘best buys’ in LLMICs17–35; 
2 on physical activity and diet36 37; 4 on cardiovascular 
disease38–41; and 11 on cancer.42–52
Many of the ‘best buy’ interventions within each cate-
gory had not been evaluated at all; there were no studies 
evaluating tobacco taxation or marketing restrictions, 
and no studies evaluated polypharmacy for ischaemic 
heart disease or aspirin for myocardial infarction. There 
were no studies on any of the trans fat, salt or alcohol 
‘best buys’ (figure 4).
Of the ‘best buys’ that were examined, each had at least 
one study that provided evidence for effectiveness. Savant 
et al did not present a measure of statistical significance 
for their findings, but all other papers presented effect 
sizes that were all significant at the 0.05 level. An over-
view of study characteristics and findings is presented in 
online supplementary table 1.
Many of the studies used process indicators or proximal 
incomes rather than ‘harder’ endpoints; for instance, a 
survey of Indian bus drivers found that those who had 
been exposed to graphical tobacco warnings had better

knowledge of the risks of tobacco than those who had not 
seen the warnings.
Despite the tendency towards measuring ‘soft’ 
outcomes, the studies were generally well-conducted: 
20 were rated as low risk of bias, and the remaining 16 
were rated medium risk using our scoring rubric (online 
supplementary appendix 3).
The RCTs tended to be well-conducted. Each one used 
random sequence allocation and almost all obtained 
complete outcome data; however, selective reporting 
and lack of blinding were common limitations. RCTs 
were exclusively used to evaluate tobacco cessation 
programmes, polypharmacy for cardiovascular disease, 
and cervical cancer screening and treatment. As such 
these interventions have the highest grade of evidence.
All three studies evaluating bans on tobacco use in 
public places adopted longitudinal approaches, as did 
two group smoking cessation evaluations and a cervical

cancer screening evaluation. Only one of these studies 
adequately addressed incomplete data. Two of the 
longitudinal studies failed to report all of the outcomes 
mentioned in the methods. Longitudinal studies are 
not good at controlling for confounding and therefore 
represent relatively low-grade evidence.
The cohort studies all used representative samples, and 
all but one ascertained exposure adequately. The most 
common source of bias was inadequate follow-up. All 
but one of the cohort studies examined either cervical 
screening or hepatitis B interventions. Prospective cohort 
studies offer a higher grade of evidence than longitudinal 
studies; however, they are inferior to RCTs as they are still 
vulnerable to selection bias.
Finally, the retrospective cross-sectional surveys were 
used to ask respondents if they felt that the introduc-
tion of smoking bans, tobacco warning labels, and mass 
media campaigns on tobacco, diet and physical activity 
had been effective. All of these studies tended to be very 
well-conducted with adequate and representative sample 
sizes and appropriate outcome assessments and statistical 
tests. Nevertheless, retrospective cross-sectional surveys 
represent a lower grade of evidence than RCTs and 
prospective cohort studies.
dIsCussIon
This systematic review is the first attempt to assess whether 
the WHO’s prescription for the NCD pandemic has been 
evaluated in settings that bear the greatest burdens of 
death and disability. Only half of the 24 interventions 
that have been designated ‘best buys’ have been evalu-
ated in LLMICs.
Three-quarters of the evaluations have been conducted 
in South-East Asia, and our search did not return any 
studies from Western Pacific or European LLMICs.
Only six of the interventions have had two or more 
studies that evaluate effectiveness: smoking bans in public 
places, group smoking reduction programmes, physical 
activity mass media campaigns, counselling and poly-
pharmacy for high cardiovascular risk groups, cervical 
cancer screening, and hepatitis B immunisation.
Five of the ‘best buys’ have only been evaluated by 
single studies: tobacco labelling, tobacco mass media, 
diet mass media, polypharmacy for high cardiovascular 
risk groups and polypharmacy for diabetics. Our review 
was not designed to assess the effect sizes of each ‘best 
buy’, and there was significant heterogeneity in study 
designs and outcome measures.
Group smoking reduction programmes had the highest 
quantity and quality of evidence, with 12 RCTs (grade 1 
evidence) assessed as medium and low risk of bias. Phar-
macology trials were of a similar quality. Studies exam-
ining the other ‘best buys’ tended to be well-conducted 
but of a lower grade (prospective cohorts, retrospective 
cross-sectional surveys and longitudinal studies).
The studies were generally well-conducted, with around 
two-thirds of studies being rated as high quality within 
each study design grouping. The grade of evidence was 
highest for individual-level tobacco interventions.
The population-based nature of many of the 'best buys' 
makes it difficult to randomise and blind participants. A 
number of trials successfully used interrupted time-se-
ries approaches, cluster randomisation and cohort 
designs to overcome this issue. Cluster RCTs represent 
the highest level of evidence but are vulnerable to bias

from imbalance between the study arms. They are also 
less precise than individual-level RCTs.
Considering the individual ‘best buy’ interventions 
in more depth, there was no evidence for any of the 
alcohol 'best buys' in LLMICs. Alcohol abstention rates 
are high in low-income countries, and in some settings 
alcohol use is so low that the interventions may not be 
necessary. As a broader point, interventions need to be 
tailored to the local context and all of the ‘best buys’ 
do not necessarily need to be applied in every setting. 
Having said this, a number of LLMICs do have high rates 
of alcohol use, and the relative alcohol-related disease 
burden tends to be highest among low-income popu-
lations.53 Cook et al54 provide evidence that restricting 
availability to alcohol through licensing, age restrictions, 
higher pricing and advertising restrictions all reduced 
consumption levels in an analysis of 15 low-income and 
middle-income countries. Furthermore LLMICs are 
increasingly being targeted by alcohol companies, and 
aggressive marketing strategies have been reported in 
Gambia, Ghana, Nigeria and Uganda.55 Effective alcohol 
harm reduction polices are urgently needed in these 
settings, including policies that target informally retailed 
products.56
Tobacco use is steady or declining in all WHO regions 
except for the African region, and more cigarettes are 
smoked in China than in all LLMICs.57 However the 
number of tobacco outlets is 2.5 times higher in low-in-
come countries than in high-income or middle-income 
countries.58 Although the number of countries employing 
‘best buy’ tobacco policies is increasing, the absolute 
number remains low,59 and our findings suggest that a 
minority of policies are being scientifically evaluated.
While tobacco excise taxes have been implemented 
in 12 LLMICs, there is no published evidence to show 
that they are effective in these countries.60 Two model-
ling studies have suggested that excise taxes could signifi-
cantly reduce smoking prevalence in Vietnam.61 62
Three studies demonstrated that smoking bans in 
public places reduced air nicotine levels. While encour-
aging, future research should examine the impact of 
smoking bans on clinical outcomes. To date 15 LLMICs 
have implemented smoking bans policy, led by Nepal, 
Burkina Faso, Chad and Madagascar.60 The Framework 
Convention on Tobacco Control is clear that all indoor 
public places, public transport facilities and indoor work-
places should be 100% smoke-free,63 but only 18% of the 
world’s population is currently covered by this level of 
legislation.59 While modelling studies suggest that public 
smoking bans are highly effective,64 enforcement issues 
highlight the need for comprehensive policy measures 
and implementation.
No studies reported on tobacco marketing restric-
tions, but a global study found that consumption levels 
correlate inversely with national bans.65 Surveys by Savell 
et al58 show that exposure to tobacco marketing is 10 
times higher in low-income compared with high-income 
countries.
Many LLMICs have successfully introduced health 
information and warnings on tobacco packaging, but 
there is only one study assessing effectiveness. In recent 
years Samoa, the Philippines, Bangladesh, the Solomon 
Islands, Vanuatu and Vietnam have implemented large 
graphic pack warnings, but there have not been published 
evaluations to date. Pant et al have shown that it is difficult 
to enforce pictorial health warnings where tobacco prod-
ucts are produced in the informal sector, as is the case for 
most LLMICs. This limits the generalisability of evalua-
tions from settings like Australia and the UK, where the 
informal sector has a much smaller market share.66
Only one study examined the impact of a tobacco mass 
media campaign in an LLMIC; however, this policy is 
thought to be one of the most cost-effective.67
Fourteen studies reported the effectiveness of group 
tobacco reduction programmes, predominantly based in 
communities and schools and using a mixture of educa-
tion, counselling and group activities. Most were limited 
by reliance on self-report; however, one study found 96% 
agreement between self-report and urine cotinine levels. 
These largely positive findings contrast with an analysis 
of 43 countries (including non-LLMICs) that found no 
independent association between smoking behaviour 
and exposure to school-based group counselling.68
There was no evidence for five of the six dietary inter-
ventions. Moldova, the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan 
have implemented policies to eliminate trans fats, as 
has India; however, a 2015 evaluation found high levels 
remain in street food and household snacks.69 More 
evidence is needed here.
The included Pakistani newspaper-based mass media 
campaign provided supportive evidence for national 
campaigns that corroborates modelling studies from 
Vietnam, Syria and the occupied Palestinian territo-
ries.70 71 Further modelling studies have shown that 
modest salt intake reductions are associated with large 
health gains.72 By 2015 five LLMICs had fully imple-
mented salt reduction policies, but none of these were 
low-income countries.60 As processed foods are less 
important sources of salt in LMICs compared with 
richer countries, interventions aimed at industrial 
reformulation are likely to be less effective in these 
settings.73 74
The 2015 WHO NCD progress monitor shows that 33 
LLMICs have implemented at least one recent national 
public awareness programme on diet and/or physical 
activity.60 In high-income countries the evidence that 
mass media can reduce NCD risk factors is limited. A 
2013 systematic review found that campaigns can increase 
moderate walking but do not significantly increase the 
amount of people meeting activity recommendations.75 
Another systematic review including non-LLMICs 
showed that many diet-related campaigns currently focus 
on undernutrition rather than overnutrition.76
Four studies examined the effectiveness of cardiovas-
cular 'best buys'. The WHO’s tight definitions for these 
interventions are likely to have excluded a number

of papers; however, it is still surprising that our search 
returned such a low number of studies.
Only the LLMICs Ukraine, Armenia and Vanuatu 
routinely provide preventive polypharmacy for cardio-
vascular disease.60 Modelling studies on cardiovascular 
medicines predict large gains to population health in 
LLMICs: Lim et al77 project that cardiovascular polyphar-
macy could avert 17.9 million deaths in LMICs at a cost 
of US$0.75–1.30 per capita, but there is little convincing 
experimental evidence at this stage.
Both hepatitis B immunisation and cervical cancer 
screening had multiple evaluations with well-conducted 
and high-grade studies. Ginsberg et al78 estimate that a 
single smear test at age 40 years with lesion removal and 
cancer treatment would avert 462 Disability Adjusted Life 
Years (DALYs) per million people in the sub-Saharan 
Africa region and 1327 DALYs per million people in the 
South-East Asia region at a cost of Int$307 and Int$142 
per DALY, respectively.
study strengths and limitations
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review 
to systematically assess the evidence on whether the 
WHO ‘best buy’ interventions have been evaluated in 
LLMICs. Strengths of this study include our adherence 
to PRISMA and Cochrane guidance and our use of 
multiple researchers to ensure high levels of agreement 
at each stage of the review. Following the exact wording 
of the ‘best buys’ may have restricted our results, espe-
cially for cardiovascular therapy; however, our attention 
to the exact WHO wording is also a strength of this study. 
The comprehensiveness of our search strategy is another 
strength.
We set out to ascertain which interventions were being 
evaluated and where the research was occurring rather 
than examining effect sizes. Future research is needed to 
establish how effective the interventions are in LLMICs. 
Our efforts to find and include all studies on the 'best 
buys' also introduced marked heterogeneity in study 
designs and outcome measures. This is appropriate for an 
initial scoping review but limits the ability of the findings 
in terms of making intervention-specific recommenda-
tions. The mix of study types necessitated the develop-
ment of a new quality scoring rubric that would allow 
cross-comparability. We used the current gold-standard 
Newcastle-Ottawa and Cochrane Collaboration tools; 
however, our composite risk of bias scheme has not been 
previously validated. To reduce chances of introducing 
bias, we present raw scores alongside quality ranking in 
online supplementary table 1. Our search was conducted 
in 2015 at the eve of the Millennium Development Goals. 
A major strength of the paper is that 25 years’ worth of 
global research is presented, ending at a natural transi-
tion point in global health policy. The lack of evidence 
from 2015 to present stems from delays in preparing the 
manuscript and lack of resources. The omission of recent 
research weakens our findings.
ConClusIon
The major finding of this systematic review is the wide-
spread paucity of research on ‘best buys’ in LLMICs. 
The rising burden of NCDs in less developed coun-
tries has been overlooked for decades79; however, it 
is surprising that so many well-established interven-
tions lack published evaluations in the areas where 
the burden of disease is highest. Although aspirin is 
likely to work in Djibouti just as well as it works in 
Denmark, the same is not necessarily true for media 
campaigns, marketing restrictions and taxation poli-
cies given heterogeneity in cultural norms and market 
factors. As premature mortality is highest in low-in-
come settings, it is important that the major NCD 
interventions are evaluated in these settings. There is 
an urgent need for implementation research on the 
diet and alcohol-related ‘best buys’ in LLMICs as the 
evidence base is so scant.
A number of LLMICs had implemented ‘best buys’ 
between 1990 and 2015 but did not evaluate effective-
ness. Moving forward, all countries should consider 
evaluating these interventions and publishing findings 
in the peer-reviewed literature as the corpus of evidence 
represents a global public good that can be used by 
governments in deciding how to allocate resources most 
effectively in order to combat NCDs.
This review showed that hepatitis B immunisation, 
cervical cancer screening, smoking bans and group 
smoking reduction programmes are supported by 
a number of high-quality studies. In the absence of 
evidence for other interventions, there is an argument 
that these ‘best buys’ should be prioritised, as long as 
there is clinical need.
Future research should try to quantify the effect 
sizes of the various interventions in different settings, 
employing high-grade study designs. Step-wedge and 
cluster RCTs can be used to assess population-level 
interventions, as well as carefully designed longitu-
dinal analyses.
The list of ‘best buys’ could be used to help NCD 
researchers prioritise their research agenda. WHO has 
developed an implementation research guide that facil-
itates evaluation of these interventions in LLMICs.80 
South-East Asia has been very active in this space, but the 
other WHO regional offices could do more to promote 
evaluation and implementation research on these 
interventions.
