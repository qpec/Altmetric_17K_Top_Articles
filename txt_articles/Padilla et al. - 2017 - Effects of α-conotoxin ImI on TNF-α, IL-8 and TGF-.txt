-conotoxin ImI on

leukemic cells

α
7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ubiquitous in the nervous system and ensure 
important neurophysiological functionality for many processes. However, they are also found in cells 
of the immune system, where their role has been less studied. Here we report the pro-inflammatory 
effect of ImI, a well characterized conotoxin that inhibits α
7 nAChRs, on differentiated THP-1 pre-
monocyte macrophages (MDM) obtained by phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate (PMA) treatment. 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) performed on supernatant fluids of LPS challenged 
MDM showed ImI-mediated upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α
 in an ImI concentration-
dependent manner from 0.5 to 5.0 µmol/L and for IL-8 up to 1.0 µmol/L. Levels of anti-inflammatory 
cytokine TGF-β
 remained practically unaffected in ImI treated MDMs. Nicotine at 10 µmol/L significantly 
downregulated the release of TNF-α
, but showed a lesser effect on IL-8 secretion and no effect on 
TGF-β
. Fluorescent competitive assays involving ImI, α
-bungarotoxin and nicotine using MDM and the 
murine macrophage RAW 264.7 suggest a common binding site in the α
7 receptor. This work extends 
the application of conotoxins as molecular probes to non-excitatory cells, such as macrophages and 
supports the involvement of the α
7 nAChR in regulating the inflammatory response via the cholinergic 
anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP).
The α
7 nAChR is a member of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor family and is widely distributed in neuronal 
and non-neuronal cells. The functional α
7 nAChR occurs as a homopentamer activated intrinsically by acetyl-
choline to mediate the intracellular flux of Na+, K+ and Ca2+ ions1. In humans, α
7 is a 55 kDa highly conserved 
polypeptide expressed by the 10 exon CHRNA7 gene located in chromosome 15q13-142,3. In leukocytes, the α
7 
nAChR has been reported to play a crucial role in the mechanism employed by the vagus nerve to regulate inflam-
mation attributable to injury and infection4. CHRNA7 gene knock-out and vagus nerve ablation in mice exposed 
to endotoxin has been reported to fail to down-regulate macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in 
the presence of acetylcholine (ACh) while electrical stimulation down regulated production of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines5–8. Additionally, a distinct human gene dubbed CHRFAM7A, residing 1.5 Mb proximal to the 5′
 end of 
the full length gene for α
7, reveals the partial duplication of exons 5–10 from CHRNA7 and the presence of four 
novel exons presumably derived from chromosome 39,10. The latter novel exons are transcribed in frame with the 
five duplicated exons in chromosome 15. The CHRFAM7A isoform runs in opposite orientation to that of the 
canonical CHRNA7 and it is unclear whether this duplicated isoform is translated. However, there is evidence 
that the CHRFAM7A is not present in every chromosome 1510. The existence of these two gene isoforms has been

a motive of debate as to the presence, co-presence and functionality of α
7 nicotinic receptors in monocytes and 
macrophages and their role in anti-inflammatory responses1,11,12.
Toxins have played a significant role in probing nAChRs and their associated cholinergic pathways in living 
organisms. Notably, the venom of cones snails, a genus of predatory marine mollusks, produces an extraordinary 
diversity of peptides (conotoxins) including several classes of compounds that target nAChRs. Conotoxins are 
valuable research tools as they selectively target different types of ion channels, receptors and transport molecules 
in neuronal and non-neuronal systems. Conotoxins have been used as molecular probes and as therapeutic leads 
for the nervous system and the neuromuscular junction. They show inhibitory effects in nAChRs, NMDA recep-
tors, neurotensin receptors, norepinephrine transporters, Na+ channels, K+ channels, and Ca2+ channels, many of 
which can be involved in disease states13,14. One of such peptides is α
-conotoxin ImI, which we used in this study 
to antagonize the α
7 nAChR expressed in THP-1 monocyte derived macrophages and to study its correspond-
ing inflammatory responses. ImI is a 12 amino acid peptide constrained by two disulfide bonds that inhibits α
7 
nAChRs. This conotoxin was originally isolated from the venom of Conus imperialis and it is the first α
-conotoxin 
reported to inhibit neuronal nAChRs15.
The presence of nAChRs in non-excitable cells, particularly in immune cells, has been noted in the literature 
for a while. However, the precise role of these receptors has not been firmly defined. Findings that the efferent 
pathway of the vagus nerve is directly or indirectly involved in the release of ACh to modulate acute inflammation 
via the α
7 receptor in macrophages5,16–19 led us to explore the effects of ImI on the α
7 receptors expressed in the 
membranes of THP-1 MDMs. Our hypothesis was that ImI might exacerbate the pro-inflammatory effects of the 
LPS E. coli endotoxin on human macrophages by antagonizing α
7 nAChRs. To this end, we demonstrated the 
binding of ImI to mouse and human macrophages and assessed the effect of ImI on LPS-challenged MDM by 
evaluating the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α
 and chemotactic factor IL-8.
Results
Cell Viability and Proliferation Assays. 
MTS cell viability and proliferation assays conducted on 
untreated and PMA-treated monocytes indicated continuing viability for up to 72 h (Fig. 1). Growth stabilization 
in PMA-treated cells occurred after 48 h where the vast majority of cells adhered to the plate and displayed clear 
morphological changes under the light microscope. Morphological differentiation was initially observed after 
18 h of treatment with 50 ng of PMA (see Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggest that complete THP-1 
monocyte differentiation into MDMs occurs at 48 h. This observation was used as the optimum time to select 
MDMs for experiments.
Flow Cytometry. 
Flow cytometry measurements showed a significant increase in the LPS-binding protein 
receptor CD14 and α
7 nAChRs on rested MDM in contrast to undifferentiated THP-1 pre-monocytic cells. The 
difference in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for CD14 between pre-monocytic cells (MFI 82.27) and in rested 
MDM (MFI 182.44) suggests differentiation of monocyte precursor cells into MDM20,21 (Fig. 2A). Likewise, the 
MFI of α
-bungarotoxin binding to the α
7 nAChR was significantly higher in macrophage-like cells (MFI 153.75) 
than in pre-monocytic cells (MFI 64.85), which is an indication of higher expression of α
7 nAChRs upon differ-
entiation (Fig. 2B). Further assays for differentiation/maturation markers on MDM revealed the expression of 
CD11B, CD11C, and CD86 suggesting M1 macrophage-like phenotypic characteristics21–26 (Fig. 3). MDM did 
not express CD80, CD68 or CD163 in any of the three populations assayed (see Supplementary Fig. S4).
Figure 1. PMA induced differentiation of THP-1 monocytes into adherent macrophage-like cells was observed 
under the light microscope (inset). Cells with macrophage morphology ceased their proliferation after 48 h of 
being treated with PMA (red line) and maintained constant viability for 72 h. Untreated monocytes continued 
to proliferate continuously for 72 hours (blue line). Absorbance measurements are the conversion of the dye 
MTS used to ascertain viability and cellular proliferation.

Fluorescence Microscopy. 
To assess whether cytokine responses and nicotine modulation were attributed 
to interactions of ImI and nicotine with the α
7 nicotinic receptors in MDM, competition assays were performed 
using nicotine, ImI and fluorescently labeled α
-BTX. The experiments confirmed the presence of α
7 receptors in 
MDM and murine macrophages and revealed competition of the three ligands for the same binding site in human 
MDM and 264.7 murine macrophages (Fig. 4A and B).
PMA Activation. 
PMA alone elicited a pro-inflammatory cytokine response (Fig. 5A and B). To avoid 
over-estimating cytokine measurements from PMA activation, MDM were rested for 5 days, with continuous 
change in media, prior to treatments with LPS, ImI and nicotine.
Time course of Optimum Cytokine Secretion from Monocytes versus MDM. 
Highest expression 
levels of TNF-α
 and IL-8 from LPS activated THP-1 pre-monocytes were observed at 24 and 48 h, respectively. 
LPS activated MDM yielded highest expression of TNF-α
 in 8 h and in 48 h for IL-8 (Fig. 6A and B). Following 
differentiation, MDM were washed with media to remove excess PMA, and were rested for 5 days in new media 
before challenging with LPS. A signiwficantly higher cytokine output was obtained from MDM compared to 
monocytes following LPS stimulation. No significant difference in IL-8 expression was evident between 24 and 
48 h (Fig. 6B). To minimize possible cell damage and cell death, subsequent IL-8 analyses were performed in 
MDM supernatant fluids collected at 24 h.

population (A) and the PMA differentiated macrophage-like cell population (B) analyzed for the presence of 
the LPS-binding-protein receptor CD14 (C) and α
7 nAChRs (D). A higher expression of CD14 receptors (MFI 
182.44) is observed in PMA-derived macrophage-like cells (blue peak) while the untreated pre-monocytic 
cells (pink peak) show a lower fluorescent shift (MFI 82.27). CD14 receptors bind LPS-binding-protein, which 
in turn interacts with TLR-4 to activate cytokine expression pathways. An increased binding of fluorescently 
labelled α
-bungarotoxin (α
-BTX) (MFI 153.75) to α
7 nAChRs was also observed in cells turned macrophage-
like after a 48 h exposure to PMA, denoted by the pink peak (D). The shift for the untreated THP-1 pre-
monocytic cells (MFI 64.85), represented in cyan, indicates that a lower number of α
7 nAChRs are present in 
non-differentiated cells (D).

Response of LPS challenged MDM to ImI and Nicotine. 
Rested MDM challenged with LPS for 8 h 
secreted significant (p < 0.05) TNF-α
 (289.59 pg/mL) versus the control group (6.51 pg/mL) (Fig. 7A). The 
LPS-induced secretion of IL-8 was 3402.92 pg/mL at 24 hours in comparison to 1116.70 pg/mL for the untreated 
control. The increasing levels of IL-8 by 24 h in the control group suggest basal constitutive production of IL-8 
(Fig. 7B).
Addition of ImI (0.5 µmol/L to 5.0 µmol/L) to LPS-challenged MDM revealed a gradual increase in TNF-α
 
(Fig. 7A). Significant (p < 0.05) levels of soluble TNF-α
 were achieved at 2.0 µmol/L ImI (387.63 pg/mL TNF-α
) 
and 5.0 µmol/L (436.83 pg/mL) compared to the control group (289.58 pg/mL). Significant cytotoxicity was 
observed in cell populations treated with 10 µmol/L ImI compared to cell populations treated at 2.0 µmol/L and 
5.0 µmol/L (see Supplementary Fig. S3). Hence, the level of TNF-α
 at the 10 µmol/L experimental condition can-
not be correlated to the sole effect of ImI and, consequently, is not reported. Concentrations of ImI of 0.5 µmol/L 
and 1.0 µmol/L also had an upregulating effect on the expression of IL-8. Significant (p < 0.05) IL-8 expression 
was observed at 1.0 µmole/L. IL-8 began a gradual decrease in expression at 2.0 µmol/L of ImI and was stabilized 
at an ImI concentration of 5.0 µmol/L to nearly the same level observed when cells were stimulated with LPS 
alone (Fig. 7B).
Nicotine (10 µmol/L) significantly (p < 0.05) modulated the expression of TNF-α
 in LPS treated THP-1 
macrophage-like cells (Fig. 8A). However, its slight modulating effect of 10–15% on IL-8 expression, gave a p 
value greater than 0.05 (Fig. 8B).
The levels of anti-inflammatory TGF-β
 remained low and practically unaffected by the increasing concentra-
tions of ImI from 0.5 to 5.0 µmol/L (Fig. 9A) or exposure to 10 µmol/L nicotine (Fig. 9B).
Figure 5. The PMA induced differentiation of THP-1 monocytes into macrophage-like cells elicits a substantial 
expression of TNF-α
 (A) and IL-8 (B) cytokines. Hence, the macrophage-like cells were “rested” for 5–7 days 
prior to LPS activation, in order to avoid confounding results when determining cytokine expression due solely 
to LPS. All measurements reflect the mean ± SEM, n = 3.

 (A) and IL-8 (B) from monocytes

monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) (green). The highest level of TNF-α
 in MDM was observed at 8 h and 
at 48 hours for IL-8. IL-8 was collected at 24 h of LPS activation to assure steady cell viability and less stress. All 
measurements reflect the mean ± SEM, n = 3.

Discussion
Immune cells and neuronal cells share several identical receptors and ion channels including muscarinic and 
nAChRs, NMDA receptors, AMPA receptors, kinate receptors, sodium channels, potassium channels, and 
calcium channels27–29. Conotoxins have been employed in the study of these receptors within the nervous sys-
tem13,14,30; therefore, conotoxins are promising molecular tools to study cellular processes and ascertain their 
pharmacological potential in non-excitable cells30. In macrophages, the α
7 nAChR is a major component of 
the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) serving as a receptor for the ACh released directly by the 
Figure 7. Effect of conotoxin ImI on the release of TNF-α
 (A) and IL-8 (B) from THP-1 derived macrophages 
activated with E. coli LPS. ImI increases the expression of TNF-α
 in LPS activated monocyte-derived 
macrophages in a concentration dependent manner from 0.5 µmol/L to 5.0 µmol/L. ImI induced cytotoxicity 
was observed at a concentration of 10 µmol/L (Fig. S3). IL-8 expression is likewise enhanced in the presence of 
ImI at 0.5 µmol/L and 1.0 µmol/L concentrations; nevertheless, downregulation of the chemokine was observed 
at concentrations of 2.0 µmol/L and 5.0 µmol/L. All measurements reflect the mean ± SEM, n = 3.

 0.05) modulation of TNF-α
 expression in monocyte derived 
macrophages incubated for 30 min with nicotine prior to treatments with 2.0 µmol/L ImI, 2.0 µg/mL LPS or 
combined (A). Incubation with nicotine shows a lesser (12.6–15.9%) but perceptible down regulation of IL-8 in 
the presence of LPS and ImI combined at 2.0 µg/mL and 2.0 µmol/L, respectively (B). All measurements reflect 
the mean ± SEM, n = 3.

efferent fibers of the vagus nerve or indirectly, through vagus nerve activated T cells, to suppress inflammation 
provoked by tissue injury or pathogenic invasion2,16,18,19. Using PMA, we differentiated THP-1 pre-monocytes 
into macrophage-like cells and evaluated the effects of α
-conotoxin ImI on the inflammatory response in vitro. 
PMA differentiates macrophages and activates both protein kinase C and NF-kB20,31 and during this event the 
levels of cytokines were highly prominent, which might indicate that NF-kB was translocating into the nucleus to 
upregulate the expression of TNF-α
 and IL-8.
Flow cytometry revealed a substantially higher expression of macrophage specific differentiation antigen 
CD14 receptors in PMA treated THP-1 than in the untreated monocytes. Similarly, significantly higher numbers 
of α
7 nAChRs were found on cells treated with PMA than in the untreated THP-1 monocytes. These conditions 
were achieved 48 h post PMA induction with concomitant amoeboid-like cell shape and widespread plate adher-
ence. The higher abundance of CD14 induced by PMA facilitates the docking of the lipopolysaccharide binding 
protein (LPS-BP) required to form a ternary complex with TLR-4 leading to activation of NF-kB and optimal 
cytokine expression in LPS induced events20,32. Together with CD14, the adequate presence of α
7 receptors, 
required for ACh binding, was critical in our cell model to enable the quantitative evaluation of an inflammatory 
response in single or combined presence of LPS, ImI and nicotine. Thus, the most suitable cellular phenotypic 
conditions to carry out our experiments were found in 48 h PMA differentiated THP-1 cells or monocyte derived 
macrophages (MDM). MDM yielded from 5 to 7 fold higher cytokine expression in response to LPS challenges 
versus untreated THP-1 cells, confirming MDM to be a more appropriate model over undifferentiated THP-1. 
During PMA induced differentiation in THP-1 cells, important p38 MAPK independent mRNA stabilization 
takes place, significantly stronger than the mRNA stabilization induced by endotoxin33. To discriminate LPS 
induced cytokine levels in MDM from those levels initially induced by PMA, MDM were rested for 5 to 7 days 
with continuous change of media until cytokine expression was restored to basal levels. To ensure that cytokine 
response in MDM was indeed due to the primary involvement of α
7 nAChRs, we ran a competition assay in 
presence of fluorescent α
7 nAChR selective α
-Bgtx, nicotine and α
-conotoxin ImI. Fluorescence microscopy in 
MDM revealed α
-Bgtx, nicotine and ImI competing for a common binding site.
In LPS-challenged MDM treated with ImI, TNF-α
 expression was up-regulated in a concentration dependent 
manner. Down-regulation of TNF-α
 expression was observed in MDM exposed to nicotine and further chal-
lenged with LPS. A similar regulatory effect by nicotine was observed when MDM were first exposed to nicotine 
before simultaneously being challenged with ImI and LPS. ImI and nicotine by themselves did not disturb MDM 
viability or cytokine homeostasis in absence of LPS (Figs S1 and S3). These results are in agreement with mech-
anisms proposed for acetylcholine modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels during inflammation2,4,5,7,34. 
Additionally, the results confirm apparent selectivity, affinity and inhibitory function of α
-conotoxin ImI on 
α
7 nAChRs of human macrophages. Besides the α
7 subtype, which is clearly involved in cholinergic signaling 
via ACh released by the vagus nerve or acetylcholine producing T cells16,18,19, recent in vivo and in vitro studies 
suggest the involvement of subtypes α
5, α
7, α
9, β
2 and β
4 in the nicotine mediated mitigation of the immune 
response in monocytes and macrophages35. This evidence, should not have a significant effect in our results as α
7 
and α
9 homopentamers appear to be the predominant functional types in cells of the immune system36. Nicotine 
was chosen as agonist, over acetylcholine, in order to bypass a sustained modulatory effect in the cell system 
due to the expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) during LPS stimulation37. Nicotine binding to subtypes 
α
7 and α
9 has also been determined to play important roles in cholinergic modulation of M1 monocytes36 and 
Figure 9. The concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-β
, in LPS activated MDM, remained at low 
levels and practically unchanged during increasing concentrations (0.5–5.0 µmol/L) of ImI (A) or during 
exposure to 10 µmol/L nicotine alone or in combination with ImI. ImI anti-inflammatory effects or nicotine 
modulatory effects were not detected. All measurements reflect the mean ± SEM, n = 3.

pro-inflammatory cell recruitment into the CNS which can translate into protection toward encephalomyeli-
tis35,38,39. Hence, besides α
7, a series of other nicotine targeted AChR receptors are apparently implicated in the 
complex process of an immune response. Further studies are necessary to ascertain the nAChR subtype combi-
nations, present in macrophages, which are specifically involved in the CAP, in addition to the clearly defined α
7 
homopentamer.
LPS challenged MDM produced levels of IL-8 chemokine nearly 14 times higher than the levels observed for 
TNF-α
. Moreover, IL-8 was constitutively expressed and longer-lived than TNF-α
. In macrophages, the short 
half-life of TNF-α
 is due to transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation; its mRNA remains unstable and 
hypoadenylated upon stimulation of macrophages by lipopolysaccharides40. The high levels of IL-8, in turn, are 
due to de-repression of the AU rich elements (ARE) found in the mRNA of most cytokines, including IL-833. 
Additionally, the presence of TNF-α
 exacerbates the expression of IL-8 in macrophages41. In one study, TNF-α
’s 
enhancement of IL-8 expression was reported to be at least 100 fold42.
IL-8 levels for MDM treated with ImI in the presence of LPS peaked significantly at 1.0 µmol/L and showed a 
decline at concentrations higher than 1.0 µmol/L (Fig. 7B). ImI and nicotine by themselves did not affect cytokine 
levels (Fig. S1). IL-8 characteristically shows variation in its expression levels, in part, as a consequence of its 
need to synchronize several conserved transcriptional and post-transcriptional converging regulatory pathways 
involving NFk-B, JNK and p38 MAPK to activate and maximize expression42. However, further studies are neces-
sary to identify the cause for the subsiding levels of IL-8 at higher concentrations of ImI. Among the possibilities 
are the desensitization of α
7 at levels above 1.0 µmol/L ImI and activation of cellular mechanisms repressing IL-8 
promotion factor (NKRF) present in THP-1 cells43. More details on IL-8 gene activation/inhibition, signal trans-
duction pathways and molecular functionality of the α
7 nAChR and its CHRFAM7A isoform in macrophages 
are necessary to assess this effect. The modulating effect of nicotine, although subtle, was overpowered by high 
levels of IL-8 (Fig. 8B).
TGF-β
 is commonly expressed by M2 macrophages in anti-inflammatory environments where wound heal-
ing and tumor progression are favored. For these processes, the levels of TNF-α
 and other pro-inflammatory 
cytokines are downregulated below the threshold of inflammation44,45. Here we observed low levels of TGF-β
 and 
upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α
 and IL-8 in LPS activated MDM exposed to increasing 
concentrations of ImI. This, together with the differentiation/maturation markers observed in the PMA treated 
THP-1 pre-monocytic cells, corroborates that the type of cells used in our model to study the effects of ImI in the 
α
7 nAChRs have a macrophage-like phenotype.
The effect of ImI in this in vitro cellular study provides further evidence for involvement of the α
7 nAChRs in 
the modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines mediated by the direct or indirect release of ACh from the efferent 
fibers of the vagus nerve2,5,6,16,18,19. Contrary to the nervous system, recent studies on the α
7 in leukocytes have 
reported weak ionotropic functionality46. Evidence of alternate functionalities of α
7 receptors has been provided 
by a novel heterotrimeric G-protein-mediated metabotropic signaling pathway in non-excitatory cells47. It is yet 
to be determined whether ACh pro-inflammatory cytokine modulation is solely due to the intervention of the 
canonical isoform of α
7, since substantial mRNA from the hybrid gene transcript, dupα
7, has been found in 
human macrophages acting as a dominant negative regulator of α
7 nAChR in vitro48. Furthermore, dupα
7 was 
down-regulated by one-half in the presence of LPS, nicotine and IL-1β
; thus, increasing the availability of func-
tional α
7 nAChR to attenuate the inflammatory response48.
The importance of the α
7 nAChR in non-excitable cells and their modulation by ImI might have therapeutic 
applications. Observations in α
7-/- mouse knockouts confirmed improved antibacterial defense during E. coli 
peritonitis49. Additionally, abundant expression of α
7 receptors leading to proliferation, metastasis and drug 
resistance has been reported in gastric, breast and lung cancer epithelia50–52. Therefore, α
7 nAChRs may serve as 
potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of these cancer types while ImI may serve as a potential therapeutic 
affecting the cellular effects mediated by the α
7 receptor in non-excitatory cells. Also noteworthy is the intrin-
sic potential therapeutic value of ImI as it does augment the levels of TNF-α
 and IL-8 by antagonizing the α
7 
nAChR. TNF-α
 and IL-8 have been found to be pivotal in overcoming infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 
enabling macrophages to form granulomas. Direct interaction of IL-8 with erythrocytes and the bacilli itself may 
enhance the innate immune response43,53,54. A clinical study shows TB survivors having considerably higher levels 
of IL-8 than people who have died from the disease53. Therefore, the effects of ImI on the α
7 nAChR could also 
contribute to the better understanding of the molecular aspects of TB and provide useful knowledge for the use 
and design of novel therapeutic agents.
This study broadens the application of conotoxins as molecular probes to explore receptors present in 
non-excitable systems, such as the innate immune system. The paradigm shift here proposed is to rely on the 
conotoxins’ consistent attributes of high affinity and specificity for receptors, ion channels and transport mole-
cules, initially observed in the nervous system, to recognize receptors in non-excitatory cells; thus expanding the 
pharmacological potential for these compounds in manners unexplored to date.

Effect of ImI and nicotine on inflammatory responses of monocytic-derived macrophage. 
THP-1 
cells were seeded in 96 well plates with 200 µL CM containing 2.0 ×
 10^4 cells and treated with 50 ng/mL PMA 
for 48 h to induce differentiation into MDM, then washed 4X with CM and allowed to rest for 5 to 7 days43 with 
media exchanged for fresh media every two days. MDM were stimulated with 2 µg/mL LPS (E. coli serotype 055:B5 
Ready-Made LPS solution −
1mg/mL, 0.2µmol/L filtered- Sigma-Aldrich -St. Louis, MO, USA). ImI 0.5–5.0 µmol/L 
(R&D Systems Inc- Minneapolis, MN, USA) or (−
)-nicotine hydrogen tartrate 10 µmol/L (Sigma-Aldrich -St. Louis, 
MO, USA) were added to the LPS treated MDM. Supernatant fluids were collected every 4 h for 48 h, kept frozen 
at −
80°C, and assayed in triplicate to determine optimum expression time for LPS induced TNF-α
 and IL-8. The 
optimum expression times were observed when measuring the anti- or pro-inflammatory effects of added ImI or 
nicotine. TGF-β
 was assayed on supernatants collected at the same time interval as in IL-8. Endotoxin-free levels for 
ImI were confirmed using the kinetic turbidimetric method (Charles Rivers Laboratories- Charleston, SC, USA).
Cytotoxicity of ImI toward MDM. 
ImI (0.5–10 µmol/L range of concentrations) were added to MDM 
(1 ×
 104 cells/well with 200 µl of CM) in 96 well plates. After 24 hours of incubation, 20 µL of Cell titer 96 AQueous 
One Solution MTS −
5 mg/mL (Promega- Madison, WI, USA) was added and incubated for an additional 4 h. 
Dual absorbance readings were taken in an Epoch microplate reader at λ
 = 490 nm and 650 nm respectively.
Cytokine assays. 
Cytokines in culture supernatants fluids were assayed using complete TNF-α
 and IL-8 
capture antibody Novex ELISA kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) according to manufacturers’ instructions. 
Cytokine concentrations were determined within 30 min of the stop reaction. Dual absorbance readings were 
taken in an Epoch microplate reader at λ
 = 450 nm and 650 nm respectively.
Flow cytometry. 
A Guava easyCyte flow cytometer with InCyte software (EMD Millipore, USA) was used 
to validate both the presence of the LPS-binding-protein receptor (CD14) and the presence of α
7 nAChRs. MDM 
cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated α
- bungarotoxin (Life Technologies, Grand 
Island, NY, USA) prepared to 1 mg/mL in distilled water. Alexa Fluor 647 Anti-CD14 antibody (Imgenex, San 
Diego, CA), was used according to manufacturer’s directions. To determine the phenotypic characteristics of 
the rested MDM, cells were assayed, in triplicate, using conjugated anti-human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
CD11b-PE-Cy7, CD11c PerCP-Cy5.5, CD80-FITC, and CD86-BB515, CD163-PE and CD68-Alexa647 (BD 
Biosciences, San Diego, CA). MDM were stained with mAbs for 30 minutes at 4 °C, according to the manu-
facturer’s protocol, and washed twice in PBS buffer prior to measuring marker expression by flow cytometry. 
Prior to antibody staining, MDM Fc receptors were blocked with anti-Fc antibody (BD Biosciences, San Diego, 
CA) according to manufacturer’s suggestion. Isotype controls (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) suggested by the 
manufacturer for each monoclonal antibody were used to calculate the change in mean fluorescence intensities.
Fluorescence microscopy. 
MDM and Raw 264.7 were incubated with nicotine (100µmol/L) or ImI 
(1µmol/L) in 24 well plates for 16 h at 37 °C prior to the addition of fluorescent Alexa Fluor 594 α
-bungarotoxin 
(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) 
for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times in PBS prior to microscopic observations. An inverted epiflu-
orescence Accu-Scope EXI-310 with Scope LED fluorescence illuminator (Commack, NY, USA) was used to 
visualize the presence of nuclei and α
7 nAChR in cells during competition assays. An adapted MiniVid 5.1 MP 
camera and ToupView micro-image analysis software (LW Scientific Lawrenceville, GA, USA) was used to cap-
ture photographs.
Statistical analysis. 
Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed t-test where indicated. p < 0.05 
was considered significant. Experiments and measurements were performed in triplicate.
