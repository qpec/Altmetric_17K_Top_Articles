Millions of people die every year from diseases caused by exposure 
to outdoor air pollution1–5. Some studies have estimated premature 
mortality related to local sources of air pollution6,7, but local air 
quality can also be affected by atmospheric transport of pollution 
from distant sources8–18. International trade is contributing to the 
globalization of emission and pollution as a result of the production 
of goods (and their associated emissions) in one region for 
consumption in another region14,19–22. The effects of international 
trade on air pollutant emissions23, air quality14 and health24 have 
been investigated regionally, but a combined, global assessment of 
the health impacts related to international trade and the transport 
of atmospheric air pollution is lacking. Here we combine four global 
models to estimate premature mortality caused by fine particulate 
matter (PM2.5) pollution as a result of atmospheric transport and 
the production and consumption of goods and services in different 
world regions. We find that, of the 3.45 million premature deaths 
related to PM2.5 pollution in 2007 worldwide, about 12 per cent 
(411,100 deaths) were related to air pollutants emitted in a region 
of the world other than that in which the death occurred, and about 
22 per cent (762,400 deaths) were associated with goods and services 
produced in one region for consumption in another. For example, 
PM2.5 pollution produced in China in 2007 is linked to more than 
64,800 premature deaths in regions other than China, including 
more than 3,100 premature deaths in western Europe and the USA; 
on the other hand, consumption in western Europe and the USA is 
linked to more than 108,600 premature deaths in China. Our results 
reveal that the transboundary health impacts of PM2.5 pollution 
associated with international trade are greater than those associated 
with long-distance atmospheric pollutant transport.
Outdoor air pollution and the associated effects on health have 
 
typically been regarded as local or regional problems, with local or 
regional solutions. In response to the health risk caused by exposure 
to outdoor air pollution, many countries have adopted environmental 
 
policies to regulate major sources of outdoor air pollution such as 
 
industry, agriculture and transportation within their  
territories25. 
However, it is also increasingly recognized that air quality in a given 
location can be substantially affected by atmospheric  
transport 
of  
pollution from distant sources, including sources on other 
 
continents8–14. This transport of pollution indicates that  
premature 
 
mortality related to air pollution (that is, death of an individual before 
his or her life expectancy due to exposure to air pollution) is not only a 
local issue12,15–18. International trade is further globalizing the issue of 
air-pollution- 
related mortality by separating the locations where goods 
are  
consumed from the  
locations where the emissions and related pollu-
tion and mortality occur. Here we combine four state-of-the-art global 
 
models to estimate the premature mortality linked to global PM2.5 (fine 
 
particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μ 
m or less) 
air pollution; we attribute the global premature deaths not only to the 
pollution physically produced within the different regions, but also to 
pollution related to goods and services that are ultimately consumed 
in each region. We estimate premature mortality resulting from only 
PM2.5 pollution because previous studies have shown that this type 
of pollution accounts for more than 90% of the global mortality from 
outdoor air pollution1,5.
Beginning with a newly developed emissions inventory of primary 
air pollutants produced in 13 world regions in 2007 (Extended Data 
Fig. 1), we use a multi-regional input–output model of international 
trade to identify and isolate the emissions related to consumption 
and investment in each region in that year. (The methodology and 
data used for developing the production- and consumption-related 
 
emissions inventory is provided in Supplementary Information.) We 
then track the globally distributed PM2.5 pollution that is contributed 
by emissions produced in each region and by emissions associated 
with consumption in each region using the chemical transport model 
GEOS-Chem26. Next, following the methods of the Global Burden of 
Disease (GBD) Study1, we estimate the premature mortality due to 
exposure to  
outdoor PM2.5 related to production and consumption in 
each region; we apply the GEOS-Chem-modelled regional  
fractional 
contributions to  
mortality calculated using the high-resolution PM2.5 
concentrations from the GDB Study of 201327. PM2.5-related  
premature 
mortality linked to ischaemic heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is calculated by using an 
 
integrated exposure model2 that estimates the risk of premature 
 
mortality from each of the four diseases at different levels of exposure 
to PM2.5. Because errors propagated across multiple global models can 
be large, we  
conducted uncertainty analyses and made comparisons 
with independent data12,13,18,27,28 to demonstrate the robustness of our 
main findings. A description of these models, their integration and 
uncertainty, comparisons with other studies, and a comprehensive 
 
listing of all data sources and key references are provided in Methods 
and Supplementary Information.
We estimate that PM2.5-related premature mortality in 2007 was 3.45 
million (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.38–4.14 million; Extended 
Data Table 1; compare with 3.22 million deaths in 2010 reported by

the GBD Study1 and 3.15 million in 2010 by Lelieveld et al.6). Of this 
total, we attribute 2.52 million deaths (73.0%; 95% CI, 1.74–3.02  
million 
deaths) to production activities in specific regions. The related produc-
tion sectors include energy, industry, transportation, residential (both 
fossil fuels and biofuels) and agriculture. The remaining deaths are 
related to emissions from international shipping and aviation, which 
are difficult to assign to specific regions, or to emissions from  
natural 
sources such as biogenic emissions, field burning, forest fires and 
 
mineral dust, which are not directly related to consumption. Unless 
stated otherwise, the numbers of premature deaths reported hereafter 
 
correspond to only the deaths attributable to emissions from an iden-
tifiable production sector in a specific region (‘attributable deaths’) 
and do not include those related to the aforementioned unassignable 
or non-consumption-related emissions, and reflect median estimates 
rounded to the nearest hundred.
Figure 1a–d shows the global spatial distribution of premature deaths 
in 2007 due to PM2.5 air pollution produced in China, western Europe, 
the USA and India, respectively (see Extended Data Fig. 2a–i for maps for 
other regions). In each case, the greatest health impacts of  
pollution pro-
duced in a given region are local, but deaths in  
neighbouring and more 
distant regions are also evident, owing to intercontinental  
transport, 
particularly in downwind areas with dense populations. Our results are 
broadly consistent with previous transboundary pollution studies12,13,18, 
given the differences in methodology (Supplementary Information).
Figure 2a shows the percentage of deaths in each region due to emis-
sions in that and other regions. As expected, hotspots of mortality due 
to transboundary pollution occur in populous neighbouring regions. 
For example, 30,900 (95% CI, 14,100–47,700) deaths in the ‘rest of east 
Asia’ region (which includes Japan and South Korea) were related to 
emissions in China (Figs 1a, 2a) and 47,300 (95% CI, 20,300–74,400) 
deaths in eastern Europe were related to emissions in western Europe 
(Figs 1c, 2a). More distant effects are also evident: for example, 2,300 
(95% CI, 1,000–3,600) deaths in western Europe were related to 
 
pollution transported from the USA. Globally, 16.3% (95% CI, 
 
13.3%–19.3%) of the attributable deaths, or 12.0% (95% CI, 
 
9.8%–14.2%) of total PM2.5-related deaths, were caused by pollution 
produced in a region other than that in which the death occurred.
In addition to the physical transport of pollution in the  
atmosphere, 
international trade has an influence on the regions where health 
impacts are greatest by allowing the production of emissions to 
 
occur far from where goods and services are ultimately consumed. 
Figure 1e–h shows the distribution of deaths in 2007 due to PM2.5 
 
pollution related to goods and services consumed in the  
representative 
regions (see Extended Data Fig. 3a–i for maps for other regions). 
For each region, compared to the distribution of deaths attributable 
to the direct production of emissions, consumption-related deaths 
are  
scattered more widely around the world owing to international 
 
trade (Fig. 1).

Figure 2b shows the percentage of deaths in each region due to emis-
sions related to consumption in that and other regions. Regionally, the 
share of deaths in a given region that are related to goods and services 
consumed elsewhere varies from 15.2% (95% CI, 14.2%–16.3%) in the 
more-isolated, less-developed region of sub-Saharan Africa to 53.7% 
(95% CI, 44.2%–63.2%) in the high-energy-exporting region of Russia 
(Fig. 2b). The transboundary health impacts related to international 
trade are much greater than those related to atmospheric transport. 
For example, 4.1% (95% CI, 1.1%–7.1%) of the attributable deaths in 
the USA are related to consumption in western Europe, whereas only 
0.2% (95% CI, 0.1%–0.4%) are related to transboundary transport of 
pollution from western Europe. The ‘spillover’ effect in neighbouring 
regions is also noteworthy: 34.3% (95% CI, 19.9%–48.7%) of deaths in 
the ‘rest of east Asia’ region are attributable to the combined effects of 
the advection of pollution and international trade from China. Globally, 
30.2% (95% CI, 25.4%–35.0%) of the attributable deaths, or 22.2% 
(95% CI, 18.7%–25.7%) of total PM2.5-related deaths, were caused by 
 
pollution produced in a region other than that in which the related 
goods and services were ultimately consumed.
International trade allows production and consumption activities 
to be physically separated, with emissions occurring within the region 
where the goods are produced and related health impacts concentrated

Figure 3 | Emissions, changes in air quality and premature mortality 
embodied in trade. a–c, Maps show differences between production- 
and consumption-based accounting of SO2 emissions (a; in units of 
megatonnes of SO2 per year), population-weighted average PM2.5 exposure 
(b; in units of micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic metre) or premature 
mortality due to PM2.5 air pollution (c; deaths per year). In each case,  
net importers are shown in shades of red and net exporters in shades of 
blue. Although the emissions embodied in exports from regions such as 
Latin America, Canada, sub-Saharan Africa and Australia are greater  
than the emissions embodied in their imports (blue shading in a), the 
PM2.5 exposure and mortality embodied in imports to those regions are 
greater than the exposure and mortality embodied in their exports  
(red shading in b and c). The differences are due to differences in 
population density (b) and the marginal health impacts of emissions (c)  
in regions such as China, Europe, India and the ‘rest of Asia’ region  
(that is, central and southeast Asia), which are the source of many of the 
goods imported by other regions. The USA, western Europe and the ‘rest 
of east Asia’ region (including South Korea and Japan) are net importers of 
pollution, exposure and deaths. Note that Mongolia, North Korea, South 
Korea and Japan are grouped into a single region (‘rest of east Asia’), which 
tends to overemphasize the effect of trade, in Mongolia in particular.

within that producing region and nearby downwind regions, all 
of which might be far from the regions where those goods are 
 
ultimately consumed. Figure 3 shows the net effect of international 
trade on emissions, PM2.5 exposure and mortality in each region, 
 
quantified, for each parameter, as the difference between its value 
when assigned according to the region where goods and services were 
consumed and when assigned according to the location of  
production. 
Taking SO2 (a key precursor of secondary PM2.5) as an example, Fig. 3a 
 
shows the difference between where SO2 emissions were physically 
produced and where the related goods and services were consumed, 
thereby highlighting the emissions embodied in the net trade of goods 
and services among the 13 regions, in 2007. The most developed 
regions of the world, such as the USA, western Europe and the ‘rest of 
east Asia’ region, are importers of net embodied emissions: they tend 
to import goods and services from China and less-developed neigh-
bouring areas, thereby causing pollution in those regions. China is the 
world’s largest exporter of embodied emissions, with large quantities of 
SO2 embodied in exports to the aforementioned three regions.
In turn, emissions displaced via trade are transported in the 
 
atmosphere, which then affects population exposure to the pollution. 
Figure 3b shows the difference between global, population-weighted 
mean concentrations of PM2.5 due to the emissions produced in each 
region and those due to the emissions related to the goods and services 
consumed in each region—that is, the PM2.5 exposure that is embodied 
in net trade. Although similar to the pattern of the emissions  
embodied 
in trade (Fig. 3a), these changes in air quality highlight cases for 
which there are populous areas downwind of where the emissions are 
 
produced. For example, emissions embodied in Chinese exports have a 
disproportionately large effect on exposure in population-dense regions 
(for example, Japan and South Korea) that are near to and downwind 
of China (Figs 1, 3b).
Finally, Fig. 3c shows the PM2.5-related premature mortality 
 
embodied in net trade, which incorporates the emissions displaced via 
trade, the subsequent changes in air quality as pollution is transported 
in the atmosphere, and the health impacts of poor air quality. Given 
China’s population density, high emission intensity, large proportion 
of exports, and the large populations of neighbouring regions, Chinese 
exports embody a greater number of deaths than do exports from any 
other region (Fig. 3c). By contrast, net imports to the USA and western 
Europe embody the greatest number of deaths (Fig. 3c).
Figure 4 summarizes premature mortality due to both advection 
of PM2.5 air pollution and displacement of pollution via international 
trade with a series of bar charts. The per-capita mortality is presented 
in Extended Data Fig. 6 as an indicator of the emissions produced per 
person in a country and the relative health impacts of those emissions 
(see details in Methods). Figure 4a shows that emissions produced in 
China cause more than twice the number of deaths worldwide than 
do the emissions produced in any other region, followed by emissions 
produced in India and the ‘rest of Asia’ region. Figure 4e shows that 
when these deaths are allocated according to where the related goods 
and services are consumed, China and India still dominate, consistent 
with the health impacts of air pollution being mostly local; however, 
the roles of western Europe and the USA are also highlighted by the 
consumption-based perspective (Fig. 4a, e).
Figure 4d shows the premature mortality in each region due to 
emissions produced in other regions, revealing the substantial health 
impacts of transboundary pollution in the ‘rest of east Asia’ region, 
India and eastern Europe. When trade effects are also included, the 
transboundary health impacts increase markedly, particularly in China 
and other emerging markets (for example, India and Russia), and in 
more-developed downwind regions (for example, the ‘rest of east Asia’ 
region, which includes Japan and South Korea) (Fig. 4h). In turn, 
 
consumption in western Europe, the USA and the ‘rest of Asia’ region 
corresponds to the greatest number of deaths in other regions (Fig. 4g).
Our findings quantify the extent to which air pollution is a global 
problem. In our global economy, the goods and services consumed in 
one region may entail production of large quantities of air  
pollution—
and related mortality—in other regions. If the cost of imported

LETTER RESEARCH
 
products is lower because of less stringent air pollution controls in 
 
the regions where they are produced, then the consumer savings 
may come at the expense of lives lost elsewhere29,30. Regional policies 
that regulate air quality by imposing a price on pollutant emissions 
may be effective, and in some cases a considerable proportion of the 
 
overall costs of such policies might be shared with consumers in other 
regions (see Fig. 3a). However, there is some evidence that the  
polluting 
industries have tended to migrate to regions with more permissive 
environmental regulations29,30, suggesting that there may be tension 
between efforts to improve air quality in a given region and to attract 
direct foreign investment. Improving pollution control technologies 
in China, India and elsewhere in Asia would have a disproportionately 
large health benefit in those regions and worldwide, and international 
cooperation to support such pollution abatement efforts and to reduce 
‘leakage’ of emission via international trade is in the global interest.

METHODS
Integrated model framework. This study required integration of data, models and 
methods from multiple sources and scientific disciplines, as depicted in Extended 
Data Fig. 7. We first developed a global inventory of all major sources of anthro-
pogenic air pollution emissions in 228 countries and regions for the year 2007, 
disaggregating emissions from 62 subsectors (as opposed to aggregated sectors in 
available global inventories). We then used a global multi-regional input–output 
model (MRIO)31,32 based on data from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)33 
to re-attribute the emissions produced by these different sectors according to the 
demand of consumers for finished goods. The MRIO thus traces all emissions 
related to consumed goods back to the original sources of produced emissions, 
even if the supply chain of the consumed products encompasses intermediate 
inputs (for example, parts) and services (for example, assembly and transport) 
from multiple sectors across multiple regions. Prior to the re-attribution, the 
production-based global emission inventory was mapped to 129 regions and 
 
57 sectors in GTAP to facilitate the MRIO analysis. Next, we used the GEOS-
Chem chemical transport model26 to track physical transport of emissions in the 
 
atmosphere, obtaining the fractional contribution of each region to global near- 
surface PM2.5 concentrations from both production and consumption  
perspectives 
by a zero-out approach. These derived ratios were multiplied by high-resolution 
global PM2.5 concentration data27 developed for the Global Burden of Disease Study 
of 2013 (GBD2013) to obtain the PM2.5 exposure levels from both  
production and 
consumption perspectives. Given the computational constraints of the  
chemical 
transport model, the GEOS-Chem modelling required further  
geographical 
aggregation. We classified the world into 13 regions on the basis of their level of 
economic development, regions in the trade model and levels of air pollution: 
China, rest of east Asia, India, rest of Asia, Russia, western Europe, eastern Europe, 
Middle East and north Africa, USA, Canada, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa 
 
and rest of the world. The classifications used to sort the 228 countries into these 
13 regions are shown in Supplementary Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1. Finally, 
we applied the Integrated Exposure-Response (IER) model2 to evaluate the effect of 
changes in PM2.5 concentrations to premature mortality,  
summing across regions 
to obtain the global PM2.5 mortality related to both emissions produced and goods 
consumed in each region. See Supplementary Information for further details of 
all of the above steps.
We conducted comprehensive uncertainty analyses, integrating errors in all 
steps, and compared our results with independent data. In summary, we  
estimate 
uncertainty (P = 
 0.005) associated with production-based emissions using 
 
distributions of key parameters derived from the literature, expert judgments 
and measurement data for each industrial subsector in each of the 13 regions. 
Our estimates are generally consistent with the HTAP v2.2 emission inventory28, 
which represents the state-of-the-art understanding of global emissions. We 
also  
evaluated  
uncertainty related to our modelling of atmospheric transport 
(including sensitivity  
analyses of nonlinear effects and neglected emissions of 
non-methane volatile organic compounds) and compared our results to both 
ground-based observations and GBD PM2.5 concentrations. Our results on trans-
boundary  
transport of PM2.5 are  
generally consistent with the HTAP study13 when 
 
harmonizing the model domain and target species. We assessed the uncertainties 
of our mortality estimates by  
varying the applicable parameters in our IER model 
across 1,000 trials; our  
estimates of mortality are very close to those from the 
GBD Study1 and by Lelieveld et al.6. Details of these analyses are presented in 
Supplementary Information.
Per-capita mortality due to transported pollution and traded products. 
Extended Data Fig. 6a shows that the emissions produced per one million people 
in eastern Europe result in 1,027 (95% CI, 749–1,306) PM2.5-related deaths around 
the world—a greater impact per capita than any other region. Having the world’s 
largest population, per-capita impacts in China are quite substantial: the  
emissions 
produced per one million people in China cause 770 (95% CI, 529–1,014) deaths 
worldwide (Extended Data Fig. 6a). In terms of consumption, consumers in 
 
affluent regions such as western Europe, the USA and Canada are associated with 
a greater-than-average number of PM2.5-related deaths worldwide (Extended 
Data Fig. 6e). Further, a disproportionate number of those deaths occurred in 
regions other than that in which the products were consumed: for every one million 
 
consumers in western Europe, Canada and the USA, 416 (95% CI, 303–530), 395 
(95% CI, 268–522) and 339 (95% CI, 231–448) PM2.5-related deaths, respectively, 
occurred in other regions (Extended Data Fig. 6g). Per capita, eastern Europe and 
Russia suffered more of these transboundary deaths than did any other region: 
per one million people in those regions, 531 (95% CI, 335–727) and 365 (95% CI, 
278–453) died, respectively, as a result of products consumed elsewhere (Extended 
Data Fig. 6h).
