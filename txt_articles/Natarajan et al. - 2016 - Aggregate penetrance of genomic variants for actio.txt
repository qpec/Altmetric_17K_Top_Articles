 Abstract
In populations that have not been selected for family history of disease, it is unclear how 
commonly pathogenic variants (PVs) in disease-associated genes for rare Mendelian conditions 
are found and how often they are associated with clinical features of these conditions. We 
conducted independent, prospective analyses of participants in two community-based 
epidemiological studies to test the hypothesis that persons carrying PVs in any of 56 genes that 
lead to 24 dominantly inherited, actionable conditions are more likely to exhibit the clinical 
features of the corresponding diseases than those without PVs. Among 462 European American 
Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and 3223 African-American Jackson Heart Study (JHS) 
participants who were exome-sequenced, we identified and classified 642 and 4429 unique 
variants, respectively, in these 56 genes while blinded to clinical data. In the same participants, we 
ascertained related clinical features from the participants’ clinical history of cancer and most 
recent echocardiograms, electrocardiograms, and lipid measurements, without knowledge of 
variant classification. PVs were found in 5 FHS (1.1%) and 31 JHS (1.0%) participants. Carriers 
of PVs were more likely than expected, on the basis of incidence in noncarriers, to have related 
clinical features in both FHS (80.0% versus 12.4%) and JHS (26.9% versus 5.4%), yielding 
standardized incidence ratios of 6.4 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7 to 16.5; P = 7 × 10−4) in 
FHS and 4.7 (95% CI, 1.9 to 9.7; P = 3 × 10−4) in JHS. Individuals unselected for family history 
who carry PVs in 56 genes for actionable conditions have an increased aggregated risk of 
developing clinical features associated with the corresponding diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Clinical exome and genome sequencing is increasingly applied in the practice of medicine, 
but many challenges remain (1–5). There has been extensive discussion of the merits of 
selection, ascertainment, and reporting of incidental or secondary findings that come to light 
during sequencing, especially when they may be of medical value to patients and their 
families (6–8). In 2013, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) 
recommended that laboratories providing clinical sequencing for any medical indication 
should search for and report pathogenic variants (PVs) in 56 genes (the ACMG56) that 
represent 24 rare Mendelian conditions for which there are recommended treatments (7, 9). 
The ACMG recommendations have generated debate (10, 11), in part because the risk 
associated with PVs in families with many affected relatives is not always the same for 
persons whose families are not enriched with affected relatives (12–15), and thus it has been 
unclear whether in the absence of a family history these variants truly represent an increase 
in risk.
In addition, large-scale biobanks are being sequenced for research purposes, and 
investigators are struggling with recent recommendations about whether and how to return 
genomic findings of potential medical importance to participants and their family members 
(8, 16). Although the genes and variants to be returned are not specified in these 
recommendations, the ACMG56 have become a convenient starting point for these 
discussions and for the generation of lists of genes that are actually being reported to the 
participants. For example, information about the ACMG56, with some modifications, is 
being returned to the participants by some sites within the eMERGE III (Electronic Medical

 Records and Genomics Phase III) network (17), as well as the Geisinger MyCode research 
project (18). These research initiatives presage the use of genome sequencing for population 
screening and raise the issue of whether this is appropriate (19–23).
Estimating the association between specific PVs in individual genes for rare Mendelian 
conditions and clinical phenotypes in an unselected population is challenging because PVs 
associated with Mendelian diseases are rare, variants are difficult to categorize with 
confidence, even among experts (24), and clinical phenotypes unrelated to known genetic 
changes are relatively common in the general population. Because most of what we know in 
genetics has been from patients presenting to specialized clinics, and there have been few 
population-based estimates of variant penetrance, it is surprisingly difficult to demonstrate 
the seemingly straightforward idea that unselected persons carrying PVs in a group of genes 
known to be associated with disease are actually at increased risk for those conditions or to 
estimate the effect size of this increased risk. To address this, we devised an unbiased 
method to prospectively examine the aggregate association between PVs in a set of genes 
and clinical features among research participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) 
and, separately, in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), all of whom had been exome-sequenced 
and systematically phenotyped. In these two independent populations, we tested the 
hypothesis that participants with PVs in any of the ACMG56 genes were more likely to 
exhibit related clinical features (RCFs) than would be expected in participants without a PV.
RESULTS
Participant description
The FHS participants were drawn from the FHS Offspring cohort [n = 290, 35.7% female; 
mean age at enrollment, 36.8 (SD, 9.3) years] and the FHS Generation 3 cohort (n = 172, 
35.7% female; mean age at enrollment, 44.5 (SD, 8.9) years]. All FHS participants were 
European American, and comprehensive clinical phenotypes were gleaned from the most 
recent clinical examination. The participants in the FHS cohort were followed for an average 
of 20.4 (SD, 14.3) years. Among the 3223 JHS participants, all were African-American, 
62.4% were female, and mean age at enrollment was 55.6 (SD, 12.8) years. The JHS 
participants are being followed longitudinally, but comprehensive clinical phenotypes were 
only available from the baseline examination.
Overview of study design and phenotype characterization
We designed a procedure for unbiased analysis of the association between exome 
sequencing and phenotype data from 462 participants in the FHS and 3223 participants in 
the JHS. Family history was not considered in selecting participants for enrollment in either 
cohort, nor was it considered in the selection of participants for sequencing. Without 
knowledge of the phenotypes, we classified all variants in the ACMG56 genes, using a 
previously described multistep algorithm (25, 26) and following recently revised ACMG 
variant classification recommendations (27). We tabulated RCFs (Table 1) corresponding to 
the 24 disease conditions associated with the ACMG56 from clinical records of the FHS and 
JHS participants while blinded to the results of sequencing.

 Variant classification
By analyzing exomes, we identified 642 unique variants within the ACMG56 genes in the 
462 FHS participants and 4429 unique variants in the 3223 JHS participants, and then 
subsequently classified these while blinded to the phenotype information (see Materials and 
Methods). Among FHS participants, we identified five PVs in five individuals (1.1% of the 
FHS cohort) and two likely PVs (LPVs) in two individuals (0.4% of the FHS cohort). 
Among JHS participants, we identified 19 PVs in 31 individuals (1.0% of the JHS cohort) 
and 4 LPVs in 4 individuals (0.1% of the JHS cohort). A description of the variants 
classified as PVs and LPVs, along with the presence or absence of clinical features 
suggestive of the corresponding diseases, is shown in Table 2 for the FHS participants and 
Table 3 for the JHS participants. A listing of the specific transcripts that corresponded to the 
sequenced genes is shown in table S1, and the evidence from the literature that we used to 
classify variants into PVs and LPVs from FHS and JHS participants is described in table S2. 
Variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) in the ACMG56 were identified in 146 FHS 
participants (31.6%) and 917 JHS participants (28.5%). The ACMG guidelines do not 
recommend returning VUSs, so these were excluded from further analysis.
Comparison of observed and expected proportions of phenotypes
To examine our primary hypothesis, we tested whether carriers of PVs in any of the 
ACMG56 genes were more likely to exhibit corresponding RCFs than would be expected in 
participants without a PV. We compared the observed number of RCFs in individuals with 
any PV to the expected number, assuming that the fraction of carriers of particular PVs who 
exhibited an RCF was equal to the fraction of noncarriers exhibiting those RCFs (see 
Materials and Methods). Of five FHS participants with PVs, four displayed an RCF, and this 
proportion (80%) was higher than expected (12.4%; one-sided binomial mixture test, P = 7 × 
10−4). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR), which is the ratio of observed RCFs among 
those with PVs to the number expected on the basis of incidence rates among those without 
PVs, was 6.4 in the FHS [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7 to 16.5]. Of 26 JHS participants 
with PVs, 7 displayed an RCF, and this proportion (26.9%) was also higher than expected 
(5.4%; P = 3 × 10−4), corresponding to an SIR of 4.7 (95% CI, 1.9 to 9.7). The addition of 
LPV carriers to this analysis to estimate SIR for PVs and LPVs together yielded similar 
results [SIR, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 12.6 in FHS (P = 0.004) and SIR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.8 to 8.4 in 
JHS (P = 2 × 10−4)]. Preplanned secondary analyses of individuals with cancer and 
cardiovascular diseases revealed that the incidence of RCFs was also significantly higher 
than expected for carriers of PVs associated with cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Table 
4).
Description of individuals carrying PVs
In the FHS, a participant with an LDLR nonsense variant (p.Cys143*) had an untreated low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of 195 mg/dl (optimal <130 mg/dl). Notably, this 
individual was selected for sequencing in a hypertension study and thus was not selected for 
sequencing on the basis of her lipid status. A participant with a pathogenic missense variant 
in MYBPC3 (p.Arg502Trp) had manifestations of dilated cardiomyopathy. Two participants 
with two different BRCA2 frameshift variants (p.Leu1466Phefs*2 and p.Thr1738Ilefs*2)

 had (respectively) grade 3 (poorly differentiated), Gleason score 5 prostate cancer diagnosed 
at age 78 and ductal carcinoma in situ breast cancer at age 55. Neither of the individuals 
carrying LPVs had RCFs. No PV or LPV carrier was a first-degree relative of another 
carrier.
In the JHS, there were three individuals who had PVs in cancer predisposition genes who 
reported a history of cancer, although the type of cancer was not recorded. An individual 
with a BRCA2 frameshift mutation (p.Val220Ilefs*2) was diagnosed with cancer at age 60. 
A carrier of MLH1 p.Arg687Trp was diagnosed with cancer at age 36. A carrier of TP53 
p.Arg273His, who was enrolled at age 93, reported a diagnosis of cancer at age 89. A carrier 
of MYH7 p.Ala797Thr had left ventricular hypertrophy with an interventricular septal 
thickness of 13.2 mm and posterior wall thickness of 12.8 mm (normal, <11 mm). Carriers 
of KCNQ1 p.Arg518* and KCNQ1 p.Val205Met had corrected QT (QTc) intervals of 477 
and 494 ms [normal, <440 ms in men and <460 ms in women]. Furthermore, a carrier of the 
LPV KCNQ1 p.Gly179Ser had a QTc interval of 506 ms. A participant with LDLR 
p.Pro685Leu had a markedly elevated untreated LDL cholesterol level (357.5 mg/dl; 
optimal, <130 mg/dl). One family of six, and two additional pairs of first-degree relatives 
each harbored the same PV, but none of these 10 individuals displayed an RCF, and thus 
familial presence of the same variant did not inflate the observed association.
DISCUSSION
In genetics, penetrance is the proportion of individuals harboring a particular variant who 
exhibit, or eventually exhibit, the associated disease (28). Estimating the penetrance of PVs 
in populations that are not enriched for family history is a challenge because specific PVs in 
any given gene are rare, and therefore an exceedingly large population would need to be 
systematically examined over many years to ascertain accurate phenotype information, 
which could emerge at any time in the lifetime of the individual. Our analyses do not address 
the penetrance of specific variants within individual genes. Instead, we tested whether 
pathogenic variants in a set of genes are collectively associated with RCFs for those 
conditions, and, if so, what is the effect size of this aggregated association. To answer this 
question, we conducted two separate, prospective, hypothesis-driven analyses of 462 
European Americans and 3223 African-Americans for a group of 56 genes associated with 
disease conditions where early intervention could lead to prevention or better outcomes. We 
found that persons carrying PVs in a subset of these 56 genes demonstrate an increased 
aggregate risk of having clinical features associated with that gene in both the FHS (an 
entirely European American population) and JHS (an entirely African-American 
population). The difference in percentages of the cohort with the phenotypes of interest may 
be due to an enhanced healthy volunteer effect among the JHS cohort or to the fact that 
phenotypes were collected prospectively over several examinations spanning the course of 
decades in FHS but were based on a single examination thus far in JHS.
The frequencies we found for PVs and LPVs in the FHS and JHS populations are similar to 
recent assessments of PVs in medically actionable genes among large collections of 
individuals with exome sequences (29, 30) and to others who have reported variants in the 
ACMG56 among collections of exomes or genomes (31, 32). As in these reports, most of the

 PVs described here are predicted to encode null alleles and result in haploinsufficiency, a 
well-defined mechanism of pathogenicity for most genetic diseases. The range of 
frequencies for PVs in these other studies (from 0.8 to ~5%) could reflect differences in how 
the various populations were identified and recruited, but more likely reflect variability in 
variant classification. As we have demonstrated (24), even expert laboratories struggle to 
achieve complete concordance in variant classification. These issues reinforce the need to 
apply rigorous standards for variant classification and to share variant classification through 
mechanisms such as ClinGen (33), and also underscore the methodological importance of 
blinded variant classification in these analyses.
Understanding the association between PVs and RCFs in the general population is necessary 
for the informed use of genomics to evaluate patients for secondary findings (sometimes 
characterized as opportunistic screening) and for the use of sequencing in asymptomatic 
individuals (population screening) (19, 34, 35), but data to support or refute these practices 
are scarce. In a separate study of FHS participants, 21% of individuals with PVs in 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy genes had clinical features suggestive of cardiomyopathy, a 
lower proportion than expected in multiplex families but a higher proportion than in persons 
without such variants (36). Specific founder mutations for long QT syndrome among the 
Finnish population are far from fully penetrant but are still highly associated with 
prolongation of QT interval in the relatively homogeneous Finnish population (37). 
However, analyses of medical records for evidence of cardiac arrhythmias did not 
demonstrate detectable penetrance of PVs in arrythmia-related genes, perhaps because 
variant classification was suboptimal (38, 39). Screening for Lynch syndrome has been 
piloted among incident cases of colorectal cancer (40) but not among cancer-free 
individuals. A substantially increased risk for breast cancer associated with BRCA variants 
has recently been demonstrated (41), prompting a call for population-based screening of 
women around the age of 30 (42). For other genes and variants that are highly penetrant in 
multiplex families, an increased likelihood of clinical features among carriers cannot always 
be demonstrated in the general population: Individuals with well-established PVs for 
mature-onset diabetes of the young in the FHS and JHS do not exhibit an increased 
likelihood of having type 2 diabetes or impaired fasting glucose (43). Thus, the literature 
contains mixed results as to whether PVs in some genes, even some of the genes included 
among the ACMG56, individually confer increased risk of disease in populations that are 
not selected for family history.
Estimations of gene-disease association are traditionally conceptualized as penetrance on a 
gene-by-gene and variant-by-variant basis, and predicting the likelihood of a phenotype 
from a particular variant in a particular gene is difficult when disease prevalence is low and 
carrier status prevalence is rare. However, there may be value in aggregating PVs across a 
number of genes to consider the prior probability as a compound hypothesis relating to 
numerous diseases. For example, among 951 individuals exome-sequenced as part of the 
ClinSeq cohort, 103 (10.8%) had putative loss-of-function variants in a large number of 
genes likely to cause a phenotype in heterozygotes (44). In ClinSeq, intensive targeted 
phenotyping of 79 of these individuals revealed 34 (43%) with personal or family histories 
that could be attributed to that gene. That analysis deliberately started with the PVs among a 
population recruited in part for cardiovascular risk and then searched for the corresponding

 phenotype in that participant or the participant’s family, often uncovering evidence of a 
previously unrecognized but non–life-threatening genetic condition. In our analyses, we 
approached both variant classification and the tabulation of RCFs independently and blinded 
to each other and examined their association in a subset of genes that have been linked to 
life-threatening conditions in which early intervention or surveillance could potentially 
mitigate risk.
Our study has several important limitations. These analyses only examined the aggregate 
association of PVs with RCFs from the corresponding conditions but did not address the 
penetrance of individual variants or PVs within a specific gene, because this would have 
required vastly larger sample sizes. Although the FHS and JHS participants were neither 
enrolled nor sequenced on the basis of family history, the selection of participants for exome 
sequencing in FHS was based on their involvement in other studies and may therefore not be 
representative of the entire FHS population. This was not the case in the JHS where all 
consenting participants with available DNA were exome-sequenced. Our variant 
classification strategy may have missed some disease-associated variants by dismissing 
novel missense variants of unknown function from consideration (45). The a priori definition 
of both observed and expected RCFs in our analysis included any cancer, thus the cancers 
associated with PVs and the cancers counted in the comparison populations were 
appropriately included; however, had cancer cases been considered RCFs only when they 
had an onset early in life, the differences between the observed and expected penetrance of 
this group of variants might have been different. It is possible that some of the identified PVs 
occurred in multiplex families, although none of the participants were selected for 
sequencing based on family history. In JHS, a family of six individuals carried PKP2 
p.Arg413*, a PV expected to result in arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, but none 
of the family members displayed features of right ventricular abnormalities by 
echocardiography; therefore, the observed association was not inflated. The number of 
individuals with LPVs was too small to independently analyze this group, but adding PVs 
and LPVs together did not change the strength or significance of the association within each 
population.
These limitations are balanced by a number of strengths. The FHS and JHS cohorts are 
exceptionally well-studied populations where both sequence data and high-quality clinical 
data, including electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and lipid levels, were available for all 
participants, not just those who had been recognized by the medical care system as patients. 
Aside from 25 FHS participants who were selected for sequencing on the basis of elevated 
LDL cholesterol, none of the participants were selected for sequencing on the basis of 
phenotypes examined in our analysis, and none of those identified in Table 2 with lipid 
abnormalities were from those 25 individuals. In addition, we pre-specified our hypothesis 
and compared PVs and RCFs that were ascertained and classified independently of each 
other. Any misclassifications of variants, or censoring of phenotypes due to participant 
dropout or death, would be expected to bias the results toward the null. Performing these 
analyses in cohorts where all participants undergo phenotyping is advantageous, but even 
such systematic testing may incompletely capture some RCFs, such as right ventricular 
abnormalities on echocardiography for arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, limiting 
the ability to detect phenotypes and further biasing toward the null. The relatively few

 individuals with PVs in the ACMG56 is reflected in a wide CI for the analysis of each 
cohort; nevertheless, despite the small numbers and limited power, the associations range 
from a lower bound that is moderately strong to an upper bound that is extremely strong. 
Although aggregating that the exposure improves power, the combined carrier rate is low in 
a sample size of 3685, thereby limiting effect estimate precision. However, offsetting this 
issue is the fact that we independently demonstrated association in two ethnically distinct 
cohorts with similar relative effect estimates.
The ACMG recommendations for the return of secondary findings were expressly 
formulated for use in clinical sequencing (7). However, other groups have recommended the 
return of genomic variants that have medical actionability in research participants who 
request such information (8, 46), and the ACMG recommendations for clinical sequencing 
have been suggested as a basis for selecting the appropriate list of genes and category of 
variant (47). As large-scale, hospital-based, national biobanks begin to generate genomic 
data, and research initiatives like the Precision Medicine Initiative affirm the right of 
research participants to have access to their research results (48), guidance regarding the 
management of such findings is urgently needed. It is important to note that it has not been 
demonstrated that detecting such variants actually results in improved health outcomes, and 
to many, the absence of this evidence remains a compelling objection to both opportunistic 
and population screening. Our results should be replicated in other populations that are 
followed for clinical outcomes and should be interpreted with caution, but may help inform 
the emerging debate about whether and how to offer the return of individual genomic results 
to participants in research cohorts and biobanks, as well as in clinical sequencing.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
We designed and carried out two independent analyses to estimate the association between 
PVs derived from exome sequencing in any of 56 genes and clinical features related to the 
actionable Mendelian conditions that have been linked to these genes. We examined all of 
the participants who had been sequenced at the time of the analysis in FHS and JHS, and 
used systematically collected phenotype information from each. Variants were classified as 
described below without knowledge of the clinical phenotypes, and phenotypes were 
assessed without knowledge of the variants. The association was estimated within each 
cohort independently, providing replication of the results.
Participants
The FHS is a multigenerational, longitudinal study of European Americans established in 
1948 in Framingham, MA. Participants in this analysis were from FHS Offspring (children 
and spouses of the Original cohort) and Generation 3 (children of the Offspring) cohorts (49, 
50). Offspring participants were examined every 4 to 8 years, for a total of eight exams. 
Generation 3 participants were examined twice. The JHS is a prospective, longitudinal study 
of African-Americans established in 1998 in Jackson, MS. The details of the cohort, 
including sampling, recruitment, and examinations, have been previously described (51–53).

 For the FHS, as part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome 
Sequencing Project (ESP), FHS Offspring and Generation 3 participants were selected for 
exome sequencing as follows: 41 cases and 135 controls for a study of myocardial 
infarction, 80 cases and 86 controls for a study of blood pressure, 13 cases and 12 controls 
for a study of LDL cholesterol, 30 cases with stroke, and 65 FHS participants who were 
randomly selected.
For the JHS, we analyzed genomic and phenotype data from participants who consented to 
DNA collection during the first examination (2000 to 2004). Exome sequencing was 
completed for all consenting JHS participants (3273 of the 5301 participants).
These studies were performed using protocols approved by ethics committees at FHS and 
JHS and by their institutional review boards, with informed consent from all participants.
Exome sequencing
Exome sequencing, variant detection, and quality control steps for the FHS samples have 
been previously described (54). Briefly, exome capture used either Agilent SureSelect 
Human All Exon v2 kit (55), or Roche/NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library v1.0 
(~32 Mb; Roche NimbleGen EZ Cap v1) or EZ Cap v2 (~34 Mb). Enriched exome libraries 
were sequenced on an Illumina GAIIx or HiSeq 2000, aligned to human reference 
(GRCh37) using BWA (56), followed by duplicate removal, indel realignment, base quality 
score recalibration, and variant detection using Genome Analysis Toolkit (57).
Variant classification
Variants were adjudicated independently by two evaluators who made their classifications 
without any knowledge of the phenotype data and any differences resolved by consultation 
with a third evaluator. Variant classification was completed using a multistep algorithm as 
described (25, 26, 45) and was consistent with both the ACMG recommendation for 
secondary findings (7) and the more recently developed ACMG recommendations for 
variant classification (27).
Transcripts for analysis were those previously selected by the Partners HealthCare 
Laboratory for Molecular Medicine, a CLIA–certified molecular diagnostic laboratory, and 
were typically the longest (see table S1). Copy number variants were not evaluated because 
of the diversity of capture methods and sequencing platforms used for this data set. For 
variant classification, Alamut (Interactive Biosoftware) (58) and Variant Effect Predictor 
(59) were used to aggregate variant annotations from multiple sources, including transcript 
information and evolutionary conservation from the University of California Santa Cruz 
genome browser (60), and minor allele frequency from the ESP [Exome Variant Server, 
NHLBI ESP, Seattle, WA (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/), 15 December 2011] 
database, 1000 Genomes Project (http://browser.1000genomes.org/), and Exome 
Aggregation Consortium (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/) browsers. Previously published 
variants were identified by filtering against the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) 
Professional (61), GeneInsight (62), and ClinVar (63) databases, the latter two databases 
were also used in variant classification to obtain additional unpublished data on HGMD-
selected variants.

 Only missense variants that had previously been reported in an index case, denoted as 
“disease mutations” in the HGMD nomenclature or classified as pathogenic by at least one 
clinical laboratory in ClinVar, as well as nonsense, frameshift, and splice variants, were 
considered. Variants previously reported only in the context of functional or in silico 
experiments, but not previously associated with a symptomatic individual, were not further 
considered.
Variants were classified as PV if, in addition to being absent or at a frequency in population 
databases not inconsistent with their disease penetrance: (i) They were protein-truncating 
variants (nonsense, frameshift, or ±1,2 splice) in a gene where loss of function is a well-
established disease mechanism, and the variant was expected to result in nonsense-mediated 
decay; (ii) literature review identified significant segregation with disease (defined as ≥10 
meioses); or (iii) literature review identified moderate segregation with disease (5 to 9 
meioses), and the amino acid was conserved in at least mammals and birds, or the impact of 
the variant was supported by strong functional data. Variants were classified as an LPV if, in 
addition to being absent or at a frequency in population databases not inconsistent with their 
disease penetrance: (i) Literature review showed moderate segregation (5 to 9 meioses) with 
disease, the amino acid was conserved in all mammals and birds, but functional data were 
either limited or absent; (ii) literature review identified minimal familial segregation (<5 
meioses), but the amino acid was both conserved in all mammals and supported by strong 
functional data; or (iii) they were protein-truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift, or ±1,2 
splice) in a gene where loss-of-function variants have been observed but was not yet a well-
established disease mechanism, and the variant was expected to result in nonsense-mediated 
decay. Variants were classified as benign if the frequency of the variant was above 0.3% for 
variants associated with dominantly inherited diseases. All other variants were classified as 
VUS.
For secondary analyses, we grouped the ACMG genes into 23 that are cancer-related (APC, 
BRCA1, BRCA2, MEN1, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NF2, PMS2, PTEN, RB1, RET, 
SDHD, SDHAF2, SDHB, SDHC, STK11, TP53, TSC1, TSC2, VHL, and WT1) and 31 that 
are cardiovascular-related (ACTC1, GLA, LMNA, MYBPC3, MYH7, MYL2, MYL3, 
PRKAG2, TNNT2, TNNI3, TPM1, DSC2, DSG2, DSP, PKP2, TMEM43, KCNH2, 
KCNQ1, SCN5A, RYR2, ACTA2, COL3A1, FBN1, MYLK, MYH11, SMAD3, TGFBR1, 
TGFBR2, APOB, LDLR, and PCSK9). Two genes conferring susceptibility to malignant 
hyperthermia (CACNA1S and RYR1) were not considered in the secondary analyses.
Phenotype data
FHS phenotypes were downloaded from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) 
and were available throughout the period of follow-up, whereas JHS phenotypes were only 
available from Exam 1 and were extracted from the JHS Vanguard Center package for Exam 
1 (53). Sex, age, and date of examination for each subject were derived from data recorded 
during clinical examinations. RCFs for diseases corresponding with the ACMG genes were 
ascertained and tabulated without knowledge of the genetic data. For cancer, an aggregated 
FHS cancer database, with subject diagnoses confirmed from pathology reports and clinical 
notes, was queried (64, 65), whereas cancer diagnoses in JHS were extracted from Exam 1

 participant surveys. For both data sets, any history of cancer was recorded regardless of the 
age of onset of the cancer. For cardiovascular diseases, the most recent lipid levels, 
echocardiography, and electrocardiogram data were recorded and categorized according to 
prespecified criteria (Table 1). In both FHS and JHS, phenotypic data sets were highly 
complete with less than 4% of participants having missing data for any phenotypic variable.
Statistical analyses
We calculated the expected number of RCFs among those with PVs as Σiniπi, where ni is the 
number of individuals with a PV in class i (cancer, hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy, 
arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy, and dyslipidemia), and πi is the 
fraction of individuals without PVs exhibiting an RCF in class i. In the FHS cohort, we 
selected individuals with breast, ovarian, prostate, and gastrointestinal cancer, whereas in the 
JHS, cancer subtypes were not available, so we used any history of cancer. We estimated 
statistical significance through simulation: We sampled a binomial random variable with size 
ni and probability πi for each class i and summed these five random variables (generating a 
mixture of binomials). We generated 100,000 replicates of this simulated RCF count and 
estimated the (one-sided) P value as the proportion of replicates where the simulated count 
was equal to, or exceeded, the observed count. Second, we repeated this procedure for 
cancer and cardiovascular PVs. We also calculated SIR as the ratio of the observed RCF 
count to the expected count (66). All statistical analyses were performed with R (version 
3.0.2).

Individuals with PVs and LPVs in the JHS
CRC, colorectal carcinoma; MH, malignant hyperthermia; HPP, hypokalemic periodic paralysis; FDB, familial dysbetalipoproteinemia; HNPCC, 
hereditary nonpolyposis CRC; LQTS, long QT syndrome; IVS, interventricular septum; PWT, left ventricular posterior wall thickness; LFS, Li-Fraumeni 
syndrome; LVIDd, left ventricular internal diastolic diameter; NA, not analyzed, that is, individual was not included in the analysis because the expected 
phenotype was either unavailable (see Materials and Methods) or missing for the given individual.
