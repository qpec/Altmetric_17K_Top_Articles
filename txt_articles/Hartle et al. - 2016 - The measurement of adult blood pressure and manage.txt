Summary
This guideline aims to ensure that patients admitted to hospital for elective surgery are known to have blood pressures
below 160 mmHg systolic and 100 mmHg diastolic in primary care. The objective for primary care is to fulfil this crite-
rion before referral to secondary care for elective surgery. The objective for secondary care is to avoid spurious hyperten-
sive measurements. Secondary care should not attempt to diagnose hypertension in patients who are normotensive in
primary care. Patients who present to pre-operative assessment clinics without documented primary care blood pres-
sures should proceed to elective surgery if clinic blood pressures are below 180 mmHg systolic and 110 mmHg diastolic.

 Recommendations
•
General practitioners should refer patients for elec-
tive surgery with mean blood pressures in primary
care in the past 12 months less than 160 mmHg
systolic and less than 100 mmHg diastolic.
•
Secondary care should accept referrals that docu-
ment blood pressures below 160 mmHg systolic and
below 100 mmHg diastolic in the past 12 months.
•
Pre-operative assessment clinics need not measure
the blood pressure of patients being prepared for
elective surgery whose systolic and diastolic blood
pressures are documented below 160/100 mmHg in
the referral letter from primary care.
•
General
practitioners
should
refer
hypertensive
patients for elective surgery after the blood pressure
readings are less than 160 mmHg systolic and less
than 100 mmHg diastolic. Patients may be referred
for elective surgery if they remain hypertensive
despite optimal antihypertensive treatment or if
they decline antihypertensive treatment.
•
Surgeons should ask general practitioners to supply
primary care blood pressure readings from the last
12 months if they are undocumented in the referral
letter.
•
Pre-operative assessment staff should measure the
blood pressure of patients who attend clinic with-
out
evidence
of
blood
pressures
less
than
160 mmHg systolic and 100 mmHg diastolic being
documented by primary care in the preceding
12 months. (We detail the recommended method
for measuring non-invasive blood pressure accu-
rately, although the diagnosis of hypertension is
made in primary care.)
•
Elective surgery should proceed for patients who
attend the pre-operative assessment clinic without
documentation of normotension in primary care if
their blood pressure is less than 180 mmHg systolic
and 110 mmHg diastolic when measured in clinic.
The disparity between the blood pressure thresh-
olds for primary care (160/100 mmHg) and secondary
care (180/110 mmHg) allows for a number of factors.
Blood pressure reduction in primary care is based on
good evidence that the rates of cardiovascular morbid-
ity, in particular stroke, are reduced over years and
decades. There is no evidence that peri-operative blood
pressure reduction affects rates of cardiovascular events
beyond that expected in a month in primary care.
Blood pressure measurements might be more accurate
in primary care than secondary care, due to a less
stressful environment and a more practised technique.
What other guideline statements are available on
this topic?
There is detailed evidence-based guidance on the diag-
nosis and treatment of hypertension in the community
from, for example, the National Institute for Health
and Care Excellence [1]. There is little guidance on a
‘safe’ blood pressure for planned anaesthesia and sur-
gery.
Why was this guideline developed?
There is no national guideline for the measurement,
diagnosis or management of raised blood pressure
before planned surgery. There is little evidence that
raised pre-operative blood pressure affects postopera-
tive outcomes. Local guidelines vary from area to area.
Hypertension is a common reason to cancel or post-
pone surgery. In our sprint audit, 1–3% of elective
patients had
further
investigations precipitated
by
blood pressure measurement, of whom half had their
surgery postponed. Across the UK this would equate
to ~100 concerned and inconvenienced patients each
day, with associated costs to the NHS and the national
economy [2, 3].
This guideline is the first collaboration between
the AAGBI and the British Hypertension Society; these
two organisations have very different perspectives.
Members of the British Hypertension Society are con-
cerned with the long-term reduction in rates of cardio-
vascular disease, particularly strokes. Anaesthetists are
more focused on immediate complications, in the peri-
operative period. This guideline aims to prevent the
diagnosis
of
hypertension
being
the
reason
that
planned surgery is cancelled or delayed. As such, it
should also be of interest to hospital managers and
commissioners of hospital care.
How does this statement differ from existing
guidelines?
This guideline serves, therefore, not to advise on treat-
ment of hypertension, but rather to produce a com-

 mon terminology in diagnosis and referral, explaining
the impact of anaesthesia on blood pressure and vice
versa to the wider, non-anaesthetic community. At the
same time, it will review current best practice on the
measurement, diagnosis and treatment of hyperten-
sion.
Why does this statement differ from existing
guidelines?
Pre-operative
blood pressure
management involves
many specialties and professions: primary care, general
medicine,
cardiology,
endocrinology,
pre-operative
assessment clinics and, of course, both anaesthetists
and surgeons. This list is not exhaustive. This guideline
should be a useful summary for all those clinicians
and for patients. The guidance takes into account not
just the best clinical evidence, but the particular pat-
tern of referral for treatment within the NHS in all
four countries of the UK.
Introduction
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
(NICE) has described hypertension as ‘one of the most
important preventable causes of premature morbidity
and mortality in the UK’ [1]. The Association of
Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI),
together with the British Hypertension Society, felt
there was a need for a nationally agreed policy state-
ment on how to deal with raised blood pressure in the
pre-operative period. We have based this statement on
a consensus view with the backing of graded evidence,
where such evidence is available.
Hypertension is almost always asymptomatic and
it is diagnosed following screening in general practice.
Managing hypertension pre-operatively is a complex
matter of balancing the risks of anaesthesia, treatment
and delay for the individual patient. Most cases of
hypertension are primary, i.e. with no other medical
cause. For the remainder, the cause for hypertension
may be associated with the reason for the proposed
operation.
Cancellations and postponements of planned sur-
gical procedures have been a major and long-standing
problem for healthcare worldwide. The quantifiable
loss of resource is pitted against unquantifiable and
significant psychological, social and financial implica-
tions of postponement for patients and their families.
Although guidelines exist for the treatment of ele-
vated blood pressure, there remains a paucity of liter-
ature and accepted guidelines for the peri-operative
evaluation and care of the patient with hypertension
who undergoes non-cardiac surgery [4]. Of particular
importance is defining the patients most vulnerable
to complications and the indications for immediate
and rapid antihypertensive treatment and/or post-
ponement of surgery to reduce these risks pre-opera-
tively,
intra-operatively
and
postoperatively.
Peri-
operative hypertension often occurs in conjunction
with sympathetic nociceptive stimulation during the
induction of anaesthesia, during surgery and with
acute pain in the early postoperative period. Hyper-
tension may also accompany hypothermia, hypoxia or
intravascular volume overload from excessive intra-
operative fluid therapy, particularly in the ensuing
24–48 h as fluid is mobilised from the extravascular
space [4–6].
There are no nationally agreed guidelines for the
diagnosis or management of raised blood pressure
before elective surgery. The evidence regarding the
effect of raised pre-operative blood pressure is very
limited. Local guidelines do exist but vary from area to
area. Both the AAGBI and the British Hypertension
Society recognised the need for a national guideline
and consensus statement to address the various issues
of concern. We have limited our deliberations to a
specific scope. Only the period before planned surgery
is covered. Blood pressures which may cause an imme-
diate risk to health are specified, rather than those that
may cause risk over the long-term. The best method of
taking accurate blood pressure measurements is exam-
ined. We considered how long blood pressure should
be controlled before surgery is undertaken. Communi-
cation between different hospital departments, primary
care and the patient are of importance. We hope that
by providing national guidance the chances of a
patient receiving conflicting advice will be minimised.
Scope
This
guideline
is
aimed
at
adults
presenting for
planned surgery. The following groups of patients are
specifically not studied, although many of the general
points covered in the guideline may apply.

Management of hypertension before elective surgery guidelines
 Emergency/urgent surgery
By definition, these patients have no or very limited
time for investigation, treatment or postponement.
Such surgery must almost always proceed, but all those
involved, including the patient, must be aware of any
associated increased risk.
Obstetrics
Most cases of hypertension in pregnancy will be
directly related to the pregnancy (although with an
ageing obstetric population with higher rates of obe-
sity, this may be less so). The monitoring and treat-
ment of blood pressure is a specific and integral part
of obstetric care, regardless of the need for surgery,
and even for ‘elective’ Caesarean section there may be
very limited opportunity for delay.
Paediatrics
Childhood hypertension is relatively uncommon, and
its
epidemiology
and
natural
history
is
relatively
unclear and there are no definitive trials on screening.
Thus, its diagnosis and management, including pre-
operatively, is a specialist area beyond the scope of the
general guidance in this publication.
Cardiac surgery
Peri-operative
hypertension
commonly
complicates
surgery for congenital and acquired cardiac disease.
Management will be affected by many other factors
including the planned procedure, the use or not of car-
diopulmonary bypass and the other indications for
vaso- and cardio-active medication. We have thus con-
sidered it to be a specialist area beyond the scope of
the general guidance in this publication.
Surgery for blood pressure management
This includes surgery for phaeochromocytoma and
bariatric surgery; we have excluded this from our guid-
ance for similar reasons to that of cardiac surgery.
Methods
We formed a Working Party consisting of four mem-
bers from each society who were academics and clini-
cians
with
varied
interests,
including
vascular
anaesthesia, cardiology, elderly care medicine and gen-
eral practice. We agreed on the scope of the guideline,
and then carried out a systematic review with the qual-
ity of evidence described using the Grading of Recom-
mendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) approach [7, 8]. The GRADE approach con-
siders the quality of a body of evidence as high, mod-
erate, low or very low. To achieve a full consensus
document was important. Therefore, we consulted 20
general practitioners, including those with a specialist
interest in cardiovascular medicine, as well as senior
academics. A consultation guideline was then made
available to members of both societies for comment.
We specifically asked for and received comments from
the patient group, Blood Pressure UK. The comments
and responses have been made available online. The
Council and Executive of the respective societies were
given the task of final approval.
Blood pressure, hypertension and
anaesthesia
The anaesthetist has two broad considerations in the
hypertensive patient who presents for surgery. One is
to be cognisant of the effect of chronic hypertension
on the individual’s peri-operative and long-term car-
diovascular risk. The other is to consider whether the
blood pressure measured in the primary care setting is
associated with adverse peri-operative events and to
decide whether this should be reduced before surgery.
The association between hypertension and peri-
operative harm was first reported in the 1950s [9, 10].
Systolic blood pressures in excess of 170 mmHg and
diastolic blood pressures in excess of 110 mmHg were
associated
with
complications
such
as
myocardial
ischaemia [11]. Hypertension was the second-most
common factor associated with postoperative morbid-
ity [12]. In 2003, Weksler et al. published a ‘quasi’-
randomised controlled study of 989 treated hyperten-
sive
patients
who
had
diastolic
blood
pressures
between 110 and 130 mmHg measured in the anaes-
thetic room [13]. In one group, surgery proceeded
after intranasal nifedipine, and in the other group, sur-
gery was delayed while further antihypertensive treat-
ment was pursued in hospital. During the first three
postoperative days, the rates of neurological and car-
diovascular complications were similar. One might
conclude that there was no difference in an infrequent
outcome, or that the study had insufficient power to

 detect a small difference (see section below, treatment
for hypertension: extension of evidence from the com-
munity to the peri-operative period).
The association of hypertension with cardiovascu-
lar disease is established, but there is no clear evidence
that patients with stage 1 or 2 hypertension (Table 1)
without
evidence
of
target
organ
damage
have
increased
peri-operative
cardiovascular
risk
[14].
Patients with stage 3 or 4 hypertension, who are more
likely to have target organ damage, have not been sub-
jected to rigorous randomised controlled trials of peri-
operative interventions. There is evidence that hyper-
tension with target organ damage is associated with a
small
increased
incidence
of
peri-operative
major
adverse cardiovascular events [4]. It is not known
whether or not reducing blood pressure in these
patients during a postponement of planned surgery
would reduce this rate of events; there is sparse evi-
dence to guide a decision. Any decision should take
into account factors other than blood pressure, namely:
age; comorbidity; functional capacity (i.e. functional
status and reserve); and the urgency and indication for
surgery (see section below, ‘The treatment of cardio-
vascular risk, not hypertension’). The latest guidelines
published by the National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE), in conjunction with the Bri-
tish Hypertension Society, recognise the importance of
target organ damage in the management of hyperten-
sion by targeting a lower threshold for further medical
intervention [1]. Whether or not these thresholds and
targets should be rigorously applied in the peri-opera-
tive setting is not clear.
Patients with hypertension (controlled or uncon-
trolled) demonstrate a more labile haemodynamic pro-
file than their non-hypertensive counterparts [5]. The
induction of anaesthesia and airway instrumentation
can lead to a pronounced increase in sympathetic acti-
vation, which may lead to a significant increase in
blood pressure and heart rate. A reduction in systemic
vascular resistance soon after the induction of anaes-
thesia commonly leads to varying degrees of hypoten-
sion. Reduction in vascular resistance is multifactorial
and may be secondary to loss of the baroreceptor
reflex control, central neuraxial blockade, and direct
effects of anaesthetic agents. The effect on vascular
tone will be exaggerated by ‘deep’ or excessive anaes-
thesia and in patients who are fluid-depleted. This,
and the often exaggerated haemodynamic response to
surgery, pain and emergence from anaesthesia, have
also been described as being more common in the
hypertensive population [6]. Some researchers have
demonstrated an association between pre-operative
hypertension
and
relatively
minor
physiological
derangements
such
as
intra-operative
hypotension,
hypertension and arrhythmia, but studies have not
conclusively demonstrated that fluctuations in haemo-
dynamic variables cause clinically significant harm
[15]. Larger studies to investigate differences between
untreated hypertensive patients and those treated (suc-
cessfully and unsuccessfully) have not demonstrated
increased rates of peri-operative cardiovascular events.
However, these findings may not be applicable to cur-
rent practice, as many of these studies were conducted
in the late 1970s [16].
This appreciation of labile haemodynamics in
hypertensive patients has led to a number of anaes-
thetic techniques designed to achieve a more stable
haemodynamic profile during surgery. These tech-
niques include co-induction, invasive arterial monitor-
ing with titrated or prophylactic vasopressor therapy,
depth-of-anaesthesia monitoring, beta-blockers and the
optimisation of stroke volume with intravascular fluid
therapy. The omission of antihypertensive drugs, such
as
angiotensin-converting
enzyme
inhibitors
and
receptor
blockers,
combined
with
the
careful
re-
introduction of these drugs after surgery, is common-
place and appears to be associated with fewer signifi-
cant peri-operative haemodynamic fluctuations [17].
The introduction of peri-operative beta-blockade for
high cardiac-risk patients increases postoperative mor-
tality, secondary to hypotension and stroke, albeit with
less cardiac injury, as demonstrated in the POISE-1
study [18]. The anaesthetist should be aware that sud-
den withdrawal of certain antihypertensive agents such

Management of hypertension before elective surgery guidelines
 as clonidine, alpha-methyldopa and beta-blockers can
be associated with adverse events. Withdrawal of
beta-blockers may also be associated with myocardial
ischaemia that is often silent in the peri-operative per-
iod and easily missed without continuous ECG moni-
toring and serial serum troponin measurements.
Best practice: the measurement of
blood pressure
Blood pressure should be measured in primary care
before non-urgent surgical referral (Fig. 1). Surgical
outpatients should arrange for primary care to sup-
ply blood pressure readings if these have not been
documented in the referral letter. Blood pressure
should
be
measured
by
pre-operative
assessment
clinics in patients who attend the clinic without doc-
umented
blood
pressure
readings
from
the
last
12 months.
The
measurement
should
follow
the
principles mandated for primary care (see below)
[1]. Blood pressures less than 180 mmHg systolic
and 110 mmHg diastolic in secondary care should
not preclude elective surgery, although the patient

 should be asked to attend their general practice for
the
concurrent
determination
of
whether
primary
care hypertension is present.
The setting in which blood pressure is measured
should be relaxed and temperate in a standardised
environment with current calibrated equipment. The
seated patient should have their supported arm out-
stretched for at least one minute before the initial
reading.
The
pulse
rate
and
rhythm
should
be
recorded before the blood pressure is measured by a
validated
device.
Automated
sphygmomanometers
(www.bhsoc.org/bp-monitors) are inaccurate when the
pulse is irregular, when the blood pressure should be
measured by auscultation over the brachial artery dur-
ing manual deflation of an arm cuff.
Blood pressure should be measured in both arms
in patients scheduled for vascular or renal surgery. If
the difference between arms in systolic pressure is
greater than 20 mmHg, repeat the measurements; sub-
sequently, measure from the arm with the higher
blood pressure.
The patient is normotensive if the blood pressure
measurement is less than 140/90 mmHg. If the first
measurement
is
equal
to
or
higher
than
140/
90 mmHg, the blood pressure should be measured
twice more, with each reading at least one minute
apart. The lower of the last two readings is recorded as
the blood pressure; if it is less than 140/90 mmHg the
patient is normotensive.
If the reading is between 140/90 mmHg and 179/
109 mmHg, the patient may have stage 1 or 2 hyper-
tension. In primary care, the patient would be offered
ambulatory (ABPM) or home blood pressure monitor-
ing (HBPM) to establish their true blood pressure
(GRADE 1B). If the reading is equal to or higher than
180/110 mmHg in primary care, the patient may have
severe hypertension and would be considered for
immediate treatment.
Best practice: the diagnosis of
hypertension
General practitioners should establish whether blood
pressure has been measured and managed in all adults
before non-urgent surgical referrals. A blood pressure
measurement taken within the preceding 12 months
should be detailed in the referral letter.
The
diagnosis
of
hypertension
in
patients
referred for investigation of surgical disease that are
not treated for hypertension and who have not had
a
blood
pressure
measurement
in
the
preceding
12 months follows the same process as any other
primary care patient. We recommend that the prac-
tice instigates ambulatory or home blood pressure
measurements before non-urgent referrals if the stan-
dard blood pressure is equal to or greater than 160/
100 mmHg.
If
the
patient’s
ABPM/HBPM
blood
pressure is equal to or greater than 150/95 mmHg
(or equal to or greater than 135/85 mmHg with tar-
get organ damage), the patient is diagnosed as hav-
ing hypertension; treatment should be discussed and
commenced using the NICE/BHS CG127 algorithm
[19]. This process can take place at the same time
as urgent surgical referral, but a reduction in blood
pressure to less than 160/100 mmHg should precede
non-urgent
surgical
referral.
The
referral
letter
should document that an informed discussion has
taken place with patients who decline treatment, or
detail that all appropriate attempts have been made
to reduce blood pressure for patients with persistent
hypertension, which might have included specialist
investigations.
Surgical outpatients should request that general
practitioners forward primary care blood pressure
measurements if these have not been documented in
the referral letter. Pre-operative assessment clinics
should measure the blood pressures of patients who
present without documentation of primary care blood
pressures.
If
the
blood
pressure
is
raised
above
180 mmHg systolic or 110 mmHg diastolic, the patient
should return to their general practice for primary care
assessment and management of their blood pressure,
as detailed above (Fig. 2). If the blood pressure is
above 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic, but
below 180 mmHg systolic and below 110 mmHg dias-
tolic, the GP should be informed, but elective surgery
should not be postponed.

mary care following the diagnosis of hypertension.

 of hypertension with one or more of the following:
diuretics (thiazide, chlorthalidone and indapamide);
beta-blockers; calcium channel-blockers (CCB); angio-
tensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or an
angiotensin-2
receptor
blocker
(ARB)
[1].
In
the
future, the threshold for treating high blood pressure
might change to cardiovascular risk (see below, the
treatment of cardiovascular risk, not hypertension).
Step 1 treatment
Patients aged less than 55 years should be offered an
ACE inhibitor, or a low-cost ARB. If an ACE inhi-
bitor is prescribed but is not tolerated (for example,
because of cough), offer a low-cost ARB. Angioten-
sin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs are not
recommended in women of childbearing potential.
An ACE inhibitor should not be combined with
an ARB.
Patients aged over 55 years and Black patients of
African or Caribbean family origin of any age should
be offered a CCB. If a CCB is not suitable, for example
because of oedema or intolerance, or if there is evi-
dence of heart failure or a high risk of heart failure, a
thiazide-like diuretic should be offered.
If diuretic treatment is to be initiated or changed,
offer a thiazide-like diuretic, such as chlorthalidone
(12.5–25.0 mg once daily), or indapamide (1.5 mg
modified-release once daily or 2.5 mg once daily), in
preference to a conventional thiazide diuretic such as
bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide.

 and whose blood pressure is stable and well con-
trolled, treatment with the bendroflumethiazide or
hydrochlorothiazide should be continued.
Beta-blockers are not a preferred initial therapy
for
hypertension.
However,
beta-blockers
may
be
considered
in
younger
patients,
particularly
those
with an intolerance or contraindication to ACE inhi-
bitors and ARBs, or women of childbearing potential
or patients with evidence of increased sympathetic
drive. If beta-blockers are started and a second drug
is required, add a CCB rather than a thiazide-like
diuretic to reduce the person’s risk of developing
diabetes.
Step 2 treatment
If blood pressure is not controlled by Step 1 treatment,
use a CCB in combination with either an ACE inhibi-
tor or an ARB.
If a CCB is not suitable for Step 2 treatment, for
example because of oedema or intolerance, or if there
is evidence of heart failure or a high risk of heart fail-
ure, offer a thiazide-like diuretic.
For Black patients of African or Caribbean family
origin, consider an ARB in preference to an ACE inhi-
bitor, in combination with a CCB.
Step 3 treatment
Before considering Step 3 treatment, check that drugs
from Step 2 have been prescribed at optimal doses, or
at the maximum tolerated doses. If treatment with
three drugs is required, the combination of ACE inhi-
bitor or ARB, CCB and thiazide-like diuretic should be
used.
Step 4 treatment
If resistant blood pressure exceeds 140/90 mmHg in
clinic after treatment with the optimal or highest-toler-
ated doses of an ACE inhibitor, or an ARB plus a
CCB, with a diuretic; adding a fourth antihypertensive
drug and expert advice should be considered.
Further diuretic therapy with low-dose spironolac-
tone (25 mg once daily) should be considered if the
serum potassium concentration < 4.6 mmol.l�1. Cau-
tion is required in patients with reduced estimated
glomerular filtration rates because of an increased risk
of hyperkalaemia. Increasing the dose of thiazide-like
diuretics should be considered if the serum potassium
concentration > 4.5 mmol.l�1.
Serum sodium and potassium concentrations and
renal function should be checked within 1 month of
increasing diuretic dose, and repeated as required
thereafter. If further diuretic therapy for resistant
hypertension at Step 4 is not tolerated, or is con-
traindicated or ineffective, consider an alpha-blocker
or beta-blocker. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled
with the optimal or maximum tolerated doses of four
drugs, expert advice should be sought if it has not yet
been obtained.
As recently as 2008, the HYVET study demon-
strated the clinical benefits of treating hypertension in
people aged ≥ 80 years, while health economic analysis
has confirmed the cost effectiveness of this strategy [1,
20]. As a result, NICE now recommends that patients
aged ≥ 80 years should be offered treatment only if
they have stage 2 hypertension. The 2011 Hyperten-
sion Guideline also recommends that the decision to
treat should be based on standing blood pressure, and
should take into account the presence of co-morbid-
ities such as dementia. The guideline also makes a dis-
tinction between initiating treatment in the over-80s
and continuing long-term and well-tolerated treatment
when patients reach this age. In other words, patients
who were started on treatment when younger should
not have their current therapy back-titrated when they
celebrate their 80th birthday.
The treatment of cardiovascular risk,
not hypertension
It is likely that treatment for hypertension will no
longer be based upon blood pressure [21]. This is a
surprising statement; the diagnosis of hypertension
that merits treatment has – until recently – been based
on patients’ blood pressure, irrespective of other car-
diovascular risk factors, despite the NICE guidance
recognising their importance [1]. This practice con-
flicts with the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia,
which is not based on the cholesterol concentration
alone, but instead on the composite 5- or 10-year risk
of: stroke; myocardial infarction; heart failure; cardio-
vascular morbidity; or death, ascribed to these diag-
noses. The magnitude by which cardiovascular disease
is reduced by treatment for both hypercholesterolaemia

Management of hypertension before elective surgery guidelines
 and hypertension is dependent on the composite car-
diovascular risk, not the concentration of cholesterol
or the blood pressure. Anaesthetists should gauge their
concern for a hypertensive patient by the calculated
five-year rate of cardiovascular events, not by the
blood pressure measurement per se.
Hypertension is common; this is responsible for
the well-publicised reduction in population rates of
stroke by antihypertensive treatment. The absolute
effect of treatment for the individual, even over a five-
year period, is smaller than many anaesthetists might
realise. Table 2 presents the effect of five-year antihy-
pertensive treatment for cardiovascular risk in a popu-
lation
quartered
by
the
five-year
rate
of
any
cardiovascular event. Planned major surgery temporar-
ily increases mortality. For instance, planned open
repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm increases mortal-
ity in the first postoperative month ten times, whereas
endovascular repair increases mortality four times. If
cardiovascular events are similarly increased by major
planned surgery, one would anticipate that the pre-
operative antihypertensive treatment of cardiovascular
risk would have a proportionately greater absolute
effect on the rates of events while their risk remains
elevated. Table 3 illustrates the absolute effect of estab-
lished antihypertensive treatment in the month follow-
ing a planned operation in patients from Table 2,
assuming two scenarios: that the operation does not
affect the rates of cardiovascular events; and that the
operation increases the rates of cardiovascular events
six times.
This guideline has outlined that blood pressure
before planned non-urgent surgery is measured in pri-
mary care, where the diagnosis of hypertension is

 made, and treatment is managed. The lifelong risk of
mortality and morbidity may be unaffected by post-
poning surgery for the assessment of cardiovascular
risk by primary care and possible antihypertensive
treatment [22]. For instance, clinicians might like to
consider the uncertainty in how long it takes for car-
diovascular risk to fall with antihypertensive medica-
tion (as opposed to how long it takes for blood
pressure to fall), and the 1% relative increase in car-
diovascular risk that accompanies each postponed
month, due to the patient ageing. Clinicians might also
consider that patients who smoke or who have hyperc-
holesterolaemia are not subjected to the summary can-
cellations
justified
by
blood
pressure
readings.
A
further consideration is the absence of a scale of
enthusiasm for postponing surgery that matches the
continuum of cardiovascular risk, which would result
in older smoking hypercholesterolaemic normotensive
men having surgery postponed more frequently than
younger hypertensive women who do not have any
other cardiovascular risk factors.
Communication
Pre-operative assessment clinics should inform general
practitioners when they measure raised blood pressures
in patients who have not had readings taken in pri-
mary care in the preceding 12 months. The letter
should request that the general practitioner determine
whether the patient has hypertension in primary care.
The letter should also state whether or not surgery will
proceed without a diagnosis of hypertension being
made or treatment commenced.
Appendix 1 is an example of a letter explaining
that surgery will not proceed until the diagnosis of
hypertension has been excluded or confirmed, and in
the latter case treated with the patient’s consent. It is
important that the patient has a copy and is instructed
to make an appointment at their surgery with a nurse
or a doctor and to take the letter with them. The lan-
guage
used
should
seek
cooperative
management
rather than demand action. In the first instance, the
GP will need to establish that the blood pressure is
high and this is not a white coat effect. It must be
clearly stated how to re-establish the procedural path-
way when the blood pressure has been shown to be
satisfactory, treated or not.

Example of letter to general practitioner from pre-assessment clinic following measurement of raised blood pres-
sure in patients who have not had readings taken in primary care in the preceding 12 months.
Dear Doctor
Unfortunately, the procedure for Mr/Ms . . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. has been postponed because their blood pressure was
found to be 182/114 in their pre-operative assessment. It was measured several times following the AAGBI/BHS guide-
lines. The guidelines suggest a blood pressure level higher than 180/110 is unsuitable for elective anaesthesia.
We have asked the patient to make an appointment at their surgery for further assessment of their blood pressure. We
would be grateful if you could verify that this is the true blood pressure level and not a white coat effect and treat appro-
priately if the patient has hypertension.
We will be pleased to accept the patient back for surgery if their clinical blood pressure is below 160/100. Please
ask the patient to contact . . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . . and inform us of their current blood pressure and what medica-
tion, if any, was required to achieve this.
Many thanks in anticipation of your help with this matter
