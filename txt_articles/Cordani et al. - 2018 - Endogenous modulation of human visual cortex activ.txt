Perception, particularly in the visual domain, is drastically influenced by rhythmic changes in
ambient lighting conditions. Anticipation of daylight changes by the circadian system is
critical for survival. However, the neural bases of time-of-day-dependent modulation in
human perception are not yet understood. We used fMRI to study brain dynamics during
resting-state and close-to-threshold visual perception repeatedly at six times of the day. Here
we report that resting-state signal variance drops endogenously at times coinciding with
dawn and dusk, notably in sensory cortices only. In parallel, perception-related signal variance
in visual cortices decreases and correlates negatively with detection performance, identifying
an anticipatory mechanism that compensates for the deteriorated visual signal quality at
dawn and dusk. Generally, our findings imply that decreases in spontaneous neural activity
improve close-to-threshold perception.

 T
he day-night cycle leads to rhythmic changes in environ-
mental conditions, particularly of ambient light. The cir-
cadian timing system anticipates such time of day (ToD)-
dependent environmental rhythms and modulates physiology
accordingly1–3. Animal models revealed ToD-dependent changes
in genome readout, protein dynamics, and in electrophysiology
that are regulated by the circadian system3–5 and homeostatic
factors6. However, the neural bases of ToD-dependent changes in
perception and cognition in humans are unclear7,8.
Perception can easily be studied in humans. An appropriate
method to investigate the neural signatures of cognitive processes
is the measurement of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)
signal by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). fMRI
during tasks can reveal brain activity associated with cognition,
while fMRI during wakeful rest identifies more directly endo-
genous processes9. ToD modulates task-related BOLD-fMRI
activity10,11 but more importantly also functional connectivity in
resting-state networks12,13, suggesting that ToD modulates neural
networks both during tasks but also independently of a cognitive
task or sensory stimulation. Yet, the relationship between such
network dynamics and ToD-dependent modulations of percep-
tion and behavior has not yet been shown. This lack of knowledge
is surprising, because ToD dramatically influences the quality of
the sensory input signals to the brain. Understanding the way
ToD affects cortical dynamics may grant insights in how the brain
deals with predictable challenges.
We investigated the ToD-dependency of BOLD signal var-
iance – a quantification of the BOLD signal amplitude over
time – as it provides important information about the relation-
ship between brain activity and behavior14,15. BOLD signal var-
iance was first analyzed during resting-state to detect endogenous
ToD-dependent modulation of brain activity. In a second step, we
investigated the consequences of such an endogenous modulation
of cortical activity on visual perception. Our results reveal that
BOLD signal variance drops endogenously at twilight compared
to midday in sensory cortices while close-to-threshold visual
perception improves in parallel. This identifies reductions in
spontaneous sensory cortex activity as an anticipatory mechanism
to compensate for the low sensory signal quality at twilight.
Results
Time-of-day-effect in resting-state BOLD signal variance.
Fourteen healthy male participants were scanned using fMRI at
six different ToD on two subsequent days (08:00, 11:00, 14:00,
17:00, 20:00, 23:00 h on each day). This was done to account for
habituation effects to the experimental setting. Each scanning
session included a resting-state measurement in constant dim
light (< 0.1 lux). Voxel-wise BOLD variance was defined in each
individual by the resting-state BOLD signal standard deviation
(SD) at each ToD. A whole-brain, repeated measures ANOVA
(cluster-extent based threshold: k = 395, P < 0.05, family-wise
error (FWE) corrected; cluster-defining primary threshold of F(5,
65) > 4.70, P < 0.001, uncorrected; n = 14) revealed main effects
of ToD on BOLD variance only in sensory cortices, namely, the
bilateral visual (P = 0.001), somatosensory (three clusters, all P =
0.001), and right auditory cortex (P = 0.007, Fig. 1a and Table 1).
Post-hoc two-tailed dependent t-tests with Bonferroni correc-
tion (significance threshold at P < 0.05, n = 14) based on BOLD
SD averages within each cluster and calculated separately for each
ToD showed that this effect was driven by significant BOLD SD
reductions at both 08:00 and 20:00 h compared to midday
measurements 11:00, 14:00, and 17:00 h (Fig. 1b and Table 2 for
statistical details). Reductions ranged from 17.9 to 25.8% of
BOLD SD values at 14:00 h. As functional connectivity analyses
have identified the meaningful part of resting-state BOLD activity
in a low frequency band around 0.01–0.1 Hz16,17, we replicated
the BOLD SD results in the frequency domain by calculating the
amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (Supplementary Fig. 1,
Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). BOLD SD decreases in sensory
cortices at 08:00 h and 20:00 h temporally coincided with local
times of civil twilight, as the 08:00 h scan was close to or matched
sunrise (end of civil morning twilight, range = 05:16–08:24 h),
while the 20:00 h scan was close to or matched sunset (start of
civil evening twilight, range 16:24–21:39 h). This suggests a
particular role of the visual compared to the other sensory
cortices in ToD-dependent modulation of brain activity. Note
that the light conditions in the scanner were identical at each ToD
and participants adapted to the dim light before measurement.
Potential masking factors. A range of masking factors could
have potentially influenced our observation. Yet, the main effect
of ToD on BOLD SD in the visual cortex remained significant
after accounting for potential confounders, including heart rate,
breathing rate, body temperature, subjective sleepiness, and the
amplitude and variance of head motion parameters, as well as the
number of outliers in head motion parameters in a linear mixed
model (main effect of ToD F(5, 34.029) = 4.177, P = 0.005, type
III F-test, n = 14). This model also included chronotype, sleep
pressure, sleep debt, and scanning days to investigate effects of
interindividual differences (see section Circadian and homeostatic
factors) and habituation on resting-state BOLD SD. The repetitive
measurements on two subsequent scanning days did not intro-
duce habituation effects, because ToD remained significant when
accounting for scanning days in the model and there was no
significant interaction between ToD and scanning day (F(5,
41.829) = 0.871, P = 0.509, type III F-test, n = 14).
Vigilance. Because the main effect of ToD in BOLD SD remained
significant when adjusting for subjective sleepiness, it is likely that
the ToD-dependent modulation is not explained by vigilance
states. We additionally investigated whether an objective marker
of EEG-documented vigilance changes18,19 showed comparable
ToD-effects. We tested the main effect of ToD in resting-state
thalamo-cortical connectivity using correlation maps of thalamic
BOLD time series with all other brain voxels. This parameter was
not affected by ToD (whole-brain repeated measures ANOVA,
cluster size k = 3, P > 0.999, FWE cluster correction, n = 14)
suggesting that both subjective and objective measures of vigi-
lance states do not explain the diurnal modulation in resting-state
BOLD SD in the sensory cortices. To ascertain that this negative
finding did not result from insufficient statistical power, we
performed a bootstrap analysis using a published dataset in which
vigilance changes have been investigated18, testing whether a
group size of 14, as used in the present study, is sufficient to
detect vigilance changes. Indeed, vigilance-related changes in
thalamo-cortical connectivity can reliably (1–ß = 0.8) be detected
in sample sizes as the one used in this study.
Circadian and homeostatic factors. The lack of an association
with vigilance state rather suggests an endogenous modulation of
resting state cortical activity by circadian and/or homeostatic
factors. When we examined the region of the suprachiasmatic
nucleus in the hypothalamus20, which is the central pacemaker of
the circadian system in the brain, we did not observe a mod-
ulation of resting-state BOLD variance as a function of ToD
(repeated measures ANOVA, all voxels F(5, 65) < 4.25 and P ≥
0.09, small volume corrected, n = 14). Still, it remains possible
that the ToD effects in BOLD SD in sensory cortices are regulated
by the circadian system, because the suprachiasmatic nucleus
codes time at each ToD in the magnitude of firing rate rather than

 in firing rate variance21,22. Indeed, both, chronotype, a proxy for
circadian phase, and sleep pressure, a homeostatic factor,
explained part of the ToD modulation in BOLD variance (Sup-
plementary Fig. 2). The linear mixed model on resting-state
BOLD SD in the visual cortex showed a significant interaction
between ToD and chronotype (F(5, 34.603) = 2.738, P = 0.037,
type III F-test, n = 14) and between ToD and sleep pressure (F(5,
32.21) = 5.128, P = 0.001, type III F-test, n = 14). There was no
significant interaction between ToD and sleep debt (F(5, 38.554)
= 1.922, P = 0.113, type III F-test, n = 14).
While our study was not originally designed to dissociate the
specific contribution of circadian and homeostatic factors in the
ToD-dependent modulation of sensory cortex activity, a sleep
deprivation study in a larger sample documented interactions
between circadian and homeostatic influences and BOLD activity
during a visual psychomotor vigilance task10. In this prior study,
an interaction between homeostatic and circadian factors was
particularly observed in posterior, mostly occipital cortices, while
the circadian modulation seemed less important in the frontal
cortices. This observation suggests that the circadian system
modulates perceptual processes in the sensory cortices and could
potentially be the primary mediator of the ToD effects observed
here.
Time-of-day-effects in close-to-threshold visual perception.
Because the ToD-dependent modulation of BOLD SD represents
changes in the spontaneous neural activity during resting-state,
independent of sensory stimulation and task demands, our results
suggest a ToD-dependent endogenous regulation of cortical
activity. To reveal the relationship between such neural ToD
effects in sensory cortices and perception we examined ToD
effects on close-to-threshold visual perception, because dawn and
dusk affect the signal quality of primarily the visual input. During

 (5, 40) = 2.67, P = 0.036; partial eta-squared = 0.250, n = 9;
Fig. 1c). Participants performed best at 08:00 h (mean ± SD
omission errors = 1.17 ± 1.17) and 20:00 h (mean ± SD omission
errors = 0.56 ± 0.88) compared to midday (omission errors all ≥
2.00; Table 3). Reaction times were not significantly different
throughout the day (F(5, 40) = 2.01, P = 0.097; partial eta-
squared = 0.201, n = 9), indicating that omission errors are a
better measure for detection of brief stimuli than reaction times.
Good visual detection performance at 08:00 and 20:00 h
(Fig. 1c) occurred in parallel to low resting-state BOLD SD
(Fig. 1b), both coinciding with times of twilight (Pearson
correlations accounting for the dependence among the repeated
measures: r = 0.54, P < 0.001, n = 54). We observed a positive,
linear relationship between resting-state BOLD SD in the visual
cortex and omission errors during visual detection at the same
times of day (i.e., low resting-state BOLD SD was associated with
good visual detection, Fig. 2a). This relationship between
behavior during the visual detection task and prior task-
independent resting-state activity points towards an anticipatory
mechanism that facilitates visual perception. Yet, linking BOLD

 variance reductions to performance requires correlating not only
resting-state, but also task-related BOLD variance with visual
detection performance.
ToD-effects in BOLD signal variance during visual perception.
Therefore, we further analyzed fMRI data during the visual
detection task. We first tested whether ToD modulates task-
related BOLD SD in the visual cortex during visual detection in
the same way as it modulates visual cortex BOLD SD during rest
using a t-test (cluster-extent based threshold: k = 112, P < 0.05,
FWE corrected; cluster-defining primary threshold of t(40) > 3.31,
P < 0.001, uncorrected; n = 9). Task-related BOLD SD in two
clusters in the primary and secondary visual cortex was reduced
at 8:00 and 20:00 h, as compared to midday measurements
(Fig. 3a and b). Reductions ranged from 7.4 to 26.8% of BOLD SD
values at 14:00 h. In comparison to resting state, BOLD SD during
the visual detection task was overall decreased in both the pri-
mary and secondary visual cortex (Rest-task: t(8) = 3.82, P =
0.010, Cohen’s d = 0.99, mean difference = 1.26, n = 9) and the
secondary visual cortex (Rest-task: t(8) = 4.75, P = 0.002, Cohen’s
d = 1.30, mean difference = 1.63, n = 9); significance threshold
was at P < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected. Task-related BOLD SD in
both visual cortex clusters was also linearly and positively related to
omission errors during visual detection at the same ToD (Pearson
correlations accounting for the dependence among the repeated
measures in primary and secondary visual cortex: r = 0.43, P =
0.003, n = 54 and secondary visual cortex: r = 0.42, P = 0.004, n =
54; Fig. 2b). The similar ToD-dependent effects during, both, the
visual detection task and rest, suggest that endogenous reductions in
spontaneous cortical activity persist during active processing.
Discussion
Here we report reduced visual cortex BOLD signal variance
during close-to-threshold perception at times of twilight that
correlates with improved visual detection. Because activity is also
reduced during prior resting-state and masking factors have been
accounted for in our analyses, an endogenous source of this ToD-
dependent modulation of cortical activity is likely.
Neuromodulatory systems such as the acetylcholine-basal fore-
brain system or the norepinephrine-locus coeruleus system are
known to be under circadian influence23,24 and to modulate
homeostatic processes6. Both noradrenergic and cholinergic systems
impact neural processing in sensory cortices by increasing the signal
to noise ratio (SNR) and consequently facilitate processing of weak
incoming signals25,26. Neuromodulators could thus potentially
mediate both, the SNR enhancements and ToD-dependency of
endogenous resting-state and perception-related BOLD activity.
Although previous work has shown stimulus-induced decrea-
ses in BOLD variance when comparing task conditions to
rest15,27, our findings are novel in that they demonstrate BOLD
variance reductions, occurring even in the absence of any external
stimuli or task conditions. While endogenous fluctuations in
neural activity in sensory cortices have been associated with
subsequent visual and auditory perception28, this study reveals a
ToD-dependency of such relationship between endogenous
BOLD variance and perception. A direct facilitatory role of BOLD
variance reductions in visual perception is likely given the con-
sistent association between visual perception and variance in
visual cortex activity during both rest, and visual detection. We
propose that this anticipatory reduction of ongoing neural activity
in visual cortices at times of twilight represents a mechanism to
increase the SNR for close-to-threshold visual perception.
In addition to ToD-dependent reductions of spontaneous
neural activity in human visual cortices, we observed the same
effect in somatosensory and auditory cortices. Such a parallel
increase in SNR in these cortices may further enhance perception
in general, since multisensory interactions improve the accuracy
of sensory processing when vision alone provides insufficient
sensory evidence29,30. Indeed, an increased auditory stimulus
discrimination performance in humans has been described to
occur at early and late ToD (around 06:00 and 20:00 h)31.
From a dynamical systems perspective, BOLD variance can be
interpreted as a “wandering” of the brain around attractor
states32,33. Within this framework, our results suggest that
spontaneous exploration of internal brain states, involving sen-
sory areas, is reduced at times of twilight, which in turn could
facilitate detection of weak external stimuli. Because we did not
investigate time points after 23:00 h, we cannot determine whe-
ther the observed BOLD variance reductions occur isolated at
times of twilight or whether they also occur during later phases of
the night. In addition, we did not measure light exposure prior to
scanning and calorie intake, so that we could not examine the
relationship between these factors and BOLD SD.
Humans, a day-active species, largely rely on the visual sense
for spatial orientation. Yet, even in ancestral societies, human
activity usually extended into morning and evening times of twi-
light, when natural illuminance is drastically reduced34. An

 anticipatory increase in the SNR in the visual system during these
times, compensating for the environmental visual constraints, may
thus have been crucial for survival until the introduction of electric
light sources into social life35. Beyond this vital importance, our
findings may represent a new generic mechanism underlying
improved perception of close-to-threshold sensory input.
Methods
Participants. Fourteen healthy male volunteers were included in this study (mean
age = 23.8, range = 20–27). Four additional participants were recruited for this
study, but had to be excluded from analysis because of non-completion of the
entire study protocol or non-correctable imaging artifacts. To enable a quantifi-
cation of potential habituation effects, participants came in on two days, and were
assessed multiple times throughout the day. Because of this resource- and cost-
intense study design, sample size was limited. No participant had a history of
neuropsychiatric or vascular disease, took medication or psychoactive substances,
had recent or actual sleep disturbances, worked shifts, or consumed caffeine
excessively (>3 cups of coffee or other caffeinated beverages per day). We restricted
this study to male participants because of reported gender variations in resting-
state dynamics36 and possible interactions between the menstrual cycle and cir-
cadian rhythms37. All participants gave their informed consent and received
payment for their participation. This study has been approved by the ethics
commission of the Medical Faculty of the Goethe University Frankfurt (GZ 244/09)
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
We instructed all participants to follow regular bedtimes and wake-up-times
(between 23:00–00:00 h and 7:00–8:00 h, respectively) for five days before scanning
until completion of the experimental phase. Compliance was monitored with a
diary of activities and by continuous wrist-actigraphy recordings38. The actigraph
(Actiwatch Mini; CamNtech Ltd., Papworth Everard, UK) was worn at all times on
the non-dominant wrist except during scanning sessions. Individual differences in
the phase of entrainment – i.e., the chronotype39 – and increasing homeostatic
sleep pressure during time spent awake, but also increasing sleep debt as a marker
of sleep deprivation, are known to modulate the ToD-dependent profile of
neurobehavioral variables[7].Therefore, the participants’ individual chronotype
was assessed with the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire and characterized with a
single value, the midpoint of sleep on free days, corrected for sleep debt
accumulated during work days (MSFsc)39–41. We a priori excluded extreme
chronotypes. The mean ± SD MSFsc of the participants was 4.87 ± 0.92 (range =
3.89–6.71). The MSFsc could not be assessed in two participants due to non-
completion of the questionnaire.

 Individual wake-up time on scan days was extracted from actigraphy and used
as an indicator for sleep pressure in each participant at each ToD38,42. Since
participants were always scanned at the same times, an earlier wake-up time
indicates higher sleep pressure at each ToD compared to later wake-up times.
Mean ± SD wake-up time of the participants was 06:10 h ± 00:39 h (range =
05:00–07:10 h). Wake-up time could not be calculated in one participant, because
actigraphy could not be obtained on scan days. We estimated the participants’ sleep
debt, indexed by the difference between mean weekly sleep duration from the
Munich Chronotype Questionnaire and sleep duration during scanning days
extracted from actigraphy40–42. Because of non-completion of the questionnaire
and missing actigraphy data (see above), sleep debt could not be assessed in three
participants. Mean ± SD sleep debt of the participants was 1.81 ± 1.00 (range =
0.17–3.09). Higher values indicate higher sleep debt. Because actigraphy-based
sleep estimates often under-estimate the duration of sleep, as compared to self-
reports43, this quantification possibly overestimates the true extent of sleep
pressure in the population.
Before each fMRI session, body temperature was measured with an ear
thermometer and the participants' sleep propensity was assessed with a self-report
questionnaire based on a modified version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)
questionnaire[44], in which participants were asked to rate their sleep propensity
by projecting their actual vigilance state in the situations provided by the
questionnaire to quantify diurnal sleepiness. Participants did not nap or consume
stimulants during scanning days. Time in this paper is expressed in Central
European Time (CET), the German local time. Times of twilight were obtained
from the German Meteorological Office.
Resting-state fMRI. The participants underwent six fMRI scanning sessions at fixed
times on two subsequent days (8:00, 11:00, 14:00, 17:00, 20:00, and 23:00 h on each day)
to account for habituation effects to the experimental setting. To minimize interferences
with the participants’ sleep, no measurements were scheduled between 24:00 and 07:00
h. Each fMRI session included a 7 min resting-state measurement in dim light. The
participants were instructed to lie still and comfortably in a supine position, to keep
their eyes open and fixate a white crosshair on a black background (< 1 lux, maximum
illuminance measured at corneal level using a VOLTCRAFT LX-1108 lux meter;
Voltcraft, Hirschau, Germany), not to fall asleep, and not to think of anything in
particular and let their mind wander freely. A minimum of five minutes elapsed
between switching off the main lights in the scanning room and the beginning of the
functional measurement, allowing participants to adapt to the dim light conditions.
Participants wore headphones and earplugs to protect against the scanner noise, and
their heads were immobilized with foam cushions to minimize movement artifacts. If
visual correction was necessary, participants were provided with appropriate MRI
compatible corrective lenses. A coil-mounted mirror allowed viewing the projection
screen and the white crosshair on a black background was displayed using Presentation
software (Neurobehavioral Systems Inc., Berkely, CA, USA; http://www.neurobs.com).
During fMRI scans, we monitored the participants visually and recorded their
cardiorespiratory and movement parameters. Prior to the experimental phase,
participants underwent an ‘acclimatization session’ in the scanner to acclimatize to
the unfamiliar environment and experimental procedures.
Visual detection task fMRI. Nine of the original participants additionally per-
formed a visual detection task in dim light while still being scanned for additional
4 min 52 s at each ToD. They were instructed to press a button with their right
index finger as soon and as quickly as possible when they saw a low-contrast
orange crosshair (< 1 lux) flashing shortly (500 ms) on the center of a black screen
inside the scanner (background light in the dimly lit scanner room was <0.1 lux).
Three one minute task blocks with 11 crosshair presentations each (randomized
interstimulus interval from 2–10 s) alternated with four 25 s fixation blocks (white
crosshair, <1 lux, as during resting-state measurements).
Data acquisition and preprocessing of resting-state fMRI data. Resting-state
data were collected using a 3 Tesla MRI-scanner (Siemens MAGNETOM Allegra,
syngo MR 2004A, Erlangen, Germany). A total of 12 resting-state sessions of a
gradient-echo T2*-weighted transverse echo-planar imaging sequence (EPI) were
acquired for each participant. A resting-state session comprised 210 EPI volumes
(6 sessions on two subsequent days = 12 × 210 volumes for each participant). Each
volume contained 30 axial slices acquired in a sequential manner, covering the
whole brain (TR/TE/flip angle = 2000ms/30 ms/90°, FOV = 192 mm, matrix size
(resolution) = 64 × 64, voxel size of 3 × 3 × 3 mm³, distance factor 25%). The first 4
volumes were discarded to avoid magnetic saturation effects. Spatial preprocessing
was performed using standard algorithms implemented in SPM 12 (Statistical
Parametrical Mapping 12, Version 6225; Wellcome Trust Center for Neuroima-
ging, London, UK; http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/): head-motion correction via
intra-subject spatial realignment (least squares approach and 6 parameter rigid
body spatial transformation), spatial normalization to the standard EPI template of
the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and resampling to a voxel size of 2 ×
2 × 2 mm³ (using a 12 parameter affine transformation), and spatial smoothing
with an isotropic 8 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel45.
Resting-state BOLD data are contaminated by non-neural signals originating
from residual motion artifacts, respiration, cardiac beats, and scanner drifts, which
makes additional preprocessing steps necessary46. Using in-house scripts in
MATLAB 7.7 (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA; https://www.mathworks.
com/), data were first high pass filtered with a 0.01 Hz cutoff using a 6th order
Butterworth filter. Then, in order to remove the global effect of the various noise
sources, the six motion parameters computed in the realignment step and fMRI
time series from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and white matter (WM), as well as the
first derivatives of each, were detrended and regressed out of the resting-state data
using least squares linear regression. The CSF and WM time series (CSF: averaged
within a 2 mm sphere at MNI coordinates −8, −8, 21, WM: averaged within a 5
mm sphere at MNI coordinates 30, −20, 30) were extracted using the MarsBaR
toolbox (Version 0.44; http://marsbar.sourceforge.net). Finally, a mask based on
the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas47 was applied to all volumes to
restrict further analysis to gray matter-voxels only.
A high-resolution T1-weighted 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition
gradient echo (3D MP-RAGE) sequence was also acquired for each participant
(144 sagittal slices, 1 slab, TR/TE/TI/flip angle = 2250 ms/2.6 ms/900 ms/9°, FOV
= 256 mm, matrix size (resolution) = 224 × 256, voxel size 1 × 1 × 1.10 mm³,
distance factor 50%). The high-resolution anatomical T1 sequence was used to
exclude any structural anomalies and to map the functional results onto an
averaged brain with higher anatomical resolution (see Supplementary Fig. 1).
Single subject analyses of resting-state fMRI data. Three variables of interest
were calculated from the resting-state BOLD time series for each session (ToD)
separately, using in-house scripts in MATLAB 7.7. Whole brain, voxel-wise stan-
dard deviation (SD) of the BOLD signal: We calculated the voxel-wise SD of the
BOLD time series for each ToD, resulting in an SD-map for each ToD. We
obtained voxel-wise SD with:

{x1, x2, …, xn} represents the single values of a time series of length n and x is

Whole brain, voxel-wise amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of the
BOLD signal: The ALFF of the BOLD signal represents the power spectral density
within the frequency band of 0.01–0.1 Hz48,49. Since the power spectrum of a time
series describes how the variance of the data is distributed over the frequency
domain, BOLD ALFF is analogous to BOLD SD in the given frequency range. We
first transformed the BOLD time series into the frequency domain with the fast
Fourier transform algorithm and then obtained BOLD ALFF by averaging the
resulting power spectrum across the frequency band of interest50. Functional
connectivity of the thalami: BOLD time series from the left and right thalamus, as
defined by the AAL atlas, were extracted and averaged within each cluster for each
ToD. The time series was correlated (Pearson’s product-moment correlation
coefficient) with each voxel separately, resulting in a functional connectivity map of
correlation coefficients for each ToD18.
Group analysis of resting-state fMRI data. Group statistical analyses were
performed using SPM 12. First, for each participant, the BOLD SD, ALFF, and
thalamic connectivity values acquired on the two consecutive days were averaged
voxel-wise at each ToD separately, using the ImCalc tool in SPM, yielding BOLD
SD, ALFF and thalamic connectivity whole brain maps for each of the six time
points of interest. Then we used whole-brain, random-effects, one-way repeated
measures ANOVAs (ToD as independent variable with 6 levels, homoscedasticity
and sphericity were assumed) for group inference and tested for a main effect of
ToD with an F-test, for BOLD SD, ALFF and thalamic connectivity values,
respectively. All statistical brain maps were corrected for multiple comparisons by
using cluster-extent based thresholding at P < 0.05, FWE. The cluster-defining
threshold was set at P < 0.001 (uncorrected). We also report the MNI coordinates
of local maxima in these clusters. The denomination of local maxima was adopted
from the SPM Anatomy toolbox51. To identify the ToD-differences driving the
main effect of ToD in BOLD SD, we performed additional post-hoc t-tests. First,
BOLD SD values from significant clusters were averaged within each cluster and
extracted for each ToD and participant separately using MarsBaR. Then, using
IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 22; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA; https://www.ibm.com/
analytics/us/en/technology/spss/), we performed a repeated measures ANOVA
with subsequent pairwise comparisons between all ToD (dependent, paired sam-
ples, two-tailed t-tests with Bonferroni correction, significance threshold at P <
0.05) for each cluster. Clusters in right, left and mesial somatosensory regions were
considered as one. BOLD ALFF values from significant clusters were extracted in
the same way as for BOLD SD and used for planned pairwise comparisons based
on the results of the analysis of BOLD SD (difference between 08:00 and 20:00 h
and, midday measurements 11:00, 14:00, and 17:00 h). Again, clusters in right, left
and mesial somatosensory cortex were considered as one. Clusters in left and right
visual cortex were also considered as one. The three clusters in the left temporal
cortex were also considered as one. Thalamic connectivity values were not inves-
tigated further, because we found no significant main effect of ToD in the whole-
brain, repeated measures ANOVA. Cohen’s d statistic for repeated measures was
calculated after Dunlap et al.52. Functional results of the BOLD SD analyses were
rendered on the ch2better.nii template using MRIcron (Version 4 August 2014;

 http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/mricron/). For visualization purposes,
the high-resolution T1 images (only 13 participants, one participant failed to
appear for the recording of the MP-RAGE sequence) were segmented and nor-
malized in SPM 12, using the standard MNI templates. Then, using ImCalc, we
averaged the T1-images and skull stripped the averaged image by masking with the
gray-matter and white-matter images from the segmentation step. Functional
results for Supplementary Fig. 1 were rendered on the averaged T1-image using
MRIcroGL (Version 1 Jan 2015; http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricrogl/).
Multi-variable adjustment of linear mixed models. Resting-state activity can be
affected by a range of potential confounders. To test whether the observed ToD
effects in BOLD SD were driven by such effects, we calculated a linear mixed model
with resting-state BOLD SD in the visual cortex as dependent variable. This model
included ToD and scanning day as repeated measures fixed effects (autoregressive
covariance structure AR(1)), as well as heart rate, breathing rate, body temperature,
subjective sleepiness, amplitude and variance of head motion parameters, and the
number of outliers in head motion parameters (defined as values above the mean ±
2,5 standard deviations), chronotype, sleep pressure, and sleep debt as fixed effects.
Subjects were included as a random effects variable. We used the restricted max-
imum likelihood estimation method and tested whether the main effect of ToD in
BOLD SD in the visual cortex remained significant (P < 0.05), when including all
these potential confounding factors. To study whether chronotype, sleep pressure,
and sleep debt, as well as scanning day explained part of the ToD modulation in
BOLD variance, we additionally included multiplicative interaction terms in the
multi-variable adjusted, linear mixed model. Interactions were considered sig-
nificant at P < 0.05. A significant interaction between ToD and scanning day could
potentially reveal habituation effects due to repetitive measurements on two sub-
sequent scanning days. Yet, the interaction was not significant (F(5, 41.829) =
0.871, P = 0.509, type III F-test, n = 14).
Region of interest analysis in the suprachiasmatic region. We additionally
investigated ToD effects on resting-state BOLD SD in a region of interest in the
suprachiasmatic region, because this area contains the circadian pacemaker, the
suprachiasmatic nucleus. The region of interest was defined using a published
sphere20 and served for a small volume correction in the BOLD SD voxel-wise
group analysis. We tested for a main effect of ToD using an F-contrast with a
statistical threshold of P < 0.05, small volume corrected.
Analysis of visual detection task fMRI data. The same data acquisition, pre-
processing and single-subject statistical modeling parameters as for the resting-
state BOLD SD analyses were applied to obtain voxel-wise BOLD SD for the whole
brain, in each session (ToD) of the visual detection task blocks (see above). The
first 5 volumes at the beginning of each block were removed to avoid carry-over
effects from the previous block. Then, the three task blocks were concatenated and
BOLD SD calculated separately for each ToD which resulted in a voxel-wise BOLD
SD map for each ToD. Fixation blocks were not further analyzed, because the
experimental conditions were similar to resting-state. Using SPM 12 for group sta-
tistical analyses, task-related BOLD SD in the visual cortex was probed for the ToD-
dependent effects observed during resting-state. As with the resting-state data, task
data on the two consecutive days were averaged voxel-wise at each ToD for each
participant. We tested for BOLD SD reductions at 08:00 and 20:00 h compared to
midday measurements (11:00, 14:00, and 17:00 h) using a one-sample t-test. The
analysis was restricted to the visual cortex cluster that showed a main effect of ToD
during resting-state and results were thus corrected within this mask at P < 0.05, FWE
cluster-corrected (cluster-forming threshold P < 0.001, uncorrected). Values from
significant clusters were averaged within each cluster and extracted for each ToD and
participant separately using MarsBaR and used for subsequent analyses (see below).
We ascertained the consistency of the effect by using the global conjunction
hypothesis53 of the contrasts (08:00 h separately against 11:00, 14:00, and 17:00 h) and
(20:00 h separately against 11:00, 14:00, and 17:00 h).
Comparing resting-state and task-related BOLD SD. We tested for significant
overall decreases in BOLD variance during visual detection compared to rest using
dependent, two-tailed, paired samples t-tests in SPSS (significance threshold at P <
0.05, Bonferroni corrected). The peak-voxel BOLD SD values of significant clusters
from the visual detection task were extracted for each ToD and participant using
MarsBar, then averaged over all ToD and compared with the ToD-averaged rest-
ing-state BOLD SD values at the same coordinates.
Visual detection task performance. Omission errors (i.e., lapses) and reaction
times for each participant and ToD were analyzed using SPSS Statistics. To test for
ToD-dependent differences in visual detection mirroring the ToD-dependent
changes of BOLD SD in sensory cortices, we performed a repeated measures
ANOVA (ToD as independent variable with 6 levels, Mauchly’s test of sphericity
was P ≥ 0.05, unless otherwise stated) with subsequent planned pairwise compar-
isons using dependent, two-tailed t-tests, testing the difference between 08:00 and
20:00 h and, midday measurements (11:00, 14:00, and 17:00 h), respectively (sig-
nificance threshold set at P < 0.05).
Correlation analysis of omission errors and resting-state BOLD SD. A Pearson
product-moment correlation analysis was performed to test for a linear relationship
between resting-state BOLD SD in the visual cortex cluster and omission errors in
visual detection at the same times. Since an ordinary correlation is not appropriate for
repeated measures54, a Pearson correlation coefficient accounting for the dependence
among the repeated measures was calculated, which removes the variance between
subjects55. Therefore, the resulting correlation coefficient represents the association
between BOLD SD and omission errors over all ToD for all participants, corrected for
interindividual differences. The significance threshold was set at P < 0.05.
Correlation analysis of omission errors and task-related BOLD SD. Using the
same procedure as above, we also tested for a linear relationship between task-
related BOLD SD in visual cortex and omission errors in visual detection at the
same times of day. Since the analysis of task-related BOLD SD resulted in two
significant clusters in the visual cortex, correlations were calculated for BOLD SD
in the two clusters separately, significance threshold P < 0.05.
Power analysis for thalamic resting-state functional connectivity. To ascertain
that the negative finding in ToD-dependent thalamocortical connectivity as an
objective marker of vigilance did not result from insufficient statistical power, we
performed a power analysis using a bootstrapping method on a published dataset
in which vigilance changes have been investigated18. For this re-analysis we used
exactly the same parameters that we applied in our study here and investigated
whether vigilance changes (N1 sleep stage vs. wakefulness) could be detected in
14 subjects in the previous dataset. In detail, a total of 93 continuous (≈3.5 min)
epochs of wakefulness and 54 of N1 sleep were selected from Tagliazucchi and
Laufs18. Two sets of 14 epochs were randomly selected (with replacement) from the
wakefulness and N1 sleep sets and the voxel-wise thalamic functional connectivity
(as determined by the AAL atlas47) was computed. We tested for significant group
differences using a mass-univariate two-sample and two-tailed Student’s t-test,
thresholded at P < 0.001 cluster-forming threshold and P < 0.05, FWE corrected on
the cluster level. For each iteration of the randomly selected 14 wakefulness/
N1 sleep epochs, voxels were flagged as significant if their associated P-value ful-
filled these criteria. This was repeated for 1000 iterations, and a voxel-wise
map, showing the proportion of times a voxel was deemed significant, was
obtained. Since significant clusters were observed, the group size of 14 participants
as used in our study can be judged sufficiently large to be sensitive to detect
vigilance changes.
Data availability. The imaging data that support the findings of this study are

code to calculate voxel-wise variables of interest in fMRI data is available upon
