This meta-analysis paper describes the analysis of observational clinical studies on
the treatment of refractory epilepsy with cannabidiol (CBD)-based products. Beyond
attempting to establish the safety and efficacy of such products, we also investigated
if there is enough evidence to assume any difference in efficacy between CBD-rich
extracts compared to purified CBD products. The systematic search took place in
February/2017 and updated in December/2017 using the keywords “epilepsy” or
“Dravet” or “Lennox-Gastaut” or “CDKL5” combined with “Cannabis,” “cannabinoid,”
“cannabidiol,” or “CBD” resulting in 199 papers. The qualitative assessment resulted in
11 valid references, with an average impact factor of 8.1 (ranging from 1.4 to 47.8). The
categorical data of a total of 670 patients were analyzed by Fischer test. The average
daily dose ranged between 1 and 50 mg/kg, with treatment length from 3 to 12 months
(mean 6.2 months). Two thirds of patients reported improvement in the frequency of
seizures (399/622, 64%). There were more reports of improvement from patients treated
with CBD-rich extracts (318/447, 71%) than patients treated with purified CBD (81/175,
46%), with statistical significance (p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, when the standard clinical
threshold of a “50% reduction or more in the frequency of seizures” was applied, only
39% of the individuals were considered “responders,” and there was no difference (p
= 0.52) between treatments with CBD-rich extracts (122/330, 37%) and purified CBD
(94/223, 42%). Patients treated with CBD-rich extracts reported lower average dose
(6.0 mg/kg/day) than those using purified CBD (25.3 mg/kg/day). The reports of mild
(158/216, 76% vs. 148/447, 33%, p < 0.001) and severe (41/155, 26% vs. 23/328, 7%,
p < 0.0001) adverse effects were more frequent in products containing purified CBD
than in CBD-rich extracts. CBD-rich extracts seem to present a better therapeutic profile
than purified CBD, at least in this population of patients with refractory epilepsy. The roots
of this difference is likely due to synergistic effects of CBD with other phytocompounds
(aka Entourage effect), but this remains to be confirmed in controlled clinical studies.

Benefits of Cannabis Extracts in Epilepsy
INTRODUCTION
Derivative products from the Cannabis sativa plant have
historically been used for a number of neurological disorders,
as broad as pain and appetite stimulation in oncological and
HIV patients (1). The delicate balance between therapeutic
and adverse effects in medicinal Cannabis yields controversial
discussions in the literature (2–4), where the main psychoactive
cannabinoid compound—delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
is
the
major
protagonist.
More
recently,
another
non-
psychoactive cannabinoid–cannabidiol (CBD)—has received
a lot of attention, since its promising pharmacological profile
suggests a broader therapeutic index compared to THC. CBD has
been described as a potential therapeutic compound to control
seizures in humans in the 80’s (5) and since then, several other
studies have extended this data (6–15).
The natural source of CBD is a variety of Cannabis plants
called “hemp” or “fiber-type Cannabis,” where one can find a high
ratio between CBD and THC compounds, sometimes around
30:1 (CBD:THC), with negligible amounts of THC (16, 17).
Fiber-type Cannabis are, by definition, Cannabis with <0.3%
THC content, which is not considered controlled substance by
the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (18). Hemp
extracts became an internet buzz (19), with several anecdotal
descriptions of therapeutic effects in children with treatment-
resistant epilepsies, especially Dravet syndrome, starting to
appear since 2013 (11, 20, 21). Preclinical evidence support anti-
convulsant properties of CBD [reviewed in Hill et al. (22) and
Devinsky et al. (23)]. Furthermore, a number of observational
papers suggested good tolerability and therapeutic benefits in
seizure control, with patients experiencing low frequency of
side effects (6–15). Few randomized control trials in specific
diseases have followed (24, 25) and the putative neuronal
mechanism of action is still to be established, with the more
likely candidates being inhibition of endocannabinoid uptake,
allosteric modulation of CB1 receptors, activation of 5-HT1A
serotoninergic receptors anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant effects
[reviewed in Bih et al. (26)].
The first CBD-based product was just recently registered
for
the
treatment
of
treatment-resistant
epilepsies
(27).
Meanwhile, the patients are using non-registered hemp extracts
and
derivative
products
that
are
considered
“nutritional
supplements” with high CBD content and often unknown THC
concentration. These products are not considered controlled
substances at the production countries and are being distributed
in many countries via exceptional import mechanisms.
Despite several positive anecdotal pieces of evidence of
patients and family members about the “CBD extracts,” which
are broadly publicized through several magazines and TV shows
worldwide; until now, there is no consensus on the medical
literature about the efficacy and safety of these products. Some
observational studies are available on scientific literature, but
there is a scarcity of clinical data acquired within the logic, rigor
and organization necessary to the conduction of clinical studies
destined to the registration of a pharmaceutical product.
The objective of the present study is to conduct a meta-
analysis to investigate the available data about the clinical use of
CBD-rich products for patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy.
Whenever possible, we also tried to investigate if there was any
difference of efficacy and side effects between “purified CBD” and
CBD-rich extracts.
META-ANALYSIS SEARCH STRATEGY
Sources
A systematic search was performed on MEDLINE/PubMed
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed)
and
Google
Scholar
(http://scholar.google.com)
databases
intending
to
identify
original papers with clinical data (observational) on the use of
Cannabis and its compounds on the treatment of refractory
epilepsy. Main focus was on cannabidiol (CBD) and CBD-rich
Cannabis extracts, whose use has been disseminated among
infant and juvenile patients of treatment-resistant forms of
epilepsy. The search was limited to papers published in English,
with results obtained from human beings in parent surveys
and proper medical records. The systematic search took place
in February/2017 and updated in December/2017 using the
keywords “child” and “epilepsy” or “Dravet” or “Lennox-
Gastaut” or “CDKL5” combined with “Cannabis,” “cannabinoid,”
“cannabidiol,” or “CBD.” We made every effort to include the
available data, including searching through the paper references
to identify additional sources, contacting the studies’ authors and
presenting a preliminary version of this study in two conferences
to gather additional information that we could have missed in
the first search. Papers containing only title and/or abstracts
were not included, as well as unpublished results (at the time of
the first search one in press article was included, but it is now
officially published). Pre-print servers like PeerJ and BioRxiv
were also used for the search, but did not reveal any forthcoming
useful clinical study.
Study Selection
The titles, abstracts and full texts of all search results had their
eligibility analyzed, considering inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Inclusion criteria: studies containing observational clinical data
in humans that could infer the efficacy and/or safety profile of
the products containing cannabinoids for epilepsy. Exclusion
criteria: Review and opinion papers, case studies, studies with no
measurable data, and studies with no accessible numerical data.
Papers describing studies in prospective and retrospective design
were considered eligible, regardless of the kind and duration of
treatment. Papers failing to present objective measurement of
seizures and/or objective measurements of clinical improvement
were disregarded. Papers presenting partial data (example: data
for clinical improvement, but not for adverse effects) were
included only in the appropriate sections of the meta-analysis
study.
Treatment of Clinical Data and Statistical
Analysis
Classical objective clinical outcomes in the research field of
epilepsy were used to group the articles. Subjective clinical
outcomes like “reported improvement” were considered, but
the more objective “reduction of the number of seizures” was

Benefits of Cannabis Extracts in Epilepsy
preferred. Data regarding the reduction in the seizures frequency
were grouped in two cumulative thresholds, (1) reduction in
seizures frequency >50% (classically considered a “responder” to
the treatment in epilepsy studies) and (2) reduction in seizures
frequency >70% were considered for objective measurement
of treatment efficacy in the pooled data (whenever available).
The relative number of “responders” in each study was used
as the main objective measurement to evaluate efficacy and for
comparison between treatment types (purified CBD vs. CBD-
rich Cannabis extracts). Data were pooled together in categorical
variable format (proportion of patients) for combined analysis.
Data from papers using continuous variable format (percentage,
or individual frequency reduction) were inferred/estimated and
transformed in categorical variable for further analysis. In two
cases, the authors were contacted for additional information
that could not be inferred from the paper. The transformed
data were analyzed statistically by the Fischer test for categorical
variables. The data of every paper was organized in tables
and plotted in RawGraphs (http://app.rawgraphs.io/) for the
scatterplot diagram. Direct comparisons were performed among
different epileptic encephalopathies (Lennox-Gastaut patients
vs. whole epileptic population; Dravet syndrome patients vs.
whole epileptic population) and between “purified CBD” and
“CBD-rich extracts” preparations, whenever possible (Fischer
test, p < 0.05).
As clinical safety outcomes, all reported outcomes of adverse
events were considered and grouped afterwards by similarity. The
objective data considered were the “frequency of adverse events,”
categorized according to the symptoms and severity (“mild” or
“severe”), according to the description in the original paper.
Clinical Studies Considered in the
Meta-Analysis
The systematic search took place in February/2017 and updated
on the 13th of December 2017 using the keywords “child”
and “epilepsy” or “Dravet” or “Lennox-Gastaut” or “CDKL5”
combined with “Cannabis,” “cannabinoid,” “cannabidiol,” or
“CBD” resulting in 199 papers. From these, 138 were duplicates
and were removed. The remained 61 records were screened
and 42 of these studies were excluded. Nineteen (19) papers
were assessed for eligibility and 6 papers were excluded due to
lack of observational clinical data (ex: preclinical studies). The
qualitative assessment of 13 articles resulted in 11 valid references
for analysis, with an average impact factor of 8.1 (ranging from
1.4 to 47.8) (Figure 1).
All the studies included are fairly recent, published between
2013 and 2017, showing how vivid this subject is in the
scientific literature worldwide. Overall, the papers analyzed
report observational clinical data from 670 patients, treated with
CBD-rich Cannabis extracts or purified CBD, with average daily
doses between 1 and 50 mg/kg, and duration of treatment from 3
to 12 months (average of 6.5 months), as shown in Table 1 below.
From the selected studies, six (6) show a retrospective design
(with a total of 447 patients) and 5 show a prospective design
(with a total of 223 patients). The quality of evidence reported
in the papers is a relevant variable: three (3) studies used
research based on online questionnaires with family members
and caretakers (179 patients) and 8 studies report evidence
from proper medical history (491 patients). As for the type
of treatment, five (5) studies report data from patients who
used purified CBD (223 patients) and 6 studies report data
from patients who used Cannabis extracts with high CBD
content, whose composition is not standardized (466 patients).
Noteworthy, these variables don’t seem to constitute an obvious
bias compromising interpretation of data, since the groups are
relatively well balanced. The only remarkable difference is that
all studies using purified CBD had a prospective design, while
the studies using CBD-rich extracts had a retrospective design.
All studies were conducted by medical centers experienced in
conducting this type of study, at universities or internationally
reputed research centers. Curiously, nine (9) out of the 11 studies
were conducted or lead by universities or research centers in the
United States (553 patients). One study was conducted in Israel
(74 patients) and another in Mexico (43 patients). All studies
used a heterogeneous population of epilepsy patients, and the
segmentation in specific types of syndromes was eventually done
afterwards (Figure 1).
The majority of the studied population consisted of children
and adolescents, between 1 (one) and 18 (eighteen) years old
with treatment-resistant epilepsy (refractory epilepsy), who tried
between 4 (four) and 12 (twelve) other medications for 3 (three)
years before trying CBD-based treatments. Needless to say, this
population constitutes a very hard-to-treat population, diagnosed
with treatment-resistant epileptic syndromes. Roughly, this
affects one-third of the total population of epileptic patients.
RESULTS
The results of efficacy in the studied population suggest that
treatment
with
CBD-based
products
significantly
reduces
seizure
frequency,
even
for
this
otherwise
treatment-
resistant population. According to the analysis of “reported
improvement,”
which
means,
any
improvement
reported
in the selected papers, almost 2/3 of the patients had an
observed reduction in seizure frequency (399/622, 64%), with
individual studies rate ranging between 37 and 89% (Table 2;
Figure 2). Notably, 6 out of 11 studies showed over 80%
of the patients reporting improvement. There was a higher
number of patients reporting improvement after using CBD-rich
Cannabis extracts (318/447, 71%) than those treated with
purified CBD (81/175, 46%), with valid statistical significance
(p < 0.0001).
However, when the clinical threshold of “reduction of 50%
or more in seizure frequency” was evaluated, only 39% of the
individuals were considered responders (studies varying between
24 and 74%), and there was no difference (p = 0.52) between
treatments with CBD-rich extracts (122/330, 37%) and purified
CBD (94/223, 42%). The mean dose, regardless of treatment
was 15.0 mg/kg/day of CBD equivalent. The average daily dose
reported for purified CBD was 25.3 mg/kg/day, while the average
daily dose of CBD equivalent reported for CBD-rich Cannabis
extract was merely 6.0 mg/kg/day.

represents the rate of clinical improvement (from 0 to 1, 100% = 1). The Y-axis is arbitrary “Study ID.” The size of each point represents the number of patients
included in the study and gives an idea of the “weight” of each study. The dotted line is the average, regardless of treatment. Each type of treatment (Purified CBD vs.
CBD-rich extracts) is coded with a different color, according to the legend. Same data as Table 1, except for one study (10) due to unreported data.
Moreover, there was no difference among subtypes of epileptic
encephalopathies (Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes),
although the data implies that patients from these two genetic-
related epileptic syndrome are more sensitive to CBD treatment
(Supplementary Table 1). At least 27% of all treated patients
showed an “improvement >70%” in seizures frequency (83/311
patients) and the studies varied between 18 and 57% (Table 2).
The “seizure free” endpoint was not used for the analysis because
it is not a parameter used by a significant amount of the selected
studies. The number of individuals that remained free of seizures
was close to 10% in the papers reporting this endpoint, which is
a relevant amount for a population that tried several prior anti-
epileptic medications without success. The proportion of patients
reporting any improvement and “classical” responders was also

relatively high for a treatment-resistant population and is slightly
above the number of responders commonly observed in studies
of registered anti-epileptic drugs (29–31).
Beyond the direct therapeutic effect of CBD in reducing
epileptic seizures, reports about improvement in “secondary”
health aspects were very common. They shall not be negligible,
since they provide a significant improvement in quality of
life for the patients and their family members. Secondary
endpoints were reported for 285 patients in the selected papers.
Unfortunately, not all studies considered such endpoints
during their development. The main secondary effects were
improvements in awareness (147/285, 52%), quality of sleep
(88/285,
31%),
mood
(87/285,
30%),
behavior/aggression
(56/285, 20%), language/cognition (19/285, 7%), and motor
skills (19/285, 7%) (Table 3). There were also reports of other
improvements, but for the sake of the current meta-analysis,
only those affecting at least 5% of the studied population were
considered. Arguably, these effects occurred as a consequence of
the seizures reduction, but in many cases they occurred before or
even in the absence of significant reductions of epileptic seizures
(considering each case individually). There were no reports of
secondary health aspects in studies of purified CBD (6–10).
However, it’s impossible to conclude that no improvements
on secondary endpoints occurred with this type of treatment;
rather, it is more likely that the study didn’t focus on this clinical
phenomenon. As demonstrated in one of the studies with 117
patients (12), in a direct comparison of the same population, the
conventional antiepileptic drugs caused an improvement in these
“secondary” parameters related to quality of life, but this effect
occurred in a smaller scale than with CBD-based treatments.
This is true, at least, for the effects in mood improvement,
awareness, sleep quality, and self-control. This data suggests
that secondary positive events described for CBD are attributed
to this substance, and not only due to the reduction in the
frequency of seizures (Table 3).
Although treatment with CBD products is regarded as at least
equally safe in comparison to regular anti-epileptic drugs, CBD
is not devoid of adverse effects (11). The studies mention the
occurrence of adverse events on a relatively large portion of
the population studied (217/422, 51%), even though the great
majority of events are considered “mild.” Severe events were
reported by a smaller portion of patients (64/422, 15%) (11).
Importantly, in this case, we are considering only patients of
studies that mentioned the occurrence of adverse effects. To
improve accuracy, if the study did not mention adverse events, we
considered that it was not reasonable to assume that there were
no adverse events and, therefore, the whole study was excluded
of the analysis. Two studies containing only 20 patients were
excluded according to this criterion (7, 8). Counter-intuitively,
there is also an advantage of CBD-rich extracts in relation to
purified CBD regarding the occurrence of adverse events. The
reports of mild (158/216, 76% vs. 148/447, 33%, p < 0.001)
and severe (41/155, 26% vs. 23/328, 7%, p < 0.0001) adverse
effects were more frequent in products containing purified CBD
that in CBD-rich extracts. The most common adverse events
reported were appetite alteration, sleepiness, gastrointestinal
disturbances/diarrhea, weight changes, fatigue, and nausea.
Uncommon or rare adverse events include thrombocytopenia,
respiratory infections and alteration of the liver enzymes
(Table 4).
DISCUSSION
The present meta-analysis study confirms the anecdotal evidence
that CBD treatment improves seizure control in patients with
treatment-resistant epilepsy. Pooled together, the data from 11
studies provide strong evidence in support of the therapeutic
value of high-CBD treatments, at least as far as this population
of 670 patients is regarded. Important to say, not every study
reported all the clinical parameters (e.g., % of responders,
side effects, quality of life endpoints, etc.), therefore, the
analysis might be skewed in some way that it’s impossible
to account for. The difference in the quality of the studies
is also an important limitation that should be taken into
consideration.
This said, it’s clear that CBD works for this type of epilepsy,
with over 60% of volunteers describing clinical improvement
and nearly 40% being clinical responders at a hard threshold of

over 50% reduction in seizure frequency (Table 2, this study).
With the observational non-blinded design, it’s impossible to
quantify how much of this response would be due to placebo
effect. It’s common to see placebo effects ranging from 15 to
25% in well-conducted epilepsy studies (24, 25), but a recent
clinical study surprisingly showed a placebo effect as high
as 40% (32). This might suggest a big impact of the belief
in the current “fashionable” therapy using cannabinoids on
reported therapeutic responses. More objective physiological
measures would help to improve accuracy and are welcome in
cannabinoid-related clinical studies.
One remarkable observation of this study is the difference
in average dose reported by patients taking “plant-based” and
“purified” CBD treatments. Curiously, even though treatment
with CBD-rich extracts and purified CBD yielded similar, the
patients treated with CBD-rich extracts reported a significantly
lower average daily dose than patients using purified CBD. As
described in the results section, the average dose described by
patients taking CBD-rich Cannabis extracts was over 4 times
lower than the dose reported by patients taking purified CBD
(Table 2). This data suggests that CBD is 4 times “more potent”
when administered in herbal form, probably because other
minor compounds present in the extract may contribute to its
therapeutic effect (33). The interpretation of higher potency of
CBD in combination with other minor compounds is in line with
previous reports of synergistic effects between cannabinoid and
even non-cannabinoid compounds (34).
For instance, King et al. (35) described a clear synergistic
effect of the combination between CBD and THC, where THC
potentiates CBD effects in a mouse model of neuropathic
pain in substantially smaller dose range than when CBD is
given alone. This was already described in the classic study
by Karniol and Carlini where CBD blocked certain effects of
THC: catatonia in mice, corneal arreflexia in rabbits, increased
defecation and decreased ambulation in rats in the open field
after chronic administration, and aggressiveness in rats after
REM-sleep deprivation. In contrast, CBD potentiated THC
analgesia in mice and the impairment of rope climbing in rats
(36). Similar examples of pharmacological interaction between
these cannabinoids were summarized in Russo and Guy (37).
Another interesting aspect of cannabinoid pharmacology is
that CBD tends to block some of adverse events of THC,
like anxiety and paranoia (38). Modern pharmacology suggests
that these effects are due to allosteric modulation of CB1
cannabinoid receptors by CBD (39, 40). This means that
CBD exerts a “fine-tuning” of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor
affecting the interaction of other cannabinoids at the receptor
level. Noteworthy, the original description of the physiology
of allosteric modulation of these receptors was performed
by the main author of the current paper (41). Whether or
not this mechanism contributes to the anti-epileptic effects
of cannabinoid remain to be established, but preliminary
evidence of CBD/THC synergistic interaction in a mouse
model of refractory epilepsy were recently reported in the
congress of the International Cannabinoid Research Society
[Anderson et al. (42) oral presentation in ICRS]. On top of
this, minor plant cannabinoids like canabidivivarin (CBDV),

tetrahydrocannabivivarin (THCV), and cannabinol (CBN) are
also anti-convulsants (43–48).
When it comes to adverse events, the same pattern was
true: patients treated with CBD-rich extracts tend to show less
adverse events, regardless of its severity. This is counter-intuitive,
and we believe that it might be secondary to the dose. Since
patients taking CBD-rich extracts reported lower CBD dose, it’s
reasonable to expect lower side effects, including those related
with the oil vehicle itself, like gastrointestinal discomfort or
abdominal pain.
The most common adverse events reported were appetite
alteration,
sleepiness,
gastrointestinal
disturbances/diarrhea,
weight changes, fatigue, and nausea. Uncommon or rare adverse
events include thrombocytopenia, respiratory infections, and
alteration of the liver enzymes. There was a worsening of
the seizure burden in some cases, but this is uncommon and
cannot be necessarily attributed to the treatment. Uncommon or
rare events reported occurred in combination with other anti-
epileptic medication, particularly valproic acid and clobazam,
and may be related to drug interaction, and not due to direct
CBD toxicity. Data from a recent study suggested that CBD tends
to reduce the occurrence of adverse events, in general, when
used as an add-on therapy to other anti-convulsants (12). In that
cohort with 117 patients, CBD reduced the occurrence of fatigue,
sleepiness, irritability, insomnia, appetite loss, aggressiveness,
nausea, dizziness, anxiety, confusion, weight loss, vomiting, and
obsessive behavior in 5–10 times. Among an extensive list, the
only adverse events that actually increased with the addition of
CBD were weight gain and increased appetite (about 2 times
higher).
In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that treatments
using CBD are effective and safe, at least in the population of
patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy, considering risks, and
benefits inherent to the treatment of this severe neurological

condition. A considerable share of patients obtains benefits
from this treatment, and the adverse events, when they
occur, are fairly mild. Apparently, CBD-rich Cannabis extracts
are more potent and have a better safety profile (but not
higher efficacy) than products with purified CBD. The lack
of standardization among Cannabis extracts does not allow
us to infer which characteristics of the product provide
this therapeutic advantage. However, considering the scientific
literature describing the “entourage effect” in plant compounds
(34–37) and in the endocannabinoid system (41, 49), it’s
reasonable to suggest that the higher potency of the CBD-
rich Cannabis extracts over purified CBD is related to other
plant compounds acting synergistically to CBD, as discussed
above. Controlled studies with standardized Cannabis extracts
are necessary to confirm if these compounds contribute per se or
synergistically for the anticonvulsive effect of Cannabis and its
derivatives.
