Abstract. Cocoa-related products like chocolate have taken an important place in our food habits and culture. In this work,
we aim to examine the relationship between chocolate consumption and cognitive decline in an elderly cognitively healthy
population. In the present longitudinal prospective study, a cohort of 531 participants aged 65 and over with normal Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE; median 28) was selected. The median follow-up was 48 months. Dietary habits were
evaluated at baseline. The MMSE was used to assess global cognitive function at baseline and at follow-up. Cognitive decline
was defined by a decrease ≥ 2 points in the MMSE score between evaluations. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval
(95%CI) estimates were adjusted for age, education, smoking, alcohol drinking, body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes.
Chocolate intake was associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline (RR = 0.59, 95%CI 0.38–0.92). This protective effect
was observed only among subjects with an average daily consumption of caffeine lower than 75 mg (69% of the participants;
RR = 0.50, 95%CI 0.31–0.82). To our knowledge, this is the first prospective cohort study to show an inverse association
between regular long-term chocolate consumption and cognitive decline in humans.

INTRODUCTION
Chocolate consumption is generally considered a
pleasant widespread habit. Despite the drawbacks
related to the high caloric intake associated with this
practice, several potential benefits on different main
systems in the human physiology have been investi-
gated, namely in the cardiovascular, immunological,
and neurological systems [1]. Many of the advan-
tages of chocolate consumption have been attributed
to the properties of some of its components, such as
the polyphenolic structures named flavonoids (spe-
cially procyanidins and flavanols) [2] and also the

methylxanthine compounds present in chocolate,
namely caffeine and theobromine [3]. In the past few
years, the existence of enhancing cognitive effects
and improvement in mood related to chocolate or
chocolate components has been emphasized [4].
It is important to acknowledge that most studies
evaluated the cognitive effects of chocolate, cocoa
supplements, or cocoa flavonoids given as acute
[5–8] and sub-acute [8–11] administration. On the
other hand, several epidemiological studies looked
at the potential benefits of antioxidants in general or
flavonoid-rich foods on cognitive decline or the risk
for dementia [12–16]. However, the potential effects
of long-term consumption of chocolate on improv-
ing cognitive performance, or preventing cognitive
decline, remain largely unexplored.
The present study is aimed to assess the associa-
tion between long-term chocolate consumption and

cognitive decline, extending a previous analysis of
the association between caffeine consumption and
cognitive decline [17]. The hypothesis that chocolate
could decrease the incidence of cognitive decline by
at least 2 points in the score of a widely used cognitive
test, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),
was specifically tested in subjects aged 65 and over
participating in a cohort study.
METHODS
Study population
This study was based on the evaluation of a cohort
of adults living in Porto, as previously described [17].
Briefly, a total of 2,485 participants were recruited
between 1999 and 2003, by random digit dialing
having households as the sampling unit; when a
household was selected, all residents were identi-
fied by age and gender, and one resident (aged 18
or more years) was randomly selected as the respon-
dent, without replacement if there was a refusal. The
participation rate was 70%. A visit to the Depart-
ment of Clinical Epidemiology, Predictive Medicine
and Public Health of Porto Medical School (for-
mer Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology of
Porto Medical School) was scheduled by telephone
according to the participant’s convenience. A per-
sonal interview, using a structured questionnaire
comprising data on socio-demographic, clinical, and
lifestyle exposures, and a physical examination was
performed by trained interviewers. From the whole
cohort, 648 participants were aged 65 and over and
531 were selected for the present study, after exclu-
sion of 62 cognitively impaired at baseline (the
criteria used to define cognitive impairment is defined
below), 32 for whom there was no baseline MMSE,
and 23 for whom there was no information on choco-
late or caffeine intake.
Follow-up evaluation
The follow-up evaluation of the cohort took place
between 2 to 9 years after the recruitment moment. A
visit to the Porto Medical School was scheduled, for
questionnaire evaluation and physical examination of
the participants.
Cognitive testing
The MMSE [18, 19] was used to assess global
cognitive function at baseline and at follow-up. The
MMSE, which includes questions on orientation, reg-
istration, attention and calculation, recall, language,
and visual construction, was originally designed for
clinical practice, but is now extensively used in epi-
demiological studies. Although it does not assess
executive function, a major feature of cognitive
decline [18], the MMSE is a reliable and valid test
for cognitive impairment, has high test-retest relia-
bility, and is a good indicator of clinically significant
cognitive decline [20]. The cut-off values adjusted for
education levels were used as proposed in other stud-
ies[21,22];inthepresentinvestigation,thenormative
cut-off values of MMSE adjusted for education for
the Portuguese population were used [19]. Subjects
that had a MMSE score below cutoff at baseline were
considered to be cognitively impaired and therefore
excluded. Participants had to score above 15 if they
were illiterate, above 22 if they had ≤ 11 years of
education, and above 27 if they had > 11 years of
education.
A decline of at least 2 points in the score of the
MMSE from baseline to the follow-up visit was con-
sidered meaningful from a clinical point of view [23].
Chocolate and caffeine dietary intake
Dietary habits in the 12 months preceding the
baseline interview were evaluated using a semi-
quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)
comprising 82 food and beverage items or groups.
It was designed according to Willett et al. [24], and
was adapted by inclusion of a variety of typical
Portuguese food items and validated as previously
described. For each FFQ item, subjects were asked
the average frequency of consumption and the por-
tion size usually consumed (based on a photograph
manual with small, medium, and large portion sizes).
This information was used to estimate the average
daily intake of each item by multiplying the usual
frequency of intake per day by the average portion
size of the corresponding item.
The food items/groups of the FFQ used to address
chocolate overall consumption were chocolate bars,
chocolate snacks, and cocoa powder. Although
the FFQ used in the present study required the
assessment of the consumption of chocolate bars,
chocolate snacks, and cocoa powder, only the over-
all consumption of chocolate was recorded, with
no discrimination whether it was milk of dark.
Food Processor Plus®, version 5.0, was used to
obtain estimates of caffeine dietary intake. The food
items/groups of the FFQ from which caffeine could
 A. Moreira et al. / Chocolate Prevents Cognitive Decline
87
be obtained were: Coffee, tea, ice-tea, coke, and
chocolate. A common limitation in dietary studies
is the error in the estimates of nutrients. If the types
of certain foods are not specified (i.e., dark choco-
late versus milk chocolate), it is possible to over or
underestimate true associations with outcomes [25].
In the case of chocolate, there is a wide variety on
theobromine concentration among different types of
chocolate and the theobromine/caffeine ratio has also
been observed to be highly variable, from 1.9 to 10.6
[26]. Because of this limitation, we decided to focus
on chocolate intake, data we could access directly
from the FFQ.
Socio-demographic, clinical, and other
behavioral factors
The assessment of socio-demographic, clinical,
and other behavioral factors was previously described
in detail [17] and is briefly described in footnotes of
Table 1.
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was conducted in 309 subjects who at
baseline were aged 65 or more and had a MMSE not
compatible with cognitive impairment, and who were
re-evaluated. Comparison of the baseline character-
istics between subjects that were followed, died, or
were lost to follow up was done using the Chi-Square
or the Kruskal-Wallis tests, as appropriate, to com-
pare all groups.
The association between chocolate intake and the
development of cognitive impairment was quanti-
fied through crude and age-, education-, body mass
index-, diabetes-, hypertension-, smoking- and alco-
hol drinking-adjusted relative risks (RR) and respec-
tive 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) using Poisson
regression. Data were analyzed using STATA®,
version 11.
Decline in cognitive performance was defined as a
decrease of at least two points on the MMSE from the
baseline assessment to follow up and impairment in
cognitive performance was defined based on norma-
tive cut-off values of MMSE adjusted for education
for the Portuguese population [19].
Ethics
This study was approved by a local Ethics Com-
mittee, and all participants gave written informed
consent.
RESULTS
Among the 531 participants that were eligible,
309 (58.2%) completed the follow-up evaluation
(median follow-up: 48 months), 58 (10.9%) died
before follow-up could be accomplished and there
were 164 (30.9%) losses to follow-up. Participants

and alcohol consumption were assessed as previously described [17]. Arterial hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140
mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg and/or current antihypertensive drug therapy [46]. Participants on anti-diabetic therapy
and/or with fasting plasma glucose concentrations ≥ 126 mg/dL and/or diagnosed with diabetes by a health professional were considered
to have diabetes mellitus [47]. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by squared height (m2), and further divided into the following
categories [48]: Obese (≥30 kg/m2), overweight (25.0–29.9 kg/m2), normal and underweight (<24.9 kg/m2). Regarding smoking habits and
the consumption of alcoholic beverages, subjects were categorized in never- and ever-smokers and never- and ever-drinkers. †one standard

who died during the follow up period were more
likely to be older, hypertensive, to have a lower BMI,
and worse MMSE score. No statistically significant
differences between the groups were found regarding
education,smoking,alcohol,diabetes,andcaffeineor
chocolate consumption (Table 1).
About one third of the participants suffered
decline in the MMSE during the follow-up, defined
as �MMSE≤-2 between baseline and follow-up.
Chocolate intake was independently associated with
an about 40% lower risk of cognitive decline
(Table2).Analyzingdifferentlevelsofchocolatecon-
sumption, the lower risk of cognitive decline was
statistically significant for lesser levels of choco-
late intake, that is, for participants with an average
weekly consumption of chocolate lower than one
standard portion, corresponding to three pieces of
chocolate bar, one chocolate snack, or one tablespoon
of cocoa powder (Table 2). To see whether the lower
risk of cognitive decline in moderate chocolate con-
sumers was modified by caffeine intake, a stratified
analysis according to the levels of caffeine dietary
intake was performed. The protective effect of choco-
late consumption was observed only among subjects
with an average daily consumption of caffeine lower
than 75 mg, the average caffeine content in one
espresso (Fig. 1). Since the duration of follow-up
was relatively heterogeneous, we conducted a sen-
sitivity analysis including only the participants with
duration of follow-up within the interquartile range of
its distribution, which corresponds to approximately
half the sample, confirming that chocolate intake
was independently associated with a lower risk of
cognitive decline. A stratified analysis by sex was
also performed, and no differences were observed
between women and men regarding the association
of chocolate intake with a lower risk of cognitive
decline.
During the follow-up few participants showed
decline in the MMSE score to values below the cut-
offs for cognitive impairment, and chocolate intake
was not significantly associated with a decreased
risk of cognitive impairment (Table 2). Similarly to
the observed for cognitive decline, we found that
the overall caffeine intake modified the associa-
tion between chocolate consumption and cognitive
impairment, and chocolate had a protective effect
only among participants with the lowest levels of
overall exposure to caffeine, though this was not sta-
tistically significant (Fig. 1).
DISCUSSION
The present results suggest that regular long-term
consumption of chocolate has a protective effect on
cognitive decline in elderly patients, as defined by
the decrease in two or more points in the MMSE. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective

cohort study that specifically addresses the long-term
effectsofchocolateconsumptiononcognitivedecline
in humans.
Effects of cocoa-related products on animal cog-
nitive function were previously described. One
study investigated the short-term effect of a cocoa
polyphenolic extract, Acticoa powder, on free rad-
icals produced by leucocytes after heat exposure
and the protective effects on subsequent cognitive
impairments. The authors concluded that 14-days
oral administration of Acticoa powder could protect
heat-exposed rats from cognitive impairment, and
suggested that the improved cognitive outcomes may
have been consequence of preservation of brain func-
tion as a result of reduced inflammatory aggression,
or enhanced cerebral plasticity [27]. Another study
addressed the effects of long-term (12 months) oral
supplementation of the same polyphenolic extract,
Acticoa powder, on cognitive functions in aged rats,
showing improved cognitive performance in terms of
spatial memory and short- and long- term learning.
In this light, the authors suggested that Acticoa pow-
der could be beneficial in retarding age-related brain
impairments, including cognitive deficits in normal
ageing and perhaps neurodegenerative disorders [28].
Regarding human studies, the effects of choco-
late/cocoa administration on cognition were system-
atically reviewed by Scholey et al. in 2013. The
authors found that 3 out of the 8 studies that met
the criteria for inclusion revealed evidence for cog-
nitive enhancement following cocoa flavanols and
methylxanthine intake [29]. All studies examined the
cognitive effects of potentially psychoactive fractions
ofchocolate:5studiesfocusedoncocoaflavanolfrac-
tions of cocoa [5–7, 9, 10] and 3 (from two articles)
on combinations of the methylxanthines, caffeine,
and theobromine [30, 31]. This review concluded
that there are measurable neurocognitive effects with
acute administration of cocoa flavanols, caffeine,
and theobromine, in isolation and in combination,
and suggested that some effects of chocolate and
chocolate components could be due to attenuation
of negative mood. Furthermore, the review pointed
out that the dosing periods of the enrolled studies
varied from 5 days to 6 weeks, and it was hypothe-
sized that the lack of positive outcomes was related to
possible methodological limitations [29]. Three other
randomized controlled trials were published after
this systematic review. One study recruited patients
with mild cognitive impairment set to consume cocoa
drinks once daily for 8 weeks providing the first evi-
dence that regular cocoa flavanol consumption could
positively enhance cognitive function in cognitively
impaired adults [32]. Another study found that daily
cocoa consumption for 8 weeks can improve spe-
cific aspects of cognitive performance in a group of
cognitively intact older adults [11]. The third study,
conducted to investigate the effects of both acute
 90
A. Moreira et al. / Chocolate Prevents Cognitive Decline
and sub-acute (four-weeks) Theobroma cacao seed
extract on mood and mental fatigue, cognitive per-
formance and cardiovascular functioning in young,
healthy adults, could find no benefit for the supple-
mentation with this cocoa extract [8].
It is possible that regular ingestion of choco-
late/cocoa might have long-term cognitive protection
or enhancement effects that are not revealed in short-
term studies. Notwithstanding the methodological
limitations due to difficulties in controlling con-
founding and minimizing potential bias due to losses
of follow-up, observational epidemiological studies
may address consequences of long-term exposure to
chocolate/cocoa. Despite not being focused solely on
chocolate but also on the consumption of tea and
wine, a cross-sectional study involving 2031 subjects
(aged 70–74 years) by Nurk et al. in 2009, based on
the food habits reported in the previous year, con-
cluded that habitual chocolate consumers performed
better in all cognitive tests applied and that the risk for
poor test performance had been significantly reduced
by chocolate consumption [16].
The present study confirmed in longitudinal cohort
design that regular long-term consumption of choco-
late has a protective effect on cognitive decline
in elderly patients. Certainly this effect might
be due to several components of cocoa/chocolate.
The methylxanthines present in chocolate, caffeine
and theobromine, are nonspecific antagonists of
adenosine receptors at concentrations attained with
common dietary intake [3]. Whereas caffeine is
the most abundant methylxanthine in coffee, theo-
bromine has been found to be the main xanthine in
all types of chocolate [3, 33]. The combination of
caffeine and theobromine in the proportions found
in cacao and chocolate has been shown to display
psycho-stimulant effects [30, 34]. Caffeine has been
more widely explored, showing a protective effect
against cognitive impairment and cognitive decline
[35] and a possible preventive effect on the devel-
opment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [36]. On the
other hand, the effects of theobromine have been
less studied than those of caffeine, and the poten-
tial neurobiological effects of theobromine are still
poorly understood [33, 37], partially due to the preva-
lent idea that it is a weak central nervous system
stimulant [38, 39], and has only been showed to
produce very minor subjective effects compared to
caffeine [40]. In fact, while theobromine displays a
longer half-life compared to caffeine (7.2 h against
4.1 h) [41], theobromine seems to be 2- to 3-fold
less active than caffeine as an antagonist of the
adenosine A1 receptors in rat brain and at least 10-
fold less active than caffeine as an antagonist of
A2A receptors [42]. However, theobromine may have
other actions, independent on adenosine receptors
blockade, as gene inducer or repressor [37]. Inter-
estingly, contrary to what is observed for humans,
theobromine appears to be toxic in some mammals
[33]. The reasons for this different profile of toxi-
city are not well established but this might suggest
that in humans the pharmacodynamic properties of
theobromine may be different from other mammals
[37]. It should be kept in mind that methylxan-
thines are metabolized in humans by demethylation
by the enzyme superfamily cytochrome P450, espe-
cially its member CYP1A2 which is responsible for
more than 95% of the primary metabolism of caf-
feine [43]. Whereas the trimethylxanthine caffeine is
metabolized to different compounds, including theo-
bromine, theobromine does not metabolize into other
dimethylxanthines (i.e., theophylline or paraxan-
thine), nor does it “upgrade” to the trimethylxanthine
caffeine. Because of this, the consumption of cocoa-
relatedproductsexposeshumansbothtotheobromine
from the demethylation of caffeine, in addition to the
direct ingestion of theobromine contained in these
products [33]. Remarkably, a recent study showed
a significant positive correlation between the con-
centrations of theobromine in the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) and in the plasma with the AD CSF biomarker
A�42, suggesting that theobromine is associated with
a healthier CSF biomarker profile and eventually may
have a protective effect against the development of
AD [44]. The observation that the protective effect
of chocolate consumption on cognitive decline was
observed only among subjects with low daily con-
sumption of caffeine may suggest that caffeine is not
the relevant component involved in this protective
effect. It is interesting that the protective effects of
caffeine on cognitive decline may be more consistent
in women [23, 35], but we did not observe any gen-
der differences regarding the association of chocolate
intake with a lower risk of cognitive decline. Alter-
natively, the potential protective effect could be due
to the caffeine present in chocolate, and this effect
would just be masked in the population consum-
ing higher amounts of caffeine from other sources.
In any case, the importance of the methylxanthines
in general for the beneficial long-term protective
effects of the regular consumption of coffee or choco-
late appears reinforced. This does not exclude that
other components of chocolate/cocoa, such as the
flavonoids, due to their antioxidant properties, could
 A. Moreira et al. / Chocolate Prevents Cognitive Decline
91
also be relevant for the beneficial long-term effects
of chocolate on cognitive decline.
Some limitations of this study must be pointed
out. The protective effect of chocolate consumption
on cognitive decline was driven by subjects with an
average weekly consumption of chocolate lower than
one standard portion. It is possible that the lack of
statistical significance for greater intakes was due
to the relatively small number of participants, and
a larger study would clarify the dose-effect rela-
tionship. Another issue is the insufficient detail of
the food questionnaire regarding the characteriza-
tion of the chocolate type, namely discriminating
whether it was milk of dark chocolate, as well as
limited published data regarding different types of
chocolate/cocoa foods and beverages, which lim-
its a more precise quantification of its components.
Finally, chocolate consumption may be related with
healthy and social lifestyles that contribute to the pro-
tective effects, or some medical conditions may be
overrepresented and negatively affect cognitive func-
tions [45], and therefore residual confounding may
have affected our estimates, despite several poten-
tially important confounding factors were taken into
account.
In conclusion, regular long-term consumption of
chocolate has protective effects on cognitive decline
inelderlypatients.Thespecificcomponentsofchoco-
late and the biological mechanisms involved should
be investigated in further studies. The possibility of
taking advantage of simple lifestyle and dietary inter-
ventions to attenuate cognitive decline in the elderly
is of great interest.
