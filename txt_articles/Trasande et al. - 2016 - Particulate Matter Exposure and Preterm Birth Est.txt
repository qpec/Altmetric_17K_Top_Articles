Introduction
Preterm birth (PTB), defined as birth at 
< 37 weeks gestation, remains a substantial 
cause of early-life morbidity in the United 
States. In 2010, 35% of all infant deaths 
were attributable to preterm-related causes, 
with considerable disparities in rates across 
sub 
populations (CDC 2014b). Preterm 
birth is recognized as a critical public health 
concern and, in addition, reflects persistent 
health disparities, being more prevalent 
among women of lower income status and 
from racial/ethnic minorities (Bryant et al. 
2010). Although the national PTB rate in 
the United States has declined from a peak 
of 12.8% in 2006 to 11.4% in 2013, the rate 
of decline is currently insufficient to meet 
the March of Dimes goal of 5.5% by 2030 
(McCabe et al. 2014). Reducing rates of PTB 
is important to prevent not only neonatal 
complications such as respiratory distress 
syndrome, sepsis, and intraventricular hemor-
rhage, but also adverse psychological, behav-
ioral, and educational outcomes in later life, 
mostly related to cerebral palsy and neuro-
developmental delay (Saigal and Doyle 2008). 
In addition, preterm babies are at higher risk 
of developing systemic hypertension, diabetes, 
and stroke later in life (Norman 2013).
Although PTB and the often associ-
ated low birth weight (LBW; < 2,500 g) 
are highly multifactorial (with risk factors 
including maternal age, prenatal care, race, 
socio 
economic status, and preeclampsia) 
(Woodruff et al. 2009), most of these risk 
factors are not amenable to modification or 
avoidance. However, environmental factors, 
such as outdoor air pollutants, are amenable 
to change, through reductions in vehicular 
emissions, filtration of emissions from coal-
fired power plants, and limits on residential 
use of coal and wood burning for heating and 
cooking (Trasande and Thurston 2005).
Though uncertainty remains about the 
contribution of specific outdoor air pollut-
ants and windows of vulnerability, multiple 
observational studies of prenatal exposure 
have associated particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm 
in diameter (PM2.5) among other pollutants 
with adverse birth outcomes, most especially 
LBW and PTB (Darrow et al. 2009; Kloog 
et al. 2012; Laurent et al. 2016), although 
some studies did not report this associa-
tion (Johnson et al. 2016). In addition, one 
quasi-experimental study identified reduc-
tions in PTB and LBW in association with 
electronic toll collection, which also reduced 
traffic congestion and vehicle emissions.
Further support for the notion that 
outdoor air pollution exposure may contribute 
to adverse birth outcomes is provided by labo-
ratory experiments that document oxidant 
stress, inflammation, and placental insuffi-
ciency as mechanisms by which air pollutants 
can contribute to early delivery (Institute of 
Medicine 2007; U.S. EPA 2013; Woodruff 
et al. 2009).
A major barrier to reductions in outdoor 
air pollution is the perception that these reduc-
tions will undermine economic productivity 
(Trasande et al. 2011). As with outdoor air 
pollution–associated respiratory illnesses, the 
costs associated with adverse birth outcomes 
are borne by society, rather than by those who 
gain from industrial processes that emit pollut-
ants. These include health care costs for treat-
ment of PTB-associated comorbidities and lost 
economic productivity due to PTB-associated 
reductions in cognitive potential. Yet, to our 
knowledge, estimates of the air pollution–
attributable burden of PTB and associated 
economic costs have not been made. Our 
primary objective was to provide an estimate 
of the economic costs associated with PTBs 
attributable to PM2.5 exposure (as a proxy for 
outdoor air pollution) in the United States—
estimates that could be used by decision 
makers when regulatory interventions to 
reduce air pollution exposures are considered.

Background: Preterm birth (PTB) rates (11.4% in 2013) in the United States remain high and 
are a substantial cause of morbidity. Studies of prenatal exposure have associated particulate matter 
≤ 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) and other ambient air pollutants with adverse birth outcomes; yet, 
to our knowledge, burden and costs of PM2.5-attributable PTB have not been estimated in the 
United States.
oBjectives: We aimed to estimate burden of PTB in the United States and economic costs 
 
attributable to PM2.5 exposure in 2010.
Methods: Annual deciles of PM2.5 were obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
We converted PTB odds ratio (OR), identified in a previous meta-analysis (1.15 per 10 μg/m3 
for our base case, 1.07–1.16 for low- and high-end scenarios) to relative risk (RRs), to obtain an 
estimate that better represents the true relative risk. A reference level (RL) of 8.8 μg/m3 was applied. 
We then used the RR estimates and county-level PTB prevalence to quantify PM2.5-attributable 
PTB. Direct medical costs were obtained from the 2007 Institute of Medicine report, and lost 
economic productivity (LEP) was estimated using a meta-analysis of PTB-associated IQ loss, and 
well-established relationships of IQ loss with LEP. All costs were calculated using 2010 dollars.
results: An estimated 3.32% of PTBs nationally (corresponding to 15,808 PTBs) in 2010 could 
be attributed to PM2.5 (PM2.5 > 8.8 μg/m3). Attributable PTBs cost were estimated at $5.09 billion 
[sensitivity analysis (SA): $2.43–9.66 B], of which $760 million were spent for medical care (SA: 
$362 M–1.44 B). The estimated PM2.5 attributable fraction (AF) of PTB was highest in urban 
counties, with highest AFs in the Ohio Valley and the southern United States.
conclusions: PM2.5 may contribute substantially to burden and costs of PTB in the United 
States, and considerable health and economic benefits could be achieved through environmental 
regulatory interventions that reduce PM2.5 exposure in pregnancy.

Methods
General Approach
Outdoor air pollution is a complex mixture 
including, most notably, PM2.5 and PM10 
(PM ≤ 10 μm), carbon monoxide, ozone, 
sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. 
Recognizing that each of these air pollutants 
may independently contribute and/or modify 
the effects of exposure at an individual level, 
we used PM2.5 as a proxy for outdoor air 
pollution exposure, permitting use of a richer 
array of available measurements.
In the present analysis we adhered to 
the approach developed by the Institute 
of Medicine in assessing the “fractional 
contribution” of the environment to causa-
tion of illness, which is adapted below 
(Institute of Medicine 1981):
Attributable Costs =   
 Anthropogenic increment in preterm birth  
 incidence  
× Births × Cost per preterm birth
Because wildfires, dust storms, and volcanoes 
contribute to outdoor air pollution, refer-
ence levels (RL) were applied. We adopted 
an RL of 8.8 μg/m3, and incorporated a 
scenario with a 5.8-μg/m3 threshold in 
sensitivity analyses. We chose this approach 
because this was the reference level applied 
for other health effects of PM2.5 in the 2010 
Global Burden of Disease estimates of PM2.5-
attributable disease burden (i.e., the assump-
tion was no health effects below this level) 
(Lim et al. 2012). Above the RL, all PM2.5 
was considered of anthropogenic origin, and 
an attributable fraction (AF) of 100% was 
applied against the increment in cases and 
social costs of PTBs that could specifically be 
attributed to PM2.5.
Though studies have examined asso-
ciations of outdoor air pollution with LBW 
(Woodruff et al. 2009), this association also 
presents additional complexity in attribution 
in that it has two major origins (PTB and 
intrauterine growth retardation, producing 
term LBW); therefore we limited our analysis 
to quantifying attributable PTB. In 2010, 
data from the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) suggested that almost 
124 million people in the United States lived 
in areas in which levels of some air pollut-
ants were higher than the limits set by the 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards 
(Thorne 2016). Specifically, for PM2.5, the 
current limit set by the National Ambient Air 
Quality Standards is 12.0 μg/m3. Here we 
estimate effects of prenatal PM2.5 exposure on 
PTB occurring in the same year. 
Subsequent sections describe approaches 
to estimating the PM2.5-attributable 
 
increment in PTB, the rate of  
prematurity, 
and costs.
PM2.5-Attributable Fraction of 
Prematurity
We obtained daily averages of PM2.5 in 2008 
for all ZIP codes in the conterminous United 
States as modeled by the EPA (U.S. EPA 
2014). Recognizing that many counties have 
multiple ZIP codes, and ZIP codes may cross 
county boundaries, we estimated daily average 
PM2.5 for each county by averaging across all 
ZIP codes that constitute a portion of a given 
county. We then estimated deciles of PM2.5 
exposure for each county in 2008. We assumed 
that births were evenly distributed over the 
course of the year, with 10% of births experi-
encing pregnancy-wide exposure to PM2.5 at 
the 90th percentile, and the next eight deciles 
of births exposed at the 80th, 70th, 60th, 
50th, 40th, 30th, 20th, and 10th percentiles of 
PM2.5. The last decile of births was assumed to 
have no exposure or attributable PTB, whereas 
the other groups were assumed to have levels 
corresponding to the lowest extreme (e.g., 10th 
percentile for all exposure in the 10th–19th 
percentile grouping).
The most recent meta-analysis of English-
language studies (Sapkota et al. 2012) esti-
mated an odds ratio (OR) for PTB of 1.15 
[95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14, 1.16] 
per 10 μg/m3 for pregnancy-wide exposure, 
and an OR of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.15) per 
10 μg/m3 for third-trimester exposure. In this 
meta-analysis, six studies contributed to the 
estimates for PM2.5 and PTB; only studies 
that examined PTB (< 37 weeks completed 
gestation) as the major end point and that 
reported results from single-pollutant models 
were included. Combined estimates of the 
OR were calculated based on data from all 
studies selected using fixed- and random-effects 
models; unlike for PM10, no significant hetero-
geneity was detected for studies that reported 
findings for PM2.5. Another recent study also 
identified an OR of 1.16 per 10 μg/m3 (see 
Figure S11 in Stieb et al. 2012) for the entire 
pregnancy (Stieb et al. 2012). We used the OR 
for pregnancy-wide exposure from the most 
recent meta-analysis (1.15 per 10 μg/m3) as the 
best estimate, but varied the OR from 1.07 to 
1.16 in subsequent sensitivity analyses.
For each decile of births within each 
county, the OR from the meta-analysis was 
applied as a base with the exponent corre-
sponding to the increment of the county-
specific average PM2.5 above the assumed RL 
(8.8 μg/m3). The calculation is also depicted 
in the following formula:
ORcounty-decile =  
 ORmeta-analysis(decile of county-averaged PM2.5 – RL)/10 μg/m3
Given that OR can overestimate relative 
risk (RR) and attributable fractions for 
common conditions such as PTB, we applied 
the formula described for estimating RR from 
OR and prevalence of PTB (Zhang and Yu 
1998). For this calculation, county-level PTB 
rates for 2010 were obtained from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
WONDER database (CDC 2014a). Below is 
a numeric example to illustrate how RR was 
derived for Autauga County, Alabama.
First, we calculated the corresponding 
OR for each decile of exposure above the 
lowest decile. For example, using an OR of 
1.15 (base case) for a 10-μg/m3 increase in 
PM2.5 and an RL of 8.8 μg/m3, the OR for 
the decile of births with the highest PM2.5 
exposure would be estimated as 
OR = 1.15 [(19.35 – 8.8)/10] = 1.16, 
where 19.35 μg/m3 is the PM2.5 concentra-
tion of the 90th percentile of the distribu-
tion for the county. Similarly, for the PM2.5 
concentration related to second lowest decile 
(20th) of average daily exposure for Autauga 
County (8.06 μg/m3), 
OR = 1.15 [(8.06 – 8.8)/10] = 1.00. 
Because this decile has PM2.5 concentra-
tion less than the RL, the corresponding 
estimated OR of 1 indicates no increase in 
risk and, therefore, the corresponding 
decile of births is assumed to have no PTBs 
 
attributable to PM2.5.
After deriving ORs for each decile, we 
use the formula by Zhang and Yu (1998) to 
estimate the RR for each decile, such that 
RR = 1.16/[(1 – 0.15) + (0.15 × 1.16)] = 1.13, 
where 0.15 is the PTB rate in that specific 
county. The range of RRs derived using 
these calculations was 1.06–1.18 (low–high 
scenarios).
Next, we computed the attributable 
fraction of PTB for outdoor air pollution for 
each decile, using the formula published by 
Levin (1953):
AFPM2.5, county-decile =  
 PrevalencePM2.5exposure × (RRcounty-decile – 1)/ 
 [1
 + PrevalencePM2.5exposure × (RRcounty-decile – 1)],
where the exposure prevalence is set to 10% 
for each decile. For example, for the highest 
decile of exposure in Autauga County, 
AF = [0.1 × (1.13 – 1)]/{1 + [0.1 × (1.13 – 1)]} 
= 0.013. Finally, we summed the AF for each 
decile (e.g., for Autauga County, the sum was 
0.04), and multiplied the resulting value by 
estimated number of preterm births for each 
county, as shown below:
Cases of preterm births attributable to 
PM2.5 = 0.04 × 99.6 = 3.96, where 99.6 is 
the estimated number of preterm births in 
Autauga County. When aggregating AFs for 
 Particulate matter exposure and preterm birth

each decile, a value of zero was assigned for 
AFs related to PM2.5 deciles below the RL 
(8.8 μg/m3), so that no cases of PTBs were 
attributed to those deciles of exposure.
Population at Risk
Births in each county were obtained from the 
CDC WONDER database, as were county-
level PTB rates (CDC 2014a), and multiplied 
together to calculate the number of preterm 
births in a county in 2010. For counties 
with population < 100,000, we estimated 
the number of births by taking the reported 
number of births across all these counties in 
each state and multiplying by the ratio of the 
county population to the total population of 
all counties with population < 100,000 from 
U.S. Census data (U.S. Census Bureau 2010). 
In addition, for these counties, the overall 
PTB rate of 0.15 was applied. The number 
of preterm births in each county was multi-
plied by the AF for each county to estimate 
the number of PM2.5-attributable premature 
births in 2010. Attributable PTBs in each 
county were aggregated to generate national 
estimates of attributable PTB.
Estimates of PM2.5-Attributable 
Social Costs
Two direct costs of PTB were estimated: 
costs for treatment of PTB-associated 
medical conditions in the first 5 years of life, 
and costs after the first 5 years of life due to 
PTB-associated developmental disability. The 
direct health care costs in the first 5 years of 
life (estimated at $31,920) were obtained 
from the Institute of Medicine (2007) report 
on premature birth. Costs were also updated 
to 2010 dollars using the Medical Care 
Consumer Price Index (U.S. Department 
of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics 2014), 
and discounted 5 years at 3%/year to account 
for the expenses’ occurrence in the future. 
A similar approach was taken with health 
care costs after the first 5 years of life due 
to PTB-associated developmental disability 
(estimated at $1,920), except they were 
discounted by 3% for 15 years due to their 
occurrence further in the future.
Lost economic productivity due to 
reduced cognitive potential was also measured 
as an indirect cost of PM2.5-attributable PTB. 
PTB-associated IQ loss was calculated, using 
data from a systematic review that estimates 
an 11.9-point IQ decrement on average in 
PTB children (95% CI: 10.5, 13.4) (Kerr-
Wilson et al. 2012). The loss in IQ was esti-
mated by multiplying attributable PTB by 
the 11.9 IQ decrement, and the lost lifetime 
economic productivity was estimated by 
multiplying the IQ loss by 2%, which corre-
sponds to the base case (range, 1.76–2.39%) 
described by Grosse et al. (2002), also used in 
previously published analyses (Trasande and 
Liu 2011), and the lifetime earnings estimate 
for a child born in 2010 (Max W, University 
of California, San Francisco; unpublished 
data, 2013). As with direct costs, all indirect 
costs are presented in 2010 dollars.
Sensitivity Analyses
Recognizing uncertainty in the exposure–
outcome relationship and RL, we performed 
sensitivity analyses. We used a range of ORs 
corresponding to different pregnancy-wide 
and third trimester–specific ORs (1.07–1.16) 
identified by the meta-analyses examining 
air pollution-PTB associations (Sapkota 
et al. 2012; Stieb et al. 2012) to represent 
sensitivity of the model to the nature of the 
exposure–outcome relationship. An alter-
native scenario with RL of 5.8 μg/m3 was 
also examined.
Results
We examined 3,963,694 live births in the 
48 contiguous United States, of which 
475,368 (12%) were preterm births 
(Table 1). Applying the base case OR of 1.15 
per 10-μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 and the 
reference level of 8.8 μg/m3, a median RR of 
1.0031 was identified (IQR = 1.000–1.045; 
minimum, 1.00, maximum, 1.35) with 
63.4% of births having RR > 1 (Table 2). We 
estimated that, across the 48 states, 3.32% of 
all preterm births in 2010 were attributable 
to PM2.5 (15,808; sensitivity analysis using 
ORs of 1.07 and 1.16: range, 7,532–29,968). 
These estimated numbers of attributable 
preterm births cost $760 million in medical 
care (sensitivity analysis: $362 million–1.44 
billion), and $4.33 billion (sensitivity 
analysis: $2.06–8.22 billion) in lost economic 
productivity was also identified (based on 
estimated reductions in IQ and estimated 
consequences for productivity over a lifetime). 
In total, we estimated that $5.09 billion in 
PTB-related costs (medical care costs and 
lost economic productivity combined) could 
be attributed to PM2.5, with the sensitivity 
analysis producing a range in those costs of 
$2.43–9.66 billion.
Substantial variability in estimated attrib-
utable fraction and preterm births was identi-
fied at the state level in base case analyses. In 
Ohio, the attributable fraction was highest 
(5.44%), whereas only 0.12% of preterm 
births were attributable to PM2.5 in New 
Mexico and Wyoming. California had the 
largest number of attributable preterm births 
(2,149) and costs ($692 million) in base case 
analyses (Table 3).
At the county level, the variability in 
attributable preterm births was greater than 
at the state level, as presented in Figure 1 
and detailed in Table 3, which indicates 
Table 1. Live births and preterm births in the 48 U.S. states examined.

a range of 0.12–5.44%. The PM2.5 AF of 
PTB was generally higher in major urban 
regions. Consistent with the state level 
results, the highest AFs (> 5%) were iden-
tified in the Ohio valley, the southern 
United States, southern California, south-
eastern Pennsylvania, New York City, and 
Chicago, Illinois.
Discussion
The main finding of this analysis suggests 
that exposure to PM2.5 contributes signifi-
cantly to preterm birth in the United States 
and translates into substantial economic loss 
over a lifetime. To our knowledge, this is the 
first time that such economic estimates are 
reported, and these suggest that considerable 
health and economic benefits can be gained 
through reductions in outdoor air pollution 
exposure in pregnancy.
Exposure to PM2.5 has been associated 
with PTB in a number of studies, although 
with variable results, as highlighted in 
the meta-analysis by Stieb et al. (2012). 
This meta-analysis included 62 studies 
and reported substantial heterogeneity 
among studies, as well as variability in risk 
by gestational period. Of note, one quasi- 
experimental (not observational) study 
identified reductions in PTB and LBW 
in association with electronic toll collec-
tion, which also reduced traffic congestion 
and vehicle emissions (Currie and Walker 
2011). Studies to date have applied different 
methodological approaches to exposure 
and outcome assessment, and have been 
conducted in many regions of the world 
where air pollution composition may vary, 
accounting for differential effects (Woodruff
 
et al. 2009). This is especially true for PM2.5, 
which is a complex mixture of different 
chemicals, and may contribute to explaining 
the variable results obtained in these studies, 
with different mixtures leading to different 
outcomes (Harris et al. 2014), also depending 
on specific windows of exposure (Rappazzo 
et al. 2014). In addition, differences in popu-
lation susceptibility most likely contribute to 
the observed variability.
We used 5.8–8.8 μg/m3 as reference levels, 
following the approach used by the 2010 
Global Burden of Disease collaborators (Lim 
et al. 2012). These levels can be considered 
minimum achievable levels of PM2.5 insofar 
as anthropogenic sources can be limited, and 
no safe level of PM2.5 exposure has been iden-
tified. The estimated 15,808 preterm births 
can be considered preventable through strate-
gies to reduce PM2.5 exposure, though future 
work can model reductions due to changes in 
vehicular and other emissions considering the 
impact of regulatory and other interventions 
as counterfactuals, so as to inform cost–benefit 
and other regulatory impact analyses. 
In our analysis we estimated loss of IQ 
related to preterm birth and its impact on 
earning potential, which can be considered 
the result of direct effects, such as lower 
cognitive capacities, and indirect effects due 
to diminished educational achievements and 
reduced ability to work (Grosse et al. 2002). 
Estimating and aggregating at the national 
level the economic costs associated with 
PM2.5-attributable preterm births provide a 
sense of the potential economic benefits that 
could be achieved by regulatory interventions 
aimed at reducing air pollution exposure 
during pregnancy. In addition, long-term 
health issues associated with preterm birth 
that prevent individuals from working trans-
lates into increased government expenditures 
for programs such as Supplemental Security 
Income, further adding to the economic 
costs shouldered by society as a whole (Perrin

et al. 2007). Last but not least, it is important 
to consider that PTB also places an impor-
tant emotional and psychological burden 
on parents and families, which, although 
nonfinancial, needs to be taken into account 
when considering the benefits that could be 
achieved by such regulatory interventions.
Limitations
There are important limitations to the 
interpretation of our findings. The specific 
components of outdoor air pollution that 
contribute to prematurity and other adverse 
birth outcomes remain elusive, as do the 
mechanisms by which they produce effects. 
Although it is true that some studies to date 
have failed to find significant associations with 
adverse outcomes, exposure imprecision may 
have biased those estimates (Fleiss and Shrout 
1977); others may have had modest statis-
tical power to detect significant differences in 
prematurity. Therefore, some may argue that 
the scientific evidence for air pollution has not 
reached the threshold for causation. We take 
heed of Sir Austin Bradford Hill’s landmark 
treatise on criteria for causation, in which 
he raises the need to consider the decision at 
hand in weighing the strength of the scientific 
evidence: “On fair evidence we might take 
action on what appears to be an occupational 
hazard…without too much injustice if we 
are wrong” (Hill 1965). More recently, we 
have developed methods to estimate prob-
ability of causation for diseases attributable 
to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (Trasande 
et al. 2015). Although the scope of the present 
analysis was limited and we did not formally 
evaluate the epidemiologic and toxicologic 
evidence, the evidence for air pollution and 
its effects on fetal growth are of similar 
strength to many of the exposure–outcome 
relationships considered in this more recent 
work. The evidence for causation of preterm 
births by outdoor air pollutants is strong, 
although not uniform, in that multiple obser-
vational studies have identified significant rela-
tionships, as evidenced by some of the most 
recent meta-analyses (Sapkota et al. 2012; 
Stieb et al. 2012). Though studies have not 
always yielded identical results, the findings in 
humans are consistent with those in the labo-
ratory. These support the estimation of disease 
burden and costs as presented here, though 
we have not estimated a probability of causa-
tion as others have pursued in the presence of 
uncertainty (Trasande et al. 2015).
Models are also only as good as their 
inputs. Stationary-monitor sites do not take 
into account variation in personal exposure 
levels, variations in PM2.5 levels within the 
geographical area monitored by each site, or 
changes in residence during pregnancy. Data 
for ultrafine PM were not available, even 
though this form may pose a greater risk of 
adverse birth outcomes than PM2.5. PM2.5 
measurements were estimated at the county 
level, and insofar as pregnancies are not 
evenly distributed by outdoor air pollution, 
our approach introduces some imprecision. 
We also estimated attributable PTB assuming 
homogeneity in the PTB rate across small 
population counties, which may have added 
imprecision in county-level estimates. We 
did not consider effects on maternal health, 
or possible stillbirths and birth defects that 
are plausible although less supported by the 
literature (Woodruff et al. 2009).
Air pollution exposures over the period 
January–December 2008 can be expected 
to influence a broad period of pregnancies 
spanning at least 9 months later, with birth 
dates spanning September 2008–August 2009 
and most births in 2009. We acknowledge 
some imprecision in selecting the 2010 birth 
year to extrapolate disease burden. In part, the 
intention was to bring estimates in line with 
other environmentally related disease burden 
estimates that use 2010 as a base (Trasande 
et al. 2015), and ensure comparability. Our 
decision was supported by the relative lack 
of changes in mean PM2.5 between 2009 and 
2010 (Thorne 2016).
We also examined PTB as a categorical 
outcome, when shifts in gestational age are 
more likely to occur due to PM2.5. Insofar as 
gestational age is not normally distributed, 
estimated PM2.5-induced shifts in gestational 
age may potentially result in larger effects 
on PTB than the estimates we modeled 
here. PTB data from CDC are also based 
on last menstrual period, when the defini-
tion is changing to clinically based obstetric 
estimates. A substantial literature suggests 
misclassification in both directions, with 
generally estimates based on last menstrual 
period producing higher PTB rates (Hall 
et al. 2014; Qin et al. 2007), so our meth-
odology may have produced modestly higher 
estimates than those obtained using clinically 
derived PTB data.
Conclusions
Our estimates suggest that PM2.5 may 
contribute substantially to the burden and 
costs of PTB in the United States. Because 
of the widespread exposure to PM2.5, consid-
erable health and economic benefits could 
be achieved through regulatory interventions 
that reduce such exposure in pregnancy. 
Furthermore, the differential impact of air 
pollution by socioeconomic status and race/
ethnicity, as suggested by Bryant et al. (2010), 
underscores the importance of regulatory 
actions aimed at reducing exposure, because 
these may also reduce the well-known and 
long-standing disparities in preterm births.

Figure 1. Fraction of preterm birth attributable to air pollution, county-level data. 
Births in each county were obtained from the CDC WONDER database (CDC 2014a), as were county-level PTB rates, and 
multiplied together to calculate the number of preterm births in a county in 2010. For counties with population < 100,000, 
the overall rate (0.15) for those counties was applied. The number of preterm births in each county was multiplied by the 
AF for each county to estimate the number of PM2.5-attributable premature births in 2010. Source for PM2.5 data: U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA 2008).
