Opioid prescribing decreases after
learning of a patient’s fatal overdose

Most opioid prescription deaths occur among people with common conditions for which
prescribing risks outweigh benefits. General psychological insights offer an explanation:
People may judge risk to be low without available personal experiences, may be less
careful than expected when not observed, and may falter without an injunction from
authority. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a randomized trial of 861 clinicians
prescribing to 170 persons who subsequently suffered fatal overdoses. Clinicians in the
intervention group received notification of their patients’ deaths and a safe prescribing
injunction from their county’s medical examiner, whereas physicians in the control group
did not. Milligram morphine equivalents in prescriptions filled by patients of letter
recipients versus controls decreased by 9.7% (95% confidence interval: 6.2 to 13.2%;
P < 0.001) over 3 months after intervention. We also observed both fewer opioid initiates
and fewer high-dose opioid prescriptions by letter recipients.
T
he United States is in the grips of its worst
drug crisis in history, driven by twin epi-
demics of illicit and prescription opioid
use. Opioid overdoses resulted in 351,630
deaths from 1999 to 2016, with deaths in-
creasing from 2015 to 2016 for both illicit and
prescription opioid users (1). In addition, more
than 1.9 million Americans suffer from opioid
addiction (2). Before the introduction of extended-
release and long-acting opioids in the 1990s,
long-term, high-dose opioid therapy was rare.
The use of these drugs for cancer pain led to
calls to address chronic noncancer pain with
the same agents. Opioid proponents discounted
historical evidence for opioid harms by frequently
citing studies on small convenience samples (3, 4).
For example, there were more than 600 citations
of a five-sentence letter to the editor published
in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1980
titled “Addiction rare in patients treated with
narcotics” (3), most in support of opioid safety
(5). These and other factors may have encour-
aged unwarranted opioid prescribing.
In this randomized experiment, we aimed to
counter factors that may promote high levels of
opioid prescribing. We evaluated the effect of
a personal letter from the medical examiner
notifying clinicians of a controlled substance
overdose drug death in their practice and re-
iterating guidelines for safe prescribing. We
intervened on clinicians and allied health pro-
fessionals with scheduled drug prescribing
privileges in California. These individuals had
prescribed a schedule II, III, or IV drug to a
person who died as a result of a schedule II, III,
or IV accidental overdose between the period
of 1 July 2015 and 30 June 2016 in San Diego
County. Prescriptions had to have been filled
less than 12 months before the decedent’s day
of death.
Our study was a decedent-cluster randomized
trial, in which clusters of individuals, rather than
single persons, are randomly allocated to inter-
vention groups. A decedent cluster is a distinct
set of clinicians who wrote scheduled drug pre-
scriptions to a person who suffered a fatal
scheduled drug overdose. Decedent clusters were
randomly assigned to either a control condition
or a group receiving a letter signed by the Chief
Deputy Medical Examiner of San Diego County
(see supplementary text S1) that notified them of
a death in their practice. The letter identified the
decedent by name, address, and age; outlined the
annual number and types of prescription drug
deaths seen by the medical examiner; discussed
the value of and way to access the state’s pre-
scription drug monitoring program; and dis-
cussed five U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) guideline–recommended
safe prescribing strategies.
We abstracted data from the Controlled Sub-
stance Utilization Review and Evaluation System
(CURES). This database provided a comprehen-
sive record of opioids dispensed at California
pharmacies to civilian, non–U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs, and non-institutionalized
patients treated by clinicians in our sample. De-
scriptive and inferential statistics were carried
out with the Stata software (6). The cmp com-
mand in Stata was used to compute a difference-
in-differences estimator within a mixed-model
two-part linear regression analysis (7). The
difference-in-differences estimator compared the
average change over time in milligram morphine
equivalents (MMEs) dispensed for prescribers in
the intervention group with the average change
over time for prescribers in the control group.
The natural log transformation of MMEs en-
sured a normal distribution of data. A two-part
regression model has a discrete component and
a continuous component: A binary event identi-
fying whether there are opioid fill(s) in a pre-
scriber’s name each day represents the discrete
part of the model, and the natural log of MMEs
dispensed on days when opioids are filled in the
name of a prescriber represents the continuous
part. We also evaluated high-dosage prescriptions
(≥50 or >90 MMEs per day) and the probability
that a prescription fill was a “new start” (a new
person entering the database).
Sample size calculations, described in the sup-
plementary materials, indicate that we would
need 65 decedents per study arm to have an
80% chance to detect an effect. This analysis
assumes a 5% difference in daily MME prescrib-
ing between groups. Figure S1 illustrates the
study timeline. Figure 1 describes the flow of
decedent and prescriber identification, inter-
vention allocation, follow-up, and data analysis.
The medical examiner investigated 220 deaths
in San Diego County between 1 July 2015 and
30 June 2016 for which a schedule II, III, or IV
prescription drug was the primary or contribut-
ing cause of death. Of this group, 170 decedents
(77.3%) had one or more prescriptions found in
CURES 12 months before their death. Table S1
presents observed frequencies within random-
ization strata variables (cause of death and
whether decedents received prescriptions from
a clinician with multiple deaths), and Table 1
displays decedent characteristics. There were
861 prescribers to the 170 decedents whose
deaths were caused by overdoses of schedule II,
III, or IV drugs. Of these, 725 had prescribed
to only one decedent, and 136 had prescribed
to multiple decedents. There were, on aver-
age, 5.5 (±5.4) prescribers per decedent and
1.2 (±0.6) decedents per prescriber (numbers in
parentheses indicate standard deviations). Sam-
ple characteristics of clinicians are presented in
Table 2.
We observed 1,279,691 prescriptions filled
during the study period. Using the dates of
prescriptions dispensed, we computed daily
MMEs for prescribers. Table 3 shows the aver-
age daily MMEs dispensed per prescriber in
each of intervention and control groups 3 months
before and 1 to 4 months after letters were sent.
In the control group, opioid prescribing increased
from 71.6 MMEs daily before intervention to
71.7 MMEs daily after intervention [i.e., +0.1 MME;
95% confidence interval (CI): −2.8 to 3.2 MMEs],
whereas intervention group prescribing decreased
from 72.5 to 65.7 MMEs (−6.8 MMEs; 95% CI:
−9.9 to −3.8 MMEs) per prescriber per day.
MMEs prescribed by clinicians in the interven-
tion group decreased by 9.7% (95% CI: 6.2 to
13.2%) compared with control-prescribed MMEs
over a period beginning 1 month and ending
4 months after the day the letters were mailed
(P < 0.001). Letter recipients were 7% (95% CI:
2 to 11%) less likely than control prescribers to
start a new patient on opioids (P < 0.01). We also

 observed a significant reduction in high-dose pre-
scribing in the intervention group compared with
the control group: a 3% decrease for 50 MME
daily doses (P < 0.05) and a 4.5% decrease for
90 MME daily doses (P < 0.05) dispensed. There
was no difference in the proportion of prescrib-
ers in the intervention or control group who
made substantial (>20%) reductions in opioid
prescribing in the postintervention period (z =
1.279, P > 0.05). Sensitivity analysis that trans-
formed MMEs ensured normality, and a lag-
correlation analysis to ensure independence of
errors had no effect on results (fig. S2).
A simple letter, supportive in tone, to inform
clinicians of a scheduled drug harm to their
patient resulted in fewer subsequent opioids
dispensed by those clinicians. Thus far, tradi-
tional state regulatory approaches to limiting
opioid prescribing have not achieved great suc-
cess. For example, Meara and colleagues found
that adoption of controlled substance laws at
the state level was not associated with reduc-
tions in potentially hazardous use of opioids or
overdose among disabled Medicare beneficia-
ries (8). Another effort to send letters to poten-
tial high prescribers of controlled substances
(individual health care clinicians who were at
the 99.7th percentile of prescribing volume
among prescribers of schedule II drugs in
Medicare Part D) found no effect (9). In com-
parison, the success of the approach used in
our study—notifying clinicians of a single fatal
overdose—may have a number of explanations.
First, people rely upon knowledge that is impact-
ful, recent, and easy to retrieve from memory
when judging probabilities and making deci-
sions (10, 11). Decisions to avoid harms could
occur more frequently after receipt of the letter,
because the effects of opioid harms are available
to memory. Second, clinicians are also dispro-
portionately exposed to patients who return to
their clinics uneventfully for an opioid refill.
The letter may alert clinicians to those patients
who do not return, owing to death via an over-
dose. Third, individual behavior improves when
outside persons attend to it (12). Clinicians may
prescribe with greater care when they perceive
that they are being watched, particularly by
figures of authority (13). A message commu-
nicating a patient’s overdose death from the
medical examiner may have particular weight.
Such information appears to encourage more
cautious prescribing without restricting clini-
cian freedom to prescribe opioids through
mandated prescribing limits. Mandated lim-
its do not account for individual patient cir-
cumstances that may arise in the course of
care. We observed modest prescribing reduc-
tions, which suggest that clinicians exercised
greater caution with opioids rather than aban-
doning use.
Brief exposuretoopioids inopioid-naive persons
makes long-term opioid use more likely (14, 15),
and excess prescription opioids (in medicine cab-
inets or diverted) are a source of misuse and are
linked to transition to heroin (16, 17). Correcting
course in prescribing after learning of a patient’s
death from a prescription overdose may lessen
the effect of the aforementioned harms.
Although the generalizability of these find-
ings may be limited, San Diego County is a diverse
county with a broad representation of providers
and which constitutes ~1% of the U.S. popula-
tion. The control condition involved no increased
awareness of opioids or education; however, our
study occurred 5 months after the U.S. Surgeon
General issued CDC guideline pocket cards to

 all U.S. clinicians, including those in our con-
trol arm. We do not address appropriate or in-
appropriate prescribing at the patient level.
Judicious prescribing represents only one of
the components necessary to correct the missteps
caused by overly enthusiastic use of opioids to
alleviate pain. Access to medication-assisted ther-
apy, counseling, and naloxone for resuscitation
after overdose and efforts to address social de-
terminants responsible for increased opioid use
all play equally important roles in ending the
crisis.
The intervention described here is scalable.
Each county in the United States reports pre-
scription opioid deaths to the National Center
for Health Statistics, and each state maintains
a vital records death file. Each state contains a
prescription drug monitoring program that tracks
prescriptions to decedents. It is thus feasible to
“close the loop” on deaths by encouraging safe
prescribing habits through the use of behav-
ioral insights.
