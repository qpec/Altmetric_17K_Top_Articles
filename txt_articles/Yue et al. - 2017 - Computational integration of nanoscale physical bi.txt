With the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), significant efforts have been directed toward developing
novel diagnostics and biomarkers that can enhance AD detection and management. AD affects the cognition,
behavior, function, and physiology of patients through mechanisms that are still being elucidated. Current AD
diagnosis is contingent on evaluating which symptoms and signs a patient does or does not display. Concerns
have been raised that AD diagnosis may be affected by how those measurements are analyzed. Unbiased means
of diagnosing AD using computational algorithms that integrate multidisciplinary inputs, ranging from nanoscale
biomarkers to cognitive assessments, and integrating both biochemical and physical changes may provide solu-
tions to these limitations due to lack of understanding for the dynamic progress of the disease coupled with multiple
symptoms in multiscale. We show that nanoscale physical properties of protein aggregates from the cerebral
spinal fluid and blood of patients are altered during AD pathogenesis and that these properties can be used as
a new class of “physical biomarkers.” Using a computational algorithm, developed to integrate these biomarkers
and cognitive assessments, we demonstrate an approach to impartially diagnose AD and predict its progression.
Real-time diagnostic updates of progression could be made on the basis of the changes in the physical biomarkers
and the cognitive assessment scores of patients over time. Additionally, the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem
was used to determine the minimum number of necessary patient checkups to effectively predict disease pro-
gression. This integrated computational approach can generate patient-specific, personalized signatures for AD
diagnosis and prognosis.
INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder
that results in the gradual deterioration of specific brain regions that
hinders the person’s ability to think, recall memories, learn, and per-
form daily tasks (1). Unknown mechanisms that promote and drive
AD pathogenesis have likely resulted in the death of effective treatments.
The increasing prevalence of AD has become a global concern (2). Cur-
rently, AD is diagnosed using the “evaluate and eliminate” approach (3).
With this strategy, patient history, physical exams, laboratory tests,
imaging scans, and neurophysiological assessments are examined by
doctors as a means to diagnose AD and determine its progression (4).
This can be problematic though, because most symptoms of AD are
only identifiable once the disease has significantly progressed (5). Thus,
to improve disease diagnosis, means for early detection are needed.
Proteins like amyloid-b (Ab) and tau (6–10) are some of the most
well-studied biomarkers to clinically diagnose and monitor AD (11), be-
cause their morphological aggregation (12–15), oligomerization (16),
and fibrillization (17) are closely related to disease progression. How-
ever, despite their utility, these biomarkers have time, financial, and de-
tection limitations(18). Cognitive assessmentsare also usedfor early AD
diagnosis, because cognitive impairments precede the loss of functional
impairments (19). Commonly used assessments, including the Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE) (20), can provide brief screening
tests that quantitatively assess the severity of cognitive impairment and
document cognitive changes occurring over time (21). However, they
have sensitivity limitations due to their reliance on conditional factors,
such as patient perceptions, education levels, test familiarizations, re-
sponses, and performance (22). Although diagnostic approaches that
focus solely on biochemical analysis and brain imaging (23) play a role
as important complementary tools for cogitative assessments, they do
notcomprehensively capture thecomplex nature of macro-to nanolevel
changes that occur during disease progression (12–15).
Currently, physical properties such as cell stiffness (Young’s modulus)
are being used in oncological research to distinguish malignant cancer
cells from benign cells (24–26). Studies have also been conducted with
peptide self-assembly that relate structures to molecular activities and
mechanical properties (27). Because pathological protein components
inside the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and blood undergo macro- to
nanolevel physical changes that promote physiological changes, such
as the formation of protein aggregates that reflect disease advance-
ment (28), these components and their physical changes during the
aggregation may be detectable through nanoscale characterization and
may have the potential to be used as a new class of “physical bio-
markers” for AD diagnosis. This may provide a potential measure
to determine how alterations to the nanomechanics and nanomorphol-
ogy of proteins in patients’ CSF and blood reflect and affect AD onset
and pathogenesis.

 However, the current evaluate-and-eliminate approach fails to suf-
ficiently assess the combined effects of each measurement, which makes
it difficult to develop new therapies or early diagnostics (29–31). Ac-
cordingly, there is immense promise in developing unbiased technol-
ogies that can computationally integrate cognitive assessments and
additional biomarkers to diagnose AD, monitor its progression, and
provide preventative recommendations. Considering that (i) the effects
of widespread alterations that occur during AD pathogenesis are exten-
sive and benefit from being analyzed using a combination of parameters
including cognitive assessments and physical changes of protein bio-
markers and that (ii) analyzing all the data at once would better rep-
resent a patient’s disease state, we hypothesized that computation
integration of behavior-based cognitive assessments and protein
physical biomarkers would lead to a more effective method to com-
prehensively diagnose and predict the course of an individual’s AD.
To achieve the above goal, a Kalman filter (KF)–based computational
algorithm was used. The KF is a recursive algorithm that has superior
capabilities for predicting dynamic processes because it integrates mul-
tiple measurements and predictions to form optimal estimates (32, 33).
Unlike the evaluate-and-eliminate approach, we acknowledge that mea-
surements from different types of complementary assessments need to
be computationally integrated and analyzed concurrently to best reflect
the nano to systemic effects of AD (Fig. 1).
In this research, we first used a KF-based algorithm to process con-
ventional cognitive assessment scores to diagnose disease states. The
smoother prediction using KF allows a better analysis of the AD pro-
gression by following a consistent trend (fig. S1). This could exclude the
diagnosis errors due to variations of doctors’ diagnosis and inconsistent
fluctuations of the AD patients during cognitive assessment. These
results show the promising potentials of the KF algorithm in AD diag-
nosis and prognosis.
Next, physical biomarkers were collected from CSF and blood
(serum) samples for the AD status characterization in the nanoscale
(“Nanoscale characterization” section). To ensure the effectiveness of
the nanoscale biomarkers, we collected CSF and serum samples from
both AD patients and healthy subjects as controls. The CSF and serum
have differential Ab concentrations, with the serum having a low
abundance and the CSF having a relatively high abundance. As a re-
sult, we developed different characterization approaches to obtain
nanoscale physical properties from each sample type. In the CSF
samples, protein aggregates were collected, and their material and
morphological properties were measured using atomic force micros-
copy (AFM) and a high-contract microparticle imaging (HMI) sys-
tem. For the serum samples, functionalized AFM tips (34, 35) were
usedto detect Ab components and measure theirforce interactionswith
other proteins. Synthesized Ab was also used to determine whether
freeze-thaw cycles would affect protein particle aggregation, inde-
pendent of native Ab isolation centrifugation (fig. S2).
Finally, we integrated multiple physical properties of the CSF and
serum protein components into the KF-based algorithm for AD diag-
nosis(“Computationalintegration”section).Wedevelopedan unbiased
approach to diagnose AD and predict its progression by integrating
the cognitive assessment scores and physical biomarkers, which are
the nanoscale physical properties of protein aggregates from patients.
Patient-specific signatures for AD diagnosis and prognosis were gen-
erated through this integrated computational approach (Fig. 1).
RESULTS
Nanoscale characterization
Nanomechanical and morphological characterizations of CSF
protein components provide a new class of physical
biomarkers for AD diagnosis
To date, few studies have been performed for investigating the nanome-
chanical properties of proteins implicated in AD (27, 36, 37). This is
most likely due to challenges associated with quantitatively characteriz-
ing 1000+ CSF proteins (38) and then subsequently associating their
physical characteristics with AD pathogenesis. We first evaluated the
existence, abundance, and localization of the AD hallmarks: Ab and tau
in the CSF’s protein components (figs. S3 and S4). Then, we used an
AFM-based nanoindentation to determine whether the elastic modulus
(Young’smodulus,therelationshipbetweenstressandstraininamaterial)
of CSF protein components was altered at different stages of diseasepro-
gression. Topographic mappings (Fig. 2B) were performed on all samples
and allowed us to calculate Young’s modulus mappings (Fig. 2A); these
values were associated with quantitative differences among different
groups. On average, Young’s modulus mapping revealed that healthy
protein samples were less stiff than diseased ones [analysis of variance
(ANOVA), mean ± SD; healthy, 63.542 ± 30.17 MPa; mild AD, 97.38 ±
47.37 MPa, P < 0.01; moderate AD, 127.0 ± 53.4 MPa, P < 0.001; severe
AD, 138.3 ± 66.69 MPa, P < 0.001; Fig. 2A]. However, comparison be-
tween the three disease states showed no significant differences, because

 theaverageYoung’smoduluswascalculatedonthe basisofawholemap-
pingregion,includingtheproteinaggregatesandtheareaswithoutaggre-
gates, which were called irrelevant areas that were rigid and affected
our ability to distinguish the differences between different disease states.
We examined the plausibility of this limitation and found that diseased
samples had more aggregates and irrelevant areas. To more accurately
characterize the aggregates’ nanomechanics, we removed the irrelevant
areas in our analysis and focused on calculating the Young’s modulus of
protein aggregates (particles). In this analysis, aggregates were identified
from the topographic images (Fig. 2B) as high points, and their cor-
responding positions on the Young’s modulus mappings were extrapo-
lated to determine the particles’ stiffness (Young’s modulus). The protein
aggregatesand particlesof healthy subjectswere lessstiffthan those with
AD (ANOVA, mean ± SD; healthy, 11.78 ± 11.54 MPa; mild AD, 24.21 ±
16.86 MPa, P < 0.01; moderate AD, 37.38 ± 16.5 MPa, P < 0.001; severe
AD, 54.09 ± 23.41 MPa, P < 0.001; Fig. 2C). A significant increase in stiff-
ness was observed from healthy to mild AD and from mild AD to severe
AD. These observed increases in Young’s modulus during disease pro-
gression could have resulted from alterations in the mechanical proper-
ties of Ab(1–42) or tau aggregates and may be correlated with changes
in their molecular structures. This would be in line with former studies
showing that during Ab(1–42) aggregations, the protein transforms
from an oligomer to a mature fibril (39), consequently altering its inter-
nal structure and mechanical properties as the disease progresses (27).
Furthermore, these results indicated that the nanomechanics of CSF
protein components could be correlated with AD disease stages. As
AD pathogenesis increased, so did aggregate stiffness. This finding
is in support of our hypothesis that these properties can be used as
physical biomarkers for AD diagnostics.
We then asked whether AD pathogenesis resulted in alterations to
the nanomorphology of those particles and whether those alterations
could serve as additional physical biomarkers. To answer these questions,
we determined differences in the physical properties of patients’ CSF
protein components using HMI, which allowed us to characterize the
particle concentration and distribution of the CSF components. In
healthy subjects, minimal aggregates and a uniform particle distribu-
tion were observed; however, disease progression was accompanied by
detection of more aggregates and larger particles (Fig. 2D). Particle
concentration, but not the size (fig. S6), was significantly greater in
moderate and severe AD compared to controls (ANOVA, mean ± SD;
healthy particles, 110.6 ± 39.22; mild AD particles, 132.9 ± 60.44, P <
0.001; moderate AD particles, 157.1 ± 93.83, P < 0.001; severe AD par-
ticles, 303.3 ± 146.5, P < 0.001; Fig. 2F). Differences among mild AD,
moderate AD, and healthy cases were not observed. This could have
been due to the pathological status within the brain, which undergoes
increased rates of altered pathology as disease severity increases. From
the nanomorphological data, we determined that CSF particle concen-
tration had applicability as a physical AD biomarker.
Additional nanoscale imaging was performed using AFM to enhance
detection of the nanomorphology of protein aggregates. In the AFM
images, particles were represented as white spots, and the gray-scaled
image pixels served as individual measurements to determine the par-
ticle height (Fig. 2E). These images revealed clear differences and showed
that moderate and severe AD cases had the highest prevalence of large
aggregates. Height characterization of individual particles within the
CSF showed that the particle height gradually increased as the severity
of the disease progressed (ANOVA, mean ± SD; healthy particle height,
20.72 ± 7.06 nm; mild AD, 36.77 ± 8.97 nm, P < 0.001; moderate AD,
51.53 ± 11.40 nm, P < 0.001; severe AD, 69.69 ± 12.99 nm, P < 0.001;
Fig. 2G). This finding was consistent with those from the earlier HMI
and nanomechanical experiments showing that structural changes
occurred in the protein components as disease severity increased and
thus proving to have the capability of being physical AD biomarkers.
Nanocharacterization of serum protein components enriches
the physical biomarkers from the force perspective
Functionalized AFM tips were used to determine how nanoforce mea-
surements of protein aggregates in serum are associated with disease
progression. As shown in Fig. 3A, when the functionalized AFM tip
was bound with Ab(1–42), changes in tip thermal frequency occurred.
As binding increased, larger changes in thermal frequency resulted.
On the basis of the level of the changes, we determined the relative
amount of Ab(1–42) that was associated with different AD stages.
Ab(1–42) amounts decreased with increasing disease progression
(ANOVA, mean ± SD; healthy, 5.9 ± 1.44; mild AD, 3.72 ± 0.59, P <
0.001; moderate AD, 2.69 ± 0.56, P < 0.001; severe AD, 2.51 ± 0.72, P <
0.001; Fig. 3B).
Serum and anti–Ab(1–42) antibody interactions were then charac-
terized. Using a serum-coated substrate and a functionalized AFM tip,
differences in binding between the serum proteins from different stages
ofADandtheanti–Ab(1–42)–coatedtipweremeasured(Fig.3C).Serum
samples with more Ab(1–42) resulted in more binding sites and thus
greater serum and anti–Ab(1–42) antibody interactions. As AD status
progressed, a decreasing serum and anti–Ab(1–42) antibody interac-
tion was observed (ANOVA, mean ± SD; healthy, 6.11 ± 1.33 nN; mild
AD, 4.82 ± 0.68 nN, P < 0.001; moderate AD, 3.33 ± 0.5 nN, P < 0.001;
severe AD, 3.06 ± 0.6 nN, P < 0.001; Fig. 3D). This result was con-
sistent with conventional approaches demonstrating that blood Ab
deceases along with disease progression (40).
We hypothesized that the Ab-embedded proteins of AD patients
had differential aggregations and fibrillization capabilities compared
to those of healthy people (41). To test this hypothesis, a substrate
coated with anti-Ab antibody was used to measure the binding force
between the Ab aggregates and the anti-Ab antibody. Here, an AFM
tip was bound with Ab aggregates (as in Fig. 3A); then, the tip was
moved to make contact with the substrate so that additional binding
between the Ab aggregates and the substrate could be generated. The
tip was then lifted to break the binding, and the binding force was
measured (Fig. 3E). It was observed that the binding force had a grad-
ual increase with disease progression (ANOVA, mean ± SD; healthy,
3.48 ± 0.59 nN; mild AD, 3.68 ± 0.62 nN, not significant (NS); mod-
erate AD, 4.2 ± 1.38 nN, P < 0.05; severe AD, 6.95 ± 1.37 nN, P < 0.001;
Fig. 3F). Furthermore, single molecule force was extracted from the
force curves. The plateau-shaped regions showing a constant force
that is independent of the extension length in the retract force curves
represented the molecule force between Ab aggregates and anti-Ab
antibody (Fig. 3G), in which an increase was found (ANOVA, mean ±
SD; healthy, 56.1 ± 15.1 pN; mild AD, 67.7 ± 17.8 pN, NS; moderate
AD, 74.9 ± 16.5 nN, P < 0.01; severe AD, 82.8 ± 14.5 pN, P < 0.001;
Fig. 3H). Because different fibrillization may result in various neuro-
toxicities (41, 42), this trend may reflect the increasing fibrillization
capability of the pathological Ab components during different dis-
ease stages.

 integrated these variables with cognitive assessments as inputs for a
computational algorithm to quantitatively diagnose and predict
AD progression of individual patients (Fig. 4A). AD stages that were
characterized by ordinal variables ranging from 1 to 4, representing
increasing severity of disease, were included for the disease progres-
sion. Decimal numbers, such as 1.8, could be used to represent disease
progression.
Computational algorithm. The KF predicts dynamic states by
making estimates based on an initial state, and then updating its es-
timates when new measurements are acquired. To do this, the KF has
two stages: (i) a “prediction stage,” which generates an a priori estimate
about a patient’s disease state from inputted measurements, and (ii)
an “update stage,” which readjusts the prediction based on follow-up
measurements. In our algorithm, both stages included cognitive assess-
ment scores and nanoscale characterizations of the proteins from pa-
tients with varying degrees of AD.
Capability for analysis. The KF-based algorithm was trained to
generate personalized predictions as a way to make an accurate prog-
nosis that reflects each individual patient’s dynamic disease state. Three
types of analysis were performed for individual patients: current AD
status, rate of AD progression, and optimal checkup frequency. The
approach used for modeling and training of the KF-based software

and prognosis
To achieve a robust prognosis, we investigated which of our measure-
ments were more closely correlated with AD status. For this purpose, a
correlation matrix (in terms of AD status) was derived from patient data
to rank the parameters obtained from nanoscale physical biomarkers.
Two sets of parameters, including a CSF parameter set (particle concen-
tration, length of aggregates, particle height, and particles’ Young’s
modulus) and a serum parameter set (tip thermal frequency changes,
serum and anti-Ab antibody interaction, binding force, and molecule
force), were investigated.
We obtained correlation coefficients (r) for eight parameters: par-
ticle concentration, r = 0.81; length of aggregates, r = 0.86; particle

Fig. 4. AD diagnosis using a KF-based algorithm. (A) Flowchart of the computational integration of physical biomarkers and cognitive assessments for AD diagnosis
and prediction. Nanoscale measurements of CSF and serum samples from a new patient were fused with those measurements of the subjects with known AD stages.
Then, the fused data were used to train the KF model. Diagnosis, progression prediction, and optimal checkup frequency were ultimately obtained. (B) Diagnosis of AD
stages based on various combinations of physical parameters was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy. The accumulated diagnosis errors for all cases were
calculated by comparing with the doctor’s diagnosis results. AD stages were converted into ordinal variables by assigning ranks of 1 to 4. Healthy condition labeled 1 and
numeric assignments increased until 4, which represented severe AD. Measured data and medical records from doctors of 34 patients were used as the population
database for the KF model training. Four female patients at the “age/AD stage” of 73/healthy, 75/mild, 77/moderate, and 81/severe were chosen to formulate a new
virtual patient to test the proposed KF-based algorithm for the following AD analysis.

 height, r = 0.96; particle Young’s modulus, r = 0.91 in the CSF; tip
thermal frequency changes, r = 0.94; serum and anti-Ab antibody
interaction, r = 0.92; binding force, r = 0.9; and molecule force, r =
0.97 in the serum. These coefficients were then used as a reference to
select parameters for KF inputs. On the basis of the results obtained
from the correlation matrix, we selected parameters with the highest
correlation to disease progression. For CSF, particle height and particle
Young’s modulus were used, and for serum samples, tip thermal fre-
quency changes and molecule forces were selected.
To demonstrate the sensitivity and effectiveness of using these pa-
rameters for determining the AD stages through KF-based diagnosis,
we compared the diagnostic accuracy of different parameter combina-
tions (Fig. 4B). Compared to the doctor’s diagnosis, the KF diagnostic
results using parameters with higher correlation coefficients trended
most like the doctor’s diagnosis and had greater stability and predict-
ability for AD diagnosis.
Integrating cognitive assessment and key parameters of
physical biomarkers for AD diagnosis and prognosis
The identified key nanoscale physical parameters and cognitive assess-
ment scores, including MMSE and Self-Administered Gerocognitive
Examination (SAGE; see details in fig. S1), were then inputted into
the KF-based algorithm to provide the diagnosis about each patient’s
disease status (fig. S7). By doing this, the patients’ cognitive assessment
scores and nanobiophysical measurements could provide complementary
information. Therefore, a dynamic model reflecting the relationships
between the measurements and AD status was established. This allowed
accurate diagnosis of AD status by excluding effects from the changes
spanning from the cognitive to the nanophysical scale. This method
prevents the KF-based algorithm from making quantitative conclusions
regarding AD status using limited measurements (4). As displayed in
a proof-of-concept study, this approachwas proven to be in closer agree-
ment to the doctor’s assessment of AD status, as compared to specific
conditions in which cognitive assessments could not correctly stage a
patient (fig. S8).
Effective diagnosis, unbiased progression prediction, and
optimized patient checkups for AD achieved through the
computational approach
To further demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of the proposed com-
putational algorithm, as well as the differences between using CSF
and blood-based data, all previous data covering healthy, mild AD,
moderate AD, and severe AD were used for proof-of-concept testing.
On the basis of the CSF data (Fig. 5, A and B), blood data (Fig. 5, C
and D), and CSF-blood integrated data (Fig. 5, E and F), the computa-
tional results validated the effectiveness of the proposal computation
approach to make prognostic (Fig. 5, A, C, and E) and determined
optimal checkup frequency (Fig. 5, B, D, and F).
CSF data in Fig. 5A demonstrated the ability of the KF to accurately
diagnose AD and to predict its progression. For diagnostic results (solid
lines in Fig. 5A), the two-visit data (green solid line) showed an error of
50%. The model diagnosed a patient as stage 3 (moderate) when the
doctor determined that she was stage 2 (mild). On the basis of the
three-visit data (red solid line), where the diagnosis error was 6.7%,
the model predicted that the patient was stage 2.8 (between mild and
moderate and more close to moderate), a finding more in line with the
doctor’s. By the fourth visit (solid blue line), diagnosis error was re-
duced to 2.5%, a finding that highlights how instrumental follow-up
visits were for the KF-based algorithm to accurately make predictions.
The KF was used not only to diagnose current AD status but also to
predict its progression (dashed lines in Fig. 5A). Although estimations
ofADprogressionusingonetotwovisits(purpleandgreen dashedlines)
were possible, more checkups increased estimation accuracy (three visits,
red dashed line). In Fig. 5A, one-visit data showed that stage 2.5 would
occur when she was at age 73.5 years, whereas two-visit data predicted
the onset of stage 2.5 when she was at age 75 years. In reality, the true
onset was at age 76 years. Thus, the results demonstrated the clear
effectiveness and potential of the proposed KF-based algorithm for
unbiased AD diagnosis and prognosis. Notably, the CSF data did show
prediction errors in the early disease stages, but unlike serum data, large
errors were not present in the later disease stages (Fig. 5C). Combining
the CSF and serum data as inputs for the KF-based prediction resulted
in asmaller erroranda betterfit (Fig. 5E), thusdemonstrating that more
diverse inputs provide better results.
Although more checkups improved prediction accuracy, visiting
too frequently may cause inconvenience to patients and increase med-
ical costs. To determine the optimal checkup frequency to capture any
changes in the KF inputs that would alter its prediction accuracy, we
integrated the Nyquist-Shannon sampling (NSS) theorem (detailed in
Materials and Methods). The NSS is a method of establishing the ap-
propriate sampling rate to capture all information from a continuous
signal with a series of discrete signals (43). In our approach, SAGE
scores and physical biomarkers were treated as continuous variables;
thus, simulations of future visit frequency were conducted by inter-
polation of simulated visits, AD status, and measurements (physical
properties and cognitive assessment scores). To capture the progression
of pathological and clinical events that lead to AD (4), predictions
required a sampling rate (medical checkup frequency) that was at least
two times higher than the frequency of progression dynamics. Thus,
there was a minimum sampling rate (visiting frequency) that had to
be met to make possible predictions on the basis of all information
available throughout AD progression. The linear relationship between
predicted visits and the minimum visiting frequency was evaluated
by reviewing and comparing prediction error rates. On the basis of
CSF data, simulation results (Fig. 5B) were obtained from represen-
tative data sets of 19, 7, 6, 5, and 4 visits. The corresponding prediction
errors were 25.7% (blue line, 4 visits), 15.6% (red line, 5 visits), 8.5%
(orange line, 6 visits), 4.3% (purple line, 7 visits), and 2.7% (green line,
19 visits). On the basis of these results, a minimum of six visits, that is,
one visit every year in the first 4 years, appeared to be best for generat-
ing an accurate prediction result (error, <5%). Additionally, to keep
this prediction accuracy, patients needed to maintain follow-up
visits once every 16 months. When we compared the optimization of
checkup frequencies based on CSF, serum (Fig. 5D), and both (Fig.
5F), we found that the CSF data provided a good fit at early stages but
differed much in the later stages to make ideal predictions about the
checkup frequency. The serum data had good fit for the whole changing
trend, but the error was large. Using serum and CSF combined data
(Fig. 5F), the results fit well and the five-visit curve was almost the same
as doctor’s diagnosis. This means that patients only need to maintain
an average of one doctor visit every 20 months for accurate prognosis,
compared to the 16-month requirements from the CSF data–based
prediction case.
Thus, in an optimal scenario, when a new patient arrives at the clinic,
the KF-based algorithm would first diagnose AD status using baseline
measurements from their CSF and blood nanocharacterization and
cognitive inputs; then, additional computational means would be used
to determine the optimal checkup frequency that captures any changes
in their physical biomarkers or SAGE scores. The NSS, the KF, and the
physical biomarkers from both CSF and blood provide a computational

DISCUSSION
Although much effort has been focused on evaluating cognitive assess-
ment scores using computational methods such as noise filtration and
data fusion, only small improvements in detection sensitivity have been
achieved (44, 45). This is most likely due in part to (i) drastic differ-
ences in cognitive scores between different subjects with the same stage
of AD and (ii) the limited number of measurement inputs. To address
these concerns, some researchers have attempted to use regression
modeling and support machine vector methods (46, 47). However, this
has resulted in somewhat reliable short-term predictability and un-
reliable long-term predictability (48). In this research, we were able to
overcome current AD diagnostic limitations in predictive modeling and
biomarker utilization by using a KF-based algorithm that could com-
putationally diagnose AD and predict its progression by integrating
cognitive assessment scores and nanophysical characteristics of protein
aggregates from CSF and serum. In the future, this method of compu-
tational integration could be further incorporated into the software for
automatic AD diagnosis based on various inputs collected during the
patient medical exams. This computational approach may reduce the
human errors and help establish an unbiased approach to diagnose
AD in hospitals, clinics, and research studies. Additionally, our findings
support the previously hypothesized notion that AD progression is
marked by alterations to the mechanical and morphological properties
of pathological proteins in the CSF (17, 27) and blood (41, 42) and that
the various fibrillization potentials of these proteins may help explain
the pathological progression of AD. Furthermore, we found that altera-
tions to these physical properties during disease pathogenesis occur
in a correlative manner and that the nanomechanics (particle Young’s
modulus) and nanomorphology (particle height) of CSF protein com-
ponents, as well as the molecule binding force of serum Ab, have appli-
cability as physical AD biomarkers. Overall, our findings have established
associations between the altered physical structures of pathological pro-
teins and AD pathogenesis and, more importantly, demonstrate that
these physical biomarkers can be computationally integrated with
behavior-based cognitive assessments to produce patient-specific diag-
nostic signatures that can be used to improve means of medically
diagnosing AD and predicting its progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study participants
The present study was performed at The Ohio State University and The
Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. We analyzed 34 CSF
samples from patients with AD (n = 24) and from healthy individuals
serving as controls (n = 10). We analyzed 30 serum samples from pa-
tients with AD (n = 22) and from healthy individuals serving as controls
(n = 8). Patients who received an AD diagnosis met the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition Revised) criteria
of dementia (49) and the criteria of probable AD defined by the National
Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke–
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (50). The
controls underwent cognitive testing and neurologic examination by
a physician, and individuals with objective cognitive or AD symptoms
were not included as controls in the present study.
Collection of human CSF samples
CSF was obtained from a total of 34 human subjects ranging from 54 to
83 years of age (10 subjects from the healthy group, mild AD group, and
moderate AD group, respectively, and 4 subjects from the severe AD
group; details are shown in table S1). CSF was obtained by lumbar
puncture by board-certified or board-eligible neurologists. The punc-
ture was performed between the lumbar vertebrae L4/5 and L3/4.
Numbing medication (Xylocaine) was injected into the skin before
inserting the lumbar puncture needle to reduce the pain of the needle
stick. A 22-gauge Sprotte spinal needle was used for lumbar puncture.
We collected up to 20 ml of CSF from each patient. The samples were
then centrifuged (1600g for 10 min at 4°C), and the supernatant was
aliquoted into 2-ml plastic polypropylene screw cap tubes and frozen
at −80°C for storage and further investigation.
CSF components preexperimental process
Protein aggregates were collected from CSF samples. Samples were first
thawed at 4°C, and then 0.5 ml was centrifuged at 1600g for 15 min at
room temperature. The precipitate (50 ml) was gently collected. After-
ward, the collected portion was diluted 25× in volume using distilled
(DI) water and centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 min, and the precipitate
(50 ml) was collected. The same dilution procedure was repeated two
more times. Eventually, the final precipitate (50 ml) was obtained and
used for experiments.
Collection of human serum samples
Serum was obtained from a total of 30 human subjects ranging from 54
to 81 years of age (details are shown in table S2). Up to 10 ml of blood
samples were collected and allowed to clot for 30 min at room tem-
perature in a vertical position. The samples were centrifuged (1300g for
10 min at room temperature), and the supernatant was aliquoted into
2-ml plastic polypropylenes screw cap tubes and frozen at –80°C for
storage and further investigation.
Immunofluorescence assay of CSF components
Processed CSF samples (10 ml) were combined with rabbit-derived
primary antibodies anti–Ab(1–42) antibody (#ab10148) and anti-tau
(#ab64193, Abcam) and goat-derived anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(Abcam) in immunofluorescence assays. Normal rabbit IgG antibody
(Abcam) was used to label negative control samples. Labeling proce-
dures were as follows: 10 ml of sample was mixed with one of the above
three primary antibodies (5 ml, 1 mg/ml), incubated in 100 ml of DI
water under room temperature for 2 hours, and centrifuged at
10,000g for 15 min. The precipitate (10 ml) was then collected, and
another 100 ml of DI water was added. The previous centrifuge step
was repeated, and the precipitate (10 ml) was collected. Next, the pre-
vious wash process was repeated. Secondary antibody (5 ml, 1 mg/ml)
was mixed with it and incubated in 100 ml of DI water under room
temperature for 30 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 10,000g
for 15 min, and the precipitate (10 ml) was collected. The wash pro-
cess used with the primary antibody labeling was conducted twice,
and the final precipitate (10 ml) was used for fluorescence imaging.

modulus of the sample was obtained via nanoindentation. As the

and the tip produced a force curve (force versus distance). From this

 curve, built-in software was used for the slope to calculate and quan-
tify the stiffness of the sample using Hertz theory (51). Samples were
obtained from four disease groups, including healthy subjects, mild
AD, moderate AD, and severe AD. Topographic mappings were first
obtained, and then Young’s modulus mappings were calculated. Large
particles were identified in topographic images, and theircorresponding
points in Young’s modulus mappings were extracted as the particle
Young’s modulus.
Nanomorphology characterization using HMI
The HMI (CytoViva; resolution limit, 90 nm) was used for particle
visualization and analysis. Using the system, images of micro-/nanoscale
structuresandmicro-/nanoparticleswere captured(52). Ten microliters
of CSF sample was covered by a thin cover glass and observed by
CytoViva. Without fluorescence staining, the particles inside the samples
were illuminated and visualized from samples of four disease groups,
including healthy subjects, mild, moderate, and severe AD patients.
For each subject, 10 images were collected at different positions of the
sample (including the margin and the center). The average particle con-
centration was calculated.
Nanomorphology characterization using AFM
To obtain details of nanomorphology with height for analysis, 10-ml
samples were dried on a slide glass, and an AFM was used under tap-
ping mode. In tapping mode, the cantilever oscillated up and down near
its resonance frequency, and the interaction of forces acting on the
cantilever when the tip comes close to the sample surface caused the
amplitude of oscillation to decrease because of Van der Waals forces,
dipole-dipole interactions, and electrostatic forces. Tapping mode was
gentle enough to allow for visualization of supported lipid bilayers,
adsorbed single polymer molecules (for instance, 0.4 nm thick), and
high-resolution topographic imaging of the protein components.
Force measurement of serum samples using functionalized
AFM tips
Coated with gold and anti-Ab(1–42) antibody (#ab10148, Abcam),
AFM tips were functionalized to specifically detect the Ab-embedded
proteins inside human serum. Serum or anti-Ab(1–42) antibody (5 ml)
was used to coat the substrates, respectively. The procedures of force
measurement are the same as those of nanomechanics characteriza-
tion. Binding force between the anti-Ab–coated tip and the substrate
was examined when the tip was lifted and the binding was broken
(Fig. 3, C and E).
Data acquisition and statistical analysis
Experimental data sets of one subject are listed in tables S3 and S4.
CSF samples from 34 human subjects were used in the nanomechan-
ics characterization of CSF. From AFM force curves, Young’s modulus
of characterized areas was calculated on the basis of a Hertz model. Data
processing was performed using the Igor software (Igor version 6.34,
WaveMetrics Inc.). The final data were classed into four groups ac-
cording to their AD stages and applied for the KF algorithm.
CSF samples from 34 human subjects were used in the nanomor-
phology characterization of CSF. Data processing is shown in fig. S9.
First, high-contract particle images obtainedviaCytoVivawere processed
byImageJ(version1.47,NationalInstitutesofHealth)tocalculateparticle
numbers, concentration, and distribution. Second, high-resolution
images obtained from AFM were analyzed using ImageJ and Igor soft-
ware. Sample size, shape, and arrangement were obtained.
Serum samples from 30 subjects were used in the force characteri-
zation of serum. The force curves were processed using Igor software
(Igor version 6.34, WaveMetrics Inc.). Serum and anti-Ab antibody
interaction and the plateau height in retract lines were calculated.
Statistical analysis was applied for determining the statistical signif-
icance between samples from different AD stages. Statistical analysis
was conducted using Prism 6 (GraphPad) software. One-way
ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test was used. Where there was sig-
nificant difference in variance between groups, nonparametric test
was applied. All data are presented as box plots (Fig. 2A). Meanings
of labels in graphs are as follows: NS, not significant; *P < 0.05; **P <
0.01; ***P < 0.001. All final data were classed into four groups
according to their AD stages and saved as measurement parameters ap-
plied for the KF algorithm, including particle Young’s modulus, con-
centration, size, and shape, as well as tip thermal frequency changes,
serum and anti-Ab antibody interaction, binding force, and molecule
force based on serum samples.
KF-based algorithm for AD diagnosis
Dynamics modeling of KF-based algorithm for AD diagnosis
In this research, Xk was used to represent parameters characteriz-
ing AD state, such as AD status, patient age, and measurements. Zk
was used to represent the measured data such as physical proper-
ties of CSF and serum components. k is progression index. The
progression dynamics of AD state can be modeled by the Markova
linear system as shown in Eq. 1, considering that the current AD
state was only related to the previous one, where A is the transition
matrix and Wk is the noise generated during the modeling formu-
lation. Furthermore, AD state (Xk) can be characterized by mea-
surements (Zk) and described by a mapping matrix C and an
estimation error Vk, as shown in Eq. 2. Q and R are covariance
matrices to characterize the noise generated in the modeling and
measurement process.

Personalized prediction algorithm derivation for
clinical application
The KF-based algorithm for AD analysis as shown in Eqs. 1 and 2 is
fully determined by four KF parameters: A, C, Q, and R. To obtain a
personalizedpredictionalgorithmforanindividualpatient,theseparam-
eters were optimally tuned using the maximum likelihood and expec-
tation maximization methods (53). The new patient’s data were fused
with the population data based on the central limit theorem and Bayes
theorem in the KF parameter-tuning process (54), further improving
the prediction accuracy for new patients.
AD diagnosis using KF-based algorithm
AD diagnosis for a new patient was conducted by the following proce-
dures (Fig. 4A).
Data acquisition
The nanomechanics and nanomorphology of CSF protein components
were obtained through nanocharacterization. The SAGE/MMSE scores
were obtained from cognitive assessments. Doctor’s judgments and the
demographic information, such as age, gender, education level, race,
and historical medical records, were recorded correspondingly for each
patient.
Data filtration to remove abnormal data and noise
The above data were processed by the failed data detector to identify the
abnormal data. The noise was reduced by using the KF-based fixed-
interval smoother.
Data evaluation and selection to obtain the data representing
AD progression
Collinearanalysiswas conducted using Pearson’smethod toidentify the
dependent data. Then, Bayes theorem–based data fusion method was
used to redefine these data and ensure that each piece of data indepen-
dently reflects AD progression. Afterward, correlation of each piece of
data to the AD status was identified by calculating the correlation
matrix, based on which the optimal data for accurate AD diagnosis were
selected.
Combination of nanocharacterization and cognitive
assessments to formulate complementary information for
AD diagnosis
Nanocharacterization data are more sensitive in the early AD stage,
and cognitive assessment data are more likely to change in the later
stages. On the basis of the sensitivity difference, each data were
segmented and assigned with a different weight to better reflect AD
progression.
KF-based stochastic algorithm for the quantitative diagnosis
of AD
With the above-obtained data input from one end of the algorithm, it
was possible to generate accurate diagnosis information for the patient
from the other end, including AD stage, potential risk to proceed to the
next AD stage, and schedule for the next follow-up clinical visit.
Advising the optimal checkup frequency using
KF-based algorithm
After a new patient came in for the first few times, the recommended
clinical checkup frequency was given using the KF-based algorithm by
the following procedures.
Data fusion and model training
Because the new patient only has one or two visits, the population-
based model was personalized by fusing the measured data of first few
visits. The KF-based algorithm was trained by the fused data to obtain a
personalized model for this specific new patient.
Future data prognosis
On the basis of the fused data and the personalized model, the prognosis
was made on the future visits. The age and physical properties of protein
components were predicted for different AD status.
Data interpolation and simulation
After the predicted data for different AD status were obtained, data
interpolation was conducted in different time spaces. Different visit
points were interrupted into the time period between each predicted
AD status to simulate different visiting frequencies. Afterward, the
stochastic model-based algorithm was trained again by all the obtained
data, and a further prediction for each visiting sequence was given by
the algorithm.
Best frequency selection
After predictions were made for different checkup frequencies, the
prediction error for each frequency was calculated. In addition, under
certain error threshold, the best frequency of future visiting was deter-
mined as the recommend future clinical checkup frequency for the
patient.
