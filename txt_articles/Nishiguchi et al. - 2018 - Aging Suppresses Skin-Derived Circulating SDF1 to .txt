In Brief
Nishiguchi et al. show that aging
promotes full-thickness tissue
regeneration in mouse skin. Aging
modulates chromatin accessibility at the
SDF1 gene, and genetic deletion of SDF1
in young skin enhances tissue
regeneration. Human skin also exhibits
age-dependent SDF1 suppression. They
identify a rare example where aging
improves tissue function.

SUMMARY
Physicians have observed that surgical wounds in
the elderly heal with thinner scars than wounds in
young patients. Understanding this phenomenon
may reveal strategies for promoting scarless wound
repair. We show that full-thickness skin wounds in
aged but not young mice fully regenerate. Exposure
of aged animals to blood from young mice by parabi-
osis counteracts this regenerative capacity. The
secreted factor, stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF1), is
expressed at higher levels in wounded skin of young
mice. Genetic deletion of SDF1 in young skin
enhanced
tissue
regeneration.
In
aged
mice,
enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and histone
H3 lysine 27 trimethylation are recruited to the
SDF1 promoter at higher levels, and pharmacologic
inhibition of EZH2 restores SDF1 induction and pre-
vents tissue regeneration. Similar age-dependent
EZH2-mediated SDF1 suppression occurs in human
skin. Our findings counter the current dogma that
tissue function invariably declines with age and sug-
gest new therapeutic strategies in regenerative med-
icine.
INTRODUCTION
Organisms repair wounds using a combination of two biological
processes: scar formation and tissue regeneration. Scar forma-
tion results in deposition of fibrous tissue that disrupts the orig-
inal tissue architecture (Sun et al., 2014a). Tissue regeneration
results in reconstitution of the original and functional tissue archi-
tecture, including all cellular subtypes and absence of scar for-
mation (Carlson, 2007). Although amphibians regenerate lost
limbs, mammals generally repair injured tissue with scar forma-
tion. However, limited examples of human tissue regeneration
do exist, including adult liver regeneration, pediatric traumatic
digit tip amputations, and fetal skin wounds. These examples
suggest that the mechanisms mediating tissue regeneration
remain conserved in mammals. Ear hole closure is a well-estab-
lished and accepted animal model of mammalian tissue regener-
ation in multiple species, including rabbits (Goss and Grimes,
1975; Joseph and Dyson, 1966), the rodent strain Acomys (Sei-
fert et al., 2012), and certain inbred and mutant mouse strains
(Bedelbaeva et al., 2010; Clark et al., 1998; Leung et al., 2015;
Shyh-Chang et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013). Repair of injured
ear tissue exhibits similarities to amphibian limb regeneration,
including basement membrane breakdown, blastema formation,
and absence of scars (Brockes and Kumar, 2008; Clark et al.,
1998; Gourevitch et al., 2003, 2009; Heber-Katz et al., 2013).
Human skin wounds invariably form scars. Aging slows the
speed of skin re-epithelialization and the subsequent rate of
wound repair (Gosain and DiPietro, 2004; Keyes et al., 2016),
but the strength of re-epithelized skin remains roughly the
same at any age (Kim et al., 2015). Dermatologists and plastic
surgeons have observed that skin wounds in the elderly close
with thinner scars. Indeed, the incidence of keloid and hypertro-
phic scar formation peaks in the second decade of life and de-
creases with age (Bayat et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2014b). These
surprising and somewhat counterintuitive clinical observations
suggest that the tissue-regenerative pathway in the skin, instead
of being diminished, may be more effective in the elderly. Here
we investigated the role of aging as a regulator of mammalian tis-
sue regeneration.
RESULTS
Aging Promotes Tissue Regeneration and Decreased
Scar Formation in Mouse Ears
In young (1-month-old) wild-type (WT) mice, through-and-
through 2-mm ear holes closed to a significantly larger size
compared with aged (18-month-old) WT mice (Figures 1A and
1B). H&E staining of wound edge tissue from young mice
revealed horizontally oriented fibroblasts and glassy thickened
collagen, findings consistent with tissue fibrosis and scar forma-
tion (Figures 1C and 1D). Opposing cartilage end plates re-
mained approximately 2 mm apart, confirming the absence of
cartilage regeneration. By contrast, wound edge tissue from
aged mice demonstrated normal tissue architecture, with hair
follicles, sebaceous glands, and subcutaneous fat (Figure 1D,
dotted box; Figure S1A). Significantly more chondrocytes ex-
pressed Ki-67, a cell proliferation marker (Figures 1F and S1B),

 and opposing cartilage end plates re-anastomosed (Figure 1D,
black arrow). Compared with young mice, injured aged mice ex-
pressed significantly lower levels of a-smooth muscle actin
(aSMA) mRNA and protein, a marker of myofibroblasts, which
are involved in scar formation (Figures 1E and 1G). To assess
other areas of skin, we performed full-thickness excisional
wounding assays on dorsal back skin using silicone splints that
minimize wound contraction and permit assessment of wound
repair (Loh et al., 2009). In young mice, back wounds repaired
with a fibrotic scar and exhibited increased levels of aSMA (Fig-
ures 1H, 1I, S1C, and S1D). By contrast, back wounds on aged
mice repaired with diminished scar formation, as evidenced by
return of hair follicles and lower levels of aSMA. Thus, age-
dependent tissue regeneration may be generalized to mouse
skin and may not require chondrocytes.
A Circulating Factor Promotes Scar Formation
In aged animals, exposure to young blood often improves stem
cell function in many organs, including muscle, liver, spinal
cord, and the brain (Brack et al., 2007; Conboy et al., 2005;
Ruckh et al., 2012; Villeda et al., 2014). Given our age-defined
phenotype, we assessed whether a circulating factor contrib-
utes to skin tissue regeneration. We generated heterochronic
parabiosis pairs (Figures 2A and S2A), joining the vascula-
ture of young and aged mice, and compared these with iso-
chronic (young:young or aged:aged) control pairs. As expected,
aged:aged pairs closed ear holes to a smaller size compared
with young:young pairs (Figures 2A and 2B, black versus green
lines). H&E staining of wound edge tissue from young:young
pairs revealed scar formation, which is highlighted by Masson’s
trichrome staining of collagen as a light blue region (Figure 2A,
dotted areas; Figure S2B, low magnification). By contrast,
wound edge tissue from aged:aged pairs demonstrated carti-
lage regeneration and the absence of scars (Figure 2A, black
arrow). Within the heterochronic parabiosis pairs, the aged
parabiont adopted the young parabiont fibrotic phenotype.
Both parabiont mice repaired ear holes to a larger size and
with scar formation (Figures 2A and 2B, red and blue lines).
Thus, a circulating factor in young blood promotes scar forma-
tion and blocks skin tissue regeneration in aged mice. Compared
with individual aged mice, the aged:aged pairs did not close their
ear holes as effectively because the skin incision from the para-
biosis procedure may elicit additional injury-induced circulatory
factor(s). When we lengthened the time between the parabiosis
procedure and ear injury, ear hole closure improved significantly
(Figure S2C).
To identify potential circulating factors, we interrogated pub-
lished RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data generated from isolated
keratinocytes from unwounded or wound edge tissue in young
and aged C57/BL6 mice (Keyes et al., 2016). We focused on
secreted factors and noted SDF1 (also known as Cxcl12) as
one of their top hits. We previously demonstrated that SDF1-
CXCR4 signaling modulated ear tissue regeneration in mice
lacking Cdkn1a (Leung et al., 2015), and SDF1 was identified
as a top regeneration-associated gene in a transcription profiling
study comparing tissues from three regenerative animal models
(King and Yin, 2016). Taken together, we postulated that sup-
pression of SDF1 in aged mice promotes ear tissue regeneration.
Compared with aged animals, ear punch or back skin injury in
young animals significantly induced SDF1 mRNA and serum pro-
tein levels (Figures 2C–2E). Immunohistochemistry and cell
isolation experiments localized the majority of SDF1 expression
to wound edge keratinocytes (Figures 2F–2H and S2D). Thus,
aging represses SDF1 secretion from injured keratinocytes.
Injured Young Keratinocytes Secrete SDF1 to Promote
Scar Formation
To
investigate
whether
the
suppression
of
keratinocyte-
secreted SDF1 promotes tissue regeneration, we generated
K5-rtTA; tetO-Cre; Cxcl12fl/fl mice (abbreviated to SDF1KOker)
and confirmed conditional SDF1 inactivation in keratinocytes
(Greenbaum et al., 2013; Figure S3A). Compared with controls
(doxycycline-treated WT mice or untreated SDF1KOker mice),
doxycycline-treated SDF1KOker mice closed ear holes to a
significantly smaller size (Figures 3A and S3B), and wound
edge tissue revealed increased
chondrocyte
proliferation,
diminished aSMA expression, and decreased scar formation
(Figures 3B, 3C, 3E, S3C, and S3D). Moreover, injury did not in-
crease serum SDF1 levels in SDF1KOker mice (Figure 3D). To
confirm that skin-specific SDF1 promotes scar formation in het-
erochronic parabiosis, we generated parabiosis pairs between
young doxycycline-treated SDF1KOker and aged WT mice.
Both parabionts closed ear holes to a significantly smaller
size, similar to the aged:aged pairs, and wound edge tissue
from both parabionts demonstrated cartilage regeneration
and decreased scar formation (Figures 3F and 3G, black ar-
rows).
Finally,
compared
with
non-doxycycline-treated
SDF1KOker mice, silicone-stented back wounds on doxycy-
cline-treated SDF1KOker mice exhibited diminished scar forma-
tion, as evidenced by return of hair follicles and reduced levels
of aSMA (Figures 3H, 3I, and S3E). Thus, circulating SDF1 in
young blood originates from wounded keratinocytes to drive
scar formation.

Recruitment of EZH2 and H3K27me3 to the SDF1 Gene

 et al., 2015; Figure S4A). Compared with young mice, tiled chro-
matin immunoprecipitation of wound edge tissue from injured
aged mice exhibited increased enrichment for histone H3 lysine
27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), an epigenetic marker of gene inhi-
bition, at the SDF1 promoter (�2 kb and �0.8 kb from the tran-
scription start site) and transcription start site (TSS) (+0.5 kb
from the transcription start site) (Figures 4A and S4B; Sen et al.,
2016). The same tissue also demonstrated decreased histone
H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) enrichment, an epigenetic
marker of gene activation. EZH2 catalyzes the addition of methyl
groups to H3K27 (Sen et al., 2016). Compared with young mice,
wound edge tissue from injured aged mice exhibited increased
levels of EZH2 transcript and protein and increased EZH2 enrich-
ment at the SDF1 promoter and transcription start site (Figures
4A–4E). Finally, aged mice treated with 3-Deazaneplanocin A hy-
drochloride (DZNep), a well-characterized pharmacologic inhibi-
tor of EZH2, restored SDF1 induction, and ear holes closed with
larger sizes (Figure 4F; Glazer et al., 1986). Taken together, aging
suppresses SDF1 induction through increased recruitment of
EZH2 to the SDF1 promoter.
Human Skin Exhibits Age-Dependent EZH2-Mediated
SDF1 Induction
To assess SDF1 expression in human skin, we interrogated pub-
lished microarray data from uninjured and 1 week post-injured
human skin of different ages (Nuutila et al., 2012; 2013; Stone
et al., 2017). Similar to the mouse, wounded young human skin
contained higher levels of SDF1 transcript compared with
wounded aged human skin (Figure 4G). To elucidate the role of
EZH2 in human skin, we knocked down EZH2 in human keratino-
cytes (Figure 4H). Nutrient deprivation, which mimics the loss of
blood supply to tissue during injury and is a known stimulant of
SDF1 (Santiago et al., 2011), significantly induced SDF1 in young
but not aged keratinocytes, and EZH2 knockdown rescued SDF1
induction in aged keratinocytes (Figure 4H). To further test the
relevance of our findings to human skin, we created three-dimen-
sional human skin organoid constructs with young (<1 year old)
and aged (>71 years old) human skin cells (Figures 4I, S4C, and
S4D). Hole punch injury of these human skin equivalents induced
SDF1 transcript and protein and downregulated EZH2 transcript
in an age-dependent manner (Figures 4I and 4J). DZNep also
restored SDF1 expression in aged organoids. Thus, our findings
suggest that inhibition of SDF1 or EZH2 may be used to decrease
scar formation in humans in potential future clinical trials.
DISCUSSION
Our results counter the current dogma that tissue function inev-
itably worsens with age and uncovers potential mechanisms to
explain the paradoxical effect of aging on skin tissue regenera-
tion. Our ear tissue regeneration data agree with prior work on
aging and speed of wound closure. Aging slows the speed of
skin re-epithelialization on a dorsal back wound (Gosain and
DiPietro, 2004; Keyes et al., 2016). In the ear, young animals
reach �85% of their final hole size by week 2 after injury,
whereas aged animals attain �30% of their final hole size.
Thus, young ears repair faster but a scar develops, whereas
aged ears repair slower but to a better resolution. Indeed, over-
expression of SDF1 speeds up skin re-epithelialization (Va
˚ gesjo
¨
et al., 2018). We speculate that, from an evolution perspective, a
young injured animal favors fast and imperfect wound repair over
slow and perfect tissue regeneration. Future studies are needed
to assess the relationship between skin re-epithelialization
speed and scar formation.
This aging-induced switch between scar formation and tis-
sue regeneration appears to be a gradual process rather
than a binary decision. Prior studies demonstrated that mid-
dle-aged (10-month-old) mice closed ear holes to a greater
extent compared with 1-month-old mice (Costa et al., 2009;
Reines et al., 2009). Our results suggest that this ability further
improves with age because we see full ear hole closure in 18-
month-old mice (versus partial closure in 10-month-old mice
shown in previous studies). We speculate that even older ani-
mals (> 18 months old) would behave similarly to 18-month-old
animals but acknowledge the possibility that the tissue regen-
eration ability peaks at 18 months of age. Taken together, scar
formation and tissue regeneration may indeed coexist and may
not be mutually exclusive processes. More work is needed to
understand how these two processes regulate each other.
Finally, an alternative interpretation of our dataset is that
regenerative healing is the ‘‘default’’ program and that young
age inhibits this process. Although scar formation is the

 dominant form of wound repair in mammals at any age, we
cannot rule out this possibility and include it in our discussion
to be thorough.
Although our ear and back wound models are superficially
similar, they still represent different systems with different cell
types involved. We have found that keratinocyte-secreted
SDF1 regulates the choice between tissue regeneration and
scar formation in the ear and back skin. Increased SDF1 also
drives scar formation in other organs, including mouse lung
and zebrafish fin, and loss-of-function CXCR4 mutations, the
canonical receptor for SDF1, promote liver regeneration (Ding
et al., 2014a; Makino et al., 2013; Shu et al., 2013). Thus, our
data support the attractive hypothesis that SDF1 regulates tis-
sue regeneration across multiple organs, and future studies are
needed to elucidate whether the precise cellular and molecular
mechanisms are conserved in other organs.
Our parabiosis experiments suggest that injury-induced
changes in serum SDF1 blood levels are due to skin-specific
secretion. However, SDF1 signaling may propagate through au-
tocrine feedforward loops (Kojima et al., 2010; Sauve
´ et al.,
2009). Although our data suggest that skin-secreted SDF1 initi-
ates the process, it remains possible that skin-secreted SDF1
activates or mobilizes circulating cells to produce additional
SDF1. Finally, although skin-specific loss of SDF1 significantly
improves skin tissue regeneration, knockout mice do not fully
close injured ear holes. This suggests that other factors also
likely participate in tissue regeneration.
Current treatment paradigms for hypertrophic and keloid
scars are woefully ineffective and represent a major unmet
need in clinical practice. Human pathologic scars contain higher
amounts of SDF1, and keloid-prone individuals have higher
circulating levels of SDF1 (Ding and Tredget, 2015). Human
skin grafts transplanted onto the back of immune-deficient
mice invariably form scars, and pharmacologic inhibition of
SDF1 signaling reduced scar formation (Ding et al., 2014b).
The discovery of a conserved pathway controlling age-depen-
dent tissue regeneration suggests that clinical trials testing
SDF1 and/or EZH2 antagonists in the treatment of pathological
scarring in humans are warranted.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animals
C57BL/6 female mice (18-months old) were purchased from the National Institute on Aging, and C57BL/6 male mice (18-months old)
were purchased from Jackson Labs. C57BL/6 (strain #000664, 1-month old) females, Cxcl12fl/fl (strain #021773), mTmG mice (strain
#007676), Cdkn1a–/– mice (strain #003263), and K14-CreER (strain #5107) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All mice
were group housed in the animal facility of University of Pennsylvania on a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle with ad libitum access
to water and normal chow. K5-rtTA; tetO-Cre mice were a generous gift from Sarah Millar (University of Pennsylvania). Mice were
verified by genotyping. To delete alleles, we administered doxycycline food pellets (6gm/kg, Bio-Serv) for one week or administered
1 mg of tamoxifen (diluted in corn oil) daily by intraperitoneal injection for 5 days. Mice used in this study were female age-matched
littermates that were randomly assigned to experimental groups, except for SDF1KOker experiments where both male and female
mice were used and the DZNep aged mouse experiment where male mice were used. No sex-dependent differences were observed.
Study approval
Experiments involving mice were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Penn-
sylvania. Mice were treated in accordance with the NIH guidelines for the humane care of animals.
Cell Culture and Human Skin Organoids
Primary human keratinocytes of different ages and gender were obtained from the University of Pennsylvania Skin Biology and
Disease Resource Center. The specific age and location is described in Figure S4D. Cells were grown in supplemented 50:50 ker-
atinocyte media, a 50:50 mixture of keratinocytes-SFM (Thermo Scientific) and Medium 154 (Thermo Scientific) (Leung et al., 2013).
Cells are grown at 37�C and 5% CO2. For nutrient-deprivation experiments, keratinocyte media was removed and replaced with un-
supplemented keratinocyte media (50:50 without supplementation) for 24-hours.
Human skin organoids were established using previously detailed methods (Ridky et al., 2010). Briefly, 1.0 3 106 primary human
keratinocytes were seeded onto aceulluar human dermis, in keratinocyte growth media (KGM) (DMEM high glucose, 22% Ham’s-
F12, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, 0.2% adenine, 0.2% hydrocortisone,
0.13% insulin, 0.1% cholera toxin, 0.1% EGF, 0.1% transferrin/triiodo-L-thryonine, 0.1% ciprofloxacin hydrochloride). The organoids
were maintained at the air-liquid interface at 37�C for 4 days prior to being wounded.
METHOD DETAILS
Injury Models
For ear wounding, we used a standard 2mm mechanical punch (Roboz, Gaithersburg, MD) to create a hole in the center of each outer
ear (pinna). Ear hole diameter was measured using a dissection microscope (Nikon) in the horizontal and vertical directions on a
weekly basis. Ears were excluded if there were signs of wound infection, tearing of the ear, or abnormal geometric shape. These
criteria were pre-established.
For human skin organoid injury, we used a standard 1.5mm punch (Acupunch) to create a hole in the center of each graft.
Murine Excisional Back Wound Model
We used a well-described murine full-thickness excisional wound model (Loh et al., 2009). Briefly, a 6mm disposable biopsy punch
(Delasco) was used to make two circular full thickness wounds on the dorsal back skin of mice. Silicon wound splints (Grace Bio-
Labs) were sutured with 4-0 Nylon to prevent skin contracture. Wounds were dressed with a sterile occlusive dressing and monitored

 daily. Borders were monitored by frequently application of permanent marker. Photos were taken at various time points throughout
the 26-day duration of the experiment.
Parabiosis
Parabiosis surgery followed previously described procedures (Kamran et al., 2013). Briefly, mirror-image incisions at the left and right
flanks were made through the skin. Elbow and knee joints from each parabiont were sutured together with 3-0 Nylon, and the skin of
each mouse was sutured with 4-0 Nylon to the skin of the adjacent parabiont. Each mouse was treated with subcutaneous normal
saline, meloxicam (Putney), and buprenorphine hydrochloride (Butler Schein Animal Health) as directed for pain and monitored
closely during recovery. 2-3 days after surgery, steristrips were placed over the sutures on the skin. For overall health, several recov-
ery characteristics were analyzed at various times after surgery, including weight and grooming responses, and animals were
excluded if they failed overall health inspection. We waited 1 month after the parabiosis surgery to perform our standard ear punch
assay.
Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Standard histology and immunostaining protocols were performed, and investigators were blinded during histologic staining. Briefly,
immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 5-10 mm-thick sections of mouse skin. The following primary antibodies were used:
mouse monoclonal anti-Ki-67 (1:100, Immunostar, 1:100, Abcam, ab15580), rabbit polyclonal anti-SDF1 (1:100, Abcam, ab25117),
rabbit monoclonal anti-EZH2 (1:100, Cell Signaling Technology, #5246), rabbit polyclonal anti- aSMA (1:100, Abcam ab7817), rabbit
polyclonal anti–keratin 14 (1:100; BioLegend), rabbit polyclonal anti–keratin 10 (1:100; BioLegend), and rabbit polyclonal anti-loricrin
(1:100; BioLegend). Immune complexes were detected with secondary antibodies conjugated with either GFP or DAB-Peroxidase
substrate solution (Abcam). Trichome staining was performed per the manufacturers directions (Thermo Scientific). After staining,
images were directly analyzed on an AxioM1 microscope equipped with a CCD digital camera (Carl Zeiss) or Keyence imaging sys-
tem. A minimum of 4-6 sections was stained per sample. Secondary only control was included for every experiment. Unwounded skin
was included as a control for each antibody. Representative images selected for figure panels.
Relative protein expression was quantified on a 0 to 3 scale: 0 indicates no staining; 1 signifies weak staining; 2 signifies interme-
diate staining; and 3 signifies strong staining. For EZH2, a score was obtained every 250 mm of epidermis (minimum of 1mm) for each
sample and then averaged. Our prior work with cartilage-lineage tracing regenerating mice (Cdkn1a–/–, Col2-CreER, mTmG,(Leung
et al., 2015)) agrees with other published studies that ear chondrocyte regeneration occurs as individual islands at the distal tip
(Zhang et al., 2015). For Ki-67+ chondrocytes, positive cells were counted for every 250-400 mm of cartilage, beginning at the distal
tip for each sample. As an internal positive control, we counted Ki-67+ basal keratinocytes. For quantification of SDF1 and aSMA
staining, we used open-source software to count colored pixels as previously described (Billings et al., 2015). A minimum of 4 different
samples were used for each time point and then averaged.
Real-time RT–PCR
Freshly dissected tissue from the rim of healing appendages were manually dissociated with scissors, collected in TRI Regeant
(Zymo) and then mechanically disrupted (Fastprep 24, Lysing Matrix D, MP Bio). Total RNA was isolated by Direct-Zol RNA
MicroPrep (Zymo). RNA concentration was measured by Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific). cDNA synthesis was performed with
Maxima Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Scientific) per manufacturer’s instructions. One-step quantitative RT–PCR was performed
and analyzed using an ABI ViiA7 Real-Time PCR detection system (Applied Biosystems) with TaqMan one-step RT–PCR Master Mix
Reagents. Taqman probes were purchased for mouse (Acta2, beta-actin, Cxcl12, Cdkn1a, Ezh2) and human genes (beta-actin,
Cxcl12, Ezh2) (Applied Biosystems).
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
Briefly, dissected ear tissue was treated with 4% formaldehyde solution and quenched with glycine. Tissue was frozen in liquid
nitrogen and pulverized (Covaris). Tissue was lysed in ChIP lysis SDS buffer (50mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 10mm EDTA)
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). ChIP buffer (50mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5, 140mM NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate, 1mmEDTA, 0.1% SDS) was added to the samples, and sonication was performed (Covaris). After
centrifugation, antibody (H3K27me3 (Cell Signaling Technologies, #9733), H3K4me3 (Millipore, #07-473), EZH2 (Millipore, Clone
AC22, #17-662)) was added to each sample and samples rotated overnight at 4�C. Protein-A/G magnetic beads (Dynabeads; Invi-
trogen) were washed and added to samples for 4 hours. Beads were collected, washed thoroughly with ChIP wash buffer (50mM Tris
pH8.0, 250mM LiCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 1mM EDTA), and resuspended in decrosslinking buffer (50mM Tris pH 8.0,
10mM EDTA, 1% SDS). After RNase A and proteinase K treatment, samples underwent phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol
precipitation. Samples were analyzed by real-time PCR. ChIP primers available in Key Resources Table.
Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting
To assess GFP+ cells in parabiosis mice, blood was obtained from the retro-orbital sinus, and red blood cells were removed (RBC
lysis buffer, eBioscience). Cells were resuspended in FACS buffer (HBSS, 0.2% BSA, 1% HEPES). For keratinocyte isolation exper-
iments, freshly dissected tissue from the rim of healing wounds were manually dissociated with scissors and then incubated with
e4

 Liberase TL (Roche) for 90 min at 37�C. After dissociation, cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS + 0.05%
NaN3 + 2% FBS). 7-AAD (BioLegend) was added to exclude dead cells. GFP+ cells were identified and sorted.
Cell sorting was performed at the Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Facility (University of Pennsylvania). Standard FACS procedures
were performed. The BD CompBeads Set Anti-Mouse Ig, k was used to compensate and determine gating strategies. GFP expres-
sion was quantified with FlowJo software (Treestar). Sorted cells were immediately harvested for RNA purification.
ELISA
Blood was obtained from the retro-orbital sinus, and serum was collected after blood coagulation. Mouse SDF1 ELISA was per-
formed per the manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems, #MCX120). Recombinant SDF1 was used as a positive control.
Knockdown Experiments
We obtained seven lentiviral knockdown vectors from The RNAi Consortium shRNA Library for human EZH2 (TRCN0000039040).
Control knockdown vector is a lentivirus vector containing a scrambled sequence. Lentivirus was produced as previously described
(Leung et al., 2004) and used to infect primary keratinocytes. After antibiotic selection, knockdown vectors were assessed for efficacy
by Western analysis. The top 2 vectors (#62 and #28) were used to create EZH2-knockdown keratinocytes, and the data shown is
from #28 knockdown vector-infected keratinocytes. Cells were then used for nutrient-deprivation experiments as described above.
Total protein was prepared from mouse ear tissue by mechanical tissue disruption in PBS with protease inhibitor and an equal vol-
ume of 2x SDS sample buffer was then added. Equal amounts of protein were resolved on SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) and transferred to
PVDF membranes (Perkin Elmer) for immunoblotting with specific antibodies, including rabbit monoclonal anti-EZH2 (1:1000; Cell
Signaling Technology, 5246) and rabbit polyclonal anti-b-actin-HRP (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After further incubation
with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, signal was visualized using ECL detection (Millipore Luminata) on film.
Pharmacologic inhibitor experiments
Mice treated with DZNep received IP injections (2 mg/kg, Millipore #252790) three-times per week; mice were pre-treated for one
week before receiving ear punch.
Organoids treated with DZNep (1mM final concentration, Millipore #252790) received the inhibitor one day prior to injury and
continued until sample collection.
Primary human skin microarray
Data was accessed on the Gene Expression Omnibus website (GEO Accession numbers: GSE84571, GSE28914, GSE33169).
Uninjured and 7-day post-injured human skin samples of different ages were identified, and levels of Cxcl12 (ID: 203666_at) was as-
sessed directly on the GEO website.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Experimental Design
Presented data combines all experiments, and unless noted, all experiments were repeated 3 times independently. Experiments
were not randomized, and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment, unless noted
in the text.
Statistical Analysis
For in vivo time courses comparing hole size (Figures 1B, 2B, 3G, 4F, S2C, S3B), data were analyzed using the method of Generalized
Estimating Equations (GEE). The temporal correlation and correlation between holes within the same mouse were modeled using an
exchangeable correlation matrix. The GEE model incorporated a temporal main effect, a main effect comparing the types of mice,
and an interaction of the two main effects. Statistical significances in the GEE model were determined using a Wald test.
For parabiosis experiments, a pre-hoc power analysis was performed using ‘‘longpower’’ on R. We tried three different correlation
values (0.2, 0.5, 0.8) and two values of variance in the areas (0.25, 0.5) to detect a difference of d = 0.5mm between the two groups.
The sample size needed ranged from 1-6 pairs for a power of 80% and 2-sided-significance of 5%. A post hoc power analysis was
also performed using power calculator on R. Given our mean difference in surface area and the sample size of n = 3, we achieved
greater than 95% power detection.
Otherwise, 2-tailed Student’s t test was used to determine significance, with P values of less than 0.05 considered significant.
Higher levels of significance are indicated by the following: ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001 in the text. When appropriate, specific P values
are provided in figure legends.
