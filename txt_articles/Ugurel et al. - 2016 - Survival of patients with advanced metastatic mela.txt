Abstract
The survival of advanced metastatic melanoma has been greatly improved within
the past few years. New therapeutic strategies like kinase inhibitors for BRAF-mutant mela-
noma and immune checkpoint blockers proved to prolong survival times within clinical trials,
and many of them have already entered routine clinical use. However, these different treat-
ment modalities have not yet been tested against each other, which complicate therapy deci-
sions. We performed an explorative analysis of survival data from recent clinical trials.
Thirty-five KaplaneMeier survival curves from 17 trials were digitised, re-grouped by match-
ing inclusion criteria and treatment line, and averaged by therapy strategy. Notably, the

 survival curves grouped by therapy strategy revealed a very high concordance, even if different
agents were used. The greatest survival improvement was observed with the combination of
BRAF plus MEK inhibitors as well as with Programmed-death-1 (PD1) blockers with or
without cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) blockers, respectively, with
these two treatment strategies showing similar survival outcomes. For first-line therapy, aver-
aged survival proportions of patients alive at 12 months were 74.5% with BRAF plus MEK
inhibitor treatment versus 71.9% with PD-1 blockade. This explorative comparison shows
the kinase inhibitors as similarly effective as immune checkpoint blockers with regard to sur-
vival. However, to confirm these first trends for implementation into an individualised treat-
ment of melanoma patients, data from prospective clinical trials comparing the different
treatment strategies head-to-head have to be awaited.

1. Introduction
Systemic treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma
has been an unmet medical need for decades. Chemo-
therapy with dacarbazine or other cytotoxic drugs
resulted in median survival times of 7e9 months and no
therapeutic
regimen,
either
other
chemotherapeutic
agents, biochemotherapy, or immunotherapy proved to
be superior to dacarbazine in terms of survival [1]. In
these times, long-term survival of 5 years and more was
only achieved in 5e10% of patients regardless of the
specific therapy strategy used.
Recently, during the last few years, the treatment of
metastatic
melanoma
has
been
rapidly
evolving.
Approximately 40e50% of metastatic cutaneous mela-
nomas harbour a BRAF V600 mutation, constitutively
activating
the
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase
(MAPK) pathway [2]. The BRAF inhibitors vemur-
afenib and dabrafenib were developed to specifically
target this driver mutation and further similar com-
pounds like encorafenib are still under study [3,4].
Another target is the signalling molecule MEK down-
stream of BRAF, and its blockade can likewise inacti-
vate the MAPK pathway [5]. Both, BRAF and MEK
inhibitors showed superior activity in BRAF V600-
mutated melanoma in comparison to dacarbazine, and
led to a significantly increased progression-free (PFS)
and overall survival (OS) in the respective patients. Even
more efficacious is the combined inhibition of both
targets, BRAF and MEK, and thus a simultaneous
application of vemurafenib plus cobimetinib or dabra-
fenib plus trametinib led to a further prolongation of
PFS and OS [6e9].
New immunotherapeutic approaches for metastatic
melanoma are another promising approach, which
developed simultaneously and in parallel to MAPK
pathway inhibitors, resulting in two separate novel
treatment
strategies.
Presently,
targeting
immune
checkpoints, which normally terminate immune re-
sponses after antigen activation, is a main focus in the
treatment
of
advanced
melanoma.
Cytotoxic
T-
lymphocyte-associated
antigen-4
(CTLA-4)
is
an
immunomodulatory molecule that down-regulates T-
cell-activation. Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal
antibody that blocks CTLA-4 was the first successfully
developed drug of a new class of therapeutics named
immune checkpoint inhibitors. Long-term survival of up
to 20% of treated patients has been reported with ipili-
mumab [10e12]. Programmed-death-1 (PD1) is another
immune checkpoint target expressed on activated T-cells
mediating immunosuppression. Its ligands PD-L1 (B7-
H8) and PD-L2 (B7-DC) are expressed on many
tumour cells, stroma cells and other cell types including
leucocytes. The immunosuppressive action of the PD1
receptor is activated in the effector phase of the inter-
action between T lymphocytes and tumour cells, and the
blockade of this receptor seems to be more effective
towards
T-cell-activation
than
CTLA-4
blockade.
Nivolumab (BMS-936558) is a fully human IgG4
monoclonal
antibody
directed
against
PD1.
Pem-
brolizumab
(MK-3475)
is
a
selective,
humanised
monoclonal IgG4-kappa anti-PD1 antibody. The effi-
cacy of both agents was studied in advanced melanoma
and other solid tumours [13e15]. Other PD-1 and PD-
L1 inhibitors are also under evaluation.
With regard to these new developments in the treat-
ment of advanced melanoma, only few of these therapies
have yet been compared to one another, and trials have
not yet been conducted to evaluate the optimal sequence
of therapies with rigorous, randomised designs. For
BRAF-mutant patients, multiple therapy strategies with
documented survival improvement exist from which to
choose. However, there are no clear data as to which
regimen should be administered in the first, second, or
even third line, or whether there are patient character-
istics or biomarkers helpful for treatment selection.
This work analyses selected clinical trials represen-
tative for the new treatment strategies in advanced
melanoma and compares their survival outcome by
digitisation of published KaplaneMeier survival curves.

 Only prospective trials with similar inclusion and
exclusion criteria were included. Compassionate use
programmes were excluded. Data analysis is explor-
atory, does not include statistical testing, and compari-
sons are descriptive only. We intended to support
current clinical decision-making in the individualised
treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma while
awaiting the conduct of definitive trials aimed at
comparing
individual
and
sequential
treatment
strategies.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Search strategy and selection criteria
We searched PubMed from 1st January 2002 to 1st
June 2015, with the algorithm “melanoma [Title] AND

2118436

the algorithm “(BRAF [ti] OR NRAS [ti]) AND mela-
noma [ti] AND survival”, respectively. We also sourced
relevant articles referenced by other papers and ab-
stracts from clinical meetings held in the past 10 years.
All papers were available in full text and were original
articles or conference presentations published in En-
glish. Clinical trials included into this explorative sur-
vival analysis were phase III trials and large phase-I and
-II trials. Only trials investigating therapy strategies of
current interest were chosen for this comparison; thus, a
clinical trial testing single-agent trametinib was omitted
since MEK inhibitor monotherapy currently is not an
option for the treatment of BRAF-mutated melanoma
[5]. Comparator therapy arms confounded by cross-over
to experimental arms were omitted from analysis due to
a mixed therapeutic situation.
2.2. Description of survival curves
KaplaneMeier
survival
curves
for
PFS
and
OS,
respectively, were identified from the publications of the
selected
clinical
trials,
and
subsequently
scanned,
extracted, and manually digitised using an interactive
digitising software (DigitizeIt; http://www.DigitizeIt.de/
). This software creates sampling points and allows
curve construction by linear interpolation between these
points. The accuracy of the manual digitisation depends
on the quality of the graphical displays in the respective
publications and on the zoom factors necessary for
enlarging the displays. This method allows the construct
of mean KaplaneMeier curves by averaging selected
groups of individual KaplaneMeier plots. Weighted
averaging is performed point-wise at the sampling points

2.3. Description of survival proportions
From each available KaplaneMeier curve we calculated
the proportion of patients free of disease progression at
6 months (6-months-PFS), and alive at 12 months (12-
months-OS), respectively. For the estimation of vari-
ability we used a formula suggested by Peto [16] for an
unbiased approximate estimate for the standard error
(SE) for the survival distribution S(t):
SEPeto½SðtÞ�Z
�SðtÞð1 � SðtÞÞ
N � CðtÞ
�1=2
C(t) equals the number of effectively censored data
up to the time point t; N is the number of patients at
study start. The empirical SE can be achieved by
replacing
S(t)
by
its
empirical
b
SðtÞ.
A
two-sided
approximate confidence interval for S(t) can be based
on a normal approximation and would thus read

N � CðtÞ

The number C(t) of censored data at 6 or 12 months,
respectively, usually was not explicitly mentioned in the
publications of the clinical trials selected for the present
study. However, in the published KaplaneMeier plots
the number of patients at risk was provided at the
bottom of each plot. These numbers were used for the
calculation of variability in survival proportions. In
some publications only the patient numbers at 4 and 8,
but not at 6 months were given; here we interpolated
linearly to estimate the number of patients at risk. The
formula for the calculation of an upper boundary for the
number of censored data C(t) based on the numbers r(t)
at risk when N is the number of patients at study start
(t Z 6 or 12 months) is
N � rðtÞ

 distinct time points (6 and 12 months, respectively). In
cases with more than one KaplaneMeier curve available
for a certain treatment strategy group, separated by first
or second line, we also calculated a mean and confidence
interval according to the random effects assumption
[17].
3. Results
3.1. Explorative analysis of survival outcomes
Thirty-five KaplaneMeier curves for either PFS or OS
or both were available from the publications of 17
clinical trials selected by the above mentioned criteria
(Table
1
and
Supplementary
Table
1)
[3,4,6e9,11,12,14,15,18e26]. After digitisation, the sur-
vival curves were newly grouped and displayed by
treatment line (first-line versus second or later lines) and
therapy strategy (chemotherapy, single-agent BRAF
inhibitor therapy, combination BRAF plus MEK in-
hibitor therapy, CTLA-4 inhibitor therapy, PD1 inhib-
itor therapy, combination CTLA-4 plus PD1 inhibitor
therapy), respectively (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2), to
allow a head-to-head explorative comparison. Trials
including first- as well as second-line therapy were
grouped as second-line trials.
Grouping of digitised KaplaneMeier survival curves
by therapy strategy showed a high concordance between
the
single
survival
curves
within
each
group
(Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). This high concordance
was found even in therapy strategy groups containing
different agents, e.g. for CTLA-4 inhibitors (ipilimu-
mab,
tremelimumab),
PD1
inhibitors
(nivolumab,
pembrolizumab), and BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib,
dabrafenib), respectively. Weighted averaging of sur-
vival curves was performed within each group as
described above and displayed separately for first-line
therapies as well as for later therapy lines (Fig. 1). For
first-line therapy strategy groups, averaged survival
proportions (percentages of PFS at 6 months and OS at
12 months, respectively) were calculated and displayed
in Supplementary Table 2.
3.2. Survival with MAPK pathway inhibitors
Mean survival curves obtained by weighted averaging
revealed the combination treatment with BRAF plus
MEK inhibitors clearly superior to BRAF inhibition
alone in first-line treatment PFS and OS as well as in
second-line or later PFS (Fig. 1AeC). The proportions
of patients free of disease progression at 6 months were
71.6% with BRAF plus MEK inhibition compared to
56.0% with BRAF inhibition alone; the proportions of
patients alive at 12 months were 74.5% compared to
64.4% (Supplementary Table 2). Second-line or later OS

 therapy were not available at the time point of this
analysis (Fig. 1D). BRAF inhibitor monotherapy led to
better survival outcomes than chemotherapy in first-line
treatment PFS (proportions of patients free of disease
progression
at
6
months
56.0%
versus
22.1%;
Supplementary Table 2) and OS (proportions of patients
alive at 12 months 64.4% versus 42.2%; Supplementary
Table 2) (Fig. 1A, B). In second-line or later therapy
settings no chemotherapy arms were used in recent
clinical trials; thus no survival data were available for
the PFS and OS explorative analysis (Fig. 1C, D).
3.3. Survival with immune checkpoint blockers
PD-1 inhibitors revealed a better survival outcome than
CTLA-4 inhibitors in all therapy settings, first-line PFS
and OS as well as second-line or later PFS and OS, as
obtained by weighted averaging (Fig. 1AeD). For the
first-line setting, the proportions of patients free of dis-
ease progression at 6 months were 51.0% with PD-1
inhibitors compared to 31.0% with CTLA-4 inhibitors;
the proportions of patients alive at 12 months were
71.9% compared to 50.1% (Supplementary Table 2).
PD-1 plus CTLA-4 inhibitor combination therapy
showed better survival data than PD-1 inhibitors alone
in first-line PFS (proportions of patients free of disease
progression
at
6
months
63.8%
versus
51.0%,
Supplementary Table 2; Fig. 1A). For all other therapy
settings up to now no survival data have been available
for this combination (Fig. 1BeD). CTLA-4 inhibition
resulted in an improved survival compared to chemo-
therapy, at least for first-line treatment PFS and OS
(Fig. 1A, B). The proportions of patients free of disease
progression at 6 months were 31.0% with CTLA-4 in-
hibition versus 22.1% with chemotherapy; the pro-
portions of patients alive at 12 months were 50.1%
versus 42.2% (Supplementary Table 2). For the second-
line setting, no survival data under chemotherapy were
available (Fig. 1C, D).
3.4. Comparison of survival with MAPK pathway
inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockers
In first-line therapy, weighted averaging revealed supe-
rior survival curves for the MAPK pathway blockade
with BRAF plus MEK inhibitor combination therapy
compared to immune checkpoint blockade with PD-1
inhibitors alone (PFS, OS; Fig. 1A, B) or in combina-
tion with CTLA-4 (PFS; Fig. 1A). The proportions of
patients free of disease progression at 6 months were
71.6% with BRAF plus MEK inhibition compared to
63.8% with CTLA-4 plus PD-1 inhibition and 51.0%
with PD-1 inhibition alone, respectively (Supplementary
Table
2).

 inhibition versus immune checkpoint blockers is clearly
visible during the first year after onset of treatment,
thereafter curves are crossing and the survival outcomes
of these treatment strategies roughly equal. Accordingly,
the proportions of patients alive at 12 months were
74.5% with BRAF plus MEK inhibitor treatment versus
71.9% with PD-1 blockade (Supplementary Table 2).
In the second-line setting, weighted average PFS
curves revealed a superiority of BRAF plus MEK in-
hibitor combination therapy compared to PD-1 inhibi-
tion (Fig. 1C). For OS in this setting, up to now no data
are available for the combination therapy (Fig. 1D).
Survival under BRAF inhibitor monotherapy was su-
perior to that under CTLA-4 inhibition. This difference
in survival was more obvious in the first-line setting
(Fig. 1A, B) than in the second or later lines (Fig. 1C,
D). PFS and OS under BRAF inhibitor monotherapy is
superior to that under PD-1 inhibitor therapy within the
first 6 months of first-line therapy (Fig. 1A, B). After
this time period, survival curves cross, and PD-1 in-
hibitor therapy reveals a better long-term survival
compared to BRAF inhibition. In the second-line or
later setting, weighted average survival curves of both
treatment strategies, BRAF and PD-1 inhibitor mono-
therapy, run equally during the first 3e6 months of
treatment (Fig. 1C, D). Thereafter, PD-1 inhibition
clearly shows superior long-term survival in both, PFS
and
OS,
as
compared
with
single-agent
BRAF
inhibition.
4. Discussion
A tremendous improvement in the survival of advanced
metastatic melanoma patients has been achieved by the
recently developed therapy strategies of kinase in-
hibitors as well as immune checkpoint blockers. In this
regard, combination regimens of BRAF and MEK in-
hibitors proved to be superior to single-agent regimens
with BRAF inhibitors. Within the group of immune
checkpoint blockers, the first head-to-head comparative
trials (KEYNOTE-006; CheckMate-067) demonstrated
the PD-1 inhibitors to prolong survival as compared to
CTLA-4 inhibition with ipilimumab [24]. Moreover, for
PFS the combination treatment with PD1 inhibitors
plus ipilimumab tends to be superior to PD1 inhibition
alone, at least in certain patient subgroups (CheckMate-
067; CheckMate-069) [26]. For OS there are no data yet
available for evaluation.
However, there still are no data available from clin-
ical trials testing BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors head-
to-head with checkpoint blockers. In this regard, our
presentation of KaplaneMeier survival curves grouped
by matching inclusion criteria, and superimposed by
weighted averaging shows clear and informative trends.
Using this methodology, we found that the combination
of BRAF plus MEK inhibitors provides very similar
results in terms of survival as PD1 inhibition as a single-
agent or in combination with ipilimumab. These two
treatment strategies, BRAF plus MEK inhibition and
PD1 plus or minus CTLA-4 inhibition, were superior to
all other therapy modalities investigated. Interestingly,
this superiority became evident in PFS and OS in the
first-line as well as in second and later-line settings. The
second best survival curves resulted from single-agent
BRAF inhibitor therapies, which were clearly inferior
to BRAF plus MEK inhibitor combinations, and also to
PD1 inhibitors, respectively. The poorest survival was
observed with single-agent ipilimumab and with any
type of chemotherapy, respectively, with ipilimumab
showing slightly better results than chemotherapy.
Importantly, due to the rapid development of new
therapeutics, times of study conduct are of high proba-
bility to impact survival outcomes in melanoma pa-
tients.
In
specific,
the
availability
of
subsequent
treatments which could prolong OS differed during the
last years; e.g. many BRAF inhibitor trials were con-
ducted before PD1 blockers became available. It should
also be noted, that long-term follow-up data are only
available for ipilimumab to indicate that the same 20%
of patients alive at 3 years are alive at 5 years and
beyond [10]. This longevity of benefit has yet to be
established for PD-1 or BRAF inhibitor-based treat-
ments. Since the clinical use of ipilimumab started much
earlier than that of PD1 blockers, long-term survival
data for anti-PD1 of 3 years and longer are not yet
available.
Finally, it should be noted, that the results of this
descriptive comparative analysis have to be interpreted
with caution. In general, the inclusion criteria of the
different trials were similar (no active or untreated brain
metastases, no ocular primary, ECOG
Q3
performance
state 0 or 1), Supplementary Table 1. However, differ-
ences in these criteria were present, such as a different
definition of brain metastasis control or the possibility
to treat beyond progression. These deviations between
trials may have led to different patient selections, and
thus may have influenced patient’s survival outcomes.
Additionally, the percentages of patients with poor
prognostic markers like elevated serum LDH
Q4
, impaired
overall performance status, or higher M category,
differed significantly between trials even if their inclu-
sion criteria were similar (Supplementary Table 1). Due
to the descriptive nature of the comparisons done by us,
no statistical tests were applied.
The conclusions drawn from clear differences be-
tween survival curves resulting from different treatment
strategies allow a first preliminary transfer into the
routine clinical setting of decision-making in advanced
metastatic melanoma patients. Notably, the survival
curves taken from single clinical trials and grouped by

 distinct therapy strategies revealed a very high concor-
dance, even if different agents were used. However, to
confirm these first trends for implementation into an
individualised treatment of melanoma patients, data
from prospective clinical trials comparing the different
treatment strategies head-to-head have to be awaited.
From our perspective, this explorative comparison
showing the combination of BRAF and MEK kinase
inhibitors as similarly effective as PD1 immune check-
point blockade towards survival, although of limited
validity, highlights the good performance of the targeted
therapy approach based on BRAF kinase inhibitors in
advanced melanoma. This is of special importance in the
current times where immunotherapy dominates the
therapeutic field of advanced melanoma.
