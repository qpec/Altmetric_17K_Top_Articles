Abstract How long neural information is stored in a local brain area reflects functions of that
region and is often estimated by the magnitude of the autocorrelation of intrinsic neural signals in
the area. Here, we investigated such intrinsic neural timescales in high-functioning adults with
autism and examined whether local brain dynamics reflected their atypical behaviours. By analysing
resting-state fMRI data, we identified shorter neural timescales in the sensory/visual cortices and a
longer timescale in the right caudate in autism. The shorter intrinsic timescales in the sensory/visual
areas were correlated with the severity of autism, whereas the longer timescale in the caudate was
associated with cognitive rigidity. These observations were confirmed from neurodevelopmental
perspectives and replicated in two independent cross-sectional datasets. Moreover, the intrinsic
timescale was correlated with local grey matter volume. This study shows that functional and
structural atypicality in local brain areas is linked to higher-order cognitive symptoms in autism.

Introduction
How long neural information is likely to be stored in a neural area is a fundamental functional prop-
erty of the local brain region (Chen et al., 2015; Hasson et al., 2015; Himberger et al., 2018), and
has been quantified as temporal receptive window (Hasson et al., 2008; Chaudhuri et al., 2015;
Honey et al., 2012; Lerner et al., 2011; Stephens et al., 2013; Yeshurun et al., 2017), temporal
receptive field (Cavanagh et al., 2016), or intrinsic neural timescale (Murray et al., 2014;
Kiebel et al., 2008; Gollo et al., 2015; Cocchi et al., 2016). Computational studies propose that
such neural timescales should show a rostrocaudal gradient in the brains (Kiebel et al., 2008) and
that densely interconnected central regions, such as prefrontal and parietal areas, should have
slower timescales compared to peripheral sensory areas (Chaudhuri et al., 2015; Gollo et al.,
2015). These proposals are supported by empirical observations. Human neuroimaging and
macaque electrophysiology studies show that neural timescales tend to be longer in frontal and pari-
etal areas compared to sensory-related regions (Honey et al., 2012; Stephens et al., 2013;
Murray et al., 2014; Ogawa and Komatsu, 2010), and suggested that such a prolonged neural
timescale enables these higher-order brain cortices to integrate diverse information for robust sen-
sory perception (Hasson et al., 2008; Lerner et al., 2011; Stephens et al., 2013; Yeshurun et al.,

(Hasson et al., 2015; Murray et al., 2014; Bernacchia et al., 2011), and accurate decision making
(Cavanagh et al., 2016; Runyan et al., 2017). A recent brain stimulation study directly demonstrates
that such a hierarchy of the intrinsic timescale is closely related to functional interactions between
lower and higher brain regions (Cocchi et al., 2016). The heterogeneity of the neural timescale is
considered to be a basis of the functional hierarchy in the brain (Chen et al., 2015; Hasson et al.,

Kukushkin and Carew, 2017; Friston and Kiebel, 2009).
Given such fundamental roles of local neural dynamics in highly-organised information processing
in the brain, we hypothesised that atypical intrinsic neural timescales should be observed in autism.
In fact, the core symptoms of this prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder — challenges in socio-
communicational skills and repetitive, restricted behaviours (RRB) — are often linked to atypical
information processing (Happe
´ and Frith, 2006; Palmer et al., 2017; Booth and Happe
´, 2018):
weak coherence theory suggests that autism spectral disorder (ASD) is associated with impairments
of the global integration of diverse information and over-enhancement of individual inputs
(Happe
´ and Frith, 2006; Booth and Happe
´, 2018); a recent Bayesian view also attributes autism to
overweighing of local sensory information (Palmer et al., 2017; Lawson et al., 2017). These theories
suggest that measures of local neural dynamics — such as intrinsic neural timescales — should be
linked to the symptomatology of individuals with ASD.
Despite such theoretical implications, no study has investigated intrinsic timescales of neural sig-
nals in autism. Here, we aimed at exploring this local neural property in the brains of high-function-
ing individuals with ASD and examining its associations with the core symptoms of this condition.
Results
First, we introduced a measurement of the intrinsic neural timescales for resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI)
signals,
and
validated
it
using
simultaneous
EEG-fMRI
data
(Deligianni
et
al.,
2016;
Deligianni et al., 2014). We then applied the index to a rsfMRI dataset recorded from high-function-
ing adults with ASD and its demographically-matched controls, and searched for brain regions
whose atypical neural timescales were associated with the ASD symptoms. Next, using a longitudinal
rsfMRI dataset collected from adolescent children, we examined developmental trajectories of the
local neural dynamics of these regions. Finally, we explored neuroanatomical bases of the intrinsic
eLife digest Autism is a brain disorder that affects how people interact with others. It occupies
a spectrum, with severe autism at one end and high-functioning autism at the other. People with
severe autism usually have intellectual impairments and little spoken language. Those with high-
functioning autism have average or above average IQ, but struggle with more subtle aspects of
communication, such as body language. As well as social difficulties, many individuals with autism
show repetitive behaviors and have narrow interests.
The brains of people with autism process information differently to those of people without
autism. The brain as a whole shows less coordinated activity in autism, for example. But whether
individual brain regions themselves also work differently in autism is unclear. Watanabe et al. set out
to answer this question by using a brain scanner to compare the resting brain activity of high-
functioning people with autism to that of people without autism.
In both groups, networks of brain regions increased and decreased their activity in predictable
patterns. But in individuals with autism, sensory areas of the brain showed more random activity
than in individuals without autism. The most random activity occurred in those with the most severe
autism. This suggests that the brains of people with autism cannot hold onto and process sensory
input for as long as those of neurotypical people. By contrast, a brain region called the caudate
showed the opposite pattern, being more predictable in individuals with autism. The most
predictable caudate activity occurred in those individuals with the most inflexible, repetitive
behaviors. These differences in this neural randomness appear to result from changes in the
structure of the individual brain regions.
The findings of Watanabe et al. suggest that changes in the structure and activity of small brain
regions give rise to complex symptoms in autism. If these differences also exist in young children,
they could help doctors diagnose autism earlier. Future studies should investigate whether the
differences in brain activity cause the symptoms of autism. If so, it may be possible to treat the
symptoms by changing brain activity, for example, by applying magnetic stimulation to the scalp.

 neural timescales. The reproducibility of our findings was tested using two independent MRI
datasets.
Timescales of resting-state fMRI signals
Based on previous macaque studies (Chaudhuri et al., 2015; Cavanagh et al., 2016; Murray et al.,
2014; Bernacchia et al., 2011), we calculated an intrinsic neural timescale by assessing the magni-
tude of autocorrelation of the resting-state brain activity. First, we estimated the sum of autocorrela-
tion function (ACF) values in the initial positive period of the ACF (i.e., the sum of the area of the
green bars in Figure 1a). The upper limit of this period was set at the discrete time lag value just
before the one where the ACF became non-positive for the first time. To adjust for differences in
the temporal resolution of the neural data, we then multiplied the obtained sum of ACF values by
the repetition time (TR) of the fMRI recording. This product was used as an index for intrinsic neural
timescales.
This definition was validated by comparing the fMRI-based timescale index to that based on neu-
ral
data
with
a
higher
temporal
resolution
(here,
simultaneously
recorded
EEG
data
(Deligianni et al., 2016; Deligianni et al., 2014); Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The fMRI-based
timescales were strongly correlated with those based on the gamma-band EEG signals (adjusted
R2 = 0.71; Figure 1b; see Figure 1—figure supplement 2 for other EEG bands). In addition, when
the EEG signals were convolved with the hemodynamic response function (HRF), the intrinsic time-
scales based on the HRF-convolved EEG signals became closer to those based on fMRI signals
(adjusted R2 = 0.61; Figure 1c).
Figure 1. Definition and validation of intrinsic timescales based on resting-state fMRI data. (a) To estimate an intrinsic neural timescale of an fMRI
signal, we first calculated the sum of autocorrelation function (ACF) values of the signals in the initial positive period of the ACF. The period is the area
under the ACF up to the time lag value just before the one where the ACF becomes non-positive for the first time as the time lag increases. We then
multiplied the obtained area under the ACF by the repetition time (TR), which defined the index for the intrinsic timescale. Open circles in the right
panel show the empirical ACF values for the resting-state fMRI data. TR was 2 s in the current dataset. (b and c) fMRI-based intrinsic timescale scores
were highly correlated with those calculated from simultaneously recorded EEG data (gamma band, adjusted R2 = 0.71; panel b; see Figure 1—figure
supplement 2 for other EEG bands). The fMRI-based timescales were different from those based on the EEG data by two orders of magnitude. When
we convolved the EEG signals with the hemodynamic response function (HRF), the intrinsic timescales based on EEG data showed the same magnitude
as those based on fMRI data (panel c). A circle represents a combination of a brain region and a participant. The fMRI-based intrinsic timescale

 Intrinsic neural timescales in adults with ASD
Based on this formulation, we compared the intrinsic neural timescale between 25 high-functioning
adults with ASD and 26 age-/sex-/IQ-matched typically developing (TD) individuals (Table 1)
(Di Martino et al., 2014).
Both ASD and TD groups showed a similar whole-brain pattern of intrinsic neural timescales: lon-
ger timescales in frontal and parietal cortices and shorter timescales in sensorimotor, visual, and
auditory areas (Figure 2a). This observation is consistent with previous reports about a hierarchal
topography of timescales of local neural activity in brains of mice (Runyan et al., 2017), monkeys
(Chaudhuri et al., 2015; Murray et al., 2014; Ogawa and Komatsu, 2010), and humans
(Hasson et al., 2008; Honey et al., 2012; Lerner et al., 2011; Stephens et al., 2013;
Yeshurun et al., 2017).
However,
we
also
identified
significant
differences
between
the
two
groups
(Table
2;
PFDR <0.05). Individuals with ASD had a significantly shorter intrinsic timescale than TD individuals in
bilateral postcentral gyri, right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), right middle insula, bilateral middle tem-
poral gyri (MTG), and right inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) (Figure 2b and d), whereas the intrinsic
timescale in the right caudate was significantly larger in the ASD group (Figure 2c and e).
Associations between intrinsic timescales and core symptoms of ASD
We then tested for any associations between the observed atypical intrinsic neural timescales and
the severity of autism, as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)
(Lord et al., 1989). Because previous studies indicate that atypical neural information processing is a
common basis for various ASD symptoms (Happe
´ and Frith, 2006; Belmonte et al., 2004;
Watanabe and Rees, 2017), we first examined associations between the neural timescales and the
overall severity of this disorder (ADOS total scores). When no significant link was found in this analy-
sis, we then calculated associations between the neural timescales and specific core symptoms.
Of the seven brain regions of interest (ROIs) whose intrinsic timescales were shorter in the ASD
group (Figure 2b and d, Table 2), the bilateral postcentral gyri and right IOG showed negative cor-
relations between the intrinsic timescale and overall severity of autism (rho � –0.49, Puncorrected <0.01,
PFDR <0.05; Figure 3a).
The right caudate, a single ROI whose intrinsic timescale was significantly longer in the ASD
group (Figure 2e), did not show such an association with the overall ADOS score (rho = 0.19,
p=0.34). However, its intrinsic timescale was longer in individuals with more severe repetitive,
restricted behaviours (RRB), as measured by ADOS RRB scores (F3,21 = 9.9, p<0.001, main effect of
ADOS RRB in a one-way ANOVA; Spearman’s rho = 0.57, p=0.002; Figure 3b).
These brain-symptom associations were preserved even when we conducted this association anal-
ysis in a more statistically rigorous manner (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). That is, we applied the

 same ROI sets to two independent fMRI datasets (ETH Zu
¨ rich and Indiana University datasets; Sup-
plementary Table 1 in Supplementary file 1) that were not used in the ROI search, and found nega-
tive correlations between the intrinsic timescales and the ADOS total scores in the bilateral
postcentral gyri and right IOG (rho � –0.60) and a significant association between the intrinsic time-
scale and the ADOS RRB scores in the right caudate (F � 6.0, p�0.03 in one-way ANOVAs).
Development of the intrinsic neural timescale in autism
We then examined whether these observations from adults with ASD could be seen in children with
ASD. To this end, we analysed a longitudinal fMRI dataset recorded from adolescent children (two
MRI scans for each participant, interval of the two scans = 2.8 ± 0.4 years for ASD children, 3.0 ± 0.4
years for TD children; Supplementary Table 2 in Supplementary file 1) (Di Martino et al., 2014).
We traced the developmental trajectories of the intrinsic neural timescales of the four ROIs whose
intrinsic timescales were atypical in the ASD group and associated with the severity of the symp-
toms. These four ROIs were defined as clusters found in the whole-brain analysis using the adult
fMRI data (Figure 2, Table 2).
In adolescence, we found that the intrinsic neural timescale in bilateral postcentral gyri and right
IOG was consistently shorter in individuals with ASD compared to TD individuals (F1,31 > 9.0, Puncor-
rected <0.005, PFDR <0.05, main effect of diagnosis in repeated-measures two-way ANOVAs with a
diagnosis [ASD/TD] � scan order [1 st/2nd] structure; Figure 4a). In addition, the decreases in the

associations between the intrinsic timescale and the overall severity of ASD in the bilateral postcentral gyri and
right IOG but not in the bilateral middle temporal gyri (MTGs), right middle insula, and right inferior parietal
lobule (IPL). The intrinsic timescales of the regions represent the averages of the timescale values within the
clusters. The statistical threshold for the seven brain-behaviour comparisons was corrected by FDR. (b) The intrinsic
neural timescale in the right caudate was not correlated with the overall severity of autism, but was associated with
that of repetitive, restricted behaviours (RRB) of ASD.

 intrinsic timescale in these areas during this period were predictive of the increases in the overall
severity of autism (rho � –0.68, Puncorrected <0.003, PFDR <0.05; Figure 4b).
In contrast, the intrinsic timescale in the right caudate was consistently longer in the group with
ASD during adolescence (F1,31 = 18.2, Puncorrected <0.001, main effect of diagnosis in a repeated-
measures two-way ANOVA; Figure 4c), and the increase in the intrinsic timescale in this region was
associated with progression of RRB symptoms (F2,8 = 10.3, p=0.006, main effect of ADOS RRB
changes in a one-way ANOVA; Figure 4d).
These longitudinal observations are consistent with the cross-sectional findings (Figures 2 and
3) and suggest that autistic atypicality of temporal neural processing in local brain areas may already
occur before adolescence.
Associations between intrinsic neural timescale and local grey matter
volume
Finally, we explored possible neuroanatomical bases for (or consequences of) intrinsic neural time-
scales by examining relationship with local grey matter volumes (GMVs). We focused on GMV
because theoretically, an increase in neuronal density, which is measured by GMV (Kanai and Rees,
2011), would enhance recurrent neural network activity, and then enlarge the autocorrelation
strength in the neural signals.
This theoretical assumption was validated by comparisons between intrinsic timescales and GMV
across 360 brain areas (Glasser et al., 2016): at a group level, these functional and anatomical prop-
erties were positively correlated with each other (TD: r = 0.40, ASD: r = 0.38, p<10–5; Figure 5a).
Furthermore, the significant correlations were robustly observed at a single-participant level as well
(TD: r � 0.29, ASD: r � 0.28, p<10–5; Figure 5b). This association was also seen in the four brain
regions whose atypical intrinsic neural timescale was associated with symptoms of autism (r > 0.52,
p�0.005; Figure 5c).

investigated in a longitudinal fMRI dataset obtained from adolescent children (Supplementary Table 2 in Supplementary file 1) (Di Martino et al.,

children with ASD. Each bold curve indicates the quadratic curve fitted to individual data points for each group. Each dotted line represents a

timescale was correlated with progression of RRB symptoms.

GMVs of the three brain regions showing atypical reduction in the intrinsic timescale in autism were significantly smaller in the ASD than the TD group.
In contrast, the GMV of the right caudate, which had an atypically longer intrinsic timescale in autism, was larger in the ASD group. (e) We conducted
mediation analyses to examine the hypothesis that atypicality in the intrinsic timescale is one of the mediators linking atypical GMV and symptoms of
autism. The analyses used the GMV, intrinsic timescale, and ADOS score as an independent variable, mediator variable, and dependent variable,
respectively. ‘a” indicates effects of GMV on the intrinsic timescale, and ‘b” denotes effects of the intrinsic timescale on ADOS scores. ‘g” represents
direct effects of GMV on ADOS scores, and ‘a � b” indicates indirect effects. The statistical significance of the indirect effects (i.e., P values for ‘a � b”)
and the insignificance of the GMV-ADOS direct effects (i.e., P values for ‘g”) support the working hypothesis.

 Given these findings together with atypical GMVs in the four brain regions in individuals with
ASD (t49 >3.0, Puncorrected �0.004 in two-sample t-tests, PFDR <0.05; Figure 5d), we can infer that
intrinsic neural timescale is a mediator linking atypical GMV and ASD symptoms. This inference was,
in fact, consistent with results of mediation analyses (Figure 5e).

In both datasets, ASD group yielded atypically shorter intrinsic timescales in the bilateral postcen-
tral gyri and right IOG (t � 4.0, PFDR <0.05; Figure 5—figure supplements 1a and 2a) and a longer
intrinsic timescale in the right caudate (t = 3.9, PFDR <0.05; Figure 5—figure supplements 1b and
2b). The shorter intrinsic timescale in the bilateral postcentral gyri and right IOG was correlated with
the overall severity of ASD (rho � –0.51; Figure 5—figure supplements 1c and 2c), whereas the lon-
ger intrinsic timescale in the caudate was associated with RRB symptoms (p<0.028 in one-way
ANOVAs; Spearman’s rho �0.74; Figure 5—figure supplements 1d and 2d). Moreover, the correla-
tions between the intrinsic timescale and GMV were also replicated (r � 0.49; Figure 5—figure sup-
plements 1e and 2e).
Discussion
We investigated the intrinsic neural timescale, whose length is closely related to the functional hier-
archy in the brain (Hasson et al., 2015; Murray et al., 2014; Cocchi et al., 2016), in high-function-
ing individuals with autism. By calculating the time-dependent magnitude of autocorrelation function
in resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) signals, we found that in adults with ASD, the intrinsic timescale was
significantly shorter in the bilateral postcentral gyri and right inferior occipital gyrus, and longer in
the right caudate. The shorter intrinsic timescale in these primary sensory/visual areas in autism was
correlated with the overall severity of autism. The longer intrinsic timescale in the caudate in autism
was associated with the severity of repetitive, restricted behaviours. Moreover, this temporal prop-
erty in local neural signals was linked to local grey matter volumes (GMVs). These findings indicate
the possibility that functional and structural properties in local brain areas could have a critical influ-
ence on higher-order cognitive symptoms in autism.
Furthermore, we investigated the validity of these observations on longitudinal neuroimaging
data recorded from adolescents with ASD. We found atypical development of the intrinsic timescale
during adolescence in autism (Figure 4a and c) and identified significant associations between such
atypical neural development and progression of ASD symptoms (Figure 4b and d). These findings
imply that such atypicality in the temporal characteristics of local neural activity may be one of the
basic neuro-aetiologies of autism, which needs to be tested using data collected from much younger
children with ASD in future studies.
The association between the intrinsic timescales and GMVs is theoretically reasonable. Large
GMVs are considered to indicate a high density of neurons in local brain regions (Kanai and Rees,
2011), which is thought to be accompanied with more synapses (Cullen et al., 2010) and greater
synaptic weights (Perin et al., 2011). Moreover, computational studies suggest that such a high neu-
ronal and synaptic density should increase reciprocal connections within the areas and enhance local
clustering (Perin et al., 2013). Given that spontaneous neural activity largely depends on such recur-
rent neural networks (Ikegaya et al., 2004), resting-state neural activities of brain regions with large
GMVs would show more repetition patterns and larger autocorrelations. Although future studies
have to directly examine this hypothesis, this logic accounts for the significant correlations between
the local neural dynamics and local neuroanatomical structures.
Some human neuroimaging researches examined autistic local neural dynamics in the sensory-
related areas and reported observations that are consistent with the current findings. For example,
fMRI studies that investigated intra-participant variability of brain signals across time found atypically
large signal variability in the prefrontal region (Dinstein et al., 2011), somato-sensory area
(Haigh et al., 2015; Dinstein et al., 2012), auditory area (Haigh et al., 2015; Dinstein et al., 2012),
and primary visual cortex (Dinstein et al., 2012; Dinstein et al., 2010; Milne, 2011) in individuals
with ASD. In particular, one study found that the severity of ASD was significantly correlated with

Neuroscience
 such atypical signal variability in the sensory/visual areas (Dinstein et al., 2012). If we can assume
that such large variability of local brain signals indicates more random brain activity and conse-
quently yields weak autocorrelations, these previous reports can be interpreted as being consistent
with the current findings.
In contrast, local neural dynamics in the caudate in autism were poorly understood. In fact, the
neuroanatomical association between the subcortical region and the RRB symptoms was reported in
previous structural MRI studies (Langen et al., 2014; Langen et al., 2009; Langen et al., 2007;
Hollander et al., 2005; Schuetze et al., 2016), which is consistent with the current observation
about the caudate. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior research has been conducted
on intrinsic neural timescales or signal variability of the caudate in autism.
A recent review has suggested that the intrinsic timescale and TRW is not an artefact of neuroim-
aging signals but closely associated with an ability of local brain areas to pool, normalise, and com-
plete information (Himberger et al., 2018). In particular, for sensory information processing, a
longer neural timescale is considered to make brain responses more robust against fluctuations in
sensory inputs and enable steady and consistent perception (Himberger et al., 2018; Honey et al.,
2012; Murray et al., 2014). Given this, we speculate that the atypically short intrinsic timescale in
the primary sensory/visual cortices observed in the ASD group (Figures 2b and 4a) might potentially
be one of neural bases of perceptual hyper-sensitivity often seen in autism (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013).
This rsfMRI study did not adopt a formulation that has been used to measure neural timescales in
previous human fMRI studies (Hasson et al., 2015; Hasson et al., 2008; Lerner et al., 2011;
Stephens et al., 2013; Yeshurun et al., 2017; Gauthier et al., 2012), because this definition of neu-
ral timescale — so-called temporal receptive window (TRW) — was designed for task-related brain
activity data and cannot be directly applied to resting-state fMRI data. Instead, based on previous
non-human
electrophysiology
studies
(Cavanagh
et
al.,
2016;
Murray
et
al.,
2014;
Bernacchia et al., 2011; Runyan et al., 2017), we defined the intrinsic neural timescale as the mag-
nitude of autocorrelation of brain activity. In addition, to reduce adverse effects of the low sampling
rates of fMRI recording, we did not conduct curve fitting to the autocorrelation coefficients as
electrophysiological work did (Cavanagh et al., 2016; Murray et al., 2014; Runyan et al., 2017);
we simply calculated the area under the autocorrelation function (ACF) to estimate the autocorrela-
tion strength (Figure 1a).
We validated this definition of the intrinsic neural timescales using the simultaneously recorded
EEG-fMRI data. Although the fMRI-based neural timescale was different from the EEG-based one by
two orders of magnitude, the two measures were significantly correlated with each other (Figure 1b
and Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Moreover, such a difference would be reasonable because an
EEG signal is likely to peak ~100 ms after a stimulus onset and an fMRI signal — a product of neuro-
vascular coupling (Hillman, 2014; Martindale et al., 2003) — tends to take 5 ~ 10 s to peak
(Logothetis et al., 2001; Yes
¸ilyurt et al., 2008). In fact, when we convolved the EEG signals with
the hemodynamic response function (HRF) to take into account such neurovascular coupling, the
resultant intrinsic timescales based on HRF-convolved EEG signals were similar in the magnitude to
those based on the fMRI data (Figure 1c).
These EEG-fMRI comparisons indicate that the fMRI-based neural timescales represent an aspect
of local neuronal activity. However, it is beyond the scope of this study to conclude that such an
fMRI-based index reflects the same neuronal phenomena as those seen in previous electrophysiol-
ogy work that calculated neural timescales from spike activity data (Cavanagh et al., 2016;
Murray et al., 2014; Ogawa and Komatsu, 2010; Runyan et al., 2017). To clarify this issue, future
studies have to directly compare the fMRI-based neural timescales with those based on neuronal
spike activities that are collected simultaneously with fMRI data.
Our exploratory study identified significant associations between local brain dynamics and behav-
ioural tendencies in autism; however, biological mechanisms underlying this brain-behaviour link
remain unknown. Previous work proposed that such an atypical neural timescale may represent atyp-
ical
functional
hierarchy
in
information
processing
in
brains
(Himberger
et
al.,
2018;
Chaudhuri et al., 2015; Gjorgjieva et al., 2016). However, it is necessary to directly examine this
hypothesis by analysing task-related whole-brain activity in ASD populations. Future work also needs
to investigate mechanisms linking these local neural dynamics to atypical large-scale brain dynamics
seen in autism (Watanabe and Rees, 2017).

 Another limitation of this study is the relative homogeneity of the participants with ASD that we
have studied. To improve detectability, we limited the ASD group to high-functioning right-handed
adult males. Although we confirmed the main findings in an adolescent dataset (Figure 4), future
studies have to examine the current observations in different subsets of ASD cohorts.
This resting-state fMRI study investigated how long local brain areas can store information in indi-
viduals with autism and identified a shorter intrinsic timescale in the bilateral primary sensory/visual
cortices and a longer intrinsic timescale in the right caudate. This atypicality in local neural dynamics
was associated with the severity of autism and also correlated with local grey matter volumes.
Although these findings should be examined in larger and more diverse cohorts of individuals with
ASD, our work highlights the importance of investigating neural dynamics in neuro-psychiatric
disorders.
Materials and methods
Validation of the formulation of intrinsic neural timescale
We examined the validity of the current formulation of the intrinsic neural timescales by comparing
simultaneously recorded resting-state EEG and fMRI data that were shared in the Open Science
Framework (Deligianni et al., 2016; Deligianni et al., 2014).
Data for the validation test
Simultaneous EEG-fMRI data were collected from 17 healthy adults (6 females, 32.84 ± 8.1 years old)
at UCL under the ethical approval from the UCL Research Ethics Committee and informed consent
obtained from all the participants (Deligianni et al., 2016; Deligianni et al., 2014). The data were
obtained during rest, in which the participants were asked to open their eyes and remain awake with
fixating a white cross on a black background.
EEG data processing for the validation test
EEG data were recorded by an MRI-compatible EEG system with 64 channels (BrainCap MR, Ger-
many) and were preprocessed in MATLAB (MathWorks, Inc) and EEGLAB (Delorme and Makeig,
2004) (sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/).
First, the EEG data were referenced to the average of all the electrodes, and downsampled to
250 Hz. After conducting band-pass filtering (1–80 Hz), an optimal basis set (OBS) algorithm based
on principal component analysis (Niazy et al., 2005) was used to reduce the gradient artefacts
induced by fMRI scanning. Cardio-ballistic artefacts (CBAs) were reduced as follows (Jamison et al.,
2015; Liu et al., 2012): the alignment of the occipital CBAs was optimized with individual partici-
pant’s heartbeat; then, EEG components that were strongly correlated with the occipital CBAs were
identified and excluded by conducting independent component analysis (ICA) and calculating
mutual information. The remaining EEG artefacts induced by eye blinks, eye movements, and muscle
activity were removed by ICA. Next, we excluded epochs whose mean global field power was larger
than five standard deviations above the mean across the entire recording. Finally, to identify the
source location of these preprocessed EEG signals, we conducted source reconstructions of the
remaining ICA-components using DIPFIT2 function implemented in EEGLAB, and obtained MNI
coordinates for each of the independent components. To reduce ambiguity in the following fMRI
analysis, we excluded independent components whose whole-brain activity patterns did not show
clear laterality and thus whose sources were calculated to be in both brain hemispheres.
We confirmed that the remaining independent components of EEG data were effectively free
from fMRI-oriented gradient noise. In fact, the power spectrums of the EEG data showed that the
preprocessing procedures significantly reduced fMRI-induced noise in the EEG signals (Figure 1—
figure supplement 1a and b). Therefore, we used these EEG data for the intrinsic timescale
analysis.
We then filtered the preprocessed data to delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz), beta
(13–30 Hz), and gamma (30–80 Hz) bands, and calculated a Hilbert envelope amplitude for each
band wave (Deligianni et al., 2014). Using the envelope amplitudes, we estimated an intrinsic time-
scale in the same manner as used for resting-state fMRI signals (Figure 1a).

Neuroscience
 As for the gamma-band EEG signals, we convolved them with the hemodynamic response func-
tion (HRF) implemented in SPM12 and calculated the intrinsic timescales for the HRF-convolved EEG
data (Figure 1c).
MRI data processing for the validation test
The MRI data were collected in a 1.5T scanner (Avanto, Siemens) with a 12-channel head coil. Func-
tional data were recorded using EPI sequence (TR 2.16 s, TE 30 ms, FA 75˚, spatial resolution 3.3
mm cubic), and T1-weighted structural MRI data were also obtained (Deligianni et al., 2016;
Deligianni et al., 2014). For each participant, these MRI data were preprocessed in the same man-
ner as mentioned in the main text and calculated the intrinsic timescale for each voxel.
We then calculated the average intrinsic timescales for the brain areas corresponding to each
independent component of the EEG data. We defined the brain areas as a 4mm-radius sphere
whose centres were determined based on the MNI coordinates obtained in the source reconstruc-
tions of the EEG data. Through these analyses, we obtained fMRI-based intrinsic neural timescales
and compared them with EEG-based ones using linear regression analyses.
Participants for main analysis
This study used datasets shared in ABIDE (Di Martino et al., 2014). The main analysis was based on
a dataset recorded from 25 high-functioning adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 26 typi-
cally developing (TD) controls in University of Utah (Table 1). We chose this dataset because of its
largest size of high-functioning adults with ASD. We selected participants based on their age (�18
years old), sex (male), handedness (right-handed), IQ (full/verbal/performance IQ � 80), and head
motion during scanning (mean �3 mm). We focused on high-functioning right-handed male adults
to reduce heterogeneity across individuals with ASD (Jack and A Pelphrey, 2017).
The diagnosis of ASD was made based on structured interviews by a clinical expert for ASD in
accordance with ADOS and DSM-IV-TR (Lord et al., 1989). IQ was evaluated based on Wechsler
Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. Handedness was scored based on Edinburgh Handedness Inven-
tory. The data collection was approved by the local ethics committees (University of Utah IRB), and
all participants provided written consent.
MRI data and preprocessing
Resting-state and anatomical MRI data were collected using a 3.0T MRI scanner (Magnetom Trio,
Siemens; resting-state MRI, EPI sequence, TR 2 s, TE 28 ms, 40 slices, interleaved, FA 90˚, 3.4 � 3.4
� 3.0 mm; anatomical MRI, T1-weighted sequence, TR 2.3 s, TE 2.91 ms, FA 9˚, 1.0 � 1.0 � 1.2
mm). The resting-state MRI data were recorded for ~8 min for each participant, during which the
participants were asked to relax with their eyes open.
The resting-state MRI data were preprocessed with SPM12 (www.fil.ucl.ac.uk/spm). After discard-
ing the first five images, we performed realignment, unwarping, slice-timing correction, and normal-
isation to the standard template (ICBM 152). We then removed effects of head motion, white matter
signals, and cerebrospinal fluid signals by regression analyses, and finally conducted band-pass tem-
poral filtering (0.01–0.1 Hz). Note that we excluded participants whose mean head motions were
more than 3 mm. After this exclusion, there was no significant difference in the mean head motion
(p>0.1 in a two-sample t-test) and maximum/mean framewise displacement (FD) (maximum FD,
p>0.2; mean FD, p>0.4 in a two-sample t-test) between the TD and ASD groups.
Intrinsic neural timescale map
At a single-participant level, we used these preprocessed fMRI data to evaluate the intrinsic neural
timescale for each voxel as follows. First, we estimated an autocorrelation function (ACF) of the fMRI
signal of each voxel (time bin = TR), and then calculated the sum of ACF values in the initial period
where the ACF showed positive values (i.e., the sum of the area of the green bars in Figure 1a). The
upper limit of this period was set at the point where the ACF hits zero for the first time. After repeat-
ing this procedure for every voxel, we applied spatial smoothing to the brain map (Gaussian kernel,
full-width at half maximum = 8 mm) to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. We used this whole-brain
map as an intrinsic timescale map in which the value at each voxel is equal to the intrinsic neural
timescale of the brain region.

 After performing this calculation for all participants, we compared the intrinsic neural timescale
maps between ASD and TD groups using a random-effects model. We searched for brain areas
showing significant differences between the two groups (PFDR <0.05).
Brain-symptom associations
For the brain regions whose intrinsic neural timescale was significantly different between the individ-
uals with autism and the TD individuals (Table 2), we explored associations between their intrinsic
neural timescales and the ASD symptoms. Because atypical information processing in autism could
be a common basis for various ASD symptoms (Happe
´ and Frith, 2006; Belmonte et al., 2004;
Watanabe and Rees, 2017), we first calculated Spearman’s correlation coefficients between the
average intrinsic timescale in the regions and the overall severity of ASD (ADOS total score). The
ADOS total scores were defined by the sum of the ADOS social, ADOS communication, and ADOS
RRB scores. The regions of interest (ROIs) were defined as clusters found in the whole-brain analysis
stated above (Table 2), and an intrinsic timescale for each ROI was given by the average within the
corresponding cluster. The multiple comparisons between these brain regions were corrected by
FDR.
When we found no significant correlations between the neural timescales and ADOS total scores,
we calculated associations with the social and RRB symptoms, respectively. The social symptoms
were measured as the sum of the ADOS social scores and ADOS communication scores. The associa-
tions with the RRB symptoms were evaluated in one-way ANOVA because the ADOS RRB scores
were too sparse for an accurate correlation analysis.
Confirmation of the brain-symptom associations
To minimise any statistical dependence between the brain-symptom association analysis and the ROI
search, we repeated the association analysis by applying the same ROIs to two independent MRI
datasets that were not used in the ROI search. The data were collected in ETH Zu
¨ rich and Indiana
University and shared through ABIDE (Supplementary Table 1 in Supplementary file 1) (Di Martino
et al., 2014). The MRI data were collected under the approval of each local ethics committee in the
recording site and with the written informed consent of all the participants.
Participants were selected based on the same criteria as those in the main analysis (age �18 years
old, sex: male, handedness: right-handed, full/verbal/performance IQ � 80, and mean head
motion �3 mm). This selection excluded three ASD and nine TD individuals from the entire ETH Zu
¨ r-
ich dataset, and 11 ASD and 10 TD individuals from the Indiana University dataset. As a result, this
reproducibility test analysed 10 ASD and 15 TD individuals for the ETH Zu
¨ rich dataset and 9 ASD
and 10 TD individuals for the Indiana University dataset.
After conducting the same preprocessing as in the original analysis, we calculated an intrinsic neu-
ral timescale for each voxel, and extracted intrinsic timescales for the four ROIs that were defined in
the main analysis (Rt/Lt postcentral gyrus, Rt IOG, and Rt caudate). We then tested for the associa-
tions between the neural timescale at these ROIs and the severity of ASD.
Analysis of longitudinal developmental data
We examined the main findings from the perspective of neurodevelopment. To this end, we ana-
lysed longitudinal MRI data that were collected from 11 high-functioning adolescent children with
ASD and seven age-/sex-/IQ-matched TD children in University of California Los Angeles (two scans
for each participant; Supplementary Table 2 in Supplementary file 1).
The MRI data were preprocessed in the same manner as in the main analysis, and an intrinsic
timescale was estimated for each voxel at each time point in each participant. We then extracted
intrinsic timescales for the eight brain regions of interest (ROIs). The ROIs were defined as clusters
found in the main MRI analysis (Table 2), and the neural timescales of the regions were given by the
average within the corresponding clusters.
For each ROI, we compared developmental trajectories of the intrinsic timescale between ASD
and TD groups. In addition, we examined whether such developmental changes in the intrinsic time-
scale are related to changes in clinical severity of autism. We calculated the intrinsic timescale
changes by subtracting the intrinsic timescale at the first scan from that at the second scan. The
changes in ADOS scores were quantified in the same manner.

 Grey matter volume v intrinsic timescale
We investigated the neuroanatomical bases for intrinsic timescale by comparing grey matter volume
(GMV) to the temporal property of neural signals. GMV was calculated from structural MRI data
using SPM12 as follows: the MRI images were segmented into grey matter, white matter, and cere-
brospinal fluid using the New Segment Toolbox (Ashburner and Friston, 2005); using the DARTEL
Toolbox (Ashburner, 2007), the segmented grey matter images were aligned, warped to a template
space, resampled to 1.5 mm isotropic voxels, and registered to a participant-specific template.
At a whole-brain level, we first segmented these preprocessed grey matter images into 360 areas
according to a recently proposed multi-modal brain parcellation system (Glasser et al., 2016), and
extracted GMV from each area. By applying the same parcellation system to the whole-brain map of
the intrinsic timescale, we calculated average intrinsic timescale for each brain segment. We then
averaged these anatomical and functional metrics across participants for each brain segment, which
yielded a group-average GMV map and a group-average intrinsic timescale map for each group. By
comparing these maps with linear regression analyses, we estimated associations between intrinsic
timescale and GMV.
Next, we examined this function-anatomy correlation in the brain regions whose intrinsic time-
scale significantly deviated in autism and showed significant associations with the severity of ASD
symptoms.
Finally, we performed mediation analyses to investigate correlations between intrinsic timescale,
GMV, and severity of ASD after normalising these functional, anatomical, and clinical scores.
Reproducibility tests
We examined reproducibility of the main findings with the two independent MRI datasets that were
used in the confirmatory brain-symptom associations (see ‘Confirmation of the brain-symptom asso-
ciations’ in this Materials and methods section; Supplementary Table 1 in Supplementary file 1). We
repeated the same voxel-wise comparison of the intrinsic timescale between the ASD and TD
groups, calculated associations between the intrinsic timescale and clinical scores in the ASD group,
and assessed correlations with GMV.
