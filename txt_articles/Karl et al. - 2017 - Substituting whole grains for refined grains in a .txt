ABSTRACT
Background: The effect of whole grains on the regulation of energy
balance remains controversial.
Objective: We aimed to determine the effects of substituting whole
grains for refined grains, independent of body weight changes, on
energy-metabolism metrics and glycemic control.
Design: The study was a randomized, controlled, parallel-arm
controlled-feeding trial that was conducted in 81 men and postmeno-
pausal women [49 men and 32 women; age range: 40–65 y; body mass
index (in kg/m2): ,35.0]. After a 2-wk run-in period, participants were
randomly assigned to consume 1 of 2 weight-maintenance diets for
6 wk. Diets differed in whole-grain and fiber contents [mean 6 SDs:
whole grain–rich diet: 207 6 39 g whole grains plus 40 6 5 g dietary
fiber/d; refined grain–based diet: 0 g whole grains plus 21 6 3 g
dietary fiber/d] but were otherwise similar. Energy metabolism and
body-composition metrics, appetite, markers of glycemic control,
and gut microbiota were measured at 2 and 8 wk.
Results: By design, body weight was maintained in both groups.
Plasma alkylresorcinols, which are biomarkers of whole-grain intake,
increased in the whole grain–rich diet group (WG) but not in the refined
grain–based diet group (RG) (P-diet-by-time interaction , 0.0001).
Beta 6 SE changes (DWG compared with DRG) in the resting meta-
bolic rate (RMR) (43 6 25 kcal/d; P = 0.04), stool weight (76 6 12 g/d;
P , 0.0001), and stool energy content (57 6 17 kcal/d; P = 0.003), but
not in stool energy density, were higher in the WG. When combined, the
favorable energetic effects in the WG translated into a 92-kcal/d (95%
CI: 28, 156-kcal/d) higher net daily energy loss compared with that of
the RG (P = 0.005). Prospective consumption (P = 0.07) and glycemia
after an oral-glucose-tolerance test (P = 0.10) trended toward being
lower in the WG than in the RG. When nonadherent participants were
excluded, between-group differences in stool energy content and glucose
tolerance increased, and between-group differences in the RMR and
prospective consumption were not statistically significant.
Conclusion: These findings suggest positive effects of whole grains
on the RMR and stool energy excretion that favorably influence
energy balance and may help explain epidemiologic associations
between whole-grain consumption and reduced body weight and
adiposity. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT01902394.

INTRODUCTION
International recommendations call for an increased con-
sumption of whole grains together with a reduced consumption of
refined grains (1). These recommendations are the result of
accumulating evidence that has linked higher whole-grain intake
to reduced risks of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease
(2–5) and the consistent epidemiologic finding that individuals
who consume recommended amounts of whole grains ($3
servings or 48 g/d), compared with individuals who consume
few whole grains, have reduced BMI and adiposity and a lower

 prospective body weight gain (3–9). However, multiple ran-
domized controlled trials (10–16) and 2 recent meta-analyses of
clinical trials (4, 17) have largely been at odds with the epide-
miologic data, collectively having failed to find evidence to
support the favorable effects of whole grains on body weight. In
addition, although 2 clinical trials have reported favorable effects
of whole grains on adiposity (14, 15), the collective evidence base
has not been conclusive (10, 13, 17). Because of the many health
sequleae that are associated with overweight and obesity, there
has been substantial scientific interest in resolving these in-
consistencies to clarify the role of whole grains in weight man-
agement and the prevention of obesity.
Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to support the favor-
able epidemiologic association between whole-grain consumption
and BMI and adiposity. The superior nutritive value of whole grains
relative to that of refined grains and, in particular, the higher fiber
content, are thought to suppress appetite, improve glycemic control
and insulin sensitivity, and beneficially modulate the gut-microbiota
composition and activity (18–20). To test these mechanisms, clin-
ical trials have commonly incorporated whole-grain or refined-
grain foods into participant’s habitual diets, most often with the
use of multiple whole-grain sources with wheat as the primary
source. This approach has largely failed to show statistically sig-
nificant effects of whole grains on appetite or energy intake (10–12,
14, 15, 21–26), energy metabolism variables (15), or fasting gly-
cemia and insulin sensitivity (10–12, 14, 15, 21, 23, 24, 26).
However, a critical limitation of this evidence base has been the
relative absence of studies that have provided fully controlled diets
to participants. In addition, the few controlled-feeding studies that
have been conducted have been highly heterogeneous in study
populations, intervention durations, and designs and the types of
whole grains studied (13, 16, 27, 28). These factors may explain
why favorable effects of whole grains on insulin sensitivity (27),
fasting glucose (13), and appetite (16, 27) have been reported in
some but not all (13, 16, 27, 28) trials. The heterogeneity also
underlies the recognized need for additional well-controlled studies
that use strict dietary control to more definitively elucidate the
effects of the dietary substitution of whole grains for refined grains
on mechanisms that influence BMI and adiposity (5, 17, 19).
We measured variables of energy metabolism, appetite, gly-
cemic control, and stool-microbiota composition during an 8-wk
randomized, controlled, provided-food trial that was designed to
examine the metabolic and immunologic effects of substituting
whole grains for refined grains in the diet. We hypothesized that
the substitution of whole grains for refined grains within a weight-
maintaining diet would have broadly beneficial effects on energy
regulation including appetite suppression, an increased metabolic
rate and energy loss in the stool, and improved glycemia.
METHODS
This trial was conducted at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition
Research Center on Aging at Tufts University between May 2012 and
September 2014 and received approval from the Tufts University
Health Sciences Institutional Review Board. All participants gave
written informed consent before participating and received a stipend.
This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01902394. In this
article, we report on secondary study outcomes. Primary study out-
comes have been reported elsewhere and included immune-function
variables and markers of inflammation (29).
Study design
Nonsmoking men and postmenopausal women aged 40–65 y
with BMI (in kg/m2) between 20 and 35 were recruited from the
Boston, Massachusetts, area with the use of direct mailing, social
media, and posted advertisements. Of 1714 total respondents, 319
individuals attended an in-person screening visit. The 103 par-
ticipants who were enrolled in the study were weight stable, re-
ported consuming a low-fiber diet (men: ,7 g/1000 kcal; women:
,8 g/1000 kcal) for $2 wk before enrollment, abstained from the
use of probiotic or prebiotic supplements for $2 wk before en-
rollment, and also abstained from the use of all nutritional sup-
plements other than calcium and vitamin D for $1 mo before
enrollment. Exclusion criteria were as follows: oral antibiotic use
within 3 mo of enrollment; consumption of .2 alcoholic bever-
ages/d; abnormal liver- and kidney-function tests; fasting blood
glucose concentrations $125 mg/dL; diabetes; gastrointestinal
disease; autoimmune disease; cancer; regular use of medications
that affect energy metabolism, glycemia, appetite, or bowel habits;
and the use of immunosuppressants, proton-pump inhibitors, H2
blockers, or prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medica-
tions. Participants with hypertension or a medical history of car-
diovascular, liver, or renal disease were admitted if the condition
was controlled with medication.
The study was a randomized, single-blind, parallel-arm con-
trolled trial. All food and beverages were provided throughout the
8-wk study. Participants collected food from and ate breakfast at
the research center 3 times/wk and were instructed to consume all
of the provided food and nothing else, to return any uneaten food,
and to maintain habitual physical activity patterns. Dietary staff
were not blinded to group assignments, but study investigators,
outcome assessors, and data analysts were blinded until primary
analyses were complete. Participants were not explicitly informed
of their group assignments, but the diets differed in appearance.
The initial 2 wk of the study served as a run-in phase during
which all participants consumed the same diet, and weight-
maintenance energy needs were determined. Nonfasting body
weight was measured 3 times/wk during this phase and throughout
the study to monitor weight stability. If a weight change $1 kg was
observed, prescribed energy intake was adjusted to prevent ad-
ditional weight loss or gain. After the run-in period, participants
were randomly assigned by the study statistician with the use of a
computer program. During the subsequent 6 wk, participants were
provided with either a weight-maintaining whole grain–rich diet
[whole grain–rich diet group (WG)]10 or a weight-maintaining
refined grain–based diet (weight-maintaining refined grain–
based diet group (RG)] that did not contain any whole grains.
Study diets and dietary adherence
The run-in diet contained no whole grains and was designed
to be consistent with the mean dietary intakes of US adults.
The weight-maintaining whole grain–rich diet and weight-
maintaining refined grain–based diet were designed to differ in
whole-grain and fiber contents but to be otherwise similar in
energy and macronutrient compositions, types of provided

 foods, and meal structures (Table 1, Supplemental Table 1).
The diets differed primarily in whether grains were derived from
whole-grain or refined-grain sources, which was achieved by
replacing refined grain–containing foods with similar whole grain–
containing foods. The primary whole grain in the whole grain–rich
diet was wheat, but oats and brown rice were also included. Both
diets met Dietary Reference Intakes for all vitamins, minerals, and
essential fatty acids. Diet compositions were analyzed with the use
of Nutrition Data System for Research v.2011 software (Nutrition
Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota).
Diet adherence was assessed by reviewing daily food checklists,
which were maintained by the participants, body weight monitoring,
and the measurement of plasma alkylresorcinol homolog concen-
trations (19:0, 21:0, and 23:0), which are predominant in whole-
grain wheat. Alkylresorcinol homologs are present primarily in
the bran fractions of wheat, rye, barley, and triticale and are con-
sidered biomarkers of intakes of these whole grains (25, 30).
Anthropometric measurements
Anthropometric measurements were obtained during study
weeks 2 and 8. Height and waist and hip circumferences were
measured in duplicate with the use of standard methods (31).
Seminude body weight and body density were measured in the
morning after a $12-h fast with the use of air-displacement
plethysmography (BOD POD GS; Cosmed) (32).
Blood biochemistries
Blood samples were collected via venipuncture after a $12-h
fast during study weeks 2 and 8. Serum glucose was measured
with the use of an enzyme-coupled kinetic assay, and serum
insulin was measured with the use of a radioimmunoassay (Mil-
lipore), and these values were used to calculate the HOMA-IR (33)
and quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (34). Plasma al-
kylresorcinol concentrations were measured with the use of gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (25).
Stool characteristics
Participants collected all stools produced over 72 h during
study weeks 2 and 8 with the use of separate, preweighed plastic
containers for each sample. Samples were stored in a cooler with
frozen ice packs and transported to the laboratory chilled. All samples
from each 72-h collection were combined, homogenized, freeze dried
to a constant weight (Virtis Benchmark 1000 Lyophilizer; Virtis Co.),
and ground to a fine powder. The heat of combustion was measured in
duplicate (CV #6%) with the use of w1.0 g freeze-dried stool, an
Isoperibol Bomb Calorimeter (Parr model 1261; Parr Instrument
Co.), and benzoic acid as a standard (16).
Resting metabolic rate and breath gases
The resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured via indirect
calorimetry with the use of a portable metabolic cart (Parvo
Medics TrueOne 2400; Parvo Medics) during study weeks 2 and
8. Measurements were conducted in the morning, and partici-
pants were instructed to fast $12 h and to avoid vigorous ex-
ercise for $24 h before measurements. Measurements were
completed with participants in the supine position after a
30-min rest period and under thermoneutral conditions. Oxygen
consumption and carbon dioxide production were measured
over 30 min, and the last 20 min of data were used to calculate
the RMR with the use of Weir’s equation (35). The residual
method was used to adjust the measured RMR for sex, age, fat-
free mass, and fat mass (36). The calorimeter was calibrated
with the use of test gases of known concentrations before each
testing day, and alcohol burn tests were conducted periodically
to ensure that the accuracy of the calorimeter was maintained
within 61%. Expired air was collected immediately before and
after RMR measurements for breath hydrogen and methane
measurements with the use of stationary gas chromatography
(Supplemental Methods).
Gut-microbiota composition
Stool samples for gut-microbiota composition were delivered to
the laboratory on ice within 24 h of production and frozen in al-
iquots during study weeks 2 and 8. The full processing methods
have been described elsewhere (29). Briefly, DNA was extracted
from stool samples with the use of the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kit
(Qiagen) with slight modifications from the manufacturer’s rec-
ommendations (29). Amplicons of the V4 region of the bacterial

 16S ribosomal DNA were generated with the use of primers ac-
cording to the methods of Caporaso et al. (37) and were submitted
to the Tufts University Core Facility for 250-bp paired end se-
quencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc.). Se-
quencing data were processed with the use of the Quantitative
Insights Into Microbial Ecology package (v1.9.0) (38). Reads were
clustered at a 97% identity by open-reference operational taxo-
nomic unit picking with the use of the Greengenes reference da-
tabase (v13_5; www.greengenes.secondgenome.com) (39) and the
USEARCH program v6.1 (40).
Oral-glucose-tolerance test
Glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were assessed with the
use of an oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) during study weeks 2
and 8 in a self-selected subset of the study cohort. Blood was
collected for serum glucose and insulin measurements after a $12 h
fast and at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after the consumption of 75 g
glucose solution. The AUC of the serum glucose response (Glucose-
OGTTAUC) and AUC of the serum insulin response were calculated
with the use of the trapezoidal method, and insulin sensitivity was
estimated with the use of the Matsuda Index (41).
Continuous glucose monitoring
Blood glucose dynamics were also measured via continuous
glucose monitoring (CGM) (42) during study weeks 2 and 8 in a
self-selected subset of the study cohort. At the beginning of each
48-h monitoring period, a sensor was placed subcutaneously on
the abdominal surface. Interstitial glucose concentrations were
measured every 10 s and recorded as 5-min means over the
subsequent 48 h (Medtronic CGMS iPro 2 Professional CGM
System; Medtronic Inc.). Participants were also given in-
structions for the use of a glucometer (Abbott FreeStyle Lite;
Abbott Diabetes Care Inc.), which was used to calibrate the CGM
device every 6–12 h.
To prevent differences in meal timing from affecting the CGM
analyses, the same 24-h window (i.e., 0300 on day 2 to 0300 on
day 3) within the measurement period was analyzed for all
participants. Multiple metrics were used to summarize blood
glucose dynamics including the mean, SD, CV, and AUC of 24-h
glucose concentrations (43).
Questionnaires
Subjective appetite was measured weekly with the use of
visual analog scales that asked participants to rate their average
levels of hunger, satiety, prospective consumption, and diet
satisfaction over the past week. Eating behaviors were assessed
during study weeks 2 and 8 with the use of the Three-Factor
Eating Questionnaire, and food cravings were assessed with
the use of the Food-Craving Inventory and the Food Cravings
Questionnaire-State (Supplemental Methods). The International
Physical Activity Questionnaire–short form was used to measure
physical activity levels (Supplemental Methods).
Statistical analysis
Initial sample-size calculations indicated that 37 partic-
ipants/group were needed to address primary study outcomes.
With respect to the outcomes reported herein, a priori sample-size
calculations indicated that 29 participants/group would allow for
the detection of a 5% difference in the RMR (SD: 100 kcal/d)
and a 50-kcal/d difference in stool energy content (SD: 65 kcal/d)
at a = 0.05 and a power of 0.80. Sample-size estimates for the
optional measurements indicated that 26 and 15 participants/group
would allow for the detection of a mean 6 SD difference in 24-h
CGM glucose concentrations of 7.5 6 9 mg/dL and a mean 6
SD difference in the Glucose-OGTTAUC of 735 6 690-mmol 3
h/L, respectively, at a = 0.05 and a power of 0.80. SPSS v21.0
(IBM SPSS) software, SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute) software, and
R v3.2 software were used for the analyses. Values are reported
as means 6 SDs unless otherwise noted. All tests were 2-sided
and were considered statistically significant at P # 0.05.
All outcomes were assessed quantitatively and graphically for
normality and outliers. Plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations
were log10 transformed for analysis. Outliers were defined as
change scores .3 times the IQR above the 75th percentile or
below the 25th percentile within each study group. Analyses
were completed both with and without outliers included. The
exclusion of outliers did not alter the significance of any result,
and data are presented with outliers included.
A repeated-measures ANOVA was used to examine between-
group differences in body weight and plasma alkylresorcinol
concentrations over time. Other outcomes measured only during
study weeks 2 and 8 were analyzed with the use of an ANCOVA
in which the change score was entered as the response variable.
Three ANCOVA models were examined. In model 1, the pre-
intervention value was entered as a covariate. Model 2 was
adjusted as for model 1 and for age, sex, and baseline BMI. Model
3 was adjusted as for model 2 and for weight change. Between-
group differences in changes in appetite scores over time were
analyzed with the use of marginal models with an unstructured
covariance structure. The mean preintervention appetite score
(mean of weeks 1 and 2) was included as a covariate (model 1),
and models were further adjusted as previously described.
Pearson or Spearman correlations were used for exploratory
analyses of associations.
Primary analyses excluded study dropouts because the study
was focused on the efficacy, rather than the effectiveness, of the
diets. Study dropouts were replaced to maintain the power and
random assignment and to lessen risk of introducing bias. The
absence of preintervention between-group differences (see Re-
sults) indicated that any risk of bias that was introduced by these
exclusions was low, and covariate adjustment was used to further
minimize bias.
Plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations indicated that there
was adherence to the diet at the group level (see Results).
However, to account for potential nonadherence at the in-
dividual level and to further examine efficacy, a secondary
analysis with the exclusion of participants who were identified
as potentially nonadherent (RG: n = 4; WG: n = 11) was
conducted. Nonadherence was defined as having a plasma
alkylresorcinol concentration $95 nmol/L during the run-in diet
or having a plasma alkylresorcinol concentration ,95 nmol/L
(WG only) or $65 nmol/L (RG only) during the intervention
(Supplemental Table 2) (30). One participant in the RG who
did not have alkylresorcinol concentrations measured was also
considered nonadherent.
Finally, exploratory analyses were conducted with the use of
both generalized linear regression and Spearman correlation to

 examine associations between changes in taxa-relative abun-
dances as independent variables and changes in outcomes that
were affected by the intervention as dependent variables. Cor-
relation analyses were conducted to control for outliers. To
correct for multiple comparisons, P values within each taxa-
outcome association were adjusted with the use of false-
discovery rate (FDR) correction. Associations were considered
significant if FDR-adjusted P values were ,0.25 for both re-
gression and correlation analyses.
RESULTS
Of 103 enrolled participants, 90 subjects completed the run-in
phase and were randomly assigned, and 81 subjects completed the
study (Supplemental Figure 1, Table 2). The group assignment
(P = 0.72), sex (P = 0.72), age (P = 0.23), and preintervention
physical activity level (P = 0.21), body fat percentage (P = 0.62),
adjusted RMR (P = 0.68), fasting blood glucose (P = 0.66), and
HOMA-IR (P = 0.16) of study completers did not differ from
those of the 9 participants who withdrew after random assign-
ment. However, a trend for study completers to have lower pre-
intervention BMI was observed (P = 0.08).
Analyses of immune and inflammation variables have been
reported in detail elsewhere (29). Briefly, changes in markers of
immune function indicated modest favorable effects of the whole
grain–rich diet relative to that of the refined grain–based diet on the
immune response to pathogens, but there were no diet-mediated
effects on phenotypic or functional immune variables or inflam-
mation. Total short-chain fatty acid concentrations decreased in the
RG compared with in the WG (P-time-by-diet interaction = 0.05),
which was attributable to a decrease in stool propionate in both
groups (P , 0.001) and a decrease in stool acetate in the RG but
not in the WG (P-time-by-diet interaction = 0.02).
Adherence, weight change, and body composition
Plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations increased in the WG but
did not change in the RG (P-time-by-diet interaction , 0.0001)
(Figure 1). By design, body weight was maintained (P-main
effect of time = 0.13), and did not differ between groups
(P-time-by-diet interaction = 0.27) (Table 3). The number of
participants who required an increase (RG: n = 10; WG: n = 10)
or decrease (RG: n = 8; WG: n = 11) in prescribed energy intake
did not differ between groups (x2 = 0.56, P = 0.76). Changes in
anthropometric measures (Supplemental Table 2, Table 3) and in
total physical activity levels (P = 0.37) did not differ between
groups in the primary and secondary analyses.
Stool characteristics
One participant in each group was noncompliant with one or
more of the 72-h stool collections, and both subjects were excluded
from analyses of stool characteristics. Changes in stool weight were
greater in the WG than in the RG (Table 4). This outcome resulted
in a greater change in total daily stool energy content in the WG
because stool energy density did not differ between groups.
Between-group differences in total stool energy content remained
significant when values were recalculated to account for the esti-
mated nonmetabolizable energy contribution of dietary fiber
(Table 4) (44). Both changes in stool weight (r = 0.48, P , 0.0001)
and changes in the stool energy content (r = 0.37, P = 0.001) were
correlated with changes in plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations.
Changes in stool total short-chain fatty acid concentrations were
significantly correlated with changes in stool weight (r = 0.29,
P = 0.01), but not in stool energy density (r = 20.01, P = 0.96).
In the secondary analysis, the exclusion of participants who did
not adhere to the diet resulted in a slight increase in between-
group differences in changes in stool weight and energy content
(Supplemental Table 2).
RMR
One volunteer in each group did not complete the post-
intervention RMR measurement, and one individual within the
RG was excluded from RMR analyses because of suspected
noncompliance with premeasurement instructions in addition to
being an outlier. Changes in the RMR were greater in the WG
than in the RG (Table 3). This difference was not statistically
significant when the participant who was noncompliant with
premeasurement instructions was included or after the exclusion

 of participants who did not adhere to the diet (Supplemental Table
2, secondary analysis). Changes in the adjusted RMR were not
associated with changes in plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations
(r = 0.11, P = 0.35) or in stool total short-chain fatty acid
concentrations (r = 0.07, P = 0.55). No between-group differ-
ences in breath hydrogen or methane concentrations were ob-
served (Supplemental Table 3).
Combined changes in RMR and stool energy
Changes in the RMR (kilocalories per day) and changes in
fiber-adjusted stool energy content (kilocalories per day) were
summed for each participant to quantify the total energetic
benefit that was attributable to the whole grain–rich diet.
Compared between groups, the favorable energetic effects of the
whole grain–rich diet translated into a 92-kcal/d (95% CI: 28-,
156-kcal/d) higher net daily energy loss compared with that of
the refined grain–based diet (n = 76, P = 0.005) (Figure 2). This
difference increased to 108 kcal/d (95% CI: 34, 182 kcal/d)
(n = 61, P = 0.005) in the secondary analysis that excluded
participants who did not adhere to the diet.
Glycemia
A total of 41 and 24 study completers opted to participate in the
CGM and OGTT measurements, respectively (see Supplemental
Results for comparison with other study completers). Usable
24-h CGM data could only be obtained from 34 subjects (RG:
n = 17; WG: n = 17) because of technical difficulties with the
CGM device or because of noncompliance with the finger-stick
blood glucose measurements. One individual in the WG was
excluded from the OGTT analyses for noncompliance with
premeasurement instructions, and one individual in each group
was excluded from the OGTT analysis because of missing data.
Changes in fasting glycemia, insulinemia, and 24-h glucose
dynamics did not differ between groups in primary or secondary
analyses (Supplemental Table 2, Table 5). Changes in the Glucose-
OGTTAUC showed a trend to decrease in the WG compared with in

 the RG (model 3: P = 0.10) (Figure 3A), and changes in plasma
alkylresorcinol concentrations were inversely associated with
changes in the Glucose-OGTTAUC (Figure 3B). Changes in stool
total short-chain fatty acid concentrations were not significantly
correlated with changes in the Glucose-OGTTAUC (r = 0.08, P = 0.74).
In the secondary analysis, when participants who were not ad-
herent with the diet were excluded (RG: n = 2; WG: n = 1), the
Glucose-OGTTAUC was significantly reduced in the WG com-
pared with in the RG (Supplemental Table 2).
Appetite, eating behaviors, and food cravings
A trend for the mean self-reported prospective consumption
(model 3: P-main effect of group = 0.07) (Figure 4) to be lower in
the WG than in the RG was observed. This trend was not observed
in the secondary analysis after the exclusion of participants who did
not adhere to the diet (model 3: P-main effect of group = 0.16).
Hunger, fullness, and diet satisfaction did not differ between groups
in the primary analyses (Supplemental Figure 2) or in the sec-
ondary analyses. No between-group differences in eating-behavior
or food-craving scores were observed (Supplemental Table 4).
Gut-microbiota composition and associations with clinical
outcomes
Intervention effects on the composition of gut microbiota have
been reported in detail elsewhere (29). Briefly, a diversity and b
diversity differed between groups at baseline (P # 0.05) but not
after the intervention. Trends for the relative abundance of En-
terobacteriaceae, which are a proinflammatory taxa, to decrease
in the WG compared with in the RG (FDR-adjusted P = 0.25)
and for butyrate-producing Lachnospira (FDR-adjusted P = 0.25)
and Roseburia (FDR-adjusted P = 0.30) to increase in the WG
compared with in the RG were observed. However, changes in the
RMR, stool weight, stool energy content, and Glucose-OGTTAUC
were not associated with changes in the relative abundance of any
taxa (Supplemental Table 5).
DISCUSSION
This study tested current dietary recommendations to substitute
whole grains for refined grains in the diet and to increase dietary
fiber intake (45) and identified favorable energetic effects that
cumulatively resulted in an w100-kcal/d energy deficit and
evidence of improved oral glucose tolerance compared with the
effects of a typical American diet that is low in whole grains
and fiber. To our knowledge, these results provide new mech-
anistic insights that support the consistent inverse associations
between whole-grain intake and BMI and adiposity that have
been documented in epidemiologic studies (3–9), but which
have been largely unsubstantiated in previous clinical trials (4,
10–17). As such, this study adds support for dietary guidance
recommending the consumption of whole grains in place of
refined grains.
A central feature of this study is the provision of all food to
participants throughout the trial to enhance adherence and the
accuracy of dietary intake calculations. With the use of this
approach, we showed that the dietary substitution of whole grains
for refined grains conferred favorable energetic benefits that were
primarily attributable to a greater energy excretion in the stool.
Moreover, the magnitude of the effect was estimated to be greater
than that attributed to the nondigestible energy content of the fiber
itself. The between-group differences in fiber intake and stool
weight equated to a difference of 4 g stool/g fiber, which was
consistent with recent reports on the relation between stool
weight and cereal fiber intake (10, 46). Likewise, the increase in
the stool energy content within the WG was consistent with
multiple reports that have collectively shown that increasing
dietary fiber intake reduces dietary energy digestibility (47, 48).
The observation that fiber-adjusted energy excretion in the stool
remained higher in the WG than in the RG may suggest that
protein and fat digestibility were reduced by whole-grain con-
sumption, which would have been consistent with previous re-
ports on the relation between dietary fiber and macronutrient
digestibility (47, 48). However, contributions from small
between-diet differences in protein and fatty acid composition
and between-group differences in stool short-chain fatty acid
concentrations could not be excluded. These findings extend
current knowledge as effects may be attributed to whole grains
rather than to isolated fiber supplements or diets that contain
multiple fiber sources, which, together, comprise much of the
evidence base (47). In contrast, Kristensen et al. (15) did not
observe increases in stool weight or energy content in a dietary
intervention that achieved 105- and 7-g/d between-group dif-
ferences in whole grain and fiber intakes, respectively, but the
difference in fiber intake in the study may have been too small to
detect an effect (49). Collectively, these observations suggest that
the substitution of whole grains for refined grains in the diet in
amounts that exceed current dietary recommendations and in-
crease fiber intake from the population mean to recommended
amounts increases stool output, which, in turn, increases energy
loss in the stool.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the effects
of whole grains compared with refined grains on energy me-
tabolism during weight stability. In one previous weight-loss
study, whole-grain intake did not influence the RMR (13).
However, weight loss causes reductions in the RMR (50), which
may have masked any effect of whole grains on energy me-
tabolism. In contrast, our study suggests that, during weight
stability, the dietary substitution of whole grains for refined grains
may result in a modest increase in the RMR. Favorable effects of
whole-grain intake on energy expenditure are plausible on the basis

 of previous studies that have collectively shown the thermogenic
effects of consuming fermentable fiber in both humans and animals
(51). In addition, the between-group difference in the RMR
exceeded that which would have been predicted to be due to the
heat that is generated from fiber fermentation (0.6 kJ/g fiber) (44).
As such, the observed effect of substituting whole grains for refined
grains on the RMR is intriguing and plausible. However, note that
the between-group difference in the RMR was sensitive to effects
of dietary adherence, and cautious interpretation and replication
are warranted.
The combined effect of the change in the RMR and the
change in the net stool energy loss was clinically relevant. With
the use of the energy-balance modeling approach of Hall et al.
(52), the 92-kcal/d energy difference would translate into an
w2.5-kg body weight loss over 1 y if it was uncompensated for
by changes in energy consumption or physical activity. Fur-
thermore, the observed trend of lower prospective consumption
and the absence of differences in other appetite metrics in the
WG than in the RG were consistent with previous controlled-
feeding whole-grain studies (16, 27) and suggest that com-
pensatory increases in appetite and energy intake may not
occur. Note that this weight-loss estimate is remarkably con-
sistent with the findings of Mozaffarian et al. (7), who
reported a 0.2-kg/y decrease in body weight per 1-serving/d
increase in whole-grain intake in an analysis of the Health
Professionals Follow-Up and Nurses’ Health Study I and II
cohorts. According to the value of Mozaffarian et al. (7), the
mean between-group difference in whole-grain intake of
13 serving/d in this study would be estimated to result in a
2.6-kg/y weight loss. Taken together, these observations sug-
gest that the energetic benefits of replacing whole grains for
refined grains that were identified in this study are of sufficient
magnitude to explain the consistent inverse associations be-
tween whole-grain intake and BMI that have been reported in
epidemiologic studies.
The findings that the postprandial glucose response was re-
duced in the WG and that this response was associated with the
change in plasma alkylresorcinol concentrations support an ad-
ditional favorable effect of substituting whole grains for refined
grains on glucose tolerance. The absence of an effect of whole
grains on fasting glycemia and insulinemia, which was consistent
with most (10–12, 14, 15, 21, 23, 24) but not all (4, 13, 27)
studies, suggests that the underlying mechanism may be a sec-
ond meal effect whereby short-chain fatty acids that are pro-
duced during fermentation of undigested carbohydrate stimulate
peptide-YY and glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion from colonic
enteroendocrine cells (53), thereby resulting in slowed gastric
emptying (54) and potentiated glucose-mediated insulin secre-
tion. Although they were not associated with changes in oral
glucose tolerance, higher stool short-chain fatty acid concen-
trations were observed in the WG than in the RG. Although no
between-group differences in 24-h glycemia were observed, this
apparent inconsistency with the glucose-tolerance results may
have been attributable to both the normal glycemic status of the
study population and to the absence of differences in post-
absorptive and fasting glycemia.
Study strengths included the provision of full run-in and in-
tervention diets to study participants and the use of biomarkers to
assess diet adherence. In addition, the generalizability of the
findings was increased by the intentional use of commercially
available whole-grain products. However, one limitation of the
use of these products while attempting to maintain similar
macronutrient distributions between groups is that other foods in
the diet could not be exactly matched. In addition, the physiologic
benefit of a whole grain–rich diet may have been attenuated by
the use of commercially available products because most com-
mercial whole-grain products are made from whole-grain flour
rather than from minimally processed intact whole grains. We
hypothesize that the use of foods that contain intact whole-grain
kernels would elicit an even more pronounced benefit because

 the particle structure and intactness have been shown to favor-
ably influence laxation, glycemia, and appetite (55, 56). The
study findings must also be interpreted in the context of the
generally healthy male and postmenopausal female population
studied and may not extend to younger or less healthy pop-
ulations. In addition, this study did not address whether in-
dividuals would substitute whole grains for refined grains if they
were able to freely choose their diets. Note that the observation
that diet satisfaction did not differ between groups suggests that
the whole-grain foods were acceptable in this population. Ad-
ditional study limitations are as follows: OGTT and CGM
measurements were conducted in a self-selected subset of the
full cohort, which resulted in these analyses being underpow-
ered; nutrient databases were used to determine the energy
contents and compositions of study diets; and a mean value was
used for the combustible energy of fiber to correct stool energy
values.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, these findings provide new
evidence of energetic benefits and improved oral glucose toler-
ance when whole grains replace refined grains in the diet. These
findings strengthen the support for basing dietary guidance
pertaining to whole-grain consumption on favorable effects re-
lating to the regulation of the energy balance.

FIGURE 3
Mean 6 SEM changes in the glucose AUC (P = 0.10) and
insulin AUC (P = 0.54) that were measured during an oral-glucose-tolerance
test that was administered before and after the consumption of a refined
grain–based diet (n = 13) or a whole grain–rich diet (n = 8) for 6 wk (A).
Change scores were compared with the use of an ANCOVA with the pre-
intervention value, age, BMI, sex, and the weight change during the 6-wk
intervention entered as covariates. (B) Changes in total plasma alkylresor-
cinol concentrations were correlated with changes in glucose AUC (Pear-
son correlation). Data are presented with outliers included. The exclusion
of outliers did not change the significance of any test. ARpost, alkylresor-
cinol measured after intervention; ARpre, alkylresorcinol measured before
intervention.
FIGURE 4
Mean 6 SEM weekly self-reported prospective consump-
tion ratings during consumption of a 2-wk run-in diet and while consuming
a refined grain–based diet (n = 40) or a whole grain–rich diet (n = 41) for
6 wk. Main and interactive effects of time and diet were examined with the
use of marginal models with an unstructured covariance structure. Cova-
riates in the model were means of ratings measured during the run-in phase
(weeks 1 and 2), age, BMI, sex, and the weight change during the 6-wk
intervention.
