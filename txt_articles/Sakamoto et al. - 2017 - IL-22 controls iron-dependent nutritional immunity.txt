Abstract
Host immunity limits iron availability to pathogenic bacteria, but whether immunity limits 
pathogenic bacteria from accessing host heme, the major source of iron in the body, remains 
unclear. Using Citrobacter rodentium, a mouse enteric pathogen and Escherichia coli, a major 
cause of sepsis in humans as models, we find that interleukin-22, a cytokine best known for its 
ability to promote epithelial barrier function, also suppresses the systemic growth of bacteria by 
limiting iron availability to the pathogen. Using an unbiased proteomic approach to understand the 
mechanistic basis of IL-22 dependent iron retention in the host, we have identified that IL-22 
induces the production of the plasma hemoglobin scavenger haptoglobin and heme scavenger 
hemopexin. Moreover, the anti-microbial effect of IL-22 depends on the induction of hemopexin 
expression, while haptogloblin is dispensable. Impaired pathogen clearance in infected Il22−/− 
mice was restored by hemopexin administration and hemopexin-deficient mice had increased 
pathogen loads after infection. These studies reveal a previously unrecognized host defense 
mechanism regulated by IL-22 that relies on the induction of hemopexin to limit heme availability 
to bacteria leading to suppression of bacterial growth during systemic infections.

 Introduction
Iron is an essential nutrient for nearly all microorganisms, including pathogenic bacteria (1). 
In mammals, the majority of iron is found inside erythrocytes, contained in the prosthetic 
heme groups of hemoglobin (2). Given their strict requirement for iron, pathogenic bacteria 
evolved strategies to trigger hemolysis as the means to extract iron from hemoglobin (1). 
Bacterial pathogens possess several mechanisms to overcome the limited availability of iron 
in the circulation or at local niches. These include production of siderophores that bind iron 
at extremely high-affinity, heme acquisition systems, and mechanism for the uptake of 
transferrin- and lactoferrin-bound iron (1). Host immunity encompasses several mechanisms 
that limit host iron availability to pathogenic bacteria (3-6), a defense strategy known as 
nutritional immunity (7). This host defense strategy involves a reduction of circulating or 
local iron by inhibition of cellular iron export and the induction of cellular iron import by 
host cells via hepcidin-dependent and independent mechanisms (3-6). Whether nutritional 
immunity limits pathogenic bacteria from accessing host heme, the major source of iron, 
remains unclear.
Interleukin-22 (IL-22) is an important cytokine that promotes early host defense, epithelial 
barrier function and tissue repair at mucosal surfaces (8, 9). In response to bacterial 
infection, IL-22 is produced by several immune cells, leading to the induction of innate 
antimicrobial molecules that are thought to promote host defense and intestinal barrier 
protection against pathogens (10). The protective function of IL-22 was revealed by the 
observation that Il22−/− mice are highly susceptible to the attaching and effacing mouse 
pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. In the absence of IL-22, there was marked intestinal 
damage and bacterial translocation in orally infected mice (8, 9). IL-22 signals through a 
heterodimeric receptor complex comprised of an ubiquitously expressed IL-10R2 subunit 
and an epithelial-specific IL-22RA1 subunit (11, 12). Because of the highly restricted 
expression of the IL-22RA1 subunit, IL-22 stimulates epithelial cells on certain organs such 
as the liver and kidney as well as epithelial barriers including the skin and the intestine (13). 
Using C. rodentium and E. coli infection models, we report that IL-22 induces a systemic 
protective response that is mediated by hemopexin, a plasma heme scavenger produced in 
the liver, that limits the availability of heme-iron to the microbes and suppresses bacterial 
systemic growth.
Results
IL-22 promotes pathogen clearance and host survival after systemic infection with C. 
rodentium
Consistent with earlier studies (8, 9), Il22−/− mice succumbed early to oral infection with C. 
rodentium, which was associated with increased pathogen load in blood, liver, and spleen 
(Fig. S1). Systemic C. rodentium infection induced rapid production of IL-22 in plasma 
(Fig. 1A). To determine whether IL-22 controls pathogen growth systemically, wild-type 
(WT) and Il22−/− mice were infected with C. rodentium intravenously and monitored for 
survival and pathogen load in the blood. Surprisingly, >90% of the Il22−/− mice succumbed 
to intravenous infection compared to ~20% of the WT mice (Fig. 1B). Mortality of infected 
Il22−/− mice was associated with impaired pathogen clearance, resulting in increased

 pathogen load in blood (Fig. 1C). Pathogen-induced lethality in Il22−/− mice required live 
bacteria because the animals did not succumb when injected intravenously with heat-killed 
C. rodentium (Fig. S2). While antibody production is critical to control C. rodentium oral 
infection (14, 15), the production of pathogen-specific IgM and IgG was not impaired in 
Il22−/− mice, as compared with WT mice (Fig. S3). To ascertain the role of IL-22 in 
controlling pathogen growth, we pre-treated Il22−/− mice with recombinant IL-22 prior to 
intravenous C. rodentium infection and assessed the pathogen loads in the blood. 
Administration of IL-22 reduced pathogen load (Fig. 1D). In our mouse colony, ~ 90% of 
the bacteria present in the liver of orally infected Il22−/− mice were C. rodentium although a 
few commensals, particularly Lactobacillus spp., were also identified (Fig. S1G). To 
determine whether C. rodentium infection could induce mortality in the absence of 
commensals, we pre-treated WT germ-free (GF) mice with an IL-22 neutralizing antibody 
and infected the mice with the pathogen via the oral route. Neutralization of IL-22 reduced 
the survival of GF mice after oral C. rodentium infection (Fig. 1E), which was associated 
with increased pathogen loads in blood, liver and spleen (Fig. 1F-H). Collectively, these 
results indicate that IL-22 limits the systemic expansion of C. rodentium and promotes host 
survival.
IL-22 regulates plasma hemopexin and haptoglobin after pathogen infection
To understand further the mechanism by which IL-22 promotes systemic pathogen 
clearance, we set to identify, by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, plasma proteins regulated by IL-22 before and after 
infection of WT and Il22−/− mice with C. rodentium intravenously. Consistent with previous 
studies (16, 17), several proteins including serum amyloid-A1, serum amyloid-A2, inter-
alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, alpha-2-macroglobulin 
and complement factors were reduced in the plasma of infected Il22−/− mice compared with 
infected WT mice (Fig. 2). In addition, the induction of the plasma extracellular heme 
scavenger hemopexin (HPX) (18) and the hemoglobin scavenger haptoglobin (HP) (19) in 
response to C. rodentium infection was severely impaired in Il22−/− mice compared to WT 
mice (Fig. 2). This was associated with the accumulation of extracellular hemoglobin α- and 
β-globin chains in the plasma of infected Il22−/− mice compared to WT mice (Fig. 2). 
Importantly, intraperitoneal administration of IL-22 restored the induction of HP and HPX 
expression in the plasma of Il22−/− mice compared to Il22−/− mice treated with control 
protein (Fig. 2).
Hemolysis driven by bacterial virulence factors promotes pathogen growth in IL22−/− mice
Accumulation of extracellular hemoglobin α- and β-globin chains in the plasma of Il22−/− 
mice suggested that IL-22 deficiency is associated with augmented hemolysis after systemic 
C. rodentium infection and/or with impaired disposal of extracellular hemoglobin from 
plasma. To verify that hemoglobin proteins are regulated by IL-22, we assessed the amounts 
of α-globin in the plasma of uninfected and infected WT and Il22−/− mice by 
immunoblotting. The analysis confirmed that the amounts of α-globin were increased in the 
plasma of Il22−/− mice in response to intravenous or oral infection with C. rodentium (Fig. 
3A,B). Because scavenging of extracellular hemoglobin dimers by HP prevents the release 
of the prosthetic heme groups of hemoglobin (20, 21), we asked whether induction of HP by

 IL-22 was associated with inhibition of heme accumulation in plasma. Il22−/− mice infected 
via the intravenous or oral route accumulated heme in plasma whereas infected WT mice did 
not (Fig. 3C). Consistent with a role of hemoglobin release from lysed erythrocytes in 
promoting pathogen growth, intravenous administration of lysed erythrocytes to C. 
rodentium infected WT mice increased their pathogen loads in the blood (Fig. 3D). The 
filament protein EspA as well as EspB and EspD are required for the assembly of the 
translocon of the enterocyte effacement (LEE)-encoded T3SS and promote the formation of 
EspB/EspD pores that mediate erythrocyte lysis in vitro (22). To assess whether C. 
rodentium translocators induce erythrocyte lysis, mouse erythrocytes were incubated in vitro 
with WT and C. rodentium mutants deficient in EspA, EspB and Ler, the global regulator of 
the LEE that is critical for pathogen virulence (23). The WT bacterium, but not the EspA, 
EspB and Ler mutants, induced erythrocyte lysis (Fig. 3E). To determine whether EspB is 
important for hemolysis associated with systemic growth and lethality of C. rodentium in 
vivo, we infected Il22−/− mice with WT or the EspB mutant and monitored the pathogen 
loads in blood as well as mouse survival. Notably, deficiency of EspB was associated with 
reduced pathogen loads and absence of lethality when compared to the WT bacterium that 
caused 100% mortality in Il22−/− mice (Fig. 3F,G). Ler expression was detected in the blood 
of mice after intravenous infection with C. rodentium (Fig. S4A). Furthermore, the reduced 
ability of the EspB mutant to grow systemically was not associated with reduced expression 
of ler in infected WT or Il22−/− mice (Fig. S4B). In contrast to the EspB mutant, the 
pathogen load of a C. rodentium mutant deficient in EspH, a T3SS effector that regulates 
phagocytosis (24), was comparable to that of the WT bacterium in infected Il22−/− mice 
(Fig. S5). The Ler mutant that regulates the expression of LEE-encoded proteins including 
EspB, also exhibited reduced pathogen loads and failed to cause mortality in Il22−/− mice 
when compared to the WT bacterium (Fig. S6). Importantly, growth of the EspB mutant was 
enhanced in vivo by intravenous administration of lysed erythrocytes (Fig. 3H). 
Furthermore, EspB and Ler promoted heme accumulation in plasma after intravenous 
infection of Il22−/− mice with C. rodentium (Fig. 3I and Fig. S6). In contrast, the amounts of 
iron and the unsaturated iron-binding capacity in plasma before and after infection with C. 
rodentium were comparable in WT and Il22−/− mice (Fig. S7). Thus, IL-22 regulates heme, 
but not free iron, accumulation in the plasma following systemic C. rodentium infection. 
These results indicate that hemolysis driven by LEE-encoded EspB translocator and ensuing 
release of heme in plasma promotes C. rodentium growth in vivo.
IL-22-dependent induction of hemopexin inhibits heme-mediated bacterial growth
Analysis of plasma proteins by LC-MS/MS revealed that HPX and HP are positively 
regulated by IL-22 in response to systemic C. rodentium infection (Fig. 2). Immunobloting 
analysis of plasma proteins confirmed that IL-22 is required for induction of HPX and HP in 
response to intravenous and oral C. rodentium infection (Fig. 4A,B,C). The IL-22 receptor is 
expressed on epithelial cells including hepatocytes, the major site of HPX and HP 
production (25, 26). Consistently, intraperitoneal administration of IL-22 induced HPX and 
HP mRNA in the liver (Fig. S8). To determine whether C. rodentium infection induces anti-
bacterial activity in plasma, C. rodentium colonies were monitored in vitro after incubation 
with plasma from uninfected and infected mice. Plasma from infected WT mice inhibited C. 
rodentium colony formation compared to plasma of uninfected WT mice (Fig. 4D). Notably,

 plasma from infected Il22−/− mice failed to limit colony formation compared to the plasma 
of infected WT mice (Fig. 4D). Consistently, intravenous administration of recombinant 
IL-22 to Il22−/− mice restored the plasma anti-bacterial activity (Fig. 4E). To identify the 
mechanism underlying this anti-bacterial activity in plasma, we fractionated plasma proteins 
from IL-22-treated mice by column chromatography and assessed the pathogen inhibitory 
activity in the fractions by agar plating assay. Immunoblotting analysis showed that the 
presence of the heme scavenger HPX, but not the hemoglobin scavenger HP, correlated with 
the ability of the plasma fractions to suppress C. rodentium colony formation (Fig. 4F). To 
determine whether heme promotes C. rodentium growth, the pathogen was incubated in vitro 
with and without synthetic heme (i.e. hemin) in the presence of increasing concentrations of 
HPX. In the absence of HPX, hemin promoted robust C. rodentium colony formation in 
vitro (Fig. 4G), while addition of HPX, at a concentrations range found in mouse plasma, i.e. 
~500-1000 μg/ml (27), inhibited hemin-driven pathogen growth in a dose-dependent manner 
(Fig. 4G). Hemoglobin also promoted robust C. rodentium colony formation in vitro, which 
was inhibited by HPX in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4H) whereas HP did not (Fig. S9). 
Furthermore, exogenous HPX largely restored the anti-bacterial activity of the plasma 
isolated from infected Il22−/− mice in vitro (Fig. 4I). Collectively, these results suggest that 
once released from extracellular hemoglobin, heme promotes C. rodentium growth, a 
pathogenic effect countered via a mechanism mediated by the IL-22-dependent induction of 
the plasma heme scavenger HPX.
IL-22 limits heme-mediated E. coli growth via hemopexin
E. coli, a Gram-negative bacterium that normally inhabits the intestine, is a major cause of 
bacteremia and sepsis in humans (28, 29). As it was observed with C. rodentium, hemin 
promoted robust colony formation of an E. coli strain isolated from the mouse intestine 
which was inhibited by HPX in vitro (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, administration of recombinant 
IL-22 to Il22−/− mice restored the ability of plasma to suppress E. coli colony formation in 
vitro (Fig. 5B), which was strictly dependent on the expression of endogenous HPX (Fig. 
5C). Furthermore, Il22−/− and Hpx−/− mice were more susceptible and had more bacterial 
loads than WT mice after intravenous infection with E. coli (Fig. 5D,E,F,G).These results 
indicate that E. coli colony formation is promoted by heme which is inhibited by IL-22-
mediated induction of HPX.
IL-22 requires hemopexin, but not haptoglobin, to suppress pathogen growth in vitro and 
in vivo
We next assessed the requirement for HPX and HP in IL-22-mediated suppression of 
bacterial growth. Importantly, the ability of plasma from IL-22-treated WT mice to suppress 
C. rodentium colony formation was comparable to that of plasma from Hp−/− mice treated 
with IL-22 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, the plasma of Hpx−/− and Hpx−/−Hp−/− mice treated with 
IL-22 was impaired in suppressing C. rodentium growth which was comparable to the 
plasma of untreated WT mice (Fig. 6B,C). To confirm that IL-22 suppresses pathogen 
growth in vivo via a mechanism involving heme neutralization by HPX, WT, Hpx−/−, Hp−/−, 
and Hpx−/−Hp−/− mice received IL-22 intraperitoneally and then the mice were infected with 
C. rodentium intravenously. While administration of IL-22 induced a comparable reduction 
of pathogen loads in the blood of WT and Hp−/− mice (Fig. 6D), this anti-bacterial effect

 was lost in Hpx−/− and Hpx−/−Hp−/− mice (Fig. 6E,F). Thus, IL-22 requires HPX, but not 
HP, to suppress pathogen growth in vitro and in vivo. To assess whether HPX is sufficient to 
promote pathogen clearance in the absence of IL-22 administration, WT, Hpx−/−, Hp−/−, and 
Hpx−/−Hp−/− mice were infected with C. rodentium intravenously and pathogen loads and 
mouse survival were monitored in infected mice. There was impaired pathogen clearance in 
Hpx−/− and Hpx−/−Hp−/− mice, but not Hp−/− mice, compared to WT mice (Fig. 6G). 
Furthermore, administration of HPX reduced the pathogen load in Il22−/− mice compared to 
mock-treated mice after intravenous (Fig. 6H) and oral infection (Fig. 6I,J). Together, these 
results indicate that IL-22 limits the growth of C. rodentium via HPX in vivo.
Discussion
IL-22 has been primarily linked to the regulation of host defense, cellular proliferation and 
tissue repair at intestinal barriers (10). In the current studies, we provide evidence for a role 
of IL-22 in protecting the host against the enteric pathogen C. rodentium and E. coli by 
mediating the production of HPX in plasma. Although produced by immune cells in 
response to microbial stimuli, IL-22 stimulates its heterodimeric IL-22RA-1/IL-10R 
receptor on epithelial cells including hepatocytes that are known to produce large amounts of 
HPX (18). Induction of HPX in response to systemic infections was so far thought to protect 
the infected host from heme-induced cell toxicity, inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction 
(30), without interfering with the host pathogen load and as such conferring disease 
tolerance to systemic bacterial infections (30, 31). This protective effect of HPX and its 
removal by macrophages and parenchymal cells has also been extended to several other 
pathologies associated with varying degrees of hemolysis (25). Our work demonstrates that 
IL-22-induced HPX also confers resistance to systemic bacterial infections by limiting the 
heme availability to bacteria. Pathogens possess several mechanisms to overcome iron-
limiting defenses induced by the host including siderophores, hemophores and heme/
hemoprotein receptors (1). Thus, pathogens capable of colonizing iron-poor niches are likely 
to be less susceptible to IL-22-mediated HPX induction. C. rodentium and E. coli appear to 
rely on strategies to acquire iron from heme when they colonize the plasma and systemic 
organs. C. rodentium and E. coli produce enterobactin, a siderophore, and its receptor FepA 
to acquire iron and may express functional heme uptake systems (32, 33). Our results 
suggest that C. rodentium promotes hemolysis and heme acquisition through pore formation 
via T3SS-mediated factors and specifically EspB/EspD. EspH, a T3SS effector that regulates 
phagocytosis, was dispensable for pathogen growth in IL22−/− mice. These findings suggest 
that the T3SS promotes bacterial growth by inducing hemolysis. However, there maybe 
additional factors including compromised ability to block phagocytosis that might contribute 
to the impaired ability of T3SS mutants to infect the mice. Further work is needed to 
understand how C. rodentium and E. coli acquire iron from heme in vivo.
Our studies indicate that pathogenic bacteria such as A/E pathogens take advantage of 
virulence strategies such as expression of Ler-dependent factors normally used to colonize 
the intestinal epithelium to survive in alternative niches such as the blood in the event of 
causing bacteremia. Administration of IL-22-binding protein (IL-22-BP), a natural 
antagonist of IL-22 signaling, has been reported to enhance the systemic clearance of 
commensal bacteria in a model of polymicrobial sepsis (34). Further work is needed to

 determine whether the protective function of IL-22-BP is mediated through the induction of 
HPX and/or another mechanism. Our results suggest that strategies to scavenge heme in 
plasma, such as that afforded by the administration of IL-22, HPX or other approaches may 
be beneficial in the treatment of systemic bacterial infections.
Material and Methods
Study design
The aim of this study was to elucidate and characterize the mechanism by which IL-22 
mediates systemic protection against bacterial infection using the C. rodentium and E. coli 
models in mice. The experimental design involved in vivo and in vitro experiments, 
including protein identification by LC-tandem MS, chromatographic fractionation of plasma 
proteins, immunoblotting, histological analysis, reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and bacterial colony enumeration. The animal experiments were 
not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to the allocation during experiments and 
analyses unless otherwise indicated. Experimental replication is indicated in the figure 
legends.
Animals
Six to eight weeks old WT C57BL6 mice were bred in our animal facility. Il22−/−, Hp−/−, 
Hpx−/−, and Hp−/−Hpx−/−, mice on C57BL6 background have been described (35, 36) and 
bred under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions at the University of Michigan Cancer 
Center. Il22−/− mice were obtained from Genentech. GF mice were bred and maintained at 
the GF Animal Core Facility of the University of Michigan. The animal studies were 
conducted under protocols approved by the University of Michigan Committee on Use and 
Care of Animals.
Citrobacter rodentium infection
Kanamycin (Km)-resistant WT Citrobacter rodentium strain DBS120 (pCRP1::Tn5) was a 
gift of Dr. David Schauer, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The isogenic C. rodentium 
Δler mutant strain has been described (37). C. rodentium strains with nonpolar deletion 
mutants of espA, espB and espH have been described (23). For inoculations, bacteria were 
grown overnight in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with Km (50 μg/ml) with 
shaking at 37°C. Mice were infected by oral gavage with 0.2 mL of PBS containing 
approximately 1 × 109 colony-forming units (CFU) of C. rodentium, or by intravenous 
injection with 0.2 mL of PBS containing approximately 5 × 107 CFU of C. rodentium. The 
investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments. To mimic the continuous 
source of bacteremia observed in Il22−/− mice orally infected with the pathogen, mice were 
infected with 5 × 107 CFU of C. rodentium intravenously daily for 9-10 days. To assess the 
role of HPX in C. rodentium clearance in vivo, Il22−/− mice were orally infected with the 
pathogen (1 × 109 CFU) and the mice were treated intravenously with purified HPX (Athens 
Research and Technology; 2 mg/mouse) or saline on day 3, 4, 5 and 6 post-infection. For 
systemic infections, HPX (2 mg/mouse) or saline (sham) was injected intravenously on three 
consecutive days before infection or control (sham) into Il22−/− mice and then the mice were 
infected with 5×107 CFU of C. rodentium intravenously. To determine pathogen loads in the

 feces, fecal pellets were collected from individual mice, homogenized in cold PBS and 
plated at serial dilutions onto MacConkey agar plates containing 50 μg/ml Km, and the 
number of CFU was determined after overnight incubation at 37°C. To determine bacterial 
number in the blood, liver and spleen, mice were euthanized at various time points post-
infection and blood or tissue samples were plated onto MacConkey agar containing 50 μg/ml 
Km, and the number of CFU was determined after overnight incubation at 37°C.
IL-22 neutralization and administration
To deplete endogenous IL-22 in mice, anti-IL-22 (150 μg/mouse per dose; 8E11; Genentech) 
or the equivalent amount of mouse isotype-matched control antibody (to ragweed; 
10D9.1E11.1F12; Genentech) were injected to the mice 3 times a week. To treat mice with 
IL-22, mice were injected intravenously with Fc-IL-22 (50 μg per dose; PRO312045; 
Genentech) or the equivalent amount of mouse isotype-matched control antibody (to 
ragweed; 10D9.1E11.1F12; Genentech) daily for 3 days, and 6 hrs after from final injection.
Escherichia coli infection
E. coli strain NI1076 was isolated from the mouse intestine mice as described (17). For 
infections, bacteria were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with shaking at 37°C. 
Mice were infected by intravenous injection with 0.2 mL of PBS containing approximately 2 
× 108 CFU of E. coli.
Bacterial growth assays
1 × 105 CFU/mL of C. rodentium or E. coli were incubated in DMEM in the presence of 500 
μg/mL of Apo-transferrin (Athens Research and Technology) to chelate free iron. To assess 
bacterial growth, hemin (2.5 μg/ml; Sigma) or hemoglobin (25 μg/ml; Sigma) was added to 
the culture medium in the presence and absence of different concentrations of HPX (Athens 
Research and Technology) or HP (Athens Research and Technology).
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was calculated as indicated in the figure legends using GraphPad 
Prism 6 software. Log-rank test was used to assess mouse survival. Non-parametric Mann-
Whitney test was used for pair comparisons and Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons. 
Differences were considered significant when p values were less than 0.05.
