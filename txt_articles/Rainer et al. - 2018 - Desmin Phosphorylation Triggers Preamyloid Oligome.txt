F
ormation of preamyloid oligomers (PAOs) is emerging as a 
common hallmark of experimental and human acquired heart 
failure (HF).1–5 Regardless of their sequence and disease, the vast 
majority of known PAOs are generated by post-translational pro-
cessing of organ- and disease-specific protein sequences (eg, Aβ 
1–42 in Alzheimer, α-synuclein and τ in Parkinson, etc). Typically, 
post-translational modifications (PTMs) generate the seed that ini-
tiates the nucleation process that leads to the formation of toxic 
PAOs and later fibrils and aggregates.6 PAOs better predict organ 
dysfunction than large aggregates in Alzheimer disease7,8; how-
ever, in contrast to aggregates, PAOs cannot be detected in the ab-
sence of specific staining or conformational antibodies.6

We previously reported that desmin phosphoryla-
tion and cleavage associate with the formation of cardiac 
PAOs and aggregates in vitro9 and in vivo.1 The finding 
that desmin forms PAOs when its main chaperone cryAB 
(α-B-crystallin)3 is nonfunctional suggests a mechanism 
independent of genetic mutations in desmin’s sequence. It 
rather supports the notion that PAOs formation is facilitated 
by signaling pathways impacting PTMs and that it exacer-
bates the cellular toxicity induced by proteostasis insuffi-
ciency, which characterizes HF.3,10 Here, we focus on the 
role of PTMs in regulating protein misfolding and cardiac 
PAOs formation because they modulate desmin’s physical 
properties and assembly,1,9,11,12 as well as the formation of 
numerous well-characterized PAOs (eg, Alzheimer Aβ 1–42 
phosphorylation and cleavage).6,13

Rationale: Disrupted proteostasis is one major pathological trait that heart failure (HF) shares with other organ 
proteinopathies, such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. Yet, differently from the latter, whether and how 
cardiac preamyloid oligomers (PAOs) develop in acquired forms of HF is unclear.
Objective: We previously reported a rise in monophosphorylated, aggregate-prone desmin in canine and human HF. 
We now tested whether monophosphorylated desmin acts as the seed nucleating PAOs formation and determined 
whether positron emission tomography is able to detect myocardial PAOs in nongenetic HF.
Methods and Results: Here, we first show that toxic cardiac PAOs accumulate in the myocardium of mice subjected 
to transverse aortic constriction and that PAOs comigrate with the cytoskeletal protein desmin in this well-established 
model of acquired HF. We confirm this evidence in cardiac extracts from human ischemic and nonischemic HF. We also 
demonstrate that Ser31 phosphorylated desmin aggregates extensively in cultured cardiomyocytes. Lastly, we were able 
to detect the in vivo accumulation of cardiac PAOs using positron emission tomography for the first time in acquired HF.
Conclusions: Ser31 phosphorylated desmin is a likely candidate seed for the nucleation process leading to cardiac 
PAOs deposition. Desmin post-translational processing and misfolding constitute a new, attractive avenue for the 
diagnosis and treatment of the cardiac accumulation of toxic PAOs that can now be measured by positron emission 
tomography in acquired HF.

In this study, we tested whether cardiac PAOs accumulate 
in acquired HF and whether pSer31 (Ser31 phosphorylated)-
mimetic desmin promotes the formation of PAOs in cardiac 
myocytes. Further, we devised new protocols to track the 
build-up of PAOs in vitro and in vivo. To this end, we op-
timized a new method to purify, measure, and characterize 
amyloid in-gel, tested the effectiveness of a small molecule in 
reducing these species in vitro, and measured the build-up of 
cardiac PAOs in acquired HF in vivo by the unprecedented use 
of positron emission tomography (PET).
Methods

able from the corresponding author on reasonable request.
Animal and Cellular Models and Human 
Myocardial Tissue
Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and echocardiography were 
performed as previously described and in accordance with institu-
tional guidelines.14 Human myocardial tissue samples were obtained 
as described previously, under protocols approved by the Institutional 
Review Boards at the University of Pennsylvania (PA, USA) and 
Johns Hopkins University (MD, USA).15 Neonatal rat ventricular 
myocytes isolation and lentiviral vectors production and infection 
were performed as described previously by Sekar et al.16 Details are 
provided in the Online Data Supplement.
Protein Biochemistry
Protein extraction, Western blot analysis, and mass spectrometry 
(MS) were performed as described previously1 with minor modifica-
tions described in the Online Data Supplement.
Live Cell Imaging
Living cells expressing desmin-GFP (green fluorescent protein) pho-
sho-null/mimetic mutants were imaged using a spinning disc inverted 
confocal microscope equipped with 2 high-speed cameras (Olympus/
Andor Revolution). Videos of living cells were acquired at a ×40 
magnification. Software-assisted image analysis was performed us-
ing the Image J package, Fiji.
Filter Assay
A filter assay to trap amyloid aggregates was used as we described,9 
with some modifications described in the Online Data Supplement.
PET and Single-Photon Emission Computed 
Tomography
Please refer to the Online Data Supplement for details regarding PET 
and single-photon emission computed tomography.
Statistical Analysis
Data were normalized to the average of controls to correct for in-
terexperimental variability when appropriate. In this case, data were 
expressed as percentage arbitrary units (AU%). Student t test was ap-
plied for the comparison of 2 experimental groups, whereas 1-way 
ANOVA followed by Tukey post hoc was used for the comparison of 
3 groups. Statistical analyses were conducted using Prism 6 for Mac 
OS X (version 6.b). All data are displayed as mean values±SD.

Novelty and Significance
What Is Known?
• Preamyloid oligomers (PAOs), similar to those observed in the brain of 
patients with Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, accumulate in human 
heart failure (HF).
• PAOs are toxic to isolated cardiac myocytes, and they cause HF in 
transgenic mouse models.
• The mechanisms of cardiac PAOs formation in acquired (nongenetic) 
forms of HF are unclear.
What New Information Does This Article Contribute?
• Using a dual immunostaining approach and a novel in-gel staining for 
amyloid coupled with mass spectrometry, we show that cardiac PAOs 
and short fibrils containing the cytoskeletal protein desmin accumulate 
in murine and human acquired HF.
• The small-molecule epigallocatechin gallate is able to deaggregate 
cardiac PAOs and short fibrils in vitro.
• Positron emission tomography is able to detect the increased levels of 
cardiac amyloid in murine acquired HF in vivo, in a noninvasive fashion.
HF represents the common end stage of several cardiac morbidi-
ties and is on the rise. The mechanisms underlying the transition 
from compensated left ventricle hypertrophy to maladaptive cardiac 
remodeling and failure remain ill defined. The observation that many 
forms of HF share impaired proteostasis, regardless of their cause, 
highlights the pivotal role of protein misfolding in this transition. 
Although protein mutations trigger the deposition of cardiac amy-
loid, our data suggest that a modified form of the cytoskeletal pro-
tein desmin acts as a nucleating seed in the formation of toxic PAOs 
in the heart, in the absence of any genetic mutation. We used new 
methodologies and optimized existing ones to specifically and ac-
curately detect PAOs ex vivo and in vivo. Importantly, we report that 
epigallocatechin gallate can deaggregate cardiac amyloid in vitro.

whether cardiac accumulation of PAOs occurs with acquired 
forms of HF, we used TAC, one of the best established experimen-
tal models of HF.17 Four weeks after TAC, mice developed ec-
centric cardiac hypertrophy and overt HF as documented by heart 
weight, lung congestion, and echocardiography (Online Table I). 
We then combined Western blot analysis with infrared fluores-
cence imaging (LI-COR) to simultaneously measure PAOs levels 
and their juxtaposition with desmin (Figure 1). The A11 antibody 
used here detects PAOs generated by different amyloidogenic se-
quences, such as Aβ, α-synuclein, prions, and others.18 Because 
the only other common feature among these species is toxicity, 
the antibody recognizes an epitope responsible for their toxicity 
(=toxic epitope).18 We first detected the concurrent increase in 
the formation of PAOs and desmin cleavage in TAC mice versus 
controls (≈2.5-fold; P=0.0006 and ≈2-fold; P=0.006, respectively, 
Figure 1A through 1C). We also found that wild-type (WT) desmin 
coenriches and comigrates with PAOs in this model (Figure 1A) 
and confirmed desmin cleavage by MS (Online Figure I).
Desmin Cardiac PAOs Accumulate in Human HF
To address the clinical relevance of these findings, we tested 
whether PAOs accumulate in human bioptic samples from di-
lated (nonischemic, dilated cardiomyopathy; Figure 1D through 
1F) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (Figure 1G through 1I). Using 
Figure 1. Desmin preamyloid oligomers (PAOs) accumulate in experimental and human heart failure (HF). PAOs (green, A11) 
and desmin (des, red) detected by Western blot analysis: PAOs comigrated with desmin in myofilament-enriched protein homogenates 
from transverse aortic constriction (TAC) mouse hearts (A). Densitometry highlighted a ≈2.5-fold increase in PAOs (P=0.0006; n=6 each; 
B) and a ≈2-fold increase in desmin cleavage (P=0.006; n=4 each; C) in TAC vs sham control (Ctrl) mice. An ≈2-fold increase of both 
desmin PAOs (P=0.0366; n=5 each; D and E) and desmin cleavage (P=0.0270; n=5 each; F) was also observed in dilated (nonischemic) 
cardiomyopathy (DCM) compared with nonfailing (NF) human hearts. An ≈3-fold increase in the A11 signal at ≈190 kDa, compatible with 
short fibrils, was evident in ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) patients compared with NF controls (P=0.00164; n=5/4 each; G and H), along 
with a ≈4-fold increase in desmin cleavage (P=0.0691; n=5/4 each; I). An image of the total protein stain by direct blue 71 (DB71, Sigma) 
is also provided for every blot. AU indicates arbitrary units.

the same double-staining approach, we confirmed a ≈2-fold in-
crease of both cardiac desmin PAOs (P=0.0366; Figure 1E) and 
desmin cleavage (P=0.0270; Figure 1F) in dilated cardiomyopa-
thy patients compared with nonfailing controls. Intriguingly, our 
approach was able to differentiate dilated cardiomyopathy from 
ischemic cardiomyopathy patients. In fact, a ≈3-fold increase in 
the A11 signal at ≈190 kDa (compatible with short fibrils, see be-
low) but not 55 kDa, was observed in ischemic cardiomyopathy 
patients compared with controls (P=0.00164; Figure 1H), along 
with a ≈4-fold increase in desmin cleavage (P=0.0691; Figure 1I). 
These data suggest that, although amyloid accumulation may rep-
resent a common denominator in different types of acquired, hu-
man HF, it is possible that the mechanisms and dynamics of their 
formation may vary. Follow-up studies that include a larger sam-
ple size are warranted to generalize the validity of these findings.
Epigallocatechin Gallate Deaggregates WT Desmin 
PAOs in Proteotoxic HF
To allow direct, downstream MS, we developed a novel 
staining approach based on a widely used histological stain 
for amyloid, Thioflavin T (ThT),1 and optimized it for clas-
sical, reducing SDS-PAGE (Figure 2A and 2B). We first 
validated the robustness of the method using cardiac extracts 
from R120G cryAB mice, a well-established model of car-
diac proteotoxicity. The native desmin sequence is conserved 
and Pattison et al19 demonstrated a causal relationship be-
tween PAOs and HF development in these animals. Using 
our new in-gel stain, we detected an ≈5-fold increase in the 
ThT-positive signal compatible with desmin (P=0.0005). The 
specificity of the staining was confirmed by an ≈50% decrease 
in the fluorescent signal on treatment of the cardiac extracts 
with 20 μmol/L epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG; Figure 2B; 
P=0.0196), which disrupts amyloid species.1,20 Lastly, we 
confirmed desmin’s presence in the ThT-positive bands by 
MS (Online Figure II). Taken together, these findings suggest 
that in a model of proteostasis insufficiency, where desmin’s 
main chaperone is mutated while its native sequence is con-
served, WT desmin contributes to the generation of PAOs. It 
is likely that other players and mechanisms contribute to the 
generation of PAOs, and we cannot exclude that desmin loss 
Figure 2. Wild-type desmin generates preamyloid oligomers (PAOs) in cryAB (α-B-crystallin) mice. We used Thioflavin T (ThT ) in-
gel stain to analyze cardiac extracts from R120G cryAB mice (R120G) and nontransgenic (NTG) controls under denaturing conditions. 
Protein extracts were incubated with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) or vehicle (DMSO [dimethyl sulfoxide]) to improve specificity (A). 
Densitometry revealed a ≈5-fold increase in a ThT-positive band at ≈55 kDa in R120G cryAB samples compared with NTG controls 
(P=0.0005; n=6 each). EGCG treatment resulted in a ≈50% reduction in amyloid, ThT-positive signal (P=0.0196; n=6 each; B). The same 
samples were analyzed by Western blot using dual staining for PAOs (green) and desmin (des, red; C). Densitometry revealed an ≈9-fold 
increase in desmin PAOs (P=0.0003; n=7/5 each; C and D) and a relative increase of ≈28-fold in desmin cleavage compared with intact 
desmin (n=7/5 each; E and F). Lastly, a ≈9-fold increase in cryAB was observed in R120G vs NTG (P=0.0137; n=7/5 each; G and H), 
although this signal did not overlap with that of desmin (or hence its PAOs). An image of the total protein stain by direct blue 71 (DB71, 
Sigma) is also provided for every blot. AU indicates arbitrary units; and CBB, Coomassie brillant blue.

of function could play an important role in the process. These 
aspects will be addressed in follow-up studies. Regardless of 
the relative contribution of desmin gain versus loss of function 
to the process, we think that, the effectiveness of EGCG in 
reducing the levels of amyloid in vitro opens new avenues for 
the therapeutic assessment of this and other small molecules 
for HF patients.
We further confirmed the increase of desmin PAOs (≈9-
fold; P=0.0003; Figure 2C and 2D) in the same proteotoxic 
model (R120G cryAB mice) using the dual immunostaining 
approach described above. When compared with nontransgen-
ic controls, these mice display amplified desmin cleavage, and 
the resulting fragment disproportionally increases (≈28-fold) 
with respect to intact desmin (Figure 2E and 2F). The A11 and 
the anti-cryAB antibodies are both raised in rabbit and, there-
fore, cannot be used jointly. We detected a faint A11 signal 
compatible with cryAB’s molecular weight, which was up-
regulated in R120G cryAB mice (data not shown). However, 
using the antidesmin antibody as a reference, we show that 
cryAB does not seem to directly participate in the formation 
of desmin cardiac PAOs (Figure 2G and 2H).
Phosphorylation at Ser31 Promotes Desmin 
Aggregation
We previously reported the accumulation of monophosphory-
lated cardiac desmin and characterized the first 2 phospho-
sites (Ser-27 and -31) in canine and human HF.1 The 2 sites 
are part of a consensus sequence for GSK3-β (glycogen 
synthase kinase 3-β), a kinase that classically recognizes a 
phosphorylated substrate (eg, pSer31) and phosphorylates 
a residue 3 amino acids upstream (eg, Ser-27). We also re-
ported that GSK3-β phosphorylates desmin in vitro1 and 
know that GSK3-β is inhibited in canine dyssynchronous 
HF.21 Therefore, we hypothesized that GSK3-β inhibition in 
HF leads to the accumulation of amyloidogenic pSer31 des-
min. Consequently, if the biphosphorylated form is the physi-
ological proteoform, it should be less prone to aggregation.1 
To test these hypotheses, we created bi- and mono-phospho-
mimetic desmin double mutants using site mutagenesis and 
overexpressed them in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes us-
ing lentiviral vectors expressing cytomegalovirus-driven and 
GFP-fused bi- and mono-phospho-mimetic desmin double 
mutants (S27D, S31D, or DD; and S27A, S31D, or AD). We 
found that in transduced cells, exogenous desmin accounts for 
≈25% of total desmin (Online Figure III), which well reflects 
the stoichiometry of phospho-desmin proteoforms in clinical 
samples.1 We then examined transduced cells by live imag-
ing using confocal, spinning disk microscopy to measure 
the proportion of contracting cells and desmin incorporation 
at the Z-bands. Expression of the desmin double phospho-
mimetic mutant (DD) resulted in the highest number of con-
tracting cells after 1 week in culture (P=0.032 versus WT and 
P=0.0012 versus AD; Figure 3A). This behavior was mirrored 
Figure 3. Functional analysis of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) transduced with phospho-mimetic desmin. NRVMs 
transduced with fluorescently-tagged desmin phospho-mimetic/null mutants for Ser-27 and -31 (S27D, S31D, or DD; and S27A, S31D, 
or AD) and wild-type (WT) desmin were live imaged. Every data point represents a confocal field, hence tens of cells. Videos were 
automatically analyzed to measure: contracting cells (A) and desmin Z-bands incorporation (B). A representative picture of DD mutants 
showing striation is provided in C. Desmin-positive aggregates were also measured by filter assay (n=4 each; D and E), and the amyloid 
nature of these aggregates was confirmed using Thioflavin T (ThT; E).

by the highest degree of desmin incorporation at the Z-bands 
(P=0.0001 versus WT and P=0.0005 versus AD; Figure 3B and 
3C). In keeping with our proposed model, this evidence sug-
gests that the doubly phosphorylated form is the physiological 
proteoform. Similarly, expression of pSer31 obligatory mono-
phospho-mimetic desmin (AD) resulted in decreased Z-bands 
incorporation (Figure 3B), as well as an increased formation 
of desmin-positive aggregates by filter assay, indicating that 
this is a pathological proteoform (P=0.012; Figure 3D and 
3E). ThT staining (newly combined here with the filter assay) 
independently confirmed the increased propensity of pSer31 
desmin to aggregate (Figure 3E). Interestingly, the average 
frequency of spontaneous contraction in pSer31-mimetic cells 
was 21% to 48% elevated in these mutants compared with 
the other groups (DD, P=0.0002 and WT, P<0.0001, respec-
tively; Online Figure IVA). We interpret this observation as a 
dysregulation of ion fluxes, in agreement with the known per-
meabilizing effect of reconstituted PAOs on isolated cardiac 
cells.2,22 Lastly, we used magnetic twist cytometry on isolated 
neonatal rat ventricular myocytes to assess whether desmin 
PTMs and aggregation result in a loss of function impacting 
cytoskeletal stability and cell biophysics. We found no signifi-
cance difference in cell stiffness in pSer31-mimetic (AD) and 
double phospho-mimetic (DD) mutants compared with WT, 
suggesting that loss of desmin function has no discernible 
contribution to the adverse phenotype observed in pSer31-
mimetic mutants (Online Figure IVB).
Desmin Amyloid Is Increased and Detectable in 
Pressure-Overload HF In Vivo
PET-computed tomography is increasingly recognized as a 
viable alternative to invasive biopsies to diagnose genetic car-
diac amyloidosis,23,24 but to our knowledge, it was never used 
to measure cardiac amyloid deposition in nongenetic HF be-
fore. Therefore, we used PET imaging for the unprecedented 
assessment of the accumulation of cardiac PAOs in vivo, in 
acquired HF. Notably, most of the tracers being investigated 
for the noninvasive, early detection of PAOs accumulation in 
Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases25 are chemical derivatives 
of ThT. This chemical homology allowed us to correlate our 
PET data with those from the ThT in-gel stain assay.
To test our hypothesis that PAOs are formed in acquired 
HF in vivo, we injected 4-week TAC and sham-operated mice 
each with 200 μCi of (18F) Amyvid and imaged them using 
PET-computed tomography. We found a significant, 13±4.2% 
increase in (18F) Amyvid cardiac uptake in TAC mice com-
pared with sham controls (P=0.0194), confirming the ex vivo 
data on increased PAOs accumulation in HF (Figure 4A and 
4B). There were no differences in regional perfusion as deter-
mined by the single-photon emission computed tomography

(PET) and ex vivo by Thioflavin T (ThT) in-gel stain. Four-week transverse aortic constriction (TAC) mice and sham controls were injected 
with the amyloid PET-tracer amyvid and imaged by PET. Representative images of the tracer signal, superimposed on computed tomography 
scans are provided (A top). The single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) tracer Cardiolite was used to rule out difference in 
myocardial blood flow. Normalized amyvid uptake was analyzed (n=8 each; A bottom). Normalized cardiac uptake of Amyvid is  plotted in

bands was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Online Figure V). An ≈21% decrease in the ThT signal on treatment with epigallocatechin gallate 
(EGCG) confirmed the specificity of the stain (C and D). AU indicates arbitrary units; CBB, coomassie brillant blue; and Ctrl, control.

tracer Cardiolite, ruling out increased Amyvid uptake because 
of differences in regional myocardial blood flow (Figure 4A). 
Because of the chemical similarity between Amyvid and ThT, 
it is likely that the tracer identifies the same desmin PAOs and 
short fibrils that we detected with our ThT in-gel stain.
Indeed, when we analyzed cardiac extracts from TAC mice 
and controls, a ThT-positive band was increased in TAC mice 
myocardia versus controls (≈3-fold; P=0.0005) and reduced on 
treatment with EGCG (≈21%; P=0.246; Figure 4C and 4D). 
We confirmed the presence of desmin in this band, which is 
compatible with short fibrils, by MS (Online Figure V).
This evidence, combined with the data on the amyloydo-
genic potential of pSer31-mimetic desmin, supports the no-
tion that post-translationally modified desmin acts as the seed 
for the nucleation of cardiac PAOs in acquired HF in vivo, as 
well as the potential diagnostic applications of our findings.
Discussion
Our study demonstrates that cardiac desmin PAOs accumu-
late in murine, pressure-overload–induced, and human HF. 
Combined with the marked accumulation of desmin PAOs in a 
model of chaperone insufficiency (R120G cryAB mice), these 
data suggest that desmin PTMs, much like protein mutations, 
facilitate misfolding of desmin in the failing heart. This hy-
pothesis draws further support from the present data showing 
that pSer31 phospho-mimetic desmin has an increased pro-
pensity to aggregate and that this is toxic for isolated cells. 
This study also allowed us to refine our newly developed in-
gel stain for amyloid and first combining ThT with a filter 
assay to confirm the amyloid nature of protein aggregates 
separated with these methods. From the translational stand-
point, we provide proof of concept on the efficacy of EGCG in 
deaggregating amyloid in pressure-overload–induced and pro-
teotoxic HF. Furthermore, we successfully measured the ac-
cumulation of PAOs in a well-established experimental model 
of acquired HF (TAC), noninvasively, using PET-computed 
tomography for the first time. Therefore, PET could constitute 
a viable, noninvasive tool to monitor PAOs formation, as well 
as their potential therapeutic reduction in acquired HF, in vivo.
Desmin is the major component of intermediate filaments 
(IFs) in cardiac myocytes.26 Unlike the other components of the 
cytoskeleton (mictrotubules and actin filaments), IFs are consti-
tuted by distinct proteins in different cell types, which arguably 
hampered the creation of a unified vision on their function. In 
muscle cells, IFs have classically been viewed as mere scaffolds, 
maintaining sarcomeric alignment and the relative positioning of 
different organelles.27,28 However, recent studies report numerous 
new functions for IFs in different cells types, including cardiac 
myocytes.26,29,30 The general consensus is that IFs were selected 
by evolution to confer protection against acute, mechanical stress 
in multicellular organisms without an exoskeleton. We propose 
that in the heart, this advantage came at a cost that is revealed 
under extended chronic stress: the formation of toxic PAOs. We 
and others demonstrated the accumulation of PAOs in clinical 
and experimental HF.1–5,22 However, the modality of formation of 
these species in the heart is unknown to date and unlike other 
established proteinopathies (Alzheimer, Parkinson, etc), the seed 
that initiates the nucleation process leading to cardiac PAOs for-
mation remains the object of debate in acquired forms of HF.6 
The only mechanistic studies to our knowledge include that of 
Subramanian et al,5 who recently demonstrated the accumulation 
of cofilin-2- or presenilin-positive PAOs in subsets of idiopathic 
dilated cardiomyopathy patients,2 and work from Despa et al22 
reporting amylin PAOs in models of diabetic cardiomyopathy. 
Here, we demonstrate that experimental, nongenetic models such 
as pressure-overload and human ischemic and nonischemic HF 
share the accumulation of desmin PAOs. In light of the evolu-
tionary role played by IFs in response to stress, it is tempting 
to speculate that the formation of desmin PAOs may represent a 
general mechanism of adaptation to cardiac overload.
Light-chain and TTR (transthyretin) amyloidosis (AL and 
ATTR, respectively) are 2 notorious examples of genetic car-
diac amyloidosis where the mutation of a protein sequence 
or its overproduction trigger the massive accumulation of 
cardiac amyloid.31 Although both are systemic amyloidosis, 
one of the organs that is most affected and usually determines 
prognosis is the heart.31 WT TTR also generates amyloid 
in the aging heart, in what was formerly known as cardiac 
senile amyloidosis and is now referred to as WT TTR amy-
loidosis (ATTRwt). The discovery that PTMs (eg, oxidative) 
modulate the propensity of WT TTR and its genetic variants 
to aggregate provides a potential explanation of why amyloid 
accumulates later in life32 and corroborates our theory on the 
contribution of toxic PTMs, rather than genetic mutations, to 
cardiac protein misfolding.1,6,9
The recent technological advances in the field of MS have 
unveiled a mind-blowing heterogeneity of protein PTMs.27 
There are currently ≈500 different types of PTMs listed in 
protein databases resulting from either chemical (eg, oxida-
tion) or enzymatic (eg, phosphorylation) reactions.6 These 
2 classes of PTMs modulate protein misfolding and are re-
spectively sustained by physical factors such as exceedingly 
oxidative or reductive environments and chronic imbalance of 
signaling pathways, all of which are well documented in HF 
and other proteinopathies.6 Therefore, we think that the elu-
cidation of the pathophysiological role of protein PTMs will 
greatly help our understanding of the molecular mechanisms 
underlying HF development.
Various evidence points to a protective role of EGCG in 
cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.33–35 Our data on 
the ability of EGCG in deaggregating cardiac amyloid in vitro 
provide a new interpretation for the protective effects of poly-
phenols. Therefore, we think that molecules that directly target 
cardiac PAOs formation could be of therapeutic value for HF 
patients. In fact, our new use of PET to measure cardiac PAOs 
noninvasively in acquired forms of HF demonstrates that PAOs 
are not artifacts because of protein extraction. From a transla-
tional standpoint, this exciting new application enables future 
studies addressing the temporal association between PAOs ac-
cumulation and cardiac dysfunction in vivo, as well as studies 
testing its diagnostic and prognostic applicability.
In conclusion, we report that desmin cleavage and phos-
phorylation contribute to the formation of cardiac aggregates 
and PAOs. WT desmin generates PAOs in murine and human 
HF. Combined with the increased propensity of pSer31 des-
min to aggregate, this new evidence supports a model where 
monophosphorylated and potentially cleaved desmin is the 
seed priming the nucleation process that leads to the formation

of cardiac PAOs in acquired HF. Further, this new knowledge 
opens a new avenue for the development of diagnostic and 
therapeutic tools for HF.
