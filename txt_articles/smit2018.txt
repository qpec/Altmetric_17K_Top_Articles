Summary
Background Ivermectin is being considered for mass drug administration for malaria due to its ability to kill 
mosquitoes feeding on recently treated individuals. However, standard, single doses of 150–200 μg/kg used for 
onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis have a short-lived mosquitocidal effect (<7 days). Because ivermectin is well 
tolerated up to 2000 μg/kg, we aimed to establish the safety, tolerability, and mosquitocidal efficacy of 3 day courses of 
high-dose ivermectin, co-administered with a standard malaria treatment.
Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority trial at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga 
Teaching and Referral Hospital (Kisumu, Kenya). Adults (aged 18–50 years) were eligible if they had confirmed 
symptomatic uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria and agreed to the follow-up schedule. Participants were 
randomly assigned (1:1:1) using sealed envelopes, stratified by sex and body-mass index (men: <21 vs ≥21 kg/m²; 
women: <23 vs ≥23 kg/m²), with permuted blocks of three, to receive 3 days of ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day, 
ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day, or placebo, all co-administered with 3 days of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Blood of 
patients taken on post-treatment days 0, 2 + 4 h, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 was fed to laboratory-reared Anopheles gambiae 
sensu stricto mosquitoes, and mosquito survival was assessed daily for 28 days after feeding. The primary outcome 
was 14-day cumulative mortality of mosquitoes fed 7 days after ivermectin treatment (from participants who received 
at least one dose of study medication). The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02511353.
Findings Between July 20, 2015, and May 7, 2016, 741 adults with malaria were assessed for eligibility, of whom 
141 were randomly assigned to receive ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day (n=47), ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day (n=48), or 
placebo (n=46). 128 patients (91%) attended the primary outcome visit 7 days post treatment. Compared with placebo, 
ivermectin was associated with higher 14 day post-feeding mosquito mortality when fed on blood taken 7 days post 
treatment (ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day risk ratio [RR] 2·26, 95% CI 1·93–2·65, p<0·0001; hazard ratio [HR] 6·32, 
4·61–8·67, p<0·0001; ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day RR 2·18, 1·86–2·57, p<0·0001; HR 4·21, 3·06–5·79, p<0·0001). 
Mosquito mortality remained significantly increased 28 days post treatment (ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day RR 1·23, 
1·01–1·50, p=0·0374; and ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day 1·21, 1·01–1·44, p=0·0337). Five (11%) of 45 patients 
receiving ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day, two (4%) of 48 patients receiving ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day, and none of 
46 patients receiving placebo had one or more treatment-related adverse events.
Interpretation Ivermectin at both doses assessed was well tolerated and reduced mosquito survival for at least 28 days 
after treatment. Ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day for 3 days provided a good balance between efficacy and tolerability, and 
this drug shows promise as a potential new tool for malaria elimination.

Introduction
Ivermectin, a broad-spectrum antiparasitic endectocide 
used for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis control,1 
also kills malaria mosquitoes (Anopheles spp) that feed on 
recently treated individuals and has been proposed as a 
potential novel method to reduce malaria transmission.2 
Ivermectin has a different method of action from other 
insecticides, and might be effective against mosquito 
populations that rest and feed outdoors, which have 
escaped the killing effects of contact insecticides deployed 
on long-lasting insecticidal nets and through indoor 
residual spraying. Ivermectin could also be effective against 
mosquitoes that are resistant to insecticides used for long-
lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying.3
However, several entomological studies have shown that 
the mosquitocidal effects of standard 150–200 μg/kg doses

of ivermectin are short-lived (<7 days).4–9 Population-level 
modelling suggests higher doses of ivermectin, resulting 
in longer lasting mosquitocidal activity, could provide a 
substantial boost to the effects of mass drug administration 
with the antimalarial dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, a 
strategy that is being deployed for malaria transmission 
reduction and elimination.10,11
Ivermectin has an excellent safety profile.2 More 
than 2·5 billion treatments have been distributed as 
part of mass drug administration for onchocerciasis 
and lymphatic filariasis control.12 A single dose of 
300–400 μg/kg is recommended when these mass drug 
administrations are done yearly,13 a dose of 400 μg/kg 
repeated after 1 week has been shown to be safe and effective 
in children with head lice,14 and doses of 800 μg/kg repeated 
yearly or every 3 months were safely tested in hundreds of 
adults with onchocerciasis.15–19 Experience with higher doses 
shows that ivermectin is well tolerated in human beings15–20 
up to 2000 μg/kg,20 (ie, ten times the dose currently approved 
by the US Food and Drug Administration), apart from in 
patients infected with Loa loa.
We aimed to establish the safety, tolerability, and 
mosquitocidal efficacy of 3 day courses of ivermectin 
600 μg/kg per day or 300 μg/kg per day, co-administered 
with a standard 3 day course of dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine, to identify safe and practical regimens for 
malaria elimination.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel three arm, superiority trial at the Jaramogi 
Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital 
(JOOTRH; Kisumu, Kenya). Since mosquito feeding 
involved around 150 mosquitoes (Anopheles gambiae 
sensu stricto) per feed, the study had a clustered 
design, with the patient as the unit of randomisation 
and the mosquito as the unit of analysis. Details of our 
study design and procedures have been published 
elsewhere.21
Adults attending the outpatient departments were 
eligible if they gave written informed consent, had 
symptomatic 
uncomplicated 
Plasmodium 
falciparum 
malaria confirmed by microscopy or rapid diagnostic test, 
were aged 18–50 years, and agreed to the follow-up 
schedule. Exclusion criteria were signs or symptoms of 
severe malaria, inability to provide written informed 
consent, pregnancy or lactation, known hypersensitivity to 
ivermectin or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, QTc interval 
460 ms or higher on electrocardiogram, body-mass index 
(BMI) less than 16 kg/m² or more than 32 kg/m², 
haemoglobin concentration less than 9 g/dL, history of 
ivermectin use in the last month, dihydro 
artemisinin-
piperaquine use in the last 12 weeks, travel to Loa loa 
endemic countries, history of chronic illness (eg, 
HIV
/AIDS, tuberculosis, diabetes), use of tuberculosis or 
antiretroviral medication, and previous enrolment in the 
same study.
This study was approved by the ethics committees of 
JOOTRH, the Kenya Medical Research Institute 
(KEMRI), the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, and 
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC), with the CDC approving reliance on KEMRI’s 
ethics committee.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed on Nov 15, 2017, for studies assessing 
Anopheles spp mortality following feeding on blood of human 
beings treated with ivermectin, using the search terms 
“ivermectin” AND (“anopheles” OR “malaria”) AND “clinical 
trial” [publication type]. The search was unrestricted by 
language or publication date. Using this search and by scanning 
reference lists of articles and trial registers, we identified three 
publications in peer-reviewed journals. An early study found 
that a single dose of ivermectin 250 μg/kg in a human 
volunteer had an effect for 2 weeks after treatment, but 
subsequent trials with a single dose of ivermectin 200 μg/kg 
showed no effect on mosquito survival at 14 days after 
treatment and a repeated dose of 200 μg/kg given on 
days 0 and 2 showed only a modest effect on survival 7 days 
after treatment. Population modelling predicted that the 
mosquitocidal effects found in these trials would only have a 
modest effect on reduction of malaria prevalence if distributed 
in mass drug administration with dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine, although higher doses of ivermectin were 
predicted to have a greater and longer-lasting effect.
Added value of this study
We present the first trial assessing the safety, tolerability, 
and mosquitocidal efficacy of repeated high doses of ivermectin 
on mosquito mortality. Our findings show that ivermectin 
600 μg/kg per day and 300 μg/kg per day for 3 days was well 
tolerated and increased mosquito mortality for at least 28 days 
after treatment, making ivermectin a promising new tool for 
malaria elimination.  Using population-level modelling, we also 
showed that adding ivermectin 600 or 300 μg/kg per day for 
3 days to mass drug administration with dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine reduced malaria prevalence by an additional 
56% (600 μg) and 44% (300 μg) in low prevalence areas (10%), 
and 61% (600 μg) and 54% (300 μg) in high prevalence 
areas (30%).
Implications of all the available evidence
Mass drug administration and seasonal malaria 
chemoprevention are being deployed in countries across the 
globe. Adding high dose ivermectin to mass drug 
administration and seasonal malaria chemoprevention could 
substantially boost effects on malaria transmission reduction.

Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive either 
0 (placebo), 300, or 600 μg/kg per day ivermectin for 
3 days, co-administered with dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine. Randomisation was stratified by body mass 
index (BMI) and sex (men: <21 vs ≥21 kg/m²; women: 
<23 vs ≥23 kg/m²) because ivermectin accumulates in fat 
tissue,22 potentially acting as a slow-release reservoir, and 
has a longer effective half-life in women.9 An independent 
statistician 
computer-generated 
the 
randomisation 
sequence per strata using permuted blocks of three.
Allocation concealment was achieved using sequentially 
numbered, sealed opaque envelopes prepared by the study 
pharmacist from KEMRI (Kisumu, Kenya). Participants 
were enrolled, randomised, and followed up by study staff. 
Each participant, regardless of treatment, received the 
same number of tablets based on their weight. Patients 
given ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day received only 
ivermectin tablets, patients given ivermectin 300 μg/kg 
per day received half the number of ivermectin tablets and 
an equal number of placebo tablets, and the placebo arm 
received only placebo tablets. The study pharmacist was 
the only person not masked to treatment assignment. All 
other individuals, including all participants and all study 
staff that randomised participants, assessed outcomes, 
and analysed data, were masked to treatment allocation.
Procedures
Ivermectin dose was based on previous pharmacokinetic 
modelling, which showed that a 3 day regimen of 
600 
μg/kg 
per 
day 
achieved 
similar 
median 
(5–95 percentiles) maximum drug concentrations (Cmax) 
to single-dose ivermectin 800 μg/kg regimens, the 
highest dose for which there is substantial clinical 
experience, and increased the median time above the 
lethal concentration able to kill 50% of mosquitoes 
(16 ng/mL) from 2 days to 7 days. A 300 μg/kg per day 
dose was chosen at 50% of the higher dose to allow 
evaluation of dose response.21
Patients received a bodyweight-based dose of dihydro- 
artemisinin-piperaquine (36 to <75 kg three tablets, 
≥75kg four tablets; 320/40 mg Eurartesim; Sigma Tau, 
Pomezia, Italy) once a day for 3 days, together with 
ivermectin or placebo (45 to <55 kg five tablets, 
55 to <65 kg six tablets, 65 to <75 kg seven tablets, 75 to <85 kg 
eight tablets, 85 to <95 kg nine tablets, 95 to <105 kg 
ten tablets; 6 mg Iver P per day; Laboratorio Elea, Buenos 
Aires, Argentina). Ivermectin and placebo tablets had a 
break line, such that half tablets could be given. All 
treatment was directly observed. Patients were seen on 
days 2, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 to provide blood samples and 
for outcome assessments.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was cumulative mosquito mortality 
14 days after membrane feeding (henceforth referred to as 
post feeding) on blood taken from patients who started 
the 3 day ivermectin and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine 
regimen 7 days earlier (henceforth referred to as post 
treatment). Secondary efficacy outcomes were daily 
survival of mosquitoes up to day 10, 14, or 28 after 
membrane feeding on blood taken from the patients on 
days 0 (enrolment), day 2 + 4 h (ie, Cmax), 7, 10, 14, 21, and 
28 post treatment. Oocyst prevalence was measured by 
PCR 10 days after feeding for each feed. Additional 
secondary outcomes will be reported separately. Safety 
outcomes included pupil diameter, haemoglobin, and 
adverse events assessed by study clinicians at each post-
treatment study visit, aspartate transaminase (AST) and 
alanine transaminase (ALT) measured each visit until 
day 14, and QTc interval measures at days 0, 2 (before the 
third dose), 2 + 4 h (Cmax), and 28. Adverse events were 
classified according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities preferred terms.
Statistical analysis
Details of the sample size and power calculations have 
been published elsewhere.21 Briefly, the study required 
141 participants (47 per arm) and was designed (power 80%, 
α=0·05) to detect a relative increase in the 14 day post-
feeding cumulative mortality among mosquitoes (fed on 
blood taken 7 days after treatment) of 30% (risk ratio 
[RR] 1·30) from 24% in the placebo group to 31·2% in the 
ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day group, and a further 
25% (RR 1·246) increase from 31·2% in the ivermectin 
300 μg/kg per day group to 38·9% in the ivermectin 
600 μg/kg per day group, using clusters of 100 anopheline 
mosquitoes 
assuming 
an 
intracluster 
correlation 
coefficient of 0·0622,9 and allowing for 10% non-feeders 
and 6·5% loss to follow-up of participants by day 7
. 
A statistical analysis plan was developed before the 
analysis.21 The analysis was based on the intention-to-treat 
population, defined as all mosquitoes that fed on the 
blood of patients who received at least one dose of study

medication, regardless of whether the patient completed 
the last study visit. The effects on the primary and 
secondary binary endpoints were compared using log-
binomial regression to derive RR values estimated with 
generalised estimating equations using an exchangeable 
covariance structure, taking the cluster design into 
account. Survival time of mosquitoes post feeding was 
analysed using Cox regression, adjusted for mosquito 
clusters (using shared frailty with γ distribution) to derive 
hazard ratios (HRs). Continuous safety outcomes were 
analysed with generalised estimating equation models 
(Gaussian distribution, identity link function, and 
exchangeable covariance structures) to derive mean 
differences, or generalised linear models when no cluster 
effect existed for an outcome. Secondary per protocol 
analyses and multivariable analyses adjusted for sex, BMI, 
mosquito age, and mosquito crowding were also done. 
Per protocol analysis included mosquitoes fed on blood of 
participants who took all three doses of both ivermectin 
and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine daily at the same 
time as the first dose (plus or minus 6 h) within a 
48 h timeline, and as per their weight band and study arm 
allocation. Prespecified subgroup analysis included sex 
and BMI. Analyses were done using SAS version 9.4 and 
Stata version 14.2. Post-hoc population modelling was 
done using the Imperial College malaria transmission 
model to predict the effect of adding ivermectin to mass 
drug administration on all-age malaria prevalence 
(appendix).10 The trial was overseen by a data monitoring 
committee;21 members resided across the globe and 
meetings took place via teleconference. The study is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02511353.
Role of the funding source
The funders of the study had no role in study design, 
data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. The corresponding author (MRS) 
and trial statisticians (DuW and TC) had full access to all 
the data in the study and the corresponding author 
(MRS) and FOtK had final responsibility for the decision 
to submit for publication.
Results
Between July 20, 2015, and May 7, 2016, 741 adults with 
malaria were assessed for eligibility, of whom 141 were 
randomised (table 1). 128 patients (91%) attended the 
primary outcome visit 7 days post treatment (figure 1). 
All mosquitoes contributed to the analyses (no missing 
mosquito data).
Mosquitoes fed on blood taken from patients 7 days after 
treatment had a higher mortality by day 14 post feeding 
than did those fed on blood from placebo recipients 
(ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day 96·7%; ivermectin 
300 μg/kg per day 92·7%; placebo 41·4%) in generalised 
estimating equation models (primary analysis; ivermectin 
600 μg/kg per day, RR 2·26, 95% CI 1·93–2·65, p<0·0001; 
ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day, 2·18, 1·86–2·57, p<0·0001; 
appendix) and Cox-regression models (secondary analysis; 
ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day, HR 6·32, 95% CI 4·61–8·67, 
p<0·0001; ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day, 4·21, 3·06–5·79, 
p<0·0001; figure 2; appendix). The effect on mosquito 
mortality declined post treatment but remained signifi-
cantly increased 28 days after treatment with ivermectin 
600 μg/kg per day (RR 1·23, 1·01–1·50, p=0·0374) and for 
ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day (1·21, 1·01–1·44, p=0·0337; 
appendix). Similar results were seen in the per-protocol 
and multivariable analyses (appendix).
Ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day was more lethal than was 
ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day (figure 2), and this 
difference in effect was significant from day 2 + 4 h up to 
14 days post treatment in adjusted analyses (HR 1·54, 
1·11–2·14, p=0·0098; appendix). Subgroup analysis 
showed the effect was greatest in women (interaction 
term for sex on day 7 post treatment, ivermectin 
600 μg/kg per day, p=0·0078; 300 μg/kg per day, 
p=0·0087) and patients with an above median BMI 
(≥22 kg/m²; interaction term for BMI on day 7 post 
treatment, 600 μg/kg per day, p=0·0007; 300 μg/kg per 
day, p=0·0019; appendix). Mosquito median survival 
times for both ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day and 
ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day remained below 10 days 
(short duration of the extrinsic cycle) for at least 14 days 
post treatment, and remained below 14 days (long 
duration of the extrinsic cycle) for the entire 28 day study 
duration after treatment (figure 3). By contrast, median 
survival in the placebo arm was always more than 14 days 
for all post-treatment feeds (figure 3). Gametocytaemia 
and oocyst prevalence were low in all study arms from 
baseline onwards (appendix).
Two serious adverse events were reported: one QT 
prolongation of 510 ms with T-wave inversion in the 
ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day group and one anaphylactic 
reaction, probably to piperaquine or ivermectin, in the

ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day group (table 2; appendix). 
Treatment was discontinued for the patient with 
anaphylactic reaction.
The highest dose (600 μg/kg per day) ivermectin 
recipients had more adverse events than did those who 
received placebo (table 2). Treatment-related adverse events 
showed evidence of a dose-response, predomi 
nantly 
reflecting transient minor visual disturbances (tables 2, 3; 
appendix). All adverse events were non-severe (grade ≤2), 
except for three patients with pre-existing liver enzyme 
elevations (two at grade 1 and one at grade 3) who showed 
grade 3 elevations after treatment (appendix).

(during follow-up), and malaria recurrence did not differ 
between treatment groups (table 2). There was a greater 
reduction in haemoglobin in the ivermectin 600 μg/kg 
per day group than in the placebo group, but not in the 
300 μg/kg per day group versus placebo (table 2; 
appendix).
The Imperial College malaria transmission model 
predicted that adding ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day for 
3 days to mass drug administration with dihydro- 
artemisinin-piper 
aquine could result in greater  2-year 
mean reductions in all-age population prevalence of 
malaria versus dihydro 
artemisinin-piperaquine alone 
(relative risk reduction of 61·0% in high transmission 
areas and 55·6% in low transmission areas). For 
ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day for 3 days this relative 
risk reduction was 54·3% in high transmission areas 
and 44·4% in low transmission areas (figure 4; 
appendix). In low-transmission settings both iver- 
mectin regimens are predicted to cause prevalence to 
remain at less than 0·1% for more than 6 months, 
indicating that local elimination would be possible in 
the absence of importation (figure 4; appendix).
Discussion
Adding 3 days of ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day or 
600 μg/kg per day to a standard 3-day treatment course of 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was well tolerated and 
associated with a large effect on A gambiae sensu stricto 
mortality among laboratory-reared mosquitoes that had 
fed on blood taken from ivermectin-treated patients.
Mosquitocidal effects were stronger and lasted longer 
than observed in a previous study9 (28 days in our study vs 
7 days using the standard 200 μg/kg single dose on day 0 
or repeated doses on days 0 and 2). Parameterising post-
feeding mosquito mortality in the Imperial College 
malaria transmission model9 using estimates from our 
trial predicted that adding either ivermectin 300 μg/kg 
per day or 600 μg/kg per day for 3 days to repeated rounds 
of mass drug administration with dihydroartemisinin-
piperquine would provide a 44–61% boost to the 
population-level effect on malaria transmission reduction. 
The combination of an artemisinin-based combination 
therapy and ivermectin targets both the malaria parasite 
and its vector, a unique property among malaria 
interventions that has the potential to reduce onward 
transmission of antimalarial drug-resistant parasites. The 
long effect duration, tolerability, and unique mosquito 
killing action of these regimens make ivermectin a 
promising new option for malaria elimination.
The 44–61% predicted boost to the effect of mass drug 
administration, even with 300 μg/kg per day, is notable, 
especially against a background of existing long-lasting 
insecticide-treated bednet use, and is higher than the 
estimated effect of adding low-dose primaquine.22 All 
individuals receiving ivermectin contribute to suppression 
of the vector population, regardless of whether they have 
malaria or are gametocytaemic, whereas primaquine only 
prevents transmission from individuals that are 
gametocytaemic. Reduced mosquito numbers and the 
killing of mosquitoes before any ingested gametocytes 
complete sporogony help prevent the resurgence of 
transmission during the waning of the prophylactic 
period of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Modelled 
mortality estimates for ivermectin could be conservative, 
since mosquitoes in the wild endure adverse natural 
conditions and therefore might be more vulnerable to its 
lethal effects compared with mosquitoes kept in a 
laboratory in optimal survival conditions. Furthermore, 
we only considered the effect on the lifespan of the 
mosquitoes, and not any secondary effects such as the 
effect on fecundity, or the ability of affected but surviving 
mosquitoes to fly, feed, and transmit malaria.3,5

The observed 28-day mosquitocidal effect was longer 
than the 7 days predicted by our pharmacodynamic 
simulation model based on published pharmacokinetic 
parameters of ivermectin and LC50 (the lethal dose at which 
50% of the population is killed in a given time period) 
values for A gambiae sensu stricto.21 Three previous human 
studies4,6,9 assessed the long-term effect of ivermectin on 
mosquito survival. An early study4 found that a single dose 
of ivermectin 250 μg/kg in a human volunteer had an 
effect for 2 weeks post treatment, but subsequent trials 
with a single dose of 200 μg/kg showed no effect on 
mosquito survival at 14 days post treatment6 and a repeated 
dose of 200 μg/kg given on days 0 and 2 showed only a 
modest effect on survival 7 days after treatment.9 Further 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling of our 
data is ongoing to establish whether this prolonged 
mosquitocidal effect is due to an unidentified active 
ivermectin metabolite, or can be solely explained by 
residual concentrations of the parent compound. Future 
studies should also assess any potential drug–drug 
interactions between ivermectin and possible antimalarial 
partner drugs, including dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, 
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-amodiaquine, 
and 
triple 
artemisinin-based combination therapies. In our study, we 
did not see any effect of ivermectin on piperaquine 
induced QT prolongation. We also intended to assess the 
sporogonic effect of ivermectin; however, gametocyte and 
oocyst numbers were already low before treatment, which 
is perhaps unsurprising in this malaria-exposed adult 
population. Future studies assessing in-vivo effects on 
sporogony could consider enrolling only gametocytaemic 
individuals.
We stratified study allocation by sex and BMI, since 
these 
are 
known 
determinants 
of 
ivermectin 
pharmacokinetics.9 Our subgroup analysis showed that 
the effect of ivermectin on mosquito mortality was 
significantly greater in women, and in those with 
higher BMI. The greater effect in women could have 
been driven by accumulation of ivermectin in fat 
tissue,23 since within the inclusion range of our study 
(age 18–50 years; BMI 16–32), at an equal age and BMI, 
women have 1·3–2·5 times more body fat than do 
men.24
Extensive experience with ivermectin has attested to its 
safety. The excellent safety profile of ivermectin can be 
explained by its principal pharmacological mechanism of 
action: in invertebrates, ivermectin causes the opening of 
glutamate-gated chloride channels, resulting in flaccid 
paralysis and death.2 Glutamate-gated chloride channels 
are not present in human beings. Other weakly sensitive 
channels are found in the human CNS, but the blood–
brain barrier limits drug access to these channels.2 Severe 
adverse events have predominantly been in individuals 
with L loa, probably due to rapid lysis of parasite 
biomass.25 In areas endemic for L loa filariasis, 
pretreatment assessment of individuals for L loa is 
recommended.26
In previous studies in more than 400 individuals, 
single-dose ivermectin of at least 800 μg/kg, which was 
predicted to achieve a similar Cmax as ivermectin 600 μg/kg 
per day for 3 days, was safe and well tolerated.21 In our 
study, both high-dose ivermectin regimens seemed well 
tolerated overall, although more patients experienced 
adverse events over the 28 day follow-up period with 
ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day than with placebo. This 
result was partly explained by a higher number of 
patients with pneumonia, but these events were unlikely 
to be due to ivermectin, since only one occurred in the 
week of ivermectin administration, and since there were 
no cases in the ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day group there 
was no evidence of a dose–response effect. However, 
ivermectin seemed to be associated with dose-dependent 
Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine

visual disturbances during the dose administration 
period (four cases in the ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day 
group and two cases in the ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day 
group vs none in the placebo group). All these events 
were mild, transient, and of short duration (a few 
minutes to a few hours), consistent with transient 
subjective ocular complaints reported in previous 
onchocerciasis studies,17–19 which could not be explained 
by microfilaria concentrations and were hypothesised to 
reflect mild dose-related toxic effects of ivermectin. 
Ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day was also associated with a 
0·35 g/dL greater reduction in haemoglobin, but the 
clinical relevance of this is unclear, since by 28 days post-
treatment haemoglobin concentrations were similar in 
all groups. This result warrants further exploration in 
future studies to establish if it was a chance finding, 
since this did not occur with ivermectin 300 μg/kg per 
day and ivermectin is not known to decrease haemoglobin 
concentrations.13 
As expected, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine was 
associated with prolongation of the QTcF interval, which 
exceeded 500 ms in one patient. However, no evidence 
was seen that the piperaquine-induced QT prolongation 
differed between arms. One patient in the ivermectin 
600 μg/kg per day group developed an anaphylactic 
reaction after the first dose of dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine and ivermectin, which resolved rapidly 
following treatment. Allergic and anaphylactic reactions 
are known side-effects of both dihydroartemisinin-
piperaquine and ivermectin. Since the same patient who 
had this reaction tolerated artemether-lumefantrine, 
which also contains an artemisinin derivative, the 
reaction might reflect the use of piperaquine or 
ivermectin. Three patients had grade 3 elevated liver 
enzymes; although all these patients had pre-existing 
increases, two were just above the upper limit of normal 
(grade 1) at baseline and increased to grade 3, whereas 
the third had grade 3 elevation at baseline. Liver enzyme 
elevations are known to be caused by both ivermectin 
and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. The frequency of 
liver enzyme elevations, allergic reactions to either 
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or ivermectin, and 
subjective visual complaints might be important 
determinants of the potential use of ivermectin 600 μg/kg 
per day for 3 days or ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day for 
3 days as part of mass drug administration, and requires 
further evaluation in larger population-based studies.
A limitation of our study is that it enrolled participants 
with symptomatic malaria, whereas possible future 
applications of ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day or ivermectin 
300 μg/kg per day might involve mass drug administration 
with artemisinin-based combination therapies targeting 
mostly asymptomatic carriers and uninfected individuals. 
Symptomatic patients were chosen because this group 
was thought to potentially benefit from, and be the most 
likely to comply with, the frequent follow-up schedule. 
Although it is unlikely that symptomatic malaria 
substantially modifies the mosquitocidal effect of 
ivermectin, whether the good tolerance of ivermectin 
600 μg/kg per day and ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day 
observed in our study applies to uninfected and 
asymptomatic individuals is unclear and should be 
assessed in future (field) studies. 
A further limitation recognises that programme 
implementation for malaria prevention will also include 
children, and use multiple rounds of mass drug 
administration. It is thus important that further 
pharmacokinetic, tolerability, safety, and efficacy studies 
be done with repeated courses of ivermectin and among 
children, in whom the pharmacokinetics of ivermectin 
might differ from adults. The population-level model 
presumed similar efficacy in children aged 4 years and 
older as in adults, since no studies were identified that 
assessed the pharmacokinetics of ivermectin in children. 
In areas of piperaquine resistance, such as the Greater 
Mekong subregion, future studies should assess the 
safety and efficacy of ivermectin when used in 
combination with other artemisinin-based combination 
therapies, including with triple artemisinin-based 
combination therapies.27 
Another possible limitation is that our study used a 
homogeneous laboratory reared mosquito colony known 
to be sensitive to pyrethroids and other classes of public 
health insecticides, which might not be reflective of wild 
populations. However, previous work has shown that 
ivermectin affects survival of all tested anophelines 
(≥17 species tested),28 and there is no evidence 
that pyrethroid resistance mechanisms cross-target 
ivermectin,3 thus there is no reason to believe the 
findings from our study would be much different for 
other Anopheles spp. Nevertheless, future studies would 
be beneficial to examine possible (heterogeneity of) 
effects of ivermectin against wild populations and other 
species, including examining any possible cross-
resistance with other insecticides. Although no resistance 
in mosquitoes has been described following decades of 
ivermectin mass drug administration for onchocerciasis 
and lymphatic filariasis, vigilant resistance monitoring 
should be ensured if high-dose ivermectin is deployed at 
scale. Based on A gambiae sensu stricto anthropophily, 
the model assumed 92% of bloodmeals are taken from 
people; however, in areas in which more zoophilic vectors 
such as Anopheles arabiensis are prevalent, administering 
endectocides to animals might be considered, although 
the effect of such interventions remains to be explored. 
Furthermore, we did not adjust for multiple 
comparisons as per the protocol and the statistical 
analysis plan, although published views regarding this 
differ. Lastly, the model does not take importation of new 
infections into the area into account, which results in 
more optimistic predictions about the effect of mass 
drug administration with ivermectin. Estimating realistic 
importation rates is problematic since this is highly 
heterogeneous in different areas and at different times in

the transmission season and depends on the size of the 
implementation area.
The relatively small difference in predicted impact 
between ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day and ivermectin 
600 μg/kg per day in the Imperial College malaria 
transmission model reflects the difference between daily 
mortality and cumulative mortality in the first 10 to 14 days 
post feeding, cumulative mortality being the main 
determinant of transmission potential in the model. 
Although with ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day more 
mosquitoes survive for 2 days, which is the time when they 
are due for their next, potentially infectious, bloodmeal, by 
the time that they have completed sporogony and become 
infectious (ie, from around 10 days after feeding onward) 
the difference in cumulative mortality, and thus the 
potential for onward transmission, is smaller. This is 
illustrated by a lack of difference in mosquitocidal effect at 
day 7 post treatment between the 600 μg/kg per day and 
300 μg/kg per day dose groups in the generalised 
estimating equations model (RR=1·03; appendix), which 
compares cumulative mortality, versus the Cox model 
(HR=1·50; appendix), which compares daily hazards. The 
difference between ivermectin 600 μg/kg per day and 
ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day became more apparent post 
treatment from day 10 onwards, when ivermectin 
concentrations decreased further (appendix). Our data 
suggest a dose of ivermectin 300 μg/kg per day for 3 days 
would provide a good balance between efficacy and 
tolerability, considering the difference in cumulative 
efficacy and the higher rate of adverse events for ivermectin 
600 μg/kg per day for 3 days. The relatively wide therapeutic 
index of ivermectin also suggests that practical dosing 
regimens could be considered based on age, height, or 
fewer weight strata than used in our study.
High-dose ivermectin could potentially also have 
important implications for other vector-borne diseases, 
transmitted by aedes mosquitoes (including Zika virus, 
dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever) or culex 
mosquitoes (including West Nile fever, lymphatic 
filariasis, and Japanese encephalitis), and other insect-
borne and tick-borne diseases (including sleeping 
sickness and Lyme disease).3 Ivermectin is already being 
distributed at scale for lymphatic filariasis and 
onchocerciasis 
control. 
Combining 
high-dose 
ivermectin mass drug administration for malaria with 
these other programs could offer many synergistic 
benefits in terms of logistics and cost savings in areas 
where these diseases are co-endemic.29 Furthermore, 
distribution of high-dose ivermectin as part of seasonal 
malaria chemoprevention could be considered, which 
also involves 3-day regimens and monthly population-
based campaigns three to four times per year; this 
strategy could include older siblings and adults living in 
the same communities as children targeted by seasonal 
malaria chemoprevention.30
Our study showed that ivermectin was well tolerated 
and able to kill mosquitoes feeding on people for at least 
28 days after treatment, making it a promising new tool 
for malaria elimination. Next steps should include 
assessment of high-dose ivermectin safety, tolerability, 
mosquitocidal efficacy, and pharmacokinetics in younger 
age groups, and with repeated courses, before its effect 
on malaria transmission can be assessed through mass 
drug administration.
