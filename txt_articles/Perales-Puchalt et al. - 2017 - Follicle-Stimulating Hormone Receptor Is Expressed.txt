Abstract
Purpose: To define the safety and effectiveness of T cells
redirected against follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR)-
expressing ovarian cancer cells.
Experimental Design: FSHR expression was determined by
Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and qPCR in 77
human ovarian cancer specimens from 6 different histologic
subtypes and 20 human healthy tissues. The effectiveness of
human T cells targeted with full-length FSH in vivo was determined
against a panel of patient-derived xenografts. Safety and effec-
tiveness were confirmed in immunocompetent tumor-bearing
mice, using constructs targeting murine FSHR and syngeneic
T cells.
Results: FSHR is expressed in gynecologic malignancies of
different histologic types but not in nonovarian healthy tissues.
Accordingly, T cells expressing full-length FSHR-redirected chi-
meric receptors mediate significant therapeutic effects (including
tumor rejection) against a panel of patient-derived tumors in vivo.
In immunocompetent mice growing syngeneic, orthotopic, and
aggressive ovarian tumors, fully murine FSHR-targeted T cells also
increased survival without any measurable toxicity. Notably,
chimeric receptors enhanced the ability of endogenous tumor-
reactive T cells to abrogate malignant progression upon adoptive
transfer into na€
�ve recipients subsequently challenged with the
same tumor. Interestingly, FSHR-targeted T cells persisted as
memory
lymphocytes
without
noticeable
PD-1–dependent
exhaustion during end-stage disease, in the absence of tumor cell
immunoediting. However, exosomes in advanced tumor ascites
diverted the effector activity of this and other chimeric receptor–
transduced T cells away from targeted tumor cells.
Conclusions: T cells redirected against FSHRþ tumor cells with
full-length FSH represent a promising therapeutic alternative
against a broad range of ovarian malignancies, with negligible
toxicity even in the presence of cognate targets in tumor-free
ovaries. Clin Cancer Res; 23(2); 441–53. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC) of different histologic types
are responsible for the death of more than 14,000 women each
year in the United States (1). Despite advances in surgery and
chemotherapy, 5-year survival rates have barely changed in the
last 40 years. Ovarian cancer is, however, an immunogenic tumor
(2–10). Therefore, immunotherapies offer great promise to
reverse this dismal prognosis (11, 12).
In recent years, transferring autologous T cells engineered to
express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) has shown impressive
cures for patients with chemoresistant hematologic malignancies
(13–15). However, several hurdles have thus far prevented the
success of this technology against solid tumors, including ovarian
cancer. The most challenging obstacle in developing CAR thera-
pies is the identification of specific targets expressed on the surface
of tumor cells that are not shared with healthy tissues. Identifying
such targets is crucial for avoiding potentially deadly side effects.
The follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) is thought to
be selectively expressed in women in ovarian granulosa cells (16)
and at low levels in the ovarian endothelium (17). Most impor-
tantly, this surface antigen is expressed in 50% to 70% of serous
ovarian carcinomas, although its expression in other histologic
types of ovarian cancer remains unknown (18–25). In addition,
recent studies indicate that circulating levels of FSH correlate with
worse outcome in patients with ovarian cancer (26). Given that
oophorectomy is a standard procedure in the treatment of ovarian
cancer, targeting the FSHR should not cause damage to healthy
tissues. Therefore, FSHR could be an ideal therapeutic target to
direct T cells against ovarian cancer using chimeric receptors.

 Preclinical testing of CARs has been done in immunodeficient
xenograft-bearing mice, which do not share the targets of chimeric
receptors and therefore cannot predict potential, clinically rele-
vant adverse effects. To understand the interaction between CAR T
cells, the host immune system, and the endogenous target poten-
tially expressed in healthy tissues, we generated chimeric endo-
crine receptors (CER) against human FSHR to exploit receptor–
ligand interactions through the expression of full-length human
FSH. We also engineered T cells expressing the murine counter-
parts of all FSH signaling domains for use in immunocompetent
tumor-bearing mice (13). Our results demonstrate that targeting
FSHR with T cells expressing hormone-derived chimeric receptors
is safe, specific, effective, and capable of boosting pre-existing,
endogenous antitumor immunity.
Materials and Methods
Animals and cell lines
Wild-type C57BL/6 and Ly5.1 mice were purchased from
National Cancer Institute or from Charles River. NOD/SCID
IL2Rgammanull (NSG) mice, originally from Jackson labs, were
maintainedby TheWistarInstituteanimalfacility.Animal experi-
ments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at The Wistar Institute (Philadelphia, PA).
Parental ID8 cells were provided by Katherine Roby (Depart-
ment of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Kansas Medical
Center, Kansas City, KS) and retrovirally transduced to express
Defb29 and Vegf-a (27) and murine FSHR. We generated ID8-
Defb29/Vegf-a flank or intraperitoneal tumors as
described
previously (9). A7C11 is a murine cell line generated from
orthotopic p53/KRas-driven mouse breast tumors (28, 29), which
was retrovirally transduced to express murine FSHR. Patient-
derived xenografts (PDX) FCCC-OV-16, WISTAR-1, and WIS-
TAR-2 were implanted subcutaneously into NSG mice followed
by intratumoral T-cell administration; WISTAR-3 was implanted
as a tissue fragment under the ovarian bursa in NSG mice and was
treated with intraperitoneal administration of T cells.
We measured flank tumors with calipers and calculated tumor
volumes as 1/2 � (L � W � W), where L is the longer of 2
dimensions.
OVCAR-3, CaOV3, RNG1, OVTOKO, and TOV-21G were pro-
vided by Dr. Rugang Zhang (The Wistar Institute).
Design of CARs and soluble FSHR
We designed the CAR constructs using the signal peptide of
murine CD8a, followed by a fusion of the full-length murine
FSHb and CGa peptides linked by a glycine/serine spacer, fol-
lowed by murine CD8a hinge and transmembrane domain and
an intracellular fragment of murine 4-1BB and CD3z. We ordered
the construct from Genescript flanked by EcoRI and NotI and
cloned into pBMN-I-GFP retroviral vector. The corresponding
human sequences were ordered to generate the human FSHR-
targeted chimeric receptor.
To generate the N-terminal extracellular domain of FSHR, we
cloned the sequence encoding FSHR from residues 1 to 268 into
pBMN-I-GFP retroviral vector and infected 293T cells.
Human samples
Human ovarian carcinoma tissues were procured under a
protocol approved by the Committee for the Protection of
Human
Subjects
at
Dartmouth-Hitchcock
Medical
Center
(#17702) and under a protocol approved by the Institutional
Review Board at Christiana Care Health System (#32214) and the
Institutional Review Board of The Wistar Institute (#21212263). A
panel of cDNA samples from healthy human tissues was pur-
chased from Clontech.
PDX model FCCC-OC-16 was established by direct implanta-
tion of human ovarian tumor tissue in immunocompromised
mice under Institutional Review Board and Institutional Care and
Use Committee approved protocols at Fox Chase Cancer Center
(Philadelphia, PA).
Analysis of TCGA data
Aligned Sequence files related to solid ovarian cancer samples
were downloaded from TCGA data portal (2015). Downloaded
files include whole-exon sequencing and outcome data. Scores
(number of tags in each transcript) were obtained from each
sample, normalized with respect to total tags in the sample as well
as total tags in the chromosome, and expressed as FPKM (frag-
ments/kb of transcript per million mapped reads).
Retrovirus production and transduction of T cells
We generated retrovirus by transfecting Eco-Phoenix cells with
pBMN-I-GFP or pBMN-I-GFP-FSHCER. Briefly, we plated the
Phoenix cells in a 10-cm culture dish. When the cells reached
80% to 90% confluence, we transfected them with a mix of DNA,
CaCl2, and 2� HBSS. We collected the supernatant containing the
retroviral particles 48 and 72 hours after transfection and stored
them at �80�C.
For mouse T-cell transduction, after red blood cell lysis, we
resuspended splenocytes at 2 � 106 cells/mL in a 24-well plate
with 50 U/mL of IL2 (PeproTech), 1 mg/mL of IL7 (PeproTech),
and 50 mL/mL of anti-mouse CD3/CD28 beads (Invitrogen). We
performed 2 spin infections at 18 and 36 hours on Retronectin-
coated plates (Takara) and magnetically removed the CD3/CD28
beads at day 4 after isolation. We counted the T-cell number every
2 days and added RPMI þ IL2 þ IL7 to maintain a concentration of
106 cells/mL. At day 7, T cells were sorted for GFP and used for
adoptive cell transfer.
Translational Relevance
The outcome of patients with ovarian cancer has improved
very little over the last 40 years. As an immunogenic disease,
immunotherapies targeting epithelial ovarian cancer offer
great hope to reverse this dismaying prognosis. We show that
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) receptor is expressed on
the cell surface of ovarian carcinomas of different histologic
types, including clear cell and mucinous tumors, which are
particularly aggressive. Most importantly, no FSHR expression
is found in nonovarian healthy tissues in adult women.
Accordingly, T cells expressing full-length FSHR-redirected
chimeric receptors mediate significant therapeutic effects
(including tumor rejection) against established patient-
derived and transplantable tumors in vivo, without any mea-
surable toxicity in immunocompetent mice treated with T cells
targeting murine FSHR. Therefore, T cells redirected against
FSHRþ tumor cells with full-length FSH represent a promising
therapeutic alternative against a broad range of ovarian malig-
nancies, with negligible toxicity even in the presence of cog-
nate targets in tumor-free ovaries.

 Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained by leu-
kapheresis/elutriation and identically transduced with human
reagents.
Cytotoxicity assay
We plated 10,000 target tumor cells in flat-bottom 96-well plate.
Before adding T cells, we washed away the tumor conditioned
media and added fresh media with no b-mercaptoethanol and the
appropriate number of T cells per well (in 200 mL). T cells were
FSHCER or mock-transduced. Following 18 hours, we collected T
cells and tumor cells by trypsinization and proceeded to flow
cytometric analysis of cellular cytotoxicity (30). We stained cells
with Annexin V and Zombie Yellow or 7-AAD (Biolegend) and
gated out the T cells by forward scattering (FSC) and side scattering
(SSC) using a no T-cell control (Supplementary Fig. S1A). To
confirm the validity of the flow cytometric assay in our hands, we
transduced OVCAR-3 tumor cells with a luciferase expressing
vector and checked for cytotoxicity using the Luciferase Assay
(Promega; Supplementary Fig. S1B). Cytotoxicity was calculated
as (maximum viability control � individual well)/(maximum
viability control� maximum death control) � 100 asa percentage.
IFNg determination
We plated 10,000 ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a/Fshr in flat-bottom
96-well plate and cocultured overnight with FSHCER or mock
transduced T cells. We measured IFNg using ELISA (Biolegend)
following manufacturer instructions.
For IFNg ELISPOT (eBioscience), we primed 2 million bone
marrow–derived dendritic cells (BMDC) with 200,000 irradiated
(100 Gy þ 30 minute UV) ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a/Fshr cells overnight.
The next day, we plated 10,000 T cells with 1,000 BMDCs and
measured the number of spots 72 hours later on an ELISPOT
reader using Immunospot software (CTL).
Flow cytometry
We used a BD LSRII flow cytometer or BD FACSAria cell sorter
(BD Biosciences).
Anti-mouse antibodies used were directly fluorochrome-conju-
gated. We used
anti-CD3e
(17A2),
CD4
(RM4-5), CD8b
(YTS156.7.7), CD45 (30-F11), CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 (104),

CD62L
(MEL-14),
PD-1
(29F.1A12; all from Biolegend or Tonbo Biosciences). Live/dead
exclusion was done with Zombie Yellow or 7-AAD (Biolegend).
Exosome isolation
Exosomes were isolated from ascites using the Total Exosome
Isolation
Reagent
(Invitrogen)
following
manufacturer's
instructions.
Immunoblotting
Frozen human ovarian tumor specimens were mechanically
disassociated. Protein extraction, denaturation, and Western blot-
ting were performed as previously described (29). Membranes
were blotted with anti-FSHR (FSHR-18, ATCC; ref. 31) and anti-
b-actin (A5441, Sigma-Aldrich). Images were captured with Ima-
geQuantLAS 4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Immunohistochemistry
Tumor microarrays from paraffin-embedded ovarian cancers
and paraffin-embedded mouse tumors were subjected to antigen
retrieval and deparaffinized. Slides were then fixed with acetone
and washed with PBS and sections blocked using normal goat
serum followed by staining with FSHR18 antibody (31), followed
by a biotinylated goat anti-mouse and completion of immuno-
histochemical procedure according to manufacturer instructions
(Vector Labs). As positive control, we used CaOV3 tumors (Sup-
plementary Fig. S2A). We stained for osteoclasts using Leukocyte
Acid Phosphatase TRAP Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Femurs and tibias
were placed in 10% formalin for 24 hours, and bone decalcifi-
cation was performed using 14% EDTA in PBS at 4�C for 7 days.
We removed EDTA by rinsing bones in tap water for 30 minutes
and placed bones in 70% ethanol until paraffin embedding and
sectioning.
Slides were viewed using Nikon ECLIPSE 80i microscope and
the NIS-Element Imaging software.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Tissue RNA was isolated from snap-frozen samples by mechan-
ical disruption and extracted using RNeasy kits (QIAGEN) accord-
ing to manufacturer's instruction. RNA was reverse-transcribed
using High Capacity Reverse Transcription kits (Applied-Biosys-
tems). Quantification of human FSHR was performed on the
7500 Fast Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystem) using
TaqMan assay reagents and primers (forward: 50- ATGGAAGC-
CAGCCTCACCTAT-30 and reverse: 50- TCTGACCCCTAGCCT-
GAGTCATA-30) and TaqMan probe (50-FAM/ACGGCAAAT/
ZEN/CTCTGAGCTTCATCCA-IBFQ-30). Expression was normal-
ized by GAPDH levels (assay ID: Hs99999905). Quantification of
mouse FSHR was performed using SYBR green reagents and
primers (forward: 50-TTTTCTGGATTTGGGGACCT-30 and reverse:
50-ATGCAAGTTGGGTAGGTTGG -30). mRNA expression was
normalized by GAPDH levels (primers forward: 50-CCTGCAC-
CACCAACTGCTTA-30 and reverse: 50-AGTGATGGCATGGACT-
GTGGT-30). The average of 3 independent analyses for gene and
sample was calculated using the DD threshold cycle (Ct) method
and was normalized to the endogenous reference control gene
GAPDH.
Biochemical determinations
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase
(ALT), glucose, and creatinine were determined by the Mouse
Phenotyping, Physiology and Metabolism Core (University of
Pennsylvania) using Catalyst Dx Chemistry Analyzer (Idexx
Laboratories).
IL6 was measured in plasma using an IL-6 ELISA kit (Biolegend)
following manufacturer's instructions.
Statistical analysis
Unless noted otherwise, all experiments were repeated at least
twice and with similar results. Differences between the means of
experimental groups were calculated using a 2-tailed unpaired
Student t test or2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction where 2
categorical variables were measured. Error bars represent SEM.
Survival rates were compared using the log-rank test. All statistical
analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 5.0. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

 first analyzed TCGA datasets from 404 high-grade serous ovarian
carcinomas, which represent about 70% of all EOC (32). We
found that 56.4% of these tumors express FSHR mRNA (Fig. 1A).
In addition, 4.7% of 1,095 breast carcinomas in TCGA datasets
also expressed FSHR (Fig. 1B), suggesting that FSHR targeting
could also be effective in other malignancies. Widespread expres-
sion of FSHR was confirmed in Western blot and immunohisto-
chemical analysis of 28 stage III/IV serous ovarian carcinomas
from our tumor bank, with 50% of the tumors analyzed expres-
sing FSHR (Fig. 1C), consistent with previous studies (18–25).
Characterization of the expression of FSHR in other histologic
subtypes identified positive protein signal in 70% of endome-
trioid carcinomas (�10% of EOC; 23 tumors analyzed), 67% of
mucinous ovarian carcinomas (�3% of EOC; 9 tumors analyzed),

 and 33% of clear cell ovarian carcinomas (�10% of EOC; 12
tumors analyzed) but not in ovarian carcinosarcomas (Fig. 1D–F;
4 tumors analyzed). In addition, we found FSHR expression in 3
of 3 clear cell ovarian cell lines (RNG1, TOV-21G, and
OVTOKO; Fig. 1G) but expression was not detected in a granulosa
cell tumor specimen (Fig. 1E). A good correlation was observed
between protein and mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Therefore, besides expression in most serous carcinomas, FSHR
expression could open new treatment opportunities for poor
prognosis subtypes, such as mucinous and clear cell, for which
there are currently few effective therapies (33).
FSHR can be effectively targeted to treat patient-derived ovarian
cancer through the use of chimeric receptors
To target the FSHR by redirecting T cells, we generated a human
chimeric receptor using the full-length of the 2 subunits of the
human FSH hormone, linked by a glycine/serine spacer, in frame
with a transmembrane domain, the intracellular domain of co-
stimulatory 4-1BB, and CD3z (FSHCER; Fig. 2A). As expected,
FSHCER expressing T cells killed cultured OVCAR-3 target cells, a
well-defined positive control (22, 34), in dose-dependent man-
ner, compared with mock-transduced T cells and without killing
FSHR� K562 cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, FSHCER T cells abrogated
the growth of xenografted FSHRþ CaOV3 ovarian cells in immu-
nodeficient mice, whereas mock-transduced T cells allowed accel-
erated tumor progression (Fig. 2C).
To understand the immunotherapeutic potential of target-
ing FSHR in heterogeneous ovarian malignancies expressing
variable target levels, we next treated pairs of NSG mice
growing identically established FSHRþ ovarian PDX tumors
with FSHCER T cells (case mouse) or mock-transduced T cells
(control paired mouse with the same xenograft). Remarkably,
FSHRCER T cells induced rejection of the human ovarian PDX
model expressing the highest levels of FSHR (PDXFCCC-OC-
16) and delayed the growth of a second model (Wistar-1) with
FSHR levels lower than most primary ovarian malignancies
(Fig. 2D and E and Supplementary Fig. S2C). In both cases,
administration of mock-transduced T cells into paired mice
growing the same PDX tumor allowed for steady tumor
growth (Fig. 2D and E). Antitumor effects, however, appear
to depend on FSHR expression levels, as no changes were
observed against a third PDX model with lower FSHR expres-
sion (Wistar-2; Fig. 2D and E).
To confirm that allogeneic recognition of tumors by heterol-
ogous T cells is not required for FSHCER activity and to confirm
effectiveness at the orthotopic location, we treated another pair of
mice growing a different FSHRþ PDX (Wistar-3) in the ovarian
bursa with (autologous) T cells from the peripheral blood of the
same patient. As shown in Fig. 2F, a solid tumor mass grew in the
mouse treated with mock-transduced T cells, whereas the tumor
growing in the mouse receiving FSHRCER T cells exhibited mas-
sive central necrosis and only retained tumor tissue at the margins.
Taken together, these results support that chimeric receptors using
entire subunits of the FSH can effectively redirect the cytotoxic
activity of T cells against a variety of patient-derived FSHRþ
ovarian carcinomas.
Chimeric receptor–expressing T cells are safe and
effective against different established tumors in
immunocompetent mice
An important concern regarding the use of chimeric receptor–
targeted immunotherapies is the occurrence of off-tumor effects.
Further supporting the therapeutic potential of FSHRCER T cells,
we confirmed that only tumor-free ovaries and not any other
healthy human tissues tested, expressed FSHR at the mRNA level
(Fig. 3A). Of note, this includes liver tissue, where a recent report
has suggested possible expression of FSHR in tissue surrounding a
hepatocellular carcinoma (35).
To rule out potential in vivo toxicity due to unknown FSHR
expression in any healthy tissue, we then generated a mouse
FSHCER construct with the murine counterparts of all domains
expressed in human T cells. As expected, ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a
tumor cells, an aggressive ovarian cancer model engineered to
accelerate peritoneal carcinomatosis and ascites in vivo (4, 8, 10,
36), elicited robust secretion of IFNg by FSHCER mouse T cells
upon ectopic expression of FSHR, to a much greater extent than
in the absence of ectopic FSHR expression (Fig. 3B). FSHCER-
specific T-cell responses were consistent when CD4 and CD8
T cells were independently stimulated (Fig. 3C) and, as with
their human counterparts, mouse FSHCER T cells specifically
killed FSHR-expressing tumor cells in a dose-dependent man-
ner (Fig. 3D). Accordingly, only 2 intraperitoneal injections
of 1 � 106 to 1.5 � 106 FSHCER T cells were sufficient to
significantly prolong survival in this aggressive orthotopic
model (4, 8, 10, 27, 36–38), compared with mock-transduced
T cells, in multiple independent experiments (e.g., Fig. 3E). This
supports the NCI recommendation for an intraperitoneal treat-
ment of this disease because under the same conditions, intra-
venous administration of FSHCER T cells was unable to delay
ovarian tumor progression (Fig. 3F). As expected, treatment of
untransduced parental ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a tumors resulted in no
survival benefit (Fig. 3G).

 Equally important, no obvious adverse effects were observed in
these experiments. To identify potential deleterious consequences
of targeting the expression of FSHR in any unknown healthy
tissues which could lead to on-target, off-tumor unacceptable side
effects, we analyzed weight, obvious phenotypic changes, and
general organ biochemistry to screen for potential organic fail-
ures. There was no evidence of weight loss or any signs of distress
throughout the treatment (not shown). Levels of (AST/ALT) liver
enzymes, creatinine, or glucose in the serum of FSHCER T-cell–
treated mice remained unchanged, compared with control mice
injected with PBS (Fig. 3H). We found, however, a significant
increase in serum IL6 in FSHCER T-cell–treated mice, which also
occurred in mice receiving mock-transduced T cells (Fig. 3H). This
recapitulates cytokine patterns previously observed in CAR T-cell–
treated patients (39). Because FSHR signaling has been also
suggested in osteoclasts, we also ruled out any obvious alterations
in bone density or the frequency of osteoclasts in FSHCER-treated
versus untreated mice (not shown).
Because we also identified mRNA expression of FSHR in 4.7%
of TCGA breast carcinomas, and because FSHR could be expressed
in certain metastatic lesions (40), we treated mice with FSHR-
transduced breast tumors generated with orthotopic p53/KRas-
driven malignant cells (28, 38). As shown in Fig. 3I, systemic
administration of FSHRCER T cells significantly delayed the
progression of established tumors, compared with the adminis-
tration of mock-transduced lymphocytes. Again, no obvious
toxicity was detected at any level.
Overall, these results demonstrate that T cells redirected against
murine ovarian or breast cancer cells overexpressing FSHR with
hormone-targeted chimeric receptors induce significant therapeu-
tic benefits in immunocompetent mice with different established,
aggressive tumors, without detectable toxicity or alternative tar-
geting of any healthy tissue.
Chimeric receptor–expressing T cells boost pre-existing,
endogenous T-cell–dependent antitumor immunity
To understand the relative contribution of different T-cell
subsets to the reproducible antitumor activity of FSHCER lym-
phocytes, we next treated different cohorts of ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a
tumor–bearing mice with either FSHCER-transduced CD4 or CD8
T cells, alone or in combination. Interestingly, CD4 T cells
expressing chimeric receptors were as effective as a mix of unseg-
regated lymphocytes, whereas CD8 T cells alone were less effec-
tive, although better than mock-transduced T cells (Fig. 4A).
We then took advantage of our immunocompetent mouse
model to dissect the interaction of adoptively transferred CER
T cells with an intact immune system, which is incompletely
understood and impossible to dissect in immunodeficient
mice. We hypothesized that the specific cytotoxic activity of
FSHCER T cells should result in antigen spreading and decreased

 immunosuppressive burden, which could have a significant effect
on pre-existing antitumor immunity. To test this proposition, we
treated different cohorts of CD45.2þ mice bearing orthotopic
FSHRþ ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a syngeneic tumors with congenic
CD45.1þ FSHCER T cells, mock-transduced T cells, or vehicle
(PBS). Pre-existing T cells of host origin (CD45.2þ, to differentiate
them from transferred FSHCER T cells) were sorted from the
peritoneal cavity 1 to 2 weeks after treatment and subjected to
IFNg ELISPOT analysis (Fig. 4B). The frequency of endogenous
IFNg-producing T cells responding to dendritic cells pulsed with
double (UV þ g)-irradiated ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a/Fshr tumor cells
was dramatically higher in mice treated with FSHCER T cells
compared with endogenous T cells from both the mock-trans-
duced and vehicle-treated groups (Fig. 4C). Most importantly,
endogenous T-cell responses were also capable of reducing malig-
nant progression because adoptive transfer of host-derived
(CD45.2þ) splenic T cells from mice treated with FSHCER T cells
(CD45.1þ) into na€
�ve, syngeneic mice resulted in significantly
smaller tumors upon rechallenge with the sameID8-Defb29/Vegf-a
cells, compared with the effect of T cells from control tumor-
bearing mice (Fig. 4D and E).
Together, our results indicate that CD4 T cells are major
contributors to consistent therapeutic benefits and that the
overall cytotoxic activity of T cells redirected against tumor
cells with chimeric receptors boosts the activity of endogenous
T cells. This response should be able to delay malignant
progression regardless of whether tumors lose targeted antigens
through immunoediting.
Chimeric receptor–expressing T cells persist in the absence of
immunoediting but are diverted from tumor beds by tumor
ascites
Our results indicate that hormone-targeted T cells are both safe
and effective against established aggressive malignancies. To
understand tumor-induced mechanisms that could limit the
effectiveness of chimeric receptor–expressing T cells in vivo, we
next tested whether tumor cells could lose the targeted surface
molecules through immunoediting. Notably, fresh FSHCER T
cells reacted equally strongly by secreting IFNg in response to
FSHR-transduced tumor cells sorted from the peritoneal cavity of
mice previously treated with FSHCER- or mock-transduced T cells
or PBS (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating persistence
of targeted FSHR.
Another possibility is that chimeric receptor–targeted T cells do
not persist in cancer-bearing hosts. We therefore again took
advantage of the congenic marker CD45.1 expressed in FSHRCER
T cells and sacrificed FSHR-expressing ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a tumor–
bearing mice at days 5, 10, and 15 after intraperitoneal admin-
istration of FSHCER T cells. Five days after T-cell administration,
we saw a peak of FSHCER T cells in the peritoneal cavity, with
similar proportions of CD8 versus CD4 lymphocytes (Fig. 5B
and C). Both subsets were activated (CD44þCD69þ) in tumor
(peritoneal)
beds
at
this
early
stage
(45.5%
and
3.1%,
respectively; Fig. 5D). However, proportions and absolute num-
bers (not shown) of transferred T cells decreased on days 10 and
15, accompanied by a higher percentage of CD4 T cells relative to
CD8, and retention of activation markers (Fig. 5B–D). In both
spleen and tumor-draining lymph nodes, we observed a peak of
accumulation at day 10, with trafficking as early as day 5. These
T cells are mostly CD4þ (90.5%) with a central memory pheno-
type (CD44þCD62Lþ; Fig. 5E) and represented 0.8% of total
T cells. At terminal stages of malignant progression, FSHCER T
cells were still clearly and reproducibly detectable in the spleen
(0.6% of total T cells; Fig. 5F). T-cell detection in solid tumors was
unreliable for technical reasons and could not be assessed. Sur-
prisingly, no FSHCER T cells could be detected at this stage in
tumor ascites. This cannot be attributed to classical T-cell exhaus-
tion, because only a minority of T cells (8% in CD8 and 31% in
CD4) expressed PD-1 on the cell surface (Fig. 6A).
The ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a tumor system quickly generates massive
ascites. To determine whether immunosuppressive factors in
tumor ascites could induce T-cell death, we then coincubated
FSHR-expressing ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a tumor cells and targeted
FSHCER T cells in the presence of increasing amounts of
tumor-derived ascitic fluid. Unexpectedly, filtered (cell-free)
tumor ascites increased the reactivity (IFN-g secretion) of FSHCER
T cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). This was the result of
recognition of FHSR of tumor cell origin in ascites because
identically treated mock-transduced T cells did not react against
FSHRþ tumor cells in the presence of ascites. Similar activation of
CER T cells was observed in Transwell experiments where tumor
cells were physically separated from FSHCER T cells (Fig. 6C) and
was recapitulated by incubation with fresh ascites from ID8-
Defb29/Vegf-a/Fshr–bearing mice (Fig. 6D), but not plasma from
a tumor-free mouse (Fig. 6E). However, incubation with super-
natants from cells transduced with a soluble form containing the
N-terminal extracellular domain of FSHR was not sufficient to
elicit FSHCER T-cell activation (Fig. 6E). We therefore hypothe-
sized that a membrane-bound form of FSHR contained in exo-
somes from the tumor cells could be responsible for activating
FSHCER T cells. Supporting this proposition, exosomes isolated
from the ascites of ID8-Defb29/Vegf-a/Fshr–bearing mice specifi-
cally activated FSHCER T cells (but not mock-transduced T cells)
upon coincubation (Fig. 6E).
Finally, to define whether soluble or exosome-contained forms
of additional targets could impair the effectiveness of other CAR T-
cell formulations, we transduced T cells with a CAR bearing the
anti-mesothelin SS scFv (GenBank: AF035617.1) being used in
clinical trials (41). As shown in Fig. 6F, incubation with human
ascites from a patient with ovarian cancer was sufficient to elicit a
dramatic IFNg response in anti-mesothelin CAR T cells, but not in
FSHR-redirected CER T cells in this particular case. Because all
signaling motifs were identical in both formulations, these data
strongly suggest that tumor ascites elicits specific activation of
CAR T cells in an antigen-specific manner. Taken together, these
results indicate that chimeric receptor–targeted T cells persist as
memory cells in treated ovarian cancer–bearing hosts, but in the
presence of advanced tumor ascites, they eventually disappear
from tumor beds. Release of continuously expressed molecular
target into ascites in exosomes activates T cells distally from tumor
cells, thus impairing therapeutic effectiveness, despite apparent
lack of exhaustion and persistence in lymphoid organs.
Discussion
Here we showed that T cells redirected with FSHR-targeted
chimeric receptors attack ovarian cancer cells and mediate signif-
icant therapeutic effects, including tumor rejection against differ-
ent established patient-derived tumors.
Our study identifies FSHR as an immunotherapeutic target
expressed not only by serous ovarian carcinomas but also by
other particularly aggressive and chemoresistant histologic types,

 such as clear cell and mucinous tumors. Most importantly, we did
not detect expression of FSHR in any healthy tissue with the
exception of ovaries. Accordingly, mouse T cells redirected with
murine FSH to target syngeneic tumors did not induce any
detectable alteration in liver, kidney, or endocrine pancreatic
function. Other authors have recently shown that FSH hormone
fragments can delay the in vivo growth of established cell lines
(42). Although FSHb alone was not effective in our hands, the use
of the 2 subunits of FSH rendered T cells effective against different
patient-derived tumors expressing variable levels of FSHR. There-
fore, FSHR and perhaps other hormone receptors with a very
restricted expression pattern in other tumors represent promising
targets to translate the success of CAR T cells from hematologic to
solid tumors without fatal off-target effects. Furthermore, the
natural affinity of FSH for its endogenous receptor not only
ensures maximum specificity but also should prevent immuno-
logic rejection of the chimeric receptor, which is a concern for
constructs using exogenous antibody fragments.
Our work also demonstrates for the first time that host-derived
T cells influenced by chimeric receptor–transduced lymphocytes
could contribute to overall effectiveness. Accordingly, recent
studies showed that short-lived mesothelin-targeting CAR T cells
can induce epitope-spreading and raise Ab titers in patients (41).
Our work in immunocompetent preclinical models expands these
mechanisms by demonstrating that FSHRCER T cells increase
endogenous T-cell activity, which is sufficient to delay tumor

 progression. These effects may be particularly important in
tumors undergoing loss of targeted antigens through immunoe-
diting or deletion of CAR T cells because polyclonal responses
could provide immune pressure against malignant progression
even after transferred lymphocytes become ineffective. Of note,
we also observed a measurable boost in pre-existing antitumor
immunity upon transferring mock-transduced T cells versus the
PBS-treated group. This is in line with our previously reported
immunogenic boost upon adoptive transfer of unstimulated
T cells (7) and likely reflects a change in the cytokine milieu in
response to adoptive T-cell transfer. However, we did not observe
any loss of antigenicity in our systems at end-stage disease,
although FSHR-targeted chimeric receptor–expressing T cells
remained in the host until tumor-bearing mice succumbed to

 terminal disease. However, release of targeted molecules from the
surface of tumor cells in ascites could divert the effector activity of
chimeric receptor–expressing T cells away from tumor cells.
Patients with reduced ascites burden or administration of
FSHRCER T cells between initial treatment and recurrence would
therefore be preferable to maximize effectiveness.
Overall, our study demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of
targeting chimeric receptors for T-cell activation using full-length
hormones and unveils mechanisms of therapeutic activity that
contribute to understanding the effects of adoptively transferred T
cells in ongoing and future clinical trials.
