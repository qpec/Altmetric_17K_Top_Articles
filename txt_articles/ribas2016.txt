IMPORTANCE The programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway limits immune responses to melanoma
and can be blocked with the humanized anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab.
OBJECTIVE To characterize the association of pembrolizumab with tumor response and
overall survival among patients with advanced melanoma.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS Open-label, multicohort, phase 1b clinical trials
(enrollment, December 2011-September 2013). Median duration of follow-up was 21 months.
The study was performed in academic medical centers in Australia, Canada, France, and the
United States. Eligible patients were aged 18 years and older and had advanced or metastatic
melanoma. Data were pooled from 655 enrolled patients (135 from a nonrandomized cohort
[n = 87 ipilimumab naive; n = 48 ipilimumab treated] and 520 from randomized cohorts
[n = 226 ipilimumab naive; n = 294 ipilimumab treated]). Cutoff dates were April 18, 2014, for
safety analyses and October 18, 2014, for efficacy analyses.
EXPOSURES Pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 2 mg/kg ev-
ery 3 weeks continued until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or investigator decision.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was confirmed objective response
rate (best overall response of complete response or partial response) in patients with
measurable disease at baseline per independent central review. Secondary end points
included toxicity, duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.
RESULTS Among the 655 patients (median [range] age, 61 [18-94] years; 405 [62%] men),
581 had measurable disease at baseline. An objective response was reported in 194 of 581
patients (33% [95% CI, 30%-37%]) and in 60 of 133 treatment-naive patients (45% [95% CI,
36% to 54%]). Overall, 74% (152/205) of responses were ongoing at the time of data cutoff;
44% (90/205) of patients had response duration for at least 1 year and 79% (162/205) had
response duration for at least 6 months. Twelve-month progression-free survival rates were
35% (95% CI, 31%-39%) in the total population and 52% (95% CI, 43%-60%) among
treatment-naive patients. Median overall survival in the total population was 23 months (95%
CI, 20-29) with a 12-month survival rate of 66% (95% CI, 62%-69%) and a 24-month survival
rate of 49% (95% CI, 44%-53%). In treatment-naive patients, median overall survival was 31
months (95% CI, 24 to not reached) with a 12-month survival rate of 73% (95% CI, 65%-79%)
and a 24-month survival rate of 60% (95% CI, 51%-68%). Ninety-two of 655 patients (14%)
experienced at least 1 treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse event (AE) and 27 of 655 (4%)
patients discontinued treatment because of a treatment-related AE. Treatment-related
serious AEs were reported in 59 patients (9%). There were no drug-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with advanced melanoma, pembrolizumab
administration was associated with an overall objective response rate of 33%, 12-month
progression-free survival rate of 35%, and median overall survival of 23 months; grade 3 or 4
treatment-related AEs occurred in 14%.

mmune checkpoint inhibitors have provided a new treat-
ment approach in cancer immunotherapy.1,2 One such in-
hibitorisprogrammedcelldeathprotein1(PD-1),whichlim-
its T-cell effector functions against chronic inflammation and
cancer by binding to its primary ligand, PD-L1.1,3-5 Pembroli-
zumab (MK-3475) is a highly selective, humanized monoclo-
nal IgG4-κ isotype antibody against PD-1 that is approved
around the world for the treatment of patients with unresect-
able or metastatic melanoma with disease progression follow-
ing ipilimumab and, if BRAFV600 (NCBI accession number
NM_004324.2) mutated, a BRAF inhibitor. Following a phase
1 dose-finding study to determine the recommended phase 2
dose, 1235 patients with advanced solid tumors, melanoma,
or non–small cell lung cancer were enrolled into expansion co-
horts. With a median follow-up of 11 months among respond-
ers, pembrolizumab provided an objective response rate
of 25% to 52% in the initial melanoma expansion cohorts of
KEYNOTE-001, irrespective of dosing schedule or prior ipili-
mumab status.6 In a randomized cohort of patients with
ipilimumab-refractory melanoma, the objective response rate
was 26% for both pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every
3 weeks.7 In patients with ipilimumab-refractory melanoma
enrolled in the phase 2 KEYNOTE-002 trial, pembrolizumab
(2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) every 3 weeks was better tolerated and
demonstrated superior progression-free survival compared
with chemotherapy, with no clinically meaningful differ-
ences noted between pembrolizumab doses.8 In the random-
ized phase 3 KEYNOTE-006 study, pembrolizumab had fewer
toxicities and significantly improved overall survival com-
pared with ipilimumab.9
The current report analyzed pooled data from all 655 pa-
tients with advanced melanoma enrolled in KEYNOTE-001 to
characterize the association of pembrolizumab administra-
tion with antitumor activity and safety and to allow for the as-
sessment of long-term outcomes with therapy.
Methods
Study Design and Conduct
KEYNOTE-001wasaninternational(Australia,Canada,France,
United States), open-label phase 1 study in which pembroli-
zumab safety and antitumor activity were assessed in multiple
cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumors, melanoma, or
non–small cell lung cancer. Of the 655 patients with mela-
noma enrolled in this study, 173 were included in the random-
ized cohort previously reported by Robert et al,7 135 were in-
cluded in the nonrandomized cohort previously reported by
Hamid et al,6 and 347 were not included in prior reports. Be-
tween December 2011 and September 2012, 135 patients with
advancedmelanomawhowerenaivetoipilimumaborwhohad
previously received ipilimumab were enrolled in 5 sequential,
nonoverlapping treatment groups in a nonrandomized cohort
and treated with pembrolizumab, 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or
10 mg/kg every 2 or every 3 weeks.6 Between August 2012 and
September 2013, 520 patients were enrolled in 3 randomized
cohorts: an ipilimumab-naive cohort treated with pembroli-
zumab, 2 or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks10; an ipilimumab-treated
cohort treated with pembrolizumab, 2 or 10 mg/kg every 3
weeks7,10;andacohortthatincludedbothipilimumab-naive10-13
and ipilimumab-treated patients treated with pembroli-
zumab, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks.11
The final randomization ratio for all randomized cohorts was
1:1. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously over 30
minutes and the regimen continued until disease progression
or withdrawal was determined by an investigator for intoler-
able toxicity or protocol violation. The nonrandomized co-
horts were dose-confirmation expansion cohorts, in which pa-
tients were enrolled at different dose levels in a sequential
fashion. For the randomized cohorts, a randomization sched-
ule was generated for the dose assignment.
The study was conducted in accordance with the proto-
col, Good Clinical Practice standards, and the Declaration of
Helsinki. The protocol and its amendments were approved by
the relevant institutional review boards or ethics committees
of the participating institutions. All patients provided writ-
ten informed consent.
Patient Eligibility
Common patient eligibility among all cohorts was age 18 years
and older; advanced unresectable melanoma with measur-
able disease per investigator assessment; Eastern Coopera-
tive Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; and
adequate organ function. Patient-reported race/ethnicity in-
formation was collected by the investigator to ensure lack of
differences in safety and activity. Common exclusion criteria
included chemotherapy within 4 weeks of the first study dose,
active infection, active autoimmune disease or history thereof,
ongoing systemic corticosteroid therapy at treatment doses,
and previous treatment targeting the PD-1 pathway. There was
no protocol-mandated baseline magnetic resonance imaging
of the brain, but patients with previously treated central ner-
vous system metastases that were clinically stable for at least
8 weeks were eligible.
For all patients naive to ipilimumab, 1 or 2 previous thera-
pieswerepermitted.Forallpatientspreviouslytreatedwithipi-
limumab, the number of previous therapies was unlimited. For
patients previously exposed to ipilimumab and enrolled in the
nonrandomized cohort or one of the randomized cohorts, con-
firmed progression following ipilimumab and resolution of all
ipilimumab-related adverse events with no treatment for these
adverse events at least 4 weeks prior to start of pembroli-
zumab were required. Patients previously treated with ipili-
mumab and enrolled in the randomized cohort previously re-
ported by Robert et al7 were required to have received at least
2 ipilimumab infusions (minimum dose of 3 mg/kg), have not
receivedipilimumabforatleast4weeks,havedocumenteddis-
ease progression according to immune-related response crite-
ria within 24 weeks of the last ipilimumab dose, and have reso-
lution of all ipilimumab-related adverse events to National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (NCI-CTCAE) grade 0 to 1 with prednisone of as much
as 10 mg/day or equivalent for at least 2 weeks before the first
pembrolizumab dose. Previous BRAF inhibitor therapy, MEK
inhibitor therapy, or both were required for patients with
ipilimumab-refractory, BRAFV600–mutant melanoma.

Assessments
Tumor response was assessed every 12 weeks by indepen-
dent central review (primary for calculating objective re-
sponse rate and progression-free survival) using Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1;
the conventional criteria for assessing change in tumor
burden)12 and by investigator review (for treatment manage-
ment) using immune-related response criteria.13 Objective re-
sponse rate, which was the primary end point, was assess-
able only in patients with measurable disease at baseline
(assessed by independent central review using RECIST v1.1).
For assessment of response rate, patients without postbase-
line disease assessments were counted as nonresponders. A
prespecified subgroup analysis of objective response rate was
conducted. Secondary end points included objective re-
sponse rate as assessed by immune-related response criteria
by investigators, duration of response, progression-free
survival, and overall survival. Best target lesion response was
assessed in patients with measurable disease at baseline per
central review.
Assessed variables and definitions included the follow-
ing: (1) objective response rate, the percentage of patients with
a best overall response of complete response or partial re-
sponse; (2) measurable disease, having at least 1 measurable
lesion (a lesion that can be measured in at least 1 dimension);
(3) complete response, disappearance of all target lesions
(all measurable lesions ≤2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in
total) in response to treatment; (4) partial response, a de-
crease (≥30%) in sum of diameters of target lesions from base-
line in response to treatment; (5) stable disease, neither a re-
sponse nor progressive disease; (6) progressive disease,
a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target le-
sions from nadir; (7) disease control rate, rate of complete
response + partial response + stable disease; (8) duration of re-
sponse, time from best overall response to first documenta-
tion of disease progression; (9) progression-free survival, time
from start of treatment to documented disease progression or
death due to any cause; and (10) overall survival, time from
start of treatment to death due to any cause. Durable re-
sponses were defined as responses lasting for at least 1 year.
Adverse events were recorded continuously throughout
treatment up to 30 days after treatment (90 days for serious
adverse events). All adverse events were graded according to
the NCI-CTCAE, version 4.0.14 Investigators specified whether
an adverse event was considered to be treatment related, im-
mune related, or both. Tumor specimens were collected from
all patients within 60 days before the start of pembrolizumab
for biomarker analysis.
Statistical Analyses
Analysis of objective response rate was performed in the full
analysis set, defined as all patients with measurable disease
per independent central review at baseline who received at
least 1 dose of study treatment. All other analyses were per-
formed in the all-patients-as-treated population, defined as all
patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Ob-
jective response rates and associated 95% CIs were estimated
using the Clopper-Pearson method.15 Duration of response,
progression-free survival, overall survival, and survival rates
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method; the associ-
ated 95% CIs for median survival were estimated using the
Greenwood formula. Safety analyses were performed using a
data cutoff date of April 18, 2014; analyses of antitumor activ-
itywereperformedusingadatacutoffdateofOctober18,2014.
SAS software, version 9.3, was used for all analyses.
The study protocol has been previously published.16
Results
Study Conduct and Patient Characteristics
Data were pooled from 655 patients enrolled in 8 cohorts be-
tween December 2011 and September 2013 (Figure 1). The non-
randomized cohorts included 135 patients who were naive to
ipilimumab (n = 87) or who had previously received ipili-
mumab (n = 48). Randomized cohorts included 520 patients
(n = 226 ipilimumab naive and n = 294 ipilimumab treated).
Overall, 152 patients had received no prior therapy for ad-
vanced disease. Baseline patient characteristics were similar
to those observed in most large studies of patients with ad-
vancedmelanoma(Table1).Medianagewas61years,andthere
was a higher frequency of men (n = 405; 62%). Five hundred
eight patients (78%) had M1c disease, and 250 (38%) had an
elevated lactate dehydrogenase level. Only 155 patients (24%)
had tumors that contained a BRAFV600 mutation, likely rep-
resenting the trend at the time of KEYNOTE-001 enrollment
to preferentially offer patients with BRAFV600 mutations treat-
ment with BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, or both. Overall,
342 (52%) patients previously received ipilimumab, and 110
(17%) previously received BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Among
treatment-naive patients, there were fewer BRAFV600 muta-
tions (n = 25; 16%) and a smaller median baseline tumor size
(87 mm vs 102 mm for the total population). The mean inter-
valbetweenthelastipilimumabandfirstpembrolizumabdoses
was 33 weeks (range, 4-248 weeks).
As of April 18, 2014, median duration of follow-up was 15
months (range, 8-29 months), and 244 patients (37%) re-
mained on study treatment. The most common reasons for
treatment discontinuation were disease progression (n = 256;
39%) and adverse events (n = 128; 20%). For analyses of anti-
tumor activity, median duration of follow-up was 21 months
(range, 14-35 months) at the final data cutoff date of October
18, 2014.
Antitumor Activity
The 581 patients who had measurable disease assessed by cen-
tral review at baseline (RECIST v1.1) comprised the full analy-
sis set, which was the protocol-defined population for pri-
mary analysis of the objective response rate. Confirmed
objectiveresponserateassessedbycentralreview(RECISTv1.1)
in this population was 33% (95% CI, 30%-37%; n = 194), with
a complete response rate of 8% (95% CI, 6%-11%; n = 48), and
a disease control rate of 51% (95% CI, 47%-55%; n = 298). Re-
sponse rates were similar when analyzed by investigator-
assessedimmune-relatedresponsecriteria(40%[95%CI,36%-

minimal differences in objective response rate and overlap-
ping 95% CIs compared with the total population (Figure 2).
A smaller median tumor size at baseline was associated with
a higher objective response rate. There was no significant dif-
ference in antitumor activity among doses in randomized co-
horts(eTable1intheSupplement).Amongthe304ipilimumab-
treated patients, objective response rate was 29% (95% CI,
24%-34%;n = 87)(eTable2intheSupplement).Amongthe277
ipilimumab-naive patients, objective response rate was 39%
(95% CI, 33%-45%; n = 107; eTable 2 in the Supplement). In the
133 evaluable patients with no prior therapy, confirmed ob-
jectiveresponserateperRECISTv1.1bycentralreviewwas45%
(95% CI, 36%-54%; n = 60), complete response rate was 14%
(95%CI,8%-21%;n = 18),anddiseasecontrolratewas61%(95%
CI, 52%-69%; n = 81). By investigator-assessed immune-
related response criteria, the response rate was 50% (95% CI,
42%-58%; n = 76). Among patients with treatment-naive
BRAFV600–mutant melanoma, objective response rate per
RECIST v1.1 was 50% (95% CI, 28%-72%; n = 11); in patients
with BRAFV600–wild-type melanoma, objective response rate
was 45% (95% CI, 35%-55%; n = 49).
Consideringallresponders,regardlessofwhethertheyhad
measurablediseasepercentralreviewatbaseline(RECISTv1.1),
most responses were durable, with 74% (152 of 205) in the total
population and 82% (53 of 65) in the treatment-naive popu-
lation ongoing at the time of the October 18, 2014, final data
cutoff; overall, 90 patients (44%) had a response duration of
greater than 1 year. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median du-
ration of response was 28 months (range, ≥1-28 months) in the
totalpopulationandwasnotreached(range,≥3to≥28months)
in treatment-naive patients; however, there were fewer than
5 patients at risk at the time the median was reached (Figure 3).

months (95% CI, 20-29 months) in the overall population, with
12- and 24-month overall survival rates of 66% (95% CI, 62%-
69%) and 49% (95% CI, 44%-53%). In patients given pembroli-
zumab as their initial systemic cancer treatment, median over-
all survival was 31 months (95% CI, 24 months to not reached),
with 12- and 24-month overall survival rates of 73% (95% CI,
65%-79%) and 60% (95% CI, 51%-68%). Progression-free and
overall survival were numerically similar regardless of prior
treatment with ipilimumab (eFigure; eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment) or dosing regimen (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Toxicity
Pembrolizumab was generally well tolerated, without clear
evidence of a dose- or regimen-related increase in toxicities.
As of the April 18, 2014, cutoff date, median time of undergo-
ing therapy was 24 weeks (range, 0.1-123 weeks), and the me-
diannumberofpembrolizumabdoseswas10(range,1-59).The
most common any-grade toxicities considered to be treat-
ment related by investigators were fatigue, pruritus, and rash
(Table 2). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxicities occurred in
92 patients (14%). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-
related toxicity was fatigue, which occurred in 12 patients
(1.8%). All other treatment-related grade 3 or 4 toxicities oc-
curred in less than 1% of patients. Treatment-related serious
adverse events were noted in 59 (9%) patients: most fre-
quently colitis (n = 9; 1%), pyrexia (n = 6; 1%), and pneumo-
nitis (n = 5; 1%). Discontinuation due to treatment-related ad-
verse events occurred in 27 patients (4%). There were no
treatment-related deaths. The pembrolizumab toxicity pro-
file was similar in patients with ipilimumab-naive and
ipilimumab-treated melanoma, with no consistent differ-
ences observed (eTable 3 in the Supplement).

(n = 3; 0.5%), and myositis (n = 2; 0.3%). All of these events
were of grade 1 or 2 severity except for 23 grade 3 events (n = 9
for severe skin reactions, n = 7 for colitis, n = 2 each for hy-
perthyroidism and pneumonitis, and n = 1 each for hepatitis,
hypothyroidism,andnephritis)and3grade4events(n = 1each
for hepatitis, hypophysitis, and nephritis). There was no ef-
fect of prior ipilimumab treatment on immune-mediated ad-
verse events (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In this population of 655 patients, pembrolizumab treatment
was associated with an objective response rate of 33%, 12-
month progression-free survival rate of 35%, a 23-month me-
dian overall survival, and a grade 3 or 4 adverse event rate of
14%, regardless of previous ipilimumab treatment or pem-
brolizumab dose or schedule. In treatment-naive patients, the
overall response rate was 45%, the 12-month progression-
freesurvivalratewas52%,andthemedianoverallsurvivalwas
31 months. The observed difference in response rate between
ipilimumab-naive (39%) and ipilimumab-treated (29%) mela-
noma may not be directly linked to ipilimumab treatment his-
tory.AsshownbyJosephetal,17,18previousipilimumabtherapy
is not an independent predictor of response to pembroli-
zumab in patients with melanoma, for whom the sum of tar-
get lesions at baseline was the strongest predictor of re-
sponse. In the population reported in this article, median
baseline tumor burden was 90 mm in the ipilimumab-naive
population and 120 mm in the ipilimumab-treated popula-
tion. This imbalance in baseline tumor burden may confound
comparisons of pembrolizumab activity in ipilimumab-naive
and ipilimumab-treated patients and may have been related
to the difference in objective response rate observed in this
analysis. The protocol-specified requirement for disease pro-
gression on prior BRAF inhibitor therapy in the randomized
ipilimumab–refractorycohortmayhavefurtherskewedthepa-
tient population to have a lower response rate independent of
the prior therapy with ipilimumab.
The 29% objective response rate reported for the
ipilimumab-treated population is similar to the 26% objec-
tive response rate reported for the randomized KEYNOTE-
001cohortofpatientswithipilimumab-treatedmelanoma7that
led to the approval of pembrolizumab by the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA). Differences in objective response rate
observed between the cohorts may be due to chance or may
be a reflection of different enrollment criteria. All patients in
the randomized cohort were required to have received at least
2 ipilimumab doses and have confirmed disease progression
within24weeksofthelastipilimumabdoseandtreatmentwith
a BRAF inhibitor (if indicated), whereas the ipilimumab-
treated population in this analysis also included patients en-
rolled under less stringent criteria.
In a subgroup analysis, antitumor activity with pembroli-
zumab was observed across all clinicopathologic factors ex-
amined. Consistent with the aforementioned role of baseline
tumor size as a predictor of outcomes,17,18 patients with a base-
line tumor burden below the median, regardless of ipili-
mumab status, had a higher objective response rate (43%). Pa-
tients with category M1b disease also had a higher response
rate (43 of 77 patients; 56%). Compared with the total popu-
lation, the response rates were higher among the 133 patients
who were treatment naive (45% for overall response; 14% for

complete response). Although patients in the total popula-
tion with BRAFV600–mutant melanoma had a lower objective
response rate (26%), the 95% CI for BRAFV600–mutant mela-
noma is wide (95% CI, 19%-35%) and overlaps with that seen
for BRAFV600–wild-type melanoma (response rate 36% [95%
CI, 31%-40%]). Of note, in the treatment-naive population,
the objective response rate was similar in patients with
BRAFV600–mutant (50% [95% CI, 28%-72%]) and wild-type
(45%[95%CI,35%-55%])melanoma.Thissuggeststhatthedif-
ference observed in the total population may be driven in part
by the selection bias of many oncologists to treat patients with
BRAFV600–mutant melanoma deemed to be more aggressive
with BRAF inhibitors,19 as well as extrinsic confounding fac-
tors such as the selection of patients with previous treatment
with BRAF inhibitors rather than by the mutational status of
the tumor itself.20-22
The objective response rate in KEYNOTE-001 is clinically
meaningful, with 90 of 205 responders (44%) having a re-
sponse that lasted more than 1 year at the time of data cutoff
and an estimated median duration of response of 28 months.
Results of the progression-free survival analysis also support
the durability of the clinical benefit associated with pembroli-
zumab. Collectively, these data suggest that the majority of pa-
tients with melanoma treated with pembrolizumab will expe-
rience lasting objective responses.
Although there appeared to be slight differences in anti-
tumor activity based on the pembrolizumab dose and sched-
ule, data from the randomized cohorts included in this 655-
patient population showed no significant difference in activity
between pembrolizumab doses of 2 and 10 mg/kg every 3
weeks7,10 or 10 mg/kg every 2 or every 3 weeks.11 In the 540
patients enrolled in KEYNOTE-002, there was a lack of clini-
cally meaningful differences in antitumor activity between
pembrolizumab, 2 and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks.8 Similarly,
there was no dose-response relationship between pembroli-
zumab, 10 mg/kg every 2 or every 3 weeks in the 834 patients
with advanced melanoma from KEYNOTE-006.9 Taken to-
gether, these data support the FDA-approved pembroli-
zumab dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks.
The safety profile observed in this analysis over a median
follow-up duration of 15 months was similar to that reported
previously for patients with melanoma treated with

pembrolizumab7-11 No deaths from treatment-related ad-
verse events were reported, and only 4% of patients discon-
tinued pembrolizumab because of a treatment-related ad-
verse event. Most treatment-related adverse events in the
current study were of grade 1 or 2 severity and were revers-
ible. Similar to previous reports,6,11 there was no difference in
safety between the ipilimumab-naive and ipilimumab-
treated populations. Although uncommon, severe adverse
events of potential immune causality were successfully man-
agedwithtreatmentinterruption,immunosuppressivetherapy,
or both. The safety profile was similar across doses, although
a higher frequency of some adverse events was observed in pa-
tients treated with 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. This imbalance
could be partially explained by a longer duration of therapy
compared with those of 2 other dosing regimens but could also
be influenced by the small sample size of the 10-mg/kg every
2 weeks population. No significant between-dose and sched-
ule differences in toxicity were observed in the randomized
melanoma cohorts of KEYNOTE-001,7,10,11 KEYNOTE-002,8 or
KEYNOTE-006.9
Results in this study were similar to those reported for niv-
olumab, another anti–PD-1 inhibitor approved for treating pa-
tients with advanced melanoma that progressed following
ipilimumaband,ifBRAFV600–mutated,aBRAFinhibitor.Among
107patientswithadvancedmelanomatreatedwithnivolumab,
theresponseratewas31%,witha1-yearsurvivalrateof62%and
a 2-year survival rate of 43%.23 In a phase 3 study of treatment-
naive patients with melanoma, nivolumab alone or in combi-
nation with ipilimumab demonstrated significantly longer
progression-free survival and a higher objective response rate
(44%-58%) than ipilimumab monotherapy.24
Most limitations of this study are a consequence of it
being composed of multiple expansion cohorts of a larger
phase 1b study. This study accrued very rapidly after there
was initial evidence of durable tumor responses in patients
with advanced melanoma. Four different cohorts with
slightly different eligibility criteria and different doses and
schedules were included to help address questions of the
optimal dose and schedule, as well as which patients would
benefit from pembrolizumab. Besides the known variables
derived from the eligibility criteria and treatment plan, it is
certainly possible that the initial cohorts may have been
biased to patients with a higher likelihood of response, as
the prevailing thinking at that time was that only patients
with slow-growing and low-volume melanoma would ben-
efit from immunotherapy. As investigators observed signifi-
cant antitumor activity, it is likely that patients with worse
prognostic factors may have enrolled in subsequent cohorts.
Regardless, we believe that the large number of patients
reported herein and the later randomization of several key
factors in the randomized cohorts provide a comprehensive
account of the broad activity of pembrolizumab in patients
with metastatic melanoma.
Conclusions
Amongpatientswithadvancedmelanoma,pembrolizumabad-
ministration was associated with an overall objective re-
sponse rate of 33%, 12-month progression-free survival rate
of 35%, and median overall survival of 23 months; grade 3 or
4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14%.
