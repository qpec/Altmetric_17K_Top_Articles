body mass index and prevalence of
overweight/obesity in a nationally-
representative survey of Canadian adults

Abstract
Background: This study examined the association of breakfast consumption, and the type of breakfast consumed,
with body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) and prevalence rates and odds ratios (OR) of overweight/obesity among
Canadian adults. These associations were examined by age group and sex.
Methods: We used data from non-pregnant, non-lactating participants aged ≥ 18 years (n = 12,377) in the
Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2.2, a population-based, nationally-representative, cross-sectional
study. Height and weight were measured, and BMI was calculated. Breakfast consumption was self-reported
during a standardized 24-h recall; individuals were classified as breakfast non-consumers, consumers of breakfasts
that included ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC) or as other breakfast consumers. Mean BMI and prevalence and OR of
overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 25) were compared among breakfast groups, with adjustment for sociodemographic
variables (including age, sex, race, marital status, food security, language spoken at home, physical activity
category, smoking, education level and supplement use).
Results: For the entire sample, mean BMI was significantly lower among RTEC-breakfast consumers than other
breakfast consumers (mean ± SE 26.5 ± 0.2 vs. 27.1 ± 0.1 kg/m2), but neither group differed significantly from
breakfast non-consumers (27.1 ± 0.3 kg/m2). Similar results were seen in women only, but BMI of men did not
differ by breakfast category. Overweight/obesity prevalence and OR did not differ among breakfast groups for
the entire sample or for all men and women separately. When examined by sex and age group, differences
were inconsistent, but tended to be more apparent in women than men.
Conclusion: Among Canadian adults, breakfast consumption was not consistently associated with differences
in BMI or overweight/obesity prevalence.

Introduction
It is widely believed that breakfast consumption, versus
non-consumption, protects against overweight and obesity
[1–3]. Empirical support is provided by a large number of
observational studies, summarized in several systematic
reviews and meta-analyses [2, 4, 5]. The most compre-
hensive of these included an analysis of 88 study groups
and yielded a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.55 (95 % CI:
1.46, 1.65) for the likelihood of being overweight or
obese among breakfast non-consumers versus breakfast
consumers [2]. There was a tendency for funnel-plot
asymmetry (p = 0.086), suggesting a possibility of publi-
cation bias. Among these studies, many were conducted
with children and adolescents, rather than adults.
Moreover, relatively few examined variability within a
population associated with age, sex or the consumption
of different types of breakfasts, although several did
assess associations with breakfasts containing or not
containing ready-to-eat cereal (RTEC).

 There is also an extensive literature indicating that
breakfast consumption is associated with improved nu-
trient intakes and adequacy [6–11]. In a population-
representative sample of Canadian adults, we previously
observed that breakfast consumers (versus non-consumers)
had higher nutrient intakes and a lower prevalence of nutri-
ent inadequacy [9]. We also noted that intakes of several
key nutrients were higher (and prevalence of inadequacy
lower) in those who consumed breakfasts containing RTEC
compared to those who consumed other breakfasts [9].
Thus, using data from adults in the same population-
representative sample of Canadians (in which the over-
all prevalence of overweight/obesity among adults was
59 % [12]), we sought to assess whether breakfast con-
sumption and the type of breakfast consumed (with or
without RTEC) were associated with body mass index
(BMI; kg/m2) and the prevalence rates and OR of over-
weight/obesity. Further, we examined whether associa-
tions varied by age group and sex.
Methods
Data source
The present study is a secondary analysis of data collected
in the Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2.2
(CCHS 2.2), a cross-sectional, nationally-representative
survey conducted by Statistics Canada in 2004 [13, 14]. The
target population for CCHS 2.2 represented approximately
98 % of the Canadian population, and included individuals
living in private dwellings in the 10 Canadian provinces.
The multistage stratified cluster sampling plan was
designed to be representative in terms of age, sex, geog-
raphy and socioeconomic status [13, 14]. Data collec-
tion was completed in person by trained interviewers,
who received extensive standardized training in all proce-
dures [14]. Survey components included a 24-h dietary
recall, a general health questionnaire to assess socio-
demographic and lifestyle variables, and measured height
and weight (which were used to calculate BMI) [14]. The
response rate for the survey was 76.5 %, and the survey
weights included a non-response adjustment. Ethical
approval for population surveys conducted by Statistics
Canada, such as CCHS 2.2, is based on the authority of
the Statistics Act of Canada [15].
Analytical sample
For this analysis, we included data from CCHS 2.2
respondents aged 18 years and above who were not
pregnant or lactating, had measured values for height and
weight and completed a valid 24-h recall (n = 12,337). The
24-h recall was conducted using a modification of the
Automated Multiple Pass Method [13, 14]. In the first
“pass”, respondents were asked to list all foods and bever-
ages consumed on the day before the survey. Foods and
beverages could be listed in any order; there was no
requirement to recall foods in a time sequence. Subse-
quent “passes” obtained additional details about each food
item listed, including the amount consumed and what the
respondent called the eating occasion (e.g., breakfast,
lunch, dinner, a snack). Thus, for our analysis, “breakfast”
included any foods or beverages consumed during the 24-
h recall at an eating occasion that the respondent identi-
fied as breakfast. Those who did not identify any items as
being consumed at breakfast were classified as breakfast
non-consumers (i.e., "breakfast skippers"). Those who con-
sumed RTEC as a component of breakfast were classified
as RTEC breakfast consumers, and those whose breakfasts
did not include RTEC were classified as other breakfast
consumers. Approval to conduct the analyses reported in
this paper was obtained from the Statistics Canada Re-
search Data Centre program [16], project number 11-
SSH-UTO-2848.
Statistical analysis
Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), version 9.2 (Cary, NC)
and SUDAAN, version 10.0 (RTI International, Research
Triangle Park, NC) were used to analyze the data.
SUDAAN was used to create variance estimates and
standard errors (SE) of proportions. All analyses were ad-
justed for the complex CCHS 2.2 sampling design using
appropriate sample weights and, when necessary, the
MISSUNIT option in SUDAAN was used due to a num-
ber of cases with only one stratum within a primary sam-
pling unit. This option then calculates the variance
contribution using the difference from the overall mean of
the population. Means, percentages and standard errors
were
obtained
using
PROC
DESCRIPT.
Covariate-
adjusted mean BMI values were compared among the
three breakfast groups using analysis of variance (i.e.,
using PROC REGRESS). Overweight/obesity prevalence
was defined as the proportion with BMI ≥ 25.0, and was
compared among the breakfast groups using a t-test.
Covariates included age, sex, race, household food se-
curity (reflecting minimal or no limitations to house-
hold food access in the context of financial resource
constraint) [17], marital status, language spoken at
home, physical activity category, smoking, level of edu-
cational attainment and supplement use. A p value of <
0.05 (Bonferroni-adjusted p < 0.0167) was used to assess
significance of differences by breakfast group. Finally,
adjusted OR and 95th percentile confidence limits for
overweight/obesity were calculated to compare the two
groups
of
breakfast
consumers
to
breakfast
non-
consumers.
Results
Demographic characteristics
As reported previously, the weighted proportions who
did not consume breakfast, consumed RTEC breakfasts

 and consumed other breakfasts were 11, 20 and 69 %,
respectively [9]. Significant differences in demographic
characteristics were observed among groups (Table 1).
Specifically, breakfast non-consumers were younger and
less likely to be married or living common-law than the
two groups of breakfast consumers. They were the least
likely to use dietary supplements and to be food secure,
and the most likely to smoke. Breakfast non-consumers
were also more likely to be male than other breakfast
consumers, but did not differ significantly from RTEC
breakfast consumers in that regard. RTEC breakfast con-
sumers were the most likely to use dietary supplements
and be food secure, and were more likely than the other
two groups to be white. Other breakfast consumers were
intermediate in the proportions that smoked, used diet-
ary supplements and were food secure. They were less
likely to speak English at home than RTEC breakfast
consumers.
Body mass index
Mean values for BMI by age group, sex and breakfast status
are displayed in Table 2. For the entire sample (both sexes
combined), mean BMI was significantly lower among
RTEC breakfast consumers than among other breakfast
consumers, but neither of these groups differed significantly
from breakfast non-consumers. The same pattern of differ-
ences was observed among those aged 51–70 years and ≥
71 years, whereas among adults ≤ 50 years, BMI did not dif-
fer by breakfast group. When the sexes were examined sep-
arately, no differences by breakfast group were detected for
the entire sample of men or for men up to 50 years of age.
Among men aged 51–70 years, BMI was significantly lower
in
RTEC
breakfast
consumers
than
breakfast
non-
consumers, with other breakfast consumers having an
intermediate value that did not differ from either of the
other two groups. Among men aged ≥ 71 years, BMI was
significantly lower in RTEC consumers than in other
breakfast consumers. In this age group, mean BMI ap-
peared lowest in breakfast non-consumers, but high vari-
ability meant that differences with the other breakfast
groups were not significant. Among the entire group of
women, BMI was lower in women who consumed RTEC
breakfasts versus other breakfasts, with breakfast non-
consumers having a value that did not differ from the other
groups. This same pattern was observed among women
aged ≥ 71 years. In contrast, among women aged 51–70
years, BMI was significantly lower among breakfast non-
consumers than among other breakfast consumers, with
RTEC breakfast consumers having an intermediate value
that did not differ from the other two groups.
Prevalence of overweight and obesity
The prevalence of overweight and obesity by age group
and for adults of all ages is shown in Fig. 1 for both
sexes combined and for men and women separately.
Overall, no significant differences in overweight/obesity
prevalence by breakfast group were seen among adults
as a whole, nor were differences observed in all men or
all women. When the combined sexes were examined by
age group (Panel a in Fig. 1), the only significant differ-
ence was among those aged 18–30 years, where over-
weight/obesity prevalence was significantly higher in
breakfast non-consumers than in those who consumed
RTEC breakfasts (50 % vs 37 %, respectively). Those who
consumed other breakfasts had an intermediate preva-
lence (42 %) that did not differ from either of the other
two groups. No differences were observed in men in any
of the age groups (Panel b in Fig. 1). In women (Panel c
in Fig. 1), prevalence of overweight/obesity was signifi-
cantly higher in breakfast non-consumers aged 18–30
years (49 %) than in both groups of breakfast consumers
(31 % in RTEC breakfast consumers and 36 % in other
breakfast consumers). Conversely, among women aged
51–70 years, the prevalence of overweight/obesity was

 significantly higher among those who consumed other

not differ from either of the other two groups.
Table 3 presents adjusted OR for overweight/obesity
for each of the two breakfast groups, compared to break-
fast non-consumers (reference group). Data are shown for
all adults and for men and women separately, and also for
all ages combined and by separate age groups. There were
no significant differences in OR for the entire group of
adults aged ≥ 18 years, for all men aged ≥18 years or for
all women aged ≥ 18 years. When examined by age group,
the odds of overweight/obesity were lower among all
adults aged 18–30 years who consumed RTEC breakfasts.
There were no differences in odds among men of any age
group. Among women aged 18–30 years, both groups of
breakfast consumers had lower odds of overweight/obesity
than breakfast non-consumers, whereas among those aged
51–70 years, consumers of other breakfasts had higher
odds of overweight/obesity than non-consumers.
Discussion
In this population-based study of Canadian adults, neither
breakfast consumption (versus non-consumption) nor the
type of breakfast consumed (whether or not RTEC was
included) was consistently associated with BMI or the
prevalence of overweight/obesity. For the overall adult
population, mean BMI of breakfast non-consumers and
those who consumed other breakfasts was almost identical
(27.1 ± 0.3 and 27.1 ± 0.1 kg/m2, respectively). While mean
BMI of RTEC breakfast consumers (26.5 kg/m2) was sig-
nificantly lower than that of other breakfast consumers,
the difference of 0.6 kg/m2 reflects a difference of only
1.7 kg at the mean population height of 1.68 m. Further-
more, the prevalence of overweight/obesity and the OR
for being overweight/obese did not differ among the three
breakfast groups for the adult population as a whole:
Overweight/obesity prevalence was close to 60 % in all
groups, and adjusted OR (and 95 % CI) for consumers of
RTEC breakfasts and other breakfasts were 0.95 (0.72,
1.26) and 1.04 (0.81, 1.34), respectively, relative to break-
fast non-consumers. When these associations were exam-
ined by sex and age (which has not been done in the
majority of previous studies), they were not consistent.
Our results can be compared to those of other
population-based,
cross-sectional
studies
of
adults
[11, 18–25], the majority of which report data on
overweight/obesity prevalence. Significantly higher adjusted
OR for overweight and/or obesity were observed among all
adults who skipped breakfast in studies conducted in
Taiwan [18] and Sweden [19], and among both male
and female breakfast skippers in a study conducted in
Spain [20]. In contrast, OR were not significantly differ-
ent between breakfast skippers and consumers in stud-
ies conducted in Serbia [21] or the United States [22].
Three studies, all conducted in the United States, ex-
amined associations with the type of breakfast con-
sumed [11, 22, 23]. One study identified 12 breakfast
patterns, including no breakfast [11]. Compared to break-
fast non-consumers, the OR for overweight/obesity were
lower among consumers of five types of breakfasts, but
were similar among consumers of the other six breakfast
types (data comparing all breakfast consumers to non-
consumers were not provided). In the second study [22],
OR for overweight/obesity did not differ between break-
fast consumers and non-consumers; however, female but
not male consumers of RTEC breakfasts had lower OR
for overweight/obesity compared to consumers of other
breakfasts. The third study [23] examined young adults

 aged 20–39 years and found the OR for overweight/obesity
was lower in RTEC breakfast consumers, as compared to
both breakfast skippers and other breakfast consumers. Re-
sults by sex were not reported. Our study is most compar-
able to the two latter studies [22, 23], in that differences
were assessed among those consuming no breakfast, RTEC
breakfast and other breakfasts. However, in contrast to
Song et al. [22], we found no difference in OR for over-
weight/obesity between consumers of RTEC and other
breakfasts among the entire group of women. And in con-
trast to Deshmukh-Taskar et al. [23] who studied young
adults, in our study the OR was lower among young female
consumers of both RTEC and other breakfasts when com-
pared to breakfast skippers.
A smaller number of studies, all of which used data from
different waves of the United States National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), report on mean
BMI by breakfast intake [11, 23–25]. Cho et al. [24], using
data from NHANES III (1998–2004), found that mean
BMI was lower among those who consumed RTEC, cooked
cereal or quick breads for breakfast than among those who
skipped breakfast or consumed breakfast based on meat
and eggs. The analysis of Kant et al. [25], with data from
NHANES 1999–2004, reported that BMI was lower in
women who consumed breakfast, but not in men.
Deshmukh-Taskar et al. [23], with data from NHANES
1999–2006, reported that BMI was lower among young
adults who consumed RTEC, as compared to breakfast
skippers or other breakfast consumers. Finally, the study by
O’Neil et al. [11], using data from NHANES 2001–2008,
found lower BMI among consumers of four of 11 breakfast
types compared to those who did not eat breakfast, but
similar BMI among consumers of the other seven breakfast
types. We observed a lower BMI among those who con-
sumed RTEC breakfasts compared to those consuming
other breakfasts, but neither group differed from breakfast
non-consumers.
Variability in the associations between breakfast and
weight status also exists within studies. For example,
breakfast intake was associated with lower BMI or OR
for overweight/obesity in women but not men [22, 25],
whereas in another large study [20], the OR for over-
weight/obesity among breakfast skippers versus con-
sumers were very similar in men and women (1.58 and
1.53, respectively). Our study appears to be the first to
examine weight status in association with breakfast by
both sex and age group. Although we did detect some
differences, for the most part these were observed between
consumers of RTEC breakfasts and other breakfasts, rather
than between breakfast consumers and non-consumers.
The one exception was in women aged 18–30 years, where
prevalence and OR for overweight/obesity were lower

was no evidence for this trend; indeed, among women
aged 51–70 years, those who consumed other break-
fasts had a significantly higher OR when compared to
breakfast non-consumers.
The reasons for different findings across and within
studies
are
difficult
to
ascertain.
Most
of
the
population-based studies described above did not adjust
for energy intake [11, 18–21, 24]; in some cases this
may have been because data on energy intake were not
available [18, 20, 21]. We have previously reported the
energy intakes of adult participants in CCHS [9], and
although intakes were lower among breakfast non-
consumers compared to the two breakfast groups, in
the present analysis we chose not to adjust for energy
intake as it is on the causal pathway to overweight/
obesity. Authors of several other studies have made the
same choice [11, 19, 24], while at least one study pre-
sented results with energy intake included or excluded
as a covariate [22] and others included it [23, 25]. Over-
all, this adjustment did not appear to differentiate be-
tween studies that did or did not detect differences in
BMI or obesity prevalence among breakfast groups.
Previous studies also differed to some extent in terms
of adjusting for other sociodemographic variables, but
all controlled for a substantial number of these vari-
ables, as did our study. Furthermore, differences in var-
iables that were controlled (e.g., marital status, alcohol
consumption) were not consistently associated with
study results, suggesting that the extent of statistical
adjustment is unlikely to explain the different results. It
is possible that cultural differences related to breakfast
may play a role, yet studies conducted in countries with
different cultures (e.g., Taiwan, Sweden, Spain) [18–20]
reported similar findings, and studies conducted in the
same country (e.g., the United States) [22, 25] were not
always consistent.
Taken together, the lack of consistent patterns of dif-
ferences in weight status between breakfast consumers
and non-consumers, or between consumers of RTEC
breakfasts and other breakfasts, appears to argue against
a physiologically-based causal relationship. It has been
suggested that breakfast consumption may serve as a
marker for a healthier lifestyle [3, 26, 27] and that break-
fast consumers believe that eating breakfast helps with
weight control [3], which may contribute to the associa-
tions observed in some studies. To date, the few ran-
domized trials that have been conducted have not
provided convincing evidence that breakfast consump-
tion has beneficial effects on weight status [28–30].
It is possible that future research may establish that
specific types of breakfast are beneficial for long-term
weight management or have other health benefits. For
example,
among
adolescents
who
habitually
skip
breakfast, high-protein breakfasts resulted in improved
short-term appetite control and satiety [31–33]. Those
findings, however, appear to contrast with population-
based cross-sectional studies reporting that breakfasts
characterized as high in grains and fruit juice, RTEC
or cooked cereal were associated with reduced OR of
overweight/obesity, whereas breakfasts characterized
as high in eggs or meat (and thus higher in protein)
were not [11, 24]. Nevertheless, irrespective of whether
breakfast itself (or a certain type of breakfast) affects
weight status, the overall benefits of breakfast consump-
tion in terms of nutrient intake and diet quality should
not be overlooked [6–11].
Strengths of this study include the large population-
representative sample, use of measured values for
height and weight, examination of associations by sex
and age group, and consideration of potentially con-
founding variables. Limitations are that the data were
self-reported and that a single 24-h recall may not re-
flect habitual patterns of breakfast intake. However,
the differences in sociodemographic variables that we
observed among breakfast groups suggest that many
of those classified in a given breakfast group may
have consistently skipped breakfast or consumed a
given type of breakfast. We used the conventional
BMI cut-point of ≥25 kg/m2 to define overweight/
obesity, and some research indicates that for older
adults, BMI in the overweight range is associated with
increased
health
and
longevity
[34–37].
We
also
assessed only two types of breakfasts, and a recent
study examined weight status of consumers of 11 dif-
ferent types of breakfasts, as compared to breakfast
non-consumers [11]. Nevertheless, like our study, that
study also observed variability in the associations be-
tween breakfast and weight status, supporting the con-
cept that breakfast per se may not have a consistent
impact on weight. Finally, the cross-sectional nature
of our data means that causation cannot be inferred.
This, however, would be more of a concern if we were
reporting
strong
associations,
rather
than
their
absence.
Conclusions
Among this large population-representative sample of
Canadian adults, breakfast consumption was not consist-
ently associated with BMI or overweight/obesity pre-
valence.
Our
findings,
in
conjunction
with
other
observational and experimental evidence, suggest that it
may be inappropriate to promote weight-management
benefits of breakfast consumption per se. Nevertheless,
it is still possible that particular types of breakfast con-
sumption may be helpful for weight management;

 future long-term randomized trials appear necessary
in this regard. In the meantime, the consistently-
reported nutritional contributions of breakfast should
not be neglected.
