The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation has initiated a continuous review of new, peer-reviewed,
published cardiopulmonary resuscitation science. This is the second annual summary of International Consensus

Recommendations that includes the most recent cardiopulmonary resuscitation science reviewed by the
International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation. This summary addresses the role of antiarrhythmic drugs in
adults and children and includes the Advanced Life Support Task Force and Pediatric Task Force consensus
statements, which summarize the most recent published evidence and an assessment of the quality of the evi-
dence based on Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria. The state-
ments include consensus treatment recommendations approved by members of the relevant task forces. Insights
into the deliberations of each task force are provided in the Values and Preferences and Task Force Insights
sections. Finally, the task force members have listed the top knowledge gaps for further research.
This is the second in a series of annual International Liaison
Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) International Consensus on
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care
Science With Treatment Recommendations (CoSTR) summary pub-
lications that summarize the ILCOR task force analyses of published
resuscitation evidence. The review this year addresses the use of anti-
arrhythmic drugs for the management of adult and pediatric cardiac
arrest and the period immediately after return of spontaneous circula-
tion (ROSC). Draft CoSTRs were posted online on April 19, 2018 [1],
and included the data reviewed and draft treatment recommendations
with comments accepted through May 15, 2018. The draft Advanced
Life Support (ALS) CoSTR was viewed by ≈4459 visitors (5 comments),
and the Pediatric CoSTR was viewed by ≈1183 visitors (2 comments).
A total of 8 CoSTRs are now available online, and they have been
viewed by ≈11 000 visitors.
This summary statement contains the final wording of the CoSTR as
approved by the task forces and by the ILCOR member councils. This
statement differs in several respects from the website draft CoSTRs: The
language used to describe the evidence is not restricted to standard

been expanded to provide more transparency about the rationale for
treatment recommendations; and finally, the task forces have prior-
itized knowledge gaps requiring future research studies.

 Grading
of
Recommendations,
Assessment,
Development,
and
Evaluation approach. This analysis is detailed in a systematic review
published by the Knowledge Synthesis Unit [2] and the ILCOR topic
experts. This Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development,
and Evaluation approach rates the quality of evidence that supports the
intervention effects (predefined by the PICO [population, intervention,
comparator, outcome] question) as high, moderate, low, or very low.
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) begin the analysis as high-quality
evidence, and observational studies begin the analysis as low-quality
evidence. Five factors may lead to a downgrade of the quality of evi-
dence, and 3 factors may enable an upgrade of the quality of the evi-
dence (Tables 1 and 2). Each statement includes the pertinent outcome
data listing both relative risk with 95% CI and risk difference (RD) with
95% CI. The RD is the absolute difference between the risks and is
calculated by subtracting the risk in the control group from the risk in
the intervention group. This absolute effect enables a more clinically
useful assessment of the magnitude of the effect of an intervention and
enables calculation of the number needed to treat (number needed to
treat 1/RD).
Outcome measures were ranked by the task forces by using an ap-
proach that is being applied consistently for all ILCOR PICO questions.
Longer-term, patient-centered outcomes are considered more important
than process variables and shorter-term outcomes [3,4]. In making
these rankings, the task forces considered that shorter-term outcomes
(eg, termination of ventricular fibrillation, ROSC, survival to hospital
admission) are a useful measure of antiarrhythmic drug efficacy.
Background
Antiarrhythmic drugs have a potential role in the treatment of
cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular
tachycardia (pVT) that is refractory to electric defibrillation attempts
[5,6]. This update on the role of antiarrhythmic drugs was prioritized
by the ALS Task Force after publication of an RCT comparing amio-
darone, lidocaine, and placebo [7] following the 2015 ALS CoSTR
[5,6]. The Pediatric Task Force took the opportunity to rereview the
most recent pediatric published evidence.
The reported incidence of adult VF/pVT cardiac arrest varies ac-
cording to the precise definitions used and the population studied. For
treated adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), an initial arrest
rhythm of VF/pVT was documented in 4.1% to 19.8% of arrests in a
series from 7 Asian countries [8], 27.9% in a series from Australia and
New Zealand [9], an average of 22.2% (range, 4.4%–50%) in a series
from 27 European countries [10], and 21.3% in a report from the
United States [11]. There are far fewer international data for adult in-
hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA), and the reported incidence of initial VF/
pVT is 18.9% in Italy [12], 16.9% in the United Kingdom [13], and
19.5% in the United States [14].
An initial cardiac arrest rhythm of VF/pVT is less common in chil-
dren than in adults, although the frequency varies greatly by age. In
OHCA, an initial documented rhythm of VF/pVT has been reported in
3% to 14% of pediatric arrests in the All-Japan Utstein Registry
[15–19], in 7% of pediatric arrests in Australia [20], in 4% to 12% of
pediatric arrests in Sweden [21], and in 6% to 7.8% of pediatric arrests
in the United States [22–26]. The frequency of VF/pVT as an initial
arrest rhythm is typically lowest in children < 5 years of age, averaging
1% to 6% [15,18,19,21], and higher in adolescents, averaging 18% to
20% in Japan [15,18], 17% in Sweden [21], and 15% to 19.4% in the
United States [22,23]. Fewer data are available on the frequency of VF/
pVT as the first reported arrest rhythm in pediatric IHCA. An initial
rhythm of VF/pVT has been reported in 9% of pediatric IHCA cases in
Australia [27]. In the American Heart Association's Get With The
Guidelines–Resuscitation registry of IHCA events in 3 pediatric cohorts
with enrollment in overlapping years, 10% to 14% demonstrated an
initial rhythm of VF/pVT [28–30]. In a small multicenter/multicountry
series of 40 IHCA events in 37 children who had a high incidence
(56.8%) of cardiac disease and of previous cardiac arrests (24.3%), VF/
pVT was the first assessed rhythm in 42.5% of events [31].
Antiarrhythmic drugs are used to treat VF/pVT only if this rhythm
persists after attempted defibrillation (ie, shock delivery). In a large
RCT (n 23 711) of continuous or interrupted chest compressions during

GRADE Terminology.
Risk of bias
Study limitations in randomized trials include lack of allocation concealment, lack of blinding, incomplete accounting of patients and outcome events,
selective outcome reporting bias, and stopping early for benefit. Study limitations in observational studies include failure to apply appropriate
eligibility criteria, flawed measurement of exposure and outcome, failure to adequately control confounding, and incomplete follow-up.
Inconsistency
Criteria for inconsistency in results include the following: Point estimates vary widely across studies; CIs show minimal or no overlap; statistical test
for heterogeneity shows a low P value; and the I2 is large (a measure of variation in point estimates resulting from among-study differences).
Indirectness
Sources of indirectness include data from studies with differences in population (eg, OHCA instead of IHCA, adults instead of children), differences in
the intervention (eg, different CV ratios), differences in outcome, and indirect comparisons.
Imprecision
Low event rates or small sample sizes will generally result in wide CIs and therefore imprecision.
Publication bias
Several sources of publication bias include tendency not to publish negative studies and the influence of industry-sponsored studies. An asymmetrical
funnel plot increases suspicion of publication bias.
Good practice statements
Guideline panels often consider it necessary to issue guidance on specific topics that do not lend themselves to a formal review of research evidence.
The reason might be that research into the topic is unlikely to be located or would be considered unethical or infeasible. Criteria for issuing a
nongraded good practice statement include the following: There is overwhelming certainty that the benefits of the recommended guidance will
outweigh harms, and a specific rationale is provided; the statements should be clear and actionable to a specific target population; the guidance is
deemed necessary and might be overlooked by some providers if not specifically communicated; and the recommendations should be readily
implementable by the specific target audience to which the guidance is directed.

 adult cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for OHCA [32], 22.5% of
patients had an initial rhythm of VF/pVT, and ≈6.7% of all patients
received an antiarrhythmic drug (amiodarone, 4.7%; lidocaine, 2%). In
a large observational study (n 108 079) of airway management using
data from the Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation registry of IHCA
events, ≈18% of all patients had an initial rhythm of VF/pVT, and 25%
of all patients received an antiarrhythmic drug (amiodarone, 17%; li-
docaine, 8%) during attempted resuscitation [33].
Reports of antiarrhythmic drug use during treatment of pediatric
cardiac arrest are extremely limited.

The
Guidelines–Resuscitation registry of IHCA events enrolled patients in
overlapping years. In the first study of 1005 consecutive pediatric pa-
tients enrolled from 2000 to 2004, 10% had initial VF/pVT and 27%
had VF/pVT at some time during the arrest. A total of 24% of all pa-
tients received an antiarrhythmic drug. Amiodarone was administered
to 23% and lidocaine to 47% of those patients with VF/pVT [29]. An-
other larger series from the same registry enrolled 553 children with
VF/pVT from 2000 to 2005. Nearly half (49%) of those who had VF/
pVT were treated with an antiarrhythmic drug; 19.5% of those with VF/
pVT received amiodarone. Approximately two-thirds of the children
who received amiodarone also received lidocaine [34].
In the following sections, we include the predefined PICO question
addressed by the systematic review; the summary CoSTR; the values,
preferences, and insights of the task force during the consensus process;
and the priority knowledge gaps. The summary CoSTR for adults is
described first, followed by that for children and infants.
The population, intervention, comparator, outcome, study
designs, and time frame
Population
Adults and children in any setting (in hospital or out of hospital)
with cardiac arrest and a shockable rhythm (VF/pVT) at any time
during CPR or immediately after ROSC were included.
Intervention
Intervention included administration (intravenous or intraosseous)
of an antiarrhythmic drug during CPR or immediately (within 1 hour)
after ROSC.
Comparators
Comparators included another antiarrhythmic drug or placebo or no
drug during CPR or immediately (within 1 hour) after ROSC.
Outcomes
Survival to hospital discharge with good neurological outcome and
survival to hospital discharge were ranked as critical outcomes. ROSC
was ranked as an important outcome. For an antiarrhythmic drug given
within 1 hour of ROSC, rearrest was included as an important outcome.
Study designs
RCTs and nonrandomized studies (non-RCTs, interrupted time
series, controlled before-and-after studies, cohort studies) were eligible
for inclusion.
Time frame
All years and all languages were included as long as there was an
English abstract; unpublished studies (eg, conference abstracts, trial
protocols) were excluded.
The literature search was updated to August 15, 2017. A search of
the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library identified 9371 records
after removal of duplicates. After the records were screened, 409 full-
text articles were assessed for eligibility. Fourteen adult RCTs (16 ar-
ticles) and 19 non-RCTS (18 adult studies, 1 pediatric study, 22 articles)
were considered by the task forces to develop the CoSTR.
Use of antiarrhythmic drugs during resuscitation of adults with
Vf/Pvt cardiac arrest or immediately after ROSC
Consensus on science
The systematic review included searches to identify comparative
data on the use of antiarrhythmic drugs, including amiodarone versus
placebo, lidocaine versus placebo, amiodarone versus lidocaine, mag-
nesium versus placebo, bretylium versus placebo, lidocaine versus
bretylium, amiodarone versus nifekalant, lidocaine versus nifekalant,
and lidocaine versus sotalol. Given the availability of comparative data
from RCTs, the ALS Task Force did not focus on the data from non-RCTs
when evaluating the estimated effect size of these drugs and included
only data from the RCTs in the meta-analyses in this document. The
reason is that the 18 adult observational studies identified had sub-
stantial heterogeneity and unmeasured confounders, including “re-
suscitation time bias” [35].
The amiodarone versus placebo comparison is based on 2 RCTs: the
ARREST trial (Amiodarone in the Out-of-Hospital Resuscitation of
Refractory Sustained Ventricular Tachyarrhythmias) [36] and the ROC-
ALPS trial (Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Amiodarone, Lido-
caine, or Placebo Study) [7]. The amiodarone versus lidocaine com-
parison is based on 2 RCTs: the ALIVE trial (Amiodarone Versus Lido-
caine in Prehospital Ventricular Fibrillation Evaluation) [37] and the
ROC-ALPS trial [7]. For results of these trials, we have provided pooled
estimates and individual study estimates (the reasons are described
later in the Values and Preferences and ALS Task Force Insights sec-
tion). No RCTs were identified that addressed the use of antiarrhythmic
drugs immediately after ROSC (defined as within 1 hour after ROSC).
The summary of findings and point estimates are shown in Table 3.
Amiodarone versus placebo
The combined evidence from 2 RCTs (the ARREST and ROC-ALPS
trials) comparing amiodarone with placebo for OHCA showed, with
very low certainty, no statistically significant difference in survival to
hospital discharge with good neurological outcome (n = 2526), sur-
vival to hospital discharge (n = 2530), or ROSC (n = 2537) [7,36]. The
quality of this combined evidence was downgraded because of concerns
about risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. The ARREST trial [36]
risk of bias was noted because investigators did not report intention-to-
treat data. Although the ROC-ALPS trial enrolled patients from 2013 to
2015, the risk of indirectness was noted because resuscitation practice
at the time of the patient enrollment for the ARREST trial (1994–1997)
differed substantially from current practice. An additional risk of in-
directness resulted from the fact that the placebo groups in both trials
received polysorbate 80. Concerns about differences in resuscitation
practice at the time of patient enrollment and about the use of the
polysorbate 80 placebo are discussed further in the Values and Pre-
ferences and ALS Task Force Insights section of this article. The wide
CIs around the point estimates, the number of events, and a sample size
that did not meet the optimal information size criteria resulted in a
downgrade for imprecision; this raises concerns that both studies may
have been underpowered to detect a clinically meaningful treatment
effect [48].
One RCT, the ARREST trial, involved 504 patients and compared the
Cordarone (amiodarone in polysorbate 80) preparation of amiodarone
with an active polysorbate 80 placebo [36]. This study showed, with
very low certainty, no statistically significant difference in survival to
hospital discharge with good neurological outcome or survival to

 hospital discharge. However, it did show a statistically significant in-
crease in ROSC. For the same reasons given for the combined data
stated earlier, the quality of this evidence was downgraded because of
concerns about risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision.
One RCT, the ROC-ALPS trial, compared the Nexterone preparation
of amiodarone with saline placebo. This trial showed, with moderate
certainty, no statistically significant difference in survival to hospital
discharge with good neurological outcome (n = 2022), survival to
hospital discharge (n = 2026), or ROSC (n = 2033) [7]. The quality of
the evidence was downgraded because of concerns about imprecision
that related to wide CIs around the point estimates, the number of
events, and a sample size that did not meet the optimal information size
criteria.
Lidocaine versus placebo
One RCT, the ROC-ALPS trial, compared lidocaine with placebo [7].
This study showed, with moderate certainty, no statistically significant
difference in survival to hospital discharge with good neurological
outcome (n = 2039) or survival to hospital discharge (n = 2041). The
quality of the evidence was downgraded because of concerns about
imprecision related to wide CIs around the point estimates, the number
of events, and a sample size that did not meet the optimal information
size criteria.
The same RCT (ROC-ALPS) compared lidocaine with placebo and
involved 2051 patients. This trial showed, with high certainty, a sta-
tistically significant increase in ROSC favoring lidocaine [7].
Amiodarone versus lidocaine
One RCT (ROC-ALPS) compared amiodarone with lidocaine and
showed, with moderate certainty, no statistically significant difference
in survival to hospital discharge with good neurological outcome
(n = 1951), survival to hospital discharge (n = 1955), or ROSC
(n = 1966) [7]. The quality of the evidence was downgraded because of
concerns about imprecision that related to wide CIs around the point
estimates, the number of events, and a sample size that did not meet the
optimal information size criteria.
Two RCTs, the ALIVE trial [37] and the ROC-ALPS trial [7], com-
pared amiodarone with lidocaine and involved 2302 patients. These
trials showed, with very low certainty, no statistically significant dif-
ference in survival to hospital discharge [7,37]. The quality of this
combined evidence was downgraded because of concerns about risk of
indirectness and imprecision. The ALIVE trial37 was at risk of in-
directness because resuscitation practice at the time of patient enroll-
ment (1995–2001) differed substantially from current practice. In ad-
dition, lidocaine was mixed with polysorbate 80, a preparation that is
not used commercially; the effects of adding polysorbate 80 to the li-
docaine are uncertain. The wide CIs around the point estimates, the
number of events, and a sample size that did not meet the optimal in-
formation size criteria resulted in a downgrade for imprecision.
One RCT (the ALIVE trial) compared amiodarone with lidocaine
mixed with polysorbate 80 and involved 347 patients. This trial
showed, with very low certainty, no statistically significant difference
in survival to hospital discharge [37] The quality of this evidence was
downgraded because of concerns about indirectness and imprecision for
the reasons given previously.
Magnesium versus placebo
Three RCTs comparing magnesium with placebo and involving 332
patients showed, with very low certainty, no statistically significant
difference in survival to hospital discharge with good neurological
outcome [38–40]. The quality of this evidence was downgraded be-
cause of risk of bias, imprecision, and indirectness. The risk of bias
resulted from uncertainties about allocation concealment and blinding
of clinicians and outcome assessors.
The wide CIs around the point estimates, the number of events, and
a sample size that did not meet the optimal information size criteria
resulted in the downgrade for imprecision. The risk of indirectness was
noted because resuscitation practice at the times of patient enrollment
(all 3 studies completed enrollment before the publication of the 2000
International Consensus recommendations and 2000 council guide-
lines) differed substantially from current practice, and 2 of these studies
[39,40] included patients who had arrest rhythms other than VF/pVT.
Four RCTs (the 3 studies cited in the previous paragraph[38–40]
plus an additional study [41]) compared magnesium with placebo and
involved 437 patients. These studies showed, with very low certainty,
no statistically significant difference in survival to hospital discharge or
ROSC [38–41]. The quality of this evidence was downgraded because of
concerns about risk of bias and imprecision for reasons given pre-
viously. In all 4 studies, patients were treated according to pre-2000
resuscitation guidelines, which differ considerably from current prac-
tice. As a result, all 4 studies were downgraded for indirectness.
Bretylium versus placebo
One RCT comparing bretylium with placebo in 29 patients showed,
with very low certainty, no statistically significant difference in survival
to hospital discharge [42]. The quality of this evidence was down-
graded because of concerns about risk of bias, indirectness, and im-
precision. The risk of bias resulted from uncertainties about sequence
generation, allocation concealment, and blinding of participants. The
risk of indirectness was noted because resuscitation practice at the time
of patient enrollment (well before 2000) differed substantially from
current practice. The wide CIs around the point estimates, the number
of events, and a sample size that did not meet the optimal information
size criteria resulted in the downgrade for imprecision.
Lidocaine versus bretylium
Two RCTs comparing lidocaine with bretylium in 237 patients
showed, with very low certainty, no statistically significant difference
in survival to hospital discharge or ROSC [43,44]. The quality of this
evidence was downgraded because of concerns about risk of bias, in-
directness, and imprecision. The risk of bias resulted from uncertainties
about sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding of
participants. The risk of indirectness was present because resuscitation
practice at the time of patient enrollment for both studies (well before
2000) differed substantially from current practice. The wide CIs around
the point estimates, the number of events, and a sample size that did not
meet the optimal information size criteria resulted in the downgrade for
imprecision.
Amiodarone versus nifekalant
One controlled trial comparing amiodarone with nifekalant in 30
patients (enrolled 2007–2009) showed, with very low certainty, no
statistically significant difference in survival to hospital discharge with
good neurological outcome, survival to hospital discharge, or ROSC
[45]. The quality of this evidence was downgraded because of concerns
about risk of bias and imprecision. The risk of bias resulted from con-
cerns about sequence generation and allocation concealment and un-
certainties about blinding of participants and outcome assessors. The
wide CIs around the point estimates, the number of events, and a
sample size that did not meet the optimal information size criteria re-
sulted in the downgrade for imprecision.
Lidocaine versus nifekalant
One controlled trial comparing lidocaine with nifekalant showed,
with very low certainty, no statistically significant difference in survival
to hospital discharge (n = 28) or ROSC (n = 22) [46]. The quality of
this evidence was downgraded because of concerns about risk of bias,
imprecision, and indirectness. The risk of bias resulted from concerns
about sequence generation and allocation concealment, uncertainties
about blinding of participants and outcome assessors, and incomplete
reporting of outcomes. The imprecision resulted from the fact that the
sample size for survival to hospital discharge did not meet the optimal
J. Soar et al.

5
 information size criteria, and the effect estimate could not be de-
termined because there were no survivors in either arm. For the out-
come of ROSC, the CIs around the point estimates were wide, and the
sample size was too small. The study was downgraded for indirectness
because at the time of study enrollment (2001–2004), resuscitation
practice differed substantially from current practice.
Lidocaine versus sotalol
One controlled trial comparing lidocaine with sotalol showed, with
low certainty, no statistically significant difference in survival to hos-
pital discharge with good neurological outcome (n = 129), survival to
hospital discharge (n = 129), or ROSC (n = 129) [47]. The quality of
this evidence was downgraded as a result of concerns about imprecision
because the CIs around the point estimates were wide, because of the
number of events, and because the sample size did not meet the optimal
information size criteria. The study was downgraded for indirectness
because the study enrolled patients before publication of the 2005
ILCOR CoSTR and council guidelines recommendations that resulted in
substantial alterations in resuscitation practice.
Treatment recommendations
We suggest the use of amiodarone or lidocaine in adults with shock-
refractory VF/pVT (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).
We suggest against the routine use of magnesium in adults with
shock-refractory VF/pVT (weak recommendation, very low-quality
evidence).
The confidence in effect estimates is currently too low to support an
ALS Task Force recommendation about the use of bretylium, nifekalant,
or sotalol in the treatment of adults in cardiac arrest with shock-re-
fractory VF/pVT.
The confidence in effect estimates is currently too low to support an
ALS Task Force recommendation about the use of prophylactic antiar-
rhythmic drugs immediately after ROSC in adults with VF/pVT cardiac
arrest.
Values and preferences and ALS Task Force insights
In making these recommendations, the ALS Task Force considered
the following.
Amiodarone or lidocaine
We considered the predefined and reported bystander-witnessed
arrest subgroup (n = 1934) analysis of the ROC-ALPS study [7] that
showed a significant improvement with an antiarrhythmic drug for the
critical outcome of survival to hospital discharge. Specifically, survival
was higher with amiodarone (27.7%) or lidocaine (27.8%) than with
placebo (22.7%). This absolute RD was significant for amiodarone
(5.0%; 95% CI, 0.3–9.7; P = 0.04) or lidocaine (RD, 5.2%; 95% CI,
0.5–9.9; P = 0.03) compared with placebo but not for amiodarone
compared with lidocaine (RD, −0.1%; 95% CI, −5.1 to 4.9; P = 0.97).
The survival to hospital discharge in the ROC-ALPS trial was also
higher among amiodarone recipients than placebo recipients in the
emergency medical services–witnessed arrest subgroup (n = 154) [7].
Survival was higher with amiodarone (38.6%) than with placebo
(16.7%). This was associated with earlier drug use: The time from
cardiac arrest to the first dose of trial drug was 11.7 ± 5.8 minutes for
those with emergency medical services–witnessed arrest versus a time
from 9-1-1 call to the first study drug of 19.3 ± 7.1 minutes for those
with non–emergency medical services–witnessed cardiac arrest.
We did not identify any RCTs comparing outcomes of amiodarone or
lidocaine for IHCA. We acknowledge that drug delivery during re-
suscitation is typically much earlier in the inpatient setting [49,50],
raising the possibility that these drugs may be beneficial for the IHCA
population. However, we also acknowledge that there is a lack of RCT
data for IHCA.
In making a weak recommendation, we considered the reported
small increase in the short-term outcome of ROSC in those treated with
amiodarone in the 1999 ARREST study [36] and in those treated with
lidocaine in the 2016 ROC-ALPS study [7]. Neither drug was associated
with a difference in the longer-term outcomes that were ranked as
critical: survival or good neurological survival to hospital discharge.
The systematic review identified no data on the outcomes of health-
related quality of life or burdens and costs of treatment.
The ALS Task Force recognizes that the selected values for outcomes
(we ranked ROSC as an important outcome) may not be the same as
those that patients and families would choose. It is possible that pa-
tients who will not survive to hospital discharge and their families may
value patient ROSC because it may provide family members with some
preparation time before a final declaration of death. This is a knowl-
edge gap. Patients, families, and society may also place a value on
ROSC that is based on the possibility of organ donation and the con-
tinued support needed to enable organ donation. The task force also
recognizes that ROSC may lead to an increased burden on healthcare
systems if patients do not survive to hospital discharge.
In ROC-ALPS [7], there was no difference between amiodarone and
lidocaine in survival or good neurological outcome at hospital dis-
charge, and the task force made the same weak recommendation for
both amiodarone and lidocaine. In the 2015 CoSTR [5,6], the quality of
the evidence favoring amiodarone was rated as moderate, whereas the
quality of the evidence for lidocaine was rated as very low.
Given the high-quality evidence for improved ROSC with lidocaine
from the ROC-ALPS [7], the task force considered giving a stronger
recommendation for lidocaine than amiodarone. However, the lack of
difference for critical outcomes (survival and survival with favorable
neurological outcome on hospital discharge) between the drugs led the
task force to assign the same level of recommendation and quality of
evidence for both drugs.
We considered the differences between the 2 RCTs with amiodarone
versus placebo (ie, the ARREST trial [36] and the ROC-ALPS trial [7])
and the 2 RCTs with amiodarone versus lidocaine (ie, the ALIVE trial
[37] and the ROC-ALPS trial [7]). We discussed the benefits of pooling
data versus keeping the studies separate in the systematic review and
meta-analyses. The benefits of increasing precision of an estimate of
effect were weighed against the detrimental effects of combining dis-
tinctly different studies. We have provided pooled estimates based on
combining studies and analyzed those from the individual studies. The
following issues with the ARREST study [36] and ROC-ALPS [7] trial
were considered for the amiodarone versus placebo comparison:
1. The ARREST study included patients with VF/pVT at any stage in
the resuscitation attempt who had received 3 shocks. In comparison,
the ROC-ALPS study included only those with an initial arrest
rhythm of VF/pVT who had received at least 1 shock. The actual
number of shocks given before the trial drug in the ARREST study
was a mean of 5 (SD, ± 2; median, 4) and in the ROC-ALPS study
was a median of 3 (interquartile range, 2–4).
2. The ARREST study used an amiodarone in polysorbate 80 prepara-
tion and compared it with a polysorbate 80 placebo. The potential
effects of polysorbate 80 are debated: It may have hemodynamic
effects (possible transient hypotension), so there is a possibility that
the control was harmed by an active placebo. The task force did not
identify any human or animal studies comparing the effects of
polysorbate 80 with 0.9% sodium chloride during CPR for shock-
refractory VF/pVT. The effect of polysorbate 80 on the outcomes of
the ARREST study is therefore unknown.
3. The ROC-ALPS trial used the Nexterone formulation of amiodarone
and an inactive placebo (0.9% sodium chloride). Nexterone is a
newer formulation of amiodarone that uses the diluent Captisol (a
sulfobutyl ether β-cyclodextrin) instead of polysorbate 80.
4. There were considerable changes in the management of refractory
VF/pVT between the time of patient enrollment in the ARREST trial
J. Soar et al.
Resuscitation xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx
6
 (1994–1997) and the time of patient enrollment in the ROC-ALPS
trial (2013–2015). Many of the practices used in the ARREST study
(published in 1999 with patients enrolled 1994–1997) were con-
sistent
with
recommendations
in
the
1992
American
Heart
Association “Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and
Emergency Cardiac Care,” [51] including initial delivery of 2 slow
rescue breaths and a pause for pulse check before initiation of chest
compressions, recommended compression depth of 1.5 to 2 in
(4–5 cm) at rate of 80 to 100 per minute, use of a compression-
ventilation ratio of 15:2, use of monophasic defibrillators to deliver
up to 3 stacked shocks without intervening compressions, use of
escalating energy levels, and pauses in compressions during char-
ging before shock delivery. By the time patients were enrolled in the
ROC-ALPS trial, ILCOR recommendations and council guidelines
had been revised in 2005 and again in 2010, replacing the 1992
recommendations with new approaches such as delivery of 1 shock
followed by immediate CPR, compression rate of at least 100 per
minute, and other approaches designed to minimize interruptions in
chest compressions as part of the delivery of high-quality CPR.
5. We are unable to ascertain the intention-to-treat population for the
ARREST study and thus can compare only the per-protocol analysis.
The following issues with the ALIVE study [37] were considered for
the amiodarone versus lidocaine comparison:
1. Many of the practices used to manage patients in the ALIVE study
(study published in 2002, patients enrolled 1995–2001) have been
superseded, as noted previously.
2. The ALIVE study included patients with initial VF/ pVT who re-
ceived 3 shocks, adrenaline, and a fourth shock, whereas the ROC-
ALPS trial included those with an initial arrest rhythm of VF/pVT
who received at least 1 shock. The actual number of shocks given
before the trial drug in the ALIVE study was a mean of 5 (SD, ± 2;
median, 4) and in the ROC-ALPS trial was a median of 3 (inter-
quartile range, 2–4).
3. In the ALIVE study, lidocaine was mixed with polysorbate 80 (the
diluent for amiodarone) to improve blinding because polysorbate 80
is viscous. It is unknown whether the addition of polysorbate 80
(with potential hemodynamic effects) to lidocaine adversely af-
fected outcomes in the lidocaine group.
We note that the reported risk of harm associated with amiodarone
or lidocaine use during cardiac arrest was small. Specifically, the ROC-
ALPS trial [7] reported a small increase in the need for temporary pa-
cing in the first 24 hours after ROSC in the amiodarone group compared
with the lidocaine and placebo groups (4.9% versus 3.2% versus 2.7%)
in the per-protocol population (P = 0.02). There was, however, no
difference among patients who received amiodarone, lidocaine, or
placebo in the percent of patients with a poor neurological outcome
(modified Rankin Scale score 4 or 5) at hospital discharge (5.4% for
amiodarone versus 6.1% for lidocaine versus 4.3% for placebo) in the
per-protocol population.
Magnesium
We did not identify any RCTs published since the 2015 CoSTR [5,6]
that evaluated the role of magnesium in the treatment of VF/pVT. The 4
RCTs evaluated in the 2015 CoSTR reported the outcomes of a total of
437 patients [38–41], with the most recent study published in 2002,
which noted that the enrolled patients were treated in a manner con-
sistent with the 1992 European resuscitation guidelines [52]. Two of
these studies included patients who had arrest rhythms other than VF/
pVT [39,40]. In making a suggestion against the routine use of mag-
nesium for refractory VF/pVT cardiac arrest, we recognize that there
are specific circumstances in which magnesium could be considered
during refractory VF/pVT (eg, hypomagnesemia, torsades de pointes).
Bretylium, nifekalant, and sotalol
In making no recommendation about the use of bretylium, nifeka-
lant,
or
sotalol,
we
considered
guidance
from
the
Grading
of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation hand-
book [53]. We recognize that bretylium is not available in most settings
for clinical use and is not part of current council guidelines inter-
nationally. We did not identify any RCTs that compared nifekalant with
a placebo. We identified only the single very small RCT with 30 patients
that compared amiodarone with nifekalant [45] and another very small
RCT with 28 patients that compared lidocaine with nifekalant [46].
Sotalol is not part of current council guidelines internationally.
The role of β-blocker drugs during and after cardiac arrest remains a
knowledge gap. The ILCOR member resuscitation councils can best
determine whether to recommend any change in current practice con-
cerning these drugs.
Prophylactic use of antiarrhythmic drugs immediately after ROSC
We did not identify any RCTs for the prophylactic use of antiar-
rhythmic drugs in patients during the first hour after ROSC following a
VF/pVT cardiac arrest, and we have identified this as a knowledge gap.
No recommendation was made for or against prophylactic antiar-
rhythmic drugs after ROSC in the 2015 CoSTR [5,6], after analysis of 2
observational studies [54,55], and we have not identified any addi-
tional evidence to support a recommendation.
Additional peer-reviewed evidence and additional ALS Task Force insights
We identified 1 additional RCT that met our inclusion criteria [56].
This RCT of subjects experiencing OHCA compared amiodarone, lido-
caine, and saline placebo for patients with an initial nonshockable
rhythm that later transitioned to a shockable rhythm. This study was
underpowered for the primary end point of survival to hospital dis-
charge.
Finally, the ALS Task Force recognizes that all the currently avail-
able RCTs are underpowered to detect any small effect sizes of antiar-
rhythmic drugs that could lead to many more survivors. For example, a
1% absolute increase in survival from OHCA with an antiarrhythmic
drug could lead to ≈600 additional survivors in North America each
year [7]. To detect these small differences for critical outcomes (sur-
vival to discharge and good neurological survival) requires very large
RCTs (tens of thousands of patients), and these may not be feasible. In
the absence of large RCTs, combining data by using approaches such as
network meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses of the meta-analyses
and by using data from large observational studies or large registries in
addition to RCTs could potentially overcome the shortcomings (in-
adequately powered RCTs, study quality, changes in resuscitation
technique over time) in the evidence reviewed for this CoSTR.
ALS Task Force knowledge gaps
Current knowledge gaps for the use of antiarrhythmic drugs in adult
refractory VF/pVT include but are not limited to the following:
• For VF/pVT cardiac arrest, do antiarrhythmic drugs improve pa-
tient-centered outcomes (survival with good neurological outcome,
health-related quality of life), and do the outcomes differ within or
across specific populations (OHCA or IHCA) or conditions (eg, wit-
nessed arrest, monitored arrest, bystander CPR, number of shocks,
CPR quality)?
• Does the use of epinephrine (adrenaline) affect the effectiveness of
antiarrhythmic drugs during CPR for VF/pVT cardiac arrest and, if
so, how?
• Is the use of multiple antiarrhythmic drugs (eg, amiodarone fol-
lowed by lidocaine) more effective than the use of a single drug
during CPR for VF/pVT cardiac arrest?
J. Soar et al.
Resuscitation xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx

 • Is there a difference in effectiveness between intravenous and in-
traosseous antiarrhythmic drug administration during CPR for VF/
pVT cardiac arrest, and does the intraosseous site (humeral, tibial,
other) make a difference?
• Does nifekalant improve critical outcomes compared with placebo
or alternative antiarrhythmic drugs during CPR for VF/pVT cardiac
arrest?
• Does treatment with prophylactic antiarrhythmic drugs (including
β-blockers) given immediately after ROSC improve outcome fol-
lowing VF/pVT cardiac arrest?
Use of antiarrhythmic drugs in infants and children with VF/pVT
cardiac arrest
Consensus on science
Previous CoSTR statements evaluating the use of antiarrhythmic
drugs during pediatric VF/pVT cardiac arrest, including the 2015
ILCOR Pediatric CoSTR [57,58], have included extrapolated evidence
from adult OHCA studies and case series of children with life-threa-
tening ventricular arrhythmias but not cardiac arrest. The ILCOR Pe-
diatric Task Force concluded the 2015 review with a weak re-
commendation suggesting that amiodarone or lidocaine may be used
for the treatment of pediatric shock-resistant VF/pVT (weak re-
commendation, very low-quality evidence) [57,58].
The Pediatric Task Force agreed that this 2018 ILCOR CoSTR would
not review evidence extrapolated from studies of adult cardiac arrest.
Any such extrapolation would result in very low-quality evidence as a
consequence of indirectness because, regardless of location, the causes
and presentation of children in cardiac arrest differ substantially from
the causes and presentation of adults in cardiac arrest. When the initial
pediatric cardiac arrest rhythm is VF/pVT, the infant or child often has
congenital heart disease, inherited arrhythmia syndromes, commotio
cordis, or cardiomyopathies that can influence presentation, treatment,
and response to therapy. Subsequent VF/pVT can develop after pedia-
tric resuscitation from an initial bradyasystolic arrest rhythm that is
typically associated with hypoxic/asphyxial arrest in children with
preexisting shock or respiratory failure. In contrast, adult cardiac arrest
with VF/pVT is often sudden, precipitated by acute coronary artery
obstruction and myocardial ischemia [59].
For this 2018 update, there were no additional pediatric studies
beyond the single study that formed the basis of the 2015 CoSTR. This
study consists of data from an observational cohort of infants and
children with IHCA from the Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation
registry [30]. For this 2018 CoSTR, the Pediatric Task Force rereviewed
this study by using the current ILCOR systematic review process and the
2018 PICO question to determine whether amiodarone or lidocaine,
administered in any setting (OHCA or IHCA) at any time during re-
suscitation or within 1 hour after ROSC, was associated with improve-
ment in the critical outcomes of survival to hospital discharge with
good neurological outcome or survival to hospital discharge or the
important outcome of ROSC or decreased rearrest after ROSC. The re-
view identified no data on the use of antiarrhythmics to guide re-
commendations for pediatric OHCA.
For the critical outcome of survival to hospital discharge, the task
force analyzed the single observational cohort study with 302 patients
[30]. This cohort study was downgraded for lack of a control, in-
directness (ie, patients were enrolled during an 8-year period of
2000–2008; in the years 2000–2005, international recommendations
for CPR and pediatric ALS differed substantially from current practice),
risk of bias (ie, from a voluntary registry), and imprecision (ie, timing of
drug administration and adverse events were not reported). This study
found no difference in effect for lidocaine compared with amiodarone
(25% versus 17%; P = NS; relative risk, 1.50; 95% CI, 0.90–2.52); there
were 84 survivors per 1000 patients treated (range, < 17 to > 256, no
statistically significant effect) [30].
For the important outcome of ROSC, in the same in-hospital ob-
servational study with 302 patients (quality downgraded as noted
previously), ROSC was associated with a higher percentage of the
children who received lidocaine than those who received amiodarone
(64% versus 44%; P = 0.004; relative risk, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.13–1.88),
202 more per 1000 treated (range, 57–386; number needed to treat, 5;
95% CI, 3–18) [30].
Treatment recommendations
We suggest that amiodarone or lidocaine be used in the treatment of
pediatric shock-refractory VF/pVT (weak recommendation, very low-
quality evidence).
Values and preferences and Pediatric Task Force insights
In making this recommendation, the task force considered the fol-
lowing.
We placed a higher value on the use of in-hospital pediatric registry
data over extrapolation of data from studies of adult cardiac arrest.
Although 3 adult RCTs compared lidocaine, amiodarone, and placebo,
the populations studied are substantially different from both pediatric
(prepubertal) and adolescent populations. The adult studies were
heavily populated by subjects > 50 years of age and specifically ex-
cluded patients < 18 years of age. In addition, the pediatric and adult
studies do not consistently distinguish between primary and subsequent
VF and their outcomes on the basis of drug therapies. The distinction
between initial and subsequent VF is an important one because pedia-
tric survival from subsequent VF is much lower than the survival from
initial VF/pVT [28,30]. Although the causes of IHCA and OHCA in
children may differ, the task force feels that extrapolation of pediatric
IHCA data to pediatric OHCA is reasonable.
The task force has low confidence in the quality of the data from the
single study available for analysis [30]. This study included patients
enrolled before the publication of the 2005 CoSTR and council guide-
lines. The 2005 guidelines differed considerably from previous re-
commendations, with new emphasis on minimizing interruptions in
chest compressions as part of overall high CPR quality to improve re-
suscitation outcomes.
The task force chose the critical and important outcomes for this
review on the basis of outcomes available in the literature and accep-
table outcomes in the discipline. Longer-term outcomes, particularly
functional outcomes, are more desirable but are not available at this
time. Furthermore, patient-centric outcomes may differ from those of
the task force. Patients and families may place a higher value on short-
term ROSC to give family members time to prepare for the child's death
or for organ donation. In addition, the patient and family may value
survival, even with moderate neurological disability, over death.
Pediatric Task Force knowledge gaps
• Do antiarrhythmic drugs improve outcomes (including patient- and
family-centered outcomes) from pediatric OHCA or IHCA with VF/
pVT? Do these drugs improve survival in specific populations of
infants and children or under specific conditions?
• Does the timing of antiarrhythmic drug administration with respect
to defibrillation or epinephrine influence drug effectiveness?
• Is there a difference in antiarrhythmic effectiveness and adverse
events based on the cause of the arrest (eg, channelopathy versus
structural heart disease versus ischemia versus drug overdose) or for
the treatment of initial versus subsequent VF/pVT?
• Does the use of antiarrhythmic drugs influence the cost-effective-
ness, health equity, or resource requirements for infants and chil-
dren who develop cardiac arrest with VF/pVT?
