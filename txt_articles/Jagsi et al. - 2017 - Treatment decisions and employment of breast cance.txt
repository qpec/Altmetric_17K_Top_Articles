BACKGROUND: Many patients with breast cancer work for pay at the time of their diagnosis, and the treatment plan may threaten
their livelihood. Understanding work experiences in a contemporary population-based sample is necessary to inform initiatives to
reduce the burden of cancer care. METHODS: Women who were 20 to 79 years old and had been diagnosed with stage 0 to II breast
cancer, as reported to the Georgia and Los Angeles Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries in 2014-2015, were
surveyed. Of the 3672 eligible women, 2502 responded (68%); 1006 who reported working before their diagnosis were analyzed.
Multivariate models evaluated correlates of missing work for >1 month and stopping work altogether versus missing work for �1
month. RESULTS: In this diverse sample, most patients (62%) underwent lumpectomy; 16% underwent unilateral mastectomy
(8% with reconstruction); and 23% underwent bilateral mastectomy (19% with reconstruction). One-third (33%) received chemother-
apy. Most (84%) worked full-time before their diagnosis; however, only 50% had paid sick leave, 39% had disability benefits, and 38%
had flexible work schedules. Surgical treatment was strongly correlated with missing >1 month of work (odds ratio [OR] for bilateral
mastectomy with reconstruction vs lumpectomy, 7.8) and with stopping work altogether (OR for bilateral mastectomy with recon-
struction vs lumpectomy, 3.1). Chemotherapy receipt (OR for missing >1 month, 1.3; OR for stopping work altogether, 3.9) and race
(OR for missing >1 month for blacks vs whites, 2.0; OR for stopping work altogether for blacks vs whites, 1.7) also correlated.
Those with paid sick leave were less likely to stop working (OR, 0.5), as were those with flexible schedules (OR, 0.3). CONCLUSIONS:
Working patients who received more aggressive treatments were more likely to experience substantial employment disruptions.

INTRODUCTION
Work is an important source of income, insurance, and social interactions and may be particularly important for individu-
als with cancer, who may also find that it gives meaning to life, provides a welcome distraction, and improves their quality
of life.1,2 Unfortunately, a diagnosis of cancer and its treatment can disrupt patient employment, particularly during active
therapy but also in its aftermath. Treatment plans are burdensome and exact a heavy toll on all aspects of quality of life,
including physical functioning and emotional well-being, with protracted recovery times in some cases. Financial toxicity,
which can develop in part because of lost income, is an important yet understudied potential threat to patient and family
quality of life after diagnosis.
Prior research regarding the impact of a diagnosis of breast cancer and its treatment on employment experiences has
yielded variable results, with some studies suggesting a limited impact but others suggesting substantial and lasting
effects.3-7 The divergence of prior study results may be explained in part by differences in study settings and population

 characteristics, the wide variations in relevant policies and
cultures in different nations, and changes in treatments
offered over time.
Our own prior work has shown that many patients
with breast cancer are working for pay at the time of their
diagnosis, that most women with breast cancer who are
working for pay before their diagnosis lose work time dur-
ing treatment, and that many stop working altogether.5,6
Furthermore, a loss of paid work during treatment can
result in permanent and undesirable long-term unem-
ployment.7 Thus, it is critical that treatments be no more
burdensome than necessary and delivered in ways that
minimize disruption for patients.
The growing awareness of the burden of cancer treat-
ment is sparking initiatives to reduce it. The use of chemo-
therapy for early-stage breast cancer is increasingly more
selective,8 and increased attention to symptom control and
management may be reducing avoidable morbidity in those
who do receive treatment.9 In contrast, trends in surgical
management may be increasing patient morbidity; for
example, bilateral mastectomy, usually with breast recon-
struction, is being increasingly used for patients with unilat-
eral cancer.10 However, at the same time, there are trends
toward less extensive surgery, such as decreased re-exci-
sion11 and use of axillary dissection after lumpectomy.
Thus, there is a growing dichotomy in surgical manage-
ment with a major potential impact on patient recovery
from treatment. It is essential that we understand how this
rapidly evolving treatment context may affect the employ-
ment of women diagnosed with breast cancer.
Policies regarding employment support for patients
with cancer have also evolved in light of the growing rec-
ognition of the importance of these issues,12,13 and this
further motivates the need to examine the impact of treat-
ment on the employment of patients diagnosed in the
United States today. In this transformed landscape of
public policy, medical evidence, and treatment options,
we sought to document patterns and correlates of missed
work in a contemporary population-based sample of
women recently diagnosed with breast cancer, with a par-
ticular focus on associations of employment experiences
with the primary surgical treatment selected, to inform
initiatives for supporting patients with cancer in their
treatment decisions and transitions to survivorship.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Sample and Data Collection
After institutional review board approval, including a
waiver of signed informed consent, we selected women
aged 20 to 79 years and diagnosed with stage 0 to II breast
cancer who had been reported to the Surveillance, Epide-
miology, and End Results (SEER) registries of Georgia
and Los Angeles County. Eligible patients were identified
via pathology reports from “definitive” surgical proce-
dures (those intended to remove the tumor with clear
margins) in 2014-2015. Black, Asian, and Hispanic
women were oversampled in Los Angeles with a previ-
ously described approach.14 The questionnaire content
was developed with a conceptual framework, research
questions, and hypotheses. We developed measures draw-
ing from the literature and our prior research. We assessed
content validity, including a systematic review by design
experts, cognitive pretesting with patients, and pilot stud-
ies in clinic populations.15
Data Collection
Patient surveys were mailed with a $20 cash incentive (see
online supporting information); a modified Dillman
method was used, including reminders sent to nonres-
pondents.16 All materials were in English. We added
Spanish-translated materials for all women with surnames
suggesting Hispanic ethnicity. Survey responses were
merged with SEER data. The median time from diagnosis
to survey completion was 7 months.
Measures
As part of a larger questionnaire that evaluated patients’
treatment decisions and experiences after the diagnosis of
breast cancer, we asked patients whether they worked for
pay before their breast cancer diagnosis and what their
employment status was (employed full-time, employed
part-time, unemployed and looking for work, temporarily
laid off or on sick or other leave, disabled, retired, student,
or homemaker). We limited our analytic sample for the
current study to those who reported working either full-
time or part-time before their diagnosis.
Our primary dependent variable of interest was
patient-reported missed work (ie, days missed because of
breast cancer or its treatment); the response options were
none, less than a week, 7 to 14 days, 15 to 30 days, more
than a month, and stopped working altogether. We then
categorized these for analysis as we did in our prior work
using this measure: missed 0 to 30 days, missed >30 days,
or stopped working altogether.5
Independent variables included patients’ clinical,
treatment, sociodemographic, and employment-related
characteristics. All of these were measured by self-report
except for the tumor stage, which was taken from SEER
registry data. Specifically, the clinical factors that we
Original Article

 considered were age (measured continuously and catego-
rized as �50, >50 to 65, or >65 to 79 years), stage
(American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 0, I, or II),
patient-reported comorbidities (the presence of 1 or more
medical comorbidities derived from a list pertinent to can-
cer patients), and overall health status (categorized as
excellent, good, fair, or poor). Treatment factors included
chemotherapy receipt, radiotherapy receipt, axillary sur-
gery (dichotomized as axillary lymph node dissection vs
sentinel node biopsy alone or no surgical nodal interven-
tion), and the type of breast surgery received (categorized
as lumpectomy, unilateral mastectomy without recon-
struction, unilateral mastectomy with reconstruction,
bilateral mastectomy without reconstruction, or bilateral
mastectomy with reconstruction). Sociodemographic fea-
tures included the following: race/ethnicity (non-His-
panic white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian,
Latina, or other), educational attainment (high school or
less, some college or technical school, or college graduate),
household income (<$40,000, $40,000-$89,999, or
�$90,000), number of people supported by the patient’s
income, and marital status (married or partnered vs not
married or partnered). Employment-related characteris-
tics included the following: self-reported full-time status
versus part-time status, work hours (1-35, 36-44, or �45
h/wk), paid sick leave, disability benefits, flexible work
schedule, and geographic site (Los Angeles vs Georgia).
In addition, we inquired, “Since your breast cancer
diagnosis, how much money (income) have you lost due
to time off from work?” The response options were $0, $1
to $500, $501 to $2000, $2001 to $5000, $5001 to
$10,000, and >$10,000.
Statistical Analyses
After limiting the study sample to those who had been
working before their diagnosis, we described the study
sample and its characteristics by the amount of missed
work (work missed for 0-30 days, work missed for >30
days, or work stopped altogether). Next, we constructed a
multivariate multinomial logistic regression model of the
missed work outcome, and we used 0 to 30 days as the ref-
erence category. Independent variables included all of the
clinical, treatment, sociodemographic, and employment-
related characteristics listed previously except for work
hours (to avoid collinearity with a self-reported full-time
status versus a part-time status). The multivariate analysis
used listwise deletion for all missing data; less than 3% of
the cases were excluded because of missing data. Finally,
we described the amount of lost income by the amount of
missed work and made comparisons with the chi-square
test. Using the midpoints of the ranges for the survey
questions on household income and income lost because
of time off work, we also estimated the percentage of
annual income lost. Analyses were conducted with SAS
9.4, and P values < .05 were considered significant.
Survey design and nonresponse weights were used in
all analyses to compensate for the differential probability
of selecting patients and survey nonresponse.17 All percen-
tages and odds ratios (ORs) reported herein are weighted,
and the numbers of participants, when provided, are
unweighted for clarity. Because of the low levels of item
nonresponse, complete case methods were used; analyses
of data using multiply imputed data (not shown) were
consistent with the results that we report here.
RESULTS
As shown in Figure 1, of the 3930 women diagnosed in
2014-2015 whom we initially selected for our sample on
the basis of rapid case ascertainment (which allows earlier
survey administration by reducing the time lag from diag-
nosis to case identification),18 258 were subsequently
found to be ineligible because they had a prior breast can-
cer diagnosis or stage III to IV disease; resided outside the
SEER registry area; or were deceased, too ill, or unable to
complete a survey in Spanish or English. Of the 3672 eli-
gible women remaining, 1170 could not be contacted or
did not participate, and this left 2502 respondents (68%).
Of these women, we considered the 1006 who reported
that they had been working before their diagnosis for fur-
ther analysis in this study.
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the analytic sam-
ple, which was racially and ethnically diverse (48% were
white, 19% were black, 20% were Latina, and 11% were

 Asian). Most patients (62%) underwent lumpectomy,
16% underwent unilateral mastectomy (8% with recon-
struction), and 23% underwent bilateral mastectomy
(19% with reconstruction). One-third (33%) received
chemotherapy. The vast majority (84%) reported working
full-time before their diagnosis; however, only half (50%)
had jobs that allowed for paid sick leave, 39% had disabil-
ity benefits, and 38% had a flexible work schedule.
Bivariate associations between employment experi-
ences and patient characteristics are provided in Support-
ing Table 1 (see online supporting information). In a
multivariate analysis including treatment and clinical fac-
tors alone, several factors were significantly correlated
with missing more than a month of work or stopping
work altogether versus missing up to 30 days (Table 2).
Those with poorer health (vs excellent health) were overall
less likely (P < .001) to miss work (OR for stopping work
altogether, 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-5.1).
Chemotherapy receipt also correlated with stopping work
(OR for missing >1 month, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2; OR for
stopping work altogether, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.6-5.8). Surgical
treatment was strongly correlated with missing >1 month
of work (OR for bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction
vs lumpectomy, 7.8; 95% CI, 4.5-13.4) and with stop-
ping work altogether (OR for bilateral mastectomy with
reconstruction vs lumpectomy, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.6-5.9).
Race was correlated with missed work (P 5 .01). For
blacks versus whites, the OR was 2.0 for missing more
than 1 month (95% CI, 1.3-3.2) and 1.7 for stopping
work altogether (95% CI, 1.1-2.8). Those with paid sick

 household income (OR for stopping work for the highest
income group [income � $90,000], 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3-
1), and the number supported by the family income
(with those whose household income supported �4 per-
sons being less likely to stop working altogether: OR,
0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8). Notably, 7% of the patients
(13% of those receiving radiotherapy) were still receiving
radiotherapy at the time of the survey; excluding these
patients did not affect the significance of any covariates
in the model.
Figure 2 shows adjusted rates of missed work by sur-
gical treatment received. Patients undergoing lumpec-
tomy were far less likely to miss more than a month of
work or stop working altogether in comparison with
women undergoing mastectomy.
Those who missed more work also reported losing
greater amounts of income because of time off work since
their breast cancer diagnosis (P < .001), as shown in
Table 3. Specifically, among those who missed 0 to 30
days, 74% lost $0 to $500, and only 6% lost >$5000.
Among those who missed >30 days, 40% lost $0 to $500,
and 29% lost >$5000. Among those who stopped work-
ing altogether, 17% lost $0 to $500, and 54% lost
>$5000. The median patient reported losing 3.6% of her
annual household income because of time off work, and
19% of the patients reported losing 10% or more of their
annual household income
Of the women in our analytic sample, all of whom
had been employed before their diagnosis, 65% reported
that their current employment status at the time of the
survey was full-time employment, 15% reported part-
time employment (including 38 of the 844 women who
had been working full-time before their diagnosis), 3%
were unemployed and looking for work, 6% were tempo-
rarily laid off or on sick or other leave, 4% were disabled,
4% were retired, 1% were students, and 2% were
homemakers.
DISCUSSION
In this large, modern, and diverse cohort of patients newly
diagnosed with breast cancer, we observed striking varia-
tions in the rates of missed work by the type of surgery
received along with findings consistent with prior research
regarding the impact of chemotherapy, sociodemographic
factors, and the employment context. These findings are
important because never before have women with breast
cancer faced such a wide range of choices for surgical man-
agement, nor has the dichotomy in surgical treatment
options been more dramatic. Some women receive breast
conservation, whereas others receive bilateral mastectomy
for exactly the same condition, often also with reconstruc-
tion. Understanding the employment effects of different

ment. This figure depicts marginal probabilities of missed work
by surgical treatment. The probabilities were derived from a
multivariate model adjusted for age, stage, comorbidities,
health status, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, axillary lymph node
dissection, race, education, marital status, geographic site,
employment status, job benefits, income, and household size,
and they were weighted to reflect sampling and response

 surgical decisions is critically important to the many
patients who consider surgical treatments more aggressive
than medically necessary to treat their cancer. Surgeons
who treat patients with breast cancer can now provide
compelling evidence that women who undergo mastec-
tomy experience considerably higher risks of missed work
than those who receive breast-conserving therapy. More-
over, the current data allow quantification of the financial
impact of this missed work, and these data may be very
useful in helping patients understand the full impact of
treatment decisions.
Strikingly, the magnitude of the risk to employ-
ment with more aggressive surgery observed in this study
was similar to the risks associated with chemotherapy,
which has traditionally been the major target of efforts to
reduce the burden of cancer care. Indeed, most prior
studies of the immediate treatment impact on breast can-
cer patients’ employment have focused on chemother-
apy.19,20 Several studies have suggested that patients who
receive chemotherapy are most likely to experience dis-
ruptions in employment21 and prolonged absences.22
Although evidence has been more mixed regarding the
long-term effects of treatment on employment, with
some studies suggesting that breast cancer treatment and
particularly adjuvant chemotherapy might not delay or
prevent the ultimate return to work,3,4 there is reason to
believe that the adverse effects of chemotherapy on
employment may be long-lasting. In our group’s prior
work, adjuvant chemotherapy receipt was associated
with long-term job loss among survivors at 4 years, and
many of these women were actively seeking employment;
this suggests that this was involuntary.7 Women who
lacked employment support (sick leave or flexible hours)
were most vulnerable. Studies in other settings, includ-
ing ones with greater employment support, have also
documented greater rates of job discontinuation or
decreased work time among breast cancer survivors who
received chemotherapy.23 Moreover, recent research has
highlighted how certain women, including those with
low incomes, may be particularly vulnerable to the risk
of not returning to work in the months and years after
treatment.24
As Hassett et al21 noted in relevant prior work, these
findings “reinforce the need to assess the impact of treat-
ments, especially new treatments, on patient-centered
outcomes such as employment.” Notably, at the time of
most prior studies, rates of mastectomy overall were con-
siderably lower than those in the current era, and bilateral
mastectomy was rarely used, so it was not evaluated sepa-
rately from unilateral mastectomy in terms of its impact
on employment. However, in recent years, in the wake of
celebrity disclosures and growing patient interest, rates of
mastectomy overall and particularly in combination with
contralateral prophylactic mastectomy have surged: more
than 1 in 5 patients in the current sample of working
patients had undergone bilateral mastectomy. Although
some women with early-stage breast cancer are not candi-
dates for breast conservation, most are. Therefore, it is
crucial to ensure that patients are fully informed of the
risks of treatment, including the potential for its impact
on employment (a critical component of financial toxic-
ity), to optimize the true goals of shared decision making.
With the growing use of mastectomy, further research is
necessary to monitor whether the short-term impact of
more aggressive surgery that was observed in the current
study will also translate into longer term consequences for
these women’s employment and well-being.
Prior research has emphasized the importance of
workplace accommodations in promoting a return to
work.25,26 In our current study, flexible work arrange-
ments were associated with substantial decreases in miss-
ing more than 30 days of work or stopping altogether,
although disability benefits were found to have the con-
verse association; this suggests that some missed work may
reflect the ability of a patient to take the time that she
needs to recover. Nevertheless, even after we had
accounted for flexibility and other workplace policies,
treatments and particularly more aggressive surgery had a
strong effect that merits note.
Although our study has numerous strengths, includ-
ing its large and recent sample drawn from population-
based registries, it also has limitations that merit consider-
ation. First, as in any observational study, correlation may
not imply causation. Still, there is little reason to believe
that those who selected more aggressive treatments were
predisposed to missing or stopping work after adjust-
ments for multiple sociodemographic and employment
factors. Second, not all missed work is necessarily con-
cerning; voluntary time off might benefit patients by giv-
ing them a chance to cope with their diagnosis and
treatment. Further research is necessary to determine
whether the short-term impact that we observed translates
into long-term challenges, particularly among the youn-
gest patients, with the greatest years of potential employ-
ability, who most often selected the most aggressive
surgical options. Third, this study was intended to assess
associations between treatment and employment out-
comes; therefore, it included only patients diagnosed with
breast cancer and not noncancer patients from the popula-
tion. Although studies evaluating the employment effects

 of a cancer diagnosis in patients versus healthy controls
are important, the inclusion of healthy controls was not
necessary to study the treatment effects that we sought to
evaluate here. Fourth, because patients were surveyed rela-
tively soon after their diagnosis to minimize recall bias, a
minority were still completing adjuvant therapy, and the
full impact of such treatments (particularly radiotherapy)
might not be appreciated because of the timing of the sur-
vey administration. Fifth, to minimize the respondent
burden in the context of a larger study evaluating breast
cancer treatment decisions, only select employment-
related factors were evaluated. We hope to conduct
follow-up research with this cohort as they proceed further
into the survivorship phase; this will allow us to capture
long-term, detailed measures of employment-related con-
structs of importance to patients. Finally, our study was
conducted in 2 large US areas; the results should be gener-
alized with caution to other US settings and not at all to
countries with markedly dissimilar employment support
policies or cultures.
Implications for Clinical Care
Our results show that treatment has a profound effect on
returning to work in the modern era despite improve-
ments in symptom control and changes in social policy.
In addition to policies that further improve employment
support, practical actions by clinicians to reduce the
overuse of aggressive treatments are of critical impor-
tance. In particular, when patients are being counseled
about surgical treatment options, the potential impact
on employment outcomes and the financial impact
quantified in this study merit discussion to ensure that
patients make choices fully informed about potential
consequences.
