Abstract
Background
To determine the validity of the lactate threshold (LT) and maximal oxygen uptake ( _
VO2max)
determined during graded exercise test (GXT) of different durations and using different LT
calculations. Trained male cyclists (n = 17) completed five GXTs of varying stage length (1,
3, 4, 7 and 10 min) to establish the LT, and a series of 30-min constant power bouts to estab-
lish the maximal lactate steady state (MLSS). _
VO2 was assessed during each GXT and a
subsequent verification exhaustive bout (VEB), and 14 different LTs were calculated from
four of the GXTs (3, 4, 7 and 10 min)—yielding a total 56 LTs. Agreement was assessed
between the highest _
VO2 measured during each GXT ( _
VO2peak) as well as between each LT
and MLSS. _
VO2peak and LT data were analysed using mean difference (MD) and intraclass
correlation (ICC).
Results
The _
VO2peak value from GXT1 was 61.0 ± 5.3 mL.kg-1.min-1 and the peak power 420 ± 55 W
(mean ± SD). The power at the MLSS was 264 ± 39 W. _
VO2peak from GXT3, 4, 7, 10 underesti-
mated _
VO2peak by ~1–5 mL.kg-1.min-1. Many of the traditional LT methods were not valid and
a newly developed Modified Dmax method derived from GXT4 provided the most valid esti-
mate of the MLSS (MD = 1.1 W; ICC = 0.96).
Conclusion
The data highlight how GXT protocol design and data analysis influence the determination
of both _
VO2peak and LT. It is also apparent that _
VO2max and LT cannot be determined in a sin-
gle GXT, even with the inclusion of a VEB.

 Introduction
Sampling of expired gas and blood data during a graded exercise test (GXT) to exhaustion per-
mits identification of the gas exchange threshold (GET), the respiratory compensation point
(RCP), the lactate threshold (LT), and maximal oxygen uptake ( _
VO2max). These indices can dis-
tinguish cardiorespiratory fitness, and demarcate the domains of exercise [1, 2] that can be
used to prescribe exercise and to optimize training stimuli [3–6]. However, despite the popu-
larity of these indices, the methods used to determine them can differ substantially and there
has been little systematic investigation of their validity [7–9].
The recommended duration of a GXT to assess _
VO2max is 8 to 12 minutes [10–13]. How-
ever, there is little consensus on an appropriate GXT protocol design, including duration,
stage length, or number of stages, needed to establish the LT. A stage length of at least 3 min-
utes has been recommended [13], although an 8-minute stage length has also been suggested
for blood lactate concentrations to stabilize [14]. The number of stages and GXT duration will
depend on the starting intensity and power increments. Power is typically increased identically
[15], regardless of sex or fitness, leading to a heterogenous GXT duration and number of stages
completed [16]. A customized approach to LT testing has been recommended to ensure a
more homogenous GXT duration [17].
More than 25 methods have been proposed to calculate the LT [18]; these include the
power preceding a rise in blood lactate concentration of more than 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 mmol.L-1
from baseline [19], the onset of a fixed blood lactate accumulation (OBLA) ranging from
2.0 to 4.0 mmol.L-1 [20, 21], or the use of curve fitting procedures such as the Dmax or modi-
fied Dmax methods (ModDmax) [22, 23]. However, many of these ‘accepted’ methods are
influenced by GXT protocol design [8, 24] and their underlying validity has not been
reported.
Assessing the validity of a measurement requires comparison with a criterion measure.
The maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) represents the highest intensity where blood lac-
tate appearance and disappearance is in equilibrium and where energy demand is ade-
quately met by oxidative phosphorylation [25]. Exercise performed above the MLSS
results in accelerated blood lactate appearance and it has therefore been suggested as an
appropriate criterion measure for the LT [25, 26]. The primary advantages of the MLSS
test include its independence of participant effort, it’s submaximal and is reliable [27].
However, the disadvantage is the necessity of multiple laboratory visits and that it yields
only one index of performance.
_
VO2max is considered the “gold standard” for assessing cardiorespiratory fitness [28]
and the highest recorded _
VO2 from a GXT is often accepted as the _
VO2max [10]. Establish-
ing the LT requires a GXT that typically exceeds 20 minutes [13]; however, in these
instances the highest _
VO2 may underestimate the _
VO2max [12] and is termed _
VO2peak.
Recently, the use of a verification exhaustive bout (VEB) has been recommended to con-
firm the _
VO2max. However, it is unknown if a VEB performed after a longer duration GXT
provides a valid estimate of _
VO2max.
The aim of this study was to determine the validity of the LT and _
VO2max derived from a sin-
gle visit GXT. We hypothesized that our results would yield one or more GXT stage length and
LT calculation method combination that provides a valid estimation of the criterion measure
of the LT (i.e., MLSS). We also hypothesized the highest _
VO2 measured during longer duration
GXTs would underestimate _
VO2max and that the highest _
VO2 value measured during each VEB
would be similar to the _
VO2peak measured during the 8- to 12-minute GXT.

 Materials and methods
Ethical approval
All procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional
and/or national research committee, and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later
amendments or comparable ethical standards.
Participants/Experimental design
Seventeen trained male cyclists ( _
VO2max 62.1 ± 5.8 mL.kg-1.min-1, age 36.2 ± 7.4 years, body
mass index (BMI): 24.1 ± 2.0 kg.m-2) volunteered for this study which required 7 to 10 visits to
the laboratory. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the
study.
Visit one included risk stratification using the American College of Sports Medicine Risk
Stratification guidelines [29], written informed consent, self-reported physical activity rating
(PA-R) [30], measurement of height and body mass, and completion of a cycling GXT with
1-minute stages (GXT1) followed by a VEB. The remaining visits consisted of four cycling
GXTs with varying stage length (3-, 4-, 7- and 10-min stages) and a series of 30-min constant
power bouts to establish the MLSS. The GXTs and constant power bouts were performed in an
alternating order and the order of the GXTs was randomised. Prior to each GXT and the con-
stant power bouts a 5-min warm up was administered at a self-selected power followed by 5
min of passive rest. Participants performed each test at their preferred cadence determined
during the initial visit. Antecubital venous blood (1.0 mL) was sampled during all visits
(excluding GXT1) at rest, and at the end of every stage during the GXTs or every 5 min during
the constant power exercise bouts. All participants self-reported abstaining from the consump-
tion of alcohol and caffeine or engaging in heavy exercise 24 h prior to each visit. Participants
were given at least 48 h between visits and all tests were completed within 6 weeks. The Victo-
ria University Human Research Ethics Committee approved all procedures (HRE 017–035).
Equipment/Instruments
All exercise testing was conducted using an electronically-braked cycle ergometer (Lode Excal-
ibur v2.0, The Netherlands). A metabolic analyser (Quark Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing,
Cosmed, Italy) was used to assess oxygen uptake ( _
VO2) on a breath-by-breath basis, and heart
rate was measured throughout all tests. Antecubital venous blood was analysed using a blood
lactate analyser (YSI 2300 STAT Plus, YSI, USA).
GXTs with verification exhaustive bout
Demographic data, PA-R, and measurements of height and body mass were used to estimate
_
VO2max [31] and maximum power output _
Wmax [30, 32].

A custom GXT protocol with a desired time limit of 10 min was then designed for each par-
ticpant using: _
Wmax=10 min = 1-min intensities (W.min-1). Additional customized protocols

 were designed for each of the remaining GXTs based on a percentage of the measured _
Wmax
from GXT1. The predicted _
Wmax was 80%, 77%, 72% and 70% for GXT3, GXT4, GXT7, and
GXT10, respectively. The target number of stages for each participant was nine; the initial stage
and subsequent stages of the remaining GXTs were determined using the following equations:
Stage 1 Power ¼ Predicted _
Wmax � 0:25
Eq 3
Subsequent power increments ¼ ðPredicted _
Wmax � Stage 1Þ=8Þ
Eq 4
where stage 1 power and predicted _
Wmax subsequent power increments are expressed in Watts.
A 5-min recovery was administered after each GXT, followed by a VEB performed at 90%
of _
Wmax measured from GXT1 to measure the highest measured _
VO2 measure ( _
VO2peak) [17].
Constant power exercise bouts to establish the maximal lactate steady state
The power associated with the respiratory compensation point (RCP) from GXT1 was used in
a regression equation (Eq 5) to estimate the MLSS (RCPMLSS) and the first constant power
exercise [33]. The RCP was determined as the average of the power output associated with: 1)
the break point in ventilation relative to expired carbon dioxide ( _
VE= _
VCO2), 2) second break
point in _
VE and 3) the fall in end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) after an apparent steady state
[34–36].
Estimated MLSSðRCPMLSSÞ ¼ 23:329 þ ð0:79127 x RCPÞ
Eq 5
where the RCPMLSS and RCP are expressed in Watts
Participants performed 3 min of baseline cycling at 20 W prior to each constant power
bout. The MLSS was established as the highest intensity where blood lactate increased <1.0
mmol.L-1 from the 10th to the 30th minute [26]. If the blood lactate concentration increased
>1.0 mmol.L-1 the power was decreased by 3%, otherwise the power was increased by 3% [27].
This process continued until the MLSS was obtained.
LT and respiratory compensation point calculations
The LTs were calculated from GXT3,4,7 and 10 using 14 methods (4 GXTs � 14 LTs = 56 LTs in
total), and the RCP and the RCPMLSS were also calculated from GXT1 (56 LTs + RCP and
RCPMLSS = 58 total estimates) (Fig 1):
1. Log-log: The lactate curve was divided into two segments and the intersection point of the
two lines with the lowest residuals sum of squares was taken as the LT [37].
2. OBLA value of 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, or 4.0 mmol.L-1 [1, 24, 38].
3. Baseline + absolute value(s) (B + mmol.L-1): The intensity at which blood lactate concentra-
tion increased 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 mmol.L-1 above baseline value(s) [39, 40].
4. Dmax: The point on the third order polynomial regression curve that yielded the maximum
perpendicular distance to the straight line formed by the two end points of the curve [23].
5. Modified Dmax (ModDmax): The intensity at the point on the third order polynomial regres-
sion curve that yielded the maximal perpendicular distance to the straight line formed by
the point preceding the first rise in blood lactate concentration of >0.4 mmol.L-1 lactate
and the final lactate point [22].

 6. Exponential Dmax (Exp-Dmax): The point on the exponential plus-constant regression curve
that yielded the maximum perpendicular distance to the straight line formed by the two
end points of the curve [41, 42].
7. Log-log Modified Dmax (Log-Poly-ModDmax): The intensity at the point on the third order
polynomial regression curve that yielded the maximal perpendicular distance to the straight
line formed by the intensity associated with the log-log LT and the final lactate point.
8. Log-log Exponential Modified Dmax method (Log-Exp-ModDmax): The intensity at the
point on the exponential plus-constant regression curve that yielded the maximal perpen-
dicular distance to the straight line formed by the intensity associated with the log-log LT
and the final lactate point.
9. RCP: refer to Constant Power Exercise Bouts to Establish the Maximal Lactate Steady State

10. The estimated MLSS was based on a regression equation based on the RCP from GXT1
(RCPMLSS) (Eq 5).
Data analysis
Breath-by-breath data were edited individually with values greater than three standard devia-
tions from the mean excluded [43]. The data was interpolated on a second-by-second basis
and averaged into 5- and 30-s bins [44, 45]. The highest measured _
VO2 value from every GXT
and VEB was determined as the highest 20-s rolling average. The _
VO2max was computed as the
Fig 1. Representative blood lactate curve with 14 LTs calculated from GXT4 (participant #9). The power of the MLSS was 302 W and the
blood lactate concentration was 2.85 mmol.L-1. Log-log = power at the intersection of two linear lines with the lowest residual sum of
squares; log = using the log-log method as the point of the initial data point when calculating the Dmax or Modified Dmax; poly = Modified

 highest _
VO2 measured from any GXT or VEB. The _
VO2peak for each GXT was defined as the
highest measured _
VO2 from either the GXT or the subsequent VEB.
The _
Wmax for every GXT was determined as the power from the last completed stage plus
the time completed in the subsequent stage multiplied by the slope (Eq 6). The _
VO2 response
at the MLSS was determined by the average _
VO2 value during the last two minutes of the
30-minute constant power bout.

Calculated LTs were excluded if the mean difference between the MLSS and calculated LT was
greater than the error of the measurement of the MLSS [coefficient of the variation (CV%) = 3%,
7.9 W] [27], the effect size (ES) was greater than 0.2, or the Pearson Product moment correlation
coefficient (r) was less than 0.90. Using these criteria, 10 of the 56 LTs and the RCPMLSS (Eq 5)
were included in the analysis (Table 1).
Also shown is the mean difference (MD), the Pearson product moment correlation (r) and
effect size (ES) of the difference when compared with the MLSS. (log = using the log-log
method as the point of the initial data point when calculating the Dmax or Modified Dmax;
poly = Modified Dmax method calculated using a third order polynomial regression equation;
exp = Modified Dmax method calculated using a constant plus exponential regression equation;
OBLA = onset of blood lactate accumulation, B + = baseline lactate value plus an absolute lac-
tate value). Bold represents the LT that met the three criteria for inclusion in our final analysis:
mean difference less than 7.9 Watts, Pearson moment product correlation >0.90, and a less
than trivial ES difference from the MLSS (ES <0.2)
Statistical analysis
A one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to assess significant differences
between the MLSS and the calculated LTs. Agreement between the MLSS and the calculated LTs
was evaluated using a two-way mixed intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of
the measurement (SEM), Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (pc) [46], Bland-Altman plots
[47], (r), CV% [48, 49] and a magnitude-based inference approach involving standardised differ-
ences (ED) [50, 51]. Differences between _
VO2peak values measured during each GXT were assessed
using ES, p-values, and the CV%. Agreement between _
VO2 measured during each GXT and sub-
sequent VEB was evaluated using intraclass calculation coefficient (ICC), SEM, and CV% [49].
Descriptive statistics are reported as the mean ± SD. Alpha was set to P � 0.05.
Results
MLSS
The power associated with the MLSS was 264 ± 39 W, and the blood lactate concentrations at
the 10th and 30th min were 2.8 ± 0.8 and 3.3 ± 0.8 mmol.L-1, respectively. The blood lactate val-
ues at 3% above the MLSS (272 ± 41 W) at the 10th and 30th min were 3.6 ± 0.8 and 5.0 ± 0.9
mmol.L-1, respectively. The _
VO2 at the MLSS was 81.4 ± 4.7% of _
VO2max (3892 ± 441 mL.min-1;
50.5 ± 4.0 mL.kg-1.min-1). For each GXT the _
VO2 at the MLSS and the power at the MLSS are
shown in Table 2.

with the MLSS are provided in Table 3 and Fig 3. Figs 3–7 shows Bland-Altman plots of the 11

 VEB had a CV of 3.3, 2.0, 3.5 and 5.2%, for GXT3, GXT4, GXT7 and GXT10, respectively. The
VEB performed following the longer duration GXTs (GXT3-10) underestimated the _
VO2peak
from GXT1 (Table 6).
Discussion
The main findings of the present study are as follows. Only 11 of the 58 threshold values met
our inclusion criteria as valid estimates of the MLSS. Of the 11 methods included in our analy-
sis, three of the ModDmax methods yielded the most favourable estimations of the MLSS, and
the Log-Poly-ModDmax derived from GXT4 provided the best estimation of the MLSS. There
was an inverse relationship between stage length and LT, and this effect was larger in all Dmax
methods compared with the OBLA and baseline plus absolute lactate value methods. The
_
VO2peak values measured during the longer duration GXTs (GXT3-10) underestimated the
_
VO2max and the _
VO2peak values obtained from GXT1 (MD = 1.2 to 4.8 mL.kg-1.min-1). Finally,
contrary to our hypothesis, the VEB after the longer duration GXTs did not yield _
VO2peak val-
ues comparable to the _
VO2peak derived from GXT1.
The use of five GXT protocols, 14 common LT methods, the RCP and RCPMLSS resulted in
58 unique thresholds. However, despite their common use, we observed that only 11 of these
values met our criteria for inclusion (MD < 7.9 W; ES < 0.2; r > 0.90). Of the four Dmax meth-
ods included in our analysis, one consisted of the traditional ModDmax method [22]. This had
the poorest agreement relative to the other ModDmax methods included in our analysis. The
remaining three Dmax methods are new variations of the ModDmax method, and the Log-Poly-

 ModDmax derived from GXT4 had the highest correlation and lowest mean difference with the
MLSS. These variations of the ModDmax method use the power at the log-log LT as the initial
intensity to calculate the ModDmax and then either the traditional third-order polynomial or
exponential plus-constant regression curve to fit the lactate curve [23, 41]. Although the valid-
ity of these three methods has not previously been assessed, the favourable estimations of the
MLSS may be related to the greater objectivity with which they determine the intensity that
corresponds with the initial rise in blood lactate concentration [37].

 Although the original Dmax method is a commonly cited method for determining the LT
[23], we observed large mean differences (19 to 49 W) between the Dmax and MLSS. Three pre-
vious studies have purported to investigate the validity of this method to estimate the MLSS in
trained male cyclists [15, 52, 53]. One concluded that the Dmax method derived from GXT3
was a valid estimation of the MLSS (r = 0.97) [54]. We also observed a high correlation
between Dmax and the MLSS (r = 0.94 to 0.97) (Table 1), but, as indicated by the MD and other
measures, a high correlation is not sufficient to establish validity [55]. Another study examined
Dmax derived from two GXTs with similar durations (36 vs. 39 min), but with different stage
lengths (30-s vs. 6-min) [15]. The Dmax derived from GXT30s was not correlated (r = 0.51) with
the MLSS, even though the MD was 5 W, whilst the Dmax derived from GXT6 was correlated
(r = 0.85); however, it underestimated the MLSS (MD = 22 W). The third study concluded the
Dmax derived from GXT1 yielded poor estimates of the MLSS (r = 0.56; bias = -1.8 ± 38.1 W)
[53]. Thus, although some studies [15, 54] have used correlation analysis to suggest the Dmax
provides a valid estimate of the MLSS, this is not supported by the more comprehensive assess-
ment of validity performed in the present and other studies [53].
There were five fixed blood LT methods and one baseline plus an absolute value that met
our inclusion criteria, and, as previously reported [15, 24], these varied with the GXT protocol
used. The baseline + 1.5 mmol.L-1 was the only LT derived from GXT3 included in our analysis
(bias = -6 ± 35 W). This is consistent with the results of one previous study (bias = 0.5 ± 24
W), which also recruited trained male cyclists and had a similar GXT protocol design [56].
Consistent with our findings, this study also reported that an OBLA of 3.5 mmol.L-1 derived
from GXT3 did not provide a valid estimation of the MLSS. In contrast, another study con-
firmed the validity of the OBLA of 3.5 mmol.L-1 [52], despite recruiting trained cyclists and
using an identical GXT protocol. These conflicting results are likely attributable to the low
reproducibility of the OBLA methods [16].
While none of the OBLAs from GXT3 met our inclusion criteria, the OBLA methods of 2.5
mmol.L-1 derived from GXT4 and GXT7 provided valid estimations of the MLSS, as did the
OBLA of 3.0 mmol.L-1 derived from GXT7 and GXT10. The OBLA of 3.5 mmol.L-1 from
GXT10 was the highest fixed blood LT that identified the MLSS. There is no previous data
investigating the validity of these OBLA methods. However, it is worth noting that these five
methods provided superior estimations of the MLSS compared with the original ModDmax,
but were less favourable than the newly-developed ModDmax methods.
An OBLA of 4.0 mmol.L-1 is the most commonly-accepted fixed blood lactate value for esti-
mating the LT or MLSS. Three previous studies have attempted to validate use of an OBLA of
4.0 mmol.L-1 with cycle ergometry [15, 53, 57]. One study found that it overestimated the
MLSS (MD = 49 W) when derived from GXT1 [53]. The other study reported poor agreement
(bias 7 ± 49 W) when OBLA of 4.0 mmol.L-1 was derived from GXT4 [57]. The final study
observed a poor correlation between an OBLA of 4.0 mmol.L-1 and the MLSS (r = 0.71) [15].
Our results indicated the OBLA of 4.0 mmol.L-1 overestimated the MLSS across all GXTs.

 Thus, in agreement with previous research, our results indicate; the OBLA of 4.0 mmol.L-1
does not accurately estimate the MLSS. It is also worth noting that the original authors cau-
tioned the use of this OBLA method, given the lack of a significant correlation when compar-
ing OBLA methods from a GXT and the MLSS [24].
The RCP derived from an 8- to 12-minute GXT consistently overestimates the MLSS [44,
53], and this was confirmed in our study (Table 1). Therefore, we used a regression equation
based on the RCP (RCPMLSS) (Eq 5) to estimate the starting intensity for establishing the
MLSS [33]. Our results indicate there was good agreement between the MLSS and RCPMLSS
CI for MLSS reliability (CV = 3.0%; 95%; CI = 3.8%) calculated from Hauser et al., 2014) (log = Modified Dmax method
using the log-log method as the point of the initial lactate point; exp = Modified Dmax method calculated using a

 (Table 3). Nonetheless, for many participants the difference between MLSS and RCPMLSS
exceeded the CV% for the MLSS (Fig 3). Therefore, although the RCPMLSS can be used as a
convenient ‘starting point’ when establishing the MLSS, we recommend methods based on
blood sampling from the current study and assessing blood lactate kinetics in real time as rec-
ommended by Hering et al. [58] for a more accurate estimation of the MLSS.

 Although a single GXT can be used to estimate both _
VO2max and LT, the optimal test dura-
tion for each measure is different [11, 13]. To address this challenge, we added a supramaximal
VEB after each GXT, equivalent to that performed following GXT1, expecting all VEBs would
yield similar _
VO2 values. However, the _
VO2peak values from the VEB after the longer duration
GXTs underestimated the _
VO2peak from GXT1. Although the _
VO2peak values from GXT3 and
GXT4 were similar to GXT1, the differences were larger than the typical coefficient of variabil-
ity for _
VO2peak (CV < 3%) [59]. Our results are consistent with previous recommendations
that longer duration GXTs are not optimal for establishing _
VO2peak [10, 60]. Furthermore,
while a VEB can be used to verify that _
VO2peak was achieved, it appears that a VEB following a
prolonged GXT cannot be used to establish _
VO2max.
Extending the duration of the GXT stages results in a lower _
Wmax [61]. This has implica-
tions for exercise prescription, as it is common in sport and exercise science research to pre-
scribe exercise intensity as a percentage of _
Wmax. For example, in the present study the MLSS
ranged from 63 ± 4% (range = 52 to 72%) of _
Wmax from GXT1 to 82 ± 4% (range = 74 to 88%)

 of _
Wmax from GXT4. Prescribing exercise in the current study cohort at a fixed percentage of
_
Wmax (e.g., 73% of _
Wmax), would result in all participants exercising above or below the MLSS,
GXT1 and GXT4, respectively. This is important as it has previously been reported that pre-
scribing exercise relative to LT results in a more homogenous physiological response than
when exercise performed relative to _
Wmax [62]. This also highlights why it is important to con-
sider the GXT protocol and the method used to determine relative exercise intensity when
comparing results between studies.
The wide range of _
Wmax for each GXT is also note-worthy, the _
Wmax range for GXT1 was
320 to 517 W and the duration ranged from 9 to 12 minutes. Had we employed a standardized
GXT (e.g., 35 W increments), and assuming _
Wmax stayed constant, the range would have been
9- to 15 min. Applying this to our longer duration GXTs resulted in a homogenous duration
(GXT4: 32- to 39 min), whereas a standardised approach (e.g., 35 W increments) would have
resulted in a range of 27- to 46 min [57]. Thus, individualizing GXT protocol design is a useful
approach to ensure homogenous test duration [17].
Conclusion
In conclusion, the traditional Dmax and OBLA of 4.0 mmol.L-1 did not provide valid estimates
of the MLSS. The best estimation of the MLSS was the Log-Poly-ModDmax derived from
GXT4. The validity of our newly-developed ModDmax model may relate to the objectivity for
determining the initial rise in blood lactate concentration. However, we must advise caution
with the use of our newly-developed method until future research investigates the reliability
and reproducibility. It is apparent that both _
VO2max and LT cannot be determined in a single
GXT, even if the GXT is followed by a VEB. Therefore, to appropriately determine _
VO2max the
optimum duration of a GXT is 8–12 minutes and the _
VO2 values measured during the GXT
and VEB be within 3% = CV [63]. Our data also highlight how differences in GXT protocol
design and methods used to calculate the relative exercise intensity may contribute to the con-
flicting findings reported in the literature.
