High intelligence is touted as being predictive of positive outcomes including educational success and income
level. However, little is known about the difficulties experienced among this population. Specifically, those with
a high intellectual capacity (hyper brain) possess overexcitabilities in various domains that may predispose them
to certain psychological disorders as well as physiological conditions involving elevated sensory, and altered
immune and inflammatory responses (hyper body). The present study surveyed members of American Mensa,
Ltd. (n = 3715) in order to explore psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) processes among those at or above the
98th percentile of intelligence. Participants were asked to self-report prevalence of both diagnosed and/or
suspected mood and anxiety disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum dis-
order (ASD), and physiological diseases that include environmental and food allergies, asthma, and autoimmune
disease. High statistical significance and a remarkably high relative risk ratio of diagnoses for all examined
conditions were confirmed among the Mensa group 2015 data when compared to the national average statistics.
This implicates high IQ as being a potential risk factor for affective disorders, ADHD, ASD, and for increased
incidence of disease related to immune dysregulation. Preliminary findings strongly support a hyper brain/hyper
body association which may have substantial individual and societal implications and warrants further in-
vestigation to best identify and serve this at-risk population.
Intelligence quotient (IQ) is generally touted as a gift predicting
exceptional outcomes in many domains including educational attain-
ment and income level (Bergman, Corovic, Ferrer-Wreder, & Modig,
2014) and is a positive indicator of high system integrity (Gale, Hatch,
Batty, & Deary, 2009; Gale, Batty, Tynelius, Deary, & Rasmussen, 2010;
Gottfredson,
2004;
Lubinski & Humphreys,
1992;
Wraw,
Deary,
Gale, & Der, 2015; Wrulich et al., 2013). However, there are conflicting
studies in the literature which point to an association between gifted IQ,
particularly high verbal ability, and various mental and immunological
outcomes such as depression (Jackson & Peterson, 2003; Wraw, Deary,
Der, & Gale, 2016); bipolar disorder (Gale et al., 2013; MacCabe et al.,
2010; Smith et al., 2015); anxiety disorders (Lancon et al., 2015);
ADHD (Rommelse et al., 2016); allergies, asthma, and immune dis-
orders (Benbow, 1985, 1986); and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
(Clark et al., 2016). These seemingly contradictory outcomes may be
partially reconciled by taking a closer look at the field of psychoneur-
oimmunology (PNI) which examines the way in which the stress re-
sponse to the environment, particularly that which is chronic and
sustained, influences the communication between the brain and im-
mune system (Ader, 2001).
This article extends the current literature on PNI and a variety of
physiological and psychological disorders by assessing whether high
intelligence may be linked to higher prevalence rates. This is a critical
contribution, as research on intelligence and many disorders tends to
focus on those with low intelligence to normal IQ scores, rather than
extending to the upper ranges of the spectrum. To investigate these
links, we assessed whether the prevalence rates in 2015 for those with
high intelligence were higher than the reported national averages for
mood disorders, anxiety disorders, ADHD, allergies, asthma, auto-
immune diseases, and ASD. The connections between intellectual
overexcitabilities and each of these conditions are discussed next.

 notable researchers within the field of cognitive ability (Gottfredson,
1997). Those who are highly intelligent possess unique intensities and
overexcitabilities which can be at once remarkable and disabling. For
example, the same heightened awareness that inspires an intellectually
gifted artist to create (Jauk, Benedek, Dunst, & Neubauer, 2013;
Karwowski et al., 2016; Pässler, Beinicke, & Benedikt, 2015) can also
potentially drive that same individual to withdraw into a deep de-
pression (Jamison, 1993; Kyaga et al., 2011; Ludwig, 1992, 1995;
Simonton & Song, 2009). It is hardly a new notion that unusually high
rates of adult psychopathology are displayed among some of the most
eminent geniuses (Jamison, 1993; Ludwig, 1992, 1995) with the
poorest in mental health being among imaginative writers such as
poets, novelists, and dramatists. The intensities leading to these psy-
chological disorders were found to have manifested at a young age
(Simonton & Song, 2009). Gere, Capps, Mitchell, and Grubbs (2009)
gathered data on 6 to 11-year-old gifted students attending a public
school gifted program and found that gifted children reacted with sig-
nificantly heightened emotional and behavioral responses to their en-
vironment than did those of average intelligence. Due in part to this
increased awareness, those with an overexcitable cognitive ability tend
toward hyper-reactivity of the central nervous system (Chang & Kuo,
2013), which can lead to various other psychological and physiological
consequences.
1.1. Intellectual overexcitabilities
Overexcitability (OE) is a term first introduced by Polish psychiatrist
and psychologist, Kazimierz Dabrowski. He is most known for his theory of
positive disintegration which came about by studying individuals with a
high cognitive ability across their lifespans to understand their higher levels
of emotional development (Dabrowski, 1964a, 1964b, 1966; Dąbrowski,
1976). His coined term is the English translation of the Polish word ‘nad-
pobudliwosc’ that originally means ‘superstimulatability.’ Dabrowski found
these hyper-reactions and intensities to occur with greater frequency and of
greater strength in the intellectually gifted compared to those with a normal
or lower IQ. According to his clinical observations, bright individuals
tended to be “neurotically allergic or nervous,” a condition which he ob-
served to be relatively absent in the intellectually delayed. They demon-
strated a uniquely heightened way of experiencing and responding to their
environment within five specific areas: psychomotor, sensory, intellectual,
imaginational, and emotional domains. He found these overexcitabilities to
be associated with personality development, and observed symptoms of
slight neuroses among them as well, such as depression, mild anxiety, and
tics (Mendaglio, 2008; Miller, Falk, & Huang, 2009).
1.2. Psychological overexcitabilities: Affective disorders and ADHD
Recent research agrees with Dabrowski and finds that an intense
emotional response of individuals to their environment can lead to in-
creased rumination and worry, both which have been associated with
higher cognitive ability (Penney, Miedema, & Mazmanian, 2015). Ru-
mination predicts chronicity of depressive disorders and anxiety
symptoms including the new onsets of episodes (Nolen-Hoeksema,
2000). A highly ruminative cognitive style has been shown to be as-
sociated with increased vulnerability to major depression (Marchetti,
Koster, Sonuga-Barke, & De Raedt, 2012; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000) and
contributes
to
symptom
severity
(Coplan
et
al.,
2006,
2012;
Kuehner & Weber, 1999)). Worry is the proposed cognitive process
underlying general anxiety disorder (GAD) (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013; Clark & Wells, 1995; Nolen-Hoeksema, 2000) and as
with rumination, those who tend to worry more often and more se-
verely, score higher on tests of intelligence. Penney et al. (2015) de-
monstrated that verbal intelligence in particular is a positive predictor
of worry and rumination as well as being predictive of severity of both
processes.
The presence of mood and anxiety disorders was found among other
psychological conditions such as attention deficit/hyperactivity dis-
order (ADHD). In a longitudinal study by Michielsen et al. (2013),
adults were assessed over a 6-year period for symptoms of ADHD, de-
pression, and anxiety. The authors found that those with ADHD were at
higher risk for both of these affective disorders. Further, Kessler et al.
(2006) found that adults with ADHD often present co-occurring psy-
chiatric conditions, including anxiety (47%) and mood (38%) disorders.
Of note, those with high intelligence who experience psychomotor
overexcitabilities in particular are those often diagnosed with ADHD
due to the lack of general knowledge about this particular OE. This
diagnosis oftentimes prevents individuals from being properly identi-
fied as having a gifted intellectual ability (Rommelse et al., 2016).
1.3. Physiological overexcitabilities: Psychoneuroimmunology
As the field of PNI grows and develops, many discrete pathways
connecting psychology and immunity are being discovered (Ader,
2001). For highly intelligent individuals with overexcitabilities, even
normal stimuli such as a clothing tag or a common but unnatural sound
can become physically painful. Continuous seemingly minor insults
such as these may mimic a low level, chronic stress which can even-
tually launch an inappropriate immune response. As with other en-
vironmental threats, like an infection or toxin, the body believes it is in
danger. When the sympathetic nervous system becomes chronically
activated, it finds itself in a continuous fight, flight, or freeze state,
which triggers a series of changes in the brain and the body that can
dysregulate immune function (Glaser et al., 1992; Kiecolt-Glaser,
Glaser, Gravenstein, Malarkey, & Sheridan, 1996; Padgett & Glaser,
2003). We are learning that stress has a significant effect on the ability
of the immune system to protect us and consequences can take many
forms including allergies, asthma, and autoimmune disease (Nasr,
Altman, & Meltzer, 1981). While there is empirical evidence that mood
disorders are associated with immune dysregulation, researchers have
yielded conflicting results as to whether this dysregulation contributes
to the pathophysiology of depressive disorders (Postal & Appenzeller,
2015; Young, Bruno, & Pomara, 2014) or whether depressive disorders
increase susceptibility to immune-related disorders and health condi-
tions such as infection, allergy and autoimmune diseases (Kronfol,
2002; Sansone & Sansone, 2011). Evidence for the latter is compelling
given that altered immune function has been shown to be induced by
chronically stressful stimuli in both human and animal models
(Padgett & Glaser, 2003).
1.3.1. Allergies, asthma, and autoimmune disease
A combination of high intelligence and various allergies that begin in
early childhood is not only a common stereotype, it is also verified in the
scientific literature. In 1966, a significantly increased rate of allergies and
asthma were reported at a school for gifted children (Hildreth, 1966). In a
study of allergies and asthma in such children, 44% of those with an IQ
over 160 suffered from allergies compared to 20% of age matched peers
and 10% report having asthma (Rogers & Silverman, 1997; Silverman,
2002). Benbow (1986) conducted a study of over 400 highly mathema-
tically and verbally talented students who were tested by the Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT) to be in top 0.01% in reasoning ability. Among the
students, she found that about half reported allergies, asthma, and other
immune disorders compared to the expected prevalence of each disorder.
She also found that parents and siblings of the students were more likely to
suffer from these conditions than average-ability individuals (Benbow,
1985, 1986). Further, increased evidence of allergies, autoimmune dis-
ease, sensory sensitivity and high IQ has been found in a subset of in-
dividuals with ADHD (Chen et al., 2013; Cordeiro et al., 2011) and among
those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Gottfried, Bambini-Junior,
Francis, Riesgo, & Savino, 2015; Lyall, Van de Water, Ashwood, & Hertz-
Picciotto, 2015).

 1.3.2. Autism spectrum disorder
The association between highly intelligent individuals and ASD has
been recently reexamined but it is certainly not new. In 1943, the
original description of classic autism was reported by its pioneer, Dr.
Leo Kanner, as children who were highly intelligent and able to re-
member and reproduce complex patterns but who also displayed “a
powerful desire for aloneness” and “an obsessive insistence on persis-
tent sameness” (Kanner, 1943, p. 249). Kanner found a common de-
nominator in the backgrounds of the children he studied: they all came
from highly intelligent families. Of the 11 families, four of the fathers
were psychiatrists, two had law degrees, and the others included a
chemist, a plant pathologist, a professor, an engineer, and a successful
business entrepreneur. Nine of the eleven mothers were college grad-
uates. Kanner observed both parents and grandparents as being “ob-
sessive,” and “strongly occupied with abstractions of a scientific, lit-
erary, or artistic nature” (p. 250). Shortly thereafter in 1944, a German
scientist named Hans Asperger described a milder, higher functioning
form of the condition described by Kanner, which became known as
Asperger's syndrome. Again, the cases he reported were all boys who
were highly intelligent but had trouble with social interactions and
specific obsessive interests. Asperger called his young patients “little
professors” and felt they would be capable of exceptional achievement
and original thought later in life (Asperger, 1944/1991; Frith, 1991).
Roughly seventy years later, we are beginning to see evidence that
agrees with the early observations of Kanner and Asperger suggesting that
enhanced brain functioning may lie at the heart of ASD. In a recent study,
by the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium, the polygenic risk for ASD was
calculated from genome-wide association studies in a cohort of 9863 in-
dividuals in the general population and found polygenic risk for ASD was
positively correlated with higher intellectual ability. The specific areas in
which they were intellectually superior were logical memory, verbal flu-
ency, and vocabulary. The authors found that even among those who never
developed ASD, carrying the complex genetic traits associated with the
disorder was linked to scoring better on cognitive tests than controls. This
was replicated in the same study in another cohort of 1522 individuals
where, again, polygenic risk for ASD had higher full-scale IQ (Clark et al.,
2016). Notably, and as reported by Kanner initially, there is a greater in-
cidence of ASD in offspring whose parent(s) are in professions typically
associated with a high cognitive ability, particularly those in engineering or
the hard sciences (Wheelwright & Baron-Cohen, 2001). This makes a heri-
table, high intellectual capacity a critical variable to investigate when re-
searching the genetic contributions to ASD, especially given that high in-
telligence was a consistent variable originally observed by both Kanner and
Asperger.
1.4. Hyper brain/hyper body theory
To our knowledge, no studies have examined the potential psycho-
neuroimmunological interplay between each of the variables herein. Our
goal for this exploratory study was to cast a wide net in order to investigate
possible associations. We sought to directly address the question, “Is there a
relationship between a heightened cognitive capacity (hyper brain) and
heightened psychological and subsequent physiological immune responses
(hyper body)?” We examined the prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders,
ADHD, food and environmental allergies, asthma, autoimmune disease, and
ASD in those with high intelligence compared to the national average. We
introduce evidence to support our hypothesis that high intellectual capacity
is a risk factor for each of the above psychological and physiological con-
ditions and propose the present findings to be in alignment with a novel,
hyper brain / hyper body theory.
2. Method
2.1. Participants
Participants were members of American Mensa, Ltd., a society open
to persons who have at some point attained a verified score within the
upper 2% of the general population on an approved intelligence test
that has been professionally administered and supervised. Since there
are a large number of tests with different scales, American Mensa, Ltd.
has set a percentile rather than a score as the cutoff in order to avoid
confusion. Although the American division of Mensa consists of 55,000
members, only 20,000 members belong to the pool of available research
subjects. These members have previously agreed to be available to
participate in research studies in general and were not directly asked for
this study in particular. Since over 5000 members entered the Qualtrics
site (4328 members consented to the study), the response rate was
between 20 and 25%. For an email survey request with no follow-up, a
25–30% response rate is expected (Kittleson, 1997). Of those recruited,
4931 (approximately 10% of the American Mensan, Ltd. population)
responded to the invitation which was sent directly to each individual
by American Mensa, Ltd., via an email with a direct link to the survey.
We excluded those who (a) did not provide consent, (b) did not
finish the survey, and (c) did not completely view the allergies and/or
psychological conditions sections. This left 3715 remaining participants
who sufficiently completed the survey for our analysis.
Participants included 2213 that identified as male (60%), 1472 that
identified as female (40%), 22 who identified as non-cisgender, and 8
who declined to state. Regarding race, 87.9% of participants reported
being European American, 2.7% as Asian American, 2.6% as Hispanic
or Latino, 1.6% as African American, and 5.2% as other, mixed race, or
who did not respond. The age range of participants was from 18 to
91 years (M = 53, SD = 15.18). Thus, the majority of participants were
older, male, and European American.
Incomes were reported as their highest annual salaries earned rather
than their current income to demonstrate potential earnings. Though 92
did not respond, of those that did, 41.7% earned over $100,000; 16.9%
earned between $76,000 and $100,000; 20.1% earned between
$51,000 and $75,000; 14.9% earned between $26,000 and $50,000;
and 3.9% earned less than $25,000. For highest degree earned, 116 did
not respond; of those that did, 3.7% earned a doctoral or post-doctoral
degree, 38.7% earned a master's degree, 29.2% earned a bachelor's
degree, 12.8% earned an associate's degree or completed a trade school
or certificate program, 12.4% finished high school with no further
education, and 0.1% did not complete any degree. Overall, our sample
reported higher education levels and higher income than national
averages which supports prior literature citing a relationship between
high cognitive ability and positive educational and socioeconomic
outcomes (Bergman et al., 2014).
2.1.1. Control group
In order to compare the prevalence of each condition between those
with a high cognitive ability against those with normal intelligence, we
needed a sample of the latter to act as a control group. Because we were
not able to survey a comparative number of participants with a reliably
tested intelligence in the average range, national survey data for each
condition were used instead. Although the national surveys would
likely capture a broad range of intelligence, statistically only 2% of the
national data would include those with a gifted cognitive ability such
those who qualify for membership in American Mensa, Ltd. For each
diagnosis, data from the most recent year was used to compare to the
2015 data collected from Mensa.
2.2. Materials and procedure
After receiving IRB approval from Pitzer College and American
Mensa, Ltd., members received an email inviting them to participate in
the present study. Participants were provided a link to an online
questionnaire. Upon providing consent, participants voluntarily re-
sponded to the survey questions, followed by a debriefing page.
The survey consisted of two sections: one for the participant, and
another for the participant's children and the child's other biological

 parent. Only the data specifically related to the participants themselves
were used for this study. Within each section, participants first an-
swered demographic questions about their age, gender, educational and
occupational background, and IQ scores. They also answered questions
about other factors, such as average stress levels and sleep habits, on a
5-point scale of very unhealthy to very healthy (analysis of factors un-
related to overexcitabilities were not included in this analysis).
Participants were then asked to indicate whether they have been
either (a) diagnosed or (b) suspected they should be diagnosed with a
variety of diseases, syndromes, and dysregulations with the item: “For
each syndrome, disease, or disorder you have, please indicate if it was for-
mally diagnosed by a medical professional or only suspected to exist.”
Distinguishing between diagnosed and suspected conditions was im-
portant because many do not seek medical help for certain conditions,
preferring instead to self-diagnose and manage them independently.
For example, only about half of people with depressive symptoms seek
medical treatment (González et al., 2010). Therefore, we felt it was
pertinent to include these individuals in our analysis to provide a more
complete representation of prevalence. Further, survey items asked
about those conditions they currently had, which ensures point pre-
valence rather than lifetime prevalence of each examined condition.
Examined conditions included a wide variety of disorders, from
allergies to sleep apnea. This study included analysis on those disorders
for which we had evidence suggesting a relationship between them and
high cognitive ability. Unrelated conditions, such as sleep apnea, were
ultimately not included in the final analysis. Overall, two broad cate-
gories of disorders emerged: psychological and physiological condi-
tions. Psychological disorders included affective disorders (mood and
anxiety), ADHD, and ASD. Mood disorders included major depressive
disorder, dysthymic disorder, and bipolar disorder. Anxiety disorders
included generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive
disorder. These affective disorder subcategories correspond with those
included in our control prevalence data (NIMH). All psychological
disorders
aligned
with
DSM-IV
diagnoses
(American
Psychiatric
Association, 2000) which was the current manual at the time of the
survey development as well as for the comparative national surveys.
Importantly, ASD diagnoses rely on the DSM-IV. The changes in the
DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) radically impacted the
diagnosis of ASD, which formerly differentiated between autism, As-
perger's syndrome, and other pervasive developmental disorders (PDD).
Currently Asperger's is now labeled high functioning autism. However,
since this survey and the national surveys used for comparison use the
older term, this study uses Asperger's syndrome rather than the DSM-IV
terminology. Because ASD is listed in the DSM-IV, we have listed it as a
psychological overexcitability. However, it is also included herein as a
physiological overexcitability given the immunological processes at
play that have been demonstrated in the scientific literature.
Physiological diseases included allergies (food and environmental),
asthma, and autoimmune dysregulations including those found in ASD.
For both food and environmental allergy categories, we asked partici-
pants to differentiate whether they have an allergy versus a sensitivity
or intolerance. We focused on those who reported a true allergy in order
to more accurately compare with the national average. As a collection
of diseases, those that were autoimmune in nature were the most dif-
ficult to define and compare, as there are several agencies that report
the prevalence of autoimmune disease. The NIH is one of the more
conservative organizations; they point to approximately 80 diseases
that occur as a result of the immune system attacking the organs, tis-
sues, and cells of the body, however their statistics only included 24
diseases for which good epidemiology studies were available (U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 2002), compared to over
100 diseases included by the AARDA. However, since not all scientists

Note: Mood disorders include depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, and bipolar disorder. Anxiety disorder includes generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and obsessive compulsive
disorder. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) include the DSM-IV diagnoses of autism, Asperger's syndrome, and other pervasive developmental disorders. The “combined” category
includes individuals that suspect they have the disorder (self-diagnoses) in addition to those who were diagnosed by a medical professional. Confidence intervals are for the percent of
diagnosed individuals with high intelligence (and those with combined diagnoses). Risk ratio indicates the risk for those with high intelligence in having each disorder compared to the
national averages.

 agree with the classification of these other diseases as autoimmune
conditions, we chose to use the NIH standards as a more conservative
and reliable estimate.
3. Results
This study examines the prevalence of several disorders in those
with higher intelligence compared to those with average abilities. For
this analysis, we conducted a series of binomial tests which compares
observed proportions in the study sample (those with tested high in-
telligence) to hypothesized values (national averages). For example,
according to the NIH (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, & Walters, 2005) the
prevalence rate for ADHD is 4.1%. Given the total sample size of 3715,
we would expect 152 participants to have been diagnosed with this
disorder. However, the actual frequency of ADHD diagnoses within this
study's participant sample was 239 diagnoses (7.4%), which is sig-
nificantly greater (exact binomial p < 0.001). See Table 1 for a com-
parison of prevalence between those of high intelligence and the na-
tional averages across all conditions.
Significance for this test indicates that there is a higher proportion
of individuals with high intelligence with the specified disorder com-
pared to what one would expect, given the national averages, sug-
gesting that high cognitive ability may be a risk factor for the specified
disorder. Due to the number of the tests being performed, there is an
increased probability of committing at least one Type I error. Thus, we
used Bonferroni's correction (α = 0.05/16), resulting in a corrected
α = 0.0031. As can be seen in Table 1, the prevalence of all eight
disorders were significantly greater in the high intelligence sample
compared to the national averages. These results held true for both
diagnosed disorders and for the combination of diagnosed and sus-
pected disorders.
The 95% confidence intervals (CI) provide further support for these
significant findings, as none of the interval ranges include zero. In ad-
dition, all of the CI ranges are narrow, indicating low error rates. As
shown in Table 1, CI ranges are > 3%, indicating that the reported
prevalence for those with high intelligence in each category is accurate
within approximately ± 1.5%.
However, significance and confidence intervals are impacted by
sample size, and this study's large sample makes finding significance
unsurprising, even after correcting for the number of calculations.
Therefore, effect size is particularly useful to explore. For effect sizes,
we reported the relative risk, or risk ratio (RR), which indicates the
probability of being diagnosed with the specified disorder for an in-
dividual with high cognitive ability (observed) compared to an in-
dividual with average intelligence (hypothesized). This is calculated as
Relative Risk (RR) = Pobserved / Phypothesized
An RR of 1 indicates that there is no difference between groups; an
RR > 1 indicates that there is a higher risk for those with higher in-
telligence. For example, an RR of 2.5 indicates that an individual with
high cognitive ability has 2.5 times the risk of developing a particular
disorder as compared to the norm. This represents an increased risk of
150% of developing the disorder above those representing the national
average. As can be seen in Table 1, all disorders held increased risks of
both diagnoses and self-diagnoses among those of high cognitive ability
compared with national averages.
3.1. Psychological disorders
In this study, mood disorders included depressive disorder, dys-
thymic disorder, and bipolar disorder. Estimates of mood disorders
within the adult population range from 8.4% to 12% (Olfson, Blanco,
& Marcus, 2016; Pinto Pereira, Geoffoy, & Power, 2014). As expected,
there was a higher incidence of mood disorders in the high intelligence
sample; 17.3% more than the national average as reported by the NIMH
(Kessler et al., 2005). The associated RR is 2.82, which indicates an
increase of risk by 182% for those of high intelligence in developing at
least one of these mood disorders. For the combination of diagnosed
and suspected diagnoses, there was 3.85 times the risk (an increase of
285%).
Anxiety disorders in this study included generalized anxiety, social
anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). As hypothesized,
there was a greater prevalence of anxiety disorders among those with
high intelligence: 9.1% more than the national average when limited to
these three categories (Kessler et al., 2005). Overall, there was 1.83
times the risk of being formally diagnosed with anxiety (an increase of
83%). When including those who suspected that they should be diag-
nosed, there was a risk of 3.42, an increase of 242% as compared to the
national average.
Prevalence of ADHD (and the older diagnosis of ADD) was sig-
nificantly greater in the high intelligence sample—an increased pre-
valence of 3.3% compared to the national average (U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, 2002). Overall, those of high cognitive
ability are 1.8 times as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD compared to
the national average (an 80% increase). Further, when combined with
those who suspected diagnoses, there was 3.39 times the risk of de-
veloping ADHD symptoms, a 239% increase compared to the national
average.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) includes the DSM-IV diagnoses of
autism, Asperger's syndrome, and other PDDs. Although only Asperger's
is characterized by high intelligence in the DSM-IV, this study's com-
bined ASD sample included 0.2% more than what the CDC (Blumberg
et al., 2013) would expect. Though the increase was small, it was still
significant (see Table 1). When comparing diagnosed patients, there
was 1.2 times the risk within the high intelligence group compared with
national averages (a 20% increase). However, an additional 5.1% sus-
pected that they should be diagnosed with ASD, for a total combined
risk of 6.3 times the national average, an increase of 530%.
3.2. Physiological diseases
Physiological overexcitabilities include diseases and dysregulations
that are primarily physical in nature—allergies, asthma, and auto-
immune diseases. The data on food allergies in adults is limited; most
studies center around rates in childhood. Liu et al. (2010) estimates
rates of 2.5% for adults in 2005–2006, but here we used the higher,
more conservative rate of 3.7% from the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services (2002) since childhood rates have been increasing over
time (CDC, 2013–2015). Food allergies had an increase of 5.9% in the
high cognitive ability sample, for an RR of 2.59, indicating an increased
risk of 159% compared to the national average. For those who self-
diagnosed food allergies, there was an increased risk of 159%
(RR = 2.59).
Studies of environmental allergies are likewise often on children,
such as the reported 10.6% prevalence rate by Blumberg et al. (2013).
Estimates for adults in recent studies range from 7.3–14.7% (Blackwell,
Lucas, & Clarke, 2014; CDC, 2015; Han, Forno, Gogna, & Celedón, 2016;
Schiller, Lucas, Ward, & Peregoy, 2012). Using the moderate rate of
10.6%, we found that the rate of environmental allergies increased by
22.6% in the high intelligence sample compared to the national
average. Overall, there was 3.13 times the risk of being diagnosed with
an environmental allergy, an increase of 213%, for those with high
cognitive ability. When included self-diagnoses, there was 4.33 times
the risk, for an increase of 333%.
For asthma, there was an 8% increase in the number of diagnoses in
those with high cognitive ability compared to national averages, as
reported by the CDC (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
2014). Rates have remained steady in recent years, between 7.4 and 8%
(Blackwell et al., 2014; CDC, 2015; Schiller et al., 2012). There was
2.08 times the risk of diagnoses, for an increase of 108%. When in-
cluding self-diagnoses, there was 2.34 times the risk, for an increase of
134%.

 Lastly, for autoimmune diseases, there was an increase of 6.7% di-
agnoses in the high intelligence sample compared with the estimates
provided by the NIH (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
2002). Those with higher cognitive ability were 1.84 times as likely to
be diagnosed with at least one of the two dozen disorders included this
category, for an increased risk of 84%. When combined with self-di-
agnoses, there was 2 times the risk for this in the sample, a 100% in-
crease of symptomatology compared with the national average.
3.3. Auxiliary analyses
Given that several of the original categories of conditions were
comprised of multiple disorders (e.g., anxiety disorders), where pos-
sible we decided to conduct auxiliary analyses to see if the above pat-
tern of significance held true for these specific disorders. For these
additional six analyses, we applied a second Bonferroni's correction
(α = 0.05/6), resulting in a corrected α = 0.008. For all analyses, in-
dividuals with co-morbid, or overlapping, diagnoses within the same
category (e.g., mood disorders) were counted once within the category
but multiple times for each specific disorder. For example, if an in-
dividual indicated a diagnosis of major depression and a suspicion of
bipolar disorder, they would be counted as having been diagnosed with
a mood disorder, diagnosed with major depression, and included in the
combined category of bipolar disorder. See Table 2 for the comparative
prevalence, 95% CIs, significance values, and RRs.
3.3.1. Mood disorders
In order to examine these results in more detail, as recommended by
the NIMH, we separated those with bipolar disorder from those with
other depressive disorders (see Fig. 1). This separation is important
because bipolar disorder includes depressive episodes, but is markedly
different from other depressive disorders, given the additional of manic
episodes. Additionally, while rates for major depression have remained
relatively stable in recent years (Baxter et al., 2014), rates for bipolar
have been increasing (Harpaz-Rotem, Leslie, Martin, & Rosenheck,
2005; Harpaz-Rotem & Rosenheck, 2004; Moreno et al., 2007). In-
dividuals with bipolar disorder as a diagnosis comprised of 3.3% of the
sample (124 individuals), and increased to 194 (5.2%) when combined
with self-diagnoses. In comparison, the NIMH reports a prevalence rate
of 2.6% (Kessler et al., 2005). For diagnoses of bipolar disorder, the
difference between those with high cognitive ability and the national
average was significant (95% CI [0.03, 0.04], RR = 1.28, p = 0.004).
When including those who had suspected diagnoses, the relationship
was also significant (95% CI [0.04, 0.06], p < 0.001), such those with
high intelligence are more likely to have bipolar symptoms. Thus, when
including those who suspected they had bipolar disorder, there was
2.01 times the risk for those of high intelligence (an increase of 101%).
Other depressive disorders had a diagnosis rate of 25.8% (957 in-
dividuals) among the high intelligence sample, which increased to 1308
(35.2%) when combined with self-diagnoses. The NIMH (Kessler et al.,
2005) reports that 6.7% of the national population experiences at least
one major depressive episode each year. This is consistent with the
2015 data from the NIMH, suggesting that rates of major depression
have remained steady for the last decade (Substance Abuse and Mental
Health
Services
Administration,
2015).

 depressive disorder, the binomial was significant (p < 0.001), in-
dicating a higher prevalence for those of high intelligence in compar-
ison to national average, 95% CI [0.24, 0.27]. There was 3.85 times the
risk (an increase of 285%) for those of high intelligence of being di-
agnosed. When including those who suspected depression, there was
also a significant increase (95% CI [0.34, 0.37], p < 0.001). There was
5.25 times the risk (and increase of 425%) for those of high intelligence
of experiencing symptoms of major depression to the extent of sus-
pecting either major depressive disorder or the longer-lasting dys-
thymic disorder.
3.3.2. Anxiety disorders
Like the mood disorders, we separated the anxiety disorders in order
to see if there were differences among the three types (see Fig. 2). For
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), there were 662 diagnoses (17.8%),
which increased to 1030 (27.7%) when combined with self-diagnoses.
According to the NIMH (Kessler et al., 2005), there is a 3.1% national
prevalence rate, though only 52.3% of these are receiving treatment.
For diagnoses of GAD, the binomial was significant (p < 0.001), in-
dicating a higher prevalence of GAD in the high intelligence sample,
95% CI [0.17, 0.19]. For the study participants, there was 5.74 times
the risk (an increase of 474%) of being diagnosed with GAD compared
to the national average. When combined with self-diagnoses, the bi-
nomial was also significant in the same direction (95% CI [0.26, 0.29],
p < 0.001). There was 8.94 times the risk (an increase of 794%) of
experience GAD symptoms for those of high intelligence compared to
the national average.
For social anxiety, there were 226 diagnoses (6.1%), which in-
creased to 498 (19.5%) when combined with self-diagnoses. According
to the NIMH (Kessler et al., 2005), there is a 6.8% national prevalence
rate, though only 45.6% are seeking treatment. For diagnoses of social
anxiety, the binomial was not significant when taking into account
Bonferroni's corrections (95% CI [0.05, 0.07], p = 0.043). There was
0.9 times the risk of being diagnosed with social anxiety, a decrease of
10% compared to the national average. However, when including
self-diagnoses, the binomial was significant (95% CI [0.18, 0.21],
p < 0.001), such that there was a higher prevalence of those who also
self-diagnosed social anxiety compared to the national average. There
was 2.87 times the risk (an increase of 187%) for those of high cognitive
ability to experience symptoms of social anxiety compared to the na-
tional average.
For OCD, there were 121 diagnoses (3.3%), which increased to 404
(10.9%) when combined with self-diagnoses. According to the NIMH
(Kessler et al., 2005), there is a 1.0% national prevalence rate. For di-
agnoses of OCD, the binomial was significant (p < 0.001), such that
there was a higher incidence in those with high intelligence, 95% CI
[0.03, 0.04]. There was 3.3 times the risk for those with high in-
telligence (an increase of 230%) of being diagnosed with OCD com-
pared to the national average. When combined with self-diagnoses, the
binomial was also significant, (p < 0.001), such that there was a
higher incidence in those with high intelligence, 95% CI [0.10, 0.12].
There was 10.9 times the risk for those of high intelligence (an increase
of 990%) of developing OCD symptomatology compared to the national
average.
3.3.3. Autism spectrum disorders
ASD as a combination of disorders deserves special attention, as it
uniquely contains those who are often miscategorized as low func-
tioning or low intelligence. For example, Christensen et al. (2016)
found that of children with symptoms of ASD, only 43.9% were clas-
sified as having an IQ score above 85. Of our participants, 10 (0.3%)
identified as diagnosed with autism (37 or 1% when combined with
self-diagnoses) and 1 as PDD (5 or 0.1% when combined with self-di-
agnoses). In contrast, 41 (1.1%) identified themselves as having been
diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, and when combined with self-
diagnoses, this number rose to 216 (5.8%). The traditional diagnosis of
autism occurs approximately 4–10 times as frequently as Asperger's
(Christensen et al., 2016; Fombonne, 2005), and thus the proportion of
those with autism, Asperger's, and other PDDs are markedly different
between the national averages and this study's sample.
When isolating the 2005 rates of Asperger's (0.026%; Fombonne,
2015), there were significant increases in diagnoses rates among those
in this study (p < 0.001), with 42.31 times the risk (an increase of
4131% for those of high intelligence). When combined with self-diag-
noses, these numbers increase impressively (95% CI [0.05, 0.07],
p < 0.001). There is 223.08 times the risk for those of tested high
intelligence of self-diagnosing Asperger's syndrome, an increased risk of
22,208% compared to the national average (see Fig. 3).
Overall, we found there to be increased risks for every examined
condition in those with high intelligence compared to those among the
national data (see Fig. 4). This pattern holds true for both self-diagnoses
and clinical diagnoses. Thus, our hyper brain/hyper body hypothesis
was supported.
4. Discussion
Fig. 5 is a novel, visual representation of our hyper brain/hyper
body theory of integration. The model posits a unique psychoneur-
oimmunological process such that those with a hyper brain in the form
of very superior (at or above 130) cognitive ability lend themselves to a
greater tendency to respond to environmental stressors by ruminating
and worrying which are positive predictors of risk for psychological
overexcitabilities leading to affective disorders. These disorders are
closely associated with a hyper body which manifests in physiological
overexcitabilities which take the form of immune and inflammatory
dysregulation, which can also bi-directionally instigate psychological
effects. In order to test our hyper brain/hyper body theory, we looked at
between-group differences by comparing those with verified in-
telligence falling at or above the 98th percentile against the national
average prevalence of the disorders and conditions under investigation.

there were no significant differences in clinical diagnoses between those of high in-
telligence and the national average. However, there was a significant increase of pre-
valence when including those who suspected diagnoses.

 diagnoses for all examined conditions were confirmed in the Mensa
group. The present results strongly support our theoretical framework,
demonstrating that highly intelligent individuals are at a significantly
greater risk for mood and anxiety disorders, ADHD, and conditions
involving inflammation and dysregulation of the immune system such
as allergies, asthma, autoimmune disease, and ASD when compared to
national averages. Many of these conditions tend to co-occur/overlap
making it challenging to discuss them solely on an individual basis.
With this in mind, we suggest several possible explanations for our
findings.
4.1. Intellectual overexcitabilities
The examined conditions may be, in part, a result of the over-
excitabilities found among the intellectually gifted as first introduced
by Dabrowski (1964a, 1964b, 1966, 1976). These exist within five
specific domains: psychomotor, sensory, intellectual, imaginational,
and emotional. According to his research, highly intelligent individuals
may or may not possess all of them and may find themselves to be
considerably stronger in one area over another. Some excitabilities
within high IQ can even be diagnosed as medical conditions (eg.
someone with a psychomotor OE being misidentified as having ADHD).
Thus, it is beneficial to consider OEs as part of a comprehensive as-
sessment especially for gifted children who will grow up to be gifted
adults. Since Dabrowski first developed his theory, there have been
several scales created to measure these domains (Rost, Wirthwein,
& Steinmayr, 2014) and there is evidence to suggest that a reliable OE
scale, such as the ElemenOE, can assist in effectively screening gifted
students who were not identified by traditional methods such as an IQ
test (Bouchard, 2004). The scale can also be used to complement other
methods in providing effective counseling for children and adults with
gifted intelligence (Mendaglio & Tillier, 2006). Other theories involving
the role of overexcitabilities in both human and animal models have
been proposed, including that of the intense world theory (IWT) in
those with ASD (Markram & Markram, 2010).
4.2. Psychological overexcitabilities: affective disorders and ADHD
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, participants with very superior (130 and
above) intelligence were significantly prone to rumination leading to
mood disorders, and worry leading to anxiety disorders. However, the
relationship between genius and madness is not a new notion. It is well
known that many historical intellectuals such as Leonardo da Vinci,
Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, and Pablo Picasso were plagued by
overexcitabilities leading to documented pervasive affective and mood
disturbances (Ehrenwald, 1984). Sir Isaac Newton viewed his gifted
creativity as a product of intense, prolonged rumination. He brooded
over past mistakes and worried excessively which eventually led him to
suffer a nervous breakdown in 1693 (Westfall, 1981). Those who sur-
round such individuals tend to be overwhelmed by their intense way of
seeing and feeling “too much.” This can lead to increased familial and
relational conflicts (Morawska & Sanders, 2009) and painful isolation
from peers (Gallagher, 1958), causing a crisis of self as they attempt to
minimize their responses to better adapt and fit in with, the vast sta-
tistical majority around them who possess an average IQ. This struggle
begins from a young age and, given that IQ remains relatively constant
can continue for a lifetime.
There are various theories about which neurological mechanisms
and processes are involved in developing mood disorders in those with
hyper brains. The field of PNI points us to one of the better-understood
and most likely networks that may be at play. That being the impact
that environmental and psychological stress has on the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly stress that is chronic as op-
posed to brief. The HPA readies the body for a “fight, flight, or freeze”
response in times of stress. It does not distinguish between real or
perceived threats. If there is chronic activation of this system, it

 contributes to wear and tear on the body and organs (McEwen, 2000). It
is possible that the overexcitabilities present in those with a high cog-
nitive ability and the chronic mental activation which they experience
in response to their environment may continually activate the HPA axis.
These chronic stress-induced brain-immune interactions reduce the
ability of the immune system to do its vital work. The brain (nervous
system) regularly cross talks with, and has a measurable effect on, the
strength of the immune system. It stands to reason that a hyper brain
(high IQ), with its overexcitabilities, could be miscommunicating these
perceived stressors/threats more often and more intensely than the
general population. The studies that point to the overexcitabilities ex-
perienced by the intellectually gifted, as well as those that find high IQ
to be associated with negative mental and immunological health out-
comes, lend credibility to this relatively new line of research and to our
hyper brain/hyper body theory.
It has been demonstrated in the literature that an overconnectivity
of local brain networks facilitates rumination. For example, Anticevic
et al. (2012) used weighted network analysis to measure connectivity in
depressed participants and found that individuals with major depres-
sive disorder showed increased synchronization across all frequencies
of neural electrical activity. They were observed to have significantly
enhanced connections between most areas of the brain with electrical
signals that do not seem to shut off. Interestingly, the greatest degree of
heightened connectivity was found to be in the seat of cognitive ability,
the prefrontal cortex (Leuchter, Cook, Hunter, Cai, & Horvath, 2012).
Another theory points to the default network as an example of a highly
interconnected brain system. This network takes what is going on inside
of us and then uses that information to assess what is going on around
us, allowing us to envision the future and react according to our
judgments about our experiences (Hamilton, Farmer, Fogelman,
& Gotlib, 2015; Raichle et al., 2001). It is normally active when the
mind wanders off and then it shuts down when an individual starts
concentrating on a task. Those who have mood disorders seem to have
connections and networks that stay excitable instead of shutting down,
rendering their nervous system unable to fully relax (Anticevic et al.,
2012).
Depression and anxiety are found to be associated with a hyper-
inflammatory response via pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tian, Hou,
Li, & Yuan, 2014) indicating that intense and/or prolonged stress can
influence immunity. For example, Glaser et al. (1992) found among
medical students taking exams, that extreme stress and their perception
of social support affected their immune responses to the hepatitis B
vaccine. If medical students, who are extremely likely to possess a high
cognitive ability, produced weaker immune responses to a vaccine then
we might conclude these same individuals who are chronically stressed
would be slower to develop a proper immune response to various other
insults and pathogens as well (Padgett & Glaser, 2003). A similar result
was observed among those who were under chronic stress caring for a
spouse with Alzheimer's disease such that they displayed a poorer an-
tibody response to an influenza virus vaccine (Kiecolt-Glaser et al.,
1996). A potential role for brain cytokine elevations in depression has
been further confirmed in studies using rodent models of the disorder
showing that psychosocial stressors up-regulated expression of cyto-
kines in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (Audet, Jacobson-Pick,
Wann, & Anisman, 2011; Audet, Mangano, & Anisman, 2010). Among
the few studies examining brain cytokine variations associated with
depressive illness in humans, several were reported to be up-regulated
in the postmortem PFC of patients with major depression (Dean,
Tawadros, Scarr, & Gibbons, 2010; Shelton et al., 2011) and in post-
mortem PFC of teens that died by suicide (Pandey et al., 2012). Al-
though not all tissue had come from those who had a prior diagnosis of
major depression, we might strongly suppose that they more than
qualified as being depressed at the point in time when the suicide oc-
curred.
It has been demonstrated that mood and anxiety disorders precede
immune responses including allergies and/or asthma. In one such
study, a longitudinal cohort was followed for eight years to discover
potential associations between allergies and major depression. Findings
supported major depression as being associated with an increased risk
of developing non-food allergies, but results in the opposite direction
could not be confirmed. Thus the results of the study did not support the
hypothesis that a psychosocial impact of allergies increases the risk of
depression but instead concluded that the observed effect may be due to
shared genetic, epigenetic, or immunological responses that occur
during major depression (Patten & Williams, 2007; Patten, Williams,
Lavorato, & Eliasziw, 2009). The results of the present study point to
one genetic component to consider being that of high IQ.
Prevalence of ADHD was significantly greater in our high in-
telligence sample. Overall, for those with high cognitive ability there is
1.8 times the risk for being diagnosed with ADHD compared to the
national average. The psychomotor OE is especially important to
highlight in regards to the significant ADHD prevalence within our
sample. Our finding lends support to the potential problem of children
and adults possessing this particular overexcitability who may be likely
to be given an ADHD diagnosis which may interfere with also being
properly
identified
as
having
high
intelligence
(Nelson,
Rinn, & Hartnett, 2006; Rinn & Reynolds, 2012).

 and autoimmune disease in high cognitive capacity individuals which
lends weight to the hyper body component of the presently proposed
theory. Researchers have implicated inflammation as being at the
forefront of many of the above conditions and also of psychiatric dis-
orders (Couzin-Frankel, 2010; Slavich, 2015). It is known to contribute
to the onset and progression of immune disease, including allergic and
autoimmune diseases. Low-grade inflammation is distinct from acute
inflammation such as fever, infection, and swelling. It is a systematic
and long-term phenomenon that is more sensitive and susceptible to
stress (Känel et al., 2007; Rohleder, 2014). Alterations in the pro-in-
flammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα in rodents may indicate a patho-
physiological pathway from acute and chronic stress to the develop-
ment of depression. IL-1 and TNFα in the lungs can cause inflammation
and allergic and asthmatic reaction, and changes in IL-4 and IL-10 may
link acute and chronic stress to allergies and autoimmune diseases
(Himmerich et al., 2013). These atopic consequences have been ob-
served in those with affective disorders and also in those diagnosed
with ADHD. In a study of 8201 participants identified as having ADHD,
there was an increased prevalence of allergic diseases, including
asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and urticaria (hives), com-
pared with the control group. Lind, Nordin, Palmquist, and Nordin
(2014) looked at levels of stress, exhaustion, and anxiety of participants
and found that they reported higher prevalence of allergic asthma and
atopic dermatitis. Kovács, Stauder, and Szedmák (2003) found that
32.2% of those with allergies scored above normal levels of depression
with 12.5% reporting clinically significant depressive symptomatology.
Also found was that the higher the level of depression, the higher the
reported allergic symptomatology.
Prior research suggests an interplay between genetics and the environ-
ment in disorders involving immune dysregulation (Goines & Ashwood,
2013; Nevison, 2014). We know that identical twins are more likely to
suffer from the same autoimmune disease than fraternal twins (Wang,
Wang, & Gershwin, 2015). We also know that relatives of patients with
autoimmune diseases are at higher risk for development of the same or
another autoimmune disease which supports a genetic basis (Cárdenas-
Roldán, Rojas-Villarraga, & Anaya, 2013). That said, the concordance of
autoimmune disease in identical twins is often in the 25 to 40% range. This
supports the idea that the etiology of autoimmune disease likely involves
both genetic and environmental factors (Campbell, 2014; Mazmanian,
Round, & Kasper, 2008).
4.3.1. Immune and inflammatory dysregulation in ASD
The significant prevalence of ASD, especially of Asperger's, in our
sample with high intelligence, agrees with prior literature that has al-
ready demonstrated an association between high IQ and ASD in-
dividuals (Clark et al., 2016). Presently, the CDC estimates that one in
every 68 children (approximately 1%) are diagnosed with ASD
(Christensen et al., 2016). This is up exponentially from the 2–5 in
10,000 children recorded in the 1980s (Smalley, Asarnow, & Spence,
1988). Younger ages at diagnosis, differential migration, changes in
diagnostic criteria, and inclusion of milder cases can not fully explain
these observed increases (Hertz-Picciotto & Delwiche, 2009). We feel it
is relevant to consider this data, as it indicates the strong possibility of
one or more environmental factor(s) being introduced in the middle to
late 1980s when the ASD prevalence began to dramatically rise
(Nevison, 2014). This relates to the present study because it is known
that certain environmental triggers combined with a unique genetic
predisposition may launch immunological/inflammatory responses in
certain susceptible individuals (Rossignol & Frye, 2012). Researchers
are still trying to understand what that genetic component might be
which sets certain at-risk individuals apart from those who do not re-
spond in the same way to the same environmental insult(s). The results
of the present study suggest that one such plausible genetic component
to consider is that of high IQ which may be responsible for a hyper
physiological response to these insults and a resulting development of
ASD.
4.3.2. The intense world theory of overexcitability in ASD
In order to explain the overexcitabilities found in those with ASD,
Markram and Markram (2010) proposed the intense world theory
(IWT), a hyper-functioning of local neural microcircuits, characterized
by hyper-reactivity and hyper-plasticity. Much of the traditional autism
research has posited an intellectual disability in the form of mental
retardation or under-reactivity. However, Markham and his colleagues
could not find malfunctions in the inhibitory synapses, but did find too
many excitatory connections were being formed in the neocortex of
autistic animal models (Markram, Rinaldi, & Markram, 2007). In the
same study they discovered the circuit responded excessively when a
stimulus was introduced and that the synapses learned about the sti-
mulus much faster and more fluidly than normal. This excessive re-
activity and rapid memory formation of experiences are boosted by an
amplified emotional component. Further behavioral studies on autistic
animal models found that they developed excessive fear memories that
lasted longer than normal and were difficult to extinguish. These stu-
dies lend evidence pointing to an obsessive and detailed, overexcitable
processing of their world until the environment becomes so painfully
intense that they are forced to withdraw (Markram & Markram, 2010).
Like others with sensory overexcitabilities, stimuli that is undetectable
to most (e.g., clothing tags, common but unnatural sounds) may be
unbearable to an individual with autism. Velázquez and Galán (2013)
found that the brains of autistic children actually produce, on average,
42% more information when in a resting state than non-autistic chil-
dren, further suggesting a mental overload. Thus, according to the IWT,
and given what we know about high IQ having strong heritable/genetic
components which contribute to ASD (Asperger, 1944/1991; Clark
et al., 2016; Kanner, 1943, p. 249; Wheelwright & Baron-Cohen, 2001),
those with autism could actually be intellectually gifted individuals
who see and feel so intensely that they must engage in avoidance and
lock down behaviors in order to for them to escape.
Further research is needed to further confirm or discount the pos-
sibility of an association between high IQ, environmental insults, and
ASD. Researcher and pediatrician Dr. Michael J. Goldberg has sug-
gested that what we call ‘autism’ today is not the original Kanner's
autism at all (Kanner, 1943); rather it is Neuro-Immune Dysfunction
Syndromes (NIDS) which is a medical classification for illnesses or
disorders that may have psychiatric or developmental labels caused by
a complex neuro-immune illness, affecting cognitive and body functions
to which those with certain genetic profiles, such as high intelligence,
are more prone (Vargas, Nascimbene, Krishnan, Zimmerman, & Pardo,
2005). Ideally, immune regulation is an optimal balance of pro- and
anti-inflammatory response. It should zero in on inflammation with
force and then immediately return to a calm state. In those with the
overexcitabilities previously discussed, including in those with ASD,
this system appears to fail to achieve a balance and thus inflammatory
signals create a state of chronic activation. We can see consequences of
this dysregulation in the autistic brain that shows astroglial and mi-
croglial cells which are enlarged from chronic activation producing an
influx of pro-inflammatory signals (Morgan et al., 2010; Tetreault et al.,
2012). The genes involved appear to be switched on in response to an
antigen or trigger early in development, typically between one and
three years of age (Hallmayer et al., 2011). The autoimmune theory of
autism was investigated by surveying both families with autistic chil-
dren and those with healthy children regarding the prevalence of au-
toimmune (AI) disease in first-and second-degree relatives (Comi,
Zimmerman, Frye, Law, & Peeden, 1999). The authors found that the
frequency of disorders in the families with autism was higher than
controls, particularly among parents, and especially mothers, of autistic
children. Sweeten, Bowyer, Posey, Halberstadt, and McDougle (2003)
extended these findings by determining the frequency of AI disorders in
families that have probands with pervasive developmental disorders
(PDDs), including autism, and compared them with families who have a
child with an autoimmune disease, and those with a healthy child. They
found that autoimmunity was significantly increased in families with
R.I. Karpinski et al.
Intelligence xxx (xxxx) xxx–xxx
10
 PDD compared to those with AI disease and healthy control subjects
which is suggestive of a possible association between autism and AI
disease. An interesting finding of the study was the increase of auto-
immunity in grandmothers and uncles, and mothers and brothers of
PDD probands which points to a possible transmission of susceptibility
to AI disease from mother to son in the PDD families. This could prove
meaningful given that there is a significantly disproportionate pre-
valence of ASD in boys.
Maternal immune dysregulation in the form of an inflammatory
response to infection or an immune disorder, has been shown to be a
risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders in addition to correlating with
a later diagnosis of autism (Estes & McAllister, 2016). A Danish study,
which included nearly 700,000 births over a decade, concluded that a
mother's rheumatoid arthritis elevated a child's risk of developing ASD
by 80% and the presence of Celiac disease increased the risk 350%
(Abdallah et al., 2012; Atladóttir et al., 2009). Similarly, maternal in-
fection in the first and second trimester and the subsequent significant
immune activation, increases autism risk (Atladóttir et al., 2010) and
maternal immune activation is an environmental trigger, which has
been demonstrated in the lab to induce autism-like behavioral defects
in a mouse model (Malkova, Collin, Hsiao, Moore, & Patterson, 2012).
A recent magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study revealed
that certain autoimmune processes and neuronal network instability
can result in cingulate overactivation which induces regulatory in-
hibitory neuronal processes, resulting in autistic symptoms (Van Elst
et al., 2014). Findings support a potential role for dysregulated im-
munoregulatory process and neuroinflammation in the central nervous
system. Interestingly, the brain tissue of people with autism showed
signs of chronic inflammation in the same areas that exhibited excessive
growth. The brain areas that showed hyperproliferation in white matter
also
revealed
inflammation
and
increased
production
of
proin-
flammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines by neuroglia was found
(Morgan et al., 2010). Vargas et al. (2005) investigated the presence of
immune activation in postmortem brain specimens and CSF from sub-
jects with autism. The authors found marked active neuroinflammation
in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of brain tissue of those with
autism. This pro-inflammatory process was characterized by a marked
cellular activation of microglial and astroglial cells and displayed an
altered cytokine pattern. These results suggest that an aberrant immune
response in the neuroglia of autistic patients may influence neural
function and neural development that may contribute to the onset of
autism (Onore, Careaga, & Ashwood, 2012; Tetreault et al., 2012).
Like Kanner, recent research suggests a relationship between high
IQ and ASD and there are studies that have demonstrated that autism
and autoimmune dysfunction are closely related, however there have
been few to no studies that have looked at high cognitive ability as a
genetic risk factor for autoimmune dysregulation and resulting autistic
symptomatology. We have added to the literature by demonstrating
high cognitive ability as a significant and viable variable to be further
explored within the field of ASD research. Our present theory of high
intelligence as a risk factor for ASD could potentially be disproved if the
rate of national prevalence rises significantly beyond the percentage of
the population who possess a high cognitive ability. On the other hand,
if the rate of ASD levels off and remains at a prevalence comparable to
the number of individuals with high cognitive ability (2–3% of the
population) then it could feasibly lend further support to the HBHB
theory as it pertains to ASD.
4.4. Discrepancies among intelligence/health research
There are distinct patterns woven throughout the present results.
Based on our demographics, our findings do support prior research that
a higher cognitive capacity is predictive of positive outcomes such as
higher levels of both educational and financial attainment. However,
the following points are essential to consider when evaluating the
substantial amount of literature that links increased cognitive ability to
a decreased risk of negative physical and mental health outcomes and
may serve to offer explanations for the results of our study that seem to
contradict those of the popular high intelligence/high system integrity
research.
First and foremost, many of the often-cited studies only examine IQ
one standard deviation above or below the mean and thus, stop short of
including those with very superior (130 and above) intelligence (at or
above the 98th percentile) in their analysis. They report a higher risk
for negative mental and physical health outcomes in lower IQ and de-
creased risk with each increase in standard deviation. It is assumed that
this trend will continue upward and into the highly-gifted ranges as
well (a linear relationship). This is important to note because without
including those in the uppermost percentiles of intelligence (at or above
two standard deviations above the mean), results cannot be reliably
compared against those of the present study. Those we did find which
specifically looked at the upper percentiles of intelligence did find as-
sociations between mood and anxiety disorders, mania, low self esteem,
and the highest levels of IQ, specifically in those with high verbal
reasoning (Gale et al., 2013; Lancon et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2015). By
researchers not including those with gifted IQ in their samples, they
may be stopping short of discovering a possible curvilinear relationship
or a SLODR-like effect (Deary & Pagliari, 1991) such as ours seems to
suggest. If a curvilinear relationship exists, it is likely to manifest closer
to the second standard deviation above the mean and upward. Thus,
these often-cited studies would fail to observe such a relationship. In
comparison, MacCabe et al. (2010) found a non-linear association
among 900,000 Swedish students who received the lowest, but also
those who received the highest grades. Each was at greater risk of de-
veloping bipolar disorder as adults. Similarly, Gale et al. (2013) re-
ported that a ‘reversed-J’ shaped association was found in men with the
lowest intelligence and the men among the highest intelligence, pri-
marily those with the highest verbal or technical ability, being at the
greatest risk of being admitted with pure bipolar disorder. This suggests
that more studies should be conducted that specifically include those
among the top 2% of intelligence to verify if there is a curvilinear re-
lationship of intelligence to system integrity. Why might IQ and health
have a nonlinear relationship? As mentioned, our hyper brain / hyper
body theory posits that the overexcitabilities specific to those with high
intelligence may put these individuals at risk for hypersensitivity to
internal and/or external environmental events. The rumination and
worry that accompanies this heightened awareness may contribute to a
chronic pattern of fight, flight, or freeze responses which then launch a
cascade of immunological events.
Secondly, much of intelligence/psychiatric health studies are based
on psychiatric hospital admission records. While this can be a more
objective measure than self-report, it is only likely to include patients
with more severe forms of mental illness. Therefore, the relationship
found between intelligence and mental disorders in these datasets may
overlook those with milder cases of mental illness found among the
general population. Further, more severe forms of pathology can cause
cognitive impairment and actually mask true intellectual ability
(Bourne et al., 2013; Hammar & Ardal, 2009). Therefore, these studies
may be under reporting or missing numbers of those who also have an
unidentified, gifted intelligence.
Thirdly, in many studies the physical health disorders examined are
vastly different than those we analyzed in the present study which fo-
cused most specifically on those that are immunological in nature. For
example, most intelligence/health research includes important ques-
tions about conditions such as high blood pressure/hypertension, heart
disease, cancer and lung disease, general health such as sleep habits and
number of doctors visits, and overall fitness health including questions
about energy levels and mobility (Gottfredson, 2004; Lubinski, 1992).
The present study focused specifically on psychoneuroimmunological
processes among those with high intelligence. This makes a direct
comparison between much of the current intelligence/health studies
and ours impossible.
R.I. Karpinski et al.

 Finally, the subjective and inconsistent ways in which gifted IQ or
achievement is defined and/or quantified across studies must be con-
sidered. For example, those which use academic achievement measures
in lieu of cognitive tests may exclude those who are twice exceptional
which are those who are both highly gifted intellectually while having a
concurrent disability (e.g., executive function deficits such as working
memory difficulties, etc.) that masks their ability and which may pre-
vent them from achieving to their cognitive potential (Baum, 1989;
Belgan, 2005). Students such as these would likely not be included in
the studies looking at high intelligence. For example, it has been shown
that as many as 9% of those who receive special education services
(Barnard-Brak et al., 2009) and as many as 20% of those who drop out
of high school (Renzulli & Park, 2000) are intellectually gifted.
Of note, prior studies suggest a greater risk for some of the presently
examined conditions among those with higher verbal IQ specifically
(Clark et al., 2016; Coplan et al., 2006, 2012; Gale et al., 2013;
MacCabe et al., 2010; Penney et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2015) and for
those who lean toward creative fields such as art, poetry, music, and
theater (Simonton & Song, 2009) versus those who are gifted in quan-
titative reasoning (Brody & Benbow, 1986; Lubinski, 1992). Therefore,
any study that includes high intelligence but looks only at those gifted
in quantitative reasoning may miss a subset of those with high in-
telligence who may be at the greatest risk. Our study did not distinguish
between these subcategories but future research would likely benefit
from doing so.
4.5. Limitations
The present study enjoyed several strengths, such as reliable con-
firmation of intelligence scores at or above two standard deviations
above the mean, and substantial sample size. However, a few limita-
tions should be considered before strong conclusions may be drawn.
With the self-report, survey method there is often a risk of selective
recollection of data as well as potential over- or under-reporting.
However, there are numerous published, peer reviewed articles in
highly reputable journals that use a self-report method, including those
that use data sets which rely heavily on survey data (e.g., Der,
Batty, & Deary, 2009; Wraw et al., 2015; Wrulich et al., 2013). Ad-
ditionally, empirical research has confirmed that self-reported health
ratings
are
reliable
and
valid
measures
of
health
(Haapanen,
Miilunpalo, Pasanen, Oja, & Vuori, 1997; Liang, 1986). It is possible
that our participants perceived our interest in the various disorders and
responded positively to its presence more or less frequently. However,
given their higher than average educational and socioeconomic levels,
it is likely that our participants had more than adequate cognitive, fi-
nancial, and educational resources to properly assess and research their
symptoms in order to reliably self-report both diagnosed and suspected
medical conditions.
Although biases can creep into survey data, consistent and relevant
patterns can typically be observed, especially among large samples. Our
study benefited from a robust sample provided by American Mensa, Ltd.
that would be difficult to obtain had the design required us to in-
dividually test each participant ourselves. To be considered for inclu-
sion into Mensa, over 200 approved IQ tests are allowed to be sub-
mitted in lieu of being tested by Mensa directly. They also allow
applicants to provide prior, professionally administered test scores for
consideration. Ideally, our sample would include participants of both
high and average intelligence who have taken the same intelligence test
in order to get more comparative results, however doing so would have
limited the sample size significantly.
Lastly, prevalence type and age criteria within national average
figures tended to vary somewhat among various agencies and published
studies, making exact comparisons across studies more challenging. We
closely matched our prevalence type with those used by our national
comparison groups and are confident that the strong results herein
would likely absorb any minor discrepancies.
4.6. Future research
While the ideal would be to individually test all participants for IQ
we found no scientific data that would give reason to discredit Mensa
members in any country from being representative of those with high
cognitive ability. If, however, the present findings were to be exclusive
to the American Mensa population, it would be a worthwhile pursuit to
take a closer look at what may be unique about this group that would
cause them to report strikingly higher prevalence of the presently dis-
cussed disorders. Future work might also compare Mensa groups from
other countries to determine if there is consistency of results inter-
nationally. This study and the field of PNI as a whole would benefit
from research that examines the present variables in other high IQ
sample groups where reliable tests scores to differentiate are required,
such as in a prestigious university setting or the military, each which
would have their own uniquenesses to contribute.
Secondly, due to the strict guidelines set by Mensa for inclusion in
the Society, we were able to reliably confirm that participants fell
within the top 2% of intelligence. However, because exact scores were
not verified, it was difficult to look at within-group differences. A
possible way to further explore a curvilinear association is to distin-
guish between individuals at the second percentile from those who are
reliably tested to be in the top 1% of intelligence such as are found in
Intertel (the 99th percentile), or Triple Nine Society (99.9th percentile).
The literature would benefit from future studies that seek to examine
these unique within-group dynamics and differences.
Thirdly, consistent low-grade inflammation is considered a risk
factor
for
neurodegenerative
diseases
such
as
Parkinson's
and
Alzheimer's. Some recent work has shown that connectivity changes
(including hyperconnectivity) correlates with amyloid deposition (Yi
et al., 2015). Our initial data set includes information to be explored in
the future regarding reported prevalence of both of these diseases.
Finally, there is great promise in further investigating high IQ as a risk
factor for the present variables using well-designed animal studies. A vi-
able mouse model of high cognitive ability already exists. A team of sci-
entists led by Princeton neurobiologist Joe Z. Tsien set out to better un-
derstand human cognition by creating a strain of highly intelligent mice
they aptly named, “Doogie” after the teenage genius on the TV show,
Doogie Howser, MD (Tang et al., 1999). They designed these mice by
manipulating them to make more of the gene NR2B which encodes the
NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) nerve cell receptor, sometimes referred to
as the brain's “coincidence detector” (Tabone & Ramaswami, 2012). This
receptor is also said to play a key role in how memories are made
(Li & Tsien, 2009). The researchers were able to demonstrate that these
transgenic mice consistently made stronger connections, leading them to
learn and remember things significantly faster than normal mice (Han
et al., 2013). They also exhibited an unusual alertness and excitability,
more intense emotional memories of fearful experiences and they re-
membered them for a longer period of time (Wei, Wang, & Kerchner,
2001). Making associations and possessing a superior memory are each
reflected in the subtests of most measures of human intelligence and are
considered among the hallmarks of having a high cognitive ability. In
depth psychological and immunological studies using these mice would
likely yield promising results that may help further our understanding of
PNI processes specifically in those with high intelligence.
5. Conclusion
Tsien (2016) defines intelligence as, “the ability to self-discover
knowledge and patterns from a world full of uncertainties and infinite
possibilities,” whose mission it is to “solve various problems in their
natural and social environments in order to survive and thrive” (p. 2).
The highly intelligent individual has a remarkable capacity for seeing
and internalizing these vast uncertainties, possibilities, and problems.
This gift can either be a catalyst for empowerment and self-actualiza-
tion or it can be a predictor of dysregulation and debilitation as the

 present results suggest. If these individuals take in their world in such
an overexcitable manner intellectually (hyper brain), then the potential
exists for an intense level of physiological processing as well (hyper
body).
The hyper brain/hyper body theory is new and as such a number of
studies will need to be carried out to better understand its strengths and
limitations. Understanding the relationship between high intelligence and
illness could have a significant personal and societal impact. In this study,
we have presented a plausible, highly testable, theoretical framework that
hopes to serve as a springboard for future experimental designs across
disciplines. We have provided evidence to demonstrate that those with high
intelligence are at significantly greater risk for the examined psychological
disorders and physiological diseases; however, more work needs to be done
to demonstrate causation. With the recent advancement of the study of
intelligence using neuroimaging techniques and full-scale attempts to map
the genome combined with the newer research being conducted to better
understand psychoneuroimmunological processes, it is possible that we will
continue to see vital growth of our understanding in this understudied area.
Intelligence research most often focuses on the flashes of lightning seen in
this rare population, however in order to serve this group of individuals
fully, we must not neglect to acknowledge the rumbles of thunder that
follow in the wake of their brilliance.
