 and menopause, reproductive period, number of pregnancies, and use of hormones for 
contraception and menopausal symptoms. Multivariable linear regression evaluated associations 
between cognitive scores (dependent variable) and reproductive factors (independent variables), 
adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, income and education.
Results—On multivariable modeling, age at menarche ≥ 13 years of age was inversely associated 
with global cognition (p= 0.05). Last pregnancy after age 35 was positively associated with verbal 
memory (p=0.03). Use of hormonal contraceptives was positively associated with global cognition 
(p trend=0.04), and verbal memory (p trend=0.007). The association between hormonal 
contraceptive use and verbal memory and executive functions was strongest for more than 10 years 
of use. Reproductive period was positively associated with global cognition (p=0.04) and 
executive functions (p=0.04).
Conclusion—In this sample of healthy postmenopausal women, reproductive life events related 
to sex hormones, including earlier age at menarche, later age at last pregnancy, length of 
reproductive period, and use of oral contraceptives are positively related to aspects of cognition in 
later life.

INTRODUCTION
Estrogens play a key role in regulating neuronal biochemistry1–3 and brain function related 
to cognitive processes 2–6. Given the potent role of sex hormones on brain chemistry and 
function, the impact of the sex hormone milieu during reproductive life on mid- and late-life 
cognition in women has been a topic of interest.
Reproductive history is an important aspect of reproductive hormonal dynamics that women 
experience between menarche and menopause 7,8. Proxies for lifelong cumulative exposure 
to estrogen, including length of the reproductive period (from menarche to menopause), 
number of pregnancies, age at first pregnancy, and duration of breast feeding, have been 
evaluated in relation to late-life cognition 8–12. However, age at last pregnancy, which can be 
a marker of later surge of pregnancy-related hormones, has not been investigated in relation 
to cognitive functions. Older age at last pregnancy has been linked with elevated breast and 
reduced endometrial cancer risks 13–16. In addition to factors associated with endogenous 
sex hormones, exogenous hormones, particularly menopausal hormone therapy (HT), have 
been investigated in relation to cognitive function 11,17. However, the impact of hormonal 
contraceptive use on later-life cognition is not conclusive 9,12,18,19.
Studies evaluating the impact of reproductive history on later-life cognition have primarily 
focused on older postmenopausal women over the age of 60 years. Given recent evidence 
suggesting a cognitive decline during the menopausal transition 20, such associations should 
also be evaluated among younger postmenopausal women. While many studies have 
reported associations of reproductive period with cognitive outcomes 9–12, fewer have 
reported cognitive associations with other reproductive factors that are markers of hormonal

 exposures, including pregnancy history and use of hormonal contraceptives; even fewer 
studies have evaluated the joint effects of these variables in multivariable models 9,11,12. 
Furthermore, most such studies have used general screening tests for cognitive dysfunction, 
or a limited number of cognitive tests, as measures of cognitive function. 10,11 With these 
limitations in mind, we investigated the association of reproductive history including 
reproductive years, a detailed pregnancy history, hormonal contraceptive use, and use of 
menopausal hormone therapy with mid- and late-life cognition using a comprehensive 
cognitive battery in postmenopausal women, with an average age of 60 years, ranging from 
41–92 years of age.
METHODS
Design and Participants
We used baseline data from 830 naturally menopausal women who were participants in two 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, the Women’s Isoflavone Soy 
Health trial (WISH, conducted from April 2004 through March 2009) and the Early vs Late 
Intervention Trial of Estradiol (ELITE, conducted from June 2005 through February 2013). 
Details of the WISH and ELITE trial designs have been described 21,22. Postmenopausal 
women in the WISH trial were randomly assigned to daily 25 g soy protein or daily total 
milk protein matched placebo, while those in the ELITE study were randomly assigned to 
oral 17β-estradiol (1 mg daily) or matched placebo. Study participants in both trials were 
healthy postmenopausal women, currently non-smoking and HT non-users, free of 
cardiovascular disease or any other chronic disease conditions. Both WISH and ELITE trials 
were conducted at the Atherosclerosis Research Unit in the University at Southern 
California, Los Angeles, CA, applying almost identical study design, patient characteristics 
(demographic and clinical), and data collection methods. Hence we compiled the baseline 
data from both trial participants for this cross-sectional study.
Reproductive History
A detailed history on reproductive factors was collected from participant self-reports at 
baseline, using the same structured questionnaire that included uniformly worded questions 
to elicit age at menarche, date of and age at last menstrual period, total number of 
pregnancies (including miscarriages and abortions), age at first and last pregnancy, history 
and dates of hysterectomy and oophorectomy, and history of postmenopausal and 
contraceptive hormone therapy (ever use, duration of use, age of first and last use). Length 
of reproductive period was calculated as the years between ages at menarche and 
menopause. For trial eligibility, postmenopausal status was defined as a serum level of total 
estradiol (E2) <25 pg/ml and an absence of vaginal bleeding for at least six months (natural 
menopause) or bilateral oophorectomy (surgical menopause). Surgically menopausal women 
were excluded from the current study. While the women were not currently using any 
menopausal hormone therapy (HT) by trial eligibility, history of past HT use (ending at least 
1 month prior to trial randomization) was recorded at baseline.

 Cognitive Assessment
Cognitive skills assessed at baseline were used in the current study as the outcomes of 
interest. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery emphasizing standardized tests 
sensitive to age-associated change in middle-age and older adults were used for cognitive 
assessment 21,22. Neuropsychological tests and corresponding cognitive skills included 
Symbol Digit Modalities Test, complex scanning and visual tracking, attention, and 
psychomotor speed; Trail Making Test, Part B, visuomotor tracking, planning, cognitive 
flexibility, and psychomotor speed; Shipley Institute of Living Scale, Abstraction scale, 
concept formation; Letter-Number Sequencing, working memory, attention, and 
concentration; Block Design, visuospatial perception, nonverbal concept formation, 
planning, and visuoconstructive ability; Judgment of Line Orientation, visuospatial 
perception; animal naming, verbal fluency and semantic memory; Boston Naming Test, 
naming and semantic memory; California Verbal Learning Test, verbal episodic memory, 
word list learning and concept formation; East Boston Memory Test, verbal episodic 
memory and logical memory; and Faces I and II, visual episodic memory, memory for faces, 
and visuoperceptual processing. The verbal intelligence quotient was estimated with the 
Wechsler Test of Adult Reading.
In the current study, composite scores for verbal episodic memory, executive functions, and 
overall cognitive performance (global cognition) were the outcomes of interest. Details on 
the methods for obtaining the composite scores have been described 21. Briefly, each 
composite score was calculated as the average of component standardized scores weighted 
by the inverse inter-test correlation matrix. The verbal memory composite was defined a 
priori by California Verbal Learning Test and East Boston Memory Test immediate and 
delayed recall scores, and the global composite by scores from all neuropsychological 
measures. Tests used for the executive functions composite were determined by a principal 
components analysis of baseline scores; this composite used scores from the Symbol Digit 
Modalities Test, the Trail Making Test, the Shipley Abstraction scale, Letter-Number 
Sequencing, and category fluency.
Statistical Analysis
For the current analysis, dependent variables were the global composite cognitive score, and 
the verbal memory and executive functions composite scores. Reproductive history variables 
included age at first and last pregnancy, age at menarche, age at menopause, duration of 
reproductive period (age at menopause minus age at menarche), duration of use of hormonal 
contraception, ever pregnant, number of full-term and non full-term pregnancies, and past 
use of menopausal hormone therapy. Correlations between the reproductive variables were 
evaluated using Spearman correlation coefficients.
All cognitive outcome variables followed a normal distribution. Multivariable linear 
regression was used to evaluate the associations between cognitive scores (dependent 
variable) and reproductive factors (independent variables). Women with complete data 
contributed to the multivariable analyses. The categorization for the age at last pregnancy (≤ 
35 vs. > 35 years) was based on literature reporting lower risk of moderate or severe hot 
flashes among women with older age at last pregnancy compared to women who were 35

 years or less at their last pregnancy 23. Age at last pregnancy of 35 years also represented the 
75th percentile for the distribution of age at last pregnancy in our study participants. In a 
sensitivity analysis, age at last pregnancy was also analyzed as a continuous variable. 
Reproductive variables with p<0.15 on univariable models were selected as candidates for 
multivariable modeling. Age at cognitive testing, race or ethnicity, income and education 
were included in all multivariable models, as they were confounders of associations between 
the reproductive variables of interest and cognitive dependent variables. Years since 
menopause was not included in the multivariable models because of its strong correlation 
with age. The multivariable analysis was further stratified by age at cognitive assessment 
categorized as midlife (<60 years) vs later life (≥60 years) postmenopausal women. Formal 
tests of interaction were performed to evaluate the statistical significance of any interaction 
between the reproductive factors and age on cognitive outcomes. All statistical analyses used 
SAS 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
A total of 830 (324 WISH and 506 ELITE) postmenopausal women contributed to this 
analysis. The majority of the women were non-Hispanic white (67%), 40% were 10 years or 
more past menopause, with an average (SD) age at cognitive testing of 60 (6.9) years 
ranging from 41 to 92 years, with 16 (2.2) years of education (Table 1). Annual income was 
<$50,000 for 28%, $50,000 – $89,990 for 27%, and ≥$90,000 for 37% of the participants. 
The average ages at menarche and menopause were 13 (1.5) and 50 (4.6) years, respectively, 
with an average reproductive period of 37 (4.8) years. Sixteen percent of the women had 
never been pregnant, 47% had their first pregnancy before 24 years of age, and 21% had 
their last pregnancy after the age of 35 years. Seventy-nine percent of the women used 
hormonal contraceptives sometime during their reproductive lives, and 68% used HT. All 
cognitive composite outcomes were lower in women ≥ 60 years compared to women <60 
years old.
In univariate analysis, older age at menarche (≥13 years) was weakly associated with lower 
global cognition compared to women having menarche at <13 years of age (p = 0.08; Table 
2). Although age at menopause was not significantly associated with any of the cognitive 
outcomes, a longer reproductive period was associated with higher global cognition (p = 
0.019). Cognitive scores did not significantly differ by pregnancy status (ever vs. never 
pregnant). Relative to women who had 1 full-term pregnancy, women who had been 
pregnant with no full-term pregnancy or had 2 full-term pregnancies had higher global 
cognitive, verbal memory, and executive functions scores. Women reporting their first 
pregnancy at or after the age of 24 years had significantly better executive functions 
compared to women who had their first pregnancy before 24 years of age (p = 0.02). Women 
having their last pregnancy after the age of 35 years had significantly better global cognition 
(p = 0.02) and verbal memory (p = 0.008) scores compared to women with last pregnancy at 
or before 35 years of age. Compared to non-users, women using hormonal contraceptives for 
any length of time during their reproductive period had significantly better performance on 
all three cognitive measures (all p<0.001). Women with more than 10 years of hormonal 
contraceptive use benefited most cognitively compared to women with shorter duration (all 
p<0.001).

 We examined the correlation among the reproductive factors in order to avoid inclusion of 
variables with high collinearity in multivariable models. Chronological age was highly 
positively correlated with years since menopause (r = 0.79, p <0.001, Table 3); we therefore 
did not include years since menopause in multivariable models including chronological age. 
Length of reproductive period was strongly positively correlated with age at menopause (r = 
0.93, p <0.001), but was only moderately inversely correlated with age at menarche (r = 
−0.32, p <0.001). To evaluate the extent of overlap, the three cognitive outcome measures 
were correlated using Pearson’s correlation. Global cognition score was significantly 
positively associated with verbal memory and executive function scores (r = 0.74, 0.73, 
respectively; p-value for both <.0001). Verbal memory was significantly associated with 
executive function (r = 0.51, p-value <.0001).
Multivariable analysis included reproductive factors that were univariately associated with 
any of the cognitive outcomes at a significance level of ≤ 0.15; age, race or ethnicity, income 
and education were included as model covariates (Table 4). Age at menarche, age at last 
pregnancy, full term pregnancy status, reproductive period, and duration of hormonal 
contraception were significant independent correlates of one or more cognitive outcomes. 
Onset of menarche at or above 13 years of age was inversely associated with global 
weighted cognition (p = 0.05), but not with verbal memory or executive functions. Last 
pregnancy after the age of 35 years was significantly positively associated with verbal 
memory scores (p = 0.03), and with global cognition at borderline significance (p = 0.07), 
but not with executive functions. Age at last pregnancy was not associated with global (p = 
0.35) or verbal memory (p = 0.39) scores when analyzed as a continuous variable. Duration 
of hormonal contraceptive use was significantly positively associated with global cognitive 
score (p trend = 0.04), verbal memory (p trend = 0.007) and at borderline significance with 
executive functions (p trend = 0.06). The association between hormonal contraceptive use 
and verbal memory and executive functions was strongest for more than 10 years of use. The 
length of the reproductive period was significantly positively associated with global 
cognition (p = 0.04) and executive functions (p = 0.04). Multivariable models replacing age 
with years since menopause showed similar results (data not shown). Figure 1 displays the 
effect sizes for reproductive variables (age at menarche, age at last pregnancy, hormonal 
contraception use > 10 years, and length of reproductive period); the effect size was 
calculated as the beta estimate (Table 4) divided by the standard deviation (SD) of the 
corresponding cognitive outcome (Table 1). The effect sizes allow interpretation of the beta 
estimates on an SD metric (proportion of SD). For each cognitive composite score, 
multivariable adjusted means by reproductive factor groupings, along with the overall 
sample ranges and 5th, 95th percentiles, are provided in Supplementary Table S1.
Among women younger than 60 years on stratified analysis, age at menarche ≥ 13 years was 
inversely associated with global cognition at borderline significance (p=0.06), longer 
reproductive period was significantly positively associated with executive functions 
(p=0.02), and having no full term pregnancies was significantly positively associated with 
global cognition and verbal memory (Supplementary Table S2a). Among women 60 years or 
older, age at last pregnancy ≥ 35 years was positively associated with verbal memory, and 
hormonal contraception use was associated with verbal memory (p=0.002) (Supplementary 
Table S2b). In general, statistical tests for interaction indicated that the associations of the

 included reproductive factors with cognition did not differ in midlife and later life women (p 
for interaction > 0.05). Two exceptions to this generalization were: (1) the association of a 
non-full term pregnancy with verbal memory differed between the two age groups (p for 
interaction=0.01), with a positive association evident in midlife, but not in later life; (2) the 
positive association of reproductive period and executive functions differed between the two 
age groups with borderline significance (p for interaction=0.065), with a positive association 
evident in midlife but not in later life women.
DISCUSSION
Our data show significant associations of reproductive factors with midlife to late-life 
cognition among a reasonably large sample of healthy naturally postmenopausal women. In 
particular, later age at last pregnancy had a beneficial association with verbal and global 
cognitive performance in later life. We also documented a beneficial association of hormonal 
contraceptives with verbal and global cognition, as well as a beneficial association on 
executive function with more than 10 years of hormonal contraceptive use. Longer 
reproductive life was associated with better cognitive performance. All reproductive findings 
were mutually adjusted and controlled for several non-reproductive variables related to 
cognition.
Reproductive factors in women are considered a reflection of cumulative exposures to 
endogenous and exogenous sex steroid hormones. A considerable body of research indicates 
a significant role of sex steroid hormones, particularly estrogen, on cognition 2,3,17,22,24 and 
progesterone on neurogenesis 25. Accumulating evidence from neuroscience 2–6 and animal 
behavioral research provide a compelling rationale for the hypothesis that reproductive 
events have a long-term impact on cognition 26.
Years of reproductive capacity reflects duration of exposure to premenopausal levels of 
endogenous sex steroid hormones. Our results related to age at menarche and reproductive 
period are consistent with previous studies 8–12,27. The inverse association between later age 
of menarche and global cognition and positive association of reproductive period with global 
cognition and executive functions were evident with adjustment for reproductive events that 
alter hormonal levels. Although the reproductive period is a function of age at menarche, the 
associations of these factors with cognition were independent of each other. In a population-
based cohort of French women aged 65 and older, later menarche was inversely associated 
with visual memory and psychomotor speed, whereas longer reproductive period was 
positively associated with verbal fluency 12. The risk of cognitive impairment was increased 
with later menarche and younger menopause (but not with reproductive period) in a case-
control study among Swedish twin pairs aged 65–84 years 11. Our results indicate that 
earlier gonadal hormone exposures associated with earlier age at menarche may contribute 
to cognitive function later in life independently of its contribution to a longer reproductive 
period. In our sample, scores on the Wechsler Adult Reading Test were not correlated with 
age at menarche (r=−0.05, p=0.14), suggesting that this inverse association of age at 
menarche with cognition in later life does not merely reflect an association with genetic 
factors and early life exposures that influence cognitive abilities in adult life. Other studies

 also reported a positive association between longer reproductive period and cognition 9,10. 
Later menarche was also linked with increased risk of Alzheimer disease 28.
A last pregnancy after age 35 was positively associated with verbal memory and to some 
extent global cognition. This association was not evident when age at last pregnancy was 
modeled as a continuous variable, suggesting an age-specificity of this association. Although 
age at last pregnancy has been investigated in relation to other endogenous hormone-related 
conditions13–16, our findings in relation to cognitive function are novel. Both pregnancy and 
post-partum contribute robust changes in the sex steroid hormonal milieu. Pregnancy 
induces a tremendous surge in estradiol and progesterone levels 29 . Animal studies show 
improvement in learning and memory during pregnancy, post-partum, and even later 30–32. 
Human studies have failed to confirm these animal studies 33,34 and have even suggested 
impaired verbal memory 35, word fluency and word list learning 35 in pregnant compared to 
non-pregnant women. Few studies have evaluated long-term changes in cognitive function in 
relation to pregnancy. Animal studies show that transient hormonal during pregnancy induce 
neurogenesis in brain regions involved with cognition 36–38. Functional brain changes 
induced by reproductive experiences have been suggested to have lifelong effects 39, 
particularly in terms of improvement in memory and learning. Therefore, it is biologically 
plausible that a late pregnancy might offer protection from cognitive decline in later life. 
Alternatively, late pregnancy may reflect socioeconomic and lifestyle factors associated with 
better cognitive function. Our results were adjusted for race, education, and income, 
important components of socioeconomic status that are associated with both hormonal 
contraceptive use and cognitive performance.
Hormonal contraception, predominantly with oral contraceptives, was beneficially 
associated with global cognition, verbal memory, and executive functions. Only a handful of 
studies have evaluated oral contraceptive use in relation to late life cognition, with all 
reporting null associations 9–12,19. Prior studies were characterized by relatively small 
sample size9,19, limited neurocognitive assessment 10,11, low prevalence of hormonal 
contraception use 10–12, and lack of data on duration of use 9–12,19. Only one study among 
261 healthy middle-aged women (both pre- and postmenopausal) reported significant 
beneficial associations between longer duration of hormonal contraceptive use and cognition 
in the visuospatial domain and speed and flexibility 18. While it is possible that 
postmenopausal women who used hormonal contraception are different from non-users for 
reasons beyond the factors we adjusted for in our study (age, race, education and income), it 
is biologically plausible that hormonal contraception may beneficially impact cognition later 
in life. Hormonal contraception maintains a regular menstrual cycle, primarily through 
cyclical low levels of estrogen and progesterone, which in turn regulate other sex steroid 
hormone concentrations through the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis feedback 
mechanism and help to maintain a higher level of estrogen than normal state 40. Although 
the positive association between hormonal contraception and executive functions was 
nominally significant only among long-term users (>10 years), somewhat smaller positive 
associations were observed for shorter-term use. The trend test (for duration of use) was 
significant for verbal memory and near-significant (p=0.06) for executive functions. These 
findings may simply reflect a dose effect in both domains: larger cognitive effects with 
longer exposures. If so, we would then predict significant findings for executive functions

 for the shorter exposures, if our sample size were larger. It is difficult to compare the 
sensitivity, specificity, and precision of test instruments used to measure memory versus 
executive functions, and our data do not allow us to disentangle domain effects from 
measurement issues.
Our study adds significantly to the existing knowledge relating reproductive factors and mid- 
to late-life cognition. Our primary contribution lies in the multivariable modeling of several 
key reproductive factors in relation to different aspects of cognitive function obtained from 
an extensive battery of cognitive tests. In addition to domain-specific cognitive measures, we 
used a global composite measure to provide a robust indicator of the net cognitive effect, 
which in most instances would be most important clinically. Although composites of verbal 
episodic memory and executive functions were correlated with global cognition and with 
each other, these provide robust markers of domain-specific effects that are most often 
hypothesized to benefit from estrogen exposures, most often impacted during normal aging, 
and most often impaired early in the course of Alzheimer disease. Our finding of a 
significant beneficial association of later age at last pregnancy with verbal memory in later 
life is novel. Age at last pregnancy was not associated with executive function, which further 
justifies the use of a global composite score as it is possible that an exposure might enhance 
one aspect of cognition but have a neutral or deleterious effect on another. We also 
documented a beneficial duration-dependent association of hormonal contraceptive use on 
cognition, adding to the limited knowledge in this area. While almost all existing studies on 
this topic have been limited to women over the age of 60, our study population is unique in 
that almost half of the women were less than age 60.
Major strengths of our study include the large ethnically diverse sample of mid- to later life 
cognitively healthy postmenopausal women. All participants were evaluated with an 
extensive cognitive battery, with standardized collection of reproductive history through a 
structured questionnaire, allowing analysis of an array of reproductive factors in 
multivariable models. Collection of a broad array of other demographic and lifestyle 
variables allowed for control of many possible confounders.
Study limitations included reliance on self-reported recall rather than real-time assessment 
or other documentation of reproductive events. In addition, the study participants were 
volunteers in randomized clinical trials, and cannot be considered representative of the 
general population. Women in this study were well educated with relatively high income 
levels, and were sufficiently healthy to participate in a clinical trial. It is also possible that 
some degree of healthy volunteer bias contributed to study findings even after controlling for 
demographic factors. Results should therefore be interpreted with these cautions in mind.
In conclusion, in this sample of healthy postmenopausal women, reproductive life events 
related to sex hormones, including earlier age at menarche, later age at last pregnancy, length 
of reproductive period, and use of oral contraceptives were positively associated with 
multiple aspects of cognitive function in later life.
