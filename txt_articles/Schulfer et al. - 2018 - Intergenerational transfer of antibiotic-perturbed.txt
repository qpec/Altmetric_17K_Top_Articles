 Antibiotic exposure in children has been associated with the risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
(IBD). Since antibiotic use in children or in their pregnant mother can affect how the intestinal 
microbiome develops, we asked whether the transfer of an antibiotic-perturbed microbiota from 
mothers to their children could affect their risk of developing IBD. Here we demonstrate that 
germ-free adult pregnant mice inoculated with a gut microbial community shaped by antibiotic 
exposure transmitted their perturbed microbiota to their offspring with high fidelity. Without any 
direct or continued exposure to antibiotics, this dysbiotic microbiota in the offspring remained 
distinct from controls for at least 21 weeks. By using both IL-10-deficient and wild type mothers, 
we showed that both inoculum and genotype shape the microbiota populations in the offspring. 
Since IL10−/− mice are genetically susceptible to colitis, we could assess the risk due to maternal 
transmission of an antibiotic-perturbed microbiota. We found that the IL10−/− offspring that had 
received the perturbed gut microbiota developed markedly increased colitis. Taken together, our 
findings indicate that antibiotic exposure shaping the maternal gut microbiota has effects that 
extend to their offspring with both ecological and long-term disease consequences.
Introduction
Antibiotics have long-lasting consequences on the gut microbiota with the potential to 
impact host physiology and health.1–6 Antibiotic exposure has been associated with 
increased IBD risk5,7,8- notable since antibiotics are massively used worldwide9,10. 
Antibiotic use is extensive during pregnancy11,12, with reported rates of 42% in France, 40% 
in the US, 33% in the UK, and 24% in Finland.12–15 β-lactam antibiotics are the most 
widely used in pregnancy because of their presumed safety, with penicillins being the 
antibiotics most frequently used. However, little is known about the transgenerational impact 
of an antibiotic-perturbed microbiota. Because of the potential importance of 
intergenerational microbiota transmission16–18, we hypothesized that a maternally inherited 
antibiotic-perturbed microbiota affects the risk of experimental colitis in offspring.
We tested this hypothesis in IL-10-deficient (IL10−/−) mice, which spontaneously develop 
colitis. The colitis that IL10−/− mice develop requires microbial exposure;19 in germ-free 
conditions they are protected from disease.20 The IL10−/− mouse has been a well-
recognized model for chronic, immune-mediated colitis in humans since its first use in 
1993.19 It has been extensively studied because of its relevance to human IBD and 
dependence on resident intestinal bacteria to stimulate effector TH1 and TH17 immune 
responses.20,21 Many of the features of the model, including pancolitis, small intestinal 
involvement in certain housing conditions, transmural inflammation, crypt hyperplasia, 
goblet cell depletion, infiltration of the lamina propria with activated T and B cells, a TH1/ 
Th17 cytokine profile, development of dysbiosis and a chronic progressive course, mimic 
clinical, pathologic, microbial and immunologic changes that occur in human ulcerative 
colitis and Crohn’s disease.22,23 On this basis, we performed studies to determine the 
consequences of maternal transmission of a perturbed microbiota in this model. By 
introducing antibiotic-perturbed or control microbiota to germ-free pregnant mice, we could 
ensure that we were examining the effects of the founding microbiota on properties in the 
offspring, without the interference of antibiotic treatment of their mothers. In this model 
system, we asked two major questions: (i) what was the fidelity of the transfer from the

 inocula to the dam, and then to the pups over an extended period of time; and (ii) did the 
microbiota in the antibiotic-perturbed inoculum confer enhanced risk of colitis in the pups 
more than 5 months after birth?
Results
Characterizing the inocula and microbiota changes with passage in the dams
To investigate the role of an antibiotic-altered microbiome on colitis development, we sought 
to expose both wild type and IL10−/− mice to antibiotic-altered microbiota as early in life as 
possible; with both IL10−/− and wild type (WT) dams and two inocula, four groups of mice 
were studied (Figure 1a). We began the experiment with germ-free pregnant mice, 
conventionalizing them ~1 week before delivery with the specified inocula, facilitating 
transfer to their pups at birth. The inocula had been obtained at sacrifice from female 
C57BL/6 mice that had prolonged exposure to subtherapeutic levels of penicillin (STAT), or 
not (Control), which had been generated previously by pooling 3 donors for each inoculum2 
(Figure 1ai). Pooling allowed us to create one inoculum for each treatment group and 
generate a large study cohort, though it may have limited the variability that is likely seen in 
humans. To maintain dietary consistency with the donor mice and thus reduce stress on the 
microbial community, all mice were maintained on a 45% high fat diet (HFD) for the 
entirety of the experiment.
The STAT inoculum had fewer OTUs and a remodeled community composition and 
structure (Supplementary Figure 1a–b), with relative taxa abundance differences including 
decreased Erysipelotrichi and increased Verrucomicrobiae, consistent with prior 
observations2 (Supplementary Figure 1c). The microbial communities 1-day-post-gavage in 
the dams were similar (Figure 1bi), but by 4-days-post-gavage, each group became distinct 
(Figure 1bii; Supplementary Table 1), remaining so through pregnancy, nursing, and post-
weaning (Figure 1bi–v). Over time, the communities shifted in parallel toward the original 
inocula (seen along PC1 in PCoA analysis; Supplementary Figure 1b), but both the founding 
populations (along PC3) and host genotype (along PC2) significantly determined the 
bacterial community structure (Supplementary Figure 2; Supplementary Figure 3a; 
Supplementary Table 2). Thus, we show that both host genotype and the composition of the 
founding microbiota determine microbial community composition and structure over time in 
animals that have inherited their microbiota.
Effects of mouse passage on the community dynamics
For pups, the first fecal samples (age 3-weeks) showed close resemblance to their dams 
(Figure 1biii), indicating that gavage of pregnant germ-free dams is effective for introducing 
particular inocula to pups at birth. The four groups determined by inoculum and host 
genotype were distinct, remaining consistently so to week 21 (Figure 1biii–v, Supplementary 
Table 1).
Since reduced microbial diversity is associated with IBD24 and other illnesses, we examined 
the effects of inoculum, host genotype, and mouse generation on community richness (α-
diversity). After gavage, α-diversity dropped markedly in all groups with partial recovery

 within 4 days, and with stabilization by 7 days (Supplementary Figure 3b–d; Supplementary 
Table 3). Although the STAT and Control inocula were similarly diverse, α-diversity became 
lower in those dams receiving the STAT than the Control inoculum, continuing throughout 
the experiment (Supplementary Figure 3b–d; Supplementary Table 3). These trends were 
due to rapid community succession, as a few opportunists (Lactococcus, Turicibacter, and 
Staphylococcus) bloomed immediately after transfer, then were outcompeted by the usual 
resident microbiota (Supplementary Figure 1c, Supplementary Discussion).
Next, we assessed the effects of the transfers on community stability. We found that OTU 
loss was greater in the intergenerational transfer from the dams that had received STAT 
microbiota than in those that received Control microbiota, and the response varied by 
genotype (Figure 2a, Supplementary Figure 4a, Supplementary Table 7). Mouse genotype 
played a role; transfer was more complete in IL10−/− mice (Figure 2a, Supplementary 
Figure 4a, Supplementary Figure 5, Supplementary Table 7, Supplementary Table 10, 
Supplementary Notes). We hypothesize this more complete transfer may be due to there 
being more extensive niches for colonization in a host with a defective immune system, 
although ultimately it is not clear why IL10−/− mice had richer microbial colonization from 
the inoculum. By Jaccard analysis of pairs of samples, there was instability in the dam 
microbiota for the first days post-gavage (highest Jaccard indices), mostly stabilizing by 4-
days-post-gavage (Figure 2b). By 4-weeks-post-gavage, both dam and pup microbiota 
stabilized; yet the STAT pups had greater variation over time than Controls (Figure 2b–c, 
Supplementary Table 4). Thus, after immediate short-term community instability in the 
dams, the dams and pups were colonized with a mostly stable microbiota, highly resembling 
the inoculum. We show that the inheritance of a perturbed microbiota leads to increased 
instability of community composition in a later generation, with loss of richness.
Specific taxa were nearly identically represented in the Control WT pups and their dams 
(Supplementary Figure 4b); however, for both inocula, Akkermansia was more abundant in 
dams than their pups (Supplementary Figure 4c, Supplementary Table 8). Populations in 
Control pups were more similar to their inoculum than were STAT pups, respectively, by 
both Jaccard Index (Supplementary Figure 4d, Supplementary Table 9), and as a percent of 
shared OTUs (Supplementary Figure 4a, Supplementary Table 7), indicative of higher 
transfer fidelity. In total, mouse genotype influences community structure after inoculation, 
with specific taxa differing in propensity for intergenerational transfer.
Effects of treatment and host genotype on the metagenome
To assess the differential selection associated with founding inoculum and host genotype, 
fecal samples from 3-week-old pups underwent shotgun sequencing to identify 
metagenomic effects. Analysis of Bray-Curtis distances of the metagenomic data showed 
significantly separated groups, except amongst the WT mice (Supplementary Figure 6a). 
Metagenomic analysis also permitted identification and fine scale resolution of specific taxa 
that were differentially present in the Control and STAT pups (Supplementary Figure 6b). 
There were many parallel changes in KEGG pathways in the IL10−/− compared to WT mice 
for the recipients of the STAT and Control microbiota (Supplementary Figure 6c); such 
conservation suggests genotype-specific selection for function. In particular, the pathways

 over-represented in WT STAT mice include ones involved with branched chain amino acids 
(BCAA), similar to an earlier observation25, whereas in the IL10−/− mice, many differences 
were identified that we have not seen reported elsewhere (Supplementary Figure 6d–e). This 
is potentially significant because BCAA have been associated with differential risk for auto-
immune and metabolic diseases including type 1 diabetes as well as type 2 diabetes and 
obesity.26–29 The abundance of antibiotic-resistance genes was similar in the inocula from 
the Control and STAT mice (Supplementary Figure 6f). However, in the pups, abundance of 
resistance genes was lower in the recipients of the STAT microbiota than the Control 
microbiota, in both of the mouse backgrounds, and significant (p< 0.01) in the wild type 
mice. These findings suggest that without further antibiotic pressure, selection in STAT mice 
favored the growth of transferred organisms without resistance determinants (i.e. greater 
fitness in the absence of selection). While unexpected, there are several possible 
explanations for this finding (See Supplementary Discussion). The metagenomic analysis 
also revealed a significant enrichment of genes involved in the Sulfate Reduction I pathway 
in IL10−/− STAT pups, which has been associated with both Akkermansia muciniphila and 
colonic dysfunction (Supplementary Figure 7, Supplementary Notes).30,31 In total, both the 
maternal inocula and the host genotype led to differential metagenomic gene and pathway 
effects.
Effect of inoculum on characteristics of the pups
Finally, we examined the effects on host properties of receiving the transferred microbiota. 
Confirming prior reports32, bone mineral content and density were decreased in IL10−/− 
compared to WT mice (Supplementary Figure 8a–b, Supplementary Table 11). However, 
body composition was not affected by inoculum, differing from prior studies2,33, which 
might be related to dietary differences between the studies.
To determine the role of the antibiotic-altered microbiota on IBD development, we collected 
intestinal samples before the onset of severe weight loss, rectal prolapse, or bloody stool 
which often appear by week 26.34 The highest incidence of UC and CD occurs in 15–30 
year-old young adults, but can occur at any age; 26-week old mice are adult.23 IL10−/− mice 
in the C57BL/6J background develop less aggressive IBD than in other genetic backgrounds,
35 consistent with the low IBD histology activity index (HAI) we observed for the IL10−/− 
Control pups. However, even without apparent illness, the IL10−/− STAT pups had IBD 
lesions (colonic inflammation with lamina propria mononuclear cell infiltration, mucosal 
hyperplasia, dysplasia) at week 6 of life, with progressively increasing severity; as expected, 
the WT mice had no lesions (Figure 3a). In the 21-week-old IL10−/− mice, the mean IBD 
HAI was 55-fold higher (p<0.0001) in pups inheriting the STAT vs. Control microbiota 
(Figure 3b, Supplementary Table 5). Across all ages, based on HAI, the antibiotic-altered 
microbiota led to more severe inflammatory disease than the Control microbiota (Odds ratio 
20.5 (CI 6.5 – 64.1) in IL10−/− pups) (Figure 3b, Supplementary Figure 9a, Supplementary 
Table 5). Using calprotectin and lipocalin-2, biomarkers of colonic inflammation in both 
human and murine IBD,36,37 temporal patterns of colitis development paralleled the 
observed histopathology (Figure 3c–d, Supplementary Table 5), with differences between 
the recipients of the two inocula most pronounced at week 21 (Figure 3a inset). We show

 that inheritance of an antibiotic-perturbed microbiota is not only faithfully recapitulated in 
the next generation, but that it confers added disease risk.
In analyses using a panel of 547 mouse genes related to immunity and inflammation, we 
found that the IL10−/− mice showed increased colonic expression of Granzyme A, MHC 
Class II, Tnf, Ccl2, and Cxcl10 and decreased CD36, CD163, and IL15 compared to WT 
(Supplementary Figure 9b, Supplementary Table 12), consistent with prior studies38. 
Amongst the IL10−/− mice, the Control and STAT groups showed differential intestinal gene 
expression; 10 of the 12 significantly differential immune genes (Figure 3e, Supplementary 
Table 6) were decreased in the STAT pups, consistent with our prior studies.2 The IL10−/− 
STAT mice also showed elevated colonic IFN-γ expression (Figure 3f, Supplementary Table 
5), a hallmark of IL10−/− colitis.19 These histologic, immunologic, and gene expression 
findings indicate that conventionalization of the IL10−/− mothers with the antibiotic-
perturbed microbiota led to enhanced colitis in their offspring during adulthood.
Relationship between taxa and host phenotypes
We next used LEfSe and Random Forest modeling to determine which taxa could be 
important in the phenotypes we have characterized. Although these bioinformatic tools are 
insufficient to determine the significance of taxa without further experimental validation, 
they can identify candidates for further study.39 By LEfSe analyses, only two genera 
(Bacteroides and Odoribacter) more abundant in the STAT than the Control inoculum 
(Supplementary Figure 10ai) also were more abundant in the pre-inflammation pup samples. 
Five other taxa (Supplementary Figure 10aii) including Blautia producta, Staphylococcus, 
and Lachnospiraceae, were more abundant in the pre-colitis IL10−/− STAT pups, and might 
be considered as disease-promoting candidates.
Nine taxa were more abundant in the Control than the STAT inoculum (Supplementary 
Figure 10aiii); for seven (including Lactobacillus reuteri and Allobaculum), differences 
persisted in the pups. Nine other taxa had consistently increased abundance in the IL10−/− 
Control pups (including Bilophila, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus) (Supplementary Figure 
10aiv). These 16 taxa, more abundant in Controls, might have disease-protecting roles.
Similarly, we used supervised learning to identify taxa predictive of high level HAI in the 
IL10−/− mice at week 21 (Supplementary Figure 10b). From samples obtained ≥5 weeks 
post-gavage, Random Forest modeling identified five OTUs (within Bilophila, 
Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillus reuteri, Ruminococcus, and Bacteroidales S24-7) that highly 
predicted HAI scores. Four other OTUs (Rikenellaceae, Lactobacillus, Allobaculum, and 
Roseburia) were predictive mostly before weaning. Thus, while LEfSe and Random Forest 
modeling use different approaches, both analyses indicated that Bilophila, Lactobacillus 
reuteri, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and Allobaculum were associated with protection against 
IBD onset, with the opposite for Odoribacter, Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae, and 
Rikenellaceae.

 Discussion
These results show that exposing pregnant germ-free mice to specified inocula allows the 
high fidelity transmission of the taxa to the dams over a period of weeks and to their pups 
over months. Fidelity was maintained despite housing the mice in a conventional facility in 
which mouse-adapted strains are circulating and which could invade the test mice. 
Nevertheless, it is clear that the control inoculum was better maintained in the recipients 
than was the STAT inoculum, which showed both loss of taxa and lower stability in Jaccard 
analyses. We also show that host genotype matters, with the IL10−/− (immunodeficient) 
mice more permissive for the transmission of the original inocula. A very recently published 
study, using a different study design in the IL10−/− model in which broad spectrum 
antibiotics were directly given to pregnant dams, provides evidence similar to our findings40, 
and the results of these studies together can be used to benchmark future studies of transfers 
to pregnant germ-free recipients.
By transferring microbes rather than treating mothers with antibiotics, we have shown in this 
model system that the antibiotic-perturbed microbiota, not the antibiotic itself, was 
responsible for the accelerated disease onset, measured during development and at sacrifice. 
We show that the biological effects in the next generation are exclusively due to the effects 
of antibiotic perturbation of the microbiota in a prior generation. These findings are 
consistent with associations between early-life antibiotic exposures and enhanced IBD risk 
in human children5, but move the exposure to the prior generation, mirroring allergy and 
asthma studies in Finnish children.15,41 Further, since the early-life microbiota may be 
critical for proper immunological development,42,43 perturbation may have important health 
consequences. We note that these studies are in a model system in mice with many 
differences from human biology, but the simplicity of the study design with only two 
variables—inoculum and genotype—with a single test diet and mouse strain background, 
and appropriate inoculum and genotype controls permits robust hypothesis testing. In further 
studies it will be important to test whether the accelerated colitis onset phenotype in mice 
with the STAT microbiota can be rescued with a microbiota transplant. Multiple variables 
will need to be considered in these studies including timing of the microbiota transplantation 
and the source and composition of the donor microbiota.Studies of present-day human 
children,44–46 and across hominid evolution,16 provide strong evidence of vertical 
transmission of intestinal taxa. Given the importance of founding bacterial populations that 
we show, the high-fidelity transmission that we observed becomes a useful tool for 
understanding inheritance in IBD and other inflammatory conditions. The extent of the 
inherited susceptibility to IBD that is due to human genes versus the intergenerational 
transfer of microbes (and their genes) should now be more closely examined. Our findings 
also are consistent with a multi-generational model of microbiome perturbation due to 
nutritional stress.18 As such, this model can be used to identify specific taxa as potentially 
disease-promoting or disease-protecting in future studies. Understanding these relationships 
is a biologically complex problem, involving multiple time points and multiple taxa. We 
have developed a first approximation of important taxa by identifying several in which the 
results of the analyses at different time points and across models have yielded consistent 
data. These might be considered to be especially strong candidates for playing causal roles.

 As noted in the results, these include Odoribacter, Bacteroides, Lachnospiraceae, Blautia, 
and Rikenellaceae species. These taxa have been identified in prior studies in models of IBD 
development and in human subjects.40,47,48 The metagenomic studies also point to a 
potentially critical injurious role of one taxon Akkermansia mucinophila, and an important 
metabolic pathway, leading to H2S production. However, it may be unlikely that any single 
taxon will play a crucial role. It is also possible that the major factor in the development of 
disease is the loss of protective organisms, such as Roseburia, Ruminococcus, and Bilophila, 
a role for which also is supported by the literature.49,50 Of course, an important caveat of 
human IBD studies is they typically examine patients with existing IBD and their respective 
controls. In those studies, it is not possible to determine causal relationships since 
differences observed could be causal, an effect of the disease, and/or an effect of the 
treatments. The taxa that we identified as differential in our studies must be considered only 
as preliminary candidates, whose importance must be tested in definitive experiments.
In total, these findings provide evidence that the founding inoculum, host genotype, and 
intergenerational transfer all may affect intestinal microbial community structure and 
composition in interacting ways. That antibiotic impact on the gut microbiota could 
potentially affect disease susceptibility for more than one generation is possibly relevant to 
the large proportion of women receiving antibiotics before and during pregnancy.11,12
Methods
Animals
All animal experiments were conducted according to protocols approved by the New York 
University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). 
After mice were received from the National Gnotobiotic Rodent Resource Center (NGRRC), 
University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, they were maintained on irradiated high fat diet 
(HFD, Rodent Diet D12451i, Research Diets, 45% kcal%).
Microbiota Inoculum Preparation
Wild type C57BL/6 mice were raised to 18 weeks of age with sub-therapeutic levels of 
penicillin in their drinking water (STAT) or not (Control). Cecal contents were collected 
from 3 Control and 3 STAT penicillin female mice that were fed a high fat diet (HFD, 
Rodent Diet D12451i, Research Diets, 45% kcal%), as has been described.2 Following 
euthanasia, 1 set of flame-sterilized instruments were used to open the visceral wall, and a 
second set of flame-sterilized instruments were used to collect 1/3 of the cecal content from 
each mouse which were immediately placed in 1 mL pre-reduced liquid dental anaerobic 
transport medium (Anaerobe Systems, Morgan Hill, CA). Contents were homogenized in an 
anaerobic environment, tissue removed, pooled according to experimental group (total 3 ml) 
and diluted with 5 mL of pre-reduced anaerobically sterilized saline (Anaerobe Systems, 
Morgan Hill, CA). This inoculum was stored in 1 mL aliquots at −80°C until use.
We used a pool rather than individual mice because we could only realistically perform one 
transfer, since the experiment involved 4 groups of mice (2 genotypes, 2 inocula) 
representing 16 litters and 135 mice studied in all (and 1137 samples). Also, importantly, the

 intestinal microbiota shows individual variation, even in genetically identical mice that are 
housed in the same cage. In order to generate a representative microbiota from our control 
and antibiotic-treated mice, we selected the three mice with the weights closest to the 
median.
Microbiota Transfer into Pregnant Germ-Free Mice
Pregnant germ-free adult mice ≥8 weeks of age (wild-type C57BL/6J and IL10−/− C57BL/
6J), received from the NGRRC ~14 days after mating plugs were detected, acclimated to the 
NYU animal facility overnight in their sterilized shipping containers. Control and STAT 
murine inocula, which had been frozen at −80°C2, were allowed to thaw, and the mice were 
briefly restrained while 250 μl of Control or STAT inoculum was placed into their stomach 
by oral gavage. Recipient mice were chosen randomly and inoculations alternated between 
Control and STAT with glove changes between each. Immediately after gavage, a fecal 
sample was collected from each mouse. There was no amplification of the 16S rRNA gene 
in any of these samples, confirming their germ-free status. Mice were then housed 
individually in autoclaved cages. We aimed to have 5 litters per group to produce at least 15 
mice per group for statistical significance. All mice were maintained on a 45% high fat diet 
(HFD, Research Diets D12451i) as the donor mice were receiving this diet before they were 
sacrificed to create the cecal inocula.2 Dams gave birth 6.8 ± 2.3 days after gavage. Five 
IL10−/− dams were gavaged with each inoculum and all 10 litters survived. Of 12 WT dams 
gavaged, in six cases, the mothers ate their pups shortly after birth (3/7 given the Control 
inoculum, and 3/5 receiving the STAT inoculum). Fecal pellets and scale weights were 
collected daily from the dams for the first week post-gavage.
Maintenance of the Pups
The dams were left undisturbed after giving birth until their pups were 21 days old, except 
for the IL10−/− dams, which were weighed and fecal pellets obtained on days 4 and 11 post-
partum. After the pups reached 21 days, dams and pups were weighed and fecal pellets 
obtained 1–5 times per week. After weaning, pups were housed 4 per cage with other pups 
from the same inoculum and genotype group (WT Control with WT Control, WT STAT with 
WT STAT, etc). Both sexes were studied. Cage assignments were random within each 
inoculum and genotype group to minimize litter/cage differences on the microbiome. Dams 
were sacrificed 2–3 weeks after pups were weaned. All 35 WT pups were sacrificed at 21 
weeks of age. Subgroups of IL10−/− pups were sacrificed at 6 (n=24), 14 (n=27), and 21 
(n=26) weeks of age.
Histopathology
At sacrifice, tissues were collected as described,51 fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin, 
routinely processed, and paraffin-embedded. Colon samples were sectioned and stained with 
hemotoxylin and eosin (H&E), coded, and scored by a board-certified veterinary pathologist 
(A.B.R.) who was blinded to experimental status. These samples were scored according to a 
previously established histopathologic grading scheme for experimental colitis51 with scores 
of 0–4 given for each of three categories – inflammation, hyperplasia, and dysplasia. A total 
histology activity index (HAI) was calculated by combining these three separate values.

 Sections from 10–14 mice were scored in each group, means were calculated and tested for 
statistical significance using Kruskall-Wallis with Dunn’s post-test.
Odds Ratio Calculation
The severity score of the disease status of the gut of the mice was scored on a scale of 0–6 in 
11 response categories (Supplementary Figure 9a). A Proportional Odds model52 was used 
to fit a common-slopes cumulative model, which is a parallel lines regression model based 
on the cumulative probabilities of the response categories rather than on their individual 
probabilities. The cumulative model has the form: g(Pr(Y ≤ I | x)) = αi + β’x, i=k,…,k 
where g is the logit link function, αi,…, αk are k intercept parameters, and β is the vector of 
slope parameters. Based on this model, treatment effects can be represented as the Odds 
Ratio (OR) of going to the next level in the disease score of treatment versus Control.

DNA was extracted from frozen fecal, cecal, and ileal samples using the MO BIO PowerSoil 
DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO, Carlsbad, CA) in the 96-well format. The 16S rRNA gene was 
amplified with barcoded fusion primers targeting the V4 region, as described.53 Amplicon 
pools were sequenced on the Illumina Miseq platform with 150 bp paired-end reads. The 
QIIME pipeline54 was used for downstream analysis.
Bioinformatic Analysis
Paired end reads were joined using fastq-join from EA-utils55 with a minimum overlap of 30 
base pairs. Only reads that were perfectly matched in this overlapping region were kept. 
Sequences were demultiplexed and quality filtered with QIIME. If a read had more than 3 
consecutive low quality bases (phred q score ≤ 20) it would be truncated, and any read that 
ended up being <75% of its original length was discarded. Sequences were assigned 
taxonomy with the open reference method in QIIME using UCLUST56 and the Green Genes 
2013 May database release as a reference.57 Samples with less than 5000 reads were 
removed from the dataset. This dataset was then used to generate relative abundance plots, 
calculate alpha diversity, and measure UniFrac distances to generate PCoA plots. Linear 
discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe)39 was used to detect significantly differential taxa 
between various pairings of groups. To reduce the number of features the dataset was filtered 
to exclude any taxa that accounted for 0.01% or less of the total observation count. The 
average sequencing depth for this study was 15,564. As such, 0.01% abundance represents 
only about 1–2 reads/sample. Although there are low abundance taxa that could be relevant, 
they were considered to be below the detection threshold of the current study, since single 
reads may represent sequencing artifacts. Significance thresholds were retained as the 
default LEfSe settings.
Whole genome sequencing
Fecal samples from 4 female pups from each group at 3 weeks of life were chosen for 
metagenomic study, along with each inoculum. Extracted genomic DNA (2 ng) from each 
sample was used for library preparation and subsequent WGS using the Illumina HiSeq 
2500 platform. Samples were sequenced over 4 flow cell lanes as 100-bp paired-end reads.

 The metagenomes were pre-processed for quality metrics by removing nucleotides with a 
Phred score < 20 and reads shorter than 60bp using Trimmomatic.58 Next sequences were 
aligned to the mouse (mm10) genome to reduce host-contaminated sequences using 
KneadData. After filtering low quality and contaminated sequences, we performed 
functional profiling to detect microbial genes and pathways using HUMAnN2 v0.9.5,59 with 
default settings and screened against the EC-filtered UniRef90 database. All metagenomes 
have been deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and are available at the 
European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), under the project ID PRJEB18627.
Intergenerational transfer heatmap
Relative abundances of filtered OTUs were plotted in a heatmap grouped by mouse genotype 
and treatment over selected timepoints. Heatmap was generated using custom R scripts and 
the following packages: biom, phyloseq, qiimer.60–62
Jaccard Index Analyses
Pairwise Jaccard distances were generated between each pair of samples for each pup, dam 
and inoculum sample, using the vegan R-package63 and the parameter binary = T. Plots were 
created using the levelplot function found within the lattice R-package. Summarized heat 
maps were generated using the median distance across all sample groups for each group. 
Boxplots were generated using the median consecutive pairwise Jaccard distance, by 
comparing each pup sample to its previous sample, over time. For each mouse, the median 
Jaccard values were calculated by comparing between dam, pup and inoculum groups. The 
distribution of values was assessed by the pairwise Wilcoxon test with Holm correction for 
statistical analysis.
Supervised classification of histopathology results
Random forest classification models were built to predict high (1+) vs. low (<1) HAI 
histology scores (class) as a function of the microbial community OTU relative abundances 
(features), for each examined week of pup life, as described.33 Models were built by 
growing 1,000 trees per forest and model error was calculated using a 10-fold cross 
validation approach. All samples were randomly subsampled at 5000 OTU/sample prior to 
analysis to avoid bias from uneven sampling efforts. Subsampling and analysis was 
performed in 10 independent trials that were then used to calculate mean model error and 
OTU importance. At all time points, the model had substantially better than random (error 
ratio >2) predictive power. The same strategy was used to predict inoculum (class) as a 
function of microbial community (features).
Quantitation of fecal lipocalin-2 and calprotectin by ELISA
Frozen fecal samples were vortexed with PBS to obtain a homogenous suspension. Samples 
were then centrifuged for 10 min at 9,500 g, at 4°C. Supernatants were collected and stored 
at −80°C until analysis. Lipocalin-2 levels were estimated in the supernatants using Duoset 
murine lipocalin-2 ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Calprotectin levels were 
estimated in the supernatants using the S100A9/Calprotectin mouse ELISA kit (Hycult 
Biotech, Plymouth Meeting, PA).37 Both were standardized to total protein, as determined

 using measured with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, 
MA).
Gene Expression Studies
Colon, cecum and small intestine tissues were obtained at sacrifice, rinsed, and stored in 
RNA later for 24 hours at 4°C. Tissues were then placed in a new tube and stored at −80 
until RNA could be extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA).
Nanostring
Colonic expression of a panel of immune genes was measured in 21-week-old WT and 
IL10−/− mice whose mothers had received either the STAT or Control inoculum (4 groups, 
n=3/group). Assays were performed using the nCounter Gene Expression Mouse 
Immunology Kit (NanoString Technologies, Seattle WA).
QPCR
RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with the Verso cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo 
Scientific). QPCR was performed on a LightCycler 480 ii (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) using 
LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master. Specific mouse oligonucleotides were used to 
measure IFN-γ (5′-CGGCACAGTCATTGAAAGCC-3′ and 5′-
TGTCACCATCCTTTTGCCAGT-3′) and TNF-α (5′-GTTCTGCAAAGGGAGAGTGG-3′ 
and 5′-GCACCTCAGGGAAGAGTCT-3′). Relative expression of these genes was 
calibrated to the 18S rRNA endogenous Control gene (5′-
CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG-3′ and 5′-GTAACCCGTTGAACCCCATT-3′) and 
analyzed with the comparative CT (ΔΔCT) method to calculate the fold-differences in 
expression between Control and STAT IL10−/− pups.
Body Composition Measurements
Body composition was assessed at ~4 week intervals beginning when the pups were weaned 
at 4 weeks of age. Body composition was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry 
(DEXA) with a Lunar PIXImus II mouse densitometer (GE Medical Systems, Waukesha 
WI) with anesthesia by isofluorane inhalation.
Statistical Analyses
Values were expressed as mean ± SEM or SD, as noted in figure legends. Analyses were 
performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., Ca, USA). A one-way ANOVA 
with Sidak’s multiple comparison test or unpaired two-tailed students t-test was used to 
analyze parametric data while nonparametric data were analyzed with a Mann-Whitney U 
test.
