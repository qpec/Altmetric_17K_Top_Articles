IMPORTANCE Metronidazole hydrochloride has historically been considered first-line therapy
for patients with mild to moderate Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) but is inferior to
vancomycin hydrochloride for clinical cure. The choice of therapy may likewise have
substantial consequences on other downstream outcomes, such as recurrence and mortality,
although these secondary outcomes have been less studied.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the risk of recurrence and all-cause 30-day mortality among patients
receiving metronidazole or vancomycin for the treatment of mild to moderate and severe CDI.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective, propensity-matched cohort study
evaluated patients treated for CDI, defined as a positive laboratory test result for the
presence of C difficile toxins or toxin genes in a stool sample, in the US Department of
Veterans Affairs health care system from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012. Data
analysis was performed from February 7, 2015, through November 22, 2016.
EXPOSURES Treatment with vancomycin or metronidazole.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The outcomes of interest in this study were CDI recurrence
and all-cause 30-day mortality. Recurrence was defined as a second positive laboratory test
result within 8 weeks of the initial CDI diagnosis. All-cause 30-day mortality was defined as
death from any cause within 30 days of the initial CDI diagnosis.
RESULTS A total of 47 471 patients (mean [SD] age, 68.8 [13.3] years; 1947 women [4.1%] and
45 524 men [95.9%]) developed CDI, were treated with vancomycin or metronidazole, and
met criteria for entry into the study. Of 47 147 eligible first treatment episodes, 2068 (4.4%)
were with vancomycin. Those 2068 patients were matched to 8069 patients in the
metronidazole group for a total of 10 137 included patients. Subcohorts were constructed that
comprised 5452 patients with mild to moderate disease and 3130 patients with severe
disease. There were no differences in the risk of recurrence between patients treated with
vancomycin vs those treated with metronidazole in any of the disease severity cohorts.
Among patients in the any severity cohort, those who were treated with vancomycin were
less likely to die (adjusted relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.98; adjusted risk difference,
–0.02; 95% CI, –0.03 to –0.01). No significant difference was found in the risk of mortality
between treatment groups among patients with mild to moderate CDI, but vancomycin
significantly reduced the risk of all-cause 30-day mortality among patients with severe CDI
(adjusted relative risk, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.97; adjusted risk difference, –0.04; 95% CI,
–0.07 to –0.01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Recurrence rates were similar among patients treated with
vancomycin and metronidazole. However, the risk of 30-day mortality was significantly
reduced among patients who received vancomycin. Our findings may further justify the use
of vancomycin as initial therapy for severe CDI.

D
uring the past 2 decades, Clostridium difficile infec-
tion (CDI) has progressed from a relatively uncom-
mon hospital-acquired infection to a major contribu-
tortomorbidityandmortalityinsideandoutsidethehospital.1-5
In2011,therewereapproximately450 000incidentand83 000
recurrent CDIs in the United States,6 many of which were man-
aged by primary care physicians in the outpatient setting. The
treatment of CDI is largely guideline driven.7-9 Current guide-
lines recommend metronidazole hydrochloride as initial
therapy for most cases of mild to moderate CDI. Although an
early clinical trial found no difference in cure rates between
vancomycin hydrochloride and metronidazole,10 subse-
quent observational data and clinical trials suggest that met-
ronidazole is inferior to vancomycin for primary clinical cure,
especially in severe cases.11-13 Most recently, an analysis of mir-
ror trials by Johnson et al11 found that patients treated with
metronidazole had a nearly 10% lower probability of achiev-
ingcurethanpatientstreatedwithvancomycin(81.1%vs72.7%;
P = .02).
Beyond the question of clinical cure, important down-
stream outcomes, such as recurrence and mortality, should be
taken into consideration when choosing an initial therapy.
Clostridium difficile infection is a serious infection that sig-
nificantly affects the quality of patients’lives.14 Recurrence of
CDI after successful resolution of the initial episode occurs in
approximately 15% to 50% of patients depending on patient
factors, such as age and immune status.11,15 Rates of all-cause
30-day mortality as high as 38% have been reported.16
Although evidence is mixed,11,15 clinical trial data suggest that
metronidazole and vancomycin may result in similar rates of
recurrence.11,12 Risk of mortality after treatment is not well
understood, but one small study17 indicates that patients who
receive vancomycin may have lower rates of all-cause mortal-
ity vs patients receiving metronidazole (7.4% vs 13.5%). How-
ever, our understanding of how treatment choice affects
downstream outcomes remains incomplete.
The objective of this study was to improve on the exist-
ing evidence by evaluating the risk of recurrence and all-
cause 30-day mortality among patients receiving metronida-
zole or vancomycin for the treatment of mild to moderate and
severe CDI in a multiyear comparative effectiveness study
within the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA
serves more than 5 million patients each year,18 providing ac-
cess to longitudinal data on an unprecedented number of CDI
cases in inpatient, long-term care, and outpatient settings. We
hypothesized that patients receiving vancomycin would have
better downstream outcomes than patients receiving metro-
nidazole regardless of CDI severity.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
We conducted a retrospective, propensity-matched cohort
study of patients treated for CDI in the VA Healthcare System
from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012. Data analy-
sis was performed from February 7, 2015, through November
22, 2016. Eligible patients included those with CDI as mea-
sured by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
laboratory–identified definition19 based on a laboratory test re-
sult that indicated the presence of C difficile toxin or toxin gene
in a stool sample. From 2005 through 2009, enzyme immu-
noassay was the predominant testing method. In 2010, one-
thirdofVAlaboratoriesusedpolymerasechainreactionalone,20
and by 2012 that number had increased to 59%.21 Patients were
excluded if they did not receive metronidazole or oral vanco-
mycin or if they received both metronidazole and oral vanco-
mycin within 2 days before or after CDI diagnosis. Patients
may have experienced more than one episode of CDI, and we
included only the first episode that met the study eligibility
criteria whether it was an incident or recurrent case. Infor-
mation was collected on patient demographics, comorbidi-
ties, health care utilization, CDI history, laboratory values,
and medication use from the Corporate Data Warehouse, the
VA’
s clinical data repository. Data were accessed through the
VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure.
This study was reviewed and approved by the University
of Utah Institutional Review Board and the Research and
Development Committee of the VA Salt Lake City Health Care
System. Waivers of consent and authorization were granted by
the University of Utah Institutional Review Board and the
Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Health Care System Research
and Development Committee. Study data were not
deidentified.
Study Data
The primary exposure in this study was treatment of CDI with
oral vancomycin or metronidazole. To capture all oral vanco-
mycin use, we identified and included intravenous vancomy-
cin compounded and administered orally. Analogous to an in-
tention-to-treat analysis in a randomized clinical trial,22,23
patients were classified according to the initial treatment they
received, defined as 2 days before or after the CDI diagnosis.
There was no minimum treatment duration. Inpatient treat-
ment data were obtained from the bar code medication ad-
ministration system.24 Outpatient treatment was identified
using pharmacy prescription fill data.
The outcomes of interest were recurrent CDI and all-
cause 30-day mortality. Recurrent CDI was defined as an-
other positive laboratory test result for C difficile more than
14 days but 56 days or fewer after the initial diagnosis date.25
Key Points
Question Does vancomycin hydrochloride result in fewer
recurrences or lower risk of mortality compared with
metronidazole hydrochloride for patients with Clostridium difficile
infection?
Findings In this propensity-matched cohort study, no difference
was found in the risk of recurrence between patients treated with
vancomycin vs metronidazole. Among patients with severe
infections, those treated with vancomycin had a significantly lower
risk of death than patients treated with metronidazole.
Meaning Vancomycin should be first-line therapy for patients
with severe C difficile infection.

All-cause30-daymortalitywasdefinedasdeathfromanycause
within 30 days of the CDI diagnosis. Death data were ob-
tained from the VA Vital Status file, which contains mortality
information from the Veterans Benefits Administration,
Social Security Administration, and Center for Medicare
& Medicaid Services.
Basic demographic and clinical information was ex-
tracted for each patient. Underlying comorbidity at baseline
was measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index–
Elixhauser score in the year before the CDI diagnosis.26 Inten-
sity of health care exposure was assessed using the number
of hospitalizations in the year before diagnosis. Characteris-
tics of the CDI episode collected included the episode type (pri-
mary incident, recurrent, or secondary incident), location of
diagnosis, and epidemiologic classification (community ac-
quired, health care acquired, or community-onset health care
associated).25 Severity of CDI was defined according to crite-
ria in the joint practice guidelines of the Society for Health-
care Epidemiology of America and the Infectious Diseases
Society of America (SHEA/IDSA).7 Patients with leukocytosis
(white blood cell count ≥15 000/μL [to convert to ×109/L,
multiplyby0.001])orelevatedserumcreatininelevel1.5times
or more than the baseline value (defined as the mean serum
creatinine value in the 90 days before CDI) within 4 days of
the CDI diagnosis date were considered to have severe CDI.
Patients with normal white blood cell counts and kidney func-
tion less than 1.5 times their baseline value were considered
to have mild to moderate CDI, and those without sufficient in-
formation to classify the severity of the episode were consid-
ered to have unknown severity. The use of other agents for the
treatment or prevention of CDI (rifaximin, nitazoxanide, or
toxin-binding compounds) was also recorded.
Statistical Analysis
To make the treatment groups as similar as possible, we used
propensity score matching. First, logistic regression was used
to estimate the probability of receiving vancomycin as a func-
tion of the following baseline characteristics: year of diagno-
sis, diagnosis in the intensive care unit, Charlson Comorbidity
Index–Elixhauser score, number of hospitalizations in the
past year, age, diagnosis in a health care facility, incident vs
recurrent episode, antibiotics at diagnosis, sepsis within the
past 7 days, and proton pump inhibitors, chemotherapy, or
immunosuppressive medications in the past 30 days. These
factors were chosen as candidate true confounders or risk fac-
tors for death or recurrence.27 Next, 3 separate propensity-
matched cohorts were generated by selecting up to 4 patients
in the metronidazole group for each patient in the vancomy-
cin group using a greedy matching algorithm and a caliper
width of 0.2 SD of the logit of the propensity score.28 The any
severity cohort contained all patients who were matched
regardless of severity. The second cohort comprised matched
patients with mild to moderate CDI, and the third cohort com-
prised matched patients with severe CDI. The distributions of
propensity scores before and after matching were visually
inspected to ensure a reasonable area of common support
(eFigure 1 through eFigure 6 in the Supplement). Balance
between treatment groups was assessed using standardized
differences and was considered similar if less than 0.10 (eFig-
ure 7 through eFigure 10 in the Supplement).
To determine whether treatment choice significantly
influenced the risk of recurrence or all-cause mortality, we
constructed a series of multivariable models. Relative risks
(RRs) and risk differences (RDs) for the effect of initial treat-
ment choice on recurrence and all-cause 30-day mortality
were estimated in each cohort separately using Poisson
regression with robust sandwich covariance estimation
(modified Poisson regression).29-31 All 6 models were fit
using generalized estimating equations assuming the inde-
pendent correlation structure to account for clustering of
patients within individual VA health care systems (stations).
The outcome models included the same covariates as the
propensity score model to improve the robustness of esti-
mates and increase precision. All analyses were preplanned.
Statistical procedures were performed using SAS statistical
software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc) except for the modi-
fied Poisson regressions, which were implemented in STATA
software, version 14 (StataCorp). All hypothesis tests assume
a 2-sided α = .05.
Results
From January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2012, a total of 47 471
patients (mean [SD] age, 68.8 [13.3] years; 1947 females [4.1%]
and 45 524 males [95.9%]) developed CDI, were treated with
vancomycin or metronidazole, and met criteria for entry into
the study (Figure 1). During the study period, the number of
first treated cases classified as severe decreased from 7432
(40.3%) in 2005 to 5138 (30.5%) in 2012. The number of pa-
tients treated with vancomycin increased from 147 (2.0%) in
2005 to 428 (8.3%) in 2012 (eFigure 11 in the Supplement). Of
those 47 471 patients with first eligible treatment episodes,
2068 (4.4%) received vancomycin as initial therapy. Vanco-
mycin was used among 1112 patients (4.4%) with mild to mod-
erate CDI, 630 (3.6%) with severe CDI, and 326 (6.8%) with CDI
of unknown severity.
Table 1 gives the baseline clinical and demographic char-
acteristics of patients for each treatment group by episode
severity cohort. Because of the 1:4 matching algorithm, 2068
patients (20.4%) in the any severity group, 1111 (20.4%) in the
mild to moderate group, and 629 (20.1%) in the severe group
received vancomycin. Overall, the propensity score matching
resulted in well-balanced cohorts. The use of nitazoxanide,
rifaximin, toxin-binding agents, and fidaxomicin was uncom-
mon, and use was similar between patients treated with van-
comycin and metronidazole for all severity groups (eTable in
the Supplement).
A total of 7449 of 45 661 patients (16.3%) presenting with
incident CDI and 191 of 837 patients (22.8%) presenting with
recurrent CDI developed recurrence. The unadjusted risks of
recurrence were similar between patients with mild to mod-
erate and severe CDI (Figure 2). The all-cause 30-day mortal-
ity rates were 10.2% for any severity CDI, 6.7% for mild to
moderate CDI, and 18.9% for severe CDI (Figure 2). A crude

vancomycin and metronidazole found no statistically or
clinically significant difference across all CDI severity groups.
Overall, patients who received vancomycin had a lower risk
of mortality compared with patients treated with metronida-
zole (8.6% vs 10.6%, P = .01).
This difference was largely driven by a 4.5% (15.3% vs
19.8%, P = .01) reduction in absolute risk of mortality among
patients with severe CDI being treated with vancomycin com-
paredwiththosetreatedwithmetronidazole.Therewasnosta-
tistically significant difference in the risk of mortality by treat-
ment group among patients with mild to moderate CDI (65 of
1111 [5.9%] for the vancomycin group vs 299 of 4341 [6.9%] for
the metronidazole group, P = .22).
Table 2 gives the results of the multivariable modified
Poisson regression models. Vancomycin did not reduce the
risk of recurrence compared with metronidazole among any
of the CDI severity subgroups. Among patients in the any
severity cohort, those who were treated with vancomycin
were less likely to die (adjusted RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74 to
0.98; adjusted RD, –0.02; 95% CI, –0.03 to –0.01). No signifi-
cant difference was found in the risk of mortality between
treatment groups among patients with mild to moderate
CDI, but vancomycin significantly reduced the risk of all-
cause 30-day mortality among patients with severe CDI (ad-
justed RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97; adjusted RD, –0.04; 95%
CI, –0.07 to –0.01). The number needed to treat with vanco-
mycin to prevent 1 death among patients with severe CDI is
approximately 25.
Discussion
Treatment of infections due to C difficile has changed remark-
ably little since it was first identified as the main pathogenic
cause of pseudomembranous colitis in the late 1970s.32 Al-
though vancomycin was the first agent found to be effective
for the treatment of CDI,33 metronidazole quickly became the
drug of choice because of concerns about the cost of branded
vancomycin tablets and the possible emergence of vancomy-
cin resistance among Enterococcus.34,35 Although early clini-
cal trial data indicated that metronidazole was noninferior to
vancomycinforthetreatmentofCDI,10furthertrialsfoundthat
vancomycin is superior to metronidazole,11 especially for se-
vere CDI.12 Evidence continues to emerge11-13 that primary cure
rates with metronidazole and vancomycin are lower than pre-
viously expected based on early trial data.10 However, the con-
sequences of these treatment failures are often overlooked and
underestimated. Specifically, downstream outcomes, such as
recurrence and mortality, are major concerns for patients with
CDI. Comparative effectiveness studies such as this one can
help to address this critical gap in our knowledge of CDI treat-
ment. We report the results of a large comparative effective-
ness study to evaluate treatment of CDI with metronidazole
or vancomycin and subsequent risk of recurrence and 30-day
all-cause mortality.
Recent qualitative work indicates that patients with CDI
live in persistent fear of developing recurrent infection.14

Approximately 16% of patients in our study developed recur-
rent infection, similar to the 15% to 35% reported in the
literature.36 Severity of CDI infection did not appear to influ-
ence the risk of recurrence, in contrast with another study12
that found that the risk of recurrence is greater among
patients with severe infections.
Clostridiumdifficileinfectiondisproportionatelyaffectspa-
tients with high comorbidity burden and immunocompromis-
ing conditions. As such, death is common among patients with
CDI. A previous systematic review16 suggests that approxi-
mately 26% of inpatients across 20 published studies died
within 30 days of a CDI diagnosis. In our study, mortality rates
were 6.8% for patients with mild to moderate CDI and 19.3%
for patients with severe CDI. One possible explanation for the
lower mortality estimates compared with published esti-
mates is the mix of low-mortality outpatients (2.6%) with
higher-mortality inpatients (14.3%) in our study.
We observed that patients with severe CDI treated with
vancomycin were approximately 20% less likely to die of any
cause within 30 days than patients treated with metronida-
zole. This RR reduction translates to an absolute risk reduc-
tion of 4% (95% CI, 1%-7%). Conversely, there was no differ-
ence in the risk of 30-day mortality between vancomycin and
metronidazole among patients with mild to moderate CDI. Al-
though existing evidence is limited, our findings are similar
to those of a study by Takahashi et al,17 which revealed that
mortality among patients with CDI treated with vancomycin
was approximately 6% lower than patients treated with met-
ronidazole (7.4% vs 13.5%).
Despite strong evidence and clinical practice guidelines to
support vancomycin treatment for severe CDI,7-9,11,12 it re-
mains an underused treatment option. In our study, 4% to 6%
of patients initially received vancomycin despite 42% of epi-
sodes being classified as severe. Notably, vancomycin use in-
creased over time, likely in response to the publication of the
trial by Zar et al12 in 2007 and the SHEA/IDSA guidelines rec-
ommending vancomycin for severe CDI in 2010.7 Despite the
increase in vancomycin use during the study period, half of the
patients with severe CDI did not receive vancomycin in 2012.
Our results are in accordance with previous findings, which in-
dicatethatvancomycinisusedin15%orlessofallpatientswith
CDI37,38 and that patients with severe CDI are no more likely
toreceivevancomycinthanpatientswithmildtomoderateCDI
unless an active antimicrobial stewardship protocol is in place
to give oral vancomycin to patients with severe CDI.38
Strengths and Limitations
Our study was observational in nature and as such is subject
to a number of limitations. Patients were not randomized to
treatment groups and therefore may have differed on impor-
tant characteristics that could have influenced their out-
comes. Although propensity score matching is an accessible

and useful tool to balance patients on measured confound-
ers, the possibility of unmeasured confounding remains.
Treatment for CDI can change over time, and we did not mea-
sure treatment changes that occurred outside the initial win-
dow, which could have resulted in misclassification of expo-
sure. However, only 7% of patients had a change in therapy
within 14 days after their CDI diagnosis. In addition, our
results are analogous to the familiar intention-to-treat analy-
ses and allow comparison of our findings with those reported
in clinical trials of CDI treatments. During the study period,
bar code medication administration capture may have been
imperfect, especially in the emergency department. Because
most patients received several days of treatment, we antici-
pate capturing most patients after admission or through out-
patient pharmacy records for those not admitted. Medications
received outside the VA system, including over-the-counter
medications, were not captured. Finally, our definition of CDI
(including recurrence) is based on the presence of a positive
laboratory test result for CDI, which may have resulted in the
inclusion of some patients colonized with C difficile without
clinically relevant infection or patients whose symptoms were
attributable to other conditions. However, all the patients in
our study received oral vancomycin or metronidazole within
2 days of their laboratory test, minimizing the likelihood of
including a large number of patients without true CDI. Detect-
ing test of cure is a concern with identifying recurrence. We
anticipate that test-of-cure rates would not differ between
patients treated with vancomycin vs metronidazole. We were
also unable to exclude polymerase chain reaction–positive,
toxin-negative patients, which may have contributed to mis-
classification and a possible underestimation of treatment
effects.
Our study also has a number of notable strengths. This is
the largest study to date to compare vancomycin and metro-
nidazole in a real-world setting and 1 of the few studies fo-
cused on downstream outcomes of CDI. Most cases of CDI oc-
cur outside the hospital, and information on CDI outcomes in
these settings is sparse. The VA health care system affords the
unique opportunity of following up a large number of pa-
tients with CDI in the inpatient, outpatient, or long-term care
settings across the nation. Unlike many smaller studies, the
largesamplesizeallowedustodetectsmallbutclinicallymean-
ingful differences in mortality between treatment groups.
Conclusions
Our results build on existing evidence that vancomycin may
be preferable to metronidazole, particularly for patients with
severe disease. Although the excess treatment costs of van-
comycin relative to metronidazole and the concern for van-
comycin-resistant Enterococcus will likely remain barriers,
improved clinical cure and mortality rates may warrant recon-
sideration of current prescribing practices. One approach to
minimizing the effects of increasing vancomycin use is to tar-
get vancomycin treatment to patients with severe disease.
Future research should focus on balancing improved
outcomes with economic and resistance considerations.
