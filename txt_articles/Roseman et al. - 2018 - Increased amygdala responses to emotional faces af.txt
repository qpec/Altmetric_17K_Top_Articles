Recent evidence indicates that psilocybin with psychological support may be effective for treating
depression. Some studies have found that patients with depression show heightened amygdala re-
sponses to fearful faces and there is reliable evidence that treatment with SSRIs attenuates amygdala
responses (Ma, 2015). We hypothesised that amygdala responses to emotional faces would be altered
post-treatment with psilocybin. In this open-label study, 20 individuals diagnosed with moderate to
severe, treatment-resistant depression, underwent two separate dosing sessions with psilocybin. Psy-
chological support was provided before, during and after these sessions and 19 completed fMRI scans
one week prior to the first session and one day after the second and last. Neutral, fearful and happy faces
were presented in the scanner and analyses focused on the amygdala. Group results revealed rapid and
enduring improvements in depressive symptoms post psilocybin. Increased responses to fearful and
happy faces were observed in the right amygdala post-treatment, and right amygdala increases to fearful
versus neutral faces were predictive of clinical improvements at 1-week. Psilocybin with psychological
support was associated with increased amygdala responses to emotional stimuli, an opposite effect to
previous findings with SSRIs. This suggests fundamental differences in these treatments’ therapeutic
actions, with SSRIs mitigating negative emotions and psilocybin allowing patients to confront and work
through them. Based on the present results, we propose that psilocybin with psychological support is a
treatment approach that potentially revives emotional responsiveness in depression, enabling patients to
reconnect with their emotions.

1. Introduction
Psychedelic therapy is a re-emerging paradigm in psychiatry
(dos Santos et al., 2016; Mithoefer et al., 2016). Unlike other psy-
chopharmacological treatment models that seek to medicate pa-
tients on a chronic basis, the psychedelic model seeks to treat core
psychological issues via a small number of profound and potentially
transformative psychological experiences (Pahnke et al., 1970;
Watts et al., 2017). Our recent open-label study of psilocybin with
psychological support for treatment-resistant depression (TRD)
yielded promising results, with all patients showing some reduc-
tion in depressive symptoms at 1 week and half meeting criteria for
remission at 3 weeks (Carhart-Harris et al., 2017). Furthermore,
other clinical studies with psilocybin have found reductions in
anxiety and depressive symptoms after psilocybin with psycho-
logical support (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016).
Psilocybin, a classic psychedelic and non-selective serotonin 2A
receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist, was discovered and marketed in the
1950s and 60s (Hofmann et al., 1958). After much early enthusiasm
about the therapeutic potential of psychedelics (Grinspoon and
Bakalar, 1979; Rucker et al., 2016), a politically-led about-turn in
the mid-1960s and early 1970s effectively ended all research with
these drugs, and it has only been in the last 10e15 years that clinical

 researchers have begun to work with them again. During this
renascent period, impressive results have been found for the
treatment of depression (Carhart-Harris et al., 2016; Os�
orio et al.,
2015), end of life anxiety (Gasser et al., 2014a; Griffiths et al.,
2016; Grob et al., 2011; Ross et al., 2016), obsessive compulsive
disorder (Moreno et al., 2006) and addiction (Bogenschutz and
Johnson, 2016).
The amygdala has previously been implicated in the patho-
physiology of depression (Drevets et al., 1992) as well as the action
of
some
antidepressants
(Ma,
2015)
and
psychedelics
(Kraehenmann et al., 2015; Spain et al., 2015). The amygdala is a
complex subcortical structure that is sensitive to emotional stimuli
(Janak and Tye, 2015; Sergerie et al., 2008). Functional MRI studies
of untreated clinically depressed patients have found amygdala
hyper-sensitivity to negative emotional stimuli (Drevets et al.,
1992; Ma, 2015), and treatment with SSRIs has been found to
attenuate this; both with chronic SSRI-use as well as early in
treatment, prior to the appearance of clinical improvements
(Godlewska et al., 2012).
Here, we sought to explore the antidepressant action of psilo-
cybin on amygdala responses to emotional faces using a functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm that has been well-
validated in the context of SSRI-based treatments for depression
(Ma, 2015). Patients underwent balanced versions of an emotional
faces paradigm before and one-day after treatment with psilocybin.
Psilocybin has been found to be associated with improved mood in
the sub-acute period days after exposure (Maji�
c et al., 2015). We
therefore predicted that amygdala responses to emotional faces
would be altered post-treatment and that this might relate to
changes in depression severity. We were particularly interested in
the fearful versus neutral faces contrast, due to previous findings of
reduced amygdala responses to negative emotional stimuli with
SSRIs (Ma, 2015). We also predicted that the nature of the acute
psychological experience under psilocybin would relate to the post-
treatment changes in amygdala responses.
2. Material and methods
This trial received a favourable opinion from the National
Research Ethics Service LondondWest London, was sponsored and
approved by Imperial College London and by the UK MHRA. All
participants provided written informed consent.
2.1. Design
The full study procedure is reported in (Carhart-Harris et al.,
2016). The inclusion criteria were major depression of a moderate
to severe degree (16 þ on the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating
scale [HAM-D]), and no improvement despite two adequate cour-
ses of antidepressant treatment (6 weeks minimum, each). The
patients were asked to be antidepressants-free for at least two
weeks before the study. Exclusion criteria were: current or previ-
ously diagnosed psychotic disorder; immediate family member
with a diagnosed psychotic disorder; medically significant condi-
tion rendering unsuitability for the study; history of serious suicide
attempts (requiring hospitalisation); history of mania; blood or
needle phobia; positive pregnancy test at screening or during the
study; and current drug or alcohol dependence. Psilocybin was
obtained from THC-pharm (Frankfurt, Germany) and formulated
into the investigational medicinal product (5 mg psilocybin in size
0 capsules). A week before the psilocybin session, patients attended
a preparatory session with their therapists. In this session patients
were invited to talk openly about their personal history (including
thoughts on the origins of their depression), discussed psilocybin's
psychological effects, and simulated aspects of the dosing session
itself, such as listening to a sample of the session music while
wearing eyeshades. The preparatory session typically lasted for 4 h,
with lunch and breaks provided. The sessions took place in a
decorated room with a relaxed atmosphere. The rationale behind
the first low dose session was to prepare patients to the high dose,
build rapport with the therapists, and test their willingness to “let-
go”. Twenty Patients underwent two psilocybin-assisted therapy
sessions, a week apart. The first involved a low (test) dose of psi-
locybin (10 mg, p.o.), and the second, a higher (therapeutic) dose
(25 mg, p.o). The high dose is comparable to the effective clinical
psilocybin doses used in Griffiths et al. (2016) (22 or 30 mg/70 kg)
and Ross et al. (2016) (0.3 mg/kg). The low dose produces attenu-
ated but still discernible perceptual and subjective effects (Griffiths
et al., 2011). The rationale behind the low dose session was as a
preparation for the high dose session, providing an opportunity to
build rapport with the therapists and help to reduce anxiety for the
high dose session. Post capsule ingestion, patients lay with eyes
closed while listening to music. Two therapists adopted a non-
directive, supportive approach. Baseline fMRI scanning was con-
ducted prior to any psychological or pharmacological interventions
and the post treatment fMRI scan occurred the morning after the
high dose psilocybin session, prior to any psychological integration
work. Scanning sessions took place at identical times of the day (i.e.
10:00am). Out of the initial 20 patients, 19 completed both scan-
ning sessions (6 females; mean age ¼ 44.7 ± 10.9; 27 to 64).
2.2. Anatomical scans
Imaging was performed on a 3T Siemens Tim Trio using a 12-
channel head coil at Imanova, London, UK. Anatomical images
were acquired using the ADNI-GO (Jack et al., 2008) recommended
MPRAGE
parameters
(1 mm
isotropic
voxels,
TR ¼ 2300ms,
TE ¼ 2.98ms, 160 sagittal slices, 256 � 256 in-plane FOV, flip
angle ¼ 9�, bandwidth ¼ 240 Hz/pixel, GRAPPA acceleration ¼ 2).
2.3. BOLD fMRI emotional faces images task
T2*-weighted echo-planar images (EPI) were acquired for the
functional scan using 3 mm isotropic voxels, TR ¼ 2000ms,
TE ¼ 31ms, 36 axial slices, 192 mm in-plane FOV, flip angle ¼ 80�,
bandwidth ¼ 2298 Hz/pixel, GRAPPA acceleration ¼ 2, number of
volumes ¼ 245. Patients used a mirror mounted on the head-coil
to view a screen mounted in the rear of the scanner bore, where
visual stimuli were back-projected through a wave-guide in the
rear wall of the scanner room. The emotional faces task was a
block-design task lasting 8 min. Patients were shown faces with
either fearful, happy, or neutral expressions, selected from the
Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces set (Goeleven et al., 2008).
An equal number of male and female faces were selected for the
task. Each face was presented on screen for 3 s, and five faces of
the same expression were presented in each 15 s block. Rest
blocks (also 15 s) were also included, and there were 8 repetitions
of each block type, presented in a pseudo-random sequence (32
blocks in total). Two versions of the task were used with one
presenting blocks in the reverse order to the other. Order of the
task versions on each scanning visit was counter-balanced across
patients. Patients passively viewed the faces but were instructed
to press a single button with their thumb with the presentation
of each new face, to confirm that they were paying attention to
the stimuli.
2.4. BOLD pre-processing
Four different but complementary imaging software packages
were used to analyse the fMRI data. Specifically, FMRIB Software

 Library (FSL) (Smith et al., 2004), AFNI (Cox, 1996), Freesurfer (Dale
et al., 1999) and Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS) (Avants
et al., 2009) were used. The following pre-processing stages were
performed: 1) motion correction (3dvolreg, AFNI) by registering
each volume to the volume most similar, in the least squares sense,
to all others (in-house code); 2) brain extraction (BET, FSL); 3) rigid
body registration to anatomical scans (BBR, FSL); 4) non-linear
registration to 2 mm MNI brain (Symmetric Normalization (SyN),
ANTS); 5) scrubbing (Power et al., 2012) e using a framewise
displacement (FD) threshold of 0.90 mm, which is a recommended
threshold for task fMRI (Siegel et al., 2014). No significant difference
in head movement (mean FD) was found between before and after
therapy scans (0.243 mm ± 0.116 and 0.248 mm ± 0.12, respectively,
p ¼ .815). The mean percentage of scrubbed volumes across sub-
jects (n ¼ 19) for the before scan was 2.3% ± 3.7 (range ¼ 0e15.1%),
and for the after scan, it was 2.3% ± 3.3 (range ¼ 0e11.8%). Scrubbed
volumes were replaced with the mean of the surrounding volumes;
6) spatial smoothing (FWHM) of 6 mm (3dBlurInMask, AFNI); 7)
high-pass filter of 0.01Hz; 8) regressing out 6 motion-related
nuisance regressors (3 translations, 3 rotations, high-pass filtered
with the same 0.01Hz filter).
2.5. ROI analysis
We used two different approaches to investigate changes of
amygdala activity. The first involved calculating mean amygdala
signal of left and right amygdala ROIs. The second involved vox-
elwise analysis within a bilateral amygdala mask (Harvard-Oxford
atlas, probability > 50%). For both approaches, a standard General
Linear Model (GLM) was used for the first analysis step, as
implemented in the FEAT module in FSL. Regressors derived from
the onset times of each stimulus condition were convolved with a
Gamma
function
in
order
to
simulate
the
Haemodynamic
Response Function (HRF). Pre-whitening (FILM) was applied to
correct for autocorrelations. Contrasts were defined that isolated
activity related to each stimulus condition (fearful, happy,
neutral) relative to the baseline, and also compared between two
stimulus
conditions,
as
appropriate
(fearful
>
neutral
and
happy > neutral) (Five contrasts in total). Two-tailed t-tests were
performed to compare before versus after treatment (before any
intervention and after the high dose) BOLD responses for the
mean ROI analysis and mixed-effects GLM (FLAME-1þ2) for the
voxelwise analysis. A statistical threshold of Z > 2.3, (cluster-
corrected for multiple comparisons with p < .05) was used for all
voxelwise analyses. A further voxelwise exploratory analysis was
carried out on the whole brain.
2.6. Relationship with clinical outcomes
The relationships with clinical outcomes were observed using
voxelwise analysis within a right amygdala mask (only the right
amygdala was chosen based on the first level results). For each
subject, a fixed-effects analysis was conducted to calculate the
difference between before versus after therapy (before any inter-
vention and after the high dose). A higher level mixed-effects GLM
(FLAME 1 þ 2) was used with the relevant clinical outcome as a
regressor of interest. In order to avoid multiple comparisons, we
chose only two clinical outcomes of interest: 1) the self-rated Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI) 1-week after therapy, criterion for
remission was � 9, which is based on a cut-off by Beck et al. (1988),
and criterion for treatment response was 50% reduction from
baseline e a consensus which has been validated by Riedel et al.
(2010); and 2) treatment response (50% reduction) based on in-
scanner ‘state’ rating (0e20) of depressed mood (baseline (before
treatment) compared with one-day after treatment). The in-
scanner ratings were taken immediately after the faces task and
thus, sample the depressed ‘state’ (compared to the BDI which asks
about the last two weeks). After viewing the imaging results we
decided to use post-hoc the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symp-
tomatology (QIDS) (Rush et al., 2003) at 1-day (concerning only the
time since the therapy session), 1-week, 2-weeks, 3-weeks, and 5-
weeks post-treatment. We chose to use QIDS as an extra scale to
measure depression and to strengthen the relationship between
changes in the amygdala and depression. QIDS was measured in
more time pointes then BDI and therefore allowed us to observe
how changes in the amygdala predict clinical outcomes in different
time points. Furthermore, as reduced anxiety was an important
clinical outcome in other psilocybin studies (Griffiths et al., 2016;
Ross et al., 2016), we looked also at relationship between anxiety
and amygdala changes. Anxiety was measured at the day of the
scan using the in-scanner rating, and 1 week after the scan using
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (Spielberger et al., 1970).
3. Results
3.1. ROI analysis
Increased post-treatment BOLD responses were observed in the
right amygdala for fearful (p ¼ .001) and happy faces (p ¼ .022),
with a trend effect for neutral faces (p ¼ .066) (Fig. 1). After cor-
recting for 10 tests (5 contrasts X 2 ROIs), only the increased re-
sponses to fearful faces remained significant. No significant result
was observed in the left amygdala (p ¼ .11, p ¼ .95 and p ¼ .2, for
fearful, happy and neutral faces, respectively). Voxelwise analysis
revealed significantly greater responses in the right amygdala post-
treatment for four contrasts: fearful, happy and neutral faces, plus
fearful > neutral faces (Fig. 2). Increases were in a consistent loca-
tion of the right amygdala.
3.2. Whole brain analysis
Whole brain analysis (Fig. 3) revealed that for the fearful,

 happy and neutral contrasts, in addition to increased BOLD re-
sponses in the amygdala, there were also increased responses in
other visual areas. Whole brain increases for fearful > neutral
were more limited to right amygdala and right middle temporal
gyrus however.
3.3. Relationship with clinical outcomes
The a priori defined primary imaging outcome of interest was
altered amygdala responses for fearful > neutral faces for after vs
before therapy. We hypothesized that the increased amygdala

 responsiveness was related to: 1) changes in state depression,
measured via in-scanner ratings of depressed mood, and 2) changes
in trait depression, measured via BDI scores at baseline and 1-week
after therapy. Other exploratory relationships are shown in Table 1.
3.3.1. In-scanner ratings
State depression (0e20) was rated by patients directly after
their 8-min faces scan. One day after psilocybin, 15 of 19 TRD pa-
tients (79%) showed a clinically meaningful response (in-scanner
rating; reduction from baseline � 50%) and treatment-response
was significantly related to increased amygdala responses to fear-
ful > neutral faces, with greater activations relating to better out-
comes (Table 1). Response rates in state anxiety (42.1%) did not
relate to changes in amygdala.
3.3.2. BDI
Change (10.2 ± 5.3), response (63.2%) and remission (57.9%) in
BDI scores at 1-week were significantly related to post-treatment
increases in amygdala responses to fearful > neutral faces, with
greater activations relating to better outcomes (Table 1).
3.3.3. QIDS
Response at 1-day (68.4%), 1-week (63.2%) and 3-weeks (63.2%)
were related to post-treatment increases in amygdala responses for
fearful > neutral faces, again, with greater activations relating to
better outcomes (Table 1). Response rates at 2-week (57.9%) and 5-
week (47.3%) did not relate to changes in amygdala response.
Furthermore, it can be observed that responders and remitters
had increased amygdala reactivity, while non-responders and non-
remitters had decreased amygdala reactivity to fearful > neutral.
3.3.4. Effect of relapse?
Thirteen subjects were responders 1-day after therapy and 9
maintained response 5 weeks after therapy. Therefore, we looked at
the difference in the amygdala response between the 4 ‘relapsed’
and the 9 non-relapsed subjects at 5 week and found no differences
in amygdala activation between these sub groups.
4. Discussion
Increased amygdala responses to emotional faces were observed
one day after treatment with psilocybin for treatment-resistant
depression. Post-treatment increases in amygdala responses to
fearful versus neutral faces were related to a successful clinical
outcome one week later.
Importantly, the present findings are in contrast to observations
of decreased amygdala responses after treatment with conven-
tional antidepressants and particularly with SSRIs (Ma, 2015). It has
been proposed that decreased amygdala responsiveness to negative
emotional stimuli under SSRIs is a key component of their thera-
peutic action (Harmer et al., 2017), but the present study's findings
suggest that this model does not extend to the therapeutic action of
psilocybin for TRD (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017).
Observations of
reduced
amygdala responses
to negative
emotional stimuli (Ma, 2015) and reduced behavioural response
biases to negative stimuli with conventional antidepressants
(Harmer et al., 2009) have been interpreted as evidence of a func-
tional remediation, linked to the correcting of negative cognitive
biases in depression. However, it is suggested that chronically-used
antidepressants have a more generalised effect on emotional pro-
cessing, moderating not just responsiveness to negative emotional
stimuli, but emotional stimuli more broadly (Price et al., 2009).
Focusing specifically on the amygdala, this structure is known to be
generally
sensitive
to
emotional
salience,
regardless
of
the
emotional valence of the stimuli (Adolphs, 2010; Santos et al.,
Table 1
Relationship between BOLD changes (after > before therapy; fearful > neutral) within the right amygdala and clinical outcomes. To avoid multiple comparisons, we hypothesized that amygdala changes would be related to two
main clinical outcomes BDI at 1 week and in-scanner depression ratings. Other comparisons should be considered exploratory (QIDS, STAI and in-scanner state anxiety). The “Type of score” column describes how the test was
done: Remission (BDI�9) and Response (>50% reduction) were used to split the group for remitters/non-remitters or responders/non-responders. The differences between responders and non-responders and remitters and non-
remitters are presented in the Max column which describe the z score in the Max voxel of difference, and the z scores of these categories separately are also reported in separate columns for the same voxel as in Max. The “Type of
score” “Change” is the difference in the rating for After-Before. The “Change” in BDI and the change in amygdala response were entered to a GLM. Note that clusters close to MNI_152 coordinates (x,y,z) of 18,0,-20 are reliable as
they survived cluster correction for few of the clinical outcomes. Furthermore, note that the significant clusters had reduced response for non-responders and non-remitters and enhanced response for responders and remitters.
Real cluster sizes may be larger as the clusters in this table are constrained by the amygdala mask. N ¼ 19.

 2011). It is possible that the notion that SSRIs have a selective action
on amygdala responses to negative stimuli is fallible, and rather,
SSRIs and related antidepressants have a more generalised muting
influence on amygdala responses to emotionally salient stimuli.
Relatedly, negative stimuli may be processed as especially salient,
and thus be associated with greater amygdala responses e which
are subsequently hyper-sensitive to intervention-led change.
Reduced amygdala responses to emotional stimuli after chronic
antidepressant medication has been linked with activation of post-
synaptic serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT1ARs), which have an
inhibitory action on pyramidal cell firing (Andrade, 2011) and are
densely expressed in the amygdala. While this mechanism has a
solid empirical basis (Cowen and Browning, 2015; Deakin and
Graeff, 1991), there is no known mechanism to explain how 5-
HT1AR-induced
attenuation
of
amygdala
responsiveness
can
selectively apply to negative stimuli, without simultaneously
affecting the processing of positive stimuli of an equivalent
salience. Indeed, there is evidence of blunting of positive mood
with SSRIs (Price et al., 2009). Moreover the relative ineffectiveness
of conventional serotonergic antidepressant medications to alle-
viate anhedonia may be explained by a generalised moderation of
emotional responsiveness with these drugs (McCabe et al., 2010).
We recently carried out a qualitative analysis of patient experi-
ences from this clinical trial, asking patients whether psilocybin
with psychological support has been effective for them, and if so,
how? Since the majority of patients reported improvements with
the treatment, most answered in the affirmative and described a
greater willingness to accept all emotions post-treatment (including
negative ones). These effects were often contrasted with those of
their previous depression treatments which they described as
working to reinforce emotional avoidance and disconnection (Watts
et al., 2017). Conversely, psilocybin was said to make emotional
‘confrontation’ more likely, and the accompanying psychological
support
helped
patients
achieve
an
emotional breakthrough
(catharsis) and resolution (Eisner and Cohen, 1958; Gasser et al.,
2014b). Consistently, recent work has suggested that overcoming
challenging emotional phenomena under a psychedelic is predictive
of better long-term mental health outcomes (Carbonaro et al., 2016).
It is important to highlight an important discrepancy between the
present results, observed post acutely in patients treated with psi-
locybin for major depression viewing emotional faces and those from
a previous study in which amygdala responses to emotional stimuli
(not faces) were assessed during the acute psilocybin ‘high’ in healthy
individuals (Kraehenmann et al., 2015). This latter study reported
unspecific decreases in right amygdala responses to negative and
neutral stimuli under psilocybin, which, based on the aforemen-
tioned similarities with the action of conventional antidepressants,
the authors interpreted as supporting an antidepressant action for
psilocybin. We advise caution with this interpretation however, not
least because our pre versus post resting-state fMRI findings suggest
that post-acute changes in spontaneous brain function are very
different if not antithetical to psilocybin's acute brain effects
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2017). Moreover, findings of ‘attenuated re-
sponses’ with potent interventions may be explained by compro-
mised task engagement. A consistent explanation has been used to
account for apparent functional impairments in imaging studies of
pathological states such as schizophrenia, i.e. impoverished re-
sponses are observed because patients do not properly engage with
the task and its stimuli (Corbetta et al., 1990; Rees et al., 1997).
It is important to acknowledge the limitations of the present
study. It would be interesting to collect longer-term imaging data
than the 1-day post treatment scanning point chosen here (e.g. one
week and one month after treatment with psilocybin). If feasible, it
would also be interesting to collect imaging data during the acute
experience to see how this relates to post treatment brain changes.
Future work may look to combine PET and fMRI to systematically
address potential relationships between receptor densities and
functional brain measures before and after treatment with psilo-
cybin. The recruitment of a healthy control group, receiving the
same interventions would also add value, as would the inclusion of
a meaningful comparator condition such as psilocybin alone versus
psilocybin in combination with psychological support, plus the
same for placebo and perhaps an active pharmacological control,
such as an SSRI and/or methylphenidate (Griffiths et al., 2006). As
this study was not placebo controlled, the contribution of psilocy-
bin with psychological support cannot be differentiated from psy-
chological support and other aspects of the therapy. It would also
be worthwhile to see if the present results extend to a less severe
population of depressed patients, including those with less exten-
sive histories of exposure to psychiatric medication.
Psilocybin represents a novel intervention for major depression
that appears to be safe, rapid and potentially enduring in its anti-
depressant action. Furthermore, it is important to note that psilo-
cybin's abuse potential is low (Johnson and Griffiths, 2017). The
original rationale for using psychedelic (‘mind-revealing’) drugs as
aides to psychotherapy was that they serve to dismantle psycho-
logical defences, allowing suppressed emotional material to sur-
face, sometimes with cathartic effect (Eisner and Cohen, 1958;
Gasser et al., 2014b; Grof et al., 2008). The present findings of
increased amygdala responsiveness post psilocybin resonate with
patients' descriptions of feeling emotionally re-connected and
accepting after the treatment (Watts et al., 2017). The finding of a
relationship between increased right amygdala responses to fear-
ful > neutral faces post treatment and subsequent clinical im-
provements adds further endorsement to this interpretation.
Future work is required to test the replicability of these findings
and test whether enhanced amygdala responsiveness is related to
the potentially enduring positive mood effects of psychedelics
(Griffiths et al., 2006; Schmid and Liechti, 2017). If confirmed, this
would suggest an alternative neurobiological basis to the allevia-
tion of depressive symptoms distinct from that of the SSRI anti-
depressants (Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017).
““I felt so much lighter, like something had been released, it was an
emotional purging, the weight and anxiety and depression had
been lifted.”
““I have felt a sense of acceptance; more acceptance of agony,
boredom, loneliness. [A] willingness to try to accept the negative
times - but also an appreciation of the wonderful times.”
(Two patients’ testimonies from recent psilocybin for TRD trial)
(Carhart-Harris et al., 2016; Watts et al., 2017).
