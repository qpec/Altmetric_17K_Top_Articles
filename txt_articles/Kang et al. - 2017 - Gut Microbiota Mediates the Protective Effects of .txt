ABSTRACT
Metabolic endotoxemia originating from dysbiotic gut microbiota has been
identified as a primary mediator for triggering the chronic low-grade inflammation
(CLGI) responsible for the development of obesity. Capsaicin (CAP) is the major pun-
gent bioactivator in chili peppers and has potent anti-obesity functions, yet the
mechanisms linking this effect to gut microbiota remain obscure. Here we show that
mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) supplemented with CAP exhibit lower levels of meta-
bolic endotoxemia and CLGI associated with lower body weight gain. High-resolution
responses of the microbiota were examined by 16S rRNA sequencing, short-chain
fatty acid (SCFA) measurements, and phylogenetic reconstruction of unobserved
states (PICRUSt) analysis. The results showed, among others, that dietary CAP in-
duced increased levels of butyrate-producing Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae,
while it caused lower levels of members of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-producing
family S24_7. Predicted function analysis (PICRUSt) showed depletion of genes in-
volved in bacterial LPS synthesis in response to CAP. We further identified that inhi-
bition of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) by CAP also contributes to prevention of
HFD-induced gut barrier dysfunction. Importantly, fecal microbiota transplantation
experiments conducted in germfree mice demonstrated that dietary CAP-induced
protection against HFD-induced obesity is transferrable. Moreover, microbiota deple-
tion by a cocktail of antibiotics was sufficient to block the CAP-induced protective
phenotype against obesity, further suggesting the role of microbiota in this context.
Together, our findings uncover an interaction between dietary CAP and gut microbi-
ota as a novel mechanism for the anti-obesity effect of CAP acting through preven-
tion of microbial dysbiosis, gut barrier dysfunction, and chronic low-grade inflamma-
tion.
IMPORTANCE
Metabolic endotoxemia due to gut microbial dysbiosis is a major
contributor to the pathogenesis of chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI), which pri-
marily mediates the development of obesity. A dietary strategy to reduce endotox-
emia appears to be an effective approach for addressing the issue of obesity. Capsa-
icin (CAP) is the major pungent component in red chili (genus Capsicum). Little is
known about the role of gut microbiota in the anti-obesity effect of CAP. High-
throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that CAP significantly increased bu-
tyragenic bacteria and decreased LPS-producing bacteria (e.g., members of the S24-7
family) and LPS biosynthesis. By using antibiotics and microbiota transplantation, we

partially involved in the beneficial effect of CAP. Together, these data suggest that
the gut microbiome is a critical factor for the anti-obesity effects of CAP.

A
ccumulating evidence suggests that chronic low-grade inflammation (CLGI) is
central to the pathogenesis of obesity (1, 2), which is considered a global public
health problem (3), and is linked with several complications, including insulin resistance
(2). Systemic CLGI is identified by elevated circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines,
such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-�), interleukin-1� (IL-1�), and IL-6, which act
as molecular mediators and are responsible for the progression of the response to a
systemic level encompassing multiple organs (2). It is well known that systemic CLGI
damages pancreatic beta cells, disrupts insulin action, and mediates glucose intoler-
ance in obesity (4).
Metabolic endotoxemia has been shown to be the primary contributor to the patho-
genesis of CLGI, characterized by increased plasma bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
levels, which are believed to originate from bacteria of the Gram-negative gut micro-
biome that spill into the systemic circulation as a direct result of gut barrier dysfunction
(5). The binding of LPS with Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) leads to the increased expression
of proinflammatory cytokines (6). Diet is the most important factor that determines the
gut microbiota composition. The high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity-promoting al-
tered microbiome and the resultant gut barrier disintegration have been implicated as
key factors facilitating metabolic endotoxemia (5, 6).
Altered gut microbiota composition (e.g., increased abundance of LPS-producing
bacteria) (7) and/or function (e.g., changes in LPS biosynthesis and short-chain fatty
acid [SCFA] production) (8, 9) are key factors affecting gut barrier integrity. For example,
butyrate, propionate, and acetate are SCFAs derived from the bacterial degradation of
complex polysaccharides in the gut (9). They have important metabolic roles, with
butyrate acting as a metabolic substrate for colonic epithelial cells. The functions
mediated by butyrate that are pertinent to the pathogenesis of obesity include its role
in the maintenance of intestinal epithelial integrity, thereby preventing the occurrence
of HFD-induced metabolic endotoxemia (10). Thus, many efforts have been made to
modify metabolic endotoxemia through dietary intervention, which could be a prom-
ising way to prevent obesity and related diseases.
In addition to altered gut microbiota and function, cannabinoids modulate intestinal
permeability through expression of cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) (11). Although
the expression of CB1 is traditionally believed to be limited to the central nervous
system, recent evidence suggests that gastrointestinal expression also occurs (12).
Interestingly, administration of the CB1 antagonist in humans is accompanied by
decreased gut permeability (11) and body weight (13), and treatment with a CB1
agonist (HU-210) enhanced LPS-induced decreases in the expression of mRNA for gut
tight junction markers such as occludin and zonula occludens-1 (14).
Chili peppers are increasingly being used in food and are very popular worldwide.
Capsaicin (CAP) is the major pungent component in red chili (genus Capsicum) that
provides flavor to food without increasing the number of calories (15). Growing
evidence indicates that CAP could improve obesity and related comorbidities, suggest-
ing that it could be a new promising therapeutic strategy (16). Previous studies have
demonstrated that dietary CAP can reduce HFD-induced increase in body weight and
glucose metabolism abnormalities (17–19). However, the mechanisms that underlie the
anti-obesity functions remain obscure. Considering the central role of metabolic endo-
toxemia in the development of CLGI, we hypothesize that the anti-obesity effect of
dietary CAP is due to the prevention of microbial dysbiosis-induced gut barrier dys-
function and subsequently improved metabolic endotoxemia through altering the gut

for the anti-obesity effects of CAP through prevention of metabolic endotoxemia and
gut barrier dysfunction.
RESULTS
Dietary CAP reduces metabolic endotoxemia and systemic low-grade inflam-
mation. High-fat-diet (HFD)-induced metabolic endotoxemia and systemic CLGI play
key roles in the pathogenesis of obesity (2). To investigate the impact of CAP on
metabolic endotoxemia and systemic CLGI (plasma TNF-�, IL-1�, IL-6, and IL-10), mice
were fed either a normal chow diet (NCD) or an HFD with or without CAP supplemen-
tation for 12 weeks. As shown in Fig. 1, dietary CAP reduced HFD induced elevation of
the markers of bacterial translocation (bacterial invasion of epithelium and bacterial
DNA in the systemic circulation) and metabolic endotoxemia (intestinal permeability to
macromolecules like fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]-dextran, gut tight junction pro-
tein expression, and plasma LPS). In detail, bacterial invasion of epithelium was seen
by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a universal 16S rRNA gene probe. A
dramatic increase in the number of bacteria in direct contact with the colon intestinal
epithelial surface seen in the HFD group was reduced by CAP (Fig. 1A). Bacterial invasion
of epithelium has been associated with bacterial translocation from the intestine and
subsequently impaired metabolic homeostasis (20). Therefore, we determined the
levels of bacterial DNA in blood using quantitative PCR (qPCR). In agreement with FISH
results, we found that the bacterial DNA load was significantly lower in blood samples
from mice fed HFD with CAP for 12 weeks (Fig. 1B). In addition, we found that the
CAP-treated animals were protected from the increase in intestinal permeability and
downregulation of intestinal tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) that occurs in
response to an HFD (Fig. 1C to E). Excessive LPS production due to altered gut

translocation and metabolic endotoxemia, such as bacterial invasion into colonic mucosa visualized by FISH (16S rRNA genes of all bacteria [red] and nuclei

junction proteins ZO-1 (D) and occludin (E), plasma levels of LPS (F) and its receptor (TLR4) in epididymal white adipose tissue at the mRNA level (G), and the
markers of systemic CLGI, such as plasma TNF-� (H), IL-1� (I), IL-6 (J), and IL-10 (K). Data are expressed as means � standard errors of the means (SEM). Data

 microbiota leads to metabolic endotoxemia (passage of LPS to systemic circulation)
through leaky gut (5), so we next measured the plasma LPS levels by Limulus amebo-
cyte lysate (LAL) chromogenic endpoint assay. Consistently, we found significantly
lower plasma LPS with CAP treatment (Fig. 1F). Circulating LPS causes CLGI, and
adipose tissue (AT) is the major organ that releases markers of CLGI in response to LPS
(21). Lower expression of TLR4, which is a receptor for LPS, in the AT also supports the
presence of lower LPS in the group treated with HFD plus CAP (HFD�C) compared to
the group treated with HFD alone (Fig. 1G). Accordingly, the increased levels of markers
of systemic CLGI (TNF-�, IL-1�, and IL-6) induced by the HFD were decreased by CAP
(Fig. 1H to J), while levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were significantly
increased (Fig. 1K). Furthermore, markers of obesity (body weight and excessive visceral
adiposity measured by fat pad weight) and insulin resistance (glucose intolerance
measured by oral glucose tolerance tests [GTTs]) (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental
material) were similarly improved by CAP. These results demonstrate that dietary CAP
reduces HFD-induced metabolic endotoxemia and CLGI and associated obesity.
Dietary CAP beneficially alters the gut microbiota. Excessive LPS production due
to elevated levels of LPS-producing bacteria (22) and hyper-intestinal permeability due
to altered gut microbiota (7) and microbiota-derived metabolites (23) have been shown
as major causes for the development of metabolic endotoxemia. To assess the impact
of dietary CAP on gut microbiota, we analyzed the composition, abundance, and
function of gut microbiota by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V3
and V4 regions of the cecal contents of these mice. To reveal the relationships of the
microbial communities hosted by individuals differing by CAP treatment, we performed
several analyses describing the differences in bacterial community compositions and
structures between individuals. To evaluate aspects of bacterial diversity that may be
influenced by CAP treatment, we first applied measures of � diversity (similarities or
differences in communities between individuals). To measure community similarity, we
used the Jaccard, Bray-Curtis, and UniFrac indices, which are classical ecological �
diversity measures based on the ratio of shared and unique species relative to the total
number of species present between two communities, respectively. This analysis revealed
a significant impact of CAP treatment overall (permutational multivariate analysis of vari-
ance [PERMANOVA], Bray-Curtis, 999 mutations, F � 10.93, P � 0.001; Jaccard, 999 muta-
tions, F � 3.9, P � 0.001; unweighted UniFrac, 999 mutations, F � 4.67, P � 0.001) and also
between groups (Fig. 2A; see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Differences in bacterial
community structures are also apparent in principal-coordinate analyses (PCoA)
of these � diversity indices. PCoA revealed a distinct clustering of microbiota
composition between the CAP-supplemented HFD (HFD�C), HFD, and NCD/CAP-
supplemented NCD (NCD�C) groups along the primary ordination axis (axis 1),
which explains 50.4% of the variation in the data (Fig. 2A). On one end of the axis,
the HFD group stand alone, and HFD�C is in the middle, while the NCD/NCD�C
cluster is on the opposite end. Next, taxa that are primarily responsible for an observed
difference between groups were analyzed using the similarity percentage (SIMPER)
test, which reveals 7 taxa. Their contributions to groups are analyzed using principal
component (variance-covariance type) analysis (PCA) (Fig. 2B). Accordingly, Gram-
negative LPS-producing members of the S24_7 and SCFA-producing Ruminococcacea
families are primarily responsible for HFD- and CAP-treated groups, respectively. Fur-
thermore, the relative abundance of taxa, which showed P value of �0.05 by differential
expression analysis (nonparametric ANOVA with false discovery rate [FDR] correction),
was expressed as a heat map (Fig. 2C) including hierarchical clustering (HCN). HCN is a
clustering technique for graphically summarizing the intersample relationships in the
form of a dendrogram. HCN also clearly separated the HFD samples as a single cluster
from the other 3 groups, which form three clusters within a clade. In addition,
biomarker analysis using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) (Fig. 2D)
and a cladogram (Fig. 2E) generated from LEfSe analysis indicated that the members of
the LPS-producing family S24_7 were increased in the HFD group, while SCFA (e.g.,

 butyrate)-producing Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae were increased in the CAP-
treated group (Fig. 2D and E). Because various high-throughput microbiome analyses
emphasize the main effects of CAP on SCFA-producing bacteria, we quantified butyryl
coenzyme A (CoA) transferase (BCoAT) genes using qPCR. Interestingly, we found that the
gene copies were higher in the CAP-treated HFD group (Fig. 2F). Consistently, the
relative abundances (RAs) of SCFA-producing bacteria measured by both sequencing
and qPCR were significantly higher in CAP-treated groups (Fig. 2G and H; see Fig. S3A
and B in the supplemental material). Moreover, the fecal SCFA analysis revealed a
dramatic increase in butyrate in CAP-treated groups (Fig. 2I; Fig. S3C and D). Butyrate,
which is a major SCFA produced by Ruminococcacaea (24), prevents metabolic endo-
toxemia (23) by strengthening the gut barrier. Likewise, RA of the LPS-producing
S24_7 family was significantly higher in HFD and vice versa in CAP-treated groups
(Fig. 2J). Next, to study the potential function of gut microbiota in different groups,
LEfSe was applied to the relative abundance of KEGG pathways predicted by
phylogenetic reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) (25). Notably, the biomark-
ers with significant discriminative power were the “lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis
proteins” and “lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathways,” which were significantly
lower in CAP-treated groups than in those fed on HFD alone (Fig. 2K).
Although � diversity measures describe aspects of community structure between
groups, they do not reveal the similarities or differences in communities within a
group (i.e., � diversity). We next applied measures of � diversity, which describe
species composition in one specific habitat of interest and can be informative of
community functioning (26). Because microbial communities are highly diverse and
are often poorly amenable to the diversity measures commonly used in community
ecology (27), we used several different measures focusing on different aspects of
community assembly, including species richness and abundance. Chao1 (species
richness), the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE), and the Shannon index
(species richness) showed a trend of increase when diet was supplemented with CAP
(see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). Together, these data indicate that CAP
beneficially alters the gut microbiota and mainly prevents HFD-induced reduction of
butyrate-producing bacteria and elevation of Gram-negative LPS-producing bacteria
and associated LPS biosynthesis.
Gut microbiota mediates the preventive effects of CAP on metabolic endotox-
emia. Metabolic endotoxemia is commonly derived from dysbiotic gut microbiota, so
we next determined whether gut microbiota is necessary for the beneficial effects of
CAP on metabolic endotoxemia using antibiotic treatment and fecal microbiota trans-
plantation (FMT) experiments. We used a cocktail of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Abx
[ampicillin, metronidazole, neomycin, and vancomycin]) to create groups of macro-
scopically germfree (GF) mice (7), which were fed NCD and HFD in both the absence
and presence of CAP supplementation (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, when comparing the data
gathered before and after treatment with antibiotics, the differences observed between
HFD and HFD�C groups in markers of metabolic endotoxemia (Fig. 3B), inflammation

These findings suggest that the gut microbiota largely mediates the preventive effects
of CAP on metabolic endotoxemia. More specifically, the HFD�C group may carry a
lower abundance of LPS-producing bacteria.
To further clarify whether the gut microbiota plays a causal role, we transplanted the

 then fed both groups of recipient mice a high-fat diet for 2 weeks (Fig. 3E). Once
colonized, the GF mice are maintained as gnotobiotic by housing them in sterile
isolators to avoid cross contamination with other bacteria or fungi (see Fig. S6A in the
supplemental material). Strikingly, markers of bacterial translocation (Fig. 3F; Fig. S6B),
metabolic endotoxemia (Fig. 3G to I), and systemic CLGI (Fig. 3J) were significantly
lower in GF mice that received microbiota from the CAP-treated HFD group than in GF
mice that received HFD donor microbiota. As expected, lower TLR4 expression in the AT
(Fig. S6C) and higher fecal SCFA levels, especially butyrate and acetate, were found in
GF mice treated with HFD�C without microbiota transplant (Fig. S6D). Although there
were no differences in body weights and food intakes between these two groups
(Fig. S6E and F), the recipients of microbiota from the mice consuming an HFD with CAP
supplementation exhibited an improvement in glucose tolerance and fat accumulation
(Fig. S6G and H). Combined, these findings suggest that the beneficial effects of CAP on
metabolic endotoxemia and obesity were largely mediated by modulation of the gut
microbiota.
CB1 receptor inhibition is involved in the beneficial effects of CAP. The endo-
cannabinoid system, particularly the cannabinoid (CB) receptor in the intestine, links
the gut microbiota with metabolic endotoxemia and CLGI (28). Next, we examined
the CB1 and CB2 receptors at the mRNA level in the colon. CB1 receptor expression
was significantly lower in the HFD�C mice, whereas there were no differences in the
expression of CB2 between these groups (see Fig. S7A in the supplemental material), so
we hypothesized that the inhibition of CB1 also involved in the beneficial effects of
dietary CAP through microbiota. To test this hypothesis, mice were fed HFD�C for 4 weeks
in the presence or absence of a CB1 agonist (HU-210). As we expected, the beneficial effects
of CAP against HFD-induced increase of markers of bacterial translocation (Fig. 4A and B),
metabolic endotoxemia (Fig. 4C to E), and CLGI (Fig. 4F) were significantly prevented in the
HFD�C�HU-210 group compared to the HFD�C�vehicle group. Similarly, the TLR4
expression (Fig. 4G) in the AT was upregulated, and fecal SCFA (mainly butyrate and
acetate) (Fig. 4H) production was reduced in the HFD�C�HU-210 group. Consistent
with other changes, the presence of the CB1 receptor agonist increased the markers of
obesity (weight gain and fat pad weight) and insulin resistance (oral GTT) in the HFD�C
group (Fig. S7B to E). Taken together, these findings indicate CAP prevents HFD-
induced upregulation of CB1 receptor. These inhibitory effects of CAP on CB1 receptor
could partially explain the beneficial effects of CAP on metabolic endotoxemia and
obesity.
DISCUSSION
Metabolic endotoxemia originating from dysbiotic gut microbiota and impaired gut
barrier integrity play a central role in the pathogenesis of chronic low-grade inflam-
mation, an underlying factor of obesity and associated health complications (5, 6).
Discovering a safe and novel means of limiting its development is urgently required for
the prevention and treatment of these diseases. The present study demonstrates for
the first time that anti-obesity effects of dietary CAP could be due to preventing the
occurrence of HFD-induced metabolic endotoxemia and systemic CLGI (Fig. 5A).
Consequently, we are able to propose a pathway-based mechanism by which dietary CAP
increased the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, prevented HFD-induced upregu-
lation CB1 expression, and reduced the expression of genes involved in LPS biosynthesis.
These changes improve the gut barrier abnormalities and lower gut permeability,
resulting in reduced metabolic endotoxemia (Fig. 5A). The subsequent reduction of
proinflammatory cytokines leads to the prevention of CLGI and obesity (Fig. 5A).
Multivariate principal component correlation analysis, including the above-mentioned
findings, strongly supports the proposed mechanism (Fig. 5B). Moreover, results from
antibiotic-induced depletion of gut microbiota and fecal microbiota transplantation
experiments in germfree mice strongly suggest that the gut microbiota largely medi-
ates CAP’
s protection against HFD-induced obesity.
Our results demonstrate that CAP supplementation enhanced the abundance of SCFAs

 producing Clostridium clusters IV (Ruminococcaceae) and XIVa (Lachnospiraceae, including
Roseburia spp.) in HFD-fed obese mice (Fig. 2D and E and G and H). Interestingly, our
previous study also found that the levels of butyrogenic bacteria are elevated in
humans after 2 weeks of CAP intervention (16). Bacterial butyrate production is a key
function attributed to a “healthy” gut microbiota because of the preferred use of this
SCFA as an energy source for intestinal epithelial cells (29). Previous studies have
highlighted the importance of SCFAs such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the
amelioration of chronic inflammatory diseases and the promotion of colonocyte health
(29–31). SCFAs are produced from the fermentation of polysaccharides by Lachno-
spiraceae, including Roseburia spp. (32). In our study, fecal butyrate concentrations were
positively correlated with abundance of butyrogenic Lachnospiraceae (Fig. 5B) in CAP-
treated groups, suggesting the key role of this CAP-enhanced bacterial group in the
elevated levels of butyrate with CAP intervention.
It is well-known that colonic butyrate improves gut barrier function by increasing
HIF-1 through the stimulation of epithelial metabolism and enhancing the expression
of proteins involved in tight junctions, thereby preventing the translocation of endo-
toxins produced by intestinal Gram-negative bacteria across the gut barrier (10, 23,
33–35). Besides, butyrate suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines,
enhances anti-inflammatory IL-10 expression, and activates regulatory T cells (Treg
cells), leading to the amelioration of colitis (34). The data from our antibiotics, micro-
biota transfer, and CB1 inhibition experiments also support the notion that butyrate
contributes to the anti-inflammatory effect of CAP as well as its beneficial effects on the

orally administered for 4 weeks (n � 6/group). Activation of CB1 eliminated the beneficial effects of CAP treatment on markers
of bacterial translocation and metabolic endotoxemia, such as those shown by FISH analysis (A), whole-blood total bacterial
DNA load (B), gut permeability (C), intestinal tight junction proteins (D), and plasma levels of LPS (E), in addition to chronic
inflammation markers, such as plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-�, IL-1�, IL-6, and IL-10) (F), adipose tissue TLR4
mRNA levels (G), and fecal SCFA concentrations (H). Data are expressed as means � SEM. *, P � 0.05, **, P � 0.01, and ***, P �

 gut barrier. Combined, these results indicate that the beneficial effects of CAP against
metabolic endotoxemia and associated obesity may be largely due to increases in the
populations of these butyrogenic bacterial species and gut barrier-enhancing effects of
butyrate.
Variations in the intestinal endocannabinoid system in response to modulation of
the gut microbiota have been observed in germfree mice and in mouse models of
bacterial-host interactions in colonic tissue (14). The intestinal endocannabinoid system
is thought to control gut barrier function, gut permeability, and metabolic endotoxemia
under obese and diabetic conditions through a CB1-dependent mechanism, as antag-
onists of CB1 decrease gut permeability and act as “gatekeepers” (36). Conversely,
treatment with the CB1 receptor agonist HU-210 in mice significantly increased plasma
levels of LPS and augmented the LPS-induced decreases in the expression of gut
tight junction proteins at the mRNA level (14). In our study, we discovered that CAP
prevented the HFD-induced upregulation of CB1 receptor expression because HU-210
treatment of the HFD�C group partially abolished the beneficial effects of dietary CAP
on gut barrier, metabolic endotoxemia, and CLGI, indicating that CB1 inhibition also
partially contributes to the anti-obesity effects of CAP.
In addition to the enrichment of butyrogenic bacteria and CB1 inhibition, we found
that CAP intervention reduced the enrichment of genes involved in LPS biosynthesis
and related proteins based on the predicted function by 16S rRNA sequencing and
phylogenetic reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) analysis (25). Interestingly,
FIG 5
Diagram illustrating a proposed mechanism by which the interactions between dietary CAP and gut
microbiome lead to a decrease in Gram-negative LPS-producing bacteria (e.g., S24-7 family) and LPS biosynthesis
and an increase in butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g., Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae) and butyrate levels.
These changes lower LPS production and gut permeability and downregulate CB1 expression, resulting in reduced
markers of metabolic endotoxemia. The subsequent reduction of inflammatory cytokines leads to the suppression
of chronic low-grade inflammation and obesity (A). (B) Principal-component analysis (biplot) showing the corre-

 our recent study has shown similar results with CAP intervention in human subjects
(16). This would indicate the possibility that lower abundance of Gram-negative mi-
crobiota must be responsible for the low abundance of KEGG orthology (KO) belonging
to the LPS biosynthesis pathway in the HFD�C group. This could be mainly due to
prevention of enrichment of members of the Gram-negative S24_7 family with CAP
intervention because it was the key bacterial family that largely contributes to the HFD
group (Fig. 2D and J). These lipopolysaccharides are bacterium-associated molecular
patterns, which act via TLR4 by promoting the inflammatory response (6).
Our study design is unique in its use of fecal microbiota transplantation in the germfree
(GF) mouse model. GF mice that lack any exposure to living pathogenic or nonpatho-
genic microorganisms provide an attractive model to investigate the role of the
composition and function of intestinal microbiota on the development of obesity (6).
Given the fact that transferring the microbiota of HFD-consuming mice to GF mice
caused glucose intolerance in 6 days (37) and significant changes in the luminal
butyrate concentrations of recipient GF mice at day 7 post-FMT (38), it is interesting
to note that the acquired changes in microbiota in response to CAP protect against
HFD-induced obesity because germfree mice that received microbiota from the HFD�C
group exhibited lower levels of gut permeability, plasma LPS, and markers of CLGI in
2 weeks (Fig. 3).
In conclusion, these results demonstrate dietary CAP-microbiome interactions as a
novel mechanism underlying the anti-obesity effects of dietary CAP. Our study dem-
onstrated that dietary CAP prevents HFD-induced metabolic endotoxemia and systemic
CLGI by elevating cecal butyrogenic bacterium and butyrate levels, inhibiting colonic
CB1 receptor, and reducing LPS biosynthesis (Fig. 5A). Finally, given the fact that gut
dysbiosis and metabolic endotoxemia are often linked to chronic inflammatory dis-
eases, the ability of dietary CAP to prevent these conditions confirms the potential of
CAP supplementation as a therapeutic means of treating obesity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals. Male wild-type (WT) mice of the C57BL/6J genetic lineage were bred in the specific-
pathogen-free animal (SPF) facility of the Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, People’
s Republic
of China, and maintained in a temperature-controlled room (22 to 24°
C) with a strictly followed 12-h
light/12-h dark diurnal cycle with food and water ad libitum. Germfree (GF) mice were created using
caesarean rederivation from existing SPF mouse lines. A total of 10 1-day-old GF mice of the C57BL/6J
background were bred in the Department of Laboratory Animal Science of the Third Military Medical
University and were used as recipients for the fecal microbiota transplantation. Sterile plastic film
isolators, which help to avoid cross contamination with other bacteria or fungi, were used to house the
mice in a completely germfree environment; this provides an environment that allowed us to conduct
experiments without competing background levels of microbiota. They were given ad libitum access to
sterilized water during the whole course of the experiment. Food and water and other sterile supplies
were imported into the isolators by docking autoclaved supply cylinders to a double-door port built into
the isolator wall (Fig. S6A). GF foster mice were used to breastfeed 1-day-old GF mice until weaning
(which occurred at 3 weeks of age); they were then fed ad libitum with a sterilized normal chow diet for
5 weeks postweaning. Culture and PCR analysis of feces amplifying the 16S rRNA gene were used to
routinely test the sterility of GF isolators. The animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committee of the Third Military Medical University (Chongqing, China).
Animal diets. Normal chow diet (NCD [D12450B]) had 70% of kilocalories from carbohydrate, 20%
of kilocalories from protein, and 10% of kilocalories from fat, for a total energy content of 3.85 kcal/g, and
the high-fat diet (HFD [D12451]) had 35% of kilocalories from carbohydrate, 20% of kilocalories from
protein, and 45% of kilocalories from fat, for a total energy content of 4.73 kcal/g. These diets, with or
without capsaicin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at 0.01 g CAP/100 g diet, were ordered from Research Diets,
Inc. (New Brunswick, NJ, USA).
Animal experiments. Mice were housed in a biosafety level 2 (BSL2) room in hard-top cages with
two or three mice per cage. Body weight and food intake were measured weekly. Mice were fasted for
4 h before being sacrificed, and blood was collected via cardiac puncture in all experiments unless
otherwise specified.
(i) Determination of the CAP effects on metabolic endotoxemia, chronic low-grade inflamma-
tion, and gut microbiota. Eight-week old mice were randomly distributed into four groups (n �
6/group): (i) normal chow diet (NCD), (ii) NCD with 0.01% CAP (NCD�C), (iii) high-fat diet (HFD), and (iv)
HFD with 0.01% CAP (HFD�C). After 12 weeks, GTT and gut permeability assays were done. Then mice
were sacrificed, blood samples were aliquoted into EDTA-coated blood collection tubes, cecal contents
were flash-frozen, and body fat pad weights were taken. Blood samples were snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at �80°
C or centrifuged (2,500 � g for 15 min at 4°
C) to collect plasma. Cecal

 contents and feces were subjected to microbiome and SCFA analysis, respectively. Analyses of markers
of bacterial translocation (bacterial invasion into intestinal epithelium and bacterial DNA in the systemic
circulation), metabolic endotoxemia (hyper-intestinal permeability to macromolecules like FITC-dextran,
gut tight junction protein expression, and plasma LPS levels), and systemic CLGI (plasma TNF-�, IL-1�,
IL-6, and IL-10) were also conducted.
(ii) Determination of causal role of microbiota for the anti-obesity effects of CAP. (a) Antibiotic-
induced gut microbiota depletion. A subset of 8-week-old mice were randomly distributed into four
groups (n � 6/group) and were fed either NCD�C or HFD�C for 12 weeks. Markers of metabolic
endotoxemia, CLGI, and obesity were recorded before (at the end of the 12th week) and after treatment
of these mice with a broad-spectrum antibiotic (Abx) cocktail (Sigma, USA) containing ampicillin
(1 mg/ml), metronidazole (1 mg/ml), neomycin (1 mg/ml), and vancomycin (0.5 mg/ml) in their drinking
water for 6 weeks. Successful depletion of gut microbiota after the antibiotic treatment was confirmed
using qPCR analysis of total bacterial 16S rRNA genes (7, 39).
(b) Fecal microbiota transplantation in germfree mice. To colonize the guts of GF mice, fecal samples
were collected from randomly chosen mice that had received HFD or HFD�C for 12 weeks since the age
of 8 weeks. Fecal samples were stored at �80°
C until the time of processing. The procedures for
preparing the fecal samples for microbiota transplantation were performed as described in a previous
study (40). In detail, fecal samples were homogenized with a mortar and pestle while submerged in liquid
nitrogen. A 100-mg aliquot of the pulverized frozen material was then diluted in 1.5 ml of reduced
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (supplemented with 0.1% resazurin [wt/vol] and 0.05% L-cysteine-HCl)
in an anaerobic Coy chamber (atmosphere, 75% N2, 20% CO2, 5% H2) and then vortexed at room
temperature for 5 min. The suspension was allowed to settle by gravity for 5 min, after which time the
clarified supernatant was transferred to an anaerobic crimped tube that was then transported to the
gnotobiotic mouse facility. The outer surface of the tube was sterilized by exposure for 20 min to chlorine
dioxide in the transfer sleeve attached to the gnotobiotic isolator and then transferred into the isolator.
A 1-ml syringe was used to recover a 200-�l aliquot of the suspension; the suspension was subsequently
introduced by gavage with a flexible plastic tube into the stomach of each adult 8-week-old GF recipient.
The samples were obtained shortly before colonization, immediately (within 5 min) diluted, and
introduced into the GF mice within 2 h after dilution. The recipient mice were separately bred in different
gnotobiotic isolators to prevent normalization of the gut microbiota. Also, the recipient mice were
maintained in separate cages (five mice per cage; n � 5/group) within an isolator dedicated to mice
colonized with the same donor microbiota. As mentioned in the previous section, mouse samples were
subjected to analysis for markers of bacterial translocation, metabolic endotoxemia, and systemic CLGI
and analysis of fecal SCFA levels after 2 weeks.
(iii) Role of CB1 receptor for the CAP effects on metabolic endotoxemia and obesity. To study
the effects of CAP on HFD-induced upregulation of CB1, HU-210 (CB1 receptor agonist) was dissolved in
a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Cremophor, and saline solution (41), and then either HU-210 or
vehicle was intraperitoneally injected (100 �g/kg/day) into HFD�C (0.01% CAP)-treated mice (n �
6/group) for 4 weeks (14). Mice were then subjected to GTT and analysis for markers of obesity, bacterial
translocation, metabolic endotoxemia, and systemic CLGI.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.01 (GraphPad
Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) unless otherwise specified. Experiments with two groups were analyzed
with Student’
s t tests, and those with more than two groups were analyzed with one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Bonferroni’
s multiple comparison tests. Data were natural logarithm
transformed to normalize their distributions if the values had a skewed distribution. Correlation-type
principal-component analysis (PCA) (XLSTAT software) was applied to the correlation between groups
and findings. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) uses a nonparametric Wilcoxon sum-rank test
followed by LDA analysis to measure the effect size of each abundant taxon, and two filters (P � 0.05
and LDA score of �2) were applied to the present features. A P value of �0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
