 In the United Kingdom, outbreaks of Campylobacter in-
fection are increasingly attributed to undercooked chicken 
livers, yet many recipes, including those of top chefs, ad-
vocate short cooking times and serving livers pink. During 
2015, we studied preferences of chefs and the public in the 
United Kingdom and investigated the link between liver rare-
ness and survival of Campylobacter. We used photographs 
to assess chefs’ ability to identify chicken livers meeting 
safe cooking guidelines. To investigate the microbiologi-
cal safety of livers chefs preferred to serve, we modeled 
Campylobacter survival in infected chicken livers cooked to 
various temperatures. Most chefs correctly identified safely 
cooked livers but overestimated the public’s preference for 
rareness and thus preferred to serve them more rare. We 
estimated that 19%–52% of livers served commercially in 
the United Kingdom fail to reach 70°C and that predicted 
Campylobacter survival rates are 48%–98%. These find-
ings indicate that cooking trends are linked to increasing 
Campylobacter infections.
F
oodborne illness is very costly, comprising medical ex-
penses, loss of earnings, and reduced quality of life. In 
the United States, the annual healthcare cost is ≈$14 billion 
annually (1); in the United Kingdom, it is £1.8 billion (2). 
The foodborne illness most commonly responsible for these 
costs is campylobacteriosis (3–5). In the United States, cas-
es increased by 13% between 2006–2008 and 2013 (6). In 
the United Kingdom, Campylobacter accounted for over 
half of the estimated 500,000 cases of foodborne disease 
during 2011–2012 (3,7); in the United States, it accounts 
for 9% of foodborne disease cases annually (4).
Foods implicated as Campylobacter vehicles include 
poultry, red meat, milk, and water (7–11). Studies of out-
breaks and sporadic cases have identified the principal 
source of infection as undercooked chicken meat (9–14). 
In the United Kingdom, increasing numbers of outbreaks 
are attributed to undercooked chicken livers (9) despite 
the fact that the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) has 
provided guidelines for safely cooking them. These in-
creased infections seem to have coincided with a trend 
among leading chefs to advocate minimal cooking of 
chicken livers, despite recommendations to maintain liver 
cores at 70°C for 2–3 minutes to ensure they are Campy-
lobacter free (15).
Although the association between consuming chick-
en livers and infection with Campylobacter is well known 
(9), the underlying reasons for the changing epidemiol-
ogy of outbreaks associated with chicken liver consump-
tion are unclear. We hypothesized that the trend toward 
including rarer, pinker meat in the recipes of leading 
chefs and by mass media representation of meat cooking 
may be contributing to changes in the way chicken livers 
 
are consumed.
We therefore conducted an interdisciplinary inves-
tigation by using a combination of methods from social 
and biological sciences. Participants were selected from 
the UK population, and the study was conducted during 
2015. Our study objectives were 1) to investigate the abil-
ity of chefs and members of the public to identify cooked 
chicken livers that meet FSA guidelines for safe cooking, 
2) to elicit the preferences of chefs and the public regard-
ing the rareness of chicken livers, and 3) to model the 
survival of Campylobacter in chicken livers sautéed to 
various core temperatures.
Methods
Participants
We recruited a quota-based sample of 1,030 members of 
the UK public via an online market research panel (http://
www.researchnow.com). Quotas were used to ensure rep-
resentativeness in terms of age groups and social class. The 
quota permitted an unequal split by sex (up to 70% women)

is more commonly performed by women than men. We 
also recruited 143 chefs through face-to-face convenience 
sampling at culinary shows and competitions and by online 
culinary forums.
All participants gave informed consent. Respon-
dents were debriefed on the purpose of the survey after 
completion and given the opportunity to withdraw their 
data. Ethical approval was obtained from the College of 
Natural Science Ethics Committee at Bangor University 
(CNS/2014/AJ1).
Preparation of Visual Aids
To prepare cooked chicken liver dishes to serve as visual 
aids, we used methods similar to those used in studies of 
hamburgers (16) and beefsteaks (17). A chef cooked 7 
batches of chicken livers for various times, recorded the 
maximum core temperature for each batch, and arranged 
each batch on a plate for photography by a professional 
photographer. The process was repeated (without the tem-
perature being recorded) for 3 other meats (duck breasts, 
lamb racks, and beef burgers).
Surveys of Preference and Knowledge
To determine preferences and knowledge of safe cooking 
practices among chefs and members of the public, we used 
the images of cooked chicken livers as visual aids. The im-
ages were presented in surveys (online and print), arranged 
in order of cooking time/rareness (Figure 1). The surveys 
for chefs and the public were similar, except that the chefs 
were asked about serving preferences and the public was 
asked about eating preferences. 
To avoid biases (such as social desirability bias) re-
sulting from respondents perceiving the survey to be about 
food safety, we described the survey as being about food 
preferences. Respondents were first asked preference ques-
tions about 3 of the 4 meats (in random order) to obscure 
the focus on chicken livers and safety. Chefs were asked to 
indicate which chicken liver dish was cooked “the way you 
would like to serve it” and “the way you think most cus-
tomers would like it.” Members of the public were asked 
which dish they would prefer if “eating out” and “eating 
at home.”
Respondents were subsequently asked which chicken 
liver dish (if any) was the first they thought would meet 
FSA safe cooking guidelines. Additional questions were 
asked about perceived trends and influences regarding 
cooking meat, dining habits, and demographic information 
such as class and age. Chefs provided additional informa-
tion about their current position, such as their training and 
industry experience.
Campylobacter Survival
To prepare a suspension of Campylobacter for experi-
mental inoculation, we streaked Camplyobacter jejuni 
M1 strain (sequence type 137, clonal complex 45) on Co-
lumbia agar base containing 5% defibrinated horse blood, 
incubated it at 37°C under microaerobic conditions for 
48–72 h, and then inoculated it into Camplyobacter en-
richment broth. After subculture for another 24 h, a bacte-
rial suspension was prepared in maximum recovery dilu-
ent to an optical density of 600 nm (≈109 CFU/mL). The 
culture broth was diluted in Camplyobacter enrichment

broth to give a suspension of ≈105 CFU/mL for inocula-
tion into fresh chicken livers.
The fresh chicken livers were purchased in packs from 
supermarkets and sorted into batches of 4 with similar 
weights. The connective tissue was cut between the 2 liver 
lobes, with the weight of the larger lobe recorded and as-
signed for inoculation with Campylobacter broth suspen-
sion; 4 livers were assigned to each cooking batch. A 1-cm2 
area of each liver was scored at its thickest point by us-
ing a sterile scalpel blade and injected with 100 μL (≈104 
CFU) of culture broth, corresponding to the highest levels 
of Campylobacter reported to be found in naturally con-
taminated livers (18).
For each cooking time, 10 g butter was heated in a fry-
ing pan over moderate to high heat on an electric cook-
top; when the butter had finished frothing, the 4 inoculated 
liver lobes in the batch were added. The maximum core 
temperature of the largest and smallest liver in each batch 
was recorded. To determine the survival of the inoculated 
M1 strain of C. jejuni within the cooked livers, we placed 
each liver in a sterile petri dish, and a 4–5-g portion around 
the scored inoculated region was removed and added to a 
Stomacher bag (Seward BA6040, Worthing, UK); 10 mL 
of Exeter broth was added to each bag before Stomaching 
(mechanical pounding of the outer surface of the bag to 
remove bacteria) for 1 min. The homogenized suspension 
was poured into a 20-mL universal container and incubated 
at 41°C under microaerobic conditions (Variable Atmo-
sphere Incubator; Don Whitely Scientific, Shipley, UK) for 
24 h, after which 1 loopful of broth was plated onto Cam-
pylobacter blood-free medium (modified charcoal cefo-
perazone deoxycholate agar, containing cefoperazone and 
amphotericin) at 41°C under microaerobic conditions for 
48–72 h. We picked 1 typical Campylobacter colony from 
at least 1 plate in each batch and confirmed it as C. jejuni by 
PCR; for a cooked liver to be deemed positive, 1 isolate per 
batch was confirmed as C. jejuni positive (19).
Data Analyses
We modeled the probability of survival for the 60 livers for 
which temperature and Campylobacter presence/absence 
after cooking were recorded. We used logistic regression to 
model the relationship between the core temperature of the 
livers and the survival of Campylobacter. The probability 
of Campylobacter survival as a function of core tempera-
ture was modeled via estimation of a logit model, which 
captured the nonlinear temperature-survival relationship 
(Figure 2). Parameter estimates were obtained by using lo-
gistic regression (Stata logit command; StataCorp LP, Col-
lege Station, TX, USA) on the binary variable indicating 
 
Camplyobacter survival (1 = survival, 0 = nonsurvival) in 
a sample of 60 cooked chicken livers. Temperature was the 
maximum core temperature recorded for the batch from 
which the chicken liver was taken. This model was used 
to assign predicted survival rates for each photographed 
chicken liver dish.
We used the Kolmogorov Smirnov 2-sample test to 
compare differences in the distribution of knowledge and 
preferences between groups (chefs and the public). We in-
vestigated within-person differences by using the Wilcox-
on signed-rank test for paired data. Ordered logit models 
(20) were estimated to determine the effects of observable 
characteristics on respondents’ preferences for chicken 
liver rareness and their choices of FSA-compliant livers.
Results
Campylobacter Survival
We discuss the results of the Campylobacter survival ex-
periment first because an understanding of those results 
is useful for interpreting the preferences and knowledge 
analyses. The relationship between core temperature and 
Campylobacter survival rate was inverse (Table; Figure 2). 
Of the 32 batches of 4 inoculated livers, the shortest cook-
ing time was 1 minute, leading to a mean core temperature 
of 36°C and a 100% Campylobacter survival rate. At the 
maximum mean core temperature (72°C), Campylobacter 
survival rate was 8.3%.
The logistic model predicted a survival rate of 98% in 
liver with core temperature that reached 52°C (liver 1) and 
equivalent survival rates of 95% and 48% at core tempera-
tures of 56°C and 66°C (livers 2 and 3). Liver 4 reached a 
maximum temperature of 70°C, but the temperature was 
not held for the recommended 2 minutes; predicted Campy-
lobacter survival rate was 22%. Livers 6 and 7 met the FSA 
guidelines, and their predicted Campylobacter survival rate 
was <0.001%.
Preferences and Knowledge of the Public
Of the 1,030 members of the public surveyed, 43.0% ate 
chicken livers and hence were asked to select the chicken

liver dishes they preferred and which they thought met 
FSA guidelines. Half (49.3%) of all male respondents 
and 38.4% of all female respondents ate chicken livers. 
Rates of chicken liver consumption varied by age group: 
18–34 years, 34.7%; 35–44 years, 44.7%; 45–54 years, 
49.0%, 55–64 years: 51.5%; and >65: 42.9%. Chicken 
livers were eaten by half (51.0%) of respondents be-
longing to UK socioeconomic grouping ABC1 (upper, 
middle, and lower middle class) and 32.3% of those be-
longing to C2DE (working class and those at the lowest 
level of subsistence).
Members of the public poorly identified whether a 
chicken liver met FSA guidelines for safe cooking (Fig-
ure 3). Thirty percent identified livers 1–3 as being safe to 
eat; the predicted rates of Campylobacter survival in these 
livers were 48%–98%. Another 22% thought that liver 4 
(Campylobacter survival rate 22%) was safe to eat.
No significant difference was found between the 
public’s choices of FSA-compliant livers and their pref-
erences when dining out (p = 0.776, Wilcoxon signed-
rank test; n = 386) (Figure 4); respondents were consistent 
between what they wanted to eat and what they thought 
was safe. Respondents showed a significant preference for 
pinker livers when eating out rather than at home (p = 
0.007, Wilcoxon signed-rank test; n = 446). Paradoxical-
ly, respondents reported being more concerned about food 
safety when eating out than at home (p<0.001, Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test; n = 999).
Ordered logit results (not reported) identified no sys-
tematic differences in rareness preferences by respondent 
sex, age, or class. Livers that were more pink were preferred 
by respondents who described themselves as adventurous 
(p<0.030, n = 444) and who were less concerned about res-
taurant food safety (p<0.001, n = 444).
Perceptions and Knowledge of Chefs
Among the 143 chefs, of those who indicated their sex, 
134 (88%) were male. Among the 141 who indicated their 
type of work, 31.9% worked in fine dining, 17% in contract 
catering, 11.3% in casual restaurants, 5.7% in pubs, and 
19.1% in multiple kitchen types. The most commonly held 
position among 131 chefs who responded was head chef 
(54.0%), followed by chef trainer (11.5%), chef de partie 
(10.7%), commis chef (6.9%), and sous chef (6.1%).

 RESEARCH
Chefs were much better than members of the public 
at identifying whether a chicken liver met FSA guidelines; 
only 9.8% of chefs (vs. 30% of the public) selected liv-
ers 1–3 as being FSA compliant (Figure 5), and another 
19.8% thought that liver 4 met FSA guidelines. Although 
they outperformed the public, 30% of the chefs identified 
livers with Campylobacter survival rates of 22%–98% as 
being FSA compliant.
Chefs preferred to serve livers more pink than they 
thought would meet FSA guidelines (p<0.001, Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test; n = 143) (Figure 5). Chefs also preferred 
to serve livers substantially more pink than the public pre-
ferred when eating out (p<0.001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
2-sample test). Chefs’ perceptions of customers’ preferenc-
es for rareness differed significantly from customer’s true 
preferences: not only did chefs prefer to serve livers more 
rare than customers wanted them served, they also thought 
that customers wanted chicken livers more rare than the 
customers themselves indicated (p = 0.008, Kolmogorov-
Smirnov 2-sample test).
As with the members of the public, in the ordered logit 
model to explain serving preferences, chef preference for 
pinkness of served livers did not vary according to chef char-
acteristics such as age, sex, and class. The only significant 
results indicated that chefs holding senior positions preferred 
to serve liver more pink than did their less experienced col-
leagues holding junior kitchen positions (p = 0.002).
Culinary Trends
Almost half (47.8%) of the members of the public sampled 
agreed that “cooking programmes on TV and/or recipes 
in magazines have influenced the way the general pub-
lic cook meat, people now serve it pinker in the middle.” 
Among chefs, >45% agreed that they had noticed a trend of 
 
rarer and pinker chicken livers on television, in recipes, and 
among other chefs.
Discussion
Members of the public poorly identified whether chicken 
livers had been cooked to a safe microbiological state. 
Their preferences for chicken livers were consistent with 
their (often inaccurate) perceptions of safely cooked livers. 
Among chefs, these variables differed; chefs outperformed 
the public at identifying whether chicken livers had been 
cooked to FSA guidelines. We found that chef preferenc-
es for serving chicken livers were inconsistent with their 
perceptions of safe cooking—they preferred to serve liv-
ers more rare than is microbiologically safe and believed 
that their customers also prefer them more rare than is safe. 
Chefs systematically overpredicted their customers’ prefer-
ences for pinkness of livers served. This finding probably 
means that an estimated 19%–52% of livers being served 
in commercial UK food establishments fail to reach a core 
temperature of 70°C and could have Campylobacter sur-
vival rates of 48%–98%.
Chefs preferred rarer livers than the FSA guidelines 
would recommend. Chefs (correctly) thought that custom-
ers preferred livers less rare than their own preferences 
(p<0.001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test), but they still overes-
timated customers’ preference for pinkness. Chefs’ prefer-
ences, rather than their ignorance of FSA microbiological 
guidelines, seem to be leading them to serve undercooked 
livers. This finding resonates with previous findings that 
knowledge is not necessarily a driver of behavior (21–23). 
We contend that the explanation for the discrepancy be-
tween cooking practices and recommended guidelines is a 
cultural one, resulting in preferences for taste and texture 
overriding the desire to avoid foodborne illness (24–26). 
In extremis, this preference ultimately led chef Raymond

 Cooking Trends and Campylobacter Infection
Blanc to remove liver dishes from the menu rather than in-
crease cooking times/temperatures after cases of campylo-
bacteriosis were attributed to diners having eaten liver in 
his restaurant (27).
The public health implications of the contrast be-
tween chef preferences and safe practices depend largely 
on what chefs provide for customers. Given that chefs 
prefer livers more pink than they believe customers do, 
we take the chef perception of customer preference as 
the lower bound and chefs’ own preference as the upper 
bound on the rareness of chicken livers served. This find-
ing implies that 18.9%–51.7% of livers being served in 
commercial UK food establishments are failing to reach 
a core temperature of 70°C and have Campylobacter sur-
vival rates of 48%–98% (Figure 6). Extending the range 
of livers considered unsafe to liver 4 from our testing 
implies that 38.5%–68.5% of chicken livers being served 
commercially may have Campylobacter survival rates 
 
of 22%–98%.
This preference for rare chicken livers is part of a 
broader shift in contemporary cooking culture toward rarer 
meats, a trend that is reflected in the mass media (28,29) 
but not yet in the peer-reviewed literature. Periodically, the 
preference among chefs for serving rarer meat results in 
conflicts with recommendations of public health officials 
(30–32). The trend toward serving meat more pink has now 
extended from meats such as beefsteaks to meats such as 
chicken livers, for which the microbiological risks associ-
ated with rareness are far greater.
Our interdisciplinary approach, using relatively large 
samples of chefs and members of the general public, pro-
vides a unique insight into the possible public health im-
plications of a divergence between preferences and safe 
cooking. A limitation of our approach is basing selec-
tion of preferred dishes on visual inspection alone. How-
ever, an experimental design that enabled respondents to 
physically assess cooked dishes would have severely lim-
ited study size. Another limitation is use of a laboratory- 
cultured inoculum, which might be less heat resistant 
than naturally occurring bacteria. Therefore, the projected 
death rates might be overestimated, and undercooked liv-
ers might pose even more of a risk than this study sug-
gests. Our results relate to the C. jejuni M1 strain only; 
other Campylobacter strains may exhibit different survival 
characteristics. Campylobacter survival is reported here in 
terms of presence or absence, not as colony counts. Re-
sults indicate public risk for exposure to Campylobacter, 
not risk for infection or subsequent illness. The low doses 
required for infection and illness (33,34) are part of a sto-
chastic process that can happen at any dose, suggesting 
that the presence of any Campylobacter in cooked livers 
poses a public health threat.
Because all experimental livers were inoculated 
with Campylobacter, our results have been framed in 
terms of probability of Campylobacter survival rather 
than exposure. Hence, our reported rates at which chefs 
serve Camplyobacter-positive livers may be slightly 
overestimated.
The temperature–survival results presented here, sup-
ported by those of Whyte et al. (15), suggest that the chick-
en liver cooking techniques practiced by many chefs, and 
promoted in the culinary and mass media, are leading to 
increased exposure to Campylobacter. The role of celebrity 
chefs and the mass media in pushing the trend toward serv-
ing pink meat were evident in our results. Recipes by top 
chefs frequently recommend serving chicken livers pink in 
the middle in warm salads, pâtés, and parfaits (35,36). This 
trend toward pink resonates with our estimate, based on our 
survey and experimental results, that 19%–52% of livers 
served in UK food outlets do not reach a core temperature 
of 70°C and our predicted Campylobacter survival rates of 
48%–98%. Given Campylobacter prevalence rates among 
UK retail chicken livers (81%–100% externally, 90% inter-
nally [15,37]), our results suggest that contemporary cook-
ing trends are leading to the “gourmet-fication” of food-
borne disease.
