BACKGROUND
Nivolumab and ipilimumab are immune checkpoint inhibitors that have been ap-
proved for the treatment of advanced melanoma. In the United States, ipilimumab 
has also been approved as adjuvant therapy for melanoma on the basis of recur-
rence-free and overall survival rates that were higher than those with placebo in a 
phase 3 trial. We wanted to determine the efficacy of nivolumab versus ipilimu-
mab for adjuvant therapy in patients with resected advanced melanoma.
METHODS
In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 906 pa-
tients (≥15 years of age) who were undergoing complete resection of stage IIIB, 
IIIC, or IV melanoma to receive an intravenous infusion of either nivolumab at a 
dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks (453 patients) or ipilimu-
mab at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram every 3 weeks for four doses and then every 
12 weeks (453 patients). The patients were treated for a period of up to 1 year or 
until disease recurrence, a report of unacceptable toxic effects, or withdrawal of 
consent. The primary end point was recurrence-free survival in the intention-to-
treat population.
RESULTS
At a minimum follow-up of 18 months, the 12-month rate of recurrence-free sur-
vival was 70.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 66.1 to 74.5) in the nivolumab 
group and 60.8% (95% CI, 56.0 to 65.2) in the ipilimumab group (hazard ratio for 
disease recurrence or death, 0.65; 97.56% CI, 0.51 to 0.83; P<0.001). Treatment-
related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 14.4% of the patients in the 
nivolumab group and in 45.9% of those in the ipilimumab group; treatment was 
discontinued because of any adverse event in 9.7% and 42.6% of the patients, re-
spectively. Two deaths (0.4%) related to toxic effects were reported in the ipilimu-
mab group more than 100 days after treatment.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients undergoing resection of stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV melanoma, adjuvant 
therapy with nivolumab resulted in significantly longer recurrence-free survival 
and a lower rate of grade 3 or 4 adverse events than adjuvant therapy with ipilimu-
mab. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical; CheckMate 238

Nivolumab vs. Ipilimumab in Stage III or IV Melanoma
I
pilimumab 
(Yervoy, 
Bristol-Myers 
Squibb), a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody 
against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, and 
nivolumab (Opdivo, Bristol-Myers Squibb), a human 
IgG4 monoclonal antibody against programmed 
death 1 (PD-1), are approved for monotherapy 
and combination therapy in several countries 
worldwide for the treatment of patients with 
metastatic melanoma on the basis of the results 
of phase 3 randomized trials.1-4 In 2015, the 
Food and Drug Administration approved ipilimu-
mab as adjuvant therapy in patients with resected 
stage III melanoma on the basis of recurrence-
free survival in a randomized, placebo-controlled, 
phase 3 trial.5 In that trial, at 5 years of follow-
up, the use of ipilimumab resulted in a higher 
rate of overall survival than placebo (65.4% vs. 
54.4%), along with a higher rate of distant metas-
tasis–free survival.6 Quality-of-life analysis sup-
ported the benefit of ipilimumab treatment 
despite a rate of grade 3 or 4 immune-related 
adverse events of 42%.6,7 Nonetheless, by 5 years, 
more than half of all ipilimumab-treated pa-
tients had had a relapse and more than one third 
had died.
Further improvement in the outcome for pa-
tients with stage III disease is needed. Patients 
with resected stage IV melanoma, a population 
that is generally excluded from phase 3 trials of 
adjuvant therapy, are in need of treatments that 
improve their survival. The outcome in patients 
with resected stage IV disease is determined 
according to tumor substage, and the rates of 
recurrence-free and overall survival are generally 
lower than those among patients with stage IIIC 
disease.8 A better outcome is predicted by such 
factors as nonvisceral disease sites, the involve-
ment of fewer organs, and a longer time until 
the diagnosis of metastatic disease.9
PD-1–blocking antibodies have shown a favor-
able safety profile with better efficacy and dura-
bility than those reported with ipilimumab in 
unresectable stage IV melanoma.10,11 Because PD-1 
blockade acts primarily within the tumor micro-
environment,12 the possibility of providing ben-
efit as adjuvant therapy in patients with micro-
scopic disease required formal exploration.13 
Nivolumab has been assessed in a small, single-
group study as adjuvant therapy in patients with 
resected stage IIIC and IV melanoma, and re-
sults showed favorable rates of relapse-free and 
overall survival.14 Here, we report efficacy and 
safety data from a prespecified interim analysis 
of a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial 
(CheckMate 238) evaluating nivolumab versus 
ipilimumab in patients with resected stage IIIB, 
IIIC, or IV melanoma.
Methods
Patients
Eligible patients were 15 years of age or older 
and had stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV melanoma, accord-
ing to the 2009 classification of the American 
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), seventh edi-
tion8 (Tables S1 and S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this arti-
cle at NEJM.org). All the patients had an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status 
score of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with higher 
numbers indicating greater disability) and histo-
logically confirmed melanoma with metastases 
to regional lymph nodes or distant metastases 
that had been surgically resected. Complete re-
gional lymphadenectomy or resection was re-
quired within 12 weeks before randomization. 
Patients with resected brain metastases were 
eligible to participate in the trial. Key exclusion 
criteria included ocular or uveal melanoma, a his-
tory of autoimmune disease, previous nonmela-
noma cancer without complete remission for 
more than 3 years, systemic use of glucocorti-
coids, and previous systemic therapy for mela-
noma. A complete list of inclusion and exclusion 
criteria is provided in the protocol, available at 
NEJM.org.
Trial Design and Regimen
From March 30, 2015, to November 30, 2015, we 
enrolled patients at 130 centers in 25 countries. 
Registration was performed centrally by Bristol-
Myers Squibb, the trial sponsor. Randomization 
was stratified according to disease stage (stage 
IIIB or IIIC, stage IV M1a or M1b, or stage IV 
M1c, according to the AJCC criteria) and status 
regarding programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
(negative or intermediate vs. positive) on the basis 
of a 5% cutoff with PD-L1 staining only of tumor 
cells, preferably in the most recently resected 
lesion. (Nivolumab blocks the binding of PD-1 
by its ligand PD-L1, which can restore the im-
mune function of T cells.) Clinical investigators 
and those collecting or analyzing the data were 
unaware of trial-group assignments.
Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
an intravenous infusion of either nivolumab at a

dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 
2 weeks or ipilimumab at a dose of 10 mg per 
kilogram every 3 weeks for four doses and then 
every 12 weeks, along with corresponding match-
ing placebo (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Treatment was administered for up to 1 year 
or until disease recurrence, a report of unaccept-
able toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent. The 
rules regarding the withholding of a treatment 
dose and the management of immune-related 
adverse events are described in the protocol.
Trial End Points
The primary end point was recurrence-free sur-
vival in the intention-to-treat population. Second-
ary end points included overall survival, safety 
and side-effect profiles, recurrence-free survival 
according to tumor PD-L1 expression, and health-
related quality of life. Distant metastasis–free 
survival was an exploratory end point.
Assessments
All the patients were to be assessed for recur-
rence every 12 weeks for the first 2 years after 
randomization and every 6 months thereafter 
until 5 years had elapsed. At each staging visit, 
the assessments included a physical examination, 
computed tomography (of the chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis), and magnetic resonance imaging or 
computed tomography of the brain. Other imag-
ing was performed if indicated. Recurrent lesions 
were histologically confirmed whenever possible. 
The first date that recurrence was observed was 
used in the analysis, regardless of the imaging 
method that was used.
Recurrence-free survival was defined as the 
time from randomization until the date of the 
first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metas-
tasis), new primary melanoma, or death from 
any cause. Data regarding adverse events were 
collected for each group according to the Com-
mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, ver-
sion 4.0. Immune-related selected adverse events 
were determined on the basis of a prespecified 
list of terms from the Medical Dictionary for Regula-
tory Activities, which was updated according to 
each new version. Health-related quality of life 
was assessed at baseline, at weeks 5, 7, 11, 17, 
25, 37, and 49, and then at two follow-up visits 
(the first 30 days after the last dose and the 
second approximately 84 days after the first 
follow-up) with the use of the European Organi-
zation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 
(EORTC) QLQ-C30 Questionnaire, version 3,15 
and the European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions 
(EQ-5D) summary index and visual-analogue 
scale.16 Additional descriptions of assessment 
methods are provided in the Methods section in 
the Supplementary Appendix.
Trial Oversight
The protocol and amendments for this trial were 
reviewed by the institutional review board or 
ethics committee at each trial site. The trial was 
conducted in accordance with Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines as defined by the Interna-
tional Conference on Harmonisation. All the pa-
tients provided written informed consent before 
enrollment. The trial was designed by the senior 
academic authors and representatives of the spon-
sor, Bristol-Myers Squibb. Data were collected by 
the sponsor and analyzed in collaboration with 
all the authors. Ono Pharmaceutical provided 
funding but was not involved in the trial design, 
final data collection, or analysis.
A data and safety monitoring committee pro-
vided oversight of safety and efficacy and as-
sessed the conduct of the trial in light of an ac-
ceptable risk–benefit profile for nivolumab and 
ipilimumab. The committee also reviewed the 
formal interim analysis of recurrence-free sur-
vival, after which the results were disclosed to 
the sponsor. The first draft of the manuscript 
was written by the first author, and all the au-
thors contributed to subsequent drafts and pro-
vided final approval before submission for pub-
lication. Writing and other editorial assistance 
was provided by StemScientific and funded by 
the sponsor. All the authors vouch for the accu-
racy and completeness of the data and the analy-
ses reported and also confirm adherence to the 
protocol.
Statistical Analysis
A sample of 800 patients was planned for a final 
analysis of recurrence-free survival that was time-
driven (rather than event-driven) at a minimum 
of 36 months of follow-up for all patients. Re-
cruitment was rapid owing to high unmet need, 
and approximately 900 patients who had already 
signed consent forms underwent randomization. 
Although 507 events of recurrence-free survival 
were initially anticipated, we revised that num-
ber to 450 for the final analysis on the basis of

Nivolumab vs. Ipilimumab in Stage III or IV Melanoma
the distribution of patients according to AJCC 
disease stage, a slower event rate, a higher cure 
rate, and a higher rate of early withdrawal from 
the trial. We determined that the occurrence of 
450 events would provide a power of 85% to 
detect a hazard ratio for disease recurrence or 
death of 0.75 (under the 0.83 cutoff for signifi-
cance) with an overall two-sided type I error rate 
of 0.05. A protocol amendment mandated the 
performance of an interim analysis at 18 months 
of follow-up for all the patients. For that analysis 
(presented here), 360 of the 450 events (80%) 
had occurred. The stopping boundary was de-
rived on the basis of the 360 events with the use 
of a Lan–DeMets alpha spending function with 
O’Brien–Fleming boundaries. The critical hazard 
ratio was 0.78 with an adjusted alpha level of 
0.0244 (two-sided). No adjustments for multiple 
inferences were used in the analysis except for 
the primary analysis of recurrence-free survival, 
which was adjusted for the interim analysis. Ad-
ditional descriptions of statistical methods are 
provided in the Methods section in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
The main analyses of the efficacy end points 
included all the patients who had undergone ran-
domization, according to the intention-to-treat 
principle. Safety was assessed in patients who 
had received at least one dose of a trial drug in 
an analysis that included events that were re-
ported between the receipt of the first dose and 
30 days after the last dose of a trial drug.
Results
Patients
A total of 906 patients underwent randomiza-
tion, and 905 were treated (Fig. S2 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). At the clinical data cutoff 
of May 15, 2017, the minimum follow-up was 18 
months (median, 19.5) for all the patients. The 
demographic and other baseline characteristics 
of the patients were similar in the two groups 
(Table 1, and Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). At the time of this analysis, all 905 
treated patients were no longer receiving the 
trial drug. The median number of doses was 24 
(range, 1 to 26) in the nivolumab group and 4 
(range, 1 to 7) in the ipilimumab group. A total 
of 397 patients had completed 1 year of treatment: 
275 of 452 patients (60.8%) in the nivolumab 
group and 122 of 453 patients (26.9%) in the 
ipilimumab group (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Overall, subsequent anticancer ther-
apy (including radiotherapy, surgery, and sys-
temic therapy) was administered in 129 patients 
(28.5%) in the nivolumab group and in 171 
(37.7%) in the ipilimumab group (Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Efficacy
Intention-to-Treat Population
At the time of this report, the median recurrence-
free survival had not been reached in either treat-
ment group. At 12 months, the rate of recur-
rence-free survival was 70.5% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 66.1 to 74.5) in the nivolumab group 
and 60.8% (95% CI, 56.0 to 65.2) in the ipilimu-
mab group; at 18 months, the corresponding 
rates were 66.4% (95% CI, 61.8 to 70.6) and 
52.7% (95% CI, 47.8 to 57.4). Treatment with 
nivolumab also showed benefit on the basis of 
investigator assessment; the use of nivolumab 
resulted in significantly longer recurrence-free 
survival than the use of ipilimumab, with recur-
rence or death reported by investigators in 154 of 
453 patients (34.0%) and in 206 of 453 patients 
(45.5%), respectively (hazard ratio for disease 
recurrence or death, 0.65; 97.56% CI, 0.51 to 
0.83; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A).
Tumor PD-L1 Expression
Prespecified subgroup analyses of recurrence-free 
survival according to tumor PD-L1 expression 
showed hazard ratios favoring the nivolumab 
group, consistent with the primary analysis; how-
ever, these analyses were not adjusted for multiple 
comparisons. Among the patients with PD-L1 
expression of less than 5%, the 12-month recur-
rence-free survival rate was 64.3% (95% CI, 58.3 
to 69.7) in the nivolumab group and 53.7% (95% 
CI, 47.6 to 59.4) in the ipilimumab group (Fig. 1B). 
Among those with PD-L1 expression of 5% or 
more, the 12-month recurrence-free survival rate 
was 81.9% (95% CI, 74.7 to 87.2) in the nivolumab 
group and 73.8% (95% CI, 65.9 to 80.1) in the 
ipilimumab group (Fig. 1C).
Disease Stage and Other Subgroup Analyses
The median recurrence-free survival had not been 
reached in patients with stage III or stage IV dis-
ease in the nivolumab group. Patients with either 
stage of disease in the ipilimumab group had 
less benefit than those in the nivolumab group.

Expression.
Panel A shows Kaplan–Meier estimates of recurrence‑free survival in the intention‑to‑treat population. Patients were 
followed for a minimum of 18 months. At 12 months, the rate of recurrence‑free survival was 70.5% in the nivolumab 
group and 60.8% in the ipilimumab group. In addition, significantly longer recurrence‑free survival was observed in 
the nivolumab group than in the ipilimumab group. Among the patients who were evaluated for tumor expression of 
programmed death ligand 1 (PD‑L1), the 12‑month rate of recurrence‑free survival was 64.3% in the nivolumab group 
and 53.7% in the ipilimumab group among those with PD‑L1 expression of less than 5% (Panel B) and 81.9% and 
73.8%, respectively, among those with PD‑L1 expression of 5% or more (Panel C). CI denotes confidence interval.

Among the patients with stage IIIB or IIIC dis-
ease, the 12-month recurrence-free survival rate 
was 72.3% (95% CI, 67.4 to 76.7) in the nivolu-
mab group and 61.6% (95% CI, 56.3 to 66.5) in 
the ipilimumab group (Fig. 2A). Among those 
with stage IV disease, the 12-month recurrence-
free survival rate was 63.0% (95% CI, 51.6 to 
72.5) in the nivolumab group and 57.5% (95% CI, 
46.0 to 67.4) in the ipilimumab group (Fig. 2B). 
The use of nivolumab resulted in significantly 
longer recurrence-free survival than the use of 
ipilimumab, with recurrence or death reported 
in 120 of 367 patients (32.7%) in the nivolumab 
group and in 163 of 366 patients (44.5%) in the 
ipilimumab group among those with stage IIIB 
or IIIC disease (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51 
to 0.82) and in 33 of 82 patients (40.2%) in the 
nivolumab group and in 43 of 87 patients (49.4%) 
in the ipilimumab group among those with 
stage IV disease (hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.45 
to 1.10). In addition, a benefit for nivolumab was 
observed with respect to recurrence-free survival 
in nearly every subgroup tested, including those 
defined according to age, sex, disease stage,

Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
Adverse events of any cause were reported in 
96.9% of the patients in the nivolumab group 
and in 98.5% of those in the ipilimumab group 
(Table 2). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that inves-
tigators deemed to be related to a trial drug were 
reported in 14.4% of the patients in the nivolum-
ab group and in 45.9% of those in the ipilimu-
mab group. The rate of serious adverse events of 
any grade was 17.5% in the nivolumab group 
and 40.4% in the ipilimumab group. During the 
trial, adverse events of any grade that resulted in 
the discontinuation of a trial drug were reported 
in 9.7% of the patients in the nivolumab group 
and in 42.6% of those in the ipilimumab group; 
grade 3 or 4 adverse events that resulted in such 
discontinuation were reported in 4.6% and 
30.9% of the patients, respectively. In addition, 
adverse events leading to discontinuation that 
were related to a trial drug, as determined by 
investigators, were less frequent in the nivolu-
mab group than in the ipilimumab group (7.7% 
vs. 41.7%). There were 2 deaths (0.4%) from 
toxic effects (marrow aplasia and colitis, both 
of which occurred more than 100 days after the 
last dose) in the ipilimumab group and no

Nivolumab vs. Ipilimumab in Stage III or IV Melanoma
treatment-related deaths in the nivolumab group. 
Selected adverse events involving the skin, gastro-
intestinal tract, liver, and lungs that were deemed 
to be related to a trial drug were less frequent in 
the nivolumab group than in the ipilimumab 
group (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The median time until the onset of select adverse 
events that were deemed to be related to a trial 
drug was generally shorter among patients receiv-
ing ipilimumab; the time until the resolution of 
such events was similar in the two groups, with 
the exception of skin disorders, which took longer 
to resolve in the nivolumab group (Table S6 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Quality of Life
Quality-of-life scores in the two groups remained 
close to baseline values without any clinically 
meaningful changes with respect to the score on 
the EORTC QLQ-C30 Global Health Status or on 
any of the individual scales, as well as to scores 
on the EQ-5D utility index and the EQ-5D visual-
analogue scale (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Discussion
Among patients with stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV mela-
noma, the adjuvant use of nivolumab resulted in 
a significantly longer recurrence-free survival than 
the use of ipilimumab at 12 months. In addition, 
longer distant metastasis–free survival was ob-
served in the nivolumab group than in the ipilimu-
mab group, although this comparison was per-
formed as an exploratory analysis. At the time of 
this analysis, all the patients in the trial had 
finished treatment with a minimum follow-up 
of 18 months.
The results from the prespecified subgroup 
analyses according to PD-L1 status showed a bene-
fit for nivolumab as compared with ipilimumab, 
a benefit that was also seen in all subgroups, in-
cluding those defined according to age, sex, dis-
ease stage, microscopic versus macroscopic nodal 
disease, ulceration status of the primary tumor, 
and BRAF status, although these comparisons 
were not adjusted for multiple comparisons.17,18 
In an ongoing analysis, we are investigating 
biomarkers for both nivolumab and ipilimumab 
using cryopreserved samples of peripheral-blood 
cells and serum obtained during the trial.
Patients appeared to benefit more from nivo 
l-
umab than from ipilimumab regardless of PD-L1 
status. Among the patients with tumor PD-L1 
expression of less than 5%, recurrence was re-
ported in 114 of 275 patients in the nivolumab 
group and in 143 of 286 patients in the ipilimu-
mab group (hazard ratio, 0.71); among those 
with tumor PD-L1 expression of 5% or more, 
recurrence events were reported in 31 of 152 
patients in the nivolumab group and in 57 of 
154 patients in the ipilimumab group (hazard 
ratio, 0.50) (Fig. 1B and 1C). As was previously 
shown in patients with metastatic disease, we 
found that patients who received nivolumab as 
adjuvant therapy after tumor resection derived 
benefit regardless of BRAF status. The mature 
results of the BRIM8 and COMBI-AD trials of 
adjuvant therapy involving patients with stage III 
melanoma, in which vemurafenib and dabrafenib 
plus trametinib, respectively, are being investi-
gated against placebo, are expected later this 
year and may also provide additional options for 
patients with BRAF mutations.
In our trial, the rate of recurrence-free survival 
at 1 year in the ipilimumab group was 60.8%. 
That finding was consistent with the rate in the 
EORTC 18071 trial (63.5%), in which the same 
ipilimumab dose was used for 3 years; that trial 
included patients with stage IIIA melanoma in 
addition to those with stages IIIB and IIIC but 
excluded patients with stage IV melanoma.5 Re-
cent data from an interim analysis of the E1609 
trial of adjuvant therapy, in which patients with 
resected stage III melanoma received either 3 mg 
or 10 mg of ipilimumab per kilogram, suggested 
that the rates of recurrence-free survival at both 
12 months and 18 months were generally higher 
than those with ipilimumab in our trial, but the 
patient population of E1609 also had a lower risk 
of recurrence (no stage IV M1c).19 In contrast to 
these studies, our trial included patients with 
stage IV disease. Although in the nivolumab 
group, the rate of recurrence-free survival was 
higher among patients with stage III disease 
than among those with stage IV disease, the 
patients with stage IV disease also benefited, 
with a 12-month rate of recurrence-free survival 
of 63.0% with nivolumab, as compared with 
57.5% with ipilimumab (Fig. 2).
In the safety analysis, nivolumab was associ-
ated with lower rates of adverse events that were 
deemed to be related to treatment (particularly, 
grade 3 or 4 adverse events, serious adverse

events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, 
and selected adverse events) than ipilimumab. 
Such grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 
14.4% of the patients in the nivolumab group 
and in 45.9% of those in the ipilimumab group 
and led to discontinuation in 3.5% and 30.0%, 
respectively. Although the two treatment groups 
remained close to baseline values with respect to 
measures of quality of life, during the first 12 
weeks of ipilimumab induction, there were lower 
quality-of-life scores in the ipilimumab group 
than in the nivolumab group, but the difference 
was not seen as clinically important.
The recurrence-free survival benefit observed 
in the EORTC 18071 trial comparing ipilimumab 
with placebo translated into a significant overall 
survival benefit. It is unclear whether longer 
follow-up will lead to a similar survival benefit 
with nivolumab relative to ipilimumab in our 
trial, since the data are not yet mature. In ad-
dition, the possibility of crossover after relapse 
owing to the availability of ipilimumab, nivolu-
mab, and pembrolizumab for the treatment of 
metastatic disease in North America, Australia, 
and Europe during the trial period may compli-
cate the interpretation of survival data.
The recently published results of the second 
Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial, 
which suggest that patients with stage III mela-
noma with microscopic nodal disease may no 
longer need to undergo completion lymphade-
nectomy after a positive sentinel-node biopsy, may 
alter the applicability of our results to future pa-
tients.20 In our trial, all the patients with stage III 
nodal disease underwent completion lymphade-
nectomy; 28% of the patients with stage III dis-
ease in the nivolumab group and 30% of those 
in the ipilimumab group had microscopic disease. 
In addition, it is possible that the early reporting 
of recurrence-free survival could add potential bias 
in an overestimation of the treatment effect of 
nivolumab. However, many other melanoma trials 
that were stopped early have shown consistency 
between the interim findings and the final results. 
Given the substantial benefit that is provided by 
PD-1 antibodies used in combination or as mono-
therapy in patients with metastatic disease, an 
additional question is whether adjuvant check-
point blockade after resection is necessary or 
should be reserved with the hope of equal benefit 
for patients who have a relapse with unresectable 
disease after surgery for stage III or IV melanoma.
In conclusion, we found that adjuvant therapy 
with nivolumab among patients with resected 
stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV melanoma resulted in sig-
nificantly longer recurrence-free survival and a 
better safety profile than adjuvant therapy with 
ipilimumab.
