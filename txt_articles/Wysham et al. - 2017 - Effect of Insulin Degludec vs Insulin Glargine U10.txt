IMPORTANCE Hypoglycemia, a serious risk for insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes,
negatively affects glycemic control.
OBJECTIVE To test whether treatment with basal insulin degludec is associated with a lower
rate of hypoglycemia compared with insulin glargine U100 in patients with type 2 diabetes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, double-blind, treat-to-target crossover
trial including two 32-week treatment periods, each with a 16-week titration period and a
16-week maintenance period. The trial was conducted at 152 US centers between January
2014 and December 2015 in 721 adults with type 2 diabetes and at least 1 hypoglycemia risk
factor who were previously treated with basal insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once-daily insulin degludec followed
byinsulinglargineU100(n = 361)ortoreceiveinsulinglargineU100followedbyinsulindegludec
(n = 360) and randomized 1:1 to morning or evening dosing within each treatment sequence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the rate of overall symptomatic
hypoglycemicepisodes(severeorbloodglucoseconfirmed[<56mg/dL])duringthemaintenance
period. Secondary end points were the rate of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes
(severeorbloodglucoseconfirmed,occurringbetween12:01 AMand5:59 AM)andtheproportion
of patients with severe hypoglycemia during the maintenance period.
RESULTS Of the 721 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 61.4 [10.5] years; 53.1% male), 580
(80.4%) completed the trial. During the maintenance period, the rates of overall
symptomatic hypoglycemia for insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 were 185.6 vs 265.4
episodes per 100 patient-years of exposure (PYE) (rate ratio = 0.70 [95% CI, 0.61-0.80];
P < .001; difference, −23.66 episodes/100 PYE [95% CI, −33.98 to −13.33]), and the
proportions of patients with hypoglycemic episodes were 22.5% vs 31.6% (difference, −9.1%
[95% CI, −13.1% to −5.0%]). The rates of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia with insulin
degludec vs insulin glargine U100 were 55.2 vs 93.6 episodes/100 PYE (rate ratio = 0.58
[95% CI, 0.46-0.74]; P < .001; difference, −7.41 episodes/100 PYE [95% CI, −11.98 to −2.85]),
and the proportions of patients with hypoglycemic episodes were 9.7% vs 14.7% (difference,
−5.1% [95% CI, −8.1% to −2.0%]). The proportions of patients experiencing severe
hypoglycemia during the maintenance period were 1.6% (95% CI, 0.6%-2.7%) for insulin
degludec vs 2.4% (95% CI, 1.1%-3.7%) for insulin glargine U100 (McNemar P = .35; risk
difference, −0.8% [95% CI, −2.2% to 0.5%]). Statistically significant reductions in overall and
nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia for insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 were also
seen for the full treatment period.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin and
with at least 1 hypoglycemia risk factor, 32 weeks’treatment with insulin degludec vs insulin
glargine U100 resulted in a reduced rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia.

ypoglycemia and concerns regarding hypoglycemia
are acknowledged as the main limiting factors for
achieving tight glycemic control.1,2 The importance
of good glycemic control in reducing diabetic complications
is well documented.3,4 Insulin is recognized as the most
effective blood glucose–lowering therapy and is often neces-
sary in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) as the dis-
ease progresses.5
The insulin analogs glargine U100 and detemir have lon-
ger half-lives than neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insu-
lin and, at similar hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, reduce the
frequency of overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia in T2D by
42% to 65% and 44% to 53%, respectively, compared with NPH
insulin.6-8 This may be due to lower day-to-day variability vs
NPH insulin.9 With insulin degludec, the day-to-day variabil-
ity has been shown to be lower than that of insulin glargine
U100 and U300.10,11
The insulin degludec phase 3a program included 5 open-
label trials in patients with T2D comparing insulin degludec
with insulin glargine U100.12-14 A prespecified meta-analysis
of these trials showed that at similar HbA1c levels, the rates of
overall and nocturnal confirmed hypoglycemia were 17%
and 32% lower, respectively, with insulin degludec than
with insulin glargine U100.15 The SWITCH 2 trial was
designed to test this hypoglycemia benefit with insulin
degludec, using a double-blind, crossover trial design among
basal insulin–treated patients with T2D who had at least 1 risk
factor for hypoglycemia.
Methods
Trial Design and Participants
The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki and International Conference of Harmonisation
Good Clinical Practice.16,17 Before trial initiation, the proto-
col, consent form, and patient information sheet were
reviewed and approved by appropriate health authorities and
an independent ethics committee or institutional review
board at each site. Written informed consent was obtained
from all participating patients. This randomized, double-
blind, 2-period crossover, multicenter, treat-to-target trial
was conducted in patients with T2D treated with basal insu-
lin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) (Figure 1
and eFigure 1 in Supplement 1), across 152 sites in the United
States between January 2014 and December 2015. The total
trial duration was 65 weeks; this included 32 weeks’treat-
ment with once-daily insulin degludec or insulin glargine
U100 followed by crossover to insulin glargine U100 or insu-
lin degludec, respectively, for a further 32 weeks, plus 1 week
of follow-up (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Each 32-week treat-
ment period consisted of a 16-week titration period (to
reduce potential carryover effects and obtain stable glycemic
control) and a 16-week maintenance period (to compare the
difference in hypoglycemia when glycemic control and dose
were stable).
The inclusion criteria specified adults (aged ≥18 years) di-
agnosed with T2D for at least 26 weeks, an HbA1c level of
9.5% or lower (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin,
multiply by 0.01), body mass index (calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 45 or
lower, and treatment with any basal insulin with or without
OADs (any combination of metformin, dipeptidyl pepti-
dase-4 inhibitor, α-glucosidase inhibitor, thiazolidinediones,
and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor) for at least 26
weeks. To include a broader population of patients with T2D
treated with basal insulin (compared with the phase 3a trials,
which excluded patients with recurrent severe hypoglycemia
or hypoglycemia unawareness) better resembling that
encountered in clinical practice, patients had to fulfill at
least 1 of the following risk criteria for developing hypoglyce-
mia: (1) experienced at least 1 severe hypoglycemic episode
within the last year (based on the American Diabetes Associa-
tion definition18); (2) moderate chronic renal failure (esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate of 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2);
(3) hypoglycemic symptom unawareness; (4) exposure
to insulin for longer than 5 years; or (5) an episode of hypo-
glycemia (symptoms and/or blood glucose level ≤70 mg/dL
[to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) within
the last 12 weeks. Patients treated with bolus or premixed
insulin or with sulfonylurea or meglitinide within 26 weeks be-
fore the first visit were not included. The determination of race
and ethnicity was self-reported by the participant based on
fixed categories.
The trial protocol is available in Supplement 2, and the sta-
tistical analysis plan is available in Supplement 3.
Interventions
Patients were randomized using a trial-specific, interactive-
voice, web-response system using a simple sequential alloca-
tion from a blocked randomization schedule without stratify-
ing factors. Patients were randomized 1:1 to one of the
treatment sequences (insulin degludec followed by insulin
glargine U100 or insulin glargine U100 followed by insulin
degludec) in a blinded manner. Within each treatment
sequence, patients were randomized 1:1 to administer once-
daily basal insulin in either the morning (from waking to
breakfast) or the evening (from main evening meal to bed-
time). Assigned administration timing was maintained
throughout the trial.
Key Points
Question Is the rate of hypoglycemia lower with insulin degludec
vs insulin glargine U100 in insulin-treated patients with type 2
diabetes?
Findings In this randomized crossover clinical trial of 721 patients,
insulin degludec resulted in a significantly lower rate of overall
symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes over a 16-week maintenance
period compared with insulin glargine U100 (186 vs 265 episodes
per 100 patient-years of exposure, respectively).
Meaning Patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin
degludec compared with insulin glargine U100 had a reduced risk
of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia.

 The trial was double blinded, and all involved parties were
blinded to insulin degludec and insulin glargine U100 treat-
ment sequence allocation throughout the trial. To maintain
blinding, insulin degludec 100 U/mL (Novo Nordisk) and in-
sulin glargine 100 U/mL (Sanofi) were both administered sub-
cutaneously using identical vials via syringe. If switching from
once-daily dosing, the starting dose for both treatments was
the pretrial dose; if switching from twice-daily dosing, the pre-
trial dose was reduced by 20% at the investigator’
s discre-
tion.Thestartingdosefortreatmentperiod2wasthedosefrom
the end of treatment period 1.
Patients were supplied with a blood glucose monitor and
instructed to measure their blood glucose level before break-
fast on the 3 days before a visit or telephone contact (weekly)
andalsowheneverahypoglycemicepisodewassuspected.The
insulin dose was titrated once weekly based on the mean of 3
prebreakfast self-measured blood glucose measurements, to
a fasting blood glucose target of 71 to 90 mg/dL. The insulin
dose was adjusted in multiples of 2 U by –4 U to +8 U depend-
ing on prebreakfast self-measured blood glucose level (eTable
1 in Supplement 1). All pretrial OADs were continued at the pre-
trial dose throughout the trial.
End Points
The primary end point was the rate of overall symptomatic hy-
poglycemic episodes (severe [an episode requiring third-
party assistance,18 externally adjudicated] or blood glucose
confirmed[<56mg/dL])duringthemaintenanceperiod(weeks
16-32 and 48-64). The secondary end points were the rate of
nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes (severe or
bloodglucoseconfirmed,occurringbetween12:01AMand5:59
AM [both inclusive]) and the proportion of patients experi-
encing 1 or more severe hypoglycemic episodes, both in the
maintenance period. Other hypoglycemic end points in-
cluded the rates of overall symptomatic, nocturnal sympto-
matic, and severe hypoglycemia for the full treatment pe-
riod, the rate of severe hypoglycemia, and the proportion of
patients experiencing 1 or more overall or nocturnal sympto-
matic episodes in the maintenance period and the full treat-
ment period. The hypoglycemia definition is illustrated in
eFigure 2 in Supplement 1. All severe episodes reported by in-
vestigators or identified via a predefined Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities version 18.1 search of safety data were
adjudicatedprospectivelybyanexternalcommittee;onlythose
confirmedbyadjudicationwereincludedintheanalysis(eTable
2 in Supplement 1).
Efficacy end points measured were change in HbA1c
level, fasting plasma glucose level, and prebreakfast self-
measured blood glucose level after 32 weeks of treatment.
Other safety end points included daily insulin dose, change
from baseline in body weight after 32 weeks, incidence of
adverse events, vital signs (including blood pressure and
pulse), ophthalmoscopy, electrocardiography, and standard
biochemical parameters.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses of all end points were based on the full analysis set
(all randomized patients) following the intention-to-treat
principle. Efficacy end points were summarized for the full
analysis set; safety end points were summarized for the
safety analysis set (patients receiving ≥1 dose of investiga-
tional product or comparator). Full details of the statistical
analysis plan are in Supplement 3. All analyses were con-
ducted using SAS version 9.4 statistical software (SAS Insti-
tute Inc).
Statistical superiority testing of the primary and second-
ary end points was performed following a hierarchical testing
procedure (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1) to control the type I er-
ror rate in the strong sense (ie, the error rate was controlled
whether or not the global null hypothesis was true). Noninfe-
riority in HbA1c level was a prerequisite for both treatment pe-
riods before testing the primary end point. The primary and
secondary analyses were prespecified to be tested using a
1-sided test on a 2.5% level. Other analyses used 2-sided tests
at a 5% level.
The trial was powered to evaluate superiority of the pri-
mary end point. Based on the assumption that up to 10% of
the randomized patients may not contribute to the analysis,
600 patients needed to contribute to the analysis if 668 pa-
tients were randomized, to ensure 88.9% power to demon-
strate a 38% benefit (ie, a rate ratio of 0.62), with an expected
rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia of 0.5 episodes per
patient-year of exposure (PYE).19
A Poisson model with patients as random effect; treat-
ment, period, sequence, and dosing time as fixed effects; and
logarithm of the observation time (100 years) as offset was
prespecified as the primary analysis to estimate the rate ratio
of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia during the mainte-
nance period. Only patients with positive observation time
during the first maintenance period contributed to the esti-
mated treatment ratio. Statistical superiority was considered
confirmed if the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the
estimated rate ratio (ERR) was less than 1. Sensitivity analy-
ses were performed to test the robustness of the results for
the primary end point and for the secondary end point noc-
turnal symptomatic hypoglycemia, using a Poisson model on
the subset of patients exposed in both maintenance periods,
using a Poisson model on completers only, and using a nega-
tive binomial model.
Missing data were explored to ascertain whether the
patients who dropped out before the first maintenance
period differed from those exposed during the first mainte-
nance period, as these patients did not contribute to the pri-
mary analysis, and whether there were any differences
between the 2 treatments in patients who dropped out. The
effects of missing data on the primary analysis were investi-
gated with a post hoc tipping-point analysis. Missing data
were imputed assuming that the rate of hypoglycemia for a
noncompleter was similar to that for a patient completing
the same treatment period who had a similar number of
episodes before the time of withdrawal. The imputed num-
ber of episodes for a patient withdrawing while receiving
insulin degludec was gradually increased until the treatment
contrast between the 2 insulins was no longer significant.
A post hoc analysis of the absolute difference in hypoglyce-
mia rate was conducted using a nonlinear Poisson model

 with a specified mean parameter, measuring the difference
between average nonexisting patients receiving insulin
degludec and insulin glargine U100, respectively (50% treat-
ment period 1; 50% evening dose; 50% treatment sequence
of insulin degludec followed by insulin glargine U100).
McNemar nonparametric test was prespecified to com-
pare the proportion of patients experiencing severe hypogly-
cemiawiththe2treatments.Toquantifythedifferencesinpro-
portions with 95% CI post hoc, a binomial distribution with
correlated measurements was assumed.
ChangefrombaselineinHbA1clevelafter32weeksoftreat-
ment was analyzed separately for each treatment period, using
a mixed model for repeated measurements with an unstruc-
tured covariance matrix, including treatment period, visit, sex,
antidiabetic therapy at screening, and dosing time (morning
vs evening) as fixed effects and age and baseline HbA1c level
as covariates. All fixed factors and covariates are nested within
visit. For the first treatment period, the analysis was con-
ducted using data from all patients with observation time in
the first maintenance period. For the second treatment pe-
riod, the analysis was repeated and all patients with an HbA1c
measurement after crossover contributed to the analysis. Non-
inferiority for HbA1c level was confirmed if the upper bound
of the 1-sided 95% CI for the difference in mean change was
0.4% or less.
A post hoc analysis of insulin dose was conducted for pa-
tients with observation time in maintenance period 1, using a
log-linear mixed model for repeated measurements with treat-
ment, period, dosing time (morning or evening), and visit as
fixed effects, patient as random effect, and the log-
transformed baseline dose as a covariate.
Results
Of 1000 patients screened, 721 (mean age, 61.4 [10.5] years;
53.1% male) were randomized to trial product (50.1% to morn-
ing dosing and 49.9% to evening dosing) and 713 were ex-
posed to trial product (Figure 1). Overall, 580 patients (80.4%)
completed the trial. The proportion of patients withdrawing
and the reasons for withdrawal were similar for both treat-
mentsequences(Figure1).Themostcommonreasonsforwith-
drawal were withdrawal by patient and protocol violation (eg,
not meeting the inclusion criteria, meeting the exclusion cri-
teria, noncompliance, or participation in other trials). Pa-
tients discontinuing prior to the first maintenance period were
similar to patients with observation time in the first mainte-
nance period.
The full analysis set comprised 720 patients; 1 patient was
excluded because of an unsigned casebook. Baseline charac-
teristics, insulin treatment at screening, and pretrial regimen
are summarized in Table 1. At screening, 59 patients (8.2%)
were using NPH insulin, 159 (22.1%) insulin detemir, and 502
(69.7%) insulin glargine U100, with 606 (84.2%) administer-
ing basal insulin once daily and 114 (15.8%) twice daily. Over-
all,570patients(79.1%)werereceiving1ormoreOADs(Table1),
with the majority of patients (66.9%) treated with basal insu-
lin plus metformin at screening.
Primary End Point
The rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia during the
maintenance period was statistically significantly lower with
insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine U100 (185.6
vs 265.4 episodes/100 PYE, respectively; ERR = 0.70 [95% CI,
0.61 to 0.80]; P < .001; rate difference, −23.66 episodes/100
PYE [95% CI, −33.98 to −13.33]) (Figure 2A and Table 2). Sen-
sitivity analyses supported the primary analysis, confirming
the lower rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia with
insulin degludec compared with insulin glargine U100 (all
P < .001) (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1). The post hoc tipping-
point analysis showed that the statistically significant differ-
ence between the 2 treatments remained until each noncom-
pleter receiving insulin degludec was assumed to experience
an additional 4 hypoglycemic episodes compared with 0 epi-
sodes for noncompleters receiving insulin glargine U100. The
additional 4 events for noncompleters receiving insulin
degludec corresponded to an observed rate of 1640 episodes/
100 PYE compared with the observed rate of 184 episodes/
100 PYE for insulin degludec completers (mean number of
events, 5.1 vs 0.6, respectively) (eTable 3 in Supplement 1).
Secondary End Points
The rate of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia was also sta-
tistically significantly lower with insulin degludec vs insulin
glargine U100 during the maintenance period (55.2 vs 93.6 epi-
sodes/100 PYE, respectively; ERR= 0.58 [95% CI, 0.46 to 0.74];
P < .001; rate difference, −7.41 episodes/100 PYE [95% CI,
−11.98 to −2.85]) (Figure 2C and Table 2). Sensitivity analyses
were consistent in showing lower rates of nocturnal sympto-
matic hypoglycemia with insulin degludec vs insulin glargine
U100 (all P < .001) (eFigure 4 in Supplement 1).
The proportion of patients experiencing at least 1 severe
hypoglycemicepisodeduringthemaintenanceperiodwas1.6%
(95% CI, 0.6% to 2.7%) for insulin degludec and 2.4% (95% CI,
1.1% to 3.7%) for insulin glargine U100 (difference, −0.8% [95%
CI, −2.2% to 0.5%]) (Table 2), but this difference was not sta-
tistically significant (P = .35).
Other End Points
Hypoglycemia
For the full treatment period, there were statistically signifi-
cant reductions in the rates of both overall symptomatic hy-
poglycemiaandnocturnalsymptomatichypoglycemiawithin-
sulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 (overall symptomatic
hypoglycemia: 219.9 vs 275.1 episodes/100 PYE, respec-
tively; ERR = 0.77 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.85]; P < .001; rate differ-
ence, −19.4 [95% CI, −27.07 to −11.74]; nocturnal sympto-
matic hypoglycemia: 72.0 vs 88.4 episodes/100 PYE,
respectively; ERR = 0.75 [95% CI, 0.64 to 0.89]; P < .001; rate
difference, −4.4 [95% CI, −7.23 to −1.58]) (Figure 2B and D and
Table 2).
The rate of severe hypoglycemia was not significantly
lower with insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 during
the maintenance period (ERR = 0.54 [95% CI, 0.21 to 1.42];
P = .35; rate difference, −1.18 [95% CI, −2.77 to 0.41]),
although the rate was statistically significantly lower over the
full treatment period (ERR = 0.49 [95% CI, 0.26 to 0.94];

tent with the full treatment period (Table 2).
Glycemic Control
The observed mean (SD) HbA1c level at the end of treatment
period 1 was 7.06% (1.07%) with insulin degludec vs 6.98%
(1.03%) with insulin glargine U100 (estimated treatment dif-
ference [ETD], 0.09% [95% CI, –0.04% to 0.23%]; P < .001 for
noninferiority) and at the end of treatment period 2 was 7.08%
(1.23%) with insulin degludec vs 7.11% (1.15%) with insulin
glargineU100(ETD,0.06%[95%CI,–0.07%to0.18%];P < .001
for noninferiority) (Figure 3). Noninferiority of insulin de-
gludec compared with insulin glargine U100 for HbA1c levels
was confirmed for both treatment periods (Figure 3).

 At the end of treatment period 1, the observed mean (SD)
fasting plasma glucose level decreased in the group treated
with insulin degludec followed by insulin glargine U100
from 139.2 (53.5) mg/dL at baseline to 107.3 (41.7) mg/dL,
with a slight increase when switched to insulin glargine
U100 in treatment period 2 (mean [SD], 114.1 [51.9] mg/dL). A
decrease in the mean (SD) fasting plasma glucose level was
also observed in treatment period 1 of the group treated with
insulin glargine U100 followed by insulin degludec, from
134.9 (51.6) mg/dL at baseline to 107.0 (39.8) mg/dL, which
was maintained when switched to insulin degludec in treat-
ment period 2 (mean [SD], 107.6 [51.3] mg/dL) (eFigure 5A in
Supplement 1). The mean prebreakfast self-measured blood
glucose level (used for dose adjustment) decreased during
the first 16 weeks of the trial in both study treatment groups
and then remained stable for the duration of the trial (eFig-
ure 5B in Supplement 1).
Insulin Dose and Body Weight
At the end of treatment period 1, the observed mean (SD) dose
increased in the group treated with insulin degludec followed
by insulin glargine U100 from 40 (22) U at baseline to 70
(41)U,withafurtherincreasewhenswitchedtoinsulinglargine
U100 in treatment period 2 (mean [SD], 83 [50] U). An in-
crease in dose was also observed in treatment period 1 of the
group treated with insulin glargine U100 followed by insulin
degludec, from 43 (26) U at baseline to 74 (41) U, with a further
increase when switched to insulin degludec in treatment pe-
riod 2 (mean [SD], 83 [54] U) (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). A post
hoc analysis showed that after 32 weeks of treatment, the in-
sulin dose was significantly lower with insulin degludec vs in-
sulin glargine U100 (estimated treatment ratio = 0.96 [95% CI,
0.94 to 0.98]; P < .001).
Mean (SD) weight changes were not significantly differ-
ent between insulin degludec and insulin glargine U100 in

a The prespecified analysis of hypoglycemia was conducted using a
Poisson model with patient as a random effect; treatment, period, sequence,
and dosing time as fixed effects; and logarithm of the exposure time
(100 years) as offset. Statistical superiority was considered confirmed
if the upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the rate ratio was less than 1.
A post hoc analysis of the rate difference was conducted using a nonlinear
Poisson model, and a post hoc analysis comparing the proportion of
patients with events was conducted using a binomial distribution assuming
correlated measurements.
bOverall hypoglycemia was defined as severe (requiring third-party aid, externally
adjudicated) or blood glucose–confirmed (<56 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles
per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) symptomatic episodes; nocturnal hypoglycemia
was defined as severe or blood glucose–confirmed symptomatic episodes
occurring between 12:01 AM and 5:59 AM (both inclusive).
c Only patients who were exposed in the first maintenance period contributed
to the maintenance period analysis (88 patients receiving insulin degludec and
102 patients receiving insulin glargine U100 did not contribute to the analysis
because of no observation time in the first maintenance period).

and treatment period 2 (0.5 [5.1] vs 0.9 [3.7] kg, respectively;
P = .29).
Adverse Events
In the safety analysis set, 384 of 671 patients (57.2%) receiv-
ing insulin degludec and 406 of 665 patients (61.1%) receiv-
ing insulin glargine U100 had adverse events. For insulin de-
gludec and insulin glargine U100, adverse event rates were
332.6 and 360.1 events/100 PYE, respectively, and serious ad-
verse event rates were 20.6 and 25.0 events/100 PYE, respec-
tively (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). The most common adverse
events (≥5% of patients) with both treatments were nasophar-
yngitis and upper respiratory tract infection (7.5% and 6.6%
with insulin degludec and 6.2% and 5.6% with insulin glargine
U100, respectively).
There were 7 deaths during the trial, comprising 2 with
insulin degludec (both cardiovascular-related deaths) and 5
with insulin glargine U100 (1 cardiovascular-related death, 1
with undetermined cause, 1 due to hepatobiliary causes, and
2 due to malignant neoplasms). One death (sepsis and hepa-
tobiliary causes) was assessed by the investigator as possibly
product related (insulin glargine U100). There were a total of
17 major adverse cardiovascular events, comprising 8 with
insulin degludec (5 myocardial infarctions and 3 strokes) and
9 with insulin glargine U100 (4 myocardial infarctions, 1
stroke, 1 death with undetermined cause, and 3 cases of
unstable angina pectoris). During follow-up, an additional
5 confirmed major adverse cardiovascular events occurred
(insulin degludec: 2 cardiovascular-related deaths, 1 nonfatal
stroke; insulin glargine U100: 1 cardiovascular-related death
and 1 nonfatal stroke).
There were no clinically relevant differences in physical
examination results, blood pressure, pulse, electrocardio-
gram findings, ophthalmoscopic examination findings, or bio-
chemical parameters between treatments.
Discussion
Inthisdouble-blind,randomized,treat-to-targetcrossovertrial,
treatment with insulin degludec compared with insulin
glargine U100 resulted in a statistically significant and clini-
cally meaningful20 reduction in the rate of overall sympto-
matic hypoglycemia and nocturnal symptomatic hypoglyce-
miaduringthe16-weekmaintenanceperiod.Thehypoglycemia
findings were consistent when analyzed over the full treat-
mentperiod,andtheyshowedastatisticallysignificantlylower
rate of severe hypoglycemia with insulin degludec. The mag-
nitude of the hypoglycemia reduction observed with insulin
degludec vs insulin glargine U100 is comparable to that re-
ported in earlier trials comparing NPH insulin with insulin
detemir or insulin glargine U100.6-8
Hypoglycemia is a problem for many insulin-treated pa-
tients with T2D,1,2 and its frequency and severity tend to in-
crease with disease progression.21,22 Hypoglycemia in gen-
eral, but especially severe hypoglycemia, represents one of the
most concerning complications of insulin therapy1 and is also
a financial burden for the health care system.22-24
Overall,thehypoglycemiaresultsachievedinthistrialcon-
firm those from the randomized, parallel, open-label, treat-
to-target trials in the phase 3a program for insulin degludec
compared with insulin glargine U100.12-15 In the current trial
and the phase 3a trials, insulin degludec and insulin glargine
U100 were titrated to the same fasting blood glucose target
(71-90 mg/dL) and reached an equivalent, noninferior HbA1c
level. However, this trial used a more specific hypoglycemia
definition, including only episodes that were severe or had
symptoms accompanied by a blood glucose measurement less
than 56 mg/dL, and a timing of insulin administration was ap-
plied to avoid confounding interpretation of the hypoglyce-
mia data. Moreover, the trial was conducted in a patient popu-
lation more closely resembling that encountered in clinical

 practice,includingindividualswithmoderatechronicrenalfail-
ure, hypoglycemia unawareness, and recurrent hypoglyce-
mia. Thus, the rates of severe hypoglycemia observed in this
trial were higher than in the phase 3a program.
The rates of severe hypoglycemia were also higher com-
pared with those in the parallel, open-label, treat-to-target trial
examining the risk of hypoglycemia for insulin glargine U300
(a 300-U/mL formulation of glargine with a half-life of 19
hours)25 vs insulin glargine U100.26 In the EDITION 2 study, a
significant hypoglycemia risk reduction with insulin glargine
U300 vs insulin glargine U100 was primarily observed in the
titration phase26 and could have been due to the described
lower potency of insulin glargine U300, which may lead to a
more protracted titration phase.27
This trial has several limitations. First, the intensive moni-
toringinthetrialsettingmayhaveincreasedthefrequencywith
which hypoglycemia data were collected and reported com-
pared with an actual clinical setting. However, this intensive
monitoring may have provided a more accurate representa-
tion of hypoglycemia rates in the population, including those
with recurrent hypoglycemia, than those derived from obser-
vationalstudies22orrandomizedclinicaltrialsfromwhichsuch
patientsaretypicallyexcluded.Second,thefirstchoiceoftreat-
ment for the trial population in a clinical setting may not have
been once-daily basal insulin. However, during the mainte-
nance period, glycemic control approached the guideline
targets.28 Third, the complication of handling rescue therapy
for patients not at target glycemic control who were in need
of bolus insulin was not included in this trial. Fourth, the
higher-than-expected withdrawal rate may have resulted from
the demanding nature of the trial, including the 64-week du-
ration, 2 different treatments, and the use of vials and sy-
ringes. Fifth, the crossover design may induce a potential car-
ryover effect. However, specifying the primary and secondary
end points during the maintenance period aimed to elimi-
nate the carryover effect of previous insulin treatment follow-
ing the 16-week washout and titration period on hypoglyce-
mic episodes.

Among patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin and
with at least 1 hypoglycemia risk factor, 32 weeks’treatment
with insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 resulted in a re-
duced rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia.
