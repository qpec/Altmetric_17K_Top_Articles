Abstract
Background: There is little evidence on whether becoming re-employed in poor quality
work is better for health and well-being than remaining unemployed. We examined asso-
ciations of job transition with health and chronic stress-related biomarkers among a
population-representative cohort of unemployed British adults.
Methods: A prospective cohort of 1116 eligible participants aged 35 to 75 years, who
were unemployed at wave 1 (2009/10) of the UK Household Longitudinal Study, were
followed up at waves 2 (2010/11) and 3 (2011/12) for allostatic load biomarkers and self-
reported health. Negative binomial and multiple regression models estimated the associ-
ation between job adversity and these outcomes.
Results: Compared with adults who remained unemployed, formerly unemployed adults
who transitioned into poor quality jobs had higher levels of overall allostatic load (0.51,
0.32–0.71), log HbA1c (0.06, <0.001–0.12), log triglycerides (0.39, 0.22–0.56), log C-react-
ive protein (0.45, 0.16–0.75), log fibrinogen (0.09, 0.01–0.17) and total cholesterol to
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio (1.38, 0.88–1.88). Moreover, physically healthier re-
spondents at wave 1 were more likely to transition into good quality and poor quality
jobs after 1 year than those who remained unemployed.
Conclusions: Formerly unemployed adults who transitioned into poor quality work had
greater adverse levels of biomarkers compared with their peers who remained
unemployed. The selection of healthier unemployed adults into these poor quality or
stressful jobs was unlikely to explain their elevated levels of chronic stress-related bio-
markers. Job quality cannot be disregarded from the employment success of the un-
employed, and may have important implications for their health and well-being.
Key words: Re-employment, unemployment, biomarkers, well-being, job quality, allostatic load

 Introduction
Unemployment is associated with poor health1–7 and appro-
priate work can bring health and well-being benefits.8 There
are health benefits of transitioning from unemployment into
employment/re-employment.6,9–15 There is also some evi-
dence that job quality is important for health and well-
being, although other studies suggest that people in poor
quality jobs are still better off in terms of life satisfaction
and well-being than those who remain unemployed.10,16
However, poor quality jobs which combine several psycho-
social stressors could be as bad for health as being un-
employed,17,18 and transitions from unemployment to poor
quality jobs may be even more detrimental to health than re-
maining unemployed.19 Thus the quality of job, including
the presence of stressors such as insecurity, low autonomy
and poor job satisfaction, may be important in determining
whether transitioning into work benefits or harms health.
The existing evidence on re-employment and health/
well-being relies on self-reported measures for both con-
cepts, both of which may be biased by mood or personality
traits. Biomarkers measuring the physiological conse-
quences of chronic stress like allostatic load20 can provide
insights into a person’s health and well-being which are
different from self-reported measures. Unemployment is
associated with adverse levels of common biomarkers
measured in longitudinal studies.21–23 Additionally, most
studies on job quality and health measure job satisfaction,
although there are additional dimensions such as job secur-
ity and work autonomy.24 However, despite the methodo-
logical weakness of existing studies on re-employment and
health, government policy on employment and health often
assumes that the benefits of work outweigh any ‘risks’of
work and the adverse effects of unemployment.8,25
The relationship between health and employment may
be bidirectional:11 unemployment may cause poor health,
and poor health may increase the probability of unemploy-
ment. Observational studies of work and health need to
take account of the selection process into employment.
Health-related selection factors are particularly important,
due to the healthy worker effect–adults with poor health
are selected out of the job market and their health may be
a barrier to employment/re-employment.15,26–28
The aim of the study was to examine the association of
job transition with health and chronic stress-related bio-
markers among a cohort of unemployed British adults. We
were particularly interested in comparing the health of
those who remained unemployed with those who transi-
tioned to poor quality work, and examining whether there
was positive (or negative) health selection into good (or
poor) quality jobs.
Methods
This study draws upon data from the first three waves
of
the
Understanding
Society,
the
UK
Household
Longitudinal Study (UKHLS): a nationally representative
longitudinal study that began in 2009, recruiting over
100 000 individuals in 40 000 households.29 Further details
of the study are available elsewhere.30 In 2010–12 (waves
2 and 3), adult respondents were invited to take part in a
nurse health assessment interview which collected a range
of physiological measures and blood samples.31 A repre-
sentative subsample of 15 591 adults took part in a nurse
health assessment, with a response rate of 58.6%.31
Among those participants, 10 175 (response rate 38.2%)
gave a blood sample and had data on at least one
biomarker.32
Sample
The selection of participants for this study is summarized
in Figure 1. Of the 51 128 original participants at wave 1,
there were 35 828 aged between 30 and 75 years.
Participants were excluded if they were in paid work or if
they were away from a paid job in the previous week
(n ¼ 22 164), if they were not looking for work and were
not be able to start work within 2 weeks (n ¼ 11 404), if
they never had a job or were economically inactive
(n ¼ 147) or if they had missing data on job quality meas-
ures at wave 2 (n ¼ 1032). Among eligible participants at
wave 1 (n ¼ 1081), we further excluded those with missing
data on outcome variables at wave 2. Thus, the final ana-
lytical samples comprised 244 adults for blood-based bio-
markers as outcomes, 343 adults for other biomarkers
Key Messages
• Any job is not necessarily better than no job in relation to allostatic load biomarkers, because job quality is important.
• Job quality cannot be disregarded in the employment success of the unemployed.
• Just as ‘good work is good for health’, we must also remember poor quality work can be detrimental for health.

 such as blood pressure and anthropometry and 837 adults
for self-reported health.
Outcomes
We used the concept of allostatic load to measure chronic
stress-related biomarkers.33 Detailed information on each
biomarker and its application can be found in Table 1.
The allostatic load index has previously been used to
measure health-related effects of work stress.20 This index
was originally based on data from 10 physiological or phys-
ical measurements across the cardiovascular, metabolic and
immune systems.34 We used 12 biomarkers measured in the
UKHLS [insulin growth factor 1, creatinine clearance rate
and
dehydroepiandrosterone
sulphate
(DHEA-S)
with
lower values indicating higher risk; Clauss fibrinogen, C-re-
active protein, ratio of total to HDL cholesterol, triglycer-
ides, HbA1c, pulse, systolic and diastolic blood pressures,
and waist-to-height ratio; with higher values indicating
higher risk] to construct the index. Highest (sex-specific)
quartiles of Clauss fibrinogen, C-creative protein, ratio of
total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c,
systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and waist-to-height
ratio were coded as 1 and the remaining quartiles as 0. The
lowest quartiles of insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1), creatin-
ine clearance rate and DHEA-S were coded as 1 and the re-
maining as 0. The allostatic load index was a summary of
the 12 grouped biomarkers. Eight of the 12 biomarkers
were blood based, and four non-blood based biomarkers
were additionally collected during the nurse health assess-
ment: pulse, blood pressures and waist-to-height ratio.
Pulse and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were meas-
ured using the Omoron Hem 907 electronic sphygmoman-
ometer. In addition, we used waist-to-height ratio (WHR)
as a replacement for waist-to-hip ratio to measure body fat
distribution.35,36 Log-transformation was used to reduce
skewness for the non-normally distributed biomarkers.
Two self-reported health outcomes were examined, the
Short-Form Physical and Mental Health Composite Scale
scores (SF-12 PCS and SF-12 MCS) which measure physical
and mental health functioning, respectively, with scores
ranging from 0 (low functioning) to 100 (high functioning).
In addition to the health and biomarkers as dependent vari-
ables, we analysed the association of job transition with
monthly total household net income (log transformed).
Job quality
Levels of job quality were derived based on three dimen-
sions of job quality-earnings quality, labour market secur-
ity and quality of the working environment.24
i. Job satisfaction was measured on a 7-point Likert-
scale (where 1 ¼ completely dissatisfied and 7 ¼ com-
pletely satisfied), with 4 as the cut-off to define low job
satisfaction.
ii. Job anxiety was derived as the mean of six questions
on job-related well-being, e.g. how much of the time in
the past week one felt tense/uneasy/worried/depressed/
gloomy/miserable about a job. Each question was
scored 1 (never), 2 (occasionally), 3 (some of the time),
4 (most of the time) and 5 (all of the time). A cut-off of
2 or higher reflects some job anxiety.
iii. Job autonomy was derived from the mean of five ques-
tions on how much influence a participant has over
tasks, workplace, work manner, task order and work-
ing hours in his/her current job. Each question was
measured on a 4-point scale from 1 (a lot), 2 (some), 3
(a little) to 4 (none). A cut-off of 2 or higher represents
a low-autonomy job.
iv. Job insecurity was measured by a question on ‘how
likely you think it is that you will lose your job during
the next 12 months’. The four response categories
were grouped into: low job security (very likely or
likely) and high job security (unlikely or very unlikely).

 v. Low job pay was defined as being in the lowest quartile
of hourly pay, which was calculated from a person’s
usual gross pay per month and number of hours per
week.
An overall job quality variable was created by cross-
classifying job transition with the five job quality variables.
We derived four groups: remained unemployed; employed in
a good quality job (with no adverse job quality measure); em-
ployed in a job with only one adverse job quality meas-
ure; and employed with at least two adverse job quality
measures.
Covariates
We included baseline (wave 1) sociodemographic, socioe-
conomic characteristics and health as covariates in the
regression analyses. These included age (categorized as:
30–39 years; 40–49 years; and 50–75 years), gender (male
and female), ethnicity (White British and non-White),
number of children within the household, household size,
log household net income, year since last employed (before
the start of the ‘Great Recession’ in 2008, 2008 and 2009–
10), highest academic qualification (degree level or higher,
A level and GCSE qualifications, and other and no qualifi-
cation), housing tenure (owned house, council rented
house and private rented), marital status (married, single,
other, separated and divorced or widowed), body mass
index (BMI), self-reported cardiovascular disease (CVD) or
diabetes, SF-12 PCS/SF-12 MCS (at wave 1), self-reported
long-term

 number of prescribed medicines taken (categorized as 0, 1–
2, and 3 medications or more).
Analysis
As allostatic load is a count of biomarker risk indicators,
negative binomial regression models were used to estimate
the association with job quality after controlling for base-
line covariates. Multiple linear regression models were
used for the other dependent variables (the log transformed
biomarkers, SF-12 PCS/MCS and log household net in-
come) Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine
which risk factors at wave 1 predicted job adversity at
wave 2. Three different weights were employed, depending
on the dependent variables to adjust for unequal selection
probabilities and cross-sectional and longitudinal non-re-
sponse.31 Longitudinal blood sample weights were used
for
the
blood-based
biomarkers
and
allostatic
load.
Longitudinal nurse visit weights were used for pulse, blood
pressure and waist-height ratio. Longitudinal adult inter-
view weights were used for two self-reported health out-
comes and household net income. All statistics were
calculated using the svy commands in Stata version 13 (37)
which takes account of sample selection, non-response bias
and the complex survey design for point estimates and
variance estimation. Missing outcome data, particularly
the biomarker data at wave 2 which were only collected
for a UKHLS subsample, were replaced with the equivalent
data at wave 3 where available.
Results
Table 2 displays the distribution of all the covariates and
health outcomes by job adversity (at wave 2) for the cohort
members (who were all unemployed at wave 1). The
weighted mean (for continuous covariates) and percentages
(for categorical covariates) by levels of job adversity are
shown. Older adults (aged 50–75) were most likely to re-
main unemployed (51% of those who remained un-
employed were aged 50–75) and least likely to transition
into a good quality job (only 6% of those who transitioned
into good quality jobs were aged 50–75). Women, adults
with degree or higher qualifications and those living in
their own homes were least likely to remain unemployed.
Adults with baseline health conditions (CVD/diabetes,
more prescribed medications, or long-term illness/impair-
ment), higher BMI or lower SF-12 physical or mental
health, and who were last employed before 2008, were
most likely to remain unemployed.
Looking at the allostatic load biomarkers, there was a
clear pattern of the highest levels for adults who transi-
tioned into poor quality work, with the exception of the
measures where higher levels indicated better functioning
(creatinine clearance rate, IGF-1 and DHEA-S). Adults
who transitioned into good quality jobs had the lowest lev-
els of biomarkers, with the exception of the creatinine
clearance rate, IGF-1 and DHEA-S, where their levels were
the
highest.
Respondents
who remained
unemployed
tended to have the poorest (lowest) SF-12 physical and
mental scores of at wave 3.
Table 3 reports the results of the regression models pre-
dicting the wave 3 allostatic load biomarkers and SF-12
physical and mental health scores, with job adversity as the
main explanatory variable. The full models with all the
covariates are shown in Supplementary Tables 1–3, avail-
able as Supplementary data at IJE online. Compared with
cohort members who remained unemployed at wave 2,
those who transitioned into poor quality work (with at
least two adverse job quality measures) had higher levels of
overall allostatic load (0.51, 0.32–0.71), log HbA1c (0.06,
<0.001–0.12), log triglycerides (0.39, 0.22–0.56), log CRP
(0.45, 0.16–0.75), log fibrinogen (0.09, 0.01–0.17) and
total cholesterol to HDL ratio (1.38, 0.88–1.88). The cre-
atinine clearance rate was lowest among those in poor
quality work. Respondents who transitioned into good
quality work tended to have lower levels of allostatic load
biomarkers, with the exception of those biomarkers where
higher levels indicate better functioning: DHEA-S and the
creatinine clearance rate. The predicted levels of allostatic
load (from Table 3) by job transition are shown in Figure
2; those who transitioned into poor quality work had levels
of allostatic load that were over 1.5 times higher compared
with those who remained unemployed. We also examined
the association between allostatic load and each job qual-
ity
dimension
(Supplementary
Table
4,
available
as
Supplementary data at IJE online). Respondents who tran-
sitioned into poor quality work, as measured by low pay,
low job satisfaction, low job control and high job anxiety,
had higher levels of allostatic load compared with their
peers who remained unemployed.
Looking at the SF-12 physical and mental health scores
as the outcomes, transitioning into any type of job was not
associated with an improvement in physical health. Good
quality work was associated with an improvement in men-
tal health scores compared with remaining unemployed,
but there were no differences in SF-12 mental health scores
between those who transitioned into poor quality work
and those who remained unemployed. Remaining un-
employed was associated with lower total net household
income compared with those who transitioned into any
job.

models predicting job adversity levels at wave 2 from the

and more likely to remain unemployed when compared
with those who transitioned into any job. Gender differ-

were
small.
Respondents with other/no qualifications were least likely
to transition into good quality jobs. Similarly, those living
in council rented homes were least likely to transition into
good quality jobs. Marital status did not predict job qual-
ity transitions, and neither did BMI, having CVD/diabetes,
GHQ distress, ethnicity, household net income, number of
children in the household or household size. Those with
better physical health (higher SF-12 PCS) were more likely
to transition into either good or poor quality jobs, whereas
those with a long-standing illness/impairment were un-
likely to transition into any job and most likely to remain
unemployed when compared with those without any ill-
ness/impairments. Those who had been unemployed the
longest (since before the ‘Great Recession’ in 2008) were
also the most likely to remain unemployed.
In summary, we found evidence that, compared with
adults who remained unemployed, formerly unemployed
adults who transitioned into poor quality jobs had elevated
risks for a range of allostatic load biomarkers and the allo-
static load index. In addition, we found little evidence of
negative health selection into poor quality jobs. In con-
trast, physically healthier respondents without any disabil-
ities at wave 1 were more likely to transition into good and
poor quality jobs when compared with those who re-
mained unemployed.
Discussion
We found little evidence that re-employment into poor
quality jobs was associated with better health and lower ad-
verse levels of biomarkers related to chronic stress, com-
pared with remaining unemployed. Instead, the evidence
suggested that re-employment into poor quality jobs was
associated with higher levels of chronic stress-related
biomarkers
compared
with
remaining
unemployed.
Furthermore, there was no evidence of negative health se-
lection into poor quality work. Transitioning into good or
poor quality jobs was associated with better physical health
than remaining unemployed. Health-related selection is un-
likely to explain why those who transition into poor quality
jobs had higherer adverse levels of biomarkers related to
chronic stress than those who remained unemployed.
The association between job quality and health and bio-
markers related to stress has been found in a number of
previous studies.19,21,23,38 What is new is the finding that
poor job quality is associated with more adverse levels of
biomarkers than remaining unemployed. This result is con-
trary to the belief that any job is good for health,16,39 and
evidence that job loss during recessions is associated with
increases in suicides.40 However, this apparent paradox

 may be partly explained by the differences in self-reported
health measures and biomarkers. Those who transitioned
into poor quality work had similar levels of mental health
to those who remained unemployed, but the former had
more adverse levels of biomarkers. Biomarkers are a meas-
ure of subclinical disease, potentially identifying those
early in the pathological process towards overt clinical lev-
els of disease and ill health.41 As most people are not aware
of their biomarker levels unless these manifest in clinical
symptoms or they regularly get health checks, there can be
a disjunction between their self-perceptions of health and
their subclinical biomarkers. If poor quality work results in
more adverse levels of biomarkers, then those exposed to
poor quality work may be on the pathway to manifesting
metabolic- and cardiovascular-related diseases, at which
point they may start reporting their health status as poor.
These biological pathways are different from the pathways
to suicide and violent deaths associated with unemploy-
ment during recessions.
As this is an observational study, we cannot make any
causal claims. We have tried to show that health-related se-
lection is unlikely to explain the pattern of results, but
there may be other confounding factors related to unob-
served heterogeneity in the job quality groups, which we
have not taken into account. UKHLS did not measure any
biomarkers at baseline (wave 1), so we were unable to look
at

 The analytical sample sizes were quite small, especially for
the biomarkers, although the recommended longitudinal
survey weights were used in the analyses to compensate for
missing biomarker data and other non-response biases.
The allostatic load index in this study was constructed
based on 12 available biomarkers from the UKHLS, and
we lacked some key primary mediators of allostatic load.20
Despite these limitations, the study has a number of
strengths. Job quality was measured using five dimensions
of job quality,24 unlike most studies that only measure job
satisfaction. Following up a cohort of formerly employed
adults who were looking for work meant that the baseline
samples were relatively homogeneous to start with. In add-
ition, we controlled for baseline health and sociodemo-
graphic states in the analyses. The biomarkers used in the
study, objective measures of health, were not affected by
the method bias problem common in previous studies of
job satisfaction and well-being.11,16,17,19
Despite the widespread belief that any employment,
even poor quality work, is associated with better health

 and well-being than remaining unemployed, there is little
evidence on whether becoming re-employed in poor qual-
ity work is better for health than remaining unemployed.
The study finds some evidence that formerly unemployed
adults who transitioned into poor quality work had high-
erer adverse levels of biomarkers compared with their
peers who remained unemployed. The selection of the
healthier unemployed adults into poor quality or stressful
jobs was unlikely to explain their elevated levels of chronic
stress-related biomarkers. Job quality cannot be disre-
garded in the employment success of the unemployed, and
may have important implications for their health and well-
being.
