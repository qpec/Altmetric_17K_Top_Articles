BACKGROUND: Long-term efficacy of opioids for non-
cancer pain is unproven, but risks argue for cautious
prescribing. Few data suggest how long or how much
opioid can be prescribed for opioid-naïve patients without
inadvertently promoting long-term use.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between initial
opioid prescribing patterns and likelihood of long-term
use among opioid-naïve patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study; data from Oregon
resident prescriptions linked to death certificates and
hospital discharges.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients filling opioid prescriptions be-
tween October 1, 2012, and September 30, 2013, with no
opioid fills for the previous 365 days. Subgroup analyses
examined patients under age 45 who did not die in the
follow-up year, excluding most cancer or palliative care
patients.
MAIN MEASURES: Exposure: Numbers of prescription
fills and cumulative morphine milligram equivalents
(MMEs) dispensed during 30 days following opioid initia-
tion (Binitiation month^). Outcome: Proportion of patients
with six or more opioid fills during the subsequent year
(Blong-term users^).
KEY RESULTS: There were 536,767 opioid-naïve pa-
tients who filled an opioid prescription. Of these, 26,785
(5.0 %) became long-term users. Numbers of fills and
cumulative MMEs during the initiation month were asso-
ciated with long-term use. Among patients under age 45
using short-acting opioids who did not die in the follow-up
year, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for long-term use
among those receiving two fills versus one was 2.25
(95 % CI: 2.17, 2.33). Compared to those who received <
120 total MMEs, those who received between 400 and 799
had an OR of 2.96 (95 % CI: 2.81, 3.11). Patients initiating
with long-acting opioids had a higher risk of long-term use
than those initiating with short-acting drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: Early opioid prescribing patterns are as-
sociated with long-term use. While patient characteristics
are important, clinicians have greater control over initial
prescribing. Our findings may help minimize the risk of
inadvertently initiating long-term opioid use.

BACKGROUND
Opioid prescribing has increased substantially over the past two
decades in the United States, accompanied by substantial in-
creases in overdoses and addiction treatment.1,2 These trends have
prompted calls for more selective opioid use, with lower doses
and fewer days’ supply when prescribing.3 Clinicians often won-
der how long and how high a dose of opioids can be prescribed
before inadvertently promoting long-term use, yet there are few
data to guide initial prescribing for opioid-naïve patients.
Though short-term opioid use is more common than long-
term use, the largest volume of opioids is prescribed for the
smaller number of patients receiving long-term therapy.4 For
non-cancer conditions, long-term use is problematic because of
substantial rates of dependence and misuse, and because effi-
cacy of long-term therapy remains unproven.5–8 Emergence of
drug tolerance and hyperalgesia may limit long-term efficacy.9
Several factors may explain the emergence of inadvertent long-
term use, including opioid dependence, non-medical use, sub-
stance use disorders, and diversion to other users.
Opioid prescribing patterns over a year’s time are associated
with opioid use disorders, with opioid duration more important
than daily dose.10 Dose-related risks of overdose are well docu-
mented.11–13 Less attention has focused on characteristics of
initial and early opioid prescriptions, and their association with
long-term use.
Like most states, Oregon has experienced increasing rates of
prescription opioid overdose since 2000; a national survey

 suggested that its rate of non-medical opioid use is the highest in
the nation.14 Also like other states, Oregon has implemented a
prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) to identify out-
patient prescriptions for controlled substances.15. We used
Oregon’s PDMP to study the relationship between initial opioid
prescriptions to opioid-naïve patients and the likelihood of sub-
sequent long-term opioid use. We hypothesized that (1) the
numbers of prescription fills or morphine equivalents dispensed
within the first 30 days would be associated with long-term use;
(2) the use of long-acting opioids for the initial prescription would
be associated with a greater likelihood of long-term use than
initial prescription for short-acting opioids; and (3) associations
would persist after excluding patients for whom clinicians were
most likely to intend long-term opioid use (those with cancer or
near the end of life).
METHODS
Activities were approved by two institutional review boards:
Oregon Health & Science University and the Public Health
Division of the Oregon Health Authority, where the PDMP is
housed.
Sources and Preparation of Data. Data were obtained from the
Oregon PDMP, Oregon vital records, and a statewide hospital
discharge registry. Like most PDMPs, Oregon’s is maintained by
a commercial vendor. It began collecting pharmacy data in
June 2011, which became available to clinicians in September
2011. By December 2011, 90 % of pharmacies were uploading
data, and this had increased to 99 % by December 2013.16 The
study time frame (opioid initiation between October 1, 2012, and
September 30, 2013) was selected to identify opioid initiators
with a full year of PDMP records before and after the initial
prescription. The system collects data from all outpatient retail
pharmacies, but excludes state and federal institutions and
inpatient prescribing. There were no changes in the types of
institutions reporting during the study period.
Because of the data’s sensitive nature, the Public Health
Division prepared de-identified data, such that investigators
could not identify patients, prescribers, or pharmacies. Exact
age was removed, and gender, race, ethnicity, and payment
source were not collected by the PDMP during study years.
Before removing identifying information, a Public Health
analyst linked multiple prescriptions for the same patient using
probabilistic techniques.17,18 The PDMP vendor uses a pro-
prietary, largely deterministic algorithm to link prescriptions
for the same individual, based on name, birth date, and ad-
dress. However, an individual may not always be uniquely
identified, due to nicknames, misspellings, transposed digits
or characters, changes in surname, or changes in residence.
The analyst therefore used The Link King v7.1.21 link-
age and de-duplication software to probabilistically match
individuals within and between datasets using name, birth
date, and ZIP Code.17 The software creates six ordinal
Blinkage certainty levels^, each less certain of a true
match. It allows users to review a random sample of
potentially linked record pairs within each level. Potential-
ly matched records in certainty levels with less than 95 %
positive predictive value were manually reviewed. PDMP
data were linked with vital records and hospital discharges
using the same probabilistic methods. Further preparation
of the dataset excluded prescriptions from non-Oregon
prescribers and erroneous entries, such as transfers of
drugs between pharmacies (Fig. 1).
Drug Characteristics. We identified opioid medications,
including analgesics, antitussives, and migraine medications,
using Food and Drug Administration National Drug Codes to
identify pharmaceutical class, rather than therapeutic class.19
The only exceptions were tramadol (not included in PDMP
during study years) and buprenorphine–naloxone
combinations.
We calculated Bmorphine milligram equivalents^ (MME)
for each prescription fill using Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) Conversion Reference Tables.20 If conversion factors
were unavailable, a clinical pharmacist (NO) used information
in the drug name or drugs with the same generic name and
route to assign a conversion factor. Where data were missing
regarding long- or short-acting properties, assignments were
based on drugs with equivalent features.21
Inclusion of Patients and Prescriptions and Dosing
Calculations. We initially included all patients who filled an
opioid prescription in the study year. The first prescription
filled during this interval was the index prescription. We then
examined the 365-day period before the index prescription, to
exclude patients who filled an opioid prescription or were
hospitalized for opioid-related diagnoses during that period
(Fig. 1). Patients receiving cumulative opioid doses ≥ 4000
MMEs in the initiation month (defined below) were also
excluded, reasoning that such high doses could not have been
achieved in a short time in opioid-naïve patients without
substantial risk of respiratory depression. Remaining patients
were labeled Bopioid-naïve^.
Oregon’s PDMP does not include patient diagnoses or clini-
cian specialty. Our initial analysis therefore included all patients
with an eligible prescription fill. In some cases, opioid therapy
may have been initiated with the intention of long-term use, as
for patients with cancer pain or palliative care near the end of
life. To exclude these, we examined the subset of patients under
age 45 who did not die within 1 year of the index prescription.
This excludes over 90 % of patients with invasive cancer and
the vast majority of palliative care patients.22,23 It also excludes
many patients with chronic painful conditions, such as severe
osteoarthritis. In this Bselective^ analysis, we also excluded
children aged 11 and under, as these are at low risk of long-
term drug use and account for many antitussive prescriptions.
Finally, we excluded patients with any address outside Oregon
22

JGIM
 listed in the PDMP, reasoning these would be more likely to
have had prescriptions filled outside Oregon. This could lead to
erroneous labeling as opioid-naïve or underestimating opioid
use after the initial prescription.
For included patients, we identified opioid fills during the
30 days following index prescription. This interval was labeled
the Binitiation month^. During the study years, Oregon’s PDMP
did not record days’ supply of medication—only number and
strength of pills (or other dosing units) dispensed. Because
Bprn^ prescriptions are common, daily dose and intended dura-
tion are often ambiguous in any case. We therefore summarized
Bdose^ of opioids by summing MMEs for all preparations
dispensed to an individual during the initiation month. Dosing
categories were chosen to correspond to 40 MME/day for
3 days, 7 days, or more, reflecting new CDC guidelines indi-
cating that for acute pain, 3 days of opioid therapy is Boften
sufficient^ and Bmore than 7 days will rarely be needed.^24
Definition of Long-Term Opioid Use. We examined opioid
prescription fills in the 1-year interval following the initiation
month. As in an earlier study, patients with at least six fills during
this period were considered to have initiated long-term opioid
use.25 To test the clinical relevance of this definition, we exam-
ined risk of hospitalization for opioid-related adverse events
(codes in the appendix available online) among those who did
or did not have at least six fills in the follow-up year. We did not
try to identify or define dependency, misuse, abuse, or addiction,
though these in turn are associated with long-term use.5–8,10
Analysis. Chi-square and related tests for trend were used to
compare demographic features of patients who did or did not
initiate long-term opioid use. Rural residence was defined by
ZIP Code by the Oregon Office of Rural Health. Opioid
initiators who became long-term users were tabulated by
number of prescription fills and increments of MMEs dis-
pensed in the initiation month, and tested with the Cochran–
Armitage test for trend.26,27 A similar analysis was conducted
for the Bselective^ subgroup. This analysis was further strati-
fied by initial short-acting or long-acting opioid. Another
analysis included only patients whose initial opioid prescrip-
tion was from a PDMP-registered dentist. This constituted
another subgroup whose initial prescriptions were likely
intended to be short-term. We then conducted multivariable
logistic regressions for the full cohort and relevant subsets,
adjusting for urban or rural residence and age categories.
To better understand how some patients reached higher opioid
doses, we examined numbers of prescribers, pharmacies, pre-
scription fills, and MMEs dispensed with each fill for patients
with high or low MMEs in the initiation month. Increasing
numbers of prescribers and pharmacies are associated with great-
er overdose risk.28,29 Statistical tests were two-sided, and signif-
icance was defined as p < 0.05; analyses were performed using
SAS version 9.3 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
RESULTS
Patients. During the index year, 3,657,074 eligible opioid
prescriptions were filled for 874,765 patients. There were
536,767 apparently opioid-naïve patients (61.4 % of the total)
who filled an opioid prescription. Of these, 26,785 (5.0 %)

 became long-term opioid users. Long-term use was higher among
rural than urban residents (6.1 vs. 4.4 % respectively, p < 0.001).
The odds ratio for rural residence versus urban was 1.37 (95 %
CI: 1.34, 1.41). There was a trend toward greater long-term use
with increasing age (p < 0.001 for trend, Table 1). The most
common initial prescriptions were short-acting opioids combined
with acetaminophen, including hydrocodone, oxycodone, or co-
deine (n = 458,520, 84.3 % of initial prescriptions, Table 1).
Hospitalization with opioid-related adverse events during
the year following the initiation month was rare (n = 883,
0.2 %). However, patients who became long-term opioid users
were almost seven times as likely to have such hospitalizations
as those who did not (1.18 vs. 0.17 %, p < 0.001).
Initiation Month Prescribing and Long-Term Opioid Use.
Most patients received one fill in the initiation month (n =
429,597, 80.0 %). Among these, 2.9 % became long-term
opioid users. However, 107,170 patients received two or more
fills during the initiation month, and the proportion who
became long-term opioid users increased consistently with
numbers of fills (p < 0.0001 for trend, Table 2). Among those
with two fills, 10.6 % became long-term opioid users, and
among those with ≥ 4 fills, 26.1 % became long-term users.
The trend persisted after adjusting for categorical age and
urban or rural residence (Table 2).
Similarly, the proportion of patients who became long-term
opioid users increased with increasing MMEs dispensed
(p < 0.0001 for trend, Table 2). Among those receiving under
120 MMEs during the initiation month, 2.0 % became long-
term opioid users. This proportion rose consistently with in-
creasing MMEs dispensed, to 46.2 % among patients receiv-
ing 3200–3999 MMEs in the initiation month (adjusted OR
16.07, 95 % CI: 14.07, 18.37).
The same trends were observed in our selective analysis
(Table 3). The stratum who initiated therapy with a long-acting
opioid had substantially higher probability of long-term use
(overall 24.5 % with long-acting vs. 3.5 % with short-acting,
p < 0.001). Even among those with a single fill for long-acting
opioids in the initiation month, 15.7 % became long-term users,
versus 2.0 % among those initially prescribed short-acting drugs.
After adjustment for urban or rural residence and for categorical
age, trends of increasing long-term use with increasing prescrip-
tion fills or MMEs persisted (Table 3). For example, the adjusted
odds ratio for long-term use among those having even two fills
for a short-acting opioid was 2.25 (95 % CI 2.17, 2.33).
The subgroup whose initial opioid prescription was from a
dentist followed a similar pattern for increasing numbers of
prescriptions fills (Table 4). We could not examine MMEs,
because all but four patients were in the lowest category.
Numbers of Prescriptions, Prescribers, and Pharmacies.
Among patients with the lowest cumulative opioid dose in the
initiation month, 98.8 % received a single prescription fill. In
contrast, among those with the largest cumulative dose in the
initiation month, only 18.7 % received a single fill (p < 0.001).
Of the 107,170 people who filled more than one prescription in
the initiation month, 45,789 (42.7 %) received all prescriptions
from the same prescriber. Among those with the lowest
cumulative dose in the initiation month, 99.5 % had a single
prescriber, versus 54.0 % among those with the largest
cumulative dose (p < 0.001). Among those receiving the lowest
cumulative dose in the initiation month, 99.7 % used a single
pharmacy, versus 69.0 % among those receiving the highest
cumulative dose (p < 0.001). In the highest cumulative dose
group, average MMEs dispensed decreased with each
successive prescription, from an average of 1295 with the first
prescription to 719 with a fourth prescription.

 during the initiation month were strongly related to the prob-
ability of long-term use. Long-term use was in turn associated
with a higher risk of opioid-related hospitalization. The Bdose–
response^ relationships will not surprise most clinicians, but
our data quantify their magnitude. Even one additional fill
after an initial prescription was associated with 2.25 greater
odds of long-term opioid use. Initiation of opioid therapy with
a long-acting drug was associated with greater long-term use
than initiation with a short-acting drug. Our finding that 5.0 %
of opioid initiators became long-term users is consistent with
other estimates of 5–6 %, even with different definitions.10,30
An important limitation is that we cannot say that the initial
prescribing pattern is the cause of long-term use, although
dose–response relationships bolster the argument for some

 causal role. An obvious alternative explanation is that patients
with more persistent and severe pain get more prescription fills
and higher doses. Furthermore, patients at higher risk of long-
term use and abuse (e.g., history of depression or substance
abuse) are more likely to receive opioid prescriptions than
patients with lower risk, despite recommendations to the con-
trary.31–34 This has been termed Badverse selection^.34 Finally,
some may have a genetic predisposition to opioid depen-
dence.35,36 Some combination of explanations for long-term
use seems likely.
Thus, it is impossible to dissociate risks attributable to more
prescriptions and higher doses from risks attributable to indi-
vidual patient characteristics. However, randomized trials to
assess risks of long-term opioid use with competing initial
regimens would pose ethical challenges, and are unlikely to be
performed. Observational data may offer the best insight into
the risks associated with initial prescribing patterns. Due to
data restrictions, we did not have rich patient-level data to
further adjust for factors (beyond urban or rural residence and
age category) that may confound observed associations. Data
on patient demographics and payment source might provide
additional insights.
Another limitation is that we cannot know whether
patients were truly opioid-naïve, though the PDMP may
offer the best assurance. Nonetheless, a patient who
recently moved from another state, already receiving
opioids, could appear opioid-naïve. This would also be
true for someone who filled prior prescriptions in a
federal facility, or obtained medication from family or
illicit sources. Some patients receiving initial high doses
may have already been receiving opioid therapy. Other
patients receiving high doses received prescriptions from
multiple clinicians, raising concerns about misuse or
diversion to illicit use. Thus, some patients with the
highest doses may not truly be opioid-naïve or using
medications as intended. Even if the higher dose cate-
gories are excluded, we have a striking dose-related
pattern of long-term opioid use.
A further limitation is that clinicians may have intended
some patients to receive long-term opioids. However, our se-
lective analysis likely removed a large percentage of patients for
whom long-term use was intended. Furthermore, for patients
with non-cancer pain, guidelines recommend a short-term trial
of medication prior to initiating long-term therapy.37,38 Thus,
we believe that for most patients in Tables 3 and 4, long-term
therapy was not the initial intent. Among patients with the
highest cumulative dose, the declining average MME dose with
each successive fill supports this inference.
Another study limitation is that we cannot know whether
patients filling prescriptions took the medication themselves.
Some patients may have diverted medications to family,
friends, or illicit channels. This seems most likely for those
receiving high cumulative doses from multiple prescribers and
multiple pharmacies.
Our analysis comparing short- versus long-acting opi-
oids suggests that initiation with a long-acting opioid is
associated with greater risk of long-term use. Others
have described an increased overdose risk when initiat-
ing therapy with long-acting opioids.39 Thus, our find-
ings add to earlier cautions regarding long-acting opi-
oids for initial therapy.
For most patients initiating opioids, the intention is
short-term use. Our data suggest that the probability of
long-term use can be minimized by initiation with a
single prescription of a short-acting opioid, with no
refills, and a cumulative dose less than 120 morphine
equivalents. An example would be a regimen of 10 mg
hydrocodone tablets prescribed four times daily for 3 or
fewer days. The increasing risk of long-term use even at
low cumulative doses supports the CDC recommenda-
tion of limiting therapy to 3–7 days for most patients.24
Considerable attention has been focused on the high-risk
attributes of patients receiving opioids, and less attention has
been given to high-risk characteristics of initial opioid pre-
scribing patterns. Our data suggest the value of attention to
high-risk prescribing, over which clinicians have greater con-
trol. This, in part, reflects the concern that we are dealing with
Brisky drugs, not risky patients.^40 Our findings may help
clinicians minimize inadvertent long-term opioid use by en-
couraging limited initial prescriptions, highlighting the impor-
tance of refills or subsequent prescriptions, and illustrating the
value of the PDMP in identifying those at high risk.
