Summary
CD4+ T cells are central mediators of autoimmune pathology; however, defining their key effector 
functions in specific autoimmune diseases remains challenging. Pathogenic CD4+ T cells within 
affected tissues may be identified by expression of markers of recent activation1. Here, we used 
mass cytometry to evaluate activated T cells in joint tissue from patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA), a chronic immune-mediated arthritis that affects up to 1% of the population2. This approach 
revealed a strikingly expanded population of PD-1hi CXCR5- CD4+ T cells in RA synovium. 
These cells are not exhausted. Rather, multidimensional cytometry, transcriptomics, and functional 
assays define a population of PD-1hi CXCR5- ‘peripheral helper’ T (Tph) cells that express factors 
enabling B cell help, including IL-21, CXCL13, ICOS, and MAF. Like PD-1hi CXCR5+ T 
follicular helper (Tfh) cells, Tph cells induce plasma cell differentiation in vitro via IL-21 and 
SLAMF5-interactions3,4. However, global transcriptomics robustly separate Tph cells from Tfh 
cells, with altered expression of Bcl6 and Blimp-1 and unique expression of chemokine receptors 
that direct migration to inflamed sites, such as CCR2, CX3CR1, and CCR5, in Tph cells. Tph cells 
appear uniquely poised to promote B cell responses and antibody production within pathologically 
inflamed non-lymphoid tissues.

We analyzed CD4+ T cells in 3 seropositive (defined as rheumatoid factor+ or anti-
citrullinated peptide antibody+) RA synovial tissue samples with dense leukocyte infiltrates 
using a mass cytometry panel designed to interrogate both stromal and leukocyte 
populations (Extended Data Table 1). Two-dimensional visualization of the 
multidimensional cytometry data using the viSNE algorithm5 revealed a heterogeneous 
CD4+ T cell population with distinct expression patterns of 5 activation markers (PD-1, 
MHC II, ICOS, CD69, CD38) (Fig. 1a). Strikingly, a large population of cells with high 
PD-1 expression clustered together in each of the 3 samples (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 
1a). Biaxial gating of data from 6 seropositive RA synovial tissue samples confirmed high 
expression of PD-1 on ∼25% of synovial CD4+ T cells, the majority of which co-expressed 
MHC II and/or ICOS (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1b, Extended Data Table 2).

 In a complementary approach, 11-dimensional flow cytometric analysis of memory CD4+ T 
cells from paired synovial fluid and blood samples from 3 seropositive RA patients also 
revealed a large population of synovial PD-1hi CD4+ T cells, a subset of which co-expressed 
MHC II and/or ICOS (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Approximately 30% of synovial fluid CD4+ 
T cells displayed high PD-1 expression, mirroring results from synovial tissue (Fig. 1c, 
Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). The frequency of PD-1hi CD4+ T cell populations was over 5-fold 
higher in seropositive RA synovial fluid (n=9) compared to synovial fluid from 19 patients 
with seronegative inflammatory arthritides (seronegative RA n=2, spondyloarthropathy n=8, 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis n=9) (Fig. 1c).
The dramatic expansion of PD-1hi cells specifically in seropositive RA, a disease 
characterized by autoantibody production and frequent synovial T cell-B cell aggregates6,7, 
led us to considered whether synovial PD-1hi cells might be Tfh cells. Tfh cells, often 
identified as CXCR5+ PD-1+, are uniquely adapted to promote B cell recruitment and 
differentiation in lymph node follicles via production of IL-21, IL-4, CD40L, and CXCL13, 
the ligand for CXCR53. However, seropositive RA synovial tissue samples contained few 
PD-1hi CXCR5+ Tfh cells (Fig. 1d), which clustered separately from PD-1hi CXCR5- cells 
in viSNE analyses (Fig. 1a). In contrast, ∼85% of PD-1hi CD4+ cells in synovial tissue 
lacked CXCR5, as did almost all PD-1hi CD4+ cells in synovial fluid (Fig. 1d). 
Measurement of CXCR5 transcript levels in sorted PD-1hi CXCR5- and PD-1hi CXCR5+ 
cells from synovial tissue, synovial fluid, and blood confirmed that PD-1hi CXCR5- cells 
from all 3 sources contained little, if any, CXCR5 mRNA (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Thus, 
seropositive RA synovium contains abundant PD-1hi CD4+ T cells that are distinct from Tfh 
cells.
Intriguingly, PD-1hi CXCR5- CD4+ T cells with a similar multidimensional phenotype, 
including increased MHC II and ICOS expression, also appeared in the circulation, albeit at 
much lower frequencies (Extended Data Fig. 1c,e, Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). Quantification 
of circulating PD-1hi CXCR5- memory CD4+ T cells in patients with established 
seropositive RA, seronegative RA, spondyloarthropathy, and non-inflammatory controls 
demonstrated a significantly increased frequency of PD-1hi CXCR5- cells specifically in 
seropositive RA patients (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Table 2). PD-1hi CXCR5- MHC II+ and 
PD-1hi CXCR5- ICOS+ cells were also increased in blood of seropositive RA patients 
(Extended Data Fig. 2c). In contrast, the frequencies of PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells and cells with 
intermediate PD-1 expression were not increased (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e).
PD-1hi CXCR5- cell frequencies were more robustly increased in seropositive RA patients 
with moderate or high disease activity (clinical disease activity index (CDAI)>10) (Fig. 1f). 
The frequency of PD-1hi CXCR5- cells did not vary with other clinical parameters such as 
age, sex, disease duration, use of methotrexate or biologic therapies, or serum anti-CCP 
antibody titer (Extended Data Fig. 2f-h). In an independent cohort of 23 seropositive RA 
patients assayed before and after starting a new RA medication, there was a significant 
correlation between reduction in disease activity and reduction in the frequency of PD-1hi 
CXCR5- T cells (Extended Data Fig. 2i). The frequency of PD-1hi CXCR5- cells, PD-1hi 
MHC II+ CXCR5- and PD-1hi ICOS+ CXCR5- cells decreased significantly in the 18

 patients whose disease activity decreased after treatment escalation (Fig. 1g, Extended Data 
Fig. 2j).
Since high PD-1 expression is often considered indicative of an exhausted state8,9, we 
assessed the function of synovial PD-1hi CXCR5- cells. Surprisingly, despite lack of 
CXCR5, PD-1hi CD4+ T cells sorted from seropositive RA synovial fluid showed >100-fold 
increased mRNA expression of IL-21 and >1000-fold increased expression of CXCL13, as 
well as higher levels of IFN-γ and IL-10, compared to PD-1- T cells, with the highest 
expression in PD-1hi MHC II+ cells (Fig. 2a, sorted as in Extended Data Fig. 1e). In contrast, 
IL-2 showed a trend towards lower expression in PD-1hi cells.
Consistent with mRNA expression, PD-1hi CXCR5- cells sorted from RA synovial fluid 
more frequently produced IL-21 (∼30%), but less frequently produced IL-2, compared to 
PD-1- or PD-1int cells, after stimulation with PMA+ionomycin (Fig. 2b). Optimal CXCL13 
production was detected after 24 hours of stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 beads. 
Strikingly, at this timepoint, ∼25% of PD-1hi CXCR5- cells produced CXCL13, but not 
IL-2, compared to <1% of PD-1- or PD-1int cells (Fig. 2b). High IL-21 and CXCL13 
production by synovial fluid PD-1hi CXCR5- CD4+ T cells indicates that these cells are not 
globally exhausted, and instead suggested possible B cell-helper function.
PD-1hi MHC II+ cells in seropositive RA synovial fluid also expressed high mRNA levels of 
the transcription factors MAF and BATF and the signaling adaptor SAP (encoded by 
SH2D1A), 3 factors important for Tfh cell development or function (Extended Data Fig. 
3a)3. However, Bcl6, a transcription factor characteristically expressed in Tfh cells, was not 
elevated in synovial fluid PD-1hi cells, while Blimp-1, a transcription factor typically 
downregulated in Tfh cells, was upregulated (Extended Data Fig. 3a)3,10.
Intracellular flow cytometry confirmed that Blimp-1 was significantly elevated in PD-1hi 
CXCR5- cells, but not PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells, from seropositive RA synovial samples (Fig. 
2c,d). In contrast, Bcl6 was dramatically elevated in PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells, such that the 
Bcl6/Blimp-1 ratio was uniquely elevated in synovial PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells. Expression of 
MAF, a factor that promotes IL-21 production in human CD4+ T cells11, was elevated in 
both PD-1hi CXCR5- and PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells.
PD-1hi memory CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood showed a transcriptional pattern similar 
to that in synovial fluid PD-1hi cells, with increased expression of IL-21, CXCL13, IFN-γ, 
MAF, SAP, and Blimp-1, but not IL-2 or Bcl6, in circulating PD-1hi MHC II+ cells 
compared to PD-1- cells (Extended Data Fig. 3b,c). Both PD-1hi CXCR5- and PD-1hi 
CXCR5+ cells expressed increased IL-21 and CXCL13 and decreased IL-2 compared to 
PD-1- T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3c). However, Blimp-1 expression was ∼3-fold higher in 
blood PD-1hi CXCR5-cells compared to PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells. Consistently, after in vitro 
stimulation, blood PD-1hi CXCR5- cells expressed more Blimp-1 and less Bcl6 protein than 
did PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 3d). Taken together, these results indicate that 
both synovial and blood PD-1hi CXCR5- cells express factors associated with B cell-helper 
function without an elevated Bcl6/Blimp-1 expression ratio.

 To compare PD-1hi CXCR5- and PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells more broadly, we analyzed PD-1hi 
cells from blood by mass cytometry (Extended Data Table 1). viSNE visualization of 
memory CD4+ T cells clustered PD-1hi CXCR5- and PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells in close 
proximity, indicating a similar multidimensional phenotype (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 4a). 
In contrast, FoxP3+ T regulatory cells aggregated in a separate region, indicating that most 
PD-1hi cells are not T regulatory cells, a finding confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3a, 
Extended Data Fig. 4b).
Both PD-1hi CXCR5- cells and PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells showed significantly increased 
expression of 11 proteins, including TIGIT, ICOS, CD38, and CD57, and significantly 
decreased expression of 5 proteins, including CD25 and CD127, compared to PD-1- 
CXCR5- cells (Fig. 3b). Unlike TIGIT, the inhibitory receptors TIM-3, LAG-3, and CTLA-4 
did not appear enriched on PD-1hi CXCR5- cells (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Compared to 
PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells, PD-1hi CXCR5-cells showed lower expression of CCR7 and CD27 
but higher CD44 and T-bet (Fig. 3b,c), suggesting a potentially distinct migratory 
capacity12,13.
We next performed an unbiased global transcriptomic comparison of blood PD-1hi CXCR5- 
and PD-1hi CXCR5+ cell subpopulations by RNA-seq. Principal components analysis 
separated PD-1hi populations that co-expressed ICOS and/or MHC II from PD-1- cells along 
the first principal component (PC), irrespective of CXCR5 expression (Fig. 3d, Extended 
Data Fig. 4d). However, PD-1hi CXCR5- and PD-1hi CXCR5+ cell populations were largely 
distinguished by PC2, indicating considerable differences in the global transcriptomes of 
PD-1hi CXCR5- cells and PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells beyond CXCR5 expression alone.
Sixty-six genes were differentially expressed when comparing all of the PD-1hi populations 
to the PD-1- populations (log fold change >1.2, FDR<0.01, Extended Data Table 3), 
including a set of genes previously reported to be elevated in Tfh cells, such as MAF, TIGIT, 
and SLAMF614,15. Analysis of a curated list of Tfh-associated genes14,16,17 demonstrated 
similar upregulation of multiple genes in the pooled PD-1hi CXCR5+ cell samples and 
PD-1hi CXCR5- cell samples (Fig. 3e). When all 8 subpopulations were analyzed without 
pooling, hierarchical clustering based on these genes perfectly segregated PD-1hi 
populations from PD-1- populations, regardless of CXCR5 expression (p<0.026, Extended 
Data Fig. 4e). These results highlight a shared transcriptional program associated with B 
cell-helper function in PD-1hi CXCR5- cells and Tfh cells.
However, we also identified 16 genes with significantly different expression between PD-1hi 
CXCR5- and PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells (Extended Data Table 4). Notably, PD-1hi CXCR5- cells 
showed 34-fold increased expression of CCR2, a chemokine receptor that mediates 
migration to sites of peripheral inflammation18. A targeted analysis of chemokine receptor 
expression on PD-1hi CXCR5- cells demonstrated striking upregulation of a set of 
‘inflammatory’ chemokine receptors on these cells, including CCR2, CX3CR1, and CCR5, 
which was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3f,g, Extended Data Fig. 4f)19. Notably, 
∼50% of PD-1hi CXCR5- cells in seropositive RA synovial tissue and synovial fluid 
expressed CCR2 (Fig. 3g). These results indicate that PD-1hi CXCR5- cells can be

 distinguished from PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells not only by the lack of CXCR5 but also by high 
expression of inflammatory chemokine receptors.
To investigate the interconversion of PD-1hi cells that express distinct chemokine receptors, 
PD-1hi CXCR5- CCR2-, PD-1hi CXCR5- CCR2+, and PD-1hi CXCR5+ CCR2- cell 
populations sorted from blood were stimulated in vitro and re-evaluated at different 
timepoints (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). After 7 days, the majority of PD-1hi cells that started 
out CXCR5- CCR2+ cells remained CCR2+, while less than 5% of these cells acquired 
CXCR5 (Extended Data Fig. 5c,d). Conversely, most PD-1hi cells that started out CXCR5+ 
CCR2- remained CXCR5+, and less than 5% of these cells acquired CCR2. These results 
suggest that CXCR5 and CCR2 expression remain persistent, distinguishing features on 
PD-1hi CD4+ T cells in vitro.
We next tested directly if PD-1hi CXCR5- CD4+ T cells can provide B cell help in vitro. 
PD-1hi CXCR5- cells sorted from seropositive RA synovial tissue or synovial fluid induced 
differentiation of co-cultured memory B cells into plasma cells, while CXCR5- cells without 
high PD-1 expression did not (Fig. 4a). The limited number of CXCR5+ T cells in synovial 
samples precluded comparison with PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells. PD-1hi CXCR5- cells from blood 
also induced memory B cell differentiation into plasma cells, with comparable activity in 
PD-1hi CXCR5-CCR2-, PD-1hi CXCR5- CCR2+, and PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells (Fig. 4a,b). 
PD-1hi CXCR5- cells from synovial fluid and blood also enhanced IgG production in the co-
cultures (Fig. 4c). Neutralization of IL-21 inhibited plasma cell differentiation induced by 
both blood PD-1hi CXCR5- cells and PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells by ∼90% (Fig. 4d). Expression 
of SLAMF5, a factor important for T-B interactions,4 was elevated on both PD-1hi CXCR5- 
and PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells, and antibody blockade of SLAMF5, but not SLAMF6, 
completely abrogated plasma cell differentiation and IgG production (Fig. 4e, Extended 
Data Fig. 6a-c). Consistent with a link in vivo, RA treatment escalation reduced the 
frequency of circulating plasmablasts in parallel with the reduction in PD-1hi CXCR5- T 
cells (Fig. 1g).
Finally, immunofluorescence microscopy identified CD3+ T cells with bright PD-1 
expression in all 4 seropositive RA synovial samples analyzed (Fig. 4f). CXCR5 was 
observed on CD20+ B cells and on a minority of PD-1hi T cells that were enriched within 
lymphoid aggregates (Fig. 4g,h). However, PD-1hi CXCR5- cells outnumbered PD-1hi 
CXCR5+ cells within lymphoid aggregates, and were ∼4-fold more abundant than PD-1hi 
CXCR5+ cells in regions outside of lymphoid aggregates (Fig. 4h). Within lymphoid 
aggregates, both PD-1hi CXCR5- cells and PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells were found adjacent to B 
cells (Fig. 4g,i). However, in areas outside of lymphoid aggregates, the majority of PD-1hi 
cells adjacent to B cells were CXCR5- (Fig. 4i, Extended Data Fig. 6d). These results 
suggest a unique capacity of PD-1hi CXCR5- T cells to interact with B cells both within 
lymphoid aggregates and more diffusely throughout the inflamed synovium.
Here, we have defined a PD-1hi CXCR5- CD4+ T ‘peripheral helper’ (Tph) cell population 
markedly expanded in rheumatoid arthritis that combines B cell helper function with a 
migratory program targeting inflamed tissues. The abundance of Tph cells in RA synovium 
highlights the importance of tissue-localized T-B cell interactions20. Tph cells may infiltrate

 chronically inflamed tissues, which would not be expected to readily recruit Tfh cells, 
providing a potential mechanism for the initiation of ectopic lymphoid structures21-23. Tph 
cell production of CXCL13 and IL-21 may recruit both Tfh and B cells, promoting local 
autoantibody production that may not be reflected in serum, and perhaps modulating other B 
cell functions such as cytokine production7,24. Identification of the Tph cell phenotype 
considerably expands the spectrum of B cell-helper T cells that may be assessed as 
biomarkers for autoantibody-associated diseases. Further, high expression of PD-1 on Tph 
cells may offer a potential strategy for therapeutic targeting of tissue T cell-B cell 
interactions.
Methods
Human subjects research
Human subjects research was performed according to the Institutional Review Boards at 
Partners HealthCare, Hospital for Special Surgery, or the University of Birmingham Local 
Ethical Review Committee (Birmingham, UK) via approved protocols with appropriate 
informed consent as required. Patients with RA fulfilled the ACR 2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis 
classification criteria. Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibody status, C-reactive protein 
level, and medication usage were obtained by review of electronic medical records. Biologic 
therapy was defined as use of anti-TNF, abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, or tofacitinib. 
Synovial tissue samples for mass and flow cytometry were collected from seropositive RA 
patients undergoing arthroplasty at the Hospital for Special Surgery, New York or at 
Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston. Samples with lymphocytic infiltrates on histology 
were prioritized for analyses. Synovial tissue for microscopy was acquired by synovial 
biopsy of a clinically inflamed joint from seropositive RA patients within the Birmingham 
early arthritis cohort (BEACON) at the University of Birmingham, UK.
Synovial fluid samples were obtained as excess material from a separate cohort of patients 
undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic arthrocentesis of an inflammatory knee effusion as 
directed by the treating rheumatologist. These samples were de-identified; therefore, 
additional clinical information was not available, except for the 3 patients from whom paired 
synovial fluid and blood were obtained.
Blood samples for clinical phenotyping were obtained from patients seen at the Brigham and 
Women's Hospital Arthritis Center. For blood cell analyses in the cross-sectional cohort, 
CDAI was measured by the treating clinician on the day of sample acquisition. Anti-CCP 
titers were measured using the Immunoscan CCPLus ELISA (Eurodiagnostica), with a 
positive result defined as >25 units/mL. For RA patients followed longitudinally, a new 
treatment was initiated at the discretion of the treating physician, and CDAIs were 
determined at each visit by trained research study staff. Blood samples were acquired before 
initiation of a new biologic therapy or within 1 week of starting methotrexate. Concurrent 
prednisone at doses ≤10mg/day were permitted.
All synovial fluid and blood samples were subjected to density centrifugation using Ficoll-
Hypaque to isolate mononuclear cells, which were cryopreserved for batched analyses. Most 
phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses of blood T cells were performed on samples from

 both RA patients and non-inflammatory controls, with similar results unless specifically 
indicated. In vitro PD-1hi T cell interconversion assays and in vitro B cell helper-assays 
using blood T cells were performed using PBMC from blood bank leukoreduction collars 
from anonymous donors.
All blood CD4+ T cell analyses included only CD45RA- memory CD4+ T cells except 
where naïve (CD45RA+) cells are specifically indicated. Here the term ‘memory’ is used to 
denote an ‘antigen-experienced’ status indicated by loss of the naïve T cell marker 
CD45RA. This population includes both resting and activated antigen-experienced T cells. 
Synovial fluid and tissue analyses also utilize only memory CD4+ T cells unless total CD4+ 
T cells are indicated. Naïve T cells constituted <10% of the total population of CD4+ T cells 
in synovial tissue and synovial fluid.
Synovial tissue analysis
Synovial samples were acquired from discarded arthroplasty tissue. Synovial tissue was 
isolated by careful dissection, minced, and digested with 100μg/mL LiberaseTL and 
100μg/mL DNaseI (both Roche) in RPMI (Life Technologies) for 15 minutes, inverting 
every 5 minutes. Cells were passed through a 70μm cell strainer, washed, subjected to red 
blood cell lysis, and cryopreserved in Cryostor CS10 (BioLife Solutions) for batched 
analyses.
Mass cytometry
Cryopreserved disaggregated synovial cells or PBMCs were thawed into RPMI + 10% FBS 
(HyClone). Viability was assessed with rhodium for PBMCs and cisplatin (both Fluidigm) 
for synovial cells. Cells were then washed and stained with primary antibody cocktails at 
1:100 dilution (Extended Data Table 1). All antibodies were obtained from the Longwood 
Medical Area CyTOF Antibody Resource Core (Boston, MA). Cells were then washed, 
fixed and permeabilized using the Ebioscience Transcription Factor Fix/Perm Buffer for 45 
minutes, washed in PBS/1%BSA/0.3% saponin, then stained for intracellular markers. Cells 
were re-fixed in formalin (Sigma), washed with Milli-Q water, and analyzed on a CyTOF2 
(Fluidigm) for PBMC or Helios (Fluidigm) for synovial cells. Mass cytometry data were 
normalized using EQ™ Four Element Calibration Beads (Fluidigm) as described25.
viSNE analyses were performed on cytometry data from 3 of 6 synovial tissue samples, 3 of 
9 synovial fluid samples, and 8 of 14 blood samples using the Barnes-Hut SNE 
implementation on Cytobank (www.cytobank.org). All 3 individual synovial tissue sample 
analyses are shown. For synovial fluid and blood cell analyses, one representative patient 
sample is shown. For synovial tissue mass cytometry data, gated CD4+ T cells were 
analyzed using all available protein markers, and each synovial tissue sample was analyzed 
individually to allow for maximal resolution. For paired synovial fluid-blood flow cytometry 
data, gated memory CD4+ T cells from synovial fluid and blood were analyzed together in a 
single viSNE analysis for direct comparison using an equal number of randomly selected 
cells from each sample. For blood mass cytometry analyses, equal numbers of gated 
memory CD4+ T cells from each sample were analyzed together using all markers except 
those used for gating (CD3, CD4, CD45RO). Comparison of marker expression on PD-1hi

 CXCR5- and PD-1hi CXCR5+ cells was performed with R-3.2 using Mann-Whitney tests 
and p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction. Mass 
cytometry data were transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine prior to expression 
analysis in Fig. 3b25.
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
For PD-1hi T cell quantification, cryopreserved cells were thawed into warm RPMI/10% 
FBS, washed once in cold PBS, and stained in PBS/1% BSA with the following antibodies 
for 45 minutes: anti-CD27-FITC (TB01), anti-CXCR3-PE (CEW33D), anti-CD4-PE-Cy7 
(RPA-T4), anti-ICOS-PerCP-Cy5.5 (ISA-3), anti-CXCR5-BV421 (J252D4), anti-CD45RA-
BV510 (HI100), anti-HLA-DR-BV605 (G46-6), anti-CD49d-BV711 (9F10), anti-PD-1-
APC (EH12.2H7), anti-CD3-AlexaFluor700 (HIT3A), anti-CD29-APC-Cy7 (TS2/16), 
propidium iodide. Antibodies used in additional panels included anti-SLAM-AF488 (A12), 
anti-SLAMF5-PE (CD84.1.21), anti-SLAMF6-PE (NT-7), anti-CCR2-PE (K036C2), anti-
CX3CR1-FITC (2A9-1), anti-CD38-PE (HIT2), anti-CD138-PE/Cy7 (MI15), anti-CTLA-4-
PerCP/Cy5.5 (L3D10) from BioLegend, anti-CCR5-FITC (2D7) and anti-FoxP3-AF647 
(236A/E7) from BD Biosciences, anti-LAG-3-APC from R&D Systems, anti-TIM-3-
PE/Cy7 (F38-2E2) and anti-TIGIT-PE (MBSA43) from eBioscience.
Cells were washed in cold PBS, passed through a 70-micron filter, and data acquired on a 
BD FACSAria Fusion, BD Fortessa, or BD Canto II analyzer using FACSDiva software. 
Data were analyzed using FlowJo 10.0.7. For blood cell quantification in Fig. 1 and 
Extended Data Fig. 2, samples were analyzed in uniformly processed batches of coded 
samples with multiple disease conditions included in each batch. Upon data acquisition, 
disease categories were assigned to data files. A single set of gates for PD-1, CXCR5, ICOS, 
and MHC II was applied to all samples. The percentage of PD-1hi T cell populations among 
memory CD4+ T cells populations and the percentage of plasmablasts (CD19+ CD20lo 
CD38hi CD27+) among total CD19+ B cells were calculated for indicated samples.
T cells were sorted directly from synovial fluid and synovial tissue samples. For sorting 
blood T cells, total CD4+ T cells were first isolated by magnetic bead negative selection 
(Miltenyi Biotec). Cell sorting was performed on a BD FACSAria Fusion sorter using a 70 
micron nozzle. Sort gates were drawn as depicted in Extended Data Fig. 1e. Cell purity was 
routinely >98%. For functional analyses, cells were sorted into cold RPMI/10% FBS. For 
RNA analyses, sorted cells were lysed in RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen) with 1% β-
mercaptoethanol (Sigma).
Intracellular cytokine staining
Synovial fluid mononuclear cells were stained with anti-PD-1-PE/Dazzle 594, CXCR5-
BV605, and CD4-BV650 (Biolegend), and propidium iodide. CXCR5- PD-1hi, PD-1int, and 
PD-1- CD4+ T cells sorted as above were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 
RPMI/10% FBS at a density of 5×105 cells/mL in 24-well plates. Cells were stimulated with 
either anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads at a ratio of 2:1 (cell:bead) for 24 hours, or with PMA 
(50ng/mL) and ionomycin (1μg/mL). Brefeldin A and monensin (both 1:1000, eBioscience) 
were added for the last 5 hours. Cells were washed twice in cold PBS, incubated for 30

and then fixed and permeabilized using the eBioscience Transcription Factor Fix/Perm 
Buffer. Cells were washed in PBS/1%BSA/0.3% saponin and incubated with anti-IL-21-
APC (3A3-N2), anti-IL-2-PE/Cy7 (MQ1-17H12), and anti-CXCL13-AlexaFluor700 (53610, 
R&D Systems) for 30 minutes, washed once, filtered, and data acquired on a BD Fortessa 
analyzer.
Intracellular transcription factor staining
Synovial tissue and synovial fluid cells were thawed, washed twice in PBS, and incubated 
with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 455UV (eBioscience) for 30 minutes. Cells were then 
washed in PBS/1%BSA and stained with antibodies against surface markers anti-CD3-
AF700, anti-CD4-BV650, anti-CCR2-PE, anti-CXCR5-BV421, anti-PD-1-PE/Dazzle 594 
(all Biolegend) for 30 minutes. Cells were washed once and incubated with eBioscience 
Transcription Factor Fix/Perm Buffer. Cells were washed in PBS/1%BSA/0.3% saponin and 
incubated in intracellular antibodies anti-MAF-PerCP-eFluor710 (sym0F1, eBioscience), 
anti-Bcl6-APC (BCL-UP, eBioscience), and anti-Blimp-1-AF488 (646702, R&D Systems) 
at 1:20 dilutions for 4 hours. Cells were washed once, filtered, and data acquired on a BD 
Fortessa analyzer. Intracellular detection of FoxP3 and CTLA-4 were performed by the same 
method on magnetic-bead purified blood CD4+ T cells using the indicated surface markers.

 RNA sequencing
RNA was isolated from 800-1000 cells from sorted T cell subpopulations as described. 5uL 
of total RNA were placed in wells of a 96-well plate and RNA sequencing libraries were 
prepared at Broad Technology Labs at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT using the 
Illumina SmartSeq2 platform. Samples were sequenced on a NextSeq500 using 75bp paired-
end reads to an average depth of 9M pairs of reads per sample. All cDNA transcripts from 
Ensembl release 82 were quantified with Kallisto version 0.42.426. We used limma to model 
each gene as a linear combination of donor-specific effects. The residuals from these models 
were tested by ANOVA across 8 gates, and 581 genes with a significant F statistic with <5% 
FDR were selected for PCA. Heatmaps show row-normalized relative gene expression z-
scores across columns (mean 0 and variance 1), with subpopulations of PD-1hi CXCR5- or 
PD-1hi CXCR5+ averaged to yield overall PD-1hi CXCR5- and PD-1hi CXCR5+ expression 
values. In comparisons of specific cell populations, genes with log fold change >1.2 and 
FDR <1% were considered differentially expressed.
PD-1hi cell in vitro stimulation assays
CD4+ T cells were purified from PBMCs from blood bank leukoreduction collars by 
magnetic bead negative selection and stained with anti-CD4-BV650, anti-CD45RA-BV510, 
anti-PD-1-APC, anti-CXCR5-BV605, and anti-CCR2-PE/Cy7. Naïve CD4+ T cells and 
memory CD4+ T cell subpopulations were sorted into RPMI/10% FBS. 50,000 cells were 
resuspended in RPMI/10%FBS at 0.25 × 106 cells/mL and cultured with anti-CD3/CD28 
beads (Dynabeads) at a cell:bead ratio of 5:1 for 2 or 7 days. Cells were then either re-
stained with anti-PD-1-PE and anti-CXCR5-BV421 antibodies and sorted into lysis buffer 
for RT-PCR analyses, or stained with CCR2-PE and CXCR5-BV421 and analyzed by 
intracellular flow cytometry for transcription factors as above.
T cell-B cell co-cultures
Total B cells were isolated first from PBMCs from blood bank leukoreduction collars by 
magnetic bead positive selection using CD19 (Miltenyi), then CD4+ T cells were isolated by 
negative selection. B cells were stained with CD14-APC, CD3-PeCy7, and CD27-BV510 
(all from Biolegend), and memory B cells sorted as CD27+ CD14- CD3- cells on a BD 
FACSAria Fusion to remove contaminating T cells and monocytes. Sorted T cell populations 
were co-cultured with autologous memory B cells at a ratio of 1:10 in 100uL of RPMI/
10%FBS and stimulated with LPS (5μg/mL) and SEB (1μg/mL) for 7 days. For co-cultures 
using synovial tissue or synovial fluid T cells, allogeneic memory B cells from PBMC were 
used. Supernatants were collected and total IgG measured by ELISA (eBioscience). Cells 
were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry, with plasmablasts defined as CD19+ 
CD20low CD38hi CD27+ and plasma cells defined as CD19+ CD20low CD38hi CD27+ 
CD138+. For blocking experiments, 10μg/ml anti-SLAMF5 or anti-SLAMF6 antibodies 
(Biolegend) or 20μg/mL IL-21R-Ig (R&D Systems) were used.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
6 micron sections of synovium frozen in OCT were fixed in acetone, rehydrated in PBS, and 
blocked with 10% normal goat serum prior to application of primary antibodies as follows:

 PD-1 (EH12.2H7, BioLegend), CD3 (SP7, Abcam), CD20 (L26, Dako), CXCR5 (MAB190, 
R&D Systems), all at a dilution of 1:100 except for CD20, which was used at 1:300. All 
secondary antibodies were raised in goat. CXCR5 was detected using anti mouse IgG2b 
biotin (Southern biotech) followed by streptavidin conjugated AlexaFluor 546 (Life 
Technologies), CD20 with anti-mouse IgG2a FITC (both Southern Biotech), PD-1 with anti-
mouse IgG1 conjugated to AlexaFluor 647 and CD3 with anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 546 (both 
Life Technologies). FITC staining was amplified with anti-FITC AlexaFluor 488 (Life 
Technologies). Slides were mounted using ProLong Diamond (Life Technologies), left to 
cure overnight and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope. Images were 
processed using Zen Black (Zeiss) and then ImageJ. Cell counts were performed on images 
obtained from confocal imaging using the Cell Counter plugin for ImageJ (imagej.net/
Cell_Counter). Synovial regions were categorized as ‘lymphoid aggregates’ when the B 
cells and T cells formed distinct clusters, and ‘diffusely infiltrated’ when B cells were 
loosely distributed within the synovium.
Statistical analyses
Statistical comparisons were performed as indicated in figure legends using two-sided tests. 
P-values < 0.05 were considered significant after adjusting for multiple testing using the 
Bonferroni correction for ANOVA (Fig. 2d) and blood mass cytometry analysis (Fig. 3b), or 
Dunn's test for non-parametric multi-group comparisons
