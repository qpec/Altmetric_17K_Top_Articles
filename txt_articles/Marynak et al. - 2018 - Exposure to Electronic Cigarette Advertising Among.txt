Exposure to Electronic Cigarette Advertising Among Middle and  
High School Students — United States, 2014–2016
Kristy Marynak, MPP1; Andrea Gentzke, PhD1; Teresa W. Wang, PhD1; Linda Neff, PhD1; Brian A. King, PhD1
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are the most commonly 
used tobacco product among U.S. middle and high school stu-
dents (1). Exposure to e-cigarette advertisements is associated 
with higher odds of current e-cigarette use among middle and 
high school students (2–4). To assess patterns of self-reported 
exposure to four e-cigarette advertising sources (retail stores, 
the Internet, television, and newspapers and magazines), CDC 
analyzed data from the 2014, 2015, and 2016 National Youth 
Tobacco Surveys (NYTSs). Overall, exposure to e-cigarette 
advertising from at least one source increased each year dur-
ing 2014–2016 (2014: 68.9%, 18.3 million; 2015: 73.0%, 
19.2 million; 2016: 78.2%, 20.5 million). In 2016, exposure 
was highest for retail stores (68.0%), followed by the Internet 
(40.6%), television (37.7%), and newspapers and magazines 
(23.9%). During 2014–2016, youth exposure to e-cigarette 
advertising increased for retail stores (54.8% to 68.0%), 
decreased for newspapers and magazines (30.4% to 23.9%), 
and did not significantly change for the Internet or television. 
A comprehensive strategy to prevent and reduce youth use 
of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products includes efforts to 
reduce youth exposure to e-cigarette advertising from a range 
of sources, including retail stores, television, the Internet, and 
print media such as newspapers and magazines (5).
Data were analyzed from the 2014, 2015, and 2016 NYTSs, 
a cross-sectional, paper-and-pencil survey administered to U.S. 
students in grades 6–12.* NYTS utilizes a three-stage cluster 
sampling design to generate a nationally representative sample 
of public and private school students. Sample sizes and response 
rates for 2014, 2015, and 2016 were 22,007 (73.3%), 17,711 
(63.4%), and 20,675 (71.6%), respectively.
Participants were asked “how often do you see advertise-
ments or promotions for electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes” 
from the following four sources: 1) “when you are using the 
Internet”; 2) “when you read newspapers or magazines”; 
3) “when you go to a convenience store, supermarket, or 
gas station”; and 4) “when you watch television or go to the 
movies.” Movies were omitted from the question after 2014. 
Response options for each question were “I do not [use/visit 
the source]”; “never”; “rarely”; “sometimes”; “most of the time”; 
and “always.” Consistent with previous research, students who 
reported “sometimes,” “most of the time,” or “always” were 
classified as “exposed” to advertisements from each source; 
* https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/surveys/nyts/index.htm.
those who selected “never,” “rarely,” or “I do not [use/visit the 
source]” were classified as “not exposed” (6). The number of 
exposure sources were summed for each student and reported 
as the percentage of all students who were exposed to one, two, 
three, or four sources.
Data were weighted to account for the complex survey design 
and adjusted for nonresponse. Prevalence estimates and 95% 
confidence intervals of exposure to each source, and to any source, 
were computed. Estimates of exposure were assessed overall and 
by sex, race/ethnicity, school grade, current (past 30-day) use of 
e-cigarettes, and current (past 30-day) use of any other tobacco 
product.† Within each year, t-tests were used to assess statistically 
significant differences between levels of each covariate relative to 
the referent group (p<0.05). Between-year differences in the overall 
percentage of students exposed to each advertisement source dur-
ing 2014–2016 were assessed using the Wald F test and posthoc 
corrections for multiple hypothesis testing (p<0.0167).§
Among U.S. middle and high school students during 2014–
2016, exposure to e-cigarette advertisements from any source 
increased from 68.9% (18.3 million) to 78.2% (20.5 million) 
(Figure 1) (Table). In 2016, exposure was highest for retail 
stores (68.0%, 17.7 million), followed by the Internet (40.6%, 
10.6 million), television (37.7%, 9.7 million), and newspapers and 
magazines (23.9%, 6.2 million). In 2016, exposure to advertising 
from any source was more prevalent among females (79.9%) than 
males (76.5%); non-Hispanic whites (79.6%) than Hispanics 
(77.0%) and students of other non-Hispanic races/ethnicities 
(73.6%); 8th (78.5%), 10th (81.0%), 11th (79.3%), and 12th 
graders (79.0%) than 6th graders (75.0%); high school students 
(79.2%) than middle school students (76.9%); current e-cigarette 
users (82.8%) than nonusers (77.9%); and current users of other 
tobacco products (82.7%) than nonusers (77.6%). Exposure to 
each advertising source was higher among current e-cigarette users 
and other tobacco product users than nonusers during 2014, 
2015, and 2016 (Table).
† Current use of other tobacco products is based on respondents’ self-reported use 
of cigarettes, cigars [includes cigars, cigarillos, and little cigars], smokeless tobacco 
[includes chewing tobacco/snuff/dip, snus, and dissolvable tobacco], hookah/
waterpipe, regular pipe, and/or bidis at least one day in the past 30 days.
§ Statistical tests for differences in e-cigarette advertisement exposure sources by 
year (2014, 2015, and 2016) were assessed by the Wald F-Test (ANOVA); 
p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Posthoc comparisons 
for changes in e-cigarette advertisement exposures between years (2014–2015, 
2015–2016, and 2014–2016) were assessed as model-adjusted risk differences 
from predicted marginals in logistic regression (t-test). A p-value <0.0167, 
adjusted for multiple comparisons, was considered statistically significant.

Overall in 2016, 28.3% of students reported exposure to 
e-cigarette advertising from one source, 21.2% from two 
sources, 16.7% from three sources, and 12.0% from four sources 
(Figure 2). Retail stores were the most common exposure source 
every year (2014: 54.8%; 2015: 59.9%; 2016: 68.0%), whereas 
newspapers and magazines were the least common exposure 
source (2014: 30.4%; 2015: 31.0%; 2016: 23.9%). The Internet 
was the second most common exposure source in 2014 (39.8%) 
and 2016 (40.6%); in 2015, television (44.5%) exceeded the 
Internet (42.6%) as the second most common exposure source.
During 2014–2016, middle and high school students’ 
exposure to e-cigarette advertising significantly increased for 
retail stores (from 54.8% to 68.0%), significantly decreased 
for newspapers and magazines (from 30.4% to 23.9%), and 
did not significantly change for Internet and television.
Discussion
In 2016, an estimated four in five (20.5 million) U.S. youths, 
including 8.9 million middle school students and 11.5 million 
high school students, were exposed to e-cigarette advertisements 
from at least one source, a 13% increase over 2014. Exposure in 
retail stores increased 24% in 2016 compared with 2014, and 
was the primary factor responsible for the increases in exposure 
from any source during 2014–2016. Nearly seven in 10 youths 
(17.7 million) were exposed to e-cigarette advertising in retail 
stores in 2016; approximately two in five were exposed on the 
Internet (10.6 million) or television (9.7 million), and nearly one 
in four (6.2 million) were exposed in newspapers and magazines. 
Given the Surgeon General has established that a causal relation-
ship exists between traditional tobacco advertising and youth 
tobacco product initiation (7), and given the association between 
e-cigarette advertising exposure and e-cigarette use among youths 
(2–4), efforts to reduce youth e-cigarette advertising exposure 
are an important component of comprehensive youth tobacco 
prevention efforts (5).
During 2014–2016, current users of e-cigarettes and other 
tobacco products reported higher prevalence of exposure to 
e-cigarette advertising than nonusers. This is consistent with 
research documenting an association between e-cigarette adver-
tising exposure and e-cigarette use (2–4). However, this rela-
tionship might not be limited to e-cigarettes; previous research 
has demonstrated that among U.S. youths aged 12–17 years, 
receptivity to e-cigarette marketing is associated with suscep-
tibility to conventional cigarette smoking (8). Prevention of 
youth exposure to e-cigarette advertising might, therefore, be 
important for prevention of youth use of all tobacco products.
The Surgeon General has concluded that e-cigarette mar-
keting employs strategies similar to conventional cigarette

 * Exposure to each e-cigarette advertisement source was assessed by the following questions: Retail Stores: “When you go to a convenience store, super market, or gas 
station, how often do you see ads or promotions for e-cigarettes?”; Internet: “When you are using the internet, how often do you see ads or promotions for e-cigarettes?”; 
Television (TV)/Movies: In 2014, Television/movie exposure was assessed by the question 
“When you watch TV or go to the movies, how often do you see ads or promotions 
for e-cigarettes?” In 2015–2016, only TV exposures were assessed: “When you watch TV, how often do you see ads or promotions for e-cigarettes?”; and Newspaper and 
Magazines: “When you read newspapers or magazines, how often do you see ads or promotions for e-cigarettes?” For all questions, response options included “Never, 
Rarely, Sometimes, Most of the time, or Always.” A “not applicable” (N/A) response was also included to capture respondents who did not use each advertising source. 
Respondents were categorized as “Exposed” if they reported seeing ads or promotions “sometimes,” “most of the time,” or “always.” Respondents were categorized as 
“Unexposed” if they reported seeing ads or promotions 
“never,” or 
“rarely.” Individuals who reported N/A were included in the analysis in the 
“Unexposed” group. A composite 
measure of any advertisement exposure (any source) is assessed based on exposure to retail, internet, television/movies, and print ad exposures.

advertising tactics that have been proven to appeal to youths, 
such as themes of romance, freedom, and rebellion; celebrity 
endorsements; and health claims (5,7). Exposure to e-cigarette 
advertising might reduce youths’ perception of harm associ-
ated with e-cigarettes and increase their beliefs that e-cigarettes 
can be used where smoking is prohibited (8). Product design 
features might also influence use. For example, JUUL, the 
top-selling U.S. e-cigarette brand,¶ is an e-cigarette shaped like 
a USB flash drive that has a high nicotine concentration (9). 
According to news reports and social media posts, students are 
using JUUL in school classrooms and bathrooms (9).**,†† In 
addition, e-cigarettes are marketed and promoted using strate-
gies that are not legally permissible for conventional cigarettes, 
including television, sports, and music event sponsorships, in-
store self-service displays, and advertisements placed outside 
of brick-and-mortar businesses at children’s eye level (5,10).
As of August 2016, the Food and Drug Administration enforces 
restrictions on e-cigarette sales to minors, including those over the 
Internet.§§ Additional actions to reduce youths’ tobacco access 
and advertising exposure could include requiring that e-cigarettes 
are sold in adult-only facilities, limiting tobacco outlet density

or proximity to schools, prohibiting self-service displays, and 
requiring face-to-face transactions for all e-cigarette purchases (6). 
Additional potential strategies include regulation of advertising 
with demonstrated youth appeal or broad youth reach at retail 
stores, on television, online, and in print media; and high-impact 
tobacco education campaigns that warn youths about the dangers 
of any tobacco product use, including e-cigarettes (5,6).
The findings in this study are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, self-reports of advertising exposure might be subject 
to reporting bias. Moreover, current e-cigarette users might be 
more likely to recall exposure than nonusers. Second, the NYTS 
might not be representative of all U.S. youths, because it does 
not capture those who are homeschooled, have dropped out 
of school, or are in detention centers. However, data from the 
Current Population Survey indicate that 98.5%, 98.0%, and 
93.0% of U.S. youths aged 10–13, 14–15, and 16–17 years, 
respectively, were enrolled in a traditional school in 2016.¶¶ 
Third, advertising exposure might be underestimated because 
exposure from other potential sources such as sporting events, 
radio, billboards, or movies was not assessed. Finally, the 
removal of movies as a source of exposure after 2014 limited the 
comparability of television e-cigarette advertisements between 
years. However, this change likely resulted in an underestima-
tion of exposure in 2015 and 2016.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
E-cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product 
among U.S. middle and high school students. E-cigarette 
advertising is associated with e-cigarette use among youths, 
and employs themes and strategies that are similar to conven-
tional cigarette advertising tactics that have been proven to 
appeal to youths.
What is added by this report?
In 2016, an estimated 4 in 5 (20.5 million) U.S. middle and high 
school students were exposed to e-cigarette advertisements 
from at least one source, a significant increase over 2014 and 
2015. Nearly seven in 10 youths (17.7 million) were exposed to 
e-cigarette advertising in retail stores in 2016, while approxi-
mately two in five were exposed on the Internet or on televi-
sion, and nearly one in four were exposed through newspapers 
and magazines.
What are the implications for public health practice?
As part of comprehensive youth tobacco prevention efforts, 
approaches to reduce youth access to e-cigarettes and 
exposure to advertising could include regulation of youth-
oriented marketing, restrictions on youth access to tobacco 
products in retail settings, and high-impact youth-focused 
tobacco education campaigns.
Exposure to e-cigarette advertisements increased among 
U.S. middle and high school students during 2014–2016. 
As part of comprehensive youth tobacco prevention efforts, 
approaches to reduce youth access to e-cigarettes and exposure 
to e-cigarette advertising could include regulation of youth-
oriented marketing, restrictions on youth access to tobacco 
products in retail settings, and high-impact youth-focused 
tobacco education campaigns (5). These approaches, coupled 
with comprehensive state tobacco control programs, have 
the potential to prevent and reduce youth use of all tobacco 
products, including e-cigarettes (5).
