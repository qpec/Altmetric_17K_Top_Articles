Diabetes Care 2016;39:353–362 | DOI: 10.2337/dc15-1736
OBJECTIVE
This study assessed the efficacy/safety of canagliflozin (CANA), a sodium–glucose
cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, plus metformin extended-release (MET) initial
therapy in drug-na¨
ıve type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
This 26-week, double-blind, phase 3 study randomized 1,186 patients to CANA
100 mg (CANA100)/MET, CANA 300 mg (CANA300)/MET, CANA100, CANA300, or
MET. Primary end point was change in HbA1c at week 26 for combinations versus
monotherapies. Secondary end points included noninferiority in HbA1c lowering
with CANA monotherapy versus MET; changes in fasting plasma glucose, body
weight, and blood pressure; and proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7.0%
(<53 mmol/mol).
RESULTS
From mean baseline HbA1c of 8.8% (73 mmol/mol), CANA100/MET and CANA300/
MET significantly lowered HbA1c versus MET (median dose, 2,000 mg/day) by
–1.77%, –1.78%, and –1.30% (–19.3, –19.5, and –14.2 mmol/mol; differences of
20.46% and –0.48% [–5.0 and –5.2 mmol/mol]; P = 0.001) and versus CANA100
and CANA300 by –1.37% and –1.42% (–15.0 and –15.5 mmol/mol; differences of
–0.40% and –0.36% [–4.4 and –3.9 mmol/mol]; P = 0.001). CANA100 and CANA300
monotherapy met noninferiority for HbA1c lowering and had significantly more
weight loss versus MET (–2.8, –3.7, and –1.9 kg [–3.0%, –3.9%, and –2.1%];
P = 0.016 and P = 0.002). Greater attainment of HbA1c <7.0% (50%, 57%, and
43%) and significantly more weight loss (–3.2, –3.9, and –1.9 kg [–3.5%, –4.2%,
and –2.1%]; P = 0.001) occurred with CANA100/MET and CANA300/MET versus
MET. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) related to SGLT2 inhibition (genital
mycotic infections, osmotic diuresis– and volume depletion–related AEs) was
higher in the CANA arms (0.4–4.4%) versus MET (0–0.8%). AE-related discontinu-
ation rates were 1.3–3.0% across groups. The incidence of hypoglycemia was
3.0–5.5% in the CANA arms and 4.6% with MET.
CONCLUSIONS
Initial therapy with CANA plus MET was more effective and generally well toler-
ated versus each monotherapy in drug-na¨
ıve type 2 diabetes. CANA monotherapy
demonstrated noninferior HbA1c lowering versus MET.

 The American Diabetes Association
(ADA) and the European Association
for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recom-
mend individualized HbA1c targets of ap-
proximately ,7.0% (,53 mmol/mol)
for patients with type 2 diabetes (1,2)
if this target can be achieved safely with-
out unwanted side effects, as glycemic
control can lower the risk of diabetes-
related complications (3,4). A range of
antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs) is
available to manage hyperglycemia in
patients with type 2 diabetes (1). Met-
formin (MET) monotherapy is the stan-
dard first-line AHA; however, its use is
limited in some patients due to poor
gastrointestinal tolerability (1). In addi-
tion, patients with elevated baseline
HbA1c may have difficulty meeting gly-
cemic targets with a single AHA (5,6).
Thus, many people will require combi-
nation therapy with two or three AHAs
to achieve individualized glycemic
targets (1).
Early intervention with combination
therapy has been successful in the man-
agement of chronic conditions such as
hypertension, and a similar approach is
recommended for patients with type 2
diabetes (7). Physicians are increasingly
initiating dual therapy as the prelimi-
nary treatment strategy in patients
who would benefit from a more proactive
approach to glycemic control (i.e., those
with HbA1c $9.0% [$75 mmol/mol]).
The ADA/EASD support initiation of
dual therapy in newly diagnosed pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes and
HbA1c $9.0% ($75 mmol/mol) (1).
Similarly, combination therapy is rec-
ommended in Canada for patients with
HbA1c $8.5% ($69 mmol/mol)(8).Incon-
trast, the American Association of Clinical
Endocrinologists supports initiation of dual
therapy in patients with a lower baseline
HbA1c (i.e., $7.5% [$58 mmol/mol]) (9),
but there are no randomized controlled
studies at that early stage to substantiate
such an aggressive approach for relatively
mild HbA1c elevations that can be poten-
tially controlled by a single agent. There-
fore, an evaluation of the efficacy and
safety of initial combinations of newer
AHA classes with established therapies,
such as MET, is important.
The recently revised ADA/EASD rec-
ommendations include sodium–glucose
cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors as an-
other suitable add-on option for combi-
nation therapy due to their favorable
efficacy and safety profile (1). Canagli-
flozin (CANA) is an SGLT2 inhibitor de-
veloped for the treatment of adults with
type 2 diabetes (10–23). CANA lowers
the renal threshold for glucose, thereby
increasing urinary glucose excretion
(UGE); increased UGE results in insulin-
independent glucose-lowering effects,
as well as a mild osmotic diuresis and
net caloric loss that can lead to weight
loss and blood pressure (BP) reductions
(24,25). Across phase 3 studies in a
broad range of patients with type 2 di-
abetes, CANA provided reductions in
HbA1c, body weight, and BP and was
generally well tolerated as monother-
apy and in combination with other
AHAs, including MET (11–23). This study
evaluated the efficacy and safety of ini-
tial combination therapy with CANA
100 mg (CANA100) or CANA 300 mg
(CANA300) plus MET in drug-na¨
ıve pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes over 26
weeks. In addition, changes in HbA1c
and body weight with CANA monother-
apy versus MET monotherapy were as-
sessed with sufficient statistical power.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Design and Patients
This double-blind, five-arm, parallel-
group, phase 3 study was conducted at
158 centers in 12 countries from 16 May
2013 to 1 December 2014. The study
consisted of a 2-week, single-blind, pla-
cebo run-in period, followed by a 26-week,
double-blind treatment phase and
4 weeks of follow-up for all patients.
Eligible patients were $18 and ,75
years of age with drug-na¨
ıve type 2
diabetes (i.e., not on AHA therapy or
off for $12 weeks before screening)
that was inadequately controlled with
diet and exercise (HbA1c $7.5% and
#12.0% [$58 and #108 mmol/mol] at
screening). Patients were excluded if
they had a history of type 1 diabetes;
repeated fasting self-monitored blood
glucose .300 mg/dL (.16.7 mmol/L);
myocardial infarction, unstable angina,
revascularization procedure, or cerebro-
vascular accident #12 weeks before
screening; history of New York Heart As-
sociation Functional Classification III
and/or IV cardiac disease; uncontrolled
hypertension; estimated glomerular filtra-
tion rate (eGFR) ,60 mL/min/1.73 m2
or serum creatinine $1.4 mg/dL
($124 mmol/L) for men and $1.3 mg/dL
($115 mmol/L) for women; or were
taking any AHA within 12 weeks before
screening or during the placebo run-in pe-
riod. Patients were discontinued from the
study if they had fasting plasma glucose
(FPG) values meeting prespecified glyce-
mic withdrawal criteria (FPG .270 mg/dL
[.15.0mmol/L]afterday1throughweek6;
.240 mg/dL [.13.3 mmol/L] after week
6 through week 12; .200 mg/dL
[.11.1 mmol/L] after week 12 through
week 26), serum creatinine $1.5 mg/dL
($133 mmol/L) for men or $1.4 mg/dL
($124 mmol/L) for women, or eGFR
,50 mL/min/1.73 m2.
The study was conducted in accor-
dance with the ethical principles that
have their origin in the Declaration of
Helsinki and are consistent with Good
Clinical Practice and applicable regula-
tory requirements. Regulatory approval
for the conduct of the trial was obtained
in each country, and ethics approval was
received at every site before initiation.
Patients provided written informed con-
sent before participation.
Randomization and Blinding
Patients were randomized (1:1:1:1:1) to
receive CANA100/MET extended-release
(XR), CANA300/MET XR, CANA100,
CANA300, or MET XR over 26 weeks
usingacomputer-generatedrandomization
schedule that was prepared by the sponsor
before the study. Randomization was bal-
anced using permuted blocks and stratified
by HbA1c values at screening (i.e., ,9.0%
or $9.0% [,75 or $75 mmol/mol]). FPG
andHbA1cvaluesweremasked tothestudy
sites and to the sponsor, unless an FPG
value met glycemic discontinuation criteria.
At week –2, all patients received pla-
cebo tablets matching MET XR 500 mg
and placebo capsules matching CANA.
Patients were instructed to take three
pills each day during the 2-week, single-
blind, placebo run-in period: one pla-
cebo capsule matching CANA before
the morning meal, then one placebo cap-
sule matching CANA and one placebo
tablet matching MET XR 500 mg with
the evening meal. MET XR was adminis-
tered in the evening to minimize adverse
gastrointestinal effects. During the double-
blind treatment period, patients in all
treatment groups were instructed to
take two capsules of CANA or matching
placebo each day to maintain blinding,
with one capsule taken before the morn-
ing meal and one capsule taken with the
354
Canagliflozin/Metformin Initial Therapy
Diabetes Care Volume 39, March 2016
 evening meal. The doses of CANA were
not titrated.
Patients randomly assigned to the
treatment groups with MET XR (as
monotherapy or coadministered with
CANA) received 500 mg tablets or
matching placebo that were adminis-
tered with the evening meal and titrated
as follows: one tablet (500 mg/day)
from day 1 through week 1; two tablets
(1,000 mg/day) from week 1 through
week 3; three tablets (1,500 mg/day)
from week 3 through week 6; and four
tablets (2,000 mg/day) from week 6
through week 9. At week 9, patients
meeting protocol-specified glycemic cri-
teria who did not previously uptitrate
MET XR to 2,000 mg/day or matching
placebo for reasons other than tolerabil-
ity were allowed to uptitrate with MET
XR 500 mg (or matching placebo) up to
2,000 mg/day.
End Points and Assessments
The prespecified primary efficacy end
point was the change from baseline in
HbA1c at week 26. Key secondary end
points included the change from base-
line in FPG and systolic BP (SBP), percent
change from baseline in body weight
and fasting plasma lipids, and the pro-
portion of patients with HbA1c ,7.0%
(,53 mmol/mol) at week 26. Overall
safety and tolerability were assessed
based on adverse event (AE) reports,
safety laboratory tests, vital signs
measurements, and physical examina-
tions. The incidence of documented hy-
poglycemia (i.e., fingerstick or plasma
glucose #70 mg/dL [#3.9 mmol/L],
with or without symptoms or severe
episodes [i.e., requiring assistance or
resulting in seizure, loss of conscious-
ness, or cognitive dysfunction]) was
also assessed.
Statistical Analyses
The primary hypothesis for this study
was that each CANA/MET combination
provides statistically superior HbA1c
lowering compared with their respec-
tive monotherapies. Key secondary hy-
potheses included demonstrating that
CANA100 and CANA300 provide nonin-
ferior HbA1c reductions (based on the
prespecified margin of 0.35% for the
between-group difference) and greater
reductions in body weight versus MET
and that coadministration of CANA and
MET provides greater reductions in body
weight, greater proportions of patients
achieving HbA1c ,7.0% (53 mmol/mol),
greater reductions in SBP, greater in-
creases in HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and
greater decreases in triglycerides com-
pared with MET.
The sample size was determined
based on demonstrating the statistical
superiority of each dose of CANA in
combination with MET to their respec-
tive monotherapies in HbA1c lowering,
as well as demonstrating the noninfer-
iority of each dose of CANA compared
with MET. A total of 216 patients per
group were estimated to be required to
achieve 90% power for both compari-
sons, with an assumed minimum group
difference of 0.4% and an assumed SD
of 1.15% using a two-sample, two-sided
t test, with a type I error rate of 0.05. To
provide 90% power to demonstrate the
noninferiority of either CANA dose
compared with MET (assuming a
difference of 0.0% and a common SD
of 1.15% using a two-sample, one-
sided t test, with a type I error rate
of 0.025), 240 patients were required
per group, assuming 5% of patients
would have missing HbA1c values at
week 26.
Efficacy analyses were conducted us-
ing the modified intent-to-treat (mITT)
population (i.e., all patients who were
randomized and received $1 dose of
the double-blind study drug). Safety
analyses were performed in the mITT
population according to the predomi-
nant treatment received. The primary
efficacy end point of change from base-
line in HbA1c was analyzed with a mixed
model for repeated measures (MMRM)
using a restricted maximum likelihood
approach. This analysis was based on
observed data that included treatment,
stratification factor (i.e., HbA1c ,9.0 or
$9.0% [,75 or $75 mmol/mol] at
screening), visit, and treatment-by-visit
interaction as fixed categorical effects,
and baseline and baseline-by-visit inter-
action as continuous fixed covariates.
Least squares (LS) mean differences
and 95% CIs were estimated at week
26 for each combination versus MET
and versus their respective CANA mono-
therapy, as well as for CANA100 and
CANA300 versus MET.
Continuous secondary end points
(e.g., FPG, body weight, BP) were ana-
lyzed with an MMRM similar to the pri-
mary efficacy end point. Percent changes
from baseline in lipids were analyzed
using an ANCOVA, with treatment and
the stratification factor as fixed effects
and the corresponding baseline value
as a covariate. Given the skewed nature
of the distribution of the percent
change in triglycerides, the Wilcoxon
rank sum test was used to evaluate treat-
ment comparisons. Missing lipids data
were imputed using the last observation
carried forward approach, as longitudinal
analysis was not possible due to the
collection schedule for lipids in the
study. The binary secondary end point
of the proportion of patients with HbA1c
,7.0% (,53 mmol/mol) was analyzed
longitudinally using a generalized linear
mixed model, with similar terms as the
primary efficacy analysis.
A prespecified hierarchical testing
procedure was used to control the over-
all type I error rate (two-sided a = 0.05)
based on the mixture methodology
developed by Dmitrienko and Tamhane
(26). Hochberg-type procedures were
used for testing the hypotheses, and
Hochberg-adjusted P values are reported
for the prespecified comparisons
only.
RESULTS
Patients
A total of 1,186 patients were random-
ized and received $1 dose of the study
drug, comprising the mITT analysis
set; of these, 1,069 (90.1%) completed
26 weeks of treatment (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Discontinuations were reported
in 5.1%, 10.5%, 11.0%, 9.2%, and 13.5%
of patients who received CANA100/MET,
CANA300/MET, CANA100, CANA300, and
MET, respectively; overall, the most com-
mon reasons for discontinuation were
meeting glycemic withdrawal criteria
(2.3%) and AEs (2.2%). Baseline demo-
graphic and disease characteristics were
generally similar across treatment groups
(Table 1). Patients had a mean baseline
HbA1c of 8.8% (73 mmol/mol) and a
mean eGFR of 88 mL/min/1.73 m2; 48%
of participants were male, mean age
was 54.9 years, and mean duration of
type 2 diabetes was 3.3 years. At
week 26, the mean dose of MET was
1,924, 1,909, and 1,930 mg/day in the
CANA100/MET, CANA300/MET, and
MET groups, respectively.

 Efficacy
Glycemic Efficacy
At week 26, reductions from baseline in
HbA1c were seen with CANA100/MET,
CANA300/MET, CANA100, CANA300,
and MET (–1.77%, 21.78%, –1.37%,
–1.42%, and –1.30% [–19.3, –19.5,
–15.0, –15.5, and –14.2 mmol/mol], re-
spectively), resulting in final mean HbA1c
values of 7.0%, 7.0%, 7.4%, 7.3%, and
7.4% (53, 53, 57, 56, and 57 mmol/mol),
respectively (Fig. 1A and Table 2). Re-
ductions in HbA1c with CANA100/
MET and CANA300/MET were statisti-
cally significant versus MET (LS mean
differences of –0.46% and –0.48%
[–5.0 and –5.2 mmol/mol], respec-
tively; P = 0.001 for both) and versus
CANA100 and CANA300 (LS mean dif-
ferences of –0.40% and –0.36% [–4.4
and –3.9 mmol/mol], respectively;
P = 0.001 for both). Noninferiority of
HbA1c lowering was also demonstrated
with CANA100 and CANA300 versus
MET (LS mean differences of –0.06%
and –0.11% [–0.7 and –1.2 mmol/mol],
respectively; noninferiority P = 0.001
for both). At week 26, significant differ-
ences in the proportion of patients who
achieved HbA1c ,7.0% (,53 mmol/mol)
were observed with CANA100/MET and
CANA300/MET versus MET (P = 0.027 and
P = 0.016, respectively); 49.6%, 56.8%,
38.8%, 42.8%, and 43.0% of patients
achieved HbA1c ,7.0% (,53 mmol/mol)
with CANA100/MET, CANA300/MET,
CANA100, CANA300, and MET, respec-
tively (Fig. 1B). A subgroup analysis
showed greater HbA1c reductions
with CANA100/MET, CANA300/MET,
CANA100, and CANA300 compared
with MET in patients with baseline
HbA1c $9.0% ($75 mmol/mol) (–2.43%,
22.44%, –1.94%, –2.03%, and –1.79%
[–26.6, –26.7, –21.2, –22.2, and –19.6
mmol/mol], respectively) versus
those with baseline HbA1c ,9.0% (,75
mmol/mol) (–1.32%, –1.31%, –0.97%,
–0.99%, and –0.94% [–14.4, –14.3, –10.6,
–10.8, and –10.3 mmol/mol], respectively)
(Fig. 1C).
Dose-related reductions in FPG
were observed with CANA100/MET
and CANA300/MET that were greater
compared with their respective mono-
therapies (Fig. 1D and Table 2). Across
groups, FPG appeared to reach the
nadir at week 6 and then remained
stable through week 26 with each
treatment.
Body Weight and BP
At week 26, reductions in body weight
from baseline were observed across
groups (–3.2, –3.9, –2.8, –3.7, and –1.9 kg
[23.5%, –4.2%, –3.0%, –3.9%, and –2.1%]
with CANA100/MET, CANA300/MET,
CANA100, CANA300, and MET, respec-
tively) (Fig. 1E and Table 2). Body weight
reductions were largest from baseline
to week 6 and decreased steadily, with
no apparent plateau through week 26.
Statistically significant reductions in body
weight were seen with CANA100/MET
and CANA300/MET versus MET (LS
mean differences of –1.2 and –2.0 kg
[–1.4% and –2.1%], respectively; P =
0.001 for both). CANA100 and CANA300
also provided significant reductions in
body weight relative to MET (LS mean dif-
ferences of –0.9 and –1.8 kg [–0.9% and
–1.8%], respectively; P = 0.016 and
P = 0.002, respectively).
CANA100/MET, CANA300/MET,
CANA100, and CANA300 provided
modest reductions in SBP compared
with MET (–2.2, –1.7, –2.2, –2.4, and
–0.3 mmHg, respectively) (Table 2 and
Supplementary Fig. 2). Reductions in SBP
with CANA100/MET and CANA300/
MET were not statistically significant ver-
sus MET (LS mean differences of –1.9
and –1.3 mmHg, respectively). Modest
reductions in diastolic BP (DBP) were ob-
served at week 26 that were greater in all
CANA arms compared with MET (Table 2).
Fasting Plasma Lipids
Changes from baseline in fasting plasma
lipids are summarized in Table 2. Increases
in HDL-C were seen with CANA100/MET,

compared with MET (15.5%, 14.5%,
17.6%, 16.6%, and 10.2%, respectively); LS
mean differences for CANA100/MET,
CANA300/MET, CANA100, and CANA300
versus MET were 5.3%, 4.3%, 7.4%, and
6.5%,respectively.Medianpercentchanges
from baseline in triglycerides were 2.9%,
7.8%, –8.7%, –7.3%, and 4.2% with
CANA100/MET, CANA300/MET, CANA100,
CANA300, and MET, respectively. Owing to
the lack of significance of testing SBP in the
prior step of the hypothesis testing se-
quence, statistical testing of HDL-C and tri-
glycerides was not performed. CANA100/
MET and CANA300/MET provided similar
increases in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) versus
MET (LS mean differences of –0.2% and
1.2%, respectively), but increases in LDL-C
were greater with CANA100 and CANA300
versusMET (LS mean differencesof10.3%
and 7.4%, respectively).
Safety and Tolerability
The overall incidence of AEs was 41.8%,
44.3%, 37.1%, 39.9%, and 37.6% with
CANA100/MET, CANA300/MET, CANA100,
CANA300, and MET, respectively, over
26 weeks (Table 3). AEs leading to discon-
tinuation were reported in 1.3–3.0% of
patients across groups. The incidence of
serious AEs was low across groups
(#3.0%), with no discernible trend across
treatment groups. One death occurred in

 the MET group during the 26-week treat-
ment period that was not considered to be
related to study drug by the investigator.
Across treatment groups, no specific
AE had an incidence $5%. Overall, the
most commonly reported AE was diar-
rhea, with the highest incidence seen in
the CANA/MET groups (4.2% for each
dose) compared with CANA100 (1.3%),
CANA300 (1.7%), and MET (1.3%). The
overall incidence of gastrointestinal-
related AEs (i.e., diarrhea, nausea, vom-
iting), which are commonly associated
with MET, ranged from 1.7 to 4.6%
across groups.
The incidence of AEs related to the
mechanism of SGLT2 inhibition was
generally higher in the CANA/MET and
CANA monotherapy arms. Incidences of
genital mycotic infections were #4.0%
in men and #4.4% in women in the
CANA arms and 0% in the MET group.
All genital mycotic infections were re-
ported as mild or moderate in intensity,
and none led to discontinuation. Urinary
tract infections (UTIs) were reported in
1.3–3.0% of patients across groups. No
upper UTIs were reported. One UTI was
reported as a serious AE with CANA300,
but the patient remained in the study.
Only one UTI in the CANA300/MET
group led to discontinuation. Incidences
of AEs related to osmotic diuresis (e.g.,
pollakiuria [increased urine frequency],
polyuria [increased urine volume]), vol-
ume depletion (e.g., postural dizziness,
hypotension), and renal function (e.g.,
glomerular filtration rate decreased,
blood creatinine increased) were low
across groups, but higher in all CANA
groups versus MET.
The incidence of documented hypogly-
cemia episodes was 4.2%, 5.5%, 3.0%,
3.8%, and 4.6% with CANA100/MET,
CANA300/MET, CANA100, CANA300,
and MET, respectively. One patient expe-
rienced two episodes of severe hypogly-
cemia while taking MET. No hypoglycemia
episodes with glucose values ,36 mg/dL
(,2.0 mmol/L) were reported in any
treatment group.
Overall, no clinically meaningful differ-
ences in safety laboratory parameters
were observed (Supplementary Table 1).
Modest increasesin hemoglobin wereob-
served with CANA100/MET, CANA300/
MET, CANA100, and CANA300 compared
with MET (1.6%, 2.9%, 4.4%, 4.2%,
and –1.5%, respectively). Increases in
blood urea nitrogen were also seen in

 patients who received CANA. Reductions
from baseline in alanine aminotransfer-
ase and serum urate were observed in
the CANA groups compared with MET.
Consistent with previous studies of
CANA (11–23), all CANA groups experi-
enced early reductions in eGFR and
commensurate increases in serum cre-
atinine that attenuated over 26 weeks
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
CONCLUSIONS
Initial combination therapy consisting
of CANA100 or CANA300 plus MET was
associated with glycemic improve-
ments and body weight reductions
and was generally well tolerated com-
pared with CANA alone and MET alone
in drug-na¨
ıve patients with type 2
diabetes over 26 weeks. Relative to MET
and CANA monotherapy, CANA100/MET
and CANA300/MET provided statisti-
cally significant greater reductions in
HbA1c and body weight. CANA100/MET
and CANA300/MET were also associated
with a significantly higher proportion of
patients who achieved HbA1c ,7.0%
(,53 mmol/mol) versus MET monother-
apy. In addition, noninferiority in HbA1c
lowering and greater reductions in
body weight were demonstrated with
CANA100 and CANA300 as monotherapy
than with MET, suggesting that CANA
may provide an alternative to standard
first-line antihyperglycemic therapy
in newly diagnosed patients with type 2
diabetes, especially in those who cannot
tolerate MET. Across groups, greater re-
ductions in HbA1c were seen in patients
withbaselineHbA1c$9.0%($75mmol/mol)
versus those with baseline HbA1c ,9.0%
(,75 mmol/mol). The patterns of HbA1c
reductions with CANA100/MET and
CANA300/MET versus their respective
monotherapies and with CANA100 and
CANA300 versus MET were consistent in
both baseline HbA1c subgroups.
Consistent with the current study,
greater reductions in HbA1c have been
observed in studies with combinations
that included other SGLT2 inhibitors
(i.e., dapagliflozin/MET, dapagliflozin/
saxagliptin, and empagliflozin/linagliptin)
versus their respective monotherapies
(27–29). However, a lack of additivity in
the HbA1c response, based on HbA1c
changes with the respective monothera-
pies, was reported in these studies. Of
note, subadditive HbA1c lowering was
observed with the combinations of
SGLT2 inhibitors and dipeptidyl pepti-
dase 4 inhibitors (i.e., dapagliflozin/
saxagliptin, empagliflozin/linagliptin),
even though dipeptidyl peptidase 4
inhibition might be expected to attenu-
ate SGLT2 inhibition–mediated glucagon
increases, thereby preventing endoge-
nous glucose production (EGP) (27,29).
Less than additive HbA1c-lowering ef-
fects were also observed in the current
study with the CANA/MET combinations
and have been observed in studies of
other combination treatments (27–35),
with few exceptions (36), even when
the individual agents have complemen-
tary mechanisms. The less than additive
efficacy commonly observed with combi-
nation treatments may be at least partly
due to a “floor effect,” as the efficacy of
each individual agent depends on base-
line HbA1c. Conceptually, when given
in combination, one AHA would lower
HbA1c more rapidly than the other due
to the differential time to onset of
action for each drug, thereby resulting
in a smaller “effective baseline HbA1c”
for the second AHA. Thus, the second
AHA would thenhavea smallerincremen-
tal reduction in HbA1c compared with its
use in monotherapy, given the lower
starting HbA1c. An alternative explanation
for the subadditive HbA1c lowering ob-
served in the CANA/MET combination
arms may be related to the mechanism
of action of the individual components.

 controlin patientswith type2 diabetes, in
part, by decreasing EGP (37). In contrast,
dapagliflozin and empagliflozin have both
been associated with an increase in EGP
that has been attributed to increased
plasma glucagon levels (38,39). There-
fore, the effects of SGLT2 inhibition on
EGP may partially counteract those of
MET, thereby resulting in decreased effi-
cacy for the combination. Nevertheless,
initial combination therapy with CANA
plus MET significantly improves glycemic
control compared with each component
in monotherapy.
Smaller differences in HbA1c were seen
between treatment arms containing
CANA100 and CANA300 in this study
compared with previous studies where
a dose response had been observed
(11–23). However, HbA1c lowering with
CANA has been observed to be less
dose-dependent as baseline HbA1c in-
creases(40).Thesmallobserveddifference
in HbA1c lowering between CANA100 and
CANA300 in this study is consistent with
expectations of a proportionally smaller
between-dose difference in UGE as base-
line plasma glucose increases. Because the
renal threshold for glucose lowering is
greater with the higher dose of CANA, a
patient whose plasma glucose is, for exam-
ple, 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) would be
expected to have 25% more overnight
UGE with CANA300 versus CANA100;
however, a patient whose plasma glucose
is, for example, 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L)
would only be expected to have 10% more
UGE with CANA300 (Janssen Research &
Development, LLC, unpublished observa-
tion). Interestingly, a dose response was
seen for the proportion of patients
achieving an HbA1c ,7.0% (,53 mmol/
mol) in the CANA/MET and CANA-alone
arms, which is also clinically meaningful
because it was associated with weight
loss and no increased risk of hypoglyce-
mia, and it is highly relevant for patients
and clinicians because such improved
glycemic control has been associated
with a decreased risk of diabetes-related
complications (3,4).
In addition to glycemic improvements,
weight loss was seen across groups; how-
ever, differences in body weight in the
CANA groups versus MET were smaller
than anticipated, likely due to the large
response with MET. CANA100/MET and
CANA300/MET were associated with
modest increases in HDL-C and triglyc-
erides. Increases in LDL-C with both
combinations were similar to those
seen with MET monotherapy.
Both CANA/MET combinations were
generally well tolerated compared with
theirrespectivemonotherapies,consistent
with the observed low rate of discontinu-
ationsinthestudy.Theoverallincidenceof
AEs was lower across groups in this study
compared with previous studies (11–23);
the reason for this observation, which has
been seen with other AHAs (41,42), is not
known but may be related to the charac-
teristics of the study population. The pat-
tern of specific AEs observed with CANA in
this study was consistent with previous re-
ports (11–23), with a higher incidence of
AEs related to the mechanism of SGLT2
inhibition (e.g., genital mycotic infections,
volume depletion–related AEs, osmotic di-
uresis–related AEs) observed in all CANA
treatment arms versus MET. No differ-
ences in gastrointestinal-related AEs
were observed with combination therapy
compared with MET monotherapy. No
new safety signals were observed from
the coadministration of CANA and MET
compared with the monotherapies.
This study demonstrates that drug-
na¨
ıve patients with type 2 diabetes re-
spond well to treatment with an initial
combination of CANA plus MET. A study
of longer duration may be beneficial to
assess the potential long-term impact of
combination therapy with CANA/MET
on patient outcomes.
In summary, CANA100 and CANA300 in
combination with MET provided signifi-
cantly greater reductions in HbA1c and
body weight compared with monotherapy
with MET, CANA100, or CANA300, with
a tolerability profile consistent with
the respective monotherapies. In addition,
CANA100 and CANA300 monotherapy
provided comparable HbA1c reductions
and greater weight loss compared with
MET monotherapy. Overall, these findings
support the efficacy and safety of initial
combination therapy with CANA100 or
CANA300 and MET in drug-na¨
ıve patients
with type 2 diabetes, particularly for
patients with baseline HbA1c .8.5%
(.69 mmol/mol), and suggest that CANA
may also be used as an alternative to MET
in this population.
