Abstract
Background: Dental amalgam is composed of approximately 50% elemental mercury. Despite concerns over the
toxicity of mercury, amalgam is still the most widely used restorative material. Wi-Fi is a rapidly using local area
wireless computer networking technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the
effect of exposure to Wi-Fi signals on mercury release from amalgam restorations.
Methods: Standard class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surfaces of 20 non-carious extracted human
premolars. The teeth were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 10). The control group was stored in non-
environment. The specimens in the experimental groups were exposed to a radiofrequency radiation emitted from
standard Wi Fi devices at 2.4 GHz for 20 min. The distance between the Wi-Fi router and samples was 30 cm and
the router was exchanging data with a laptop computer that was placed 20 m away from the router.
The concentration of mercury in the artificial saliva in the groups was evaluated by using a cold-vapor atomic
absorption Mercury Analyzer System. The independent t test was used to evaluate any significant differences in
mercury release between the two groups.
Results: The mean (±SD) concentration of mercury in the artificial saliva of the Wi-Fi exposed teeth samples was 0.
056 ± .025 mg/L, while it was only 0.026 ± .008 mg/L in the non-exposed control samples. This difference was
statistically significant (P =0.009).
Conclusion: Exposure of patients with amalgam restorations to radiofrequency radiation emitted from
conventional Wi-Fi devices can increase mercury release from amalgam restorations.

Background
Dental amalgam is still the most widely used restorative
material in the last 150 years especially in posterior teeth
because of its high mechanical strength, durability, ease
of manipulation, and low cost [1–5]. Dental amalgam is
an alloy comprised of 50 % elemental mercury and a
mixture of other metals such as silver, tin, copper, and
sometimes palladium, indium and zinc [6–8]. Dental
amalgam is considered as the primary source of continu-
ous mercury exposure in general population [1, 9–11].
Mercury is a toxic element which can damage various
organs such as central nervous system, renal, respiratory
and hematologic systems [12, 13]. Because of the mer-
cury toxicity, the use of mercury has been banned in
some European countries [14]. The amount of mercury
which releases from amalgam restorations depends on
several factors such as number and size of the fillings,
composition of amalgam, any other factors that causes
load over the restorations like tooth brushing, chewing
habits,and bruxism [8, 15].
Wi-Fi is a local area wireless computer networking
technology and has been used drastically in houses and
public places such as schools and hospitals during recent

 years [16]. It allows electronic devices such as personal
computers, video-game consoles, smart phones, digital
cameras and tablet computers to network using Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11
standards. These standards mainly use the 2.5 gigahertz
(12 cm) UHF and 5 gigahertz (6 cm) SHF ISM radio
bands [17]. The lower cost and easier deployment of
these devices than wired computer networks lead to rap-
idly increase of Wi-Fi devices [18]. However, this also
raised great public concern about the potential adverse
effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs)
emitted from these devices [19].
The adverse health impacts associated to exposure to
some common sources of electromagnetic fields includ-
ing laptop computers, mobile phones, MRI and mobile
phone jammers have been evaluated by our laboratory in
our previous investigations [20–24]. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the effect
of exposure to Wi-Fi signals on mercury release from
amalgam restorations.
Methods
Teeth samples
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Twenty non-
carious premolar teeth which were extracted as a part of
orthodontic treatment were used in this study. The teeth
were stored in isotonic saline solution for not longer
than 3 months after surface debridement. The teeth
were randomly divided into 2 groups of exposure and
control, each containing 10 teeth.
Amalgam fillings
Standard class V cavities (3mm length, 2mm depth and
5 mm width) were prepared on the buccal surface using
carbide burs (SS White Burs, Lakewood, NJ) and a high
speed turbine under water spray. The cavities were
restored with Cinalux (non-gama-2, spherical amalgam,
Faghihi Dental, Tehran, Iran) amalgam. The amalgams
were triturated according to manufacturers’ directions,
and then they were condensed incrementally towards
the cavity walls. All the procedures for restoration of the
cavities were performed by the same clinician. The re-
stored teeth were plunged in saline solution at 37° C for
14 days because as it was discussed by Muller Miny et
al., the mercury release from amalgam restorations de-
crease gradually to a constant level 14 days after the fill-
ing [25]. Following that and before exposing the teeth,
samples were poured into plastic tubes filled with artifi-
cial saliva. The thickness of the artificial saliva covered
over teeth samples was 1.5 cm to mimic soft tissue.
Wi-Fi exposure
The exposure group was exposed to radiofrequency
radiation emitted from standard Wi-Fi devices at 2.4
GHz for 20 min. The distance between the Wi-Fi router
(D-Link, China) and samples was 30 cm and the router
was exchanging data with a laptop computer that was
placed 20 m away from the router. The control group
was kept outside the experiment room. The geometry
used for exposure is shown in Fig. 1.
Mercury measurement
Based on our previous experiments, it was clearly re-
vealed that the pre-exposure mercury concentration in
the saliva containing teeth samples with exactly identical
fillings (the same cavities and amalgam type), was the
same for all samples (the differences were not statisti-
cally significant). Therfore, the mercury levels were mea-
sured in the artificial saliva after exposure by cold vapor
atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS; Analytical
Jena, vario 6, Germany).

 Statistical analysis
The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS version
16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) (http://www-01.ibm.com/
software/analytics/ spss). The independent t test was
used to compare the level of mercury release in the ex-
posure and control groups to identify any statistically
significant differences. P value <0.05 was considered
significant.
Results
Descriptive statistics were presented as the mean, stand-
ard deviation, minimum and maximum in Table 1. The
mean (±SD) concentration of mercury in the artificial
saliva of the Wi-Fi exposed group was 0.056 ± .025 mg/
L, while it was only 0.026 ± .008 mg/L in the non-
exposed control samples. Therefore, the mean concen-
tration of mercury in the Wi-Fi group was about twice
of the control group. The observed difference in the
concentration of mercury in the artificial saliva of the
exposure and control group was statistically significant
(P =0.009).
Discussion
Public concern about the possible adverse health effects
of using Wi-Fi technology is increasing because of the
widespread use of wireless communication systems [19].
In the present study, it was concluded that radiofrequency
radiation emitted from Wi-Fi devices significantly in-
creased mercury release from amalgam restorations.
Mortazavi and Mortazavi have recently reviewed the
published reports on the increased release of mercury
from dental amalgam fillings after exposure to different
sources of electromagnetic fields (e.g. MRI, mobile
phones) [26]. These studies are summarized in Table 2.
The first report on the role of exposure to MRI or
microwave radiation emitted by mobile phones in in-
creasing the release of mercury from dental amalgam
filling was published by Mortazavi et al. in 2008 [27]. To
overcome the limitations of their previous study, Morta-
zavi and his colleagues have recently studied the effects
of stronger magnetic fields (1.5 T in their recent study
vs. 0.25 T in their previous report). This study confirmed
the previous findings and provided further support for
increased release of mercury from dental amalgam fill-
ings after MR imaging [28].
It should be noted that the results obtained in the
studies
performed
on
the
role
of
exposure
to
electromagnetic fields in magnetic resonance imaging on
the microleakage of amalgam are strongly in line with
the findings of Mortazavi et al. [29, 30]. To the best of
our knowledge, our current study is the first study that
investigates the effect of radiofrequency radiation emit-
ted by Wi-Fi routers on mercury release from amalgam
restorations.
Mercury is a toxic element which has adverse bio-
logical effects even at low doses [31]. Therefore, it seems
to be necessary to apply a sensitive and reliable analyt-
ical technique to determine mercury content. Various
analytical techniques has been used previously for the
determination of mercury in environmental and bio-
logical samples such as cold vapor atomic absorption
spectrometry (CVAAS), cold vapor fluorescence spec-
trometry (CVAFS), inductively coupled plasma optical
emission spectrometry (ICP OES), electrothermal atomic
absorption spectrometry (ET AAS), neutron activation
analysis, mass spectrometry, anodic stripping voltamme-
try, and cold vapor inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry
(CV
ICP-MS)
[32–35].
This
study
employed CVAAS method for measuring mercury re-
leased from dental amalgam. Because CVAAS is the
most widely technique used in previous studies for
detecting this element at low concentrations due to
its high sensitivity and selectivity and because of its
low cost [36, 37].
To improve the outcome of the west possible mercury
release, we did not polish the cavities after restoration,
because according to Ferracane et al. greater amounts of
mercury would release from unpolished than polished
surfaces [38].
Although the adverse health effects of the exposure
to radiofrequency radiation emitted by Wi-Fi routers
on some challenging phenomena such as human re-
productive capabilities is well documented by some
researchers around the world [39, 40], as far as we
know, there is no report on the role of Wi-Fi radi-
ation on the release of mercury from amalgam resto-
rations. The mercury release from dental amalgam
into saliva has been evaluated in previous studies
both in vitro and in vivo conditions [25, 31, 41–43].
One of the limitation of in vivo studies, as Mortazavi
et al. discussed in their study, was that the partici-
pants were referred by their own physicians and the
investigators did not have control over the number
and surface of amalgam fillings [41]. However, in our
in vitro study, we could control these factors by using
identical class V fillings with the same dimensions
through application of a template during cavity prepa-
rations since the mercury exposure correlates signifi-
cantly to the number and surface of fillings [8, 15].
We also could control some other confounding fac-
tors which differ inter individually such as chewing

hand some factors that may decrease the mercury re-
lease such as the liberation of corrosive products by
contact of food and bacteria did not also interference
with our findings.
Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
which assesses the effect of exposure to Wi-Fi sig-
nals on mercury release from amalgam restorations.
We speculated that exposure to radiofrequency emit-
ted from Wi-Fi devices may result in mercury re-
lease from amalgam restorations. Further in vitro
and
in

studies
are
necessary
to
prove

contention.
