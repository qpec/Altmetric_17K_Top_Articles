Summary
Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption alters the composition of the brain microenvironment by 
allowing blood proteins into the CNS. However, whether blood-derived molecules serve as 
extrinsic inhibitors of remyelination is unknown. Here we show that the coagulation factor 
fibrinogen activates the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway in oligodendrocyte 
progenitor cells (OPCs) and suppresses remyelination. Fibrinogen induces phosphorylation of 
Smad 1/5/8 and inhibits OPC differentiation into myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs), while 
promoting an astrocytic fate in vitro. Fibrinogen effects are rescued by BMP type I receptor 
inhibition using dorsomorphin homologue 1 (DMH1) or CRISPR/Cas9 activin A receptor type I 
(ACVR1) knockout in OPCs. Fibrinogen and the BMP target Id2 are increased in demyelinated 
multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. Therapeutic depletion of fibrinogen decreases BMP signaling and 
enhances remyelination in vivo. Targeting fibrinogen may be an upstream therapeutic strategy to 
promote the regenerative potential of CNS progenitors in diseases with remyelination failure.

Extrinsic inhibitors contribute to remyelination failure in neurological diseases. Petersen et al. 
identify the blood coagulation factor fibrinogen as an activator of BMP receptor signaling in 
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells that can be targeted therapeutically to promote remyelination.
Introduction
Remyelination is critical for recovery in several diseases, such as MS, neonatal white matter 
injury (NWMI) and stroke (Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008; Rosenzweig and 
Carmichael, 2015). In these conditions, OPCs often fail to differentiate into mature OLs 
required for myelin repair (Fancy et al., 2011a). However, molecules in the lesion 
environment that activate pathways in OPCs to inhibit their differentiation are not fully 
known (Gallo and Deneen, 2014). OPCs are closely associated with the perivascular niche, 
which is altered when increased BBB permeability allows blood proteins into the CNS (Tsai 
et al., 2016; Zlokovic, 2008). The contribution of blood-derived signals to OPC dysfunction 
is unknown. Without treatments to promote remyelination, identifying upstream blood-

 derived signals that dysregulate the progenitor niche may open novel therapeutic strategies 
for remyelination.
Fibrinogen, a blood coagulation protein, is deposited in many CNS diseases with BBB 
disruption and myelin abnormalities, including MS, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and 
Alzheimer's disease (Bardehle et al., 2015; Davalos et al., 2012). Fibrinogen is found in the 
progressive MS cortex and in active and chronic MS lesions (Vos et al., 2005; Yates et al., 
2017). BBB disruption and fibrinogen deposition occur early in MS and precede 
demyelination (Marik et al., 2007). Progressive MS cases with severe cortical fibrinogen 
deposition have perturbed fibrinolysis and reduced neuronal density (Yates et al., 2017). 
Fibrinogen is not just a marker of BBB disruption, but a driver of neuropathology (Bardehle 
et al., 2015). It promotes neuroinflammation and glial scar formation by direct effects on 
microglia, astrocytes, and neurons (Adams et al., 2007; Davalos et al., 2012; Schachtrup et 
al., 2010). Since fibrinogen regulates functions of CNS cells and is found in MS lesions, we 
hypothesized that fibrinogen triggers inhibitory signaling to control differentiation of OPCs 
and remyelination.
Results
Fibrinogen Inhibits OPC Differentiation and Myelination
To test effects of fibrinogen on myelination, we treated primary cultures of rat cortical OPCs 
with fibrinogen. Fibrinogen inhibited OPC differentiation into mature OLs shown by 
decreased myelin basic protein (MBP)+ OLs and MBP gene and protein expression (Figure 
1A,B). Fibrinogen did not affect OPC apoptosis or proliferation (Figure S1A-C). In OPC/
dorsal root ganglion (DRG) myelinating co-cultures, fibrinogen inhibited axonal 
myelination, reducing mature, myelinating OLs by 60% (Figure 1C). Although some 
fibrinogen-treated OPCs differentiated to MBP+ OLs, many did not form myelin sheaths, 
suggesting impaired axonal wrapping (Figure 1C, arrows). In a neuron-free, nanofiber 
myelinating culture system (Lee et al., 2012), fibrinogen-coated nanofibers inhibited OPC 
differentiation and myelination compared to control poly(L-lysine)-coated or albumin-
coated nanofibers (Figure 1D, S1D-F). In fibrinogen-coated nanofiber cultures, the few 
OPCs that matured to MBP+ cells had a marked deficit in wrapping nanofibers and formed 
large membrane sheets rather than myelin-like segments (Figure 1D). Fibrinogen is a potent 
activator of microglia and macrophages (Adams et al., 2007; Ryu et al., 2015). OPCs treated 
with conditioned media from fibrin-primed macrophages reduced differentiation to MBP+ 
cells (Figure S1G), suggesting that fibrinogen exerts immune-mediated and cell-autonomous 
inhibition of OPC differentiation (Figure 1A-D). In human MS lesions and NWMI, OPCs 
expressing the high activity Wnt marker RNF43 (Fancy et al., 2014) were associated with 
leaky blood vessels and fibrinogen deposits (Figure 1E).
To determine the mechanism mediating fibrinogen's inhibitory effect on OPC differentiation, 
we used whole-genome microarray of fibrinogen-treated OPCs. Gene ontology (GO) 
analysis revealed that fibrinogen upregulates the BMP pathway, a major suppressor of OPC 
differentiation (Gallo and Deneen, 2014) (Figure 1F, Table S1). Fibrinogen increased 
expression of several BMP-responsive genes (e.g., Id1, Id2, Nog, Hes1, Hey1, and Lef1) 
(Figure 1F) that are associated with impaired OPC differentiation and upregulated in some

 MS patients (Pedre et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2012). We evaluated brain autopsy samples of 
patients with different types of MS lesions by immunostaining for fibrinogen with MBP or 
the BMP target Id2. We compared active lesions, characterized by florid parenchymal 
inflammation and ongoing demyelination, chronic lesions of demyelinated areas with absent 
or few inflammatory cells, and remyelinated lesions (Absinta et al., 2016; Han et al., 2008). 
Active lesions had high levels of Id2 in areas of fibrinogen deposition and demyelination 
(Figure 2A-C). Perivascular fibrinogen was seen in chronic MS lesions but was minimal in 
remyelinated lesions and absent in normal white matter (Figure 2A,B). Id2 expression was 
reduced in the chronic lesions and similar to controls in remyelinated lesions (Figure 2A,B). 
These results suggest that fibrinogen may increase BMP signaling at sites of increased BBB 
permeability.
Fibrinogen Activates BMP Receptor Signaling in OPCs
In cultured rat OPCs, fibrinogen increased phosphorylation of the BMP signal transducers 
Smad1/5 and induced Id1-3 expression (Figure 2D,E), indicating activation of BMP 
downstream signaling. DMH1, a dorsomorphin analogue that inhibits the BMP type I 
receptor ACVR1 (Alk2) (Hao et al., 2010), blocked fibrinogen-induced phosphorylation of 
Smad1/5 and suppressed the Id genes (Figure 2D,E). Fibrinogen induced RNA and protein 
expression of LEF1 (Figure 2F,G), which is regulated by ACVR1 and associated with 
arrested OPC maturation (Choe et al., 2013; Fancy et al., 2014). DMH1 blocked fibrinogen-
induced LEF1 expression and increased MBP expression (Figure 2F,G), indicating that 
fibrinogen activates ACVR1 signal transduction to inhibit myelin production.
A striking effect of BMP signaling in OPCs is differentiation to GFAP+ astrocyte-like cells 
instead of mature OLs in vitro (Mabie et al., 1997). Similarly, fibrinogen increased GFAP+ 
cells in OPC cultures (Figure 2H). To test whether GFAP+ cells in fibrinogen-treated 
cultures derived from OPCs, we traced the cell-fate of OPCs from NG2-CreER™:Rosa-
tdTomato mice, allowing tamoxifen-induced expression of a red fluorescent protein, 
tdTomato, in nerve/glial antigen-2 (NG2)+ OPCs and their progeny (Figure S2A). 
Fibrinogen reduced formation of mature MBP+ OLs from genetically labeled NG2+ OPCs 
and increased the proportion of GFAP+ cells in culture (Figure S2B). Chronic infusion of 
fibrinogen into brains of NG2-CreER™:Rosa-tdTomato mice increased the percentage of 
tdTomato+ cells expressing GFAP (Figure S2C), suggesting fibrinogen induces the same 
BMP-like effect in vivo.
Fibrinogen Disrupts OPC Differentiation by Activating ACVR1
Noggin, a secreted BMP inhibitor, is a key homeostatic regulator of BMP that binds to 
extracellular BMPs to antagonize receptor binding (Groppe et al., 2002). Noggin rescued 
OPCs from the inhibitory effects of BMPs in vitro, but failed to block fibrinogen (Figure 3A, 
B). By ELISA, fibrinogen had no free BMP-2, -4, or -7 (not shown). Unlike noggin, DMH1 
blocks BMP signaling by antagonizing the intracellular kinase domain of ACVR1 (Hao et 
al., 2010). DMH1 rescued OPCs from the inhibitory effects of BMP-7, an ACVR1 ligand, 
but not BMP-4, which does not act through ACVR1, showing the selectivity of DMH1 for 
ACVR1 (Figure 3A). In fibrinogen-treated OPCs, DMH1 increased the number of mature 
OLs, decreased the GFAP+ cells, and suppressed fibrinogen-induced Id1 gene expression

 (Figure 3A,B). Knockout of ACVR1 in primary OPCs by CRISPR/Cas9 reduced fibrinogen-
induced nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated Smad1/5 and Id1 expression and enhanced 
formation of mature MBP+ OLs after fibrinogen treatment (Figure 3C, S3A-C). In the 
HAP1 human cell line, ACVR1 CRISPR/Cas9 knockout suppressed fibrinogen-induced Id1 
(Figure S3D). Lipid rafts regulate BMP receptor signaling and progenitor cell differentiation 
(North et al., 2015). Pre-treating OPCs with the lipid raft disrupting methyl-β-cyclodextrin 
reduced fibrinogen-induced phospho-Smad1/5 levels by ∼45% (Figure S3E), suggesting 
fibrinogen enhances ACVR1 receptor association in lipid rafts to activate BMP signaling. 
These results suggest fibrinogen overcomes the endogenous homeostatic mechanisms that 
scavenge free BMPs and inhibits myelination by BMP ligand-independent activation of 
ACVR1.
Therapeutically Depleting Fibrinogen Increases Remyelination in Vivo
To assess OPC differentiation and remyelination in vivo, we used the lysolecithin (LPC) 
focal demyelination model (Fancy et al., 2014). Fibrinogen was deposited in LPC lesions, 
suggesting BBB disruption (Figure 4A), that was cleared by 10–14 days post lesion (d.p.l.), 
when remyelination begins (Figure 4A). To therapeutically deplete fibrinogen in the LPC 
model, we administered the defibrinogenating agent ancrod at 3 d.p.l. (Adams et al., 2007). 
Fibrinogen depletion reduced phospho-Smad1/5/8 in demyelinated lesions (Figure 4B), 
suggesting reduction of BMP receptor pathway activation. Fibrinogen-depleted mice had 
more mature PLP-expressing OLs within LPC lesions (Figure 4C) and enhanced 
remyelination (Figure 4D), as indicated by a reduced proportion of axons that remained 
demyelinated and a decreased G-ratio of remyelinated axons that indicates thicker myelin. 
Ancrod alone did not affect OPC differentiation in vitro (Figure S4F), suggesting the pro-
myelinating effect of ancrod is due to fibrinogen depletion.
Discussion
We found that fibrinogen is a potent extrinsic inhibitor of OPC differentiation and 
remyelination. Fibrinogen activates the ACVR1 receptor on OPCs to induce downstream 
signaling and BMP target gene expression and inhibit remyelination (Figure 4E). Fibrinogen 
may be beneficial in acute CNS injuries by acting as a “damage signal” that delays 
regeneration until the extracellular environment is conducive to repair. But, in chronic 
diseases with excessive fibrinogen deposition or inadequate fibrinogen clearance, this 
mechanism may be deleterious and lead to a state akin to a non-healing wound with aberrant 
activation of signaling pathways that block regeneration. Indeed, persistent fibrin deposition 
inhibits wound repair and is a feature of MS lesions with impaired fibrinolysis (Bugge et al., 
1996; Gveric et al., 2003; Yates et al., 2017). Endogenous homeostatic mechanisms that 
scavenge free BMPs do not block fibrinogen's inhibitory effects. Thus, targeting fibrinogen 
therapeutically may tip the balance from a dysregulated environment to one that promotes 
repair.
Fibrinogen may contribute to a hostile environment in demyelinating diseases by activating 
BMP receptor signaling in OPCs (this study) and as an upstream driver of inflammation and 
reactive gliosis (Bardehle et al., 2015). At sites of BBB disruption, fibrinogen is converted to

 proinflammatory fibrin, which induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) release and M1-like 
activation of microglia and macrophages (Davalos et al., 2012; Ryu et al., 2015). M1-like 
polarization of innate immune cells and ROS are toxic to OPCs and hinder remyelination 
(Back et al., 1998; Lehnardt et al., 2002). A switch from an M1- to an M2-dominant 
response is essential for remyelination (Miron et al., 2013). Conditioned media from fibrin-
treated macrophages hindered OPC differentiation. Fibrin-induced M1-like polarization of 
microglia and macrophages (Davalos et al., 2012; Ryu et al., 2015) may hinder the 
reparative inflammatory response for remyelination, which would agree with failed repair of 
MS lesions where BBB leakage at the lesion edge is prolonged (Absinta et al., 2016). 
Fibrinogen depletion with ancrod decreases inflammation and demyelination in animal MS 
models (Adams et al., 2007; Akassoglou et al., 2004; Paterson, 1976; Ryu et al., 2015). In 
the LPC model, active demyelination occurs at 1–3 d.p.l., and initial recruitment and 
activation of inflammatory cells at 12 h–3 d.p.l. (Mei et al., 2014; Ousman and David, 
2000). In our study, ancrod was administered therapeutically starting at 3 d.p.l. to avoid 
interference with the initial demyelination and inflammation. Ancrod decreased BMP 
pathway activation and increased synthesis of myelin genes, but we cannot exclude ancrod 
effects in fibrin-driven inflammation and demyelination after 3 d.p.l. Future studies will 
determine the relative contributions of direct effects of fibrinogen on OPCs and its indirect 
effects mediated by inflammation in inhibiting CNS remyelination.
Given their pleiotropic functions, fibrinogen and fibrin may affect multiple pathological 
mechanisms that alter repair. Fibrinogen inhibits Schwann cell differentiation and inhibits 
neurite outgrowth (Akassoglou et al., 2002; Schachtrup et al., 2007). Fibrinogen induces 
production of other extrinsic remyelination inhibitors like chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans 
(CSPGs) in astrocytes and endothelin-1 in endothelial cells (Schachtrup et al., 2010; Sen et 
al., 2009). Thus, fibrinogen may be an apical signal that orchestrates the molecular 
composition of the inhibitory extracellular environment. An effect of fibrinogen in OPCs 
consistent with activation of BMP signaling was formation of GFAP+, astrocyte-like cells. 
OPC multipotency in vivo and potential lineage switches in disease are controversial 
(Richardson et al., 2011). Future studies will determine the expression of BMP activation 
markers in OPCs and astrocytes in acute and chronic MS lesions. In acute animal models of 
demyelination, such as LPC, the switch of OPCs to astrocytes is a rare event (∼3%) 
(Zawadzka et al., 2010); thus, fibrinogen's inhibitory effect on remyelination in the LPC 
model is more likely related to inhibiting final OL maturation. Since the LPC model has no 
permanent remyelination blockade, fibrinogen depletion likely accelerates remyelination. It 
is possible that fibrinogen-induced BMP signaling drives cell fate decisions in other models 
with large or more hemorrhagic insults. Indeed, fate-mapping studies after spinal cord injury 
show that ∼25% of NG2 cells mature into astrocytes (Hackett et al., 2016). Thus, in large 
traumatic injuries, OPC differentiation to GFAP+ cells may be more pronounced than in 
acute LPC injection. Fibrinogen is abundantly deposited in the spinal cord after injury 
(Schachtrup et al., 2007), and chronic fibrinogen infusion is sufficient to increase the 
number of NG2-derived GFAP+ cells in vivo (this study). Future studies will determine if 
fibrinogen is required for the generation of astrocyte-like cells by OPCs and stem/progenitor 
cell fate determination at sites of vascular damage in animal models with chronic insults.

 Our study suggests targeting fibrinogen may overcome the inhibitory environment that 
persists in chronically demyelinated lesions. Although screens of FDA-approved drugs 
identified those that promote myelination (Mei et al., 2014; Najm et al., 2015), it is unknown 
if these drugs will overcome inhibition by extrinsic factors in the demyelinated lesions. OPC 
differentiation drugs failed to rescue inhibition of remyelination by extracellular CSPGs 
(Keough et al., 2016), suggesting a need for new approaches to target extrinsic inhibition of 
remyelination. With the many functions of fibrinogen as an OPC differentiation inhibitor 
with pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic functions, anti-coagulant therapies that inhibit fibrin 
formation or inhibition of fibrinogen binding to immune cell receptors or growth factors 
might be beneficial for tissue repair. Counteracting inhibitory BMP signaling in OPCs by 
BMP receptor inhibitors like DMH-1 (our study) or pro-myelinating ligands like activin B 
(Dutta et al., 2014) may alleviate the inhibitory effects of fibrinogen on remyelination. Novel 
inhibitors may overcome the hostile, dysregulated environment that persists in chronically 
demyelinated lesions and open new therapeutic strategies to promote regeneration in 
neurological diseases with fibrin deposition.

Experimental Model and Subject Details
Animals—Sprague-Dawley timed-pregnant females or females with litters were purchased 
from Simonsen Laboratories or Charles River. E15 and P1–P7 rats of both sexes were used 
for DRG and OPC isolations, respectively. C57BL/6, NG2-CreER™ (Zhu et al., 2011), and 
Rosa-tdTomato (Madisen et al., 2010) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. 
Heterozygous, male and female NG2-CreER™:Rosa-tdTomato P7 mice were used for in 
vitro OPC fate-mapping studies and 8–12-week-old mice for in vivo fate-mapping. All LPC 
experiments were performed on 8–12-week-old male C57BL/6 mice. Mice were housed in 
groups of five per cage under standard vivarium conditions and a 12-h light/dark cycle. All 
animal protocols were approved by the Committee of Animal Research at the University of 
California, San Francisco, and in accord with the National Institutes of Health guidelines.
Primary OPC cultures—Rat cortical OPCs were isolated with immunopanning as 
previously described (Dugas and Emery, 2013) with the following modifications. Cerebral 
cortices from P1-7 Sprague-Dawley rats were dissected and then digested in papain 
(Worthington) in DPBS at 35°C for 30-45 minutes. After trituration, cells were incubated 
sequentially on three immunopanning dishes: RAN-2 (negative selection), O1 (negative 
selection), and O4 (positive selection). OPCs were released from the final panning dish with 
trypsin (Worthington) and seeded onto polyethyleneimine (Sigma-Aldrich)-coated tissue-
culture plates or 8-well Permanox-chamber slides (Thermo Scientific Nunc) at an initial 
density of approximately 15,000 cells per cm2. OPCs were maintained in a 5% CO2 
incubator at 37°C, first in proliferation media for 2 days, then in differentiation media for up 
to 4 additional days with a 50% media change after 2 days. The chemically defined base

 media was DMEM (4.5g/L glucose, +pyruvate, +glutamine; Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1× 
B27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1× N2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% penicillin-
streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 50 ng ml−1 NT3 (Peprotech). Proliferation 
media consisted of the base media supplemented with 10-20 ng ml−1 PDGF-AA 
(Peprotech). Differentiation media contained 20 ng ml−1 CNTF (Peprotech) and 40 ng ml−1 
triiodothyronine (Sigma-Aldrich) with no PDGF-AA. Experiments were performed after the 
initial 2 days of proliferation.
OPC-DRG cultures—OPC-DRG co-cultures were prepared as previously described (Lee 
et al., 2012). Briefly, DRG neurons from E15 Sprague-Dawley rats were dissociated and 
plated (150,000 cells per collagen-coated 25-mm coverslip) with 100 ng ml–1 NGF (AbD 
Serotec). Neurons were maintained in MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 
10% FBS (Hyclone) and 25 mM glucose. Proliferating cells were selected against with three 
treatments of 2 mM FDU/Uridine (Sigma-Aldrich). Neurons were maintained for 3 weeks 
and washed extensively with DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to remove any residual 
NGF before seeding OPCs. A2B5+ OPCs were isolated from P7-8 Sprague-Dawley rat brain 
cortices using immunopanning, and 250,000 cells were plated onto each DRG cover glass. 
Co-cultures were grown in chemically defined medium composed of DMEM (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) supplemented with B27 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), N2 (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific), penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), N-acetyl-cysteine (Sigma-
Aldrich), and forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich).
OPC-nanofiber cultures—OPC-nanofiber cultures were prepared as previously 
described (Lee et al., 2012). Briefly, electron-spun polystyrene fibers (J. M. Corey, Univ. of 
Michigan) were aligned and secured to 12-mm coverslips with silicone adhesive (Dow 
Corning), sterilized with 70% ethanol, and coated with 100 μg ml−1 poly(L-lysine). 
Immunopanned O4+ OPCs (200,000 cells per coverslip) were plated onto the coated fibers 
and maintained in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with B27 (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific), N2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific), N-acetyl-cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich), and forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich). For the first 
2-3 days in vitro, the media was supplemented with 12.5 ng ml−1 PDGF-AA (Peprotech) to 
induce proliferation. Thereafter, the media was without PDGF-AA to promote OPC 
differentiation and myelination.
Macrophage conditioned media—Bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) were 
isolated from tibia and femur of adult Sprague-Dawley rats as described (Ryu et al., 2015). 
Bone-marrow cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated FBS 
(Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Corning), and 10 ng/ml rat M-CSF (Peprotech) for 
7 d in vitro before use. On day 7, adherent BMDMs were dissociated from the plate and re-
plated on uncoated or fibrin-coated 24 wells in OPC culture medium. Fibrin coating was 
prepared as previously described (Ryu et al., 2015). After 24 hours of stimulation, 
macrophage-conditioned media was collected, clarified by centrifugation, and added to OPC 
cultures.

 HAP1 cell cultures—HAP1 cells edited by CRISPR/Cas to contain a 2bp insertion in a 
coding exon of ACVR1 (HZGHC000195c001) and parental HAP1 control cells (C631) were 
purchased from Horizon (Cambridge, UK) and cultured in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's 
Medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin according to 
manufacturer's instructions. Cells were serum-starved for 5 hours prior to fibrinogen 
stimulation.
Human MS and neonatal HIE tissue—All human tissue was collected after informed 
consent and after institutional approval. Brain autopsy samples were collected from patients 
with different clinical subtypes of MS (Absinta et al., 2016; Fancy et al., 2014; Fancy et al., 
2011b; Han et al., 2008). Lesions with florid parenchymal and perivascular inflammatory 
cell infiltration, abundant astroglial hypertrophy, myelin fragmentation, edema and ongoing 
demyelination with indistinct margins were classified as active lesions (Han et al., 2008). 
Chronic lesions had areas of demyelination with well-demarcated borders and abundant 
astrogliosis, but few or no inflammatory cells (Han et al., 2008). Remyelinated lesions were 
defined as discrete focal areas of pale Luxol fast blue staining but near-normal PLP/myelin 
immunostaining, with few or no inflammatory cells (Patrikios et al., 2006). Age-matched 
control brain samples were analysed similarly and were devoid of CNS abnormalities. 
Human HIE tissue was collected after informed consent and in accordance with guidelines 
established by the UCSF Committee on Human Research (H11170-19113-07), as previously 
described (Fancy et al., 2011b). Tissue was processed and evaluated by UCSF 
neuropathology staff as described (Fancy et al., 2014).
Method Details
Fibrinogen and pharmacologic inhibitors—Fibrinogen (EMD Millipore) was used at 
2.5 mg ml−1, which is its physiological concentration in plasma (Davalos and Akassoglou, 
2012). For signaling experiments, OPCs were factor-starved for 6–15 h before experimental 
treatments. For analysis of differentiation, OPCs were treated with 2.5 mg ml−1 fibrinogen, 
50 ng ml−1 BMP4 (Peprotech), or 50 ng ml−1 BMP7 (Peprotech) when changed to 
differentiation media. For inhibitor studies, OPCs were pre-treated with 1 μM DMH1 
(Tocris), 500–1000 ng ml−1 recombinant human noggin (Peprotech), or vehicle (control) 1 h 
before treatments. In noggin experiments, the inhibitors were also incubated with the vehicle 
(control)-, fibrinogen-, or BMP-containing differentiation media at 37°C for 1 h before being 
added to the OPCs. Inhibitors were replaced with subsequent media changes.
Myelinating cultures—In OPC-DRG cultures, 2.5 mg ml−1 fibrinogen was added when 
OPCs were plated onto DRGs and with media changes every 3 days. In OPC-nanofiber 
cultures, poly(L-lysine)-coated fibers were additionally coated with fibrinogen 
(Calbiochem), albumin (A4161, Sigma-Aldrich), fibrinogen-Alexa Fluor 594 or 647 
conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), or albumin-Alexa Fluor 594 or 647 conjugate 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 50 μg ml−1 for 2 h at 37° before adding OPCs. Cultures were 
fixed and processed for immunostaining at 4–6 DIV for OPC-nanofibers and 7–9 DIV for 
OPC-DRGs.

 Cell fate mapping studies—For in vitro fate-mapping studies, mouse cortical OPCs 
were isolated from NG2-CreER™:Rosa-tdTomato mice by immunopanning as previously 
described (Emery and Dugas, 2013) with the exception that papain digestion occurred in 
DPBS at 35°C for 30-45 minutes. Cells were incubated sequentially on three 
immunopanning dishes: BSL1 × 2 (negative selection) and PDGFRα (positive selection). 
Mouse OPC proliferation and differentiation media has been described previously (Emery 
and Dugas, 2013). To induce Cre-mediated recombination, OPCs were treated with 1 μM 4-
hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich) in proliferation media for 48 hours. Cultures were then 
changed to control or fibrinogen-containing differentiation media and processed for 
immunostaining 3 days after the media change. For in vivo fate-mapping, 8- to 12-wk-old 
NG2-CreER™:Rosa-tdTomato mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg tamoxifen 
(Sigma-Aldrich) daily for four days. Experiments were performed 3-4 weeks after tamoxifen 
administration.
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Acvr1 in primary OPCs
Experimental overview: One to five days after initial isolation, primary rat OPCs were 
transfected with a Cas9 expression plasmid expressing EGFP and sgRNA for either LacZ 
(control) or Acvr1. To determine genome targeting efficiency, transfected OPCs underwent 
T7 endonuclease I assays three days after transfection. To determine changes in gene 
expression, cultures 2-4 days after transfection were fibrinogen-treated (2.5 mg ml−1 for 2 
hours) and then underwent FACS to select the transfected cells for RNA isolation and 
analysis. In some experiments, OPCs were sorted two days after transfection, re-plated into 
proliferation media and allowed to recover for two days before fibrinogen treatment and 
RNA isolation. To assess differentiation, OPCs were transfected at 5 DIV, underwent FACS 
two days after transfection, re-cultured for two days in proliferation media, and then 
fibrinogen-treated when changed to differentiation media. Cultures were fixed and processed 
for immunostaining after 3 days of differentiation.
Plasmids: The plasmid peSpCas9(1.1)(BB) encoding SpCas9 (with improved specificity) 
was a gift from Dr. Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 71814) (Slaymaker et al., 2016), 
peSpCas9(1.1)-fG(BB) was constructed by fusing the sequence encoding P2A-farnesylated 
EGFP to Cas9 in peSpCas9(1.1)(BB). pCMV-Cas9-fG(BB) was constructed by replacing the 
CBh promoter in peSpCas9(1.1)-fG(BB) with the CMV promoter. The annealed 
oligonucleotides for the sgRNA guide sequence were ligated to BbsI-digested 
peSpCas9(1.1)-fG(BB) or pCMV-Cas9-fG(BB). sgRNA guide sequences are listed in Table 
S2.
OPC transfection: Primary OPCs cultured in proliferation medium were transfected by 
adding the plasmid, Lipofectamine LTX and Plus reagent mixed in OPTI-MEM (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two μg of plasmids, 2 μl of 
Plus and 4μl of Lipofectamine LTX were used to transfect OPCs cultured on a 3.5-cm dish; 
double the amount was used for cells cultured on 6-cm dishes. After overnight incubation, 
the medium was replaced.

 T7 endonuclease I assays: Three days after transfection of cultured OPCs, the cells were 
lysed in lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 
0.1 mg/ml proteinase K) at 56°C for 1 hr. Genomic DNA was precipitated by adding double 
the volume of 100% ethanol and centrifuging at 16100 × g for 5 min at room temperature. 
After washing twice with 70% ethanol and drying, the DNA pellet was dissolved in TE 
buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0 and 1 mM EDTA) at 56°C for 10 min. The genome editing 
events were detected by using the EnGen Mutation Detection Kit (New England BioLabs) 
and 25-65 ng of genomic DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primer 
pairs used for PCR amplification of the edited loci are listed in Table S2.
FACS of transfected OPCs: Two and four days after transfection, cultured OPCs were 
rinsed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution without calcium and magnesium (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific), and then trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the 
incubator for 5 min. Cells were resuspended by pipetting and trypsinization was stopped by 
adding an equal volume of DPBS without calcium and magnesium (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) containing 0.25% ovomucoid (Worthington) and 0.25% bovine serum albumin 
(Sigma-Aldrich). After centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min, the cell pellet was resuspended 
in 0.4 ml of FACS buffer (DPBS without calcium and magnesium containing 1 × B-27, 1 × 
N-2, 2 mM EDTA, 5.56 mM glucose, and 25 mM HEPES-Na pH 7.0) and kept on ice. Cell 
suspension was filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer and EGFP+ cells (MFI cut-off 103) 
were sorted using the FACSAria II (BD Biosciences). EGFP+ cells were collected into 300 
μl FACS buffer at 4°C for RNA isolation, or in 300 μl proliferation medium containing 25 
mM HEPES-Na pH 7.0 at room temperature for re-culture experiments. For RNA isolation, 
sorted cell suspension was centrifuged for 8 minutes at 300 × g at 4°C and the cell pellet 
lysed in 350 μl RLT buffer with 1% 2-mercaptoethalnol (Sigma). For re-culture experiments, 
sorted cells were re-plated into proliferation media and allowed to recover for two days 
before fibrinogen treatment.
RNA Isolation and Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from OPC cultures 
with the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was 
generated and real-time (RT)-PCR performed as previously described (Ryu et al., 2015). 
Data are expressed as 2−ΔΔCT for the experimental gene-of-interest normalized against the 
housekeeping gene and presented as the fold change versus the relevant control. Primers are 
listed in Table S2.
Gene-Expression Profiling by Microarray Analysis—Microarray analysis was 
performed on triplicate samples of primary rat OPCs treated with 2.5 mg ml−1 fibrinogen for 
12 h and 48 h in differentiation media. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini kit 
(QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Probes were prepared using NuGEN 
Ovation Pico WTA V2 kit and NuGEN Encore Biotin Module, and hybridized to Rat Gene 
1.0 ST GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix). Arrays were scanned using an Affymetrix GCS3000 
scanner and Affymetrix Command Console software, and data were normalized using the 
RMA algorithm in Affymetrix Expression Console. Microarrays were normalized for array-
specific effects using Affymetrix's ‘Robust Multi-Array’ normalization. Normalized array 
values were reported on a log2 scale. For statistical analyses, we removed all array probe

 sets where no experimental groups had an average log2 intensity >3.0. This is a standard 
cutoff, below which expression is indistinguishable from background noise. Linear models, 
moderated t-statistics, fold change, false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted values, and the 
associated P values were calculated as described (Ryu et al., 2015).
Immunoblots—Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer supplemented with protease/
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Calbiochem) and lysates were cleared by centrifuging at 
13,000×g for 15 minutes at 4°C. Equal amounts of protein were loaded in 4-12% or 8-16% 
gels and analyzed by Western blotting. Bands were visualized with HRP-conjugated 
secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology or Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 
Densitometry was performed using ImageJ Software (NIH) with values for each band 
normalized to GAPDH loading controls from the same membrane.
Immunocytochemistry, Immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization—
Immunocytochemistry (ICC) was performed as previously described (Lee et al., 2012). 
Briefly, cultures were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at room temperature, permeabilized, 
and blocked by incubation with 10-20% goat or donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich or Jackson 
ImmunoResearch) and 0.1–0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. Primary antibody 
incubations were performed overnight at 4°C. Fluorescent secondary antibodies (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch or Thermo Fisher Scientific) were incubated for 1–2 h at room 
temperature. DAPI was used to detect cell nuclei.
For mouse immunohistochemistry (IHC), mice were transcardially perfused with 4% PFA 
under deep avertin anesthesia. Tissue was removed, post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA, 
cryoprotected in 30% sucrose/PBS, frozen in Neg-50 media (Thermo Scientific), 
cryosectioned into 12-μm sections, and placed on ColorFrost Plus microscope slides (Fisher 
Scientific). Sections were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked with 5% BSA or 5% 
normal donkey serum, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C and then 
fluorescent secondary antibodies for 1–2 h at room temperature. Slides were coverslipped 
with Prolong Gold or SlowFade Gold antifading agent with DAPI (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). In situ labeling of the mature oligodendrocyte marker PLP was performed as 
previously described (Fancy et al., 2011b).
For human IHC, formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue sections were first deparaffinized 
then rehydrated. Heat-mediated antigen retrieval was performed with Target Retrieval 
Solution, Low pH (Dako) for 1 hour in 95° water bath. Endogenous alkaline phosphatase 
and horseradish peroxidase activity was blocked with Bloxall (Vector). Sections were 
permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100, blocked with 2.5% normal horse serum, and incubated 
with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Sequential labeling of multiple antigens was 
performed using the ImmPRESS™-AP Anti-Mouse IgG (alkaline phosphatase) and 
ImmPRESS™ VR Anti-Rabbit IgG HRP Kits (Vector) and developed with the Vector Blue 
or NovaRED Substrate Kits (Vector) according to manufacturer's instruction. Slides were 
coverslipped in VectaMount AQ (Vector).
Images were acquired with an Axioplan II epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped 
with dry Plan-Neofluar objectives (10× 0.3 NA, 20× 0.5 NA, or 40× 0.75 NA), an Axiocam

 HRc CCD camera, and the Axiovision image analysis software; the BIOREVO BZ-9000 
inverted fluorescence microscope (Keyence) equipped with a Nikon CFI 60 Series infinite 
optical system and Keyence imaging software; or Olympus Fluoview confocal microscope 
equipped with 20× NA1.0 objective. All images were processed and analyzed in ImageJ. For 
ICC, cell counts from multiple wells (5–10 images per well) from two or more independent 
experiments were quantified for each test group. For IHC in the brain, cell counts from 
multiple 200μm × 200μm randomly selected regions of interest within 250μm of the cannula 
tract were quantified on two or more nonadjacent sections per mouse. N = 6-8 mice per 
group. In the spinal cord, quantification was performed on thresholded images. N = 3-4 mice 
per group. For ISH, PLP-positive cells were counted within lesions on three or more 
nonadjacent sections per mouse with N = 3-4 mice per group.
The following primary antibodies were used: cleaved caspase-3 (ICC: 1:200, rabbit 
polyclonal, #9661, Cell Signaling Technology); fibrinogen (mouse IHC: 1:1000, rabbit 
polyclonal, gift from J. Degen, Cincinnati; human IHC: 1:500, mouse monoclonal, 
#ab58207, Abcam); GAPDH (WB: 1:1000, rabbit monoclonal, #2118, Cell Signaling 
Technology); GFAP (ICC/IHC: 1:200, WB: 1:1000, rabbit monoclonal, #12389, Cell 
Signaling Technology; or rat monoclonal, #13-0300, Thermo Fisher Scientific); phospho-
histone H3 (ICC: 1:200, rabbit monoclonal, #3377, Cell Signaling Technology); Id2 (human 
IHC: 1:1000, rabbit monoclonal, # M213, CalBioreagents); LEF1 (ICC: 1:200, WB: 1:1000, 
rabbit monoclonal, #2230, Cell Signaling Technology); MBP (ICC/IHC: 1:500, WB: 
1:1000, mouse monoclonal, SMI-94, BioLegend; or rat monoclonal, #MAB395, EMD 
Millipore); Olig2 (ICC/IHC: 1:200, rabbit polyclonal, #ab9610, EMD Millipore); RNF43 
(IHC: 1:200, rabbit polyclonal, #ab84125, Abcam); phospho-Smad1/5 (WB: 1:1000, rabbit 
monoclonal, #9516, Cell Signaling Technology); phospho-Smad1/5/9 (WB: 1:1000, ICC: 
1:200, rabbit monoclonal, #13820, Cell Signaling Technology); and phospho-Smad1/5/8 
(IHC: 1:100, goat polyclonal, #sc-12353, Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Chronic fibrinogen infusion—Fibrinogen was infused continuously into the brains of 
tamoxifen-induced NG2-CreER™:Rosa-tdTomato mice using mini-osmotic pumps (ALZET 
model 2002, 0.5 μl/h for 14 d) and the brain infusion kit (ALZET Brain infusion kit 3) 
according to the manufacturer's instruction. Pumps were filled with either fibrinogen (2 mg 
ml-1) or artificial CSF and primed for 24 h at 37 °C. The sterile brain infusion cannula (30-
gauge) was stereotactically implanted at the following coordinates: 0.5 mm rostral to the 
bregma, 1 mm lateral to the midline, and 2 mm deep from the skull surface. The cannula was 
glued to the skull using Metabond (Parkell) and dental cement, while the pump was inserted 
subcutaneously on the back. Mice were euthanized for histological analysis after 14 day 
infusion.
Lysolecithin-induced focal demyelination—Demyelinated lesions were chemically 
induced by focal injection of lysolecithin into the spinal cord ventrolateral white matter of 8- 
to 12-wk-old C57Bl/6 mice as previously described (Mei et al., 2014) with modifications 
highlighted in the following experimental description. Animals were anesthetized via 
intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg). A midline skin 
incision was made over the upper lumbar regions of spinal cord, and the spinal column was

 secured with mouse vertebral clamps fixed in a stereotaxic frame. The epidural space was 
exposed by disruption of the L1-L2 interspinous ligament without laminectomy as described 
(Ryu et al., 2015). A pulled-glass micropipette secured to a Hamilton syringe was prefilled 
with 1% lysolecithin (L-α-lysophosphatidylcholine, Sigma-Aldrich) and inserted into the 
spinal cord 0.3 mm lateral to the spinal midline and a depth of 0.9 mm from the spinal cord 
surface. Then, 1 μL of 1% lysolecithin was injected (0.2 μl/min) and the glass micropipette 
remained in place for 5 min before being slowly withdrawn. After surgery, skin was sutured, 
and mice were allowed to recover.
Pharmacologic depletion of fibrinogen after lysolecithin injection—Mice were 
depleted of fibrinogen with ancrod at 3 dpl as described (Adams et al., 2007). The mice 
received 2.75 U ancrod/day by mini-osmotic pump (Alzet). In control animals, buffer-filled 
mini-pumps were implanted.
Electron microscope analysis of remyelination—At 14 days post-lysolecithin 
injection, mice were transcardially perfused with 2% PFA/2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M 
sodium cacodylate buffer with 2 mM CaCl2. Spinal cords were processed and EM 
performed with a FEI Spirit transmission electron microscope, according to standard 
procedures (Davalos et al., 2012). We examined ∼300 axons (∼75 axons per mouse, N = 4 
mice per group) within the rim of active remyelination at the lesion edge, and calculated g-
ratios as the diameter of the axon divided by the diameter of the axon plus the surrounding 
myelin sheath. Unmyelinated axons were excluded from G-ratio graph and analysis.
Quantification and Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. Differences between experimental 
conditions were analyzed with GraphPad Prism software. Data distribution was assumed to 
be normal, but this was not formally tested. No statistical methods were used to 
predetermine sample size, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported (Fancy et al., 
2014). Mice and cells were divided into experimental groups in an unbiased manner. No 
randomization was used to assign groups or to collect data. All animals survived until the 
end of the study, and all data points were included in analysis. Analyses of in vitro inhibitor, 
CRISPR, and conditioned media experiments were performed by a blinded observer. The 
unpaired Student's t-test was used for isolated pairs, and two-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) with a Bonferroni or Holm-Sidak post-test was used for multiple comparisons. P 
< 0.05 was considered significant.
