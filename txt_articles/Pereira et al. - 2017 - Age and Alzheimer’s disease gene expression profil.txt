Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-related cognitive decline represent a growing health burden and 
involve the hippocampus, a vulnerable brain region implicated in learning and memory. To 
understand the molecular effects of aging on the hippocampus, this study characterized the gene 
expression changes associated with aging in rodents using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The 
glutamate modulator, riluzole, which was recently shown to improve memory performance in aged 
rats, prevented many of the hippocampal age-related gene expression changes. A comparison of 
the effects of riluzole in rats against human AD datasets revealed that many of the genes changes 
in AD are reversed by riluzole. Expression changes identified by RNA-Seq were validated by qRT-
PCR open arrays. Riluzole is known to increase the glutamate transporter EAAT2's ability to 
scavenge excess glutamate, regulating synaptic transmission. RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry 
confirmed an increase in EAAT2 expression in hippocampus, identifying a possible mechanism 
underlying the improved memory function after riluzole treatment.
INTRODUCTION
Aging is associated with cognitive decline in humans which impairs quality of life and 
contributes significantly to healthcare costs1. This decline is also observed in rodents and 
nonhuman primates2. Aging is the primary risk factor for the dementia of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and with significant increases in life expectancy, the prevalence of AD and 
age-related cognitive disorders is rising3. The neural circuits affected in aging and AD are 
similar, involving the glutamatergic connections between cortical areas and with the 
hippocampal formation memory formation, a brain region in the medial temporal lobe that is 
critical for . memory formation 4,5,6. The glutamatergic pyramidal neurons of the 
hippocampus are highly vulnerable to damage in both age-related cognitive decline and in 
AD5, 7. However, the effects of glutamatergic modulation on aging remains unknown.

 Riluzole is a glutamate modulator approved for treatment of ALS8. Importantly, riluzole 
treatment for 4 months prevented age-related cognitive decline in rodents through clustering 
of dendritic spines 9, which form the postsynaptic component of most excitatory 
synapses 10. Clustering of synaptic inputs is an important neuroplastic mechanism that 
increases synaptic strength, empowering neural circuits 11, 12. Riluzole's ability to induce 
dendritic spines clustering 9, which is dependent on glutamatergic neuronal activity 13, 14 
and long-term potentiation (LTP) 15, suggests that it regulates synaptic glutamatergic activity 
and prevents glutamate overflow to the extra-synaptic space. Synaptic NMDA activity is 
critical for LTP and memory formation, while extrasynaptic NMDA activation is associated 
with long-term depression (LTD) and excitotoxicity16-18.
The excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2 or GLT-1; Slc1a2) is a high-affinity, Na+-
dependent glutamate transporter and the dominant glutamate transporter in the brain 19, 20. 
Glutamate transporters including EAAT2 are decreased in aging 21, 22 and in AD 23, 24 and 
associated with neurodegeneration24. Glutamate transporters play a critical role in 
determining synaptic and extrasynaptic glutamate levels 20, 25, regulating physiological 
glutamatergic neurotransmission. Riluzole can act to stabilize the inactivated state of the 
voltage-gated sodium channel and it can increase EAAT2 expression 22, 26-28, potentiating 
glutamate uptake 28-30.
Understanding the molecular vulnerabilities of glutamatergic neural circuits can point to 
novel and more effective treatment targets. Additionally, molecular changes resulting from 
treatments that prevent cognitive decline remain largely unexplored. This study uses the 
combination of RNA-seq and open arrays to detect and validate specific molecular pathways 
that are changed by aging and with riluzole. Importantly, gene expression changes associated 
with a rescue of cognitive decline under a therapeutic intervention (riluzole) are identified. 
Additionally, genes modulated by riluzole in the rat hippocampus are enriched in many of 
the same pathways, and in the opposite direction, as those altered in human AD gene 
expression datasets. These molecular transcriptional profiles in the aging hippocampus and 
with glutamatergic modulation by riluzole provide mechanistic insights into age-related 
cognitive decline and provide support for future studies on the role of glutamate transporters 
as potential therapeutic targets in the aging brain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Young (3 month old) and aged male Sprague-Dawley rats (retired breeders, 10 months old, 
Harlan Laboratories) were housed at Rockefeller University for the duration of the 
experiments. All rats were pair-housed in climate controlled conditions (30-50% humidity, 
21 ± 2 °C, 12-h light/dark cycle). Separate cohorts of animals were used for RNA extraction 
and immunohistochemical experiments. For RNA-seq experiments, each group had n=6: 3 
month-old (young rats), 10 month-old (middle age rats), 14 month-old riluzole treated rats 
and 14 month-old riluzole untreated rats. For immunohistochemistry, 3 month-old rats 
(n=10), 14 month-old untreated rats (n=9) and 14 month-old riluzole treated rats (n=10) 
were used. All procedures were in agreement with the National Institutes of Health and The 
Rockefeller University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Sample

 sizes were chosen to minimize the number of animals used given previously published 
reports using these methodologies 3132, 33.
Riluzole treatment
Treated rats had ad libitum access to riluzole solution from 10 months to 14 months old (17 
weeks), and aged-control and young-control rats had ad libitum access to tap water. All rats 
had ad libitum access to food. The riluzole compound (Sigma–Aldrich, Inc.) was dissolved 
in tap water at a concentration of 110 μg/mL, translating to
~4.0 mg·kg−1·d−1 p.o. To make the solution, riluzole was stirred in room temperature tap 
water for 6 hours. All containers with riluzole were covered in foil to prevent light exposure. 
Fresh solutions were made every 2–3 d for the duration of treatment.
Tissue processing and Immunohistochemistry
One week after the end of riluzole treatment, rats were deeply anesthetized with 100 mg/kg 
sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with 1.0% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M 
phosphate buffer (1 minute) followed by 4.0% paraformaldehyde + 0.125% Glutaraldehyde 
in 0.1 M PB (12 minutes). Brains were removed and post-fixed for 6 hours in 4.0% 
paraformaldehyde + 0.125% Glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PB (4°C) and transferred to 0.1% 
sodium azide in PB (4°C) until cutting the following day. Brains were cut on a vibratome 
(Leica, VT1000S) into 40 μm coronal for immunohistochemistry. Sections were stored in 
0.1% sodium azide in PB (4°C). Sections from each animal were washed with phosphate 
buffered saline (PBS), blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and incubated in 
primary antibody for GLT-1a (1:1000 dilution in PBS; gift from J. Rothstein Lab) overnight 
at 4°C. The tissue was then washed in PBS, and incubated with fluorescent secondary 
antibody (AlexaFluor488) for one hour. The intensity of the labeling was quantified using 
Nikon Imaging software in 50 um intervals from the cellular layer in each region of 
hippocampus. Electronic images were coded to blind the rater.
RNA Extraction, Sequencing and Analysis
Wet dissected hippocampus from rapidly decapitated rats were flash frozen on dry ice and 
stored at −80. RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy Lipid Kit (Qiagen) and Qiacube per 
the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were pooled for sequencing and final RNA 
integrity was checked using the Bioanalyzer (Agilent) prior to library preparation. All 
samples had RNA Integrity Numbers >8. Sequencing libraries were prepared by the 
Rockefeller University Genomics Core Facility using the TruSeq RNA Library Preparation 
Kit v2 (Illumina) and bar-coded for multiplexing so that all groups could be run in the same 
flow cell. 100bp single-stranded reads were collected on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina) at a 
sequencing depth of approximately 60 million reads per sample.
Raw data files were uploaded to Galaxy 34, 35 and checked for integrity by FastQC. To 
remove sequencing artifacts and residual adaptor sequences, reads were trimmed by 5-10bp 
at the 5’ and 3’ ends and then filtered to remove reads with quality scores <20. Reads were 
aligned to the rat genome (rn5) using TopHat2 36 and then loaded into Strand (Agilent) for 
quantification of read density by DESeq. Differential expression analyses were conducted in

 Strand using Z-Tests that were Benjamin-Hochberg corrected for false discovery rates. Venn 
diagrams and scatter plots based on significant gene lists were generated using Strand and 
Microsoft Excel.
Open Array Analysis
RNA was extracted from whole hippocampus as described above. cDNA was synthesized 
using the VILO kit (Life Technologies) using 2 micrograms of RNA for each reaction. Open 
array plates were loaded from a 384 well plate as described in the standard Open Array 
protocol (Life Technologies) and run on a Quantstudio 12k Flex thermocycler. Counts were 
exported to Microsoft Excel and used to calculate fold change using the ΔΔCt method 37. All 
values were normalized to pgk1 expression. Open array fold change values were plotted 
against RNA-seq results to generate scatter plots and calculate R^2 values (Prism Software).
Pathway Analysis
Gene lists from RNA-Seq results were uploaded to the DAVID bioinformatics database 
(http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp). The functional clusters, enrichment scores, and 
gene ontology (GO) terms for these categories were obtained from the functional annotation 
clustering tool. In all of the analysis, enrichment scores above 1.3 were considered 
significant (refelects p<0.05). (http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v4/n1/full/nprot.
2008.211.html).
The enrichment scores from clusters with similar GO terms were used to compare pathways 
that were altered in both riluzole and control conditions. Histograms were generated in 
Excel (Microsoft).
Comparisons with previous human AD expression studies
AD expression data were analyzed from the GEO and AMP-AD databases and lists of 
significantly changed genes (p<0.05) were generated for each study. Some studies examined 
whole hippocampus 38,39,40-42,88, whereas others used laser capture microdissection to 
examine specific subregions of hippocampus, such CA1 and CA3 regions 43 or CA1 alone44, 
or dentate gyrus and entorhinal cortex45. Therefore, to control for gene differences that arise 
from using different regions of the hippocampus and identify the most robust findings that 
were replicated across studies, only genes identified as significant in at least two studies 
were used for analysis. There were 2,024 genes that were up regulated and 1,870 genes that 
were down regulated with AD that met these criteria. These gene lists were analyzed with 
the DAVID functional annotation clustering tool as described above. The enrichment scores 
from these clusters were used to compare genes altered with AD to genes altered with 
riluzole treatment and the pathways with the highest combined enrichment scores are 
presented.
Genes significantly changes in aging studies in rats (p<0.05) were also analyzed using the 
GEO database. One study examined gene expression in the CA1 subregion at different 
points across the lifespan 46. Gene lists showing differential expression between 3 month 
and 23 month old rats, and between 3 month and 12 month old rats were obtained. A second 
study compared the genes from the whole hippocampus of 4-6 month40 and 24-26 month old

 rats 47. To control for the differences between regions of the hippocampus, only genes that 
were significant in both studies were used for analysis. There were 508 genes upregulated 
and 270 genes that were down-regulated in aged rats. These gene lists were analyzed with 
DAVID functional annotation clustering tool as described above. The enrichment scores 
from these clusters were compared to the enrichment scores of similar clusters obtained 
from the 443 genes that were down regulated and the 674 genes that were upregulated with 
age in our RNA-seq data.
RESULTS
Riluzole rescues age-related expression changes in rats
Hippocampal transcriptional profiles change markedly across the life span. In this study, rats 
between 3 months (young) and 10 months of age (middle-aged) showed 268 genes increased 
and 254 genes decreased. There were nearly twice as many changes from the 10 month to 14 
month old (aged) rats, with 674 genes increased and 443 genes decreased, demonstrating 
that transcriptional changes are stable across adulthood, but accelerate from middle age 
onwards (Figure 1a; Supp.Table1).
Animals treated with the glutamate modulator, riluzole, from 10 until 14 months had 908 
genes increased and 927 genes decreased (Fig. 1A). Importantly, there is a large overlap of 
genes (435) that were changed with aging and were also altered by riluzole treatment (Fig. 
1B). The overlapping genes were plotted to show fold change by age against fold change by 
riluzole treatment (Fig 1C). The lower right quadrant reflects 240 genes that increased with 
age and were decreased with riluzole treatment. In the upper left quadrant, 96 genes that 
were decreased with age were increased with riluzole treatment. This profile suggests that 
riluzole treatment rescues many age-related gene expression changes in the hippocampus.
Differentially expressed genes were organized into functional pathways using the DAVID 
pathway tools. The pathway classes that were reversed by riluzole are ranked by significance 
and divided into those that were upregulated with age and downregulated by riluzole (Fig. 
1D) and pathways that were downregulated with age and upregulated by riluzole (Fig. 1E). 
Many pathways reversed by riluzole treatment were related to synaptic transmission and 
plasticity. Examples of genes altered by aging that were reversed by riluzole are provided in 
Table 1. The NMDA receptor subunit NR2b (GRIN2b), a voltage-gated sodium channel 
subunit (Scn2a1), a calcium/calmodulin protein kinase II alpha (CAMK2A), the 
microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B), the synaptic scaffolding protein enriched in 
the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses SHANK3, the matrix metalloproteinase 9 
(MMP9), each decrease with aging and are increased by riluzole treatment, and have been 
implicated in learning and neuroplasticity 48, 49,50-54. In contrast, isoforms of the GABA 
receptor (GABRA6) are found to increase with aging and are decreased by riluzole 
treatment and their blockage may improve memory consolidation 50,55.
Notably, several neuroprotective genes were increased with riluzole treatment, including 
tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB; NTRK2), which is a receptor for brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 56(SuppTable2). An example of a gene that was significantly 
decreased with treatment but we did not find to be changed with aging is the cysteine/

 glutamate antiporter (xCT;Slc7a11) that exchanges extracellular cysteine for intracellular 
glutamate 57. It is a non-vesicular glutamate release system that may contribute to the 
regulation of extra-synaptic glutamate levels 57 (Supp Table 2).
Gene pathways implicated in AD are altered by riluzole
Hippocampal data from nine studies characterizing mortem hippocampal tissue from AD 
patients 38, 39, 43, 44,40-42, 45,88 were obtained from the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus, 
NCBI) and AMP-AD (Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer's Disease) databases. 
Differentially expressed genes identified in at least two of the nine studies were analyzed in 
DAVID for comparison with the present pathway results (Fig. 2A; Supp.Tables 3,4). Many 
of the pathways altered across studies in AD are also changed with riluzole treatment, 
including ones related to transmission of nerve impulse and synaptic plasticity (Fig. 2B). 
Examples of genes altered in both AD tissue and by riluzole treatment in rats can be found 
in Table 2. Importantly, the glutamate transporter EAAT2 is significantly decreased in AD, 
as well as in aging rats, and was rescued by riluzole treatment. Several genes previously 
implicated in neural transmission and plasticity are diminished in AD and recovered by 
riluzole treatment, including: ANK3, an integral membrane protein to the underlying 
spectrin-actin cytoskeleton that mediates synaptic morphology and transmission 58; 
CAMK2, a calcium/calmodulin kinase protein and major component of the postsynaptic 
density that is critically involved in induction of synaptic potentiation and memory 51, 59 and 
Rab3A, a vesicular trafficking protein that is crucial for synaptic plasticity, learning and 
memory 60, 61.
Validation of RNA-Sequencing results
Custom open array technology allows for high through qRT-PCR analysis of gene 
expression. Fifty-three genes of interest were selected to assay given their known roles in 
neuroplasticity, glutamate signaling, learning and memory, 39 of which were significant 
between at least one RNA-seq conditions (Supp Table 5). A strong correlation in fold change 
was observed between genes identified as significant by RNA-seq and the open array 
measurements, with three of the comparisons exhibiting R^2 values >0.80 (Fig. 3). 
Conversely, no significant differences in gene expression were observed in the open array 
analysis that were not already identified as significant by RNA-seq. This concordance, of 
both the positive and negative data for these genes, demonstrates that our sequencing 
analysis reflects reliable changes in gene expression.
To further validate the RNA-seq findings, results were compared against previous reports 
using microarray technology to study gene expression changes with aging in rat 
hippocampus 46, 47. Differentially expressed gene lists from rat studies were obtained using 
the GEO database and analyzed for pathway enrichment using DAVID. Many of the same 
gene pathways were changed in both the RNA-seq data and previously published reports of 
aged rats (Supp.Fig. 1). This is despite differences in the exact age of the animals, tissue 
collection techniques and the different array technologies used across these studies. 
Together, the bioinformatics and open array results suggest the RNA-sequencing data are 
representative of age and riluzole induced gene expression changes.

 Riluzole rescues EAAT2 levels after aging
Riluzole is known to increase EAAT2 expression22, 26-28, which helps maintain the correct 
amount of glutamate in the synaptic cleft 20. Failure of EAAT2 leads to glutamate spillover 
to the extrasynaptic space, which can cause decreased synaptic efficiency, long-term 
depression and excitotoxicity17, 62. EAAT2 is expressed in neurons, axon terminals and glial 
cells 63-67. Previous studies have shown EAAT2 is decreased with aging and AD 21, 24, 23. 
RNA-seq results from our rodent experiments confirm EAAT2 is downregulated with age, 
but importantly, levels of this gene are rescued by Riluzole treatment (Fig. 4A). Further, we 
identified increased immunohistochemical labeling for EAAT2 in the distal portion of CA1 
(Fig. 4B,C), which confirms the RNA-seq findings, and suggests a potential mechanism by 
which riluzole may rescue cognitive function to be further validated in future studies. 
Importantly, this region corresponds to the area in which increased dendritic spine clustering 
occurred in response to riluzole treatment 9.
DISCUSSION
This study reveals gene expression changes that occur with aging and glutamatergic 
modulation by riluzole in the rat hippocampus. The majority of transcriptional changes 
identified occurred from middle age to aged rats, rather than from young to middle aged 
animals, suggesting that a loss of the transcriptional stability during adulthood occurs with 
aging (Fig. 1A). Importantly, riluzole treatment reversed many of the age-related expression 
changes in the rat hippocampus (Fig. 1B,C), which primarily occurred in pathways 
associated with synaptic function (Fig. 1D,E). A similar inverse comparison of the pathways 
changed by riluzole with those identified in the hippocampus of AD patients demonstrated 
extensive commonality of affected genes (Fig. 2/Table 2), establishing riluzole's potential as 
a therapeutic agent for AD. The expression changes identified by sequencing were highly 
correlated with qRT-PCR results using open array technology, which validated over 50 genes 
of interest (Fig. 3). Finally, changes in the levels of EAAT2, a gene known to be increased 
by riluzole treatment 22, 26, 27, were validated by immunohistochemical labeling in 
hippocampus (Fig. 4). This finding raises the possibility that modulation of glutamate 
transporters is one mechanism by which riluzole can improve cognitive performance in 
aging. Additionally, these high-throughput studies offer an essential library of new targets 
that warrant further investigation into their role in glutamatergic transmission in the 
hippocampus and age-related cognitive decline.
The identification of pathways associated with the maintenance of synaptic health as 
changed by riluzole (Fig. 1D,E; Table 1) is consistent with previous work that demonstrated 
riluzole prevented age-related cognitive decline through clustering of dendritic spines 9, an 
important neuroplastic mechanism that has been shown by electrophysiological studies and 
computational models to allow non-linear summation of synaptic inputs 11, 68. Some 
examples of genes implicated in learning and plasticity that are reduced in aging and 
increased by riluzole treatment include: MMP9, which induces structural spine 
modifications54; NR2B, which is important for LTP31; MAP1B, which helps maintainaince 
of structural plasticity in the adult brain52 and SHANK3, which plays an important role in 
synaptic regulation53.

 Many of riluzole's effects on the aging rat hippocampus were opposite the changes observed 
in human hippocampus from AD patients (Fig 2B). This indicates that many of the key 
pathways altered by glutamate modulation with riluzole are implicated in the development 
of AD pathology, suggesting riluzole may have therapeutic potential. Notably, as in aging, 
the top AD pathways identified also involved synaptic transmission and plasticity and were 
reversed by riluzole. Some examples of genes recovered by riluzole treatment include: 
ANK3, which mediates synaptic morphology and transmission 58; CAMK2, involved in 
induction of synaptic potentiation and memory 51, 59 and Rab3A, which is crucial for 
synaptic plasticity, learning and memory 60, 61. Genes that are consistently altered in AD 
brains and are reversed by riluzole provide potential future therapeutic targets.
Synaptic dysfunction is a critical pathophysiological mechanism in AD that highly correlates 
with cognitive decline 69, 70. Amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau toxicities, the 
hallmarks of the neuropathology of AD, are intimately related to glutamatergic 
dysregulation: oligomers of Aβ disrupt glutamate uptake, inhibiting LTP through excessive 
activation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors 71, 72. Oligomers of Aβ also facilitate LTD71, 73 
and decrease surface expression of synaptic NMDA receptors74. Additionally, dysregulated 
glutamate increases release of Aβ75 and tau 76, 77 and enhances tau phosphorylation 78 and 
expression 79, forming a vicious cycle of neurotoxicity. Importantly, previous work has 
shown that EAAT2 haploinsufficiency accelerates cognitive deficits in AD mouse model 
(AβPPswe/PS1ΔE9) 80 and EAAT2 overexpression improves cognitive and pathological 
markers in APPSw,Ind AD mouse model 81. These studies support the hypothesis that 
improved regulation of glutamatergic signaling via enhanced EAAT2 uptake could 
potentially mitigate toxicities in AD brains.
Finally, increased immunoreactivity for EAAT2 was observed in the same region as 
increased spine clustering was previously identified in riluzole-treated rats,9 suggesting a 
potential mechanism by which riluzole can increase cognitive performance. Glutamate 
transporters play the key role of regulating synaptic transmission, and thereby learning and 
memory20, 25. They prevent glutamate spillover to the extrasynaptic space and minimize 
cross-talk between neighboring synapses20, 62. Importantly, they also control the time course 
of synaptic glutamate82, 83. More recent work suggests that EAAT2 surface trafficking also 
shapes synaptic transmission84. Previous studies have suggested that riluzole increases 
glutamate uptake through both increased EAAT2 expression and stabilization of the 
inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels 22, 29, 30,26, 28. A recent in vivo study 
using microelectrode arrays coupled with amperometry has shown that riluzole reduces 
extrasynaptic glutamate levels and enhances cognitive performance which correlated with 
the increased glutamate uptake measures 27. These mechanisms of riluzole have been 
hypothesized to facilitate synaptic glutamatergic activity and to increase glutamate-
glutamine cycling while preventing glutamate overflow to the extra-synaptic space 26, 85, 86. 
Activation of extra-synaptic NMDA receptors has been associated with LTD and 
excitotoxicity, and it is a likely important mechanism in many neurodegenerative diseases, 
including AD17, 18.

 In conclusion
these findings identify molecular pathways implicated in aging that are rescued by 
administration of a known glutamate modulator, riluzole. Modeling the expression 
differences in response to riluzole establishes a framework of changes associated with 
improved learning and memory, against which other treatments can be compared. Further, 
many of the pathways changed by riluzole have been implicated across multiple studies in 
the pathophysiology of AD, suggesting glutamate modulators may represent novel 
treatments for both age-related cognitive decline and AD. Future studies will seek to 
conclusively demonstrate whether increased expression and activity of glutamate 
transporters are the essential mechanism underlying riluzole's ability to improve cognitive 
performance.

 Figure 1. Riluzole treatment of aged rats rescues age-related gene expression changes in the 
hippocampus
A. Differential expression analysis revealed gene expression changes across age and with 
riluzole treatment. Between 10 month old and 14 month old rats (Blue Circle), 674 genes 
were upregulated and 443 genes downregulated. 1,480 genes were changed between age-
matched riluzole treated rats and controls (red Circle), with 555 genes increased and 925 
genes decreased. B. Venn diagram illustrating the overlap of 435 genes that were changed by 
both aging (blue; 10 to 14 months) and by riluzole treatment (Red). C. Scatter plot 
illustrating the 435 overlapping genes showing fold change by age (x-axis; 10-14 month) 
against fold change with riluzole (y-axis). The upper left quadrant represent 96 genes that 
had decreased expression with age and increased expression after riluzole treatment. 
Conversely, the lower right quadrant illustrates 240 genes that were increased with age and 
decreased by riluzole. D. Histograms illustrating significantly enriched pathways based on 
genes differentially expressed by either aging or riluzole treatment (Enrichment score >1.3 
reflects p<0.05). Similar pathways and enrichment scores were observed when comparing

 Figure 2. Gene pathways changed by riluzole in aged rats are similar and in the opposite 
direction to those changed in post-mortem AD brains
A. Schematic representation of the bioinformatics strategy used to generate pathway lists. 
Only genes significantly differentially expressed in at least two studies were included. B. 
Significantly enriched pathways derived from genes upregulated by riluzole (light green 
bars) were similar to gene pathways downregulated in AD brains (dark green bars). Gene 
pathways downregulated by riluzole (light blue bars) also showed similarity to pathways that 
are increased in AD (dark blue bars). Differentially expressed gene lists from AD brains 
were derived from publically available data posted in GEO and AMP-AD and subjected to 
pathway analysis using DAVID. (Enrichment score >1.3 reflects p<0.05)
