ABSTRACT: The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation has 
initiated a near-continuous review of cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
science that replaces the previous 5-year cyclic batch-and-queue approach 
process. This is the first of an annual series of International Consensus 
on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular 
Care Science With Treatment Recommendations summary articles that 
will include the cardiopulmonary resuscitation science reviewed by 
the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation in the previous 
year. The review this year includes 5 basic life support and 1 pediatric 
Consensuses on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency 
Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations. Each of 
these includes a summary of the science and its quality based on Grading 
of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria 
and treatment recommendations. Insights into the deliberations of the 
International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation task force members 
are provided in Values and Preferences sections. Finally, the task force 
members have prioritized and listed the top 3 knowledge gaps for each 
population, intervention, comparator, and outcome question.
U
ntil recently, the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) science review process has been un-
dertaken in 5-year cycles, the last being published in 2015.1,2 This batch-
and-queue approach has the advantage of enabling a well-planned and system-
atic update of guidelines and training materials, but it could potentially delay the 
implementation of new effective treatments. In 2016, ILCOR adopted a new pro-
cess that would enable a near-continuous review of resuscitation science by using 
task force–prioritized population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO) 
questions. There will be 2 distinct pathways for evidence evaluation. Knowledge 
synthesis units (KSUs), organizations with expertise in searching scientific data-
bases and performing systematic reviews and meta-analyses, will address PICOs 
that are large and complicated or topics for which several PICOs can be grouped 
together and addressed through sensitivity or subgroup analyses. Contracted sys-
tematic reviewers will undertake simple systematic reviews involving typically single 
PICO questions. Both pathways involve content experts, and critical steps during 
evidence evaluation are discussed with relevant task forces when needed.
The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation 
(GRADE) process that was adopted for the ILCOR “2015 International Consensus 
on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science 
With Treatment Recommendations” (CoSTR) will also be used for the continuous

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
review of CPR science.3 In the GRADE approach, the 
quality of evidence supporting intervention effects (de-
fined by the PICO question) is rated as high, moderate, 
low, or very low. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
start as high-quality evidence, and observational stud-
ies start as low-quality evidence. Five factors may lead 
to downgrading of the quality of evidence, and 3 fac-
tors may enable an upgrade of the quality of evidence 
(Table).4–9 The quality assessments for each outcome are 
summarized in GRADE evidence profile tables, which 
also include a summary of findings in the form of the 
numbers of patients, the relative risk (RR), and an indi-
cation of the absolute risk (described as the risk differ-
ence [RD]).
This is the first of a series of annual ILCOR CoSTR 
summary articles that will include the CPR science re-
viewed by ILCOR in the previous year. The review this 
year includes 5 basic life support (BLS) CoSTRs and 1 
pediatric CoSTR. The CoSTRs were produced after a 
systematic review by the KSU at St. Michael’s Hospital, 
Toronto, ON, Canada, in collaboration with ILCOR con-
tent experts and members of the ILCOR BLS and Pediat-
ric Task Forces. All the evidence profile tables and meta-
analyses were produced by the KSU and reviewed by 
ILCOR BLS and Pediatric Task Forces. The CoSTRs have 
been subjected to rigorous evaluation, peer review, and 
public comment. We anticipate that by 2018, ≈20 PICO 
questions will be addressed per year, and each question 
will generate a draft CoSTR that will be published on 
the ILCOR website.10 The draft CoSTRs published on-
line will provide the data for the annual CoSTR sum-
mary article that will be published each year. The sum-
mary article differs in several respects from the draft 
CoSTRs published on the ILCOR website: The language 
used to describe the science is not restricted to stan-
dard GRADE terminology, which makes it more acces-
sible to a wider audience; the values and preferences 
have been expanded to provide greater insight into the 
rationale for treatment recommendations, particularly 
when high-quality evidence is lacking; and the top 3 
knowledge gaps for each topic have been prioritized 
and ranked by the task force members.
The CoSTRs are based on the data summarized in the 
GRADE evidence profile tables for each of the key out-
comes for each of the clinical scenarios. The pertinent 
outcome data are listed for each statement as RR (with 
95% confidence interval [CI]) and RD (with 95% CI). 
The RD is the absolute difference between the risks and 
is calculated by subtracting the risk in the control group 
from the risk in the intervention group. This absolute 
effect enables a more clinically useful assessment of the 
magnitude of the effect of an intervention and enables 
calculation of the number needed to treat (=1/RD).
CPR STRATEGIES: BACKGROUND
One of the primary measures taken to improve survival 
after cardiac arrest has been focused efforts to improve 
the quality of CPR. Although the impact of high-quality 
chest compressions has been studied extensively,11–14 the 
role of ventilation and oxygenation is less clear. Efforts to 
simplify resuscitation by delaying ventilation or by provid-
ing passive oxygenation have been implemented for both 
lay and professional rescuers. These strategies have been 
consistently associated with increased bystander CPR 
rates and fewer pauses in chest compressions, but effects 
on survival have been less clear.15–18
During the development of the 2015 CoSTR, several 
PICO questions were dedicated to reviewing evidence 
of continuous chest compression strategies for both lay 
and professional rescuers in various populations (adult, 
pediatric) and for various settings (in hospital, out of hos-
pital).19–22 Shortly after these reviews were completed, a 
23 
711-patient RCT evaluating the effectiveness of con-
tinuous chest compressions in the emergency medical 
services (EMS) setting was published.23 In parallel, de-
velopments of large national and regional registries are 
continually providing new insights into the epidemiology 
of cardiac arrest and bystander CPR.24 These emerging 
publications generated an urgent need to review all 
available evidence on continuous compression strategies 
to provide updated evidence evaluations that included 
the latest science available. The systematic review and 
meta-analysis of this topic undertaken by St. Michael’s 
Hospital KSU and ILCOR has been published separately.25

and across all settings (in hospital and out of hos-
pital) were included. Studies that included animals 
were not eligible.
• Intervention: All manual CPR methods, including 
compression-only CPR, continuous compression 
CPR, and CPR with different compression-to-ven-
tilation (CV) ratios, were used. Compression-only 
CPR included compressions with no ventilations; 
continuous compression CPR included compres-
sions with asynchronous ventilations or minimally 
interrupted cardiac resuscitation. Studies that men-
tioned the use of a mechanical device during CPR 
were considered only if the same device was used 
across all relevant intervention arms and would 
therefore not confound the observed effect.
• Comparators: Studies had to compare at least 2 
different CPR methods from the eligible interven-
tions; studies without a comparator were excluded.
• Outcomes: The primary outcome was favorable 
neurological outcomes, measured by cerebral per-
formance or a modified Rankin Scale. Secondary 
outcomes were survival, return of spontaneous cir-
culation, and quality of life.
• Study designs: RCTs and nonrandomized stud-
ies (non-RCTs, interrupted time series, controlled 
before-and-after studies, cohort studies) were eligi-
ble for inclusion. Study designs without a compar-
ator group (eg, case series, cross-sectional studies), 
reviews, and pooled analyses were excluded.
• Time frame: Published studies in English searched 
on January 15, 2016, were included.
DISPATCH-ASSISTED COMPRESSION-
ONLY CPR COMPARED WITH 
DISPATCH-ASSISTED CONVENTIONAL 
CPR (ADULTS): CONSENSUS ON 
SCIENCE
Dispatch-assisted compression-only CPR was compared 
with dispatch-assisted conventional CPR (ratio of 15 
compressions to 2 ventilations) in 1 RCT that generated 
low-quality evidence for favorable neurological func-
tion.16 The quality of evidence was downgraded for se-
rious imprecision because only 2 of the 3 sites provided 
data on neurological outcome. In this study, instructions 
to give continuous chest compressions had no demon-
strable benefit for favorable neurological function (RR, 
1.25 [95% CI, 0.94–1.66]; RD, 2.86 percentage points 
[95% CI, −0.80 to 6.53]) compared with instructions to 
give compressions and ventilations at a ratio of 15:2.
Dispatch-assisted compression-only CPR compared 
with dispatch-assisted conventional CPR (ratio of 15 
compressions to 2 ventilations) in 3 RCTs provided low-
quality evidence for the critical outcome of survival to 
hospital discharge.15–17 The quality of evidence for these 
studies was downgraded because of serious risk of bias: 
All 3 studies excluded patients after randomization and 
included an intervention that could not be blinded, and 
in at least 1 study, many outcome data were missing.17 
In a previously published meta-analysis of these stud-
ies, there appeared to be a small benefit in survival to 
hospital discharge in favor of the group instructed to 
give continuous chest compressions compared with the 
group instructed to give compressions and ventilations 
at a ratio of 15:2 (RR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.01–1.46]; RD, 
2.4 percentage points [95% CI, 0.1–4.9]; fixed-effect 
model; P=0.04).26 This meta-analysis used survival to 
hospital discharge for all 3 studies,15–17 although the 
Swenson study was missing 55% of these outcome 
data. In a meta-analysis using a random-effect model to 
combine survival to hospital discharge15,16 and 30-day 
survival17 outcomes to capture the maximum amount 
of data, survival was no longer significantly different 
between the 2 groups. Continuous chest compressions 
had an RR for survival of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.00–1.45; RD, 
1.88 percentage points [95% CI, −0.05 to 3.82]) com-
pared with conventional 15:2 CPR.
Treatment Recommendation
We recommend that dispatchers provide chest com-
pression–only CPR instructions to callers for adults with 
suspected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) (strong 
recommendation, low-quality evidence).
Values and Preferences
In making these recommendations, we recognize that 
the evidence in support of these recommendations 
comes from randomized trials of variable quality per-
formed at a time when the ratio of chest compres-
sions to ventilations was 15:2, which leads to greater 
interruptions to chest compressions than the currently 
recommended ratio of 30:2. However, the signal from 
every trial is consistently in favor of telephone CPR pro-
tocols that use a compression-only CPR instruction set. 
Reviewing the totality of available evidence and con-
sidering current common practice, training, and quality 
assurance experiences, the BLS Task Force has kept the 
strong recommendation for compression-only CPR for 
dispatch-assisted CPR despite low-quality evidence. In 
making these recommendations, we placed a higher 
value on the initiation of bystander compressions and 
a lower value on possible harms of delayed ventilation. 
The task force recognizes that there are many unan-
swered questions when balancing possible benefits 
and harms from bystander ventilation. Most notably, al-
though some cardiac arrest pathogeneses (eg, asphyxial 
cardiac arrest) might be dependent on early ventilation 
to increase survival, bystanders’ ability to learn how to

not known. Possible harmful effects of incorrectly per-
formed ventilations (gastric inflation) and fewer com-
pressions performed before ambulance arrival because 
of more complex instructions and pauses for ventilation 
were weighted more heavily than potential benefits 
from early ventilation.
This document refers to dispatch-assisted CPR. In 
adopting this terminology, we acknowledge that the 
dispatching of emergency medical resources is a limit-
ed description of the tasks performed by multiprofes-
sional teams working in emergency medical dispatch 
centers, and perhaps more suitable options are be-
ing used worldwide. They include telecommunica-
tors, ambulance communication officers, emergency 
medical communicators, and call handlers, as well as 
other terms more closely related to their actual task 
description.
Knowledge Gaps
Several knowledge gaps were identified in the review 
of this topic. A more comprehensive list has been post-
ed on the ILCOR website.10 The BLS Task Force ranked 
the knowledge gaps in priority order, and the top 3 are 
the following:
1. What is the optimal instruction sequence for 
coaching callers in dispatch-assisted CPR?
2. What are the identifying key words used by call-
ers that are associated with cardiac arrest?
3. What is the impact of dispatch-assisted CPR 
instructions on cardiac arrests from noncardiac 
causes such as drowning, trauma, or asphyxia in 
adult and pediatric patients?
BYSTANDER COMPRESSION-ONLY 
CPR COMPARED WITH BYSTANDER 
CPR USING COMPRESSIONS AND 
VENTILATIONS (ADULTS): CONSENSUS 
ON SCIENCE
Bystander CPR using chest compressions only was com-
pared with bystander CPR using a CV ratio of 15:2 or 
30:2 in 6 cohort studies that generated very-low-quality 
evidence for the critical outcome of favorable neuro-
logical function.24,27–31 In a meta-analysis of 2 studies, 
there was no significant difference in favorable neuro-
logical function in patients who received compression-
only CPR compared with patients who received CPR at 
a CV ratio of 15:2 (RR, 1.34 [95% CI, 0.82–2.20]; RD, 
0.51 percentage points [95% CI, −2.16 to 3.18]).27,29 
The quality of evidence was downgraded for serious 
indirectness and imprecision because of varying results 
across studies, because the control group had a differ-
ent CV ratio from the intervention group, and because 
there was variable postarrest care. In a meta-analysis 
of 3 studies, there was no significant difference in fa-
vorable neurological function in patients who received 
compression-only CPR compared with patients who re-
ceived compressions and ventilations during a period 
when the CV ratio changed from 15:2 to 30:2 (RR, 1.12 
[95% CI, 0.71–1.77]; RD, 0.28 percentage points [95% 
CI, −2.33 to 2.89]).28,30,31 The quality of evidence was 
downgraded for serious indirectness and imprecision 
because the control group had a different CV ratio from 
the intervention group and there was variable postar-
rest care. One study examined the influence of nation-
wide dissemination of compression-only CPR recom-
mendations for lay rescuers and showed that, although 
bystander CPR rates and nationwide survival improved, 
patients who received compression-only CPR had lower 
survival compared with patients who received chest 
compressions and ventilations at a CV ratio of 30:2 (RR, 
0.72 [95% CI, 0.69–0.76]; RD, −0.74 percentage points 
[95% CI, −0.85 to 0.63]).24 The quality of evidence 
was downgraded for serious indirectness because the 
study did not directly compare compression-only CPR 
with CPR with chest compressions and ventilations but 
rather compared compression-only and CPR with chest 
compressions and ventilations with no CPR. The evi-
dence was also considered indirect because multiple as-
pects of resuscitation were likely to have changed over 
time in this before-and-after study.
Bystander CPR using compression-only CPR was 
compared with bystander CPR using a CV ratio of 
15:2 or 30:2 in 7 cohort studies that generated very-
low-quality evidence for the critical outcome of sur-
vival.24,27,29,32–35 In a meta-analysis of 6 studies, there 
was no significant difference in survival in patients 
who received compression-only CPR compared with 
patients who received CPR at a CV ratio of 15:2 (RR, 
0.88 [95% CI, 0.74–1.04]; RD, −0.83 percentage 
points [95% CI, −1.85 to 0.19]).27,29,32–35 The quality 
of evidence was downgraded for serious risk of bias 
and indirectness. Risk of bias was related to the com-
parability of the cohorts because the majority did not 
adjust for potential confounders. The studies were 
also downgraded for indirectness because they either 
were investigating CPR guideline changes or did not 
explicitly report the CV ratio among included cases. In 
1 study, patients receiving compression-only CPR had 
worse survival compared with patients who received 
CPR at a CV ratio of 30:2 (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.73–
0.78]; RD, −1.42 percentage points [95% CI, −1.58 
to −1.25]).24 The quality of evidence was downgraded 
for serious indirectness as described earlier. In a meta-
analysis of 3 observational studies,28,30,31 there was no 
significant difference in survival when patients who 
received compression-only CPR were compared with 
patients who received CPR during a period when the 
CV ratio changed from 15:2 to 30:2 (RR, 1.16 [95%

CI, 0.64–2.09]; RD, 1.27 percentage points [95% CI, 
−3.70 to 6.23]). The quality of evidence was down-
graded for serious inconsistency, indirectness, and im-
precision as described earlier.
Treatment Recommendations
We continue to recommend that bystanders perform 
chest compressions for all patients in cardiac arrest 
(good practice statement). In the 2015 CoSTR, this was 
cited as a strong recommendation but based on very-
low-quality evidence.19,20
We suggest that bystanders who are trained, able, 
and willing to give rescue breaths and chest compres-
sions do so for all adult patients in cardiac arrest (weak 
recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).
Values and Preferences
In making these recommendations, the task force 
placed high value on the 2010 and 2015 CoSTRs that 
showed that rescuers should perform chest compres-
sions for all patients in cardiac arrest.19,20,36,37 Given that 
the 2017 systematic review did not seek data compar-
ing any CPR with no CPR and in keeping with GRADE 
recommendations, our recommendation for perform-
ing chest compressions for all patients in cardiac arrest 
has been cited as a good practice statement (see Ap-
pendixes 1 and 2).38 We also placed high value on the 
advantage derived from the simplicity of teaching or 
providing instructions for compression-only CPR. This 
recommendation reflects the value placed on the data 
that indicate no apparent downside in patients with 
true arrest with similar survival rates from adult cardiac 
arrests of cardiac origin both with and without venti-
lations.39,40 We also acknowledged the potential addi-
tional benefits of CPR with compressions and ventila-
tions when delivered by trained laypeople, particularly 
in settings where EMS response intervals are long or 
when the cause of cardiac arrest is asphyxia.
Knowledge Gaps
Several knowledge gaps were identified in the review 
of this topic. A more comprehensive list has been post-
ed on the ILCOR website.10 The BLS Task Force ranked 
the knowledge gaps in priority order, and the top 3 are 
listed here:
1. The effect of delayed ventilation versus 30:2 high-
quality CPR.
2. The impact of continuous chest compressions 
on outcomes for cardiac arrests from noncardiac 
causes such as drowning, trauma, or asphyxia in 
adult and pediatric patients.
3. The ability of bystanders to perform correct 
mouth-to-mouth ventilations.
EMS-DELIVERED CPR: CONSENSUS  
ON SCIENCE
High-quality CPR includes minimal interruptions to 
chest compressions. Three distinct techniques are used 
by EMS to deliver continuous chest compression CPR 
during OHCA: (1) continuous chest compressions with 
positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) of the lungs with a 
bag-mask device typically at a rate of 10 breaths per 
minute, (2) continuous chest compressions and PPV of 
the lungs via a tracheal tube or supraglottic airway, and 
(3) continuous chest compressions with passive oxygen-
ation typically with an oropharyngeal airway and simple 
oxygen mask (a strategy sometimes referred to as mini-
mally interrupted cardiac resuscitation). Studies involv-
ing these techniques have typically delayed insertion of 
an advanced airway until after return of spontaneous 
circulation or 3 cycles of CPR.
For the critical outcome of favorable neurological 
function, we identified high-quality evidence from 1 
RCT23 and very-low-quality evidence from 2 cohort stud-
ies.18,41 In the RCT, patients who were randomized to 
PPV delivered with a bag-mask device without pausing 
chest compressions had no demonstrable benefit for fa-
vorable neurological function (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.84–
1.00]; RD, −0.65 percentage points [95% CI, −1.31 to 
0.02]) compared with patients randomized to conven-
tional CPR with a CV ratio of 30:2.23 In 1 cohort study, 
patients who received continuous chest compressions 
and passive ventilation for 3 cycles had improved favor-
able neurological function (RR, 2.58 [95% CI, 1.5–4.47]; 
RD, 24.11 percentage points [95% CI, 11.58–36.63]) 
compared with those who received compressions and 
ventilations at a time when the CV ratio changed from 
15:2 to 30:2.41 The quality of evidence was down-
graded for serious risk of bias and indirectness. Risk of 
bias included moderate risk that the continuous chest 
compression cohort was not representative and high 
risk that there were confounding factors between the 
cohorts for which there was no adjustment. The study 
was considered indirect because of its before-and-after 
design including a period with changing guidelines. In 
the other cohort study,18 minimally interrupted cardiac 
resuscitation (initial series of 3 cycles of 200 uninter-
rupted chest compressions, passive ventilation, before-
and-after rhythm analysis with shock if appropriate) in 
patients with witnessed shockable cardiac arrest had no 
demonstrable benefit for favorable neurological func-
tion (RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.57–1.13]; RD, −11.30 per-
centage points [95% CI, −28.48 to 5.87]) compared 
with conventional CPR (mixture of CV ratios of 15:2 and 
30:2). The quality of evidence was downgraded for seri-
ous risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision. Risk of 
bias included moderate risk that the continuous chest 
compression cohort was not representative and unclear 
risk of inadequate follow-up. The study was considered

and imprecision as described earlier.
Treatment Recommendations
We recommend that EMS providers perform CPR with 
30 compressions to 2 ventilations or continuous chest 
compressions with PPV delivered without pausing chest 
compressions until a tracheal tube or supraglottic de-
vice has been placed (strong recommendation, high-
quality evidence).
We suggest that when EMS systems have adopted 
minimally interrupted cardiac resuscitation, this strat-
egy is a reasonable alternative to conventional CPR for 
witnessed shockable OHCA (weak recommendation, 
very-low-quality evidence).
Values and Preferences
In making these recommendations, the task force 
took into consideration that although there was rela-
tive homogeneity in the body of evidence around EMS 
continuous chest compressions and adjunctive thera-
pies (eg, bundles of care in the community such as im-
proved bystander CPR strategies and hospital systems 
of care such as transfers to resuscitation centers), there 
was heterogeneity in the continuous CPR ventilation 
strategies (ie, passive versus PPV strategies) and in the 
comparator groups. The recommendations reflect high-
quality evidence for the safety of CPR with compres-
sions and ventilations (CV ratio, 30:2) by EMS provid-
ers while acknowledging the lack of data supporting 
superior functional or survival outcomes. The task force 
also placed a relatively high value on the importance of 
providing high-quality chest compressions and simplify-
ing resuscitation logistics for EMS systems and noted 
the support for the clinical benefit of bundles of care 
involving minimally interrupted cardiac resuscitation. In 
making a weak recommendation in support of systems 
that have implemented minimally interrupted cardiac 
resuscitation, the task force also acknowledges the lack 
of RCTs evaluating passive oxygenation strategies such 
as those described in minimally interrupted cardiac re-
suscitation.
Knowledge Gaps
Several knowledge gaps were identified in the review of 
this topic. A more comprehensive list has been posted 
on the ILCOR website.10 The BLS Task Force ranked the 
knowledge gaps in priority order, and the top 3 follow:
1. What is the effect of delayed ventilation versus 
30:2 high-quality CPR?
2. Which elements of the bundled care (compres-
sions, ventilations, delayed defibrillation) are most 
important?
3. How effective is passive oxygen insufflation 
(applying a flow of oxygen via a face mask or a 
supraglottic airway but without PPV)?
IN-HOSPITAL CPR: CONSENSUS ON 
SCIENCE
Only 1 cohort study evaluating the effect of continuous 
chest compressions in the in-hospital setting was identi-
fied.42 In this study, PPV without interruption of chest 
compressions after tracheal intubation was compared 
with interruption of chest compressions for 1 ventila-
tion after every fifth chest compression (a CV ratio of 
5:1) among patients admitted to a hospital emergency 
department after OHCA. Chest compressions were de-
livered by a mechanical device known as the Thumper 
Mechanical CPR Machine (Michigan Instruments, Grand 
Rapids, MI) in all patients, a device that is not commonly 
used clinically and that delivered different average com-
pression rates (70 versus 100 per minute) between the 
study periods. The study compared continuous chest 
compressions and ventilations delivered after every 10th 
compression (without pausing compressions) with a 5:1 
CV ratio (with pauses for ventilation) that resulted in 
more frequent pauses in compressions and higher over-
all ventilation rates than the conventional 30:2 CV ratio 
recommended by the 2015 CoSTR.19,20 It was conducted 
with a before-and-after design that, although adjusted 
for demographic and cardiac arrest characteristics, did 
not account for potential temporal differences in resus-
citation efficiencies between study periods.
Very-low-quality evidence was identified for the criti-
cal outcome of favorable neurological function.42 There 
was no difference in favorable neurological outcome 
between the uninterrupted 10:1 CPR and interrupted 
5:1 CPR cohorts (RR, 1.18 [95% CI, 0.32–4.35]; RD, 
0.29 percentage points [95% CI, −2.05 to 2.64]). The

quality of evidence was downgraded to very serious 
imprecision because the CIs for RD crossed from appre-
ciable harm (0.75) to appreciable benefit (1.25).
Low-quality evidence was identified for the criti-
cal outcome of survival.42 The uninterrupted 10:1 CPR 
cohort had a higher survival rate to hospital discharge 
compared with the interrupted 5:1 CPR cohort (RR, 
2.38 [95% CI, 1.22–4.65]; RD, 5.86 percentage points 
[95% CI, 1.19–10.53]).
Treatment Recommendation
Whenever tracheal intubation or a supraglottic airway 
is achieved during in-hospital CPR, we suggest that 
providers perform continuous compressions with PPV 
delivered without pausing chest compressions (weak 
recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).
Values and Preferences
In making this recommendation, the task force noted 
that there is no prospective study of in-hospital CPR that 
compares delivery of ventilations during continuous 
manual chest compressions with ventilations delivered 
during pauses in manual chest compressions. The task 
force placed value in that delivering continuous chest 
compressions is a common practice in many settings 
after tracheal intubation or placement of a supraglottic 
airway. The only study to have addressed this specific 
question in an in-hospital setting has limited applica-
bility in that it was performed after OHCA and in the 
context of mechanical chest compressions, along with 
other limitations. However, the findings of this study 
support the treatment recommendation.
Knowledge Gaps
Several knowledge gaps were identified in the review of 
this topic. A more comprehensive list has been posted on 
the ILCOR website.10 The BLS Task Force ranked the knowl-
edge gaps in priority order, and the top 3 are as follows:
1. No prospective study of in-hospital CPR compares 
delivery of ventilations during continuous manual 
chest compressions with ventilations delivered 
during pauses in manual chest compressions.
2. What is the effect of delayed ventilation versus 30:2 
high-quality CPR?
3. What is the optimal method for ensuring a patent 
airway?
CHEST CV RATIO (ADULTS): 
CONSENSUS ON SCIENCE
The 30:2 CV ratio was compared with a different CV ra-
tio in 2 observational cohort studies that generated very-
low-quality evidence for the critical outcome of favorable 
neurological function.43,44 In a meta-analysis of these 
studies, the 30:2 CV ratio demonstrated benefit for fa-
vorable neurological function (RR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.02–
1.76]; RD, 1.72 percentage points [95% CI, 0.52–2.91]) 
compared with the CV ratio of 15:2. The quality of evi-
dence was downgraded for serious indirectness because 
these studies were before-and-after investigations that 
evaluated the bundle-of-care interventions implemented 
after the “2005 International Consensus on Cardiopul-
monary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular 
Care Science With Treatment Recommendations,”45,46 in 
which the change in CV ratio was just 1 aspect.
Seven observational cohort studies provided very-
low-quality evidence for the critical outcome of surviv-
al.43,44,47–51 The quality of evidence was downgraded for 
serious indirectness because the CV ratio was not the only 
aspect evaluated in these studies. In a meta-analysis of 6 
cohort studies, the survival rate was higher in the group of 
patients who received 30:2 CPR compared with the group 
who received 15:2 CPR (RR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.19–1.59]; RD, 
2.48 percentage points [95% CI, 1.57–3.38]).43,44,47,49–51  
One retrospective cohort showed improved survival with 
the 50:2 CV ratio compared with the 15:2 ratio (RR, 1.96 
[95% CI, 1.28–2.99]; RD, 21.48 percentage points [95% 
CI, 6.90–36.06]).48 The quality of evidence was down-
graded for serious risk of bias and indirectness. Risk of bias 
included high risk that the cohorts were not comparable 
on the basis of design or analysis and moderate risk of 
inadequate follow-up. The study was also considered 
indirect because of its before-and-after design poten-
tially evaluating several changes to practice.
Treatment Recommendation
We suggest a CV ratio of 30:2 compared with any oth-
er CV ratio in patients with cardiac arrest (weak recom-
mendation, very-low-quality evidence).
Values and Preferences
In making this recommendation, the task force ac-
knowledged that there would likely be substantial re-
source implications (eg, reprogramming, retraining) as-
sociated with a change in recommendation related to 
the CV ratio. In the absence of any data addressing the 
critical outcomes, the task force placed a high value on 
maintaining consistency with the 2005, 2010, and 2015 
CoSTRs.19,20,36,37,45,46 We also placed high value on find-
ings that suggest that a bundle of care (which included 
a CV ratio of 30:2) resulted in more lives being saved.
Knowledge Gaps

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
posted on the ILCOR website.10 The BLS Task Force 
ranked the knowledge gaps in priority order, and the 
top 3 follow:
1. The possible benefit of higher CV ratios (more 
compressions per ventilations).

ventilations during the short pause in chest com-
pressions during CPR.
3. Is there a ratio-dependent critical volume of air 
movement required to maintain effectiveness?
BYSTANDER CPR FOR PEDIATRIC 
OHCA: CONSENSUS ON SCIENCE
A recent systematic review compared outcomes as-
sociated with bystander compression-only CPR with 
those of bystander CPR that included chest compres-
sions plus ventilation for pediatric OHCA.25 The review 
identified 2 large observational cohort studies, both 
using data from Japan’s nationwide All-Japan Utstein 
OHCA registry.52,53 This large mandatory registry in-
cludes all cardiac arrests in people of all ages in Japan 
and both cardiac and noncardiac (eg, trauma, hang-
ing, drowning, drug overdose, asphyxia, respiratory 
diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, malignant tumors) 
causes of arrest. As of 2017, it contains data from >1 
million cardiac arrests.
The Kitamura et al52 study includes 5170 events in 
children ≤17 years of age, including 2439 events in 
which bystander CPR was performed, captured from 
2005 through 2007. At the time of the study, resus-
citation guidelines in Japan were transitioning from 
a CV ratio of 15:2 to 30:2 for pediatric OHCA. The 
Goto et al53 study includes 5056 events in children 
<18 years of age, including 2722 events in which 
bystander CPR was performed, captured from 2008 
through 2010. At the time of the study, pediatric CPR 
guidelines in Japan recommended CPR that included 
ventilation with a CV ratio of 30:2. In addition, na-
tional implementation of a dispatch-assisted CPR pro-
gram was occurring.
The quality of evidence was downgraded to very 
low for the critical outcome of favorable neurologi-
cal function (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category 
[PCPC] 1 or 2) at 1 month.52,53 The quality of evidence 
for these studies was downgraded because of serious 
risk of bias (eg, potential variability between compari-
son groups, single-country/healthcare system registry, 
variability in protocols among fire/EMS departments), 
serious indirectness (ie, the CV ratio provided was not 
specifically described in the publications and had to be 
deduced from the description of the guidelines and 
recommendations that were reported to be used at 
the time of data collection), and serious imprecision 
(wide CIs). In the first study, in all children, survival with 
favorable neurological function (PCPC 1 or 2) was less 
likely among children receiving chest compression–
only CPR (RR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.29–0.73]; RD, 3.02 
percentage points [95% CI, 1.47–4.57]).52 After fur-
ther subgroup analysis by age, patients 1 to 17 years 
of age with bystander chest compression–only CPR 
had worse outcomes (RR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.28–0.75]; 
RD, 4.34 percentage points [95% CI, 1.95–6.73]). In 
infants, outcome was uniformly poor, and there was 
no demonstrable difference in favorable neurological 
function whether bystanders provided chest compres-
sion–only CPR or CPR with ventilation (RR, 0.39 [95% 
CI, 0.11–1.36]; RD, 1.31 percentage points [95% CI, 
−0.17 to 2.80]). The second study did not report results 
divided by age subgroups but identified fewer patients 
overall with favorable neurological function (PCPC 1 
or 2) in the chest compression–only CPR group than 
in those receiving CPR with a CV ratio of 30:2, (RR, 
0.45 [95% CI, 0.31–0.66]; RD, 3.30 percentage points 
[95% CI, 1.71–4.88]).53 These data were not published 
in the original article but were provided via e-mail from 
the corresponding author of the study (Y. Goto, MD, 
PhD, personal e-mail communication, unpublished 
data, May 2, 2014).
The quality of evidence was very low for the criti-
cal outcome of survival to 1 month.52,53 The quality of 
evidence for these studies was downgraded because of 
serious risk of bias, serious indirectness, and serious im-
precision (see reasons for downgrading given previous-
ly). In the Kitamura et al52 study, outcomes were worse 
for all children who received bystander chest com-
pression–only CPR compared with those who received 
CPR with ventilation (RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.60–0.97]; 
RD, 2.98 percentage points [95% CI, 0.45–5.51]). Af-
ter further subgroup analysis by age, patients 1 to 17 
years of age who received chest compression–only CPR 
had worse outcomes (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.53–0.93]; 
RD, 4.74 percentage points [95% CI, 1.17–8.31]). In 
infants, there was no demonstrable difference in sur-
vival to 1 month (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.56–1.45]; RD, 
0.74 percentage points [95% CI, −2.61 to 4.09]). In the 
Goto et al53 study, survival was worse among children 
who received chest compression–only CPR compared 
with those who received CPR with ventilation (RR, 0.56 
[95% CI, 0.45–0.69]; RD, 7.04 percentage points [95% 
CI, 4.50–9.58]). There was no subgroup analysis for dif-
ferent ages in this study.
Treatment Recommendations
We suggest that bystanders provide CPR with ven-
tilation for infants and children <18 years of age 
with OHCA (weak recommendation, very-low-quality 
 
evidence).
We continue to recommend that if bystanders cannot 
provide rescue breaths as part of CPR for infants and chil-

dren <18 years of age with OHCA, they should at least 
provide chest compressions (good practice statement). In 
the 2015 CoSTR, this was cited as a strong recommen-
dation but based on very-low-quality evidence.21,22
ADDITIONAL SCIENCE PUBLISHED 
SINCE THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS 
COMPLETED
After the systematic review was completed, 2 addition-
al relevant observational studies were published,54,55 
and they have informed the task force decision in its 
treatment recommendation.
Very-low-quality evidence was identified for the criti-
cal outcome of favorable neurological function (PCPC 1 
or 2) at hospital discharge.54 The GRADE quality for this 
study was downgraded for serious risk of bias (observa-
tional study with possible variability between compari-
son groups) and serious indirectness (specific CPR CV 
ratio not listed) from 1 cohort study. This study is from a 
voluntary American OHCA registry of nontraumatic car-
diac arrest that represents a catchment area of >90 mil-
lion people in 37 states. This study included 3900 events 
captured from 2013 through 2015 and compared the 
outcomes of children receiving either bystander chest 
compression–only CPR or bystander CPR with ventila-
tion for the 1411 children for whom data were available 
on the type of CPR provided. Data from eFigure 4 of 
this study indicate that there was no difference in favor-
able neurological function when infants who received 
chest compression–only CPR were compared with those 
who received CPR with ventilation (P=0.083), as well as 
no difference among children (1–17 years of age) who 
received chest compression–only CPR compared with 
those who received CPR with ventilation (P=0.117).54
Very-low-quality evidence has been identified for 
the critical outcome of favorable neurological function 
(PCPC 1 or 2) at 1 month.55 This study was another ob-
servational study from the all-Japan registry. The level of 
evidence for this study was downgraded for serious risk 
of bias (observational study with possible variability be-
tween comparison groups), serious indirectness (specif-
ic CPR CV ratio not listed), and very serious imprecision 
(very wide CI). This Japanese OHCA registry study (in-
cluding traumatic cardiac arrest) reported 2157 events 
in children >1 year (ie, no infants) and <18 years of 
age, captured from 2011 through 2012, and compared 
the outcomes of children receiving either bystander 
chest compression–only CPR or bystander CPR with 
ventilation for the 1150 children for whom data were 
available on the type of CPR provided. The study was 
performed at a time when Japan CPR guidelines recom-
mended a CV ratio of 30:2, and an established national 
dispatch-assisted CPR protocol existed. Favorable neu-
rological function was no different among children who 
received chest compression–only CPR and those who 
received CPR with ventilation (adjusted odds ratio, 1.52 
[95% CI, 0.93–2.49]).
Very-low-quality evidence has been identified for the 
critical outcome of survival to 1 month.55 The quality of 
evidence for this cohort study was downgraded for se-
rious risk of bias, serious indirectness, and very serious 
imprecision (see explanations given previously). In this 
study, 1-month survival in children (age, 1–18 years) 
was no different whether they received chest compres-
sion–only CPR or CPR with ventilation (adjusted odds 
ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 0.98–1.96]).
Very-low-quality evidence has been identified for the 
critical outcome of survival to hospital discharge.54 The 
quality of evidence for this cohort study was downgraded 
for serious risk of bias (observational study with possible 
variability between comparison groups). In infants with 
OHCA, survival to hospital discharge was worse in those 
receiving chest compression–only CPR compared with 
those receiving CPR with ventilation (P=0.002). Converse-
ly, for children ≥1 year of age, there was no difference in 
survival to hospital discharge in a comparison of those 
who received bystander chest compression–only CPR and 
those who received CPR with ventilation (P=0.258).
Values and Preferences
Bystander CPR improves survival, and CPR treatment 
recommendations should strive to enhance ease of 
CPR implementation and CPR effectiveness. Most pedi-
atric cardiac arrests are asphyxial in origin, so effective 
CPR is likely to require ventilation in addition to chest 
compressions. In making these recommendations, the 
task force placed a higher value on the importance of 
rescue breaths as part of pediatric CPR over a strategy 
that deemphasizes ventilation to simplify CPR instruc-
tions and skills. The 2 (observational) articles published 
since the completion of the systematic review suggest 
that survival and neurological outcome may not dif-
fer among children (ie, ≥1 year of age) who receive 
bystander compression-only CPR or CPR with ventila-
tion.54,55 This conclusion differs from previous evidence 
that suggested the superiority of CPR with ventilation 
for pediatric patients of all ages with OHCA.21,22,56 
Available data are now inconsistent and somewhat 
contradictory for the comparison of bystander com-
pression-only CPR and CPR with ventilation for infant 
(<1 year of age) OHCA. These discrepancies in find-
ings, especially those coming from the more recent 
publications, helped inform task force decisions with 
respect to the bystander CPR with ventilation versus 
compression-only CPR treatment recommendations 
and explain the rationale behind the task force’s deci-
sion to downgrade the strength of the treatment rec-
ommendation to the weaker terminology of suggests 
instead of the stronger term recommends. This relative

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
clinical equipoise should stimulate the development of 
prospective clinical trials to definitively determine the 
optimal bystander CPR technique for infants (<1 year 
of age) and children (≥1 year of age).
Despite the availability of only very-low-quality evi-
dence (analyzed as part of the 2015 ILCOR evidence 
evaluation process), the task force unanimously agreed 
to reiterate the 2015 strong treatment recommenda-
tion for providing any CPR (including compression-
only CPR) over no CPR for pediatric OHCA because 
the potential benefit outweighs any potential harm. 
Given that the systematic review did not seek data 
comparing any CPR with no CPR and in keeping with 
GRADE recommendations, our recommendation has 
been cited as a good practice statement (see Appen-
dixes 1 and 2).38
Knowledge Gaps
In order of priority, the top knowledge gaps for this 
topic are as follows:
1. More high-quality studies are needed to compare 
compression-only CPR and CPR with ventilation 
for infants and children with OHCA.
2. Data are needed from other resuscitation regis-
tries that will enable comparison of the role of 
ventilation with CPR because this varies world-
wide, largely on the basis of differences in local 
resuscitation council guidelines. This should also 
include subgroup analysis of different patient 
ages (eg, infancy, 1–8 years, >8 years) and causes 
of cardiac arrest.
3. Can telephone dispatchers coach bystanders to 
provide effective rescue breaths/CPR with ventila-
tion for infants and children?

Appendix 1. Glossary of Terms Used in This Summary
Advanced 
airway 
Tracheal tube or supraglottic airway
Compression-
only CPR 
Chest compressions without active ventilation (eg, 
mouth-to-mouth ventilation, bag-mask ventilation, or 
ventilation via an advanced airway)
CPR with 
ventilation
Chest compressions with PPV; this includes a variety 
of chest CV ratios and continuous chest compressions 
with ventilations delivered without pausing chest 
compressions.
Continuous 
chest 
compression 
CPR
Chest compressions delivered without pausing for 
ventilation. PPV may (often at 10 breaths per minute) or 
may not be provided. Maintenance of airway patency 
may enable passive ventilation.
Dispatch-
assisted CPR
A bystander provides CPR under telephone instruction 
by an EMS dispatcher, most often compression-only 
CPR. Alternative terminology for these dispatchers 
includes telecommunicators, ambulance communication 
officers, emergency medical communicators, and call 
handlers.
CPR indicates cardiopulmonary resuscitation; CV, compression-ventilation; 
EMS, emergency medical services; and PPV, positive-pressure ventilation.
Appendix 2. GRADE Terminology
Risk of bias
Study limitations in randomized trials include lack of 
allocation concealment, lack of blinding, incomplete 
accounting of patients and outcome events, selective 
outcome reporting bias, and stopping early for benefit. 
Study limitations in observational studies include 
failure to apply appropriate eligibility criteria, flawed 
measurement of exposure and outcome, failure to 
adequately control confounding, and incomplete 
follow-up.
Inconsistency
Criteria for inconsistency in results include the following: 
point estimates vary widely across studies; CIs show 
minimal or no overlap; statistical test for heterogeneity 
shows a low P value; and the I2 is large (a measure of 
variation in point estimates resulting from among-study 
differences).
Indirectness
Sources of indirectness include differences in population 
(eg, OHCA instead of in-hospital cardiac arrest, adults 
instead of children), differences in the intervention (eg, 
different CV ratios), differences in outcome, and indirect 
comparison.
Imprecision
Low event rates or small sample sizes will generally result 
in wide CIs and therefore imprecision.
Publication 
bias
Several sources of publication bias include tendency not 
to publish negative studies and influence of industry-
sponsored studies. An asymmetrical funnel plot increases 
suspicion of publication bias.
Good 
practice 
statements
Guideline panels often consider it necessary to issue 
guidance on specific topics that do not lend themselves 
to a formal review of research evidence. The reason might 
be that research into the topic is unlikely to be located 
or would be considered unethical or infeasible. Criteria 
for issuing a nongraded good practice statement include 
the following: overwhelming certainty that the benefits 
of the recommended guidance will outweigh harms and 
a specific rationale is provided; the statements should be 
clear and actionable to a specific target population; the 
guidance is deemed necessary and might be overlooked 
by some providers if not specifically communicated; and 
the recommendations should be readily implementable 
by the specific target audience to which the guidance is 
directed.
CI indicates confidence interval; CV, compression-ventilation; GRADE, 
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation; 
and OHCA, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

This table represents the relationships of writing group members that may be perceived as actual or reasonably perceived conflicts of interest as reported on 
the Disclosure Questionnaire, which all members of the writing group are required to complete and submit. A relationship is considered to be “significant” if 
(a) the person receives $10 000 or more during any 12-month period, or 5% or more of the person’s gross income; or (b) the person owns 5% or more of the 
voting stock or share of the entity, or owns $10 000 or more of the fair market value of the entity. A relationship is considered to be “modest” if it is less than 
“significant” under the preceding definition.
