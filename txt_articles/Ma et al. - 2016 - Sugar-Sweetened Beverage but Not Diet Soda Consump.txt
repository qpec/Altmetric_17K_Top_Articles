Abstract
Background: Previous studies have shown an inconsistent relation between habitual beverage consumption and insulin
resistance and prediabetes.
Objective: The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the consumption of sugar-sweetened
beverages (SSBs), rather than diet soda, is associated with long-term progression of insulin resistance and the
development of prediabetes.
Methods: We analyzed the prospective association between cumulative mean consumption of SSBs or diet soda and
incident prediabetes (n = 1685) identified across a median of 14 y of follow-up in participants [mean 6 SD age: 51.9 6
9.2 y; 59.6% women; mean 6 SD body mass index (BMI; kg/m2): 26.3 6 4.4] of the Framingham Offspring cohort. The
prospective association between beverage consumption and change in homeostasis model assessment of insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR; n = 2076) over ;7 y was also analyzed. The cumulative mean consumption of SSBs and diet soda
was estimated by using food-frequency questionnaires. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and linear
regression models were implemented to estimate the HRs of incident prediabetes and change in HOMA-IR, respectively.
Results: After adjustment for multiple potential confounders, including baseline BMI, we observed that SSB intake was
positively associated with incident prediabetes (P-trend < 0.001); the highest SSB consumers (>3 servings/wk; median:
6 servings/wk) had a 46% higher risk of developing prediabetes than did the SSB nonconsumers (HR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.16,
1.83). Higher SSB intake was also associated with a greater increase in HOMA-IR (P-trend = 0.006). No prospective
associations were observed between diet soda intake and risk of prediabetes (P-trend = 0.24) or changes in HOMA-IR
(P-trend = 0.25). These associations were similar after additional adjustment for change in BMI.
Conclusion: Regular SSB intake, but not diet soda intake, is associated with a greater increase in insulin resistance and a
higher risk of developing prediabetes in a group of middle-aged adults.

Introduction
Insulin resistance is a condition whereby the body�s sensitivity or
responsiveness to the hormone insulin is decreased, leading to
metabolic dysregulation (1). Insulin resistance is a major cause
of type 2 diabetes (T2D)9 and is a key feature of many other
cardiometabolic diseases (2). Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs),
sweetened with either sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup, are
the leading source of added sugars in the diets of American
adults (3). Current evidence has linked excess SSB consumption
to increased risk of T2D (4) and cardiovascular diseases (5).

 However, inconsistent findings have been observed with respect
to SSB consumption and insulin resistance. Some short-term
intervention studies found that high intakes of sucrose (6) or
fructose (7, 8) appear to reduce insulin sensitivity, whereas
others failed to show such effects (9, 10). Conflicting findings
have also emerged from observational studies that examined
habitual intakes of different types or sources of sugars and
HOMA-IR in adults (11–14) and children (15–17). Further-
more, to our knowledge, few studies have examined the long-
term association between SSB intake and the incidence of
prediabetes, separately from T2D, in healthy adults.
Diet sodas, sweetened by low-calorie or artificial sweeteners
in lieu of sugars, are often an alternative beverage to SSBs.
Although a few prospective studies have found a link between
diet soda intake and increased risk of T2D (18, 19), others
observed a nonsignificant association (20, 21). To our knowl-
edge, there is no prospective evidence that either supports or
rejects a relation between habitual diet soda consumption and
insulin resistance and prediabetes in adults.
Consequently, we hypothesized that the long-term intake of
SSBs is associated with greater increases in insulin resistance
and thus the development of prediabetes, whereas no such
associations exist with diet soda consumption. In the present
study, we tested this hypothesis by examining the longitudinal
association between the intake of SSBs or diet soda and change
in insulin resistance, as assessed by HOMA-IR, and incidence
of prediabetes.
Methods
Study sample. Study participants were from the Framingham Heart
Study�s Offspring cohort and have been previously described (22).
Participants in the Offspring cohort were evaluated every ;3–4 y. A total
of 3799 participants attended the fifth examination (baseline), of whom
3418 individuals had valid dietary data (Figure 1). In the present incident
prediabetes analyses, we used data from the fifth (1991–1995) to the
eighth (2005–2008) examinations. We excluded 303 participants who
did not report beverage exposures (n = 9) or who had T2D at baseline
(n = 294). For prediabetes, we additionally excluded 1430 participants
who had prediabetes at baseline (n = 949), who were missing prediabetes
status at baseline or follow-up (n = 165), who developed T2D during
follow-up (n = 68), or who were missing change in BMI (n = 207) or
other covariate data (n = 41) for a final sample of 1685 participants. In
analyses for changes in HOMA-IR, because insulin was measured only at
the fifth and seventh examinations, we excluded 860 participants with
missing data on HOMA-IR at the fifth and seventh examinations.
Participants who developed T2D after the baseline examination were
also excluded (n = 126). After excluding participants with missing
covariate or change in BMI data (n = 53), 2076 participants were
available for the analysis of changes in HOMA-IR. In secondary
analyses, we included those who developed T2D after baseline and
who had complete covariate data in the analysis for a composite end-
point of prediabetes and T2D (n = 1751) and for changes in HOMA-IR
(n = 2195). All participants provided written informed consent. The
Framingham Heart Study protocols and procedures were approved by
the Institutional Review Board for Human Research at Boston University
Medical Center, and the current analyses were approved by the Tufts
Medical Center and Tufts University Health Sciences Institutional
Review Board.
Dietary assessment. We used a semiquantitative 126-item FFQ to
assess the habitual dietary intakes of participants during the year
preceding each examination cycle (23). The FFQ consisted of a list of
foods with standard serving sizes and a selection of 9 frequency
categories ranging from none or <1 serving/mo to $6 servings/d. SSB
intake was captured by 4 FFQ items: 1) caffeinated colas with sugar,
2) caffeine-free colas with sugar, 3) other carbonated beverages with
sugar, and 4) fruit punch, lemonade, or other noncarbonated fruit drinks.
Diet soda intake was captured by 3 FFQ items: 1) low-calorie colas;
2) low-calorie, caffeine-free colas; and 3) other low-calorie carbonated
beverages. One serving of SSBs or diet soda is equivalent to 360 mL
(12 fluid ounces). The relative validity of the FFQ for beverage consump-
tion has been examined in other cohorts (23). The correlation coefficients
between intakes estimated from the FFQ and 7-d diet records for SSBs and
diet soda were 0.51 and 0.66, respectively.
Outcome measures and definitions. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
was measured by using a hexokinase reagent. Fasting plasma insulin
(FPI) was measured by standard RIAs at the fifth and seventh
examinations. The Coat-A-Count immunoassay (Diagnostic Products)
was used at the fifth examination, and the human-specific immunoassay
(Linco Research, Inc.) was used at the seventh examination. HOMA-IR
was calculated on the basis of FPI and FPG by using the formula by
Matthews et al. (24): FPG (mmol/L) 3 FPI (mU/mL)/22.5. Because
insulin was measured by using different approaches in the fifth and
seventh examinations, we did not calculate the change in HOMA-IR.
Instead, we used HOMA-IR measured at the seventh examination as the
primary outcome, adjusted for HOMA-IR measured at the fifth
examination in statistical models (see Statistical analysis).
At the baseline (fifth) examination, T2D was defined as an FPG
concentration $7 mmol/L, a 2-h oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT)
glucose concentration $11.1 mmol/L, or the reported use of hypogly-
cemic medications. At the baseline (fifth) examination, prediabetes was
defined as an FPG $5.6 and <7 mmol/L or a 2-h OGTT glucose
concentration $7.8 and <11.1 mmol/L without the use of hypoglycemic
medications. Because a 2-h OGTT was not conducted in follow-up visits
(sixth, seventh, and eighth examinations), we defined incident T2D as
the first occurrence of an FPG concentration $7 mmol/L or the use of
hypoglycemic medications, and incident prediabetes as the first occur-
rence of an FPG concentration $5.6 and <7 mmol/L in the absence of
the use of hypoglycemic medications at follow-up. This definition of
prediabetes excluded individuals who presented at a study examination
with T2D without presenting with prediabetes at an earlier examination.
Therefore, we also considered the incidence of a composite outcome of
prediabetes or T2D defined as the first occurrence of either prediabetes
or T2D at follow-up after exclusion of baseline prediabetes and T2D.
Anthropometric measurements and covariate assessment. At
each visit, participants underwent a physical examination with the use of
standard protocols and completed a medical history questionnaire. Waist
circumference was measured at the level of the umbilicus in the stand-
ing position. BMI was calculated as weight divided by height (kg/m2).
Participants who reported that they smoked regularly in the past year
were classified as current smokers. Physical activity level was calculated
on the basis of questionnaire-derived time spent performing the activity
in a typical day and the intensity of the activity (25). The 2010 Dietary
Guidelines Adherence Index (DGAI) was used to capture overall diet quality
(26). Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure $140 mm Hg,
diastolic blood pressure $90 mm Hg, or the use of antihypertensive
drugs (27).
Statistical analysis. To better estimate long-term consumption, cumu-
lative mean intakes of foods and beverages were calculated. For analyses
of HOMA-IR, the cumulative mean was calculated as the mean intake
reported at the fifth, sixth, and seventh examinations. For analyses of
incident prediabetes, the cumulative mean was calculated as the mean
intake reported at examinations up to and including the examination of
prediabetes diagnosis (e.g., fifth and sixth examinations for those who
developed prediabetes by the sixth examination; the fifth, sixth, and
seventh examinations for those who developed prediabetes by the
seventh examination). For those who did not develop prediabetes during
follow-up, the cumulative mean was calculated across all available
examination data. The cumulative mean intake of SSBs or diet soda was
then categorized into quartile categories.
HRs of incident prediabetes were estimated from multivariable
proportional hazards models. Person-time was calculated from baseline

 until the first occurrence of prediabetes or the end of follow-up. The
proportional hazards assumption was evaluated with a likelihood-ratio
test comparing the model with and without an interaction term between
time period and beverage category. In this analysis, covariates included
in the models were FPG at baseline, age, sex, current smoking status,
physical activity level, hypertension, BMI, DGAI, and intakes of energy,
alcohol, and fruit juice [servings/d (1 serving = 240 mL or 8 fluid
ounces)].
To estimate the change in insulin resistance, HOMA-IR assessed at
the seventh examination was treated as the response variable, whereas
HOMA-IR assessed at the fifth examination was adjusted for as a
covariate. The least-squares means of HOMA-IR across SSB or diet soda
quartile categories were calculated by using multiple linear regression
models, with additional adjustment for age, sex, current smoking status,
physical activity level, hypertension, BMI, DGAI, and intakes of energy,
alcohol, and fruit juice. In addition, in analyses for both HOMA-IR and
prediabetes, SSBs and diet soda were mutually adjusted (i.e., diet soda
was adjusted for in analyses for SSBs and vice versa). The change in BMI
during the follow-up period was additionally adjusted for in a separate
model. The P values for linear trend were computed by modeling the
median intake of beverage quartile categories as a continuous indepen-
dent variable.
In secondary analyses, DGAI was replaced by individual foods, includ-
ing coffee [servings/d (1 serving = 240 mL or 8 fluid ounces)], whole grains
(grams per day), vegetables (grams per day), red meat (grams per day),
fish (grams per day), and nuts (grams per day), to explore the potential
effects of specific food groups on the associations of beverages with the
outcomes. We repeated the above-mentioned analyses for HOMA-IR in
a study sample without excluding participants who developed T2D after
baseline (n = 2195). A composite endpoint of prediabetes or T2D was
also analyzed (n = 1751). In separate models, we adjusted for baseline
waist circumference and the change in waist circumference instead of
baseline BMI and change in BMI.
In all of the analyses, cumulative mean intakes for dietary covariates
were calculated by using the same method for beverage consumption as
mentioned above. Baseline data, except for change in BMI or change in waist
circumference, were used for nondietary covariates. All statistical analyses
were conducted using SAS statistical software (version 9.3; SAS Institute). A
2-tailed P < 0.05 was considered significant unless otherwise specified.
Results
Baseline sample characteristics. As shown in Table 1, higher
SSB consumers were more likely to be younger, men, current
smokers, and engaged in more physical activity, and to have higher
energy and fruit juice intakes and a less healthy diet as assessed
by the DGAI. In addition, SSB consumers were likely to have a
higher HOMA-IR at baseline. There was an inverse correlation
between SSBs and diet soda intake (r = –0.18, P < 0.001). Diet
soda consumers were slightly younger and less likely to smoke,
but there were no sex differences across diet soda consumption

 categories (Supplemental Table 1). Individuals with higher diet
soda consumption had a higher BMI, waist circumference,
fasting glucose, and HOMA-IR.
HRs of incident prediabetes. Among 1685 participants
without prediabetes at baseline, 823 went on to develop
prediabetes across 18,660 person-years of follow-up. As shown
in Table 2, after adjustment for age, sex, and dietary and other
potential confounders, those in the highest SSB consumption
category, who had a median intake of 6 servings/wk, had an
;46% higher risk (HR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.16, 1.83) of incident
prediabetes than did those in the lowest quartile category (es-
sentially nonconsumers of SSBs). The linear trend across increas-
ing quartile categories of SSBs was significant (P-trend < 0.001).
Adjustment for change in BMI did not substantively change the
results. In contrast, after adjusting for BMI and other covariates,
no significant association was observed between diet soda intake
and incident prediabetes (P-trend = 0.24). Compared with the
lowest quartile category, HRs (95% CIs) across the second
through the highest quartile categories were 0.87 (0.71, 1.07),
0.76 (0.63, 0.92), and 1.02 (0.85, 1.23), respectively. Further ad-
justment for change in BMI over the follow-up did not substan-
tially change the observed associations.
Change in insulin resistance. As shown in Table 3, higher SSB
intake was associated with a higher HOMA-IR at follow-up after
adjusting for baseline HOMA-IR and other potential confounders
(P-trend = 0.006). The adjusted geometric means (95% CIs) were
2.90 (2.79, 3.01), 2.94 (2.84, 3.05), 3.07 (2.96, 3.18), and 3.15
(3.02, 3.27) from the lowest to the highest categories of SSB intake,
respectively. Additional adjustment for change in BMI did not
materially alter the association. Diet soda intake was not
associated with changes in HOMA-IR after adjusting for BMI and
other potential confounders. Adjusted geometric mean (95% CI)
HOMA-IR values at follow-up across increasing diet soda quartile
categories were 2.96 (2.86, 3.05), 2.93 (2.81, 3.06), 3.12 (3.01,
3.23), and 3.04 (2.93, 3.15), respectively (P-trend = 0.25).
Secondary analyses. In secondary analyses, in which we
adjusted for individual foods rather than DGAI score, the
observed associations remained similar (Tables 2 and 3). In
addition, higher SSB intake was associated with a greater
incidence of the composite outcome of prediabetes or T2D
(Supplemental Table 2). Similarly, higher SSB intake was
associated with a stepwise increased HOMA-IR in 2195
participants, including those who developed T2D after baseline
(Supplemental Table 3). In analyses that substituted adjustment
for baseline waist circumference and change in waist circumfer-
ence for BMI and change in BMI, similar associations were
observed (data not shown).
Discussion
In this prospective cohort study in middle-aged adults, higher
SSB consumption was modestly associated with a higher
incidence of prediabetes and a greater increase in insulin
resistance as assessed by using HOMA-IR, after adjustment
for multiple confounders, including change in general adiposity.
In contrast, we observed no significant association between diet
soda intake and incident prediabetes or changes in HOMA-IR.
Therefore, our data suggest that regular SSB intake, but not diet
soda intake, is associated with increased insulin resistance and a
greater risk of developing prediabetes.
Several small randomized controlled trials examined the
potential effects of added sugar on insulin resistance. Under
conditions of weight maintenance, Black et al. (10) observed no
difference in insulin resistance after 6 wk (n = 13) on interven-
tion arms that provided 25% or 10% of total energy from
sucrose. However, a parallel randomized controlled trial in 37
overweight adults showed that, after adjustment for baseline
HOMA-IR and change in body weight, 10 wk of consuming a
high-sucrose (;25% energy from sucrose) ad libitum diet
significantly increased HOMA-IR compared with a diet in
which participants consumed artificial sweeteners (28).
To date, several observational studies in adults have exam-
ined the cross-sectional associations between intakes of SSBs
(11, 29), total sugar (12), sucrose (14), and fructose (13) and
HOMA-IR; the findings have been inconsistent, with some
observing a positive association (11, 13, 29), whereas others
found no association (12, 14). One recent meta-analysis, which

 summarized studies from 17 prospective cohorts, suggested that
an additional serving per day of SSBs is associated with an
;18% increased risk of developing T2D (30). Prospective
cohort studies of SSBs and diet soda in relation to HOMA-IR
and/or prediabetes in adults are scarce. A 2-y follow-up study in
children (n = 564, aged 8–10 y) observed that a higher intake of
added sugar from liquid sources was prospectively associated
with an increased HOMA-IR (15). The present longitudinal
study provides epidemiologic evidence that regular SSB
consumption may be associated with increased insulin resistance
in adults, although the observed difference in HOMA-IR between
regular SSB consumers and nonconsumers was relatively low,

 with an 8% higher HOMA-IR in the highest SSB consumers.
Nevertheless, our data also showed that regular SSB intake was
associated with a greater risk of developing prediabetes.
In the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, higher SSB
or soda intake was cross-sectionally associated with increased
insulin resistance (11) and a greater prevalence of a metaboli-
cally unhealthy phenotype (31); furthermore, combined SSB and
diet soda consumption was associated with a higher incidence of
impaired fasting glucose over 4 y (32). The current analysis
extends these previous studies by separately examining SSBs and
diet soda by using cumulative mean intake, thereby reducing
within-participant variability in dietary intake, as well as
extending the follow-up period to 14 y.
In the present study, we observed no significant association
between diet soda intake and HOMA-IR, an observation that is
consistent, for example, with findings from a small trial
conducted in 37 adults in whom no change in HOMA-IR was
observed after 10 wk of artificial sweetener consumption (28).
However, the role of artificial sweeteners in stimulating insulin
resistance is not conclusive. Although diet soda provides no
extra calories, it is thought that other mechanisms, such as
effects on enhancing appetite (33), may play a role in the
development of insulin resistance and/or diabetes; in fact, several
prospective cohort studies observed a direct association between
diet soda intake and the risk of T2D after adjustment for BMI
(18, 19). Thus, future studies are still needed to examine the
metabolic effects of diet soda.
The underlying mechanisms that link excess sugar intake and
insulin resistance are not completely understood, particularly
whether insulin resistance occurs due to sugar intake itself or by
weight gain caused by a positive energy balance. One potential
pathway by which excess sugar intake may mediate the
impairment of insulin sensitivity is through an increase in fat
synthesis in liver and adipose tissues. In the process of
lipogenesis, sugar may be converted to products such as
diacylglycerols that are harmful to insulin signaling (34). SSB
intake may also exert its influence on insulin resistance through
its potential role in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) deposition (35).
Excess FFAs released from enlarged VAT may directly flow
through the portal vein to induce hepatic insulin resistance (36).
Finally, adipokines secreted by adipose tissue, particularly VAT,
may trigger insulin resistance in liver and peripheral tissue (37).
The strengths of our study include its relatively novel
explorations of the long-term associations of SSB or diet soda
intake with insulin resistance and prediabetes, as opposed to the
more typically evaluated incident T2D. The study used a
prospective design and comprehensive dietary, lifestyle, and
clinical data collected in a well-characterized subgroup of the
Framingham Heart Study. With respect to limitations, insulin
was measured by using different assays at baseline and follow-
up; we, therefore, could not calculate the change in HOMA-IR
directly. In addition, using different assays may lead to misclas-
sification of insulin resistance. However, our finding on HOMA-
IR was supported by that of incident prediabetes. Although we
adjusted for a variety of dietary and lifestyle factors, residual
confounding cannot be ruled out due to the observational nature
of this study. We evaluated only diet soda, not the consumption
of other low- or noncalorie or artificially sweetened beverages,
which were not uniformly assessed in the FFQ. Compared with
those excluded from the analysis (i.e., those without prediabetes
and/or with missing data), participants who were analyzed in the
present study were younger and more likely to be women, had
lower BMIs and waist circumferences, and had a better
cardiometabolic profile (Supplemental Table 4). Therefore, this
may limit the generalizability of our observations to other
populations. In addition, the majority of our study population
was middle-aged and white, which may minimize confounding
from race/ethnicity and socioeconomic factors but may also
limit the generalizability.
Our data suggest that the long-term consumption of SSBs
predicts increased insulin resistance and a higher risk of
developing prediabetes, independent of body weight. In con-
trast, long-term diet soda intake was not associated with
elevated insulin resistance or prediabetes risk. Although these
observational data provide further evidence to support the
association between daily SSB consumption and increased
cardiometabolic risk, well-designed metabolically controlled
intervention trials with sufficient power and duration are
required to further examine how SSB intake may influence
insulin resistance and its underlying mechanisms.
