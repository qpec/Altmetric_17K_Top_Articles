Abstract
Weight changes are accompanied by imbalances between calorie intake and expenditure. This fact 
is often misinterpreted to suggest that obesity is caused by gluttony and sloth and can be treated by 
simply advising people to eat less and move more. However, various components of energy 
balance are dynamically interrelated and weight loss is resisted by counterbalancing physiological 
processes. While low-carbohydrate diets have been suggested to partially subvert these processes 
by increasing energy expenditure and promoting fat loss, our meta-analysis of 32 controlled 
feeding studies with isocaloric substitution of carbohydrate for fat found that both energy 
expenditure (26 kcal/d; P <.0001) and fat loss (16 g/d; P <.0001) were greater with lower fat diets. 
We review the components of energy balance and the mechanisms acting to resist weight loss in 
the context of static, settling point, and set-point models of body weight regulation, with the set-
point model being most commensurate with current data.

Obesity is often described as a disorder of energy balance arising from consuming calories 
in excess to the energy expended to maintain life and perform physical work. While this 
energy balance concept is a useful framework for investigating obesity, it does not provide a 
causal explanation for why some people have obesity or what to do about it.
In particular, obesity prevention is often erroneously portrayed as a simple matter of 
bookkeeping whereby calorie intake must be balanced by calorie expenditure.1 Under this 
“calories in, calories out” model, treating obesity amounts to advising people to simply eat 
less and move more, thereby tipping the scales of calorie balance and resulting in steady 
weight loss that accumulates according to the widely known, but erroneous, 3500 kcal per

 pound rule.2,3 Therefore, failure to experience substantial weight loss implies that an 
individual lacks the willpower to adhere to a modest lifestyle intervention over a sufficient 
period of time.
However, this naïve view is incorrect because it considers energy intake and expenditure to 
be independent parameters that can be adjusted at will and thereafter remain static without 
being influenced by homeostatic signals related to weight loss.3 We now understand that 
energy intake and expenditure are interdependent variables that are dynamically influenced 
by each other and body weight.4 Attempts to alter energy balance through diet or exercise 
are countered by physiological adaptations that resist weight loss.5
This review focuses on our current understanding of the components of human energy 
balance and the counterbalancing physiological processes that act to resist weight loss. 
Furthermore, we address the question of whether all diet calories are created equal regarding 
the effects of carbohydrate, fat, and protein on energy balance, body weight, and 
composition. Finally, we compare 3 conceptual models of energy balance regulation and 
examine the implications for human body weight dynamics and the treatment of obesity.
Components of Daily Energy Expenditure
There are 3 components of daily energy expenditure: the thermic effect of food, physical 
activity expenditure, and resting energy expenditure (REE) (Figure 1A).
Thermic Effect of Food
The smallest component of daily energy expenditure in humans is the thermic effect of food 
(also called diet induced thermogenesis or specific dynamic action), which is defined as the 
increase of metabolic rate observed for several hours following the ingestion of a meal.6,7 
The thermic effect of food is believed to represent the energy cost of digestion, absorption, 
storage, and metabolic fate of dietary macronutrients.7 While the precise mechanisms 
underlying the thermic effect of food are not fully understood, there is a clear macronutrient 
hierarchy, with protein causing a greater energy expenditure increment than carbohydrate. 
which is greater than that of fat.7 For typical diet compositions, the thermic effect of food is 
approximated to be about 10% of energy intake (Figure 1A).
Resting Energy Expenditure
REE corresponds to the energy expended when not performing physical work and is 
typically the largest contribution to daily energy expenditure. Contrary to popular belief, 
people with obesity generally have a higher absolute REE (Figure 1A).8 It has long been 
recognized that fat-free mass comprises the metabolically active tissues of the body and 
therefore contributes more to REE than body fat. Fat-free mass is elevated in obesity, along 
with body fat, resulting in increased REE compared with lean subjects (Figure 1B). Across a 
wide range of weights, REE is linearly related to both fat-free mass and body fat,8 such that 
the elevated REE with obesity is generally in line with what is expected for the body weight 
and composition.

 While fat-free mass, and to a lesser extent fat mass, are good predictors of REE, these 
variables explain only about 70% of inter-individual REE variability, such that for a given 
body composition the REE residual standard deviation is about 300 kcal/d.8 Because the 
organs that contribute to the fat-free mass have a wide range of metabolic rates,9 some of the 
residual REE variability after accounting for body fat and fat-free mass may be caused by 
variations in organ masses. Magnetic resonance imaging methodologies have been used to 
quantify organ sizes and REE prediction equations that sum the individual metabolic rates of 
various organs explain about 80% of the REE variability.10,11
Another potentially important contributor to REE involves fluxes through various energy-
requiring metabolic pathways. Major macronutrient fluxes such as gluconeogenesis, de novo 
lipogenesis, triglyceride synthesis, and protein turnover all require energy and these flux 
rates can be significantly influenced by both the energy content of the diet as well as its 
composition.12
Physical Activity Expenditure
Physical activity expenditure can be subdivided into volitional exercise and the activities of 
daily living, also called spontaneous physical activity or non-exercise activity 
thermogenesis. The energy expended in physical activities is determined by their duration 
and intensity in proportion to overall body weight.13 Thus, despite typically being less 
physically active, people with obesity often have similar daily energy costs for physical 
activity as those without obesity (Figure 1A)14 and physical activity energy expenditure 
declines with weight loss unless its quantity or intensity increases to compensate.
Influence of Exercise on Energy Expenditure and Body Weight
While often considered a first-line treatment option for obesity, large amounts of exercise are 
required to result in a modest degree of average weight loss.15 However, exercise results in 
preferential loss of body fat and maintenance of fat-free mass compared with diet-induced 
weight loss.16,17 but exercise does not appear to prevent the slowing of metabolic rate during 
weight loss.18 Exercise interventions typically result in less average weight loss than 
expected, based on the exercise calories expended, and individual weight changes are highly 
variable even when exercise is supervised to ensure adherence.19 A likely explanation for 
these observations is that the energy expended during exercise is variably compensated by 
changes in food intake and non-exercise physical activity behaviors.19
The recently proposed “constrained energy expenditure model” provides an alternative 
explanation for why exercise interventions often result in minimal weight loss.20 According 
to this model, daily energy expenditure is regulated and increments in physical activity 
expenditure are predicted to be offset by decreases in non-physical activity expenditure (ie, 
the thermic effect of food or REE) resulting in minimal energy imbalance. The experimental 
basis of the constrained energy expenditure model in humans includes cross-sectional data 
demonstrating that free-living daily energy expenditure adjusted for body composition is 
relatively constant for a wide range of physical activity levels measured using 
accelerometry.21,22 Furthermore, longitudinal data have found that progressive increases in

 the quantity and intensity of aerobic exercise training do not lead to corresponding increases 
in total daily energy expenditure in ad libitum-fed men and women.23
However, in contrast to the predictions of the constrained energy expenditure model, 
exercise training does not lead to decreased REE under conditions of weight stability24 and 
REE adjusted for body composition is not different between people with a wide range of 
physical activity levels.21 Furthermore, exercise may actually increase the thermic effect of 
food.6 Therefore, when physical activity increases via exercise, the non-physical activity 
components of daily energy expenditure do not decrease as predicted by the constrained 
model.
Finally, increments in daily energy expenditure shortly after starting an exercise program can 
be greater than the expected energy cost of the exercise.23 Subsequent failure to increase 
daily expenditure as training progresses, despite increasing exercise volume and intensity, 
may be because of improvements in biomechanical efficiency that decrease the energy cost 
of exercise.23
Influence of Energy Intake on Energy Expenditure
Reductions in energy intake lead to decreased energy expenditure to a degree that is often 
greater than expected based on changes in body composition or the thermic effect of 
food.25,26 This phenomenon has been called adaptive thermogenesis or metabolic adaptation 
and it may continue for years after energy balance is reestablished at a lower weight,27–29 
although controversy remains regarding its persistence.30,31 The mechanistic basis of 
metabolic adaptation is unclear, but it may be related to reduced sympathetic drive or 
blunted thyroid activity, possibly as a result of decreased leptin.25,32–36
Experimental quantification of metabolic adaptation depends on calculating the residual 
difference between measured and expected values of energy expenditure.37,38 However, the 
expected energy expenditure is typically calculated based on observed body fat and fat-free 
mass changes and typically ignores factors like organ sizes or altered fluxes through energy-
requiring metabolic pathways. Whether such considerations can explain the observed 
adaptations in energy expenditure is presently unclear.
Metabolic adaptation can be interpreted teleologically as the body’s response to a perceived 
state of starvation by decreasing the energy cost of living in an attempt to prolong life given 
the body’s finite energy stores. In this context, it is interesting that the robustness of 
metabolic adaptation does not appear to be attenuated by the quantity of stored energy such 
that people with obesity, who have very large energy reserves, experience decreases in 
energy expenditure that are similar in magnitude to those having dramatically fewer energy 
reserves (Figure 1C).39
In contrast to the growing consensus supporting the existence of important metabolic 
adaptations to underfeeding and weight loss, the adaptive response to over-feeding and 
weight gain is less clear.26 While some investigators have observed that overfeeding induces 
highly variable increases in spontaneous physical activity expenditure that may be greater 
than expected based on the observed weight changes,39–41 others have found that the

 increased energy expenditure associated with overfeeding is in accord with the expected 
increased thermic effect of food, along with increased REE and physical activity expenditure 
based on the observed weight gain.14,26
The effect of energy intake changes on energy expenditure and body weight have recently 
been incorporated within dynamic mathematical models in both adults42 and children43 to 
replace the static “calories in, calories out” model that erroneously assumed independence of 
energy intake and expenditure.44 Mathematical models have been used to calculate the so-
called “energy gap” required to reverse obesity, which amounts to about 200–250 kcal/d for 
both adults and children at the population level,44 and have been used to estimate the 
potential effects of policy changes on overweight and obesity prevalence.45
Influence of Dietary Macronutrients on Energy Balance and Body 
Composition
The energy released during carbohydrate, fat, and protein oxidation within the body can be 
equated to the energy derived from their combustion in a bomb calorimeter, with suitable 
corrections for the differing thermodynamic constraints and the end products of the 
reactions. In other words, “a calorie is a calorie” when macronutrients are oxidized either in 
the bomb calorimeter through combustion or via the intricate biochemical pathways of 
oxidative phosphorylation inside cells.
However, thermodynamic arguments alone do not necessarily imply that “a calorie is a 
calorie” when it comes to the effects of diet composition on body weight or composition. 
Isocaloric diets differing in macronutrient composition may result in preferential partitioning 
of energy storage toward body fat and away from body protein. Such energy partitioning 
differences over the long term will alter the proportions of body fat and fat-free mass and 
thereby influence energy expenditure. Dietary protein in particular is known to positively 
influence fat-free mass during weight loss46,47 and weight gain.48 A recent meta-analysis 
found that dietary protein resulted in a small positive influence on REE during reduced-
calorie, low-fat diets amounting to about 150 kcal/d.49 Overfeeding with higher protein diets 
also led to small increases in REE and increases in daily energy expenditure,48 as did weight 
loss maintenance diets with higher protein.50
While higher protein diets appear to offer advantages regarding energy expenditure and body 
composition, the relative effects of dietary carbohydrate and fat are debated. According to 
the popular “carbohydrate-insulin model” of obesity, diets high in carbohydrate are 
conjectured to be particularly fattening because of their propensity to elevate insulin 
secretion, thereby directing fat toward storage in adipose tissue and away from oxidation by 
metabolically active tissues, leading to an adaptive decrease in metabolic rate.51,52 In 
contrast, because dietary fat does not stimulate insulin secretion, isocaloric diets lower in 
carbohydrate but higher in fat reduce insulin secretion, thereby promoting fat loss from 
adipose tissue, making free-fatty acids available for use by metabolically active tissues. The 
increased fuel availability theoretically leads to increased metabolic rate with a net 
“metabolic advantage” of very low carbohydrate diets amounting to as much as 400–600 
kcal/d of additional energy expenditure.53

 Such large increases in daily energy expenditure could explain why low carbohydrate diets 
that are unrestricted in calories typically result in greater short-term weight loss compared 
with reduced energy, low-fat diets.54–56 Indeed, the original Atkins diet that restricted 
dietary carbohydrates, but not calories, promised its followers a “high calorie way to stay 
thin forever” as a result of increased energy expenditure.57 Unfortunately, the experimental 
evidence does not support such a metabolic advantage.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects on daily energy 
expenditure and body fat of isocaloric diets differing in their fraction of carbohydrate to fat 
but with equal protein. To minimize confounding by dietary nonadherence, we included only 
controlled feeding studies where all food was provided to the subjects. We found 32 studies 
representing 563 subjects matching our inclusion criteria with dietary carbohydrate ranging 
from 1%–83% and dietary fat ranging from 4%–84% of total calories (see Supplementary 
Materials).
Figure 2A shows the daily energy expenditure differences between isocaloric diets with 
equal protein but differing in the ratio of carbohydrate to fat. The pooled weighted mean 
difference in energy expenditure was 26 kcal/d (P <.0001) greater with lower fat diets. 
Figure 2B shows differences in the rate of body fat change between diets with the pooled 
weighted mean difference of 16 g/d (P <.0001) greater body fat loss in favor of the lower fat 
diets. These results are in the opposite direction to the predictions of the carbohydrate-
insulin model, but the effect sizes are so small as to be physiologically meaningless. In other 
words, for all practical purposes “a calorie is a calorie” when it comes to body fat and 
energy expenditure differences between controlled isocaloric diets varying in the ratio of 
carbohydrate to fat.
Nevertheless, it is possible that isocaloric diets differing in carbohydrate and fat may have 
overall health effects unrelated to total body fat or energy expenditure.58 For example, 
dietary carbohydrates may play an important role in determining the anatomic location of 
body fat stores, with diets higher in refined carbohydrate possibly leading to increased 
visceral and liver fat.59,60
Diet composition may also influence energy intake when the amount of the diet consumed is 
not controlled. For example, increasing dietary fat results in greater energy intake61,62 and 
decreasing dietary fat has the opposite effect.63,64 However, very low carbohydrate, high-fat 
diets may reduce appetite by promoting an increase in circulating ketones,65 although the 
mechanism for this effect is unclear.66 Furthermore, low carbohydrate diets often increase 
protein intake, which may independently increase satiety and decrease overall energy 
intake.46,47 These effects may help explain the short-term benefits for weight loss of lower 
carbohydrate, higher protein diets.54–56
However, long-term weight loss diet studies targeting different macronutrients demonstrate 
similar mean body weight trajectories corresponding to a similar exponential decay of diet 
adherence with all diets.67 The reasons for the long-term erosion of diet adherence are not 
well understood. Likely factors include practical challenges in sustaining diet changes in the 
face of engrained food habits developed over years of living in an obesogenic

 environment,68 as well as the likelihood that feedback control of energy intake makes it 
difficult to persistently resist an ever-increasing appetite as weight is lost.
Feedback Control of Energy Intake
While there is a growing consensus that human energy expenditure is actively controlled to 
resist weight loss,26 the evidence for active control of energy intake is less clear. 
Observations regarding long-term precision of calorie balance and relative weight stability 
have been offered in support of energy intake feedback control, but these observations also 
have alternative explanations69–71 relying solely on energy expenditure adaptations and 
correspond to a “settling point” model of body weight regulation.72
However, the molecular mechanisms of appetite regulation strongly suggest that feedback 
control of energy intake acts as part of a complex neurobiological system integrating social 
and environmental influences with homeostatic signals related to body weight, such as 
leptin, to control both short-term feeding behavior and long-term energy intake.73,74
Establishing that energy intake is under active control in humans is challenging under 
laboratory conditions and extremely difficult under free-living conditions. Accurate 
measurements of energy intake in the laboratory have demonstrated that diet manipulations 
can lead to short-term compensatory changes in energy intake.61,62,75,76 and hyperphagia 
has been demonstrated following experimental semi-starvation77 and short-term 
underfeeding,78–80 possibly resulting from homeostatic signals arising from loss of both 
body fat and lean tissues.81,82 However, these results cannot be readily extrapolated to the 
long time scales associated with regulation of human energy balance in the real world.83 
Indeed, free-living energy intake fluctuates widely from day to day and exhibits little short-
term correlation with energy expenditure or body weight.69,84
Therefore, investigating the control of energy intake requires obtaining accurate food intake 
measurements in free-living people over long time scales, which has been a major 
challenge.85–87 Furthermore, measuring the strength of the energy intake feedback circuit 
requires a means of covertly perturbing energy expenditure over extended time periods and 
measuring the resulting energy intake response. These problems were recently addressed and 
the strength of the long-term energy intake feedback control circuit was quantified for the 
first time in humans.88
A validated mathematical method89 using repeated body weight measurements calculated 
the long-term changes in energy intake in patients with type 2 diabetes who were treated for 
1 year with an inhibitor of the renal sodium glucose transporter type-2, causing a substantial 
increase in the amount of glucose excreted in the urine.88 The loss of glucose calories 
occurred without the subjects being directly aware of the calorie deficit and resulted in 
gradual weight loss. The subjects were found to progressively increase average energy intake 
by about 100 kcal/d per kilogram of lost weight – an effect more than 3-fold larger than the 
corresponding energy expenditure adaptations to weight loss.88

 Static, Settling Point, and Set-Point Models of Human Body Weight 
Regulation
Long-term feedback control of energy intake and expenditure has profound implications for 
body weight regulation and our understanding of obesity treatment. Without such feedback 
control mechanisms, body weight dynamics correspond to the static “calories in, calories 
out” model, where energy intake and expenditure are independent variables and weight 
changes, or related homeostatic signals like leptin, are assumed to have negligible effects on 
energy intake or expenditure.
Figure 3A illustrates the body weight dynamics of the static model simulating a 90-kg man 
eating and expending 3200 kcal/d for 1 year, followed by a year of cutting 300 kcal from his 
daily diet and then a final year consuming the original 3200 kcal/d diet. The horizontal lines 
depicted in the top panel of Figure 3A indicate that energy intake and expenditure have no 
relationship to weight, and the solid lines overlap in energy balance. When intake is reduced 
(dashed line, top panel) energy imbalance is determined by the distance to the expenditure 
line and is equal at all weights (top panel). The constant energy imbalance (middle panel) 
results in a constant rate of weight loss (bottom panel) until resumption of the original 3200 
kcal/d diet reestablishes energy balance at a stable lower body weight for the final year.
Because expenditure is erroneously considered to be constant, the static model provides 
unrealistic predictions for the expected weight loss for a given diet intervention. 
Furthermore, the static model ignores the difficulties of maintaining lost weight because the 
same baseline energy intake allows for maintenance of the reduced weight. Despite such 
obvious errors, the static model continues to be used both individuals2 and populations44 to 
predict weight changes.
Figure 3B illustrates the negative feedback effect of increasing energy expenditure with 
body weight (with a slope of about 20–30 kcal/d per kg39,42 as depicted in the top panel) 
corresponding to a “settling point” model.72 The stable body weight is determined by the 
intersection between the increasing expenditure line and the horizontal energy intake line 
assumed to be weight independent. When the same 300 kcal/d is cut from the diet, 
corresponding to a shift of the energy intake line downwards (dashed line, top panel), energy 
imbalance decreases (middle panel) along with weight (bottom panel) in an exponential 
fashion and it takes years to equilibrate at a stable lower weight.42 Once the energy intake 
line is shifted upwards to baseline, weight regain ensues with an exponential time course 
mirroring the weight loss phase.
Finally, Figure 3C illustrates the “set point” model that includes feedback control of both 
energy intake and expenditure,72 with energy intake being a decreasing function of weight 
(with a slope of about -100 kcal/d per kg88 as shown in the top panel). An intervention that 
shifts the energy intake line downwards by the same 300 kcal/d (dashed line, top panel) now 
results in a transient decrease in energy intake that subsequently increases exponentially 
because of escalating appetite as weight decreases along with a parallel decline in energy 
expenditure (middle panel).

 The time scale to equilibrate at the lower weight (bottom panel) is greatly abbreviated 
compared with the settling point model, resulting in a weight loss plateau after about 6 
months with no further weight loss despite continued intervention. This aligns closely to the 
typical weight plateau after about 6 months of starting a weight loss intervention.90 After the 
intervention is stopped, energy intake increases transiently above baseline, similar to what 
has been observed after periods of enforced calorie restriction,77–80 and weight is promptly 
regained.
In addition to the long-term feedback control of energy intake mediated by homeostatic 
signals related to body weight and composition, eating behavior is also strongly influenced 
by social and environmental influences in conjunction with learned eating habits.73,74 While 
previous conceptions of the set point model were thought to be incompatible with non-
homeostatic influences on food intake and body weight,72 such effects can be naturally 
incorporated by altering the position or slope of the energy intake line depicted in Figure 3A 
and the defended body weight will be adjusted accordingly.
Unfortunately, we do not yet know the quantitative effects of non-homeostatic influences on 
the set point model, but there is likely to be a wide degree of individual variation. Some 
people may experience substantial changes in the energy intake, along with correspondingly 
large weight changes, whereas others will be more resistant. Re-engineering the social and 
food environments may facilitate shifts in the energy intake line, but losing weight and 
keeping it off using willpower alone to reduce energy intake is difficult because considerable 
effort is required to persistently resist the physiological adaptations that act to increase 
appetite and suppress energy expenditure.

 Figure 1. 
Components of human energy expenditure and body composition in average 100-kg and 70-
kg men. (A) Daily energy expenditure comprises the energy cost of digesting and processing 
food, called the thermic effect of food, the energy expended in physical activity, and the 
energy expended at rest to maintain life. People with obesity have a higher thermic effect of 
food because of greater food intake. Furthermore, people with obesity may expend more 
energy for physical activity despite typically moving around less than a lean individual 
because physical activity expenditure is proportional to body weight. Energy expended at 
rest is also greater in people with obesity because they have more metabolically active fat-
free mass in addition to greater body fat as depicted in (B). (C) Body fat represents the vast 
majority of energy stores in the body compared with the energy content of body protein and 
glycogen. People with obesity can have vast quantities of stored energy in the form of body 
fat that represents several months of energy expenditure.

Meta-analysis of controlled isocaloric feeding studies with constant dietary protein and 
varying ratios of carbohydrate to fat. Studies are ordered from top to bottom according to the 
largest difference in carbohydrate between diet comparisons. Effect size (ES), upper and 
lower 95% confidence limits (UCL and LCL, respectively) are indicated for the differences 
in daily energy expenditure (A) and rate of body fat change (B). The pooled weighted mean 
difference across studies demonstrated small differences in daily energy expenditure (26 
kcal/d, P <.0001) and body fat change (16 g/d, P <.0001) favoring lower fat diets

 Figure 3. 
Comparison of static, settling point, and set point models of body weight regulation in a 
simulated 90-kg man. (A) The static model assumes that energy intake (blue) and 
expenditure (red) are independent quantities that do not depend on body weight, as shown 
by the horizontal lines in the top panel. For the first year, energy intake and expenditure are 
assumed to be balanced and correspond to overlapping solid lines. At the end of the first 
year, the energy intake line is shifted downward by 300 kcal/d to the dashed blue line 
corresponding with the start of a weight loss intervention indicated by (1). Because energy 
expenditure is assumed to be constant, a constant energy deficit is achieved (top and middle 
panels) resulting in a linear rate of weight loss (bottom panel). At the start of the second year 
(2), the intervention is stopped and the dashed energy intake curve shifts back to the solid 
baseline intake line and weight loss is maintained. (B) The settling point model assumes that 
energy expenditure is an increasing function of body weight whereas energy intake is 
independent of weight (top panel). Shifting the intake curve down by the same 300 kcal/d 
after the first year (1) results in an energy deficit that decreases in proportion to weight lost 
(top panel) resulting in an exponential decay of the energy deficit over time (middle panel). 
Body weight falls according to a parallel exponential pattern and it takes years to reach a 
new equilibrium weight (bottom panel). At the beginning of the second year (2), the energy 
intake curve is shifted upward (top panel) and energy intake increases (middle panel), 
generating an energy surplus that results in an exponential pattern of weight regain mirroring 
prior weight loss. (C) The set point model assumes that both energy intake and expenditure 
are functions of body weight (top panel) and the same 300 kcal/d shift in the energy intake 
curve (top panel) results in an initial decrease in energy intake that subsequently 
exponentially increases (middle panel) as weight is lost and energy expenditure decreases.

 Body weight is lost in an abbreviated exponential pattern and achieves a new equilibrium 
after about 6 months and no further loss occurs despite the continued intervention (bottom 
panel). At the start of the second year (2), the energy intake curve shifts to baseline (top 
panel) and leads to transient hyperphagia (middle panel) and rapid weight regain (bottom 
panel).
