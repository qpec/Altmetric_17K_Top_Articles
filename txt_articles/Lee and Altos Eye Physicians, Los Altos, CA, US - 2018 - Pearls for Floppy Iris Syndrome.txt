Pearls for Floppy Iris Syndrome

ntraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS) increases the potential for problems during cataract surgery. Although most strongly associated 
with tamsulosin, cataract surgeons should be aware of other medications that may cause IFIS. Pharmacologic techniques such as 
intracameral phenylephrine or epinephrine can improve dilation and iris stability. Mechanical strategies include viscomydriasis and 
devices like iris hooks or the Malyugin Ring® (MicroSurgical Technology, Inc., Redmond, WA, US). A careful history to elucidate patients’ risk 
for IFIS may be the most important step of all, as surgeon preparedness is probably the most significant way to lower risk of complications.

Small pupils present a significant challenge for the cataract surgeon, requiring excellent intraoperative 
decision making to maximize the likelihood of a successful outcome. One of the common causes 
of small pupils, intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS), in particular increases the likelihood 
of complications such as posterior capsule rupture and iris trauma. Fortunately, a variety of 
pharmacologic and mechanical strategies are available to help maintain an adequately dilated pupil 
to increase the likelihood of successful, safe cataract surgery.
IFIS was first described in association with current or prior tamsulosin (Flomax®, Boehringer Ingelheim, 
Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany; Ridgefield, CT, US) use in 2005.1 Besides poor preoperative pupil dilation, 
severe IFIS exhibits a triad of intraoperative signs: (1) iris billowing and floppiness, (2) iris prolapse to 
the incisions, and (3) progressive intraoperative miosis (Figure 1). However, there is a wide range of 
clinical severity. IFIS can be graded as mild (good dilation; some iris billowing without prolapse or 
constriction), moderate (iris billowing with some constriction of a moderately dilated pupil), or severe.2 
In a prospective study of 167 eyes in patients taking tamsulosin, 10% had no IFIS, 17% mild IFIS, 30% 
moderate IFIS, and 43% severe IFIS.2 Poor preoperative pupil dilation and iris billowing during instillation 
of intracameral lidocaine are predictive of greater IFIS severity.2–5 Numerous studies have confirmed 
that unexpected IFIS increases the rate of cataract surgical complications.2,3,6–9 A retrospective study 
of nearly 100,000 surgeries in male patients with cataracts reported a two-fold increase in the rate of 
serious postoperative complications including retinal detachment, retained nuclear fragments, and 
severe inflammation in patients taking tamsulosin.6
IFIS has since been documented with other systemic alpha-1 antagonists such as doxazosin (Cardura®, 
Pfizer, New York, NY, US), terazosin (Hytrin®, Abbott, Chicago, IL, US), and alfuzosin (Uroxatral®, Sanofi 
Aventis, Paris, France), all of which are non-selective alpha-1 antagonists.3 A number of retrospective 
and prospective studies have also shown that the frequency and severity of IFIS is much higher with 
tamsulosin than non-selective alpha-1 antagonists.3,4,6–8,10,11 Silodosin (Rapaflo®, Allergan, Irvine, CA, US) 
is a systemic selective alpha-1A blocker that is similar to tamsulosin in its strong propensity to cause 
IFIS. Ophthalmologists should also know that Jalyn® (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK) is the brand name 
for the combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin.
The surgeon should assess the quality of dilation during the presurgical examination, but a careful 
history is also important to reduce the likelihood of unexpected intraoperative miosis. In fact, even 
female patients are now treated with tamsulosin for urinary problems.12
Unfortunately, stopping tamsulosin preoperatively is of questionable value.2 Preoperative counseling 
with high-risk patients should occur to discuss the risk of IFIS and subsequent iris and pupil changes.
Intracameral injection of alpha agonists such as phenylephrine or epinephrine, as first reported by 
Gurbaxani & Packard and Shugar, respectively, is a safe and inexpensive strategy for IFIS (Figure 
2).13–15 Healon 5® (2.3% sodium hyaluronate; Abbott Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA, US) is a maximally

cohesive single agent that is particularly well suited for viscomydriasis and 
for blocking the iris from prolapsing in IFIS, as first suggested by Osher & 
Koch.16 In the tamsulosin versus alfusosin study, moderate to severe IFIS 
was present in 12.4% of control eyes performed without epinephrine in 
the irrigating fluid, demonstrating for the first time the beneficial impact of 
having epinephrine in the irrigating fluid during phaco.5
Pupil expansion rings are disposable devices that mechanically expand 
and maintain the intraoperative pupil diameter. The semicircular 
Morcher® 5S Pupil Dilator (FCI Ophthalmics, Pembroke, MA, US) and 
the Perfect Pupil® (Milvella, Savage, MN) are grooved polymethyl 
methacrylate (PMMA) rings.17,18 Alternatives include the APX 200 (FCI 
Ophthalmics, Pembroke, MA, US) and Graether pupil expander (Eagle 
Vision, Memphis, TN, US).19 All of these devices are relatively difficult to 
position if the pupil is less than 4 mm wide or if the anterior chamber 
is shallow. They will fail to engage the iris if the pupil diameter is larger 
than 7 mm.
The Malyugin Ring® (MicroSurgical Technology, Redmond, WA, US) 
is a 5–0 polypropylene single use device that is introduced with a 
disposable injector (Figure 3).20 The way in which the iris drapes over the 
sides of the device creates a round 6.25 mm or 7 mm pupil diameter. 
Compared to the bulkier plastic expansion rings the thinner profile of 
the Malyugin Ring reduces the risk of accidental corneal or incisional 
trauma and does not impede instrument access to the cataract. The 
Malyugin Ring may be preferred to iris hooks in the presence of a bleb, 
a pterygium, keratoconus, and radial keratotomy scars, and avoids the 
problem of iris hooks being pushed against the lid speculum with a 
tight palpebral fissure or uncooperative patient. The OASIS Iris Expander 
(OASIS Medical, San Dimas, CA, US) is a similar polypropylene device 
with four pockets instead of rings. Neither device can engage pupils 
dilated beyond 7 mm, however.
Iris retractors provide sufficient tension to the iris stroma so that no prolapse 
can occur with IFIS (Figure 4). Maximal widening with iris retractors can 
be safely employed with IFIS eyes because of the elasticity of the pupil 
margin. Iris retractors are advantageous when a toric intraocular lens

(IOL) is used because two of the retractors can often be aligned with the 
astigmatic axis. A particular advantage of using iris retractors for cases with 
weak zonules is that the retractors can be readily repositioned around the 
capsulorrhexis edge to serve as capsule retractors if necessary. Reusable 
4–0 polypropylene retractors (available from Katena Products, Inc., Denville, 
NJ, US and FCI Ophthalmics) are much more cost effective than any other 
pupil expander, including disposable 6–0 nylon retractors (available from 
Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, US).21 The greater rigidity makes 4–0 
retractors more durable and easier to manipulate.
Before initiating the capsulorrhexis, 1 mm limbal paracenteses are created 
in each quadrant, including a separate stab incision just posterior to the 
temporal clear corneal incision in a diamond configuration as originally 
advocated by Oetting and Omphroy.22 Alternatively, a 25 or 26 gauge needle 
can be used to make tracts for the hooks.22,23
Use of tamsulosin continues to increase in the cataract population, but 
ophthalmologists can continue to deliver great results thanks to awareness 
of each patient’s risk for IFIS and familiarity with a few of these surgical 
management techniques. 
Figure 4: Iris hooks being used to enlarge the pupil
Iris hooks can be used to enlarge the pupil beyond 7 mm, which can help control 
intraoperative floppy iris syndrome. Placing one of the hooks subincisionally can improve 
access through the wound.
