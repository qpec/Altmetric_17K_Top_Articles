BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia is associated 
with high rates of treatment failure in adults. The epidemiology, clinical outcomes, and 
risk factors for treatment failure associated with MRSA bacteremia in children are poorly 
understood.
METHODS: Multicenter, retrospective cohort study of children ≤18 years hospitalized with 
MRSA bacteremia across 3 tertiary care children’s hospitals from 2007 to 2014. Treatment 
failure was defined as persistent bacteremia >3 days, recurrence of bacteremia within 30 
days, or attributable 30-day mortality. Potential risk factors for treatment failure, including 
the site of infection, vancomycin trough concentration, critical illness, and need for source 
control, were collected via manual chart review and evaluated using multivariable logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: Of 232 episodes of MRSA bacteremia, 72 (31%) experienced treatment failure and 
23% developed complications, whereas 5 (2%) died within 30 days. Multivariable analysis 
of 174 children treated with vancomycin with steady-state vancomycin concentrations 
obtained found that catheter-related infections (odds ratio [OR], 0.36; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.13–0.94) and endovascular infections (OR, 4.35; 95% CI: 1.07–17.7) were 
associated with lower and higher odds of treatment failure, respectively, whereas a first 
vancomycin serum trough concentration <10 μg/mL was not associated with treatment 
failure (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.49–3.66). Each additional day of bacteremia was associated 
with a 50% (95% CI: 26%–79%) increased odds of bacteremia-related complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized children with MRSA bacteremia frequently suffered treatment 
failure and complications, but mortality was low. The odds of bacteremia-related 
complications increased with each additional day of bacteremia, emphasizing the 
importance of achieving rapid sterilization.

WhaT’s KnoWn on This subjecT: In adults, methicillin-
resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is associated with 
high morbidity and mortality. In adults, higher vancomycin trough 
correlates with better clinical outcomes, and these adult data 
have been used to guide therapeutic management in children.
WhaT This sTudy adds: Children with methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia frequently suffered 
complications, but mortality was low. Initial vancomycin 
trough concentrations were not associated with treatment 
failure. The odds of bacteremia-related complications 
increased with each additional day of bacteremia,

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA) bacteremia is 
associated with substantial 
morbidity and mortality in adults. 
Risk factors for treatment failure 
associated with MRSA bacteremia 
in adults include lower vancomycin 
serum concentrations, 
1, 
 
2 retained 
central venous catheters, 
3 hospital-
onset infection, 
4 pneumonia, 
4 and 
endocarditis, 
4 but these associations 
have not been shown in children. 
For example, the most prevalent 
anatomic sites of S aureus infection 
associated with bacteremia differ; 
adults more commonly present 
with MRSA endocarditis, whereas 
children more commonly present 
with bone and joint infections.5 
–8 
Antibiotic susceptibility patterns 
of MRSA also differ. Although the 
minimum inhibitory concentration 
(MIC) to vancomycin has increased 
over time in adults, 
9 this trend has 
not been consistently observed 
in children.10, 
 
11 Furthermore, the 
pharmacokinetics of vancomycin, the 
antibiotic recommended as first-line 
for treatment of MRSA bacteremia, 
12 
differ between adults and children.
To address these knowledge gaps, 
the objectives of this study were to 
characterize the clinical epidemiology 
of MRSA bacteremia in children and 
identify risk factors associated with 
treatment failure in these children.
MeThods
setting and Participants
All patients <19 years of age 
hospitalized at center A, a 520-bed 
children’s hospital in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania; center B, a 205-bed 
children’s center in Baltimore, 
Maryland; or center C, a 289-bed 
children’s hospital in Salt Lake 
City, Utah, between January 1, 2007 
and November 17, 2014 with a 
blood culture positive for MRSA 
were evaluated for inclusion in the 
study. Patients with polymicrobial 
bloodstream infections or transferred 
from another institution with 
incomplete laboratory or drug 
administration data were excluded. 
For subjects with >1 episode of MRSA 
bacteremia, only the first episode 
was included. The primary analysis 
was limited to children treated with 
vancomycin for at least 2 days within 
48 hours of onset of bacteremia 
and with a steady-state vancomycin 
concentration obtained within the 
first 3 days of therapy.
Microbiologic Methods
Blood isolates growing S aureus 
resistant to oxacillin (MIC ≥4 μg/mL)  
or cefoxitin (≥8 μg/mL) were 
included in our cohort. Clinical 
samples were processed at the 
microbiology laboratories of each 
participating institution according 
to standard operating procedures. 
Automated instruments were used 
at each participating institution’s 
clinical microbiology laboratory for 
pathogen identification and antibiotic 
susceptibility testing: centers A and C 
used the Vitek 2 system (bioMérieux), 
and center B used the BD Phoenix 
Automated System (BD Diagnostics).
data collection
Laboratory databases were used 
to identify all MRSA blood cultures 
during the study period. All clinical 
data were extracted from the 
electronic health records through 
structured chart review.
Data abstracted through chart 
review included: (1) demographic 
information; (2) presence of 
underlying comorbidities, defined 
as any of the following present 
before the onset of bacteremia: 
clinically significant heart disease, 
end-stage renal disease, end-
stage liver disease, diabetes, 
immunosuppressive therapy 
or >14 days of systemic steroid 
use, primary immunodeficiency, 
neutropenia (absolute neutrophil 
count <500 cells/mm3), HIV 
infection, solid organ transplant, 
receipt of chemotherapy within 
previous 6 months, hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation within 1 
year, chronic lung disease, intestinal 
failure, neuromuscular disease, burn, 
or eczema; (3) critical illness, defined 
as vasopressor use within 48 hours 
of the onset of MRSA bacteremia; (4) 
anatomic site of infection, categorized 
by the study investigator using 
predetermined definitions: catheter-
related as defined by the National 
Healthcare Safety Network, 
13 skin 
and soft tissue, musculoskeletal 
(osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, 
or pyomyositis), endovascular 
(including endocarditis defined 
as ≥2 positive cultures >12 hours 
apart and endocardial involvement 
or suppurative thrombophlebitis 
defined as inflammation involving 
a vascular site, or an intraluminal 
thrombus), pneumonia, or other; 
(5) community-onset (bacteremia 
from culture obtained <48 hours 
after admission) versus hospital-
onset; (6) surgical intervention for 
source control, categorized as: none 
performed, performed within 3 days 
of bacteremia onset, performed 
beyond 3 days of bacteremia onset; 
(7) removal of catheter, categorized 
into: not removed, removed within 
3 days of bacteremia onset, removed 
beyond 3 days of bacteremia onset; 
(8) initial vancomycin steady-state 
trough, defined as vancomycin serum 
concentration drawn within 3 days of 
initiating vancomycin therapy, having 
received at least 2 doses at the same 
dose within 2 hours of the scheduled 
administration time and drawn 
within 1 hour before the next dose; 
(9) antibiotic treatment data from the 
hospital medication administration 
record; and (10) MRSA susceptibility 
data, including vancomycin MIC. 
Time to the first anti-MRSA antibiotic 
was defined as the number of days 
between the first positive blood 
culture and the first dose of an 
anti-MRSA antibiotic to which the 
isolate was susceptible. This study 
was approved by the institutional 
review boards of all 3 participating 
institutions.

study outcomes
The primary outcome was treatment 
failure, a composite outcome defined 
by any 1 of the following: (1) MRSA-
attributable mortality within 30 days 
(when blood culture was positive 
for MRSA at the time of death, MRSA 
infection was listed in the medical 
record as cause of death, or death 
occurred within 14 days of the first 
day of MRSA bacteremia without an 
alternate explanation as determined 
by the study investigators); (2) 
recurrence of bacteremia within 30 
days (when a new blood culture was 
positive for MRSA within 30 days of 
discontinuing antibiotic therapy and 
separated by at least 7 days from the 
last positive blood culture for MRSA, 
with documentation of at least 1 
negative blood culture in the interim 
time period); or (3) persistence of 
bacteremia for >3 days from the first 
positive culture. It is the practice of 
the 3 participating facilities to obtain 
daily blood cultures for patients 
with MRSA bacteremia. Because the 
definition of persistent bacteremia 
has been inconsistent in the adult 
literature (ranging from 3–7 days)1, 
 
12, 
 
14 
and anecdotal experience across 
centers suggested that the mean 
duration of bacteremia would be 
shorter in children than in adults, 
persistent bacteremia was defined a 
priori as bacteremia continuing for 
>3 days, but secondary analyses were 
repeated using 5 and 7 days.
Secondary outcomes included (1) 
readmission within 30 days of 
hospital discharge attributable to 
MRSA bacteremia; (2) development 
of sequelae from MRSA bacteremia, 
including septic emboli or new 
thrombus, metastatic focus of 
infection, or endocarditis; and (3) 
progression of infection, such as an 
increase in abscess size or the need 
for repeat surgical intervention.
statistical analysis
A multivariable logistic regression 
model for the probability of 
treatment failure was built 
incorporating random effects to 
account for correlation across 
institutions, including the following 
a priori selected variables: catheter-
related infection, endovascular 
infection, first steady-state 
vancomycin serum trough 
concentration (<10 or ≥10 μg/mL),  
source control intervention 
performed (not needed, performed 
within 3 days, performed beyond 
3 days from the first positive 
blood culture), and critical illness 
(vasopressor use within 48 hours).
Post hoc analyses included variables 
that were associated with treatment 
failure in univariable analyses with 
a P value <.10 in addition to the a 
priori selected variables that were 
associated with treatment failure 
in primary analyses (critical illness, 
catheter-related bloodstream 
infection, and endovascular 
infection). To explore and quantify 
the effect of the duration of 
bacteremia on the development 
of sequelae and hematogenous 
complications, a secondary analysis 
was performed by using these 
complications as the outcome of 
interest and duration of bacteremia 
(continuous) as the exposure of 
interest, adjusting for the variables 
included in the primary analysis 
with the institution included as a 
fixed effect. Data were analyzed by 
using Stata, version 13.1 (Stata Corp, 
College Station, TX).
ResulTs
study cohort
A total of 278 episodes of MRSA 
bacteremia were identified across 
3 hospitals. Of these, 232 met study 
inclusion criteria and were included 
in the cohort, and 205 were treated 
with vancomycin, 174 of which 
had a steady-state vancomycin 
concentration obtained within 
the first 3 days of therapy (Fig 1). 
Baseline characteristics of the cohort 
are described in Table 1.
clinical and Microbiologic 
characteristics
Of the 232 included patients, 
the median age was 5.3 years 
(interquartile range [IQR]: 1.2–10.9), 
121 (52.2%) had an underlying 
comorbid condition, 50 (21.6%) had 
a hospital-onset infection, and 22 
(9.5%) required vasopressors within 
48 hours of bacteremia onset. The 
primary sources of infection were 
as follows: osteomyelitis (72, 31%), 
catheter-related (52, 22.4%), skin 
and soft tissue infection

(36, 15.5%), pneumonia (21, 9%),  
septic arthritis (11, 4.7%), 
endovascular infection (11, 4.7%), 
and no source identified (11, 4.7%) 
(Table 1). Among the 52 patients 
with catheter-related infections, 20 
of 52 (38.5%) underwent removal 
of the catheter within ≤3 days, 16 of 
52 (30.8%) underwent removal of 
the catheter beyond 3 days, and 16 
(30.8%) had their catheters retained.
Among the 205 patients who 
received vancomycin within the 
first 48 hours, 65 (32%) received 
an additional anti-MRSA antibiotic 
within the first 48 hours to which the 
isolate was known to be susceptible: 
62 received clindamycin, 2 received 
linezolid, and 1 received doxycycline. 
The median initial vancomycin 
steady-state trough was 6.9 μg/mL 
(IQR: 4.4–10.3); 59 (33.9%) had an 
initial vancomycin trough <5 μg/mL, 
69 (39.7%) had a trough between 
5 and <10 μg/mL, 29 (16.7%) had 
a trough between 10 and <15 μg/
mL, and 17 (9.8%) had a vancomycin 
trough ≥15 μg/mL. Only 17 (8%) 
MRSA isolates had an MIC >1 μg/mL.
clinical outcomes
Overall, 72 (31%) children 
experienced treatment failure: 64 
(27.6%) had persistent bacteremia 
>3 days, 7 (3%) had recurrence 
of bacteremia within 30 days of 
discontinuing anti-MRSA therapy, 
and 5 (2.2%) died due to MRSA 
bacteremia. The median duration 
of bacteremia was 2 days (IQR: 
1–4 days) (Fig 2); 30 of the 232 
patients (12.9%) had persistent 
bacteremia >5 days, and 24 (10.3%) 
had persistent bacteremia >7 days. 
Progression of infection occurred in 
17 cases (7.3%), and hematogenous 
complications or sequelae occurred 
in 54 (23.3%), including septic 
emboli or thrombus in 28 (12.1%) 
and metastatic focus of infection in 
19 (8.2%). Readmission within 30 
days that was attributable to MRSA 
bacteremia occurred for 11 (4.7%) 
children (Table 2).
Of the 5 patients who died, 1 was at 
center B and died 3 days after onset 
of bacteremia, with the primary 
source of infection identified as 
being catheter-related, and the 
remaining 4 patients were at center 
A with pneumonia identified as 
the primary infection and death 
occurring 7, 8, 9, and 11 days from 
bacteremia onset.
The proportion of patients who 
experienced treatment failure 
ranged from 21.1% to 38.2% across 
institutions, whereas the distribution 
of the anatomic site of infection, 
the proportion with hospital-onset 
infections, the frequency and timing 
of source control intervention, and 
the proportion who were critically ill 
were similar across institutions.
Of the 19 patients with persistent 
bacteremia beyond 7 days, all were 
treated initially with vancomycin 
and 17 received at least 1 additional 
antibiotic, including clindamycin 
(10), gentamicin (8), rifampin (7), 
linezolid (5), doxycycline (1), and 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (1). 
Two of these patients died, both with 
pneumonia as the primary source of 
infection (1 received linezolid and 
gentamicin and the other received 
vancomycin plus rifampin).
Risk Factors for Treatment Failure: 
Primary analysis
In univariable analyses, African 
American race, critical illness, 
musculoskeletal infection, and 
endovascular infection were 
associated with higher odds of 
treatment failure, whereas comorbid 
conditions, central venous catheter, 
and lack of an identified source of 
infection were associated with lower

odds of treatment failure (Table 3). 
In the primary multivariable analysis 
limited to the 174 patients treated 
with vancomycin and with a steady-
state vancomycin trough obtained, 
endovascular infection (odds ratio 
[OR], 4.63; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 0.83–25.7) and critical illness 
(OR, 2.99, 95% CI: 0.94–9.44) were 
associated with an increased odds of 
treatment failure, whereas catheter-
related infection (OR, 0.36; 95% CI: 
0.13–0.94) was associated with lower 
odds of treatment failure (Table 4). 
An initial vancomycin trough ≤10 
μg/mL was not associated with 
treatment failure (OR, 1.34, 95% CI: 
0.49–3.66).
Risk Factors for Treatment Failure: 
secondary analyses
Because criteria for treatment 
failure of MRSA bacteremia has 
not been established in children, 
secondary analyses were performed 
with modifications of the primary 
outcome, including redefining 
persistent bacteremia as >5 days 
or >7 days, as well as including 
progression/sequelae of infection 
as part of the composite definition 
of treatment failure. These 
modifications to the outcome 
definition did not change the 
effect size of the clinical variables 
associated with treatment failure, 
nor did a secondary analysis that 
excluded the 17 neonates from the 
cohort.
To additionally explore these 
associations, a post hoc analysis was 
performed by including variables 
that were associated with treatment 
failure in univariable analyses 
(critical illness, endovascular, 
catheter-related infection, and 
treatment with an additional anti-
MRSA antibiotic in the first 48 hours) 
in addition to the a priori determined 
variables from the primary analysis 
(musculoskeletal infection and race). 
Because the presence of a catheter 
and the presence of comorbid 
conditions were highly correlated 
with catheter-related bloodstream 
infection, these variables were not 
included in the post hoc analysis 
despite showing an association with 
treatment failure in univariable 
analysis. This analysis found 
endovascular infection (OR, 4.45, 
95% CI: 1.09–18.2), musculoskeletal 
infection (OR, 2.4, 95% CI: 1.08–
5.16), and critical illness (OR, 2.77, 
95% CI: 1.02–7.5) to be associated 
with increased odds of treatment 
failure.
Finally, a multivariable logistic 
regression model examined the 
association between duration of 
bacteremia and the composite 
outcome of death or development 
of a complication (progression

discussion
This study explored the epidemiology 
and outcomes of MRSA bacteremia 
and examined the risk factors 
associated with treatment failure 
in children across 3 tertiary care 
children’s hospitals. Musculoskeletal 
infections, endovascular infections, 
and critical illness were associated 
with an increased risk of treatment 
failure. Initial vancomycin trough and 
vancomycin MIC were not associated 
with treatment failure. For each 
additional day of MRSA bacteremia, 
the risk of developing complications 
increased by 50%.
In this cohort of hospitalized children 
with MRSA bacteremia, 78% of 
infections were community-onset, 
and the primary sources of infection 
were osteomyelitis (31%), catheter-
related bloodstream infections (22%), 
and skin and soft tissue infections 
(16%), whereas endocarditis was 
an infrequent diagnosis (2%). The 
median observed duration of MRSA 
bacteremia in this cohort was 2 days, 
and only 10% persisted beyond 7 
days. This finding is in contrast to the 
epidemiology of MRSA bacteremia 
in adults, in whom bacteremia 
is more frequently attributed to 
catheter-related infections (31%–
36%), 
7,

durations of MRSA bacteremia are 
typically more prolonged (median 
duration of bacteremia is 8–9 days).16 
Differences in the epidemiology of 
MRSA bacteremia between children 
and adults emphasizes the need for 
dedicated pediatric studies to better 
understand the clinical characteristics 
and outcomes specific to children.
Similar to what has been observed 
in adults with MRSA bacteremia, 
14% of children developed septic 
emboli or another metastatic focus 
of infection.17, 
 
18 Each additional day 
of MRSA bacteremia was associated 
with a 50% increased odds of 
developing a complication. This 
association between the duration of 
bacteremia and the development of 
complications has been previously 
reported among adults with S 
aureus bacteremia7 and provides 
important epidemiologic data that 
could inform decisions relating to 
the timing of additional imaging, 
such as echocardiograms, to identify 
metastatic foci.
Musculoskeletal infections and 
endovascular infections were 
associated with treatment failure, 
which might reflect the relatively 
higher burden of bacteria and/or 
decreased drug penetration into 
bone and endovascular infection 
sites. In studies of adults with MRSA 
bacteremia, endocarditis, pneumonia, 
and an unknown focus of infection 
have been associated with increased 
odds of treatment failure.4, 
 
19 In 
the current study, catheter-related 
infections were associated with 
reduced odds of treatment failure. 
This finding is likely a reflection of 
these episodes being localized to the 
catheter and therefore potentially 
less invasive S aureus infections.
Vancomycin serum concentrations 
were not associated with treatment 
failure in our primary model that 
compared concentrations ≥10 μg/
mL with <10 μg/mL. Although 
treatment failure was highest 
(37.9%) among those with a 
vancomycin trough concentration <5 
μg/mL and lowest (23.5%) among 
those with a trough concentration 
≥15 μg/mL, these differences 
were not statistically significant, 
potentially reflecting a lack of 
statistical power or the limitation 
of using trough concentrations 
as a surrogate for vancomycin 
exposure. Pharmacokinetic modeling 
studies have found that a trough of 
7 to 10 μg/mL is associated with 
adequate vancomycin exposure for 
most pediatric patients, 
20, 
 
21 and 
in 2 studies, analyses of smaller 
sample sizes of children with 
MRSA bacteremia (with 54 and 59 
children, respectively) did not find 
a relationship between vancomycin 
MIC by automated methods or area 
under the curve/MIC ratio and 
clinical outcomes.22, 
 
23 This finding 
raises questions about the necessity 
of routinely targeting higher trough 
concentrations (eg, 15 μg/mL, which 
is associated with an increased risk of

c A first serum trough of >10 μg/mL compared with <10 μg/mL was our a priori–determined cutoff that we hypothesized 
may convey risk for treatment failure.
d Excluding data unknown for 17 isolates; a sensitivity analysis assuming MIC <1 and then MIC >1 for the 17 unknown 
isolates also found no significant association between MIC and treatment failure.

nephrotoxicity)24 as is recommended 
for adults.12 Additional studies 
focusing on of the association 
between vancomycin exposure and 
clinical outcomes in children are 
warranted.
This study has limitations. First, as 
a retrospective cohort study, the 
data rely on documentation from 
medical records and are subject 
to missing data. Misclassification 
of exposures and outcomes is a 
potential source of bias. To minimize 
potential misclassification, structured 
chart review was performed by 
using a standard data collection 
form across sites, with predefined 
definitions for each variable 
and adjudication by 2 pediatric 
infectious diseases physicians or 
pharmacists. Vancomycin exposure 
was measured by first steady-state 
serum trough only, which may not 
be the most accurate measure of 
vancomycin exposure25 (although 
it is the current standard for 
therapeutic drug monitoring in most 
centers). Microbiologic methods 
depended on each institution’s 
clinical microbiology laboratory for 
susceptibility testing, and although 
the automated platforms used by 
these institutions has shown >95% 
correlation in other studies, 
26 they 
were not compared in this study. 
Vancomycin MICs determined 
by these methods may have 
underestimated the MIC determined 
by E-test, which some studies 
in adults have shown correlates 
more closely with outcomes.27 The 
analysis of the association between 
the duration of bacteremia and 
the development of complications 
is subject to ascertainment bias, 
because prolonged bacteremia may 
have led to increased diagnostic 
imaging, which could have potentially 
inflated this association. Recognition 
of a thrombus after onset of 
bacteremia does not necessarily 
indicate that this finding was not 
present earlier. Furthermore, 
assessing cause and effect of this 
association is challenging, because 
prolonged bacteremia leading to 
complications and complications 
leading to prolonged bacteremia 
are both biologically plausible 
mechanisms. Finally, although this is 
the largest pediatric study of MRSA 
bacteremia to date, the sample size 
may have limited the power to detect 
associations where true differences 
exist, particularly in smaller 
subcategories of the analysis.
conclusions
Although mortality among children 
with MRSA bacteremia was low 
(2%), nearly one-quarter of all 
patients experienced complications. 
Musculoskeletal infections and 
endovascular infections were 
associated with higher odds of 
treatment failure. The median 
duration of MRSA bacteremia among 
hospitalized children was 2 days, and 
each additional day of bacteremia 
increased the risk of complications 
substantially. Vancomycin trough 
concentrations or MICs were not 
associated with treatment failure. 
Future studies to determine the 
appropriate vancomycin dose, 
duration, and approach to therapeutic 
drug monitoring are warranted to 
optimize patient outcomes.
