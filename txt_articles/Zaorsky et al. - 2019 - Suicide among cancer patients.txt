Our purpose is to identify cancer patients at highest risk of suicide compared to the general
population and other cancer patients. This is a retrospective, population-based study using
nationally representative data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program,
1973-2014. Among 8,651,569 cancer patients, 13,311 committed suicide; the rate of suicide
was 28.58/ 100,000-person years, and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of suicide was
4.44 (95% CI, 4.33, 4.55). The predominant patients who committed suicide were male
(83%) and white (92%). Cancers of the lung, head and neck, testes, bladder, and Hodgkin
lymphoma had the highest SMRs ( > 5-10) through the follow up period. Elderly, white,
unmarried males with localized disease are at highest risk vs other cancer patients. Among
those diagnosed at < 50 years of age, the plurality of suicides is from hematologic and
testicular tumors; if > 50, from prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer patients.

ancer is the leading cause of death in the United States,
and the third leading cause of death around the world1. In
the 1900s, it was assumed that the primary goal in treating
cancer was survival, sometimes at the sacrifice of physical, emo-
tional, and financial burden. However, the import of a potentially
fatal diagnosis and the long trajectory of both cancer treatment
and recovery still takes a significant and sometimes overlooked
toll on patients with cancer and their families. Suicide is the
culmination of unmanaged distress; it is the 10th leading cause of
death in the United States, and risk factors for suicide among
cancer patients are similar to those among the general population,
including male sex and older age2,3. As the survival rates of cancer
patients continue to increase, it will become crucial to identify
cancer patients at elevated risk of suicide.
The 2016 Joint Commission Sentinel Event Alert recommends
detection of suicide risk across all health care fields4. Similarly,
the American College of Surgeons Committee on Cancer, the
American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the National Com-
prehensive Cancer Network have identified emotional distress
and anxiety as vital signs of cancer patients5,6. The National
Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention supports a research
agenda to reduce the national suicide rate upto 20% by 20207.
One strategy proposed is to identify and target subgroups at
greatest risk of suicide. However, clinical detection of suicide is
poor;8 moreover, there is currently no contemporary resource to
assist clinicians, including oncologists and psychiatrists, in iden-
tifying cancer patients at highest risk of suicide.
The purpose of the current work is to present a contemporary
analysis of the risk of suicide among cancer patients. Our
objectives are to identify cancer patients at highest risk of suicide
compared to (1) the general population, and (2) other cancer
patients. The results of the current work suggest that suicide-
prevention strategies may be aimed at those >50 years of age
patients with cancer of the prostate, lung, colorectum, and
bladder; as well as patients with leukemias, lymphomas, and germ
cell tumors. This work may be used clinically by oncologists and
psychiatrists in the creation of survivorship programs to reduce
distress and anxiety and mitigate the risk of suicide among cancer
patients.
Results
A total of 8,651,569 cancer patients were included in the analysis;
of these, 13,311 (0.154%) committed suicide. Among all cancer
patients, the rate of suicide per 100,000-person years was 28.58,
and the SMR of suicide was 4.44 (95% CI, 4.33, 4.55, p < 0.0001).
Cancer patient risk of suicide vs general population. Table 1
shows the characteristics of all cancer patients included as well as
those who committed suicide vs all cancer patients. The pre-
dominant patients who committed suicide were male (11,042,
83%) and white (12,258, 92.1%). Patients who were diagnosed at a
younger age had a higher SMR for suicide, and the SMRs gra-
dually declined as patients were diagnosed at a later age: e.g. those
<39-years had an SMR of 37.24 (95% CI 34.24, 40.44, p < 0.0001)
vs>80-year-olds had an SMR of 2.40 (95% CI 2.19, 2.62, p <
0.0001). Although there were only 1753 (13.2%) patients with
metastatic/distant disease at diagnosis, these patients had the
highest SMR of death from suicide, 13.19 (95% CI 12.18, 14.26,
p < 0.0001). There was a trend in increase in the SMR of patients
who committed suicide since the 1970s through 2014: e.g. those
diagnosed 1973–1980 had an SMR of 3.43 (95% CI 3.23, 3.65, p <
0.0001) vs those diagnosed 2011–2014 had an SMR of 36.91 (95%
CI 31.91, 42.47, p < 0.0001).
Figure 1 shows SMRs of suicide among cancer patients by
subsite. Certain cancer patients have relatively high SMR from
suicide in the first year after diagnosis. For example, lung cancer
patients have an SMR of 25 (95% CI 22, 28, p < 0.0001), and this
SMR decreases to 4 after 5 years of follow-up. Similarly, Hodgkin
lymphoma patients have an SMR of 26 (95% CI 13, 39, p <
0.0001) in the first year following diagnosis, but this SMR remains
elevated throughout all follow-up times. The SMR of suicide
subsides with longer follow-up time for most cancers, including
colorectal, breast, bladder, head and neck, non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma, kidney, and endometrial. In contrast, for certain cancers,
the SMR of suicide remains elevated (e.g. Hodgkin lymphoma,
prostate) or increases (i.e., testicular) over follow-up time.
Cancer patient risk of suicide vs other cancer patients. Table 2
(left panel) shows the ORs of patients who committed suicide,
stratified by subgroup. Patients older than 80 years of age have a
suicide OR of 0.71 (95% CI 0.66, 0.77) compared to those <39
years of age. Males have an OR of 5.16 (95% CI 4.92, 5.40)
compared to females. Blacks have an OR of 0.28 (95% CI 0.26,
0.31) compared to whites. Unmarried patients had an OR of 1.46
(95% CI 1.41, 1.52) compared to those who were married.
Patients with localized disease had a higher OR of suicide com-
pared to those with distant metastases, OR of 1.41 (95% CI 1.44,
1.63). Figure 2 shows the cancer patients who committed suicide
as a function of age group. Table 2 (right panel) shows the HRs of
patients who committed suicide, stratified by subgroup, com-
plementing the results of Fig. 2. Relatively few patients <50 years
of age commit suicide, in part because most cancers are diagnosed
in the elderly. Among patients diagnosed at age <50, the plurality
of suicide occurs in patients with leukemias and lymphomas. In
contrast, among patients diagnosed at age >50, the plurality of
suicides occurs in patients diagnosed with prostate, lung, and
colorectal cancer. The relative risk of suicide is generally highest
in older white males: HR 80 + year-olds, vs those ≤ 39 year old
2.19 (95% CI 2.01, 2.39), HR for male vs female 5.53 (95% CI

Discussion
We present a contemporary analysis of risk of suicide among over
8.6 million cancer patients and report that suicide risk varies as a
function of disease site, age, gender, marital status, and time after
diagnosis. The risk of suicide among cancer patients is four times
that of the general population and has increased from the twofold
risk reported in 20023. The relative risk of suicide, vs the general
population, is highest in those with cancer of the lung, head and
neck, testes, and Hodgkin lymphoma. This relative risk of suicide
decreases for most patients followed more than 5 years after
diagnosis; however, risk remains elevated or rises for those with
Hodgkin lymphoma and testicular cancer. The plurality of sui-
cides occurs in adults >50 years of age with cancer of the prostate,
lung,
colorectum,
and
bladder,
particularly
among
white,
unmarried males.
Most cancer patients now die of non-cancer causes9. The
results of the current work suggest that suicide-prevention stra-
tegies may be aimed at those >50 years of age with cancer of the
prostate, lung, colorectum, and bladder; as well as patients with
leukemias, lymphomas, and germ cell tumors. We recommend
that providers follow the evolving guidelines for monitoring
distress and suicide prevention from the American College of
Surgeons Committee on Cancer, the American Society of Clinical
Oncology, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and
Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention5–7.

respect to Objective 1, we found that although suicide contributed

 to 0.154% of deaths among cancer patients, the risk of suicide is 4.4
times that of the general population (Table 1, Fig. 1), which has
increased from 1.9 in patients diagnosed 1973-20023. The SMR of
suicide in the United States (SMRs of 9.0 for men and 4.0 for
women), is higher than that in other countries. In Denmark10,
SMRs are 1.7 for men and 1.4 for women. In Norway11, SMRs are
1.6 for men and 1.3 for women. Notably, SMRs may not be com-
pared to one another (only to the reference population), and these
differences among the countries may be due to different rates of
suicide in the general populations. SMRs may be rising in the US
because of the aging cancer population12 and because most cancer
patients are diagnosed with low-risk disease that is unlikely to cause
cancer-specific mortality9. Male cancer patients are at higher risk
than females, similar to the general population13.
The SMRs are significantly higher among recently diagnosed
patients (i.e., 2011–2014) compared to patients diagnosed before
2011 (Table 1). Patients diagnosed in more recent years have a
shorter follow up time (i.e. until 2017) compared to those
diagnosed in the 1970–2000s. Since the SMRs are generally
highest in the first few years after diagnosis vs >5–10 years after
diagnosis (per Fig. 1), the SMRs for the most recent patients are
skewed and are higher than patients diagnosed in prior years.
Notably, since SMRs are a measure to the standardized
population (the general US population in this case), SMRs
should not be compared to each other, and the SMRs from
Objective 1 should not be compared to the ORs in Objective 2,
described below.
Additionally, we found that SMRs are highest among those
diagnosed at a younger age, consistent with previous works
showing that young cancer patients are a higher risk to die of any
cause9. Notably, patients with testicular cancer have an SMR of
suicide that increases over the follow-up period (SMR > 17 by 5+
years), suggesting that these patients should experience elevated
distress and may benefit from close monitoring and early
intervention5,6. These results add to the work by Fossa et al.,
which demonstrated that testicular cancer patients had SMRs of
1.34 for all non-cancer causes of death14. Similarly, patients with
Hodgkin lymphoma remain at an elevated risk to die of suicide
through the follow up period (SMRs 15–25, higher than most
other cancers). Both subsets of cancer patients may receive
systemic therapy and radiation therapy that cause infertility. Our
results support the work by Kjaer et al.15 who reported increased
risk of suicide (hazard ratio, 1.68) among Danish women with
fertility problems.
Finally, compared to the analysis that include patients up to
20023, we found that head and neck cancer patients are not the

This finding may be secondary to the shifting distribution of
human papilloma virus-associated cancers, and a decrease in
those associated with tobacco and alcohol.
Previously, Kumar et al.16 used the SEER database to compare
suicide rates among cancer patients in the USA diagnosed in
2007–2013 vs those diagnosed in 2000–2006. The authors
reported that (1) cancer patients are at a 1.37-fold higher risk

relatively high SMR from suicide in the first year after diagnosis (e.g. lung, with SMR of 25; or Hodgkin lymphoma, with SMR of 26). For most cancers, the
SMR of suicide subsides with longer follow-up time. In contrast, for certain cancers, the SMR of suicide remains elevated (e.g. Hodgkin lymphoma) or
increases (e.g. testicular)

 of committing suicide vs the general population; (2) the risk is
highest in older males, in the first year of diagnosis; and (3) the
rate of suicide has not increased between the two time periods
included (i.e. 2007–2013 vs 2000–2006).
Our current work adds to the work by Kumar et al. First, we
characterize suicide rates from 1973 to 2015, and we find that the
OR of suicide is decreasing in more recent years vs previous years
(i.e. 2011–2014 vs 1973–1980), however the risk of suicide vs. the
general population is increasing: 1.9 in patients diagnosed
1973–20023, vs. 4.4 for patients in the current work who were
diagnosed 1973–2015. Additionally, we compare the relative risk
of death from suicide vs the general population (in Objective 1),
as well as vs other cancer patients (in Objective 2). Further, we
identify distinct subgroups of cancer patients who contribute to
the plurality of suicides, i.e. those >50 years of age with cancer of
the prostate, lung, colorectum, and bladder; as well as patients
with leukemias, lymphomas, and germ cell tumors. The results of
the current study may be used to guide interventions for suicide
prevention among unique subgroups.
Cancer patient risk of suicide vs other cancer patients. With
respect to Objective 2, we found that the plurality of suicides
occurs adults >50 years of age with cancer of the prostate, lung,
colorectum, and bladder (Table 2, Fig. 2). Cancer is typically
diagnosed among the elderly, and these cancers are not prevalent
among younger patients; in contrast, leukemias, lymphomas, and
testicular cancer are more common among younger patients, and
adolescents who are subsequently diagnosis have an elevated risk
of suicide.
We found that men have an OR of 5.16 in committing suicide,
which corroborates in our findings from Objective 1, and is also
likely secondary to the incidence of testicular cancer being only in
male patients. Additionally, patients who were unmarried had
65% of the odds of committing suicide, those who were white had
almost 400% as those who were black. The odds of suicide were
highest among those diagnosed in more distant decades, likely
because of the increase time at risk, particularly among cancer
survivors.
The OR of suicide of patients diagnosed in more recent years is
lower than that diagnosed in previous years (e.g. 2011–2014 vs
1973–1980 in Table 2), suggesting that patients diagnosed in
more recent years are less likely to commit suicide than patients
diagnosed in previous years. This finding is likely secondary to
the evolving characteristics of cancer patients in the USA; with a
decrease in smoking rates (highest among elderly white males),
there is a decrease in rates of lung cancer and human papilloma
virus (HPV)-negative head and neck cancers, which have also
historically been cancers of elderly white men. In contrast, with
the advent of screening mammography and prostate specific
antigen (PSA) testing in the 1990s, there has been a surge in the
diagnoses of low-risk breast and prostate cancers1. ORs compare
the odds of suicide of the group of one group of cancer patients vs
a reference group of cancer patients, unlike the SMRs in Objective
1, which compare relative risk of death vs. the entire US
population, as a function of time after diagnosis. Thus, if there is a
change in the rate of suicide in subpopulations of patients
between two eras, this change will be reflected in the ORs, but not
necessarily in the SMRs.
Our work has limitations. The overall number of deaths from
suicide was relatively limited overall (<1% of cancer patients), and
more detailed analyses on risk factors could not be performed.
Treatment paradigms have changed since the 1970s; for example,
Hodgkin lymphoma patients are now treated with limited
chemotherapy, and possibly a relatively low dose of very targeted
radiation17. Additionally, patients having death events in earlier
years (i.e. 1973–1983) have limited follow up and less time at risk
(≤10 years) than some patients with events in more recent years.

 This may have resulted in an overestimate of SMRs for
individuals diagnosed between 2011–2014, compared to those
diagnosed before 1980. Similarly, patients diagnosed in recent
years have short follow-up and lower chance of death from any
cause.
Further, there is a risk of bias and misclassification of suicide in
the SEER18,19. For example, in a review of cases of non-Hodgkin
lymphomas, agreement in the subclassification of histologies
between the expert review and the SEER registry record varied
from 5 to 100%20. An investigation of the California Cancer
Registry, which contributes to the national SEER data21, revealed
registry sensitivity of receipt of radiation therapy of only 72%. As
of 2018, there has been limited research published regarding the
misclassification of cause of death in the SEER database. Thus, we
are unable to characterize misclassification of suicide in the
current work.
Nonetheless, for suicide, there is likely little discrepancy in the
cause of death, as compared to a cause of death like heart disease,
which may be cause by the cancer treatment, underlying heart
disease, or a combination of both. We agree with Sun and Trinh,
in their assessment of the SEER database, that although there may
be some errors in large registries, the errors are likely less frequent
than those in hospital based databases and big data will continue
to remain an integral part of hypothesis-generating exploratory
analyses in medical research19.
The results of the current work suggest that suicide-prevention
strategies may be aimed at those >50 years of age patients with
cancer of the prostate, lung, colorectum, and bladder; as well as
patients with leukemias, lymphomas, and germ cell tumors. We
recommend that providers follow the evolving guidelines for
monitoring distress and suicide prevention from the American
College of Surgeons Committee on Cancer, the American Society
of Clinical Oncology, the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network, and Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention5–7.
Methods
Data acquisition. Patients with invasive cancer, diagnosed between 1973 and 2014,
were abstracted from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) program22,23. The overview and limitations of the database
and the methods are described in the Supplementary information24–26. SEER is a
network of population-based incident tumor registries from geographically distinct
regions in the US, covering 28% of the US population, including incidence, sur-
vival, and treatment (e.g. radiation therapy, surgery, and chemotherapy)22,23. For
the current analysis, the SEER18 registry was used. The SEER registry includes data
on sex, age at diagnosis, race, marital status, and year of diagnosis. SEER does not
code comorbidities, performance status, surgical pathology, margin status, doses, or
chemotherapy agents. SEER*Stat 8.2.1 was used for analysis22.
All patients with an invasive cancer diagnosis were included. Patients diagnosed
only through autopsy or death certificate (<1.5% of patients) were excluded. Data
were extracted for patients with more than 100,000 person-years or more of
survival time; thus, certain uncommon and aggressive cancers were excluded,
including Kaposi’s sarcoma, multiple myeloma, hepatobiliary cancer, male breast
cancers, and mesotheliomas. Since certain cancers represent a heterogeneous group
of disease (e.g. leukemia, lymphoma), these cancers were grouped for certain parts
of the analysis, so they could be reported accurately.
Mortality codes in SEER are assigned from death certificates, completed by the
doctor caring for the patient at the time of demise. Patients were considered to have
committed suicide if the cause of death was coded as: suicide and self-inflicted
injury (50220). Patients with other causes of death, including accident, homicide,
and legal intervention were excluded from the present analysis. Survival time in
SEER is measured in months, and the smallest nonzero value is 1 month, which
was the minimum time to any event.
Notably, SEER does not code comorbidities or diagnoses associated with
suicide, including suicidal ideation, previous suicide attempts, or use of anti-
depressive medications. The observed associations between cancer and suicide may
be confounded by psychiatric disorders and the use of medications, but we are
unable to control for these factors in the current work. These are limitations of the
analysis and limit the interpretability of the results.
For objective 1, we calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), which
provide the relative risk of death for patients with cancer as compared to all US
residents, stratified by cancer subgroup3,22,27. Data were characterized with SMRs
adjusted by age, race, and sex to the US population over the same time. Five-year
age categories were used for standardization using SEER*Stat 8.2.1 and Microsoft
Excel 15.0.4 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA)27–29.
For objective 2, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated based on the
number of observed events per patient subgroup. Further, the absolute and relative
number of suicides per patient age group (at time of diagnosis) were calculated. We
also performed a survival analysis using a Cox proportional hazards model to
calculate hazard ratios (HRs), with the survival time being from diagnosis until
suicide, and non-suicide deaths plus living patients being censored.
Reporting Summary. Further information on experimental design is available in
the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.
Data availability. The data are provided in the SEER database, which is freely
accessible to the public. The relevant session information, i.e. the user-submitted
request, from in the current work and abbreviated data set (from SEER) are pro-
vided in Supplementary Data Sets 1-3.
We comply with all relevant ethical regulations. The datasets generated and
analyzed during the current study are available in the SEER repository (https://seer.
cancer.gov/seerstat/). These data are freely available via the National Cancer
Institute SEER program, and thus the study was exempt from institutional review
board review. There are no participants in the study, and thus there is no consent
form. To access the data in this study, we provide further detailed instruction in the
Supplementary Methods.
