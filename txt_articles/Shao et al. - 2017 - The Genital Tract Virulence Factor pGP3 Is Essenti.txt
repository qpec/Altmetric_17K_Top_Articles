ABSTRACT
The cryptic plasmid is essential for Chlamydia muridarum dissemination
from the genital tract to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Following intravaginal inocu-
lation, a C. muridarum strain deficient in plasmid-encoded pGP3 or pGP4 but not
pGP5, pGP7, or pGP8 failed to spread to the mouse gastrointestinal tract, although
mice infected with these strains developed productive genital tract infections. pGP3- or
pGP4-deficient strains also failed to colonize the gastrointestinal tract when delivered in-
tragastrically. pGP4 regulates pGP3, while pGP3 does not affect pGP4 expression, indicat-
ing that pGP3 is critical for C. muridarum colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. Mu-
tants deficient in GlgA, a chromosome-encoded protein regulated by pGP4, also
consistently colonized the mouse gastrointestinal tract. Interestingly, C. muridarum
colonization of the gastrointestinal tract positively correlated with pathogenicity in
the upper genital tract. pGP3-deficient C. muridarum strains did not induce hydrosal-
pinx or spread to the GI tract even when delivered to the oviduct by intrabursal in-
oculation. Thus, the current study not only has revealed that pGP3 is a novel chla-
mydial colonization factor in the gastrointestinal tract but also has laid a foundation
for investigating the significance of gastrointestinal Chlamydia.

exually transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis infections sometimes ascend to the
upper genital tract (GT), where they can cause tubal pathology and infertility (1–3).
However, the mechanisms of this ascension remain unclear. The murine model of
Chlamydia muridarum infection (4–6) has been used for studying C. trachomatis patho-
genesis (7–12) and has revealed numerous chlamydial (13–17) and host (7, 11, 18–24)
factors required for chlamydial induction of hydrosalpinx (6, 16, 25, 26). For example,
the cryptic plasmid (16, 17) or plasmid-encoded pGP3 (13) is essential for C. muridarum
hydrosalpinx induction in mice. However, the mechanism by which the plasmid or
plasmid-encoded pGP3 promotes C. muridarum pathogenicity in the mouse upper
genital tract remains unknown.
The C. muridarum plasmid (pMoPn/pCM) (27, 28) encodes 8 putative proteins,
designated plasmid-encoded glycoproteins 1 to 8 (pGP1 to pGP8, respectively) (27, 29).
pGP1, -2, and -6 are required for plasmid maintenance (30–32); thus, the generation of
mutant plasmids that do not express these proteins has been difficult. Nevertheless, C.
muridarum mutants deficient in pGP3, -4, -5, -7, or -8 are viable (30). Studies with these
mutants have revealed that pGP4 is a master regulator for plasmid-borne genes, such
as pgp3, and chromosomal genes involved in glycogen synthesis, including glgA (31,

 32), while pGP5 may function as a negative regulator of the same chlamydial genes
(30). A plasmid-deficient C. muridarum strain had a reduced ability to elicit hydrosalpinx
and tubal inflammation (16, 17). These phenotypes were similar in C. muridarum strains
that contained plasmids that were deficient only in pGP3 or pGP4 (13, 30). Since pGP4
regulates pGP3 but pGP3 does not affect pGP4 expression (30–32), it was concluded
that pGP3 is the major virulence factor responsible for plasmid-dependent pathoge-
nicity in the mouse upper genital tract. Although pGP5 negatively regulates chlamydial
plasmid and chromosomal genes in cell culture (30), pGP5 deficiency reduced C.
muridarum pathogenicity in some mouse strains (33).
Despite the significant roles of the plasmid and pGP3 in C. muridarum pathogenesis
in the upper genital tract, neither is essential for C. muridarum colonization of the
mouse lower genital tract (13, 16, 17, 33, 34). Plasmid-free C. trachomatis isolates have
been isolated from the human urogenital tract (35, 36). More importantly, C. tracho-
matis serovar D colonization of the genital tracts of nonhuman primates was not
impacted by the loss of the plasmid (37). These observations suggest that the plasmid
may be dispensable in the genital tract.
C. trachomatis and C. muridarum also infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of humans
(38–41) and mice (42, 43), respectively. When C. muridarum was experimentally intro-
duced into multiple mouse mucosae, it readily colonized the GI tract (43). We showed
that C. muridarum could spread from the genital tract to the GI tract and establish
long-lasting infections at the latter site (42). This spread still occurred in singly housed
mice wearing collars that prevented coprophagy (42, 43). Furthermore, C. muridarum
survived in the blood, and the hematogenously delivered C. muridarum established
long-lasting colonization only of the GI tract (44). These observations together indi-
cated that C. muridarum could spread from the mouse genital tract into the GI tract via
a hematogenous route. In contrast, autoinoculation of the mouse genital tract from the
GI tract was not detected in mice that had stable GI tract infections for 70 days (45).
Since C. muridarum infection in the GI tract is nonpathogenic (42–47), C. muridarum
may have evolved as a commensal organism in this niche. Consistent with this, the
plasmid is more important for C. muridarum to colonize the GI tract than to infect the
genital tract (48). Identifying the plasmid-encoded or regulated factors responsible for
the plasmid-dependent C. muridarum colonization in the GI tract may provide critical
information for further investigating the mechanisms by which the plasmid promotes
C. muridarum fitness.
Here, we report that plasmid-encoded pGP3 is essential for C. muridarum spread
from the genital tract to and colonization of the mouse GI tract. In contrast, pGP4-
regulated GlgA was not essential for C. muridarum to colonize the GI tract. Furthermore,
the lack of GI tract colonization by pGP3-deficient C. muridarum correlated with its
attenuated pathogenicity in the upper genital tract. Thus, the current study has both
identified pGP3 to be a novel chlamydial colonization factor in the gastrointestinal tract
and laid a foundation for further investigating the significance of the gastrointestinal
Chlamydia.
RESULTS
Plasmid-encoded pGP3 is required for C. muridarum to spread from the mouse
genital tract to the GI tract. C. muridarum dissemination from the mouse genital tract
to the GI tract (42) is regulated by the cryptic plasmid (48). We mapped the plasmid-
encoded proteins responsible for this by comparing the ability of C. muridarum strains
deficient in individual plasmid-encoded proteins (C. muridarum with a complete plas-
mid [CM-pGFP], C. muridarum with a premature stop codon in the pgp3 gene [CM-
pgp3S], C. muridarum with a premature stop codon in the pgp4 gene [CM-pgp4S], C.
muridarum with a premature stop codon in the pgp5 gene [CM-pgp5S], and C. muri-
darum with a premature stop codon in the pgp7 gene [CM-pgp7S], as well as C.
muridarum with an in-frame deletion of the pgp8 gene [CM-pgp8D]) to disseminate to
the GI tract following intravaginal inoculation. All of the organisms robustly infected
CBA/J mice and were shed from the lower genital tracts of CBA/J mice following

 intravaginal inoculation (Fig. 1), consistent with previous reports (13, 16, 17, 33).
Abundant organisms were detected in rectal swab specimens from the CM-pGFP-
infected animals, whereas the numbers of plasmid-free (pf) C. muridarum (CMUT3-pf)
organisms were much lower (48). In contrast, no CM-pgp3S or CM-pgp4S (deficient in
pGP3 or pGP4, respectively) organisms were detected in rectal swab specimens. Since
pGP4 regulates pGP3 while pGP3 does not affect pGP4 expression, the observations
presented above indicated that pGP3 is critical for C. muridarum spread from the genital
tract to the GI tract. Why CM-pgp3S was more defective than CMUT3-pf is unclear. It is
also worth noting that CM-pgp5S seemed to behave differently from the other C.
muridarum clones. CM-pgp5S developed significantly reduced genital and rectal shed-
ding courses, while the other mutant clones maintained a genital tract live organism
shedding course as robust as that of the wild-type control, CM-pGFP. pGP3 was also
required for dissemination from the GT to the GI tract in more resistant C57BL/6J mice
(Fig. 2), arguing that the role of pGP3 is not related to the inherent susceptibility of the
mice to the pathogen (6).
The plasmid-encoded pGP3 is required for C. muridarum to colonize the mouse
GI tract. To test whether the lack of spreading from the genital tract to the GI tract by
pGP3-deficient C. muridarum was due to failure to colonize the GI tract, we compared
the ability of the same strains described in Fig. 1 to colonize the GI tract following
intragastric inoculation (Fig. 3). When female C57BL/6J mice were intragastrically
inoculated with 2 � 105 inclusion-forming units (IFU) per mouse, no CM-pgp3S or
CM-pgp4S live organisms were detected in the rectal swab specimens, indicating that
these strains could not colonize the GI tract. CM-pgp3S still failed to colonize the GI
tract even when the intragastric inoculation dose was increased to 1 � 107 IFU. Similar
to the intravaginal infection model, CMUT3-pf organisms colonized the GI tract better
than CM-pgp3S organisms. Rectal shedding of CM-pgp5S and CM-pgp8D was also
reduced compared to that of CM-pGFP, suggesting that pGP5 and pGP8 contribute to

 C. muridarum fitness in the C57BL/6J mouse GI tract, although their importance in the
GT is less clear (13, 33). Nevertheless, pGP3 was a critical plasmid-encoded factor for C.
muridarum colonization of the mouse GI tract in both the intragastric and intravaginal
infection models. It is worth noting that the inability of CM-pgp4S to colonize the GI
tract may reflect the fact that other chromosomal genes regulated by pGP4, in addition
to pGP3, might contribute to colonization of the GI tract.
The pGP4-regulated GlgA is not essential for C. muridarum colonization in the
mouse GI tract. GlgA expression is positively regulated by pGP4 (30–32), suggesting
that a lack of GlgA expression (in addition to the reduced amount of pGP3, as
demonstrated above) may also contribute to the reduced colonization of the GI tract by

 CM-pgp4S organisms. GlgA-deficient C. muridarum mutants produce fewer infectious
progeny in cell culture (49), suggesting that GlgA may be a significant C. muridarum
colonization factor in animals. Thus, we next evaluated the effect of chlamydial GlgA on
C. muridarum colonization in the mouse GI tract. As shown in Fig. 4, both C. muridarum
GlgA mutants developed significant IFU titers in rectal swab specimens, indicating that
both mutants were still capable of colonizing the mouse GI tract. Since both clones
contained a glgA gene mutation and lacked glycogen synthesis (see Fig. S1 in the
supplemental material), this observation suggests that GlgA or glycogen synthesis is
not required for chlamydial colonization in the GI tract. This conclusion is consistent
with the hypothesis that pGP3 but not the pGP4-regulated GlgA is a primary determi-
nant of C. muridarum fitness in the mouse GI tract. Nevertheless, compared to wild-type
C. muridarum, both mutant clones had lower IFU titers, suggesting that GlgA or TC0215,
a conserved hypothetical protein that contains a type III secretion system translocator
arabinose efflux permease domain, or both GlgA and TC0215 may promote C. muri-
darum fitness in the mouse GI tract. This is because both mutant clones contain
mutations in these two genes (Table S2).
Plasmid gene-dependent C. muridarum colonization in the GI tract correlates
with C. muridarum pathogenicity in the upper genital tract. The above-described
experiments demonstrated that the plasmid-encoded proteins, particularly pGP3, pro-
mote C. muridarum GI tract colonization. The next question is whether colonization of
the GI tract by C. muridarum can impact C. muridarum pathogenicity in the upper
genital tract, which is a relevant question here, since pGP3 is a known C. muridarum
virulence factor in the mouse upper genital tract (13). We then monitored the hydro-
salpinx pathology in the upper genital tracts of CBA/J mice infected intravaginally with
C. muridarum strains with or without a deficiency in the plasmid or individual plasmid
genes (Fig. 5). We found that C. muridarum strains deficient in either the entire plasmid
or the single protein pGP3 or pGP4 were significantly attenuated in inducing hydro-
salpinx. When the relationships between C. muridarum pathogenicity in the upper
genital tract and live organism shedding from the genital tract or the GI tract were
analyzed (Fig. 6 and Table S1), we found that there was no correlation between the
hydrosalpinx scores and the live organism shedding titers in the vaginal swab speci-
mens (collected from the genital tracts). Spearman’s correlation coefficient for the
vaginal swab specimens (defined as Rv) was �0.1773, with the P value being 0.3251.

shedding from either the genital tract (log10 total number of IFU from vaginal swab specimens collected

 P � 0.05). Thus, we can conclude that the plasmid gene-dependent C. muridarum
pathogenicity in the upper genital tract correlates better with the plasmid gene-
dependent C. muridarum colonization in the GI tract than with the C. muridarum
infection in the genital tract. This correlation was further validated when CM-pgp3S was
compared with CM-pGFP for both hydrosalpinx induction and live organism shedding
after the organisms were directly delivered into the oviduct via intrabursal inoculation
(Fig. 7). Although CM-pgp3S was able to infect the genital tract after it was inoculated
into the oviduct, it was significantly attenuated in inducing hydrosalpinx. At the same
time, the oviduct CM-pgp3S organisms were still unable to spread into the GI tract.
Thus, even after intrabursal inoculation, the pGP3-dependent pathogenicity in the
upper genital tract still correlated with the pGP3-dependent spreading to the GI tract.
These observations together suggest that the pGP3-dependent spreading of C. muri-
darum into the GI tract may contribute to the pGP3-dependent pathogenicity in the
upper genital tract.
DISCUSSION
Since Chlamydia was detected in the GI tract, questions on the mechanisms by
which Chlamydia colonizes the gut or the significance of Chlamydia colonization of the
gut have caught the attention of chlamydiologists. Based on our recent report that the
chlamydial cryptic plasmid is more important for C. muridarum to colonize the GI tract
than to infect the genital tract (48), we now report that it is the plasmid-encoded pGP3
that is mainly responsible for the plasmid-dependent phenotype. Furthermore, we have
also found that the plasmid gene-dependent chlamydial colonization in the GI tract
correlates with the plasmid gene-dependent chlamydial pathogenicity in the upper
genital tract. First, C. muridarum strains with or without a deficiency in plasmid or
individual plasmid-encoded proteins developed similar levels of live organism shed-
ding from the mouse lower genital tract following intravaginal inoculation, suggesting
that all organisms evaluated in the current study maintained similar infectious titers in
the mouse lower genital tract. However, a deficiency in plasmid or the plasmid-
encoded pGP3 or pGP4 but not pGP5, pGP7, or pGP8 significantly reduced the
spreading of the genital tract C. muridarum bacteria to the GI tract, indicating that the
deficiency in pGP3 or pGP4 sufficiently phenocopied the plasmid deficiency. Since
pGP4 is a positive regulator of pGP3 expression while pGP3 does not affect pGP4
expression (13, 30–33), we can conclude that pGP3 is mainly responsible for the
plasmid-dependent spreading. Second, after intragastric inoculation, the same pGP3- or

 pGP4-deficient C. muridarum strain failed to colonize in the GI tract, suggesting that
pGP3 was mainly responsible for mediating plasmid-dependent colonization in the GI
tract. Third, two independent C. muridarum mutants deficient in GlgA, a chromosomal
protein that is regulated by pGP4, were still able to colonize the mouse gastrointestinal
tract, although at levels significantly lower than the level of a wild-type C. muridarum
strain. The reduced numbers of IFU recovered may suggest that GlgA can promote C.
muridarum fitness in the mouse GI tract. Glycogen synthesis and utilization have been
shown to play an important role in maintaining gut bacterial colonization (50, 51).
However, since each of the 2 mutants also carried multiple other mutations in their
genomes, the reduced colonization by the mutants may have been caused by muta-
tions in non-GlgA proteins. Thus, more experiments in future studies are required to
define the genetic basis of the reduced colonization by these mutants. Finally, when
the plasmid gene-dependent C. muridarum colonization in the GI tract was compared
with the C. muridarum infection in the lower genital tract for correlation with the C.
muridarum pathogenicity in the upper genital tract in the same mice, we found that the
former had a significantly stronger positive correlation than the latter. The positive
correlation of C. muridarum colonization in the GI tract with C. muridarum pathogenicity
in the upper genital tract was further strengthened by the observation that when
CM-pgp3S was directly inoculated into the oviduct, the oviduct organisms still failed to
induce hydrosalpinx and were unable to spread to the GI tract. Thus, the current study
not only has revealed that pGP3 is a novel plasmid-encoded colonization factor for
improving C. muridarum fitness in the GI tract but also has laid a foundation for further
investigating how GI tract C. muridarum may affect the pathogenicity of C. muridarum
in the upper genital tract.
We noticed that the defect both in C. muridarum spread from the mouse genital
tract to the GI tract and in C. muridarum colonization in the GI tract was greater with
the deficiency of pGP3 alone than with the deficiency of the entire plasmid. The
plasmid-free CMUT3-pf organisms were still able to spread to and colonize in the GI
tract following intravaginal and intragastric inoculation, respectively, although the
levels were significantly reduced compared to those of the wild-type control organisms
(see Fig. 1 and 3 of the current study and reference 48). However, CM-pgp3S, which was
deficient only in the pGP3 protein, completely failed to spread to and colonize in the
GI tract, which was still true even when the intragastric inoculation dose was increased
by 50-fold. Since CM-pgp3S developed a live organism shedding course as robust as
CMUT3-pf did in the genital tract following intravaginal inoculation (Fig. 1) (13), the
complete lack of spread to or colonization in the GI tract by CM-pgp3S was unlikely due
to its general deficiency in infecting animal tissues. The plasmid-encoded pGP5 has
been shown to negatively regulate genes in both the chlamydial plasmid and chro-
mosome (30–32). The excessive deficiency of CM-pgp3S in colonizing the GI tract may
be due to the repression of GI tract colonization factors by the pGP5 remaining in
CM-pgp3S but no longer remaining in CMUT3-pf. However, the deficiency in pGP5
(CM-pgp5S clone) did not increase the level of colonization in the GI tract (Fig. 3). The
pGP5 deficiency alone may not be enough to increase colonization factors in animals,
although the pGP5-repressed genes were enhanced in CM-pgp5S in a cell culture
system (30). CM-pgp5S was attenuated in infecting the genital tract and spreading to
and colonizing the GI tract (Fig. 1 and 3) as well as in inducing hydrosalpinx in some
mouse strains (13, 16, 17, 33, 34). These observations suggest that pGP5 deficiency is
sufficient for altering the fitness of C. muridarum in the GI tract and reducing C.
muridarum invasiveness in the genital tract. The deficiency in pGP8 seemed to also alter
the fitness of C. muridarum in the mouse GI tract, but the phenotype of pGP8 deficiency
in the cell culture system was not clear (30, 33). Apparently, more experiments are
required to further define the precise mechanisms by which each plasmid-encoded
protein impacts the fitness biology of C. muridarum in the GI tract. Despite the
phenotypic discrepancies described above, the general conclusion that pGP3 plays a
critical role in C. muridarum colonization in the GI tract remains strong.
The next question is how pGP3 promotes C. muridarum colonization in the GI tract.

 Since CM-pgp3S was able to infect the genital tract but completely lacked the ability to
colonize the GI tract, the GI colonization system may provide a better platform for
mapping the mechanisms by which pGP3 promotes C. muridarum infectivity in mice. C.
muridarum long-term colonization in the GI tract has been localized to the cecum/colon
(42, 45, 52). Thus, to achieve long-term colonization in the GI tract after an intragastric
inoculation, C. muridarum needs to survive various host barriers, including gastric acid,
the small intestinal defense mechanisms, and colonic microbiota competition. The
question is how pGP3 aids C. muridarum to overcome these host barriers. pGP3 is a
stable trimer in a cell-free system (53) or inside cells during chlamydial infection (54, 55),
and it is both associated with the chlamydial organism outer membrane and secreted
into the host cytosol (56). The outer membrane-associated pGP3 may promote C.
muridarum resistance to gastric acid, while the secreted pGP3 may neutralize the
antimicrobial factors in the small intestine. The latter is supported by a previous finding
that pGP3 bound to the host antimicrobial cathelicidin peptide LL-37 (human) or
CRAMP (mouse) and neutralized its antichlamydial activity (57). The trimer structure of
the pGP3 C-terminal trimerization domain has been shown to be similar to the trimer
structure of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-�) family members (53), suggesting that
the secreted pGP3 may be able to modulate host inflammatory pathways mediated by
TNF to promote C. muridarum colonization in the GI tract. It is also possible for pGP3
to target other bacteria or bacterial products to create a niche for C. muridarum to
maintain long-term colonization in the colon. Chlamydia is known to take up bacterial
metabolites for its own biosynthesis (58–62). The cecum/colon is full of bacterial
metabolites. The question is whether pGP3 can promote C. muridarum uptake of
bacterial metabolites for biosynthesis. Testing of the hypotheses mentioned above is
under way.
Regardless of how pGP3 promotes C. muridarum fitness in the gut, the finding that
the plasmid-encoded pGP3 regulates C. muridarum fitness in the GI tract has provided
structural evidence demonstrating that C. muridarum may be a commensal species in
the mouse GI tract. First, the cryptic plasmid or plasmid-encoded proteins are more
important for C. muridarum to colonize the GI tract than for it to infect the genital tract,
suggesting that C. muridarum may have acquired the plasmid for adaptation to the GI
tract. Second, C. muridarum can establish long-lasting colonization only in the GI tract
(44), although it readily infects extra-GI tract mucosal tissues (43). C. muridarum
organisms are often eliminated from the extra-GI tract tissues by the host defense since
C. muridarum has not fully adapted to the extra-GI tract tissues. Third, like normal
commensal bacterial species in the gut, C. muridarum seems to be nonpathogenic in
the GI tract (42, 43, 45–47), while C. muridarum often induces inflammatory pathologies
in extra-GI tract tissues. That is why C. muridarum infection in the genital tract or airway
but not the gut has frequently been used as a disease model (4, 63, 64). Finally, some
gut bacterial species have been shown to exacerbate pathologies in non-GI tract
tissues, such as joint tissues (65). The question is whether the nonpathogenic coloni-
zation of C. muridarum in the GI tract can promote pathologies in the genital tract
tissues with ongoing or prior C. muridarum infection. There seems to be a better
correlation of C. muridarum pathogenicity in the upper genital tract with C. muridarum
colonization in the GI tract than with C. muridarum colonization in the genital tract (Fig.
6), suggesting a role of the GI tract chlamydial organisms in promoting chlamydial
pathogenicity in the upper genital tract. An effort is under way to evaluate the role of
GI tract chlamydial colonization in genital tract pathogenesis and to further reveal the
mechanism by which GI tract chlamydial colonization potentially promotes genital tract
pathogenesis.
Finally, it is worth noting that the C. muridarum infection in mice is different from C.
trachomatis infection in humans. Thus, great caution should be taken when applying
knowledge learned from the murine system to human chlamydial infection. Although
C. muridarum infection in the mouse genital tract can induce upper genital tract
pathologies and complications similar to those observed in C. trachomatis-infected
women (1–3), C. muridarum is unlikely transmitted between mice sexually via the
pGP3 for Chlamydial Colonization in the Gut

 genital tracts. Instead, oral-fecal transmission is more likely. Thus, the GI tract mucosal
tissue may serve as the primary selection pressure for C. muridarum to evolve, which
may explain why the plasmid or plasmid-encoded proteins are more important for C.
muridarum to colonize the GI tract than for it to colonize the genital tract. It is not clear
whether the virulence ability acquired by C. muridarum during its adaptation to the GI
tract also affords C. muridarum the ability to overcome the cervical barrier for colonizing
the upper genital tract. However, C. trachomatis is known to transmit sexually between
humans, while transmission by the oral-fecal route is less likely. Thus, the finding of the
requirement of the plasmid for C. muridarum to colonize the GI tract may not neces-
sarily be applicable to C. trachomatis infections in humans. Nevertheless, C. trachomatis
has been detected in the GI tracts of humans (38–41, 66) and can infect human
enteroendocrine cells (67). Women practicing oral-anal sex can introduce C. trachomatis
into their GI tracts (39, 41). Thus, both the human genital and GI tract mucosae may
provide selection pressure for C. trachomatis adaptation. It will be interesting to
investigate whether the plasmid or plasmid-encoded pGP3 is also more important for
C. trachomatis to colonize the human GI tract than for it to infect the human genital
tract.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chlamydia muridarum organisms. Chlamydia muridarum strain Nigg3 (GenBank accession number
CP009760.1) (14, 15, 48) organisms were propagated and purified in HeLa cells (human cervical
carcinoma epithelial cells; catalog number CCL2; ATCC) as described previously (42, 68). A plasmid-
deficient clone (designated CMUT3.G5) was derived from Nigg3 as described previously (13, 30). The
pGFP:CM plasmid (69) with or without installation of a premature stop codon in the pgp3, pgp4, pgp5,
or pgp7 gene or an in-frame deletion of the pgp8 gene was transformed into the plasmid-deficient
CMUT3.G5 clone to produce plasmid-competent (designated CMUT3G5-pGFP or CM-pGFP), pGP3-
deficient (CMUT3G5-Pgp3S or CM-pgp3S), pGP4-deficient (CM-pgp4S), pGP5-deficient (CM-pgp5S),
pGP7-deficient (CM-pgp7S), or pGP8-deficient (CM-pgp8D) C. muridarum organisms as described previ-
ously (13, 30).
Two C. muridarum glycogen synthase A (GlgA) mutants were used in the current study. These
mutants were generated by mutagenizing C. muridarum in McCoy cells with ethyl methanesulfonate
(EMS; catalog number M0880; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) (70) and screening for mutants that exhibited
reduced glycogen staining in vitro. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that two mutant isolates,
designated P1D1 and P3B4, had different mutations that would cause amino acid substitutions in
conserved residues of GlgA (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). The glgA genotypes of these
mutants were C1055T for P1D1 and G1157A for P3B4. Since the mutants were produced by EMS
mutagenesis, they also each contained additional unique mutations outside glgA. In vitro experiments
have shown an attenuated ability of the glgA mutants to infect HeLa cells by about 3-fold compared to
the ability of wild-type C. muridarum (49) and a lack of glycogen synthesis by these mutants (Fig. S1). All
C. muridarum organisms mentioned above were propagated and purified as elementary bodies (EBs).
Aliquots of the purified EBs were stored at �80°
C until use. A wild-type clone isolated from Nigg3,
G13.32.1, was used as a control for these mutants.
Mouse infection. Six- to 7-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (stock number 000664) and CBA/J mice
(stock number 000656) (both from The Jackson Laboratory, Inc., Bar Harbor, ME) were inoculated with
purified C. muridarum EBs at 2 � 105 or 1 � 107 inclusion-forming units (IFU) via different routes as
described previously (6, 45) and as indicated above and below for the individual experiments. For genital
tract infection via intravaginal and intrabursal inoculations, at 5 days prior to the inoculation, mice were
subcutaneously injected with 2.5 mg of colloidal depot medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera; Pharmacia
and Upjohn LLC, Kalamazoo, MI) suspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For intravaginal
inoculation (14, 15), the EB inoculum in 10 �l sucrose-phosphate-glutamate (SPG) buffer (220 mM
sucrose, 12.5 mM phosphate, 4 mM L-glutamic acid, pH 7.5) was delivered into the mouse vagina using
a 20-�l micropipette tip. For intrabursal inoculation (71), the mice were anesthetized and placed dorsal
side up on a sterile gauze pad with the mouse head facing away. A small incision was made at the
dorsomedial position and directly above the ovarian fat pad. After the ovarian fat pad was gently pulled
out, the ovary was positioned to allow insertion of a needle (30-gauge removable needles; catalog
number 7803-07; Hamilton) into the oviduct tubule. When the needle was inserted into the proper
position, it was visible under the bursa. The plunger of the syringe (catalog number 7654-01; Hamilton)
was gently pushed to inject the 10 �l of inoculum, after which the needle was quickly removed and the
puncture site was gently sealed. Successful injections were indicated by slight distention of the bursa.
Finally, the reproductive tract and fat pad were gently reinserted into the peritoneal cavity and the body
wall was closed and sutured (Reli sutures; catalog number SK683; Reli, Busan, South Korea). After
recovery, the mice were returned to their cages for normal care.
For intragastric inoculation, the mouse was restrained to keep the animal immobile and in a position
where the head was slightly tilted back to keep the neck in a straight line for easier insertion of the
gavage needle. A 22-gauge, 25-mm-long, 2-mm-diameter, stainless steel, ball-tipped gavage needle
(Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) attached to a 1-ml tuberculin syringe was used to deliver the chlamydial

 inoculum in 100 �l SPG to each mouse stomach. Before insertion of the needle, the length from the tip
of nose to the last rib of the mouse was measured. This was done to ensure that the needle traversed
the esophagus into the stomach without causing asphyxiation (too short) or perforating the stomach
(too long). The gavage needle was inserted into the mouth at either side at about a 45-degree angle in
the direction that was chosen. Once inside, the needle was slid toward the back of the throat while
maintaining the position of the mouse’s head tilted back. The mice were observed carefully after the
gavage to ensure that no fluid escaped from the mouth or nose. After inoculation, the mice were
monitored for vaginal and rectal live organism shedding or sacrificed for evaluation of the pathology in
the upper genital tract.
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council (72). The protocol was approved by
the Committee on the Ethics of Laboratory Animal Experiments of the University of Texas Health Science
Center at San Antonio.
Titration of chlamydial organisms recovered from swab specimens. For the monitoring of
organism shedding, vaginal and rectal swab specimens were taken on day 3 postinoculation and weekly
thereafter. To quantitate the chlamydial organisms, each swab was soaked in 0.5 ml of SPG and vortexed
with glass beads to release the chlamydial organisms into the supernatants for titration of serial dilutions
on HeLa cell monolayers in duplicate using an immunofluorescence assay as described previously (16, 26,
44, 48). The total number of IFU per swab was converted into the log10 number of bacteria for calculation
of the mean and standard deviation for mice from the same group at each time point.
Mouse genital tract gross pathology evaluation. Upon euthanasia, mouse genital tracts were
excised and the gross pathology of the hydrosalpinx was documented by high-resolution digital
photography. Hydrosalpinx was further scored according to an ordinal scale, where 0 indicates no
hydrosalpinx, 1 indicates hydrosalpinx that is observable only under magnification, 2 indicates visible
hydrosalpinx smaller than the ovary, 3 indicates hydrosalpinx roughly equal to the size of the ovary, and
4 indicates hydrosalpinx larger than the ovary. The bilateral hydrosalpinx severity was calculated for each
mouse as the summed scores for the left and right oviducts. Hydrosalpinx incidence was calculated as
the number of mice with a bilateral score of 1 or higher divided by the number of mice in the group.
Immunofluorescence assay. The immunofluorescence assay used for titrating live organisms was
described previously (68, 73). Briefly, HeLa cells grown on coverslips were fixed with paraformaldehyde
(Sigma) and permeabilized with saponin (Sigma). After washing and blocking, the specimens were
subjected to a combination of antibody and chemical staining. Hoechst (blue; Sigma) was used to
visualize the nuclear DNA. A rabbit antichlamydial antibody (raised by immunization with C. muridarum
EBs; data not shown) plus a goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Cy2 (green; Jackson Immuno Research
Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) was used to visualize chlamydial inclusions. The cell samples after
immunolabeling were used for counting the inclusions under an Olympus AX-70 fluorescence micro-
scope equipped with multiple filter sets (Olympus, Melville, NY).
Statistical analyses. The number of organisms, expressed as the number of IFU, and the hydrosal-
pinx scores were compared between groups using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The incidences of
hydrosalpinx between groups were evaluated using Fisher’s exact probability test (http://vassarstats.net/
tab2x2.html). Correlations of chlamydial pathogenicity in the upper genital tract with the number of
chlamydial IFU recovered from vaginal and rectal swab specimens were analyzed by calculating Spear-
man rank-order correlation coefficients (http://vassarstats.net/corr_rank.html). Furthermore, the signifi-
cance of the difference between two correlation coefficients was also calculated (http://vassarstats.net/
rdiff.html).
