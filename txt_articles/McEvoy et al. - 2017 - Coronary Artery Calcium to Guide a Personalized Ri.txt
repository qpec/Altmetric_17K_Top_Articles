BACKGROUND: The use of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) 
risk to personalize systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment goals is a topic 
of increasing interest. Therefore, we studied whether coronary artery calcium 
(CAC) can further guide the allocation of anti-hypertensive treatment intensity.
METHODS: We included 3733 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study 
of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with SBP between 120 and 179 mm 
Hg. Within 
subgroups categorized by both SBP (120–139 mm 
Hg, 140–159 mm 
Hg, 
and 160–179 mm 
Hg) and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk (using the American 
College of Cardiology/American Heart Assocation pooled-cohort equations), 
we compared multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios for the composite outcome 
of incident ASCVD or heart failure after further stratifying by CAC (0, 1–100, or 
>100). We estimated 10-year number-needed-to-treat for an intensive SBP goal 
of 120 mm 
Hg by applying the treatment benefit recorded in meta-analyses to 
event rates within CAC strata.
RESULTS: The mean age was 65 years, and  642 composite events took 
place over a median of 10.2 years. In persons with SBP <160 mm 
Hg, CAC 
stratified risk for events. For example, among those with an ASCVD risk 
of <15% and who had an SBP of either 120 to 139 mm 
Hg or 140 to 159 
mm 
Hg, respectively, we found increasing hazard ratios for events with CAC 
1 to 100 (1.7 [95% confidence interval, 1.0–2.6] or 2.0 [1.1–3.8]) and CAC 
>100 (3.0 [1.8–5.0] or 5.7 [2.9–11.0]), all relative to CAC=0. There appeared 
to be no statistical association between CAC and events when SBP was 160 
to 179 mm Hg, irrespective of ASCVD risk level. Estimated 10-year number-
needed-to-treat for a SBP goal of 120mmHg varied substantially according to 
CAC levels when predicted ASCVD risk <15% and SBP <160mmHg (eg, 10-
year number-needed-to-treat of 99 for CAC=0 and 24 for CAC>100, when SBP 
120-139mm 
Hg). However, few participants with ASCVD risk <5% had elevated 
CAC. Furthermore, 10-year number-needed-to-treat estimates were consistently 
low and varied less among CAC strata when SBP was 160 to 179 mm 
Hg or 
when ASCVD risk was ≥15% at any SBP level.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined CAC imaging and assessment of global ASCVD 
risk has the potential to guide personalized SBP goals (eg, choosing a 
traditional goal of 140 or a more intensive goal of 120 mm 
Hg), particularly 
among adults with an estimated ASCVD risk of 5% to 15% and prehypertension 
or mild hypertension.

E
levated blood pressure (BP) is a major cause of heart 
disease, stroke, and heart failure, with more than 
972 million adults worldwide and approximately 1 
in 3 US adults diagnosed with hypertension.1 Although 
effective antihypertensive pharmacotherapies are widely 
available,2 controversy regarding the optimal systolic 
BP (SBP) threshold to initiate or intensify treatment has 
increased recently. For example, relying on data from 
randomized trials (and excluding observational results), 
a 2014 report by the eighth panel appointed to the Joint 
National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treat-
ment of High Blood Pressure found no trial evidence to 
support initiating therapy until an SBP of ≥150 mm 
Hg  in 
adults ˃60 years of age who do not have diabetes mel-
litus or chronic kidney disease.3 This recommendation 
was controversial4 and differs from other guidelines and 
advisories, the majority of which recommend a lower 
threshold of 140 mm 
Hg.
Furthermore, after these Joint National Committee on 
Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pres-
sure  recommendations were released, the landmark Sys-
tolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)5 reported 
significant improvements in outcomes, notably atheroscle-
rotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and heart failure, 
among 9361 high-risk nondiabetic hypertensive patients, 
˃50 years of age treated to a SBP target of ≤120 mm 
Hg 
versus the standard target of ≤140 mm 
Hg. Thus, ques-
tions remain about whom to treat and with what treatment 
intensity, particularly among individuals with prehyperten-
sion or mild hypertension.
In this context, interest has heightened in the use of 
global ASCVD risk estimates—in conjunction with SBP—
to guide initiation and titration treatment decisions for 
hypertension.6‒9 This strategy may allow providers to 
balance the tension between avoiding overtreatment 
among low-risk persons who are unlikely to benefit and 
intensifying treatment to achieve lower SBP in higher 
risk adults. Earlier reports of risk-based allocation of BP 
therapy have focused exclusively on risk estimates de-
rived from traditional clinical risk factors such as those 
included in the American College of Cardiology/Ameri-
can Heart Assocation 2013 ASCVD risk score.6,8,10,11
Coronary artery calcium (CAC), measured by noncon-
trast cardiac computerized tomography (CT), is a powerful 
subclinical marker of absolute and relative ASCVD risk, and 
it has been demonstrated to add incremental prognostic 
information to risk estimates derived from traditional risk 
factors.12‒14 In addition, previous analyses have suggested 
that CAC testing has the potential to personalize alloca-
tion of other preventive therapies (eg, aspirin or statin) by 
identifying individuals who are unlikely to obtain net benefit 
(eg, those with CAC=0 generally have low absolute 10-
year risk and, hence, high estimated number-needed-to-
treat [NNT]), as well as those who may be more likely to 
benefit because of high absolute risk (eg, CAC >100).15,16
Therefore, in this study, we sought to determine 
whether CAC might inform the identification of primary 
prevention candidates who are more likely to benefit 
from initiation or titration of antihypertensive therapy to 
a more intensive SBP goal of 120 mm 
Hg (compared 
with the current standard of 140 mm 
Hg).
METHODS
Study Participants
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a multicenter, 
multi-ethnic, 
prospective 
observational 
cohort 
study.17 
Between July 2000 and August 2002, MESA recruited 6814 
men and women 45 to 84 years of age from four ethnic groups 
(white, black, Chinese American, and Hispanic). Participants 
were enrolled from 6 geographically distinct US communities. 
Exclusion criteria included clinical CVD at baseline. All partici-
pants provided informed consent, and the study was approved 
by the institutional review boards at all field centers.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• A given magnitude of blood pressure lowering 
provides similar relative benefit at all levels of car-
diovascular disease risk but progressively greater 
absolute benefit (and therefore a lower number 
needed to treat) as risk increases, suggesting that 
persons at high risk are more likely to derive net 
benefit from more intensive blood pressure goals 
(eg, systolic ≤120 mm 
Hg as supported by the Sys-
tolic Blood Pressure Intervention trial [SPRINT]).
• To our knowledge, this study is the first to incor-
porate information on individual coronary artery 
calcium (CAC) burden to personalize the risk-based 
treatment of hypertension.
• Added to both traditional risk factor-based estima-
tion of cardiovascular disease risk and a discussion 
of patient treatment preferences, CAC can help 
identify individuals who may benefit from more inten-
sive treatment to a systolic blood pressure goal of 
≤120 mm 
Hg versus a more traditional goal of ≤140 
mm 
Hg.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Information on CAC burden (particularly when CAC 
results have already been obtained for other rea-
sons) may be considered when making personal-
ized treatment decisions about blood pressure 
targets, particularly among persons with an esti-
mated cardiovascular disease risk between 5% and 
15% and who have either prehypertension or mild 
hypertension.
• A precision medicine clinical trial evaluating risk-
based blood pressure treatment goals, preferably 
incorporating CAC and not just risk factor-based 
estimations, is now needed.

The primary sample for this analysis excluded MESA 
participants with baseline systolic BP levels ˂120 mm 
Hg 
(n=2939) and ≥180 mm 
Hg (n=136). We excluded persons 
with SBP <120 mm 
Hg a priori because we determined that 
CAC screening among these adults for the purposes of BP 
management would be inappropriate because treating adults 
with SBP <120 to even lower BPs (irrespective of CAC) is 
difficult to justify. We also excluded those with SBP ≥180 
mm 
Hg because (1) this was an outlier SBP phenotype in the 
sample (just 1.9%); (2) SBP at this level is consistent with 
hypertensive urgency, is high risk, and requires rapid therapy 
not CAC testing to target specific goals; and (3) we did not 
want to include individuals with possible secondary hyper-
tension in the analysis. In addition, we excluded 6 persons 
with missing information on baseline SBP or BP medication 
use, leaving 3733 participants in total. We also conducted 
secondary analyses using a subsample of MESA participants 
who fulfilled SPRINT criteria.5 This subsample included only 
patients without diabetes mellitus who were ˃50 years of age 
with systolic BP ≥130 mm 
Hg and had any 1 of the following; 
Framingham CVD 10-year risk ≥15%, left ventricular hyper-
trophy by electrocardiogram or ankle-brachial index <0.9, or 
estimated glomerular filtration rate between 20 and 59 mL/
min/1.73 m2. After exclusions, this subsample included 1394 
participants.
CV Risk Factors
Race, family history of myocardial infarction, and smoking 
status were collected by self-report. Body mass index was 
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters 
squared. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a fasting blood 
glucose concentration of ≥126 mg/dL, self-report, or the 
use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications. Seated BP 
was recorded after a minimum of 5 minutes rest as the mean 
of the last 2 of 3 seated measurements using a Dinamap 
Pro-100 automated oscillometric sphygmomanometer.18 
Participants were asked to bring their medications to the 
clinic, and antihypertensive and statin drug use was assessed 
with a medication inventory. Total cholesterol, high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride measurements were 
performed in blood samples obtained after a 12-hour fast. 
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated using the 
Friedewald equation. The 10-year risk of hard ASCVD events 
for MESA participants was estimated using the American 
College of Cardiology/American Heart Assocation Pooled 
Cohort Equations (with Hispanics/Chinese calculated as 
white).10
Cardiac CT Protocol
The MESA scanning protocol has been published.19 Cardiac 
CT was performed at baseline at 3 MESA sites using a car-
diac-gated electron-beam CT scanner (Imatron C-150XL, 
GE-Imatron) and at 3 sites using a 64-slice multidetector CT 
scanner. Both scanner types produce near identical results.19 
Intra- and interobserver agreements were excellent (κ = 0.93 
and κ = 0.90, respectively). Although no action was required 
based on CAC results, participants were told that they had no 
CAC or that the amount was less than average, average, or 
greater than average for their age and sex, and to discuss the 
results with their physicians.
Definition of CV Events
The primary end point of all-cause CVD or hospitalized heart 
failure was prespecified to match the composite outcome used 
in SPRINT.5 Secondary individual end points included all-cause 
CVD, heart failure, all-cause coronary heart disease (CHD), 
and stroke. At intervals of 9 to 12 months, an interviewer 
contacted each subject or a family member about outpatient 
diagnoses of CHD or CVD, interim hospitalizations, and deaths. 
Two physicians from the MESA mortality and morbidity review 
committee independently classified events; in the event of 
disagreement, the full committee adjudicated. With follow-up 
through 2012, MESA was successful in obtaining information 
on 98% of reported hospitalized CVD and 95% of reported out-
patient CVD encounters.
All-cause CHD events were defined as myocardial infarction, 
death from CHD, probable angina resulting in revasculariza-
tion, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. All-cause CVD events were 
defined as all-cause CHD events plus cerebrovascular accident 
(transient ischemic attack or ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke), 
cerebrovascular accident death, or other CVD death. MESA 
reviewers classified incident heart failure as definite, probable, 
or absent. Probable or definite hospitalized heart failure both 
required symptoms, such as shortness of breath or edema, 
as baseline criteria. Probable hospitalized heart failure further 
required heart failure diagnosed by a physician and patient 
receiving medical treatment for heart failure. To meet criteria 
for definite hospitalized heart failure, 1 or more additional fac-
tors, such as pulmonary edema by X-ray, poor left ventricular 
systolic function, or diastolic dysfunction, were also required. 
Participants who suffered both CVD and heart failure were cen-
sored from this analysis after the first event. More details of 
the MESA follow-up methods are available at the MESA website 
(http://www.mesa-nhlbi.org).
Statistical Analysis
To examine the potential implications of CAC testing for both 
intensification (eg, titration) and initiation of BP therapy to a 
more intensive SBP goal, we included persons with and with-
out baseline anti-hypertensive medication use (Table 1). We 
calculated proportions for categorical variables and either 
mean±standard deviation or median±interquartile range for 
continuous variables with normal and non-normal distributions, 
respectively. Groups were compared using 2-sample t test, 
Mann-Whitney, or χ-square testing as appropriate.
In survival analyses, participants were categorized into 
these systolic BP categories: <140 mm 
Hg (ie, either 120–139 
mm 
Hg for the MESA study sample or 130–139 mm 
Hg for the 
SPRINT-eligible subsample), 140 to 159 mm 
Hg, and 160 to 
179 mm 
Hg. Then to evaluate whether CAC can personalize 
risk assessment among subgroups of varying SBP and ASCVD 
risk estimates, these BP categories were further stratified on 
the basis of, first, 10-year ASCVD risk (<15% or ≥15%,5,6,20 
which was the median level of risk in our primary sample), and, 
second, CAC group (0, 1–100, >100). We compared crude 
event (incidence) rates and Cox multivariable-adjusted hazard 
ratios within each of these CAC strata.
Models were adjusted for age, sex, race, body mass index, 
fasting glucose, diabetes mellitus status (yes or no), creatinine, 
smoking category, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, statin use, and

family history of myocardial infarction (yes or no). In models 
where the sample was stratified by ASCVD (<15% or ≥15%), 
we adjusted for core demographics and variables not included 
in the ASCVD equation (body mass index, creatinine, triglycer-
ides, statin use, and family history of myocardial infarction). We 
conducted sensitivity analyses with more parsimonious mod-
els adjusted just for demographics alone (age, sex, and race). 
Using the 13 variables included in the primary model, we also 
constructed a propensity score for the composite outcome 
within each of the CAC subgroups and adjusted the model for 
this score as a single variable.
We estimated a 10-year number needed to treat to prevent 
the primary outcome of all-cause CVD or heart failure (10-year 
NNT [NNT10]) with treatment initiation or intensification to a SBP 
goal of 120 mm 
Hg. This number was calculated by applying 
the expected relative risk reduction derived either from meta-
analysis (22% reduction in CHD, 41% reduction in stroke, and 
24% reduction in heart failure for each 10 mm 
Hg lowering of 
SBP21) in the primary sample or directly from SPRINT (25% 
relative reduction for a target of 120 mm 
Hg versus a target of 
140 mm 
Hg5) in the secondary analysis of the SPRINT-eligible 
subsample. The NNT10 was calculated directly as the reciprocal 
of the absolute risk difference at the median follow-up of the 
cohort on the basis of Kaplan-Meier estimates and was subse-
quently adjusted to an NNT10 according to the Altman-Anderson 
method.22 In a sensitivity analysis, using the same statistical 
techniques, we modeled NNT10 for an SBP goal of 130 mm 
Hg. 
We also conducted a sensitivity analysis of NNT10 for a goal

Hg using risk categorization that included lower cut 
points of 10-year estimated ASCVD risk (<5% or <10%). Finally, 
we estimated NNT10 for an SBP goal of 120 mm 
Hg to prevent 
each of the individual end points included in the main composite 
(CHD, stroke, and heart failure), and we also conducted analyses 
in the diabetic mellitus subgroup of our primary MESA sample.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of the primary sample and the 
SPRINT-eligible subsample, stratified by anti-hyperten-
sive medication use are shown in Table 1. Except for a 
lower proportion of males and being less likely to smoke, 
persons receiving BP therapy at baseline were older and 
had a higher burden of ASCVD risk factors than those 
who were not on BP therapy at baseline. Those receiving 
BP therapy also had higher SBP than those not on ther-
apy. Diastolic BP levels, although clinically similar (75.6 
vs 76.2 mm 
Hg), were statistically lower among those on 
BP therapy. The distribution of CAC also differed accord-
ing to baseline BP treatment status (Figure 1).
Over a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 10.2 
(9.7–10.7) years, 642 primary composite outcome 
events (all-cause CVD or heart failure) occurred in the 
sample overall. Figure 2 demonstrates that cumulative 
event-free survival was significantly lower, in both the 
primary sample and SPRINT-eligible subsample, among 
individuals with CAC 1 to 100 and >100, compared with 
those with CAC=0. Similar trends were demonstrated 
after stratification by baseline SBP category (online-
only Data Supplement Figure I). These trends were also 
qualitatively similar for the individual outcomes of CHD, 
stroke, and heart failure (online-only Data Supplement 
Figure II).
Among persons in the primary sample who were not 
on baseline BP therapy, event rates were low for those 
with CAC=0 and SBP between 120 and 139 mm 
Hg (5.6 
per 1000 person-years) or between 140 and 159 mm 
Hg 
(7.4 per 1000 person-years). However, event rates ap-

with untreated SBP between 160 and 179 mm 
Hg (rang-
ing from ≈20–40 per 1000 person-years; Table 2). In 
general, event rates were also consistently higher among 
those on baseline BP therapy compared with untreated 
individuals within each of the BP and CAC strata. Of note, 
however, persons not on BP therapy with SBP between 
120 and 139 mm 
Hg and CAC >100 had a similar event 
rate (24.3 per 1000 person-years) as individuals on ther-
apy with both poorly controlled hypertension (SBP 160–
179 mm 
Hg) and CAC=0 (20.2 per 1000 person-years).
Adjusted Cox models confirmed that, relative to 
CAC=0, CAC 1 to 100 and CAC >100 carried incremen-
tal excess in hazard for events among persons with SBP 
in the 120 to 139 mm 
Hg and 140 to 159 mm 
Hg ranges 
irrespective of baseline treatment status (Table 2). How-
ever, associations between CAC and hazard for events 
among those with SBP 160 to 179 mm 
Hg were not 
statistically significant, either with or without baseline 
therapy. All of these trends were qualitatively similar in 
the SPRINT-eligible subsample.
Table 3 demonstrates findings after individuals within 
each SBP category, both untreated and treated com-
bined, were stratified by estimated 10-year ASCVD risk 
(above or below the sample median of 15%). Those 
with CAC=0 had low event rates in both the 120 to 139

Hg (4.6 per 1,000 person-years) and 140 to 159 
mm 
Hg BP categories (6.9 per 1000 person-years) as 
long as ASCVD risk was <15%. Event rates were compa-
rably higher (>7.5 per 1000 person-years) in all persons 
with SBP between 160 and 179 mm 
Hg. Furthermore, 
persons with baseline ASCVD risk ≥15% at all levels 
of baseline SBP also had higher event rates, again ir-
respective of CAC level (ranging from ≈13–46 per 1000 
person-years).
Adjusted Cox models demonstrated increased hazard 
for events with CAC 1 to 100 and CAC >100 (vs CAC=0) 
among those who had SBP levels in the range of 120 
to 139 mm 
Hg and 140 to 159 mm 
Hg but no statisti-
cal association of CAC with CVD among those with SBP 
160 to 179 mm 
Hg (Table 3). Excess relative hazard with 
increasing CAC strata was most pronounced in those 
with estimated ASCVD risk <15%. Parsimonious demo-
graphic-adjusted and propensity score-adjusted models 
produced similar results (online-only Data Supplement 
Tables I through IV). As in Table 2, all of these trends 
were qualitatively similar in the SPRINT-eligible subsam-
ple. None of the hazard ratios presented in Table 3 dem-
onstrated any interaction by race.
The absolute differences in event rates according to 
baseline CAC translated into substantial variation in es-
timated NNT10 to prevent all-cause CVD or heart failure 
with BP lowering to a SBP goal of 120 mm 
Hg. For ex-
ample, a low NNT10 (between 4 and 8), was estimated

for persons with CAC >100 in both the SBP 140 to 159 
mm 
Hg and 160 to 179 mm 
Hg categories irrespective 
of baseline estimated ASCVD risk (Table 4). In contrast, 
participants with CAC=0 had higher estimated NNT10 
at all levels of baseline SBP and ASCVD risk. Persons 
with SBP <140 mm 
Hg, ASCVD risk <15% and CAC=0 
had the highest NNT10 estimates (NNT10=99). Likely 
because of the higher baseline SBP and ASCVD risk 
in those who were SPRINT eligible, with higher conse-
quent event rates, all NNT10 levels were relatively low 
in this subsample. The NNT10 results were qualitatively 
similar when the sample overall was stratified by base-
line treatment status (as such, NNT10 for a goal SBP of 
120 mm 
Hg was similar for both initiation of BP therapy 
and intensification of prior therapy; online-only Data 
Supplement Table V). Because CAC stratifies absolute 
risk for CHD, stroke, and heart failure, the NNT10 trends 
seen for the composite outcome are mirrored in each 
of the individual outcomes (online-only Data Supple-
ment Table VI).
Figure 3 summarizes the range of NNT10 estimates af-
ter stratification by baseline CAC, with findings most wide-
ly dispersed among those with ASCVD risk <15% and who 
had either prehypertension or mild hypertension. In addi-
tion, sensitivity analyses evaluating lower ASCVD risk cut 
points suggested that, among participants with SBP 120 
to 139 mm 
Hg, 32% of persons with ASCVD risk <7.5% 
had CAC>0 (with NNT10 estimates for a 120 mm 
Hg SBP 
goal of 76 for CAC1–100 and 47 for CAC>100), where-
as CAC>0 was less frequent and NNT10 estimates were

*NNT for the MESA sample is calculated as follows: for each SBP category, we took the mean SBP in this category and subtracted 120 to get the target 
BP reduction (eg, if mean is 130 mm Hg in the SBP <140 mm Hg category, then to achieve 120 mm Hg, the target reduction would be 10 mm Hg). For each 
10 mm Hg reduction, we estimate a 22% reduction in CHD, 41% reduction in stroke, and 24% reduction in HF.
†NNT for the SPRINT subsample assumes a 25% relative reduction in the main outcome.
‡ <140 SBP is 120‒139 mm Hg for primary sample and 130‒139 mm Hg for SPRINT subsample.

higher among those with ASCVD risk <5% (eg, NNT10 
estimates for a 120 mm 
Hg SBP goal of 180 for the 
20% with CAC 1‒100 and 37 for the 3% with CAC>100) 
(online-only Data Supplement Table VII).
The exploratory analysis of diabetics in our sample 
suggested that NNT10 estimates were low, irrespective 
of CAC, among those with 10-year ASCVD risk ≥15%. 
Too few diabetics in our sample had ASCVD risk <15% 
to judge whether CAC has any role in guiding risk-based 
BP therapy in this setting (online-only Data Supplement 
Table VIII). Finally, online-only Data Supplement Table IX 
demonstrates our NNT10 estimates from the sensitivity 
analysis evaluating an SBP goal of 130 mm 
Hg. As ex-
pected, NNT10 estimates were higher (ie, less benefit) 
when targeting 130 mm 
Hg compared with 120 mm 
Hg 
systolic, particularly among those at highest risk as 
 
reflected by elevated baseline CAC.
DISCUSSION
Our results add to an emerging body of literature sug-
gesting that ASCVD risk may be useful in defining more 
personalized BP goals and could guide a precision medi-
cine approach for both initiation and intensification of anti-
hypertensive treatment. First, CAC was a powerful deter-
minant of absolute risk for the composite of all-cause CVD 
or heart failure. Second, persons with CAC=0 in both the 
prehypertension (120–139 mm 
Hg) and mild hypertension 
(140–159 mm 
Hg) SBP categories had low 10-year event 
rates (eg, <7.5 per 1000 person-years). This finding was 
particularly true for those not already on BP therapy at 
baseline, in whom the decision to initiate treatment may 
be under consideration, but also applied to persons on 
baseline therapy in whom intensification of treatment 
may be considered. All participants with SBP >160 
mm 
Hg had high event rates irrespective of CAC levels.
Third, CAC may be most suitable for guiding therapeu-
tic decisions (specifically, either initiation or intensifica-
tion to a more intensive systolic goal of 120 mm 
Hg) when 
both SBP is between 120 and 159 mm 
Hg and 10-year 
ASCVD has been estimated as <15%. In these individu-
als, CAC=0 yielded a higher estimated NNT for persons 
with SBP 140 to 159 mm 
Hg (NNT10= 36) and, above 
all, for those with SBP between 120 and 139 mm 
Hg 
(NNT10= 99), suggesting lower likelihood for benefit. The 
latter group consists of those in whom the decision to 
treat to a more intensive goal of 120 mm 
Hg (compared 
with the traditional goal of 140 mm 
Hg) may be most 
challenging in the context of results from SPRINT. Given 
that 97% of MESA participants with estimated ASCVD 
risk <5% have CAC <100 and NNT10 estimates ranging 
from 180 to 273, our sensitivity analyses suggest that 
CAC may be most practical for this purpose when SBP 
is between 120 and 159 mm 
Hg and estimated ASCVD 
risk is between 5% and 15%.
These inferences are most appropriately applied to 
general community intermediate- to low-risk populations 
similar to MESA. Our secondary analysis results suggest

erosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or heart failure using a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 120 
mm Hg among categories of baseline SBP and 10-year ASCVD risk estimates (primary MESA sample, N=3733). 
The number-needed-to-treat (NNT) estimates within each category of ASCVD risk (calculated using traditional risk factors 
according to the 2013 ACC/AHA pooled cohort equations14) and SBP consist of mean 10-year NNT (NNT10) for persons with 
CAC=0 (upper limit), mean NNT10 for persons with CAC 1 to 100 (solid square), and mean NNT10 for persons with CAC 
>100 (lower limit)

that the relatively few adults fulfilling strict SPRINT eligi-
bility criteria (just 7.6% of the overall US population23) 
are, by definition, at high risk for CVD or heart failure, 
and the further use of CAC imaging in these individuals 
may be less helpful in deciding SBP goals.
The traditional paradigm of allocating BP therapy 
solely on BP values makes intuitive and physiological 
sense. However, data have consistently demonstrated 
that, although the relative risk reduction in events per 
unit of SBP lowering is the same, the absolute risk 
reduction, NNT and, hence, clinical efficacy of BP 
treatment increases as baseline absolute ASCVD risk 
increases.8 In fact, the idea of using baseline ASCVD 
risk to guide BP therapy is not new.24,25 Moreover, the 
concept of using risk to allocate ASCVD prevention 
therapies has taken center stage after the release of 
2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Assocation guidelines for the treatment of cholesterol in 
adults, which recommend statins be considered based 
on an ASCVD risk of ≥7.5% and not solely on low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol values.26
Indeed, recent data from the Heart Outcomes Pre-
vention Evaluation trial (HOPE)-3 support the concept 
of risk-based allocation of BP therapy. In this study, 
12 
705 intermediate-risk adults with baseline SBP of 
138 mm 
Hg were randomized to placebo or to a com-
bination of 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 16 mg 
candesartan. Despite a relative SBP reduction of 6 
mm 
Hg (which was notably less than the 14.8 mm 
Hg 
achieved in SPRINT), the intermediate-risk adults en-
rolled in HOPE-3 did not derive benefit.27 Thus, SPRINT 
supports intensive BP control (SBP goal of 120 mm 
Hg) 
in high-risk patients, whereas HOPE-3 suggested that 
intermediate-risk patients may be suitable for less strin-
gent SBP goals. However, our findings introduce the 
potential value of CAC testing in this intermediate-risk 
group to reclassify individual risk and inform more per-
sonalized intensive SBP goals in those with advanced 
subclinical atherosclerosis.
Presumably BP values will always be important in 
allocating antihypertensive therapy, and our data sup-
port this. Specifically, participants in our analysis with 
SBP >160 mm 
Hg had high event rates and low NNT 
irrespective of baseline ASCVD risk or CAC. With the 
exception of those with ASCVD risk <15% and CAC=0, 
this was also true for persons with BP 140 to 159 
mm 
Hg. Nonetheless, adding ASCVD risk into BP treat-
ment decisions could potentially allow consideration of 
therapy for a large number of persons with SBP lev-
els that, before SPRINT, were otherwise not typically 
considered to benefit from treatment initiation or inten-
sification (eg, those with SBP 120–139 mm 
Hg).6 For 
example, Karmali et al11 found that most excess ASCVD 
events occur in persons with BP levels considered at 
goal by the 8th Joint National Committee on Detection, 
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure  and 
that the vast majority of those who suffer these events 
have elevated ASCVD risk. 
Estimating risk based on traditional risk factors 
alone can be misleading,28 and CAC has been repeat-
edly shown to improve the accuracy of risk assess-
ment.29,30 Furthermore, we have previously shown that 
CAC may inform NNT estimation for other ASCVD pre-
vention therapies.15,16 In addition, CAC and intensive 
BP control such as that used in SPRINT both have sup-
portive evidence for cost-effectiveness.31,32 As such, 
our data could extend the utility of CAC to guiding risk-
based determination of more personalized systolic BP 
goals in persons with mild hypertension and prehyper-
tension. This may be relevant for deciding whether to 
refer for CAC imaging but is particularly meaningful 
for those who have already had CAC testing for other 
reasons.
It is important to note that our analyses incorporate 
clinically relevant information on both baseline BP and 
estimated ASCVD risk into the calculation of CAC-based 
NNT estimates. This approach is crucial because we 
believe that CAC should not be used in isolation in this 
context. Specifically, as long as ASCVD risk is <15% and 
SBP is between 120 and 159 mm 
Hg, our results sug-
gest the potential for CAC=0 to allow more liberal BP 
treatment goals (eg, 140 mm 
Hg), particularly if based 
on individual patient preferences.33 Indeed, CAC may be 
most helpful in cases where physicians are considering 
intensifying treatment to a SPRINT-based SBP goal of 
<120 mm 
Hg among persons with SBP between 120 
and 139 mm 
Hg (ie, levels below the current traditional 
goal of 140 mm 
Hg). In this setting, when ASCVD risk is 
<15%, a CAC=0 yields an NNT10 of ≈100, information 
that could guide the clinical-patient treatment discus-
sion. Given the low burden of CAC and events among 
those with ASCVD estimates <5%, CAC imaging to guide 
personalized SBP goals may be best suited to persons 
with estimated ASCVD risk 5% to 15%.
Although we found that CAC-based NNT10 estimates 
were generally higher for a target of 130 mm Hg (vs 
120 mm Hg), the overall message was the same: 
NNT10 estimates for the prevention of ASCVD or heart 
failure suggest that lower systolic targets (eg, either 
120 or 130 mm Hg) may be superior to the traditional 
target of 140 mm Hg when: (1) SBP is >160 mm Hg, 
(2) estimated CVD risk using traditional risk factors 
is >15%, and, most important, (3) CAC>100 among 
those individuals currently in the therapeutic “grey 
zone” (ie, those with SBP in the prehypertension and 
mild hypertension range and who are at intermediate 
risk by CVD risk scores).
Our analysis has some limitations. Although we be-
lieve that our findings may have important clinical impli-
cations and can guide future investigation, they are hy-
pothesis-generating because of the observational nature 
of the data and the limited numbers of events among

certain subgroups. The latter consideration is most rel-
evant among those with SBP 160 to 179 mm 
Hg and for 
our SPRINT-eligible subsample. Our NNT estimates are 
based on a number of assumptions (in particular that the 
relative risk reduction for BP therapy is similar among 
CAC strata). Nonetheless, we feel they are informative. 
Although some have argued that SPRINT SBP values 
cannot easily be translated into routine care,34 we note 
that the MESA BP measurement protocol was nearly 
identical to SPRINT and that MESA also used automated 
oscillometric BP measurement devices. Because MESA 
was not designed to capture accurate time-to-event data 
on side effects of anti-hypertensive medication (eg, elec-
trolyte imbalance or injurious falls), we do not have abso-
lute event rates for these outcomes among CAC strata, 
and we are unable to generate number-needed-to-harm 
estimates. For simplicity, we did not incorporate infor-
mation on diastolic BP because the optimal goal for this 
parameter (80–89 mm 
Hg) is more widely agreed on, 
because diastolic BP does not typically add to ASCVD 
risk estimation over and above SBP, and because so few 
MESA participants had isolated diastolic hypertension 
(n=40, 0.6%).
CONCLUSION
Assessment of CAC may inform more personalized BP 
goals (eg, choosing between a traditional SBP goal of 
140 mm Hg or a more intensive goal of 120 mm Hg), 
particularly among persons with baseline 10-year AS-
CVD risk estimates between 5% and 15% and who 
have systolic BP levels between 120 and 159 mm Hg. 
Specifically, among these individuals, CAC >100 ap-
pears to identify those who would likely benefit from 
an intensive SBP goal of 120 mm 
Hg, whereas CAC=0 
identifies individuals who may be suitable for more 
traditional SBP goals, thereby avoiding unnecessary 
intensification of medication and instead focusing on 
healthy lifestyle measures. A trial of risk-based alloca-
tion of BP treatment goals, preferably incorporating 
CAC, is needed.
