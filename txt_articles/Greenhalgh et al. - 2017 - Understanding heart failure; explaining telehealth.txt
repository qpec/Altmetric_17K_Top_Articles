Understanding heart failure; explaining
telehealth – a hermeneutic systematic review
Trisha Greenhalgh*
, Christine A’Court and Sara Shaw
Abstract
Background: Enthusiasts for telehealth extol its potential for supporting heart failure management. But randomised
trials have been slow to recruit and produced conflicting findings; real-world roll-out has been slow. We sought to
inform policy by making sense of a complex literature on heart failure and its remote management.
Methods: Through database searching and citation tracking, we identified 7 systematic reviews of systematic
reviews, 32 systematic reviews (including 17 meta-analyses and 8 qualitative reviews); six mega-trials and over 60
additional relevant empirical studies and commentaries. We synthesised these using Boell’s hermeneutic
methodology for systematic review, which emphasises the quest for understanding.
Results: Heart failure is a complex and serious condition with frequent co-morbidity and diverse manifestations
including severe tiredness. Patients are often frightened, bewildered, socially isolated and variably able to self-
manage. Remote monitoring technologies are many and varied; they create new forms of knowledge and new
possibilities for care but require fundamental changes to clinical roles and service models and place substantial
burdens on patients, carers and staff. The policy innovation of remote biomarker monitoring enabling timely
adjustment of medication, mediated by “activated” patients, is based on a modernist vision of efficient, rational,
technology-mediated and guideline-driven (“cold”) care. It contrasts with relationship-based (“warm”) care valued by
some clinicians and by patients who are older, sicker and less technically savvy. Limited uptake of telehealth can be
analysed in terms of key tensions: between tidy, “textbook” heart failure and the reality of multiple comorbidities;
between basic and intensive telehealth; between activated, well-supported patients and vulnerable, unsupported
ones; between “cold” and “warm” telehealth; and between fixed and agile care programmes.
Conclusion: The limited adoption of telehealth for heart failure has complex clinical, professional and institutional
causes, which are unlikely to be elucidated by adding more randomised trials of technology-on versus technology-
off to an already-crowded literature. An alternative approach is proposed, based on naturalistic study designs,
application of social and organisational theory, and co-design of new service models based on socio-technical
principles. Conventional systematic reviews (whose goal is synthesising data) can be usefully supplemented by
hermeneutic reviews (whose goal is deepening understanding).
Keywords: Heart failure, Telehealth, Systematic review, Hermeneutic review, Patient experience
Background
The use of telehealth technology in heart failure man-
agement remains controversial, with some clinicians
and
policymakers
strongly
enthusiastic
[1–4]
and
others unconvinced or opposed [5–7]. Despite dozens of
randomised controlled trials (including several megatrials
[8–13]), over 20 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
clinical trials [14–33] and (at last count) 7 systematic re-
views of systematic reviews [6, 34–39], as well as studies
of cost-effectiveness [21, 40–43], the patient experience
[18, 24, 44–47] and service organisation [32, 48–51], there
is limited agreement on which outcomes matter; the ex-
tent to which telehealth adds benefit over usual care; how
best (if at all) to change service models to support tele-
health; and whether and in what circumstances telehealth
is cost-effective.

 In the context of high and rising prevalence of heart fail-
ure [52–54] and its unenviable position atop the league
table of reasons for hospital readmission [55], recruitment
of heart failure patients to clinical trials of telehealth is
consistently poor [17, 32, 56–58]; roll-out and scale-up of
telehealth services for heart failure in real-world settings is
slow [32, 49, 59–63]; and robust business models are lack-
ing [5]. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been
criticised for major methodological flaws [6, 33, 36, 38, 39,
64, 65] and economic evaluations for their questionable
and/or unstated assumptions [42]. The service and regula-
tory context is under-researched.
In sum, the literature on telehealth in heart failure is a
policymaker’s nightmare: vast, fragmented, heteroge-
neous, of variable quality and with no clear answers to
the question of what technologies, supported by what
service infrastructure, to provide for whom.
In a paper entitled ‘What makes an academic paper use-
ful for health policy?’
, Chris Whitty emphasised that the
most useful contribution academics can make to a con-
tested topic area is a succinct and integrative overview in-
corporating
quantitative,
qualitative
and
economic
evidence which, above all, makes sense of the field [66]. In
this study, we sought to produce a scholarly synthesis of
the key questions, theoretical perspectives and empirical
findings on the topic of telehealth in heart failure with a
view to informing a new empirical study by our own team.
We began with five research questions, which we
modified as the study progressed:
1. What is heart failure and what do we know about its
prevalence, diagnosis, prognosis, co-morbidities and
management?
2. What technologies are available to support remote
clinical care in heart failure?
3. How might these technologies improve – or indeed
worsen – the organisation, delivery and cost of heart
failure services?
4. How might telehealth technologies and services
influence, and be influenced by, the patient’s
experience of heart failure and his or her capacity to
cope with it?
5. What explains the low uptake of telehealth by
patients, staff and organisations – both within and
beyond the clinical trial setting?
Study design and setting
The study had two phases: secondary research (hermen-
eutic systematic review, reported here) and a qualitative
case study of telehealth, linked to a randomised con-
trolled trial (to be reported elsewhere). These phases
were overlapping; emerging findings from the review fed
into the design of the qualitative study and influenced
the data analysis.
Method
The study was part of the SCALS (Studies in Co-
creating Assisted Living Solutions) Senior Investigator
Award to TG from the Wellcome Trust and was also
supported by the knowledge translation component of
the Oxford Biomedical Research Centre. Governance in-
cluded 6-monthly meetings of an external steering group
with an independent lay chair. Research ethics approval
was not needed for the study reported here.
We used an interpretive approach so as to meaningfully
synthesise and critique the extensive existing literature. In
their introduction to hermeneutic systematic review
(shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1), Boell and Cecez-
Kecmanovic observed that “highly structured approaches
[to systematic review] downplay the importance of reading
and dialogical interaction between the literature and the
researcher; continuing interpretation and questioning; crit-
ical assessment and imagination; argument development
and writing – all highly intellectual and creative activities,
seeking originality rather than replicability” [67].
Hermeneutic review consists of two interlinked cycles:
[a] accessing and interpreting the literature and [b] de-
veloping an argument. Searching is systematic but flex-
ible and iterative. As sources accumulate, it becomes
necessary to interpret, clarify and understand the emer-
ging ideas and perspectives and to reject less relevant
sources through progressive focusing [67]. This feeds
into the lower cycle in Fig. 1.
TG began with a generic PubMed search for ‘heart
failure’ and ‘telehealth’
, including synonyms for both. She
quickly identified a sample of highly-cited review articles
covering both quantitative and qualitative research [5, 7,
17, 21, 38, 52, 65, 68–70]. She used citation tracking in
Google Scholar to identify subsequent articles that had
cited these seminal sources [71]. Of hundreds of poten-
tially relevant titles and abstracts, she used one over-
riding question to select a sample of papers for full-text
analysis: is this paper likely to add meaning to our emer-
ging overview of the field? To prevent the dataset be-
coming unmanageably large, systematic reviews (and
critiques of these reviews) were used as far as possible.
Selected individual papers were included to add richness
to the synthesis.
CAC (a general practitioner with a special interest in car-
diology) selected additional sources describing the current
understanding of heart failure, with reference to national
and European guidelines, selected conference abstracts and
recently published reviews known to her. Peer reviewers se-
lected by the editor pointed us to additional sources.
We stored and managed included studies on an End-
note database. We created a simple data extraction form
to summarise key data, arguments and explanations
from each source. Beginning with seminal reviews, we
began to craft a narrative synthesis of the key questions,

 theories, methods, findings and scholarly arguments
relevant to our research questions. We progressively re-
fined this synthesis as further papers were added.
Results
Included sources are summarised in Table 1 (the hermen-
eutic design precluded a conventional study flowchart).
Findings fell into seven broad headings: heart failure as a
clinical condition; heart failure as a lived experience; studies
of self-management; descriptions of technologies; experi-
mental trials of telehealth technologies; economic analyses;
and implementation studies. We consider these in turn.
Heart failure as a clinical condition
Heart failure affects 1–4% of the adult population; it is
commoner in ethnic minorities [5, 7, 52, 72]. It has
multiple
causes
and
complex
pathophysiology
(see
Additional file 1). On average, four to five comorbidities
add to symptom and treatment burden and influence
prognosis, and co-existing frailty is common [73].
Early clinical trials focused on people with heart failure
with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) [52]. Increas-
ingly, heart failure is defined primarily by its clinical
characteristics even in research studies; recent telehealth
trials have included participants who have heart failure

 with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). These issues
are discussed in more detail in Additional file 1 [52].
The incidence (new cases per year) of heart failure
in high-income countries has reportedly been stable
for a generation, attributed to the falling incidence of
coronary heart disease offset by improved survival
from myocardial infarction (the commonest precursor
to HFREF). However, its prevalence (total number of
cases in a population) is rising because of improved
disease-specific survival and general population ageing
[7, 52, 53, 74, 75]. Furthermore, since HFPEF is
largely a disease of the elderly that is strongly linked to
hypertension, diabetes, obesity and atrial fibrillation, all of
which are becoming commoner [76], some authors pre-
dict an impending increase in both incidence and preva-
lence of heart failure with a rising proportion of cases
being HFPEF [77]. HFREF may also be set to increase in
incidence as cancer patients who have received cardio-
toxic chemotherapy survive long term [52].
Heart failure was traditionally managed with diuretics,
digoxin and fluid restriction. Based on findings from nu-
merous clinical trials, guidelines now recommend that
all HFREF patients are prescribed the maximum toler-
ated dose of a beta-blocker and a drug acting on the
renin-angiotensin system, with other drugs added ac-
cording to severity [69, 78]. Efforts to achieve this are
known as ‘up-titration’ – a clinically tricky task, since
adverse effects are common with higher drug doses and
with combination therapy [69]; polypharmacy is a ser-
ious risk [79]. The proportion of UK patients actually re-
ceiving
the
medication
recommended
by
NICE
guidelines for HFREF varied from 33% to 75% in one re-
cent study, suggesting that there may be room for im-
provement [80]. A community-based study found a
similar evidence-practice gap [72].
Management of heart failure with preserved ejection
fraction (HFPEF) is controversial. Most trials (and most
meta-analyses) to date have excluded such patients; trials
that did include them are hard to interpret because of
heterogeneous inclusion criteria, high withdrawal rates,
small effect sizes and other limitations [69]. Diuretics,
beta-blockers and drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin
system may all improve aspects of morbidity but we
could find no evidence that they affect mortality in
HFPEF [69]. The receommended management strategy
for HFPEF is twofold: careful reduction of fluid overload
using diuretics and fluid restriction, which often entails
a fine balancing act as the stiffened ventricle makes these
patients vulnerable to over-diuresis, causing a critical re-
duction in cardiac output; and controlling predisposing
conditions such as hypertension or diabetes [53, 78].
Implantable
defibrillators,
which
do
not
affect
underlying ventricular function, and atrioventricular
synchronised biventricular pacemakers (also referred
to as cardiac resynchronisation therapy), which do,
have both been shown to improve survival in people
with moderate to severe chronic heart failure, though
the benefit-harm balance of such interventions in less
severe heart failure is less clear [65, 70]. Updated
guidelines for cardiac resynchronisation therapy advise
confining its use to HFREF patients with ejection
fraction below 35% [81].
The clinical course of heart failure is characterised by
progressive deterioration with bouts of (often unpredict-
able) acute or subacute decompensation from fluid over-
load, overdiuresis, non-adherence, infection or other
intercurrent illness (Fig. 2). Sudden death may occur at
any time due to arrhythmia, but more commonly there
is gradual death from pump failure or, in a significant
proportion, death from other cardiovascular or non-
cardiovascular causes [65, 82, 83]. This disease trajectory
makes heart failure an attractive test bed for those seek-
ing a bioengineering solution for monitoring response to
therapy and for predicting and pre-empting deterior-
ation through close remote monitoring of biomarkers,
thereby reducing expensive and disruptive hospital ad-
missions. It is also potentially a way of obtaining accur-
ate predictors of end-stage heart failure to inform timely
conversations about end-of-life care. However, most
people admitted to hospital with heart failure are not ad-
mitted for acute decompensated heart failure but for co-
morbidities and/or more general deterioration that are
addressed tangentially or not at all by disease-specific
guidelines and management protocols [52]. Because of
misclassifications, hospital episode statistics tend to
over-estimate the proportion of heart failure-related hos-
pital admissions that could be prevented by treatment
intensification in the outpatient setting [52].
Heart failure carries a five-year mortality of around
50% [84, 85]. Its prognosis is usually [52] but not invari-
ably [84] reported to be improving; the disparity prob-
ably reflects a change in definition and case mix over
time. Overall mortality figures mask considerable hetero-
geneity of outcome, which varies with setting at diagno-
sis (primary versus secondary care), first or subsequent
hospital
admission,
diagnostic
criteria
(particularly
whether and to what extent ejection fraction is reduced),
co-morbidities (particularly diabetes and cognitive im-
pairment) and degree of implementation of evidence-
based therapies [80, 85, 86].
Importantly,
people
with
heart
failure,
especially
those with HFPEF, rarely die of heart failure, and the
proportion of non-cardiovascular deaths in HFPEF is
rising [82, 83]. In one large primary care cohort, only
26% of deaths in people with heart failure could be
attributed to cardiovascular or cerebrovascular causes
and 12% to heart failure, and there was no improve-
ment in overall survival over time [82].

 Heart failure management is delivered by multi-
disciplinary teams which generally include cardiologists
and hospital-based specialist nurses plus primary care
clinicians
(GP,
pharmacist,
community
nurse)
and
(where necessary) palliative care specialists [87]. Com-
munication and co-ordination between team members is
critical. A large qualitative study, including over 200 in-
terviews with staff in 50 centres across Canada, explored
multi-disciplinary care of advanced heart failure and
found that a high degree of adaptive behaviour (what
Mol has described as “tinkering” [88]) was needed from
the various clinicians to respond to patients’ emergent
needs and achieve the best outcome in a particular set of
circumstances [87].
Heart failure as a lived experience
There is an extensive literature from qualitative and
questionnaire studies on what it is like to live with heart
failure [45, 89–97]. Because heart failure produces pro-
found tiredness, shortness of breath, weight gain (from
fluid retention) and unpredictable life-threatening acute
crises, it typically has a life-changing impact on the indi-
vidual’s psychological well-being, independence and abil-
ity to undertake activities of daily living. The economic
and social burden of heart failure is high because of re-
duced ability to work and high demands on the time and
commitment of partners and carers [92, 93, 98].
The initial diagnosis of heart failure engenders a sense
of disruption and hopelessness from which patients re-
cover variably [91, 94, 95, 98, 99]. In general, patients’
knowledge about heart failure is poor; many find the
condition bewildering and explanations from profes-
sionals confusing or unforthcoming [91].
Chronic heart failure has three main impacts on daily
life, which appear to be common across different ethnic
and social groups. First, there is social isolation – arising
from lack of energy to join in social events, the unpre-
dictability of tiredness and physical weakness, and a feel-
ing of abandonment by family and/or friends. Second,
there is living with fear, including the fear of dying whilst
asleep (common in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspneoa). Third, there is loss of control, linked to un-
predictable fluctuations in health, blood pressure, ease of
breathing, sleep and the tyranny of complex medication
regimens – and in the longer term to loss of independ-
ence, financial insecurity and loss of participation in
decision-making [92, 98]. Social isolation may be wors-
ened by medication regimens (e.g. diuretics producing
urgency and frequency of urination).
There is limited evidence from small studies that
women with heart failure may feel insecure and experi-
ence guilt and anxiety from “being a burden” [100] – but
also that they may be more likely to come to terms with
their heart failure than men, who may hold an unrealis-
tic belief that the condition will improve or stop deteri-
orating [45, 93].
Some people cope by denying their heart failure
and/or deliberately avoid learning about it [45, 92, 94].
One review classified patients on a continuum from
“strategic
avoiders”
through
“selective
deniers”
and
“well-intentioned
self-managers”
to
“advanced
self-
managers” [94]. Under-reporting of acute symptoms to

 health professionals is common [101]. Whilst patients
often wish to obtain specialist help in an acute exacer-
bation, some may be unaware whom to contact, un-
able to navigate the system or unwilling to bother the
doctor or nurse; in addition, fear of hospitals may
deter people from seeking help [91].
Whilst hopelessness is common, adjustment to the
diagnosis of heart failure occurs when and to the ex-
tent that patients are able to make sense of their ill-
ness experience, accept its (often poor) prognosis and
enact practical strategies for living with the condition
[45, 95, 99]. Coping strategies for living with heart
failure include sharing experiences with others in a
way that is socially and culturally congruent; gaining
practical
and
emotional
support
from
family
and
peers; and learning to adapt one’s expectations and
lifestyle to changing circumstances (e.g. taking things
more slowly, changing hobbies) [92, 95, 98].
The main influences on people’s ability to cope and
care for themselves appear to be awareness and know-
ledge (including system knowledge about how to access
and navigate services); absence of co-morbidity (espe-
cially depression); quality and continuity of professional
care (including the clinician-patient relationship) [99];
quality of personal relationships (especially the extent to
which partners are able to understand the condition, en-
gage with its day-to-day management and ameliorate the
person’s sense of being a burden); and quality of social
support [92, 95, 97, 99].
Social support from family and lay networks can be
thought of as having four interacting elements: emo-
tional support, instrumental or practical help, provision
of information and support with appraisal (that is, with
evaluating one’s situation and the effect of one’s actions
or inactions) [97].
The clinical course of heart failure makes conversa-
tions about end of life care important. Most heart failure
patients would prefer such discussions to be physician-
initiated and to commence early – certainly well before
severe deterioration or clinical crises [102]. Because sud-
den death can occur at any time, some clinicians believe
this risk should be discussed proactively [103]. Uncer-
tainty of prognosis is often inherent, though palliative
care scholars argue that such uncertainty should be em-
braced and woven into an evolving discussion in the
context of a long-term therapeutic relationship [104].
Self-management in heart failure
Self-management education programmes, whose aim is
“to enable patients to assume a primary role in man-
aging their condition: monitor symptoms, adjust medica-
tions and determine when additional medical attention
is necessary”, have been shown to reduce hospital admis-
sions and increase compliance with medication in heart
failure [44] and (in more recent studies) to extend over-
all survival and improve quality of life [24]. Self-
management in such programmes is taken to mean
complying
with
prescribed
medication;
monitoring
symptoms, blood pressure and weight; adhering to a
low-sodium and fluid-restricted diet; stopping smoking;
taking regular exercise and seeking timely advice from
health professionals [24, 44].
However, not everyone with heart failure is able or
willing to engage in these activities [91]. The physical
manifestations
of
heart
failure,
which
are
typically
“vague, episodic and debilitating” [45], have a significant
effect on people’s ability to self-manage [105]. Balancing
the demands of the illness and its treatment with the de-
sire to live a normal life is a constant struggle, some-
times made worse by fragmented services and time-
consuming hospital visits [106]. Depression, anxiety and
cognitive
impairment
(including
acute
confusional
states) are all much commoner in people with heart fail-
ure than in an age-matched population, and these condi-
tions are associated with lower compliance with self-
management programmes [18].
A recent meta-analysis of individual patient data from
trials of self-management in heart failure included some
telling subgroup analyses: self-management reduced hos-
pital admission only in patients younger than 65 years
(an important finding, since the mean age of people with
heart failure is 75 [53]); in patients with moderate or se-
vere depression it was associated with significantly re-
duced survival [24].
A realist review of heart failure self-management pro-
grammes, which addressed the question “what works for
whom under what circumstances?” using mainly qualita-
tive methods, identified six key mechanisms that have
consistently been associated with programme success (in
terms of improving self-management activities): mobilis-
ing high-quality, personalised support from health pro-
fessionals;
improving
patient
well-being;
improving
patient and carer understanding of heart failure; extend-
ing the network of people (lay and/or professional) in-
volved in self-management and supporting people to use
technologies [46].
Another realist review focused on the role of telehealth
interventions in supporting self-management in chronic
illness (including but not limited to heart failure) [47].
The authors identified three underlying mechanisms by
which telehealth could support self-management: sup-
porting relationships (with professionals and/or peers);
successful integration of the technology into the patient’s
everyday life; and making symptoms and biomarkers
visible (thereby improving the patient’s knowledge,
motivation and self-efficacy; mobilising support from
the
patient’s
wider
network;
and
reinforcing
self-
management behaviours). Another theoretical paper
Greenhalgh et al. BMC Cardiovascular Disorders  (2017) 17:156 
Page 6 of 16
 reviewed the various psychological theories (e.g. cognitive-
behaviour theory, adult learning theory) on which the as-
sumptions of telehealth-supported self-management are
based [96].
Telehealth technologies and services for heart failure
Telehealth means remote communication or monitoring
between a patient and a clinical service using technolo-
gies. It is a heterogeneous term and implies technology
(ies) plus a service in which they are embedded [7]. Re-
mote
communication
supports
conversations
(either
open-ended or structured, via telephone or video), and
potentially offers scope for developing and maintaining
therapeutic relationships. Remote monitoring relies on
the principle that systematic monitoring of predefined
variables will enable early detection of clinical deterior-
ation and timely intervention. Four types of data may be
monitored:
� Symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, fatigue);
� Behaviour or events (e.g. compliance with medication
and fluid restriction, physical activity, falls);
� Biological data captured non-invasively via external
devices (e.g. body weight, body impedance, blood
pressure, heart rate, ECG, blood oxygen, blood
glucose, natriuretic peptides);
� Biological data captured invasively via implantable
devices (e.g. intracardiac or pulmonary artery
pressure, dysrhythmias).
Technologies for collecting the above data are many
and varied. They include sensing devices (typically blood
pressure monitors, weighing scales, pulse oximeters),
simple telephones (with human-human interaction); tele-
phone-based
voice-response
systems
(human-machine
interaction); video consultation (with or without transmis-
sion of vital signs); interactive portals on laptops or
smartphones; wearable sensors and implantable sensors
[21, 38, 64]. All imply the presence, at some stage in
the pathway, of humans on the receiving end of sig-
nals
and
a
service
infrastructure
in
which
those
humans can respond to a problem and/or refer it on.
Links with the electronic patient record may be auto-
mated or require manual data entry.
Anker et al. have suggested a broad taxonomy of tele-
monitoring devices based on two things: whether data
are sent synchronously or asynchronously and whether
professional clinical input occurs immediately or only
during office hours [64]. They point out that remote
monitoring raises medicolegal questions (if data are col-
lected but not immediately analysed, what degree of
delay is acceptable?); who takes responsibility for failures
in transmission of data?; to what extent is a ‘exception’
approach – in which clinicians are only alerted if
variables go outside pre-set parameters – appropriate
and defensible?; and financial concerns (who pays for
which aspects of the service, and how?), to which an-
swers are currently unclear [64].
Some telehealth interventions feed back directly to the
patient with educational messages (e.g. prompts to exer-
cise) and/or decision support for self-management (e.g.
suggesting a change in drug dosage). Such interventions
are depicted as potentially more efficient (since drug
dosage can be changed promptly by an “activated” pa-
tient or carer) and more cost-effective (since clinician in-
put is reduced), but they also place high demands on the
patient or carer [7].
Conventional telehealth using non-invasive monitoring
technologies is being supplemented or superseded by
the use of implantable devices, which raise additional
clinical, technical, operational and ethical challenges
[4, 5, 11, 21, 23, 36, 38, 65, 68]. In some cases, a de-
vice is specifically implanted to measure a particular
biomarker (e.g. pulmonary artery pressure); in others,
the device is implanted for other reasons (e.g. an im-
plantable
defibrillator),
allowing
biomarkers
to
be
measured in parallel. Notwithstanding the future po-
tential of such devices in some circumstances, hos-
pital admission in people with heart failure is often
triggered by co-morbidities and psychosocial factors;
telehealth devices and services that fail to address
these influences will have limited impact [64].
The sociological literature on telehealth emphasises
that the devices (like all technologies) are not neutral.
Rather, both standards (what gets measured and how
frequently) and values (assumptions about what is good –
for example, that heart failure patients should take respon-
sibility for self-management) are built into them. Whilst
some technologies can be reprogrammed and/or used
flexibly at the discretion of the clinician, non-use of tele-
health devices can sometimes be explained in terms of
mismatches between the inbuilt values and standards of
devices and those actually held by patients and staff. The
testing of telehealth technologies in randomised trials (for
which strict protocols are usually required) may fail to
capture the judicious and flexible use of such technologies
in a real-world clinical setting.
Trials of telehealth in heart failure
Over the past 20 years, randomised trials of telehealth in
heart failure have appeared at a rate of several per year;
a new meta-analysis attempting to synthesise such trials
is published every few months [14–17, 19, 21–23, 25–
32, 34–39, 107, 108]. This vast, complex and statistically
daunting literature has been summarised and critiqued in
detail elsewhere [5–7, 21, 33, 38, 39, 55, 64, 65, 68, 70]. In
this section, we summarise key points from published re-
views and consider the question of why so many trials and
Greenhalgh et al. BMC Cardiovascular Disorders  (2017) 17:156 
Page 7 of 16
 secondary analyses have produced so few clear recom-
mendations for practice and policy.
The single most striking feature of experimental trials
of telehealth in heart failure is their heterogeneity. As
the above-referenced reviews have noted, different trials
included widely differing patient samples in terms of
demographic variables (especially age cut-offs), severity
and stability of disease (especially the cut-off value for
HFREF and whether patients with HFPEF are included),
exclusion criteria (especially co-morbidities), and recruit-
ment route (outpatient clinic, post-acute hospital admis-
sion, primary care); they collected different kinds of data
using different devices combined with different packages
of human support in different organisational settings;
they compared these interventions with different control
arms (especially, different definitions of ‘usual care’); and
they applied different primary and secondary outcome
measures (total or heart failure-specific hospital admis-
sion, all-cause or cardiac-specific mortality, and quality
of life).
Unsurprisingly in the circumstances, different trials
of telehealth in heart failure got different results.
Meta-analyses of such trials, claim critics, have tended
to take too little account of inter-study differences
and give too much weight to flawed primary studies
[6, 33, 38, 39, 64, 65]. Whilst there is much residual
confusion, five consistent messages emerge from the
experimental literature:
First, published trials of telehealth in heart failure ap-
pear to be positively skewed by publication bias [33]. In
one review,
60 studies
reported
positive
outcomes
(almost all of them only weakly positive) and only one a
(weakly) negative outcome [33] – a statistically implaus-
ible result. Despite the beneficial effects of telehealth re-
ported in several meta-analyses [16, 19, 22, 23, 25–28,
30, 35, 38, 107, 108], a number of large, recent rando-
mised controlled trials have demonstrated no statistically
significant impact from comparable telehealth interven-
tions and patient groups [9, 10, 12, 13] (though one re-
cently published large trial showed positive benefit [11]).
A Cochrane review of “interactive” telehealth (involving
direct contact between a patient and a clinician) pub-
lished in 2015, in which methodologically weaker studies
were excluded using a risk of bias tool, showed no over-
all benefit over usual care on all-cause mortality or hos-
pitalisation in the heart failure sub-sample [17].
Second, recruitment of participants to trials of tele-
health for heart failure is usually poor and sometimes
abysmal. In one trial of telehealth that included but was
not limited to heart failure, 80% of approached patients
refused to participate; the most common reason was
preferring a home visit from a nurse [56] – a finding
that resonates with a more recent, larger trial in which
one reason for non-participation was fear that a highly-
valued existing service might be withdrawn [58]. In an-
other trial, 65% of patients were deemed ineligible (most
commonly because face to face home visits were consid-
ered clinically necessary) and of the rest, 75% declined
to participate [57]. In a review of heart failure telehealth
studies that reported recruitment data, on average, two-
thirds of eligible participants agreed to try telehealth and
of those, a fifth withdrew during trials (most commonly
because they were unable to use the device or did not
wish to) [32]. The lower the recruitment success in trials
of telehealth, the more questionable the external validity
of the findings.
Third, the impact of telehealth on reducing mortality,
preventing avoidable hospital admission and improving
quality of life appears to be highest in high-risk patients
recruited after acute admission for heart failure (around
one-sixth of the total heart failure population) [19, 21],
and attenuates with length of follow-up [19]. This makes
sense clinically, since stable heart failure is less likely to
require frequent adjustment of medication. It follows
that telehealth support is unlikely to improve outcome
in the majority of people with heart failure and that
careful case selection will be key to achieving clinical
and cost-effectiveness.
Fourth, the efficacy of remote telehealth monitoring
appears to improve with the number of variables
monitored, the frequency of monitoring and the time-
liness of human remote support [19, 22]. Inclusion of
symptom questions (e.g. subjective breathlessness) and
monitoring of pulse rate and rhythm both signifi-
cantly
enhanced
the
benefit
of
remote
telehealth
monitoring [19]. In one meta-regression analysis, the
single largest contributor to the success of telehealth
interventions
was
active
adjustment of
medication
within one day of a key change in vital signs [22].
Whilst
invasive
monitoring
of
intra-cardiac
bio-
markers
is
theoretically
more
accurate
than
non-
invasive monitoring, trials of these newer forms of
telehealth have produced inconsistent findings to date
(though several studies are ongoing) [7, 11, 23, 65].
Fifth, telehealth shows greater benefit when “usual
care” is sub-optimal [7, 109]. The TIM-HF trial, for ex-
ample, randomised 710 patients with exceptionally well
managed chronic stable heart failure to high-quality ex-
pert remote support or high-quality usual care and
found no significant differences in outcome between the
groups [10]. Some have suggested that telehealth might
come into its own when care provided to the control
arm falls below the gold standard used in TIM-HF [109].
A consistent finding is that when trials showed a bene-
fit of telehealth compared to usual care, participants in
the telehealth arm were found to be on higher doses of
disease-modifying agents than those in the control
arm [7].

 Cost
Pandor et al., who undertook one of the most compre-
hensive and rigorous systematic reviews on the remote
management of heart failure, also included a review of
economic evaluations [21]. Using studies published up
to early 2012, they produced a Markov model to assess
the cost-effectiveness of remote monitoring and struc-
tured telephone support, based on both randomised tri-
als and observational cohort studies. In this model, they
found remote monitoring during office hours to be cost-
effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]
£11,873 per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]). Struc-
tured telephone support with human contact was not
cost-effective (ICER £228,035 per QALY) and when
structured telephone support using a machine interface
was compared with usual care, the latter emerged as
dominant (i.e. more cost-effective). The authors consid-
ered that they had insufficient data to evaluate the cost-
effectiveness of 24/7 remote monitoring or monitoring
using implantable devices.
A number of systematic reviews of economic evalua-
tions of telehealth in heart failure have been published
since Pandor et al.’s review. One considered the primary
economic data to be too poor to support any firm con-
clusions [40]. Another considered the impact of patient
adherence on costs of telehealth and also failed to dem-
onstrate a consistent relationship between these vari-
ables [41]. A third found wide
variation in cost-
effectiveness across studies, with simpler technologies
(e.g. monitoring only one vital sign) proving more cost-
effective than complex ones – but also found that more
recent studies tended to show better cost-effectiveness
(because equipment is getting cheaper) [42]. Liu et al.
produced a new Markov model showing that telehealth
was most cost-effective (indeed, cost-saving) in the most
high-risk patients, though all estimates were highly
sensitive to the costs of hospital admission and length
of stay [43]. In short, cost estimates vary widely be-
cause of heterogeneity of samples and the numerous
interacting variables that play out differently in differ-
ent settings.
Implementation studies of telehealth
By implementation studies, we include preliminary work
to optimise technologies and service routines before
undertaking randomised trials; process evaluations of
the intervention arms of such trials; and real-world stud-
ies of the practicalities and challenges of introducing
and sustaining telehealth services. Many such studies are
largely atheoretical and written up as lists of “barriers”
and “facilitators” [32, 50, 58, 61, 62], though some depict
a complex system with multiple interacting influences
including people, technologies and both personal and
professional routines [7, 47, 89, 110, 111].
Table 2 lists the many factors to which poor uptake of
telehealth in heart failure has been attributed. Despite
frequent acknowledgement of these factors in the litera-
ture, empirical research into telehealth has tended to be
narrowly focused on describing and trialing particular
technologies in experimental designs without systematic-
ally studying the personal, professional, organisational,
financial and regulatory context affecting their accept-
ance and routinisation (a bias that has been exacerbated
rather than resolved by the increasing use of cloud com-
puting and big data) [5]. To our knowledge, no imple-
mentation study of telehealth
in heart failure has
described and tested a specific theory of change.
Some research teams have included a preliminary co-
design phase in which front-line clinicians and service
managers (and sometimes patients and carers as well)
work to design and/or refine the technology and shape the
service routines in which it will be used. Triantafyllides et
al., for example, describe such a process in relation to the
SUPPORT-HF randomised trial, which involved patients
entering structured symptom summaries and physio-
logical data onto a tablet and (in the intervention arm) re-
ceiving remote advice and education [112]. The co-design
phase with patients led to several upgrades (such as en-
hanced ‘helpdesk’ support, remote activation and de-
activation of features of the application, and regular data
synchronisation to address intermittent internet connec-
tion failure).
Wade et al. interviewed 36 clinicians involved in differ-
ent telehealth projects across Australia [111]. Whilst the
authors initially anticipated organisational and regulatory
issues to be important factors in accounting for low up-
take of telehealth (as indicated in Table 2), their data sup-
ported a single key factor – clinician acceptance – that
could make or break such a service, given adequate tech-
nology, resources and demand. In their analysis, accept-
ance depended on the belief that telehealth was effective,
safe and “normal” – and such beliefs were in turn strongly
influenced by local champions [111]. In this study, cham-
pions worked by enthusiastically promoting telehealth,
legitimating telehealth and building relationships [113].
Other
studies
have
also
identified
clinician
non-
acceptance as the most important single explanation for
low uptake of telehealth [51, 60, 101, 110]. A Dutch quali-
tative study found that some clinicians used their physical
senses (sight, touch, smell) and “gut feelings” in assessing
very ill patients, and were concerned that remote monitor-
ing (and even video consultations) would lead to loss of
this rich data [101].
Action research employing the principles of socio-
technical co-design allows iterative development of a
technology and the service to which it is linked, includ-
ing negotiating the underpinning values and standards
that will be built into the technology, as well as engaging
Greenhalgh et al. BMC Cardiovascular Disorders  (2017) 17:156 
Page 9 of 16
 staff (and, sometimes, patients) in shaping the pathways
and routines in the technology-supported service. Whilst
such an approach is theoretically appealing, the research
literature evaluating its use in heart failure services is
sparse.
We found only one relevant action research study,
from the UK, which included patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease as well as heart failure
[114]. An initial interview phase fed into a series of ac-
tion research cycles in four sites, all of whom identified
the first priority as establishing clear referral criteria and
clarifying the telehealth pathway (including how to deal
with patients who had become dependent on telecare
but are no longer deemed to need it clinically). Other

 priority actions addressed in the action research were
improving patient assessment and review, improving
monitoring and triage, improving data sharing and access,
raising awareness of telehealth, improving evaluation and
securing further funding. In this study, “early wins” and a
sense of partnership appeared critical to overcoming clin-
ician resistance and maintaining buy-in [60].
Discussion
Summary of findings
Heart failure is a chronic disease, mostly affecting the
elderly and managed in the community. It is charac-
terised by periodic acute exacerbations for which (poten-
tially avoidable) hospital admission is common and by
progressive deterioration. Modern management of heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) involves
complex drug regimens, including up-titration of mul-
tiple medications to achieve the maximum tolerated
dose, and/or technologically advanced devices, as well as
active involvement of patient and carers. Heart failure
with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) is increasingly
common, less amenable to up-titration of medication
and less widely researched. Modifiable risk factors and
co-morbidities (hypertension, coronary heart disease,
valvular heart disease, diabetes, obesity, smoking, history
of
myocardial
infarction,
cardiotoxic
chemotherapy)
present both opportunities and challenges for telehealth
interventions.
Heart failure is experienced by the patient as a serious,
debilitating and unpredictable condition that engenders
bewilderment, fear and hopelessness. It interferes in a
major way with activities of daily living, imposes a high
treatment burden and carries a real risk of death. The
qualitative literature underscores the importance of fam-
ily and social networks in supporting individuals to live
with heart failure. Self-management appears to improve
functional status, quality of life and survival in trial pop-
ulations but there is now strong evidence that the oldest
and sickest patients appear not to benefit from it, have
limited capacity to undertake it and may even be harmed
by it.
Telehealth is an umbrella term that embraces multiple
technologies, used variably by different services, to com-
municate with and monitor heart failure patients. These
technologies are developing rapidly and becoming more
invasive. They are part of wider networks of people and
technologies; they generate data that must be processed,
interpreted and acted upon by humans – and, in current it-
erations, they address comorbidities only to a very limited
degree. They embody standards and values which may not
be immediately evident but which could potentially conflict
with those held by patients and professionals.
Several high-quality randomised trials have demon-
strated the superiority of telehealth over usual care in
patients with severe and unstable heart failure – though
even in this select sub-group, telehealth’s edge is evident
only when intensively delivered and when “usual care” is
suboptimal. The literature is muddied by poor-quality,
underpowered trials with weakly positive results, synthe-
sised (sometimes) in misleading meta-analyses that over-
look publication bias and lump different denominator
populations, devices and service models together in-
appropriately. Low recruitment to telehealth trials raises
questions about the external validity of results. Implant-
able monitors are a rapidly developing technology on
which the evidence base is still accumulating.
The somewhat sparse economic literature resonates
with findings from high-quality clinical trials: that tele-
health interventions are most cost-effective where they
are most effective – in unstable patients who are at high
risk of hospital admission. They also raise the intriguing
question of whether simpler monitoring schedules, even
though less clinically effective, may be more cost-
effective.
The literature on implementation of telehealth in heart
failure can be summarised in a long and perhaps unsur-
prising list of barriers to (and conversely, facilitators of)
success, of which clinician resistance appears to be par-
ticularly significant (Table 2). Co-design with front-line
users can help optimise technologies and service rou-
tines prior to randomised trials. Action research with a
strong co-design component appears to offer promise
for real-world implementation but there are, as yet, few
such studies in the literature.
Synthesis
We have surfaced a number of tensions in the literature,
which we believe are the key to explaining variation in
uptake and sustainability of telehealth services.
There is a tension between heart failure as an isolated
textbook condition, amenable to standardised manage-
ment by evidence-based guidelines, and the much com-
moner phenomenon of heart failure coexisting with
multiple co-morbidities that impact on the patient ex-
perience and key outcome measures (hospitalisation,
mortality). The bioengineers’ vision that continuous bio-
medical data will allow pre-empting of deterioration
(and hence, hospital admissions) and systematic im-
provements in prognosis may materialise for some pa-
tients but for others it will remain unrealised as risk
factors and comorbidities increase noise in the system.
Another tension is between an intensive telehealth
monitoring
service
that
collects
data
on
multiple
symptoms and biomarkers (more clinically effective)
and a more basic service that focuses on one or two
easily-measurable
parameters
(more
cost-effective).
The decision to provide enhanced versus basic tele-
health support could potentially be made clinically on
Greenhalgh et al. BMC Cardiovascular Disorders  (2017) 17:156 
Page 11 of 16
 a case by case basis, thereby optimising the trade-off
between clinical and cost-effectiveness of the service,
though we did not identify any published research
that had tested such a hypothesis.
There is also a tension between the activated, empow-
ered, self-managing patient assumed in many hypothet-
ical
models
of
telehealth
and
the
tired,
hopeless,
frightened and bewildered individual identified in quali-
tative studies of the patient experience. Also of note is
the chronically anxious or depressed, and/or acutely
confused, patient who features strongly in the denomin-
ator population of many heart failure studies. Policy-
makers who view telehealth-prompted self-management
uncritically as the technological solution to the rising
prevalence of heart failure in an ageing population
should note the evidence reviewed above that this is at
best a partial solution for younger and fitter sub-
populations.
A fourth tension is between heart failure management
as a “cold” biomedical practice “dominated by technical,
objectifying and causal reasoning about the body and its
diseases” (page 25 [101]), focused on data exchange and
oriented to improving efficiency and quantitative out-
come measures (mortality, length of stay and so on) –
and as a “warm”, relationship-based, adaptive practice
that engages with the patient’s unique predicament, ac-
knowledges his or her vulnerability and emotions, and
seeks to provide continuity of personal care. The two ap-
proaches are not, of course, mutually exclusive, and a
successful heart failure service may conceivably combine
both, adapting the care package judiciously to each pa-
tient’s needs and preferences. The tension between
“cold” and “warm” telehealth highlights that seemingly
technical and economic choices (about which devices to
purchase for a heart failure service) mask value-based
choices about what kind of care patients deserve.
Finally, there is the tension between fixed and agile pro-
grammes. The preferred research approach of the rando-
mised controlled trial, in which both the technology and
the activities it supports are more or less fixed (though, as
noted above, a trial may be preceded by an iterative devel-
opmental phase), means there has been limited opportun-
ity to study the process by which technical and clinical
staff, as well as patients and carers, “tinker” with the tech-
nology to produce a customised package that is fit for pur-
pose for a unique set of circumstances, and to modify that
package as the patient’s condition fluctuates.
Comparison with existing literature
Ours is not the first literature review of telehealth in
heart failure that sought to make sense of a complex
field and explore its many interactions and nuances.
Conway et al., Dierckx et al. and Gurné et al. before us
(and to some extent, other authors too) have resisted the
temptation to combine findings from heterogeneous tri-
als of telehealth into a dubious single ‘effect size’ and in-
stead engaged critically with shifting definitions of the
condition and multiple sources of heterogeneity (patho-
physiology, co-morbidity, case mix, devices, services,
outcome measures) and with the diverse policy contexts
in which decisions about telehealth are made locally and
nationally [6, 7, 36].
We believe we have added to their work by using a
formal, hermeneutic methodology and incorporating a
wide range of literature beyond randomised trials. Draw-
ing on Wittgenstein, Boell and Cecez-Kecmanovic dis-
tinguish between puzzles or problems that require data
and those that require clarification and insight [67]. Tel-
ehealth in heart failure is a “paradigm case” not only
practically (it illustrates the multiple complex challenges
facing any telehealth programme) but also methodo-
logically (because of its complexity, the field will not be
illuminated – and may sometimes even be made murkier
– through data-focused review methods such as chart-
ing, categorising and meta-analysis).
The tensions listed above both illustrate and under-
score the ARCHIE standards developed previously by
our own team: telehealth and telecare services must be
Anchored in a detailed understanding of what matters to
the patient; Realistic about the natural history of their
condition; Co-creative so as to evolve and adapt solu-
tions with users; Human, supported through interper-
sonal
relationships
and
social
networks;
Integrated,
through attention to mutual awareness and knowledge
sharing; and Evaluated to drive system learning [115].
Unanswered questions
The extensive empirical literature and the somewhat
sparse theoretical literature summarised above leave a
number of research questions unanswered. Drawing
partly on a paper by Pols [101], we identify five that are
particularly relevant to the tensions that emerged from
our own hermeneutic review.
First, what is excellence in the clinical management of
heart failure? If technologies embody values, it is surely
necessary to surface and debate our professional values
about good care which – often implicitly rather than
explicitly – inform and drive the design of telehealth
technologies. How important is relationship-based care,
for example, for heart failure patients in general and,
more specifically, for particular patients or patient
groups? How should we manage the trade-off between
evidence-based
guidelines
(which
relate
to
sub-
populations and can be built into algorithms) and per-
sonalisation of care (which accommodates the unique
features of the individual and cannot)?
Second, what kinds of knowledge are needed to deliver
excellent care (and how do clinicians’ knowledge needs
Greenhalgh et al. BMC Cardiovascular Disorders  (2017) 17:156 
Page 12 of 16
 change with circumstances)? Different telehealth tech-
nologies bring different kinds of knowledge into play. A
device that transmits accurate physiological data (but
nothing else) informs a very different kind of clinical
decision-making from a technology that transmits a view
of the patient’s face and the family living room along
with the sound of stories, laughter and arguments be-
tween spouses (but few objective data). Because new
forms of telehealth surface new forms of knowledge,
they have profound implications for what care is and
how services must be organised to deliver it.
Third, what is the nature of “complexity” in heart fail-
ure and its management, and what are the implications
of this for the design of technology-supported services?
This paper has begun to tease out the different ways in
which the management of heart failure (especially but
not exclusively when done remotely) is clinically, logis-
tically and technically complex. Further research could
explore this complexity in more depth, perhaps starting
with the group most neglected in studies of heart failure
to date – the oldest, most frail patients with multiple co-
morbidities and additional vulnerabilities.
Fourth, in the light of the finding from a large, well-
conducted qualitative study that almost all patients in
heart failure clinics need considerable customisation of
care [87], what is the nature of this “tinkering” and what
are the implications for those who (with the best of in-
tentions) seek to make heart failure care more auto-
mated, more standardised, more guideline-driven and
more efficient? The use of telehealth does not preclude
tinkering, nor does it imply unquestioning adherence to
guidelines. But the judicious, patient-by-patient custom-
isation of the telehealth package to support compassion-
ate, individualised evidence-based care appears to have
received little research attention to date. If such tinker-
ing were not merely permitted but encouraged and
resourced, would this overcome resistance of some
front-line staff to telehealth in heart failure?
Fifth, for what aspects of care has the potential of tele-
health not yet been (fully) explored? For example, what
kinds of comorbidities might be managed remotely, and
how? How and in what circumstances might a primary
focus on comorbidities improve the heart failure that is
secondary to them? Could remote consultations be used
to help provide education, review compliance and ra-
tionalise medication in selected heart failure patients?
Could some aspects of advance care planning be done
through this medium?
Finally, how could we use co-design and action research
methodologies more effectively in the development and im-
plementation of telehealth services? There is much evidence
that introducing technologies in an organisation is a social
process that depends on values, mindsets and engagement
[116]. It is also an evolutionary process (sociotechnical
systems are grown, not built), hence best achieved by early
and active input of front-line workers into the [re] design of
work routines. Similarly, if we expect patients to accept and
engage with telehealth services, we should involve them in
the design of these services. It is time to extend the limited
evidence base on how this might best be undertaken.
Conclusion
This hermeneutic review has highlighted the clinical com-
plexity of heart failure and its management; its profound
physical and psycho-social impacts and the significant
treatment burden placed on the patient and family; the
benefits and (in older and sicker patients) potential draw-
backs of self-management; the wide range of rapidly-
evolving technologies and services that come under the
umbrella of telehealth; the vast number of experimental
trials of telehealth whose findings are ambiguous, inter-
pretations contested and costs highly variable; the many
challenges of implementing telehealth in real-world set-
tings; and the widespread (but by no means universal) re-
sistance to telehealth among patients and clinicians.
We have synthesised our findings into a number of key
tensions – between tidy, ‘textbook’ heart failure (seen
more often in secondary care) and its messier, comorbid
reality (which predominates in primary care); between
basic and intensive telehealth; between patients who are
activated, empowered and linked to an extensive network
of lay carers and those who are bewildered, downtrodden
and socially isolated; between “cold” and “warm” telecare;
and between fixed and agile programmes of care.
We believe that, despite a number of ongoing, well-
designed randomised trials of new technologies and care
models, the research landscape in this field has become
somewhat stagnant. Our suggestions for new topics of
research deliberately seek to address different questions
using different methodologies. For primary research, we
encourage greater use of theory-informed qualitative
methods, especially when considering the implementa-
tion of telehealth in organisations, and of co-design
methods, action research and agile development of tech-
nologies and programmes. For secondary research, we
believe hermeneutic review should be used much more
widely to illuminate and clarify complex topic areas.
