Abstract
The recent spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with increased rates of Guillain
Barre and other neurological disorders as well as congenital defects that include micro-
cephaly has created an urgent need to develop animal models to examine the pathogene-
sis of the disease and explore the efficacy of potential therapeutics and vaccines. Recently
developed infection models for ZIKV utilize mice defective in interferon responses. In this
study we establish and characterize a new model of peripheral ZIKV infection using immu-
nocompetent neonatal C57BL/6 mice and compare its clinical progression, virus distribu-
tion, immune response, and neuropathology with that of C57BL/6-IFNAR KO mice. We
show that while ZIKV infected IFNAR KO mice develop bilateral hind limb paralysis and die
5–6 days post-infection (dpi), immunocompetent B6 WT mice develop signs of neurological
disease including unsteady gait, kinetic tremors, severe ataxia and seizures by 13 dpi that
subside gradually over 2 weeks. Immunohistochemistry show viral antigen predominantly
in cerebellum at the peak of the disease in both models. However, whereas IFNAR KO
mice showed infiltration by neutrophils and macrophages and higher expression of IL-1,
IL-6 and Cox2, B6 WT mice show a cellular infiltration in the CNS composed predominantly
of T cells, particularly CD8+ T cells, and increased mRNA expression levels of IFNg, GzmB
and Prf1 at peak of disease. Lastly, the CNS of B6 WT mice shows evidence of neurode-
generation predominantly in the cerebellum that are less prominent in mice lacking the IFN
response possibly due to the difference in cellular infiltrates and rapid progression of the
disease in that model. The development of the B6 WT model of ZIKV infection will provide
insight into the immunopathology of the virus and facilitate assessments of possible thera-
peutics and vaccines.

 Author Summary
The recent spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with increased rates of neuro-
logical disorders and congenital defects created an urgent need for animal models to exam-
ine the pathogenesis of the disease and explore the efficacyof potential therapeutics and
vaccines. We describe the first symptomatic PRVABC59(ZIKV) animal model in immu-
nocompetent B6 WT mice showing that a subcutaneous challenge in 1 day old mice leads
to non-lethal neurological disease that is characterized by unsteady gait, kinetic tremors,
severe ataxia and seizures that subsides after 2 weeks. ZIKV infects neurons in cerebellum
of mice and elicits the infiltration of lymphocytes into the brain. The immune response
protects mice from death but may also contribute to neurodegeneration as mice with
defective interferon responses have increased virus loads in brain and peripheral organs,
succumbing to the disease in 5–6 days, but have fewer signs of neurodegeneration.This
mouse model bypasses transplacental transmission and consequent placental insufficiency
and will facilitate detailed investigations into the pathogenesis of the disease as well as
mechanistic studies for possible therapeutics and vaccines. Lastly, its non-lethal outcome
allows for studies assessing the long term effects of the infection, and exploring conditions
that could lead to disease reactivation.
Introduction
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen that belongs to the Flavivirus
genus of the Flaviviridae family, which includes globally relevant arthropod-transmitted
human pathogens such as dengue (DENV), yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), Japanese
encephalitis (JEV), and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. The first strain of ZIKV (MR 766)
was isolated in 1947 from a febrile sentinel rhesus monkey in the Zika forest near Entebbe,
Uganda after the virus underwent intracerebral passage in Swiss albino mice[1]. For the next
50 years infections with ZIKV were reported sporadically in different regions of Africa and
Asia, but were associated with mild symptoms consisting of skin rashes, conjunctivitis, fever
and headaches[2]. In 2007 ZIKV started spreading west, first with an outbreak in Island of
Yap where it infected over 70% of the population, followed in 2013 by an outbreak in French
Polynesia[3]. This last outbreak was associated with a sharp increase in cases of Guillain
Barre Syndrome (GBS), an autoimmune disease characterized by weakening and even paral-
ysis of the limbs and face [4,5]. In 2015 Zika spread to South and Central America, infecting
thousands of people in Brazil and Colombia, where it associated with an increase in GBS
rates as well as a significant increase in severe fetal abnormalities that include spontaneous
abortion, stillbirth, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, and placental insufficiency[6–9].The tem-
poral association of the viral outbreak and increased incidence of GBS and birth defects did
not necessarily imply causality, however recent studies showing infection of the CNS in
utero as well as infections of human neural progenitor and neural stem cells leading to cell
cycle arrest and death [10,11] lend credence to the causality of ZIKV in microcephaly
[12,13].
While a majority of ZIKV infections in adults are asymptomatic or result in skin rashes,
conjunctivitis (nonpurulent), muscle pain and joint pain (small joints of hands and feet), or a
headache lasting for 2–7 days, the recent spread of ZIKV and its association with increased
rates of neurological disorders has created an urgent need for animal models to examine the
pathogenesis of the disease and explore the efficacyof potential therapeutics and vaccines. In
recent weeks, studies showed that young or adult immunocompetent mice are not susceptible

 to infection, but prepubescent mice lacking the capacity to produce or respond to interferons
(IFNs), including A129 (type I IFNAR KO), Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF)3/5/7 triple KO,
and AG129 (type 1 and type 2 IFN KO), develop neurological disease and succumb to infection
with high viral loads in the brain, spinal cord, and testes [14,15]. Interestingly, in seeking a
model that was less dramatically challenged Lazear et al infected mice deficient in IRF3, IRF5,
or Mitochondrial Anti-Viral Signaling (MAVS), which mediate the signaling of pattern recog-
nition receptors for ssRNA RIG-I and MDA5, however none of these mouse models developed
disease [14]. While these IFN deficient models provide useful data, the profound immunologi-
cal defects in these strains may skew our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease
as the impaired IFN response can, for example, modify the susceptibility to infection of specific
tissues. Moreover, previous studies on the pathology of flavivirus suggest that pathogenicity
may be determined not just by the effect of the virus but by the immune response it elicits [16].
Thus an immunocompetent mouse model is urgently needed to understand the host response
and pathogenesis of the disease and to test and compare the potency of potential therapeutic
approaches.
More recently several studies have shown that mice from immunocompetent strains can be
infected in utero provided a high titer infection is achieved in the dam or antibodies neutraliz-
ing interferon are administered [17–20]. These infections, when performed early in pregnancy
(E5-E8), result in increased fetal resorption and altered brain and eye development. The rela-
tive contribution of virus-inducedplacental insufficiencyversus direct deleterious effect of the
virus on the cells of the fetal CNS is unclear [20,21].
In mice, the stage of CNS development of neonatal pups has been equated to a human
mid-term fetus [22]. Neonatal rodents have shown to be highly susceptible to many neuro-
tropic viral infections, including Herpes, Bornavirus, Tacaribe arenavirus and more recently
Chikungunya, that present with meningoencephalitis [23–26]. In this study we establish a
new model of subcutaneous (SC) ZIKV infection in neonatal (1 day old), immunocompetent
C57BL/6 (B6 WT) mice and compare its clinical progression, virus distribution, immune
response, and neuropathology with C57BL/6-IFNAR-/- (IFNAR KO) mice, which are defi-
cient in type 1 IFN responses. We show that immunocompetent mice, when infected at day 1
of age (P1) develop unsteady gait, loss of balance, kinetic tremors, severe ataxia and seizures
beginning around 13 days post infection (dpi) that subside 2 weeks later. Infection-induced
IFN responses appear to reduce but not completely abrogate CNS infection in B6 WT mice.
Further, whereas the response to the virus in the CNS of B6 WT mice is characterized by cel-
lular infiltration consisting predominantly of CD8+ T cells and is associated with increased
expression levels of T cell effector molecules such as IFNg, granzyme B and perforin, the CNS
in IFNAR KO mice show infiltration predominantly by neutrophils and macrophages as well
as higher levels of inflammatory cytokines. Lastly the CNS of B6 WT mice shows evidence of
neurodegeneration that is less prominent in IFNAR KO mice. This model does not address
transplacental transmission of virus from mother to fetus or adult transmission, however it
offers an immunocompetent symptomatic mouse model for ZIKV infections that may prove
useful to understand the long term effects of ZIKV infection. In addition, it avoids transpla-
cental infection and consequent placental insufficiencyas a confounding factor in the devel-
opment of the brain. Lastly, this model may help understand the clinical consequences for
infections in late pregnancy or early childhood. While ZIKV infections in early pregnancy
have catastrophic consequences, there is concern that infections at later stages of gestation or
early childhood may result in long term neurodevelopmental issues that we are as yet
unaware of.

 Results
Susceptibility of Immunocompetent and Immunodeficient Mice to ZIKV
Recent studies showed that mice defective in interferon responses are susceptible to infection
and develop a lethal disease. To explore whether IFNAR KO mice are susceptible to infection
with the contemporary ZIKV PRVABC59 strain,10 day old (P10) IFNAR KO mice were chal-
lenged subcutaneously (sc) with 2 x 103 PFU of ZIKV. The mice remained asymptomatic and
maintained their weight gain for the first 4 dpi (Fig 1B). Beginninglate on 4 dpi the mice dem-
onstrated reduced movement, tremors, bilateral hind limb paralysis, and died within 24 hours
of disease onset (Fig 1). These results were consistent with those reported for 3 week old: A129,
IRF-3/5/7 -/- and AG129 (IFNa/b/g KO) mice challenged with the African MR766 or MP1751
strains, or the more recent H/PF/2013 strain [27–29].
We next examined whether the ZIKV PRVABC59 strain could be used to challenge B6
WT mice. Reports on susceptibility to infection in utero[30,31], ZIKV’s ability to infect devel-
oping neurons in vitro [10,17] and prior studies in TCRV[25,32], Sindbis (manuscript in
preparation), and Chikungunya [26] suggested that a challenge with ZIKV very early in life,
when the central nervous and immune systems are not fully mature may yield a productive
infection. Thus we explored whether B6 WT mice were susceptible to ZIKV if challenged one
day after birth (P1). As shown in Fig 1, WT mice infected on P1 with PRVABC59 (2x103 PFU
(sc)) remain asymptomatic for 12 days, except for a decreased rate of weight gain. After 2
weeks the mice develop unsteady gait with widening stance, hyperactivity and ataxia. This is
followed by reduced mobility, intermittent alternating collapse of the hind limbs, loss of

 balance and seizures (S1–S3 Movies). Interestingly, unlike IFNAR KO mice, these mice do
not develop flaccid hind limb paralysis or succumb to the infection (Fig 1 and S4 Movie).
Indeed, the observedsymptoms diminish over the course of 2 weeks and most mice survive
the challenge and recover. Additional studies will be needed to assess the long term conse-
quences of infection.
To determine whether the difference in clinical presentation was due to the age of the mice
at the time of challenge, IFNAR KO mice were challenged at P1 and P3. The clinical presenta-
tion in mice challenged on P1 or P3 was similar to that of mice challenged on P10 as they devel-
oped bilateral paralysis and succumbed to disease by 5 dpi (S1 Fig). Conversely, B6 wt mice
challenged on P3 or P10 do not develop signs of disease. This indicated that the virus was
inducing fundamentally different pathology in immunocompromised and immunocompetent
mice. Given that the clinical development of the disease was similar for mice challenged on P1,
P3 or P10, all the ensuing experiments used P10 infections for the IFNAR KO model so that
the peak of disease coincides in age with that of the B6 model (P15).
Tissue distribution of ZIKV in Mice
Previous reports show that in mice defective in IFN responses (A129, AG129, IRF-3/5/7 triple
KO) the virus distributes systemically, with detectable ZIKV present in the brain and spinal
cord, testes, spleen, liver, kidney and serum [28]. Our challenge model with PRVABC59 in
IFNAR KO mice confirms these results showing high virus titers in the CNS (4.4 x 107
TCID50), as well as spleen (9 x 105 TCID50/0.5 g of tissue), and liver (1.5 x 105 TCID50/0.5 g of
tissue) at 5 dpi (Fig 2A). In comparison, WT mice challenged at P1 show relatively lower viral
loads in the CNS (9x104 TCID50/0.5 g of tissue) at 15 dpi, the time when the animals displayed
peak neurological deficit. Moreover, the B6 WT mice do not show evidence of viral infection in
spleen or liver, indicating selective infection of the CNS. Similarly, quantitative real-time PCR
showed detectable levels of viral RNA in the CNS of B6 WT mice starting at day 3 and increas-
ing through day 9 of infection (Fig 2B and 2C). Of note the levels of viral RNA in CNS did not
reach those evident in IFNAR KO mice at peak of disease (105 ZIKV RNA copies/mL vs 108
ZIKV copies/mL) (Fig 2A and 2B). No RNA was detectable in liver or spleen of B6 mice (Fig
2B). The presence of more than 105 ZIKV RNA copies /mL in liver and spleen of IFNAR KO
mice suggests that type I IFNs play a key role in controlling the virus in the peripheral organs
and peripheral infection may play a role in lethality in these models. In contrast, infection in
B6 WT appears to be restricted to the CNS possibly due to lower levels of IFNs in response to
the virus in CNS as previously shown [33,34].
Given that both strains were positive for ZIKV in the CNS but displayed different clinical
presentation, we next explored whether the distribution of the virus in the CNS was similar in
B6 WT and IFNAR KO mice. Immunohistochemistry of the CNS using a mouse monoclonal
antibody (clone D1-4G2-4-15) that has been shown to react with ZIKV and other members of
the flavivirus family, demonstrated detectable viral antigen in the CNS of both B6 WT (15 dpi)
and IFNAR KO (5 dpi) mice (Fig 2D). As expected,age-matched, uninfected control sections
were negative for the virus stain (Fig 2D). Consistent with the higher virus titers, IFNAR KO
mice showed stronger and broader staining of the virus by immunohistochemistrythat
extended to the cortex. In contrast, the CNS of B6WT mice showed virus predominantly in the
cerebellar white matter and granular layers as well as in the hippocampus region (S2 Fig), but
not in the frontal cortex. Colocalization of stains for ZIKV and neurofilament heavy chain in
the areas of cerebellum (Fig 2E) and hippocampus (S2 Fig) indicates that ZIKV infects
neurons.

 Characterization of the response to ZIKV infection in the CNS of WT and
IFNAR KO mice
We next determined whether the immune response to the virus in the CNS was similar
between IFNAR KO and B6 WT mice. Both strains showed profound up-regulation of the
expression of genes linked to inflammation and cellular infiltration. These included a signifi-
cant up-regulation of Ccl2, Ccl5, Cxcl10 and Cxcl11 with the corresponding increases in genes

 linked to the recruitment and activation of neutrophils (PMN) and monocyte/macrophages
including increases in MHC, Cd80, Cd86, Cd68 and Cd40 as well as marked increases in Csf1
and Csf2 (Fig 3). These were accompanied by significant increases in the expression of IFNb,
Tnfa, Il6, Il1, Ifng, C3 and Cox2, all indicating a severe inflammatory response in the CNS. In
all, 49 of the 96 genes screened showed at least a 5 fold increase in expression in both strains.
Interestingly, the magnitude of the up-regulation for several of these genes was markedly dif-
ferent between the models. For example, IFNAR KO mice showed significantly higher levels of
Csf2, Csf3, Sele and Selp, while B6 WT mice showed relatively higher levels of genes linked to
antigen presentation such as H2-Eb1 and B2m. B6 WT mice also showed significantly higher
levels of Cd45, Ccr7 and Cxcr3, suggesting increased infiltration of peripheral leukocytes,while
IFNAR KO mice showed higher levels of Ccr4 likely expressed on microglia and astrocytes (Fig
3). Among the genes linked to inflammation, the expression of Ifna, Ifnb, Cox2, Il1, and Il6
were significantly higher in the IFNAR KO mice potentially due to higher virus titers in the
CNS and the deficient IFN response. In contrast, the CNS of B6 WT mice had relatively higher
expression of ISGs OAS1 and ISG15, as well as genes corresponding to T cells including CD3,
CD4 and CD8, and markers of Th1 and cytolytic responses such as GzmB and Prf1, Il2, Ifng,
and STAT1. These data would indicate that ZIKV enables a significant T cell response in the
CNS of B6 WT mice that is not evident in IFNAR KO mice.
Cellular infiltration in the CNS of ZIKV infected B6 and IFNAR KO mice
The data above suggested that the CNS infection in both strains was accompanied by micro-
glial/macrophage activation and immune cell infiltration. To explore this further, we isolated

 cells from the CNS of infected animals at 15 dpi and studied the cell populations using flow
cytometry. As predicted by the increased expression of genes related to T cells and antigen pre-
senting cells, there was significant cellular infiltration of CD45hi cells in the CNS of both strains.
In B6 WT mice the majority of infiltrating cells were T cells, with CD8+ T cells comprising 45%
and CD4+ T cells comprising 20% of the CD45hi infiltrating population. The remaining cell
types consisted of F4/80+CD11b+ macrophages (15%), NK1.1+ Natural Killer cells (3%) and
CD19+CD45R+ B cells (5%)(Fig 4A). IFNAR KO mice showed even higher levels of cellular
infiltration, however in these mice the infiltrating cells corresponded to CD11b+Ly6G+ and
CD11b+F4/80+ consistent with PMN and macrophages respectively, with only a minor popula-
tion of T cells and NK cells (Fig 4A). These data together with the analysis of gene expression
suggests that the inflammatory and immune processes that follow ZIKV are fundamentally dif-
ferent in IFNAR KO and B6 WT mice, with IFNAR KO mice showing significant inflammation
of the CNS accompanied by infiltration by PMN and granulocytes,while IFN-sufficientanimals
mount a T cell driven response characterized by CD8+ T cells and high levels of IFNγ and gran-
zyme B.
Previous studies had shown inflammatory and degenerative changes in the brains of IFN
deficient mice challenged with ZIKV. These include the presence of scattered nuclear frag-
ments, perivascularcuffing,and PMN infiltrating gray and white matter [27]. To determine
whether the B6 WT mice would show similar evidence of inflammatory and degenerative
changes, we stained sagittal brain sections collected from Zika-infectedB6 WT mice at 15 dpi
and age-matched control animals. Fluorescence immunohistochemistryconfirmed the pres-
ence of CD45+ immune cells in the parenchyma of the CNS in both B6 WT and IFNAR mice
and showed that these cells concentrate in the white matter and granular layers of the cerebel-
lum (Fig 4B), consistent with previous studies in IFN deficient mice [27].
ZIKV infection results in neurodegeneration in the CNS of B6 WT mice
The clinical presentation of ZIKV infected B6 WT mice, along with the previously described
tropism of ZIKV for neurons suggested that the virus infects and damages the CNS of B6 WT
mice. To test this, we stained sections adjacent to those used to detect virus and inflammation
with the Fluoro-Jade C, a stain that specificallylabels degenerating neurons. As expected,unin-
fected, age-matched controls showed no staining with the Fluoro-Jade C stain. In contrast,
infected B6 WT mice showed foci of Fluoro-Jade C positive neurons in all layers of the cerebel-
lum, but predominantly in the granular and PC layers (Fig 5). Interestingly, there were fewer
Fluoro-Jade C+ cells in granular and Purkinje layers of the cerebellum of IFNAR KO mice. The
presence of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and higher levels of fluorojade C positive cells in the CNS
of B6 WT mice suggests a possible role for CD8+ T cells in the pathology.
Discussion
ZIKV belongs to the Flavivirus genus that includes several etiological agents of viral encephali-
tis, the most significant being Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne
encephalitis virus. As with other flaviviruses,the majority of infected individuals will not
develop disease, but a minority will develop a severe illness with a significant chance of perma-
nent neurological damage, congenital malformations, or death. The factors that determine this
are likely numerous, involving complex interactions between virus and host that are yet to be
uncovered. Animal models can help us understand the pathophysiology of the virus, identify
therapeutic targets, and explore the safety and efficacyof new therapeutics and vaccines. This
study shows that neonatal B6 WT mice challenged with ZIKV develop a slow onset non-lethal
encephalitis that is characterized by unsteady gait, kinetic tremors, severe ataxia, loss of balance

 and seizures. The virus localizes to the CNS where it elicits a strong IFN response, T cell infil-
tration with increased expression of RNA coding for Ifng, granzymeB, perforin1 and Il-2. In
addition, these mice show evidence of neurodegeneration in particular affecting the Purkinje
and granular cell layers of the cerebellum as evidencedby Fluoro-Jade C staining. Our data

 suggests that innate and adaptive responses can limit viral expansion but may also play a role
in pathological changes in the CNS.
In response to the outbreak of ZIKV and its association with increased congenital and neu-
rological disease, animal models are being developed with unprecedented celerity to under-
stand the pathogenesis of the disease and test possible therapeutics and vaccines. Early studies
in mice had suggested that ZIKV can replicate and cause injury in cells of the central nervous
system [1,35,36] but used the prototype MR 766 strain of ZIKV, which had undergone exten-
sive passage in suckling mouse brains. Several new mouse models of ZIKV were developed
over the past 6 months using current viral isolates. Using a low passage Cambodian isolate of
ZIKV, Rossi et al showed that 3 week old A129 and AG129 mice, which lack type I or I & II
IFN respectively, develop paralysis and succumb to disease by 7 dpi while older mice showed
viremia and weight loss but recovered after day 8[15,29]. Similar results were observedby
Lazear et al, using either 4–6 week old A129 or Irf3/5/7 triple knockout mice challenged with
ZIKV (H/PF/2013) from French Polynesia, as well as African ZIKV strain MR 766[28]. Our
studies advance on these findings by characterizing the immune response to ZIKV in the CNS
and key peripheral organs. We show that in the CNS of mice with deficient IFN responses the
virus in the brain was localized predominantly to the cerebellum at the peak of disease and elic-
its a marked inflammatory response characterized by significant increases in the mRNA
expression of complement (C3), Cox2, Il1a, Il1b, and Il6. The increased mRNA expression of
Sele, Selp, Csf2 and Csf3 is consistent with the observedincrease in infiltrating neutrophils and
macrophages evident by flow cytometry. Together this pattern of expression suggests the acti-
vation of microglia and/or infiltration of activated macrophages, which has been shown to lead
to uncontrolled inflammation and neuronal death in other models of flavivirus encephalitis
such as mice infected with Japanese encephalitis virus [37]. Interestingly, despite significant
upregulation of markers for inflammation and the evidence of infiltrating neutrophils and
macrophages, the infected IFNAR KO mice did not show significant increase in the expression
of genes linked to apoptosis (including BCL2, Bax, Agtr2 or Bcl2l1) (S3 Fig). This differs from
studies showing a role for caspase 3 in the apoptosis of infected neurons in vitro [38]. Similarly
we found no evidence of widespread neurodegeneration in the CNS, although this could be due
to the rapid progression of the disease, or result from the absence of IFN responses, which
could sensitize the tissue to apoptosis and support CD8+ T cell mediated cytotoxic responses
[39]. Alternatively, recent studies suggest that ZIKV infection results in the formation of autop-
hagosomes that facilitate virus replication [40]. Since autophagy is negatively correlated with
Type I interferon production [41], it is possible that the increase in viral load and lack of infil-
trating T cells in IFNAR KO mice may be secondary to increased autophagy, reduced antigen
clearance by programmed necrosis, and/or reduced presentation. Additional studies will be
needed to assess the effects of infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages in the CNS of infected
IFNAR KO mice and determine whether they would constitute a therapeutic target in the
human disease. Lastly, given the limited neurodegeneration observedin the CNS of IFNAR KO
mice at peak of disease and the rapidity of death in the IFNAR KO mice, it is possible that
infection of the peripheral organs contribute to the lethality of ZIKV infection in IFNAR KO
mice, and thus although the mice show clear signs of neurological damage, additional studies
will be needed to establish the cause of death in the infected IFNAR KO mice.
The neonatal B6 WT model presents several striking differences with the IFNAR KO model
used in these studies. In addition to the differences in the pace (prodrome of 13 vs 5 days) and
survival, the B6 WT model shows no evidence of virus spread into spleen or liver at the peak of
the disease, following subcutaneous infection. This may be secondaryto the effect of increased
levels of ISG expression resulting in protection of the peripheral organs as well as lower levels
of virus in the CNS of B6 WT compared to IFNAR KO mice. In other words, it is conceivable

 that the absence of virus in the periphery of B6 WT mice reflects the preferential homing of the
virus to the CNS or the more efficient IFN-mediated protection of virus in other organs. Indeed
the levels of mRNA for type I IFNs at the peak of clinical disease are strikingly low and suggest
that the virus may interfere with the IFN response as reported for other viruses [42,43]. Addi-
tional studies will clarify whether the virus in the B6 WT model exclusively infects the nervous
system or whether infections extend to peripheral tissues where it is rapidly cleared and assess
whether it extends to the eye as has been reported in the IFNAR KO models.
The B6 WT model also differs from the IFNAR KO model in the type of cellular infiltration
and immune response in the CNS at the peak of infection, with IFNAR KO displaying exten-
sive infiltration of neutrophils and macrophage as well as upregulation of inflammatory genes
such as IL-6, TNFa and IL-1, whereas B6 WT mice show cellular infiltrates composed primarily
of T cells and upregulation of genes associated with Th1 CD4+T cells and IFN-driven cytotoxic
CD8+ T cell responses. Indeed, the differential influx of immune cells evident in the CNS of B6
WT and IFNAR KO mice may underlie the differential clinical outcome. It is possible that the
direct damage that Zika causes to the tissue is only one component of its pathogenesis, while
the immune response it elicits may also contribute to the pathology. In recent studies we
showed that mice infected with Tacaribe virus develop a meningoencephalitisthat is driven by
the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response to the virus as mice lacking T cells do not develop disease
despite high levels of virus in the CNS[32]. Similar observations were made in mice infected
with Sindbis or West Nile virus [44–46]. While it is possible that the influx of T cells into the
CNS of B6 WT plays a key role in controlling the virus and aids in the survival of the host, the
presence of foci of degenerating neurons suggests that the influx of CD8+ T cells may be driv-
ing the observedneuropathology. Understanding the role the different immune cells play in
pathogenesis and anti-viral responses will be critical for rational development of therapeutic
and preventive approaches.
Type I IFNs play a key role in the earliest responses to viral infections and it is well known
that several Flaviviruses interfere with IFN production or activity [47,48], however other fac-
tors such as age, neuronal and astrocyte maturation are likely important factors for the estab-
lishment of productive infections as observedwith other neurotropic RNA viruses including
Sindbis, Chikungunya and Tacaribe virus, where neonate but not adult mice develop produc-
tive infections [25,26,49]. Similar resistance to challenge was recently reported in studies with
ZIKV in IFN deficient mice [28]. In our studies, the virus replicates in neonatal neural tissue in
both B6 WT and IFNAR KO mice, but was present in peripheral tissues only in IFNAR KO
mice suggesting that: i) interferons play a role in limiting ZIKV spread but the virus can infect
other tissues if the innate immune response to the virus is deficient and ii) the virus can infect
immature nervous tissue even in immunocompetent animals. Detailed studies of the kinetics
of infection and clearance in other organs of B6 WT and IFNAR KO mice are underway to
understand whether the virus can establish and/or clear productive infections in other immu-
noprivileged sites.
These studies establish and characterize the first contemporary ZIKV animal model in
immunocompetent neonatal B6 WT mice. The loss of balance and altered gait observedare con-
sistent with the evidence of neurodegeneration and infiltration by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the
cerebellum of B6 WT mice. The presence of infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells also suggests
that the virus could induce an immune response that triggers a neurodestructiveinflammatory
response in the CNS. The B6 WT model will allow for studies into the immunopathology of the
virus in a milieu that does not exclude one of the main immune paths for resistance to virus
infection. Given the breadth of knock out and transgenic strains available on a C57BL/6 back-
ground, it will facilitate detailed investigations into the pathogenesis of the disease as well as
mechanistic studies for possible therapeutics. While the need to infect mice at day 1 of life may

 limit its utility in assessing the direct protective effect of vaccines, it allows for conducting vacci-
nation studies in pregnant mice followed by challenges in the offspring. Lastly, since this model
entails a 13 day prodromal phase, it provides an opportunity for the testing of potential thera-
peutics and its non-lethal outcome allows for studies assessing the long term effects of the infec-
tion, and offers the option of testing conditions that may lead to reactivation of the disease.
Materials and Methods
Mice
C57BL/6 (B6) and C57BL/6-IFNAR-/- (IFNAR KO) mice used in this study were bred as
homozygous breeding pairs (>20 generations). Mice were housed in sterile microisolator cages
under 12-hour day/night cycle and given food and water ad libitum in the specific pathogen-
free, AAALAC accredited animal facility of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Division
of Veterinary Medicine (Silver Spring, MD).
Ethics Statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Public Health
ServicePolicy on Humane care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All protocols involving ani-
mals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at US-FDA (Protocol Number:
#2016–14).
ZIKV Preparation
Zika virus PRVABC59 (Puerto Rico strain) used in this study is a contemporary strain that was
isolated by CDC from the serum of a ZIKV infected patient who travelled to Puerto Rico in
2015. The complete genome sequence is published (Ref. Gene bank accession # KU501215).
The virus stocks used for these studies had a titer of 7.2 log10 pfu/mL. Virus stocks from CDC
were kindly provided by Maria Rios (Food and Drug Administration).
ZIKV Infections
All newborn mice were born from pathogen-free parents and inoculated with 2000 PFU or
20,000 PFU as indicated by subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculation. IFNAR KO mice were inoculated
at 10 days of life (P10) and C57BL/6 mice were inoculated one day after birth (P1). In some
experiments IFNAR KO mice were infected on P1 and P3 and C57BL/6 mice were infected on
P10. For experiments tracking survival following ZIKV infection, mice were monitored daily
for clinical signs of pathology and weighed every other day to minimize handling. Moribund
(unable to access nutrition due to severe paresis and/or respiratory distress) animals were
euthanized in accordance with the FDA IACUC guidelines.
Clinical evaluation
Mice were examined daily for signs of infection and weighed on alternate days. Examination
included appearance, stance, and motility. Fig 1C includes a description of the changes
observedincluding the evidence of tremors, hyperactivity (increased motor exertion and excit-
ability), stance (increased spread of hind legs while standing or walking), staggered march (evi-
dence of unusual pauses during movement), limb collapse (refers to the momentary collapse of
the limb under the weight of the body), seizures (partial loss of voluntary movement with evi-
dence of stiffness and/or tonic contraction of the hind legs), flaccid paralysis (loss of muscle
tone with collapse of the lower extremities).

 Virus quantification
For brain homogenates, infected mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and exsangui-
nated by trans-cardiac perfusion. Brains were removed aseptically, placed in 2 ml of cold RPMI
media (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, CA) and manually disrupted with ice cold Tenbroeck glass
grinders (Wheaton, Millville, NJ) until uniform homogenates were obtained. The cellular frac-
tions were pelleted by centrifugation at 400 x g for 15 min. The supernatants were collected
and stored at -80°C prior to virus assay. The pelleted (cellular) fraction was used for flow
cytometryanalysis (see below). In some experiments the homogenates were directly stored at
-80°C and centrifuged after thawing. The supernatants were then used for the assay.
Infectious ZIKV levels were measured as TCID50/0.5g of tissue on Vero monolayers using
an end-point dilution assay as previously described[50,51]. ZIKV RNA levels were measured
using quantitative one step reverse transcriptase PCR to amplify ZIKV genome position 1087
to 1163 based on ZIKV MR 766 strain (GenBank accession no. AY632535) Zika virus RNA
transcript levels in the samples were quantified by comparing to a standard curve generated
using dilutions of an RNA transcript copy of ZIKV sequence. We used 5 micrograms of iso-
lated total RNA for each sample analyzed and ZIKV RNA levels are expressed as ZIKV copies/
mL using a standard curve (S4 Fig). The assay can detect all known genotypes of ZIKV and
does not cross react with closely related viruses and was performed as described[50].Briefly,
the amplification was performed using 25 ul volume in the Applied Biosystem Viia7 real time
PCR machine with the following cycles and conditions: 1st cycle 60C for 30 min followed by
95C for 15 min. The ensuing 45 cycles used 95°C 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min.
Real-time PCR and Taqman Low Density Arrays (TLDA)
Brains were collected from infected animals that were exsanguinated by transcardiac perfusion
with 10 ml ice-cold PBS. The brains were then bisected along the longitudinal fissure and the
entire hemisphere of one half brain was flash frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80°C. The fro-
zen tissue was homogenized in 2 mL/half-brain of Trizol reagent (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad,
CA) and RNA was isolated following the manufacturers’ protocol and resuspended in molecu-
lar grade ultra-pure ddH2O. The concentration and purity of isolated RNA was determined by
spectrophotometryat 260 nm and 280 nm using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Ther-
moFisher, Carlsbad, CA). To eliminate potential genomic DNA contamination, the DNA-free
Turbo kit (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, CA) was used as per the manufacturers protocol. Reverse
transcription was performed on 1 μg of total RNA, using Multiscript High Capacity Reverse
Transcriptase (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, CA), per the manufacturer’s protocol, using random
primers. The resulting cDNA was diluted ten-fold with ultra-pure water and stored at -20°C
prior to use in real-time Taqman PCR reactions (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, CA).
Mouse Immune Array TLDA cards (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, CA) were used as per manu-
facturers’ instructions. Briefly, the cDNA generated above was diluted 2-fold. Equal volumes of
diluted cDNA and 2x Universal Taqman Master Mix was prepared. This mixture was loaded
into the chambers of a Taqman Array card, which was centrifuged to distribute the cDNA
throughout the card. IFN and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) expression levels were mea-
sured using individual Taqman gene assays for IFN-β, ISG-15, OAS-1g (ThermoFisher,
Carlsbad, CA). The cDNA used in the TLDA reactions was also used for these single gene
expression assays, with each sample being run in triplicate for each gene. Fold-change in gene
expression was determined using the ΔΔCt method [52], with expression normalized to the
expression of the house keeping gene GAPDH. Gene expression is expressed as fold change
relative to the indicated uninfected controls. Real-time PCR acquisition and analysis was

 performed using a Viia7 real-time PCR machine using Quant Studio software, using automatic
threshold and endpoint settings (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, CA).
Immunofluorescence Immunohistochemistry (IF-IHC) and histology
Brains were removed from exsanguinated Zika infected mice or age-matched uninfected con-
trol mice, as describedabove. The brains were then bisected along the longitudinal fissure and
one-half of the brain was submerged in 10% neutral buffered formalin (in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS), pH 7.4). The other half was flash frozen in liquid N2 for RNA isolation of quantifi-
cation of virus. After more than 24 hours in fixative, the half-brains were rinsed with PBS and
submerged 30% sucrose for cyro-protection. The brains remained in sucrose until they sank in
the solution (typically 24–48 hours). Sucrose saturated tissue was then embedded in TissueTek
O.C.T (Sakura-Finetek, Torrance, CA) by freezing the brains in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Sakura-
Finetek, Torrance, CA) embedding compound using 2 methyl butane cooled with dry ice. The
brains were wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at -80°C. Sagittal sections (20 μm thick) were
cut using a Leica CM1900 cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) and thaw-mounted
onto SuperFrost-plus microscope slides (Fisher Scientific,Carlsbad, CA). The sections were
stored at -80°C until staining. Prior to staining, sections were thawed and dried at room temper-
ature (RT) for approximately 10 min, rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and permea-
bilized using 0.2% Tween-20 in PBS for 20 minutes at RT. For ZIKV staining, antigen
unmasking was performed prior to staining by submerging the sections in Sodium citrate solu-
tion (pH8.8, 80°C) for 30 minute. These sections were then blocked with 1% low fat milk in
PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 for 1 hour prior to staining. All other sections were blocked with 5%
normal goat serum + 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 for at least
60 minutes at RT. Primary antibodies used include: mouse anti-flavivirus mAb (cloneD1- 4G2-
4-15; EMD Millipore), human polyclonal anti-zika virus envelope antibody (Kerafast EVU302,
MA), neurofilament heavy chain cocktail [SMI31 and SMI32 mAb] (Biolegend) and rat anti-
CD45 (BD Biosciences). Tissue sections were incubated overnight in a humidified chamber at
4°C with primary antibodies diluted with 1% BSA in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20. The slides
were then rinsed with PBS and incubated with the appropriate AlexaFluor-conjugated (raised
in goat) secondary antibodies, diluted in 1% BSA in PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (ThermoFisher,
Carlsbad, CA) for > 60 min at RT. All IF-IHC sections were mounted with ProLong Diamond
anti-fade mounting media containing DAPI (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, CA).Fluorescently
labelled antibodies were detected at emission wavelengths: 405 (DAPI), 535 (Alexa-fluor 488,
Fluoro-Jade C), 605 (Alexa-fluor 568). Sections were imaged using a Pannoramic Digital Slide
Scanner. Images were captured using Pannoramic Viewer software (3DHistech, Budapest,
HUN). Fluoro-Jade C histology staining, which specificallydetects neuronal degeneration,[53]
was performed as per the manufacturers protocol (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). For confocal
imaging, sections were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope, using a 405 nm, 488
nm, and 561 nm excitation lasers. Optimal fluorescence detection settings were determined
using B6 WT sections and applied to all other sections. Images were acquired using the Zeiss
Zen software using a Z-stack, with slices of 0.44–0.49 microns per slice for all sections. Laser
and PMT setting were consistent for uninfected and infected sections. Maximum intensity pro-
jections of these Z-stacks were generated using the Zen software. All images were prepared for
publication using Adobe Photoshop CC 2015 software.
Flow Cytometry
The cellular fractions of brain homogenates (see Virus Quantification) were pooled and resus-
pended in 30% percoll (GE Life Sciences, Marlborough, MA) in RPMI + 25 mM HEPES

 (ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, CA) and underlayed with 1 ml of 70% percoll. After centrifugation
at 800 x g for 30 minutes, CNS cells were collected from the 30%-70% interface, washed in
RPMI and isolated by centrifugation at 400 x g for 10 minutes.
Non-specific antibody binding was blocked with a mix of mouse Fc block (purified α-CD16/
32, BD Biosciences) and normal mouse serum for at least 15 minutes. All antibodies (anti-
CD45, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD11b, anti-CD19 anti-Ly6G, anti-NK1.1 (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA)); and anti-F4/80 (AbD Serotec, Raleigh,NC) were directly conjugated with one
of the following fluorochromes: fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE), peridi-
nin-chlorophyll proteins (PerCP), or alophycocyanin (APC). The cells were incubated with
these antibodies for 20 min in FACS buffer (1% BSA in PBS), then washed with FACS buffer,
fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde solution and acquired using a BD Fortessa flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The flow cytometer was calibrated using beads (eBiosciences) con-
jugated with fluorescent antibodies for each channel in the assay. The resulting data from each
samples was analysed using FlowJo (version 10) software (FlowJo, LLC, Ashland, OR).
