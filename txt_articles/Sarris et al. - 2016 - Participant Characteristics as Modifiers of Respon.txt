Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a frequently 
debilitating neuropsychiatric disorder, and often presents 
in a chronic waxing and waning nature (Franklin & Foa, 
2011). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as 
well as clomipramine (an older tricyclic antidepressant) 
are considered to be the first-line pharmacological inter-
ventions for OCD (Franklin & Foa, 2011; Slade, Johnston, 
Oakley Browne, Andrews, & Whiteford, 2009). Despite 
demonstrating positive effects in several instances (Bloch, 
McGuire, Landeros-Weisenberger, Leckman, & Pittenger, 
2010), it is estimated that 40% of patients do not achieve 
a clinical response from these medications, nor other 
augmentation strategies (Pallanti, Grassi, & Cantisani, 
2014). In addition, SSRIs are often required at signifi-
cantly higher doses than those used for the treatment 
of depression to obtain clinical benefits in OCD, which 
may result in a greater degree of adverse side effects 
including sedation, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction, 
and complete functional recovery is rare (Bandelow, 
2008). Due to these reasons, other adjunctive treatments 
are often of necessity; one such potential treatment is the 
amino-acid-based agent N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).
NAC is a pharmaceutically prepared amino acid agent 
that acts as a “pro-drug” for cysteine, which then normal-
izes glutamate transmission in corticostriatal brain circuitry 
(Choy, Dean, Berk, Bush, & van den Buuse, 2010). NAC 
exerts glutamate-modulating effects through its interaction 
with the glutamate/cystine antiporter system (XC-), and is

Abstract
We previously reported on a 16-week, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) using 3 grams per day 
of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) (1.5 grams twice per day) in 44 participants (aged 18–70) with DSM-5-diagnosed obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD). We now report on an analysis of age, severity and duration of illness, OCD presentation 
type, baseline anxiety and depression scores, as well as the use of antidepressant medications as potentially modifying 
factors. Results revealed a significant effect (p = .037) for younger participants (under mean age of 34) responding to 
NAC. This remained significant using OCD severity as a covariate (p = .044). For those under 34 years of age with less 
than 17 years of OCD duration, this was also significant (p = .037). Regression analysis within the NAC treatment group 
also revealed that duration of OCD presentation was a significant predictor of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale 
(YBOCS) change at study endpoint (p = .019), whereas baseline Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores 
were also a trend-level predictor (p = .060) of YBOCS change in the NAC group.

also a key precursor in the synthesis of the endogenous 
antioxidant glutathione. Cystine, the oxidized form of cys-
teine, has the ability to activate XC-, which are primarily 
located on glial cells in the brain and responsible for the 
clearance of glutamate in the synapse (Han et al., 1997). 
Once activated by cystine, intracellular glutamate is 
exchanged and released into the extracellular space, 
whereas cystine taken up by the glial cell is used to form 
glutathione. Extracellular glutamate has the ability to bind 
to group II metabotropic receptors (mGluR2/3), located on 
neighboring presynaptic glutamatergic neurons. This results 
in the inhibition of further glutamate release from presyn-
aptic neurons and thus regulates its neurotransmission 
(Moran, McFarland, Melendez, Kalivas, & Seamans, 2005). 
By modulating excess levels of synaptic glutamate, excitox-
icity and neuronal damage is also reduced, and thus pro-
vides an additional mechanism by which NAC may improve 
brain health (Miyamoto, Murphy, Schnaar, & Coyle, 1989). 
Furthermore, low levels of glutathione and excessive levels 
of glutamate have both been shown to contribute to hypo-
function of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (Steullet, 
Neijt, Cuenod, & Do, 2006). NAC’s ability to replenish glu-
tathione levels and regulate excessive levels of glutamate 
provides an additional effect on modulating glutamate 
activity by restoring the function of this receptor.
Several clinical trials have been conducted using NAC 
for a range of psychiatric disorders (Berk, Malhi, Gray, & 
Dean, 2013; Deepmala et al., 2015), and it has been dem-
onstrated to be well tolerated in doses up to 8 grams per 
day (De Rosa et al., 2000). Although NAC has evidence of 
efficacy in bipolar depression, schizophrenia, trichotilloma-
nia, and other compulsive behaviors, to our knowledge 
there is limited evidence to date assessing its efficacy in 
treating OCD. Recent data exist from a double-blind ran-
domized controlled trial (RCT) of adjunctive NAC in the 
treatment of OCD (Afshar et al., 2012). This 12-week study 
conducted in Iran involved 48 participants with OCD diag-
nosed according to criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric 
Association, 1994), using 2.4 grams per day of NAC or 
matching placebo tablets and found that the NAC treatment 
group demonstrated a significant reduction in OCD symp-
toms as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compul-
sive Scale (YBOCS; p = .003). Due to results appearing in 
the study to be more pronounced only after Week 8, we 
conducted a longer 16-week double-blind RCT (Sarris 
et al., 2015) using a higher dose of NAC (3 grams per day) 
to potentially elicit a stronger effect. In brief, our RCT 
involved 44 participants (aged 18–70) with DSM-5- 
diagnosed OCD, recruited between 2013 and 2015 in Mel-
bourne, Australia. The primary outcome measure was the 
YBOCS, conducted every 4 weeks. Results of the main 
analysis of the full sample with repeated-measures mixed 
linear modeling revealed a nonsignificant Time × Treat-
ment interaction for the YBOCS scale total score (p = .39; 
cf. Sarris et al., 2015). Although like the 12-week Iranian 
study an apparent effect was emerging by Week 12 on a 
per protocol analysis removing protocol violators, at Week 
16 this study failed to show a significant Time × Treatment 
interaction for YBOCS total score (p = .15). It is unclear 
why the effect dissipated from Week 12; this is potentially 
due to a ceasing of efficacy, or the active group having 
worsening of OCD due to potential concern over the study 
ending. However, a significant Time × Treatment interac-
tion was observed for the YBOCS Compulsions subscale in 
favor of NAC (p = .013), with a significant reduction 
observed at Week 12 (dissipating at Week 16). At 16 weeks 
only four (20%) of the participants in the NAC group were 
considered “responders” (YBOCS ≥ 35% reduction at end-
point) versus four (27%) in the placebo group.
In the recent systematic review of NAC for the treatment 
of OCD and related disorders (Oliver et al., 2014), a num-
ber of factors were identified that may moderate the effi-
cacy of NAC for patients with OCD. First, it was argued 
that patients with a more chronic and severe presentation 
of OCD may be less responsive to NAC treatment in com-
parison to patients with moderate presentations of OCD. 
Second, when NAC is used as an augmentation strategy it 
was identified that there may be a differential response to 
NAC on the basis of which class of antidepressant that the 
patient was also concurrently receiving. However, in addi-
tion to these elements, there is potential that other differ-
ential factors such as age and OCD presentation (i.e., the 
nature of the obsessions and compulsions) may also influ-
ence whether a significant response to NAC is observed. 
For example, a moderator analysis of an RCT (Magalhaes 
et al., 2012) testing NAC in bipolar disorder found that 
participants with systemic illness had a greater response 
on functional outcomes, indicating an advantage for those 
with medical comorbidity. Furthermore, in an analysis of 
an OCD RCT (Wheaton, Rosenfield, Foa, & Simpson, 2015) 
comparing the effects of augmenting psychotropic medi-
cations versus exposure and ritual prevention and pla-
cebo, pretreatment OCD severity, age, baseline depression, 
and hoarding moderated outcome after acute treatment, 
whereas baseline level of functioning predicted outcome 
and rate of change across all of the augmentation strate-
gies. For these reasons, in this article we explored the data 
further to determine any participant characteristics or 
modifying factors that may elucidate whether NAC is more 
effective in certain presentations of OCD.
Method
Overview
The overarching study was a 16-week double-blind RCT 
using 3 grams per day of NAC (1.5 grams twice per day) 
or matching placebo in 44 randomized adult participants 
with DSM-5-diagnosed OCD. The study was conducted 
 1106 
Sarris et al.
according to Good Clinical Practice at the Melbourne 
Clinic (where participants were primarily recruited) dur-
ing June 2013 to April 2015. The study was registered on 
the Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, and 
had ethical approval from The Melbourne Clinic Ethics 
Committee (TMC_HREC no. 219). The NAC was provided 
in opaque capsule form, produced by Lipa Pharmaceuti-
cals PTY Ltd., and supplied by BioCeuticals PTY Ltd., in 
strict compliance with pharmaceutical Good Manufactur-
ing Procedure. The certificate of analysis confirmed the 
NAC to have a 99.97% purity. The placebo group was 
administered the same dosing regimen of matching 
opaque capsules containing cellulose.
Participants were required to meet the following crite-
ria: age 18 to 70, capacity to consent to the study and 
follow its procedures, fulfill the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic cri-
teria (based on the Mini International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview–Plus; MINI-Plus) for obsessive-compulsive 
spectrum disorder (OCSD; and diagnosed OCD with the 
insight specifier from the DSM-5, via clinician assess-
ment), score 16 (moderate) or over on the YBOCS at the 
time of study entry, and on either no treatment or a stable 
treatment regimen for a minimum of 4 weeks of current 
treatment and a minimum of 12 weeks if it was their first 
OCD treatment. Self-reported OCD was assessed and 
confirmed by physician diagnosis; female participants 
were required to use effective contraception if of child-
bearing age and sexually active. Participants were ineli-
gible to enter the trial if they had any of the following 
conditions: currently engaged in a psychological pro-
gram (e.g., a 2-week OCD behavioral modification pro-
gram or an intensive cognitive behavioral therapy course; 
ongoing psychological or medical care was accepted); 
known or suspected clinically unstable serious medical 
disorder; bipolar I disorder, schizophrenia, epilepsy, 
asthma, or recent gastrointestinal ulcers; pregnancy or 
breastfeeding; consumption per day of over 250 mg of 
NAC, 100 mcg of selenium, or 500 IU of vitamin E; or his-
tory of hypersensitivity or intolerance to NAC or any 
component of the preparation. The primary outcome 
assessment was the YBOCS (Goodman, 1989). Secondary 
outcome assessments were the Clinical Global Impres-
sion Scales–Severity and Improvement (CGI; Guy & 
Bonato, 1970), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA; 
Hamilton, 1959), the Montgomery–Asberg Depression 
Rating Scale (MADRS; Montgomery & Asberg, 1979), 
the General Health Questionnaire-28 (Goldberg, 1978), 
and purpose-designed demographics/medical history/
drug/alcohol use forms.
Moderator analysis
Details of the primary efficacy analysis are included in 
Sarris et al. (2015). The effects of five moderator variables 
(both separately and in combination where significance 
or trend for significance was found) were assessed in the 
current analysis: age (years), OCD severity (YBOCS total 
at baseline), duration of illness (years), gender, medica-
tion status, and OCD symptom presentation. A median 
split was conducted on age to calculate a dichotomous 
age group variable (young, old). Similarly, an OCD sever-
ity variable (moderate, severe) was calculated by con-
ducting a median split on baseline YBOCS total scores, 
and OCD duration was similarly determined by median 
split on OCD illness duration. Analyses were also con-
ducted stratifying participants who were taking antide-
pressant medication versus those who were not. The data 
were also stratified and analyzed based on partici-
pants’ OCD domains: aggressive, contamination, sexual/
religious, symmetry/order. Separate repeated measures 
ANOVAs were then conducted using the stratified sam-
ples, with study visit (Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, 
and Week 16) as the within-subject variable and treat-
ment group (placebo, NAC) as the between-subject vari-
able. The continuous variable characteristics were also 
used as covariates in a repeated measures ANCOVA 
model. Regression analysis was also conducted on 
YBOCS change scores, from baseline to study endpoint 
(16 weeks), using continuous predictors which were 
found to correlate (p < .10) with YBOCS change in the 
NAC treatment group. All variables were centered on 
zero by subtracting the mean from each case, then 
entered into a single-step linear regression. All tests of 
treatment effects were conducted using a two-tailed 
alpha level of .05 (.10 considered a trend for significance) 
and 95% confidence intervals. Data were analyzed via 
SPSS 22.0.
Results
Participant characteristics
After 189 enquiries, a total of 44 participants were ran-
domized into the study, demonstrating a recruitment con-
version rate of 23% and achieving 88% of the calculated 
projected sample size required (n = 50) to detect a clini-
cally significant result. Seven participants withdrew from 
the study with no between-group differences. The sam-
ple consisted of slightly more males (n = 24; 54.5%), 
whereas the median age of the sample was 34 years 
(range 18 to 68 years; interquartile range 15). All partici-
pants met the DSM-5 criteria for OCD at the time of entry 
into the study. The chronicity of OCD ranged from 2 
years to over 45 years in duration (M = 16.36 years, SD = 
9.5 years). Five participants (11.4%) reported a family his-
tory of OCD, and more than half the participants (56.8%; 
n = 25) had a DSM-IV-diagnosed comorbid psychiatric 
disorder (as per the MINI-Plus Version 6). A majority of

the participants (79.5%) were taking psychotropic medi-
cation, namely SSRIs (56.8%), and 13 participants (29.5%) 
were utilizing adjunctive therapies such as antipsychot-
ics. Examples of the intrusive thoughts and compulsions 
experienced by the participants can be seen in Table 1. 
These consisted primarily of aggressive, contamination, 
sexual/religious, or symmetry/order domains.
Moderator analysis outcomes
A significant effect was revealed for younger participants 
(< 34 years; f = 2.70, p = .037; Fig. 1). This remained sig-
nificant using OCD severity as a covariate (f = 2.98, p = 
.044). Further analysis revealed a trend (f = 2.38, p = .089) 
for those with duration of OCD illness under 17 years 
(mean duration), and for younger participants with less 
than 17 years of duration this was also significant (f = 
3.19, p = .037). A nonsignificant effect was revealed when 
the sample was stratified for severity (p = .61 < 26 YBOCS, 
p = .59 > 26 YBOCS), and also for female gender (p = 
.42). Investigations into whether NAC was effective for 
differing presentations of OCD (e.g., aggression, sexual/
religious, symmetry/ordering obsessions), revealed a 
trend in favor of the NAC group for the “aggression” sub-
type (f = 3.15, p = .059), whereas a subanalysis of partici-
pants taking medication (70.5%; primarily selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors) revealed no effect (p = 
.19). A trend in favor of the NAC group was revealed for 
those who were younger and taking antidepressants (f = 
2.38, p = .098).
Regression analysis outcomes
The following continuous predictors were found to cor-
relate (p < .10) with YBOCS change in the NAC treatment 
group: baseline MADRS total (r = .441, p = .04), baseline 
HAMA total (r = .391, p = .072), baseline CGI severity (r = 
.456, p = .033), and duration of OCD presentation (r = 
.389, p = .073). These variables were not found to corre-
late significantly with YBOCS change in the placebo 
group. The only variable that was found to correlate at 
the p = .10 level with YBOCS change in the placebo 
group was age (r = −.387, p = .075).
The linear regression analysis in the NAC treatment 
group demonstrated that the duration of OCD presenta-
tion was a significant predictor of YBOCS change at study 
endpoint (β = .629, t = 2.598, p = .019), and that baseline 
MADRS total score was also approaching significance as 
a predictor of YBOCS change (β = .799, t = 2.018, p = 
.060). The overall model, with the four predictors, was 
found to explain 46.5% (adjusted R2 = 33.9%) of the vari-
ance in YBOCS change scores at study endpoint. The 
variance explained by the four predictors was found to 
be significant, R2 = .465, F(4, 21) = 3.694, p = .024. A sum-
mary of the regression output is displayed in Table 2.
These findings demonstrate that in the current sample 
receiving NAC for 16 weeks, a longer duration of OCD 
presentation was associated with a reduction in the 
amount of YBOCS improvement observed, that is, for 
every additional 10 years of OCD illness, there was on

average a 3.88 point YBOCS decrease in treatment 
response. Similarly, participants who presented with a 
higher level of depression symptoms at baseline, were 
also found to display less of a response to NAC treatment, 
that is, for every additional 10-point increase on the 
MADRS at baseline there was on average a 4.51 point 
YBOCS decrease in treatment response at study end-
point. Partial regression plots for duration of OCD pre-
sentation and baseline MADRS versus YBOCS changes 
are displayed in Figure 2.
Discussion
As we have previously reported, 3 grams of NAC supple-
mented for 16 weeks did not to exert a statistically signifi-
cant effect over placebo for reducing the severity of OCD 
symptoms as measured by the YBOCS (time by treatment 
interaction). However, when stratified for a range of char-
acteristics, it was revealed that those who were younger, 
and had a lesser duration of OCD diagnosis may respond 
more favorably to NAC. This latter finding was also cor-
roborated by the regression analysis in the NAC treat-
ment group, whereby less of a treatment response to 
NAC was found in participants with a longer duration of 
OCD presentation. There is also the potential that NAC 
may work more effectively in younger people or in those 
who may have the ‘aggressive’ subtype of OCD. It stands 
to reason that NAC is more effective in younger people 
with a lesser duration of the illness, could be due to 
“intractable” treatment-resistant OCD presentations being 
harder to treat. It is interesting to note that more cases of 
placebo response were found in the older participants 
(aged > 34); this may be due to reporting error from 
potential cognitive decline. NAC may also potentially 
work synergistically with medications. A recent animal 
model exploring the effects of NAC adjunctively with 
various antidepressants highlighted its beneficial activity 
on the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine and the SSRI 
escitalopram (Costa-Campos et al., 2013). A dose of 
5 mg/kg escitalopram and 1 mg/kg of NAC, used adjunc-
tively to the antidepressants respectively, resulted in the 
reduction of the minimum effective doses required of 
each, as determined by a reduction in immobility in the 
tail suspension test. These effects were, however, not 
seen with NAC adjunctive to fluoxetine, or with increased 
doses of NAC with escitalopram and imipramine. It is 
also interesting to note that regression analysis revealed 
that those with higher levels of depression (MADRS base-
line scores) may also be less responsive to NAC treat-
ment. Although this predictor was found to be significant 
only at a trend level (p = .060), it is worthy of further 
investigation regarding whether comorbid depression 
may reduce the efficacy of NAC treatment.
It should be noted that this cohort’s OCD was 
extremely chronic, with a long duration of the disorder, 
majority taking multiple medications (SSRIs, tricyclic anti-
depressants, anticonvulsants, or antipsychotics) and OCD 
severity ranging from moderate to extreme (YBOCS 
range 25–34 at baseline). Participants who did not dem-
onstrate a full clinical response to NAC in the current 
study share similarities those in the Van Ameringen 
cohort (Van Ameringen, Patterson, Simpson, & Turna, 
2013) in respect to OCD severity and dose of NAC used. 
This suggests that NAC at the 3 gram dose may not be 
satisfactory to elicit a clinical effect. However, larger scale 
clinical trials are required to confirm this, given that the 
subanalysis in the current study to explore these vari-
ables resulted in small sample sizes. Thus, the insignifi-
cant findings could be the result of a Type II error.
This study was not without its limitations. Final recruit-
ment resulted in 44 participants, and thus the targeted sam-
ple size of 50 to power the study was not achieved. 
Recruitment itself proved difficult, with many people ineli-
gible due to comorbidities or not inclined to participate. 
The inability to obtain large sample sizes appears consis-
tent with other OCD clinical trials exploring NAC, given the

termination of the proposed study by Pittenger and col-
leagues at Yale University in the last few years. Investiga-
tions into the benefits of NAC for differing presentations of 
OCD (e.g., taboo thoughts vs. perfectionistic vs. contamina-
tion), chronicity, gender, severity, effects of comorbidities, 
adjunctive to medication, monotherapy, and so on were 
also limited, given that stratifying for these variables yielded 
even smaller sample sizes. In addition, a proportion (n = 5, 
14.3%) of the final group did not complete the full 16 
weeks of the study, and four of these participants com-
pleted only until Week 4. Although ITT principles were 
employed in the statistical analysis, detecting a clinically 
relevant result may have been hindered further given that 
NAC has been repeatedly shown to produce therapeutic 
effects after 8 to 12 weeks (Afshar, et al., 2012; Berk et al., 
2008; Grant, Odlaug, & Kim, 2009). A further limitation 
acknowledged is in regard to one of the methods of analy-
sis used (i.e., dichotomizing the continuous data); however, 
other OCD studies have also assessed outcomes based on 
score cutoffs (see A. M. Garcia et al., 2010). We accept that 
applying continuous data into groups should ideally be 
done in quartiles or quintiles; however, this could not be 
undertaken due to the small sample size. However, it is 
reassuring that regression analysis using continuous predic-
tors within the NAC group corroborated one of the primary 
findings of the stratified analysis. Finally, we did not control 
for multiple testing, and the results would not have held 
statistical significance after being corrected.
It is important to consider that the effects of NAC in 
OCD may differ depending on the neurobiologies 
between specialized subdisorders and provide additional 
evidence for the heterogeneous nature of OCD. For 
example, although disturbed glutamate activity is becom-
ing an increasingly regarded feature of OCD, it may be 
limited to a subset of people with polymorphisms in glu-
tamate genes (Pauls, Abramovitch, Rauch, & Geller, 
2014). Thus, NAC may be more suitable in these cases, 
only a handful of which may have been randomized into 
the current study. Furthermore, the form of NAC used 
may be poorly metabolized and thus its therapeutic 
effects limited. A preclinical study has demonstrated sig-
nificantly greater glutathione levels in the brain after the 
administration of N-acetyl cysteine ethyl ester (NACET) 
compared with NAC alone (Giustarini, Milzani, Dalle-
Donne, Tsikas, & Rossi, 2012). NACET is a form of NAC 
with esterification at its carboxyl group, which enhances 
its solubility in lipids and other nonpolar substances and 
thus improves its pharmacokinetics (Giustarini et al., 
2012). Although NACETs use in clinical studies is cur-
rently lacking, this preclinical study raises questions as to 
NAC’s ability to induce the production of GSH in the 
brain and outlines the need for imaging studies to explore 
the bioavailability and activity of both NAC and NACET.
Although a clinical signal of effect for NAC in OCD is 
potentially evident (especially for addressing compul-
sions), a larger sample size study is now crucial to avoid 
the potential occurrence of Type II errors and allow for 
sizable subanalyses to explore the effects of chronicity, 
comorbidity, medication use, gender, as well as OCD 
symptom domains. The diverse clinical presentations and

Sarris et al.
complexities of treatment response in OCD calls for the 
integration of genetic and neurobiological investigations 
alongside psychological and pharmaceutical or nutraceu-
tical interventions. Ideally a trial to encompass all these 
elements and employing advanced spectroscopic imaging 
techniques (to better assess glutamate neurotransmitter 
activity and explore glutathione production in the brain) 
will assist in ascertaining if NAC exerts clinical benefits in 
modulating activity in the regions most heavily implicated 
in the pathogenesis of the disorder. Furthermore, a longer 
study period, with poststudy observational periods, is still 
warranted to ascertain if the implied 12-week effects of 
NAC continue to dissipate or improve with time. Given 
that higher doses of NAC appear to be well tolerated and 
elicit improved effects in other conditions such as ADHD 
(R. J. Garcia et al., 2013), there still remains scope to 
explore higher doses (> 3 grams) in OCD, particularly in 
more chronic presentations.
