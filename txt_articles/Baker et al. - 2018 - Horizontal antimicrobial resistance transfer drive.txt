Horizontal gene transfer has played a role in developing the global public health crisis of
antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, the dynamics of AMR transfer through bacterial
populations and its direct impact on human disease is poorly elucidated. Here, we study
parallel epidemic emergences of multiple Shigella species, a priority AMR organism, in men
who have sex with men to gain insight into AMR emergence and spread. Using genomic
epidemiology, we show that repeated horizontal transfer of a single AMR plasmid among
Shigella enhanced existing and facilitated new epidemics. These epidemic patterns contrasted
with slighter, slower increases in disease caused by organisms with vertically inherited
(chromosomally encoded) AMR. This demonstrates that horizontal transfer of AMR directly
affects epidemiological outcomes of globally important AMR pathogens and highlights the
need for integration of genomic analyses into all areas of AMR research, surveillance and
management.

acterial genomics has revealed that antimicrobial resistance
(AMR) phenotypes are conferred largely by either de novo
mutation in the chromosome or the acquisition of new
AMR genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), both of
which can then be vertically propagated. The importance of HGT
in the current global AMR crisis is evidenced by repeated
observations of a new AMR gene in one organism in one location
being followed by global reports of the gene in other organisms
and
geographical
areas.
This
has
happened
for
the
carbapenemase-encoding blaNDM-1 gene, the extended spectrum
beta-lactamase encoding blaCTX-M genes, and is currently hap-
pening for mcr-1, the gene encoding resistance against the last-
line antimicrobial, colistin1–3. Despite this inferred importance of
HGT in global AMR emergence, the real-time epidemiological
impact of HGT on AMR emergence has never been observed so is
poorly understood. Observations have been made that are sug-
gestive of HGT of AMR (i.e., similar or identical AMR plasmids
in multiple bacterial species within a hospital or patient)4,5, and
such evidence would be enhanced by strong epidemiological data
to support the plausibility of HGT occurring, and information on
the epidemiological fate (e.g., seeding an outbreak, or a dead-end
transmission) of the newly formed pathogen-AMR combination.
Thus, to understand the impact of HGT in the emergence of new
antimicrobial resistant pathogens, it is essential that we study
HGT alongside associated epidemiological information, and at
the population level, where epidemiological outcomes are less
stochastic.
Shigella in MSM is a relevant model for studying AMR
emergence owing to features of both the pathogen and its AMR,
as well as features characteristic of the epidemiological commu-
nity of MSM. Shigellae cause a large burden of disease and are
globally distributed. They are one of the most common causes of
childhood diarrhoeal disease in low-to-middle income nations
and also cause disease in high income nations often, but not
always, linked with travel6,7. In addition to its concerning disease
burden, shigellae are increasingly resistant to antimicrobials
(having accumulated horizontally acquired AMR genes over
time)8,9 and ciprofloxacin-resistant Shigella, a phenotype con-
ferred by mutations in the Quinolone Resistance Determining
Regions (QRDR) of the chromosome, is recognised by the World
Health Organisation as a priority AMR pathogen10. Within the
epidemiological community of MSM in England there are dense
transmission networks of individuals with similar risk profiles
(e.g., HIV co-infection, high partner numbers) currently per-
missive of pathogen epidemics, including some that are highly
resistant to antimicrobials. This permissiveness is evidenced by
recent, simultaneous epidemics of multiple sexually transmissible
illnesses (STIs) in this community, including Lymphogranuloma
venereum, syphilis, and gonorrhoea, the latter of which has
become highly multi-drug resistant11–16.
In addition to these more traditional STIs, Shigella has emerged
as a sexually transmissible enteric infection in MSM that is cap-
able of global dispersal and is associated with AMR17,18. An
MSM-associated (MSMA) S. flexneri 3a lineage that emerged
epidemically in England in 2009 has since disseminated across
four
continents
through
international
transmission
among
MSM19,20, and successful sublineages of this MSMA lineage
carried azithromycin resistance on the conjugative plasmid
pKSR10019. Since 2012, England has experienced two further,
parallel epidemics of domestically acquired shigellosis thought to
be associated with MSM (caused by another serotype of S. flex-
neri; 2a, and another species, S. sonnei21).
Here, we study these parallel Shigella epidemics in a densely
connected epidemiological community to elucidate the role of
HGT on the epidemiology of AMR emergence and spread. We
show that HGT of a single azithromycin resistance plasmid
enhanced and facilitated epidemic emergence of multiple Shigella
species. This demonstrates the importance of tracking the genetic
context of AMR within pathogen populations.
Results
Co-circulating MSMA sublineages. To identify MSMA sub-
lineages, an epidemiologically representative random subsample
of S. flexneri 2a and S. sonnei isolates and associated epidemio-
logical metadata were selected from the national archive of iso-
lates held by the national reference laboratory at Public Health
England collected between 2008 and 2014. The national archive
contains all S. flexneri and ~ 70% of S. sonnei isolated in hospital,
private and regional laboratories (as onward reference laboratory
submission is recommended for S. sonnei, but mandatory for S.
flexneri), and basic epidemiological data were extracted from
sample submission forms, i.e., region, gender, patient age and
travel history where noted (as in21,22). The time-period selected
encapsulated three parallel epidemic emergences of Shigella sp. in
England, and isolates were subsampled proportionately to the
number of cases by year with a greater weighting of domestically
acquired infections (non-travel-associated isolates) and patient
age stratification (16–60 year olds only) for S. sonnei owing to the
large number of isolates of this species (Table 1, Supplementary
Data 1, Supplementary Table 1). The isolates (n = 366) were
whole-genome sequenced (as in ref.
17) and whole-genome
phylogenies were constructed (Fig. 1). Correlating isolate phylo-
genetic positions with patient characteristics revealed six sub-
lineages in which 16–60 years old, male patients without a history
of recent high-risk travel (i.e., travel to Africa, Asia or Latin
America) were significantly over-represented (Odds ratio (OR)
17.8 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.0–46.6, p = 2.2e-16, Fig. 1,
Methods, Supplementary Table 2). These demographic char-
acteristics are typical of MSMA shigellosis patients, and these six
sublineages were designated MSMA. This MSMA designation was
confirmed through a significant association (p = 0.0140, Fisher’s
exact test) of isolate designation to an MSMA sublineage with
recent (within 1 month of diagnosis) patient MSM activity
(Methods). The MSMA sublineages were designated major and
minor in S. flexneri 2a and 1–4 for S. sonnei (Fig. 1). Crucially,
sublineage
presence
over
time
and
temporal
phylogenetic
reconstruction indicated substantial periods of co-existence of
sublineages (Fig. 2). In addition to being co-existent, the MSMA
sublineages were also co-located in geographical space, with at
least 38% of isolates in each MSMA sublineage being from
patients in London (Supplementary Data 1). Thus, the six MSMA
sublineages were circulating in the same epidemiological com-
munity (i.e., London MSM) as each other, alongside the inter-
continentally transmitted MSMA S. flexneri 3a19.
Population-level success of MSMA sublineages. Although
MSMA sublineages were co-circulating their population-level
outcomes differed. Using the combined genomic and epidemio-
logical information, we defined several markers of population-
level success. Specifically, these were: a higher relative disease
burden; greater longevity/persistence of a sublineage in the MSM
population over time; and evidence of international transmission.
Some MSMA sublineages had a higher disease burden in the
English setting (Fig. 2) relative to other MSMA sublineages. For
example, the minor sublineage of S. flexneri 2a contained just
seven isolates, whereas the major sublineage contained 47 isolates.
As these isolates are a representative subsample of cases over
time, proportional differences between coexisting sublineages are
indicative of different population-level success. Taking the
number of isolates attributable to a given MSMA sublineage per
year as a crude estimate of population-level success suggests that

 the major sublineage of S. flexneri 2a and sublineage 2 of S. sonnei
generated the greatest disease burden for each species, respec-
tively, (cases/year in Fig. 2, NB: comparison between species is
invalid owing to different selection criteria—see Table 1,
Supplementary Table 1, and ref. 19). For S. sonnei, it was also
possible to explore persistence of MSMA sublineages in England
over time. This persistence was evaluated by combining the
2008–2014 representative subsample with data from isolates of
MSMA shigellosis clusters detected England in 2015/201622 (n =
50, Table 1, Supplementary Data 1). Of these 50 isolates from
2015/2016, 12 clustered with sublineage 2 and 32 clustered with
sublineage 4, indicating that these two sublineages had continued
to transmit in the English MSM population (Fig. 2, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1).
In addition to those markers of population-level success in
English MSM, whether these MSMA sublineages were present in
a nearby nation with high travel connectivity (France) was
assessed. The French and English MSM epidemiological com-
munities are known to be connected as they were previously
shown
to
have
phylogenetically
admixed
isolates
of
the
intercontinentally distributed sublineage of MSMA S. flexneri
3a19. The 2008–2014 representative subsample from England was
compared with a similarly representative subsample of S. flexneri
2a and S. sonnei from France collected between 2009 and 2014
(n = 115, Table 1, Supplementary Data 1). These analyses showed
that four French isolates belonged to the major sublineage of S.
flexneri 2a, and 13 and 10 French isolates clustered with
sublineages 1 and 4 of S. sonnei respectively, indicating the
presence of these three sublineages in France (Fig. 2, Supple-
mentary Fig. 1). Notably, isolates belonging to MSMA sublineages
from France were also predominately (26 of 27) from 16–60 years
old male patients with no recent history of high-risk travel
(Supplementary Data 1).
Collectively, these markers of population-level success suggest
that the minor sublineage of S. flexneri 2a and sublineage 3 of S.
sonnei performed poorly in their natural transmission setting
relative to the other MSMA sublineages. In addition to causing a
comparatively low number of cases and not persisting through to
2015–16 in UK MSM, they were not found in France, and were
also the only two MSMA sublineages not observed in the final
years of the sampling window, despite having been the earliest
two sublineages in existence (Fig. 2).
Associations with AMR. To investigate the association of
population-level success with AMR, genetic determinants of
AMR were characterised and correlated with phylogeny. Speci-
fically, this included the acquired resistance gene content and the
presence of QRDR mutations (identified as in ref. 23). For both
species, vertically inherited triple QRDR mutations responsible
for resistance to ciprofloxacin were exclusively associated with
monophyletic sublineages related to travel from Asia (OR 98 95%
CI 29.7–395, p < 0.0001, Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 1), although
one
S. sonnei MSMA sublineage
was nested within
this
ciprofloxacin-resistant sublineage. Unlike the MSMA sublineages,
the occurrence of these ciprofloxacin-resistant sublineages over
time was comparatively stable, or only slightly increasing (Fig. 2,
Supplementary Data 1). In contrast, horizontally acquired resis-
tance genes encoding azithromycin resistance were present multi-
phyletically, and were strongly associated with MSMA sub-
lineages (OR 58, 95% CI 20–231, p < 0.0001, Fig. 1, Supplemen-
tary Data 1). Genes encoding ESBLs were uncommon and not
associated with specific phylogenetic sublineages (Fig. 1). Other
AMR determinants conferring resistance to beta-lactams, tri-
methoprim, sulphonamide, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, strep-
tomycin and spectinomycin antimicrobials were common among

 the isolates (Supplementary Data 1) and frequently carried on
mobile genetic elements. Notably, the association of MSMA
shigellosis with azithromycin resistance (rather than resistance to
ciprofloxacin, the recommended treatment for shigellosis24) is
thought to have arisen consequent to high treatment rates for
other STIs commonly found in the shigellosis-affected MSM
subpopulation15,16,19,25, rather than from empirical treatment for
shigellosis. This ‘collateral damage’ hypothesis is supported by
recent treatment reviews (both from the United Kingdom and the
United States), which suggest that upwards of 80% of MSM with
shigellosis receiving antimicrobial therapy are treated with
ciprofloxacin18,26.
Fit sublineages are associated with pKSR100. To better under-
stand the association of azithromycin resistance with MSMA
shigellosis, we fully characterised the genetic elements carrying
azithromycin-resistance
genes
in
each
MSMA
sublineage
(Methods, Supplementary Fig. 2). Azithromycin-resistance genes
were always carried by large (>70 kb) plasmids, and the major
sublineage of S. flexneri 2a and sublineages 1, 2 and 4 of S. sonnei
carried the resistance genes mphA and ermB on the same plasmid;
pKSR100, which contributed to the intercontinental emergence of
MSMA S. flexneri 3a (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3). To confirm the association of pKSR100 with MSMA
sublineages regardless of clonal population structure, and refute
the existence of association with other genetic determinants, a
bacterial genome-wide association study to detect sequence ele-
ments significantly associated with MSMA sublineage isolates was
conducted (Methods), which confirmed that pKSR100 was
strongly associated with MSMA sublineages (Fig. 3). The only
other contiguous sequence to contain any sequence element with
a higher significance than pKSR100 had a reduced density of
MSMA-associated sequence elements and a significantly lower
mean associative value relative to pKSR100 (Supplementary
Fig. 4). The azithromycin-resistance plasmid in the minor sub-
lineage of S. flexneri 2a and sublineage 3 of S. sonnei were distinct

 from pKSR100 and carried only mphA for encoding azithromycin
resistance (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 2). Phenotypic testing on a
subset of isolates revealed that these plasmids conferred differing
levels of azithromycin resistance depending on resistance gene
content. Specifically, isolates carrying both mphA and ermB genes
(n = 17) had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ≥64
mg/l, whereas isolates containing only the mphA gene (n = 13)
had MICs ≤32 mg/l and isolates with neither gene (n = 43) had
MICs of ≤2 mg/l (Supplementary Data 1, Methods, Supplemen-
tary Table 3).
Within MSMA sublineages, pKSR100 was present in those
sublineages that also had some makers of population-level success
and the plasmid also appeared to have a role in driving epidemics.
For example, the major S. flexneri 2a sublineage and the
intercontinental S. flexneri 3a MSMA lineage, both showed a
dramatic increase in numbers following the introduction of
pKSR100 into those sublineages (Fig. 2, Supplementary Data 1,
and ref. 19). Similarly, S. sonnei MSMA sublineages that were still
present in the MSM transmission network in 2015/2016 and/or
were present in France (i.e. sublineages 1, 2 and 4) also contained
pKSR100. Contrastingly, the two MSMA sublineages that did not
contain pKSR100 (the minor sublineage of S. flexneri 2a and
sublineage 3 of S. sonnei) did not achieve such markers of
population-level success (Fig. 2).

 The exact reason behind the differential population-level
success in pKSR100-containing sublineages is unknown. How-
ever, the two most likely explanations both have important
consequences for public health. First, it is possible that the
increased success of pKSR100-containing sublineages is attribu-
table to the increased azithromycin resistance conferred. In which
case, these results point to an epidemiologically relevant division
of azithromycin resistance for Shigella circulating in MSM
between the MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l. Alternatively (and not
exclusively), is the possibility that the increased success of
pKSR100-containing sublineages reflect that different genetic
backgrounds of important resistance genes also have a role in
determining the population-level success of a pathogen. Differ-
ential fitness of mobile genetic elements in bacterial hosts is well
established in vitro27,28, but efforts to link in vitro fitness with
epidemiological, population-level outcomes at a hospital-level
have been unsuccessful29. Although recapitulation of population-
level success in vitro is unrealistic, these results frame an exciting
line of future in vitrowork with the collection of clinically relevant
organisms in our study (and others relevant to HGT of AMR as
they arise), that may be useful in interpreting the apparent impact
of mobile genetic element carriage in determining pathogen
population-level outcomes.
HGT of pKSR100 among MSMA sublineages. The detection of
the same conjugative plasmid in multi-phyletic sublineages co-
circulating a single epidemiological community is strongly sug-
gestive that horizontal plasmid transmission is occurring among
Shigella MSMA sublineages. The exact route of transfer is
unknown, but three non-mutually exclusive scenarios exist: 1 the
HGT occurred directly between Shigella sublineages in patients
simultaneously infected with multiple types; 2 during Shigella
infection, pKSR100 entered another bacterial host (e.g., in the
host microbiota) permitting subsequent transfer to an alternate
Shigella sublineage on repeat infection of that individual; 3 an
alternate bacterial host that contains pKSR100 (possibly acquired
during a prior Shigella infection) was transmitted onward to
another human host who was infected (or subsequently infected)
with an alternate Shigella sublineage (which then received
pKSR100 from the alternate bacterial host). In the first two sce-
narios, infections of patients with multiple types of Shigella is
necessary. Among our samples, we found ten patients with repeat
Shigella infections, including nine with repeat infections of
MSMA sublineages, and two patients infected with different
species of Shigella (suggesting that reinfection with distinct
genetic subtypes is occurring, as well as, potentially, chronic
infection
with
near-identical
subtypes—see
Supplementary
Table 4). The third scenario is consistent with the finding of the
same (non-pKSR100) azithromycin-resistant plasmid in MSMA
S. sonnei sublineage 3 and an isolate of verocytotoxin-producing
Escherichia coli O117:H7 from an outbreak that occurred in the
English MSM population in 201430 (Methods, Supplementary
Fig. 5). Collectively, these findings provide evidence for the
plausible epidemiological connectivity and potential mechanisms
required for HGT of pKSR100 to have occurred among Shigella
types in this setting.
In addition to pKSR100 being found in multi-phyletic
organisms that were epidemiologically connected, further geno-
mic evidence of HGT of pKSR100 was determined through
comparative phylogenetics. Comparing isolate pKSR100 and
genome phylogenetic positions indicated both horizontal and
vertical modes of plasmid transmission among Shigella (Fig. 4).
The relative contribution and combination of these two patterns
of inheritance varied among the three Shigella types. Specifically,

ref. 19) were associated with three pKSR100 variants (Fig. 4), one
of which had an enhanced AMR repertoire, of trimethoprim,
sulphonamide, and streptomycin antimicrobial resistances in
addition to the ampicillin and azithromycin resistances encoded
on all variants (Supplementary Fig. 6). Each plasmid variant was
associated with clonal expansions of closely related genomic
isolates of S. flexneri 3a, consistent with horizontal introduction
of the plasmid into each sublineage and successful onward
transmission of the sublineage/plasmid combination in the
human host (i.e., vertical propagation of pKSR100, Fig. 4). In
addition, one S. flexneri 3a sublineage isolate had a pKSR100
variant, which was more closely related with pKSR100 found in S.
flexneri 3a isolates from a different sublineage, which is strongly
indicative of horizontal transmission (arrow, Fig. 4). By contrast,
S. sonnei primarily had one pKSR100 variant across sublineages 1,
2 and 4, and one evolutionary relationship indicated horizontal
transmission (arrow, Fig. 4). For S. flexneri 2a, there appeared to
have been a single introduction of pKSR100 into the major
sublineage (Fig. 4).
By examining time alongside the comparative phylogenetics we
developed a hypothetical model of the number of HGT events of
pKSR100 (Methods, Supplementary Fig. 7), which also enabled
correlation of HGT to the enhancement and triggering of

 epidemic increases of each Shigella type. Although it is possible
unobserved organisms are involved in pKSR100 HGT (see above),
and our subsample is only a representative quantitation of gene
flow, our proposed combined genomic epidemiological model
indicated that at least eight horizontal transmission events of
pKSR100 occurred among genetically-distinct MSMA subli-
neages. This hypothetical model is summarised both statically
(Supplementary Fig. 7) and as a narrated animation (Supple-
mentary Movie 1), but in brief is as follows: plasmid pKSR100
first appeared in S. sonnei in 2009 and from there, moved into an
emerging epidemic of S. flexneri 3a; pKSR100 then enhanced the
epidemic of S. flexneri 3a, in which it circulated and diversified
into three distinct variants; from there, one pKSR100 variant
moved into the major sublineage of S. flexneri 2a in 2012,
facilitating an epidemic of this sublineage; and another pKSR100
variant moved into (and back into) the three pKSR100-containing
S. sonnei MSMA sublineages (1, 2 and 4) (Fig. 4).
Discussion
In capturing the population-level epidemiological consequences
of horizontal AMR transmission we have revealed heretofore
unseen insights into AMR emergence and spread in important
pathogens.
Here,
horizontal transmission
of
AMR
among
pathogenic bacterial species caused fundamental epidemiological
shifts, including enhancing emerging epidemics and facilitating
epidemics of previously circulating pathogens that were waiting
for the ‘right’ AMR determinant to come along. These dramatic
shifts contrasted with the incremental increases in pathogens
carrying chromosomally encoded (vertically inherited) AMR, and
demonstrated how these two types of resistances (elaborated and
adapted to different populations in different geographical areas)
can combine to form new highly resistant sublineages. It is
important to consider that these overarching observations about
AMR emergence were made within a specific patient sub-
population known to have increased connectivity and anti-
microbial usage (in fact these features were almost certainly
prerequisite in our being able to make these observations).
However, the genomic processes in play here and their impact on
pathogen epidemiology are likely translatable to the broader
trends responsible for elaborating the global AMR crisis.
Of course, factors other than AMR, including changes in sexual
behaviour and population immunity, will have also shaped these
epidemics, and in truth the English MSM shigellosis epidemics
are all but gone for now31. However, there is a clear and valuable
lesson here for future AMR work. It is no longer enough to
understand and trace AMR pathogen combinations as simple
taxonomic compartments (e.g., azithromycin-resistant Shigella),
as the genomic diversity contained within such compartments,
and genetic exchange among them, also contributes to epide-
miological outcomes (particularly where resistance is horizontally
acquired). Clearly, we must continue to weave the sub-genomic
study of pathogens into all facets of AMR research, surveillance
and management, and work to determine the compartments,
barriers and quantity of gene flow among pathogenic and non-
pathogenic, as well as antimicrobial resistant and antimicrobial
susceptible bacterial species.
Methods
Demographic associations of MSMA sublineages. To infer association of sub-
lineages with MSM, the number of patients who were male, who had low-risk travel
histories, and who were between 16 and 60 years old were calculated (for each
category) and compared with those numbers among the entire (within species)
data set among the UK representative subsample. These proportions were then
compared using a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test (Supplementary Table 2). To
generate a single indicative figure of association (i.e., the figure in the results) the
same comparison was applied to the proportion of 16–60 years old male patients
without a history of recent high-risk travel in MSMA sublineages relative to the
entire UK representative subsample across species (i.e., 159 of 366 total and 96 of
103 among MSMA sublineage isolates).
Confirmation of sublineage designation as MSMA. To confirm our classification
of phylogenetic sublineages as being MSMA, epidemiological interview data from
patients whose isolates were submitted through Institut Pasteur were used to
explore the association between recent MSM activity and the phylogenetic classi-
fication of isolates. These data are being collected as part of a public health enquiry
into an ongoing outbreak of azithromycin-resistant shigellosis in France. Contact
details for male patients without a recent history of high-risk travel (i.e., travel to
Africa, Asia or Latin America), aged 16–60 years old were retrieved from clinical
laboratories and interviewed by telephone by a Santé Publique France epidemiol-
ogist (who was blinded to the phylogenetic classification of the patient’s isolate). Of
57 patients that fit these criteria, attempts were made to contact 34, and 13
interviews were successfully completed. Interviews comprised a standard ques-
tionnaire to retrospectively identify travel history and sexual exposure (sex with
male partner(s); sex with female partner(s); sex with both male and females partner
(s); no sex partners; unknown; refused to respond) in the month prior to diagnosis.
In total, 9 of 10 (90%) patients reporting recent MSM activity within the month
prior to diagnosis had isolates belonging to MSMA sublineages and 3 of 3 (100%)
patients not reporting such activity had isolates outside of these lineages. This
resulted in a significant association of recent patient MSM activity with isolates
belonging to MSMA lineages (p = 0.0140, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test).
Azithromycin-resistance determinants among MSMA sublineages. Contiguous
sequences were de novo assembled for each isolate using a custom pipeline32.
Azithromycin-resistance gene-containing contiguous sequences were identified
using Resfinder33. The length (in bp) of these contiguous sequences was extracted
and correlated with phylogenetic position to identify clusters sharing the same
azithromycin resistance determinant. Additional AMR genes co-inherited with the
azithromycin-resistance genes (Supplementary Data 1) were also used to identify
phylogenetic clusters sharing an azithromycin-resistance determinant. The longest
length azithromycin-resistance gene-carrying contiguous sequence from each of
the MSMA sublineages were compared using BLAST34 alongside pKSR100 from S.
flexneri 3a and the related plasmid R100 with visualisation using ACT35. Following
on from this, Single-Molecule-Real-Time sequencing was performed on 15 isolates,
representative from each Shigella sublineage as well as through different positions
in the pKSR100 phylogeny (results in Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary
Data 1). DNA was extracted using the MasterPure Complete DNA and RNA
extraction kit and sequenced on the Pacific Biosciences Sequel, and the data was
assembled as follows: assembly by HGAPv3;36 circularisation using Circlator
v1.1.3;37 and polishing by Quiver v1 (SMRT-analysis: a software suite for analysing
single-molecule, real-time DNA sequencing data, https://github.com/
PacificBiosciences/SMRT-Analysis). SMRT-sequenced AZM resistance determi-
nants were unavailable for two sublineage representatives as the S. sonnei sub-
lineage 1 representative failed to regrow for extraction, and on comparative genetic
analysis, the plasmid from S. sonnei sublineage 3 representative had been lost. In
the comparative genetic results for these sublineages (Supplementary Fig. 6) the
full-length contiguous sequences assembled from Illumina-sequencing are used
(and duly indicated).
Detection of pKSR100 among all isolates. In addition to the above, a combi-
nation of orthologue detection and mapping was used to infer pKSR100 presence
across all isolates. Core genome analysis (using roary ref. 38) of all UK repre-
sentative subsample isolates and the MSMA S. flexneri 3a sublineage was used to
identify the presence and count of 86 pKSR100 orthologues among isolates. Those
isolates containing ≥60 orthologues were mapped to a concatenated Shigella gen-
ome and pKSR100 pseudomolecule (as in ref. 19) and those with ≥90% coverage
over the pKSR100 region were deemed to contain pKSR100 (Supplementary
Data 1, Supplementary Fig. 3).
Genome-wide association analysis of MSMA sublineages. Sequence element
enrichment analysis was run on all 357 UK cross-sectional isolates with the 103
isolates belonging to MSMA sublineages being a binary phenotype. Assemblies
were generated using a pipeline32 and kmer counting (of kmers present in between
5 and 95% of isolates) was performed with fsm-lite39. Population structure esti-
mation was made using mash40 and converted into a three-dimensional distance
matrix using scripts inbuilt to SEER39. Associations of kmers were then run with
SEER and filtered for positive effect size; a minor allele frequency of >5%; an
unadjusted pvalue of <10e-5; and an adjusted pvalue of 10e-8. Filtered kmers were
then converted to fastq format, mapped to a draft assembly of an S. flexneri 2a
major sublineage isolate, converted to a Manhattan plot (again using SEER inbuilt
scripts) and visualised with Phandango41. This revealed a significant association of
MSMA sublineage designation with pKSR100 (Fig. 3). For comparison of the
association of sequence elements detected for pKSR100 and contiguous sequence
123, the positively correlated sequence elements mapping to each of contiguous
sequence 4 (pKSR100) and contiguous sequence 123 in the draft genome of isolate
ERR1364107 (shown in Fig. 3) were extracted were analysed as follows: the number
of sequence elements mapping to each contiguous sequence was divided by the

 total length of the contiguous sequence in bases was calculated to generate a
‘Positively correlated sequence elements per base’ figure; box plots were generated
of the negative logarithms of the adjusted p values of the sequence elements
mapping to each contiguous sequence; and the means of these data distributions
were compared using an unpaired (Welch) t-test (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Phenotyping of MSMA Shigella. To determine the phenotype conferred by the
various azithromycin-resistance plasmids detected in MSMA sublineages, the MIC
of 74 isolates from MSMA and non-MSMA sublineages were determined using
Etest strips (BioMérieux) and/or in-agar dilution using a frozen azithromycin
reference panel with concentrations ranging from 1 to 256 μg/ml. In-agar anti-
microbial susceptibility testing was performed according to Clinical Laboratory
Standards Institute methods, with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213/ NCTC
12973 used as a quality control strain42. For each isolate, a final inoculum of 5 ×
105 CFU/ml was targeted. Plates were read after 18 h of incubation at 35° ± °C.
Results in Supplementary Data 1 and summarised in Supplementary Table 3.
Plasmid similarity between E. coli and S. sonnei. An E. coli O117:H7 isolated in
2014 from the outbreak was sequenced using SMRT sequencing as above, and de
novo assembly was compared with azithromycin resistance encoding plasmids
from MSMA Shigella sublineages in this study. This showed that the S. sonnei
sublineage 3 plasmid was present in the E. coli outbreak isolate (Supplementary
Fig. 5).
Comparative phylogenetics of genome phylogenies with pKSR100. Com-
parative phylogenetics of pKSR100 with whole-genome phylogenies was conducted
within Dendroscope43. The whole-genome phylogenies were (from top to bottom):
a Bayesian-inferred phylogenetic tree of S. flexneri 3a based on 1243 variable sites
(from ref. 19); the tree presented in Fig. 1 for S. flexneri 2a and the S. sonnei whole-
genome phylogeny incorporating the MSMA clusters from the UK in 2015/16 (as
shown in Supplementary Fig. 1). The pKSR100 tree was constructed from isolates
that contained ≥60 pKSR100 orthologues and mapped to ≥90% of
pKSR100 sequence. Mapping and variant calling against pKSR100 (Genbank
accession: LN624486) as previously described19, was followed maximum likelihood
phylogenetic inference based on the resulting 110 variable sites using RAxML44.
The pKSR100 tree in Fig. 4 is rooted to allow visualisation of the HGT events
discussed in the text.
Temporal phylogenetic reconstruction. Multiple sequence alignments used to
generate the comparative phylogenetic trees for S. sonnei, S. flexneri 2a, were
analysed by Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) as in ref.
19 (three 50,000,000 length chains using the strict molecular clock and exponential
population model with a 10% burn-in) and median (Fig. 2) and 95% Highest
Posterior Densities (Supplementary Fig. 7) for MSMA and ciprofloxacin-resistant
sublineage most recent common ancestors were extracted.
