Background: This study aimed to evaluate anxiety and pain following perioperative music interventions
compared with control conditions in adult patients.
Methods: Eleven electronic databases were searched for full-text publications of RCTs investigating the
effect of music interventions on anxiety and pain during invasive surgery published between 1 January
1980 and 20 October 2016. Results and data were double-screened and extracted independently.
Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate effect sizes as standardized mean differences (MDs).
Heterogeneity was investigated in subgroup analyses and metaregression analyses. The review was
registered in the PROSPERO database as CRD42016024921.
Results: Ninety-two RCTs (7385 patients) were included in the systematic review, of which 81 were
included in the meta-analysis. Music interventions significantly decreased anxiety (MD –0⋅69, 95 per
cent c.i. –0⋅88 to –0⋅50; P < 0⋅001) and pain (MD –0⋅50, –0⋅66 to –0⋅34; P < 0⋅001) compared with
controls, equivalent to a decrease of 21 mm for anxiety and 10 mm for pain on a 100-mm visual analogue
scale. Changes in outcome corrected for baseline were even larger: MD –1⋅41 (–1⋅89 to –0⋅94; P < 0⋅001)
for anxiety and –0⋅54 (–0⋅93 to –0⋅15; P = 0⋅006) for pain. Music interventions provided during general
anaesthesia significantly decreased pain compared with that in controls (MD –0⋅41, –0⋅64 to –0⋅18;
P < 0⋅001). Metaregression analysis found no significant association between the effect of music inter-
ventions and age, sex, choice and timing of music, and type of anaesthesia. Risk of bias in the studies was
moderate to high.
Conclusion: Music interventions significantly reduce anxiety and pain in adult surgical patients.

Introduction
Worldwide, an estimated 266–360 million surgical proce-
dures are undertaken annually according to the WHO1.
Surgical patients often suffer from preoperative anxi-
ety and postoperative pain; recent data suggest that 75
per cent of patients facing surgery are anxious, despite
anxiety-decreasing measures2,
3. Preoperative anxiety can
increase the level of postoperative pain4 and, despite
interventions to reduce postoperative pain, approximately
40–65 per cent of patients experience moderate to severe
pain after surgery5,
6.
As the use of analgesics has inherent side-effects6,
music interventions have been suggested as a way to
reduce perioperative anxiety7,
8 and postoperative pain6,
9.
Despite a large number of studies, perioperative music
interventions are still not used widely. T
wo recently pub-
lished meta-analyses9,
10 on the effect of music interventions
in different hospital procedures, and of different forms
of perioperative art therapy, reported small to moderate
beneficial effects on anxiety and pain in surgical, but also
in non-surgical, patients. Research on music interven-
tions in healthcare often identifies heterogeneity in study
populations and lack of negative studies possibly owing
to publication bias. These factors may be the reason why
perioperative music interventions are not often applied in
clinical practice.
The purpose of the present study therefore was to per-
form a systematic review and meta-analysis of all RCT
s
evaluating the effects of music interventions on patients’
anxiety and pain before, during and after exclusively inva-
sive surgical procedures.

Methods
This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted
according to the PRISMA statement11. The review
was registered in the PROSPERO database (https://
www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/)
as
record
number
CRD42016024921.
Search strategy
A dedicated biomedical information specialist helped
define the search strategy. The electronic databases
Embase, MEDLINE, OvidSP, Web of Science, Scopus,
PsycINFO, OvidSP, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Regis-
ter of Controlled Trials, PubMed publisher and Google
Scholar were searched for publications on the effect of
music interventions before, during and after surgery
published between 1 January 1980 and 20 October 2016
(Appendix S1, supporting information).
Study selection
Titles and abstracts of articles identified by the search,
and full texts of those deemed potentially eligible, were
double-screened for relevance by four investigators inde-
pendently. Inclusion criteria for the systematic review were:
full-text article of an RCT; investigating effects of music
interventions on anxiety and/or pain; mean age of partici-
pants at least 18 years; written in English; invasive surgical
procedures, either open or laparoscopic, such as abdominal
surgery or total knee surgery; use of general anaesthesia,
regional anaesthesia or both; use of any recorded or live
music intervention having melody, harmony and rhythm;
intervention offered by a researcher or a music therapist;
and intervention performed in a hospital or outpatient
clinic. Studies involving non-invasive procedures such as
endoscopy were excluded, as were those using quasi- or
pseudo-randomization. Nature sounds were considered
only when they were used in addition to music. If popula-
tions overlapped between studies, only the most recent or
most complete study was included. Studies were included
in the meta-analysis only if they included measures of dis-
persion of a particular outcome. A fifth investigator was
consulted in the event of disagreement about inclusion of
an article.
Data extraction
Data were extracted and checked by three authors indepen-
dently. The following study characteristics were recorded:
author, year of publication, journal, number of patients,
sex ratio, mean age, inclusion period, mean follow-up,
ethical approval, outcome scale used, type of surgery, type
of anaesthesia, timing of the music intervention (before,
during or after surgery), recorded versus live music inter-
vention and description of intervention, and type of control
group. Primary outcomes were mean anxiety scores and
mean pain scores (including measures of dispersion) in the
intervention and control groups measured at baseline and
at the end of the study or within 7 days after operation.
When available, outcome data on change from baseline,
including measures of dispersion for both intervention and
control groups, were also extracted. If a study used mul-
tiple time points, only the first and final time points were
considered (at most 7 days after surgery).
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed using Review Manager version 5.3.5
(The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark).
Outcome measures were pooled using the inverse-variance
method in a random-effects model. Standardized mean
differences (MDs) were calculated with Hedges’adjusted
g using pooled weighted standard deviations. Effect sizes
were summarized with 95 per cent confidence intervals.
In five studies only an i.q.r. or range was provided; the
i.q.r. was divided by 1⋅3512 and the range by 4 to pro-
duce approximations of the standard deviation. Data were
summarized and presented visually in forest plots. Fun-
nel plots were constructed to investigate publication bias.
Heterogeneity among included studies was analysed with
both the Cochran Q statistic and the I2 index. Risk of
bias among studies was assessed by three reviewers using
the Cochrane Collaboration risk-of-bias assessment tool13.
T
wo-sided statistical significance was inferred at P < 0⋅050.
A metaregression analysis was conducted in Stata®
release 14 (StataCorp, College Station, T
exas, USA) to
investigate possible associations between study characteris-
tics and the effect of music. The following subgroups were
chosen a priori for subgroup analyses: timing of interven-
tion (before, during or after surgery); type of anaesthesia
(general or regional); type of music intervention (chosen
by investigator, chosen by patient from a list provided,
or patient’
s own music). During data collection, other
variables that could potentially influence the intervention
effect were added: single (only 1 intervention during the
course of the study) or multiple (several music interven-
tions during the course of the study) music interventions;
sex; and age. Multivariable metaregression analyses were
carried out first with all variables, and subsequently based
on the results of the subgroup analyses and univariable
metaregression analyses, including only variables that were
either statistically significant or had a β-coefficient larger
than the corresponding standard error.

Results
The literature search resulted in the inclusion of 92
RCT
s8,
15–105 in the systematic review (7385 patients).
Eighty-one of these were included in the meta-analysis
(Fig. 1). Details of study characteristics are presented in
Table S1 (supporting information).
The studies investigated music interventions in many
types of surgery and in different patient populations, with
a mean(s.d.) age of 51⋅7(10⋅4) years and predominance
of women (57 per cent). Most studies evaluating anxiety
outcomes used the STAI (55 per cent) and/or a VAS (43
per cent); the studies evaluating pain outcomes used a VAS
(79 per cent) and/or a numerical rating scale (21 per cent).
In the majority of studies (67 per cent on anxiety, 64 per
cent on pain) the effects of single interventions were inves-
tigated. Music interventions were offered before operation
(anxiety: 17, 26 per cent; pain: 3, 5 per cent), during surgery
(anxiety: 13, 20 per cent; pain: 13, 22 per cent), after opera-
tion (anxiety: 13, 20 per cent; pain: 21, 36 per cent), at mul-
tiple times (anxiety: 22, 33 per cent; pain: 21, 36 per cent)
or not specified (anxiety: 1, 2 per cent). Four studies (4 per
cent) investigated anxiety and/or pain-reducing effects of
live music therapy provided by a music therapist, whereas
all other studies used recorded music interventions. Con-
trol arms of studies provided standard medical care without
(28, 30 per cent) or with (11, 12 per cent) a resting period,
reported no music (13, 14 per cent), reported no inter-
vention (17, 18 per cent), used a device with sham sounds
(8, 9 per cent), provided headphones without music (6, 7

used midazolam (1, 1 per cent) or had an unclear descrip-
tion (5, 5 per cent). Eleven RCT
s15–25 (12 per cent) did
not report on quantitative data and could not therefore be
included in the quantitative analyses (Table S1, supporting
information).
Risk-of-bias assessment
The included studies had a moderate to high risk of bias
(Fig. S1, supporting information). As blinding of patients
to music interventions during surgery is only feasible under
general anaesthesia, the assessment was limited to blinding
of personnel involved in patient care. All included studies
reported the use of randomization, but studies that did not
report specific methods of sequence generation or alloca-
tion concealment were assessed as having an unclear risk
of selection bias. Few studies reported on attrition bias (43,
47 per cent), blinding of data collectors (33, 36 per cent),
reporting bias (16, 17 per cent) and other bias (4, 4 per
cent); in most studies, therefore, a majority of bias regard-
ing these variables was unclear. Inspection of funnel plots
for the presence of publication bias revealed a tendency
towards asymmetry in the funnel plot for anxiety, but not
in that for pain (Figs S2 and S3, supporting information).

Pooling of the different outcome measures of pain
resulted in a statistically significant MD of –0⋅50 (–0⋅66

interventions in reducing pain. Pooling of the data on
mean change between postoperative outcomes and preop-
erative baseline measurements in pain scores (9 studies)
yielded a MD of –0⋅54 (–0⋅93 to –0⋅15; P = 0⋅006) (Table 1

T
o facilitate clinical interpretation, effect sizes from the
main analyses were back-transformed, demonstrating that
music interventions led to a mean 6⋅3-point decrease on the
20–80-scale of the STAI and a mean 21-mm decrease on a
100-mm VAS for anxiety, and to a mean 10-mm decrease
on a 100-mm VAS for pain.
Subgroup analyses
Subgroup meta-analyses showed that music interventions
before, during and after surgery all led to a reduction in
anxiety, with the largest effect seen when offered before
surgery (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Postoperative interventions
had the largest effect in decreasing pain (Table 1 and
Fig. 3). Pooled analysis of the five studies75,

pain was found in the data-driven multivariable regression
analysis of this outcome. None of the other explanatory
variables were significant, and no evidence was found for an
association between any of the other variables and anxiety
or pain.
Discussion
This meta-analysis found a statistically significant decrease
in both anxiety and pain in adults receiving music interven-
tions before, during or after surgery. The effect on anxiety
seemed largest when the music intervention was offered
before operation; however, music interventions offered
during and after surgery also significantly reduced anxi-
ety. Postoperative music interventions were most likely to
reduce pain; a significant pain-reducing effect of preopera-
tive music was also seen in the data-driven multivariable
regression analysis. As preoperative anxiety is associated
with postoperative pain4, pain reduction noted after preop-
erative music interventions might be the result of decreased
anxiety. In the present meta-analysis, the mean changes in
anxiety and pain from baseline values showed even larger
anxiety- and pain-reducing effects of music than did the
direct comparison of postintervention outcomes. Previous
meta-analyses that investigated music interventions also
included other interventions10, or other procedures that
did not involve surgery9. Moreover, they included fewer
RCT
s. The results presented here underline and reinforce
the findings of other studies7,
9,
10,
106. The more specific
inclusion criteria in the present meta-analysis, which inves-
tigated music interventions alone in exclusively surgical
populations, emphasize the effect of the intervention, and
make it more applicable in practice. The analysis of mean
changes in scores between intervention and control situ-
ations, with outcome scores corrected for baseline values,
reveals the true effect of the intervention more than pre-
vious studies have shown, and should encourage its imple-
mentation in surgery.
An important finding is that many different music inter-
ventions each have positive effects. Although most of the
music interventions used in the studies were bound by
restrictions, such as slow, soft, relaxing music (Table S1,
supporting information), the effect does not seem to be
related to one specific type of music. Moreover, it has
been suggested that individual music preference is impor-
tant to the effect of a music intervention54. Effect sizes
in the present study were slightly higher when patients
chose music from a list provided. The small number of
studies that investigated freely chosen music compared
with music selected by the investigator and preselected
music makes it hard to draw definite conclusions about
the importance of individual preferences. Besides indi-
vidual music preference, specific features of the music
intervention such as rhythm and harmony, and the use
of specific instruments like string instruments, also seem
important features in anxiety and pain reduction107. A
placebo effect cannot be ruled out as the studies relied
on self-reporting. It could be argued that a placebo effect
is beneficial anyway108, in this instance reducing anxiety
and pain. However, the subgroup analysis of perioperative
music interventions during general anaesthesia did show a

statistically significant pain-reducing effect. Factors such as
distraction strategies and interference from personnel and
observers do not play a role when patients are under gen-
eral anaesthesia75,
81,
84, nor do the psychological effects of
listening to music. These considerations militate against a
mere placebo effect.
Overall, risk of bias in the included studies was mod-
erate to high. Many studies did not adequately address
methodological
considerations
(randomization
tech-
niques and power) and risk of bias, and were therefore
scored as having an unclear risk. In randomized trials
of non-pharmacological treatments, it may be difficult to
blind the relevant parties and to exclude the influence of the
provider’
s expertise109. Although the nature of music inter-
ventions makes it hard to perform double-blinded studies,
suitable randomization and reporting following the CON-
SORT checklist for non-pharmacological trials110 could
help minimize the risk of bias in future trials. No clear asso-
ciation was found for any explanatory variable in either sub-
group analyses or univariable metaregression analyses. A
statistically significant association was found between pre-
operative music interventions and pain in the data-driven
multivariable regression analysis. However, the absence of
this effect in the subgroup meta-analysis, the small number
of studies investigating the effect of preoperative music
interventions on pain, and the possible issue of multiple
testing make the reproducibility of this result questionable.
This study has strengths and limitations. A dedicated
biomedical information specialist was consulted to identify
all publications on this subject in the scientific literature.
Bias was limited by excluding studies that generated ran-
domization sequences inadequately. The present review is,
however, limited by the overall high level of heterogene-
ity. Even though the search was limited to surgical patients,
there is a wide variety of surgical procedures in the study
population, with diverse methods of anaesthesia. These
issues in part explain the large degree of heterogeneity.
Moreover, the diverse control conditions also create variety
in study populations. Publications might have been missed
as a result of the language restriction (Fig. 1). The funnel
plot for anxiety raises the possibility of publication bias.
Previous publications of mainly favourable results might
affect the conclusion of this review.
This review provides evidence for the implementation
of music interventions before, during and after surgery.
Preoperative anxiety and postoperative pain are clinically
relevant issues that may determine morbidity, duration of
hospital stay and even mortality2. Alleviating these fac-
tors may improve clinical outcomes and quality of life,
may also lead to earlier discharge from hospital, and thus
may help to reduce healthcare costs111. Pain relief after
surgery continues to be an important medical challenge112
and it has been shown that a minimum 12 (95 per cent
c.i. 9 to 15)-mm reduction in VAS pain score signifies
clinical relevance113. Based on this, at least some of the
patients in the music intervention groups included in
this meta-analysis experienced a clinically relevant reduc-
tion in pain. Defining minimally importantdifferences to
determine clinically relevant effects is challenging114. No
clear minimally important differences for anxiety have
been defined; however, minimally important differences
for depression have previously been inferred at an MD of
0⋅50, and an MD of 0⋅24 has also been reported114. The
pooled MD of –0⋅69 for anxiety reported in the present
analysis therefore appears clinically relevant. Some of the
included studies have also investigated other parameters to
evaluate the efficacy of music interventions. Music has, for
instance, been shown to reduce the use of analgesics after
surgery24,
35,
39,
60,
76,
82, and was more effective in reducing
preoperative anxiety than orally administered midazolam8.
More foot movement and a reduction in the rate of delir-
ium was found following music interventions after hip and
knee surgery in elderly patients69. Furthermore, duration
of hospital stay after mastectomy was shorter for patients
receiving music interventions compared with controls102.
