IMPORTANCE Acute lower respiratory tract infection is common and often treated
inappropriately in primary care with antibiotics. Corticosteroids are increasingly used but
without sufficient evidence.
OBJECTIVE To assess the effects of oral corticosteroids for acute lower respiratory tract
infection in adults without asthma.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized trial
(July 2013 to final follow-up October 2014) conducted in 54 family practices in England
among 401 adults with acute cough and at least 1 lower respiratory tract symptom not
requiring immediate antibiotic treatment and with no history of chronic pulmonary disease or
use of asthma medication in the past 5 years.
INTERVENTIONS Two 20-mg prednisolone tablets (n = 199) or matched placebo (n = 202)
once daily for 5 days.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were duration of moderately bad or
worse cough (0 to 28 days; minimal clinically important difference, 3.79 days) and mean
severity of symptoms on days 2 to 4 (scored from 0 [not affected] to 6 [as bad as it could be];
minimal clinically important difference, 1.66 units). Secondary outcomes were duration and
severity of acute lower respiratory tract infection symptoms, duration of abnormal peak flow,
antibiotic use, and adverse events.
RESULTS Among 401 randomized patients, 2 withdrew immediately after randomization, and
1 duplicate patient was identified. Among the 398 patients with baseline data (mean age, 47
[SD, 16.0] years; 63% women; 17% smokers; 77% phlegm; 70% shortness of breath; 47%
wheezing; 46% chest pain; 42% abnormal peak flow), 334 (84%) provided cough duration
and 369 (93%) symptom severity data. Median cough duration was 5 days (interquartile
range [IQR], 3-8 days) in the prednisolone group and 5 days (IQR, 3-10 days) in the placebo
group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.89-1.39; P = .36 at an α = .05). Mean symptom
severity was 1.99 points in the prednisolone group and 2.16 points in the placebo group
(adjusted difference, −0.20; 95% CI, −0.40 to 0.00; P = .05 at an α = .001). No significant
treatment effects were observed for duration or severity of other acute lower respiratory
tract infection symptoms, duration of abnormal peak flow, antibiotic use, or nonserious
adverse events. There were no serious adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Oral corticosteroids should not be used for acute lower
respiratory tract infection symptoms in adults without asthma because they do not reduce
symptom duration or severity.

 A
cutelowerrespiratorytractinfection,definedasanacute
cough with at least 1 of the symptoms of sputum, chest
pain,shortnessofbreath,andwheeze,1isoneofthemost
common conditions managed in primary care internationally.
In 2009-2011, an estimated 65% to 75%2,3 of patients were pre-
scribed antibiotics despite good evidence that they do not re-
duce symptom duration or severity4 and guidelines to the
contrary.1 Annual antibiotic prescribing costs are estimated at
US $726 million in the United States5 and US $300 million for
consultations and antibiotics in the United Kingdom.6
Antimicrobialresistanceisoneofthegreatestchallengesto
modern public health.7 Primary care is responsible for 80% of
health service antibiotic prescribing,2,8 with a high proportion
regarded as unnecessary2 and contributing to antimicrobial
resistance.9 Both US10 and UK11 national antimicrobial resis-
tance action plans recommend finding alternatives to antibiot-
ics,butnoneiscurrentlyprovenforacutelowerrespiratorytract
infection in adults.
Symptomsofacutelowerrespiratorytractinfectionaresimi-
lartothoseofexacerbatedasthma.12Bronchialepithelialchanges
are similar in people with and without asthma during a respi-
ratory tract infection, with both groups showing reductions in
forcedexpiratoryvolumeandairwaysinflammation,12andpro-
longed acute lower respiratory tract infection symptoms are
thoughttobeduetobronchialhyperresponsiveness.13Oraland
inhaledcorticosteroidsarehighlyeffectiveforacuteasthma,but
US, British, and European guidelines do not provide guidance
on whether corticosteroids should be used for acute lower re-
spiratory tract infection. Despite this, US and European clini-
cians are increasingly using oral and inhaled steroids, with 1 US
study14 reporting oral prednisolone use in 15% of adults with-
out asthma with acute lower respiratory tract infection.
A previous systematic review15 found insufficient evi-
dence regarding the role of inhaled corticosteroids and found
no oral corticosteroid studies for acute lower respiratory tract
infection. The aim of the current study was to investigate the
effectsofamoderatedoseoforalcorticosteroidsinadultswith-
out asthma presenting to primary care with acute lower respi-
ratory tract infection.
Methods
Study Design, Recruitment, and Baseline Assessment
EthicalapprovalforthisstudywasgrantedbytheCentralBristol
Research Ethics Committee (12/SW/0180) and all patients gave
written informed consent. The Oral Steroids for Acute Cough
(OSAC) trial was a multicenter, placebo-controlled, individu-
ally randomized study conducted between July 2013 and Octo-
ber 2014. Family physicians and nurses (recruiting clinicians)
were trained in study procedures by 4 centers at the Universi-
tiesofBristol,Southampton,Nottingham,andOxford.Theywere
asked to assess eligibility in consecutive patients: age 18 years
orolderandpresentingforanacute(≤28days)coughasthemain
symptom with at least 1 lower respiratory tract symptom
(phlegm,chestpain,wheezing,orshortnessofbreath)inthepre-
vious24hours.Patientswereexcludediftheywereclinicallysus-
pected to have or their medical records showed evidence of
chronic pulmonary disease; had received any asthma medica-
tion in the past 5 years; met National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence criteria for severe infection/complications1;
requiredsame-dayhospitaladmission;orrequiredsamedayan-
tibiotics (see Supplement 1 for full list). Participants were re-
cruited on the day of or the day following presentation. Follow-
ing consent, demographic and clinical data were collected,
including self-reported ethnicity using UK-approved16 catego-
ries, to assess sample representativeness.
Randomization and Concealment
The treatment allocation schedule was computer generated by
a statistician independent of the trial team. Randomization to
prednisolone or placebo in a 1:1 ratio used a variable block size
(4, 6, 8, and 10) and was stratified by center. Allocated medi-
cation was added to numbered participant packs by pharma-
cistsindependentoftheteam.Allpackswereidenticalandcen-
ters distributed 4 packs at a time to family practices. Following
eligibility confirmation, participants were given the next pack.
Intervention and Masking
Participant packs contained either ten 20-mg oral predniso-
lone tablets (Galen Pharma GmbH) or placebo tablets matched
on dimension, appearance, and taste (Piramal Healthcare Ltd).
Participants were asked to take 2 tablets once daily for 5 days,
starting on the day of consultation, if possible before starting
any antibiotics (if receiving a “delayed” prescription). The dose
and duration of prednisolone was selected to reflect the dose
and duration known to be effective for acute asthma.17 Par-
ticipants, recruiting clinicians, and the trial team were masked
to treatment allocation until data analyses were complete.
Follow-up
Participants were invited to report (using web or paper ver-
sions)thepresenceandseverityofsymptomsusingavalidated18
diaryshowntobesensitivetochange.4,19Symptomsweremea-
sured using a scale from 0 (no problem) to 3 (moderately bad)
and up to 6 (as bad as it could be). All symptoms were mea-
sured daily, with twice-daily peak expiratory flow, for 28 days
or until symptom resolution. Cough was measured for a fur-
ther 28 days in case of late treatment effects. A research nurse
telephoned participants weekly to support symptom diary
Key Points
Question Does a moderate dose of oral corticosteroid reduce
the duration or severity of acute lower respiratory tract infection
in adults without asthma presenting to primary care?
Findings In this randomized trial of 401 adults with symptoms of
acute lower respiratory tract infection, treatment with oral
prednisolone, 40 mg/d for 5 days, compared with placebo did not
significantly reduce the median duration of moderately bad or
worse cough (5 days in each group) or the mean severity of
symptoms between days 2 and 4 (1.99 vs 2.16 points out of 6).
Meaning These findings do not support the use of oral steroids
for the treatment of acute lower respiratory tract infection in the
absence of asthma.

months for new diagnoses of asthma, chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease, whooping cough, and lung cancer.

Sample Size Calculation
The distributions of both primary outcomes were expected to
bepositivelyskewed;hence,samplesizecalculationswerebased
on the log-normal distribution. The mean durations of moder-
atelybadorworsecoughandsymptomsseverityscore(days2-4)
were estimated to be 5.8 (SD, 4.1) days and 2.3 (SD, 1.1) points,
respectively.19 This corresponds to 1.56 (SD, 0.64) log days (or
ageometricmeanof4.74days)forcoughdurationand0.73(SD,
0.45) points on the log scale (or a geometric mean of 2.08) for
severity of symptoms. Because there were no previous studies
oforalsteroidstoinformtheminimumclinicallyimportantdif-
ferenceinbothoutcomes,theinvestigativeteamconsideredthe
balance of potential benefits and adverse effects and reached a
minimumclinicallyimportantdifferenceconsensusof20%,cor-
responding to a geometric mean in the active treatment group
of3.79days(mean,1.33logdays)fordurationofcoughand1.66
points (mean, 0.51 log points) for severity of symptoms. Allow-
ing for 20% attrition, 218 participants needed to be random-
izedpergrouptoretain174atfollow-upandachieve90%power
witha2-sidedα = .05forprimaryoutcomeone.Afinalachieved
sample size of 174 participants per group would provide 89%
power to detect a 20% reduction in severity of symptoms, with
an adjusted 2-sided α = .001 to reflect the second primary out-
come status (Supplement 1).
Statistical Analyses
A prespecified analysis plan was approved by the trial steer-
ing and data monitoring committees and the study protocol
waspublishedbeforedatacollectionhadfinished(Supplement
2). Changes that were made to the statistical analysis plan af-
ter the analysis was begun are also described in Supplement
2.AllanalyseswereperformedinStatasoftware,version13.1.20
The primary comparative analyses considered patients in
the groups to which they were randomized, without imputa-
tion for missing outcome data. These analyses were adjusted
forcenter(Bristol,Nottingham,Oxford,andSouthampton)and
therelevantbaselinemeasure(priorcoughduration[1-28days]
for duration of moderately bad or worse cough and patient-
reported illness severity in last 24 hours for severity of symp-
toms [0 = completely well; 10 = extremely unwell]). Time-to-
eventmethodswereusedtoanalyzethedurationofmoderately
bad or worse cough. Semiparametric Cox proportional hazard
models were used (to enable comparison with previous stud-
ies) and the assumption of proportional hazards checked by vi-
sual inspection of log-log survival curves and calculation of
Schoenfeldresiduals.21Hazardratioswerereportedcomparing
theinstantaneousrateofresolutionofcoughbetweenthepred-
nisoloneandplacebogroups,with95%confidenceintervalsand
Pvalues.Toassistinterpretationagainsttheminimumclinically
important difference of a 20% reduction in time to resolution,
for which hazard ratios are unhelpful, parametric Weibull ac-
celerated failure time models were used to present cough du-
ration treatment effects as time ratios. Such models can be for-
mulated as proportional hazards or accelerated failure time
models; hence, hazard ratios were also produced from the
Weibull models to ensure comparability with the Cox models.
To further aid interpretation, we calculated absolute mea-
sures of effect for the primary outcome of duration of moder-
ately bad or worse cough. There is no single absolute mea-
sureoftreatmenteffectfortime-to-eventdatabecauseitvaries
over the duration of follow-up; it can, however, be calculated
at a specific time point. Of particular clinical interest is day 7,
because this is a time in the illness trajectory when clinicians
and patients want to know about expected benefits, and when
steroids should have affected symptoms if effective. Survival
curves were produced from the Cox regressions at given val-
ues of center (Bristol) and duration of prior cough (median
value). Predicted survival probabilities at day 7 in the pred-
nisolone and placebo groups were obtained and an absolute

proposed by Altman and Andersen.22
Mean severity score from days 2 to 4 was considered in lin-
ear regression models. Models considered mean severity score
andlogmeanseverityscore,anddistributionalchecksofresidu-
als were undertaken to determine the most appropriate model.
Differences between the prednisolone and placebo groups are
reported with 95% confidence intervals and P values.
For both primary outcomes, secondary analyses addition-
ally adjusted for factors demonstrating imbalance at baseline
(difference >5% for binary and >0.5 SD for continuous out-
comes) and for smoking because it is known to be prognosti-
cally important.15

 the prednisolone group was slightly more likely to be male, be
older (and hence retired), and have received an influenza vac-
cine in the last 12 months (Table 1).
Primary Outcome Data Completeness
Symptom diaries were returned by 374 participants (94%; 192
in the prednisolone group and 182 in the placebo group). For
duration of moderately bad or worse cough, data were avail-
able for 334 participants (84%), with 40 reporting an initial
cough severity of less than 3 points (that is, not moderately bad
or worse) and 24 lost to follow-up. For severity of symptoms,
follow-up data were available in 370 (93%). However, 1 par-
ticipant in the prednisolone group had no baseline measure
of illness severity and this participant’
s data could not be used

Primary Analyses
Moderately Bad or Worse Cough Duration
The median duration of moderately bad or worse cough was 5
days(interquartilerange,3-8days)intheprednisolonegroupand
5 days (interquartile range, 3-10 days) in the placebo group
(Table 2). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were similar for both
groups(Figure2).Visualinspectionofthelog-logsurvivalcurves
andcalculationoftheSchoenfeldresiduals(P = .52)providedno

with placebo, the Cox model adjusting for center and baseline
cough duration resulted in a hazard ratio of 1.11 (95% CI, 0.89-
1.39;P = .36withα = .05).Thehazardratiorepresentstheinstan-
taneous risk of resolution from moderately bad or worse cough
in the prednisolone group compared with placebo; a hazard ra-
tio greater than 1 demonstrates a beneficial effect of predniso-

Severity of Symptoms on Days 2 to 4
Mean symptoms severity scores (and residuals) were normally
distributed. The mean symptoms severity scores were 1.99 (SD,
0.99)and2.16(SD,1.09)pointsfortheprednisoloneandplacebo
groups,respectively.Adjustingforcenterandbaselineillnessse-
verity, the mean symptoms severity difference was 0.20 point
(95% CI, −0.40 to 0.00 point; P = .05 with a priori α = .001) be-
tween prednisolone and placebo (Table 2). With a mean symp-
toms severity score of 2.16 in the placebo group, a difference of
0.20 equates to a relative reduction of 9.3%. The lower limit of
the 95% CI of this reduction was 18.5% and excluded the 20% a
priori minimum clinically important difference. Additional ad-
justment for factors demonstrating imbalance at baseline and
smoking marginally attenuated the difference in means and re-
duced the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis
(Table 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
None of the sensitivity analyses had any effect on the pri-
mary comparisons, including those with no moderately bad
or worse cough at baseline, multiple imputation of missing
data, per-protocol analysis, and adjusting for day of recruit-
ment (eTable 1 in Supplement 1).
Secondary Outcomes
There were no significant effects on any symptom duration or
peakflowupto28daysorcoughdurationupto56days(Table4).
No significant effects were observed for antibiotic use; patient
satisfaction or intention to use the same treatment if it were to
be available in the future; nonserious adverse events (Table 4);
expected, unexpected, or cough-related adverse events; or re-
consultations (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). The nature of the ad-
verse events was similar between the groups (eTable 3 in
Supplement 1), no new urinary or visual symptoms were re-
ported,andnoneofthepatientsreportingfatigue,thirst,ordry
throat (eTable 3 in Supplement 1) had diabetes. There were no
serious adverse events. Four participants (3 in the predniso-
lone group and 1 in the placebo group presented to the emer-
gency department but were not hospitalized.
Subgroup Analyses
All 95% confidence intervals for the interaction effects in-
cluded values consistent with no significant subgroup effect
(eTable 4 in Supplement 1).

A negative value for the absolute risk difference indicates that a smaller
percentage of participants in the prednisolone group have unresolved cough
or abnormal peak flow at end of day 7 than participants in the placebo group.
For time-to-event outcomes, adjusted analyses consider an “average” value of
covariates: center = Bristol (where 60% of participants were recruited) and
prior duration of cough = 12 days (median value in sample).

delayed antibiotic prescription at baseline (yes or no). No baseline measures
were available for patient satisfaction or taking tablets in the future.

a Baseline measure for cough area under the curve, duration of moderately bad
or worse cough (56 days), any cough (56 days), and abnormal peak flow
is prior duration of cough (days); for all symptoms (area under the curve)
(with the exception of cough), baseline measure is presence or absence of
symptom at baseline (previous 24 hours); and for antibiotic use, baseline
measure is whether participant was given delayed antibiotic prescription
(yes or no). No baseline measures were available for patient satisfaction,
taking tablets in the future, or adverse events.
bFor derivation of symptom area under the curve, see the eAppendix in
Supplement 1.25 Area-under-the-curve analysis includes 185 in the

 more than doubles the number of patients recruited to pri-
mary care trials of corticosteroids for acute lower respiratory
tract infection15 and, to our knowledge, is the first to investi-
gate the effects of oral rather than inhaled steroids. The trial
also contributes to a growing body of evidence suggesting that
systemic and topical corticosteroids have a limited role in the
treatment of common infections and their postinfectious
complications in primary care.26,27 This contrasts with an
increasing number of studies suggesting that corticosteroids
are effective for secondary-care patients with community-
acquired pneumonia,28 croup,29 acute sinusitis,30 and severe
sore throat.31
This study also has several limitations. First, the low
patient recruitment rate suggests that patients may have
been selectively invited to participate, affecting the general-
izability of the final sample. However, the rate was higher
than a similar previous trial,19 not all practices were active
throughout the recruitment period, and the characteristics of
the final sample appears representative of primary care adult
patients with acute lower respiratory tract infection. Second,
there was a higher than expected number of participants
with zero duration of moderately bad or worse cough,
although a sensitivity analysis including these participants
did not influence the results. Third, other baseline biomark-
ers (eg, inflammatory, microbiological, spirometric, or radio-
graphic) were not measured, and it is possible that patients
with more severe, inflammatory, eosinophilic,32,33 or micro-
biological (eg, rhinovirus)34 etiology entered the trial or could
have differentially benefited. However, the study used read-
ily recognized, pragmatic entry criteria facilitating replication
in routine clinical practice. Fourth, study eligibility criteria
might have included some patients with chronic or postinfec-
tious cough rather than acute lower respiratory tract infec-
tion. However, 100% of participants had evidence of active
lower respiratory tract involvement (sputum, shortness of
breath, wheeze, or chest pain) and more than 75% had a pre-
consultation cough duration of less than 21 days. Fifth, the
study used a patient-reported outcome rather than an objec-
tive primary outcome measure (such as digitally measured
cough severity). This was chosen because it was considered
the strongest option in the presence of a fully masked inter-
vention, it closely reflected patient priorities, and it allowed
comparison with other trials.4,19 Sixth, the lack of effects and
a similar between-group pattern of adverse events could
reflect poor adherence. However, this is unlikely because
standard methods35 were used to establish similar and high
levels of adherence to both prednisolone and placebo, and
adverse events were similar to another trial in which a similar
dosage of prednisolone was proven effective.35
This trial suggests that oral corticosteroids should not be
used in adult primary care patients without asthma or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease who do not require treatment
with an immediate antibiotic. Further research is needed to
establish effectiveness in primary care patients with more se-
vere infections, such as those with elevated C-reactive pro-
tein levels or requiring immediate antibiotic treatment, and
larger studies or meta-analysis are needed to address effects
in subgroups, such as those with longer preconsultation ill-
ness and nonsmokers.15
Conclusions
Among adults without asthma who developed acute lower re-
spiratory tract infection, the use of oral prednisolone for 5 days
did not reduce symptom duration or severity. These findings
do not support oral steroids for treatment of acute lower re-
spiratory tract infection in the absence of asthma.
