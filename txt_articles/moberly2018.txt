Conflict between goals (inter-goal conflict) and conflicting feelings about attaining particular goals (ambivalence)
are believed to be associated with depressive and anxious symptoms, but have rarely been investigated together.
Kelly et al. (2011, Personality and Individual Differences, 50, 531-534) reported that inter-goal conflict interacted
with ambivalence to predict concurrent depressive symptoms in undergraduates, with ambivalence being more
strongly associated with depressive symptoms for persons reporting less inter-goal conflict. We sought to re-
plicate and extend this finding in a larger sample, using separate measures of inter-goal conflict and facilitation,
and a longitudinal follow-up. Undergraduates (N = 210) rated their goal strivings for ambivalence, inter-goal
conflict and facilitation, and completed measures of depressive and anxious symptoms that were repeated after
one month. Inter-goal conflict (but not facilitation) and ambivalence were both uniquely positively associated
with depressive and anxious symptoms concurrently, but did not predict symptom change. Inter-goal conflict
and ambivalence did not interact to predict concurrent symptoms, but inter-goal conflict was associated with
greater reductions in anxious symptoms for people reporting low ambivalence. Findings suggest that different
forms of motivational conflict across the goal hierarchy are associated with symptoms, but do not exacerbate
symptoms over time.
1. Introduction
Making progress on personal goals imbues life with meaning and
contributes to well-being (Brunstein, 1993; Klinger, 1977; Klug &
Maier, 2015), so it is unsurprising that goal conflict has long been
considered to be associated with psychological distress (Higginson,
Mansell, & Wood, 2011). This article examines how two different forms
of conflict (inter-goal conflict and goal ambivalence) contribute to an-
xious and depressive symptoms.
A person experiences inter-goal conflict when one of their goals
makes it more difficult to pursue their other goals (Emmons, 1986;
Riediger & Freund, 2004). For example, a person's goal to ‘spend more
time with my family’ may conflict with their goal to “get promoted at
work”. Conversely, a person may experience inter-goal facilitation if one
of their goals makes it easier to pursue their other goals (e.g., “spend
more time with family” may facilitate the goal to “deepen my re-
lationships”). Inter-goal conflict is associated with negative affect and
lower life satisfaction (Emmons, 1986) and more psychiatric symptoms
among undergraduates (Perring, Oatley, & Smith, 1988) and adoles-
cents (Dickson & Moberly, 2010). However, some studies using
undergraduate samples have not found associations between inter-goal
conflict and depressive (Emmons & King, 1988, Study 2; King, Richards,
& Stemmerich, 1998; Segerstrom & Solberg Nes, 2006) or anxious
symptoms (Emmons & King, 1988, Study 2). In community samples, no
significant correlations emerged between inter-goal conflict and de-
pressive symptoms (Wallenius, 2000) or negative affect (Kehr, 2003;
Romero, Villar, Luengo, & Gómez-Fraguela, 2009). Equivocal results
may reflect the use of bipolar measures that conflate inter-goal facil-
itation and conflict. Riediger and Freund (2004) found that unipolar
measures of inter-goal conflict and facilitation loaded on distinct fac-
tors, with only inter-goal conflict being significantly associated with
negative affect at the between- and within-person level. Boudreaux and
Ozer (2013) found that inter-goal conflict, but not inter-goal facilita-
tion, was positively correlated with anxiety and negative affect in un-
dergraduates; the correlation with depressive symptoms was not sig-
nificant. In their meta-analysis, Gray, Ozer, and Rosenthal (2017)
revealed that goal conflict was positively associated with psychological
distress (weighted effect size: r = 0.34), with studies using unipolar
scales yielding larger effect sizes.

T
 competition among goals for a shared limited resource (e.g., time or
money) rather than inherently incompatible outcomes (Riediger &
Freund, 2004; Segerstrom & Solberg Nes, 2006). However, conflicted
motives about attaining specific goals, i.e., ambivalence (Bleuler, 1911;
Sincoff, 1990), may illustrate more profound motivational conflict that
is more strongly associated with psychological symptoms. Goal am-
bivalence has been conceptualised as an approach-avoidance conflict
about the pursuit of a particular goal (Emmons, King, & Sheldon, 1993)
that is generated by conflict between relevant goals at a higher level in
the goal hierarchy (Kelly, Mansell, & Wood, 2015). For example, a
student may feel ambivalent about an essay-writing goal because it is
relevant to a higher-level goal conflict between excelling academically
and maintaining interpersonal relationships. Higher-level goal conflict
may be more irresolvable because such goals are self-defining (Powers,
1973).
Goal ambivalence has indeed been found to be associated with an-
xious and depressive symptoms among undergraduates (Emmons,
1986; Emmons & King, 1988; King et al., 1998; but see Romero et al.,
2009, for null results). Other research has examined the association
between psychological symptoms and ambivalence about goals relevant
to particular life stages. For pregnant women, ambivalence about
childbirth was associated with concurrent depressive symptoms and
increasing
symptoms
post-partum
(Koletzko,
La
Marca-
Ghaemmaghami, & Brandstätter, 2015). In another sample, daily fluc-
tuation in ambivalence about having the child was associated with
negative affect. In another study, ambivalence about attaining a degree
was associated with lower life satisfaction both concurrently and
longitudinally (Koletzko, Herrmann, & Brandstätter, 2015).
Inter-goal conflict and ambivalence may overlap because people
will often feel ambivalent about conflicting goals (Emmons & King,
1988). Indeed, modest positive correlations have been reported be-
tween goal ambivalence and inter-goal conflict at the within-person
level (Emmons, 1986; King et al., 1998), if not at the between-person
level. Few studies have examined whether inter-goal conflict and am-
bivalence have independent or interactive associations with symptoms
(Kelly et al., 2015). Although Emmons (1986) found that ambivalence
but not inter-goal conflict explained unique variance in psychological
symptoms, this study was underpowered.
Kelly et al. (2011) reported that goal ambivalence was positively
associated with concurrent depressive and anxious symptoms, whereas
inter-goal conflict did not predict significant additional variance.
Moreover, these forms of conflict interacted such that ambivalence was
more strongly associated with depressive symptoms for participants
reporting less inter-goal conflict. The authors speculated that ambiva-
lence may be more distressing if it is not attributable to the pursuit of
conflicting lower-level goals, suggesting that the ambivalence is gen-
erated by higher-level goal conflict. A person who strives to run
marathons and learn guitar may report inter-goal conflict due to limited
leisure time, but may experience no ambivalence if these pursuits are
consistent with higher-level goals (Kelly et al., 2015). Conversely, a
person who strives to care for the vulnerable and provide childcare may
report no inter-goal conflict, but may experience ambivalence if these
pursuits conflict with a higher-order goal of being independent. A
combination of low inter-goal conflict and high ambivalence may in-
dicate a distressing lack of integration across levels of the goal hier-
archy. However, Kelly et al.’s (2011) result requires replication, and it is
unclear whether the relationship between ambivalence and depressive
symptoms is moderated by lower levels of inter-goal facilitation and/or
higher levels of inter-goal conflict.
To further illuminate the unique and interactive relationship be-
tween inter-goal conflict, ambivalence and psychological distress, we
extended Kelly et al.’s (2011) research using a larger sample and dis-
tinct measures of inter-goal conflict and facilitation (Riediger & Freund,
2004). We also examined whether inter-goal conflict, goal ambivalence
and their interaction would predict symptom change over one month,
consistent with the notion that inter-goal conflict actively contributes to
psychological distress. Boudreaux and Ozer (2013) found that inter-
goal conflict predicted increases in depressive and anxious symptoms
over five weeks in undergraduates. Similarly, Koletzko, La Marca-
Ghaemmaghami, and Brandstätter (2015) found that ambivalence
about having a child in women was associated with worsening de-
pressive symptoms after birth.
Based on the notion that conflict is deleterious at all levels of the
goal hierarchy (Powers, 1973), we hypothesised that inter-goal conflict
and goal ambivalence would each predict unique variance in anxious
and depressive symptoms. Inter-goal facilitation was included as a
covariate, but was not expected to be associated with anxious or de-
pressive symptoms (Riediger & Freund, 2004). We sought to replicate
Kelly et al.’s (2011) interaction between ambivalence and inter-goal
conflict, such that anxious and depressive symptoms would be highest
for individuals reporting high level of goal ambivalence and low levels
of inter-goal conflict. Prospectively, we expected that higher levels of
ambivalence and inter-goal conflict would each predict increases in
anxious and depressive symptoms. More tentatively, we predicted that
the interaction between inter-goal conflict and ambivalence would ex-
plain additional variance in symptom change.
2. Method
2.1. Participants
Two hundred and ten undergraduate students (169 women, 41 men;
M = 20.0 years, SD = 2.5, range = 18–35) were recruited from the
University of Exeter campus via online advertisements. Participants
were remunerated with course credit or £15.
2.2. Materials and procedure
Participants attended an initial 1 h session in which they provided
informed consent, before completing a personal strivings assessment,
inter-goal conflict and facilitation matrices, and depressive and anxious
symptom scales.
2.2.1. Personal goal strivings (Emmons, 1986)
Participants first read instructions asking them to list at least ten
personal goals, defined as “things that you typically or characteristically
are trying to do”, by completing the stem: “I typically try to…” Examples
were provided (e.g., “Convince others that I am intelligent”) and par-
ticipants were told that they should list goals that identified them as
individuals, rather than goals that other people thought they should
have. Participants who generated more than ten goals were asked to
choose the ten that represented them most accurately. Allowing for
minor wording changes, Emmons (1986) found that 82% of goals were
consistent over one year.
2.2.2. Goal ambivalence (Emmons, 1986)
Participants rated their ambivalence about each of their goals on a
6-point scale from 0 (none at all) to 5 (extreme) in response to the fol-
lowing question: “Sometimes even though we successfully reach a goal, we
are unhappy (e.g., if you're “trying to become more intimate with someone”
and you succeed, you might also feel concern about being tied down). How
much unhappiness do you or will you feel when you are successful in this
striving?” Mean ambivalence scores across goals were calculated for
each participant (α = 0.79). Goal ambivalence has previously shown a
one-year stability correlation of 0.65 (Emmons & King, 1988).
2.2.3. Inter-goal conflict and facilitation (Riediger & Freund, 2004)
Participants next completed two 10 × 10 matrices to rate inter-goal
conflict and facilitation respectively. In each matrix, each of the par-
ticipant's ten goals was listed in both rows and columns. In the conflict
matrix, participants rated the extent to which pursuing each of their
goals in the rows “makes it more difficult to pursue” each of the other

 strivings across the columns. In the facilitation matrix, participants
were asked to rate the extent to which pursuing each of the goals in the
rows “makes it easier to pursue” each of the other goals across the
columns, on a 6-point scale from 0 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). Thus,
participants rated the extent to which each of their goals both conflicted
with and facilitated each of their other goals (bidirectionally). Mean
inter-goal conflict (α = 0.91) and facilitation ratings (α = 0.90) were
calculated for each participant.
2.2.4. Beck Depression Inventory–II (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996)
Participants completed the BDI-II, a validated 21-item scale asses-
sing depressive symptoms over the past two weeks. Each item is rated
on a scale from 0 to 3, yielding a total score from 0 to 63 (α = 0.90).
2.2.5. Generalized
Anxiety
Disorder–7
(GAD-7;
Spitzer,
Kroenke,
Williams, & Löwe, 2006)
Participants completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7, a
seven-item scale assessing the frequency of anxious symptoms over the
past two weeks. Each item is rated on a four-point scale from 0 to 3,
yielding a total score from 0 to 21 (α = 0.85).
Participants completed further goal measures not relevant to the
current study, before making an appointment for a follow-up session
one month later (M = 35.0 days, SD = 5.4).
2.2.6. Follow-up session
One hundred and ninety-four (92.3%) participants returned for the
follow-up, when they completed the BDI–II (α = 0.91) and the GAD–71
(α = 0.85), together with other measures irrelevant to the current
study, before being remunerated.
3. Results
3.1. Cross-sectional analysis
Table 1 presents correlations and (untransformed) descriptive sta-
tistics for all variables. Inter-goal facilitation scores clustered around
the scale midpoint but two-thirds of the sample reported mean inter-
goal conflict and ambivalence scores below 1 on the 0–5 scale. Sample
means were below recommended cut-offs for mild depressive (Beck
et al., 1996) and mild anxious symptoms (Spitzer et al., 2006), and
these variables were highly correlated. Due to small means, depressive
and anxious symptom scores, inter-goal conflict and goal ambivalence
were positively skewed so were log-transformed to improve normality.

(208) = 1.99, p = 0.048, d = 0.35, but no other significant gender
differences emerged.
Inter-goal conflict and ambivalence were each significantly posi-
tively correlated with depressive and anxious symptoms at both time
points. At Time 1, inter-goal facilitation was modestly positively asso-
ciated with anxious symptoms. Inter-goal conflict and facilitation were
positively correlated between persons: people reporting more conflict
among their goals tended to report more facilitation, perhaps reflecting
a general response tendency. However, multi-level models (accounting
for clustering of goals within persons) revealed that inter-goal conflict
and facilitation were negatively correlated at the within-person level:
goals that conflicted more with other goals tended to be less mutually
facilitative. Inter-goal conflict and ambivalence were positively corre-
lated at both levels of analysis. Inter-goal facilitation and ambivalence
were not significantly correlated at the between-person level but were
modestly negatively correlated at the within-person level.
To assess unique and interactive relationships, inter-goal conflict,
facilitation and ambivalence were each standardised before entry into a
multiple regression model as predictors of Time 1 depressive symptoms
in the first step, followed by the interactions between (i) inter-goal
conflict and goal ambivalence and (ii) inter-goal facilitation and goal
ambivalence in the second step.2 When entered together in the first
step, inter-goal conflict, facilitation and goal ambivalence jointly ex-
plained 12.1% of depressive symptom variance, F(3, 206) = 9.44,
p < 0.001. Goal ambivalence was independently associated with de-
pressive symptoms at Time 1, β = 0.22, p = 0.002, as was inter-striving
conflict, β = 0.20, p = 0.007, but inter-striving facilitation was not a
significant predictor, β = −0.00, p = 0.99. Critically, when entered in
the second step, the interactions between (i) inter-goal conflict and goal
ambivalence, and (ii) inter-striving facilitation and goal ambivalence,
jointly failed to explain significant additional variance in depressive
symptoms at Time 1, ΔF(2, 204) < 1, p = 0.84, with neither individual
interaction reaching significance, ps > 0.54.
An equivalent multiple regression analysis was conducted to predict
Time 1 anxious symptoms. When standardised and entered simulta-
neously in the first step, inter-goal conflict, facilitation and ambivalence
explained 14.0% of anxious symptom variance, F(3, 206) = 11.14,
p < 0.001. Striving ambivalence was independently associated with
anxious symptoms at Time 1, β = 0.23, p = 0.001, as was inter-striving
conflict, β = 0.19, p = 0.009, but inter-striving facilitation was not a
significant predictor, β = 0.10, p = 0.13. Critically, when entered in
the second step, the interactions between (i) inter-striving conflict and
goal ambivalence, and (ii) inter-striving facilitation and goal ambiva-
lence, jointly failed to explain significant additional variance in Time 1
anxious symptoms, ΔF(2, 204) < 1, p = 0.81, with neither individual
interaction reaching significance, ps > 0.51.
3.2. Longitudinal analysis
Paired t-tests revealed a small, statistically significant decrease in
depressive
symptoms
from
baseline
to
follow-up,
t(193) = 3.42,
p = 0.001, d = 0.20, but no statistically significant difference in an-
xious symptoms over this period, t(192) = 1.45, p = 0.15, d = 0.05.
Further multiple regressions investigated whether inter-goal conflict
and ambivalence predicted change in depressive and anxious symptoms
from Time 1 to Time 2 respectively. In the multiple regression pre-
dicting Time 2 depressive symptoms, Time 1 depressive symptoms was
entered first, followed by standardised inter-goal conflict, inter-goal
facilitation, and goal ambivalence in the second step. Finally, the in-
teractions between (i) inter-goal conflict and goal ambivalence and (ii)
inter-goal facilitation and goal ambivalence were entered in the third
step. Controlling for Time 1 depressive symptoms, inter-goal conflict,
inter-goal facilitation and goal ambivalence jointly failed to explain
significant additional variance in Time 2 depressive symptoms, F(3,
189) = 1.06, p = 0.37, ΔR2 < 0.01. Goal ambivalence, β = 0.10,
p = 0.09, inter-goal conflict, β = −0.05, p = 0.38, and inter-goal fa-
cilitation, β = −0.00, p = 0.97, were not significant predictors. The
interactions entered in the third step failed to explain significant ad-
ditional variance in Time 2 depressive symptoms, F(2, 187) = 1.35,
p = 0.26, ΔR2 < 0.01, with neither interaction being significant,
ps > 0.19. Thus, inter-goal conflict, facilitation and goal ambivalence
did not predict change in depressive symptoms, independently or in-
teractively.
In the parallel multiple regression predicting Time 2 anxious
symptoms, after entering Time 1 anxious symptoms, simultaneous entry
of inter-goal conflict, facilitation and goal ambivalence failed to explain
additional variance in anxious symptoms at Time 2, F(3, 188) < 1,
p = 0.82, ΔR2 < 0.01. Goal ambivalence, β = 0.04, p = 0.43, striving
conflict, β = −0.04, p = 0.45, and striving facilitation, β = 0.00,
p = 0.97, were not significant predictors. The interactions entered in
1 One participant did not complete the GAD-7 at follow-up.
2 Exploratory multiple regression analyses revealed no significant interaction between
goal facilitation and goal conflict in predicting (i) depressive or anxious symptoms at
Time 1, or (ii) residualised change in depressive or anxious symptoms at Time 2.

 the third step failed to explain additional variance in depressive
symptoms at Time 2, F(2, 186) = 2.47, p = 0.09, ΔR2 = 0.01. However,
because the crucial interaction between inter-goal conflict and am-
bivalence was significant (β = 0.11, p = 0.03; the other interaction was
not, p = 0.77), we proceeded to explicate it.
Fig. 1 plots (log) T2 anxious symptoms for persons scoring one
standard deviation above and below the mean on inter-goal conflict and
ambivalence, calculated at mean levels of T1 anxious symptoms and
inter-goal facilitation. Tests of simple slopes revealed that higher levels
of inter-goal conflict at Time 1 were associated with reductions in an-
xious symptoms at Time 2 for persons with lower goal ambivalence
(β = −0.15, p = 0.04). However, levels of inter-goal conflict at Time 1
were not significantly associated with levels of anxious symptoms at
Time 2 for persons with higher goal ambivalence (β = 0.04, p = 0.53).
4. Discussion
Our results support theoretical perspectives and empirical research
suggesting that goal conflict is associated with psychological distress
(Higginson et al., 2011). The positive association between inter-goal
conflict and concurrent psychological symptoms mirrors the results of a
recent meta-analysis (Gray et al., 2017). As hypothesised, inter-goal
facilitation was not uniquely significantly associated with anxious or
depressive symptoms, consistent with distinct relationships for inter-
goal conflict and facilitation (Riediger & Freund, 2004). The relation-
ship between inter-goal conflict and symptoms is unlikely to be due to a
general tendency for distressed people to make more pessimistic goal
ratings, because no negative correlation emerged between inter-goal
facilitation and symptoms. Inter-goal facilitation may be more relevant
to psychological well-being than to distress symptoms (Riediger &
Freund, 2004).
Consistent with previous research (Emmons & King, 1988; King
et al., 1998), goal ambivalence was associated with greater anxious and
depressive symptoms. Ambivalence was moderately positively asso-
ciated with inter-goal conflict at both the between-person and within-
person level of analysis, but was uniquely associated with both anxious
and depressive symptoms, suggesting that they are not mutually re-
dundant. Our study had greater statistical power (0.80 to detect a small-
medium effect size f2 = 0.05) than those reported by Emmons (1986)
and Kelly et al. (2011), which may explain why they did not find that
goal ambivalence and inter-goal conflict had unique associations with
symptoms. Goal ambivalence and inter-goal conflict may reflect moti-
vational conflict at higher and lower levels of the goal hierarchy re-
spectively (Kelly et al., 2015). Furthermore, whereas inter-goal conflict
must be consciously reported, ambivalence towards goals could suggest
higher-level goal conflict that is outside conscious awareness. The un-
ique contributions of inter-goal conflict and ambivalence observed here
support the utility of using distinct measures to capture motivational
conflict associated with distress throughout the goal hierarchy.
We found no evidence for an interaction between ambivalence and
inter-goal conflict in predicting concurrent distress symptoms. Using a
larger sample and a unipolar measure of inter-goal conflict, we did not
replicate Kelly et al.’s (2011) finding that inter-goal conflict buffered
the relationship between ambivalence and depressive symptoms. These
authors speculated that ambivalence may be more closely associated
with psychological distress at lower levels of inter-goal conflict because
this combination implicates unconscious higher-order goal conflicts
that are difficult to resolve. Instead, our results suggest that ambiva-
lence is associated with psychological symptoms at high and low levels
of inter-goal conflict. Thus, psychological distress is associated with
both mid-level conscious conflict and higher-level goal conflict that
generates ambivalence (Kelly et al., 2015). This combination is illus-
trative of a low level of motivational integration across the goal hier-
archy, which may be consistent with goal blockage and negative affect
(Emmons & King, 1988). It is noteworthy that people with more de-
pressive (and to a lesser extent, anxious) symptoms report proportio-
nately more abstract goals (Dickson & MacLeod, 2004; Dickson &
Moberly, 2013; Emmons, 1992). Abstract goals are rated as more dif-
ficult (Emmons, 1992), and their centrality to the self may make goal
conflicts at this level appear irresolvable.
Counter to expectations, neither inter-goal conflict nor goal am-
bivalence predicted change in anxious or depressive symptoms over one
month. Nevertheless, a significant interaction revealed that people with
high levels of inter-goal conflict and low levels of ambivalence ex-
perienced reductions in anxious symptoms. Although it would be in-
appropriate to over-interpret this unexpected finding, which did not

 emerge for depressive symptoms, moderate conflict or differentiation
among goal pursuits may protect against anxiety in the absence of
ambivalence. Previous longitudinal studies have not examined the
longitudinal interaction of inter-goal conflict and ambivalence, and
should seek to replicate this result. Our longitudinal results are contrary
to Boudreaux and Ozer's (2013) finding that goal ambivalence pre-
dicted change in depressive symptoms among undergraduates, and
Koletzko, Herrmann, and Brandstätter’s (2015) finding that mothers'
ambivalence about the specific goal of having a child predicted in-
creased depressive symptoms post-partum.
It could be concluded that our longitudinal results suggest that
inter-goal conflict is a concomitant rather than a cause of distress.
However, depressive and anxious symptoms were highly stable over the
one month period, such that it was difficult for other predictors to
predict change. Furthermore, we elicited goals as enduring strivings
that are relatively stable (Emmons, 1986), while ambivalence and inter-
goal conflict ratings demonstrate considerable stability (Emmons &
King, 1988). Therefore, any long-established pattern of motivational
conflict may not predict further increases in psychological distress.
Consistent with this, Kehr (2003) found that emerging but not enduring
inter-goal conflict predicted changes in affect over eight weeks in
managers. Studies indicate that within-person fluctuations in motiva-
tional conflict are correlated with state affect (Koletzko, La Marca-
Ghaemmaghami, & Brandstätter, 2015; Riediger & Freund, 2004),
suggesting that changes in inter-goal conflict or ambivalence that are
associated with the adoption of new strivings might predict increases in
psychopathology.
Although our findings illuminate the role of distinct forms of mo-
tivational conflict in contributing to psychological distress, this study
has limitations. First, we used a single item to measure goal ambiva-
lence that asked participants to what extent they would experience
negative emotions after goal attainment. Koletzko, Herrmann, and
Brandstätter (2015) argued that this measure does not capture the
contradictory motives entailed in ambivalence, and developed a new
scale for this purpose. Second, we were unable to determine whether
the association between inter-goal conflict and symptoms was related to
inherent incompatibility between goals or competition between goals
for a limited resource, although these dimensions correlate positively
(Riediger & Freund, 2004). Some studies (e.g., Segerstrom & Solberg
Nes, 2006) have recruited independent judges to rate inter-goal conflict
to obtain more objective judgements, which risks failing to capture
idiosyncrasies relating to personal goal strivings. We used an under-
graduate sample whose strivings may be more homogenous than older
adults who have a more consolidated identity. Finally, it is unclear to
what extent our findings are influenced by the probable inclusion of
participants who would meet diagnostic criteria for mood disorders.
Nevertheless, the association between goal conflict and well-being is
relatively consistent across samples (Gray et al., 2017).
In conclusion, our results suggest that both inter-goal and intra-goal
conflict are uniquely associated with psychological distress, such that
goal ambivalence is associated with anxious and depressive symptoms
for individuals reporting high and low levels of inter-goal conflict.
Although our results suggest that chronic goal conflict may not ex-
acerbate symptoms, future research could usefully concentrate on ex-
amining cross-lagged relationships between different forms of motiva-
tional conflict and psychological distress in periods when goal strivings
are adopted or discarded.
