T
he prevalence of cigarette smoking has declined in Can-
ada, from about 50% in the 1960s to 13% in 2015.1 As in 
most other countries, the majority of Canadian smokers 
begin smoking during adolescence, and reductions in the preva-
lence of cigarette smoking in Canada have been achieved primar-
ily through declining rates of smoking initiation among youth.1
The emergence of vapourized nicotine products — widely 
referred to as electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes — has provided 
consumers with an alternative means of nicotine intake. The use 
of e-cigarettes is largely concentrated among adult smokers, most 
of whom report using e-cigarettes to quit smoking or for the pur-
pose of smoking reduction.2,3 However, substantial proportions of 
youth also report using e-cigarettes. In Canada, about 20% of 
youth aged 15–19 years report “ever trying” e-cigarettes, including 
14% of youth nonsmokers, similar to estimates from the United 
Kingdom and the United States.3–7 Although many Canadian youth 
try e-cigarettes, fewer report regular use.3 For example, in a recent 
study of Canadian youth, only 0.2% of all youth — and 2% of those 
who had tried e-cigarettes — reported daily use.8
Studies have consistently shown a strong association between 
e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking.3,9–11 In addition, US studies 
have suggested that the availability of e-cigarettes has expanded 
the nicotine market: rather than simply substituting e-cigarettes 
for cigarette smoking, the total number of youth using any type of 
nicotine product has increased for the first time in decades.12
The extent to which e-cigarette use is causally related to 
smoking initiation remains a source of considerable debate. To 
date, 4 studies have examined the temporal order between e-
cigarette use and smoking initiation. Three studies involving US 
secondary students found that “ever” users of e-cigarettes at 
baseline were more likely to report smoking cigarettes 
12 months later.13–15 In addition, a smaller study of secondary 
students in California found that students who reported “ever” 
using e-cigarettes at baseline were more likely to report using 
cigarettes, cigars, pipes and shisha at follow-up, compared with 
a matched sample of “never” e-cigarette users.16
Although longitudinal studies have been conducted in the US, 
the Canadian market is distinct in several important ways. In Can-
ada, federal regulations require premarket approval for nicotine-
containing e-cigarettes, and no products have received approval 
in Canada to date. Although e-cigarettes with nicotine are widely 
available through vape shops and online, supermarkets and other

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The influence of e-
cigarette use on smoking initiation is a 
highly controversial issue, with limited 
longitudinal data available for examin-
ing temporal associations. We examined 
e-cigarette use and its association with 
cigarette-smoking initiation at 1-year 
follow-up within a large cohort of Can-
adian secondary school students. 
METHODS: We analyzed data from stu-
dents in grades 9–12 who participated 
in 2 waves of COMPASS, a cohort study 
of purposefully sampled secondary 
schools in Ontario and Alberta, Canada, 
at baseline (2013/14) and 1-year follow-
up (2014/15). We assessed cigarette 
smoking and e-cigarette use at baseline 
and follow-up using self-completed sur-
veys. We used generalized linear mixed-
effects models to examine correlates of 
past 30-day e-cigarette use at baseline 
and smoking initiation between waves 
within the longitudinal sample.
RESULTS: Past 30-day e-cigarette use 
increased from 2013/14 to 2014/15 (7.2% 
v. 9.7%, p < 0.001), whereas past 30-day 
cigarette smoking decreased slightly 
(11.4% v. 10.8%, p = 0.02). Among the 
44 163 students evaluated at baseline, 
past 30-day e-cigarette use was strongly 
associated with smoking status and 
smoking susceptibility. In the longitudinal 
sample (n = 19 130), past 30-day use of 
e-cigarettes at baseline was associated 
with initiation of smoking a whole ciga-
rette (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.12, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.68–2.66) and 
with initiation of daily smoking (adjusted 
OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.41–2.28) at follow-up.
INTERPRETATION: E-cigarette use was 
strongly associated with cigarette smok-
ing behaviour, including smoking initia-
tion at follow-up. The causal nature of 
this association remains unclear, 
because common factors underlying the 
use of both e-cigarettes and conven-
tional cigarettes may also account for 
the temporal order of initiation.

conventional retail outlets typically sell non–nicotine-containing 
e-cigarettes. At the time of the study, non-nicotine e-cigarettes 
could be legally purchased by minors, and accounted for a greater 
proportion of the e-cigarette market than in many other coun-
tries.4 In addition, there is little advertising or marketing for e-
cigarettes in traditional media outlets in Canada, in contrast to the 
situation in the US and the UK.17 Canada’s distinct regulatory en-
vironment may have important implications for e-cigarette use 
among youth and its association with smoking behaviour. For 
example, the greater prevalence of non–nicotine-containing e-
cigarettes may be less likely to promote smoking behaviour, given 
the lack of nicotine exposure.
We sought to examine e-cigarette use in a large longitudinal sam-
ple of Canadian youth, including the extent to which e-cigarette use 
was associated with cigarette-smoking initiation at 1-year follow-up.
Methods
The COMPASS study is an ongoing cohort study that collects lon-
gitudinal data from a convenience sample of secondary school 
students (grades 9–12) in Ontario and Alberta, Canada. A full 
description of the design and methods of the study is avail-
able.18–20 For the current study, we assessed e-cigarette use at 
baseline (year 2 of the COMPASS study, in 2013/14), as well as at 
1-year follow-up (year 3 of the study, in 2014/15).
Schools were recruited for the survey through purposefully 
selected school boards that met the following eligibility criteria: 
English-speaking, with at least 100 students in each of grades 9 
through 12, and permitted the use of active-information, passive-
consent parental permission protocols (whereby information letters 
are mailed to the parents or guardians, who are asked to contact the 
researcher to decline their child’s participation). Within each school, 
all students were invited to participate. A more detailed description 
of study enrolment is provided in Appendix 1 (available at www.cmaj 
.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.161002/-/DC1). 
Measures
Data for all measures were collected using paper-based surveys 
administered by teachers, under the supervision of study 
research assistants. Sociodemographic measures included age, 
sex, race/ethnicity (“How would you describe yourself?” with the 
following “Mark all that apply” options: white, black, Asian, 
Aboriginal [First Nations, Metis, Inuit], Latin American/Hispanic 
and other; those selecting more than 1 option were categorized 
as “other/mixed”) and spending money (“About how much 
money do you usually get each week to spend on yourself or to 
save? [Remember to include all money from allowances and jobs 
like babysitting, delivering papers, etc.]” with options of zero, $1 
to $5, $6 to $10, $11 to $20, $21 to $40, $41 to $100, more than 
 
$100 and “I do not know how much money I get each week”). 
We defined past 30-day cigarette use as 1 or more days in 
response to the question, “On how many of the last 30 days did you 
smoke one or more cigarettes?” We first classified smoking status 
into 6 categories: current daily smokers, who had smoked at least 
100 cigarettes (lifetime) and had smoked every day of the past 
30 days; current occasional smokers, who had smoked at least 100 
cigarettes (lifetime) and had smoked on at least 1 day, but fewer 
than 30 days, of the past 30 days; former smokers, who had smoked 
at least 100 cigarettes (lifetime), but had not smoked in the last 
30 days; experimental smokers, who had smoked a whole cigarette, 
but less than 100 cigarettes (lifetime); puffers, who had tried smok-
ing but had not smoked a whole cigarette; and those who reported 
never having tried smoking. We then further classified the “never 
tried” group as susceptible or not susceptible to smoking, where 
susceptibility was defined as the absence of a firm commitment not 
to smoke (i.e., any response other than “definitely not”) on all 3 of 
the following susceptibility questions: “Do you think in the future 
you might try smoking cigarettes?” “If one of your best friends was 
to offer you a cigarette, would you smoke it?” and “At any time dur-
ing the next year do you think you will smoke a cigarette?”
We created a variable for smoking initiation using the measure 
of ever having smoked a whole cigarette (“Have you ever smoked 
a whole cigarette?”) at baseline and follow-up: “never smokers” 
were those who responded “No” at both waves, and “initiators” 
were those who responded “No” at baseline but “Yes” at follow-
up; those who had already smoked at baseline were excluded. We 
also created a variable for daily smoking initiation, using the mea-
sure of ever having smoked daily for 7 consecutive days (“Have 
you ever smoked every day for at least 7 days in a row?”) at base-
line and follow-up: “never daily smokers” were those who 
responded “No” at both waves, and “daily initiators” were those 
who responded “No” at baseline but “Yes” at follow-up; those who 
had already smoked every day for 7 days at baseline were 
excluded. 
We assessed past 30-day use of e-cigarettes by asking, “In the 
last 30 days, did you use any of the following? (Mark all that 
apply),” with a list of products, including “e-cigarettes (electronic 
cigarettes that look like cigarettes/cigars, but produce vapour 
instead of smoke).”
Statistical analysis
All of the analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS 
Institute).
For cross-sectional analyses, we used χ2 tests to examine dif-
ferences between survey years in past-month e-cigarette and cig-
arette use, as well as differences in characteristics between the 
single-wave and longitudinal samples. To examine variables asso-
ciated with past 30-day use of e-cigarettes in the baseline sample, 
we estimated a generalized linear mixed-effects (GLM) model, 
including covariables for age, sex, race/ethnicity, spending 
money, smoking status (as fixed effects) and a random effect of 
school (to account for student clustering within schools). We also 
estimated separate GLM models for each covariable to generate 
unadjusted estimates.
For the longitudinal analyses, to examine cigarette-smoking 
initiation between baseline and follow-up, we estimated a GLM 
for the linked sample at follow-up (among those who had never 
smoked a whole cigarette at baseline), accounting for student 
clustering within schools by entering school as a random effect, 
and including the past-wave covariables (i.e., baseline values) of 
age, sex, race/ethnicity, spending money and past 30-day e-
cigarette use as fixed effects. We estimated a similar GLM model

using daily cigarette-smoking initiation between baseline and 
follow-up (among those who had never smoked daily for 7 days 
at baseline). We excluded participants with missing data from 
the models on a case-wise basis. 
Ethics approval
The COMPASS study was reviewed by and received ethics clear-
ance from the University of Waterloo Office of Research Ethics 
and appropriate school board review panels.
Results
Samples
The COMPASS study was conducted in 89 secondary schools at 
baseline (79 in Ontario and 10 in Alberta) and 87 secondary 
schools at follow-up (78 in Ontario and 9 in Alberta); 86 schools 
(77 in Ontario and 9 in Alberta) participated at both baseline and 
follow-up. Figure 1 shows sample participation in each wave; 
19 310 students who provided data for both waves were included 
in the longitudinal analysis. 
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the overall and 
longitudinal samples. Students in the longitudinal sample, who 
provided data at both waves, were significantly more likely to be 
female, to report their race/ethnicity as white and to report lower 
levels of smoking and e-cigarette use, and were significantly dif-
ferent on age (younger at baseline) and spending money (less at 
baseline) compared with students who provided data at only 
1 wave (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). 
Cross-sectional results: e-cigarette prevalence and 
predictors
Among all students surveyed (n = 44 163 at baseline; n = 41 262 at 
follow-up), prevalence of past 30-day e-cigarette use increased 
significantly from baseline to follow-up (7.2% v. 9.7%, p < 0.001). 
Past 30-day cigarette smoking decreased slightly between base-
line and follow-up (11.4% v. 10.8%, p = 0.02). 
Use of e-cigarettes was strongly associated with cigarette 
smoking: at baseline, 31.5% of students who had smoked a ciga-
rette in the past 30 days also reported using an e-cigarette over 
the same period, compared with 5.0% of students who had not 
smoked in the past 30 days. After multivariable adjustment (and 
controlling for the effect of school), age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
spending money and smoking status were significantly associ-
ated with past 30-day e-cigarette use in the baseline sample 
(Table 2). 
Longitudinal results: initiation of cigarette smoking 
by follow-up
Respondents who had already smoked a whole cigarette at base-
line (n = 1992) were excluded from the analysis of initiation of 
ciga 
rette smoking. Overall, 8.4% of the longitudinal sample who 
had “never smoked” at baseline had smoked a whole cigarette 
by 1-year follow-up. Students who reported past 30-day e-ciga-
rette use at baseline were significantly more likely to initiate 
smoking at follow-up (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.12, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 1.68–2.66) (Table 3). Smoking initiation was 
more likely among males (adjusted OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.28–1.62)

and those with more spending money ($21–$100 v. $0 per week, 
adjusted OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.04–1.50; > $100 v. $0 per week, 
adjusted OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.22–1.91). Compared with nonsuscep-
tible never-smokers, smoking initiation was more likely among 
those who were susceptible to smoking (adjusted OR 3.86, 95% 
CI 3.36–4.43) and those who had already tried smoking less than 
a whole cigarette (adjusted OR 13.56, 95% CI 11.60–15.85). 
The analysis of daily smoking initiation excluded respondents 
who had already smoked every day for 7 days at baseline (n = 619). 
Overall, 3.7% of the longitudinal sample who had never “smoked 
every day for 7 days in a row” at baseline had done so by 1-year 
follow-up. Correlates of daily smoking initiation at follow-up (Table 4) 
were similar to those for ever-smoking initiation, including e-cigarette 
use at baseline (adjusted OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.41–2.28).

baseline (192 daily, 263 occasional), 39 (8.6%) were former smok-
ers at follow-up and 349 (76.7%) were current smokers; the 
remaining 67 (14.7%) were classified as having a nonsmoking 
status that was inconsistent with having been a current smoker

who became former smokers, 10 (25.6%) reported past 30-day 
e-cigarette use at baseline and 6 (15.4%) reported past 30-day 
e-cigarette use at follow-up. Of the 349 respondents who remained 
current smokers, 116 (33.2%) reported past 30-day e-cigarette use 
at baseline and 130 (37.2%) reported past 30-day e-cigarette use at

Interpretation
The current study is among the largest longitudinal studies of e-
cigarette use and cigarette-smoking initiation to date. The findings 
are consistent with those of other surveys conducted in Canada, 
which have shown increasing rates of e-cigarette use among youth:

in our study, about 10% of youth reported using an e-cigarette in the 
past 30 days, compared with national estimates of 3% in 2013.3,7
In the cross-sectional analysis, e-cigarette use was associated 
with cigarette-smoking behaviour in a dose–response fashion. 
Differences in past 30-day e-cigarette use were observed even 
among lower thresholds of smoking behaviour, including 
between “puffers” and never smokers, and by smoking suscepti-
bility. We did not assess reasons for e-cigarette use among youth 
smokers; however, research with adults has indicated that smok-
ers use e-cigarettes for a variety of reasons other than quitting,

including for use in places where smoking is not allowed and to 
cut back on, but not quit, smoking.21 There is a need for similar 
data on reasons for use from population-based studies of youth.
Youth who reported e-cigarette use in the past 30 days at base-
line were more likely to initiate cigarette smoking and more likely 
to report having smoked daily at follow-up, even after adjustment 
for a range of other factors at baseline. These findings are consis-
tent with prior longitudinal studies.13,14,16 It is unclear the extent to 
which this association is causal. At the individual level, e-cigarettes 
may be causally related to cigarette smoking because they provide 
early exposure to nicotine or greater exposure to environmental 
risk factors, including greater exposure to smokers or certain 
social settings. E-cigarette use may also help to “re-normalize” 
smoking by promoting more positive normative beliefs about nic-
otine use and smoking, which are important predictors of 
uptake.22 Alternatively, both e-cigarettes and cigarette smoking 
could be the result of unmeasured “common factors.”23 Several 
studies to date have adjusted for factors such as sensation-
seeking, parental support and rebelliousness, and have found that 
the association with e-cigarette use persists; however, it is doubt-
ful that any analysis can adequately control for the range of “com-
mon factors” that may account for the use of multiple nicotine 
products.14,15 Put more simply, youth who try e-cigarettes may be 
different from those who do not.24 The temporal order, whereby 
e-cigarette use precedes cigarette-smoking initiation, may be 
explained by the fact that e-cigarettes are more accessible than 
cigarettes to Can 
adian youth, and are therefore likely to be 
encountered and used first.
Despite a substantial increase in the prevalence of past 
30-day e-cigarette use between baseline and follow-up, the prev-
alence of cigarette smoking decreased slightly in the overall sam-
ple. This pattern of data has previously been cited by proponents 
as evidence that e-cigarette use does not increase cigarette-
smoking initiation and, subsequently, smoking rates; however, it 
is also possible that smoking rates might have decreased further 
in the absence of e-cigarette use. Regardless, the current pattern 
of data suggests that — if e-cigarettes do in fact increase smoking 
initiation — the impact to date has been insufficient to com-
pletely stall or reverse the decline in youth smoking in Canada.
Limitations and strengths
The current study is among the largest to examine e-cigarette 
use among youth. The study was conducted in only 2 Canadian 
provinces, and schools were not recruited using probability-
based sampling methods; therefore, comparisons with national 
estimates should be made with caution. The study had several 
limitations common to longitudinal research, including nonran-
dom attrition at follow-up. All measures relied on self-report; 
however, the confidentiality of responses was emphasized, and 
self-reported measures of tobacco use have been previously vali-
dated using biochemical measures.25 The regulatory context of e-
cigarettes in Canada should also be noted when interpreting 
these findings. In particular, non–nicotine-containing e-
cigarettes account for a greater proportion of the e-cigarette 
market in Canada than in many other countries.3,26 Future re-
search should examine the likelihood of smoking initiation with 
nicotine-containing versus non–nicotine-containing e-cigarettes. 
Finally, the current study examined only 1 dimension of e-
cigarettes and cigarette smoking (i.e., initiation): it did not have 
adequate statistical power to assess the impact of e-cigarette 
use on smoking cessation among youth smokers, which is a criti-
cally important determinant of the net public health impact of e-
cigarettes. However, we have reported raw data on e-cigarette 
use and subsequent smoking cessation.
Conclusion
The current study provides strong evidence that e-cigarettes are 
associated with initiation of cigarette smoking among youth; 
however, the controversy as to whether e-cigarette use “causes” 
cigarette-smoking initiation will undoubtedly persist. In fact, the 
findings from our study provide support for both sides of the de-
bate. It is highly plausible that “common factors” account for a 
substantial proportion of increased cigarette-smoking initiation 
among e-cigarette users. At the same time, it would be foolhardy 
to dismiss the likelihood that early exposure to nicotine via e-
cigarettes increases smoking uptake. Attributing the relative im-
portance of these 2 factors will not be straightforward, and rep-
resents a critical challenge to the research community. In the 
meantime, regulatory frameworks that succeed in shifting e-
cigarette use away from youth and concentrating their use 
among cigarette smokers for the purposes of smoking cessation 
are likely to have the greatest public health impact.
