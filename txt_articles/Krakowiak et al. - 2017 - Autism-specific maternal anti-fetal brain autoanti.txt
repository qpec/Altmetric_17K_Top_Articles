Abstract
Lay Abstract—Approximately 23% of mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD) produce specific patterns of antibodies to fetal brain tissue that have been detected in only 
1% of mothers of typically developing children. However, it is unknown what causes these ASD-
specific anti-fetal antibodies to be produced. We examined the relationship between ASD-specific 
anti-fetal antibodies and metabolic conditions during pregnancy in 227 mothers of 2–5 year old 
children with ASD, enrolled in the CHARGE (Childhood Autism Risk from Genetics and the 
Environment) Study, and who had blood samples measured for these anti-fetal brain antibodies 
after study enrollment. Metabolic conditions included diabetes, hypertensive disorders, and 
prepregnancy obesity or overweight. The presence of ASD-specific anti-fetal brain antibody 
patterns was more common among mothers diagnosed with diabetes, hypertensive disorders, or 
overweight during pregnancy compared to healthy mothers, but these differences did not reach 
statistical significance. In a subset of 145 mothers whose children exhibited severe ASD 
symptoms, those diagnosed with type 2 or gestational diabetes were nearly 3 times more likely to 
have ASD-specific anti-fetal antibodies compared to healthy mothers. Further, those diagnosed 
with gestational diabetes specifically were over 3 times more likely to have these anti-fetal brain 
antibodies. In this exploratory study, mothers whose children had severe ASD and who were 
diagnosed with diabetes were more likely to have anti-fetal brain autoantibodies 2–5 years later.

 Scientific Abstract—Approximately 23% of mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD) produce specific patterns of autoantibodies to fetal brain proteins that have been detected in 
only 1% of mothers of typically developing children. The biological mechanisms underlying the 
development of ASD-specific maternal autoantibodies are poorly understood. We sought to 
determine whether ASD-specific maternal autoantibodies identified postnatally were associated 
with metabolic conditions (MCs) during gestation. Participants were 227 mothers of 2–5 year old 
children with confirmed ASD, enrolled in CHARGE (Childhood Autism Risk from Genetics and 
the Environment) between January 2003 and April 2008, and from whom blood samples were 
collected and analyzed for anti-fetal brain autoantibodies (Ab+). MCs included diabetes, 
hypertensive disorders, and prepregnancy obesity or overweight, ascertained from medical records 
or structured telephone interviews. Log-linear regression models were performed to estimate 
prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) based on robust standard errors. Fifty-six 
(25%) mothers were Ab+. Ab+ prevalence was higher among mothers with diabetes, hypertensive 
disorders, or overweight compared to healthy mothers, but differences were not statistically 
significant. In a subset of 145 mothers whose children exhibited severe ASD (31 Ab+), those 
diagnosed with type 2 or gestational diabetes were 2.7-fold more likely to be Ab+ (95% CI 1.1, 
6.6), controlling for delivery payer and smoking. Gestational diabetes specifically was associated 
with a 3.2-fold increased Ab+ prevalence (95% CI 1.2, 8.6). In this exploratory study, mothers 
whose children had severe ASD and who experienced diabetes were more likely to have anti-fetal 
brain autoantibodies 2–5 years later.

INTRODUCTION
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that manifests in early 
childhood and is characterized by impairments in social communication and presence of 
stereotyped behaviors and restricted interests, with varying degrees of symptom severity and 
presentation.(American Psychiatric Association, 2013) Approximately 1.5% of U.S. children 
are affected by ASD.(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) & Developmental 
Disabilities Monitoring Network Surveillance Year 2010 Principal Investigators, 2014) 
Multiple etiologies are likely involved in the pathogenesis of ASD. Maternal immune factors 
that can cross the placenta have been implicated for a subset of ASD.
During pregnancy, the fetus relies on maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies for 
protection from pathogens. At approximately 13 weeks gestation through term, maternally 
derived IgG antibodies are transported across the placenta and can persist for up to 6 months 
postnatally although at lower levels than found at birth. Maternal antibodies are also 
transferred to the infant through breast milk in the form of IgA.(Palmeira, Quinello, Silveira-
Lessa, Zago, & Carneiro-Sampaio, 2012) Although most maternal IgG antibodies are 
considered beneficial in that they have the capacity to confer passive immunity, others 
appear to be pathogenic with the potential to trigger compromise in immune and 
neurodevelopment.(Braunschweig & Van de Water, 2012; Chang, 2012) The blood-brain

 barrier is permissive during fetal development, and maternal antibodies are allowed greater 
access to the brain; consequently, pathogenic antibodies targeting particular fetal brain 
proteins may alter their function.(Diamond, Huerta, Mina-Osorio, Kowal, & Volpe, 2009; 
Fox, Amaral, & Van de Water, 2012)
Several groups have identified independently that some mothers of children with ASD 
produce antibodies reactive to fetal brain tissue.(Braunschweig et al., 2008; Braunschweig et 
al., 2012; Brimberg, Sadiq, Gregersen, & Diamond, 2013; Dalton et al., 2003; Singer et al., 
2008; Zimmerman et al., 2007) Originally, Braunschweig et al(Braunschweig et al., 2008; 
Braunschweig et al., 2012) observed specific band patterns of IgG reactivity to fetal brain 
proteins at 37 and 73 kDa in a subset of mothers of children with ASD but not among 
mothers of typically developing or developmentally delayed children in the current 
population-based case-control study. These findings have been replicated in other 
populations, including a nested case-control study that used prospectively collected mid-
gestation blood, further implicating transplacental passage of maternal anti-fetal brain 
autoantibodies in ASD pathogenesis.(Croen et al., 2008; Piras et al., 2014; Rossi, Van de 
Water, Rogers, & Amaral, 2011)
Recently, Van de Water and colleagues identified the target antigens of these ASD-specific 
maternal autoantibodies using more precise laboratory methods than those implemented 
previously: lactate dehydrogenase A and B (LDH), cypin (guanine deaminase), stress-
induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), collapsin response mediator proteins 1 and 2 (CRMP1, 
CRMP2) and Y-box-binding protein 1 (YBX1).(Braunschweig et al., 2013) These proteins 
are highly expressed in the brain and perform critical functions in neurodevelopment. Using 
these newly identified proteins, it was found that approximately 23% of mothers of children 
with ASD had specific combinations of antibody reactivity to these proteins, while these 
combinations were detected in 2 of 149 mothers of typically developing children; these 
findings suggested a high specificity for ASD relative to typical development although 
associations with other neurodevelopmental disabilities were not examined. Furthermore, the 
original 37/73 kDa banding patterns were associated with more severe ASD symptoms and 
greater impairments in expressive language.(Braunschweig et al., 2012; Piras et al., 2014) 
More recently, autoantibodies to LDH, CRMP1 and STIP1 were highly associated with 
increased stereotypic behavior, a core feature of ASD.(Braunschweig et al., 2013) Although 
the biological mechanisms underlying the development of anti-fetal brain autoantibodies 
remain unknown, some have postulated that systemic immune dysregulation, arising from 
environmental or genetic factors, may lead to a breakdown of maternal immune tolerance 
and subsequently the production of these autoantibodies.(Braunschweig & Van de Water, 
2012; Fox et al., 2012; Heuer, Braunschweig, Ashwood, Van de Water, & Campbell, 2011) 
We have previously shown a strong correlation between the c-MET ‘C’ allele polymorphism 
and autoantibodies to the 37/73 kDa bands in fetal brain; the MET signaling pathway is 
involved in regulating immune response and maintaining tolerance to both self-proteins and 
the developing fetus.(Heuer et al., 2011)
Mothers of children with ASD are also disproportionately afflicted with metabolic 
conditions (MCs) during pregnancy, such as obesity, gestational diabetes and hypertensive 
disorders, compared to mothers of typically developing children.(Connolly et al., 2016; 
Krakowiak et al.

 Krakowiak et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016; Walker et al., 2015; Xiang et al., 2015; Xu, Jing, 
Bowers, Liu, & Bao, 2014) These conditions are characterized by persistent low-grade 
inflammation and insulin resistance.(Chaiworapongsa, Chaemsaithong, Yeo, & Romero, 
2014; Korkmazer & Solak, 2015; Olefsky & Glass, 2010; Pantham, Aye, & Powell, 2015) 
Moreover, metabolic function and immune tolerance are controlled by common signaling 
pathways, suggesting that sufficient disruption in one system may lead to a dysfunction in 
the other.(Matarese, Procaccini, & De Rosa, 2012; Procaccini et al., 2013) We therefore 
hypothesized that some mothers of children with ASD and pregnancies complicated by MCs 
would be susceptible to producing autoantibodies with reactivity to fetal brain proteins, as 
these antigens are detectable in maternal circulation. Among mothers of children with ASD, 
we sought to determine whether postnatally detected ASD-specific maternal autoantibodies 
to proteins highly expressed in fetal brain were more prevalent in women who experienced 
specific MCs during pregnancy, and whether the relationship between MCs and these 
autoantibodies differed across strata of ASD symptom severity.
METHODS
Study population
This study included 227 mothers of children with ASD enrolled in the Childhood Autism 
Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) Study between January 29, 2003 and 
April 4, 2008. This subset consisted of all mothers of children with ASD who had 
measurements of anti-fetal brain autoantibodies (n=246) and complete data on MCs 
(n=227). CHARGE is an ongoing population-based case-control study investigating a broad 
range of risk factors for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disabilities, with participants 
selected from 3 groups: ASD, developmental delay, and typical development from the 
general population.(Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2006) Eligible children were 2–5 years old, born 
in California, living with a biological parent who spoke English or Spanish, and resided in 
the catchment areas of selected regional centers in California. Children were identified as 
described previously.(Braunschweig et al., 2013; Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2006; Krakowiak et 
al., 2012) The CHARGE Study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of 
the University of California in Davis and Los Angeles and the State of California Committee 
for the Protection of Human Subjects. Families provided written informed consent before 
participating.
Diagnosis
Participants completed a series of standardized assessments administered by research-
reliable clinicians at the UC Davis Medical Investigations of Neurodevelopmental Disorders 
(MIND) Institute to confirm diagnoses. ASD diagnosis was verified with gold standard 
instruments, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)(Lord, Rutter, DiLavore, 
& Risi, 2000; Lord et al., 2012) and Autism Diagnostic Interview – Revised (ADI-R)(Le 
Couteur, Lord, & Rutter, 2003), using criteria described by Risi et al(Risi et al., 2006) and in 
accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders–5 (DSM-5).
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013) ADOS comparison scores(Gotham, Pickles, & 
Lord, 2009; Lord et al., 2012) (range 1–10) were used to determine ASD intensity, with 
scores ≥7 indicating severe symptoms.

 Exposures
We used medical records or maternal report from structured telephone interviews (with 
abstractors and interviewers masked to the child’s case status) to establish whether mothers 
experienced any of the following MCs during their index pregnancy: diabetes (type 2 [n=2], 
gestational [n=17]), hypertensive disorders without diabetes (chronic [n=4], gestational/
preeclampsia [n=18]), and prepregnancy obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 [n=36]) or 
overweight (moderate [BMI 27–29.9] [n=22], slight [BMI 25–26.9] [n=27]) without other 
MCs; the referent group consisted of women with no MCs and with a healthy weight (BMI 
<25 [n=101]; 6 were underweight [BMI <18.5]). MCs were grouped into hierarchical 
mutually exclusive categories based on a presumed level of metabolic and immune 
disruption that was expected to be the highest among those with diabetes (the breakdown of 
metabolic condition categories is presented in eTable 2 in the Supplement). We obtained 
medical records for >78% of mothers (78% with prenatal and 85% with delivery records); 
60% had prepregnancy weights recorded in medical charts. Maternal report was used when 
medical records were unavailable. Medical record extraction and validation of maternal 
report are described elsewhere.(Krakowiak, Walker, Tancredi, & Hertz-Picciotto, 2015)
Outcome
Anti-fetal brain autoantibodies were measured in maternal blood samples collected at the 
CHARGE clinic visit when the child was 2–5 years old. Target antigens were identified 
using laboratory methods described elsewhere.(Braunschweig et al., 2013) We defined 
mothers as having ASD-specific autoantibodies (Ab+) if they had one of a set of antigen 
reactivity patterns that was collectively 99% specific to ASD (eTable 1 in the Supplement, 
includes statistical methods).
Statistical analysis
Covariates included maternal age at delivery, self-identified race/ethnicity, birth place, 
education, delivery payer, parity, gestational age (GA), inter-pregnancy interval (IPI), 
smoking and alcohol consumption during the 3 months before conception and pregnancy. 
We assessed associations between the outcome (ASD-specific autoantibodies) and our 
predictor (MCs), as well as with each covariate. Variables broadly associated (P <0.20) with 
the outcome were included in initial regression models; a change of ≥10% in the β-
coefficient of the MCs determined which variables remained in the final models. Log-linear 
models with robust standard errors(Zou, 2004) were carried out in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, 
Cary NC) to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on the entire 
study sample (N=227) and subset of mothers of children with severe ASD (n=145). Final 
models were adjusted for maternal smoking and delivery payer. Figures were created in 
GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla CA).
Sensitivity analyses
To examine associations between MCs irrespective of co-existing conditions and Ab+ status, 
we repeated our main analysis using non-mutually exclusive indicators for each condition. 
Specifically, each MC was modeled separately with no MCs and a healthy weight (BMI 
<25) as the referent category for all comparisons. For each condition, the predictor variable

 consisted of 3 nominal categories: (1) has the MC of interest, (2) has another MC or is 
overweight, or (3) has a healthy weight with no MCs. We also conducted an analysis using 
100% ASD-specific antigen combinations to confirm main analysis findings.
RESULTS
Fifty-six (25%) of 227 mothers were Ab+. Mothers with and without these autoantibodies 
did not differ with respect to age, education, GA, parity, or IPI; Ab+ mothers were more 
likely to be Hispanic or multiracial, born outside of U.S., smoke, and use public assistance 
for delivery (Table 1; ‘Severe ASD’ subset in eTable 3 in the Supplement).
ASD-specific autoantibodies were more prevalent among women with diabetes, 
hypertensive disorders, and moderate overweight than healthy women (Figure 1; eTable 4); 
nevertheless, these differences were not statistically significant (Table 2). Restricting 
analyses to mothers of children with severe ASD yielded significant associations between 
diabetes and Ab+ status (Table 2); women diagnosed with diabetes (type 2 or gestational) 
were 2.7 times more likely to be Ab+ than healthy women, in models adjusted for delivery 
payer and smoking (PR=2.66, 95% CI 1.07, 6.63). Moderate overweight without co-
occurring MCs was marginally associated with Ab+ (PR=2.55, 95% CI 1.00, 6.49), but 
surprisingly, obesity was not. Excluding women with chronic conditions (type 2 diabetes 
[n=2] or hypertension without diabetes [n=4]) strengthened the association between 
gestational diabetes and Ab+ status in the severe ASD subset (PR=3.18, 95% CI 1.17, 8.64).
Sensitivity analyses
As expected, our findings using non-mutually exclusive indicators for individual MCs were 
similar to those in the main analysis (eTables 5, 6); additionally, preeclampsia was 
associated with Ab+ status (PR=2.83, 95% CI 1.12, 7.18). Interestingly, all women 
diagnosed with both gestational diabetes and preeclampsia (n=3) were Ab+ in contrast to 
≤25% of those with one condition (2 of 9 with diabetes; 3 of 12 with preeclampsia); by 
comparison, only 7 (12%) of 58 healthy mothers were Ab+. Using 100% ASD-specific 
antigen combinations yielded similar results as the main analysis; in the severe ASD subset, 
associations between Ab+ status and diabetes and also moderate overweight were slightly 
stronger (eTables 7, 8).
DISCUSSION
Our study revealed that ASD-specific maternal autoantibodies were more prevalent among 
mothers diagnosed with diabetes, hypertensive disorders, or who were moderately 
overweight compared to healthy mothers. Among mothers of children exhibiting severe 
ASD symptoms, we observed a 3-fold higher prevalence of Ab+ in relation to gestational 
diabetes. Our findings suggest that some MCs may contribute to a breakdown of maternal 
immune tolerance and subsequent production of autoantibodies to fetal brain, although 
prospective and mechanistic studies are needed to establish a causal relationship. This is the 
first study to investigate MCs in relation to maternal anti-fetal brain autoantibodies.

 Inflammation and MCs in gestation
It is well established that MCs (obesity; hypertension, preeclampsia; type 2, gestational 
diabetes) are characterized by decreased sensitivity to insulin signaling and persistent low-
grade inflammation.(Chaiworapongsa et al., 2014; Olefsky & Glass, 2010; Pantham et al., 
2015) Moreover, elevated BMI is a recognized risk factor for diabetes and hypertensive 
disorders. Adipose tissue consists of many cell types including immune cells (macrophages, 
B and T lymphocytes), and it is therefore an abundant source of signaling proteins with 
metabolic- and immune-modulating functions (adipocytokines).(Makki, Froguel, & 
Wolowczuk, 2013; Olefsky & Glass, 2010; Pantham et al., 2015) In a state of metabolically-
induced inflammation, immune cell profiles shift favoring a proinflammatory environment, 
chronically maintained through an autocrine and paracrine network of signaling molecules, 
in tissues responsible for regulating energy metabolism including adipose, liver, and 
pancreas; pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes, ensue when compensatory 
mechanisms break down. Furthermore, metabolic and immune derangements evident in 
diabetic and hypertensive pregnancies may alter placental function by stimulating 
production of inflammatory immune factors and inducing oxidative stress.
The placenta is a complex organ with metabolic and immune regulatory functions that acts 
as an interface between maternal and fetal circulations. It is composed of both fetally- and 
maternally-derived cells and can be separated into three regions.(Hsiao & Patterson, 2012; 
Racicot, Kwon, Aldo, Silasi, & Mor, 2014) The maternal decidua forms the peripheral layer 
in contact with the uterine wall and is densely populated with immune cells (natural killer 
cells, macrophages, T lymphocytes); beneath is a layer of fetally-derived trophoblast cells 
that synthesize hormones and endocrine factors to support the pregnancy; finally, the 
chorionic villi form intervillous spaces where regulated maternal-fetal blood exchange takes 
place, including transfer of nutrients, waste products, gases, and IgG antibodies. 
Consequently, the placenta is influenced by the metabolic and immune milieu present in 
both the maternal and fetal compartments.
The physiological changes of pregnancy, facilitated by placentally-derived hormones, 
adipocytokines, and other signaling molecules, naturally lead to an insulin resistant state in 
the 2nd trimester that persists through term to promote healthy fetal growth and to increase 
maternal adipose tissue in preparation for lactation.(Barbour et al., 2007; Gabbe et al., 2012) 
While most women maintain normoglycemia through increased insulin secretion, gestational 
diabetes develops when the glucose homeostasis is disrupted resulting in maternal and fetal 
hyperglycemia. Poorly controlled hyperglycemia stimulates inflammatory responses in the 
adipose tissue and placental immune cells, which can have profound effects on placental 
vasculature and function, thus leading to reduced uteroplacental or fetoplacental blood flow 
(i.e., placental dysfunction).(Lin et al., 2005; Magee et al., 2014; Pantham et al., 2015; 
Radaelli, Varastehpour, Catalano, & Hauguel-de Mouzon, 2003; Sisino et al., 2013) Indeed, 
women with dysregulated metabolic function are also at an increased risk for preeclampsia, 
a gestational hypertensive disorder thought to arise from abnormal placentation, possibly 
due to insufficient immune tolerance.(Chaiworapongsa et al., 2014; Hsiao & Patterson, 
2012)

 Although trophoblast cells express paternal alloantigens, several tolerogenic mechanisms are 
in place to prevent an anti-fetal immune response and to maintain an anti-inflammatory 
environment including: (1) trophoblast secretion of factors and expression of surface ligands 
to control immune reactivity, (2) fetal cell shedding into maternal circulation to promote 
tolerance, and (3) trophoblast evasion of maternal immune recognition through a limited 
expression of specific cell surface molecules that interact with immune cells.(Hsiao & 
Patterson, 2012) Nevertheless, maternal immune and/or metabolic dysfunction may alter the 
balance of immune and endocrine factors at the placental level, leading to a breach in 
immune tolerance and possibly the development of anti-fetal brain autoantibodies.
Autoantibodies to fetal brain proteins
Several potential mechanisms have been proposed to explain maternal production of anti-
fetal brain autoantibodies including: (1) immune response to a molecular mimic during an 
infection, (2) alloimmunization to fetal proteins in an earlier pregnancy, and (3) genetic 
susceptibility that impairs maternal tolerogenic mechanisms.(Braunschweig & Van de Water, 
2012) Both ASD and maternal anti-fetal brain autoantibodies have been independently 
associated with a functional polymorphism in the MET gene that leads to a decreased 
expression of MET receptor tyrosine kinase, suggesting a genetic susceptibility for immune 
dysregulation.(Campbell, Li, Sutcliffe, Persico, & Levitt, 2008; Heuer et al., 2011; Jackson 
et al., 2009) Interestingly, impairments in MET signaling have also been linked to type 2 and 
gestational diabetes in several animal studies.(Araujo et al., 2012; Demirci et al., 2012; 
Fafalios et al., 2011; Mellado-Gil et al., 2011) We are currently investigating whether 
specific MCs are associated with the c-MET ‘C’ allele polymorphism in our study 
population.
MCs and anti-fetal brain autoantibodies
Our findings revealed an association between MCs, particularly gestational diabetes, and 
having anti-fetal brain autoantibodies. Furthermore, the magnitude of these associations 
increased in our subset of mothers whose child exhibited severe ASD symptoms and when 
we used 100% ASD-specific autoantibody combinations. Anti-fetal brain autoantibodies 
have been linked to more intense stereotyped behaviors and greater impairments in 
expressive language in children with ASD.(Braunschweig et al., 2012; Braunschweig et al., 
2013; Piras et al., 2014) Additionally, we have previously observed increased expressive 
language deficits among children with ASD whose mothers had gestational diabetes.
(Krakowiak et al., 2012) Thus, our results extend previous findings in a novel direction.
Moderate overweight (without co-occurring MCs) was also associated with Ab+ status, but 
to our surprise, obesity was not. There are several possible explanations. First, obese 
mothers may have received different prenatal care interventions than overweight women 
(e.g., closer monitoring of weight gain, dietary changes). Second, moderately overweight 
women may have had different exposure profiles of factors or susceptibilities associated 
with both BMI and maternal autoantibodies. We noted that obese women were more likely 
to be of Hispanic ethnicity or non-White race and less likely to have a Bachelor degree or 
IPI <18 months than moderately overweight mothers. Third, obese women may have been 
misclassified as moderately overweight, diluting the association between obesity and

 maternal autoantibodies; however, misclassification alone is unlikely to explain a complete 
lack of an association. Without examining metabolic or immune biomarkers or obtaining 
more accurate BMI assessments, it is difficult to determine exactly how these two BMI 
groups differed; hence, our findings should be interpreted with caution.
Limitations and strengths
Our study had several limitations. First, we had a small sample size of mothers with ASD-
specific autoantibodies and were unable to examine the relationship between Ab+ status and 
combinations of MCs or conditions that were rare (e.g., type 2 diabetes). Our sample size 
was further reduced when we restricted to mothers of children with severe ASD. Thus, we 
conducted robust regression analyses (i.e., Poisson regression with robust error variance) to 
improve the precision of our prevalence ratio estimates and overcome the limitations that 
burden traditional parametric regression models when applied to small sample sizes (e.g., 
sensitivity to outliers). Nonetheless, the possibility of these being chance findings cannot be 
decisively eliminated. Second, maternal samples were collected after the pregnancy of 
interest; consequently, a clear temporal relationship between MCs and anti-fetal brain 
autoantibodies could not be established. Third, we used self-reported MCs for a subset of 
mothers that could have introduced exposure misclassification. However, we relied on 
medical records to determine diagnosis of MCs for >78% of mothers and structured 
telephone interviews for maternal report of MCs; medical record abstractors and 
interviewers were masked to the child’s case status to minimize interviewer bias. We have 
previously shown that maternal report of MCs is highly valid, particularly for diabetes.
(Krakowiak et al., 2015) Still, we could not account for factors that might have influenced 
the physiologic manifestation of these conditions, such as lifestyle (e.g., physical activity, 
diet) and dietary or pharmaceutical interventions. Each condition represents a broad range of 
metabolic function uniquely influenced by genetic predisposition as well as lifestyle and 
pharmaceutical interventions. Therefore, biological markers of metabolic dysregulation 
(e.g., blood levels of insulin or glucose) are needed to characterize the pathological features 
of these conditions more accurately. Finally, unmeasured upstream genetic or environmental 
factors associated with both MCs and ASD-specific autoantibodies may have confounded 
our findings. Given these weaknesses, our preliminary findings need to be interpreted with 
caution.
This study also had noteworthy strengths. ASD diagnosis was confirmed with gold standard 
instruments administered by research-reliable clinicians, thereby minimizing diagnostic 
misclassification. Maternal anti-fetal brain autoantibodies were validated with multiple 
laboratory methods and the patterns of reactivity have been replicated in other populations.
(Croen et al., 2008; Piras et al., 2014; Rossi et al., 2011)
In this exploratory study, we demonstrate associations between MCs, particularly gestational 
diabetes, and having ASD-specific maternal autoantibodies to fetal brain. However, the 
temporal relationship remains unclear between these conditions and maternal production of 
anti-fetal brain autoantibodies. Other limitations include having no biological markers of 
metabolic dysregulation and instead relying on the diagnosis of metabolic conditions in

aMaternal autoantibody status was defined as positive (Ab+) or negative (Ab−) using antigen combinations shown to identify ASD cases with 99% specificity; prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) were estimated by log-linear regression models with robust standard errors adjusted for delivery payer (public vs. private) and maternal smoking during periconception or pregnancy (smoking 
vs. no/unknown)
bMetabolic condition (MC) categories are hierarchical mutually exclusive that were based on the presumed level of metabolic disruption, with metabolic disruption expected to be highest in women with 
type 2 diabetes; mothers with no MCs and with a healthy weight (BMI <25) were the referent for all comparisons; abbreviations: DM2/GDM = Type 2 or Gestational diabetes, HTN/PE = Hypertensive 
disorders (chronic hypertension, preeclampsia or gestational hypertension), BMI ≥30.0 = obese, BMI 27.0–29.9 = moderately overweight, BMI 25.0–26.9 = slightly overweight, BMI <25 = healthy weight 
(6 mothers were underweight [BMI <18.5] and all were Ab−)
cExcluded 6 women with type 2 diabetes (n=2) or chronic hypertension (n=4) from the ‘All ASD’ sample; 5 women with type 2 diabetes (n=2) or chronic hypertension (n=3) were excluded from the 
‘Severe ASD’ subset
