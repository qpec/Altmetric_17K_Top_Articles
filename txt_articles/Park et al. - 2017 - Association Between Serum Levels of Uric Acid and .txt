Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and a 
major cause of disability worldwide.1,2 Cardiovascular disease 
is responsible for approximately one-third of all deaths world-
wide.3 Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular 
disease and mortality.4,5 Prevalence of essential hypertension 
is increasing worldwide, and is now 25% globally.6
The prevalence of pediatric hypertension is increasing, and 
high BP in children and adolescents is an increasingly important 
health problem.7,8 Recent longitudinal studies have reported 
the tracking of BP from infancy to adolescence.9–11 A high BP 
in childhood can lead to hypertension in adulthood.12
Over the past few years, increasing evidence has sup-
ported a role for uric acid in pediatric hypertension.13 Uric 
acid might play a pathogenic role in the intrauterine envi-
ronment, leading to increased BP in later life.14,15 In our pre-
vious study, we suggested that an increased uric acid level in 
infancy might be influenced by maternal and placental fac-
tors considering that other behavioral risk factors are rela-
tively less influential on later health outcomes. Preterm birth 
and low-placental weight were significantly associated with 
increased serum uric acid concentration, which is related to 
high systolic BP (SBP) in very early childhood.16
Exposure to risk factors that threaten the health of an 
individual begins during the prenatal period.17–19 However, 
the level of individual exposure can be modified while liv-
ing. Therefore, although children are born with adverse birth 
conditions (such as preterm or low birth weight), appropri-
ate management to control high BP during childhood may 
help in later life.
We therefore hypothesized that uric acid levels in early 
childhood are dynamic and can affect BP in later life. This 
study investigated the effect of serum uric acid levels in very 
early childhood on the BP tracking of preschool-aged chil-
dren. We also analysed BP according to changes in serum 
uric acid concentrations of the previous period in children 
at 7 years of age.

BACKGROUND
Recent studies suggest that high levels of serum uric acid of very early 
life are a result of the in-utero environment and may lead to elevated 
blood pressure (BP) in adulthood. However, serum uric acid levels can 
change throughout life. We investigated the effect of serum uric acid 
levels in childhood on the BP tracking and analysed BP according to 
changes in serum uric acid levels in early life.
METHODS
A total of 449 children from the Ewha Birth and Growth Cohort study 
underwent at least 2 follow-up examinations. Data were collected 
across 3 check-up cycles. Serum uric acid levels, BP, and anthropometric 
characteristics were assessed at 3, 5, and 7 years of age.
RESULTS
Children with a serum uric acid level higher than the median val-
ues had significantly increased systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP at 
3 years of age. Baseline serum uric acid levels measured at 3 years of 
age, significantly affected subsequent BP in the sex and body mass 
index adjusted longitudinal data analysis (P < 0.05). Considering the 
changing pattern of serum uric acid over time, subjects with high 
uric acid levels at both 3 and 5 years of age had the highest SBP at 
7 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggest the importance of maintaining an adequate 
level of serum uric acids from the early life. Appropriate monitoring and 
intervention of uric acid levels in a high-risk group can reduce the risk 
of a future increased BP.

Park et al.
Seoul, South Korea, between 2001 and 2006. Cohort com-
posed of mothers, who visited to prenatal care between 24 
and 28 weeks of gestation. The first follow-up examination 
was carried out when their children were 3 years of age from 
November 2005 to July 2010. Details of the cohort were 
reported previously.20
This study included 449 subjects who underwent at least 
2 follow-up examinations. Data were collected at check-
ups conducted at 3, 5, and 7 years of age from November 
2005 to July 2014. Those who participated in the follow 
up underwent anthropometric measurements, completed 
questionnaires, and provided blood and urine samples. The 
Institutional Review Board on Human Subjects at Ewha 
Woman’s University approved the study protocol, and 
informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements
All anthropometric and BP measurements were per-
formed by well-trained researchers. Heights and weights 
without shoes and with light clothing were measured to the 
nearest 0.1 cm or 0.1 kg using a stadiometer and calibrated 
scale, respectively (DS-102, Dong Sahn Jenix, Seoul, Korea). 
Body mass index (kg/m2) was calculated as weight divided 
by height squared.
After the subjects had been seated comfortably for 
five minutes, BP was measured twice using an automatic 
blood pressure (BP) monitor (Dinamap Procure 200, GE, 
Milwaukee, WI) with a BP cuff of a size appropriate for the 
circumference of the upper left arm. The Pearson’s correla-
tion coefficients for 2-repeated measure of BP at each time 
point showed moderate positive correlation (SBP, 0.59–0.84; 
diastolic BP (DBP), 0.42–0.64). The average of the 2 meas-
urements was used for statistical analysis.
Assessment of serum uric acid
After an 8-hour overnight fast, blood samples (3 ml 
EDTA–blood and 5 ml serum) were obtained from sub-
jects by venepuncture. Serum uric acid concentrations were 
measured using the uricase and peroxidase-coupled reaction 
method (Equipment: Hitachi Auto-analyser 7600, Fukuoka, 
Japan) in the Clinical Biochemistry Department of the 
Seegene Medical Foundation in Seoul, South Korea. The ref-
erence range for uric acid was 2.4‒7.0 mg/dl.
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed using the SAS version 9.3 
software package (SAS Institutes, Cary, NC). A descriptive 
analysis was performed to summarize the general character-
istics of the participants. We conducted univariate analysis 
between potential factors and BP at 3 years of age to explore 
the confounding factors. As potential confounding factors, 
we considered parental history of hypertension, low birth 
weight, duration of breastfeeding, and sodium intake. But, 
P values of all analysis were >0.2. To assess the effect of uric 
acid on SBP and DBP, we used a general linear model after 
adjusting for sex, current height, and body mass index. 
Results are expressed as adjusted means and 95% confidence 
intervals (95% CI). A post hoc analysis was performed using 
Tukey’s multiple comparison tests. Additionally, we also ana-
lysed the effect of uric acid as tertile level on BP.
To determine the effects of serum uric acid concentrations 
on BP in childhood, a linear mixed-effects model (PROC 
MIXED) analysis was conducted. A compound symme-
try working correlation structure was selected for the final 
model. The random effects were estimated in the repeated-
measures data. A value of P <0.05 based on a 2-tailed test 
was taken to indicate statistical significance.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the subjects at baseline 
and the 3 follow-ups. The proportions of males and females 
were similar. At baseline, 224 (49.9%) of the total 449 par-
ticipants were male, and 225 (50.1%) were female. At 5 years 
of age, 108 (52.4%) were male, and 98 (47.6%) were female. 
At 7 years of age, 87 (49.7%) were male, and 88 (50.3%) 
were female. The mean body mass indexes were 15.4 ± 1.4, 
15.7 ± 1.6, and 16.0 ± 2.1 kg/m2 at 3, 5, and 7 years of age, 
respectively. The mean serum uric acid concentrations at 3, 5,

Uric Acid and Blood Pressure Tracking in Childhood
and 7 years of age were 3.8 ± 0.8, 4.0 ± 0.7, and 3.9 ± 0.9 mg/dl, 
respectively. The SBP and DBP at baseline were 94.7 ± 12.2 
and 60.8 ± 10.4 mm Hg, respectively. SBP tended to increase 
with age, whereas DBP was relatively stable.
Table 2 shows the relationship between uric acid levels at 
3 and 5 years of age and mean SBP and DBP. The subjects 
were divided into 2 subgroups according to their median 
serum uric acid level at 3 or 5 years of age. In the adjusted 
model, the group with a serum uric acid level higher than 
the median value had significantly increased SBP [96.4 mm 
Hg (95% CI, 94.7–98.0) vs. 93.3 mm Hg (95% CI, 91.8–94.8); 
P < 0.01] and DBP [62.3 mm Hg (95% CI, 60.9–63.7) vs. 
59.5 mm Hg (95% CI, 58.2–60.8); P < 0.01] at 3 years of age. 
Children with a uric acid level higher than the median value 
at 3 or 5 years of age had tended to higher both SBP and DBP 
at 7 years of age than those in the group with lower uric acid. 
However, there was no statistical significance.
When analysed stratified by gender, the mean difference 
of SBP at 7 years of age by uric acid level at 3 and 5 years of 
age was notable in boys. But, the effect of uric acid on BP 
was not differed by gender. In addition, when classifying uric 
acid level into tertile groups, children with the highest ter-
tile have higher mean of SBP and DBP compared to children 
with the lowest tertile at 3 years old. But, these results were 
not maintained in BP of subsequent age (data not shown in 
Tables).
A mixed-model analysis revealed that serum uric acid 
concentration at baseline was significantly associated with 
BP in later life (Table 3). SBP (β = 1.17; 95% CI, 0.11–2.23; 
P = 0.03) and DBP (β = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.05–1.69; P = 0.04) 
increased with increasing uric acid levels at 3 years of age. SBP 
(β = 1.98; 95% CI, 0.29–3.66; P = 0.02) and DBP (β = 1.36; 
95% CI, 0.03–2.68; P = 0.04) were higher in children with 
uric acid levels higher than the median value compared with 
in those with levels lower than the median. The group with 
the higher uric acid levels at 5 years of age has increased SBP 
than in their counterparts (P = 0.03).
Figure 1 shows BP vs. uric acid levels. Eight plots show 
the SBPs and DBPs of children 3 and 5 years of age with 
uric acid levels higher and lower than the median value. The 
highest SBP at 7 years of age (mean SBP, 106.4 mm Hg; 95% 
CI, 103.1–109.7; P = 0.03) was detected in subjects with high 
uric acid levels at 3 and 5 years of age. When compared to 
children who had an elevated serum uric acid level at 3 years 
of age but a lower level at 5 years of age, this difference was 
borderline significant according to Tukey’s post hoc test 
(P = 0.07). DBP showed a similar association with uric acid 
levels (mean highest DBP, 61.4 mm Hg; 95% CI, 58.7–64.1; 
P = 0.15).
DISCUSSION
This study investigated the effect of serum uric acid levels 
on longitudinal BP from infancy to childhood. The serum 
uric acid concentration in very early childhood was found to 
influence BP in later life. Considering the change of uric acid 
levels over time, subjects with high uric acid levels at both 3 
and 5 years of age had the highest SBP at 7 years of age. On 
the other hand, children with an elevated serum uric acid 
level at 3 years of age but a lower level at 5 years of age had a 
lower SBP compared with the other groups.
Epidemiological and clinical observation studies over the 
past few decades involving diverse populations have sug-
gested that uric acid is an independent risk factor for hyper-
tension and elevated BP. The Framingham study found that 
serum uric acid levels were significantly positively associ-
ated with changes in SBP and DBP 4 years later.21 In a recent 
study of 3,257 adults in Taiwan, serum uric acid levels were

an independent predictor of BP progression and incidental 
hypertension.22 A systematic review and meta-analysis by 
Peter et al. suggested that hyperuricemia is associated with 
an increased risk of incident hypertension, independent of 
traditional risk factors. Hyperuricemia was associated with 
an increased risk of incident hypertension (pooled adjusted 
risk ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.23–1.58).23
Recent observational studies involving children and ado-
lescents reported a significant relationship between elevated 
serum uric acid levels in children and the progression of 
high BP. In a cross-sectional survey of 6,036 subjects aged 
12–17 years in the United States, increased serum uric acid 
levels were associated with elevated BP in healthy ado-
lescents. The group with an elevated serum uric acid level 
(≥5.5 mg/dl) had a 2.03-fold higher likelihood of having ele-
vated BP compared with those with a serum uric acid level 
of <5.5 mg/dl (95% CI, 1.38–3.00).24 A cohort study of 501 
children aged 6–18 years by Viazzi et al. reported that uric 
acid level was directly related to SBP and DBP after adjusting 
for puberty, gender, and body mass index Z-score.25 Alper 
et al. reported that elevated childhood serum uric acid levels 
are associated with increased BP in childhood, and that this 
persists into adulthood.26
An elevated serum uric acid level in the serum of very 
young children is likely to have been transferred from the 
maternal circulation in-utero. High levels of serum uric acid 
or other placental factors in maternal may be transferred 
into the fetal circulation through the placenta, contributing 
to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and a reduction 
in the number of nephrons.14,15 Previous studies have shown 
that intrauterine growth retardation—such as low birth 
weight or preterm birth—might impair renal development 
and result in a reduced number of nephrons at birth.27–30
In our previous cohort study, we found that preterm birth 
and a subsequent high rate of postnatal weight gain are risk 
factors for increased serum uric acid levels in children at 
3 years of age.16 Feig reported that park et al. suggests a novel 
mechanism for higher BP and increased cardiovascular risk.

Uric Acid and Blood Pressure Tracking in Childhood
An altered intrauterine environment could lead to changes 
in metabolism that induce vascular changes and/or hyper-
tension as childhood progresses.31 Bonamy commented our 
previous study points out a new area of study within the 
developmental programming of cardiovascular disease.32
In this study, we have extended the investigation of the 
effect of serum uric acid level on BP in preschool-aged chil-
dren. Serum uric acid levels at 3 years of age were associated 
with a high BP in later life (P < 0.05). These data confirm 
that serum uric acid levels during very early childhood are 
important for maintaining an adequate BP. Moreover, chil-
dren with elevated serum uric acid levels at 5 years of age 
had an increased risk of an elevated SBP at 7 years of age. 
Therefore, serum uric acid levels in early childhood impact 
BP in later life.
Longitudinal studies conducted in the past few decades 
have tracked BP from childhood to adulthood in diverse 
populations.33,34 Systematic review of data from diverse pop-
ulations suggested moderate BP tracking between childhood 
and adulthood.12 These findings suggests that BP in early life 
is associated with that in later life and underscore the impor-
tance of adequate BP control beginning in infancy.
In the correlation analysis, serum uric acid levels at 
3 years of age were associated with those at 5 and 7 years of 
age (n = 206, Pearson’s r = 0.33, P < 0.0001 at 5 years of age; 
n = 175, Pearson’s r = 0.20, P < 0.01 at 7 years of age). There 
was a significant positive linear correlation between serum 
uric acid levels at 5 and 7 years of age (n = 122, Pearson 
r = 0.45, P < 0.0001; data not shown in Tables). These results 
suggest that there is significant evidence for tracking uric 
acid from childhood into preadolescence. However, the level 
of exposure can change over time. In our analysis, we found 
that serum uric acid levels at 3 and 5 years of age had a com-
bined effect on SBP at 7 years of age. The most vulnerable 
children were those with uric acid levels higher than the 
median value at 3 and 5 years of age. This indicates that an 
elevated uric acid level at both 3 and 5 years of age results in 
a greater risk of increased BP in early childhood. Children 
who had a serum uric acid level greater than the median 
value at 3 years of age but a lower level than the median at 
5 years of age had a significantly lower SBP at 7 years of age 
compared with those with elevated serum uric acid levels at 
both 3 and 5 years of age (Tukey’s post hoc test; P = 0.07). 
Although further research is needed, these findings suggest 
that changes in serum uric acid levels affect BP in childhood.
This study had the following limitations. The relatively 
small sample size may have limited the statistical power 
and may have resulted in selection bias, as participants were 
from a single university hospital. Reduced sample size due 
to follow-up loss would have contributed to a reduction in 
reliability and statistical power. Therefore, further studies are 
warranted to validate our findings in large sample size and 
to suggest appropriate interventions for maintaining serum 
uric acid levels and a normal BP in childhood. This study 
also had several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first 
study of the effect of changing serum uric acid on BP during 
early childhood. Additionally, the baseline serum uric acid 
concentration was significantly associated with later BP at a 
relatively early age. These data are available for use in future 
follow-up studies that aim to identify causal relationships.
The present study suggests the necessity of identify-
ing high-risk individuals in infancy and of intervening 
appropriately. Serum uric acid levels should be appropri-
ately controlled to maintain adequate BP levels in children 
and thereby prevent the development of hypertension in 
adults. Monitoring of the serum uric acid levels in high-
risk children may prevent the development of hyperten-
sion later in life.
