Abstract
Background—Identification of blood biomarkers that prospectively predict progression of 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection to tuberculosis disease may lead to interventions that impact 
the epidemic.
Methods—Healthy, M. tuberculosis infected South African adolescents were followed for 2 
years; blood was collected every 6 months. A prospective signature of risk was derived from 
whole blood RNA-Sequencing data by comparing participants who ultimately developed active 
tuberculosis disease (progressors) with those who remained healthy (matched controls). After 
adaptation to multiplex qRT-PCR, the signature was used to predict tuberculosis disease in 
untouched adolescent samples and in samples from independent cohorts of South African and 
Gambian adult progressors and controls. The latter participants were household contacts of adults 
with active pulmonary tuberculosis disease.
Findings—Of 6,363 adolescents screened, 46 progressors and 107 matched controls were 
identified. A 16 gene signature of risk was identified. The signature predicted tuberculosis 
progression with a sensitivity of 66·1% (95% confidence interval, 63·2–68·9) and a specificity of 
80·6% (79·2–82·0) in the 12 months preceding tuberculosis diagnosis. The risk signature was 
validated in an untouched group of adolescents (p=0·018 for RNA-Seq and p=0·0095 for qRT-
PCR) and in the independent South African and Gambian cohorts (p values <0·0001 by qRT-PCR) 
with a sensitivity of 53·7% (42·6–64·3) and a specificity of 82·8% (76·7–86) in 12 months 
preceding tuberculosis.
Interpretation—The whole blood tuberculosis risk signature prospectively identified persons at 
risk of developing active tuberculosis, opening the possibility for targeted intervention to prevent 
the disease.

Introduction
One-third of the global population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis,1 but <10% 
will progress to active tuberculosis disease during their life time; the majority will remain 
healthy.2–6 Risk of progression is associated with young or old age, co-morbidities such as 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and diabetes mellitus, socio-economic and 
nutritional compromise, and therapy with immune modulatory agents such as tumor necrosis 
factor inhibitors, among others.7,8 It is not possible to predict which M. tuberculosis infected 
individuals will develop active tuberculosis, given current tools. Our aim was to identify 
peripheral blood biomarkers of this disease risk. Knowledge gained could lead to targeted 
antimicrobial therapy to prevent tuberculosis disease, as treating all latently infected persons 
in endemic countries for 6–9 months is not feasible. Other potential applications of 
biomarkers of risk of tuberculosis disease include assessment of response to drug therapy 
and targeted enrollment into efficacy trials of new tuberculosis vaccines and drugs.
Our study evaluated whether global gene expression measured in whole blood of healthy 
persons allows identification of prospective signatures of risk of active tuberculosis disease. 
Previous systems biology approaches have identified diagnostic signatures that discriminate 
tuberculosis disease from latent M. tuberculosis infection and from other disease states.9–20 
For example, Berry, et al., identified and validated a 393 gene signature that allowed 
differentiation of persons with active tuberculosis disease and latent infection.11 Anderson, 
et al., identified and validated a 53 gene signature that distinguished active tuberculosis from 
other diseases in African children with or without HIV infection.13 In contrast to the 
published diagnostic studies, our focus was on prospective signatures of risk that could be 
identified in healthy individuals, up to 2 years before clinical tuberculosis disease manifests. 
Given that one third of the world’s population is latently infected with M. tuberculosis, our 
approach constitutes an opportunity to impact the burden of disease.
Methods
Cohorts and blood collection
Participants from multiple cohorts were included in analysis. First, participants from the 
South African adolescent cohort study (ACS) were evaluated to identify and validate a 
tuberculosis risk signature (Figure 1A). Briefly, 6,363 healthy adolescents, aged 12–18 
years, were enrolled between July 2005 and April 2007; follow-up was completed by 
February 2009 (exclusion criteria and more detail in the Supplementary Appendices). 
Approximately half the participants were evaluated at enrollment and every 6 months during 
2 years follow-up; the other half was evaluated at baseline and at 2 years. At enrollment and 
at each visit, clinical data were collected and 2.5mL blood was collected directly into 
PAXgene blood RNA tubes (PreAnalytiX), which were stored at −20°C.
Only adolescents with latent M. tuberculosis infection at enrollment were included in 
analysis aimed at identification of a tuberculosis risk signature. Latent M. tuberculosis

 infection was diagnosed by a positive QuantiFERON TB GOLD In-Tube Assay (QFT, 
Cellestis; >0·35 IU/mL) and/or a positive tuberculin skin test (TST, 0·1mL dose of Purified 
Protein Derivative RT-23, 2-TU, Staten Serum Institute; >10mm). According to South 
African policy, QFT and/or TST positive adolescents were not given therapy to prevent 
tuberculosis disease.21 Adolescents who developed active tuberculosis disease during 
follow-up were included as “progressors” (cases). Tuberculosis was defined as intrathoracic 
disease, with either two sputum smears positive for acid-fast bacilli or one positive sputum 
culture confirmed as M. tuberculosis complex (mycobacterial growth indicator tube, BD 
BioSciences). For each progressor, two matched controls that remained healthy during 
follow-up were selected and matched by age at enrolment, gender, ethnicity, school of 
attendance, and presence or absence of prior episodes of tuberculosis disease. Participants 
were excluded if they developed tuberculosis disease within 6 months of enrollment to 
exclude early asymptomatic disease that could have been present at the time of evaluation, or 
if they were HIV infected. Prior to analysis, the ACS progressors (cases) and controls were 
randomly divided into training and test sets, at a ratio of 3:1 using the randomization 
function in Microsoft Excel.
The other cohorts consisted of South African and Gambian participants from the Grand 
Challenges 6-74 Study (GC6-74; http://www.case.edu/affil/tbru/collaborations_gates.html), 
who were enrolled between February 2005 and December 2010 to independently validate 
the tuberculosis risk signature (Figure 1B). Briefly, from a parent GC6-74 cohort 4,466 
healthy, HIV-negative persons aged 10–60 years who had household exposure to an adult 
with sputum smear positive tuberculosis disease, 1,197 and 1,948 were enrolled in South 
Africa and The Gambia, respectively (exclusion criteria and more detail in the 
Supplementary Appendices). At baseline, at 6 months (The Gambia only) and at 18 months 
(both sites), participants were evaluated clinically and blood was collected and stored in 
PAXgene tubes as above. Follow-up continued for 2 years, and concluded in November 
2012. Among GC6-74 participants, progressors (cases) had intrathoracic tuberculosis, 
defined on the basis of sputum culture, smear microscopy and clinical signs. For each 
progressor, four controls were matched according to recruitment region, age category (≤18, 
19–25, 26–35, ≥ 36 years), gender and year of enrolment.
The study protocols were approved by relevant human research ethics committees 
(Supplementary Appendix 3). Written informed consent was obtained from participants. For 
adolescents, consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians of adolescents, and 
written informed assent from each adolescent. In both studies, participants with diagnosed or 
suspected tuberculosis disease were referred to a study-independent public health physician 
for treatment according to national tuberculosis control programs of the country involved.
Overview of strategy for identifying and validating the tuberculosis risk signature
Figure 2A shows the analytical approach (detail in sections below). The tuberculosis risk 
signature was derived from mining RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data generated from the 
ACS training set. The RNA-Seq-based tuberculosis risk signature was then adapted to the 
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) platform. The RNA-Seq- and qRT-PCR-based 
signature of risk was validated by blind prediction on untouched samples from the ACS test

 set. The qRT-PCR-based TB risk signature was also validated by blind prediction on 
independent GC6-74 cohort samples from South Africa and The Gambia.
RNA-Seq analysis of the ACS training and test sets
RNA was extracted from PAXgene tubes of the ACS training set. Globin transcript depletion 
(GlobinClear, Life Technologies) was followed by cDNA library preparation using Illumina 
mRNA-Seq Sample Prep Kit. RNA-Seq was performed by Expression Analysis Inc., at 30 
million 50bp paired-end reads, on Illumina HiSeq-2000 sequencers. Read pairs were aligned 
to the hg19 human genome using gsnap22, which generated a table of gene expression 
abundances for each sample. This gene expression abundance was measured at the level of 
splice junction counts, which quantifies the frequency of specific mRNA splicing events in 
expressed genes; this approach would facilitate translation to qRT-PCR. For simplicity, 
splice junction expression levels are referred to as “gene expression levels” throughout.
Generation of the tuberculosis risk signature
The computational strategy employed was an extension of the k-top-scoring pairs (k-TSP) 
methodology, which has been used successfully for identifying cancer biomarkers23,24. The 
k-TSP approach identifies pairs of genes that discriminate better than either gene would 
individually24. We replaced the k-TSP rank-based gene pair models with so-called support 
vector machine (SVM)–based gene pair models for greater flexibility in predictions. This 
modification is similar to the k-TSP modification proposed by Shi et al.25, but holds the 
advantage of retaining the fault-tolerance and parsimony of k-TSP.
For analysis, prospective RNA-Seq data of progressors was realigned to the time point at 
which active tuberculosis was diagnosed (Figure 2B), thereby synchronizing the cohort with 
respect to outcome.
The genes that comprise the final tuberculosis risk signature were selected in two stages, 
using data from the ACS training set. First, a large set of genes was identified by comparing 
gene expression in progressors at the most proximal time point to diagnosis with that in 
matched controls. SVM models were trained on these data points for all possible pairwise 
combinations of risk-associated genes. Second, the models were filtered for predictive 
accuracy using the remaining prospective progressor and control samples. Surviving SVM 
models comprised the tuberculosis risk signature, which computes a “tuberculosis risk 
score” based on blood gene expression levels measured at a single time point. The algorithm 
is fully described in Supplementary Appendix 4.
Adaptation of the tuberculosis risk signature to qRT-PCR
The tuberculosis risk signature was adapted from the original RNA-Seq-based platform to 
qRT-PCR by directly matching splice junctions in the signature to commercial TaqMan 
primer sets (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Supplementary Appendix 4). A complete set of qRT-
PCR data for selected primers was generated for ACS training set samples, using the 
BioMark HD multiplex microfluidic instrument (Fluidigm). Parameters in the qRT-PCR-
based version of the tuberculosis signature were then assigned by fitting the model to the 
dataset.

 Blind prediction of tuberculosis risk in the ACS test set cohort
RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR analysis of samples from the ACS test set were performed as 
described above. Prior to analysis, all test set samples were assigned random numerical 
codes that masked study time points and progressor and control status. Prediction of 
tuberculosis risk on the masked ACS test set samples was then performed in a fully blinded 
manner, in parallel, using RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR-based versions of the signature.
Blind prediction on the independent GC6-74 validation cohorts using the qRT-PCR-based 
signature of risk
qRT-PCR analysis of samples from the South African and Gambian cohorts of GC6-74 was 
performed as described above, >1 year after ACS validation analysis. Prior to analysis, all 
samples were assigned random numerical codes. Fully blinded predictions were then made 
using the qRT-PCR-based signature of risk.
Applying the tuberculosis risk signature to published tuberculosis diagnosis datasets
To allow evaluation of the risk signature for diagnosis of active disease, results from 
published microarray-based studies of active tuberculosis vs. latent disease or other disease 
was used9–13. The signature was adapted from RNA-Seq to the Illumina platform and 
parameterized using tuberculosis cases and latently M. tuberculosis infected controls from 
the UK training cohort of Berry, et al11 (detail in Supplementary Appendix 4). The locked-
down Illumina microarray based risk signature was used to make predictions on the 
independent test and validation cohorts from the Berry, et al. study,11 and from the 
subsequent studies.9,10,12,13

Results
Participants
Forty-six ACS participants with microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis were identified as 
progressors (Figure 1A, Supplementary Table 1). For progressors, the time between sample 
collection and diagnosis with active tuberculosis (“time to diagnosis”) ranged from 1 to 894 
days (Figure 2B, Supplementary Table 2). One hundred and seven controls who were 
infected with M. tuberculosis at enrollment but who remained healthy during 2 years of 
follow-up were matched to progressors. Prior to analysis, progressors and controls were 
randomly divided into a training set of 37 progressors and 77 controls, and a test set of 9 
progressors and 30 controls (Figure 1A and 2A).
GC6-74 participants were household contacts of newly diagnosed index cases with 
pulmonary tuberculosis disease (Figure 1B). Two GC6-74 sites, South Africa and The 
Gambia, had sufficient numbers of progressors and controls to allow analysis, and were 
therefore included in this study (Figure 1B and 2A). A total of 43 progressors and 172

 controls were identified at the South African site, while 30 progressors and 129 controls 
were identified at the Gambian site (Figure 1B, Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).
Construction of the tuberculosis risk signature from the ACS training set
RNA was isolated from all progressor and matched control samples of the ACS training set 
and analyzed by RNA-Seq (Figure 2A and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Data mining of 
the RNA-Seq data derived a candidate signature of risk for tuberculosis disease progression. 
The signature comprised paired splice junction data from 16 genes (Supplementary Figure 
1A and Supplementary Tables 7–9 and 11). Expression of signature genes in samples from 
progressors increased as tuberculosis diagnosis approached (Figure 3A). Robust 
discrimination between progressors and controls based on the expression of the gene pairs in 
the signature was readily apparent (Figure 3B).
The predictive potential of the tuberculosis risk signature was demonstrated within the ACS 
training set by cross-validation (Figure 2A); the risk signature achieved 71·2% sensitivity in 
the 6 month period immediately prior to diagnosis, and 62·9% sensitivity 6–12 months 
before diagnosis, at a specificity of 80·6% (Figure 3C and Table 1). During the 12–18 month 
period prior to diagnosis, the signature achieved 47·7% sensitivity.
Validation of the signature of risk on the ACS test set
To facilitate broad application, the tuberculosis risk signature was adapted to a practical 
platform, qRT-PCR (Figure 2A and Supplementary Tables 13 and 14). The RNA-Seq and 
qRT-PCR versions of the tuberculosis risk signature were used to predict tuberculosis risk in 
the heretofore untouched ACS test set samples. This was done in a fully blinded manner, 
with all sample meta-data masked prior to making predictions. The ability of both versions 
of the signature to predict tuberculosis progression in healthy subjects was validated (Figure 
3D and Table 2).
To determine whether inclusion of a larger number of genes would have increased accuracy 
of predictions, the performance of a random forest-based classifier comprised of 631 genes 
was assessed; the outcome was equivalent to when the tuberculosis risk signature was used 
for classification (Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 15)
Validation of the tuberculosis risk signature on the independent GC6-74 cohorts
For independent validation, the qRT-PCR-based signature was used to predict tuberculosis 
progression using samples collected from healthy participants in the GC6-74 adult 
household contact cohorts from South Africa and The Gambia (Figure 2A). Predictions were 
made in a blinded manner. The ability of the signature to predict tuberculosis progression in 
healthy subjects did validate in these independent cohorts, regardless of whether these were 
analyzed individually or collectively (p<0·0001; Figure 3E and Table 2). As for the ACS, the 
signature had greater sensitivity for predicting tuberculosis in samples collected closer to the 
time of diagnosis (Figure 3F, Table 2).

 Performance of risk signatures for diagnosis of tuberculosis and for response to therapy
Since the sensitivity of the tuberculosis risk signature increased as the time of diagnosis 
approached, we evaluated performance of the risk signature for diagnosis of active 
tuberculosis disease. We performed these analyses after adapting the signature to Illumina 
microarrays, using data from the UK training cohort of Berry, et al.11 (Supplementary Figure 
3A and Supplementary Table 17), which enabled use of published datasets9–13. The 
signature readily differentiated active tuberculosis from latent infection in adult cohorts from 
the UK, South Africa, and Malawi, including populations that were co-infected with HIV 
(Supplementary Figure 3B–C and Supplementary Table 17). The signature also 
discriminated active tuberculosis from other pulmonary diseases (Supplementary Figure 
3D–E and Supplementary Table 17). Despite being derived from adolescents, the signature 
discriminated active, culture confirmed, tuberculosis from latent M. tuberculosis infection 
and from other diseases in childhood (Supplementary Figure 3F–G and Supplementary 
Table 17). Finally, applying the signature to data from a treatment study9 showed that the 
active tuberculosis signature gradually disappears during 6 months of therapy 
(Supplementary Figure 3H and Supplementary Table 17).
Discussion
Approximately one third of the world’s population may harbour latent M. tuberculosis 
infection and is at risk of active disease. We have identified a gene expression signature for 
predicting risk of tuberculosis disease progression. This signature was discovered in a 
longitudinal analysis of South African adolescents with latent M. tuberculosis infection who 
either developed tuberculosis disease or remained healthy. The signature was then validated 
on blinded samples from untouched adolescents of the same parent cohort. The signatures 
were again validated, in independent cohorts of longitudinally followed household contacts 
of tuberculosis disease patients from South Africa and The Gambia, who either developed 
tuberculosis disease or remained healthy. These results demonstrate that it is possible to 
predict progression from latent to active disease, using whole blood gene expression 
measurements at any single time point up to 18 months before tuberculosis disease 
manifests.
The tuberculosis risk signature was discovered using RNA-Seq, a transcriptome analysis 
technology that is quantitative, sensitive, and unbiased.26 The signature was formulated 
using a framework termed SVM, an extension of the k-TSP approach23 which robustly 
generates a tuberculosis risk score from gene expression data, using simple arithmetics 
(Supplementary Table 11). The signature was adapted from RNA-Seq to qRT-PCR, a more 
targeted and affordable technology. The power of the approach was demonstrated by blinded 
validation of the qRT-PCR-based signature in the independent cohorts.
The tuberculosis risk signature predicted tuberculosis disease progression despite marked 
diversity between the ACS and GC6-74 cohorts. This result is encouraging given the 
different age ranges (adolescents versus adults), different infection or exposure status, 
distinct ethnicity and genetic backgrounds,27,28 differing local epidemiology,1 and differing 
circulating strains of M. tuberculosis29 between South Africa and The Gambia. It is 
conceivable that distinct mechanisms of progression will be revealed when specific sub-

 groups of progressors are analysed (e.g., early vs. late progressors in GC6-74). Targeted 
analyses to identify distinct mechanisms of progression are underway.
To explore potential application of the signature for targeted preventive therapy, we 
estimated the relative risk for tuberculosis disease between signature positive and negative 
persons from a representative adult population from South Africa, where tuberculosis is 
endemic. The relative risk of tuberculosis disease is approximately 2 when IGRA or TST is 
used30, whereas the relative risk using our risk signature was between 6 and 14. Moreover, 
this risk signature would aid in detection of asymptomatic and or undiagnosed tuberculosis 
disease. For example, when applied to combined data from 4 studies of HIV uninfected 
South African adults9–12, involving 130 prevalent tuberculosis cases and 230 controls, the 
signature discriminated between active tuberculosis patients and uninfected or tuberculosis 
infected healthy controls with 87% sensitivity and 97% specificity.
Although our focus was on prospective prediction of tuberculosis disease, we also showed 
that the risk signature was excellent for differentiating tuberculosis disease from latent 
infection and from other disease states. This ability to diagnose tuberculosis disease was not 
markedly impacted by HIV status. The risk signature could also diagnose culture positive 
childhood tuberculosis, but not culture negative childhood disease.31 These results suggest 
that the risk signature might reflect bacterial load in the lung, as culture positive childhood 
tuberculosis is likely associated with higher bacterial loads, compared with culture negative 
disease. An association between the risk signature and bacterial load was further supported 
by meta-analysis of a published treatment study9, in which the signature relaxed during 6 
months of antimicrobial therapy. It is presently not known whether the risk signature will be 
useful for predicting treatment failure or recurrence.
While enrichment analysis of published blood signatures for active tuberculosis implicates a 
variety of biological processes in the disease, the gene module “interferon response” was the 
sole module that was over-represented in the risk signature (Supplementary Tables 19–21). 
Overlap between 15 of the 16 genes in our prospective TB risk signature and the 393 gene 
signature of active tuberculosis disease from Berry, et al.11 suggests that chronic peripheral 
activation of the interferon response precedes the onset of active disease and the 
inflammatory manifestations of tuberculosis disease revealed by previously published gene 
expression studies9–13. Although additional research is required to understand the functional 
role of interferon responses during tuberculosis progression, pathogen induction of type I 
interferons and their detrimental effects on immunity to tuberculosis have been shown in 
several in vivo studies in mice32–34 and in in vitro experiments of human cells.35 
Nevertheless, not all interferon response genes may be associated with a poor outcome, as 
we showed that genes such as GBP1, STAT1, and TAP1 may play a protective role during 
tuberculosis infection (Supplementary Table 18).
Our predictive signature was obtained from transcriptomic analysis of peripheral whole 
blood. This compartment, although conveniently sampled, may not accurately reflect 
pathogenic events in the lung, primarily affected by tuberculosis disease. Regardless, 
circulating white blood cells can serve as sentinels of lung pathophysiology, as 
transcriptional changes occur when the cells migrate through this organ. To explore a

 possible cell-type specific origin of the risk signature, we used data from published global 
gene expression in whole blood and sorted PBMC, monocytes, neutrophils, and T cells from 
healthy controls and tuberculosis patients10. Differential expression of the risk signature 
genes between healthy controls and tuberculosis patients was comparable in whole blood 
and PBMC (Supplementary Table 22), suggesting that contribution of granulocytes to the 
risk signature is redundant. Consistent with this result, comparable differential expression of 
risk signature genes was observed in monocytes and neutrophils. When compared to the 
diagnostic signature of Berry, et al.11, reported to be derived from neutrophils, these results 
suggest that progression to active tuberculosis involves more diverse cell types.
To date, Sloot, et al.36 published the only report of prospective associations between blood 
gene expression and tuberculosis disease risk. Using a pre-defined 141 gene panel, PBMC 
RNA expression in 15 HIV infected drug users who ultimately developed active tuberculosis 
disease was compared with 16 who did not develop tuberculosis. Four genes assayed 
exhibited nominal expression differences (unadjusted p<0·05) and, when combined, two 
genes, IL-13 and AIRE, fit the data (ROC AUC fit = 0·8). The association between these 
genes and tuberculosis progression was not validated in a test set or independent cohort; 
none of the four genes exhibited differences between progressors and controls in our whole 
blood RNA-Seq datasets.
Our results, demonstrating that blood-based signatures in healthy individuals can predict 
progression to active tuberculosis disease, pave the way for the establishment of diagnostic 
tools that are scalable and inexpensive. An important first step would be to test whether the 
signature can predict tuberculosis disease in the general population, rather than the select 
populations included in this project; for example, the risk of TB disease in our populations 
was much higher than the lifetime risk of 10% encountered in the general population. The 
newly described signature holds potential for highly targeted preventive therapy, and 
therefore for interrupting the global epidemic.

 Figure 2. Strategy for discovery and validation of the tuberculosis risk signature
(A) Flow diagram for the discovery and validation of the tuberculosis risk signature. The 
tuberculosis risk signature was obtained by data mining of a whole blood RNA-Seq dataset 
generated from the ACS training set. The predictive potential of the risk signature was 
evaluated by rigorous cross-validation. The tuberculosis risk signature was adapted to qRT-
PCR, and then the RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR versions of the signature were employed to 
predict tuberculosis progression using untouched blinded samples from the ACS test set. 
The qRT-PCR-based tuberculosis risk signature was then employed to predict tuberculosis

of GC6-74. (B) Synchronization of the ACS training set in terms of the clinical outcome. To 
ensure optimal extraction of a tuberculosis risk signature from the ACS training set, the time 
scale of the RNA-Seq dataset was re-aligned according to tuberculosis diagnosis instead of 
study enrolment, allowing gene expression differences to be measured before disease 
diagnosis. Each progressor within the ACS training set is represented by a horizontal bar. 
The length of the bar represents the number of days between study enrolment and diagnosis 
with active tuberculosis. During follow-up, each progressor transitioned from an 
asymptomatic healthy state (green) to pulmonary disease (red). Left side: alignment of 
PAXgene sample collection (black points) with respect to study enrolment. Right side: 
alignment of PAXgene sample collection with respect to diagnosis with active tuberculosis, 
for use in analysis.
