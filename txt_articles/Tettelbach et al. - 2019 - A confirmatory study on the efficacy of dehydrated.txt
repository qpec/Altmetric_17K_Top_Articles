A randomised, controlled multicentre clinical trial was conducted at 14 wound care
centres in the United States to confirm the efficacy of dehydrated human amnion/
chorion membrane allograft (dHACM) for the treatment of chronic lower extremity
ulcers in persons with diabetes. Patients with a lower extremity ulcer of at least
4 weeks duration were entered into a 2-week study run-in phase and treated with
alginate wound dressings and appropriate offloading. Those with less than or equal
to 25% wound closure after run-in were randomly assigned to receive weekly
dHACM application in addition to offloading or standard of care with alginate
wound dressings, for 12 weeks. A total of 110 patients were included in the intent-
to-treat (ITT) analysis, with n = 54 in the dHACM group and n = 56 in the no-
dHACM group. Of the participants, 98 completed the study per protocol, with
47 receiving dHACM and 51 not receiving dHACM. The primary study outcome
was percentage of study ulcers completely healed in 12 weeks, with both ITT and
per-protocol participants receiving weekly dHACM significantly more likely to
completely heal than those not receiving dHACM (ITT—70% versus 50%,
P = 0.0338, per-protocol—81% versus 55%, P = 0.0093). A Kaplan–Meier analy-
sis was performed to compare the time-to-healing performance with/without
dHACM, showing a significantly improved time to healing with the use of allo-
graft, log-rank P < 0.0187. Cox regression analysis showed that dHACM-treated
subjects were more than twice as likely to heal completely within 12 weeks than
no-dHACM subjects (HR: 2.15, 95% confidence interval 1.30–3.57, P = 0.003).
At the final follow up at 16 weeks, 95% of dHACM-healed ulcers and 86% of
healed ulcers in the no-dHACM group remained closed. These results confirm that
dHACM is an efficacious treatment for lower extremity ulcers in a heterogeneous
patient population.

INTRODUCTION
Diabetic foot complications, such as ulcerations, infections,
and gangrene, are a common cause of hospitalisation, ampu-
tations, and disability among diabetic patients. Routine ulcer
care, treatment of infections, amputations, and hospitalisa-
tions cost billions of dollars every year in the United States
alone and place tremendous burdens on health care systems
worldwide.1–3 Over their lifetime, up to 34% of people with
diabetes may develop lower extremity ulcers, and an esti-
mated 12% of those patients will ultimately require lower
extremity amputation.4,5 Concomitant conditions associated
with diabetes, such as peripheral vascular disease, neuropa-
thy, and poor blood glucose controls, as well as other often-
present comorbidities, contribute to the slow healing rates
and high rates of recurrence of these wounds. An estimated
40% of diabetic patients have a recurrence within 1 year after
ulcer healing.4 Slow healing of lower extremity ulcers
increases the risk of infection and potential for amputation.
More than 80, 000 amputations are performed each year on
diabetic patients in the United States.1 Ulcers precede 85%
of lower extremity amputations in persons with diabetes, and
it is estimated that up to 85% of these amputations may be
preventable.6
Successful treatment of a lower extremity ulcer in a per-
son with diabetes requires teamwork between a skilled and
observant clinician and a compliant and motivated patient.
Standard first-line management of diabetic foot ulcers
(DFUs) includes moist dressings, debridement, offloading of
weight-bearing ulcers, infection prevention, and patient edu-
cation on proper foot care, yet even with the best conserva-
tive care, many months of treatment may be required before
an ulcer heals.7 Guidelines suggest that advanced wound
therapies be incorporated into the treatment plan if an ulcer
does not reduce in size by at least 40% after 4 weeks of stan-
dard wound therapy.8
Clinicians seek advanced treatments that encourage rapid
and complete healing of wounds in order to reduce the risk
for infection and associated morbidities. Advanced treatment
for diabetic lower extremity ulcers includes collagen, biolog-
ical dressings and skin equivalents, platelet-derived growth
factors (PDGF), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), silver products,
negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), and hyperbaric
oxygen therapy (HBO2).5 There is little consensus as to
which advanced therapy provides the greatest benefit in rates
of complete healing and time to wound closure. Indeed, a
systematic review of randomised controlled trials published
in 2013 found a discouragingly low strength of evidence
regarding the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of
advanced wound care therapies for treatment of lower
extremity ulcers.5 Yet, since the publication of that system-
atic review, there have been multiple publications with high-
level evidence reporting the results of randomised controlled
studies on the use of a dehydrated human amnion/chorion
membrane (dHACM) allograft (EpiFix, MiMedx Group Inc.,
Marietta, Georgia) for the treatment of lower extremity
ulcers.9–11
Level 1 evidence examining the efficacy of dHACM as a
treatment for DFUs, in addition to wound offloading, has
reported statistically significant superior rates of complete
healing and a more rapid time to healing when dHACM is
incorporated into the treatment plan, compared with standard
wound care and offloading alone.9 Two additional Level
1 comparative effectiveness studies have shown the superi-
ority of dHACM, when compared with another bioengi-
neered skin substitute (BSS) and a standard care group, in
healing at 6 weeks and at 12 weeks.10,11 While the results of
the previous Level 1 dHACM studies were impressive, there
were only four treating clinicians and study sites over a lim-
ited geographic area. The purpose of the present study is to
further confirm the efficacy of using the dHACM allograft
as a treatment for chronic diabetic lower extremity ulcers
when administered by a wider variety of clinicians at multi-
ple locations with a more heterogeneous patient population.

A prospective, randomised, controlled, multicentre clinical
trial was conducted to evaluate healing outcomes in diabetic
patients with chronic lower extremity ulcers treated with
weekly application of dHACM as an adjunct to standard
wound care and offloading or standard wound care and off-
loading alone. The study population consisted of patients

 with diabetes receiving care from clinicians specialising in
wound care at 14 outpatient centres in the United States.
All patients signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-
approved informed consent form prior to any study-related
procedures in compliance with applicable regulatory require-
ments. The study was conducted under the guidelines of
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in accordance with the
provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. Tissue products
used in the study were manufactured, handled, and stored in
accordance with applicable Good Tissue Practices (GTP).
The study was reviewed and approved by Chesapeake IRB
or a site's local IRB and was pre-registered in ClinicalTrials.
gov (NCT01693133). Study records were retained in locked
files at each study site, and patient confidentiality was main-
tained. Only minimally necessary data were collected on
study subjects, and subject identifiers were limited.

Patient screening and eligibility
The study population was comprised of patients diagnosed
with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes presenting to a study site for
care of a lower extremity ulcer below the level of the ankle.
Willing participants in the clinical study who agreed to com-
ply with the weekly visits and follow-up regimen were eligi-
ble for study inclusion. Study inclusion and exclusion
criteria listed in Table 1 were used to determine patients eli-
gible to enter a 2-week study run-in period prior to study
enrolment and randomisation. The 2-week run-in period was
used to identify subjects who were eligible to proceed to the
treatment phase of the study. During the 2-week run-in
period, patients were instructed on proper techniques for
dressing changes as needed and wound offloading. They
were provided with alginate dressings, absorbent non-
adhesive hydropolymer secondary dressings, gauze, and an
offloading device (cam walker, offloading boot, shoe, or
complete contact cast) as determined appropriate by the pri-
mary investigator for their wound location and expected
level of compliance. During the run-in period, patients were
seen weekly at the clinic for wound cleansing, sharp debride-
ment, and wound measurements. At the conclusion of the
run-in period, only those patients whose wounds had
reduced in size by no greater than 25% were allowed to enter
the treatment phase of the study.
2.2

Treatment phase of study
After the run-in period, subjects demonstrating a reduction
in wound size of 25% or less who still met all study inclu-
sion/exclusion criteria were enrolled in the treatment phase
of the study. At enrolment in the treatment phase, patients
were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive a weekly applica-
tion of dHACM (dHACM group) directly to the wound, in
addition to absorbent non-adhesive hydropolymer secondary
dressings and gauze, or to receive only standard wound
dressings with alginate dressings, absorbent non-adhesive
hydropolymer secondary dressings, and gauze, (no-dHACM
group). Wounds continued to be offloaded in both study
groups. Randomisation was conducted at each study site
through sequentially numbered and sealed opaque enve-
lopes. Group assignments were verified and monitored by
the study sponsor (MiMedx Group Inc.). Neither the treating
physician nor the patient was blinded to group assignment,
but study adjudicators who examined photographic images
for validation of healing at completion of the study were
blinded as to group assignment.

 Study visits during the treatment phase occurred weekly
for up to 12 weeks. At each study visit, the subject was
assessed for adverse events. The study ulcer was cleansed
and sharp debridement performed (if wound had not healed).
In the dHACM group, a wound size-appropriate allograft
was applied to the debrided wound bed and then hydrated
with several drops of sterile saline (if necessary). The wound
was then dressed with a non-adherent silicone dressing and
an absorbent non-adhesive hydropolymer secondary dress-
ing and wrapped with gauze. Subjects in the no-dHACM
group had their wounds cleansed, debrided, and dressed with
a standard alginate dressing and an absorbent non-adhesive
hydropolymer secondary dressing and wrapped with gauze.
Dressings were changed weekly at the study site unless they
became wet or soiled. If additional dressing changes were
required in the treatment group, only the outer dressings
were changed. In both study groups, wounds were similarly
offloaded during all phases of the study. Ulcer measure-
ments were performed after cleansing and debridement using
the SilhouetteStar camera and Silhouette Connect system.

Validation of healing
Complete reepithelialisation of the wound without drainage
or need for dressing was used as the definition for complete
healing. For statistical analysis, final study outcomes regard-
ing wound reduction, time to healing, and healing status
were determined via adjudication. At study completion, after
the final visit at week 16, all photographic images taken after
debridement with the Silhouette system, blinded to group
assignment, study sites, and treating clinician, were reviewed
by three independent physicians specialising in wound care
who did not enrol patients into the study. The adjudication
was performed as a group, and the determination of timing
of complete epithelialisation was reached by consensus of
the adjudicators. During the adjudication process, the level
and consistency of debridement was also evaluated.
2.4
|
Study outcomes
Primary study outcome was the incidence of complete
wound closure at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included
time to healing and incidence of ulcer recurrence at the site
of the study ulcer during the follow-up phase.
2.5

Statistical analysis
The nQuery Advisor 7.01 was used for to determine the
number of study subjects to provide sufficient statistical
power for the primary endpoint. The sample size calculation
was based on the assumption that there is a difference of
35% between the two treatment groups in the percentage of
healed subjects.
Under the above assumptions, at least 35 subjects per
treatment group were required to meet the Type I error rate
(P-value) of 0.05 and 85% power of a total of 70 subjects for
the study. To accommodate for potential discontinuations
and study dropouts and to make the study more clinically
relevant, we sought to enrol a minimum of 100 subjects.
The study hypothesis tested was that the use of dHACM
offers a statistically significant advantage over standard care
alone for the treatment of lower extremity ulcers in patients
with diabetes. Study variables were summarised as means
and SDs for continuous variables unless the data were
non-normal, in which case medians were also reported.
Proportions/percentages were reported for categorical vari-
ables. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used as
appropriate.
Student's
t-test,
analysis
of
covariance
(ANCOVA), or the Kruskal–Wallis test was used to test for
differences in continuous variables. For categorical vari-
ables, χ2 or Fisher’s exact tests were performed to test for
statistical differences. Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox pro-
portional hazards regression modelling was performed, with
two-sided P-values < 0.05 considered significant. Regres-
sion modelling included fixed effects for treatment, as well
as patient demographics, medical history, and ulcer charac-
teristics as covariates. SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
North Carolina) was used to perform statistical testing. A
modified intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed. Sub-
jects were only excluded from analysis if they were deemed
ineligible after randomisation or never started the assigned
treatment. Subjects not completing the study because of
early withdrawal or lost to follow up had their last observa-
tion carried forward. In order to better assess differences in
treatment outcomes, additional analysis was performed on
the population completing the study per protocol.

RESULTS
Study subjects were enrolled at 14 study sites in the United
States. Study sites were located in California, Virginia,
Ohio, Texas, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Alabama, and both
hospital-based and private clinic settings in urban and rural
areas were represented. As indicated in the CONSORT flow
diagram (Figure 1), a total of 218 subjects were screened
and entered the study for the 2-week run-in period between
October 2014 and June 2017. At the conclusion of the run-in
period, there were 92 patients no longer eligible for randomi-
sation because of >25% reduction in wound size or no lon-
ger meeting study inclusion/exclusion criteria. A total of
126 subjects were randomised, 63 to the dHACM group and
63 to the standard of care, no-dHACM group. Sixteen rando-
mised subjects were excluded prior to data analysis because
of identification of factors, which should have precluded
randomisation, including a wound smaller than 1 cm2 at ini-
tial screening, wound infection/osteomyelitis/cellulitis/necro-
sis at enrolment, or charcot abnormality. After these
exclusions, there were 110 subjects meeting study inclusion
criteria included in the ITT analysis. Fifty-four had been ran-
domised to receive dHACM (dHACM group), while 56 had

 been randomised to receive continuation of standard care
without dHACM (no-dHACM group). Of these 110 subjects,
98 completed the study per protocol (47/54 in the dHACM
group and 51/56 in the no-dHACM group).
Patient demographics and pertinent medical history are
presented in Table 2. Underscoring the risk factors for poor
healing in the study population, 73% of the study population
was male, 67% were obese, 37% were smokers, 40% con-
sumed alcohol, 33% had an A1c ≥ 9%, and 25% had a prior
amputation. Characteristics of the study ulcers are presented
for each study group in Table 3. Overall, 61% of study ulcers
were plantar, with a median duration of 14 (range 4, 96)
weeks at study enrolment. Plantar ulcers were less prevalent
in the dHACM group than in the no-dHACM group.

Study outcomes
In the ITT analysis, at the end of the 12-week treatment
phase,
70%
(38/54)
of
dHACM-treated
ulcers
had
completely healed, a significantly greater number compared
with 50% (28/56) of healed ulcers in the no-dHACM group
(P = 0.0338). For those subjects completing the study per
protocol, healing rates at 12 weeks were 81% (38/47) for
those in the dHACM group and 55% (28/51) for those not
receiving dHACM (P = 0.0093). Through the evaluation of
Silhouette wound images captured after debridement during
the treatment phase of the study, adjudicators determined
that, overall, 95 of 110 (86%) study ulcers had been ade-
quately debrided. Inadequate debridement occurred in 9 of
54 (17%) and 6 of 50 (11%) of dHACM and no-dHACM
treated wounds, respectively. Of the 38 healed wounds trea-
ted with dHACM during the 12-week treatment phase, 36 of
38 (95%) remained closed at the week 16 follow up, while
24 of the 28 wounds healed without dHACM (86%) had
remained closed.
The median number of grafts applied per healed wound
was 5 (range 1–12). The median cost per dHACM healed
ulcer
was
$2252.33
(range
$306.95–12, 394.02).
The
dHACM allograft is available in multiple sizes to reduce
waste through the ability of applying a wound size-
appropriate graft. Of the 227 allografts applied, 190 (83%)
were 14 mm or 18 mm grafts.

Cox regression modelling
Cox regression modelling, a multivariate assessment control-
ling all factors and measuring the impact of each specific
variable in the model, was performed to examine patient
demographics, medical history, ulcer characteristics, and
clinical treatment influencing ulcer healing within the
12-week treatment period. Covariates were entered as a
block into the Cox regression model: dHACM treatment
group,
patient
age ≥ 65 years,
presence
of
obesity,
A1c ≥ 9%, smoking, alcohol use, Caucasian race, Hispanic
ethnicity, male gender, history of cardiovascular abnormality,
history of prior recurrent ulcers, history of amputation, ulcer
duration ≥14 weeks, baseline wound size ≥2.2 cm2, lack of
adequate debridement of ulcer during the study period,
wound location, and wound position. Table 4 shows the cor-
responding hazard ratios (HRs) for the covariates in the ini-
tial model. Refinement of the model was then performed
through elimination of stepwise covariates with descending
P-values. The final model includes only those covariates
found to be significantly associated with complete ulcer
healing. The definitive Cox regression results and corre-
sponding HRs are presented in Table 5. In the population

on healing during the 12-week study period included larger
ulcer size, history of recurring ulcers, and inadequate wound
debridement.

A Kaplan–Meier plot of time to heal within 12 weeks by
study group demonstrated a superior wound-healing trajec-
tory
for
dHACM-treated
ulcers
compared with lower
extremity ulcers not receiving dHACM and being treated
with standard care alone. The log-rank test of equality of the
healing function over the two study groups produced a χ2
test statistic of 5.5294, with a P = 0.0187 (Figure 2).

Adverse events
All 126 subjects randomised were followed for evaluation of
safety. An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical
event, including any unfavourable and unintended sign, symp-
tom, or disease occurring during study enrolment, but which
may not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treat-
ment. All adverse events, even those not related to the study
ulcer or study procedures, were captured and reviewed. All
adverse events were reviewed by site investigators and a Clini-
cal Events Committee including the study sponsor to deter-
mine if the event was product or study related. Overall, there
were 230 adverse events recorded. The most common adverse
event was development of an additional ulcer (n = 34). A total
of 112 adverse events occurred in subjects receiving dHACM
and 118 in subjects not receiving dHACM. Fifty-three adverse
events (23%) were ulcer-related. In the dHACM-treated sub-
jects, 30 adverse events were ulcer-related. In subjects not
receiving dHACM, 23 events were ulcer-related. Of the
53 ulcer-related events, 30 were infectious events. There
were 11 target ulcer infections (6 dHACM-treated and
5 no-dHACM), 15 cases of cellulitis (7 dHACM-treated and
8 no-dHACM), and 4 cases of osteomyelitis (3 dHACM-
treated and 1 no-dHACM). There were three events classified
as possibly being product related. These included one case of
wound maceration and two positive wound cultures (1 Provi-
dencia Stuartii, 1 Pseudomonas Aeruginosa).

 greater rates of complete healing and healed more rapidly
than wounds treated with standard care alone. These results
confirm the findings of previous studies examining the
efficacy of dHACM for the treatment of diabetic lower
extremity ulcers.9–11
A chronic wound develops when the normal healing pro-
cess of haemostasis, inflammation, fibroplasia, epithelialisa-
tion, and maturation is disrupted or stalled. Underlying
disorders, such as peripheral artery disease, diabetes, venous
insufficiency, nutritional deficiencies, and other disease
states and comorbidities, as well as patient habits such as
smoking, alcohol and/or drug abuse, obesity, poor hygienic
practices, and non-compliance with clinical recommenda-
tions, all contribute to non-healing and the development of a
chronic wound.12 Appreciation of these factors is necessary
when a clinician is determining a treatment plan and/or eval-
uating the results of a therapeutic intervention. Clinicians
must also acknowledge that their own preferences, skills,
and level of expertise play a role in ulcer healing. To pro-
mote healing, a healthy ulcer environment must be created
by removal of necrotic tissue, management of bioburden,
and
maintenance
of
an
appropriate
moisture
balance.
Methods and thoroughness of debridement as well as chosen
topical products, advanced treatments, and dressings all
influence healing outcomes.
The requirement for successful healing is characterised
by a tissue microenvironment with high levels of bioactive
proteins, such as growth factors and other soluble mediators
of cell signalling, functional fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and
vascular endothelial cells, as well as controlled levels of pro-
teases and bacteria.13 Persistent inflammation, cell senes-
cence, growth factor deficiencies, high levels of bioburden,
elevated concentrations of destructive proteases, and stem
cell deficiencies are characteristics inherent of chronic
wounds.13
Advanced
wound
care
products,
such
as
dHACM, can ameliorate these destructive properties that are
often present in chronic wounds; provide an opportunity for
more rapid and complete healing, which reduces the risk for
significant morbidity associated with infection; and may
very well reduce health care costs.
ELISA assays performed on samples of dHACM have
shown quantifiable levels of vascular endothelial growth fac-
tor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factors AA and BB
(PDGF-AA and PDGF- BB), transforming growth factors
alpha and beta (TGFα and TGFβ1), basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and granulo-
cyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF).14 Interleukins 4, 6,
8, and 10; Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases (TIMPs)
1, 2, and 4; and signalling molecules, including 14 cytokines
and 10 chemokines known to regulate inflammation and
12 cytokines known to regulate wound-healing processes,
have also been identified in dHACM.15
Quantifiable levels of the angiogenic cytokines angio-
genin and angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2) have also been measured
in dHACM.16 The dHACM allograft has been shown to pro-
mote amplification of angiogenic cues by inducing endothe-
lial cell proliferation and migration and by upregulating the
production of endogenous angiogenic growth factors by
endothelial cells. Laboratory studies have shown that subcu-
taneous dHACM implants displayed a steady increase in
microvessels over a period of 4 weeks, indicative of a
dynamic intra-implant neovascular process.16 SDF-1, a fac-
tor that has been shown to recruit stem cells, is known to be
deficient in diabetic wounds,17 yet in vitro and in vivo stud-
ies have confirmed that the dHACM allograft can stimulate
the migration of mesenchymal stem cells to a wound, as well
as bone marrow-derived haematopoietic stem cells.18
An initial feasibility study of dHACM as a treatment for
lower extremity ulcers in 25 patients with diabetes con-
ducted in 2012 and 2013 at a single centre was able to dem-
onstrate reasonable safety and effectiveness of the allograft.9
Results showed a large effect size compared with standard
care, with healing rates of 77% versus 0% at week 4 and
92% versus 8% at week 6 for dHACM (n = 13) and standard
care (n = 12), respectively.9 In another randomised con-
trolled trial, dHACM was compared with BSS and standard
care without dHACM.11 The study was conducted in
2014 at four study sites, three being in Virginia and one in
Oklahoma, with efficacy at 12 weeks reported.11 In that
comparative effectiveness study, healing rates of 73% with
BSS (n = 33), 97% with dHACM (n = 32), and 51% with
standard care (n = 35) were reported at week 12, adjusted
P = 0.00019.11 The results of these prior studies can be con-
sidered extreme outliers when compared with results of other
advanced products in the wound-healing literature, and these
early studies have been criticised for having a small sample
size, a narrow geographical distribution, few study sites, and
homogeneity of patients and providers. However, it is also
apparent that these four study sites in the comparative study
were very clinically effective and consistent, as demon-
strated by the high levels of complete healing in the standard
care group, as well as patient groups receiving advanced
treatments.
The current study was conducted at 14 wound centres in
seven states. Even when non-compliant and withdrawn sub-
jects were included in the final analysis, ulcers treated with
dHACM continued to show a statistically significant higher
healing rate of 70% at week 12, compared with 50% for
ulcers not treated with the allograft (P = 0.0338). In subjects
completing the study per protocol, rates of complete healing
of 81% and 55% were observed for the dHACM and stan-
dard care groups, respectively. While there appears to be a
reduction in the overall rates of healing in the current study
compared with earlier reports, this is not at all surprising
given the clinical and methodological heterogeneity between
the previous and current study sites, clinician practice pat-
terns across a wider geographical distribution, and a more
complex patient population. A larger sample size; diversity
26
TETTELBACH ET AL.
 in demographic and clinical characteristics in study patients
across the multiple study sites, including high numbers of
large ulcers, males, smokers, drinkers, and those with prior
amputations; and obesity and poor glucose control, as well
as observed dissimilarities in study protocols, debridement
techniques, racial distribution, and patient and provider com-
pliance, are believed to be contributing factors to variances
observed in healing rates between the previous and current
studies.
It is an expected phenomenon in clinical research that, as
additional studies are completed and as more wounds are
treated in broader, less homogenous patient populations and
clinical settings, there will be some regression to the mean
for treatment outcomes.19,20 Irrespective of the initial treat-
ment effect size, it is more important to observe if the overall
significance remains when an intervention is implemented in
a broader patient population cared for by a differing array of
clinical specialists with varying skill levels in a wide range
of clinical settings. Another important observation is if a sig-
nificant difference in treatment effect persists in both ITT
and per protocol analysis of data. The results of the present
study continue to support that dHACM is an efficacious
treatment for chronic lower extremity ulcers.
Frequent debridement has been reported as improving
wound healing and has been called a vital adjunct in the care
of patients with DFUs.21,22 Unfortunately, it is difficult to
uniformly categorise the quality of debridement across study
sites given that many wound care specialists have typically
never received hands-on standardised clinical training in sur-
gical wound debridement. A unique feature of the current
study is the evaluation of the thoroughness of debridement
and its influence on healing outcomes. At study completion,
adjudicators evaluated all wound images blinded to study
group, study site, and primary investigator. Adjudicators
made a determination if adequate debridement had been per-
formed throughout the study period for each subject. Ade-
quate debridement was defined as occurring when post-
debridement images revealed exposure of healthy tissue in
the ulcer with no significant eschar, callous, necrotic tissue,
or foreign material present in or around the wound. Site
investigators were not aware that the thoroughness of
debridement would be evaluated. Results of the Cox regres-
sion analysis support our assumption that variation in the
thoroughness of debridement played an important role in
ultimate healing outcomes. After controlling for treatment,
ulcer
size
and
position,
wounds
receiving
inadequate
debridement were 64% less likely to heal than those ade-
quately debrided. Sharp debridement facilitates growth fac-
tor delivery by restoring the expression of growth factor
receptors that are not properly expressed at the non-healing
edge of chronic ulcers, thus making insensitive cells more
responsive to exogenous growth factor therapy.23 We
believe that meticulous debridement is essential in order to
observe the greatest healing benefits when implanting an
allograft such as dHACM into a chronic wound.
While the best approach in managing patients with dia-
betes at high risk for lower extremity ulcers is to promote
prevention through extensive patient education, early assess-
ment, and aggressive treatment of a developing wound is
often necessary. The goal of treating a lower extremity ulcer
is rapid and complete healing to avoid a cascade of events,
which could lead to the need for amputation. When develop-
ing an individual treatment plan based on wound characteris-
tics, efficacy and cost of advanced wound dressings are
important considerations for patients, clinicians, and payors.
A meta-analysis published in 2017 reported that data
strongly favour the use of amniotic membrane to improve
wound healing with potentially significant cost savings.24
Repeatedly, dHACM has been shown to be an efficacious
treatment for chronic lower extremity ulcers. In the present
study, the median graft cost for an dHACM-healed ulcer
was $2,252.33, which is substantially lower than the median
cost burden of a minor amputation, which was reported to be
$37,598 and $53,779 for a major amputation in 2010.25
Multiple graft sizes that allow smaller, less expensive grafts
to be used as a wound decreases in size reduces waste and
promotes cost-effectiveness of dHACM.
There are strengths and weaknesses to every study. An
overwhelming strength of the present study lies in its rando-
mised, multicentre design, which is considered the gold stan-
dard, providing Level 1 evidence of treatment efficacy.
Objective measurement of wound area was standardised
across all study sites through the use of the Silhouette cam-
era. To eliminate potential bias, final healing status was
adjudicated by a group of three physicians who examined all
wound images. Adjudicators were blinded to study site and
patient group assignment. To further reduce bias and overes-
timation of treatment effect, data were analysed in a modi-
fied ITT fashion, only excluding those subjects who did not
receive assigned treatment after randomisation or who were
found to not meet study inclusion criteria. Patients were
included in their original assigned group even when they
were not treated per protocol, withdrew from study participa-
tion, were non-compliant, lost to follow up, or experienced
adverse events or severe adverse events where continuation
in the study was not feasible. While ITT analysis is recog-
nised as a method to reduce potential bias, it must also be
recognised that inclusion of non-compliant subjects, study
dropouts, and those with protocol and treatment deviations
results in a diluted and conservative estimate of treatment
effect and may be prone to Type II error.26
Use of Cox regression analysis allowed for the control of
multiple factors that can influence healing and differences in
clinical characteristics between the study groups. It is well
recognised by clinicians that a myriad of patient-specific fac-
tors, including medical history, demographics, diet, habits
such as smoking and drinking, compliance with medical
TETTELBACH ET AL.
27
 advice, and size and location of ulcer, influence treatment
success. The ability to control for these factors when analys-
ing study data allows for a more robust and appropriate
interpretation of the results. Indeed, while there was a greater
preponderance of plantar ulcers in the no-dHACM group,
plantar ulcer location was not found to be a significant factor
influencing healing when controlling for multiple clinical
factors in the Cox model.
An unfortunate weakness in any study of advanced
wound care products compared with a “standard care group”
is that the level of treatment provided as “standard care” is
specified by study protocol and is generally of higher quality
and more consistent than what may be provided outside a
clinical trial setting, which may reduce the true effect size
between treatment and control study arms. In a meta-analysis
from 1999, standard “good” wound care consisted of wet-to-
dry dressings and resulted in a healing rate of approximately
24% after 12 weeks.27 In contemporary practice, a wider
variety of more advanced dressings is used, and current
“standard care” for treatment of lower extremity diabetic
ulcers frequently consists of alginate dressings. In the pre-
sent
study,
alginate
dressings,
absorbent
non-adhesive
hydropolymer secondary dressings, and gauze were used in
lieu of basic moist-to-dry dressings, which we believed
increased the rates of healing in the standard care group and
reduced the treatment effect size. A 12-week healing rate of
50% with alginate dressings, double the rate expected with
simple wet-to-dry dressings, speaks to the overall influence
of advanced dressings on rates of wound healing. Achieving
70% healing within 12 weeks provides further evidence of
the efficacy of dHACM compared with other advanced
treatments.
In a perfect world, all wounds could be adequately off-
loaded at all times, and patients would be 100% compliant
with the use of the prescribed offloading device. As in most
other wound treatment studies, the inability to truly monitor
offloading compliance is a study weakness. In the present
study, clinicians were allowed to use their judgement regard-
ing the appropriate offloading device to prescribe, including
the use of full-contact casting and when offloading was no
longer needed once healing occurred. Given the variety of
offloading devices used, we are unable to determine if the
type of offloading device influenced our results. As no
patients' wounds were offloaded with full-contact casting,
we do not know if this would have improved treatment
results in either study group. Variations in clinical recom-
mendations for continued offloading of healed wounds was
not specified per study protocol, and it is unknown how this
influenced the observed rates of wound recurrence.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the results of the current multicentre clinical
trial support and confirm that dHACM is an efficacious
treatment for lower extremity diabetic ulcers. In a heteroge-
neous patient population across the United States, healing
rates with the use of dHACM were superior to those
achieved with standard dressings alone, even when ITT data
analysis, including non-compliant subjects, was conducted.
Reported healing rates within 12 weeks of 70% (ITT analy-
sis) and 81% (per protocol analysis) remain superior to heal-
ing rates reported in comparable prospective studies of other
advanced
wound
care
products.
The
results
of
this
110 patient, multicentre, randomised controlled study pro-
vide additional Level I evidence regarding the efficacy of
dHACM and are useful to clinicians who are determining
which advanced wound care product to choose when caring
for their patients and for health care policymakers in both
the United States and globally who are challenged to evalu-
ate the benefits of available advanced wound care products
compared with costs. The most expensive intervention is the
one that does not work effectively. Benefiting patients
through the appropriate utilisation of strong evidence-based
products such as dHACM is likely among the most cost-
effective forms of health care expenditure.
