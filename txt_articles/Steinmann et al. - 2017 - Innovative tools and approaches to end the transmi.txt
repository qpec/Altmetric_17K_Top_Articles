Introduction 
“Leprosy, one of the most ancient, feared and disabling diseases of humankind, is on the verge of 
defeat”, according to a WHO report published in 2006.1 Today, the causative agent of the disease, 
Mycobacterium leprae, is still transmitted to humans in at least 122 countries, where over 200 000 
new leprosy patients, including around 25 000 children, are being discovered every year.2,3 There are 
several factors responsible for the continuing transmission of the infection.4 Delayed diagnosis, 
which allows transmission to contacts and progression of the disease leading to nerve function 
impairment, is the most common.5 Reasons for delayed diagnosis include disregard of early 
symptoms, difficulties in the differential diagnosis and fear of stigma from community members. As a 
result, many people with suspected signs or symptoms of leprosy do not seek health care.5 
Misdiagnosis by health professionals is another factor that delays diagnosis and perpetuates 
transmission of the infection.5 Compounding these issues is the fact that most leprosy patients live in 
poor and marginalized communities,6 where the experienced staff and facilities required to establish 
a diagnosis are often lacking. Once diagnosed and classified properly as paucibacillary (PB) or 
multibacillary (MB) leprosy, patients can be managed efficiently with multi-drug therapy (MDT).7 
Underlying the difficulties to diagnose leprosy and stop M. leprae transmission is our incomplete 
understanding of the route and mechanism whereby M. leprae enters the human body.8 Various 
routes of entry have been proposed, including human-to-human transmission via prolonged direct 
skin contact or through aerosols, direct inoculation through traumata, and direct or insect-mediated 
infection from zoonotic or environmental reservoirs.4 The most common route of transmission is 
thought to be direct contact or aerosols in the frame of prolonged exposure to an untreated M. 
leprae-infected subject, especially a MB patient with multiple lesions who is closely related to the 
contact.9 There is also solid evidence that zoonotic M. leprae reservoirs exist, most notably the nine-
banded armadillo in southern States of the US,4,10 but they probably are of negligible relevance for 
the global epidemiology of the disease.11 Of note, a high proportion of newly detected leprosy 
patients in endemic areas are unable to identify the source of their infection. This has been explained 
by the long incubation period of the disease but also indirect transmission, such as from water or 
soil.12 Host factors including genetic predisposition and the immune and nutritional status also 
appear to be important risk factors for leprosy infection.13 The lack of basic tools is hampering 
attempts to gain a better understanding of transmission: there is no way of growing M. leprae in 
culture media, easily handled animal models are unavailable, and the incubation period is long. The 
role of improved socio-economic conditions is also debated as a negative correlation between 
leprosy incidence and gross domestic product (GDP) has been observed in several countries.14-17 
However, the causal relationship between the socio-economic development of a country and the risk 
to an individual of developing leprosy is much less clear. 
In 1991, WHO passed a resolution to eliminate leprosy as a public health problem by 2000, defining 
elimination as a global prevalence of less than one leprosy patient per 10 000 population. Today, of 
the 122 countries where leprosy is endemic, 120 have reached the WHO elimination goal,18 not least 
due to a shortening of the standard treatment duration19 A further reduction is currently discussed.20 
In 2012, WHO set a goal for “global elimination” of leprosy by 2020 in the frame of its roadmap 
“accelerating work to overcome the global impact of neglected tropical diseases”.18 In many 
countries, however, transmission is still continuing, and the goal appears unattainable.3 In 2016, 
WHO published the Global Leprosy Strategy 2016 – 2020 that aims at achieving the more modest 
 4 
targets of lowering the global prevalence of newly diagnosed people with grade 2 disability (i.e. 
visible deformity or damage) to below one per million of the population and of zero disabilities 
among new paediatric patients while maintaining the vision of a leprosy free world.21 The strategy is 
based on reducing stigma in order to achieve early diagnosis, strengthening of referral systems, 
conducting systematic tracing of household contacts, monitoring of drug resistance, simplifying 
treatment approaches, and assessing the role of post-exposure prophylaxis.21 Although interrupting 
transmission is part of the vision driving this new strategy, it lacks a strong agenda towards 
accelerating leprosy diagnosis and prevention. 
A better understanding of M. leprae transmission and the risk factors for infection as well as 
improved possibilities to study M. leprae are needed to develop more effective tools and 
interventions to interrupt transmission.22 This article summarizes recent work to develop new 
strategies and tools the authors consider critical to halt the transmission of M. leprae: targeted 
screening with diagnostic tools to identify leprosy patients. Innovative ways of preventing the disease, 
such as by administering chemo- or immunoprophylaxis to individuals at risk of infection. And 
transmission models and investment cases for devising new paths to the interruption of M. leprae 
transmission. 
Finding M. leprae-infected people, and reducing the risk of contacts 
Active case finding involves reaching contacts of index patients and screening them for signs of 
leprosy. It contributes to achieving early diagnosis and is thus an effective means of reducing the risk 
of disability in leprosy patients and of curbing transmission of M. leprae.23-25 The risk of a contact of 
an index patient developing leprosy is related, among other factors, to the duration and closeness of 
the contact, consanguinity with the index patient, and the type of leprosy of the index patient.26,27 
Screening should be confined to people whose contact with the index patient lasted many hours per 
week over a period of several months.9,27 Contact tracing may be restricted to household members 
or include neighbours or social contacts of the index patient, depending on the resources available, 
local epidemiological factors, and the degree of stigma in the community. Contact tracing should be 
undertaken as soon as possible after confirmation of leprosy in an index patient and after the first 
month of MDT treatment.21 It is ideally carried out by local staff who can readily identify and 
approach the contacts, examine them and refer those suspected of being infected for confirmatory 
diagnosis. Alternatively, the contacts of all patients diagnosed over a certain period can be traced in 
the course of a campaign or special “drive”. This “retrospective active case finding” approach has 
previously been used in tuberculosis control in Cambodia, where it was found to increase case 
notification among contacts.28 
With regard to post-exposure chemotherapy, several anti-leprosy drugs given in different 
combinations and regimens have been tested in clinical trials for their ability to reduce the risk of 
contacts developing the disease.29-31 The most robust evidence to date confirming the protective 
potential of post-exposure chemoprophylaxis in contacts of index patients comes from a cluster 
randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled trial in Bangladesh in which a single dose of 
rifampicin given to contacts of leprosy patients reduced the incidence of leprosy among the contacts 
by 57% (95% CI: 33-72%) over the first 2 years of the study.32 The protective effect differed between 
contact cohorts but persisted throughout the 6-year follow-up of the study.33 The presumed risk that 
rifampicin prophylaxis given to leprosy patients might induce or amplify rifampicin resistance to 
 5 
tuberculosis has been examined and found to be negligible, and therefore outweighed by the 
protective benefits of the procedure.34  
Vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) at birth or later has also been shown to provide a 
certain degree of protection from leprosy35 that adds to the protective effect of single-dose 
rifampicin.9 The Bangladesh study showed that single-dose rifampicin given to contacts of leprosy 
index patients who had received BCG at infancy reduced the risk of leprosy among the contacts by 80% 
(95% CI: 50–92%).36 
Initial evidence of the effectiveness of contact tracing followed by chemoprophylaxis in reducing new 
case detection rates and grade 2 disability rates24,37 prompted the establishment of a Leprosy Post-
Exposure Prophylaxis (LPEP) programme designed to study the effectiveness and feasibility of active 
contact tracing combined with single-dose rifampicin administration in various country settings with 
differing leprosy programmes.38 The LPEP programme is currently operating in eight countries. 
Moreover, research groups in Brazil and Bangladesh are assessing the impact of (re-)vaccinating 
leprosy contacts with BCG in addition to single dose rifampicin administration,38,39 and the benefits of 
a test to detect infected individuals among contacts is also under study. However, case finding, 
whether active or passive, can only identify a limited proportion of all leprosy patients.40 Hence the 
need for integration of contact tracing and post-exposure prophylaxis interventions into national 
leprosy programmes capable of implementing these interventions in addition to reliable passive case 
detection, and robust surveillance systems including accurate recording, timely reporting and regular 
monitoring.24 
Vaccines 
Chemoprophylaxis for contacts of leprosy patients is partially successful in preventing leprosy.41 It 
lacks, however, the ability to protect contacts on subsequent exposure to the leprosy bacillus. 
Moreover, only a limited number of anti-leprosy drugs are available and their excessive use could 
lead to drug resistance.34 By contrast, a specific vaccine to induce a long-lasting immune response 
would prevent future infections. Vaccines are generally seen as essential tools to eliminate a 
transmissible disease.42 The feasibility of inducing protective immunity with a vaccine is supported by 
the fact that 90% of people infected by M. leprae mount a protective immune response to the 
bacillus. Several leprosy vaccine projects have recently been completed. Clinical trials have been 
conducted on Mycobacterium w now known as M. indicus pranii or MIP,43 M. vaccae,44 M. habana,45 
killed M. leprae35,46,47 and BCG.48,49 Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that BCG 
has a protective efficacy of around 50% against leprosy, with greater protection against MB than PB 
leprosy.50,51 In some countries leprosy patients vaccinated with BCG in childhood have been re-
vaccinated with BCG on the strength of evidence from a number of studies that multiple BCG 
vaccination can enhance protection against M. leprae.35,46 This strategy, however, has not been 
effective against tuberculosis52-54 and WHO guidelines do not support BCG re-vaccination. Some 
studies, even suggest that BCG vaccination or re-vaccination may accelerate the onset of PB 
leprosy.39,55 
Historically, of all the adjuvants used in approved vaccines most are alum-based, i.e. contain 
aluminium salts. Such adjuvants have been used safely to boost antibody responses for the past 70 
years. However, an effective vaccine against leprosy will be one that induces durable Th1-cell 
responses directed against M. leprae antigens. The recent development of safe and effective 
 6 
adjuvants capable of inducing the desired responses have made possible a new generation of 
vaccines against intracellular pathogens.56 Innovative Th1 inducing adjuvants are already available for 
use in tuberculosis vaccines57 and a whole new generation of adjuvants capable of enhancing T-cell 
responses is now in advanced stages of development.56 A novel strategy for producing a new 
generation of leprosy vaccines combines both immunological and molecular techniques.58,59 Antigen-
specific T cells have been used to screen hundreds of M. leprae gene fragments for potential use in a 
vaccine58. Thanks to the sequencing of the whole M. leprae genome60 it is now possible to rapidly 
synthesize entire M. leprae genes and to produce recombinant proteins. These advances have 
opened the door to the development of the first defined leprosy vaccine, which will be ready for 
clinical testing in 2017. In a first step, the vaccine might be administered to contacts of leprosy 
patients together with preventive chemotherapy in a bid to simultaneously rid them from M. leprae 
infection and protect them from future reinfection.30 Vaccine safety has been studied in the 
armadillo model; findings indicate that a defined vaccine is safe, and actually delays nerve damage. 
Diagnostic tools 
Leprosy presents in a range of forms. The bacterial load is low at the tuberculoid end of the spectrum 
while it is high at the lepromatous end. Available serological tests are sensitive for patients with a 
relatively high bacterial load (MB patients), but insensitive for PB patients for whom T cell based 
tests are required to support the diagnosis of leprosy. Historically, the diagnosis of leprosy has relied 
on clinical evaluation of suspected leprosy lesions and the use of a slit-skin smear test that allows a 
health professional to determine the bacteriological index, which gives an indication of the bacterial 
load. Indeed, current WHO guidelines refer to clinical diagnosis and classification as key diagnostic 
tools.21 These methods have shortcomings. Clinical evaluation detects disease rather than subclinical 
infection, and bacteriological assays cannot reliably distinguish between asymptomatic infections 
and leprosy disease.8 Also, the slit-skin test is invasive, lacks sensitivity for PB leprosy, determining 
the bacteriological index requires robust training and quality control, and is uncorrelated with 
disease severity.61 
There is a clear need for inexpensive point-of-care diagnostic tests that are highly specific and 
sensitive, can detect subclinical infection, and could be used either to confirm diagnosis in people 
with suspected leprosy lesions or to screen contacts of index patients or other population groups at a 
high risk for leprosy.62,63 
Serological test kits often rely on the measurement of antibodies against phenolic glycolipid (PGL)-I. 
However, anti-PGL-I antibody levels are often detected at low titers in PB leprosy patients.64,65 A 
currently available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the leprosy IDRI diagnostic-
1 (LID-1) and ND-O antigens combined into the single fusion complex (ND-O–LID) is positive for most 
MB leprosy patients within 90 minutes.66 A recent study in leprosy patients from Colombia and the 
Philippines suggests that this test could eventually replace the skin-slit procedure to confirm MB 
leprosy due to its good sensitivity (95.7%) and specificity (93.2%), while still requiring a laboratory to 
perform the test.66,67 Of note, the sensitivity of an antibody-detecting test for PB leprosy is low in 
endemic regions, and a high rate of false-positive test results has been observed in endemic 
populations.66 Efforts to interrupt M. leprae transmission would greatly benefit from a diagnostic tool 
to detect infection rather than disease. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), for 
example, is highly specific and sensitive and shows promise for diagnosing infection in MB and PB 
 7 
patients early enough to ensure the prompt treatment needed to prevent disabilities and to reduce 
M. leprae transmission.68 However, no qPCR test for the diagnosis of leprosy has yet been validated 
and carriers without signs of disease exist in endemic areas. The PCR-based techniques that are used 
to detect pathogen RNA can also determine the viability and therefore transmissibility of an 
M. leprae bacterium strain and could be used in contact screening and surveillance programmes.69 
PCR amplification of M. leprae-specific DNA can be done on a wide variety of tissue sources, 
including skin biopsies, oral or nasal swabs, and whole blood. However, optimal results are currently 
obtained by using skin biopsies rather than readily collected samples. In addition, clinical validation 
and correlation with serological test results are still to be established. An approved PCR-based test is 
not yet available.68,70 
Another approach being investigated by several research teams is based on the host’s polarized T-
cell immune response to M. leprae. The inflammatory cytokine-mediated T helper Type 1 (Th1) cell 
response is elicited in response to the leprosy bacterium in PB leprosy. Th1-antigen specific 
responses from PB patients are detectable through in vitro cell stimulation assays using protein and 
peptide based derivatives. Th1 cell-based surrogate tests may detect asymptomatic M. leprae 
infections. Current research on developing such a test focuses on the detection of interferon gamma, 
other cytokines and biomarker profiles.71-74 
There is growing interest among leprosy researchers in using nerve enlargement and inflammation in 
suspected leprosy patients as a surrogate confirmatory diagnostic biomarker. Recent studies have 
used bilateral high-resolution sonography and colour Doppler imaging to more objectively measure 
nerve enlargement and inflammation in the ulnar, median, lateral popliteal, and posterior tibeal 
nerves of leprosy patients. The imaging and sonography procedures showed that nerves of leprosy 
patients are significantly thicker than those of healthy subjects. The clinical relevance of thickened 
peripheral nerves in contacts of leprosy patients is unclear. Sonography is not invasive and would be 
more cost-effective than magnetic resonance imaging, which is currently used to determine nerve 
thickening in suspected leprosy patients. Exploratory studies on the diagnostic potential of this 
technique are ongoing,75,76 but questions remain how any breakthroughs could be operationalized in 
endemic settings.  
Planning M. leprae transmission interruption: modelling and investment case 
Epidemiological modelling of M. leprae transmission and leprosy is essential in designing, guiding, 
and evaluating leprosy control policies. The Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) Modelling 
Consortium,77 brings together an international team of disease modellers with an objective to 
provide quantitative model analyses to support efforts to achieve, among other goals, the WHO goal 
for leprosy elimination by 2020.18 Two leprosy compartmental models and one individual-based 
transmission model have been described in the literature.78 Both compartmental models investigate 
the course of leprosy in populations and the long-term impact of control strategies.17,79-81 The 
individual-based model (SIMCOLEP) focuses on the impact of case finding among contacts of new 
leprosy patients.82,83 The SIMCOLEP model assesses whether leprosy could be eliminated at national 
and subnational levels by 2020 in different high-burden countries using WHO’s definition of 
elimination84 Predictions indicated that country-level elimination as defined by WHO could be 
reached in India, Brazil and Indonesia by 2020 but that leprosy is likely to remain above the 
elimination threshold in most of the current high-endemic regions or districts within these countries. 
 8 
An analysis of the case detection rates in India using linear mixed-effects regression also suggests a 
very slow decline in endemic leprosy, with heterogeneity across states and districts.85 
In a separate study concerning Pará State, an area of high leprosy incidence in Brazil, modelling 
analyses using SIMCOLEP suggest that under current control activities the number of new leprosy 
patients will continue to decrease slowly and that elimination of leprosy as a public health problem 
could possibly be achieved by 2030 or thereabouts if control programmes continue to implement 
passive case detection, MDT administration, and contact tracing, at the current levels of intensity. 
Providing chemoprophylaxis to contacts would further lower the new case detection trend.86 This 
finding has been contested by another group that maintains that the current approach neglects a 
high proportion of the extant leprosy patients and thus is unlikely to result in any substantial and 
lasting reduction of disease burden and transmission.87,88  
An elaborate analysis of data from Thailand using an advanced back calculation method suggested 
that the fall in incidence in this country over many years could be attributed to the efforts of the 
country’s control programme.89 Models can play an important role in testing various assumptions 
about the transmission of M. leprae as many uncertainties remain with respect to transmission 
dynamics. More importantly, they can also provide an indication of which interventions will have the 
greatest impact in halting transmission.  
Efforts to eliminate a disease may be costly. The decision to commit to elimination should therefore 
be based on a robust analysis of the benefits, risks, and costs that accrue from such an undertaking.90 
To meet this requirement, in recent years a so-called elimination or eradication investment case (EIC) 
procedure has been developed and applied to several neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), such as 
onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, and human African trypanosomiasis.91-96 The EIC approach is 
particularly appropriate for diseases such as leprosy that incur a high socio-economic burden and for 
which multiple interventions exist or are being developed. An EIC for leprosy would help to judge 
whether sustainably interrupting transmission is feasible, what the most promising interventions for 
achieving that objective would be, and which long-term consequences the chosen interventions 
would entail. An EIC should also include an assessment of the changes required to the health system 
in leprosy-endemic countries, an analysis of the likely impact of zero leprosy transmission on 
economic productivity at the household and population levels, and on social participation.91 The 
economic impact of leprosy elimination may turn out to be substantial at the household but not 
societal level, given the generally low prevalence and highly focal occurrence of the disease amongst 
the poorest segments of the population. 
A recent systematic review study has explored the possibility of constructing an EIC for leprosy (see 
Panel 1).97 
================================================================================ 
Panel 1: Key findings of a systematic review on constructing a leprosy elimination investment case 
A recent systematic review study97 identified a number of factors that should be considered when 
developing a case for investing in the elimination of leprosy. The findings listed below, adapted from 
this study, are grouped under eight headings, in accordance with an internationally recognized guide 
on preparing disease investment cases.98 
 9 
1. Disease burden and elimination 
a. The proportion of newly detected leprosy cases in children under 15 years reflects 
the degree to which M. leprae transmission is occurring. 
b. The proportion of patients with grade-2 disability (visible deformity or damage) 
reflects the degree to which a health system is achieving early detection and prompt 
treatment of patients. 
c. Many leprosy cases escape detection by the health system.2 
2. Current state of the leprosy programme and recent technical advances  
a. The recently developed PCR test is capable of detecting the leprosy bacillus and its 
resistance to drugs99 but its application is limited. 
b. The M. leprae–specific anti-PGL-I antibody test has limited applicability, since it is 
only reliably positive in MB cases.100 
3. Available and new tools and their scope in interrupting transmission 
a. Tracing contacts of index leprosy patients can detect new leprosy patients more 
effectively than population–based approaches but faces operational and ethical 
challenges.40 
b. Contact tracing followed by administration of chemoprophylaxis and/or vaccination 
with BCG is currently the most promising approach to halting M. leprae 
transmission. 
4. Future requirements during and after transmission interruption 
a. Linking leprosy elimination efforts with programmes working on other neglected 
tropical diseases (NTDs) ensures the sustainability, efficacy, and financial resilience 
needed to reach the leprosy elimination goal.2,23 
5. Biological and technical feasibility of transmission interruption 
a. Genome-based technology seems likely to facilitate the development of leprosy 
vaccines and diagnostic tests.101 
6. Socioeconomic burden and public goods obtainable 
a. The Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) is not a reliable indicator of the leprosy 
disease burden.102,103 
b. Leprosy is one of many NTDs associated with poverty.104 
7. Financing leprosy elimination 
a. Information on the costs of providing leprosy services is limited. 
8. Health systems and their capacity 
a. Integrating a leprosy programme into the general health system lowers the level of 
anti-leprosy stigma in a country. 
b. Community based rehabilitation (CBR) is effective in integrated programmes but 
applied in few health systems.105,106 
================================================================================ 
Conclusions 
The drive to interrupt M. leprae transmission and finally eliminate leprosy is entering a critical stage. 
The causative bacterium is still circulating freely among many communities, and since the turn of the 
century, the number of new leprosy patients being detected annually has stagnated. One reason is 
the dwindling of the political and financial commitment required to stop transmission, a 
 10 
development that resulted largely from a widespread but mistaken belief that leprosy had been 
eliminated. Today, the leprosy research community, together with other key players on the leprosy 
scene, has taken up the challenge to revitalise efforts at halting transmission of M. leprae. Research 
is underway on transmission and on the development of new tools and strategies needed to 
terminate it. Reaching this goal will not be achieved easily or quickly, and the tools to monitor 
progress towards zero transmission remain to be developed. Also, leprosy will remain a public health 
and social problem for decades after the successful interruption of transmission due to the long 
incubation period, leprosy reactions, and the social and economic consequences of the disease.  
Sustainability and perseverance will be critical to its success as is constant innovation. Periodic 
reviews and adjustments will be needed as new tools and approaches are tested. Of particular 
relevance to efforts at interrupting M. leprae transmission is the need for these tools and strategies 
to be readily usable within the existing health systems, even in the many countries that no longer 
have dedicated leprosy control programmes and the fine-tuned technical experience and deep 
understanding of the local epidemiology that these programmes used to have. The development and 
deployment of new tools and strategies calls for close collaboration between all actors on the leprosy 
scene, including the research community, international normative agencies such as WHO, national 
health authorities, non-governmental organizations, and the agencies and institutions that will 
catalyse the efforts to bridge the gap between hopes and realities.

Leprosy-specific vaccines that induce long-lasting T-cell responses and that could be used in 
contacts to complement chemotherapy are in advanced development. 
 
Molecular biology techniques are being used to develop sensitive and specific tests to 
detect M. leprae infection and diagnose leprosy.  
 
Epidemiological modelling and a holistic assessment of the investments needed to 
interrupt M. leprae transmission and resulting benefits can help to guide future efforts to 
eliminate leprosy.
