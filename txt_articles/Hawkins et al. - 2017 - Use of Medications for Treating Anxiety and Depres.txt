Purpose
This study used population-based data to estimate the percentage of cancer survivors in the United
States reporting current medication use for anxiety and depression and to characterize the survivors
taking this type of medication. Rates of medication use in cancer survivors were compared with
rates in the general population.
Methods
We analyzed data from the National Health Interview Survey, years 2010 to 2013, identifying cancer
survivors (n = 3,184) and adults with no history of cancer (n = 44,997) who completed both the
Sample Adult Core Questionnaire and the Adult Functioning and Disability Supplement.
Results
Compared with adults with no history of cancer, cancer survivors were significantly more likely to
report taking medication for anxiety (16.8% v 8.6%, P , .001), depression (14.1% v 7.8%, P , .001),
and one or both of these conditions combined (19.1% v 10.4%, P , .001), indicating that an es-
timated 2.5 million cancer survivors were taking medication for anxiety or depression in the United
States at that time. Survivor characteristics associated with higher rates of medication use for
anxiety included being younger than 65 years old, female, and non-Hispanic white, and having public
insurance, a usual source of medical care, and multiple chronic health conditions. Survivor char-
acteristics associated with medication use for depression were largely consistent with those for
anxiety, with the exceptions that insurance status was not significant, whereas being widowed/
divorced/separated was associated with more use.
Conclusion
Cancer survivors in the United States reported medication use for anxiety and depression at rates
nearly two times those reported by the general public, likely a reflection of greater emotional and
physical burdens from cancer or its treatment.

INTRODUCTION
At some point after a cancer diagnosis, many people
experience psychosocial distress including feel-
ings of sadness, fear, anxiety, and depression.1-4 A
multitude of factors can arise to cause this distress,
from fears of death and suffering, to changes in
social roles and the physical pain caused by cancer
or its treatments, to having a personal history of
depression or anxiety disorders.5-6 Although some
survivors might be affected minimally or tempo-
rarily, others might experience overwhelming anx-
iety, depression, or both, for significant periods of
time,4,7,8 causing disruption and a reduced quality
of life.9 If left unaddressed and untreated, anxiety
and depression in cancer survivors have been found
to negatively affect health behaviors, the body’s
inflammatory response, and even survival.5,10-13
In recognition of the adverse consequences
that psychosocial distress can have on the health
and well-being of cancer survivors, the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network,14 ASCO,15 and
the Commission on Cancer (CoC) of the Amer-
ican College of Surgeons16 have all issued state-
ments advocating for widespread distress screening
and treatment of cancer survivors. In 2012, the CoC
instituted this recommendation by requiring that
all patients with cancer treated in CoC-accredited
facilities be screened for distress as a standard part
of cancer care.16 When survivors experience sig-
nificant or persistent distress, a variety of psy-
chosocial interventions or psychopharmacologic
therapies can be recommended.

 There is evidence that pharmacologic therapies can be safe
and effective in reducing the symptoms of emotional distress in
cancer survivors.17,18 There is also some indication that the use of
pharmacologic therapies for treating anxiety and depression is
prevalent and on the rise in cancer survivors.19,20 However, we do
not know how many cancer survivors are currently using medi-
cation to treat anxiety and/or depression in the United States.
A recent study in Sweden found that cancer survivors used psy-
chiatric medications at higher rates than did cancer-free indi-
viduals,4 but comparative rates have not been investigated in the
cancer survivor population in the Unites States, and we know
little about the sociodemographic characteristics associated with
medication use. To increase our understanding of psychotropic
medication use by cancer survivors in the United States and to
inform future research, this study aimed to provide population-
based prevalence estimates of cancer survivors in the United States
reporting medication use for anxiety and depression, to identify
the characteristics of survivors most likely to be taking medication
for anxiety and depression, and to compare these findings with
findings in the general population.
METHODS
Data Source
This study analyzed data from the National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS),21 combining data years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. The NHIS is
a nation-wide, in-person, cross-sectional survey administered by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that gathers information on
the health status of the civilian noninstitutionalized population in the
United States to track progress toward achieving national health objectives.
NHIS uses a multistage area probability sampling strategy and oversamples
for minority race/ethnicity to achieve representative sampling of house-
holds across the United States. From each participating household, one
adult is randomly selected to complete the Sample Adult Core ques-
tionnaire, which contains questions on demographics, health services,
health status, and any previous cancer diagnoses.
The Adult Functioning and Disability Supplement (called the Quality
of Life Supplement in 2010) is sponsored by the Washington Group on
Disability Statistics and has been included in NHIS since 2010. Its purpose
is to develop and test measures of adult disability and functioning, in-
cluding physical and emotional health, in various domains. In alternating
survey years, either 25% or 50% of participants completing the Sample
Adult Core questionnaire are randomly selected to also complete the Adult
Functioning and Disability Supplement. For this analysis, we selected
respondents who completed both the Sample Adult Core questionnaire
and the Adult Functioning and Disability Supplement in a given year of
NHIS participation.
Measures
Medication use. As part of the Adult Functioning and Disability
Supplement, participants were asked whether they currently took medi-
cation “for depression” (yes/no). A separate question asked whether they
currently took medication “for feeling worried, nervous, or anxious” (yes/no).
We looked at two separate outcomes: (1) taking medication for anxiety,
whether for anxiety alone or also for depression, and (2) taking medication
for depression, whether for depression alone or also for anxiety.
Sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. Sociodemographic
characteristics used in this study included age, sex, race and ethnicity, marital
status, and education. Health-related characteristics included insurance
status and type (ie, private, public only, or none/single service only) and
having a usual source for medical care (yes/no). Noncancer comorbidity
burden was defined by the number of chronic health conditions reported
(eg, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, arthritis), consistent with previous
research.22,23
Cancer history. Cancer survivor status was assessed through the
question, “Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional
that you had cancer or a malignancy of any kind?” A positive response was
followed by an opportunity to specify up to three different cancer di-
agnoses. Respondents were asked their age at the time of each cancer
diagnosis. All cancer survivors were postdiagnosis, but some could have
been receiving cancer treatment at the time of the survey.
Data Analysis
Our analysis excluded participants who reported only a diagnosis of
nonmelanoma skin cancer or an unknown type of skin cancer. Among
cancer survivors, if more than one cancer was reported, we chose the
cancer type corresponding to the most recent cancer diagnosis in our
analysis. Consistent with previous research, cancers with a relative 5-year
survival of , 25% (ie, esophagus, liver, gall bladder, lung, pancreas, and
stomach) were combined as “short survival cancers.”23 Time since most
recent cancer diagnosis (in years) was calculated by subtracting age at most
recent diagnosis from age at time of survey. Insurance categories “none”
and “private” were combined in the multivariable regression analyses
because their relationships with medication use were similar and because
not doing so would necessitate the suppression of some estimates for the
“none” category because of small numbers and unstable estimates.
Taking medication for anxiety and taking medication for depression
were examined as two separate outcomes. All analyses were performed
using SAS/SUDAAN to weight survey estimates and take into account the
complex sampling design of NHIS. Descriptive analyses included com-
paring cancer survivors and adults without cancer on sociodemographic
and health-related characteristics. We provide unadjusted weighted per-
centages of medication use by cancer survivorship status stratified by
demographic and health-related characteristics. Age-adjusted weighted
percentages were used to examine medication use by cancer survivorship
status and to provide estimates of the number of adults in the United States
taking medication. In addition, a test of trend was performed using logistic
regression to determine if medication use varied by survey year. Four
separate multivariable logistic regression models provided adjusted odds
ratios of medication use by participant characteristics; the four models
were run for each medication use by survivorship status. We also computed
weighted adjusted percentages (predicted marginals) to examine how
anxiety and depression medication use varied by cancer site and time since
cancer diagnosis. The predicted marginals adjusted the weighted per-
centages, controlling for the factors identified in the multivariable logistic
regression models.
RESULTS
Analytic Sample
No significant differences were observed in medication use by
survey year (cancer survivors: anxiety meds, P = .46, depression
meds, P = .73; adults without cancer: anxiety meds, P = .79,
depression meds, P = .28; data not shown); therefore, we combined
NHIS data for years 2010 through 2013 for our analysis. Applying
our exclusion criteria resulted in an analytic sample size of 48,181,
consisting of 3,184 cancer survivors and 44,997 adults without
cancer. Figure 1 indicates the steps taken to identify and select the
study’s final analytic sample. Sociodemographic and health-related
characteristics of cancer survivors and adults without cancer are
presented in Table 1. Comparing cancer survivors with adults without
cancer, x2 tests revealed significant differences in age (x2 = 201.41;
P , .001), sex (x2 = 26.27; P , .001), race/ethnicity (x2 = 58.23;

 P , .001), marital status (x2 = 145.02; P , .001), insur-
ance (x2 = 101.81; P , .001), usual source of care (x2 = 264.86;
P , .001), and noncancer chronic conditions (x2 = 151.93;
P , .001).Among cancer survivors, the most common cancer
sites were female breast (21.9%) and prostate (16.3%).
Medication Use
Age-adjusted, weighted percentages depicting medication
use for anxiety and depression by cancer survivor status are
displayed in Table 2. Compared with adults without cancer,
cancer survivors were significantly more likely to report taking
medication for anxiety (16.8% v 8.6%, P , .001), depression
(14.1% v 7.8%, P , .001), both anxiety and depression (11.8% v
6.1%, P , .001), and one or both of these conditions (19.1% v
10.3%, P , .001). An estimated 2.5 million cancer survivors in
the United States were taking medication for anxiety or depression.
The overlap of medication use for depression and anxiety is illus-
trated in Venn diagrams in Figures 2A and 2B. Sixty-one percent of
cancer survivors taking medication for either depression or anxiety
report taking medication for both, and this overlap is 59% in adults
without cancer.
Predictors of Taking Medication for Anxiety
Unadjusted estimates of anxiety medication use by demo-
graphic and health-related characteristics in cancer survivors and
adults without cancer are found in Table 3. Among cancer survivors,
the lowest percentages of medication use for anxiety (ie, , 10%)
were seen in those with a history of prostate cancer, whereas the
highest rates (ie, . 20%) were seen in survivors who were 40 to
64 years old, those who were never married, and those who had
a history of ovarian, uterine, or short survival cancers.
Results of the logistic regression modeling of medication use
for anxiety by participant characteristics are found in Table 4.
Among cancer survivors, medication use for anxiety was more
likely in women, those with public insurance, and those with one
or more noncancer chronic conditions, compared with those with
none. In contrast, medication use for anxiety was less likely in
non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics compared with non-Hispanic
whites, in those without a usual source of care, and in those
65 years of age and older.
Among adults without cancer, medication use for anxiety was
more likely in those 40 to 49 years of age and less likely in those
65 years of age and older, compared with those 39 years of age or
younger; it was more likely in women, non-Hispanic whites, those
never married or widowed/divorced/separated, those with public
insurance, and those with a usual source of care. Use also increased
with increases in the number of chronic health conditions reported.
Predictors of Taking Medication for Depression
Unadjusted estimates of depression medication use by de-
mographic and health-related characteristics in cancer survivors
and adults without cancer are found in Table 3. Among cancer
survivors, the lowest percentages of medication use for depression
(ie, , 10%) were seen in those 65 years of age and older, those with
no additional chronic conditions, and those with a history of
prostate cancer, whereas the highest rates (ie, . 20%) were seen in
survivors who were 40 to 64 years old, those who had three or more
chronic conditions, and those with a history of ovarian, uterine, or
short survival cancers.
Results of the logistic regression modeling revealed that in
cancer survivors, increased odds of taking medication for de-
pression were seen in those who were female, non-Hispanic white,

care, and those with a higher number of noncancer chronic health
conditions. Use was less likely in those 65 years of age and older.
Among adults without cancer, medication use for depression
was most likely in those 40 to 64 years of age, and least likely in
those 65 years of age and older; it was more likely in those who were
female, those who were non-Hispanic white, those who were never
married or widowed/divorced/separated, those with public in-
surance, those with a usual source of care, and those with a greater
number of chronic health conditions.

DISCUSSION
Our analysis indicates that cancer survivors are taking medica-
tion for anxiety and depression at rates nearly double that of the

Anxiety and Depression Medication Use in US Cancer Survivors
 general population. Between 2010 and 2013, an estimated
2.5 million cancer survivors were using medication to treat anxiety,
depression, or both conditions in the United States. Of survivors
who reported taking medication for either depression or anxiety,
the majority reported taking medication for both conditions. This
pattern of treating comorbid anxiety and depression was also ob-
served in adults without cancer.
Several survivor characteristics associated with the greatest use
of medication for anxiety and depression, including being female,
non-Hispanic white, and under the age of 65 years, and having
chronic health conditions, closely mirror the characteristics found
previously to correlate with higher rates of anxiety disorder and
depression after cancer24 and with lower quality of life in cancer
survivors.25,26 Interestingly, medication use did not vary sig-
nificantly by time since cancer diagnosis, which is consistent with
recent research that has shown elevated rates of depression and
mental disorders for cancer survivors as much as 10 years after
diagnosis.4 Characteristics associated with medication use in
cancer survivors were similar to those observed in adults without
cancer. Having a usual source of medical care was predictive of
medication use in both groups, which likely reflects having easier
access to providers, and thus, prescription medications of all
types. It is worth noting that a greater proportion of cancer
survivors reported having a usual source of care than did adults
without cancer, which could play a role in their comparatively
higher rates of medication use.
Among cancer survivors, the highest rates of medication use
(ie, . 20%) were observed in those who were in middle age (ie, 40
to 64 years of age); reported never being married (anxiety med-
ication only); had three or more chronic health conditions (de-
pression only); and reported short survival cancers, ovarian cancer,
or uterine cancer. However, survivors of all cancer types reported
higher rates of medication use for anxiety and depression than did
adults without a history of cancer.
Although this study provides novel, population-based es-
timates of the number of cancer survivors taking medications for
anxiety and depression in the United States, several limitations
should be noted. First, data are self-reported, and information
about the onset or duration of medication use is not available in
NHIS. Thus, we could not verify medication use, determine when
survivors began taking medications, nor determine whether
medications were initiated before or after a cancer diagnosis. It is
possible that there could be error in our estimates of antide-
pressant and anxiolytic drug use, because these medications are
often prescribed for purposes other than anxiety and depres-
sion (eg, hot flashes, sleep disturbances). We also do not know
whether participants who reported taking medication were ever
diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or clinically significant de-
pression. Furthermore, we do not have information on which
medications were being taken, whether the medications were
prescribed by a physician, or whether they were being taken
according to guidelines. For respondents who reported taking
medication for anxiety and depression, we do not know whether
these comorbid conditions were treated with multiple medica-
tions or one single medication. Although some previous research
has benefitted from access to survivors’ prescription records to

 determine the type and precise amount of medications pre-
scribed,27 the current method offers the benefit of obtaining
respondents’ direct reports of medications that they are currently
taking. In the creation of age groups for the analysis, because of
the small sample size, adults 65 years of age and older were
grouped together, and we were unable to further differentiate
medication use in this wide age group. However, data indicate
that the use of antidepressant and antianxiety medication de-
creased with increasing age. Finally, we have no information on
whether survivors who were taking medication for anxiety or
depression were receiving other types of psychosocial care in
addition to pharmacologic treatment. Guidelines from ASCO
and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network stress the im-
portance and efficacy of using both pharmacologic and non-
pharmacologic interventions (ie, dual treatment) to treat anxiety,
depression, and other symptoms of emotional distress, because
dual treatment has been shown to be more effective than using
one treatment method only.28,29

Anxiety and Depression Medication Use in US Cancer Survivors
 In conclusion, our findings indicate that in adult cancer
survivors in the United States, 19.1% (approximately 2.5 million
survivors) are taking medication for anxiety or depression, a rate
nearly double that found in the general noncancer public. Placed in
the context of previous research, which found that 31% of cancer
survivors in the United Sates sought help for psychosocial concerns
by discussing them with their medical provider,22 our estimate of
medication use is more modest and could suggest that even more
survivors might benefit from pharmacologic treatment than were
receiving treatment at the time of this study. Nevertheless, the
observed rate of medication use in cancer survivors likely reflects
a combination of factors that could include survivors’ increased
likelihood of having a usual source of care (and access to pre-
scription medications) and an elevated number of physical and
emotional burdens after cancer, which seem to follow survivors for
many years after diagnosis. Although our estimates provide
benchmarks for the rates of psychotropic medication use in sur-
vivors, they can also inform future research seeking to assess the
connections among cancer, medication use, and mental health.
Future work could determine whether survivors taking these
medications are also receiving other forms of psychosocial
treatment and support and whether cancer survivors are mon-
itored adequately or screened over time to assess their changing
psychosocial needs. Efforts to improve the psychosocial care of
cancer survivors will be aided by continued tracking of the
treatment received for mental health. Good medical care requires
systematic evaluation, screening for new problems, and making
adjustments to the prescribed therapies as needed, and survivors’
mental health deserves the same detailed, evidence-based, and
ongoing attention.
