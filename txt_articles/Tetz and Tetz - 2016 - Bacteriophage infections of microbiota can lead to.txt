LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Bacteriophage infections of microbiota 
can lead to leaky gut in an experimental  
rodent model
George Tetz* and Victor Tetz
Abstract 
Increased intestinal permeability and translocation of gut microbiota from the intestinal lumen to the systemic 
circulation predispose patients to various diseases and may be one of the main triggers thereof. The role of micro-
biota in increased intestinal permeability is under intensive investigation. Here, we studied alterations in the host 
and increased intestinal permeability as a direct effect of treatment with a bacteriophage cocktail. After 10 days of 
challenge, the rats showed weight loss, messy hair, and decreased activity. Additionally, they displayed a significantly 
elevated lactulose:mannitol ratio and the level of circulating immune complexes. To our knowledge, this study dem-
onstrates for the first time that increased intestinal permeability may be induced by bacteriophages that affect the 
microbiota.

Background
The human microbiota is comprised of bacteria, fungi, 
and viruses including bacteriophages, and is a very com-
plex ecosystem that is in dynamic stability with each of 
its components and the host organism. Gut microbes 
colonize the majority of mucosal surfaces, and they play 
a primary role in host metabolism and are substantially 
involved in the development and normal action of the 
immune and neural systems, gastro-intestinal tract, and 
mucosal permeability [1, 2]. The intestinal mucosa is a 
complex and extremely dynamic structure that readily 
adapts to a variety of signals that regulate intestinal per-
meability [3].
Intestinal barrier dysfunction or disruption, known as 
“leaky gut” syndrome, is characterized by the transloca-
tion of macromolecules, bacteria or their toxins to the 
lamina propria, which is implicated in the pathogen-
esis of numerous diseases [4]. Abnormally permeable 
mucosal barrier is associated with various pathologies 
including inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn’s disease, 
neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes type 1, some types 
of cancers, cardiovascular disorders, rheumatoid arthri-
tis, etc. [5–7]. It is currently known that the permeabil-
ity of the mucosal barrier is regulated and influenced by 
numerous factors including the gut microbiota. Bacteria 
directly or indirectly modulate all components of intes-
tinal permeability such as mucus integrity and trans- and 
paracellular transport [8].
Here, we evaluated the effect of primary lesions of 
the microbiota on intestinal permeability. To cause pri-
mary lesions of the microbiota, we used bacteriophages, 
which are believed to selectively interact with bacteria 
and to not affect eukaryotic cells [9, 10]. The objective 
of this study was to assess the effect of microbiota treat-
ment with bacteriophages on the intestinal permeability 
in vivo.

biological material was assumed following completion of 
consent forms.
The commercial Salmonella bacteriophage phage cock-
tail (Microgen, Russia) contains phages directed against 
Salmonella enterica serotypes: Paratyphi, Typhimurium, 
Heidelberg, Newport, Choleraesuis, Oranienburg, Infans, 
Dublin, Enteritidis, Anatum, and Newlands. Pyobacte-
riophage Polyvalent, another commercial phage cocktail 
(Microgen, Russia), contains phages directed against six 
pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyo-
genes, Proteus mirabilis and P. vulgaris, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia 
coli [36]. Phage cocktail (1.5 ml [1 × 106 plaque-form-
ing units/ml] of each phage according to the manufac-
turer’s instruction) was given daily to animals (n = 5) for 
10 days. Each animal before bacteriophage challenge was 
used as its own control.
The lactulose:mannitol ratio was measured as a marker 
of intestinal permeability 2 days before and 10 days after 
phage challenge as described by Meddings et al. [11]. 
Lactulose (L7877, Sigma-Aldrich) and mannitol (M8429, 
Sigma-Aldrich) were utilized for all arms of the study. For 
permeability testing of both probes simultaneously, ani-
mals were fasted for 4 h and then gavaged with 120 mg 
lactulose and 80 mg mannitol in 2 ml of water. Animals 
were placed in metabolic cages, and the urine passed 
over 24 h after the gavage was collected and assayed for 
the concentration of each probe by gas chromatography 
as described previously [12].
We measured serum circulating immune complexes 
(CIC) to evaluate possible systemic inflammatory 
response to the alterations caused by bacteriophage 
infection. Heparinized blood samples were collected at 
day 0 and day 10 from the tail vein of rats under sterile 
conditions. CIC were evaluated by sedimentation with a 
4.0 % polyethylene glycol solution followed by spectro-
photometry as described by Ramos et al. [13]. The CIC 
concentration was evaluated as the difference between 
the values of the probes before and after bacteriophage 
challenge.
All results are reported as the mean ± standard error 
(SE). Non-parametric paired Wilcoxon signed rank test 
was applied to analyze pre- and post-challenge differ-
ences. P < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results and discussion
This study demonstrated that increased intestinal per-
meability may be induced by bacteriophages that affect 
the microbiota. We have previously confirmed the 
functionality and selectivity of bacteriophage cocktails 
(unpublished data). Ten days of administration of a bac-
teriophage cocktail active against Staphylococcus spp., 
Streptococcus spp., Proteus spp., Pseudomonas spp., E. 
coli, K. pneumonia, and Salmonella spp. did not lead to 
apparent clinical changes in the gastrointestinal tract 
or abnormal stool in rats. At the same time, all animals 
showed weight loss, messy hair, and decreased activity 
starting from the fifth day of the bacteriophage treat-
ment, which are considered to be related to the translo-
cation of endotoxins across leaky mucosa.
We performed a lactulose-mannitol permeability test 
to determine whether bacteriophages may cause micro-
biota diseases resulting in alterations in the host organ-
ism in the form of increased intestinal permeability [11]. 
Thus, we compared alterations of urinary mannitol and 
lactulose excretion and changes in the lactulose:mannitol 
ratio 2 days before and on the 10th day after daily chal-
lenge with the bacteriophage cocktail. The excretion of 
mannitol was slightly but not significantly reduced after 
bacteriophage challenge as compared to before. At the 
same time, rats exhibited a significant increase (P < 0,05) 
in lactulose excretion after bacteriophage treatment as 
compared to before treatment. The animals displayed a 
significantly elevated lactulose:mannitol ratio (P < 0.05), 
which was considered to reflect increased intestinal per-
meability (Fig. 1; Additional file 1: Table S1). The increase 
was at least 2,4-fold in all animals. All animals had a leaky 
gut with a benchmark lactulose/mannitol ratio >0.46 [12].
Next, we measured the serum concentrations of CIC to 
determine whether alterations caused by bacteriophages 
induced a systemic inflammatory reaction in the rats. 
The presence of CIC is an element of the normal immune 
response, and elevated levels of CIC are associated with 
different pathological conditions including intoxication 
[14]. As shown in Fig. 1, at the 10th day of treatment, the 
mean level of CIC was 2.5 times was higher than before 
treatment (P < 0.05), indicating endogenous intoxica-
tion, most likely caused by increased intestinal perme-
ability and ongoing leaky gut. Untreated negative control 
animals that were kept under the same conditions as the 
treated animals did not show any changes over the study 
period (data not shown).
To our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate that 
experimental bacteriophage infection may be harmful for 
macro-organisms [15, 16]. The pathological effect was 
revealed as increased intestinal permeability, and was a 
result of the phages’ selective effect on the microbiota, 
without any direct effect on the host eukaryotic cells 
[17]. Over the last decade, the knowledge on abnormal 
intestinal permeability or leaky gut and increased bacte-
rial translocation from the intestinal lumen has greatly 
progressed. This revealed the role of bacterial transloca-
tion as one of the main triggers in various poly-etiolog-
ical diseases associated with chronic inflammation such

as inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn’s disease, Alz-
heimer’s diseases, autism, diabetes, colonic neoplasia, 
heart failure, arrhythmias, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. [2, 
5–7]. Our findings indicate that bacteriophages, which 
were previously not considered mammalian or human 
pathogens, can promote microbiota diseases and thus 
indirectly cause pathological conditions of mammals 
that are associated with leaky gut. These pathologies are 
believed not to be contagious or, at least, there currently 
is no reliable proof-of-concept of them being contagious 
[18, 19]. However, taking into consideration their pos-
sible association with leaky gut, it can be assumed that 
their incidence and distribution may be caused by phages 
originating from the outer environment, because bacte-
riophages are widely spread and humans are constantly 
exposed to them [20]. Finally, infection of the microbiota 
by bacteriophages can be considered a new group of viral 
diseases of mammals. Additional studies should be con-
ducted, including those using germ-free rats as controls 
to confirm the effect of the bacteriophage on the gut 
microbiota and employing metagenomic analyses of the 
changes in the gut microbial communities due to the bac-
teriophages, leading to a leaky gut.
Further studies will be necessary to unravel microbiota 
diseases and to evaluate their underlying mechanisms 
and roles in different human pathologies.
