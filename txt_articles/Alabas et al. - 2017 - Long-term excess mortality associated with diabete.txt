Abstract  
Background The long-term excess risk of death associated with diabetes following acute 
myocardial infarction is unknown. We determined the excess risk of death associated with 
diabetes among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI 
(NSTEMI) after adjustment for co-morbidity, risk factors and cardiovascular treatments.  
 
Methods Nationwide population-based cohort (STEMI n=281,259 and NSTEMI n=422,661) 
using data from the UK acute myocardial infarction registry, MINAP, between 1st January, 
2003 and 31st June, 2013. Age, sex, calendar year and country-specific mortality rates for 
the populace of England and Wales (n=56.9 million) were matched to cases of STEMI and 
NSTEMI. Flexible parametric survival models were used to calculate excess mortality rate 
ratios (EMRR) after multivariable adjustment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT02591576).  
 
Results Over 1.94 million person-years follow-up including 120,568 (18.9%) patients with 
diabetes, there were 200,360 (28.4%) deaths. Overall, mortality was higher among patients 
with than without diabetes (35.8% vs. 25.3%). After adjustment for age, sex and year of 
acute myocardial infarction, diabetes was associated with a 72% and 67% excess risk of 
death following STEMI (EMRR 1.72, 95% CI 1.66-1.79) and NSTEMI (1.67, 1.63-1.71). 
Diabetes remained significantly associated with substantial excess mortality despite 
cumulative adjustment for co-morbidity (EMRR 1.52, 95% CI 1.46-1.58 vs. 1.45, 1.42-1.49), 
risk factors (1.50, 1.44-1.57 vs. 1.33, 1.30-1.36) and cardiovascular treatments (1.56, 1.49-
1.63 vs. 1.39, 1.36-1.43).

Conclusion At index acute myocardial infarction, diabetes was common and associated 
with significant long-term excess mortality, over and above the effects of co-morbidities, risk 
factors and cardiovascular treatments.

What is already known?  
 
Evidence suggests that the effect of diabetes on short and long term mortality persists 
after adjusting for demographics, co-morbidities, risk factors and treatments 
concurrently. 
 
However, it is not clear whether this effect remains after correcting for the survival of the 
general population.   
 
What this study adds?  
 
After adjustment for case mix, risk factors and cardiovascular treatments as well as 
correcting for mortality from non-cardiovascular causes, diabetes was independently 
associated with substantial long-term excess mortality following acute myocardial 
infarction.  
 
Patients with diabetes continue to be at an elevated risk of death many years after acute 
myocardial infarction.

Introduction  
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for death following acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI).[1] This fact remains despite substantial international advances in the treatment and 
outcomes for AMI over the last decade.[2,3] Understanding the extent to which diabetes 
impacts on survival following AMI is of great importance because nowadays deaths following 
AMI are mostly due to non-cardiovascular causes.[4,5] That is, diseases which are not 
related to the index AMI, such as cancer, have a significant bearing on survival and could 
influence our interpretation of the impact of diabetes and cardiovascular disease on long-
term clinical outcomes. Given that co-existent disease, aging, and the onset of new diseases 
among patients with AMI have a strong role in determining mortality, it is surprising that there 
are no large scale studies which have accounted for this.  
 
To date, studies reporting the impact of diabetes following AMI have been historical, from 
small cohorts [6-8], trial populations, or have evaluated short term survival [9]. Critically, the 
majority have considered all-cause mortality as the clinical outcome, which does not allow an 
accurate evaluation of the burden of index AMI and its treatment on death. In turn, this has 
potential repercussions for the design and study of new treatments for patients with diabetes 
who have AMI. To overcome the limitations of using all-cause-mortality, some studies report 
cause-specific mortality addressing cardiac death rather than death to any cause. However, 
this may be difficult to ascertain and when available these data can be biased by 
misclassification.[10] An alternative method to estimate cause-specific outcomes is relative 
survival. Using data from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) which 
includes cases of AMI admitted to all acute hospitals in England and Wales and mortality 
data from the matching populace (n=56.9 million), we aimed to estimate the long-term 
excess mortality associated with diabetes among patients with AMI.

Methods 
Patients, setting and inclusion criteria 
We included all National Health Service hospitals (n=247) in England and Wales which 
provided care for patients (n=703,920) aged over 18 years with AMI between 1st January, 
2003 and 30th June, 2013 (see Table 1a, supplementary material). For multiple admissions, 
we used the earliest record. Patient-level data concerning demographics, cardiovascular risk 
factors, medical history and clinical characteristics at the time of hospitalisation were 
extracted from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP), a comprehensive 
registry of hospitalisations for acute coronary syndrome in England and Wales. Details of 
MINAP and data validation have been described previously.[11] Cases of AMI were defined 
as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-STEMI (NSTEMI) according to the 
European Society of Cardiology (ESC), American College of Cardiology (ACC) and 
American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines and determined at local level by the attending 
consultant.[12] Cases included patients with existing type 1 or type 2 DM. The data flow for 
the derivation of the analytical cohort is shown in Figure 1.  
 
Case mix 
To account for case mix and cardiovascular risk, we used patient-specific information 
concerning demographics (age, sex), co-morbidity (previous AMI, heart failure, 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 
cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), chronic renal failure, 
asthma/COPD, family history of coronary heart disease) and risk factors at the time of 
hospitalisation (systolic blood pressure, smoking, heart rate, ST-segment deviation, cardiac 
arrest, elevated cardiac enzyme, use of a loop diuretic) and cardiovascular treatments.  
 
 8 
 
Cardiovascular treatments 
Class 1 guideline recommended treatments included reperfusion treatment (primary 
percutaneous coronary intervention, fibrinolysis) for patients with STEMI, and coronary 
angiography for patients with NSTEMI.[13,14] For all patients, we considered the 
prescription of aspirin, � blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors 
(ACEi)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins), 
thienopyridine inhibitors and cardiac rehabilitation.  
 
Outcome 
The primary outcome was excess mortality estimated using a relative survival approach. The 
relative survival rate was defined as the observed survival among patients with AMI divided 
by the expected survival of the comparable general populace of England and Wales.[15] 
Date of all-cause mortality was determined through linkage to Office for National Statistics 
mortality data using each patient’s unique National Health Service number. Patients were 
followed-up for their vital status with censoring at the end of follow-up on 1st July, 2013 
(Table 1a, Appendix) and survival time calculated from the date of AMI hospitalisation to the 
date of death, date of last information about vital status or the end of the study censoring 
period.  
 
Statistical analyses 
We used percentages to describe categorical variables and means and standard deviations 
or medians and interquartile ranges for continuous normally distributed and non-normally 
distributed variables, respectively. 
 
 9 
 
We used a flexible parametric model to calculate relative survival rate ratio by dividing the 
observed survival of AMI patients by the expected survival of the comparable England and 
Wales populace matched with our cohort by age, sex, year and country. [16,17] From this, 
we estimated the excess mortality rate ratio (EMRR) using a baseline model which adjusted 
for the expected risk of death (derived from the matched general population of England and 
Wales as described above).[18] We built models incrementally to investigate the impact of 
diabetes, other co-morbidities, risk factors and cardiovascular treatments on excess 
mortality. Evidence of excess mortality is observed when the EMRR is greater than 1. An 
EMRR of 1.5, for example, for men/women indicates that men experience a 50% higher 
excess mortality than women. Appropriate model scale and baseline complexity for the 
flexible parametric models were evaluated from the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and 
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) on complete cases (see Table 2a and Table 2b, 
supplementary material). The proportional excess hazards assumption was assessed by 
including interaction terms between three baseline variables (age, sex, calendar year) and 
follow-up time, and using the likelihood ratio test on complete cases. Multiple imputation by 
chained equations was used to impute 10 datasets for STEMI and NSTEMI to account for 
missing data using methods previously defined for MINAP data, [19] and final model 
estimates combined according to Rubin’s rules (see Table 3a, 3b and 3c, supplementary 
material). 
 
All tests were two-tailed, the level of statistical significance pre-specified at 5% (p<0.05) and 
estimates derived with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical analyses were performed 
using Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp) and R version 3.2.1.

Results 
There were 281,259 (40.0%) STEMI and 422,661 (60.0%) NSTEMI of whom 65.6% were 
male. Mean respective ages (SD) were 65.7 (13.6) years and 71.0 (13.4) years for STEMI 
and NSTEMI, respectively. There were 34,348 (12.1%) STEMI and 86,220 (20.4%) NSTEMI 
with diabetes (Table 1). STEMI with diabetes compared with STEMI without diabetes more 
frequently had previous AMI (20.9 vs.10.7%), heart failure (4.0 vs. 1.6%) and chronic renal 
failure (5.5 vs. 1.8%). Similarly, NSTEMI with diabetes more frequently had previous AMI 
(34.9 vs. 22.5%), heart failure (10.5 vs. 5.8%) and chronic renal failure (11.3 vs. 4.6%), 
although at higher rates than among patients with STEMI. The use of a loop diuretic among 
patients with diabetes was higher than for patients without diabetes for STEMI (31.1 vs. 
18.5%) and NSTEMI (43.8 vs. 27.4%). Table 1 also shows that guideline indicated 
pharmacological treatments for AMI were provided at lower rates among patients with 
diabetes for STEMI (all p<0 .001) and NSTEM (all p<0.001). In addition, patients with 
diabetes were less likely to receive reperfusion (73.1 vs. 79.0%) for STEMI. In line with the 
ESC guidelines [14] which recommends that patients with STEMI should receive reperfusion 
therapy within 60 minutes from arrival at a primary PCI centre or 90 minutes from arrival at a 
non-primary PCI centre, we found that a larger proportion of non-diabetic patients (98.3%, 
median 33.0 minutes, IQR, 18.0 to 60.0 minutes) compared with diabetic patients (97.2%, 
39.0 minutes, 22.2 to 72.6 minutes) received timely reperfusion (within 90 minutes). NSTEMI 
diabetic patients were less likely to receive coronary angiography compared with NSTEMI 
non-diabetic (55.4 vs. 60.2%). We found that diabetic patients compared with non-diabetic 
patients were more likely to be seen by a cardiologist (64.0% vs. 58.3%) for STEMI and 
(62.1% vs. 53.8%) for NSTEMI and were slightly less likely to be admitted to a cardiac ward 
versus non-cardiac ward (83.2% vs. 86.1%) for STEMI and (47.0% vs. 48.1%) NSTEMI 
(Table 1).

Survival 
Over 1,944,194 person years at risk, the median time to death was 2.3 (IQR 0.9 to 4.2) 
years, 200,360 (28.4%) died. At all-time points from hospitalisation with AMI, unadjusted 
cumulative relative survival was significantly worse among patients with diabetes (log rank 
tests P<0.001) (Figure 2).  
 
Excess mortality 
Increasing age was associated with excess mortality among STEMI; those older than 85 
years had a 5-fold increase in excess mortality (EMRR 5.14, 95% CI 4.85-5.45) compared 
with patients aged between 66 and 75 years. Excess mortality was significantly lower among 
males than females (EMRR 0.77, 95% CI 0.74-0.80) and for STEMI was lower among 
patients hospitalised between 2012 and 2013 (0.65, 0.62-0.69) compared with 2003 (Table 
2a, Appendix). Similarly for NSTEMI, excess mortality increased with age; patients over 85 
years had a 4-fold increased risk (EMRR 4.67, 95% CI 4.50-4.84), and males also had a 
lower risk of excess mortality (EMRR 0.95, 0.92-0.97). Excess mortality was significantly 
lower in the recent cohort (2012-13) (EMRR 0.55, 95% CI 0.52-0.59).  
 
 14 
 
Effect of diabetes on excess mortality 
After adjustment for age, sex and year of diagnosis, diabetes was associated with a 72% 
higher risk of excess mortality (EMRR 1.72, 95% CI 1.66-1.79) for STEMI and a 67% higher 
risk of excess mortality for NSTEMI (EMRR 1.67, 95% CI 1.63-1.71) (Table 2). For STEMI, 
the effect of diabetes remained despite incremental adjustment for other co-morbidities 
(EMRR 1.52, 95% CI 1.46-1.58), risk factors (1.50, 1.44-1.57) and cardiovascular treatments 
(1.56, 1.49-1.63) (Figure 3). This was also evident for NSTEMI, whereby other co-morbidities 
(EMRR 1.45, 95% CI 1.42-1.49), risk factors (EMRR 1.33, 95% 1.30-1.36) and 
cardiovascular treatments (1.39, 1.36-1.43) only modestly attenuated the long-term effect of 
diabetes on excess mortality (Figure 3). The effect of diabetes on excess mortality remained 
stable between 2003 - 2013 for STEMI (1.39, 1.13-1.71 vs. 1.63, 1.25-2.13) and NSTEMI 
(EMRR, 95% CI 1.35, 1.22-1.49 vs. 1.31, 1.07-1.61) (Figure 4). Similarly, the effect was not 
dissimilar by diabetic group according to: no treatment (newly diagnosed), dietary control, 
oral medications, insulin, and insulin and oral medications combined for STEMI (EMRR, 95% 
CI 1.32, 0.97-1.81), 1.33 (1.21-1.46), 1.51 (1.42-1.60), 1.88 (1.74-2.04) and 1.95 (1.49-2.55) 
and NSTEMI 1.04 (0.83-1.30), 1.17 (1.11-1.24), 1.28 (1.24-1.33), 1.82 (1.75-1.90) and 1.48 
(1.30-1.68), respectively (Table 4a, Appendix). 
 
Other factors associated with excess mortality 
For STEMI, long-term excess mortality was associated with co-morbidity, including previous 
AMI (EMRR 1.25, 95% CI 1.19-1.32), heart failure (1.32, 1.22-1.43), CABG (1.19, 1.07-
1.33), cerebrovascular disease (1.47, 1.39-1.55), peripheral vascular disease (1.44, 1.32-
1.56), chronic renal failure (1.50, 1.39-1.62) and asthma/COPD (1.11, 1.06-1.17). A 
significant reduction of excess mortality was found among patients who had a family history 
of cardiovascular disease (EMRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.71-0.81). STEMI with a systolic blood 
pressure ≤90mmHg (EMRR 2.20, 95% CI 2.07-2.32), heart rate >110 bpm (1.70, 1.61-1.80), 
 15 
 
who smoked (1.05, 1.01-1.09), had an elevated cardiac troponin (1.16, 1.07-1.26) and were 
taking a loop diuretic (1.34, 1.28-1.40) at their time of hospitalisation had significantly 
elevated risk of excess mortality. The strongest determinant, however, was cardiac arrest 
(EMRR 6.04, 95% CI 5.80-6.28). We found that patients who had a cardiac arrest after 
admission to hospital had higher excess mortality compared to those who had a pre-hospital 
cardiac arrest , for STEMI (EMRR, 95 CI% 6.40, 6.13- 6.67 vs. 3.64, 3.40-3.89) and NSTEMI 
(EMRR, 95 CI% 6.78, 6.51-7.05 vs. 4.69 4.34-5.07). Excess mortality was significantly 
reduced among STEMI who received aspirin (EMRR 0.56, 95% CI 0.52-0.60), �-blockers 
(0.51, 0.48-0.54), statins (0.43, 0.40-0.46), ACEI/ARBs (0.50, 0.46-0.53) and thienopyridine 
inhibitors (0.88, 0.79-0.97). Cardiac rehabilitation (EMRR 0.24, 95% CI 0.23-0.25) and 
reperfusion therapy (0.83, 0.79-0.86) were also significantly associated with reduced excess 
mortality (Figure 3). 
 
For NSTEMI, excess mortality was significantly associated with previous AMI (EMRR 1.25, 
95% CI 1.22-1.29), heart failure (1.32, 1.28-1.37), cerebrovascular disease (1.28, 1.24-1.31), 
peripheral vascular disease (1.41, 1.37-1.47), chronic renal failure (1.43, 1.38-1.48) and 
asthma/COPD (1.17, (1.13-1.20). Excess mortality was significantly reduced among 
NSTEMI with a family history of cardiovascular disease (EMRR 0.68, 95% CI 0.65-0.71). 
NSTEMI with a systolic blood pressure ≤90mmHg (EMRR 1.93, 95% CI 1.84-2.02), heart 
rate >110 bpm (1.35, 1.31-1.39), ST segment deviation on the electrocardiograph (1.31, 
1.28-1.34), elevated cardiac troponin (2.85, 2.65-3.07) and the use of loop diuretic (1.77, 
1.72-1.81) at hospitalisation, had significantly higher risk of excess mortality. As with STEMI, 
the strongest determinant of excess mortality among NSTEMI was cardiac arrest (EMRR 
7.06, 95% CI 6.82-7.30). All guideline-indicated medications were significantly associated 
with reduced excess mortality, including aspirin (EMRR 0.51, 95% CI 0.50-0.53), �-blockers 
(0.57, 0.56-0.59), statins (0.47, 0.46-0.49), ACEI/ARBs (0.62, 0.60-0.64) and thienopyridine 
inhibitors (0.86, 0.83-0.90). For those NSETMI who received coronary angiography (EMRR 
 16 
 
0.17, 95% CI 0.17-0.18) and who had cardiac rehabilitation (0.48, 0.47-0.50), the risk of 
excess mortality was significantly reduced (Figure 3).

Discussion 
This study of more nearly three quarters of a million patients with nearly 2 million person 
years at risk over a 8.4 year follow up period shows a strong and highly significant 
association between diabetes and long-term excess mortality following AMI. The positive 
association between diabetes and excess death was evident for cases of STEMI and 
NSTEMI, and attenuated only marginally by incremental adjustment for co-morbidity, risk 
factors and cardiovascular treatments. Our study provides robust evidence that diabetes is a 
significant long-term population burden among patients who have had AMI.   
 
Patients with diabetes more often presented with NSTEMI, and more frequently were co-
morbid. At presentation, they were more ill – being more likely to have cardiac arrest and 
features of cardiogenic shock. We found that invasive cardiac procedures, such as primary 
PCI and coronary angiography were performed less frequently among those with diabetes 
and, at time of discharge from hospital, they were less frequently prescribed evidence-based 
pharmacological therapies. Patients with diabetes also more frequently had a loop diuretic, 
which likely reflected their nearly 2-fold higher prevalence of heart failure. Notably, these 
findings were consistent across STEMI and NSTEMI.  
 
Relative survival was worse among patients with diabetes compared to the non-diabetic. 
Moreover, survival was worst at all time points among NSTEMI with diabetes, and best 
among patients with STEMI and no diabetes. This divergence in survival occurred 
immediately following AMI and persisted until the end of the study over 8 years later. We 
found that the impact of diabetes on STEMI was not as severe as that of NSTEMI without 
diabetes. NSTEMI, were consistently more co-morbid; for example, they were on average 5 
years older and much more likely to have in addition to diabetes, renal failure, heart failure, 
asthma/COPD, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease and hypertension.  
 18 
 
Co-morbidity, risk factors and cardiovascular treatments all contributed to clinical outcomes 
following AMI. Yet, even when we comprehensively adjusted for these factors, our findings 
of the substantial impact of diabetes on death following STEMI or NSTEMI remained. That 
is, there was significant and continuing excess risk of death associated with diabetes over 
and above case mix and treatments used in the management of AMI. Moreover, the impact 
of diabetes on excess mortality did not change over the period of study, suggesting that 
advances in the management of AMI have not fully addressed the mortality associated with 
diabetes.    
 
To our knowledge, this is the first large scale investigation of the excess mortality associated 
with diabetes following AMI. Although, the role of diabetes in the development of, and 
outcome from, AMI is known,[8,20] no other study has measured at a population level the 
excess risk specifically attributable to AMI and diabetes after adjustment for co-morbidity, 
risk factors and treatments. To undertake this, we used a relative survival approach 
matching cases of hospitalised AMI in England and Wales between 2003 and 2013 by year, 
country, age and sex to populace mortality data. By accounting for deaths that were not 
attributable to the index AMI, our study allows greater insight into the specific effects of AMI 
and diabetes on death.  
 
Others have found that diabetes confers a survival disadvantage following AMI. An 
electronic health record study of 1.5 million patients with AMI found that diabetes was 
independently associated with 7% increased risk of in-hospital mortality.[21] In a previous 
study, we investigated survival trends at 18 months among AMI patients with and without 
diabetes, with similar findings of higher rates of death among patients with diabetes and no 
long-term improvements in outcomes.[8] At 20 years of follow-up the adverse impact of 
diabetes on survival after AMI remains unchanged.[6,22] These research cohorts were, 
 19 
 
however, small, historical and they did not study causes of death. Given recent evidence 
suggesting that for patients with an index cardiac event, death at long-term follow-up is 
predominantly determined by non-cardiovascular factors,[4,5] we performed relative survival 
analyses to mitigate possible over-inflation of the effect of diabetes on death associated with 
AMI.  
 
Despite adjustment for case mix, risk and treatments, the impact of diabetes on excess 
mortality persisted. This suggests that additional factors are at play, which if identified and 
addressed could improve survivorship among this vulnerable group. We did not have data 
for medications during follow-up, and it is possible that drug adherence, compliance and/or 
persistence patterns were different between patients with and without diabetes.[23] In 
addition, patients with diabetes and AMI present with and more rapidly accumulate micro-
and macro vascular complications and we speculate that this contributes to their more rapid 
demise. We also noted that on hospitalisation, patient with diabetes had much higher rates 
of heart failure and prescription for loop diuretics suggesting that their presentation was 
complicated by clinical left ventricular dysfunction – a critical prognostic marker.[24] Further, 
a number of studies have debated the importance of glycaemic control during hospitalisation 
for AMI, and our recent work suggests that admission glucose has a stronger mortality effect 
on NSTEMI than STEMI survival, which was intensified by antecedent diabetes.[25] 
 
Whilst this study has strengths, including the size and quality of the data sets (there are no 
other databases of comparable size, coverage and quality which include all hospitals within 
a country), there were limitations. We did not have information about the treatment of 
diabetes, which if available could have cast light on the real world comparative efficacies of 
diabetic medications on survival following AMI as well as their compliance rates. Even 
though relative survival and excess mortality are novel concepts for the evaluation of 
 20 
 
cardiovascular outcomes,[15] these techniques are well established in cancer epidemiology 
and are particularly important when population mortality rates derived from national life 
tables are unable to account for deaths not due to the condition of interest. Mortality 
estimates of the general population were obtained from national life tables that are stratified 
by age, sex and calendar year. Unfortunately, information on diabetes within these life tables 
was not publicly available in the UK. The prevalence of AMI and diabetes among the general 
population may have, therefore, overinflated our survival estimates.[17,26] Furthermore, 
relative survival for individuals with diabetes may tend to be overestimated because this 
group of patients experience a higher general all-cause mortality than the general 
population. Missing data could have biased the estimates. However, we used multiple 
imputation algorithms to minimise this bias. The corresponding sensitivity analyses 
confirmed consistent results irrespective of the method adopted (see supplement). It is 
probable that factors beyond the hospital stay (such as drug adherence and primary care 
visits) may also have influenced survival. Finally, the relative survival models disclosed show 
many important associations, but cannot provide evidence for causation.   
 
In conclusion, data from the largest AMI registry provides evidence to suggest that diabetes 
was common at time of AMI and associated with significant long-term excess mortality, over 
and above the effects of co-morbidity, risk factors and cardiovascular treatments. Future 
research should concentrate on reducing the long-term burden of cardiovascular disease 
among patients with diabetes.
