Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), caused by mutations in the X-linked dystrophin gene (DMD), is characterized
by fatal degeneration of striated muscles. Dilated cardiomyopathy is one of the most common lethal features of the
disease. We deployed Cpf1, a unique class 2 CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)
effector, to correct DMD mutations in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and mdx mice, an
animal model of DMD. Cpf1-mediated genomic editing of human iPSCs, either by skipping of an out-of-frame DMD
exon or by correcting a nonsense mutation, restored dystrophin expression after differentiation to cardiomyocytes
and enhanced contractile function. Similarly, pathophysiological hallmarks of muscular dystrophy were corrected in mdx
mice following Cpf1-mediated germline editing. These findings are the first to show the efficiency of Cpf1-mediated
correction of genetic mutations in human cells and an animal disease model and represent a significant step toward
therapeutic translation of gene editing for correction of DMD.
INTRODUCTION
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disease
caused bymutations inthe gene codingfor dystrophin, which isa large
cytoskeletal protein essential for the integrity of muscle cell mem-
branes (1). DMD causes progressive muscle weakness, culminating in
premature death by the age of 30 years, generally from cardiomyopathy.
There is no effective treatment for this disease. Numerous approaches to
rescue dystrophin expression in DMD have been attempted, including
delivery of truncated dystrophin or utrophin by recombinant adeno-
associated virus (AAV) (2, 3) and skipping of mutant exons with antisense
oligonucleotides and small molecules (4). However, these approaches can-
notcorrectDMDmutationsorpermanentlyrestoredystrophinexpression.
The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats) system functions as an adaptive immune system in bacteria
and archaea that defends against phage infection (5). In this system, an
endonuclease is guided to specific genomic sequences by a single guide
RNA (sgRNA), resulting in DNA cutting near a protospacer adjacent
motif (PAM) sequence. The CRISPR-Cas (CRISPR-associated pro-
teins) system represents a promising approach for correction of diverse
geneticdefects(6–12).However,manychallengesremaintobeaddressed.
For example, Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), currently the most
widely used Cas9 endonuclease, has a G-rich PAM requirement (NGG)
that excludes genome editing of AT-rich regions (13). Additionally, the
large size of SpCas9 reduces the efficiency of packaging and delivery in
low-capacity viral vectors, such as AAV vectors. The Cas9 endonuclease
from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9), although smaller in size than
SpCas9, has a PAM sequence (NNGRRT) that is longer and more
complex, thus limiting the range of its genomic targets (13). Smaller
CRISPR enzymes with greater flexibility in recognition sequence and
comparable cutting efficiency would facilitate precision gene editing,
especially for translational applications.
Recently, a new RNA-guided endonuclease, named Cpf1 (CRISPR
from Prevotella and Francisella 1), was shown to be effective in mam-
malian genome cleavage (14–18). Cpf1 has several unique features that
expand its genome editing potential: (i) Cpf1-mediated cleavage is
guided by a single and short crRNA (abbreviated as gRNA), whereas
Cas9-mediated cleavage is guided by a hybrid of CRISPR RNA (crRNA)
and a long trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) (19). (ii) Cpf1 prefers a
T-rich PAM at the 5′ end of a protospacer, whereas Cas9 requires a
G-rich PAM at the 3′ end of the target sequence. (iii) Cpf1-mediated
cleavage produces a sticky end distal to the PAM site, which activates
DNA repair machinery, whereas Cas9 cutting generates a blunt end.
(iv) Cpf1 also has ribonuclease activity, which can process precursor
crRNAs to mature crRNAs (14, 20). Like Cas9, Cpf1 binds to a targeted
genomic site and generates a double-stranded break, which is then
repaired either by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or by homology-
directed repair (HDR) if an exogenous template is provided. Although
Cpf1 has been shown to be active in mammalian genome editing (14–17),
its potential usefulness for correction of genetic mutations in mamma-
lian cells and animal models of disease has yet to be demonstrated.
Previously, we and others used CRISPR-Cas9 to correct the DMD
mutation in mice and human cells (7, 9, 10, 21–23). Here, we show that
Cpf1 provides a robust and efficient RNA-guided genome editing sys-
tem that can be used to permanently correctDMD mutations by different
strategies, thereby restoring dystrophin expression and preventing pro-
gression of the disease. These findings provide a new approach for the
permanent correction of human genetic mutations.
RESULTS
Correction of DMD iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes by
Cpf1-mediated genome editing
Exon deletions preceding exon 51 of the human DMD gene, which
disrupt the open reading frame (ORF) by juxtaposing out-of-frame
exons, represent the most common type of human DMDmutation (24).
Skipping of exon 51 can, in principle, restore the DMD ORF in 13% of
DMD patients with exon deletions (25). To test the potential of Cpf1

 to correct this type of “hotspot” mutation, we used DMD patient
fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Riken
HPS0164; abbreviated as Riken51), which harbor a deletion of exons
48 to 50, introducing a premature termination codon within exon 51
(Fig. 1A).
The splice acceptor region is generally pyrimidine-rich (26), which
creates an ideal PAM sequence for genome editing by Cpf1 endo-
nuclease (Fig. 1B). To rescue dystrophin expression in Riken51 iPSCs,
we used a Cpf1 gRNA to target exon 51, introducing small insertions
and deletions (INDELs) in exon 51 by NHEJ and subsequently refram-
ing the dystrophin ORF, theoretically, in one-third of corrected genes, a
process we refer to as “reframing” (Fig. 1A). We also compared two
Cpf1 orthologs, LbCpf1 (from Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006)
and AsCpf1 (from Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6), which use the same
PAM sequences for genome cleavage.
Cpf1 cleavage was targeted near the T-rich splice acceptor site of ex-
on 51 using a gRNA (designated g1) (Fig. 1C), which was cloned into
the pLbCpf1-2A-GFP and pAsCpf1-2A-GFP plasmids (Fig. 1D).
These plasmids express human codon-optimized LbCpf1 or AsCpf1,
plus green fluorescent protein (GFP), enabling fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) of Cpf1-expressing cells (Fig. 1D). Initially, we eval-
uated the cleavage efficiency of Cpf1 editing with g1 in human 293T
cells. Both LbCpf1 and AsCpf1 efficiently induced DNA cleavage with
g1, as detected using the T7E1 assay that recognizes and cleaves non-
perfectly matched DNA (Fig. 1E).
Next, we used LbCpf1 and AsCpf1 with g1 to edit Riken51 iPSCs,
and using the T7E1 assay, we observed genome cleavage at DMD exon
51 (Fig. 1E). Genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from
the Cpf1-edited DMD exon 51 were cloned and sequenced (fig. S1A).
We observed INDELs near the exon 51 splice acceptor site in both
LbCpf1- and AsCpf1-edited Riken51 iPSCs (fig. S1A). Single clones
from a mixture of reframed Riken51 iPSCs were picked and expanded,
and the edited genomic region was sequenced. Of the 12 clones, we
observed 4 cloneswith reframed DMD exon 51, whichrestored the ORF
(fig. S1B).
Restoration of dystrophin expression in DMD iPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes after Cpf1-mediated reframing
Riken51 iPSCs edited by CRISPR-Cpf1 using the reframing strategy
were induced to differentiate into cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2A) (27). Car-
diomyocytes with the reframed DMD gene were identified by reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) using a forward primer targeting exon
47 and a reverse primer targeting exon 52, and the PCR products were
sequenced (Fig. 2, B and C). Uncorrected iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes
have a premature termination codon following the first eight amino
acids encoded by exon 51 (Fig. 2C). Cardiomyocytes differentiated
from Cpf1-edited Riken51 iPSCs showed restoration of the DMD
ORF, as seen by sequencing of the RT-PCR products from
amplification of exons 47 to 52 (Fig. 2C). We also confirmed resto-
ration of dystrophin protein expression by Western blot analysis and
immunocytochemistry using a dystrophin antibody (Fig. 2, D and E).
Even without clonal selection and expansion, cardiomyocytes differen-
tiated from Cpf1-edited iPSC mixtures showed levels of dystrophin pro-
tein comparable to wild-type (WT) cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2D).
From mixtures of LbCpf1-edited Riken51 iPSCs, we picked two
clones (clones #2 and #5) with in-frame INDELs of different sizes
and differentiated the clones into cardiomyocytes. Clone #2 had an
8-bp deletion at the 5′ end of exon 51, together with an endogenous
deletion of exons 48 to 50. The total 405-bp deletion restored the DMD

DMD deletion of exons 48 to 50 results in splicing of exons 47 to 51, generating an out-
of-frame mutation of dystrophin. Two strategies were used for the restoration of dys-
trophin expression by Cpf1. In the“reframing” strategy, smallINDELs in exon 51 restore the
proteinreadingframeofdystrophin.The“exonskipping”strategyisachievedbydisruption

 ORF and allowed for the production of a truncated dystrophin protein
with a 135–amino acid deletion. Clone #5 had a 17-bp deletion in exon
51 and produced dystrophin protein with a 138–amino acid deletion.
Although there is high efficiency of cleavage by Cpf1, the amount of
DNA inserted or deleted at the cleavage site varies. Additionally, INDELs
can generate extra codons at the edited locus, causing changes of the
ORF. The dystrophin protein expressed by clone #2 cardiomyocytes
generated an additional four amino acids (Leu-Leu-Leu-Arg) between
exon 47 and exon 51, whereas dystrophin protein expressed by clone #5
cardiomyocytes generated only one additional amino acid (Leu). From
both clones #2 and #5, we observed restored dystrophin protein by
Westernblotanalysisandimmunocytochemistry(Fig.2,FandG).Because
of the large size of dystrophin, the internally deleted forms migrated
similarly to WT dystrophin on SDS–polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis.
We also performed functional analysis of DMD iPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes by measuring mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy
number and cellular respiration rates. Uncorrected DMD iPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes had significantly fewer mitochondria than the LbCpf1-
corrected cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2H). After LbCpf1-mediated reframing,
both corrected clones restored mitochondrial number to a level compa-
rable to that of WT cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2H). Clone #2 iPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes also showed an increase in oxygen consumption rate
(OCR) compared to uncorrected iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes at
baseline (Fig. 2I). OCR was inhibited by oligomycin in all iPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes, and treatment with the uncoupling agent FCCP
(carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) enhanced
OCR. Finally, treatment with rotenone and antimycin A further inhibited
OCR in all cardiomyocytes. These results demonstrate that Cpf1-
mediated DMD correction improved respiratory capacity of mitochon-
dria in corrected iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Our findings show that
Cpf1-mediated reframing is a highly efficient strategy to rescue DMD
phenotypes in human cardiomyocytes.
Restoration of dystrophin expression in DMD iPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes by Cpf1-mediated exon skipping
In contrast to the single gRNA-mediated reframing method, which in-
troduces small INDELs, exon skipping uses two gRNAs to disrupt splice
sites and generates a large deletion (Fig. 3A). As an independent strategy
to restore dystrophin expression in the Riken51 iPSCs, we designed two
LbCpf1 gRNAs (g2 and g3) that target the 3′ end of intron 50 and tested
the cleavage efficiency in human 293T cells. The T7E1 assay showed
that g2 had higher cleavage efficiency within intron 50 compared to
g3 (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we co-delivered LbCpf1, g2, and g1 (g1 targets
the 5′ region of exon 51) into Riken51 iPSCs, with the aim of disrupting
the splice acceptor site of exon 51. Genomic PCR showed a lower band
in LbCpf1-edited iPSCs (Fig. 3C), and sequencing data confirmed the
presence of a deletion of ~200 bp between intron 50 and exon 51, which
disrupted the conserved splice acceptor site (Fig. 3D).
Targeting specificity of Cpf1 was evaluated using the top 10 potential
genome-wide off-target sites (OT-01 to OT-10) for each gRNA, as pre-
dicted by Cas-OFFinder (www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/) (tables S1
and S2). Efficient cleavage bands were observed at the on-target site,
and most of the off-target sites did not show a detectable cleavage band
by the T7E1 assay (fig. S2) or by quantitative capillary electrophoresis
using a fragment analyzer (figs. S3 and S4).
Riken51 iPSCs edited by the exon skipping strategy with g1 and g2
were differentiated into cardiomyocytes. Cells harboring the edited DMD
allele were identified by RT-PCR using a forward primer targeting exon
47 and a reverse primer targeting exon 52, showing deletion of the exon

 51 splice acceptor site, which allows skipping of exon 51 (Fig. 3E). Se-
quencing of the RT-PCR products confirmed that exon 47 was spliced
to exon 52, which restored the DMD ORF (Fig. 3F). Western blot anal-
ysisandimmunocytochemistry confirmedtherestorationofdystrophin
protein expression in a mixture of LbCpf1-edited cardiomyocytes with
g1 and g2 (Fig. 3, G and H). Thus, Cpf1 editing by the exon skipping
strategy is highly efficient in rescuing the DMD phenotype in human
cardiomyocytes.
Restoration of dystrophin in mdx mice by
Cpf1-mediated correction
To further evaluate the potential of Cpf1-mediated Dmd correction in
vivo, we used LbCpf1 to permanently correct the mutation in the germ
line of mdx mice by HDR-mediated correction or NHEJ-mediated re-
framing. mdx mice carry a nonsense mutation in exon 23 of the Dmd
gene because of a C-to-T transition (Fig. 4A). Three gRNAs (g1, g2, and
g3) that target exon 23 were screened and tested in mouse 10T1/2 fibro-
blasts for cleavage efficiency (Fig. 4B). The T7E1 assay revealed that
LbCpf1 and AsCpf1 had different cleavage efficiencies at Dmd exon
23 (Fig. 4C). On the basis of sequencing results, LbCpf1-mediated ge-
nome editing using g2 generated a greater occurrence of INDELs in
mouse fibroblasts compared to g3 (fig. S1C).
LbCpf1 editing with g2 recognizes a PAM sequence 9 bp upstream
of the mutation site and creates a staggered double-stranded DNA cut
8 bp downstream of the mutation site (Fig. 4D). To obtain HDR genome
editing, we used a 180-bp single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN)
in combination with LbCpf1 and g2, because it has been shown that
ssODNs are more efficient in introducing small genomic modifications
than double-stranded donor plasmids (6, 7). We generated an ssODN
containing 90 bp of sequence homology flanking the cleavage site,
including four silent mutations and a Tse I restriction site to facilitate
genotyping, as previously described (7). This ssODN was designed to
be used with LbCpf1 and g2 to correct the C-to-T mutation within Dmd
exon 23 and to restore dystrophin in mdx mice by HDR.
Correction of muscular dystrophy in mdx mice by
LbCpf1-mediated HDR or NHEJ
mdx zygotes were coinjected with in vitro transcribed LbCpf1 mRNA,
in vitro transcribed g2 gRNA, and 180-bp ssODN and reimplanted into
pseudopregnant females (Fig. 5A). Three litters of LbCpf1-edited mdx
mice were analyzed by the T7E1 assay and Tse I RFLP (restriction frag-
ment length polymorphism) (Fig. 5, B and C). Of the 24 pups born, 12
were T7E1-positive and 5 carried corrected alleles (mdx-C1 to mdx-C5),
as detected by Tse I RFLP and sequencing (Fig. 5, C and D). Skeletal
muscles (tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius/plantaris) from WT,
mdx, and LbCpf1-corrected mdx-C mice were analyzed at 4 weeks of
age. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of muscle showed fibrosis
and inflammatory infiltration in mdx muscle, whereas LbCpf1-
corrected (mdx-C) muscle displayed normal muscle morphology and
no signs of a dystrophic phenotype (Fig. 5E and fig. S5, A and B). Im-
munohistochemistry showed the absence of dystrophin-positive fibers
in muscle sections of mdx mice, whereas mdx-C muscle corrected by
LbCpf1-mediated HDR showed dystrophin protein expression in a ma-
jority of muscle fibers (Fig. 5F and fig. S5, A and B).
Additionally, we performed histological analysis of different tissues
from multiple mdx-C mice with correction rates from 8 to 50%. All
LbCpf1-corrected mdx-C mice showed restored dystrophin expression
in multiple tissues, including skeletal muscles, heart, and brain (figs. S6
and S7). Muscle of mdx-C mice with 50% genomic correction showed
full restoration of dystrophin protein and displayed no sign of fibrosisor
inflammatory infiltration, which is consistent with our previous study
(7). Western blot analysis showed expression of dystrophin protein in
multiple skeletal muscle groups, heart, and brain (fig. S8), consistent
with percentages of dystrophin-positive fibers seen with immunohisto-
chemistry (fig. S6).
LbCpf1-mediated correction of the Dmd mutation in germ cells was
evaluated in eggs and sperm of LbCpf1-corrected mdx-C mice by T7E1
assays and Tse I RFLP. All LbCpf1-corrected mdx-C mice carried a
corrected allele in their germ cells (fig. S9). Genome editing efficiency

 of Cas9 and LbCpf1 was compared at the Dmd exon 23 locus, and no
significant difference was observed (table S3).
Physiological and functional analyses were also performed in
WT, mdx, and LbCpf1-corrected mdx-C mice. Serum creatine kinase
(CK) levels were decreased substantially in mdx-C mice and were
inversely correlated with the percentage of genome correction (Table
1). The forelimb grip strength test indicated that LbCpf1-corrected
mdx-C mice had improved muscle strength compared to mdx mice
(Table 1).
DISCUSSION
Here, we show that the newly discovered CRISPR-Cpf1 nuclease can
efficiently correct DMD mutations in patient-derived iPSCs and mdx
mice, allowing for restoration of dystrophin expression. Lack of dystro-
phin in DMD has been shown to disrupt the integrity of the sarcolem-
ma, causing mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress (28, 29).
We found increased mtDNA and higher OCRs in LbCpf1-corrected
iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes compared to uncorrected DMD iPSC-
derived cardiomyocytes. Metabolic abnormalities of human DMD
iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were also rescued by Cpf1-mediated ge-
nomic editing. Our findings also demonstrated the robustness and ef-
ficiency of Cpf1 in mouse genome editing. By using HDR-mediated
correction, the ORF of the mouse Dmd gene was completely restored,
and pathophysiological hallmarks of the dystrophic phenotype, such as
fibrosis and inflammatory infiltration, were also rescued.
Two different strategies—reframing and exon skipping—were ap-
plied to restore the ORF of the DMD gene using LbCpf1-mediated ge-
nome editing. Reframing creates small INDELs and restores the ORF by
placing out-of-frame codons in frame. Only one gRNA is required for
reframing. Although we did not observe any differences in subcellular
localization between WT dystrophin protein and reframed dystrophin
protein by immunocytochemistry, we observed differences in dystrophin
expression level, mtDNA quantity, and OCR in different edited clones,
suggesting that reframed dystrophin may not be structurally or func-
tionally identical to WT dystrophin.
Various issues should be considered with respect to the use of one or
two gRNAs with Cpf1 editing. Here, we show that two gRNAs are more
effective than one gRNA for disruption of the splice acceptor site com-
pared to reframing. When using two gRNAs, Cpf1 editing excises the
intervening region and not only removes the splice acceptor site but also
can be designed to remove deleterious “AG” nucleotides, eliminating
the possibility of generating a pseudosplice acceptor site. However, with
two gRNAs, there is the necessity that both gRNAs cleave simulta-
neously, which may not occur. If only one of the two gRNAs cleaves,
the desired deletion will not be generated. However, there remains the
possibility that cleavage with one of the two gRNAs will generate
INDELS at the targeted exon region, reframing the ORF, because in the-
ory, one-third of the INDELS will be in frame. Using one gRNA to dis-
rupt the splice acceptor site seems more efficient because it eliminates
the needfortwosimultaneouscutstooccur.However,thereisuncertainty

 editing. With one gRNA, there remains the possibility of leaving exonic
AG nucleotides near the cleavage site, which can serve as an alternative
pseudosplice acceptor site.
With its unique T-rich PAM sequence, Cpf1 further expands the
genome editing range of the CRISPR family, which is important for
potential correction of other disease-related mutations because not all
mutation sites contain G-rich PAM sequences for SpCas9 or PAMs for
other Cas9 orthologs. Moreover, the staggered cut generated by Cpf1
may also be advantageous for NHEJ-mediated genome editing (30).
Finally, the LbCpf1 used in this study is 140 amino acids smaller than
the most widely used SpCas9, which would enhance packaging and
delivery by AAV.
Our off-target analysis by T7E1 assays and quantitative capillary
electrophoresis using a fragment analyzer showed similar results to
previous reports (16, 17), indicating that LbCpf1 and AsCpf1 had high
genome-wide targeting efficiency and high specificity comparable to
those of SpCas9. This is reflective of LbCpf1 and AsCpf1 not tolerating
mismatches at the 5′ PAM proximal region, thereby lessening the fre-
quency of off-targeting effect.
Our findings show that Cpf1 is highly efficient in correcting human
DMD and mouse Dmd mutations in vitro and in vivo. CRISPR-Cpf1–
mediated genome editing represents a new and powerful approach to
permanently eliminate genetic mutations and rescue abnormalities as-
sociated with DMD and other disorders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Generation of pLbCpf1-2A-GFP and
pAsCpf1-2A-GFP plasmids
Human codon-optimized LbCpf1 and AsCpf1 were PCR-amplified from
the pY016 plasmid (14) (pcDNA3.1-hLbCpf1), a gift from F. Zhang
(Addgene plasmid #69988), and the pY010 plasmid (14) (pcDNA3.1-
hAsCpf1), a gift from F. Zhang (Addgene plasmid #69982), respectively.
Cpf1 complementary DNA (cDNA) and T2A-GFP DNA fragment
were cloned into the backbone of the pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458)
plasmid (13), a gift from F. Zhang (Addgene plasmid #48138), which
was cut with Age I/Eco RI to remove SpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP. In-Fusion
HD Cloning Kit (TakaraBio) was used. Cpf1 gRNAstargeting the human
DMD or the mouse Dmd locus were subcloned into newly generated
pLbCpf1-2A-GFP and pAsCpf1-2A-GFP plasmids using Bbs I diges-
tion and T4 ligation. Detailed primer sequences can be found in the
Supplementary Materials (table S4).
Human iPSC maintenance, nucleofection,
and differentiation
HumaniPSCs(RBRC-HPS0164)werepurchasedfromCellBankRIKEN
BioResource Center. Human iPSCs were cultured in mTeSR1 medium
(STEMCELL Technologies) and passaged approximately every 4 days
(1:18 split ratio). One hour before nucleofection, iPSCs were treated
with 10 mM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632) and dissociated into single cells
using Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies Inc.). iPSCs (1 × 106)
were mixed with 5 mg of the pLbCpf1-2A-GFP or pAsCpf1-2A-GFP
plasmid and nucleofected using the P3 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector
X Kit (Lonza) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After nucleo-
fection, iPSCs were cultured in mTeSR1 medium supplemented with
10 mM ROCK inhibitor, penicillin-streptomycin (1:100) (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), and Primocin (100 mg/ml; InvivoGen). Three days
after nucleofection, GFP(+) and GFP(−) cells were sorted by FACS and
subjected to the T7E1 assay. Single clones derived from GFP(+) iPSCs
were picked and sequenced. iPSCs were induced to differentiate into
cardiomyocytes, as previously described (27).
Genomic DNA isolation
Genomic DNA of mouse 10T1/2 fibroblasts and human iPSCs was
isolated using a Quick-gDNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Reverse transcription PCR
RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was synthesized using the iScript
Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. RT-PCR was performed using primers
flanking DMD exons 47 and 52 (forward, 5′-CCCAGAAGAGCAA-
GATAAACTTGAA-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCTGTTCCAAATCCTGC-
TTGT-3′). RT-PCR products amplified from WT cardiomyocytes,
uncorrected cardiomyocytes, and exon 51–skipped cardiomyocytes
were 712, 320, and 87 bp, respectively.
Dystrophin Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis for human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes was
performed, as previously described (7), using a rabbit anti-dystrophin
antibody (Abcam, ab15277) and a mouse anti-cardiac myosin heavy
chain antibody (Abcam, ab50967). For mouse skeletal muscles, heart,
and brain, the Western blot was performed, as previously described
(7), using a mouse anti-dystrophin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, D8168)
and a mouse anti-vinculin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, V9131).
Dystrophin immunocytochemistry
and immunohistochemistry
iPSC-derivedcardiomyocytes were fixedwithacetone, blocked with ser-
um cocktail [2% normal horse serum/2% normal donkey serum/0.2%
bovine serum albumin (BSA)/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)], and
incubated with a dystrophin antibody (MANDYS8, 1:800; Sigma-
Aldrich) and troponin I antibody (H170, 1:200; Santa Cruz Bio-
technology) in 0.2% BSA/PBS. Following overnight incubation at
4°C, they were incubated with secondary antibodies [biotinylated
horse anti-mouse immunoglobulinG(IgG),1:200(VectorLaboratories),
and fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, 1:50 (Jackson Immu-
noResearch)] for 1 hour. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342
(Molecular Probes).
Immunohistochemistry of skeletal muscles, heart, and brain was
performed, as previously described (7, 12), using a dystrophin antibody
(MANDYS8, 1:800; Sigma-Aldrich). Nuclei were counterstained with
Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes).
mtDNA copy number quantification
Genomic DNA and mtDNA were isolated using TRIzol, followed by
back extraction, as previously described (31). KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR
Kit (Kapa Biosystems) was used to perform real-time PCR to quantita-
tively determine mtDNA copy number. Human mitochondrial ND1
gene was amplified using primers (forward, 5′-CGCCACATCTAC-
CATCACCCTC-3′; reverse, 5′-CGGCTAGGCTAGAGGTGGCTA-
3′). Human genomic LPL gene was amplified using primers (forward,
5′-GAGTATGCAGAAGCCCCGAGTC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCAA-
CATGCCCAACTGGTTTCTGG-3′). mtDNA copy number per dip-
loid genome was calculated using the following formulas: DCT =
(mtND1 CT – LPL CT) and mtDNA copy number per diploid genome =
2 × 2−DCT.

OCRs were determined in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes using
the XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) following
the manufacturer’s protocol, as previously described (32).
In vitro transcription of LbCpf1 mRNA and gRNA
Human codon-optimized LbCpf1 was PCR-amplified from pLbCpf1-
2A-GFP to include the T7 promoter sequence (table S4). The PCR
product was transcribed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7
Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufac-

The template for LbCpf1 gRNA in vitro transcription was PCR-
amplified from the pLbCpf1-2A-GFP plasmid and purified using the
Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). The LbCpf1
gRNA was synthesized using the MEGAshortscript T7 Transcription
Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Synthesized LbCpf1 gRNA was purified using NucAway spin columns
(Thermo Fisher Scientific).

CRISPR-Cpf1–mediated genome editing by one-cell
embryo injection
All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center. Detailed injection procedures were performed as described pre-
viously (7). The only modification was replacing Cas9 mRNA and Cas9
gRNAs with LbCpf1 mRNA and LbCpf1 gRNAs, respectively.
PCR amplification of genomic DNA, T7E1 assay, and Tse I
RFLP analysis
All these protocols were preformed as previously published (7).
Mouse forelimb grip strength test and serum
CK measurement
Grip strength test and serum CK measurement were performed, as pre-
viously described (7), by the Neuro-Models Core Facility and the Meta-
bolic Phenotyping Core at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center, respectively.
Off-target site analysis
Off-target sites were predicted using Cas-OFFinder (www.rgenome.net/
cas-offinder/), and off-target analysis was performed as previously de-
scribed (12). Sequences are provided in the Supplementary Materials
(tables S1 and S2). For capillary electrophoresis, PCR products from
control and treated samples were denatured and reannealed to form
heteroduplex. T7E1-digested DNA samples were visualized by the Frag-
ment Analyzer (Advanced Analytical), which allowed a sensitive, accu-
rate, and fast quantification of percent cleavage. The PCR sample (2 ml)
was diluted with the sample buffer (DNF-910-1000CP CRISPR kit) and
loaded into the 96-well sample plate. Cleavage percentage was cal-
culated by CRISPR Plugin for PROSize 2.0. Expected full-length and
cleavage fragment sizes of PCR samples were entered into the software.
Highlighted fragments with automated scores were shown in figs. S3B
and S4B. Concentration of each peak and percentage cleavage value
were automatically calculated by the software. Reconstructed gel images
from the Fragment Analyzer electropherogram were shown in figs. S3A
and S4A.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was assessed by two-tailed Student’s t test. Data are
shown as means ± SEM. A P < 0.05 value was considered statistically
significant.
