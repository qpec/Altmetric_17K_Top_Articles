Abstract
Background
The FIFA 11+ injury prevention program
has been shown to decrease the risk of soccer injuries in
men and women. The program has also been shown to
decrease time loss resulting from injury. However, previ-
ous studies have not specifically investigated how the
program might impact the rate of anterior cruciate ligament
(ACL) injury in male soccer players.
Questions/purposes
The purpose of this study was to
examine if the FIFA 11+ injury prevention program can
(1) reduce the overall number of ACL injuries in men who
play competitive college soccer and whether any potential
reduction in rate of ACL injuries differed based on (2)
game versus practice setting; (3) player position; (4) level
of play (Division I or II); or (5) field type.
Methods
This study was a prospective cluster randomized
controlled trial, which was conducted in 61 Division I and
Division II National Collegiate Athletic Association men’s
soccer teams over the course of one competitive soccer sea-
son.TheFIFA11+ isa15-to20-minuteon-the-fielddynamic

 warm-up program used before training and games and was
utilized as the intervention throughout the entire competitive
season. Sixty-five teams were randomized: 34 to the control
group (850 players) and 31 to the intervention group (675
players). Four intervention teams did not complete the study
and did not submit their data, noting insufficient time to
complete the program, reducing the number for per-protocol
analysis to 61. Compliance to the FIFA 11+ program, athletic
exposures, specific injuries, ACL injuries, and time loss
resulting from injury were collected and recorded using a
secure Internet-based system. At the end of the season, the
data in the injury surveillance system were crosshatched with
each individual institution’s internal database. At that time,
the certified athletic trainer signed off on the injury collection
data to confirm their accuracy and completeness.
Results
A lower proportion of athletes in the intervention
group experienced knee injuries (25% [34 of 136]) compared
with the control group (75% [102 of 136]; relative risk [RR],
0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.61; p \ 0.001).
When the data were stratified for ACL injury, fewer ACL
injuries were reported in the intervention group (16% [three
of 19]) compared with the control group (84% [16 of 19]),
accounting for a 4.25-fold reduction in the likelihood of
incurring ACL injury (RR, 0.236; 95% CI, 0.193–0.93;
number needed to treat = 70; p \ 0.001). With the numbers
available, there was no difference between the ACL injury
rate within the FIFA 11+ group and the control group with
respect to game and practice sessions (games—intervention:
1.055% [three of 15] versus control: 1.80% [12 of 15]; RR,
0.31; 95% CI, 0.09–1.11; p = 0.073 and practices—inter-
vention: 0% [zero of four] versus control: 0.60% [four of
four]; RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.01–2.59; p = 0.186). With the
data that were available, there were no differences in inci-
dence rate (IR) or injury by player position for forwards (IR
control = 0.339 versus IR intervention = 0), midfielders
(IR
control = 0.54
versus
IR
intervention = 0.227),
defenders
(IR
control = 0.339
versus
IR
interven-
tion = 0.085), and goalkeepers (IR control = 0.0 versus IR
intervention = 0.0) (p = 0.327). There were no differences
in the number of ACL injuries for the Division I intervention
group (0.70% [two of nine]) compared with the control group
(1.05% [seven of nine]; RR, 0.30; CI, 0.06–1.45; p = 0.136).
However, there were fewer ACL injuries incurred in the
Division II intervention group (0.35% [one of 10]) compared
with the control group (1.35% [nine of 10]; RR, 0.12; CI,
0.02–0.93; p = 0.042). There was no difference between the
number of ACL injuries in the control group versus in the
intervention group that occurred on grass versus turf (Wald
chi square [1] = 0.473, b = 0.147, SE = 0.21, p = 0.492).
However, there were more ACL injuries that occurred on
artificial turf identified in the control group (1.35% [nine of
10]) versus the intervention group (0.35% [one of 10]; RR,
0.14; 95% CI, 0.02–1.10; p = 0.049).
Conclusions
This program, if implemented correctly, has
the potential to decrease the rate of ACL injury in com-
petitive soccer players. In addition, this may also enhance
the development and dissemination of injury prevention
protocols and may mitigate risk to athletes who utilize the
program consistently. Further studies are necessary to
analyze the cost-effectiveness of the program implemen-
tation and to analyze the efficacy of the FIFA 11+ in the
female collegiate soccer cohort.
Level of Evidence
Level I, therapeutic study.
Introduction
Soccer-related injuries are a relatively common occurrence
across sex, age, and level of competition. The high
prevalence of soccer-related injury has been well docu-
mented [5, 6, 13, 19, 20, 22, 23, 26, 31, 35]. Injuries
incurred during soccer most commonly involve the lower
extremity and most commonly occur in a game situation
[9, 10, 18, 21]. The National Collegiate Athletic Associa-
tion (NCAA) has reported that the game-related injury rate
in men’s and women’s soccer games ranked third and
fourth for all NCAA sports, respectively [1, 2]. Anterior
cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries continue to consistently
negatively impact recreational, competitive, and profes-
sional athletes globally. There are approximately 200,000
ACL injuries that occur in the United States annually
making it the most commonly injured ligament in the knee
[3, 28]. The NCAA’s Injury Surveillance System (ISS and
DATALYS) reported that the overall ACL injury rates
were 1.45 per 10,000 athletic exposures for female athletes
and 0.60 per 10,000 athletic exposures for male athletes
[48]. Gilchrist et al. [25] noted that 31% of Division I
soccer athletes polled had a history of knee injury and 14%
had a history of ACL injury. The documented increase in
incidence and the increased risk associated with prior knee
injury initiate an obvious concern for the health and
integrity of the articular cartilage of the knee in this young
athletic cohort longitudinally [12, 17, 36, 38, 52].
For the last three decades, there has been a variety of
effective ACL injury prevention programs developed,
namely for high-risk sports [11, 14, 25, 32, 39–41, 46, 47].
Many of these programs have focused specifically on
female athletes [25, 33, 39, 40, 47, 50] and have included a
variety of strengthening, plyometric, and agility-based
drills that addressed the major deficits most commonly
associated with ACL injury [24, 27, 29]. Several programs
have been designed as dynamic warm-up programs to
increase program utilization and compliance and to capi-
talize on the biomechanical advantages associated with
improved joint position sense [39, 45, 47]. Despite the
development and the evolution of the aforementioned
2448

123
 programs, there is a continued and implicit need to address
soccer-related injury in totality. The FIFA 11+ injury
prevention program was designed to address all soccer-
related injuries not only specific to the knee or to the ACL
[47]. It is a dynamic on-the-field warm-up that is time-
efficient and requires no additional equipment. The efficacy
of the program has been documented and decreases in
overall injury rate have been shown in both male and
female soccer players [30, 44, 46, 47]. However, prior
studies did not specifically analyze the ability of the FIFA
11+ prevention program to reduce the number of ACL
injuries in male soccer players.
The purpose of this study was to examine if the FIFA
11+ injury prevention program can (1) reduce the overall
number of ACL injuries in men who play competitive
college soccer and whether any potential reduction in rate
of ACL injuries differed based on (2) game versus practice
setting; (3) player position; (4) level of play (Division I or
II); or (5) field type.
Patients and Methods
As
previously
reported
in
an
earlier
publication,
a
prospective cluster randomized controlled trial was con-
ducted in Division I and Division II NCAA men’s soccer
teams in the Fall 2012 season [46]. Every NCAA member
institution with a men’s Division I or Division II soccer
program (N = 396) was contacted through a formal letter,
email, and a direct phone call. The correspondence
included a hyperlink for a video that featured former and
current prominent US soccer players and a coach who
discussed the nature and importance of prevention in the
sport of soccer (http://vimeo.com/25708967 and http://
vimeo.com/25708960). Of the 396 eligible teams, 299 met
the inclusion criteria. Sixty-five institutions consented to
participate with the male participants from each institution
ranging in age from 18 to 25 years. The additional insti-
tutions opted out of the study noting time restrictions, no
current issues with injuries in their team, not enough
coaching staff to implement the program, not wanting to
implement the program in the competitive fall season, or
lack of interest. Human ethics internal review board
approval was obtained through the Quorum institutional
review board (Seattle, WA, USA).
The inclusion criteria stipulated that each subject was a
male college soccer player between the ages of 18 and
25 years in good academic standing and was medically
cleared to participate in the 2012 season. The teams con-
firmed that they had not participated in an injury prevention
program in the past 4 academic years to avoid subject
contamination. Before simple computer-generated team
randomization, individual player informed consent was
obtained and a documentation of coaching understanding
was signed by each institution to ensure robust compre-
hension of the expectations of study participation.
On computer-generated randomization of the enrolled
institutions, the intervention group received an instructional
FIFA 11+ DVD, prevention manual, and explanatory
placards describing the FIFA 11+ intervention (www.
f-marc.com/11plus). The FIFA 11+ is a 15- to 20-minute
on-the-field dynamic warm-up program used before games
and training performed two to three times a week throughout
the entire season. It includes strength, agility, propriocep-
tive, and plyometric exercises and was designed to reduce
injuries most commonly identified in soccer players.
A secure Internet-based injury surveillance system was
utilized (HealtheAthlete; Cerner Corporation, Overland
Park, KS, USA) by every enrolled institution (control
group and intervention group). Every athletic exposure,
injury incurred (including ACL injury), mechanism of
injury, and date of return to play were entered weekly by
the team’s certified athletic trainer. The environmental
conditions of the ACL injury were also considered with
respect to field type: grass versus artificial turf. Sixty-five
institutions were randomized using a simple computer-
generated randomization and 61 completed the study dur-
ing the Fall 2012 season (August to December): 34 control
institutions (N = 850 athletes; 17 Division I teams [425
players] and 17 Division II teams [425 players]) and 27
intervention institutions (N = 675 athletes; 16 Division I
teams [400 players] and 11 Division II teams [275 players])
(Fig. 1). Demographic information including age, position
played, and leg dominance was also collected. During the
course of the season, the research staff monitored the data
entry for each institution. In the event that no logon to the
injury surveillance system was detected and no data were
uploaded into the system for 14 days, a computer-gener-
ated email was dispersed and a research staff member
followed up immediately. On the completion of the season,
the data entry was confirmed by each certified athletic
trainer and the accuracy and completeness with their
individual institution’s internal data collection system were
established. As a result of the loss of four intervention
teams to followup, a per-protocol analysis of the data was
completed.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted utilizing IBM SPSS
Statistics Editor for MAC Version 24 (IBM Corporation,
Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive and inferential tests were
used to compare the control group and intervention group,
including

(Biostatistics Core Facility University of Delaware, New-
ark, DE, USA). Injury rates were calculated based on
athletic exposures and are expressed as a rate per 1000
athletic exposures.
Results
There were 1305 overall team exposures to the FIFA
11+ in the intervention group (405 games and 900 training
sessions) over the course of the season with an average of

 2.19 FIFA 11+ utilizations over the course of the season
per week. The control group consisted of 850 athletes (34
teams [56%]) who had 44,212 athletic exposures (games:
13,624 and practices: 30,588). The intervention group
consisted of 675 athletes (27 teams; 44%) who had 35,226
athletic exposures (games: 10,935 and practices: 24,291)
(Fig. 1) [46]. There was no difference between the ages of
the athletes at the time of ACL injury (control group:
20.68 ± 1.46 years
versus
intervention
group:
20.40 ± 1.66 years,
range,
20.24–21.81,
p = 0.914)
(Table 1). The risk of ACL injury was lower in the teams
that used FIFA 11+ than in those that did not (1.1% [three
of 19] versus 2.4% [16 of 19]; relative risk [RR], 0.24; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.07–0.81; p = 0.021). When
identifying the mechanism of ACL injury, there was a
higher injury rate in the control group compared with the
intervention group for both contact and noncontact mech-
anisms. For contact ACL injuries, there were fewer injuries
in the athletes who used the FIFA 11+ compared with
those who did not (0.35% [one of seven] versus 0.90% [six
of seven]; RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.03–1.74; p = 0.148). For
noncontact mechanisms, there were fewer ACL injuries in
the athletes who utilized the FIFA 11+ compared with
those who did not (0.70% [two of 12] versus 1.5% [10 of
12]; RR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.06-1.15; p = 0.049), representing
a 75% decrease in noncontact ACL injury (Table 2).
With the numbers available, there was no difference
between the ACL injury rate within the FIFA 11+ and
control groups with respect to game and practice sessions
(games—intervention: 1.055% [three of 15] versus control:
1.80% [12 of 15]; RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.09–1.11; p = 0.073
and practices—intervention: 0% [zero of four] versus
control: 0.60% [four of four]; RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.01–
2.59; p = 0.186) (Table 2).
With the numbers available, there were no differences
associated with player position in either group; the inci-
dence rates for midfielders, defenders, forwards, and
goalkeepers in the intervention group were 0.227, 0.085, 0,
and 0, whereas in the control group they were 0.54, 0.339,
0.339, and 0, respectively (p = 0.207) (Table 2).
We observed no differences with the numbers available
between the ACL injury rates for Division I between
groups (intervention: 0.70% [two of nine] versus control:
1.05% [seven of nine]; RR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.06–1.45;
p = 0.136). However, the risk of injury was lower in the
intervention group than the control group in Division II
athletes (intervention: 0.35% [one of 10] versus control:
1.35% [nine of 10]; RR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02–0.93;
p = 0.042) (Table 2).
A two-way analysis of variance was conducted to
compare the main effects of field type between the inter-
vention group and control group on contact versus
noncontact ACL injury. A logistic linear regression (Pois-
son) analysis was used to compare the number of ACL
injuries between groups, intervention versus control, and
for field types, grass versus turf, because number of ACL
injuries is a count variable and normality was violated for
both groups. There was no difference between the number
of ACL injuries in the control group versus the intervention
group that occurred on grass versus turf (Wald chi square
[1] = 0.473, b = 0.147, SE = 0.21, p = 0.492). There
were no differences in the number of ACL injuries that
occurred on grass between the teams that used the FIFA
11+ versus those that did not (control group: 1.05% [seven
of nine] versus intervention group: 0.7% [two of nine]; RR,
0.36; 95% CI, 0.08–1.73; p = 0.201). However, there were
more ACL injuries that occurred on artificial turf identified
in the control group (1.35% [nine of 10]) versus the
intervention group (0.35% [one of 10]; RR, 0.14; 95% CI,
0.02–1.10; p = 0.049; Table 3).
Discussion
The FIFA 11+ was designed as an injury prevention pro-
gram to address the most common soccer-related injuries.
Unlike
other
injury
prevention
programs,
the
FIFA
11+ was not solely designed to decrease ACL injury
[32, 39–41]. To our knowledge, the degree to which the
program may effectively reduce the rate of ACL injury has
not been examined [30, 37, 44, 47, 50]. This current study
demonstrated that the FIFA 11+ program decreased the
overall incidence rate of ACL injury by 77% in competitive
collegiate male soccer players. There was no difference in
ACL injury rates based on grass, games versus practices, in
Division I athletes, or between player positions. However,
there were fewer ACL injuries incurred in the Division II

 teams that utilized the FIFA 11+ compared with the con-
trol group (p = 0.042). In addition, there were more ACL
injuries that occurred on artificial turf identified in the
control group compared with the intervention group
(p = 0.049).
The study’s limitations include that four intervention
teams were lost to followup and, therefore, an intent-to-
treat analysis was not feasible. A per-protocol analysis was
completed, which might inflate the reported benefit to the
intervention group. This study only involved male soccer
players. The rate of ACL injury in the male collegiate
cohort is typically lower than the female injury rate
[1, 2, 4]. However, the initial study of the FIFA 11+ was
conducted using female soccer players, hence the decision
to study the male population in this specific study [47]. In
addition, the study has been lacking the statistical power to
sufficiently compare ACL injury rates in the various sub-
groups despite the fact that the study encompassed 1525
athletes participating on 61 collegiate soccer teams. The
occurrence of an ACL injury is a relatively rare event, and
as a result of the prospective nature of the study design, we
were limited in our analysis attributable to the low

 incidence rate of ACL injury during the data collection
period. The analysis comparing ACL injury rates in games
and practices, for Division I athletes and for grass injuries,
showed no difference compared with the overall ACL
injury rate and the overall injury rate reported and analyzed
in an earlier publication [46]. Although steps were taken to
mitigate team and player contamination to injury preven-
tion program exposure, we were unable to fully account for
program exposure that may have occurred in the high
school and club soccer setting or in the event that the
athlete transferred from another institution.
This study demonstrated a decreased overall risk of
ACL injury and noncontact ACL injury in men in the
intervention group. The study did not reflect a decrease in
contact ACL injury despite the fact that there was only one
contact ACL injury reported in the intervention group
compared with six in the control group. This may be
explained by the fact that ACL injuries, despite their
deleterious nature, are a relatively rare event in the sport of
soccer, which is evident when analyzing the injury rate.
There was no difference in the male ACL injury rate
between groups with respect to player position. This is
inconsistent with prior research that has demonstrated that
defenders are at a higher risk for ACL injury than other
player positions [10, 53]. A recent study highlighted the
fact that, on video analysis of ACL injuries occurring in the
sport of soccer, 73% of the injuries occurred while
defending [10]. An additional study corroborated these
findings suggesting that the most common playing situa-
tions preceding an ACL injury were defensive in nature
77% of the time: pressing followed by kicking and heading
[53]. Ascertaining meaningful knowledge about the inci-
dence of ACL injury based on the specific demands of
player positioning may allow researchers to improve
existing
injury
prevention
and
reduction
methods
[8, 10, 53].
We did not observe a difference in ACL injury rates
between the FIFA 11+ and control teams in Division I
soccer, but we did observe fewer ACL injuries among
Division II teams that trained using FIFA 11+. Histori-
cally, game and practice injury rates have been shown to be
lower in Division II and III compared with Division I [34].
This might be attributed to differences in the intensity of
play and overall skill level across divisions. This may also
represent an important finding on program delivery and
overall program efficacy. The FIFA 11+ program was
designed to be administered by coaches, parents, or athletes
who may or may not have any medical expertise, clinical
background, or a biomechanical knowledge base. Division
II athletes traditionally are not privy to as many resources
as Division I athletes and may not have direct oversight
during program delivery by a certified athletic trainer or
strength and conditioning coach for every game and
training session. Therefore, the data suggest that this pro-
gram can be effectively implemented without demanding
the presence of a licensed medical professional. This has
important implications from a public health perspective
with respect to cost-effectiveness and the ease of program
implementation [7, 49].
Although the overall risk of injury was not greater on
turf than on grass, the risk of injury on turf was lower in the
group that used FIFA 11+ than the group that did not.
Field type has been discussed in prior work and has often
been found to be associated with an increased risk of ACL
injury in other NCAA sports [15, 16]. Researchers and
clinicians should consider the role that field surface may
play in addition to friction coefficient from the shoe-sur-
face interface and peak torque measures between the shoe
and playing surface [42, 43, 51]. Further clinical investi-
gation is warranted to enhance the understanding of how
these variables may affect the rate of ACL injury.
The results of this study demonstrated the ability of the
FIFA 11+ to decrease the incidence of ACL injuries in
competitive collegiate male soccer players by 77%. This
information may have an important impact on the devel-
opment and advancement of injury prevention protocols
and may mitigate risk to soccer athletes who utilize the
program. This knowledge can provide critical insight to
help reduce the rate of ACL injury in male soccer players,
improve the efficacy of existing ACL injury prevention
protocols, and improve secondary prevention strategies.
Future studies should investigate the efficacy of the FIFA
11+ program with respect to ACL injury prevention in
female collegiate players. In addition, the cost-effective-
ness of utilizing this prevention program in the collegiate
cohort should be analyzed to determine if the cost associ-
ated with program implementation is justified.
