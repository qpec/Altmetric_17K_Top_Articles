context: Medical Education can be delivered in the traditional classroom or via novel 
technology including an online classroom.
Objective: To test the hypothesis that learning in an online classroom would result in 
similar outcomes as learning in the traditional classroom when using a flipped classroom 
pedagogy.
Design: Randomized controlled trial. A total of 274 subjects enrolled in a Neuro-otology 
training program for non-Neuro-otologists of 25 h held over a 3-day period. Subjects 
were randomized into a “control” group attending a traditional classroom and a “trial” 
group of equal numbers participating in an online synchronous Internet streaming 
 
classroom using the Adobe Connect e-learning platform.
interventions: Subjects were randomized into a “control” group attending a traditional 
classroom and a “treatment” group of equal numbers participating in an online synchro-
nous Internet streaming classroom.
Main outcome measures: Pre- and post-multiple choice examinations of VOR, 
Movement, Head Turns, Head Tremor, Neurodegeneration, Inferior Olivary Complex, 
Collateral Projections, Eye Movement Training, Visual Saccades, Head Saccades, Visual 
Impairment, Walking Speed, Neuroprotection, Autophagy, Hyperkinetic Movement, Eye 
and Head Stability, Oscilllatory Head Movements, Gaze Stability, Leaky Neural Integrator, 
Cervical Dystonia, INC and Head Tilts, Visual Pursuits, Optokinetic Stimulation, and 
Vestibular Rehabilitation.
Methods: All candidates took a pretest examination of the subject material. The 2–9 h 
and 1–8 h sessions over three consecutive days were given live in the classroom and 
synchronously in the online classroom using the Adobe Connect e-learning platform. 
Subjects randomized to the online classroom attended the lectures in a location of their 
choice and viewed the sessions live on the Internet. A posttest examination was given 
to all candidates after completion of the course. Two sample unpaired t tests with equal

variances were calculated for all pretests and posttests for all groups including gender 
differences.
results: All 274 subjects demonstrated statistically significant learning by comparison 
of their pre- and posttest scores. There were no statistically significant differences in the 
test scores between the two groups of 137 subjects each (0.8%, 95% CI 85.45917–
86.67952; P = 0.9195). A total of 101 males in the traditional classroom arm had sta-
tistically significant lower scores than 72 females (0.8%, 95% CI 84.65716–86.53096; 
P = 0.0377) but not in the online arm (0.8%, 95% CI 85.46172–87.23135; P = 0.2176) 
with a moderate effect size (Cohen’s d = −0.407).
conclusion: The use of a synchronous online classroom in neuro-otology clinical training 
has demonstrated similar outcomes to the traditional classroom. The online classroom 
is a low cost and effective complement to medical specialty training in Neuro-Otology. 
The significant difference in outcomes between males and females who attended the 
traditional classroom suggests that women may do better than males in this learning 
environment, although the effect size is moderate.

The increasing availability of online learning has increased the 
ability of medical students, residents, fellows, and practicing 
physicians to learn at a distance. Health-care providers have 
become increasingly dependent upon technological methodol-
ogy associated with clinical practice. We have identified a need to 
quantify and qualify the integrity of medical education programs 
that utilize current technology and a further need to choose the 
best technology for the educational task. The online learning 
environment should be contemporary in order to adequately pre-
sent medical education and to contribute clarity to comparisons 
of learning environment. We needed to develop a methodology 
of instruction that is evidence based and current in order to test 
our hypothesis that there is no difference in learning associated 
with a traditional classroom and a synchronous online classroom 
experience.
There are large numbers of educational platforms commer-
cially available, and we had a need to review and understand 
screencasting best practices in order to develop a screencasting 
platform. Screencasting, the capture of computer screen and 
audio content for future dissemination, allows educators to guide 
viewers through the content presented. Viewers are thus able 
to engage the material at their convenience. In 2014, Andrew 
Youngkin described the benefits of screencasting in health 
professional education (1). Such benefits included the enhance-
ment of demonstrations, facilitation of collaborative activities, 
encouragement of communication, and the evaluation of learn-
ing/understanding. Youngkin discussed the use of the “flipped 
classroom” and suggested opportunities for further exploration 
(2). Youngkin noted the use of the “flipped classroom” to improve 
efficiency in curriculum delivery and foster in-depth class discus-
sion and collaborative problem solving.
We have decided to use a flipped classroom in the development 
of our coursework. It was our hope that we would also be able 
to improve the efficiency in our curriculum delivery both in the 
live class and in a live streaming class. Ashley Woodruff’s group 
implemented and assessed the effectiveness of a hybrid learning 
model using screencasting with embedded assessments in patho-
physiology and therapeutics modules (3). Their results showed 
the hybrid model offered a novel method to afford students active 
learning opportunities to progress to higher cognitive domains 
of learning. The implementation of a hybrid model was attractive 
to us as the subject material we teach in neuro-otology is com-
plex and educational models that will facilitate higher cognitive 
domains of learning were ideal.
Amanda Lackey and her group suggested screencasting is an 
opportune time for radiologists to focus on personal productiv-
ity and noted that the ever increasing reliance on computers 
and the Internet has significantly changed the way we work (4). 
They discussed the use of screencasting and other tools that help 
improve collaboration and personal productivity, maximize 
e-learning, and protect valuable digital data. The concept of 
being able to share the computer screen outside of the live class-
room experience was a major part of our project. We desired to 
deliver a robust educational experience to physicians that might 
not be able to attend the live classroom. An understanding of 
screen casting in a medical educational model was certainly 
 
obtainable.
Louw et al. described local and global factors’ impact on the 
need for and provision of the limited transfusion medicine educa-
tion in South Africa. He suggested the inclusion of screencasting 
and online learning into teaching programs (5). Our learners are 
dispersed throughout the world and have told us that they desired 
an online learning experience. Roshan Razik and colleagues 
studied the preferences and attitudes of ophthalmologists toward

screencasting (6). They found practicing ophthalmologists and 
 
residents were interested in screencasting. However, rural 
ophthalmologists preferred live lectures compared to urban col-
leagues. The social atmosphere of an onsite learning environment 
appeared to benefit those ophthalmologists that lived and worked 
in an area without daily professional interplay. These differences 
highlight the importance of knowing the audience when using 
screencasting.
We desired to find out if there was a preference of learning 
between streaming through screencasting and live lectures. 
 
We also wanted to find out if the outcomes would be similar so 
that we might embrace an evidence-based design of an online 
learning program. With existing technology, library users 
have many options for accessing information. Stephanie Kerns 
presented how screencasting and other technologies increased 
flexibility, enhancing learning in many educational settings (7). 
This was helpful to us as we had to be able to choose a platform 
that would enable us to deliver high quality medical education 
to an international audience. In order to do this, we needed to 
understand our audience, their needs, and their learning char-
acteristics. We also knew that our planning of the educational 
experience would be dependent upon our ability to share it well. 
We realized that any educational program should be evidence 
based and contemporary both from a pedagogical and techni-
cal perspective. We needed to develop a curriculum that was 
outcome based with specific goals defined before the curriculum 
was designed. We also wanted to ensure that our curriculum 
 
was designed specific to an outcome that would increase the 
application of neuro-otology skills.
The flipped classroom is an educational model with the poten-
tial to improve the learning environment where students gain 
exposure to new material outside class and then use class time to 
assimilate the knowledge through problem-solving exercises or 
discussion (7). Thus the typical lecture and homework elements 
of a course are reversed or flipped. Thus, the flipped classroom is 
a learner centered approach in which the learner is responsible 
to attend the class with a basic understanding of the subject to 
fully participate and engage in discussions (8). Flipping a class-
room has a number of potential benefits, for example increased 
 
educator-student interaction, but must be planned and imple-
mented carefully to support effective learning (9). Sarah McLean 
and colleagues from Western University in London, ON, Canada, 
suggested that there is the potential for greater educational gains 
from the flipped classroom than the modest improvements in 
grades previously demonstrated in the literature (10). They also 
found that implementation of the flipped classroom resulted in 
students reporting that they developed independent learning 
strategies, spent more time on task, and engaged in deep and 
active learning.
Eunicia Tan and colleagues evaluated the relative acceptabil-
ity of the flipped classroom approach compared with traditional 
didactics for in-house teaching in emergency medicine and con-
cluded that the flipped classroom shows promise as an acceptable 
approach to in-house emergency medicine teaching (11). Helen 
Morgan and her group from the University of Michigan found 
that their implementation of the flipped classroom curriculum 
for gynecologic oncology topics successfully demonstrated a 
promising platform for using technology to make better use of 
their students’ time and for increasing their satisfaction with the 
necessary didactic learning of the clerkship (12). Brent Orndorff 
and colleagues at Indiana University School of Medicine identi-
fied that distance education has been a reality for many years in 
the form of combining traditional classroom instruction with 
web-based educational technologies (13). They noted that limita-
tions remain in established technologies that restrict the types of 
courses offered through this medium. They initiated a program 
to overcome these limitations and allow for a more interactive 
learning experience. They were able to successfully combine 
Adobe Connect software with Polycom videoconferencing. 
Their experimentation with the integration of technologies has 
allowed them to enhance the level of interactivity of student 
learning promoting the remote delivery of the medical school 
curriculum.
Other investigators have described the use of Adobe Connect 
software along with algorithm software to provide the neces-
sary audio visual communication platform for telementoring 
a complex medical procedure to novice providers located at 
a distant site (14). The teaching efficacy of multipoint video 
teleconferencing is perceived by medical residents to be more 
effective when complemented by application-sharing software 
such as Adobe Acrobat Connect (15). The development of an 
online learning program must utilize appropriate technology 
and identify problems in learning that maybe associated with 
distance learning. Manwa Ng and colleagues have identified 
problem-based learning (PBL) as an effective pedagogical tool 
for promoting student competencies in self-directed and col-
laborative learning, critical thinking, self-reflection as well as 
adapting to novel situations (16). They identified that the need 
for face-to-face interactions at the same place and time severely 
limits the potential of traditional PBL. The requirements of 
space and for meeting at a specific location at the same time 
can create timetabling difficulties. Ng’s team designed and 
implemented an online PBL environment using Adobe Connect 
for undergraduate speech/language pathology students, and 
assessing the associated pedagogical effectiveness. They found 
that all students enjoyed online PBL, without any perceived 
negative effects on learning and statistical analysis indicated no 
significant difference in assignment grades between the online 
and traditional PBL groups, indicating that online PBL learning 
appears to be similarly effective as traditional face-to-face PBL 
learning.
Neuro-otology is a specialty discipline that involves the skill 
and training to evaluate parts of the brain and nervous system 
that are associated with hearing and balance in defining the cause 
of a patient’s symptoms. A high level of understanding of the 
brain and vestibular system is necessary to develop meaningful 
treatment paradigms for dizzy patients and for those with dis-
orders of balance, station, and gait. Our neuro-otology training 
program for non-neuro-otologists prepares physicians to master 
complex diagnostic and therapeutic applications in this neuro-
logical subspecialty. Our institution receives weekly requests for 
advanced training in neuro-otology to prepare physicians for 
the societal demands of dealing with falls and other disorders of 
balance. Falls are a leading cause of mortality and fall prevention

programs are being instituted globally. We have a long history 
of training physicians in neurological rehabilitation paradigms 
and have gathered world experts in these clinical areas that are 
qualified to give instruction in neuro-otology.

We identified the need to develop an e-learning system that 
allows us to deliver educational materials in both live virtual 
classrooms as well as an on-demand system. We needed a system 
that allowed us to implement a flipped learning classroom that 
complemented live learner participation in the virtual classroom. 
In order to do this, we needed to be able to have appropriate 
outcome measurements in the form of quizzes, tests, and inter-
active practical demonstrations. Our platform was designed to 
be appropriate to this pedagogical demand. We also needed a 
platform that was robust enough to allow us to screencast our 
classroom educational experience. We had to live stream our 
classes to a global audience that had different Internet speeds 
and different computers, tablets, and smart phones. Advances 
in technology have expanded the educational tools and learning 
options available to medical educators.
Jose Salazar noted that educators must be informed about 
the use of currently available educational technology tools to 
promote student retention, engagement, and interaction in 
online courses. He suggested that successful use of educational 
technology tools requires planning, organization, and use of 
effective learning strategies (17). We agree with this strategy and 
utilized a backwards design of our project. A backward design 
allowed us to create an educational content that allowed us to 
achieve our goals and promote the achievement of goals by our 
learners. The backward design starts with identification of the 
end learning goal or achievement and derives the curriculum 
from the skills necessary to achieve the learning goal. This is 
different from traditional curriculum development that begins 
with standardized texts that are not derived from the desired out-
come. Once the educational content was chosen, we needed to 
choose the computer software that would best allow us to create 
and edit the screencast. Our intervention was the development of 
an e-learning platform that would deliver quality clinical train-
ing to neurologists located in various areas around the world. 
 
The e-learning platform was complemented with a flipped 
classroom paradigm.
We needed to use technology that allowed participants to 
access our learning content with a wide variety of their own 
personal technology. Our research of different methods of deliv-
ery identified that the Adobe Connect Learning systems (18) 
were ideal for our needs and encompassed all of the technology 
necessary to realize our project. The Adobe Connect platform 
allowed us to live stream our lecturers in a fashion that has a 
variety of windows or pods including live video and the abil-
ity to see the instructors as they speak. They also can view the 
instructor’s desktop or PowerPoint presentation at the same 
time and can involve themselves in interactive media. By utiliz-
ing combinations of a variety of pods, both the instructor and 
the learner could manipulate the learning environment to their 
best uses. We developed the ability to have individual learning 
rooms where we could group our learners into specific rooms 
with assignments and moderators. We provided our learners 
the ability to live stream while sharing their own video camera, 
microphone, and screens for a robust interactive experience. 
 
This technology was tried and tested and enabled us to imple-
ment our project without the necessity of developing our own 
interactive learning software.
Although the software contracts are expensive, we had the 
funding and the network to be able to implement this project. 
Our preliminary feedback from learners represents an excitement 
that is associated with great savings in time and expenses that 
ordinarily would be associated with travel to extension facilities 
throughout the world. Our review of the literature specific to the 
flipped classroom demonstrated that this pedagogical scenario 
was appropriate to maximize our efficiency and promote maxi-
mum learning.

An announcement of our neuro-otology program was made on 
our Institutional website and scholars were invited to apply for the 
program. All scholars had to be licensed healthcare professionals 
in active clinical practice. Four hundred seventy-three scholars 
(83 females and 390 males) applied to the program and 274 were 
randomized to this study. We block randomized the applicants 
into two main groups of 137 subjects with careful attention to 
include all of the female applicants equally in each group in order 
to provide a greater appreciation of any gender differences in our 
study. There are gender stereotypes that may affect training for 
physicians in medical specialties such as surgery. We wanted to 
know if there was a gender difference in neuro-otology train-
ing (19). We are also aware that male medical students tend to 
outperform females, while no gender differences were found 
among residents (20). We have a professional and societal need 
to measure any differences or bias in outcomes between males 
and females in neuro-otology training for non-neuro-otologists.
Offers of acceptance into our program were made from our 
randomized total population. Thirty-seven subjects declined to 
participate, and 162 were not accepted due the sample and facility 
size limitations. Scholars that applied to the program and were 
not accepted were given the opportunity to attend the program 
at the next iteration (Figure 1).
All candidates took pre- and posttest multiple choice ques-
tions of the subject material at the beginning and end of course 
at the course location. Both pre- and posttests were multiple 
choice examinations of VOR, Movement, Head Turns, Head 
Tremor, Neurodegeneration, Inferior Olivary Complex, Collateral 
Projections, Eye Movement Training, Visual Saccades, Head 
Saccades, Visual Impairment, Walking Speed, Neuroprotection, 
Autophagy, Hyperkinetic Movement, Eye and Head Stability, 
Oscilllatory Head Movements, Gaze Stability, Leaky Neural 
Integrator, Cervical Dystonia, INC and Head Tilts, Visual Pursuits, 
Optokinetic Stimulation, and Vestibular Rehabilitation.
Our scholars gained exposure to educational material outside 
of the class and then used the class time to assimilate the knowledge 
through problem-solving exercises and discussions. They were 
able to hyperlink to their flipped classroom and the presentations

and interaction were supported by a previous learning experi-
ence gained in the flipped classroom. Sessions were given in the 
classroom and in the online classroom synchronously using the 
Adobe Connect e-learning platform. Subjects randomized to 
the online classroom attended the sessions in a location of their 
choice and viewed the sessions on the Internet. The traditional 
classroom and synchronous online classroom did not review the 
course presentation or offer an on-demand learning paradigm. 
The educational experience was limited to their attendance in the 
two group classes. Two sample unpaired t tests with equal vari-
ances were calculated for all pretests and posttests for all groups 
and were controlled to include gender differences. Effect sizes 
were calculated using Cohen’s d analysis. The internal consist-
ency of the study was estimated across repeated measures, and 
the sources of variance affecting the measurement were analyzed.
Data analysis and statistics
We estimated sample sizes for a two-sample means test using 
our previous unpublished pilot study with a traditional class-
room performance mean of 86.12, SD ± 5.01 and a controlled 
online mean performance of 84.20, SD ± 5.27. This revealed a 
Satterthwaite’s t test assuming unequal variances maintaining 
an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 80% suggesting a sample size 
of 274 with 137 subjects per group allowing for a 20% increase 
to address potential dropouts. Two sample unpaired t tests with 
equal variances were calculated for pretest and posttest results 
for all groups and were controlled to include gender differ-
ences. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d analysis. The 
internal consistency of the study was estimated across repeated 
measures, and the sources of variance affecting the measurement 
were analyzed. All analyses were performed using Stata/SE 14.0. 
 
For all tests, alpha (α) was set at 0.05.

64 representing 202 males and 72 females. Our subjects were 
composed of practicing physicians who desired to learn neuro-
otological examination and treatment skills. These learners come 
from institutions that are globally represented by physicians from 
the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, Spain, 
Holland, England, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, 
Egypt, and Israel. A total of 473 scholars applied to the program.
We wanted to identify any differences in gender in medical 
education because of interest we have specific to gender bias in 
society. Of the applicants, 83 were female and 390 were male. 
We block randomized the applicants into 2 main groups of 137 
subjects each with careful attention to include all of the female 
applicants in order to provide a greater appreciation of any gender 
differences in our study. In order to identify any gender bias, we 
randomized males and females into the two main groups that 
were further subdivided into four separate groups including 
two gender-specific traditional classrooms as a control and two 
gender-specific synchronous online learning experience as an 
active treatment group. Offers of acceptance into our program 
into both main groups were made from our randomized total 
population until we had the necessary numbers of subjects that 
accepted a position to conduct our study. Scholars that applied 
to the program but were not accepted into groups were given the 
opportunity to attend the program at another time or online in a 
non-synchronous fashion.
The accepted subjects were enrolled in a neuro-otology 
clinical program of education of 25 h held over a 3-day period. 
 
The educational settings for our course were varied due to indi-
vidual scholar location. Our program included hands on practical 
experience presented in the clinical setting with patients, patient 
scenarios, and patient simulators. The live synchronous stream-
ing learners needed to have patients or simulated patients or 
colleagues to simulate the case. Potential problems of time zones 
and dates, including holidays, were taken into consideration with 
start times of 0800 EST working well for all learners throughout 
the world. The Europeans were able to meet in the afternoon or 
early evening, while North Americans were able to meet during 
the morning time. Participants in Australasia were in a time zone 
that is roughly 13–14 h ahead of the Eastern Standard Time of 
our institution. Their time zone is approximately 6 h ahead of the 
European time zones. The early morning American participation, 
coupled with the afternoon European anticipation and the late 
evening Australasian participation worked well for our learners.
An analysis of pre- and post-course examinations was 
 
conducted and included the differences between pre- and post-
test scores for all groups. The groups included global test scores 
without delineation of gender, composed of a control (live class-
room scores) and a treatment (online streaming scores), gender-
specific scores composed of a control (live classroom scores), and 
a treatment (online streaming scores). There was strong statistical 
significance in outcomes of the pre-and post examination scores 
for all groups of learners with p < 0.001. The effect sizes were 
moderate for all groups with Cohen’s d of −4.45 to 5.38 (Table 1).
All subjects demonstrated learning by examination with sta-
tistical significance; however, there was no statistical or substan-
tive significance between groups save for a statistical difference 
in total outcome scores between males and females that attended 
the traditional classroom (p < 0.05) with a moderate effect size 
(Cohen’s d = −0.407). The female learners in the traditional class-
room scored higher than the male learners. We looked at the total

DiscUssiOn
This investigation involves the design of a novel synchronous 
educational program utilizing current technology that was 
compared to traditional classroom teaching. Our instructional 
program was designed to address neuro-otology education in 
the classroom and synchronously at a distance while providing 
the evidence-based methodology to evaluate both mechanisms 
of learning. There was no statistically significant difference in 
outcomes between our synchronous online training and the 
traditional classroom experience. Our contribution to the 
understanding of outcomes associated with classroom and syn-
chronous online learning may benefit society in general as well 
as all professional stakeholders. Our objective was to determine 
if learning in a synchronous online classroom would result in 
similar outcomes as the traditional classroom. Our hypothesis 
that learning in an online classroom utilizing best educational 
practices that are dependent upon best technology would 
 
be equal to learning in a traditional classroom was supported 
by our data.
There are current concerns that learning in an online environ-
ment might not represent the quality of education received in 
a traditional classroom. Our study answers this question and 
promotes a confidence in learners that there is no difference 
in outcomes between training in the traditional classroom and 
online synchronous education. The flipped classroom comple-
mented our desire to improve the learning environment. Our 
scholars gained exposure to new material outside of the class 
and then used the class time to assimilate the knowledge through 
problem-solving exercises or discussion that was robust as a 
consequence of our technology. They were able to hyperlink to 
their flipped classroom and the presentations and interaction 
were supported by a previous learning experience gained in the 
flipped classroom. The understanding of material before the 
course sessions promoted an increased quality of understanding 
of the subject with increased quality of participation and engage-
ment in discussions.
Educational solutions increasingly need to be timely, efficient, 
 
pragmatic, high quality, and aligned to the needs of the professional 
in a specific context, sustainable, and cost-effective (21). Katherine 
Barsness and colleagues identified that medical education must 
address all potential cognitive and technical performance gaps, 
professionalism, and personal behaviors, as well as effective team 
communication (22). They suggested that educational strate-
gies should seek to replicate the stressors and distractions that 
might occur during a high-risk operation or critical care event. 
They criticized the traditional medical educational model of “See 
one, do one, teach one,” noting that patients are exposed to the 
risk of harm inherent to any learning curve. Barsness suggests 
that the majority of educational goals can be achieved with the 
addition of simulation-based education as a valuable adjunct 
to traditional training methods. Our instructional intervention 
incorporated instructional technology tools in a meaningful way 
by using a blended approach to education that included Merrill’s 
first principles of instruction. Our instructional methodology 
was problem-based and involved the student in distinct phases 
of learning. Similar to the Kolb cycle of learning, we started our 
class presentation by activating prior experiences of the learner. 
We accomplished this with a flipped classroom methodology that 
allowed the learner to prepare himself/herself for the practical/
clinical and didactic portions of the program. We expected that 
the learner is able to identify strengths and weaknesses that would 
promote long-term learning as a consequence of the activation of 
their prior experiences. We introduced the “what” of the material 
following the first section of instruction. This knowledge base 
was referred to as the breath and death of instruction that was 
necessary to translate the two applications.
Medical education should address the different cultures of learn-
ing of the medical student when they prepare their instructional 
methods and teaching materials to fulfill the educational needs 
of culturally diverse students (23). We recognized the importance 
of this with a global diverse group of scholars attending our 
synchronous online sessions. Our educational program included 
a variety of methods and tools to enhance learning of a consider-
able amount of complex material and to promote critical thinking 
and decision making that is not promoted by traditional didactic 
teaching methods that remain as the predominant teaching

strategies in health-care education (24). The increasing availability 
of newer technology in higher education such as video streaming 
and podcasting provided us the opportunity to utilize a variety of 
approaches to cater for a wider range of learning styles. Students 
find hybrid learning strategies that combine traditional teaching 
with more innovative methods particularly beneficial (25).
The rapid advancement of computer and information tech-
nology in recent years has resulted in the rise of e-learning 
technologies to enhance and complement traditional classroom 
teaching in many fields (26). Hugh Silk and colleagues at the 
University of Connecticut Health Center noted that medical 
educators need to teach learners to efficiently access the best 
available evidence at the point of care and apply it in a patient-
centered manner. They realized that as information becomes 
more readily available via the Internet and handheld computers, 
strategies to use these tools as part of the educational process 
become more important. They concluded that new teaching skills 
are needed when attempting to seamlessly introduce technology 
in the midst of blending old and new teaching methods (27). 
Our synchronous online neuro-otology program can be viewed 
on smart phones, tablets, and computers in any location that has 
an Internet signal. The teaching skills developed in this course 
included an interactive pedagogy that kept the learner engaged 
by requiring participation.
We promoted feedback from our learners with the construc-
tion of interactive tests that were designed for the specific cri-
terion involved in the neurological physical examination. These 
tests served as our summative evaluation, whereas the formative 
evaluation was continuous by its presence in all parts of the 
instructional systems design. We utilized standard measures of 
competency by instituting pre- and post-learning examinations 
and demonstrations. Our investigation promoted the use of a 
mixed methodology of inquiry. Our competency examinations 
lead to well-established quantitative methodology has allowed 
us to make statements specific to statistical and substantive 
significance in our study. We also desired to understand the 
common experiences of learners in a group in order to further 
develop our policies and practices that will affect the delivery 
of our pedagogy. A phenomenological qualitative approach has 
allowed us to accomplish these goals and will be published in a 
follow-up article.
We have identified that women score higher than men in a 
traditional classroom environment studying neuro-otology but 
score similarly in the synchronous online classroom. Other 
investigators have found gender differences in outcomes of 
medical training. For example, clinal clerkship grades in a 6-week 
obstetrics and gynecology have been shown to be significantly 
higher for females than for males and males scored lower on 
OSCE, oral, and NBME subject examinations (28). The difference 
in final grades between genders necessitates further investigation. 
 
We desire to study this phenomenon and suggest that the differ-
ences in traditional classroom performance might be associated 
with the physical interaction between men and women that does 
not occur online. Gender-specific variables will be explored using 
a mixed methodology of inquiry including both ethnographic 
and phenomenological approaches in our continued investiga-
tion of this phenomenon.

This study represents a successful outcome of training in neuro-
otology that might not be representative of other medical educa-
tion. The subjects in the study were all experienced clinicians 
with prior training in neurology. The outcomes of this study 
might be different with a different cohort of health-care provid-
ers. There are several advantages or strengths to both learners 
and faculty involved in our synchronous online learning, for 
example. The ability to attend a clinical program without the 
need of travel and in a location of personal choice appears to 
increase access to the learning program. Physicians that would 
not be able to attend the onsite classroom would not have the 
opportunity to benefit from the learning experience without 
this opportunity. Thus, we feel that the quality of learning and 
the opportunity to develop a self-directed and lifelong learning 
experience is enhanced with the ease of attending educational 
sessions in an online environment. The advances in the software

enabling our program are associated with a facilitation of 
information exchange in a fashion not typical in a traditional 
classroom. Hyperlinks to articles, videos, and demonstrations 
are robust as is the ability to communicate in real time with other 
learners in private chats without disturbing colleagues as in a 
traditional classroom. The ability to post questions and have 
faculty responses in real time are robust as is the experience of 
breakout rooms and group learning experiences.
There are several limitations that we have noted with the 
development of our online synchronous program. The startup 
cost of software, hardware, and technical training for our institu-
tion was expensive and perhaps prohibitive to institutions that 
are not well funded. There is a demand of time for faulty training 
and preparation that is greater than that customarily embraced 
in the traditional classroom. Faculty must prepare themselves 
for the technical demands of live synchronous streaming of 
their presentations and coordinate interactions with learners 
in addition to the demands of presentation of the subject mate-
rial. The utilization of interactive polling and breakout rooms 
demands a fluid technical ability of the faculty and support staff, 
something that is not necessary in the traditional classroom. We 
found that there are always technical issues of our learners in 
the program that need to be addressed in a quick and effective 
manner. Problems with Internet speeds and manipulation of the 
software communication tools including learner cameras and 
microphones demand a talented and qualified support staff that 
might problem solve in real time. We had extensive searches of 
companies and personnel before we were able to build a qual-
ity team. We also needed to run many simulations that would 
involve attending to technical problem with backup procedures 
and equipment.
cOnclUsiOn
There is a need to increase learning and to embrace the change 
in pedagogical methodology in medical education. Traditional 
classroom learning has not changed much in the last 100 years 
in spite of individual studies that show promise for various com-
ponents of educational reform. This study combined the most 
current methodology in medical education with novel delivery 
technological services. The value of the qualitative portion of this 
investigation has guided us toward instituting change necessary 
for future studies and implementation of the consequences of 
this investigation. There has been an explosion of online learning 
available from most institutions of higher learning in the United 
States and globally. There has not been good quantitative and 
qualitative evaluation of these courses.
Online learning is a currently technically available pedagogy 
that has been demonstrated to equal the outcomes obtained in 
the traditional classroom. Physicians might choose to attend an 
online synchronous learning experience that has been associ-
ated with good outcomes of effective earning. Our delivery of 
online synchronous learning scenarios has been demonstrated 
to be as effective as competent traditional classroom learning. 
There is scant literature specific to this exploding phenomenon 
of Internet delivery of education. The contribution of this study 
to an evidence-based model of medical education promotes the 
embrace of a novel pedagogy that ultimately may improve physi-
cian services to humankind by providing easier access to clinical 
education. We can expect to see a change in learning strategies 
with cost savings to individuals and society specific to medical 
education. These changes may be associated with a decreased 
need for brick and mortar facilities as well as travel and expense of 
living for students. We feel that there is a danger of implementa-
tion of novel technology without the benefit and experience of 
good qualified evaluation of the consequence of that intervention. 
We are hopeful that this model might contribute to the science 
of medical education and the training of physicians through 
improvement in pedagogical models and educational delivery.
The literature is scant specific to outcome measurements of 
medical education given at a distance in a synchronous fashion. 
We hope that this study might encourage other medical educators 
to test their outcomes so that physicians might be able to choose 
online courses with greater confidence in their educational and 
clinical integrity.
