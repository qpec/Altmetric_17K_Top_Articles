Abstract
IMPORTANCE Intermittent energy restriction is an alternative weight loss method that is becoming
popular; however, to date, there are no long-term clinical trials of intermittent energy restriction in
patients with type 2 diabetes.
OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of intermittent energy restriction (2 days per week) with those
of continuous energy restriction on glycemic control and weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes
during a 12-month period.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Adult participants (N = 137) with type 2 diabetes were
randomized 1:1 to parallel diet groups (intermittent energy restriction [n = 70] or continuous energy
restriction [n = 67]) between April 7, 2015, and September 7, 2017, at the University of South
Australia. Medications likely to cause hypoglycemia were reduced at baseline according to the
medication management protocol.
INTERVENTIONS An intermittent energy restriction diet (500-600 kcal/d) followed for 2
nonconsecutive days per week (participants followed their usual diet for the other 5 days) or a
continuous energy restriction diet (1200-1500 kcal/d) followed for 7 days per week for 12 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
level, with equivalence prespecified by a 90% CI margin of ±0.5%. The secondary outcome was
weight loss with equivalence set at ±2.5 kg (±1.75 kg for fat mass loss and ±0.75 kg for fat-free mass
loss). All other outcomes were tested for superiority.
RESULTS Of the 137 randomized participants (77 women and 60 men; mean [SD] age, 61.0 [9.1]
years; mean [SD] body mass index, 36.0 [5.8] [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared]; and mean [SD] HbA1c level, 7.3% [1.3%]), 97 completed the trial. Intention-to-
treat analysis showed similar reductions in mean (SEM) HbA1c level between the continuous and
intermittent energy restriction groups (–0.5% [0.2%] vs –0.3% [0.1%]; P = .65), with a between-
group difference of 0.2% (90% CI, –0.2% to 0.5%) meeting the criteria for equivalence. Mean (SEM)
weight change was similar between the continuous and intermittent energy restriction groups (–5.0
[0.8] kg vs –6.8 [0.8] kg; P = .25), but the between-group difference did not meet the criteria for
equivalence (–1.8 kg; 90% CI, –3.7 to 0.07 kg), nor did the between-group difference in fat mass (–1.3
kg; 90% CI, –2.8 to 0.2 kg) or fat-free mass (–0.5 kg; 90% CI, –1.4 to 0.4 kg). There were no significant
differences between groups in final step count, fasting glucose levels, lipid levels, or total medication
effect score at 12 months. Effects did not differ using completers analysis. Hypoglycemic or
hyperglycemic events in the first 2 weeks of treatment were similar between the continuous and

Key Points
Question Is intermittent energy
restriction comparable to continuous
energy restriction for glycemic control in
patients with type 2 diabetes?
Findings In this randomized
noninferiority trial, the mean change in
hemoglobin A1c level after 12 months in
the intermittent energy restriction
group (–0.3%) was comparable to that
of the continuous energy restriction
group (–0.5%), reaching the criterion for
equivalence in intention-to-treat and
completers analysis.
Meaning Intermittent energy
restriction is comparable to continuous
energy restriction for glycemic control in
patients with type 2 diabetes.

Introduction
The health care costs of overweight, obesity, and type 2 diabetes are increasing,1 and conventional
weight-loss diets with daily energy restriction are difficult to adhere to in the long term.2 Intermittent
energy restriction, short periods of severe energy restriction followed by longer periods of habitual
eating, has been suggested as a potential strategy because it offers a reduced burden of dietary
restriction and may therefore be more acceptable.3 In animal studies, intermittent energy restriction
appears to be equally effective as, if not more effective than, continuous energy restriction for the
reduction of disease risk factors.4 Studies in the healthy overweight and obese population have
determined that intermittent energy restriction is an effective method for achieving weight loss
comparable to that achieved by continuous energy restriction, with weight loss of 3 to 5 kg after
approximately 10 weeks.5 Other methods of intermittent energy restriction, such as alternate-day
modified fasting, have also demonstrated similar weight loss compared with that achieved by
continuous energy restriction.6 For individuals with type 2 diabetes, investigators have evaluated the
effects of intermittent very-low-calorie diets used within a continuous energy restriction diet
compared with continuous energy restriction alone,7-9 but they have not compared intermittent
dieting with continuous dieting. We previously published a pilot trial that demonstrated that a 2-day
intermittent energy restriction diet provides an effective alternative method for both glycemic
control and weight loss compared with a continuous energy restriction diet over a 3-month period.10
The objective of this randomized noninferiority trial was to ascertain the long-term effects of a 2-day
intermittent energy restriction diet compared with continuous energy restriction during a 12-month
period for patients with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesized that equal improvements to hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c) level and weight would occur, as seen in our 3-month pilot trial, thus offering a successful
alternative treatment strategy for use in clinical practice.
Methods
Study Design
This was a parallel randomized clinical trial, conducted at the Sansom Institute of Health Research,
University of South Australia, from April 7, 2015, to September 7, 2017. Reporting in this article is
aligned with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guideline standards, and the full
procedure can be found in Supplement 1. Ethics approval was obtained from the University of South
Australia Human Research Ethics Committee. Procedures were in accordance with ethical standards,
including obtaining written informed consent.
Participants and Randomization
Participants were recruited using flyers posted in public places and via advertisements in print and
broadcast media. Inclusion criteria were adults (�18 years of age) with type 2 diabetes who were
overweight or obese (body mass index �27 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in

 meters squared]) and not pregnant or breastfeeding. Participants reported being otherwise healthy
with blood pressure of less than 160/100 mm Hg and no previous weight loss surgery. There was no
difference in inclusion criteria between this trial and the pilot trial.10 Of the 195 individuals screened
for eligibility, 137 were randomized 1:1 to treatment groups, stratified by sex and body mass index (as
obese or nonobese), at the initial clinic visit. Randomization was completed using an online-
generated random number allocation sequence and was not blinded; participants were allocated to
groups by the study dietitian according to the randomization schedule. Participants received an A$25
(US $19) voucher at 3 and 12 months to thank them for their participation; participants were not
aware that they would receive a voucher.
Interventions
Participants randomized to the intermittent energy restriction group followed a diet of 500 to 600
kcal/d for 2 days of the week and followed their usual diet for the other 5 days. The intermittent diet
days were mostly nonconsecutive, with a minimum of 50 g of protein per day, in accordance with
the very-low-calorie diet guidelines.11 See eTable 1 in Supplement 2 for an example meal plan. The
continuous energy restriction group followed a diet of 1200 to 1500 kcal/d (30% protein, 45%
carbohydrate, and 25% fat).12 The total weekly energy estimate was based on the mean adult intake
of approximately 2100 kcal/d.13 A 75% energy restriction 2 days per week with 5 habitual eating days
per week is approximately 11 500 kcal/wk and a 30% daily energy restriction is approximately 10 300
kcal/wk; therefore, both groups had similar dietary energy restrictions recommended. Both groups
received written dietary information booklets with portion advice and sample menus; no food or
meal replacements were provided. Participants were given digital kitchen scales and encouraged to
weigh foods to ensure accuracy of intake. Appointments were with a dietitian (S.C.) and occurred
every 2 weeks for the first 3 months and every 2 to 3 months for the final 9 months. Blood glucose
control, weight, and diet checklists were reviewed at each visit to assess dietary compliance. The
interventions assessed in this trial were no different from the interventions in the pilot trial.10
Medication Management
The medication management protocol was developed after reviewing the literature14 and consulting
with an endocrinologist (P.M.C.). Management occurred in conjunction with the participant, the
study dietitian, and the endocrinologist, as well as with the participant’
s medical practitioner. The
protocol for a change in medication varied slightly throughout the trial. The initial medication
protocol can be found in eTable 2 in Supplement 2 and was modified, primarily owing to
hypoglycemia, after the 38th participant commenced the trial. The new protocol required the
discontinuation of sulfonylureas and insulin for all participants if the baseline HbA1c level was less
than 7% (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01). If the HbA1c level was
higher than 7% but less than 10%, then sulfonylureas and insulin were discontinued on intermittent
energy restriction days only, and long-acting insulin was discontinued the night before an
intermittent energy restriction day. Medications could be reduced in the continuous energy
restriction diet group depending on dose, at the endocrinologist’
s discretion. If the HbA1c level was
higher than 10%, sulfonylurea medications remained unchanged, but long-acting insulin was
decreased by approximately 10 units on intermittent energy restriction diet days only. Although most
participants followed the protocol, the endocrinologist worked with each participant individually to
ensure the best care. In some cases, participants chose not to follow the protocol or preferred to
work with their own medical practitioner for medication adjustment. See eTables 3 and 4 in
Supplement 2 for detailed information.
Participants were asked to test and record their fasting blood glucose levels daily before
breakfast, with 2 extra readings requested on intermittent energy restriction diet days, including a
reading before bedtime. If the blood glucose level was less than 72 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles
per liter, multiply by 0.0555), participants were asked to contact the study investigators. Medication
changes were then made over the telephone or via email in consultation with the endocrinologist.

 The records of blood glucose levels were reviewed at each clinic visit, and if the levels were higher
than 180 mg/dL, dietary compliance was checked and medication changes were made if necessary.
Medication dosages were recorded daily, and the medication effect score (MES) was used to quantify
changes. The MES is calculated as (actual drug dose/maximum drug dose) × drug mean adjustment
factor.15 A higher MES corresponded to a higher dose of diabetes medication, and a reduction in MES
corresponded to a reduction in diabetes medication. For example, a 0.5-MES change in the dose of
metformin hydrochloride equals a reduction by 1000 mg.
Outcome Measures
All outcome measures were taken at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months. The primary outcome was
change in HbA1c level measured using a DCA (Diabetes Care Analyzer) Vantage Analyzer (Siemens
Healthcare Diagnostics) calibrated every 2 weeks. Disposable lancets were used to obtain the
sample. The secondary outcome was change in body weight measured (barefoot while wearing light
clothing) at each clinic visit on calibrated digital scales in the fasted state (minimum, 8 hours). Body
composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar iDXA, Getz Healthcare) by a
licensed radiation technician. Exploratory outcomes included daily step count, which was monitored
via a waistband pedometer (G-sensor, Pocket Pedometer, Walking With Attitude). Participants were
encouraged to increase their step count by 2000 from baseline in line with the recommendation of
small changes to achieve weight loss.16 Participants attended each clinic visit at similar times after
at least 1 habitual eating day to match the baseline. Blood samples were obtained to measure fasting
glucose and lipid levels, frozen at –80°C, and analyzed at the end of the intervention using Konelab
analysis (Konelab 20XTi, Thermo Electron Corporation) at the University of South Australia.
Statistical Analysis
Sample size was calculated using the standard deviation of the change in HbA1c level from our pilot
data.10 We required a minimum sample size of 104 participants to demonstrate equivalence between
groups: P < .05 with 80% power and a 90% CI boundary of ±0.5%. For weight, a very similar number
was required, using a boundary limit of ±2.5 kg (±1.75 kg for fat mass and ±0.75 kg for fat-free mass).
The predefined margin of equivalence for HbA1c level, weight, fat mass, and fat-free mass was based
on clinical relevance. A 0.5% change in HbA1c level is considered to be a significant clinical change
and is half the expected change achieved by most hypoglycemic drugs.17 All other measures were
exploratory, and we had no hypothesis with regard to equivalence, so only superiority tests were
performed.
Analyses were performed using SPSS, version 21 (IBM SPSS Statistical Software), and data are
shown as mean (standard error of the mean) values unless otherwise stated. A 2-tailed P < .05 was
considered statistically significant. Independent samples t tests and Pearson χ2 tests were used to
analyze differences between groups at baseline. Change over time, differences between treatments,
and time by treatment interactions were assessed on an intention-to-treat basis, including data from
all 137 participants who underwent randomization under a missing-at-random assumption tested
using a linear mixed model and from 97 completers using repeated-measures analysis of variance.
Factors significant in a Pearson correlation were entered into stepwise linear regression to determine
independent factors associated with major outcome measures at 12 months. Graphs were generated
using Microsoft Excel 2010 for Windows (Microsoft Inc), and data were reported as the mean
between-group difference in change, with a 2-sided 90% confidence interval, including the
equivalence margin. The full statistical analysis plan is available in Supplement 1.
Results
Of the 195 participants screened, 137 Australian adults with type 2 diabetes (77 women and 60 men;
mean [SD] age, 61.0 [9.1] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 36.0 [5.8]; and mean [SD] HbA1c level,
7.3% [1.3%]) were randomly assigned to diet groups. Of these 137 participants, 67 were randomized

 to the continuous energy restriction group and 70 were randomized to the intermittent energy
restriction group. Ninety-seven participants (70.8%) completed the study (Figure 1), and the
dropout rates were similar in both groups (21 participants [31.3%] in the continuous energy
restriction group and 19 participants [27.1%] in the intermittent energy restriction group; P = .71).
Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups (Table 1).
From baseline to 12 months, the mean (SEM) HbA1c level was reduced significantly, with no
difference between treatment groups (–0.5% [0.2%] in the continuous energy restriction group vs
–0.3% [0.1%] in the intermittent energy restriction group; P = .65), and the results did not differ
using completers analysis (eTable 5 in Supplement 2). For the primary outcome, the mean between-
group difference in the change in HbA1c level was 0.2% (90% CI, –0.2% to 0.5%) and was contained
within the equivalence margin of ±0.5%, confirming equivalence (Figure 2). There was an increase in
the mean (SEM) HbA1c level in both groups between 3 and 12 months (0.3% [0.1%]), with an overall
decrease of 0.4% (0.1%) (P < .001) at 12 months. In stepwise linear regression, the baseline HbA1c
level accounted for 35% and the change in visceral adipose tissue accounted for 17% of the variance
in the change in HbA1c level at 12 months (adjusted r2 = 0.5; P < .001), with no effect of treatment
group. Participants with a baseline HbA1c level higher than 8% had the greatest mean (SEM) change
(–1.4% [0.2%]; P < .001), and participants with a baseline HbA1c level of less than 6% had almost no
change (–0.03% [0.05%]; P = .50) at 12 months.
The total mean (SEM) MES decreased significantly by time (–0.5 [0.1]; P < .001), was similar in
both groups (–0.3 [0.1] in the continuous energy restriction group vs –0.6 [0.1] in the intermittent
energy restriction group; P = .11), and was correlated with weight change at 12 months (r = 0.3;
P = .009). The mean (SEM) MES for oral hypoglycemic agents decreased significantly by time (–0.3
[0.1]; P < .001) and was similar in both groups (–0.2 [0.1] in the continuous energy restriction group
vs –0.3 [0.1] in the intermittent energy restriction group; P = .45), but, for insulin, the decrease was
significantly greater in the intermittent energy restriction group owing to the extra insulin reduction
required on intermittent diet days (–0.3 [0.1] in the continuous energy restriction group vs –1.2 [0.2]
in the intermittent energy restriction group; P = .006). Most of the changes to medications were
made before 3 months, with small changes between 3 and 12 months (total mean [SEM] MES, –0.1

group; P = .28). Thirty-five percent of participants (16 of 46) using sulfonylureas and/or insulin
experienced glycemic events (the mean [SEM] number of events was 3.2 [0.7] in the continuous
energy restriction group and 4.9 [1.4] in the intermittent energy restriction group; P = .28) in the first
2 weeks of treatment. Eight of 46 participants (17%) (2 in the continuous energy restriction group
and 6 in the intermittent energy restriction group) experienced hypoglycemia (mean [SEM] number
of events, 2.4 [0.6]) with no differences between groups (the mean [SEM] number of events was
2.0 [1.0] in the continuous energy restriction group vs 2.5 [0.8] in the intermittent energy restriction
group; P = .74). All participants who experienced hypoglycemic events either reported events before
starting treatment or were unsure. One participant in the intermittent energy restriction group who
experienced hypoglycemia during the first 2 weeks of treatment did not lose weight during this time.
Hyperglycemia occurred in 10 of 46 participants (22%; 3 in the continuous energy restriction group
and 7 in the intermittent energy restriction group) in the first 2 weeks (mean [SEM] number of
events, 5.1 [1.4]), with no difference between groups (the mean [SEM] number of events was 4.0
[0.6] in the continuous energy restriction group vs 5.6 [2.0] in the intermittent energy restriction
group; P = .47). Three participants did not lose weight during this period (1 in the continuous energy
restriction group and 2 in the intermittent energy restriction group). Four participants chose not to
follow the protocol or chose to follow their own medical practitioner’
s advice (eTables 3 and 4 in
Supplement 2).
The analysis of the secondary outcome showed that the mean [SEM] weight reduction was
significant over time but not by treatment (–5.0 [0.8] kg in the continuous energy restriction group
vs –6.8 [0.8] kg in the intermittent energy restriction group; P = .25), and the results did not differ
using completer analysis (eTable 5 in Supplement). The mean between-group difference in weight
change was –1.8 kg (90% CI, –3.7 to 0.07 kg), which is outside the prespecified boundary of ±2.5 kg,
so statistical equivalence has not been shown (Figure 2). Twenty percent of participants (19 of 97)
lost 5% to 10% of their body weight, and 22% (21 of 97) lost more than 10% of their body weight,
with no difference between groups. Both groups lost significant weight between baseline and 3
months, which was maintained at 12 months (mean [SEM] weight reduction from 3 to 12 months was
0.4 [0.5] kg in the continuous energy restriction group and –0.2 [0.6] kg in the intermittent energy
restriction group; P = .48). Weight change at 2 weeks was associated with weight loss at 12 months
(r = 0.6; P < .001). A small subgroup of participants (21 in both groups) continued to lose weight
during the 12 months of the study (mean [SEM] weight reduction was –8.4 [1.2] kg in the continuous
energy restriction group and –12.5 [1.8] kg in the intermittent energy restriction group; P = .07), and

 these participants maintained the lower HbA1c level seen at 3 to 12 months (mean [SEM] level, 0.6%
[0.2%]; P < .001) with no difference by treatment. Participants who attended all scheduled visits
lost significantly more weight than did participants who did not (mean [SEM], –7.6 [0.9] kg vs –4.0
[1.1] kg; P = .01), with a trend toward a greater change in HbA1c level (mean [SEM] level, –0.5% [0.1%]
vs –0.2% [0.1%]; P = .09). In stepwise linear regression, change in step count at 3 months accounted
for 9%, and the baseline step count accounted for 5% of the change in weight at 12 months (adjusted
r2 = 0.1; P < .001), with no effect of treatment group. All measures of body composition decreased
significantly over time, with no difference between groups (Table 2). The mean between-group
differences in change were –1.3 kg (90% CI, –2.8 to 0.2 kg) for fat mass and –0.5 kg (90% CI, –1.4 to
0.4 kg) for fat-free mass, which are outside the prespecified boundaries of ±1.75 kg for fat mass and
±0.75 kg for fat-free mass, so statistical equivalence has not been shown (Figure 2). The total loss of
fat-free mass was significantly greater in the intermittent energy restriction group using completers
analysis (eTable 5 in Supplement 2) but did not differ between groups when expressed as a mean
(SEM) percentage of weight lost (31% [8.5%] in the continuous energy restriction group and 37%
[9.6%] in the intermittent energy restriction group; P = .61).
The exploratory outcomes of mean (SEM) fasting glucose (–18.1 [4.6] mg/dL) and serum lipid
levels (total cholesterol level, –13.0 [3.9] mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0259]; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, –11.1 [3.3] mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter,
multiply by 0.0259]; triglycerides level, –16.0 [8.5] mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply
by 0.0113]; and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, –1.4 [1.5] mg/dL [to convert to millimoles
per liter, multiply by 0.0259]) improved with weight loss (P < .001), with no differences between
groups. The increase in mean (SEM) steps per day was significantly greater in the continuous energy
restriction group than the intermittent energy restriction group at 12 months (1183 [516] steps vs
524 [483] steps; P = .02), but the total step count was still similar in both groups (7071 [529] steps in
the continuous energy restriction group vs 7312 [496] steps in the intermittent energy restriction
group; P = .52). Effects did not differ using completers analysis.

Effect of Intermittent vs Continuous Energy Restricted Diet on Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes

 Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized clinical trial of this duration comparing intermittent
energy restriction with continuous energy restriction in patients with type 2 diabetes. The results
demonstrated that a 2-day intermittent energy restriction diet is comparable to a continuous energy
restriction diet for improvements in glycemic control, confirming our pilot data.10 Equivalence was
demonstrated for change in HbA1c level; however, given the large variability in weight reduction,
equivalence could not be demonstrated for weight loss or changes in body composition. Intermittent
energy restriction may be superior to continuous energy restriction for weight reduction, although
a sample population of more than 300 participants would be required to demonstrate superiority
with 80% power.
The major factor associated with change in HbA1c level was baseline HbA1c level, and because
participants had relatively well-controlled type 2 diabetes, our capacity to see a large change was
limited. It has been well demonstrated that the magnitude of the effect of an intervention on
glycemic control depends on baseline HbA1c level.18 The change in HbA1c level in our trial is
comparable to the change seen in trials with similar baseline HbA1c level, such as the Look AHEAD
(Action for Health in Diabetes) study.19 Long duration of diabetes was associated with a higher
baseline HbA1c level, which resulted in a greater reduction in HbA1c level. Relative weight
maintenance from 3 to 12 months probably contributed to the loss of effect on HbA1c level during this
period because participants who continued to lose weight maintained improved HbA1c levels. The
slight but nonsignificant difference in change in HbA1c level between groups may be because the 5
days of nonrestricted habitual eating for those in the intermittent energy restriction group had no
specific emphasis on improved dietary choices as were provided to those in the continuous energy
restriction group.
Intermittent energy restriction is safe for people who have either diet-controlled type 2
diabetes or are using medication that is not likely to cause hypoglycemia. For people using
sulfonylureas and/or insulin, intermittent energy restriction requires medication changes and regular
monitoring, especially in the initial stages. Patients need to be able to contact their medical
practitioner for further medication changes if they experience a hypoglycemic event. In our trial,
hypoglycemic events occurred only in participants who reported experiencing hypoglycemia before
starting treatment or who were uncertain.
In this pragmatic trial, every effort was made to try and replicate the real-world environment;
therefore, no meal replacements or foods were provided. Considering this fact, acceptability of the
energy restriction plans was very high, with only 2 participants from the intermittent energy
restriction group withdrawing owing to headaches brought on by hunger. Overall compliance to both
diets was excellent during the first 3 months of treatment (90% in the continuous energy restriction
group and 97% in the intermittent energy restriction group; P = .21), after which the compliance
rates decreased in both groups (49% in the continuous energy restriction group and 44% in the
intermittent energy restriction group; P = .62). Anecdotally, participants in the intermittent energy
restriction group reported that although they were not following the protocol consistently after 3
months, they found that they could use it effectively to prevent weight gain because the energy
restriction involved only 2 days. Intermittent dieting has been shown to improve the efficiency of
weight loss compared with continuous dieting,20 although we did not find this result in the present
study. The continuous energy restriction group found weight loss maintenance more difficult
because, if they were not following the diet on a daily basis, they would regain weight owing to
increased energy intake. Weight loss was greater in a subgroup of participants who attended all
scheduled clinic visits with the study dietitian compared with participants who missed sessions. The
benefits of behavioral support,21 specifically support provided by a dietitian,22 as well as the effects
of lifestyle interventions,23 are noted in the literature. There was a significant difference in loss of
total fat-free mass, which was greater in the intermittent energy restriction group for completers.
This difference did not occur in our pilot trial, nor is it seen in the literature on intermittent energy

 restriction in overweight and obese individuals.5,10 We do not believe that this finding is clinically
relevant, considering the greater weight loss in the intermittent energy restriction group at 12
months (approximately 2 kg) and because the total fat-free mass percentage change did not differ
between groups.
Limitations
This study has some limitations. First, as indicated, this population had well-controlled type 2
diabetes, which limits generalizability. Second, we acknowledge that medication adjustments can
cause problems with interpreting changes in HbA1c level. Changes to medications were similar
between groups, except for reductions in insulin, which were greater in the intermittent energy
restriction group and may have limited changes in HbA1c level. Third, participants had more contact
time with the dietitian than is usual in the clinical setting, especially in the first 3 months, which may
have affected the results. Finally, only finger-prick testing was used to monitor blood glucose levels,
and it is likely that hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic events went undetected.24 Future research
should use continuous blood glucose monitoring systems for more accurate results.
Conclusions
Intermittent energy restriction is an effective alternative diet strategy for the reduction of HbA1c level
comparable to continuous energy restriction in patients with type 2 diabetes, and it may be superior
to continuous energy restriction for weight reduction. Intermittent energy restriction is acceptable
for most patients with type 2 diabetes, and safety can be ensured for patients who are not using
glycemic agents likely to cause hypoglycemia. For patients using sulfonylureas and/or insulin, regular
monitoring is paramount. The relative maintenance of results between the 3- and 12-month periods
may reflect the importance of support for behavioral change, which was provided more frequently in
the first 3 months of treatment and resulted in greater change if participants attended all
appointments.
