Nerves closely associate with blood vessels and help to pattern the vasculature during
development. Recent work suggests that newly formed nerve fibers may regulate the tumor
microenvironment, but their exact functions are unclear. Studying mouse models of prostate
cancer, we show that endothelial b-adrenergic receptor signaling via adrenergic nerve–derived
noradrenaline in the prostate stroma is critical for activation of an angiogenic switch that
fuels exponential tumor growth. Mechanistically, this occurs through alteration of endothelial
cell metabolism. Endothelial cells typically rely on aerobic glycolysis for angiogenesis.We found
that the loss of endothelial Adrb2, the gene encoding the b2-adrenergic receptor, leads to
inhibition of angiogenesis through enhancement of endothelial oxidative phosphorylation.
Codeletion of Adrb2 and Cox10, a gene encoding a cytochrome IV oxidase assembly factor,
prevented the metabolic shift induced by Adrb2 deletion and rescued prostate cancer
progression.This cross-talk between nerves and endothelial metabolism could potentially be
targeted as an anticancer therapy.
S
olid tumors depend on angiogenesis to
sustain their growth (1). The transition
from hyperplasia to highly vascularized
growing tumor, referred to as the “angio-
genic switch,” is a state in which proangio-
genic factors—such as vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) and other secreted angiocrine
factors—predominate over antiangiogenic signals
(2). During development, peripheral nerves as-
sociate closely with growing blood vessels, orga-
nizing vascular pattern (3, 4), a phenomenon
that has also been described in models of wound
healing (5, 6). Emerging studies suggest that
nerves can also regulate tumorigenesis (7–11).
Sympathetic nerve fibers deliver adrenergic sig-
nals that act via b-adrenergic receptors (bAdRs)
expressed in the tumor microenvironment. How-
ever, the cellular target(s) and molecular mech-
anism(s) responsible for neural regulation of
cancer are not known and may provide novel
therapeutic avenues.
Adrenergic nerves regulate angiogenesis
in early tumor growth
To investigate the interplay between adrenergic
nerves and early-stage tumor growth, we orthotopi-
cally implanted prostate cancer xenografts in
immunodeficient Balb/c (nu/nu) mice. Xeno-
grafts exhibited exponential growth kinetics
from ~18 days postimplantation (bAdRWT) (Fig.
1A). By contrast, no substantial tumor growth oc-
curred in nu/nu mice that were also genetically
deficient in both b2-adrenergic (Adrb2) and b3-
adrenergic (Adrb3) receptors (bAdRKO) (9). Path-
ological examination of prostate tissues revealed
that tumors formed in bAdRKO recipients (Fig. 1A
and fig. S1A) but their growth was arrested at
day 18 (Fig. 1B), suggesting that bAdR signaling
plays a key role in the molecular “switch” en-
abling exponential tumor growth. Before the
switch, day-18 tumors from both control and
bAdRKO recipients showed no difference in size,
vascular permeability, or hypoxic area (fig. S1,
A to C). We next investigated the vascular den-
sity and tumor vasculature patterns by semi-
automated analysis using Simple Neurite Tracer
(12) in whole cross-sectional montages of day-18
tumors. These analyses revealed reductions in
the density of tumor vessels (Fig. 1, C and D)
due to significant alterations in the vascular
patterns (reduced length and branching) in pro-
states of bAdRKO mice compared with bAdRWT
controls (Fig. 1D). This observation suggests that
the loss of adrenergic signaling in the tumor
microenvironment may regulate angiogenesis.
To confirm these results in an independent
assay, we orthotopically transplanted a cell-free
type I collagen matrix into the prostate capsule
of nu/nu mice, between the ventral prostate lobes.
Because type I collagen is an angiogenic super-
polymer (13) and mimics the changes in com-
position of the reactive extracellular matrix seen
in prostate cancer (14, 15), it promotes angio-
genesis without the need to administer exogenous
cytokines. We assessed recruitment of host vas-
culature into the matrix in control immuno-
competent C57BL/6 mice and in mice chemically
sympathectomized with 6-hydroxydopamine
(6OHDA) (9). Analyses of vascular patterning
revealed significant reductions in vessel migra-
tion, density, and branching in the denervated
prostate matrices, as compared with controls
(Fig. 1E). These data indicate that the vascula-
ture serves as a stromal target for adrenergic
nerves and that adrenergic signals modulate
angiogenesis (7).
Endothelial ADRB2 controls
the angiogenic switch
The angiogenic switch described above charac-
terizes the progression of prostate cancer from
the low-grade preneoplastic stage [low-grade pros-
tatic intraepithelial neoplasia (LPIN)] (fig. S2,
B and C) to the high-grade malignant stage [high-
grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HPIN)]
(Fig. 2A) (16). To explore the role of adrenergic
signals in mediating angiogenesis in prostate
cancer progression, we used the Hi-Myc (cMyc)
spontaneous autochthonous prostate cancer
mouse model. In these mice, the human MYC
gene, driven by the probasin promoter, is over-
expressed in the prostate; this leads to LPIN at
4 weeks, which progresses to HPIN by 8 weeks,
followed by adenocarcinoma and finally invasive
cancer by 24 weeks (9, 17). This model recapit-
ulates the histological changes seen in human
disease (18, 19). Immunofluorescence analyses
of adrenergic nerves (tyrosine hydroxylase+) and
vessels (CD31+) showed an increase in both nerve
and vessel densities in the HPIN stage (Fig. 2A,
and fig. S2A) but not in the preangiogenic
LPIN stage (fig. S2, B and C). In addition, PIN
progression coincided with an increased physical
association of nerves and blood vessels (reduced
proximity score; Fig. 2A). The levels of the b-
adrenergic neurotransmitter noradrenaline were
significantly elevated in HPIN prostates, whereas
the levels of other catecholamines were un-
changed (Fig. 2B). Analyses of Adrb2 expression
in prostate stromal populations implicated in
tumor angiogenesis (20) revealed that Adrb2
expression levels were highest in endothelial
cells (fig. S3A).
To assess the specific contributions of Adrb2 in
stromal cells to cancer progression in the cMyc
model, we conditionally deleted Adrb2 by inter-
crossing Adrb2fl/fl (21) with Cre-expressing lines
to delete the gene in myeloid cells [Csf1riCre (22)],
pericytes [NG2CreERTM (23)], or endothelial cells
[Cdh5-CreERT2 (24)]. Deletion of Adrb2 in the tar-
geted cells occurred at high efficiency (fig. S3, B
to D). Deletion of Adrb2 in pericytes during the
LPIN stage did not result in a significant differ-
ence in prostate cancer weight in the HPIN stage
or at the late adenocarcinoma stage (12 months
of age), and no phenotype was also observed
when Adrb2 was deleted in myeloid cells (fig. S3,
C and D). By contrast, deletion of Adrb2 in

 endothelial cells during the LPIN stage reduced
progression to the HPIN stage (Fig. 2, C and D),
and the inhibition of disease progression was sus-
tained for more than 12 months (Fig. 2C). Histo-
logical analysis of cMyc Adrb2fl/fl Cdh5-CreERT2
mice (endothelial cell conditional knockout mice,
henceforth referred to as cMyc; Adrb2ecKO) re-
vealed a significant reduction in Ki-67+ prolifer-
ative prostate epithelial cells (fig. S4A), which we
confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis (fig. S4B). The proliferation of
prostate epithelial cells was reduced to levels
seen at the LPIN stage before the angiogenic
switch (fig. S2D), but without a significant change
in epithelial apoptosis (fig. S4C). Thus, endothelial
cells are the major stromal target of adrenergic
nerves in the tumor microenvironment.
To evaluate the angiogenic switch during the
transition from the LPIN to HPIN stage in pros-
tate cancer progression (16), we induced endo-
thelial Adrb2 deletion in the cMyc model by
administering tamoxifen to the mice at 4 weeks
of age (LPIN stage). We then assessed angio-
genesis and vascular patterning at 8 weeks (HPIN
stage). Consistent with our results in the xenograft
and denervation models (Fig. 1, D and E), we
found that cMyc; Adrb2ecKO mice exhibited a
significant reduction in vessel density, migration,
and branching 4 weeks after Adrb2 gene dele-
tion, as compared with cMyc controls (Fig. 2E
and figs. S4D and S5, A and B). There was no
significant change in pericyte coverage, vascular
leakage, or tissue hypoxia (fig. S4, E to G). These
data collectively suggest that adrenergic signals
mediate an early angiogenic progression switch
via endothelial Adrb2.
ADRB2 regulates oxidative metabolism
in angiogenic prostate endothelial cells
To explore the molecular mechanisms under-
lying the angiogenic defect in cMyc; Adrb2ecKO
mice, we compared the transcriptome of endo-
thelial cells isolated by FACS from cMyc; Adrb2ecKO
and cMyc prostates (Fig. 3A and fig. S6A). Gene
set enrichment analysis revealed a highly sig-
nificant increase in mitochondrial cytochrome c
activity (fig. S6B). Among differentially expressed
mitochondria-associated genes involved in metab-
olism, branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase
alpha peptide (Bckdha; involved in metabolizing
branched-chain amino acids in the tricarboxylic
acid cycle) and cytochrome c oxidase assembly
factor 6 (Coa6; involved in the electron-transport
chain) stood out by hierarchical cluster analysis
(fig. S6C). Increased mRNA expression of both
genes was validated by quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (fig. S6D). Consistent
with our observation that Adrb2 deletion in endo-
thelial cells at the LPIN stage sustained inhibition
of cancer progression 48 weeks after Cre-mediated
recombination (Fig. 2C), we observed that Coa6
expression remained elevated in cMyc; Adrb2ecKO
endothelial cells at that time point (fig. S6E). In
addition, analysis of peritumoral and intratumoral
endothelial cells isolated from the bAdRKO ortho-
topic tumor model revealed increased expression
of these mitochondrial genes (fig. S7, A and B).
The effect of bAdR signals on genes involved in
oxidative phosphorylation and vascular branching
is reminiscent of recent studies showing that
inhibition of glycolysis in endothelial cells alters
angiogenesis during the development of retinal
and hindbrain vessels (25, 26).
To investigate the link between nerve-derived
adrenergic signals and endothelial metabo-
lism, we evaluated the change in endothelial
mitochondrial membrane potential (Dy), which

 is associated with the accumulation of positively
charged hydrogen ions in the mitochondrial in-
termembrane space during oxidative phospho-
rylation. We assessed Dy in freshly isolated
prostate endothelial cells by tetramethylrhod-
amine ethyl ester (TMRE) and quantified the
quotient of basal-to-maximal nictotinamide ade-
nine dinucleotide (reduced form, NADH) levels
by autofluorescence, both measures of oxidative
phosphorylation (27–29). We found that after
progression to the HPIN stage, endothelial cell
Dy was reduced and the NADH quotient was
increased without significant change in mito-
chondrial mass (fig. S8, A to D). Consistent with
the notion that prostate endothelial cells operate
at maximal respiratory capacity (RC), HPIN and
wild-type (WT) prostate-derived endothelial cells
did not exhibit spare RC, whereas significant
spare RC was apparent in hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells isolated from the same
animals (fig. S8E) (29). However, TMRE was sig-
nificantly increased and NADH quotient reduced
in freshly isolated endothelial cells from cMyc;
Adrb2ecKO mice (Fig. 3B and fig. S9A), consistent
with enhanced oxidative phosphorylation. This
was not due to a change in mitochondrial mass
(fig. S9A) or to an effect on endothelial viability
(fig. S9, B and C). In addition, we observed a
similar increase in endothelial oxidative phos-
phorylation in orthotopic tumors in bAdRKO re-
cipients, as well as in WT mice subjected to
adrenergic denervation (figs. S10, A and B, and
S11, A and B). Endothelial glucose uptake was
increased in the absence of Adrb2 (Fig. 3C).
These results strongly suggest that the loss of
bAdR signaling enhances oxidative phospho-
rylation in endothelial cells.
To evaluate the role of bAdR in endothelial
glucose metabolism, the main fuel source of endo-
thelial cells (25, 30), we knocked down Adrb2
expression by lentiviral transduction of short
hairpin RNA (shAdrb2) in primary mouse pros-
tate endothelial cells that express the adeno-
viral E4ORF1 gene; the latter gene allows the
cells to survive in culture while maintaining
their growth dependence on VEGF and fibro-
blast growth factor (31). shAdrb2 specifically in-
hibited Adrb2 expression by 80% compared with
control vector (shCntrl), without affecting endo-
thelial cell viability or proliferation (fig. S12, A
and B). In the presence of physiological levels
of noradrenaline, shAdrb2 endothelial cells ex-
hibited a marked increase in oxidative aerobic
metabolism compared with shCntrl endothelial
cells, as demonstrated by an increase in oxygen
consumption (Fig. 3D). Like freshly isolated endo-
thelial cells from cMyc; Adrb2ecKO or bAdRKO
mice, endothelial cells treated with shAdrb2
showed an elevation in oxidative phosphoryl-
ation activity (increased Dy and decreased NADH
quotient), as well as an increase in glucose uptake,
but no change in mitochondrial mass (fig. S13, A
to C). Thus, this endothelial culture system re-
capitulates the metabolic profile of native pros-
tate endothelial cells.
To explore the shift in endothelial metabolism
that accompanies the loss of ADRB2 signaling,
we assessed glucose uptake and the contributions
of glucose-derived carbons to the tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle, an integral process that fuels
oxidative phosphorylation. We observed increased
glucose uptake in cMyc; Adrb2ecKO-isolated endo-
thelial cells compared with controls (Fig. 3C). We
then traced the fate of uniformly labeled [U-13C]-
glucose in shCntrl and shAdrb2 endothelial cells
cultured in the presence of noradrenaline. These
experiments revealed a 1.9-fold increase in citrate
levels in shAdrb2 compared with shCntrl endo-
thelial cells (Fig. 3E), whereas lactate levels were
unchanged (fig. S13D). Furthermore, shAdrb2 cells
incorporated considerably more glucose-derived
carbons into citrate than shCntrl cells (Fig. 3, F
and G). Examination of isotopologue distribution

Downloaded from 
 of glucose-derived citrate revealed an enrichment
of m+2 isotopologue in shAdrb2 compared with
shCntrl cells, reflective of pyruvate dehydrogenase–
driven contribution of glucose-derived carbons
into the TCA cycle (Fig. 3H). However, shAdrb2
endothelial cells were relatively depleted in the
m+3 isotopologue, which may reflect a reduction
in anaplerotic flux through pyruvate carboxylase
(fig. S14A).
Because glutamine has been reported to be a
major anaplerotic substrate in proliferating cells
(32), we performed glutamine tracing experiments
using uniformly labeled [U-13C]-glutamine. We
observed significant elevations in glutamine oxi-
dation, as represented by an increase in labeled
citrate levels and in the m+4 isotopologue in TCA
cycle intermediates (fig. S14, B to D, and table S1).
Consistent with the notion that accumulation of
citrate may provide acetyl–coenzyme A for fatty
acid synthesis (33), we also observed higher abun-
dance of fatty acyl carnitines in shAdrb2 com-
pared with control endothelial cells (fig. S14E).
Furthermore, we found that adenosine tri-
phosphate (ATP) levels were significantly elevated
in shAdrb2 endothelial cells (Fig. 3I).
To dissect the relative contributions of glycol-
ysis versus oxidative phosphorylation to ATP gen-
eration, we replaced glucose in the media with
galactose (which forces cells to rely on oxidative
phosphorylation for ATP production). This led to
a substantial reduction in ATP levels in shCntrl
cells, whereas no change in ATP levels was ob-
served in shAdrb2 cells (fig. S15A). Inhibition
of oxidative phosphorylation with antimycin A
also reduced ATP levels to those seen in control
cells (Fig. 3I), further indicating that depletion
of ADRB2 shifts endothelial metabolism to oxi-
dative phosphorylation. Taken together, the re-
sults obtained with multiple model systems and
analytical methods show that the loss of bAdR
signaling alters endothelial metabolism, enhanc-
ing oxidative phosphorylation.
Increased endothelial COA6 activity
mediates the shift toward oxidative
phosphorylation
To obtain further insight into the mechanism
linking adrenergic signaling, altered metabolism,
and endothelial cell function, we assessed the mi-
gration of Adrb2-sufficient (shCntrl) and Adrb2-
deficient (shAdrb2) endothelial cells in an in vitro
wound assay. We found that migration of shAdrb2
cells was markedly inhibited compared with that
of shCntrl cells (fig. S16, A to C). Staining for a-
tubulin revealed altered microtubule directional
orientation in the shAdrb2 cells (fig. S16D). Endo-
thelial cells require polarization of their micro-
tubule cytoskeleton for directional migration (34),
and microtubule organization regulates ATP-
intensive actin cytoskeletal organization (35),
which suggests that elevated ATP levels from
oxidative metabolism may inhibit endothelial
angiogenic function by altering cytoskeletal ac-
tivity. In line with our transcriptome analysis
(fig. S6, C and D), shAdrb2 increased Coa6 mRNA
and protein levels (fig. S15, B and C) but did not
alter Bckdha expression, indicating that changes
in Coa6 expression may drive the observed meta-
bolic alterations. Cyclic adenosine monophos-
phate, the second messenger generated by
adenylyl cyclase (AC) upon bAdR signaling, was
undetectable after noradrenaline stimulation in
shAdrb2 cells but was present at high levels in
control endothelial cells (fig. S15D). AC inhibition
up-regulated Coa6 expression in control cells, and
conversely, AC stimulation with forskolin re-
pressedCoa6inshAdrb2 endothelialcells(fig.S15E).
These data indicate that ADRB2 signaling in
endothelial cells regulates Coa6 expression.

 and inhibit the angiogenic switch in prostate
cancer, we overexpressed Coa6 or Bckdha by
lentiviral transduction in culture-expanded pros-
tate endothelial cells. Whereas Bckdha did not
induce a significant change in oxidative phos-
phorylation, Coa6 overexpression (Coa6-GFP)
(fig. S17A) substantially augmented endothelial
oxidative metabolism (Fig. 4A and fig. S17B). In
addition, Coa6–green fluorescent protein (GFP)
significantly inhibited endothelial cell migration
and proliferation but did not affect endothelial
cell viability (fig. S17, C and D). To assess the
effect of increased oxidative phosphorylation on
angiogenesis in vivo, we orthotopically cotrans-
planted Coa6-GFP endothelial cells with human
PC-3 prostate cancer cells into nu/nu males. In
the prostate tumors, GFP+ vessel quantification
revealed a marked reduction in angiogenesis
and tip cell formation in Coa6-GFP xenografts
compared with xenografts produced by cotrans-
plantation of PC-3 cells with Cntrl-GFP endo-
thelial cells (Fig. 4, B and C). These results suggest
that the loss of adrenergic signaling by Adrb2
deletion increases Coa6 expression, which causes
an increase in oxidative phosphorylation, and
that this metabolic shift inhibits angiogenesis.
To assemble cytochrome c oxidase (also known
as complex IV), the terminal enzyme in oxidative
phosphorylation that transfers electrons to mo-
lecular oxygen, COA6 cooperates with several
factors, including the protein product of Cox10
[heme A:farnesyltransferase cytochrome c oxi-
dase assembly factor (36)]. Because conditional
Cox10 deletion has been shown to reduce oxida-
tive phosphorylation in vivo in skeletal muscle (37),
we interbred the Cox10fl/fl and cMyc; Adrb2fl/fl;
Cdh5-CreERT2 mouse strains (referred to as cMyc;
Adrb2ecKO; Cox10ecKO). We found that conditional
Cox10 deletion in cMyc; Adrb2ecKO; Cox10ecKO pre-
vented the metabolic switch to oxidative phos-
phorylation in endothelial cells induced by Adrb2
deletion (Fig. 4D and fig. S18, A to C). Additionally,
Cox10 deletion rescued vascular perfusion of the
prostate (fig. S19A), angiogenesis (Fig. 4E and fig.
S19, B and C), and PIN cancer progression (Fig. 4F
and figs. S18, D and E, and S20, A to C), without
affecting endothelial proliferation or viability
(fig. S20, D and E). Thus, the shift to endothelial
oxidative metabolism is sufficient to inhibit the
PIN-stage progression switch.
Discussion
Our results elucidate a critical link between neu-
ral signals in the tumor microenvironment and
angiogenesis, wherein inhibition of adrenergic
nerve activity alters endothelial metabolism to
prevent the angiogenic switch that supports ag-
gressive prostate cancer. The loss of bAdR sig-
naling increases oxidative phosphorylation in
endothelial cells via increased expression of the
mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase assembly
factor COA6, inhibiting angiogenesis.
Endothelial cell metabolism represents an
emerging targetable pathway for the treatment
of vascular diseases (38). For example, activation
of oxidative phosphorylation in renal endothe-
lium protects against postischemic reperfusion
injury in the kidneys (39), and inhibition of en-
dothelial cell glycolysis prevents pathologic angio-
genesis in ophthalmologic diseases (40). Our results
suggest that endothelial cell metabolism can be
locally regulated by nerves.
Nerves and vessels are tightly associated dur-
ing development, sharing patterning cues (41).
As tumors need to redevelop a vascular network
to ensure nutrition and communication, neural
input may provide a critical set of signals that
coordinate cancer progression (9). Our results
suggest that adrenergic signals promote the
angiogenic switch in prostate cancer and that
their inhibition (e.g., using b-blockers) could pre-
vent or delay the dominance of proangiogenic
factors that allow tumor progression.
Therapies attempting to starve the tumor by
inhibiting angiogenesis have had limited long-
term therapeutic benefit in various cancers, in-
cluding that of the prostate (42), most likely due
to resistance mechanisms (43). Cotargeting angio-
genesis with neural signals and/or endothelial cell
