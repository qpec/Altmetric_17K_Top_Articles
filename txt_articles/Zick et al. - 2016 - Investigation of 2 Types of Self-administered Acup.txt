IMPORTANCE Fatigue is a common and debilitating late-term effect of breast cancer that is
associated with poor sleep and decreased quality of life, yet therapies remain limited.
Acupressure has reduced fatigue in previous small studies, but rigorous clinical trials are
needed.
OBJECTIVES To investigate if 6 weeks of 2 types of self-administered acupressure improved
fatigue, sleep, and quality of life vs usual care in breast cancer survivors and to determine if
changes were sustained during a 4-week washout period.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Phase 3 randomized, single-blind, clinical trial
conducted from March 1, 2011, through October 31, 2014. Women were recruited from the
Michigan Tumor Registry.
INTERVENTIONS Randomization (1:1:1) to 6 weeks of daily self-administered relaxing
acupressure, stimulating acupressure, or usual care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was change in the Brief Fatigue
Inventory score from baseline to weeks 6 and 10. Secondary analyses were sleep (Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index) and quality of life (Long-Term Quality of Life Instrument).
RESULTS A total of 424 survivors of stages 0 to III breast cancer who had completed cancer
treatments at least 12 months previously were screened, and 288 were randomized, with
270 receiving relaxing acupressure (n = 94), stimulating acupressure (n = 90), or usual
care (n = 86). One woman withdrew owing to bruising at the acupoints. At week 6, the
percentages of participants who achieved normal fatigue levels (Brief Fatigue Inventory
score <4) were 66.2% (49 of 74) in relaxing acupressure, 60.9% (42 of 70) in stimulating
acupressure, and 31.3% (26 of 84) in usual care. At week 10, a total of 56.3% (40 of 71) in
relaxing acupressure, 60.9% (42 of 69) in stimulating acupressure, and 30.1% (25 of 83) in
usual care continued to have normal fatigue. At neither time point were the 2 acupressure
groups significantly different. Relaxing acupressure, but not stimulating acupressure, showed
significant improvements in sleep quality compared with usual care at week 6, but not at
week 10. Only relaxing acupressure significantly improved quality of life vs usual care at
weeks 6 and 10.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Both acupressure arms significantly reduced persistent
fatigue compared with usual care, but only relaxing acupressure had significant effects on
sleep quality and quality of life. Relaxing acupressure offers a possible low-cost option for
managing symptoms.

any breast cancer survivors experience negative late-
termphysicalandpsychologicaleffectsfromtheircan-
cer therapies.1,2 Persistent fatigue is one of the most
commonandbothersomesymptoms.3,4Moreover,persistentfa-
tigue in breast cancer survivors is emerging as a potential inde-
pendent risk factor associated with shorter times to breast can-
cerrecurrenceandoverallsurvival.5Approximatelyone-thirdof
women experience moderate to severe persistent fatigue up to
10 years after the end of treatment.6-8 Persistent fatigue is asso-
ciated with higher rates of depression,9-11 poor sleep,12 and de-
creased quality of life.13 While the etiology of persistent fatigue
isunknown,recentdatasuggestdysfunctionwithinthecentral

ters and metabolites.14,15
Despitethehighburdenofpersistentfatigueinbreastcancer
survivors, treatments remain limited and have challenges to
implementation.16Forinstance,cancer-relatedfatigueisoneof

bythepooravailabilityofmentalhealthprograms,limitedinsur-
ance coverage, and the stigma associated with psychological
problems.19-22 Therefore, there is a need for inexpensive, easy-
to-initiate, self-care treatments for persistent fatigue in breast
cancer survivors.
Acupressure, a method derived from traditional Chinese
medicine(TCM),isatreatmentinwhichpressureisappliedwith
fingers, thumbs, or a device to acupoints on the body. Acupres-
sure has shown promise for treating fatigue in patients with
cancer,23 andinastudy24 of43cancersurvivorswithpersistent

approximately 45% to 70%. Furthermore, acupressure points

nificantlybetteratimprovingfatiguethananotherdistinctsetof

examined the effect of acupressure for cancer fatigue.
Todevelopaninexpensive,easy-to-initiate,self-caretreat-
ment for persistent fatigue, we conducted a 10-week phase 3
randomized, single-blind, clinical trial from March 1, 2011,
through October 31, 2014, to test the hypothesis that self-
administered relaxing acupressure would be significantly bet-
ter at reducing fatigue, improving sleep, and increasing qual-
ity of life than either stimulating acupressure or usual care in
persistentlyfatiguedbreastcancersurvivors.Wealsoexamined
the carryover effects on fatigue, sleep, and quality of life
during a 4-week washout period.
Methods
The study design has been previously reported.29 The trial
protocol (Supplement 1) was approved by the University of
Michigan Medical School, Michigan State University, and
Michigan Department of Public Health institutional review
boards, and participants provided written informed consent.
Trial Design
A 10-week randomized, single-blind trial comparing self-
administeredrelaxingacupressurewithstimulatingacupressure
oncedailyfor6weeksvsusualcarewitha4-weekfollow-upwas
conducted. There were 5 research visits: at screening, baseline,
3weeks,6weeks(endoftreatment),and10weeks(endofwash-
outphase).ThePittsburghSleepQualityIndex(PSQI)andLong-
Term Quality of Life Instrument (LTQL) were administered at
baseline and weeks 6 and 10. The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)
scorewascollectedatbaselineandweeks1through10.Studyvis-
its were conducted at the Michigan County Extension Office in
the county where women resided.
Participants
Women were recruited from the Michigan Tumor Registry. The
registry sent letters to women diagnosed as having stages 0
to III breast cancer between January 1, 2006, and December
31, 2010, from 6 Michigan counties. Eligible women had to re-
port persistent fatigue starting on or after their cancer diag-
nosis and a score of 4 or higher on the BFI.30 They also had to
be cancer free and have completed cancer treatments (except
hormone therapy) at least 12 months previously. Women were
ineligible if (1) they had untreated major depressive disorder,
otherfatigue-causingcomorbidities,oracancerdiagnosisother
than breast cancer or skin cancer within the previous 10 years;
(2) they were planning on changing or starting a new medica-
tion during the study period; or (3) they were taking any medi-
cations for insomnia or had received acupuncture or acupres-
sure within the previous 6 months.
Interventions
Usual care was defined as any treatment women were receiv-
ing from health care professionals for fatigue. At baseline,
womenweretaughttoself-administeracupressurebyatrained
acupressure educator.29 The 13 acupressure educators were
taught by one of the studyâ€™
s principal investigators (R.E.H.), an
acupuncturistwithNationalCertificationCommissionforAcu-
puncture and Oriental Medicine training. This training in-
cluded a 30-minute session in which educators were taught
point location, stimulation techniques, and pressure intensity.
Relaxing acupressure points consisted of yin tang,
anmian, heart 7, spleen 6, and liver 3. Four acupoints were per-
formed bilaterally, with yin tang done centrally. Stimulating
acupressure points consisted of du 20, conception vessel 6,
large intestine 4, stomach 36, spleen 6, and kidney 3. Points
Key Points
Question What is the efficacy of 2 types of self-administered
acupressure compared with usual care for treating chronic fatigue,
poor sleep, and low quality of life in fatigued breast cancer
survivors?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 288 breast
cancer survivors, the percentages of women who achieved normal
fatigue levels at week 6 were 66.2% in relaxing acupressure,
60.9% in stimulating acupressure, and 31.3% in usual care. Only
women in the stimulating acupressure arm experienced significant
improvement in both sleep quality and quality of life vs usual care.
Meaning Self-administered relaxing acupressure may be a useful
treatment for improving fatigue, sleep, and quality of life.

were administered bilaterally except for du 20 and concep-
tionvessel6,whichweredonecentrally(eFigureinSupplement
2). Women were told to perform acupressure once per day and
to stimulate each point in a circular motion for 3 minutes.
The assessments for fidelity of both acupressure educa-
tors and participants have been previously described.31 Par-
ticipants were assessed for how well they performed acupres-
sure at their baseline visits and at weeks 3 and 6. Participants
wereaskedtolocateallacupointsanddemonstratetheamount
ofstimulationandtreatmentduration.Theseitemswerescored
from 0 (no answers correct) to 100 (all answers correct). The
acupressure educators were assessed in the same way as the
participants at least twice by the acupuncturist.
Outcome Measures
For the outcome of fatigue, we selected the BFI,30 a scale vali-
datedwithCronbachÎ± > .95inpatientswithcancer,32whichcor-
relateswellwithotherfatiguemeasures.33 TheBFIassessesthe
severity and effect of fatigue in patients with cancer during the
past 24 hours. The instrument consists of 9 items, each mea-
suring fatigue on a scale of 0 to 10, and the score is calculated
from the mean of completed items. Scores of 4 or higher indi-
cate clinically relevant fatigue.30 A 3-point change or a drop
below 4 is considered a clinically meaningful change.34
To assess sleep quality, the 19-item PSQI was used. It
evaluates sleep disturbance during the past month. The PSQI
yields a global score (Cronbach Î± = .81).32 In women with
breast cancer, a score of 8 or higher suggests poor sleep
quality.32 A 3-point change or a drop below 8 is considered
clinically meaningful.35
Quality of life was measured by the LTQL, a 34-item ques-
tionnaire evaluating functional impairment and its effect on
qualityoflifeinfemalecancersurvivorsduringthepastmonth.
The LTQL is composed of 4 subscales, including somatic, spiri-
tual and philosophical, fitness, and social support.36 The
Cronbach Î± ranges from Î± = .86 to Î± = .92 for the 4 subscales.36
Women in the acupressure arms were given a study log-
book. In it, they were instructed to record adherence to
acupressure treatments.

sure and between the 2 acupressure arms and usual care was

tively.Thebetween-participantvariancewasassumedtobe4at

figuration, the power for detecting group differences is greater
than0.95,andthepowerfordetectingasignificantgroupbyweek
interaction is 0.82, with a sample size of 100 per treatment arm
and a 5% level of significance.
Randomization, Allocation, and Blinding
Randomization (1:1:1) was computer generated by the study
statistician (A.S.) in blocks of 6 and by county. Women were
classified into 1 of 2 strata based on sleep quality at baseline
(PSQI <8 or â‰¥8).32,37,38 Participants were enrolled and as-
signed the next randomization number in their county by the
study coordinator. Before enrolling any participants into the
study, randomization numbers were written on the outside of
opaque envelopes that contained treatment assignments.
These envelopes were created by study staff who had no con-
tact with participants. All study staff were blinded. Those ran-
domized to usual care knew their study assignment, but the
womenrandomizedtoacupressure(andtheiracupressureedu-
cators) were unaware if they were receiving relaxing or stimu-
lating acupressure.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics were analyzed by treatment groups
usingmeans(SDs)forcontinuousvariablesandcountsandper-
centages for categorical variables. Balance between groups on
baseline characteristics was tested using analysis of variance
or a Pearson Ï‡2 test, as appropriate. Adverse events, fidelity,
and adherence between groups were analyzed using a
Pearson Ï‡2 test.

Of the 424 women screened, 288 were randomized. All study
visits were completed by 72.4% (71 of 98) in relaxing acupres-
sure, 73.4% (69 of 94) in stimulating acupressure, and 86.5%
(83 of 96) in usual care (P = .04 for acupressure groups vs usual
care). There were no significant differences in any sociode-
mographic or clinical characteristics, including baseline fa-
tigue, between women who completed the study and those
who withdrew. Figure 1 shows exclusions and reasons for
discontinuing interventions.

lating acupressure arms for any subscale at either week 6 or 10
(Table).
Fidelity, Adherence, and Adverse Events
At week 6, the mean (SD) fidelity ratings were 94.6% (10.2%)
and 95.3% (8.1%) in the relaxing acupressure and stimulating
acupressure arms, respectively (P = .23). There was no signifi-
cant difference in adherence between acupressure arms
(P = .11): women in relaxing acupressure self-administered a
mean (SD) of 73% (29%) of all possible sessions, while those
in the stimulating acupressure self-administered a mean (SD)
of 65% (32%) of their sessions. Six adverse events were re-
lated to the acupressure treatment. All were nonserious cases
of mild bruising at acupressure sites.
Discussion
Six weeks of daily self-administered relaxing and stimulating
acupressureledtosignificantfatiguereductionscomparedwith
usual care in persistently fatigued breast cancer survivors. At
posttreatment, 66.2% (49 of 74) of relaxing acupressure par-
ticipants and 60.9% (42 of 70) of stimulating acupressure par-
ticipants achieved normal fatigue levels compared with 31.3%
(26 of 84) of usual care participants. While both acupressure
treatments demonstrated significant, sustained improve-
ments in fatigue, only relaxing acupressure significantly im-
proved both sleep and quality of life compared with usual care.
Whymightbothacupressurearmssignificantlyimprovefa-
tigue? In our groupâ€™
s previous work, we had seen that cancer
fatiguemayarisethroughmultipledistinctmechanisms.15Simi-
larly,itisalsoknownintheacupunctureliteraturethattrueand
shamacupuncturecanimprovesymptomsequally,buttheyap-
pear to work via different mechanisms.40 Therefore, relaxing
acupressure and stimulating acupressure could elicit improve-
ments in symptoms through distinct mechanisms, including
bothspecificandnonspecificeffects.Theseresultsarealsocon-
sistentwithTCMtheoryforthese2acupointformulas,whereby
the relaxing acupressure acupoints were selected to treat in-
somnia by providing more restorative sleep and improving fa-
tigue and the stimulating acupressure acupoints were chosen
to improve daytime activity levels by targeting alertness.
How could acupressure lead to improvements in fatigue?
The etiology of persistent fatigue in cancer survivors is related
to elevations in brain glutamate levels, as well as total creatine
levelsintheinsula.15Studiesinacupunctureresearchhavedem-
onstrated that brain physiology,41 chemistry,42 and function43
canalsobealteredwithacupointstimulation.Wepositthatself-
administered acupressure may have similar effects.

for lifestyle interventions, such as exercise.47 Still, it is difficult
toknowthelong-termefficacyofthistreatmentbeyond4weeks.
Also, for a small number (6 of 288), this intervention was a sub-
optimal treatment owing to complaints of bruising or difficulty
doing acupressure.
Future acupressure studies should investigate how to
best implement acupressure in real-world clinical settings
and in the community or more broadly disseminate the
therapy through web-based or mobile applications. There is
also a lack of studies examining the mechanisms of how
acupressure affects fatigue. Such studies could contribute
important insights into underlying acupressure mecha-
nisms and chronic fatigue in cancer survivors. Last, investi-
gations of which cancer survivors are most likely to benefit
from acupressure would help guide clinical recommenda-
tions and improve evidence-based treatment for fatigued
breast cancer survivors.
Conclusions
In summary, both acupressure arms significantly reduced
fatigue compared with usual care, but only relaxing acu-
pressure had a significant effect on improving both sleep
and quality of life. Improvements in fatigue, sleep, and
quality of life were sustained for 4 weeks after cessation of
acupressure. Self-administered relaxing acupressure could
offer an inexpensive, easy-to-learn intervention for improv-
ing fatigue, sleep, and quality of life in fatigued breast
cancer survivors.
