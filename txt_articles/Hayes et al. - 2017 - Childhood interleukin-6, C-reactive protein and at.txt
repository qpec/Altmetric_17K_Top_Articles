Background. There are no existing longitudinal studies of inflammatory markers and atopic disorders in childhood
and risk of hypomanic symptoms in adulthood. This study examined if childhood: (1) serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
C-reactive protein (CRP); and (2) asthma and/or eczema are associated with features of hypomania in young adulthood.
Method. Participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, a prospective general population UK
birth cohort, had non-fasting blood samples for IL-6 and CRP measurement at the age of 9 years (n = 4645), and parents
answered a question about doctor-diagnosed atopic illness before the age of 10 years (n = 7809). These participants com-
pleted the Hypomania Checklist at age 22 years (n = 3361).
Results. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status, past psychological and behavioural problems,
body mass index and maternal postnatal depression, participants in the top third of IL-6 values at 9 years, compared
with the bottom third, had an increased risk of hypomanic symptoms by age 22 years [adjusted odds ratio 1.77, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.10–2.85, p < 0.001]. Higher IL-6 levels in childhood were associated with adult hypomania fea-
tures in a dose–response fashion. After further adjustment for depression at the age of 18 years this association remained
(adjusted odds ratio 1.70, 95% CI 1.03–2.81, p = 0.038). There was no evidence of an association of hypomanic symptoms
with CRP levels, asthma or eczema in childhood.
Conclusions. Higher levels of systemic inflammatory marker IL-6 in childhood were associated with hypomanic symp-
toms in young adulthood, suggesting that inflammation may play a role in the pathophysiology of mania. Inflammatory
pathways may be suitable targets for the prevention and intervention for bipolar disorder.

Introduction
The role of inflammation in a variety of mental disor-
ders
has
become
a
topic
of
renewed
interest
(Krishnadas
&
Cavanagh,
2012;
Harrison,
2013;
Kiecolt-Glaser et al. 2015). There is now considerable
evidence that acute psychotic, manic and depressive
episodes are associated with abnormalities in a range
of inflammatory markers, including elevation of proi-
nflammatory cytokines (Frommberger et al. 1997;
Dickerson et al. 2007; Goldstein et al. 2011; Berk et al.
2013; Khandaker et al. 2015). There is also evidence
that these disorders are longitudinally associated
with previous inflammatory illnesses, for example ma-
ternal and childhood infections have been identified as
risk factors for schizophrenia (Khandaker et al. 2012,
2013) and bipolar disorder (Parboosing et al. 2013).
Individuals with psychotic and affective illnesses are
also at increased risk of developing conditions with
an inflammatory basis, such as diabetes and cardiovas-
cular disease (Osborn et al. 2008; De Hert et al. 2009).
However, there is a paucity of longitudinal research in-
vestigating whether alterations in inflammatory mar-
kers occur as a precursor to mental disorders. Data

 Children (ALSPAC), a UK general population birth co-
hort, recently showed that higher serum levels of
interleukin-6 (IL-6) in childhood is associated with de-
pression and psychosis in young adult life (Khandaker
et al. 2014a).
ALSPAC data have also shown an association be-
tween childhood atopic disorders and psychotic symp-
toms in adolescents (Khandaker et al. 2014b). A
longitudinal association between asthma and subse-
quent hospitalization for schizophrenia, and adult
diagnoses of depression has been reported (Timonen
et al. 2003; Pedersen et al. 2012; Sanna et al. 2014),
and three longitudinal studies have reported increased
rates of bipolar disorder in individuals with asthma
(Liang & Chikritzhs, 2013; Chen et al. 2014; Lin et al.
2014). IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and other inflam-
matory markers are associated with asthma and ec-
zema (Takemura et al. 2006; Arif et al. 2007; Rincon &
Irvin, 2012). However, to our knowledge there have
been no previous studies showing temporal associa-
tions between inflammatory markers, atopic condi-
tions and features of hypomania. Indeed it may be
that this association is less likely than a longitudinal as-
sociation with psychotic experiences as, whilst it has
been found that chronic immune activation occurs in
schizophrenia, previous research has suggested that bi-
polar disorder is an episode-related inflammatory syn-
drome,
with
normal
cytokine
function
between
affective episodes (Kunz et al. 2011; Stertz et al. 2013).
Hypomanic symptoms in early adulthood are a risk
factor for developing bipolar disorder (Zimmermann
et al. 2009), but are also associated with increased fu-
ture risk of non-affective Axis I disorders, personality
disorders, mental health service use and psychotropic
drug prescribing (Päären et al. 2014).
Using data from ALSPAC we assessed associations
between serum CRP and IL-6, aged 9 years, atopic con-
ditions (asthma and eczema) before age 10 years, and
lifetime experience of hypomanic symptoms assessed
at 22 years. We hypothesized that atopic disorders
and raised inflammatory markers would be associated
with increased risk of hypomanic symptoms, and that
inflammatory markers would mediate the association
between atopic conditions and features of hypomania
(Fig. 1).
Method
Description of cohort
The ALSPAC birth cohort is comprised of all live births
in the County of Avon, UK, with expected due dates
between April 1991 and December 1992. The initial co-
hort consisted of 14 062 live births, with 13 998 alive at
1 year (http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/). From birth,
parents completed regular questionnaires about all
aspects of their child’s health and development. From
age 7 years, children attended a clinic to participate
in various tests and interviews on an annual basis.
ALSPAC has been used for a vast array of research
topics (Fraser et al. 2013). Ethical approval for the
study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and
Law
Committee
and
Local
Research
Ethics
Committees.
This study is based on the cohort of 4645 children
who had analysable blood samples taken aged 9
years after excluding those with an infection around
the time of blood collection, 7809 who answered ques-
tions about atopic conditions aged 10 years and 3361
who completed the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32)
(Fig. 1).
Assessment of hypomanic symptoms
Features of hypomania were identified using the
HCL-32 which was sent to participants when they
were aged 22 years. The HCL-32 is a self-completed

 questionnaire for a lifetime history of hypomanic
symptoms (Angst et al. 2005). It asks respondents to
consider a time when they were in a ‘high or hyper’
state and endorse a number of statements about their
emotions, thoughts and behaviours at this time.
Examples of these 32 statements are: ‘I think faster’;
‘I make more jokes or puns when I am talking’; and
‘I take more risks in my daily life’. None of the state-
ments describe psychotic experiences. It also asks
about the duration of such episodes and their impact
on family, social and work life. The HCL-32 has been
used as both a continuous and categorical measure of
hypomanic symptoms (Court et al. 2014; Carvalho
et al. 2015). Although initially developed as a screening
instrument for use in people diagnosed with depres-
sive disorders, it is also a sensitive screening tool in
non-clinical settings (Meyer et al. 2007).
We defined lifetime history of hypomanic symptoms
in line with previous approaches for studies of this na-
ture, namely: a score of 14 or more out of the possible
32 questions on hypomanic features, plus at least one
response of either ‘negative consequences’ or ‘negative
plus positive consequences’, plus a report that these
mood changes causes some kind of reaction in others,
plus a duration of ‘2–3 days’ or more. Overall, this
definition of hypomanic symptoms, which includes se-
verity, impairment and duration criteria, is more con-
servative than several other studies, which have
tended to use only the threshold score of 14 (Hardoy
et al. 2005; Meyer et al. 2007, 2014). We chose a duration
criterion of 2–3 days or more because the 4-day thresh-
old within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM) excludes many individuals
with bipolar disorder type II (Goldberg et al. 2009;
Bauer et al. 2011; Parker et al. 2014), and because 2
days is known to be the modal duration of hypomania
in bipolar II disorder (Benazzi, 2001; Angst & Cassano,
2005). Based on previous work in non-clinical samples,
we expected 5–10% of respondents to satisfy our cri-
teria for features of hypomania (Meyer et al. 2007;
Holtmann et al. 2009). Hypomanic symptoms were
not clinically verified in the cohort.
Assays for inflammatory markers
The acute-phase protein, CRP; and the pleiotropic
cytokine, IL-6, were assayed from non-fasting blood
samples
collected
in
participants
aged
9
years.
Parents of 7236 children gave informed consent for
venepuncture. The procedure was successfully com-
pleted such that IL-6 and CRP were measured in
5076 individuals. Of these, 431 children reported an in-
fection in the 7 days preceding venepuncture and were
excluded from the cohort, as we were interested in im-
mune activity in healthy individuals.
Serum was isolated after blood collection and stored
in 1 ml aliquots at −80°C. Analysis of these samples
was carried out in 2008 following a median of 7.5
years of storage, with no freeze–thaw cycles during
storage. The automated particle-enhanced Tina-quant
immunoturbidimetric assay (Roche UK) was used
to measure high-sensitivity CRP. An enzyme-linked
immunosorbant assay (ELISA) (R&D systems, UK)
was used to measure IL-6. These methods have been
reported elsewhere (Khandaker et al. 2014a). All inter-
and intra-assay coefficients of variation for IL-6 and
CRP were less than 5%. No other inflammatory mar-
kers were measured. The minimum detection limit
for IL-6 was 0.1 pg/ml. This represents the lowest mea-
sureable analytic level that can be distinguished from
zero. Those below this limit were assigned a value of
zero (0.4% of the sample), and were also included in
our analysis. In the total sample IL-6 values ranged
from 0.1 to 20.1 pg/ml. The minimum detection limit
for CRP was 0.03 mg/l. Of the participants, 29 (0.6%
of the sample) were below this limit, and were
assigned values of 0.01 pg/ml (n = 16) and 0.02 mg/l
(n = 13); they were also included in the analysis. In
the total sample, CRP values ranged from 0.01 to
45.17 mg/l (32 subjects over 10 mg/l).
Assessment of atopic disorders
When participants were aged 10 years, parents com-
pleted a postal questionnaire which included the ques-
tion: ‘Has a doctor ever actually said that your study
child has asthma or eczema?’ Possible responses to
this question which are used in this study were: no
asthma or eczema (reference group); asthma only; ec-
zema only; both asthma and eczema.
Assessment of confounders
A number of potential childhood and parental con-
founders were defined a priori: age at the time of hypo-
mania assessment; sex; ethnicity; socio-economic status
(SES) (defined as paternal social class using the six cat-
egories of the UK Office of National Statistics classifica-
tion system); psychological and behavioural problems
at
baseline
[using
the
Strengths
and
Difficulties
Questionnaire (SDQ), completed by parents when chil-
dren were aged 7 years]; baseline body mass index
(BMI) (measured at 9 years old), and mother’s post-
natal depression score [using the Edinburgh Postnatal
Depression Scale (EPDS) recorded at 8 weeks post-
partum]. These confounders were selected because
they represent a range of measures of childhood adver-
sity, all of which have been found to be associated with
inflammatory processes in childhood and risk of adult
mental disorders. We also ran an additional model
adjusting for International Classification of Diseases
Interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and atopic disorders as risk factors for hypomanic symptoms

 (ICD)-10 diagnosis of depression at the age of 18 years
made via the Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised
(CIS-R) (Lewis et al. 1992). This was to check that any
association was not purely driven by the previously
reported relationship between inflammatory markers
and depression symptoms in this cohort (Khandaker
et al. 2014a).
Statistical analysis
Inflammatory markers and hypomania
We used logistic regression to calculate the odds ratio
(OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for hypomanic
symptoms in individuals in the middle and top thirds
of IL-6 and CRP compared with the bottom third (ref-
erence group). Linear trend was tested when tertiles of
values of each inflammatory marker were treated as a
linear term. Regression models were adjusted for age,
sex, ethnicity, SES, SDQ score, BMI and EPDS score.
Additionally,
we
calculated
ORs
for
hypomanic
symptoms for each standard deviation (S.D.) increase
in IL-6 and CRP in childhood using these inflamma-
tory markers as continuous variables (z-transformed
values). A quadratic term (for example IL-62) was
included in these regression models to assess potential
non-linearity.
Atopic disorders and hypomania
Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate
the OR and 95% CI for features of hypomania in
those with asthma only, eczema only, and both asthma
and eczema, compared with no asthma or eczema (ref-
erence group). Regression models were adjusted for
age at time of HCL-32 completion, sex, ethnicity,
SES, SDQ score, BMI and EPDS score.
Inflammatory markers and atopic disorders
Normality of distributions of IL-6 and CRP was
achieved following natural logarithmic transformation.
Linear regression was carried out using transformed
values of inflammatory markers as the dependent vari-
able comparing the groups with asthma, eczema, and
both with participants with no atopic condition. Sex,
ethnicity, SES, SDQ score, BMI and EPDS score were
included as potential confounders.
Imputation of missing data
Following a complete-case analysis, we imputed miss-
ing data for all individuals who had completed the ato-
pic disorder questions at the age of 9 years (n = 7809).
We used sex, ethnicity, SES, SDQ score, BMI, EPDS
score,
IL-6
and
CRP
counts
to
predict
missing
HCL-32 score at the age of 22 years. We also included
scores from the Psychosis-Like Symptom Interview
and the CIS-R to improve the imputation model.
These measures were completed when participants
were aged 18 years. Multiple imputation using chained
equations was completed using the mi and associated
commands in Stata 13 (USA). A total of 100 imputed
datasets were added. All regression models described
above were repeated following multiple imputation,
as well as models with additional adjustment for ICD
diagnosis of depression at the age of 18 years.
Results
Baseline characteristics
Data on inflammatory biomarkers were available for
4645 participants (Table 1). Higher serum IL-6 levels
at age 9 years were associated with female sex, non-
white British ethnicity, lower SES, higher past psycho-
logical and behavioural problems and higher BMI.
Atopic disorder diagnosis was known for 7809 chil-
dren (Table 2). Children with atopic disorders had
higher serum CRP and IL-6 levels at age 9 years.
Children with asthma or both asthma and eczema
were more likely to be boys, and they had higher ma-
ternal EPDS scores, childhood SDQ scores and BMI. Of
those who completed the CIS-R at 18 years and
HCL-32 at 22 years (n = 2298), 21 (1%) fulfilled criteria
for hypomanic symptoms and ICD-10 depression.
Inflammatory markers and the risk of hypomanic
symptoms at age 22 years
Of participants who had a blood test at the age of 9
years, 1717 with IL-6 and 1721 with CRP results
completed the HCL-32 at 22 years. In total, 116
(6.8%) fulfilled criteria for hypomanic symptoms via
HCL-32. Those in the top third of IL-6 at 9 years had
an increased risk of hypomanic symptoms aged 22
years, compared with those in the bottom third. This
relationship became stronger after adjusting for age,
sex, ethnicity, SES, SDQ, BMI and EPDS; adjusted
OR for hypomanic symptoms for participants in the
top third of IL-6, compared with the bottom third,
was 1.87 (95% CI 1.07–3.27, p = 0.028). There was also
evidence of a relationship between IL-6 and hypoman-
ic symptoms when IL-6 values divided into thirds
were treated as a linear term (OR for trend 1.36, 95%
CI 1.03–1.78, p = 0.027). Using IL-6 as a continuous
measure, the adjusted OR for hypomanic symptoms
was 1.21 (95% CI 1.03–1.43, p = 0.021) for each 1 S.D.
increase in IL-6. There was no evidence to support a
non-linear relationship. There was no evidence of an
association between CRP levels and hypomanic symp-
toms. Evidence for an association between IL-6 and
hypomanic
symptoms
remained
unchanged

 multiple imputation for missing data (Table 3). In the
multiple imputation dataset the association between
IL-6 and hypomanic symptoms remained after add-
itional adjustment for depression (OR for top third
compared with bottom third 1.70, 95% CI 1.03–2.81,
p = 0.038).
Atopic disorders and the risk of hypomanic
symptoms at age 22 years
At age 22 years, 207 of 2880 respondents with atopic
condition and HCL-32 data met our pre-defined cri-
teria for lifetime hypomanic symptoms (7.2%). There
was no evidence for an increased odds of hypomanic
symptoms in children with asthma, eczema or both
asthma and eczema, compared with those with no ato-
pic illness. Adjustment for potential confounders had
minimal influence on the magnitude of these ORs
(Table 4). Multiple imputation of missing values did
not alter these results.
Atopic disorders and inflammatory markers in
childhood
Data on atopic disorders and IL-6 were available for
3891 individuals. Diagnoses of asthma (β = 0.081, S.E.
= 0.041, p = 0.048), eczema (β = 0.102,
S.E. = 0.042, p =
0.014) or both (β = 0.127, S.E. = 0.055, p = 0.020) before
the age of 10 years were all associated with increased
serum IL-6 at the age of 9 years. However, following
adjustment for sex, ethnicity, SES, EPDS, SDQ and
BMI there was no evidence of an association. In total,
3898 individuals had both CRP and atopic disorder in-
formation. Again, each atopic illness was associated
with elevated CRP: asthma (β = 0.121, S.E. = 0.054, p =
0.026); eczema (β = 0.155,
S.E. = 0.056, p = 0.006) and

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demon-
strate a longitudinal dose–response relationship be-
tween childhood IL-6 levels at the age of 9 years and
features
of
hypomania
in
early
adulthood.
The
relationship persists after adjustment for potential
confounders such as age, sex, ethnicity, SES, and psy-
chological and behavioural problems preceding the
measurement of IL-6, BMI and maternal postnatal de-
pression. The association was also independent of
diagnosed depression at 18 years. We did not find an
association between CRP and hypomanic symptoms,
as defined by HCL-32. We also found no evidence of
association between asthma or eczema before the age
of 10 years and features of hypomania. There was no
evidence of an association between atopic disorders
and IL-6 or CRP following adjustment for sex, ethni-
city, SES, BMI, SDQ and EPDS scores.
The finding of an association between IL-6 and
features of hypomania echoes the results from a previ-
ous study from the ALSPAC cohort that reported an
association between childhood IL-6 and depressive
and psychotic symptoms at the age of 18 years
(Khandaker et al. 2014a). Combined, this body of
work suggests that aberrant immune response in
childhood might influence the risk of a range of
major mental disorders. It is recognized that hypo-
manic symptoms in early adulthood are associated
generally with an increased risk of Axis I disorders,
and specifically with developing bipolar disorder
(Zimmermann et al. 2009; Päären et al. 2014). The result
is particularly interesting as it suggests an association
of subtle changes in cytokine levels in early life with
hypomanic symptoms assessed in adulthood, where
previous
research
has
found
immune
activation
returns to normal between affective episodes in bipolar
disorder (Kunz et al. 2011; Stertz et al. 2013).
The lack of evidence for an association between ato-
pic illness and hypomanic symptoms is surprising
given a number of cross-sectional studies (Goodwin
et al. 2003; Beyer et al. 2005; Jerrell et al. 2010) and lon-
gitudinal studies (Liang & Chikritzhs, 2013; Chen et al.
2014; Lin et al. 2014) have reported an association be-
tween asthma and bipolar disorder. This may be be-
cause previous studies have examined the severe end
of the bipolar spectrum (hospitalization for bipolar dis-
order) and this association may not hold when our
broad definition of hypomania is used. The only
study to examine asthma in childhood and later-onset
bipolar disorder was a cohort with a new diagnosis of
asthma between the ages of 10 and 15 years, which

 found that individuals with asthma had more than a
twofold risk of bipolar disorder (Chen et al. 2014). It
is recognized that individuals who have persistent
asthma through adolescence, or develop asthma in
adolescence, have worse physical health outcomes
than children whose asthma resolves in early adoles-
cence (Sears et al. 2003). It is possible that this is also
true in terms of psychiatric outcomes, and that with
a cut-off for asthma and eczema before the age of 10
years we have examined a highly heterogeneous
group in terms of severity and underlying immuno-
pathology (Wenzel, 2006).
There is limited current understanding of mechan-
isms by which changes in inflammatory pathways
could induce hypomanic symptoms. However, it is
notable that serotonin-
and tryptophan-degrading
enzymes are activated by inflammatory cytokines
such as IL-6 (Müller & Schwarz, 2007). As well as
influencing monoamine cascades, cytokine production
has effects on cholinergic, muscarinic and gutamater-
gic systems which are associated with a range of affect-
ive
and
psychotic
symptoms
(Berk
et
al.
2011;
Khandaker & Dantzer, 2016). The potential effects of
IL-6 in particular are complex; it is implicated in activa-
tion of the immune system (as a proinflammatory
cytokine),
but
it
is
also
involved
in
the
anti-
inflammatory regulation of neural, regenerative and
metabolic activity (Scheller et al. 2011). Peripheral
cytokines such as IL-6 can communicate with the
brain in a number of ways (Khandaker & Dantzer,
2016). Immunoactivation in mice and healthy volun-
teers by injection of lipopolysaccharide has been
reported to increase circulating proinflammatory cyto-
kine levels (IL-1β, IL-6) as well as producing symptoms
of
anxiety
and
reduced
cognitive
performance
(Reichenberg et al. 2001; Rossi et al. 2012). A study of
human
volunteers
suggests
inflammation
causes
mood changes through alterations in subgenual cingu-
late activity and mesolimbic connectivity, which is in
part mediated by peripheral IL-6 (Harrison et al.
2009). An immunological understanding of major men-
tal illness could potentially lead to novel approaches to
diagnosis, prevention and treatment.
Potential limitations
Over 60% of those with IL-6 data did not complete the
HCL-32 aged 22 years. However, the association be-
tween IL-6 and hypomanic symptoms remained un-
changed after multiple imputation for missing data
which increases confidence in the observed results.
There was no evidence that median values of IL-6
for those who completed HCL-32 were different from
non-completers. Of those participants who answered
the atopic disorders question, individuals with a
completed HCL-32 aged 22 years were more likely to
be female, have lower SDQ scores aged 7 years, have
mothers with lower EPDS scores and fathers in non-
manual occupations. It is likely that attrition resulted
in an underestimation of prevalence of hypomanic
symptoms, as these factors were associated with a
lower risk of reporting features of hypomania.
The outcome measure, the HCL-32, may be subject
to reporting bias because it is a self-report measure
that asks sensitive questions in areas such as risk tak-
ing, sexual activity and alcohol use. However, this in-
strument is well validated in clinical young adult
population groups as a screening tool for bipolar dis-
order (Meyer et al. 2007). There have not yet been sen-
sitivity and specificity tests of the HCL-32 as a
categorical measure which includes duration and im-
pact on functioning. However, it is likely that by in-
cluding
questions
on
these
features
we
have
improved sensitivity for a diagnosis of hypomania
compared with methods which have previously relied
solely on a recommended (arbitrary) cut-off of endors-
ing 14 from the 32 mood questions (Carvalho et al.
2015). It is also unlikely that false positives would
occur differentially for different tertiles of IL-6 or
CRP, or by asthma/eczema diagnosis. Prevalence esti-
mates of hypomania in non-clinical samples using
this format of HCL-32 also appear to be comparable
with bipolar disorder prevalence in other sources
(Meyer et al. 2007). Clinical verification of hypomania
and information on bipolar disorder diagnoses would
strengthen our conclusions, but it is likely that a
number of individuals with hypomania symptoms
will progress to a diagnosis and these symptoms are
associated with a range of adverse psychiatric out-
comes (Zimmermann et al. 2009; Päären et al. 2014).
The items in the HCL-32 do not relate to symptoms
of psychosis or depression, and after additional adjust-
ment for depression the association remained, so the
relationship cannot be driven by this previously iden-
tified association (Khandaker et al. 2014a).
Having a diagnosis of asthma or eczema was
defined by parental report. The study may have been
improved
by
a
test
confirming
this
diagnosis.
However, the question ‘has a doctor ever actually
said that your study child has asthma or eczema?’
has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific
when
compared
with
linked
general
practitioner
records (Cornish et al. 2014) and there is unlikely to
be any differential misclassification of this exposure.
Prevalence of atopic conditions in the ALSPAC cohort
by aged 10 years is similar to other UK estimates
(Asher et al. 2006; Shamssain, 2007).
It is possible that some of the differences in IL-6 and
CRP levels detected are due to diurnal variation in
non-fasting blood samples, which would increase

 chances of null findings (Scheiermann et al. 2013).
However, this potential measurement error is likely
to be random in relation to the hypomanic symptoms
outcome. Measurement error might also account for
failure to detect an association between CRP and hypo-
manic symptoms, because IL-6 stimulates the acute-
phase expression of CRP (Castell et al. 1989). It is also
possible that we failed to exclude all of those children
who were acutely unwell on the day of the blood test,
or had elevated inflammatory markers due to residual
illness. This is unlikely, as the majority of CRP and IL-6
results were within normal range. We acknowledge
that immunoglobulin E or IL-4 may be better markers
for type 1 allergic hypersensitivity, but we used IL-6
and CRP as general markers of systemic inflammation.
Conclusions
The results of this study further support the hypothesis
that inflammatory abnormalities are associated with a
range of mental disorders, and that these abnormalities
are present from childhood. It appears that there are
subtle, but longstanding abnormalities in IL-6 detect-
able long before the development of hypomanic
symptoms.
