IMPORTANCE Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor–related pneumonitis is a rare but
clinically serious and potentially life-threatening adverse event. Little is known about its
incidence across different tumor types and treatment regimens.
OBJECTIVE To compare the incidence of PD-1 inhibitor–related pneumonitis among different
tumor types and therapeutic regimens.
DATA SOURCES A PubMed search through November 10, 2015, and a review of references
from relevant articles. For the PubMed search, the following keywords or corresponding
Medical Subject Heading terms were used: nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and PD-1 inhibitor.
STUDY SELECTION Twenty-six original articles of PD-1 inhibitor trial results were identified.
Among them, 20 studies of melanoma, non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or renal cell
carcinoma (RCC) were eligible for a meta-analysis.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS The data were extracted by 1 primary reviewer and then
independently reviewed by 2 secondary reviewers following Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Comparisons of the incidence were based
on marginal, exact generalized linear models with generalized estimating equations.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence of all-grade and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis
and pneumonitis-related deaths.
RESULTS Twenty studies of single-tumor-type trials of PD-1 inhibitor (12 melanoma studies, 5
NSCLC studies, and 3 RCC studies) (a total of 4496 unique patients) were included in the
meta-analysis. The overall incidence of pneumonitis during PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy was
2.7% (95% CI, 1.9%-3.6%) for all-grade and 0.8% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.2%) for grade 3 or higher
pneumonitis. The incidence was higher in NSCLC for all-grade (4.1% vs 1.6%; P = .002) and
grade 3 or higher pneumonitis (1.8% vs 0.2%; P < .001) compared with melanoma. The
incidence in RCC was higher than in melanoma for all-grade pneumonitis (4.1% vs 1.6%;
P < .001) but not for grade 3 or higher pneumonitis. Four pneumonitis-related deaths were
observed in patients with NSCLC in the monotherapy group. Pneumonitis was more frequent
during combination therapy than monotherapy for all-grade (6.6% vs 1.6%; P < .001) and
grade 3 or higher pneumonitis (1.5% vs 0.2%; P = .001) in melanoma, with 1
pneumonitis-related death during combination therapy. Multivariable analyses demonstrated
higher odds of pneumonitis in NSCLC for all-grade (odds ratio [OR], 1.43; 95% CI, 1.08-1.89;
P = .005) and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.60-5.08; P < .001) and in
RCC for all-grade pneumonitis (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.32-1.92; P < .001) compared with
melanoma. The combination therapy had significantly higher odds than monotherapy for
all-grade (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.69-2.50; P < .001) and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis (OR,
2.86; 95% CI, 1.79- 4.35; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The incidence of PD-1 inhibitor–related pneumonitis was
higher in NSCLC and RCC and during combination therapy. These findings contribute to
enhance awareness among clinicians and support further investigations to meet the clinical
needs.

P
rogrammed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors have marked
efficacy in the treatment of advanced cancers.1-4 Cur-
rently, 2 agents, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, have
been approved for treatment of advanced melanoma and non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and nivolumab has recently
beenapprovedforadvancedrenalcellcarcinomas(RCCs).Com-
bination therapy of nivolumab with a CTLA-4 inhibitor, ipili-
mumab, has also been approved as a treatment option for
melanoma.5,6 These regulatory approvals have resulted in rap-
idly expanding access and widespread prescribing of these
agents in the clinical setting.
Immune-checkpoint blockade by PD-1 inhibitors is
associated with a unique set of toxic effects, which are rec-
ognized as immune-related adverse events (IRAEs).7-10 Mul-
tiple organ systems can be affected by IRAEs. Among them,
pneumonitis during PD-1 inhibitor therapy has been reported
as a relatively uncommon but serious and potentially life-
threatening IRAE, resulting in pneumonitis-related deaths in
phase 1 trials,2,11,12 and has been recognized as 1 of the events
of special interest.2,4,13
Although most clinical trials have reported pneumonitis
as an IRAE during PD-1 inhibitor therapy, there has been no re-
port of a systematic review or meta-analysis of the incidence
of PD-1 inhibitor–related pneumonitis across different tumor
types and between single-agent vs combination therapies.
Because this is a relatively rare adverse event, the knowl-
edge based on the individual cohort data from each trial is
limited. Given the increasing number of published reports
of trial results of PD-1 inhibitors, such an investigation may
provide important knowledge of this rare but clinically sig-
nificant and potentially serious IRAE. We conducted a sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis of trials of PD-1 inhibitors
in patients with cancer and compared the incidence of
pneumonitis among the cohorts with different tumors types
and between the groups treated with monotherapy vs
combination therapy.
Methods
Search Methods and Study Selection
Original articles that have published the results of prospec-
tive trials of PD-1 inhibitor therapy for patients with cancer
using nivolumab or pembrolizumab, including mono-
therapy and combination therapy trials, were identified by a
PubMed search and by examining the references of pub-
lished trials, review articles, editorials, and other relevant
articles. For the PubMed search, the following keywords or
corresponding Medical Subject Heading terms were used:
nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and PD-1 inhibitor. The data-
base was searched for articles published on or before
November 10, 2015. Articles published online ahead of print
were included. Meeting abstracts without published full-
text original articles were not eligible for this study. The
search focused on the trials of nivolumab and pembroli-
zumab because these 2 agents have been granted approvals
by the US Food and Drug Administration and are widely
available by prescription in the clinical setting.
Data Extraction
The total number of patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors, the
number of patients with pneumonitis for all grades and for
grade 3 or higher, and the number of pneumonitis-related
deaths were collected from the eligible articles. Cases listed as
pneumonitis were included in the number of pneumonitis
events. Other related pulmonary conditions listed separately
with the terms pneumonia or interstitial lung disease were not
included.Thetrialphases,tumortypes,typesofspecificagents
(nivolumab or pembrolizumab and additional agents in trials
of combination therapy), doses, and frequency of drug admin-
istration were recorded. Treatment regimen was classified as
PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy or combination therapy. The data
extractionwasperformedby1primaryreviewer(M.N.)andwas
then independently reviewed by 2 secondary reviewers (H.H.
and N.H.R.) following Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
Statistical Analysis
Study Weights
Weights for each study in the analysis were based on the in-
dividual sample sizes. In step 1, the percentage of patients con-
tained in each study was calculated based on the total of 4496
patients (ie, 100 × sample size/4496). In step 2, each weight
was normalized according to the smallest percentage ob-
served so that the smallest weight was 1. This process was done
by dividing the percentage in step 1 by 0.733986, which was
the percentage of the total sample for the smallest study. The
resulting weights ranged from 1 to 16.8.
Forest Plots
Incidence rates for each study are displayed in forest plots with
95% CIs estimated using exact binomial methods. The over-
all estimate for each set of graphs was based on the mean
weighted incidence from 1000 samples bootstrapped from the
subsetofstudiesthatmetthecriteria(eg,monotherapy,mono-
therapy with lung cancers). The estimated CIs were based on
the percentile method, which identified the 2.5% and 97.5%
percentile values in the list of 1000 estimated incidence rates
from the bootstrap sampling.
Key Points
Question What is the incidence of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)
inhibitor–related pneumonitis among different tumor types and
therapeutic regimens?
Findings In this meta-analysis of 20 published PD-1 inhibitor trials
including 4496 patients, the overall incidence of pneumonitis was
2.7% for monotherapy and 6.6% for combination therapy. The
incidence was significantly higher in patients with non–small cell
lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma than in melanoma and was
also higher in the combination therapy group when compared with
the monotherapy group.
Meaning Higher incidence of PD-1 inhibitor–related pneumonitis
in patients with non–small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma
and during combination therapy indicates the need for increased
awareness for this clinically significant immune-related adverse
event.

Inference
Comparisons of overall incidence rates between tumor types
or monotherapy vs combination therapy were based on mar-
ginal, exact generalized linear models. Because the data are
correlated by study, estimation used generalized estimating
equations.
Multivariable Models
Generalized linear models with generalized estimating equa-
tions were fit to assess important predictors of all-grade pneu-
monitis or grade 3 or higher pneumonitis. Three independent
variables were included in each model: tumor type, mono-
therapy vs combination therapy, and trial phase. Statistical
heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane Q statistics,14 and
inconsistency was quantified using I2 statistics (100 × [Q –
df]/Q) that estimate the percentage of total variation across
studies attributable to heterogeneity.15,16 We considered an I2
value greater than 50% to be indicative of substantial hetero-
geneity. Publication bias was assessed using Begg and Egger
tests with funnel plots.17,18 For all models, reported P values
and 95% CIs were adjusted using the Holm-Bonferroni method
to preserve overall type I error rates of .05 for each analysis.
Results
Eligible Studies and Characteristics
The PubMed search and the review of reference lists identi-
fied a total of 481 records for screening (Figure 1). After screen-
ing and eligibility assessment, a total of 26 eligible studies
(n = 4945 patients) were identified.1-6,11,12,19-36 Tumor types
tested in these studies included melanoma (n = 12), NSCLC
(n = 5), advanced solid tumors (n = 4), RCC (n = 3), lym-
phoma(n = 1),andovariancancer(n = 1).These26studieswere
included in a systematic review of the incidence of PD-1 pneu-
monitis (Table 1).
These 26 articles were assessed for inclusion in the meta-
analysis, which was primarily designed to compare the inci-
dence of PD-1 pneumonitis among different tumor types. Four
studies1,2,27,28 of advanced solid tumors were removed from
the meta-analysis because they included several tumor types,
and the breakdown of tumor types of the patients with PD-1
pneumonitis was not always available. In addition, some of
these phase 1 studies2,27 were based on the same multicenter
trials that provided the cohorts for the reports that focused on
single tumor types and thus may not be completely indepen-
dent from those in the single-tumor-type studies.3,4,11,12,23,24
Studies in ovarian cancer29 and lymphoma35 were excluded
because there is only 1 study for each tumor type with a small
samplesize.Asaresult,20studies(n = 4496patients)ofsingle-
tumor-type trials (12 melanoma studies,3-6,19,20,24,26,32-34,37 5
NSCLC studies,11,12,21,30,31 and 3 RCC studies22,23,36) were in-
cluded in the meta-analysis.
Three studies5,6,37 of melanoma reported 2 treatment arms
with different regimens (nivolumab monotherapy vs combi-
nationtherapy6,37andconcurrentvssequentialtherapyforniv-
olumabandipilimumabcombination5).Thesecohortswerere-
corded separately, resulting in a total of 29 independent study
cohorts from 26 studies for a systematic review and 23 inde-
pendent study cohorts (15 melanoma, 5 lung, and 3 RCC co-
horts) from 20 eligible studies for a meta-analysis.
Incidence of PD-1 Pneumonitis
Table 1 describes the incidence of PD-1 pneumonitis for all-
grade and for grade 3 and higher and the incidence of pneu-
monitis-related death in the 26 studies. The incidence of pneu-
monitis ranged from 0% to 10.6% for all-grade pneumonitis
and from 0% to 4.3% for grade 3 or higher pneumonitis. Pneu-
monitis-related deaths were reported in 4 studies, with the
number of deaths ranging from 1 to 3 (0.2%-2.3%). Of these 26
studies,1-6,11,12,19-36 20 studies3-6,11,12,19-24,26,30-34,36,37 focus-
ing on melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC were assessed in the meta-
analysis.
Incidence Among Patients With Melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC
Treated With PD-1 Inhibitor Monotherapy
The estimated incidences of pneumonitis based on 1000 boot-
strap samples were obtained for patients with melanoma,
NSCLC, or RCC treated with monotherapy using single-agent
nivolumab or pembrolizumab (eTable in the Supplement). The
overall incidence of pneumonitis was 2.7% (95% CI, 1.9%-
3.6%) for all-grade pneumonitis (Figure 2) and 0.8% (95%
CI, 0.4%-1.2%) for grade 3 or higher pneumonitis in the mono-
therapy group (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
On the basis of the univariate generalized estimating equa-
tion models, including tumor type alone as the predictor, the
incidence of pneumonitis in NSCLC was significantly higher
compared with melanoma for all-grade pneumonitis (4.1% vs
1.6%; P = .002) and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis (1.8% vs
0.2%; P < .001). The incidence in RCC was significantly higher
compared with melanoma for all-grade pneumonitis (4.1% vs
1.6%; P < .001); however, the incidence was not significantly

different for grade 3 or higher pneumonitis. No significant dif-
ferences were noted between NSCLC and RCC for all-grade

olumab plus peptide vaccines.32,37 One of the combination
therapy trials investigated nivolumab plus peptide vaccine as
adjuvant therapy for resected stage IIIC and IV melanoma.32
The incidence was significantly higher in the combina-
tion therapy group compared with the monotherapy group
for all-grade (6.6% vs 1.6%; P < .001) and grade 3 or higher
pneumonitis(1.5%vs0.2%;P = .001)(eTableintheSupplement
and Figure 3). One pneumonitis-related death was reported in
the combination therapy group treated with nivolumab and
ipilimumab.
Multivariable Analyses
The results of multivariable analyses are summarized for all-
gradepneumonitisandgrade3orhigherpneumonitis(Table2).
After adjusting for correlated incidence data and controlling
for agents and trial phases, patients with NSCLC were signifi-
cantly more likely to experience any grade pneumonitis (odds
ratio [OR], 1.43; 95% CI, 1.08-1.89; P = .005) and grade 3 or
higher pneumonitis (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.60-5.08; P < .001)
compared with patients with melanoma. Patients with RCC
were significantly more likely to experience all-grade pneu-
monitis than patients with melanoma (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.32-
1.92; P < .001); however, the odds of experiencing grade 3 or
higher pneumonitis were not significantly different between
the 2 groups (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 0.68-7.14; P = .22). The odds
of experiencing pneumonitis were not significantly different
between patients with NSCLC and RCC.
After adjusting for correlated incidence data and control-
ling for tumor types and trial phases, we found no significant
differences between nivolumab and pembrolizumab for all-
grade pneumonitis and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis. Pa-
tients receiving combination therapy were significantly more
likely to experience pneumonitis compared with patients re-
ceivingmonotherapyforall-gradepneumonitis(OR,2.04;95%
CI, 1.69-2.50; P < .001) and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis (OR,
2.86; 95% CI, 1.79-4.35; P < .001). When the combination
therapy group was subdivided into the nivolumab plus ipili-
mumab group and the nivolumab plus peptide vaccine group,
the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group had significantly higher
oddsofexperiencingpneumonitisthanthemonotherapygroup
forall-gradepneumonitis(OR,2.13;95%CI,1.75-2.63; P < .001)
and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis (OR, 2.78; 95% CI, 1.61-
4.76; P < .001). The nivolumab plus peptide vaccine group had
significantly higher odds of experiencing pneumonitis com-
pared with the monotherapy group for all-grade pneumoni-
tis (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.05-2.27; P = .03); however, the differ-
ence was not statistically significant for grade 3 or higher
pneumonitis (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 0.83-10.0; P = .08). No sig-
nificant differences were found in the odds of pneumonitis
between the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and the
nivolumab plus peptide vaccine group.
After adjusting for correlated incidence data and control-
lingfortumorandagent,wefoundthatpatientsinphase2trials
were significantly more likely to experience pneumonitis com-
pared with patients in phase 3 trials for all-grade pneumoni-
tis (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.40; P = .003); however, no signifi-
cant differences were observed for grade 3 or higher
pneumonitis. Although not statistically significant, a slightly
higher likelihood of pneumonitis was also noted in patients in
phase 1 trials compared with phase 3 trials for all-grade pneu-
monitis (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.98-1.71; P = .07).
Some study heterogeneity was suggested by the assess-
ment of all-grade pneumonitis in the monotherapy data
(I2 = 49%), which appeared to be concentrated in the studies
of NSCLC (I2 = 69%). There was some evidence of publica-
tion bias for all-grade and grade 3 or higher pneumonitis in the
monotherapy data (all-grade: Begg test P = .003, Egger test
P = .003; grade ≥3: Begg test P = .004, Egger test P = .001) but
not in the combination data (all-grade: Begg test P = .83, Eg-
ger test P = .44; grade ≥3: Begg test P = .04, Egger test P = .70).
Funnel plots for the monotherapy data are shown to visually
demonstrate publication bias (eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in the
Supplement).
Discussion
In the present meta-analysis of the published clinical trial re-
sults of PD-1 inhibitor therapy for melanoma, NSCLC, and RCC,
the overall incidence of pneumonitis was 2.7% for mono-
therapy and 6.6% for combination therapy. The incidence was

significantly higher in patients with NSCLC and RCC than in
patients with melanoma. Combination therapy was associ-
ated with a higher incidence of all-grade and grade 3 or higher
pneumonitis compared with monotherapy. Pneumonitis-
related deaths were noted in 4 patients with NSCLC in the
monotherapy group and in 1 patient with melanoma in the
combination therapy group. To our knowledge, this is the first
meta-analysis report that focuses on PD-1 inhibitor–related
pneumonitis in patients with advanced cancer that com-
pared the incidence among different tumor types and treat-
ment regimens.
A higher incidence of pneumonitis among patients with
NSCLC may be because these patients are more prone to de-
velop drug-related lung toxic effects because of their expo-
sure to smoking and underlying lung conditions, including
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pulmonary
fibrosis.38-40 Existing tumor burden in the lung may also limit
the lung tolerance to exogenous stress and injury. A higher in-
cidenceamongpatientswithNSCLCforgrade3orhigherpneu-

underlying conditions and tumor burden in the lung can con-
tribute to more serious clinical consequences from lung in-
juryduringpneumonitis.Theincidenceforall-gradeandgrade
3 or higher pneumonitis remained significantly higher for
NSCLC compared with melanoma in the multivariable analy-
ses after controlling for agents and trial phases, adding fur-
ther strength of evidence for this observation. Pneumonitis-
related death in the monotherapy group was noted only in
patientswithNSCLC,againindicatingapotentiallyseriousout-
come of this adverse event, particularly in NSCLC. These re-
sults emphasize a need for increased awareness and careful
monitoring of patients with NSCLC during PD-1 inhibitor
therapy for the possibility of pneumonitis.
A significantly higher incidence of pneumonitis in
patients with RCC compared with patients with melanoma
was observed for all-grade pneumonitis but not for grade 3
or higher pneumonitis based on univariate and multivari-
able analyses. The underlying reasons for these observa-
tions remain to be further investigated; however, the results
again demonstrate the different susceptibilities of develop-
ing PD-1 inhibitor–related pneumonitis among patients with
different tumor types and varying effect on their clinical
course and outcome.
The incidence of pneumonitis was significantly higher
in the combination therapy group compared with the mono-
therapy group for all-grade and grade 3 or higher pneumoni-
tis among patients with melanoma, indicating the additive
effects of 2 agents on lung toxic effects. One death was
observed in the melanoma cohort treated with nivolumab
and ipilimumab, further indicating the serious consequence
of the event during combination therapy. Multivariable
analyses, including all 3 tumor types and controlling for
tumor types and trial phases, also demonstrated a higher
odds of experiencing pneumonitis among the combination
therapy group, further supporting the observation. When
the combination therapy group was further subdivided into
the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group and the nivolumab
plus peptide vaccine group, most observations remained
significant except that the odds of grade 3 or higher pneu-
monitis in the nivolumab plus peptide vaccine group were

not significant (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 0.83-10.0; P = .08). Ipili-
mumab is another immune-checkpoint inhibitor that acts
via the CTLA-4 pathway and is known to be associated with
a variety of IRAEs.9,10,41 Although less clinically apparent
and, therefore, less recognized compared with PD-1
inhibitor–related pneumonitis, ipilimumab-associated lung
toxic effects have been previously reported in trial and clini-
cal cohorts.9,42 Although the detailed role and effect of
ipilimumab and peptide vaccines on the development
and severity of pneumonitis when used in combination
with PD-1 inhibitors remain to be further investigated,
clinicians should be alerted to the significantly higher inci-
dence of pneumonitis during combination therapy and care-
fully monitor patients for possible signs and symptoms of
pneumonitis.
The incidence of pneumonitis was higher in the phase 2
trials than in the phase 3 trials for all-grade pneumonitis in
multivariable analyses. It is possible that the maturation of
the trial design based on the knowledge and experiences in
earlier-phase trials contribute to lowering the incidence of
pneumonitis by optimizing eligibility criteria and monitor-
ing plans.
Limitations of the present study include a relatively
small number of eligible studies for meta-analysis; however,
all published trial reports of PD-1 inhibitors at the time of
data collection have been included to capture the available
data in this newly emerging field. Some trials used different
doses or frequencies of administration of the therapeutic
agents; however, the cohorts were not subdivided according
to the dose or frequency because such subdivision will yield
more subgroups with smaller sample sizes and because the
details of the number of patients with pneumonitis in each
subgroup were not consistently available in the published
reports. In the data extraction process, the present study
only included the number of patients who were specifically
listed as experiencing pneumonitis, and other terms, such
as pneumonia or interstitial lung disease, were not included
as pneumonitis cases. The approach was chosen to focus on
the cases that are clearly noted as pneumonitis and to avoid
inclusion of other pulmonary conditions listed under
ambiguous terms without detailed description of the spe-
cific cases. This meta-analysis focused on the incidence of
pneumonitis as a consistently reported variable across dif-
ferent trials; other clinical variables that may be associated
with pneumonitis and the incidence of coexisting IRAEs
remain to be investigated because these investigations
require collection of the individual patient data from mul-
tiple trials.
The limitations of using meta-analytic techniques to
pool published summary data include concerns about miss-
ing studies, heterogeneity of included studies, and the use
of aggregated patient data, which can restrict the ability to
check for uniform definitions of outcome variables. In the
present study, publication bias was present in the mono-
therapy data, which was particularly concentrated in the
NSCLC studies. This finding suggests a need for some cau-
tion when interpreting the findings related to these groups
because the presence of publication bias may reflect under-
reporting of small, negative, or nonsignificant studies in the
published literature. Further investigations with a larger
number of studies in each tumor type and therapeutic regi-
men may help to validate the observations when more pub-
lished data become available.
The present study focused on PD-1 inhibitor–related pneu-
monitisduringtrialsofnivolumabandpembrolizumabanddid
not include other PD-1 inhibitors or PD-L1 inhibitors because
of the paucity of published data at the time of data collection
of this study. Likewise, the meta-analysis focused on mela-
noma, NSCLC, and RCC, and other tumor types, such as
lymphoma or ovarian cancer, were not included because of the
limited number of published reports with small sample sizes.
Three studies43-45 of the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab have
been recently published and have reported the efficacy and
safety profiles of the agent in NSCLC, RCC, and urothelial car-
cinoma. In a phase 2 study of NSCLC, the incidence of atezoli-
zumab-related pneumonitis was 3% (4 of 142 patients) for all-
grade and 0.7% (1 of 142) for grade 3 or higher pneumonitis.43
In a phase 1a study of RCC, the incidence of pneumonitis was
3% (2 of 70 patients) without occurrence of grade 3 or higher
pneumonitis.44 In a phase 2 study of urothelial carcinoma, the
incidence was 2% (7 of 310 patients) for all-grade and 1% (2 of
310) for grade 3 or higher pneumonitis.45 No pneumonitis-
related deaths were reported in these studies. Further stud-
ies are needed as more data become publicized to compare the
incidence of pneumonitis among different agents involved in
the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in a larger variety of tumors. The cur-
rent study has focused on the 2 PD-1 inhibitors that have been
grantedtheregulatoryapprovalsforthe3tumortypesandhave
been widely prescribed in the clinical setting to provide the
knowledge that is directly relevant to the current clinical
practice.
Conclusions
A higher incidence of PD-1 inhibitor–related pneumonitis was
noted in patients with NSCLC and RCC and in patients treated
with combination therapy. The motives of this meta-analysis
were to identify what is known based on the published data
and what remains unknown and thus needs to be investi-
gated going forward. In addition to the incidence of pneumo-
nitis across a larger variety of immune-checkpoint inhibitors
and tumor types, there remains a significant lack of knowl-
edgeofthisentityintermsofitsriskfactors,diagnosticworkup
strategy, and optimal management guidelines. We strongly be-
lieve that systematic investigations of a collection of indi-
vidual cases of PD-1 inhibitor–related pneumonitis from mul-
tiple studies across different institutions will significantly
contribute to characterize a full spectrum of clinical and ra-
diographic manifestations of this entity and will serve as the
first step to address these remaining clinically urgent ques-
tions. It is our sincere hope that the immune-oncology com-
munity accelerates its move toward data sharing from mul-
tiplestudiesandpromotesmultidisciplinaryeffortstowardthe
united goal of maximizing the benefits of cancer immuno-
therapy.
