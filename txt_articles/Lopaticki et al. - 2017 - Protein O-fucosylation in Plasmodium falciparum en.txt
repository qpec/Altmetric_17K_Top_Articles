O-glycosylation of the Plasmodium sporozoite surface proteins CSP and TRAP was recently
identified, but the role of this modification in the parasite life cycle and its relevance to
vaccine design remain unclear. Here, we identify the Plasmodium protein O-fucosyltransferase
(POFUT2) responsible for O-glycosylating CSP and TRAP. Genetic disruption of POFUT2 in
Plasmodium falciparum results in ookinetes that are attenuated for colonizing the mosquito
midgut, an essential step in malaria transmission. Some POFUT2-deficient parasites mature
into salivary gland sporozoites although they are impaired for gliding motility, cell traversal,
hepatocyte invasion, and production of exoerythrocytic forms in humanized chimeric liver
mice. These defects can be attributed to destabilization and incorrect trafficking of proteins
bearing thrombospondin repeats (TSRs). Therefore, POFUT2 plays a similar role in malaria
parasites to that in metazoans: it ensures the trafficking of Plasmodium TSR proteins as part of
a non-canonical glycosylation-dependent endoplasmic reticulum protein quality control
mechanism.

 P
lasmodium spp. lack many genes necessary for conventional
N- and O-glycosylation1, 2 and the N-glycan-dependent
protein
folding
quality
control
pathways
found
in
most eukaryotes3, 4. This has fuelled debate about whether these
protozoan parasites glycosylate their proteins1, 2,
5. Recent
advances have begun to resolve this issue6, 7. Blood stage
Plasmodium falciparum parasites, which cause the most severe
form of human malaria, N-glycosylate proteins with Asn-linked
N-acetylglucosamine or chitobiose6. While this minimalistic
N-glycan likely plays a thermodynamic role in protein folding8, it
remains unclear which parasite proteins are N-glycosylated and
whether it occurs in other stages of the Plasmodium lifecycle. In
contrast, O-glycosylation has only been detected outside of the
blood stages: the P. falciparum sporozoite antigens circumspor-
ozoite protein (CSP) and thrombospondin-related anonymous
protein (TRAP) both bear an O-linked hexosyl-deoxyhexose
disaccharide on their thrombospondin repeat (TSR) domains7.
CSP9 and TRAP10, 11 are essential for infection of the human
host and abundant on the sporozoite surface, making them prime
vaccine candidates. Indeed, the only malaria vaccine approved
to date RTS,S/A0112, is based on the CSP TSR domain. Simple
O-glycans can enhance antigenicity and comprise part of T-cell
epitopes13, making this parasite glycan of great relevance to the
design of next-generation malaria vaccines. However, before
pursuing this idea the precise chemical nature of the O-glycan
must be determined, as should its function in the malaria parasite.
The chemical identity of the P. falciparum O-glycan is most
likely the same as the O-linked β-D-glucosyl-1,3-α-L-fucose
disaccharide found on metazoan TSR domains14–16. In these
systems, O-glycosylation of the cysteine-rich TSR domain occurs
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) on correctly folded proteins
at the CXX(S/T)C sequon in a stepwise manner: protein
O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2)17 O-fucosylates Ser/Thr of the
protein
using
GDP-fucose,
then
β-1,3-glucosyltransferase
(B3GLCT)16 utilizes UDP-glucose to glucosylate the 3-OH of the
fucose residue (Supplementary Fig. 1)18. This process comprises
part of a non-canonical protein folding quality control mechan-
ism18. Ablation of POFUT2 or B3GLCT in mammals affects
folding and trafficking of proteins with TSR domains, though the
extent to which this occurs varies from protein to protein18–23.
POFUT2 disruption in mice has an embryonic lethal phenotype22
while
mutations
in
human
B3GLCT
cause
Peters-Plus
syndrome18. The identification of glycosylated TSR proteins in
P. falciparum suggests a similar protein quality control mechan-
ism is present in the malaria parasite, an idea supported by the
observation that heterologous expression of CSP24 and TRAP25
TSR domains in mammalian cell lines yield proteins modified
with the same β-D-glucosyl-1,3-α-L-fucose disaccharide.
Here,
we
identify
and
characterize
the
protein
O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) conserved in all Plasmodium
spp. Genetic disruption of POFUT2 in P. falciparum results in
attenuation
of
both
ookinete
and
sporozoite
infection
of
their respective mosquito and vertebrate hosts. The defects are
attributable to destabilization and incorrect trafficking of proteins
with TSRs. This suggests that POFUT2 plays an important role in
parasite transmission to mosquitoes and infection of the human
host by ensuring trafficking of TSR proteins following glycosy-
lation in the parasite ER.

 search of the P. falciparum genome using Homo sapiens POFUT2
(CAC24557.1)26 as a search term led to the identification
of PF3D7_0909200 as the putative malarial POFUT2 enzyme.
Highly homologous syntenic orthologs were present across
the Plasmodium genus (Supplementary Fig. 2). The putative
P. falciparum and P. vivax (PVX_098900.1) POFUT2 share
considerable
sequence
similarity
with
H.
sapiens
and
Caenorhabditis elegans (NP_001255070.1) POFUT2 and retain
the catalytic residues of these enzymes (Supplementary Fig. 3).
A
homology
model
constructed
from
the
P.
falciparum
POFUT2 sequence has a very similar predicted structure to
H. sapiens and C. elegans POFUT2 (Supplementary Fig. 4A),
sufficient to allow the GDP-fucose and TSR domain substrates to
be docked into the model to reveal an alignment of catalytic
residues and substrates that is reminiscent of a Michaelis complex
(Supplementary Fig. 4B, C)26, 27.
We sought to recombinantly express putative POFUT2 and
TSR domains from the Plasmodium genus to demonstrate
enzymatic activity in vitro and support the notion that the
deoxyhexose observed previously by MS on P. falciparum CSP
and TRAP7 is in fact L-fucose and is localized on the threonine of
the CXXTC sequon. All attempts to express P. falciparum and
P. vivax POFUT2 in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris were
unsuccessful. Recombinant P. vivax POFUT2 was obtained by
secretion as a SUMO fusion protein from Sf21 insect cells using a
baculovirus expression system (Supplementary Fig. 5), though
this strategy failed for P. falciparum POFUT2. The TSR domains
of P. falciparum TRAP and CSP were expressed in E. coli as a
GST fusion protein and the GST tags removed using HRV C3
protease (Supplementary Fig. 5). Recombinant P. vivax POFUT2
and GDP-fucose were incubated with each TSR domain (Fig. 1a)
and analyzed by intact electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS) to reveal a mass shift of + 146 for both TRAP (Fig. 1b)
and CSP (Fig. 1c), indicating the addition of a single L-fucose to
the proteins. This mass shift was not observed in the absence of P.
vivax POFUT2. LC-MS/MS analysis of GluC-digested samples of
the
O-fucosylated
TRAP
enabled
the
localization
of
this
glycosylation to the threonine residue of the CXXTC motif
(Supplementary
Fig.
6).
This
confirmed
that
Plasmodium
parasites possess a conserved syntenic POFUT2 capable of O-
fucosylating TSR domains on the canonical serine/threonine
residue of the CXX(S/T)C motif.
We proceeded to inspect the sequence of every P. falciparum
protein with a TSR domain for this O-fucosylation sequon
(Fig. 1d) to and found that, in addition to CSP and TRAP,
potential POFUT2 substrates include: circumsporozoite- and
TRAP-related protein (CTRP), expressed in ookinetes28, 29, as
well as TRAP-like protein (TLP)30, thrombospondin-related
sporozoite protein (TRSP)31 and thrombospondin-related protein
1 (TRP1)32 from the sporozoite stages. No blood stage proteins
with a TSR domain possessed the consensus site, suggesting that
O-fucosylation was not important to this stage of the parasite’s
life cycle.
Plasmodium POFUT2 localizes to the ER. To identify the
subcellular location of POFUT2 in P. falciparum, transgenic
NF54 parasites were produced in which the POFUT2 gene
encoded triple hemagglutinin (HA) epitopes in-frame at the
C-terminus such that expression was still driven by the

 endogenous promoter (Supplementary Fig. 7A). Integration
of the HA epitope cassette was validated by Southern blot
(Supplementary Fig. 7B) and POFUT2-HA expression confirmed
by immunoblot using anti-HA antibodies. POFUT2-HA migrated
as a single species of circa 60 kDa in asexual parasites, consistent
with a predicted mass of 59 kDa (Supplementary Fig. 7C).
Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed puncta of POFUT2-
HA expression that co-localized with plasmepsin V33, consistent
with an ER localization in P. falciparum (Supplementary Fig. 7D).
The punctate distribution pattern within the ER suggests that
POFUT2-HA localizes within sub-domains of the ER, the pre-
sence of which has been described previously34. Detection of
POFUT2 expression in asexual parasites is consistent with reports
that GDP-fucose is biosynthesized in blood stage P. falciparum
parasites35, though it does not appear to be essential36. It is
unclear what, if any, protein(s) might be O-fucosylated by
POFUT2 in the blood stage (Fig. 1d).
Generation of POFUT2-deficient P. falciparum. To study the
function of POFUT2 in P. falciparum, isogenic NF54 parasites
were generated in which the POFUT2 locus was excised by double
cross over homologous recombination (Supplementary Fig. 8A).
Two independent clones of ΔPOFUT2 parasites (D3 and G8)
were generated by limiting dilution and validated by Southern
blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. 8B). Both mutant clones
developed within erythrocytes at the same rate as NF54 parasites,
indicating that POFUT2 is not essential for asexual blood stage
growth (Supplementary Fig. 8C), in agreement with GDP-fucose
being dispensable36 and the absence of predicted substrates in this
stage (Fig. 1d). The ΔPOFUT2 parasites were differentiated into
gametocytes and no significant difference in stage V gametocy-
temias were observed compared to NF54, demonstrating that
POFUT2 is not essential for gametocytogenesis (Supplementary
Fig. 8D).
POFUT2 facilitates P. falciparum infection of the mosquito. To
examine the function of POFUT2 in other P. falciparum lifecycle
stages, mature gametocytes were fed to female Anopheles
stephensi mosquitoes by membrane feeding. Parasite load and
differentiation within the mosquito was determined by real-time
quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) of infected
midguts 27 h post-bloodmeal. Quantification of Pf18S transcripts
revealed that total parasite load in the mosquitoes did not differ
between NF54 and ΔPOFUT2 parasites (Fig. 2a). Pfs25 tran-
scripts, which are produced by gametes, zygotes and ookinetes37
and CTRP transcripts, which are expressed in ookinetes28, were
also statistically equal between parasite strains. This implies that
POFUT2 is not essential for formation of ookinetes within the
mosquito. However, the number of oocysts developing at the
basal

 (ANOVA)) (Fig. 2b). This indicates that POFUT2 is required
for normal infection of the mosquito vector by P. falciparum
ookinetes. The sole predicted TSR protein expressed in ookinetes
is CTRP (Fig. 1d), which is essential for ookinete motility
and invasion of the midgut28, 29. Our results are, therefore,
consistent with perturbed glycosylation and function of CTRP,
resulting in defective midgut invasion. P. falciparum ookinetes
could not be successfully cultured in vitro to confirm this by
proteomic analysis.
POFUT2 supports P. falciparum sporozoite infectivity and
fitness. To investigate the function of POFUT2 in sporozoites,
parasites were propagated through mosquitoes and dissected
from salivary glands. Mosquitoes infected with ΔPOFUT2 para-
sites harboured 45–55% fewer sporozoites in their salivary glands,
depending on the clone, than mosquitoes infected with the NF54
parental line (P = 0.0160 using the Kruskal–Wallis one-way
ANOVA; Fig. 2c). Since ΔPOFUT2 parasites produce fewer
oocysts, this result was expected. When standardizing for oocysts,
the number of salivary gland sporozoites was not different
(Fig. 2d), suggesting that POFUT2 function may not be critical
for P. falciparum maturation in oocysts or salivary gland invasion.
Next, we assessed whether sporozoites in the salivary glands were
infectious. Cell traversal activity is required for liver infection and
was measured by incubation of sporozoites with human HC-04
hepatocytes in the presence of FITC-dextran and quantifying
dextran-positive cells38, 39. ΔPOFUT2 parasites were reduced
for cell traversal by 30–42%, depending on the mutant clone
(P < 0.0001
using
the
Kruskal–Wallis
one-way
ANOVA)
(Fig. 3a). The ability for sporozoites to invade hepatocytes, which
is critical for liver infection, was investigated by quantifying the

 number of parasites inside HC-04 hepatocytes 24 h post-addition
of sporozoites to cells. This revealed a strong defect in the number
of
intracellular
ΔPOFUT2
parasites
(P = 0.0145
using
the
Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA) (Fig. 3b), consistent with a
defect in invasion into the cells. To examine the effect of POFUT2
activity on parasite fitness in vivo, coinfection experiments were
performed in which an equal inoculum of NF54 and mutant
sporozoites was mixed and injected intravenously into humanized
chimeric liver mice40. Loss of POFUT2 function resulted in a
severe
fitness
cost,
as
demonstrated
by
an
approximate
80% reduction in parasite liver load compared to NF54 parents
(P = 0.0155 using the paired t-test; Fig. 3c). Therefore, POFUT2
activity is important for liver infection by P. falciparum
sporozoites.
Gliding locomotion is obligatory for infectivity of sporo-
zoites10, 41. We, therefore, assessed whether POFUT2 plays a role
in gliding motility by measuring sporozoite trails on a solid
substrate42. Loss of POFUT2 function caused a reduction in
gliding motility, reflected by an increase in non-motile spor-
ozoites (Fig. 3d) and concomitant decrease in the number of trail
circles produced by ΔPOFUT2 sporozoites that could glide
(Fig.
3e)
(P < 0.0001
using
the
Kruskal–Wallis
one-way
ANOVA). Therefore, POFUT2 is required for normal gliding
motility in P. falciparum, which provides a mechanistic explana-
tion for why mutant sporozoites were less infective in vitro and
less fit in vivo.
POFUT2 assists stabilization and trafficking of TSR proteins.
Given the important function of POFUT2 in protein quality
control in metazoans18, we examined whether proteins were
destabilized or trafficked differently following loss of POFUT2
activity. Since the two TSR proteins reported to be O-fucosylated
in sporozoites are CSP and TRAP7, we investigated these two
proteins by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies
directed to these proteins (Fig. 4a). While we observed no
decrease in CSP pixel intensity between NF54 and ΔPOFUT2
sporozoites, the total TRAP pixel intensity was dramatically
reduced in POFUT2-deficient sporozoites (P < 0.0001 using
the Mann–Whitney test) (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the intensity
of TRAP pixels at the sporozoite membrane was also significantly
reduced
in
ΔPOFUT2
parasites
(P < 0.0001
using
the
Mann–Whitney test) and TRAP was commonly observed inside
parasites, indicating that trafficking to the sporozoite membrane
was impaired by loss of POFUT2 function (P < 0.0001 using
the Mann–Whitney test) (Fig. 4c). Analysis of protein expression

 (P = 0.0250) but not CSP (P = 0.3571) (P-values were determined
using the Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA) were reduced in
ΔPOFUT2 sporozoites (Fig. 5a, b). To confirm that the difference
was due to protein destabilization rather than decreased gene
expression, qRT-PCR was performed on sporozoites. This
demonstrated no significant difference in the relative abundance
of PfTRAP or PfCSP messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts
between NF54 and ΔPOFUT2 sporozoites (Fig. 5c). Therefore,
POFUT2 activity is required for the stabilization and trafficking
of some TSR proteins in P. falciparum, although TRAP is more
dependent than CSP on O-fucosylation for stabilization and
trafficking (Fig. 5). This may be because the TSR domain of CSP
possesses just two disulfides, while that of the TRAP domain
contains three and is likely more susceptible to misfolding
and subsequent degradation due to erroneous disulfide bond
formation.
Discussion
The recent discovery of O-glycosylation on CSP and TRAP in
P. falciparum sporozoites represents a very important advance
in our understanding of Plasmodium glycobiology7 and comple-
ments recent work on the biosynthesis of sugar nucleotides
in P. falciparum35, 36. We have significantly built on these
findings by identifying the ER-resident enzyme responsible for
O-glycosylation in P. falciparum and confirming that POFUT2 is
a fucosyltransferase that modifies parasite TSR domains specifi-
cally with L-fucose at the conserved serine/threonine residue
within the CXX(S/T)C sequon. Our study also demonstrates that
this enzyme plays an important role in stabilizing TRAP in
sporozoites and possibly other TSR proteins, such as CTRP in
ookinetes, to ensure successful infection of the mosquito vector
and human liver cells.
It is not clear why POFUT2 and GDP-fucose are produced in
the blood stages of P. falciparum. While MTRAP, SPATR, and
PTRAMP are expressed in asexual stages and contain TSRs, they
lack the critical CXXS/TC O-fucosylation sequon suggesting they
are not fucosylated. Nonetheless, our study indicates that
POFUT2 is not essential for parasite growth in the asexual or
sexual blood stages. This is supported by recent studies showing
that disruption of genes involved in GDP-fucose biosynthesis,
GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and GDP-L-fucose synthase, had
no impact on asexual or sexual development36 and are also
expressed in mosquito stages43, 44.
Conversely, O-fucosylation is important in parasite stages that
develop within the mosquito. Our analyses of infected mosquitoes
suggest that O-fucosylation is not essential for P. falciparum
differentiation into ookinetes but the formation of fewer oocysts
implies it is important for ookinete infection of mosquito midgut
epithelial cells. An obvious role for POFUT2 in ookinetes is the
O-fucosylation of five of the seven TSR domains of the essential
motility-associated adhesin CTRP (Fig. 1d)28, 29. Given that
POFUT2 proteins play a key role in protein quality control and
trafficking in metazoans18, it is tempting to speculate that CTRP
is reliant on POFUT2 for stabilization and trafficking. A dearth of
appropriate antibodies and methods for the production of large
quantities of P. falciparum ookinetes has prevented us from
experimentally confirming this hypothesis, which might be better
examined in a P. berghei system using in vitro ookinete culture45.
POFUT2-deficient parasites produced oocysts, albeit less than
wild type, and this provided the opportunity to study sporozoites.
POFUT2 mutants produced fewer salivary gland sporozoites
within the mosquito than their NF54 parents, as expected based
on the formation of fewer oocysts. When the number of salivary
gland sporozoites was standardized for oocysts, no defect was
observed suggesting the levels of CSP, TRP1, and TRAP
remaining in ΔPOFUT2 sporozoites was sufficient to allow their
important functions in sporulation, oocyst egress and salivary
gland invasion9, 10, 32, 46. Indeed, our analysis of protein levels in
sporozoites showed that TSR proteins are impacted differently by
the loss of POFUT2 function, which is reminiscent of observa-
tions made in metazoans, where some proteins are impacted
far more than others18. We could not demonstrate statistically
significantly destabilization of CSP but TRAP was substantially
destabilized by loss of POFUT2 activity, though not fully
degraded. Given the essential roles of CSP in so many aspects of
sporozoite biology, it is plausible that its TSR domain (with only
two disulphide bonds) has evolved to be more stable than the
TRAP TSR domain (with its three disulphide bonds) and classical
TSR topology25.
Our study has also shown that POFUT2 function extends to
sporozoite interactions with human hepatocytes both in vitro
and in humanized mice with chimeric livers and is therefore
implicated in P. falciparum transmission to humans. ΔPOFUT2
sporozoites were defective for cell traversal activity, invasion of
human hepatocytes and for fitness of sporozoites in vivo. These
phenotypes can be attributed to functional destabilization of
TRAP and CSP but may also include other TSR proteins that
mediate sporozoite motility and invasion of hepatocytes, such as
TLP and TRSP, respectively10, 30, 31, 47. Our observations of
reduced
gliding
motility
of
POFUT2-deficient
sporozoites
strongly support this hypothesis. Further study is needed to verify
that these other TSR proteins are O-glycosylated and reliant on
POFUT2 for correct folding and trafficking.
The discovery of O-glycosylation in Plasmodium parasites is an
important advance in our understanding of parasite biology and
the significant defects we describe illustrate the relevance of this
modification to propagation of the parasite through its lifecycle.
Loss of POFUT2 function abrogated protein stabilization and
impaired protein trafficking, impacting on both the transmission
of ookinetes to mosquitoes and the infectivity of sporozoites. This
demonstrates that the ER protein glycosylation process in malaria
parasites confers a significant survival advantage and is important
for malaria transmission. It appears unlikely that O-fucosylation
is dispensable to parasites, and so incorporation of these glycans
into vaccines based on CSP, TRAP, CTRP, and possibly other
TSR proteins are well worth investigating. The production of such
antigens should be relatively straight forward, since mammalian
glycosyltransferases can recognize and modify heterologously
expressed Plasmodium TSR domains24, 25.
Methods
POFUT2 enzyme assay. Details of recombinant protein expression are provided
in the Supplementary Methods. Reactions (10 μl total volume) containing recom-
binant P. falciparum TRAP TSR (10 μM), recombinant P. vivax POFUT2 (10 ng),
GDP-Fuc (50 μM), MgCl2 (5 mM) in buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4)
were incubated for 16 h at 25 °C. Negative controls included reactions without
P. vivax POFUT2. Samples were snap-frozen and stored at –80 °C until analysis by
mass spectrometry, as detailed in the Supplementary Methods.
Parasite maintenance. P. falciparum NF54 asexual stages were maintained in
human type O-positive erythrocytes (Melbourne Red Cross) in RPMI-HEPES
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated human serum (Melbourne Red Cross),
at 37 °C. Gametocytes for transmission to mosquitoes were generated using the
“crash” method48 using daily media changes.
Transgenic parasites. P. falciparum NF54 (kindly provided by the Walter Reid
Army Institute of Research) was used to generate all transgenic parasites. Details
for cloning, transfection, selection, and validation of transgenic lines are provided
in the Supplementary Methods.
Blood stage growth assay. Synchronized trophozoite stage parasites were added
to erythrocytes to 0.2% parasitemia, 1% hematocrit. Starting parasitemia was
confirmed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD) using ethidium bromide staining
(1:1000 dilution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS))33 and final parasitemia was

 determined 96 h later. For each line, triplicate samples of 50,000 cells were counted
in each of three independent experiments. Growth was expressed as a percentage of
NF54.
Mosquito infection and analysis of parasite development. Five- to seven-day
old female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes (this strain originally provided by M.
Jacobs-Lorena, Johns Hopkins University) were fed on asynchronous gametocytes,
diluted to 0.3–0.6 % stage V gametocytemia, via water-jacketed glass membrane
feeders. Mosquitoes were sugar starved for 2 days post-bloodmeal to enhance the
population for blood-fed mosquitoes. Surviving mosquitoes were provided
5% glucose ad libitum via paper/cotton wicks or water wicks and sugar cubes.
Oocyst numbers were obtained from midguts dissected from cold-anesthetized
and ethanol-killed mosquitoes 7 days post-bloodmeal and stained with 0.1%
mercurochrome. Salivary glands were dissected from mosquitoes (day 16–20 post-
bloodmeal), crushed using pestle and then glass wool filtered to obtain sporozoites
used in subsequent assays. Mosquito bloodmeal bolus were isolated 27 h post-feed
from mosquitoes to check for the presence of ookinetes via qRT-PCR (see Sup-
plementary Table 1). Briefly, mosquitoes were cold anesthetized and ethanol killed.
Midguts were carefully dissected and frozen immediately on dry ice. RNA was
purified using TRI Reagent (Sigma) and complementary DNA (cDNA) prepared
using a SensiFast cDNA synthesis kit (Bioline) according to the manufacturers’
instructions and qRT-PCR performed using a LightCycler 480 (Roche). All
oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
Immunofluorescence microscopy. Asexual stages were fixed in ice-cold methanol
and probed with rat anti-HA (1:500; Roche 3F10) and rabbit anti-plasmepsin V
(PMV) (1:1000) antibodies33 in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/PBS. Salivary
gland sporozoites were air-dried on slides, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
permeabilized in 0.1% triton X-100. Primary antibodies (mouse monoclonal anti-
CSP (2A10); 1:200049) (rabbit anti-TRAP 1:50050) were diluted in 3% BSA/PBS.
Secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit 594 and anti-mouse or -rat Alexa 488
(1:1000; Invitrogen).Micrographs were acquired on a Deltavision Elite microscope
(Applied Precision) using an Olympus 100Å~/1.42 PlanApoN objective equipped
with a Coolsnap HQ2 CCD camera as Z-stacks. Images were deconvolved and
presented as maximum intensity projections. For quantification of mean pixel
intensity, Z-stacks of n ≥ 30 sporozoites per condition per experiment were cap-
tured using the same exposure settings on the Deltavision system to allow quan-
titative analysis between different samples. The analysis was performed with a
custom FIJI macro. The sporozoite was segmented by filtering and thresholding the
sum of all three fluorescence channels, and the membrane area determined by
stepping in from the edge of the filtered segmented parasite by three pixels. Mean
pixel intensity measurements for TRAP and CSP were performed on each of these
regions in the 488 and 594 channels, respectively, and statistically compared in
duplicate independent experiments.
Sporozoite gene expression analysis. Sporozoites were dissected from salivary
glands on day 17 or 18 post-blood meal. RNA was purified using TRI Reagent
(Sigma) and cDNA prepared using a SensiFast cDNA synthesis kit (Bioline)
according to the manufacturers’ instructions and qRT-PCR performed using a
LightCycler 480 (Roche) with oligonucleotides in Supplemetary Table 1.
Immunoblotting. Proteins were separated through 4–12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide
gels (Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with primary
antibodies: rat anti-HA 1:500 (Roche 3F10), mouse monoclonal anti-CSP (2A10)
1:900049, rabbit anti-TRAP 1:2000;50 rabbit anti-PLP1 (1:200)39, rabbit
anti-Aldolase (1:4000)51 followed by horse radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies (1:1000 (mouse) and 1:4000 (rabbit); Cell Signaling Technology) and
viewed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham).
Hepatocyte culturing. HC-04 hepatocytes52 were maintained on Iscove’s Modified
Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM), supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were split 1:6 every 2–3 days once they
reached ~90% confluency.
Cell traversal assay. Cell traversal was measured using a cell-wounding
assay39, 53. HC-04 hepatocytes (5 × 104) were seeded into each well of a 48-well
plate (Corning, Sigma Aldrich) coated with rat tail collagen. After 24 h, wells were
seeded with 5 × 104 sporozoites for 2.5 h in the presence of 1 mg ml−1 FITC-labeled
dextran (10,000 MW, Sigma Aldrich). Cells were trypsinized to obtain a single cell
suspension for FACS analyses. For each condition, triplicate samples of 10,000 cells
were counted by FACS in each of the three independent experiments.
Hepatocyte invasion assay. HC-04 cells (5 × 104) were seeded onto rat tail
collagen-coated coverslips in 24-well plates using Dulbecco's modified Eagle
medium without glucose (Life Technologies, 11966-025), supplemented with 1 mM
sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, 11360-070); 1% FBS (Cellgro,35-010-CV);
1 × Pen/Strep (Corning, 30-001-Cl); 1 × MEM non-essential amino acids without
L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, M5550); and 1:500 dilution of Lipid Mixture 1,
Chemically Defined (Sigma-Aldrich, L0-288)39, 54. Sporozoites (5 × 104) were
added to the cells 12 h later and incubated for 24 h. Media was replaced after 3 h
and the assay continued on for a further 21 h (to give an invasion assay of 24 h).
Coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT and then processed
as described54. Sporozoites were detected by immunofluorescence staining using
mouse monoclonal antibodies against CSP (1:2000), anti-mouse Alexa-488
(1:1000), and anti-mouse Alexa 594 (1:1000). Multiple images were taken at
200 × magnification (Axio observer). A minimum of 270 fields with approximately
10,000 HC-04 cells were counted and the percentage of cells with intracellular
sporozoites was calculated from this data set. For each condition, duplicate samples
were manually counted in each of two independent experiments.
Sporozoite gliding assay. Gliding assays were performed as described pre-
viously40, 42 with some minor exceptions. Eight-well chamber slides (Thermo
Fisher Scientific 154534) were coated with CSP antibodies (1:1000 in PBS). Twenty
thousand salivary gland sporozoites were seeded into each well and allowed to glide
for 60 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in IMDM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
human serum. Samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C for 20 min.
Primary anti-PfCSP was applied followed by goat anti-mouse Alexa 488 at
(both antibodies were 1:1000 in 3% BSA). Sporozoites and trails were viewed on a
Deltavision Elite microscope (Applied Precision) using an Olympus 163x/1.42
PlanApoN objective equipped with a Coolsnap HQ2 CCD camera. A total range of
220 (NF54) to 840 (ΔPOFUT2) sporozoites were counted for each condition across
two independent experiments.
Humanized mice production, infection, and processing. uPA + / + -SCID mice
(University of Alberta) were housed in a virus- and antigen-free facility supported
by the Health Sciences Laboratory Animal Services at the University of Alberta and
cared for in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. All
protocols involving mice were reviewed and approved by the University of Alberta
Health Sciences Animal Welfare Committee and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute
of Medical Research Animal Ethics Committee. uPA + / + -SCID mice at 5–14 days
old (2 male, 1 female) received 106 human hepatocytes (cryopreserved human
hepatocytes were obtained from BioreclamationIVT—Baltimore MD) by
intrasplenic injection and engraftment was confirmed 8 weeks post-transplantation
by analysis of serum human albumin39, 55. An inoculum of 4.0 × 105 P. falciparum
NF54 sporozoites and 4.0 × 105 ΔPOFUT2 G8 sporozoites freshly isolated from
mosquito salivary glands were mixed and injected by intravenous tail injection into
each of three humanized mice, as previously described40. Livers were obtained
6 days post-infection from CO2-ethanized mice and individual lobes were cut as
described56, pooled and emulsified into a single cell suspension and flash frozen in
liquid nitrogen for subsequent genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction.
Measuring exoerythrocytic development in humanized mice. To quantify
parasite load in the chimeric livers, gDNA was isolated from the single cell liver
suspensions and Taqman probe-based qPCRs were performed as previously
described39, 56, 57. To specifically differentiate NF54 from ΔPOFUT2 genomes from
the same mouse samples, the following oligonucleotides were used. For NF54
genomes: POFUT2hm_F and POFUT2hm_R, which bind internal to the POFUT2
gene in NF54 but do not amplify a product using ΔPOFUT2 parasites. For
ΔPOFUT2 genomes: hDHFRhm_F and hDHFRhm_R, which bind in the hDHFR
cassette in ΔPOFUT2 parasites but do not amplify a product using NF54. Human
and mouse genomes were quantified using oligonucleotides specific for pros-
taglandin E receptor 2 (PTGER2) from each species, as described previously57.
Sequences of primers used are provided in Supplementary Table 1. All probes were
labeled 5′ with the fluorophore 6-carboxy-fluorescein (FAM) and contain a double-
quencher that includes an internal ZEN™ quencher and a 3′ Iowa Black® quencher
from IDT. The following probes were used:
POFUT2 5′FAM AATGTTAAT/ZEN/AGGTTCAAACAATTTTG-3IABkFQ,
hDHFR FAM/TAAACTGCA/ZEN/TCGTCGCTGTG/3IABkFQ,
hPTGER2 FAM/TGCTGCTTC/ZEN/TCATTGTCTCG/3IABkFQ,
mPTGER2 FAM/CCTGCTGCT/ZEN/TATCGTGGCTG/3IABkFQ.
Standard curves were prepared by titration from a defined number of DNA
copies for P. falciparum NF54, ΔPOFUT2, human and mouse controls. PCRs were
performed on a Roche LC80 using LightCycler 480 Probe Master (Roche).
Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using the Kruskal–Wallis one-way
ANOVA to compare two mutant clones to NF54 throughout this study. The
Mann–Whitney test was used to compare one mutant clone to NF54 (sporozoite
pixel analyses) and the paired t-test was employed to evaluate fitness of one mutant
clone versus NF54 in each of three humanized mice. Analyses were performed
using Graphpad Prism 6.
Ethics statement. All experimental protocols involving humanized mice were
conducted in strict accordance with the recommendations in the National State-
ment on Ethical Conduct in Animal Research of the National Health and Medical
Research Council and were reviewed and approved by the Walter and Eliza Hall
Institute of Medical Research Animal Ethics Committee (AEC2014.030). All
