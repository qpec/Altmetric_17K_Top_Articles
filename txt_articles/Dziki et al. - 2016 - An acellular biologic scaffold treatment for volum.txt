Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is a severe and debilitating clinical problem. Current standard of care includes physical therapy or
orthotics, which do not correct underlying strength deficits, and surgical tendon transfers or muscle transfers, which involve donor
site morbidity and fall short of restoring function. The results of a 13-patient cohort study are described herein and involve a
regenerative medicine approach for VML treatment. Acellular bioscaffolds composed of mammalian extracellular matrix (ECM) were
implanted and combined with aggressive and early physical therapy following treatment. Immunolabeling of ultrasound-guided
biopsies, and magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography imaging were performed to analyse the presence of stem/
progenitor cells and formation of new skeletal muscle. Force production, range-of-motion and functional task performance were
analysed by physical therapists. Electrodiagnostic evaluation was used to analyse presence of innervated skeletal muscle. This study
is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT01292876. In vivo remodelling of ECM bioscaffolds was associated with
mobilisation of perivascular stem cells; formation of new, vascularised, innervated islands of skeletal muscle within the implantation
site; increased force production; and improved functional task performance when compared with pre-operative performance.
Compared with pre-operative performance, by 6 months after ECM implantation, patients showed an average improvement of
37.3% (Po0.05) in strength and 27.1% improvement in range-of-motion tasks (Po0.05). Implantation of acellular bioscaffolds
derived from ECM can improve strength and function, and promotes site-appropriate remodelling of VML defects. These findings
provide early evidence of bioscaffolding as a viable treatment of VML.

INTRODUCTION
Volumetric muscle loss (VML) as a result of tumour ablation,
trauma or disease remains a challenging clinical problem for
which therapeutic options are limited. Current noninvasive
treatment for VML includes maximising strength of remaining
muscle and bracing. Unfortunately, this approach cannot make up
for the lost strength associated with VML. Muscle transposition or
tendon transfer can replace muscle function, but have less than
satisfactory success rates.1–4 Such procedures typically involve
significant donor site morbidity and fail to provide efficient
reconstruction or functional re-innervation of the lost muscle
tissue. These approaches often result in persistent strength and
functional deficits, which contribute to disability, weakness and
compromised quality of life for patients with VML.
Skeletal muscle retains a limited capacity to regenerate
following a severe acute injury. The regenerative process is
dependent on resident progenitor cell populations, including
satellite cells and myoblasts, which have the potential to
proliferate and differentiate into functional myofibers. Cell-based
regenerative medicine strategies have attempted to augment this
regenerative process through the delivery of exogenous (typically
autologous)
stem/progenitor
cells
to
the
VML
defect
site.
Utilisation of enriched muscle-derived stem cells, capable of
long-term proliferation and myogenic potential, has been some-
what successful and has been shown to increase the regenerative
index when injected into sites of skeletal muscle injury.5–7 Such
approaches are limited, however, by issues of low cell viability,8
poor
cell
migration
and
engraftment,
and
the
need
for
immunosuppressive therapy, among others.9,10 In fact, immuno-
suppressive
therapy
can
further
contribute
to
myoblast
apoptosis.11 Even if an ideal cell source and an effective delivery
method are utilised, transplanted cells are often associated with
less than optimal proliferative and differentiation potential within
the host injury site.12 Cell-centric strategies are also associated
with high cost due to the need for ex vivo cell expansion and
manipulation. While some cell-based approaches have shown
promise in preclinical studies, regulatory challenges and a lack of
notable efficacy have prevented their widespread adoption of
treatment for VML.13
We recently described an acellular bioscaffold approach for
treatment of VML in five patients that showed encouraging
results.14 This approach involved the use of extracellular matrix
(ECM) derived from decellularized porcine urinary bladder to
promote scaffold-associated skeletal muscle tissue formation and
partial restoration of function. ECM bioscaffold implantation was
also associated with the recruitment of endogenous perivascular

 stem cells (PVSCs). While ECM bioscaffolds have been used in
reconstructive surgery, they are typically employed only as a
barrier or reinforcing layer of soft tissue. In our prior report,14 we
provided evidence for functional remodelling of the ECM scaffold
with formation of new muscle tissue. An aggressive early post-
operative rehabilitation protocol was a component of this strategy
to place dynamic strain on the ECM and contribute to site-
appropriate differentiation of the recruited stem/progenitor cells.
The mechanism(s) of action responsible for ECM bioscaffold-
mediated VML repair are partially understood and include host
cell-mediated scaffold degradation and recruitment of endogen-
ous progenitor cells.14–17 The recruitment of neurogenic cells and
modulation of the innate immune response are also considered as
common features associated with ECM-mediated constructive
remodelling in preclinical studies.18–20 Overall, ECM bioscaffolds
have been shown to stimulate endogenous repair.21
The present manuscript describes the results from the first 13
patients
treated
using
the
acellular
bioscaffold
approach,
including results from the first 5 patients previously reported.14
The results reported herein advance the previously reported
findings in several respects: first, it expands the number of
patients and the anatomic sites of VML subjected to treatment;
second, it includes the use of three different source tissues of
ECM bioscaffolds; third, it includes the investigation of neuro-
genic cells as a component of the functional remodelling
process; and finally, it includes electrodiagnostic evaluation of
the remodelled muscle tissue.
RESULTS
Biologic scaffold implantation for the treatment of VML is
associated with increased skeletal muscle force production
Thirteen subjects with VML were enroled in this cohort study and
the average tissue deficit for all patients was 66.2%, when
compared with the contralateral limb (Table 1). All subjects met
established inclusion criteria (Supplementary Table S1) and had
received standard of care options, including surgical intervention
and/or physical therapy. Strength testing showed that 7 of
13 patients had improvement from their pre-surgical maximum
strength as early as 6–8 weeks after surgery, by an average of
15.2% ± 12.6 with a maximum of 127.9% and a minimum of
− 33.3% (Table 2). By 10–12 weeks, patients showed an average
change of 21.1% ± 12.2 with a maximum of 149.2% and a
minimum of − 33.0%. At 24–28 weeks, patients showed an
average force production change of 37.3% ± 12.4 with a significant
improvement when compared with pre-operative measurements
(Po0.05), with a maximum of 136.1% and a minimum of − 17.88%
Biologic scaffolds for VML treatment are associated with improved
range-of-motion and functional outcomes
Tasks to assess range-of-motion were performed and data is
reported for all patients who showed range-of-motion deficits pre-
operatively. At 6–8 weeks post surgery, all tested subjects showed
improvement in at least one range-of-motion task with an average
change of 16.7% ± 4.9. At 10–12 weeks, average range-of-motion
change compared with pre-operative measures was significantly
increased
(Po0.05)
at
24.0% ± 6.8.
By
24–28
weeks
after
surgery, this improvement increased to 27.1%+10.5 (Po0.05)
(Supplementary Table S3).
At 6–8 weeks post surgery, 10 out of 13 patients showed a
⩾ 20% improvement in performance of at least one functional
task when compared with pre-surgical performance (range,
20–1980%). By 10–12 weeks, 12 of 13 patients showed a ⩾ 20%
improvement (range, 20–2460%), and by 24–28 weeks 9 of 13
patients showed a ⩾ 20% improvement (range 25–1,820%).
Patient 3 showed particularly notable improvement in the
single-leg hop test, improving by 1,980%, 2,460% and 1,820% at
6–8,
10–12
and
24–28
weeks
after
surgery,
respectively
(Supplementary Table S2). Patient 5 showed a dramatic increase
in single-leg jump landing distance, improving by 400%, 783.3%
and 1,050% at 6–8, 10–12 and 24–28 weeks after surgery,
respectively (Supplementary Table S2). Likewise, patient 8 showed
improvements in the single-leg step down task of 200, 900 and
1,600% (Figure 1). Twelve of 13 patients showed improvement in
at least 1 functional task by 24–28 weeks after surgery.

Tissue
biopsies
of the

were
obtained at 6–8 weeks, 10–12 weeks and 24–28 weeks post
surgery, and showed a robust mononuclear cellular infiltration
into the bioscaffold site along with evidence of muscle formation
as early as 6–8 weeks post surgery (Figure 2a), which was
increased at each subsequent biopsy time point. Immunolabeling
studies showed CD146+NG2+ PVSCs localised around vWF+
vessels at all time points (Figure 2g–i). PVSCs were also found
removed from their normal anatomic location, suggesting their
potential contribution to skeletal muscle formation (Figure 3j–l).
Desmin+ cells with central nuclei were present as early as
6–8 weeks post surgery (Figure 2d–f) with striated desmin+
muscle fibres present in all biopsy samples at both 10–12 and
24–28 weeks after surgery (Figure 2e,f). These desmin+ muscle
fibres were present at locations both near the interface with native
uninjured muscle and within the centre of the scaffold site with no
evidence for continuity with adjacent native healthy muscle.
Biopsies also showed an increase in the presence of β-III Tubulin+
nerve bundles by 6 months after implantation throughout the
scaffold implant site (Figure 2o). CellProfiler (Broad Institute,

quantification
showed no significant
differences in the number of migrating PVSCs or vessels between
time points (Figure 2m,n).
ECM scaffolds degrade following implantation
Representative ultrasound imaging at 1 month after surgery
showed a sheet-like hyperechoic structure consistent with the
ECM scaffold overlying and adjacent to the native uninjured
muscle (Figure 3a). By 7 months BioDesign (SIS-ECM) and
Matristem (UBM-ECM) ECM scaffold materials were no longer
identifiable (Figure 3b), whereas the Xenatrix (dermis-ECM) ECM
scaffold was still identifiable (Figure 3f). In addition, increased
muscle tissue, identified by an imaging signal consistent with
muscle, was present at the site of ECM scaffold placement
(Figure 3d).
ECM treatment increases bulk muscle content
Before surgery, the average per cent of muscle loss ranged from
25–90% of contralateral limb tissue (Table 1). By 8 months,
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
imaging showed an increase in dense tissue consistent with that
of skeletal muscle within the implantation site. Post-operative
muscle bulk was calculated by selecting a region-of-interest in CT
or MRI images. Bulk muscle increased in all patients post-
operatively, with an average increase of 27.2% (Figure 4).
Interestingly, Patient 13 showed complete atrophy and absence
of hamstrings due to rupture pre-operatively. Following ECM
treatment, the implant site was replaced with tissue characterised
by an imaging signal consistent with muscle at measurements of
5.45 cm2, 6.90 cm2 and 7.39 cm2 at the proximal, middle and distal
aspect of the defect in the posterior compartment, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S1).
ECM bioscaffold implantation improves electrophysiological
function
Electrodiagnostic studies were conducted on 8 of the 13 patients.
At baseline, seven of the eight tested subjects presented with
patterns of mononeuropathies, with three subjects with anterior
compartment injuries in the lower leg presenting with deep
peroneal mononeuropathy and three of the four subjects with

previous work by not only increasing the number of patients, but
also utilising three different forms of ECM bioscaffolds, identifying
neurogenic cell types in the remodelling site, and documenting
electrophysiologic evidence of innervation and its association with
functional remodelling outcomes.

 strategies, a bioscaffold approach obviates the requirements of cell
isolation, manipulation, expansion, storage and delivery strategies.
In the present study, ECM bioscaffolds derived from three different
xenogeneic (porcine) source tissues—small intestinal submucosa
(SIS), urinary bladder matrix (UBM) and dermal ECM—were utilised.
Although our study was not powered to detect variation based on
ECM, no differences in outcomes were seen based on bioscaffold
used. These findings suggest the presence of similar signalling
mechanisms within the ECM derived from three different tissues. A
comparative analysis of the differences between ECM source tissues
and their effects on skeletal muscle reconstruction could only be
reliably performed in a very large sample due to the variety of
anatomic sites at which they need to be placed. Each of the
bioscaffolds used differ in their preparation methods including
method
of
decellularization
and
terminal
sterilisation.
Such
differences will logically confer differences in their mechanical and
biochemical properties. Further investigation could provide insight
into the preparation parameters that are associated with positive
tissue remodelling outcomes and could implicate the specific
bioscaffold constituents and/or properties that contribute to ECM-
mediated skeletal muscle remodelling.
While the exact mechanism(s) by which ECM bioscaffolds
promote constructive tissue remodelling are only partially under-
stood, previous work has shown that their degradation on
implantation generates low molecular weight matricryptic oligo-
peptides with the ability to recruit and influence endogenous
progenitor cells.22,23 It has been shown that PVSCs play a role in
ECM-mediated skeletal muscle repair.14 The present study shows
CD146+NG2+ PVSCs are not only localised around their typical
microvascular niche, but, following ECM implantation, mobilise
away from this traditional anatomic site. All muscle biopsies
showed this phenomenon, as well as evidence for neovasculariza-
tion and the presence of site-appropriate desmin+ striated muscle
as early as 6 weeks after bioscaffold implantation. The ability of
ECM bioscaffolds to influence the local skeletal muscle injury
microenvironment may allow for synergy and cross-talk between
PVSCs, myoblasts, neuronal progenitors and other responding cell
types, which contribute to skeletal muscle formation at the
implant site. The presence of PVSCs and myoblasts within this site
strongly suggests their participation in the remodelling process.
Whether or not the behaviour of PVSCs and myoblasts is mediated
directly by signalling from the ECM or via paracrine mechanisms is
unknown; however, it is plausible and logical that other stem and
progenitor cell populations also play a role in this constructive and
functional remodelling process.
Desmin+ skeletal muscle fibres were found not only at the
interface of the bioscaffold with native, adjacent, uninjured
muscle, but also within the centre of the scaffold implantation
site. The spatial distribution of skeletal muscle fibres clearly
separated from the interface with adjacent uninjured native
muscle suggests de novo skeletal muscle generation rather than
simple integration of native muscle with the scaffold-filled defect
site. In vitro studies have shown the ability of ECM signalling
molecules to promote mitogenesis and myogenesis of skeletal
muscle progenitor cells.23 The presence of β-III tubulin+ cells in
association with these new islands of skeletal muscle, combined
with positive EMG recordings, further supports the conclusion that
functional islands of new skeletal muscle have been formed.
CT or MRI imaging corroborated the histologic findings showing
an increase in post-operative soft tissue formation consistent with
bulk
skeletal
muscle
tissue
in
all
13
patients
(Figure
4,
Supplementary Figure 3). Whether or not this increase was due
to an increase in the size or the number of muscle fibres requires
further investigation. However, the needle EMG findings of
decreased ASA and improved recruitment would seem to indicate
new muscle fibre formation and gross changes in muscle
appearance were evident (Supplementary Figure 2).
The histomorphologic and imaging studies were accompanied
by clear and clinically relevant functional improvement. Two of the
13 patients showed an unappreciable change in force production
compared with pre-operative outcomes, but 11 of 13 patients
increased their pre-operative force production measured via
dynamometer by 20–140% at 6 months after surgery. Twelve
out of 13 patients showed improvement in functional task
performance. It is important to note that all patients had
previously undergone standard of care treatments, and custom
designed, aggressive physical therapy regimens prior to ECM
implantation and showed a plateau in force production or
functional task performance. The improvements in performance
following ECM bioscaffold implantation are thus likely due to ECM
intervention. The importance of a rigorous physical therapy
program following ECM implantation and its association with
successful outcomes should not be underestimated. The applica-
tion of a physiologic mechanical load (i.e., concomitant physical
rehabilitation) during the entirety of the remodelling period
following
ECM
implantation
has
been
shown
to
promote
favourable outcomes.24–27 It has been suggested that ECM
bioscaffolds contribute to force improvement by simple force
transduction based on results of a rodent model in which post-
operative physical therapy could not be controlled.28 While the
scar release of the procedure and the mechanical transduction
effect of the ECM layer may both be contributing factors to the
improved function, the histologic imaging and electrophysiologic
evidence of vascularised, innervated skeletal muscle within the
defect site in the present cohort of human patients suggests a
positive and contributing role for new skeletal muscle in the
functional outcomes. Taken together, the data from this study
show that ECM implants for soft tissue reconstruction, while long
regarded as a passive reinforcing layer, can undergo important
functional remodelling during the healing process.
Electrodiagnostic studies conducted on 8 of the 13 patients
showed concomitant nerve and muscle remodelling following ECM
treatment. Specifically, seven subjects presented with a pre-
operative electrodiagnosis of incomplete mononeuropathy in the
area of the VML defect. After treatment with ECM, five of the eight
patients showed improvements in nerve conduction or needle
electromyography
parameters
including
CMAP.
These
results

with a concomitant strength improvement. Histologic outcomes

Ultrasound imaging shows that ECM bioscaffolds degrade on implantation. (a) Grayscale ultrasound image 1 month after surgery in
the posterior shoulder demonstrates a thin, sheet-like hyperechoic structure representing SIS-ECM (yellow arrows) overlying the posterior

after surgery shows that surgically-placed SIS-ECM is not longer identifiable superficial to the posterior deltoid. (c). Ultrasound image 1 month
after surgery in the medial mid thigh demonstrates an ill-defined hypoechoic structure representing SIS-ECM (yellow arrows) adjacent to the
sartorius muscle. (d) Ultrasound image 7 months after surgery shows that surgically-placed SIS-ECM is no longer identifiable and the sartorius
muscle appears to have enlarged. (e) Ultrasound imaging 1 month after surgery in the posterior mid thigh demonstrates a sheet-like
echogenic structure representing dermal ECM (yellow arrows) with surrounding complex anechoic material (dashed-blue line) likely
representing post-operative fluid collection. (f) Ultrasound imaging 7 months after surgery shows dermal ECM (yellow arrows) has decreased

The present study has several limitations. It was not possible to
include an untreated control to determine the effects of scar tissue
debridement and tenolysis alone. However, 12 of 13 patients had
been subjected to extensive standard of care therapy (i.e., average
of 10 previous surgeries across all patients) and failed to improve.
Placebo effects (i.e., patients having more confidence after
treatment,
which
could
translate
to
improved
functional
outcomes) were uncontrolled. Although histologic outcomes
show the presence of PVSCs and desmin+ muscle fibres within
the ECM implantation site, and these findings were associated
with improved functional and strength outcomes, the present
study does not provide conclusive evidence that there is a causal
relationship between the presence of these cells and the
downstream functional improvements. The diverse nature of
anatomic implant sites and physical therapy activities performed
by the subjects made determination of an ‘average’ functional
improvement following bioscaffold implantation impossible. No
two patients had the same injury or comorbidities, and thus
each had a personalised physical therapy regimen composed of
specific exercises depending on the site of injury and other
comorbidities.
The results of this 13-patient cohort study show that an acellular
biologic scaffold approach can facilitate constructive and func-
tional tissue remodelling following VML. The mechanisms by
which such materials mediate their remodelling effects appear to
include recruitment of myogenic progenitor cells, improved
innervation and functional skeletal muscle formation. The findings
reported herein support the use of ECM bioscaffolds as a viable
treatment option for VML treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Overview of study design
A cohort study examining functional and histomorphologic outcomes
following VML repair with acellular biologic scaffolds was conducted with
informed subject consent and approvals from the Institutional Review
Board of the University of Pittsburgh and the US Department of
Defense Human Research Protection Office (ClinicalTrails.gov, identifier
NCT01292876). Subjects were screened for established exclusion criteria.14
A total of 13 subjects were enroled and subjected to a custom designed
physical therapy regimen both before and following implantation of one of
three different xenogenic scaffold materials, all of which were composed
of porcine ECM (Table 1). Patients were enroled in pre-operative physical
therapy and required to reach a functional plateau before the surgical
procedure so that post-operative improvements in function could not be
attributed to therapy alone. Force production, functional task improve-
ment, EMG analysis, CT or MRI imaging, and histology were used to
evaluate
return
of
strength,
function
and
bioscaffold
remodelling
characteristics at 6–8 weeks, 10–12 weeks and 24–28 weeks post
implantation.

 Subject selection and screening
Participants ranging from 18 to 70 years of age with a minimum 20%
structural volume deficit as determined by MRI or CT, and/or 25%
functional deficit of the muscle group mass when compared with the
contralateral limb were eligible for inclusion in the study. All study subjects
acquired VML at least 6 months prior to study inclusion. Exclusion criteria
included poor nutrition, chronic disease, active infection, neoplasia,
denervation or other medical comorbidities with the potential to impair
wound healing.
Prior to inclusion in the trial, all subjects were screened by a licensed
physical therapist to establish strength and functional deficits related to
the anatomic location of interest, with respect to the contralateral limb. A
detailed subject history was taken and the subject’s goals for participation
in
the
study
were
recorded.
Active
and
passive
range-of-motion
measurements were obtained at the joints both proximal and distal to
the affected area using a goniometer. Isometric strength of the affected
muscles was
quantified
using a
hand-held dynamometer.
Specific
functional outcome variables were selected and evaluated for each
subject based on their functional deficits and the objective measurements
of
strength
and
joint
range-of-motion.
Patient-reported
outcomes,
including the Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH)29 scale
and Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS)30 were administered,
as appropriate. Subjects were also asked to provide a self-report of
functional status at each of the tested time points. Outcome variables
were established a priori for each subject through a study team consensus
based on findings from the clinical examination specific to each
subject and their observed strength and functional deficits. When
possible,
outcome
variables
were
selected
that
were
previously
established as valid, reliable and aligned with the subject’s goals for the
trial. Video recordings were performed during the evaluations when
possible so as to ensure consistency in the testing positions across time
points.
Surgical procedure
All procedures were performed in a tertiary care medical centre under
general anaesthesia, and tourniquet control of the extremity used. The
injured muscle compartment was accessed, scar tissue was debrided and
selective tenolysis performed. One of the following three ECM bioscaffolds
was implanted at the site of missing muscle: MatriStem (ACell, Columbia,
MD, USA); BioDesign (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) or XenMatrix
(C.R. Bard, Warwick, RI, USA) which were derived from porcine urinary
bladder (UBM), SIS or dermis, respectively. All three scaffold materials were
decellularized to meet established minimum criteria for DNA removal.31
MatriStem was used in the first six subjects, and the remaining seven
subjects received either BioDesign or XenMatrix, randomly assigned. The
ECM bioscaffold was cut to defect size-matched appropriate length and
width, and implanted within the injury site with contact to adjacent native
healthy tissue, and secured under tension with monofilament absorbable
sutures. Care was taken to prevent folding or wrinkling and to ensure
adequate soft tissue coverage. All empty space was closed before closure
of the surgical site to ensure maximum scaffold-host tissue interaction, and
a closed suction drain was placed.
Physical therapy
Pre-surgical.
Subjects were required to participate in rigorous pre-
operative physical therapy for 4–16 weeks prior to surgery. The goal of
the pre-operative physical therapy programme was to maximize perfor-
mance with respect to the strength and functional outcome deficits
identified during the screening examination. Due to the unique clinical
presentation of each subject, physical therapy programs were customised
for each subject to address the specific strength and functional
deficits identified during the screening visit. Subjects were evaluated
weekly on their progress by the treating physical therapist. Subjects were
cleared to proceed to surgery after they reached a plateau in performance
on their involved side, defined as functional gains of o2–3% over the
course of any 2-week period, as determined by the treating physical
therapist. The treating physical therapist was not a member of the
investigative team. Outcome variables were tested by the same evaluating
physical therapist who was a member of the investigative team at each
time point.
Post-surgical.
Post-surgical physical therapy was initiated between 24 and
48 h following surgery. No limitations were placed on the exercises or
functional movements within the limits of tolerable pain. As early as the
first post-operative day, targeted exercises were performed with the
goal of stimulating muscle contraction and load bearing across the
scaffold implantation site. Pain level, range-of-motion, strength and
functional capacity were evaluated at each visit, and exercises were
continued as tolerated. The post-operative physical therapy phase lasted
24 weeks.
Isometric strength measurement
Isometric strength testing of the affected limb was measured 1–2 days
prior to ECM implantation, and again at 6–8 weeks, 10–12 weeks and 24–
28 weeks post-operatively. Measurements were taken using a hand-held
dynamometer and standard manual muscle testing positions.32 Each
measurement was repeated three times, and the average value of the
three trials was calculated to represent as an indication of the isometric
strength of the affected muscle.
Range-of-motion and functional task analysis
Range-of-motion and functional task analysis was conducted pre-operatively
and at 6–8 weeks, 10–12 weeks and 24–28 weeks post-operatively. All tasks
were performed on both the affected and contralateral limb. Each task was
repeated three times, and the average of the three trials was calculated as
representative of performance on the task.
Pre- and post-surgical imaging
Initial pre-operative CT imaging was performed on a 64-slice CT scanner
(LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) at a slice thickness of
1.25 and 2.5 mm and a pitch of 1.375 in both bone and soft tissue
algorithms. MRI protocols included a variety of sequences in sagittal,
coronal and axial planes using T1-weighted spin echo, T2-weighted fast
spin echo with or without fat suppression and STIR sequences. The kVp
and mA were optimised with respect to the subject habitus and site
imaged.
Coronal
and
sagittal
reformations
were
obtained.
Three-
dimensional volumetric reformatted imaging was also performed using
Vitrea (Vital Images, Minnetonka, MN, USA) with surface rendering, as well
as emphasis on the underlying musculature and osseous structures.
Pre-operative
imaging
was
reviewed
by
a
musculoskeletal-trained
radiologist (4 years’ experience). Initial CT imaging was assessed primarily
for the presence of volumetric loss of bulk and/or fatty infiltration in the
affected musculature. The overall percentage loss of muscle volume and
severity of fatty infiltration was graded, where appropriate. Imaging
was also evaluated for concomitant soft tissue (e.g., tendinous) and
osseous injury. Post-operative imaging was performed at an ~ 7-month
interval
with
similar
imaging
parameters.
Post-operative
imaging
included characterisation of the location and appearance of the ECM
scaffold, as well as a change in volume or appearance of the surrounding
musculature. Overall percentage change in affected muscle volume was
measured.
Ultrasound-guided core biopsy of ECM
Ultrasound-guided biopsy of the surgically-placed ECM was performed
~ 6 weeks and 26 weeks post-operatively. Pre-procedural grayscale and
colour/Power Doppler ultrasound of the operative site was performed to
identify and characterise the surgically-placed ECM. After an appropriate
needle trajectory was selected, the area was prepped and draped in sterile
fashion. Local anaesthesia with skin infiltration and deeper injection was
achieved with 1% lidocaine. Under ultrasound guidance, biopsy samples of
the ECM bioscaffold and surrounding soft tissue were obtained using an
18-gauge spring-loaded biopsy needle (Temno, CareFusion, McGaw Park,
IL, USA). A total of eight core samples were obtained at two separate
biopsy sites. Biopsies spanned the proximal to distal length and medial to
lateral width of the implantation site. Specimens were snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C.
Electrodiagnostic studies
As previously reported, nerve conduction and electromyography studies
were performed for 8 of the 13 subjects using a Synergy EMG machine
(Cardinal Health, Dublin, OH, USA).33 The specific nerve conduction studies
completed and the specific muscles tested with needle examination were
determined by location of the VML. Needle EMG analysis used concentric
needle electrodes placed in the standard muscle belly and was performed

 at the proximal and distal site of the injured muscle if the standard muscle
belly showed no evidence of electrical activity. Improvement in nerve
conduction was defined as a ⩾ 20% increase in motor nerve conduction
amplitude. For EMG studies, improvement was defined as either evidence
of increased firing in volitional recruitment of muscles or a decrease in
abnormal spontaneous activity compared with pre-operative results.
Differences in amplitudes of CMAP were compared between pre- and
post-ECM bioscaffold implant.
Histology and immunolabelling
Frozen tissue sections were fixed in an ice cold 50:50 solution of methanol/
acetone for 5 min and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Tissue
sections were incubated in blocking buffer to prevent non-specific
antibody binding composed of 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA),
2% (v/v) normal horse serum, 0·05% (v/v) Tween-20, 0·05% (v/v) Triton
X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Tissue sections were then
incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer as follows:
mouse monoclonal CD146 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at 1:350 and
rabbit polycloncal Neurogenin-2 (NG2, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at
1:200 as a perivascular stem cell markers, monocloncal anti-desmin
(Abcam) at 1:200 for a muscle cell marker and (4) β-III tubulin at 1:200, for a
neurogenic marker. After 16 h of incubation at 4 °C, tissue sections were
washed with PBS and incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Alexa Fluor donkey anti-mouse 488 or 594 or donkey anti-
rabbit 488, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature.
After
secondary
incubation,
nuclei
were
counterstained
with
4′,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and slides were coated with anti-fade
mounting media (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA). Tissue sections were imaged
using a Zeiss Axio-observer Z1 microscope using a × 20, 0.4 numerical
aperture objective with a × 1.6 optovar magnification changer (Carl Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany). Three fields of view were taken from each biopsy
sample.
