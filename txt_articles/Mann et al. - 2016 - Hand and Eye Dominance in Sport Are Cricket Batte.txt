Abstract
Background
When first learning to bimanually use a tool
to hit a target (e.g., when chopping wood or hitting a golf
ball), most people assume a stance that is dictated by their
dominant hand. By convention, this means that a ‘right-
handed’ or ‘left-handed’ stance that places the dominant
hand closer to the striking end of the tool is adopted in
many sports.
Objective
The aim of this study was to investigate whe-
ther the conventional stance used for bimanual hitting
provides the best chance of developing expertise in that
task.
Methods
Our study included 43 professional (interna-
tional/first-class) and 93 inexperienced (
\
5 years’ experi-
ence) cricket batsmen. We determined their batting stance
(plus hand and eye dominance) to compare the proportion
of batters who adopted a reversed stance when batting (that
is, the opposite stance to that expected based on their
handedness).
Results
We found that cricket batsmen who adopted a
reversed stance had a stunning advantage, with professional
batsmen 7.1 times more likely to adopt a reversed stance than
inexperienced batsmen, independent of whether they batted
right or left handed or the position of their dominant eye.
Conclusion
Findings imply that batsmen who adopt a
conventional stance may inadvertently be batting ‘back-to-
front’ and have a significant disadvantage in the game.
Moreover, the results may generalize more widely, bring-
ing into question the way in which other bimanual sporting
actions are taught and performed.
Key Points
Cricket batsmen have a surprising advantage if they
adopt the stance opposite to that expected based on
their handedness (i.e., if right handers bat left handed
and vice versa).
The advantage appears to be grounded in positioning
the dominant hand further from (rather than closer
to) the striking end of the bat.
Findings suggest that cricket batsmen may
inadvertently be taught to bat ‘back-to-front’.
1 Background
Our hand dominance shapes the way we perform bimanual
tasks. This is particularly the case when we use a tool (such
as an axe or golf club) to strike a target. When doing so, we
conventionally adopt a technique that places our dominant
hand closer to the striking end of the tool. For instance,
when playing cricket or baseball, we are usually taught to

 adopt a ‘right-handed’ or ‘left-handed’ stance that places
our dominant hand closer to the striking end of the bat.
Surprisingly, it is not clear why this is the case, and whe-
ther doing so provides the best chance of developing skill
in that task. However, a small proportion of the population
typically defies this convention and adopts the opposite
stance to that which would be expected based on their
handedness (which we call a reversed stance; see Fig. 1a
for further explanation). Therefore, comparing the perfor-
mance of those who adopt a conventional versus reversed
stance provides an ideal opportunity to better understand
which approach might best support the development of
expertise.
The examination of skill in sporting activities provides
some of the best evidence for the influence that handedness
can have on the development of motor expertise. In par-
ticular, the highly competitive nature of elite sport ensures
that small technical advantages can often afford significant
competitive benefits. As a case in point, an over-repre-
sentation of left-handers at the elite level of many sports is
well-established [1, 2], particularly in interactive sports
where players compete directly against opponents [2–4].
Brooks et al. [4] demonstrated that close to 50 % of the
batsmen playing for the best-performing teams at the 2003
Cricket World Cup were left handed (compared with the
10–13 % predicted by population norms [5]), concluding
that left-handed batsmen benefit from a negative fre-
quency-dependent effect [2, 6, 7] because opponents are
less accustomed to competing against left-handed batsmen
and therefore are less adept at bowling to them (leading to
poorer bowling strategies and accuracy). Crucially, this
frequency-dependent effect would benefit anyone who bats
using a left-handed stance, irrespective of their actual hand
dominance.
Although there is a clear association between left
handedness and success in sport [1, 2], this may be

 masking a more pervasive advantage afforded to some who
play left handed. We have noticed that a surprisingly high
proportion of seemingly left-handed batsmen in the sport of
cricket adopt a reversed stance during competition; that is,
they use a left-handed stance yet are actually right-hand
dominant. For those familiar with cricket, left-handed
batsmen such as Brian Lara, Chris Gayle, Clive Lloyd,
David Warner, David Gower, Adam Gilchrist, Alistair
Cook, Justin Langer, Michael Hussey, Mark Taylor, Kumar
Sangakkara, and Matthew Hayden stand out as being some
of the greatest batsmen of the modern era. What appears to
have been largely overlooked (both by most people
familiar with the game and by previous studies of hand-
edness) is that, while each of these players bats left handed,
they all bowl with their right hand (i.e., they bat using a
reversed stance). If those players were to have benefitted
from using a reversed stance, then we would expect to find
they possess a specific advantage (reversed-stance advan-
tage hypothesis) above and beyond the negative frequency-
dependent effects available to all left handers. Moreover, a
reversed-stance advantage should also be evident for those
who are left-hand dominant yet bat right handed. In sup-
port, other modern-day greats such as Michael Clarke and
Inzamam-ul-Haq bat right handed yet bowl with their left
hand. Therefore, by adopting a reversed (right-handed)
stance, they have foregone the potential frequency-depen-
dent effects they would have benefitted from by batting left
handed. Given the apparent wealth of high-quality players
who adopt a reversed stance, it could be that doing so
affords some sort of competitive advantage when batting
that cannot be explained by a frequency-dependent effect.
Crucially, if the reversed stance were to provide the best
chance of developing skill in hitting, it would suggest that
by teaching batsmen to use a conventional stance, coaches
may be inadvertently teaching players to bat ‘back-to-
front’ and could be harming rather than maximizing their
chance of developing expertise.
There are two primary reasons to believe that a reversed
stance might offer an advantage when batting. First, the
reversed stance places the player’s dominant hand at the
top rather than the bottom of the handle. This could confer
technical advantages: in cricket batting, the top hand is
typically responsible for controlling and guiding the path of
the bat to hit the ball, so it may be an advantage for the
hand with the greatest dexterity to perform those roles
(dominant-hand explanation). Second, in tasks that require
targeting people generally have a preference to rely on the
visual input from one of the two eyes (the dominant eye),
and the reversed stance increases the likelihood that the
dominant eye is the ‘front’ eye in a side-on activity like
batting (hand and eye dominance are matched in approxi-
mately 66 % of cases [8]). From our observations in both
cricket and baseball, coaches and applied practitioners
(e.g., optometrists) sometimes alter a batter’s stance to
ensure that the dominant eye has a clear view of the ball. It
could be that those with their dominant eye as the front eye
are conferred an advantage because it ensures the dominant
eye has an unobstructed view of the oncoming ball [9]
(dominant-eye explanation).
The aim of this study was to determine whether a reversed
stance provides an advantage in the development of expertise
in a bimanual hitting task. We did so in the sport of cricket by
testing the batting stance plus hand and eye dominance of 43
professional (international or first class) and 93 inexperi-
enced cricket batsmen. We hypothesized that the reversed
stance would offer a specific advantage in batting above and
beyond that available to left handers as a result of frequency-
dependent effects. We show that batsmen have a stunning
advantage if they defy convention and adopt a reversed
stance, and that the findings are supported by a significant
over-representation of modern-day international batsmen
who bat using a reversed stance. The results imply that most
cricket batsmen are taught to bat ‘back-to-front’ and call into
question the manner in which other bimanual motor actions
are taught and performed.
2 Methods
2.1 Participants
A total of 43 professional male cricket players (mean age
29.6 years, standard deviation [SD] 5.6) and 93 inexperi-
enced male cricketers (mean age 24.1 years, SD 7.2) par-
ticipated in the study. The professional group were all
members of a first-class and/or international cricket team:
26 had played at international level (ten had played test
cricket) and 17 had played at first-class level. The profes-
sional players were all selected in their team based on their
skill as a batsman (i.e., as a specialist batsman, a wicket-
keeper/batsman, or as an all-rounder—someone who bats
and bowls). Participants in the inexperienced group had
less than five years’ cricket experience (mean 1.2 years,
SD 1.4), with most not actively participating in organized
cricket at the time of testing. The experimental procedure
conformed to the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Faculty of Human Movement Sciences at Vrije Universiteit
Amsterdam. Participants were informed about the nature of
the study and signed informed consent forms prior to
testing.
2.2 Procedure
We determined the hand dominance, eye dominance, and
batting stance of all participants.

 2.2.1 Hand Dominance
To determine hand dominance, participants completed the
Edinburgh Handedness Inventory—Short Form [10]. This
validated questionnaire provides a measure of handedness
by testing the hand used during four activities of daily liv-
ing: writing, throwing, using a toothbrush, and using a
spoon. For each of the four activities, participants rated
whether they use their right or left hand for that activity on a
scale from one (always right) to five (always left).
According to the questionnaire guidelines, participants
whose average score across all four tasks was greater than
three were classed as left-hand dominant, those whose score
was below three were classed as right-hand dominant, and
those with a score equal to three were classified as mixed
dominance [10]. One professional and one inexperienced
player had mixed hand dominance and were therefore
excluded from all analyses. Handedness surveys were
unavailable for five of the professional players. Consistent
with previous studies [1], for those players we assumed the
hand they used when bowling was their dominant hand
(classifying one as reversed and four as conventional). In
support, the hand used for bowling is almost always that
used for throwing,1 and there was 96 % agreement (124/129
participants) between the dominant hand established by the
questionnaire and that used for throwing.
2.2.2 Eye Dominance
Eye dominance can change depending on the conditions in
which it is tested [11–13]. To account for this, three dif-
ferent tests of eye dominance were performed (Fig. 2). All
three tests were based on a modified version of the Porta
test [14], with a camera used to produce material evidence
of eye dominance. For each test, participants stood three
meters from a camera positioned at the participant’s eye
level. Two of the three tests were performed using a front-
on stance. In the right-hand front-on test, participants stood
front-on to the camera, raised their right arm, and pointed
directly at the center of the camera lens with both eyes
open. When the participant confirmed that he was pointing
at the center of the lens, a photograph was taken. This
procedure was repeated for the left-hand front-on test when
pointing with the left arm. The third test was one of batting
eye dominance, where participants adopted their side-on
batting stance and looked towards the camera. All inex-
perienced participants knew the stance they would typi-
cally adopt as they were from cricket-playing countries and
had at some time played the game (formally or informally).
From the batting stance, participants were asked to raise
the arm nearest the camera and point towards the center of
the lens with both eyes open. A photograph was taken
when the participant confirmed he was ready.
Eye dominance was established by viewing the pho-
tographs of the participants. In each of the three tests, the
dominant eye was determined by selecting the eye partici-
pants used to align themselves with the camera. If the finger/
thumb was aligned with one of the eyes then that eye was
deemed to be the dominant eye (e.g., if the right eye was in
any way obscured by the finger/thumb, the participant was
deemed to be right-eye dominant and vice versa). If the
finger/thumb was placed between the two eyes rather than in
any way obscuring an eye then the dominance was deemed to
be mixed. The dominant eye established during the batting
eye dominance test was expected to be the one most likely to
be preferred during batting, so it was the eye used as the
‘dominant eye’ for further analyses. One of the professional
players was found to have mixed eye dominance with this
test; however, it was the same participant who had mixed
handedness and had already been excluded from all analyses
(the player was a relatively inexperienced and less accom-
plished all-rounder who had played only two first-class
matches, and who bats and bowls left handed).
We checked the agreement between the three different
tests of eye dominance. The agreement between the two
front-on tests was 85 %, that between the batting eye
dominance test and the right-hand front-on test was 87 %,
and that between the batting and left-hand front-on test was
91 %. However, the best agreement was between the result
for the test of batting eye dominance and that found during
the corresponding front-on test using the same hand (95 %;
i.e., if batting right handed, we compared the batting test
with the left-hand front-on test and vice versa). This sug-
gests it was the hand used during the test that caused most
of the variability between the tests.
2.2.3 Batting Stance
Batting stance was determined on the basis of the stance
that participants adopted in the test of batting eye domi-
nance; a stance with the left foot closer to the camera was
classified as a right-handed batting stance, and a stance
with the right foot nearer the camera was classified as a
left-handed batting stance.
2.3 Additional Data
A preliminary check of the handedness data revealed very
high agreement between the dominant hand determined by
the questionnaire and the hand used when throwing (96 %
agreement). Given that the throwing hand is generally also
the hand used for bowling, we decided to use the bowling
hand as a proxy for the dominant hand and to perform further

hand yet bowl with the other.

 analysis to check whether the proportion of professional
batters who adopted a reversed stance in our sample was
representative of that in the wider population of interna-
tional-level batsmen. To do so, we collected additional data
on the bowling hand and batting stance of (1) the 100 highest-
ranked batsmen in the world, and (2) batsmen at the 2003
Cricket World Cup (matching the sample from the afore-
mentioned study by Brooks et al. [4]). Data on the bowling
hand and batting stance were collected from the match
records of first-class and international cricket matches
available on the website of ESPN Cricinfo (http://www.
espncricinfo.com/ci/content/stats/index.html). If a player
had not bowled in a match (typically wicketkeepers), we
excluded that player from all analyses, as we had no way of
determining their dominant hand.
2.3.1 Highest-Ranked International Batsmen
The International Cricket Council (ICC) ranks the 100
best-performing batsmen on an on-going basis for those
who play in international tests, 1-day, and T20 matches
(the three different formats of the game). We chose to use
the rankings for the test batsmen, as this represents what is
typically considered the most challenging form of the
game. The rankings we used were accessed from the
ICC website (http://www.icc-cricket.com/player-rankings/
mens-test) on 15 November 2014. Data about the bowling
hand were unavailable for seven batsmen, so only 93
batsmen were included in the final analysis.
2.3.2 Batsmen at the 2003 Cricket World Cup
Brooks et al. [4] reported, based on their analysis of bats-
men taking part in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, that left-
handed batsmen benefit from a negative frequency-depen-
dent effect. We re-analyzed these data to determine whe-
ther the benefits experienced by the left-handed batsmen
were better explained by an advantage for those who
adopt a reversed stance. Of the 205 players reported to
have batted at the 2003 World Cup (data retrieved from
http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/stats/index.html),
we excluded those for whom we could not establish the
bowling hand (n = 12). For consistency with the data from
Brooks et al. [4], we excluded those who had not been
dismissed at least once in the group matches (n = 33). As a
result, a total of 160 batsmen were included in our analysis.
2.4 Statistical Analyses
Chi-squared testing was used to establish whether propor-
tions (e.g., proportion of batsmen who adopted a reversed
stance) differed across two groups. Odds ratios (ORs) were
used to calculate the size effects using Eq. (1):
OR ¼ n

ð ÞUnexposed noncases

where, for example, when interested in the proportion of
professional batsmen who bat using a reversed stance
(when compared with the proportion of the inexperienced
group):
(n)Exposed

of
professional
batsmen who bat with a reversed stance, (n)Exposed

with a reversed stance, (n)Unexposed cases = number of

batsmen who bat with a conventional stance.
In two cases, we pooled the players in our professional
group with the 100 highest-ranked international batsmen

 and the players in the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Eight
batsmen were in at least two of the three pooled groups, so
their data were included only once. The data for the pooled
group were then compared with those of the participants in
our inexperienced group. To compare the advantages
afforded to professional left-handed batsmen who used a
conventional or reversed stance to those in the inexperi-
enced group, we used a goodness-of-fit test because the
number of inexperienced batsmen who did so was very low
(three and two respective participants) and this would have
violated the assumptions of a normal chi-squared test
(needing a minimum of five observations in each cell of the
contingency table). ORs were reported as a measure of
effect size for the goodness-of-fit test (comparing the
observed and expected frequencies).
We calculated 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for each
of the ORs using Eq. (2). Results were considered signifi-
cant to p \ 0.05 if the CI did not pass through the null
value of one.

3 Results
3.1 Reversed Versus Conventional Stance
Adopting a reversed stance appears to offer a very signif-
icant advantage in becoming a professional batsman. Our
group of professional batsmen were 7.1 times more likely
to adopt a reversed stance than the inexperienced batsmen
(40 % of the professionals vs. 9 % of the inexperienced
batsmen; v2(1) = 19.2, p \ 0.0001; OR 7.1, 95 % CI
2.8–18.5; Fig. 1b).
The
results
strongly
supported
the
dominant-hand
explanation as the reason for the over-representation of
professional batsmen who adopt a reversed stance. Placing
the dominant eye at the front of the stance (closer to the
bowler) did not change the likelihood of being in the
professional group (43 vs. 38 %; v2(1) = 0.28, p = 0.60;
OR 1.2, 95 % CI 0.6–2.6; Fig. 1c) [9], whereas placing the
hand at the top of the bat clearly did (40 vs. 9 %; OR 7.1,
see previous paragraph). None of the conclusions changed
if we used the results of the front-on tests rather than the
batting eye-dominance test: placing the dominant eye at the
front of the stance did not change the likelihood of being in
the professional group if the results from the right-hand
front-on
dominance
test
were
used
(v2(1) = 2.38,
p = 0.12; OR 1.8, 95 % CI 0.8–4.1) or if the results of the
left-hand front-on test were used (v2(1) = 0.12, p = 0.73;
OR 1.2, 95 % CI 0.5–2.6).
A small proportion of the population have inconsistent
handedness [15], meaning that they write with one hand yet
throw with the other (&28.8 % of left-handed and 1.6 % of
right-handed writers) [16]. It could be reasonable to
hypothesize that the switched-stance batsmen are those
who display inconsistency, as they would be more adept at
using their non-dominant hand. However, this was not the
case. We analysed the data for our participants for whom
we had conclusive questionnaire data on the writing and
throwing hands (n = 129) and found that only five had
inconsistent handedness: four from the professional group
(all reversed stance) and only one from the inexperienced
group (conventional stance). As a result, the majority of
our reversed-stance professional batsmen (75 %; 12 of 16
batsmen) did not have inconsistent handedness. Indeed, the
significant advantage for the reversed-stance batsmen
remained even when considering only those known to have
consistent
handedness
(36
vs.
9 %;
v2(1) = 13.6,
p \ 0.001; OR 5.9, 95 % CI 2.1–16.4). Although the
reversed-stance advantage cannot be explained by a par-
ticular benefit for those who have inconsistent handedness,
the higher proportion in the professional group is sugges-
tive of inconsistent handedness playing a role in the
development of skill in batting.
To confirm that the advantage for reversed-stance
batsmen generalized more widely to other elite batsmen,
we examined the proportion of the 100 highest-ranked
modern-day international cricket batsmen who adopt a
reversed stance (assuming the bowling hand as the domi-
nant hand [1]). Almost one-third of the world’s best bats-
men defy convention and adopt a reversed stance (30 %;
v2(1) = 13.5, p \ 0.001; OR 4.5, 95 % CI 1.9–10.6; using
the inexperienced group as controls). This is striking given
our finding that only a small proportion of our control
population of inexperienced batsmen (&9 %) adopt a
reversed stance when batting.
3.2 Left-Handed Advantage
Consistent with previous studies [1, 4], our sample inclu-
ded a significant over-representation of professional bats-
men who batted using a left-handed stance (14 of 42
batsmen; proportion of professional vs. inexperienced
batsmen = 33 vs. 5 %; v2(1) = 18.4, p \ 0.0001; OR 8.7,
95 % CI 2.9–26.3). However, the results of the handedness
questionnaires show that 13 of those 14 professional
batsmen (93 %) were actually right-hand dominant. This
provides some support for the idea that the advantage
conferred on left-handed batsmen is largely for those who
adopt a reversed stance (i.e., for batsmen who are right-
1360
D. L. Mann et al.
123
 hand dominant but bat left handed) rather than there being
a more general frequency-dependent benefit for all who bat
left handed (irrespective of whether they are right- or left-
hand dominant). To check this, we re-examined the data
from Brooks et al. [4] on batsmen at the 2003 World Cup
and found that the majority of their left-handed batsmen
(25/41; 61 %) were in fact right-hand dominant (based on
their bowling hand). Moreover, for the 100 highest-ranked
modern-day test batsmen, 70 % of those who bat left-
handed are right-hand dominant (26/37).2 Overall, batsmen
who are left-hand dominant and bat left handed (i.e., use a
conventional stance) have an advantage in becoming a
professional (9.8 % of professionals vs. 3.3 % of inexpe-
rienced; v2(1) = 38.4, p \ 0.00001, OR 3.2, 95 % CI
1.5–6.9; pooling the professional, 2003 World Cup, and
100 highest-ranked batsmen and comparing it with the
proportion of our inexperienced batsmen), consistent with
the idea that left handers benefit from a frequency-depen-
dent effect. However, this benefit is strongly outweighed by
the significantly greater advantage afforded to batsmen
who are right-hand dominant but bat left handed using a
reversed stance (21.3 % of professionals vs. 2.2 % of
inexperienced;
v2(1) = 491.3,
p \ 0.00001,
OR
12.1,
95 % CI 5.2–28.2; OR is outside of the 95 % CI for the left-
handed batsmen who are left-hand dominant), demonstrating
a significant reversed-stance advantage above and beyond
that possible from a more general frequency-dependent
effect.
Importantly, the reversed-stance advantage may not be
exclusive to batsmen who use a left-handed stance, as the
effect appears to generalize more widely to those who are
left-hand dominant but bat using a right-handed stance. If
there were to be a selective benefit for left-handed batsmen,
the proportion of reversed-stance batsmen who bat right
handed (but are left-hand dominant) should be lower than
10–13 % (the proportion of the population who are left-hand
dominant [5]). Of our professional batsmen, 24 % of the
reversed-stance batsmen batted right handed (4/17). To see if
this finding applied more widely, we again pooled those data
with the 100 highest-ranked and 2003 World Cup batsmen.
We found the proportion of reversed-stance batsmen batting
right handed (13/74; 18 % of reversed-stance batsmen) did
not
differ
from
the
10–13 %
expected
by
chance
(v2(1) = 2.7, p = 0.10; OR 1.6, 95 % CI 0.6–4.2). Although
a much larger sample would be necessary to conclusively
demonstrate a reversed stance advantage when adopting a
right-handed stance, the evidence at hand leads us to believe
that the reversed-stance advantage is not exclusively con-
ferred to left-handed batsmen, but may be apparent for both
left-handed and right-handed batsmen.
4 Discussion
The aim of this study was to determine whether a ‘re-
versed’ stance provides a significant advantage in the
development of expertise in a bimanual sporting task. We
tested the batting stance plus hand and eye dominance of
professional and inexperienced cricket batsmen. If there
were an over-representation of professional batsmen who
adopt a reversed stance, this would provide evidence that a
reversed stance is a better technique to use for batting.
Consistent with our reversed-stance advantage hypothesis,
we found that the professional batsmen were seven times
more likely to adopt a reversed stance than the inexperi-
enced batsmen. The over-representation could not be
explained by a frequency-dependent advantage for left-
handed batsmen, by the position of the dominant eye in the
stance, or on the basis of inconsistent handedness; rather,
the results appear to be grounded in the positioning of the
dominant hand at the top of the bat handle. The findings
indicate that a reversed stance provides a remarkable
advantage in becoming a professional batsman and raise
interesting questions about whether the findings would
apply more widely to other bimanual tasks.
Given that the ‘conventional’ way of holding a cricket
bat (with the dominant hand on the bottom of the handle)
has remained basically unchanged since the invention of
the game, we sought to discover how this convention first
came about. To uncover this we visited the library at Lords
Cricket Ground in London and found that the conventional
stance used for cricket batting may have been modelled on
the stance used for other bimanual hitting tasks. For
instance, the first Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) coach-
ing manual published in 1952 [17] instructs batters to pick
up a bat in the same manner they would pick up an axe. This
too would typically ensure that the dominant hand is on the
bottom of the handle and may explain why batters were
originally taught to adopt such a grip when batting.
The modelling of cricket batting on other bimanual hitting
tasks leads us to ask two questions: (1) why might there be a
general preference for placing the dominant hand closer to
the hitting implement when performing these tasks, and (2)
how could doing so prove to be a disadvantage in the
development of skill? Learners undergo different stages of
learning when acquiring a new motor skill [18, 19], and we
hypothesize that the influence of the position of the dominant
hand in bimanual hitting might differ across the different
stages of learning. More specifically, a conventional stance
may provide a short-term advantage when first learning to
2 We expect that the higher proportion of reversed-stance left-handed
batsmen in our sample is a result of chance, although participants in
our sample were largely playing in the English first-class competition,
and therefore may not provide as even a representation of the
international playing community as our two additional groups. A
country- or cultural-specific bias could underpin the difference.

 use the tool yet be a disadvantage in the longer-term devel-
opment of expertise. Consider a young child learning to use a
hammer. At first, they will place their hand very close to the
hitting end of the hammer to increase control (by decreasing
the moment arm [20]) and thereby improve their hitting
accuracy. However, as the child becomes more proficient in
using the hammer, they typically move their hand further
from the hitting end, effectively increasing the moment of
inertia (the hand/pivot is further from the hitting end of the
implement [20]) to enhance the power with which they can
hit the target. Similarly for cricket batting, we hypothesize
that the conventional stance may be beneficial when first
learning because the dominant hand is lower on the bat,
effectively increasing control and accuracy in the initial
stages of learning. However, as cricket batsmen learn to
refine their batting technique, they are taught to ensure their
top hand is the one that provides most control when guiding
the swing path of the bat. Therefore, in thelonger term, it may
be that those with a reversed stance enjoy the benefits of
having their dominant hand (with greater dexterity) per-
forming the bulk of the work required to swing and control
the bat. It could be that the optimal learning approach would
be to first learn using a conventional stance, but to switch to a
reversed stance later in development. This hypothesis could
be tested by (1) examining whether those who have become
successful using a reversed stance did so when they first
learned to bat or only later in development, and/or (2)
designing training interventions that evaluate the efficacy of
learning when adopting the reversed stance at the start of, or
only later in, development.
In addition to the potential technical advantages con-
ferred to reversed-stance batsmen while batting, they may
also benefit from a bias in talent selection during devel-
opment. Coaches and talent scouts generally prefer young
batsmen to possess an ideal ‘technique’ when batting, and a
dominant top hand is likely to be associated with a more
favorable technique when batting. Specifically, batsmen
are generally expected to maintain a ‘straight bat’ when
attempting to hit the ball so that the plane of the bat swing
matches the oncoming ball (thus maximizing the margin
for error at bat–ball contact). This is more likely to occur
when the bat is predominantly controlled by the top hand
[21]. If having the dominant hand at the top of the bat does
allow for a better technique, then reversed-stance batsmen
may benefit from an increased likelihood of being selected
into representative teams and squads, offering better
training and exposure to higher-level competition. These
claims are clearly testable: kinematic analyses can be
performed to test whether a dominant top hand does afford
technical advantages when swinging the bat, and the
selections made by coaches or scouts can be tested to see
whether they have an unintentional bias towards selecting
batsmen who bat using a reversed stance.
Given the popularity of the game of cricket, it is sur-
prising that the advantage afforded by the reversed stance
has not already been established. The majority of batsmen
who adopt a reversed stance do so while batting left han-
ded; therefore, the effect may have been largely masked by
the more widely known over-representation of left-handed
batsmen at the professional level [1, 4]. In contrast, the
proportion of professional batsmen who are left-hand
dominant yet bat right-handed is not high (&4.5 % from
our data). Therefore, it is not surprising that any over-
representation of those batters has not stood out relative to
the proportion of those found in the wider population, even
though some of the best batsmen in the modern era have
batted right handed yet bowled with their left hand (e.g.,
Michael Clarke and Inzamam-ul-Haq).
Although our results could not be explained on the
basis of an advantage afforded by inconsistent handed-
ness (writing and throwing with the opposite hand), the
surprising number of our professional batsmen who did
so (n = 4) suggests this may be a topic worthy of further
investigation. In support, some of the best players of the
modern era are known to have inconsistent handedness
(e.g., Kane Williamson, Shane Watson, and Mitchell
Johnson), and even Sachin Tendulkar, probably the best
batsman in the last 70 years of international cricket,
batted and bowled right handed yet writes with his left
hand. It is possible that those with inconsistent hand-
edness are less lateralized and may therefore benefit in a
bimanual task such as batting. Alternatively, it could be
that players with inconsistent handedness are simply
more likely to adopt a reversed stance because they
choose their batting stance on the assumption that it
should match their bowling/throwing hand rather than
the hand they write with.
Cricket batting represents one of many bimanual tasks
where tools are used to strike targets. We have limited our
examination to cricket, but the results may apply more
widely. In golf, three of the four men to have won a major
championship playing left handed were right-hand domi-
nant. Similarly, some of the world’s best golfers (e.g., Ben
Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Nick Price) were left-hand domi-
nant but played right handed [22]. Furthermore, almost half
of the top ten presently active batters playing Major League
baseball (as measured by batting average) bat left handed
yet throw (and write) right handed (four of nine batsmen;
the tenth bats both right and left handed).3 These
3 We sourced the list of top ten currently active batsmen, along with
their playing stance and throwing arm, from the official MLB website
(http://www.mlb.com; retrieved 30 Jan 2016). We searched Google
for images of each player signing autographs to establish the writing
hand (e.g., ‘‘Ichiro Suzuki signing autographs’’). All ten batsmen
throw right handed: four bat left handed, five right handed, and one
both right and left handed.

 observations suggest the reversed stance benefits apparent
in cricket batting may apply more widely to the perfor-
mance of other tasks, particularly those in which per-
formers hit a target with power to maximize success. It
could be that a dominant top hand is beneficial in those
tasks (e.g., cricket and baseball batting, driving in golf),
whereas a dominant bottom hand could be best when pri-
oritizing precision (e.g., golf putting and dribbling in field
hockey). A comparison of the technique used by skilled
and less-skilled performers of those tasks would help
uncover the optimal means of performing each task.
It is not clear why those who adopt a reversed stance
might have chosen to do so, though in many cases it
appears to have happened by chance. One of Australia’s
best ever cricket batsmen, Michael Hussey, is right-hand
dominant but learned to bat left handed to emulate his
childhood idol, Allan Border [23]. American golfer Phil
Mickleson, a five-time major-championship winner, is right
handed but learned to play left handed to mirror his father’s
right-handed swing [22]. Chance occurrences like these
may have bestowed an unexpected advantage on those who
inadvertently adopted a reversed stance. And the results
suggest, at least in cricket, that by adopting the conven-
tional stance, batsmen may have been unintentionally
taught to bat ‘back-to-front’ and might not have maximized
their potential in the game.
