Abstract
The Rho GTPase proteins Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42 have a central role in regulating the actin 
cytoskeleton in dendritic spines1, thereby exerting control over the structural and functional 
plasticity of spines2, 3, 4, 5 and, ultimately, learning and memory6, 7, 8. Although previous work has 
shown that precise spatiotemporal coordination of these GTPases is crucial for some forms of cell 
morphogenesis9, the nature of such coordination during structural spine plasticity is unclear. Here 
we describe a three-molecule model of structural long-term potentiation (sLTP) of murine 
dendritic spines, implicating the localized, coincident activation of Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42 as a 
causal signal of sLTP. This model posits that complete tripartite signal overlap in spines confers 
sLTP, but that partial overlap primes spines for structural plasticity. By monitoring the 
spatiotemporal activation patterns of these GTPases during sLTP, we find that such spatiotemporal 
signal complementation simultaneously explains three integral features of plasticity: the 
facilitation of plasticity by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the postsynaptic source of 
which activates Cdc42 and Rac1, but not RhoA; heterosynaptic facilitation of sLTP, which is 
conveyed by diffusive Rac1 and RhoA activity; and input specificity, which is afforded by spine-
restricted Cdc42 activity. Thus, we present a form of biochemical computation in dendrites 
involving the controlled complementation of three molecules that simultaneously ensures signal 
specificity and primes the system for plasticity.
Previous studies using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (2pFLIM) in combination 
with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensors revealed that the Rho 
GTPases Cdc42 and RhoA had distinct spatial profiles during sLTP, with Cdc42 showing 
synapse-restricted activity and RhoA showing a diffuse, heterosynaptic pattern3. To obtain a

 more complete understanding of the spatiotemporal patterning of Rho GTPase activity 
during sLTP, we developed a FRET-based sensor for Rac1, following the design of the 
Cdc42 and RhoA sensors3 (Fig. 1a; validation in Extended Data Figs 1, 2, 3). We transfected 
rat organotypic hippocampal slices with the sensor using biolistics10, 11 and imaged CA1 
pyramidal neurons using 2pFLIM12. When sLTP was induced in single dendritic spines with 
two-photon glutamate uncaging13, 14 (Fig. 1b, c), Rac1 was rapidly (within ~1 min) 
activated in the stimulated spine, and remained active for at least 30 min (Fig. 1b, d), notably 
displaying a more pronounced sustained phase than RhoA or Cdc42 (ref. 3). This activation 
initially showed limited diffusion, after which it slowly spread over ~10 μm of the parent 
dendrite until it nearly equalized with activity in the spine (Fig. 1b, d, e, Extended Data Fig. 
2a, b). Similar to Cdc42 and RhoA, Rac1 activation was dependent on NMDARs (N-methyl-
d-aspartate receptors) and CaMKII (Extended Data Fig. 2d–f), and both pharmacological 
inhibition of Rac1 and single-cell knockout of Rac1 inhibited sLTP (Extended Data Fig. 4). 
Thus, like RhoA and Cdc42, Rac1 is a Rho GTPase molecule linking NMDAR–CaMKII 
signalling to sLTP.
We next examined whether postsynaptic BDNF15, which also links NMDAR–CaMKII 
signalling and sLTP, is required for Rho GTPase activation during sLTP. To do this, we used 
a single-cell knockout technique15, 16 with organotypic hippocampal slices from BDNF 
conditional knockout mice (Bdnffl/fl)17, 36 coupled with biolistic transfection of Cre 
recombinase alongside a Rho GTPase sensor. We found that removal of postsynaptic BDNF 
significantly attenuated Rac1 and Cdc42 activation during sLTP without affecting RhoA 
(Fig. 1f, g), and reduced the associated expression of sLTP15 (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). 
This suggests that Rac1 and Cdc42, but not RhoA, are downstream of postsynaptic BDNF. 
Similarly, addition of the extracellular BDNF scavenger TrkB-Ig (2 μg ml−1) significantly 
attenuated the activation of both Rac1 and Cdc42 (Extended Data Fig. 5c, d, g, h). Finally, 
postsynaptic removal of the BDNF receptor TrkB using Trkbfl/fl (also known as Ntrk2fl/fl) 
mice also significantly attenuated Rac1 and Cdc42 activation (Extended Data Fig. 5e, f, i, j). 
These results suggest that an autocrine BDNF–TrkB system controls the activation of Rac1 
and Cdc42, thereby instructing two distinct spatial signalling domains relevant to plasticity: 
a spine-specific domain comprising BDNF–TrkB–Cdc42, and a diffuse domain comprising 
BDNF–TrkB–Rac1. Since BDNF–TrkB signalling is preferentially enriched in stimulated 
spines during sLTP (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 2a), diffusion of Rac1 molecules (Extended 
Data Fig. 2c) or of Rac1 activators downstream of TrkB7, 18 probably caused the observed 
spreading of Rac1 activity. By contrast, the spatial spreading of Cdc42 (before its decay) 
was similar to that of TrkB during the same time period (Extended Data Fig. 2b).
Notably, the length scale of Rac1 spreading is similar to that of synaptic crosstalk, a 
phenomenon in which sLTP induction briefly facilitates sLTP in nearby (~5–10 μm) spines 
on the same dendrite19, 20. Thus, we next addressed whether BDNF–TrkB–Rac1 signalling 
contributes to such crosstalk. Consistent with previous studies19, 20, a suprathreshold sLTP 
stimulus delivered to one spine allowed a subsequent subthreshold stimulus at a nearby (≤~5 
μm) spine to induce sLTP (hereafter referred to as crosstalk) (Fig. 2a, b). To test whether 
crosstalk requires BDNF–TrkB–Rac1 signalling, we first used partial pharmacological 
inhibition of this pathway. Although strong inhibition of BDNF signalling has been shown to 
impair sLTP15, we found that weak inhibition of this pathway with a low concentration (0.25

 μg ml−1) of TrkB-Ig preserved sLTP (ΔVsupra sustained = 58 ± 13% (mean ± s.e.m.), in which 
V denotes spine volume), but attenuated crosstalk (ΔVsub sustained = 20 ± 8%), suggesting 
that BDNF is required for this process (Fig. 2c, g). To ensure that these effects were due to 
BDNF signalling through TrkB, we used TrkbF616A mutant mice, which contain a point 
mutation that renders TrkB uniquely susceptible to inhibition by the small molecule 
1NMPP1 (ref. 21). We found that application of a low concentration (0.125 μM) of 1NMPP1 
in TrkbF616A slices selectively abolished crosstalk without affecting sLTP (ΔVsupra sustained = 
59 ± 16%, ΔVsub sustained = 9 ± 8%) (Fig. 2d, g). Interestingly, weak BDNF–TrkB inhibition 
also reduced Rac1 activity in dendritic shafts during the time frame of crosstalk induction 
(1–2 min), without inhibiting the activity in the stimulated spines (Extended Data Fig. 6d–g). 
Likewise, while a high concentration of the Rac1 inhibitor NSC-23766 significantly reduced 
sLTP (Extended Data Fig. 4a, c), a small concentration (15 μM) inhibited crosstalk without 
significantly affecting sLTP (ΔVsupra sustained = 48 ± 12%, ΔVsub sustained = 12 ± 10%) (Fig. 
2e, g). This NSC-23766 concentration also trended towards decreasing the Rac1 activation 
in the shaft (Extended Data Fig. 6h, i). These data suggest that BDNF initiates a signalling 
cascade capable of lowering the threshold of structural plasticity, consistent with previous 
reports implicating BDNF in similar phenomena22. Indeed, exogenous BDNF (20 ng ml−1) 
application for ~10–15 min allowed a subthreshold stimulus alone to induce sLTP 
(ΔVsub sustained = 119 ± 31%) (Fig. 2f, g). Notably, BDNF application alone was sufficient to 
activate Rac1 and Cdc42, but had no significant effect on spine volume (Extended Data Fig. 
7), suggesting that BDNF is facilitative of, but insufficient for, sLTP. Taken together, these 
results suggest that the BDNF–TrkB–Rac1 signalling initiated in a single spine during sLTP 
induction facilitates sLTP in nearby spines, allowing synaptic crosstalk.
To probe the requirement of heterosynaptic Rac1 activity for synaptic crosstalk more 
specifically, we devised a strategy to interrupt Rac1 activity spreading out of the stimulated 
spine during sLTP: we restricted the Rac1 inhibitory peptide W56 (ref. 23) to dendrites by 
fusing it to the microtubule binding domain (MTBD) of MAP2, concentrating the inhibitor 
to dendritically enriched microtubules24, 25(Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 8a). This construct, 
W56–mCh–MTBD (in which mCh denotes mCherry), was concentrated in dendritic shafts 
and excluded from spines (Extended Data Fig. 8a). We found that this inhibitor significantly 
reduced Rac1 activation in the dendritic shaft, while largely preserving its activation in the 
stimulated spine (Fig. 3b, c). By contrast, W56–mCh without MTBD resulted in a more 
global reduction in Rac1 activation (Extended Data Fig. 8c, d). When the W56 peptide was 
scrambled (scr–mCh–MTBD), Rac1 activity spreading was normal (Fig. 3b, c). Finally, 
W56–mCh–MTBD did not change the spatial spreading of RhoA (Extended Data Fig. 8e). 
These results suggest that W56–mCh–MTBD specifically inhibits the spreading of Rac1 
activity into dendrites.
Consistent with the hypothesis that Rac1 activity spreading is required for synaptic 
crosstalk, the expression of W56–mCh–MTBD reduced crosstalk without significantly 
affecting sLTP (Fig. 3g). By contrast, a similar expression level of scr–mCh–MTBD affected 
neither sLTP nor crosstalk (Fig. 3g, Extended Data Fig. 8b). To test the specificity of this 
manipulation further, we tethered the Rac1-specific GTPase-activating protein ARHGAP15 
(ref. 26) to MTBD. This construct also reduced Rac1 activity spreading without significantly 
affecting activation in the spine, and inhibited crosstalk without affecting sLTP (Extended

 Data Fig. 8f–k). Thus, activation of Rac1 in the dendritic shaft is necessary for synaptic 
crosstalk.
Since RhoA activation also spreads into nearby spines during sLTP, we next tested whether 
this BDNF-independent signal is also required for synaptic crosstalk. To do this, we tethered 
dominant-negative RhoA (DNRhoA) to mCh–MTBD (Fig. 3d). Expressing DNRhoA–mCh–
MTBD significantly reduced a portion of RhoA activity spreading (Fig. 3e, f), and also 
blocked crosstalk without significantly affecting sLTP (ΔVsupra sustained = 66 ± 6%, 
ΔVsub sustained = 21 ± 6%) (Fig. 3h, i). Importantly, using this same strategy against Cdc42 
(the activity of which is compartmentalized in spines) had no effect on either sLTP or 
crosstalk (ΔVsupra sustained = 60 ± 7%, ΔVsub sustained = 56 ± 6%) (Fig. 3h, i), suggesting that 
this approach is only effective when targeting proteins with diffusive activation profiles. 
Taken together, these data suggest that the convergence of BDNF-dependent Rac1 signalling 
and BDNF-independent RhoA signalling at nearby spines primes these regions for 
facilitated structural plasticity.
To examine how crosstalk is achieved despite signal spreading conferring activation of only 
a subset of GTPases, we measured the activation of Rho GTPases in response to both 
unpaired and paired suprathreshold and subthreshold stimuli (Fig. 4a–d; see Extended Data 
Fig. 9a, b for response variability and Extended Data Figs 9c and 10 for volume curves of 
subthreshold stimuli). We found that both RhoA and Rac1, which show diffusive activity 
profiles, were only weakly activated by unpaired subthreshold stimuli (Fig. 4a, c). However, 
when paired with nearby suprathreshold stimuli, signal spreading supplied the crosstalk 
spines with additional Rac1 and RhoA activation (Fig. 4a, c, d). By contrast, Cdc42 was 
strongly activated by a subthreshold stimulus in both the unpaired and paired conditions, 
thus explaining how nearby spines achieve the required levels of Cdc42 activation during 
crosstalk (Fig. 4b, d). Thus, through a combination of low-threshold, spine-specific Cdc42 
activation and signal spreading of RhoA/Rac1 provided by nearby sLTP, Rho GTPase 
signalling complementation facilitates detection of weak synaptic activity proximal to sites 
of sLTP. Notably, a weak stimulus also caused a modest level of BDNF release (as measured 
by BDNF fused to the pH-sensitive fluorophore superecliptic pHluorin; BDNF–SEP) and 
TrkB activation, supporting the notion that this pathway is still functional during a weak 
stimulus (Extended Data Fig. 9d, e).
The compartmentalized nature of Cdc42 activity in spines probably serves to prevent 
nonspecific structural plasticity at nearby inactive synapses. Consistent with this model, 
stimulation of a single spine on cells expressing constitutively active (CA)-Cdc42 caused 
significant enlargement of surrounding, unstimulated spines (ΔVnearby sustained = 42 ± 11%) 
(Fig. 4e–g). This is in sharp contrast to control conditions, in which nearby spines show no 
average change in volume (ΔVnearby sustained = −2 ± 4%) (Fig. 4e–g). Importantly, sLTP in 
the stimulated spines was similar to that of control (Fig. 4e–g). Furthermore, when CA-
Cdc42 was co-expressed with W56–mCh–MTBD, sLTP in nearby spines was suppressed 
without affecting sLTP at the stimulated spines (ΔVnearby sustained = 3 ± 3%; ΔVstim sustained 
= 70 ± 13%) (Fig. 4e–g), suggesting that the heterosynaptic effects imparted by CA-Cdc42 
depend on Rac1 signal spreading. Thus, removing the compartmentalization of Cdc42

 activation degrades the input-specificity of sLTP, likely by complementing the typical 
priming effects of diffusive Rac1 and RhoA signals.
Collectively, our data suggest that simultaneous activation of Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA 
predicts the occurrence of sLTP, while activation of a subset of these proteins primes spines 
for sLTP (Fig. 4h). The activation of both Cdc42 and Rac1 required postsynaptic, autocrine 
BDNF, and conveyed the occurrence of sLTP over both spine-specific (Cdc42) and 
heterosynaptic (Rac1) domains. The spreading of BDNF–TrkB-mediated Rac1 signalling 
out of the stimulated spine was necessary for facilitating sLTP in nearby spines, consistent 
with the known pro-plasticity properties of BDNF22, 27, 28, 29. The spreading of BDNF-
independent RhoA activation was also necessary for synaptic crosstalk, suggesting that both 
BDNF-dependent and -independent signalling pathways must be coordinated to achieve this 
phenomenon. The combination of spine-specific, low-threshold Cdc42 activation together 
with diffusive, high-threshold RhoA and Rac1 activation is perfectly positioned to 
simultaneously achieve both spine-specific homosynaptic sLTP and facilitation of sLTP in 
surrounding spines. Thus, our model, based on the coincident activation of three small 
GTPase molecules Rac, Rho and Cdc42, together with the autocrine BDNF signalling, 
provides a unified theory for both homo- and heterosynaptic plasticity.

Reagents
Human recombinant BDNF was purchased from Millipore; d-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate 
(d-AP5) and NSC-23766 were from Tocris; 1′-naphthylmethyl-4-amino-1-tert-butyl-3-(p-
methylphenyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidine (1NMPP1) was from Santa Cruz and Shanghai 
Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences; and TrkB-Ig was a gift from 
Regeneron. The tat-CN21 peptide (YGRKKRRQRRRKRPPKLGQIGRSKRVVIEDDR) 
was synthesized by GenScript.
Animals
All animal procedures were approved by the Duke Univeristy School of Medicine Animal 
Care and Use Committee. Both male and female rats and mice were used. TrkbF616A mutant 
mice were provided by D. Ginty21. Bdnffl/fl and Trkbfl/fl were provided by L. Parada17, 36. 
Rac1fl/fl animals were acquired from C. Brakebusch30. The genotype of each animal was 
verified before and after preparing slices using PCR of genomic DNA isolated from tail 
DNA before and slice samples after.
Plasmids
Plasmids containing human RAC1 and PAK1(65–118) are gifts from M. Matsuda and S. 
Soderling, respectively. The Pak GTPase binding domain of PAK2 (PBD2) was prepared by 
introducing mutations L77P and S115L into PAK1(60–118) using a Site-Directed 
Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). W56–mCh–MTBD was prepared by amplifying the Rac1 
inhibitory peptide W56 (ref. 23) using overhang PCR with a C-terminal linker 
(GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGMADQLTEEWHRGTAGPGS) and inserting it 
into pCAG-mCh-mCh (ref. 3) by removing the first mCh with EcoRI and KpnI restriction

 digest and replacing it with the W56-linker amplicon, creating pCAG-W56-(linker)-mCh. In 
parallel, the MTBD of human MAP2 (272-end)25 was isolated from a human cDNA library 
and PCR amplification. This amplicon was then further amplified with overhang PCR to 
contain a linker (same as above), and then inserted into pCAG-mCh-mCh using BamHI-NotI 
restriction digest to produce pCAG-mCh-(Linker)-MTBD. The two constructs were then 
combined using BamHI plus NotI restriction digest to create pCAG-W56-(linker)-mCh-
(linker)-MTBD. The scrambled variant of W56–MTBD was created by randomly re-
ordering the residues of W56. ARHGAP15-mCh-MTBD was made by inserting 
ARHGAP15 (1–723; Addgene plasmid 38903) into the -mCh-MTBD sequence described 
above by adding EcoRI and KpnI sites at the N and C terminus, respectively.
DNRhoA and DNCdc42 variants of the X-mCh-MTBD construct were prepared by first 
incorporating an MfeI digestion site on the 3′ end of W56, then removing W56 by digestion 
with NheI/MfeI and insertion of the dominant-negative construct.
Preparation
Hippocampal slices were prepared from postnatal day 5–7 rats or mice in accordance with 
the animal care and use guidelines of Duke University Medical Centre. In brief, we deeply 
anaesthetized the animal with isoflurane, after which the animal was quickly decapitated and 
the brain removed. The hippocampi were isolated and cut into 350-μm sections using a 
McIlwain tissue chopper. Hippocampal slices were plated on tissue culture inserts (Millicell) 
fed by tissue medium (for 2.5 l: 20.95 g MEM, 17.9 g HEPES, 1.1 g NaHCO3, 5.8 g d-
glucose, 120 μl 25% ascorbic acid, 12.5 ml l-glutamine, 2.5 ml insulin, 500 ml horse serum, 
5 ml 1 M MgSO4, 2.5 ml 1 M CaCl2). Slices were incubated at 35 °C in 3% CO2.
After 1–2 weeks in culture, CA1 pyramidal neurons were transfected with ballistic gene 
transfer using gold beads (8–12 mg) coated with plasmids containing 30 μg of total cDNA 
(Rac1 sensor, donor:acceptor = 1:2; eGFP + W56–MTBD, 5:1; Rac1 sensor + W56–MTBD, 
donor:acceptor:inhibitor = 2:4:1; TrkB sensor, donor:acceptor = 1:1; Cdc42 sensor, 
donor:acceptor = 1:1; RhoA sensor, donor:acceptor = 1:1). Cells expressing only eGFP were 
imaged 1–5 days after transfection, cells expressing TrkB were imaged 1–2 days after 
transfection, and all other plasmid combinations were imaged 2–5 days after transfection.
For structural plasticity experiments, conditional knockout slices (Bdnffl/fl and Rac1fl/fl) 
were transfected with either eGFP alone or eGFP and tdTomato-Cre (1:1) for 3–7 days 
before imaging. For sensor experiments in these slices, the sensors were used in the ratios 
listed above with an amount of Cre recombinase equal to the amount of donor DNA. The 
presence of Cre was confirmed by nuclear-localized tdTomato signal.
HEK293T cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 
37 °C in 5% CO2. Transfection was performed at ~50–90% cell confluency using 
Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and 2 μg ml−1 of total cDNA/35 mm dish, following the ratios 
listed above. Cells were used as an expression platform only, and were thus not rigorously 
tested for potential contamination from other cell lines.

FRET imaging using a custom-built two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscope 
was performed as previously described3, 31, 32. Two-photon imaging was performed using a 
Ti-sapphire laser (MaiTai, Spectraphysics) tuned to a wavelength of 920 nm, allowing 
simultaneous excitation of eGFP and mCh. All samples were imaged using <2 mW laser 
power measured at the objective. Fluorescence emission was collected using an immersion 
objective (60×, numerical aperture 0.9, Olympus), divided with a dichroic mirror (565 nm), 
and detected with two separate photoelectron multiplier tubes (PMTs) placed downstream of 
two wavelength filters (Chroma, HQ510-2p to select for green and HQ620/90-2p to select 
for red). The green channel was fitted with a PMT having a low transfer time spread 
(H7422-40p; Hamamatsu) to allow for fluorescence lifetime imaging, while the red channel 
was fitted with a wide-aperture PMT (R3896; Hamamatsu). Photon counting for 
fluorescence lifetime imaging was performed using a time-correlated single photon counting 
board (SPC-150; Becker and Hickl) controlled with custom software31, while the red 
channel signal was acquired using a separate data acquisition board (PCI-6110) controlled 
with Scanimage software33.
Two-photon glutamate uncaging
A second Ti-sapphire laser tuned at a wavelength of 720 nm was used to uncage 4-
methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-caged-l-glutamate (MNI-caged glutamate) in extracellular solution 
with a train of 4–6 ms, 4–5 mW pulses (30 times at 0.5 Hz) near a spine of interest (‘sLTP 
stimulus’). Experiments were performed in Mg2+ fee artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF; 
127 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 4 mM CaCl2, 25 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4 and 25 
mM glucose) containing 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 4 mM MNI-caged l-glutamate 
aerated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 30 °C, as described previously. Subthreshold stimuli 
were delivered using a train of 1 ms, 4–5 mW pulses (30 times at 0.5 Hz). Crosstalk 
experiments were performed by first delivering an sLTP stimulus (4–6 ms), then delivering a 
subthreshold stimulus to a nearby (~2–5 μm) spine on the same dendrite ~90 s later, as 
previously described19. Anywhere from 1–5 spines were stimulated per cell, and a maximum 
of 3 crosstalk experiments were performed on a single cell.
Spine volume analysis
Spine volume was calculated as the background-subtracted integrated fluorescence intensity 
over a region of interest around the dendritic spine head (fluorescence, F). Change in spine 
volume was measured as F/F0, in which F0 is the average fluorescence intensity before 
stimulation. Analysis of two-photon images outside of the context of 2pFLIM was 
performed in ImageJ.
All experiments involving dendritic inhibitor constructs were performed in a blinded fashion 
until the experiments were complete (when the groups significantly diverged, or until 15–20 
individual experiments across at least three cells were complete, whichever came first).

 2pFLIM data analyses
To measure the fraction of donor bound to acceptor, we fit a fluorescence lifetime curve 
summing all pixels over a whole image with a double exponential function convolved with 
the Gaussian pulse response function:
(1)
where τAD is the fluorescence lifetime of donor bound with acceptor, PD and PAD are the 
fraction of free donor and donor bound with acceptor, respectively, and H(t) is a 
fluorescence lifetime curve with a single exponential function convolved with the Gaussian 
pulse response function:
in which τD is the fluorescence lifetime of the free donor, τG is the width of the Guassian 
pulse response function, F0 is the peak fluorescence before convolution and t0 is the time 
offset, and erfc is the error function.
We fixed τD to the fluorescence lifetime obtained from free eGFP (2.6 ns). To generate the 
fluorescence lifetime image, we calculated the mean photon arrival time, 〈t〉, in each pixel 
as:
then, the mean photon arrival time is related to the mean fluorescence lifetime, 〈τ〉, by an 
offset arrival time, t0, which is obtained by fitting the whole image:
For small regions-of-interest (ROIs) in an image (spines or dendrites), we calculated the 
binding fraction (PAD) as:
Measurements of the affinity between Rho GTPases and RBDs
Polyhistidine-tagged super-folder GFP (sfGFP)–Rac1, mCh-PBD2 and their mutants were 
cloned into the pRSET bacterial expression vector (Invitrogen). Proteins were overexpressed 
in Escherichia coli (DH5α), purified with a Ni+-nitrilotriacetate (NTA) column (HiTrap, GE 
Healthcare), and desalted with a desalting column (PD10, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 
PBS. The concentration of the purified protein was measured by the absorbance of the 
fluorophore (sfGFP, A489 nm = 83,000 cm−1 M−1 (ref. 34); mCh, A587 nm = 72,000 cm−1 
M−1 (ref. 35)).

 Purified sfGFP–Rac1 was loaded with GppNHp (2′,3′-O-N-methyl anthraniloyl-GppNHp) 
and GDP by incubating in the presence of tenfold molar excess of GppNHp and GDP in 
MgCl2-free PBS containing 1 mM EDTA for 10 min, respectively. The reaction was 
terminated by adding 10 mM MgCl2. sfGFP–Rac1 and mCh–PBD2 were mixed and 
incubated at room temperature for 20 min. FRET between sfGFP and mCh was measured 
under 2pFLIM, and the fraction of sfGFP–Rac1 bound to mCh–PDB2 was calculated by 
fitting the fluorescence lifetime curve with a double exponential function (equation (1)). The 
dissociation constant was obtained by fitting the relationship between the binding fraction 
and the concentration of mCh–PDB2 ([mCh–PDB2]) with a Michaelis–Menten function.
Statistical methods
Sample sizes for all experiments were chosen based on signal-to-noise ratios identified in 
pilot experiments.
The variances of all data were estimated and compared using Bartlett’s test or Levene’s test 
before further statistical analysis.
The distribution patterns of Rho GTPase sensor activity was determined by performing a 
Shapiro–Wilk test for normality on the peak response (the same points used for statistical 
comparisons). All of the sensors tested adhered to the null hypothesis, and thus are 
considered normally distributed. As such, parametric statistics were used to compare values 
of Rho GTPases response.
For multiple comparisons of sensor activity, data were first subjected to ANOVA, followed 
by a post-hoc test to determine statistical significance, according to the structure of the 
comparison being made. In cases where each condition is being compared to all other 
conditions in the group, the Tukey–Kramer method was used. In cases where each condition 
is being compared to a single control, Dunnet’s test was used instead.
To compare values of non-normally distribution changes in spine volume, data were log-
transformed to resolve skewness, then subjected to normal parametric statistics, as indicated 
in the figure legends. To support these statistical claims, non-parametric statistics were also 
applied to the original, non-transformed data using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test in place of t-
tests, and the Kruskal–Wallis procedure in place of ANOVA, followed by a post-hoc analysis 
using Dunn’s test. All of the data tested were significant by both of these approaches.
Data were only excluded if obvious signs of poor cellular health (for example, dendritic 
blebbing, spine collapse) were apparent.
Crosstalk experiments comparing different genetic perturbations were performed in a 
blinded fashion. Experimenters were unblinded when either statistical significance was 
reached, or when experimental number was comparable to similar experiments that had 
reached statistical significance.

 Extended Data
Extended Data Fig. 1. Design and characterization of the Rac1 sensor
a, Measurements of the affinity between sfGFP-Rac1 or sfGFP-Cdc42 and the p21-
activated-kinase-derived acceptor construct, Pak2(65-117)R71C,S78A. The binding fraction 
was measured using 2pFLIM (see Methods) across several concentrations of the acceptor 
construct. The dissociation constant was obtained by fitting the data (red) with a Michaelis-
Menten function (gray).
b. Representative fluorescence lifetime images of Rac1 sensor variants in HEK293T cells. 
Cells were transfected with a 1:2 donor:acceptor ratio of wild-type, dominant negative 
(Rac1T17N), substrate-binding dead (Rac1Y40C), or constitutively active (Rac1Q61L) variants 
of Rac1 with mCherry-PBD2R71C,S78A-mCherry. Some experiments included the addition of

donor:acceptor:GEF/GAP ratio. Cells were imaged 12–36 hours after transfection in a 
warmed solution containing 30mM Na_HEPES(pH 7.3), 130mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1mM 
CaCl2, 1mM MgCl2, 2mM NaHCO3, 1.25mM NaH2PO4, and 25mM glucose. Warmer 
colors indicate a lower fluorescence lifetime value/higher binding fraction of mEGFP-Rac1 
to the acceptor construct. Scale bars represent 50μm.
c. Basal binding fraction of Rac1-PBD2R71C, S78A for the conditions listed in (b). Error bars 
represent s.e.m. Asterisks represent a statistically significant difference from the Rac1(wt) 
control condition as determined by ANOVA followed by post-hoc tests using the least 
significant difference (p < 0.0001).
d. Time course of Rac1 activation in HEK293T cells upon application of 100 μg/mL 
epidermal growth factor (EGF). Control (Ctrl) experiment corresponds to mEGFP-Rac1 
(donor)+mCherry-PBD2R71C,S78A-mCherry (acceptor) expression alone (n = 39 cells/
8plates), Rac1T17N (n = 33 cells/4 plates) and Rac1Y40C (n = 40 cells/5 plates) corresponds 
to the expression of the donor variant with the acceptor in the same ratio as controls, and 
Rac1+W56 corresponds to the expression of the wild-type donor with the acceptor and the 
Rac1 inhibitory peptide W56.

Rac1 using photo-activatable GFP (paGFP). (left) Representative 2p images of paGFP-
Rac1Q61L in a single dendritic spine after photo-activation. While active Rac1 shows a 
slightly slower diffusion that Rac1(wt) (middle), both Rac1Q61L and Rac1(wt) diffuse away 
from the spine with approximately equal diffusion time constants (right two plots; wt: n = 41 
spines/4 cells; Rac1Q61L: 67 spines/7 cells).
d. Pharmacological characterization of Rac1 signal during sLTP. Rac1 activation in control

the NMDA receptor blocker APV (APV; 100μM; n = 6 cells/13 spines), and in the presence 
of the cell-permeable CaMKII inhibitory peptide tatCN21 (CN21; 10μM; n = 5 cells/11 
spines). Error bars represent s.e.m.

ΔBF = 0.026±0.05) phases of Rac1 activation during sLTP. Error bars represent s.e.m. 
Asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference as determined by an independent 
samples t-test (p<0.05).
g. Effects of near-physiological temperature of Rac1 sensor activation. Perfusion was 
warmed with a heating block holding the ACSF container, and the temperature measured at 
the back of the perfusion chamber. (RT = room temperature, n = 102 cells/121 spines; for 
30–32°C, n = 11 cells/13 spines). Error bars represent s.e.m.
h. Variability of unstimulated spine volume changes after the induction of sLTP in a nearby 
spine in Rac1 sensor-overexpressing neurons. Data shown are timecourses of unstimulated 
spines close to the site of sLTP induction. While there is no average change in nearby spine 
volume with this stimulus (Fig. 1c, Main Text), there is occasional enlargement or shrinkage. 
Data corresponds to 100 randomly selected spines from the total of 777 nearby spines 
measured for the average depicted in Fig. 1c.
i. Transient (1–2min) change in volume of nearby spines as a function of distance from the 
stimulated spine. Data correspond to all nearby spines measured for the experiments in 
which the spatial profile of Rac1 was measured (n = 56 cells/79 experiments/218 nearby 
spines; Fig 1e, Main Text). Inset equation corresponds to the linear model of best fit.
j. Same as (i), but for the sustained (10–20 min) change in volume of nearby spines.

or volume of the spine with glutamate uncaging (c and d, respectively), the basal binding 
fraction of the sensor (e), or the change in binding fraction in the dendrite in response to 
uncaging (f). Rac1 sensor concentration was estimated by making a standard curve of the 
intensity values known concentrations of mEGFP at a range of imaging powers. The 
estimated endo-Rac1 concentration is plotted with a dashed line for comparison.

 Figure 1. The Rho GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 convey postsynaptic BDNF–TrkB signalling across 
both homosynaptic and heterosynaptic domains
a, Schematic of Rac1 sensor. Monomeric enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) is N-
terminally tagged to Rac1 to preserve C-terminal membrane association. GTP binding leads 
to association with the Pak GTPase binding domain of PAK2R71C,S78A (PBD2; blue lines 
denote mutations), bringing the mCherry (mCh) fluorophores within the FRET distance of 
eGFP, decreasing its fluorescence lifetime.

single spine with two-photon glutamate uncaging (white arrowhead). Scale bar, 1 μm.
c, Time course of spine volume changes during sLTP induced with two-photon glutamate 
uncaging (grey window) in the stimulated spine (black) and compared to adjacent spines 
(green). n = 102 cells/121 spines.

crosstalk
a, Comparison of Rac1 activation in response to unpaired (left; suprathreshold (black) n =

 d, Summary of data from a–c. Bars represent average peak activity. For unpaired conditions, 
the peak is the average of the first 2 min following uncaging. For paired conditions, the peak 
for suprathreshold spines corresponds to the first 2 min after the stimulus, while the peak of 
the crosstalk spines was based on the timing of maximal response for each GTPase (Rac1 
and Cdc42: 1–2 min after the second stimulus; RhoA: 1–2 min after the first stimulus) to 
account for signal spreading. *P < 0.05, analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey–
Kramer’s post-hoc test.
e, Top, representative two-photon images of the effect of expressing CA-Cdc42 on the spine-
specificity of sLTP. Yellow arrows mark non-targeted spines that increased in intensity after 
uncaging at the target (red circle) spine. The green arrow represents a new spine. Bottom, 
representative images of a typical sLTP experiment in which there is no heterosynaptic effect 
of uncaging. Image size, 12 × 12 μm.
f, Quantification of the average change in nearby (<~5 μm) spine volume after glutamate 
uncaging in control (black curve; n = 13 cells/13 targeted spines/112 neighbouring spines), 
CA-Cdc42-expressing (green curve; n = 9 cells/14 targeted spines/102 neighbouring spines), 
and CA-Cdc42- plus W56–mCh–MTBD-expressing (red curve; n = 5 cells/11 targeted 
spines/78 neighbouring spines) cells.
g, Summary of data in f. *P < 0.05, ANOVA with Tukey–Kramer’s test.
h, Proposed model. Calcium through NDMARs from a strong stimulus activates CaMKII, 
supporting autocrine BDNF–TrkB signalling, and conferring actin cytoskeleton remodelling 
through Rac1 and Cdc42. In parallel, CaMKII-dependent RhoA activation also acts on the 
actin cytoskeleton. The combination of the three GTPases is necessary to produce sLTP. 
Rac1 and RhoA activity spread out of the stimulated spine into the dendrite and surrounding 
spines, which is insufficient to produce sLTP. However, even a weak stimulus (red dotted 
line), can cause sufficient BDNF release to activate Cdc42, complementing the activity of 
Rac1 and RhoA and allowing synaptic crosstalk.
