The transcription factor BMAL1 is a core component of the molecular clock, regulating
biological pathways that drive 24 h (circadian) rhythms in behaviour and physiology. The
molecular clock has a profound influence on innate immune function, and circadian disruption
is linked with increased incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the mechanisms
underlying this association are unknown. Here we show that BMAL1 and time-of-day regulate
the accumulation and activation of various immune cells in a CNS autoimmune disease
model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In myeloid cells, BMAL1 main-
tains anti-inflammatory responses and reduces T cell polarization. Loss of myeloid BMAL1 or
midday immunizations to induce EAE create an inflammatory environment in the CNS
through expansion and infiltration of IL-1β-secreting CD11b+Ly6Chi monocytes, resulting in
increased pathogenic IL-17+/IFN-γ+ T cells. These findings demonstrate the importance of
the molecular clock in modulating innate and adaptive immune crosstalk under autoimmune
conditions.

ife follows a 24 h rhythm driven by the daily cycles of light
and dark due to the earth’s rotation. The molecular clock is
the timekeeping system within all our cells that integrates
many aspects of our behaviour and physiology to align with these
external rhythmic changes. The master clock resides in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain and promotes syn-
chrony of rhythms throughout the body by signalling to per-
ipheral clocks1, such as in the liver2, heart2, muscle3, immune
system4, 5, intestine6 and even the microbiota7.
The SCN clock keeps peripheral clocks in harmony via the
hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis and the autonomic nervous
system through their respective hormones, glucocorticoids and
catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine). These hor-
mones act as synchronizing messengers, or zeitgebers, to peripheral
clocks8, 9. In addition to glucocorticoids and catecholamines, other
hormones such as prolactin and growth hormone that are known
to affect the immune system, also peak at certain times of the day.
The control by the SCN on these autonomic and endocrine outputs
keeps peripheral clocks, including that of immune cells, in phase
with each other and allows for the coordination of a temporal
programme of physiology across many tissues10.
These peripheral clocks can also be influenced independently
by cues such as fasting or feeding11. Coordination of these cir-
cadian
rhythms
relies
on
a
number
of
transcriptional-
translational feedback loops of core clock proteins. Most impor-
tant amongst them is the basic helix–loop–helix PAS (bHLH-
PAS) transcription factor BMAL1 (also known as ARNTL or
MOP3), which forms a heterodimer with another bHLH-PAS
transcription factor, appropriately named CLOCK (circadian
locomotor output cycles kaput). The BMAL1:CLOCK hetero-
dimer binds to E-box sequences on the genome and controls the
transcriptional repressors Period and Cryptochrome. Inhibition
in the dark phase of BMAL1:CLOCK by the nuclear accumula-
tion of the PERIOD:CRYPTOCHROME complex allows for cir-
cadian oscillations in BMAL1:CLOCK activity on the gene
promoters of thousands of downstream targets, classified as clock
control genes (CCG). Bmal1−/− cells lack a functional molecular
clock and all rhythms in clock gene expression and CCGs are
ablated12.
It has been established that a functional clock exists in mac-
rophages5, 13, 14 and that this clock has a major function in
susceptibility to bacterial infection15, 16, endotoxin challenge17, 18
and cardiovascular disease19. Monocyte sub-populations are
influenced by their intrinsic molecular clock such that the
numbers of circulating CD11b+ and Ly6Chi monocytes vary
across the 24 h cycle5, 16. Loss of BMAL1 in the myeloid lineage
promotes
increased
numbers
and
trafficking
of
the
pro-
inflammatory
Ly6Chi
monocytes
into
tissues
and
causes
enhanced lethality upon Listeria monocytogenes infection16.
Overall, loss of Bmal1 in myeloid cells causes increased inflam-
matory responses20, correlating with increased IL-1β and IFN-γ
production5, 16 and reduced expression of the anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-1017.
For adaptive immunity, circadian oscillations of CCGs have
been observed in T and B cells. Regulation of the adaptor protein
ZAP70, which controls antigen-induced T cell proliferation, is
regulated in a circadian manner, leading to T cell responses that
are dependent on time-of-day21. Furthermore, there appears to be
subset-specific requirements for clock genes in T helper cell
development, with the loss of the clock component Nfil3 (also
known as E4bp4), leading to enhanced Th17 responses but not
Treg cell development22.
Intriguingly, there is an association between the circadian
system and the immune-mediated demyelinating disorder, mul-
tiple sclerosis (MS). A large population-based study identified
that teenagers conducting shiftwork, which causes circadian
disruption, have an increased risk in the development of MS in
later life23. Furthermore, incidences of relapse in MS occur most
frequently in spring and summer, an observation attributed to
lower levels of the clock-regulated hormone melatonin24.
There are conflicting reports on the expression of Bmal1 in
T cells and function of Bmal1 in the development of experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model for MS.
Hemmers et al.25 showed that there is no effect on development of
disease in T cell-specific Bmal1 knockout mice, but Druzd et al.26,
in a more comprehensive analysis, reported that loss of Bmal1 in
T cells affects the severity of EAE. In addition to T cells, myeloid
lineage cells also have a pathogenic function in EAE27, 28. Myeloid
cells migrate across the blood–brain barrier during EAE29 and
secrete IL-130, 31 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF)32 to modulate the development of EAE.
Therefore, we hypothesized that BMAL1 expression and the
molecular clock in myeloid cells might be important in CNS
autoimmune disease through modulation of innate immunity.
Here we show that mice lacking myeloid Bmal1 and mice
immunized at midday develop enhanced EAE diseases through
expansion and infiltration of IL-1β-secreting CD11b+Ly6Chi
monocytes into the CNS. Our results provide new opportunities
to enhance circadian function or time-of-day drug-targeting
strategies to alleviate autoimmune disease.
Results
Loss of myeloid Bmal1 induces pro-inflammatory cytokines.
Loss of Bmal1 from Lyz2 lineage cells, which include monocytes,
has been shown to enhance the numbers of Ly6C+ monocytes and
production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IFN-γ,
leading to increased lethality in a model of septic shock16. We
found that the Th1-polarizing cytokine IL-12p40 was significantly
enhanced under basal conditions in the serum of Bmal1LoxP/
LoxPLyz2Cre (Bmal1Myeloid−/−) mice when compared with control
Lyz2Cre
(Bmal1Myeloid+/+)
mice
(Fig.
1a)
(p < 0.001,
Mann–Whitney U test).
We next examined GM-CSF or M-CSF-induced differentiation
of bone marrow (BM)-derived cells from Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice
and Bmal1Myeloid+/+ controls. While GM-CSF stimulation of BM
cells expanded a CD11b+CD11chiMHCIIhi population, M-CSF
stimulation increased the frequency of CD11b+CD11clo/intF4/80+
cells (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We confirmed that GM-CSF and
M-CSF
expanded
cells
from
the
bone
marrow
of
Bmal1Myeloid−/− were indeed devoid of Bmal1 (Supplementary
Fig. 1b, c). Interestingly, CD11c+ cells isolated from the spleen of
Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice did not appear to be of the Lyz2 lineage;
these cells displayed similar levels of Bmal1 in comparison with
cells isolated from Bmal1Myeloid+/+ mice (Supplementary Fig. 1d).
We found that GM-CSF-expanded BM cells produced higher
concentrations of IL-1β, IL-23, but not IL-10 in response to
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), when compared with cells
from
Bmal1Myeloid+/+
controls
(Fig.
1b)
(p < 0.01,
Mann–Whitney U test), however no significant increase in these
cytokines was observed in MTB-stimulated M-CSF-expanded BM
from Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice (Supplementary Fig. 2). Surface
expression of MHCII was higher on GM-CSF-expanded BM
cells
from
Bmal1Myeloid−/−
mice
(Fig.
1c)
(p < 0.01,
Mann–Whitney U test). Interestingly, not only were inflamma-
tory pathways enhanced in the absence of Bmal1 in CD11b+ cells,
there was also a loss of the immune checkpoint inhibitors PD-L1
(p < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U test) but not PD-L2, on MHCII+
CD11b+CD11c+ cells from Bmal1Myeloid−/− compared with
Bmal1Myeloid+/+ mice (Fig. 1d). Given that the loss of Bmal1
from GM-CSF-expanded BM cells significantly increased the
expression of IL-12p40, IL-1β and IL-23, cytokines associated

 with the polarization of T helper cells into either Th1 or Th17
cells, we next examined whether loss of Bmal1 from Lyz2 lineage
cells would result in expansion of these T cell subsets. Co-culture
of GM-CSF-expanded BM cells with MOG-specific CD4 T cells,
isolated from Bmal1Myeloid+/+ mice 7 d after immunization with
MOG + CFA, produced higher concentrations of IFN-γ when the
BM was derived from Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice (Fig. 1e) (p < 0.05,
Mann–Whitney U test). In contrast, there was no significant
difference in antigen-specific T cell responses after co-culture
with M-CSF-expanded BM cells from Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice
compared to Bmal1Myeloid+/+ mice (Supplementary Fig. 3) (p <

from
Bmal1Myeloid+/+ mice, produced significantly more antigen-
specific IL-17 and IFN-γ when compared with CD4 T cells
isolated from MOG-immunized Bmal1Myeloid+/+ mice (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4, p < 0.01, Mann–Whitney U test). These results
indicate that the absence of Bmal1 from myeloid cells results in a
hyper-inflammatory environment leading to enhanced Th1 and
Th17 responses.
Myeloid Bmal1 attenuates the development of EAE. We next
examined whether loss of Bmal1 from myeloid lineage cells
influenced the development of EAE, where Th1 and Th17 as well
as Ly6C+ cells have been implicated in the development of dis-
ease29, 31. Immunization of Bmal1Myeloid−/− and Bmal1Myeloid+/+
mice with MOG + CFA and low dose of pertussis toxin (PT) led to
the development of EAE in these mice (Fig. 2a). The lower dose PT
led to less severe disease, however, mice lacking Bmal1 from
myeloid cells had a significantly more severe course of disease than
Bmal1Myeloid+/+ mice. Low dose PT was used in all subsequent
experiments between Bmal1Myeloid−/− and Bmal1Myeloid+/+ mice.
The increased severity of EAE in the Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice cor-
related with an increased pro-inflammatory environment in the
CNS of these mice. We found significantly increased mRNA
expression of Il1b, Ifng, Ccl2 (p < 0.01, Mann–Whitney U test) and
Il17 (p < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U test) in the brains of Bmal1Myeloid
−/− mice with EAE when compared with controls (Fig. 2b). Dys-
regulation of pro-inflammatory responses in the Bmal1Myeloid−/−
mice occurred rapidly after the induction of EAE. We found
enhanced numbers of CD11b+Ly6Chi cells in the draining lymph
nodes (LN) 3 days post immunization with MOG and CFA
(Fig. 2c) (p < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U test), and significantly
increased numbers of MHCII+ cells in these mice compared with
controls (Fig. 2d) (p < 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test).
We next isolated infiltrating mononuclear cells from the spinal
cords on d 10 post immunization with MOG + CFA and low dose
PT and examined whether loss of Bmal1 from the myeloid
compartment affected the cellular infiltrate into the CNS. We
found significantly more CNS infiltrating immune cells in
Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice compared with Bmal1Myeloid+/+ mice.
There were increases in the numbers and percentages of CD45+
cells (Fig. 3a) as well as CD11b+Ly6Chi cells (Fig. 3b). We found
that the Ly6ChiCCR2+ cells, which infiltrate the brain during
EAE, were entirely CD11b+ (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b), indicating
that CD11b+Ly6ChiCCR2+ cells are important for the develop-
ment of EAE.
The frequency and absolute numbers of CD11b+Ly6Chi cells
was enhanced in the CNS of Bmal1Myeloid−/− compared with
control mice (Fig. 3b). This population has been identified as one
of the key cell populations crossing the blood–brain barrier and
producing IL-1β and mediating neuroinflammation leading to the
development of EAE29. Indeed we found enhanced numbers of
CD11b+Ly6Chi cells producing IL-1β in the spinal cord (Fig. 3c)
(p < 0.01, Mann–Whitney U test) and brain (Supplementary
Fig. 5d) of Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice with EAE compared with
controls. Furthermore, there was an increase in the percentage of
IL-1β production by these CD11b+Ly6Chi cells, indicating that
not only are there enhanced numbers of these cells entering the
CNS of Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice, but that they produce significantly
more IL-1β in the CNS, compared to the same cells which enter
the CNS of Bmal1Mye+/+ mice. In addition, the CD11b+Ly6Chi
population is responsible for significant IL-1β production in the
CNS of mice with EAE (Fig. 3d) (p < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U
test).
The increased infiltration of inflammatory populations of cells
into the brains and enhanced severity of EAE in Bmal1Myeloid−/−
mice correlated with enhanced MOG-specific T cell responses.
LN cells from mice on d 14 of EAE secreted GM-CSF, IFN-γ and
IL-17, but not IL-10, in response to re-stimulation with MOG
in vitro (Fig. 4a). The concentrations of these cytokines was
significantly higher in cells derived from Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice
compared with Bmal1Myeloid+/+ mice (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001,
Mann–Whitney U test). Flow cytometry analysis revealed that
there were significantly increased numbers of CD3 T cells, where
Bmal1 was depleted, particularly CD4 T cells entering the CNS of
Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice compared with controls (Fig. 4b–d)
(p < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U test). Consistent with these data,
we demonstrated significantly enhanced infiltration of IL-17+ and
IFN-γ+ cells into the brains of Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice compared to
controls (Fig. 4e) (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U test).
Collectively our findings demonstrate that loss of Bmal1 in
myeloid cells is associated with enhanced innate and adaptive
immune responses and a more severe course of CNS autoimmune
disease.
Bmal1 and Reverbα inversely correlates with inflammation. We
compared spinal cords from mice with severe EAE with naive
control mice and found significantly less Bmal1 and Reverbα (a
target gene of BMAL1 and core clock component) mRNA
expression in the mice with severe EAE (Fig. 5a) (p < 0.01,
Mann–Whitney U test). This dysregulation was specific for these
two core clock components as the levels of Clock and Per2 were
not significantly altered in mice with EAE when compared with
naive control mice, demonstrating that the circadian feedback
loops are disrupted during development of EAE. When mice were
immunized with CFA and PT, without MOG, we did not observe
this decrease expression of Bmal1 and Reverbα mRNA in the
spinal cord, indicating that the effects on clock gene expression
are specific to EAE and not due to systemic inflammation
(Supplementary Fig. 6). The decrease in Bmal1 and Reverbα
mRNA expression correlated with increases in Ccl2, Il1b and Csf2
gene expression in the spinal cord of mice with EAE (Fig. 5b) (p
< 0.01 and p < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U test). Crucially, we also
found that loss of Bmal1 expression in the spinal cord sig-
nificantly correlated with an increase in the severity of EAE
(Fig. 5c) (p < 0.001, linear regression).
Fig. 1 Loss of myeloid Bmal1 increases pro-inflammatory responses. a Sera from naive Bmal1Myeloid+/+ and Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice were tested by ELISA for
IL-12p40 (n = 7–9). b Bone marrow (BM) cells isolated from Bmal1Myeloid+/+ or Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice was cultured with granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (20 ng/ml). After 6 days cells were harvested and stimulated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) (100 µg/ml).
Supernatants were removed at 24 h and tested by ELISA for cytokine production. c, d Day 6 GM-CSF-expanded BM cells from Bmal1Myeloid+/+ and
Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice were stained for MHCII, PD-L1 or PD-L2 gating on CD11b+CD11c+ cells (n = 6). e BM cells from either Bmal1Myeloid+/+ and Bmal1Myeloid
−/− mice was grown in the presence of GM-CSF. After 6 days cells were harvested and incubated with MTB (100 µg/ml) or myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein (MOG35–55) (25 µg/ml) + MTB for 3 h prior to the addition of MACS purified CD4+ T cells isolated from draining lymph node (LN) of 7 d
MOG + complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) immunized Bmal1Myeloid+/+ mice. After 72 h of co-culture supernatants were removed and IFN-γ and IL-17
concentrations determined by ELISA (n = 5–6). Statistics were performed by Mann–Whitney U test b–e. All data presented as means±standard error of the
mean (SEM). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001

 Effect of time-of-day immunization on severity of EAE. In the
mouse facility, Zeitgeber time is a measure of time (hours) after
lights go on; ZT0 corresponds to Zeitgeber time 0 and lights on
whereas ZT12 corresponds to Zeitgeber time 12, lights off. We
found that LN cells taken from mice at ZT6 produced higher
concentrations of IL-1β when compared with LN cells taken at
ZT18 after stimulation for 24 h with MTB or medium (Fig. 6a) (p
< 0.05, Mann–Whitney U test). There was no difference in MTB-
induced TNF at ZT6 compared to ZT18. This correlated with
diurnal oscillations in the numbers of CD11b+Ly6Chi cells in the
spleen peaking at ZT6 (Supplementary Fig. 7a), no diurnal var-
iation was observed for CD11c+MHCII+ although it was pre-
viously shown that gene expression in CD11c+MHCII+ and
macrophage populations peaks at ZT613.
We examined whether the time-of-day at point of immuniza-
tion with MOG and CFA would affect the course of EAE. We
found that the course of disease was significantly more severe in
wild-type
mice
immunized
at
ZT6
(Fig.
6b)
(p < 0.05,
Kruskal–Wallis test and Mann–Whitney test of area under the
curve), equating to middle of daylight hours, compared with mice
immunized at ZT18. We confirmed this trend, using mice that
had the light/dark schedule inverted using a light cabinet, in
which ZT6 and ZT18 mice and ZT0 and ZT12 mice were
immunized at the same solar time to minimize any experimental
error associated with the preparation or storage of the MOG and
CFA emulsion (Supplementary Fig. 7b). We then induced EAE in
Bmal1Myeloid+/+ vs. Bmal1Myeloid−/− at ZT6 and ZT18. Consistent
with our earlier data, we observed more severe disease in
Bmal1Myeloid+/+ mice immunized at ZT6 compared with ZT18
(Fig. 6c). Strikingly, mice lacking Bmal1 in myeloid cells no
longer displayed this time-of-day difference, with a similar
clinical course of EAE when induced at ZT6 and Z18 (Fig. 6c)
(p < 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis U test and Mann–Whitney test of area
under the curve). Taken together, these results clearly demon-
strate an impact of clock time on induction of disease in the EAE
model, even though clinical signs take a week or longer to appear,
and that the myeloid clock is responsible for this time-of-day
effect.
We next examined the peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) from
mice immunized either at ZT6 or ZT18 to determine if time of
immunization influenced innate immune cell accumulation and
IL-1β production. We found that mice immunized at ZT6 had
higher
numbers
and
percentages
of
CD11b+
populations,
including Ly6Chi and Ly6G+, compared to both naive and
ZT18-immunized mice (Fig. 6d). Furthermore, there were
significantly more IL-1β-producing Ly6G+ cells when mice were

Mann–Whitney U test). The number of IL-1β-producing Ly6C+
cells were also increased, though not significantly, in mice
immunized at ZT6 compared with ZT18 (Fig. 6e). These findings
indicate that the increase in disease severity after immunization at
ZT6 compared with ZT18 can be attributed to enhanced
accumulation of inflammatory monocytes and increased IL-1β
production, similar to that observed in Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice.

 Discussion
The significant finding of this study is that expression of the clock
gene Bmal1 and time-of-day in myeloid cells regulates the innate
and adaptive immune responses that mediate autoimmune dis-
eases. We demonstrate that mice with a targeted deletion of
Bmal1 from myeloid cells have significantly enhanced pro-
inflammatory and T cell-polarizing cytokine responses, resulting
in heightened inflammation and enhanced susceptibility to the
induction of autoimmune disease.
There is growing evidence of the influence of the molecular
clock and time-of-day on immune function. Shift workers, fre-
quent air travellers and populations at greater risk of circadian
disruption have an increased incidence of chronic inflammatory
disease33. Furthermore, animal models of jet-lag display an
increase in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular
IL-1β34 and in mice the circadian clock directly controls
inflammatory arthritis35. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis dis-
play a peak in disease severity in the early morning as a result of
an enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production at this time,
which may reflect lower levels of clock-regulated cortisol36.
Modulation of cellular homing26, 37 or clock control of toll-like
receptor expression38 provide alternative explanations for this
time-of-day effect. There is also emerging evidence that the
macrophage molecular clock has profound influence on epige-
netic control of the inflammatory response39.
It has been reported that deletion of the core clock gene Bmal1
from cells of the Lyz2 lineage causes an expansion of Ly6Chi
monocytes, and is associated with increase inflammatory cytokine
production and enhanced lethality in a sepsis model16. These
findings suggest an anti-inflammatory role for Bmal1 in this cell

 population. Furthermore, we have previously shown that lipo-
polysaccharide
(LPS)-activation
of
macrophages
suppressed
Bmal1
mRNA
expression
via
the
microRNA
MiR-15517,
demonstrating that noxious stimuli may inhibit the molecular
clock to promote a pro-inflammatory environment.
Consistent with previous reports that loss of Bmal1 from
myeloid cells causes a hyper-inflammatory environment16, 19, we
found significantly increased production of the pro-inflammatory
Th1-polarizing cytokine IL-12p40 in the serum of mice lacking
myeloid Bmal1. In addition, loss of Bmal1 from GM-CSF-
expanded BM cells significantly enhanced MHC class II expres-
sion along with IL-1β and IL-23 in response to MTB. Consistent
with the enhanced MHC class II expression on T cells and pro-
duction of T cell-polarizing cytokines by myeloid cells, we found
that the GM-CSF-expanded BM cells from mice that lacked
Bmal1-induced significantly more IFN-γ production by MOG-
specific
T
cells.
While
loss
of
Bmal1
enhanced
pro-inflammatory responses, it did not affect production of the
anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, although reduced expression
of IL-10 has been observed in M-CSF expanded BM cells from
Bmal1Myeloid−/− in response to LPS17, indicating that the clock is
modulating responses that are both cell and stimulation specific.
Furthermore, expression of the immune checkpoint protein
PD-L1 was significantly decreased on CD11b+CD11c+ cells from
Bmal1Myeloid−/− mice.
The neuroinflammation observed in mice with EAE is thought
to be mediated by adaptive immune cells, especially autoantigen-
specific Th1 and Th17 that contribute to demyelination31, 40.
However, there have been conflicting reports on the role for
Bmal1 expression in CD4 T cells and the development of EAE31,
40. It has been shown that Bmal1 expression in CD4 T cells can
influence the development of EAE only if immunization occurs at
a time-of-day corresponding to high numbers of both innate and
adaptive cells residing in LNs26. However, EAE was attenuated in
mice which had T cells lacking Bmal1, indicating that Bmal1 is
specifically protective in the myeloid lineage for autoimmunity.
Other cell subsets, such as innate immune cells, have also been
shown to be crucial for the development of EAE, especially
inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils that home to the CNS
and produce IL-1β29. IL-1β plays a critical role in neuroin-
flammation through synergy with IL-23 to promote expansion of
Th17 and IL-17-secreting γδ T cells41. Furthermore, it has been
shown that there is higher IL-1β expressed in peritoneal macro-
phages isolated at ZT6 compared to ZT1813. We demonstrate that
the severity of EAE was enhanced in mice lacking Bmal1 from
myeloid cells. The increase in disease severity correlated with
significant infiltration of inflammatory monocytes, especially
Ly6ChiCD11b+ cells which produce IL-1β during the course of
EAE. Furthermore, we found that the targeted loss of Bmal1 from
myeloid cells resulted in enhanced MOG-specific Th1 and Th17
responses
and
increased
IL-17,
IFN-γ
and
GM-CSF-producing T cells in the CNS of mice with EAE.
Our findings suggest that there is dysregulation of clock genes
during the inflammation that causes autoimmune disease of the
CNS. Indeed we show the selective reduction in mRNA expres-
sion of Bmal1 and Reverba, but not Period2 or Cryptochrome2, in
the CNS of mice with EAE. At the height of EAE, the loss of
Bmal1 was associated with significantly enhanced IL-17, IFN-γ
and IL-1β production in the CNS. Autoimmune and degen-
erative/inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis can impact directly on molecular clock expression,
thus potentially driving to a vicious cycle of inflammation42.
Furthermore, we found diurnal oscillations in the number of
inflammatory cells of the innate and adaptive immune system,
suggesting that time-of-day can determine the magnitude of the
immune response, consistent with a previous published report26.
Indeed, therapeutic strategies which incorporate alignment to
circadian rhythms, such as alignment of prednisolone adminis-
tration to the endogenous circadian rhythm of cortisol, has
proved efficacious in treating rheumatoid arthritis43. Vaccine-
induced immune responses are also dependent on the clock; sleep
after vaccination enhanced the Th1 responses induced by a
hepatitis A vaccine44, 45. It appears that the adaptive immune
response and induction of immunological memory is enhanced
during the sleep phase. Another vaccine study involving TLR9 as
the adjuvant reported that the time of vaccination influenced the
adaptive immune responses assessed weeks later38. We found that
immunization of mice with MOG and CFA during daylight hours
and the rest period of the mouse, induced more robust EAE when
compared to immunization of mice at night, with the effect on the
course of disease manifesting weeks after immunization. The
enhanced severity of EAE in mice immunized at ZT6 correlated

 with a hyper-inflammatory response, including enhanced num-
bers of inflammatory monocytes and IL-1β production. Sig-
nificantly, we found that this time-of-day rhythmicity was
dependent on the myeloid clock as the time-of-day response was
lost in animals lacking myeloid Bmal1. Druzd et al.26 also
demonstrated that the time-of-day response was ablated with
Bmal1 depletion in CD4 T cells, indicating that both the myeloid
and lymphoid clock influences this response.
Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the myeloid mole-
cular clock and circadian rhythms can influence the development
of autoimmune disease. Bmal1 expression and a functional
molecular clock in myeloid lineage cells appears to regulate these
temporal variations, yielding a less pro-inflammatory environ-
ment overall. Our data provide mechanistic insights into how
time-of-day and clock disruption in myeloid cells impacts on
autoimmunity thus providing opportunities to enhance circadian
function or time-of-day drug-targeting strategies to alleviate
autoimmune disease.
Methods
Mice. All mice were maintained according to European Union regulations and the
Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority. Experiments were performed under
Health Products Regulatory Authority license with approval from the Trinity
College Dublin BioResources Ethics Committee. Female C57BL/6 wild-type mice
were bred in house from established colonies. All mice were housed under specific
pathogen-free conditions and euthanised humanely by carbon dioxide.
Gene-modified animals. Mice with the gene Bmal1-containing LoxP sites at either
side of exon 8 were obtained from Jackson Labs (stock no. 007668). Bmal1LoxP/LoxP
were crossed with Lyz2Cre, which express Cre recombinase under the control of the
Lyz2 promoter (which encodes LysozymeM) to produce progeny that have Bmal1

 excised in the myeloid lineage (monocytes, macrophages and granulocytes). Female
Bmal1LoxP/LoxPLyz2Cre (Bmal1Myeloid−/−) mice where compared with control
female Lyz2Cre (Bmal1Myeloid+/+). Offspring were genotyped to confirm the pre-
sence of LoxP sites and Cre recombinase.
Induction and assessment of EAE. EAE was induced in 6–8 week old female
C57BL/6, Bmal1Myeloid−/− and Bmal1Myeloid+/+ mice by subcutaneous (s.c.)
immunization with MOG35–55 peptide (150 µg/mouse; Genscript) emulsified in
complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA; Condrex) containing 4 mg/ml heat-killed MTB.
Mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 200 ng/mouse pertussis toxin (PT;
Kaketsuken), unless otherwise stated, on d0 and d2. No PT was given to mice
where draining LN were taken on d 3 post immunization. For the “time-of-day”
EAE immunization, 6–8 week-old female C57BL/6 mice were immunized at either
ZT0 (8.00 a.m.), ZT6 (2.00 p.m.), ZT12 (8.00 p.m.) or ZT18 (2.00 a.m.) or their
time-of-day was adjusted using a light cabinet so that ZT0 and ZT12 both corre-
sponded to 9am and ZT6 and ZT18 both corresponded to 3.00 p.m. Light cabinet
adjusted mice were allowed to acclimatize to the change in light/dark schedule for
at least 2 weeks before immunization. MOG + CFA emulsion was made up 3 weeks
prior to immunization to ensure that each group of mice received a standard
immunization. Draining LN cells were isolated on d 14 of EAE and re-stimulated
ex vivo with medium or with MOG35–55 antigen (25 or 50 µg/ml) for 3 d and the
final 4 h in the presence of PMA (Sigma-Aldrich, 10 ng/ml), ionomycin (Sigma-
Aldrich, 1 μg/ml) and brefeldin A (10 μg/ml). Supernatants were removed and
tested by ELISA for IL-17 (R&D Systems M1700), GM-CSF (R&D Systems
MGM00), IL-10 (R&D Systems DY-417-05) and IFN-γ (BD Biosystems, capture
antibody 551216, detection antibody 554410) while the cells were examined by
FACS analysis. For peritoneal exudate cell (PEC) analysis, cells were removed from
mice 3d after immunization of naive female C57BL/6 mice with MOG35–55 +
CFA + PT at ZT6 or ZT18. EAE disease scores was recorded as follows: grade 0,
normal; grade 1, limp tail; grade 2, wobbly gait; grade 3, hind limb weakness; grade
4, hind limb paralysis; and grade 5, tetraparalysis/death.
Isolation of mononuclear cells from CNS. Mice were killed and perfused with
phosphate-buffered saline, and their spinal cords and brains isolated. Brain and
spinal cord mononuclear cells were then purified by first disrupting the spinal cord
using a tissue lyser then using density gradient centrifugation in Percoll or using a
Multi tissue dissociation kit (Miltenyi 130-110-201) in combination with a gen-
tleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi) followed by debris removal step (Miltenyi). Iso-
lated cells were stimulated for 4 h with PMA, ionomycin in the presence of
brefeldin A (IL-17, IFN-γ and GM-CSF production) or for 2 h with brefeldin A
(IL-1β production, R&D Systems DY-401-05) and then surface and intracellularly
stained and analyzed by FACS.
Flow cytometry. LN, PEC, expanded BM and infiltrating mononuclear cells iso-
lated from spinal cords were washed before being incubated with a live/dead stain.
Cells were then incubated with an Fcγ block (BD) and surface stained with anti-
bodies specific for CD11b (clone M1/70, 1/100, eBioscience), CD11c (clone N418,
1/100, Biolegend), Ly6C (clone AL-21, 1/200, BD Biosciences), Ly6G (clone RB6-

(clone TY25, 1/100, Biolegend), CD45 (clone 30-F11, 1/200, Biolegend), CD3
(clone 17A2, 1/200, eBioscience), CD4 (clone RM4-4, 1/100, eBioscience) and CD8
(clone 53−6.7, 1/100, eBioscience). For intracellularly stained samples cells were
then washed, fixed and permeabilized using 2% PFA (Pierce) and 0.5% saponin
(Sigma-Aldrich) containing antibodies specific for IL-17 (clone TC11-18H10-1, 1/
100, eBioscience), IFN-γ (clone XMG1.2, 1/100, eBioscience), or IL-1β (clone
NJTEN3, 1/50, eBioscience). Cells were analysed using a LSRFortessa flow cyt-
ometer (BD) and the data was analysed with FloJo software. Analysis of the stained
populations was performed by gating on single, live cells. Gating strategy is illu-
strated in Supplementary Fig. 8.
CD11c+MHCII+ and CD11b+Ly6Chi populations of immune cells were
FACS-sorted from single cells suspensions of spleens from individual mice
(n = 5/time point), using a FACSAria Fusion High Performance Cell Sorter (BD).
Cells were sorted on ice directly into RNA Later (Ambion), re-suspended in TRIzol
(Invitrogen) and frozen at −20 °C.
Reverse transcription-PCR. RNA was extracted from brain, spinal cord, LN,
expanded BM and FACS-sorted immune populations using the chloroform/
isopropanol method and was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (cat. no. 4368814, Applied Biosystems). RT-PCR
was performed using commercially available Bmal1 (Mm00500226), Reverbα
(Mm00520708), Per2 (Mm00478113), Clock (Mm00455950), Il1b (Mm00434228),
Ifng (Mm01168134), Csf2 (Mm01290062), Il17α (Mm00439618) and Ccl2
(Mm00441242) primers (ABI). RT-PCR was performed on an ABI PRISM7500
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The amount of each gene was
determined by normalization to 18 S rRNA Mm04277571 or GAPDH
(Mm99999915) internal controls.
Expansion of BM cells with GM-CSF or M-CSF. BM was obtained from the tibia
and femurs of naive Bmal1Mye+/+ or Bmal1Mye−/− mice. Briefly, BM was flushed
from the bones using a 23 G needle and a single cell suspension was obtained by
passing the BM through a 19 G needle. Red blood cells were lysed and immature
monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with either 20 ng/
ml GM-CSF in the form of supernatant from the J558 plasmacytoma cells or with
M-CSF (100 ng/ml) in the form of supernatant from the L929 cell line. Cells were
fed with GM-CSF or M-CSF containing media on d 3 and were harvested on d 6.
For GM-CSF-expanded cells loosely adherent cells were harvested while for M-
CSF-expanded cells flasks were scraped to isolate the adherent cells. Prior to sti-
mulation BM isolated cells were allowed to rest for at least 5 h. Isolated cells were
stimulated with MTB (100 µg/ml) or with medium alone. Supernatants were
removed after either 4 h or 24 h and tested by ELISA for cytokine production or
isolated and washed for FACS analysis. For the generation of antigen-specific
responses GM-CSF or M-CSF-expanded BM cells were incubated for 4 h with MTB
and MOG35–55 antigen (25 µg/ml). MOG-specific CD4 T cells were generated by
immunizing mice with MOG + CFA, without PT, for 7 d. CD4 T cells were isolated
by MACS sorting (Miltenyi) from the draining LN of immunized mice and co-
cultured with BM derived cells at a ratio of 1 BM cell: 10 CD4 T cells. After 72 h co-
stimulation supernatants were removed and tested by ELISA for IL-17, IFN-γ, GM-
CSF and IL-1β production.
Statistics. All data was analysed using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). Unpaired t
tests, Mann–Whitney, one way ANOVA or area under the curve tests were per-
formed on datasets. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM). Details
provided in figure legends.
Data availability. All relevant data are available, on request, from the corre-
sponding authors.
