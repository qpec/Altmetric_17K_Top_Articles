The adult intestine hosts a myriad of diverse bacterial species that reside mostly in the
lower gut maintaining a symbiosis with the human habitat. In the current review, we
describe the neoteric advancement in our comprehension of how the gut microbiota
communicates with the skin as one of the main regulators in the gut-skin axis. We
attempted to explore how this potential link affects skin differentiation and keratinization,
its influence on modulating the cutaneous immune response in various diseases, and
fi
nally how to take advantage of this communication in the control of different skin
conditions.

INTRODUCTION
The gut and skin, densely vascularized and richly innervated organs with crucial immune and
neuroendocrine roles, are uniquely related in purpose and function (O’
Neill et al., 2016). As our
primary interface with the external environment, both organs are essential to the maintenance
of physiologic homeostasis. Cumulative evidence has demonstrated an intimate, bidirectional
connection between the gut and skin, and numerous studies link gastrointestinal (GI) health
to skin homeostasis and allostasis (Figure 1) (Levkovich et al., 2013; O’
Neill et al., 2016). GI
disorders are often accompanied by cutaneous manifestations and the GI system, particularly the
gut microbiome, appears to participate in the pathophysiology of many inflammatory disorders
(Shah et al., 2013; Thrash et al., 2013; Gloster et al., 2016). In this review, we will discuss the gut
microbiome’
s contribution to three common skin disorders –acne, atopic dermatitis (AD), and
psoriasis –(Figure 1) as well as review data on how the microbiome’
s influence can be harnessed
for therapeutic purpose via probiotic supplementation.
GUT MICROBIAL ECOLOGY
Our gut microbiome is a vast collection of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa colonizing our GI
system (Ipci et al., 2017). This collection of microbes outnumbers host cells 10-fold and contains
genetic material 150 times greater than the host’
s own karyosome (Wu and Lewis, 2013; Ipci et al.,
2017). Recent advances in metagenomics and the advent of high-throughput DNA-sequencing
technology has enhanced our understanding of the microbiome and its dynamic influence on
human health and pathology (Boyle et al., 2011; Moore-Connors et al., 2016).
The intestinal microbiome provides important metabolic and immune benefits to the host.
Gut flora contribute to the breakdown of indigestible complex polysaccharides and are vital
to the production of certain nutritional components such as vitamin K. The gut microbiome’

influence on the host immune system is vast, and the relationship
is intricately regulated to both enable immune tolerance of
dietary and environmental antigens and provide protection
against
potential
pathogens.
The
intestinal
microbiome
protects against invasion by exogenous pathogens directly,
by competitively binding to epithelial cells, and indirectly, by
triggering immunoprotective responses (Boyle et al., 2011;
Kosiewicz et al., 2014).
Commensal bacteria prime the gut immune system through
specific interactions between bacterial antigens and pattern
recognition receptors expressed by a variety of host cells
(Kosiewicz et al., 2014). For example, gut microbes are a source
of peptidoglycan capable of altering the expression of toll-like
receptors (TLRs), pattern recognition receptors on the surface of
many innate immune cells. TLRs recognize pathogen associated
molecular patterns and trigger cascades of events linking the
innate to the adaptive immune system through the activation
of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway
(Macpherson and Harris, 2004; Clarke et al., 2010; Thomas and
Versalovic, 2010; Boyle et al., 2011; Kosiewicz et al., 2014). The
contribution of the gut microbiome to the adaptive immune
system has been well-characterized and involves the induction of
immunoglobulin A and the maintenance of homeostasis between
effector T cells (Th1, Th2, and Th17) and regulatory T cells
(Kosiewicz et al., 2014). Certain microbes can also contribute
to intestinal epithelial barrier function via “
cross-talk” with
elements of mucosal immunity (Bik, 2009; Purchiaroni et al.,
2013; Kosiewicz et al., 2014; Rajili´
c-Stojanovi´
c and de Vos, 2014;
Sirisinha, 2016). For instance, one commensal gut microbe,
Lactobacillus LGG, secretes p40, a protein capable of suppressing
cytokine-mediated apoptosis and epithelial barrier disruption.
Another species, Escherichia coli Nissle, contains flagella capable
of inducing β-defensin 2 in epithelial cells (Kosiewicz et al., 2014).
Many human and animal studies suggest that the intestinal
microbiome’
s influence extends beyond the gut, and in fact
contributes to the function, and dysfunction, of distant organ
systems (Levkovich et al., 2013; Kim Y.G. et al., 2014).
Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), products of dietary fibers
fermented by components of the gut microbiome, demonstrate
a protective role against the development of inflammatory
disorders including arthritis and allergy, in addition to colitis
(Kim Y.G. et al., 2014). Intestinal dysbiosis, in the form
of unbalanced bacterial composition or aberrant immune
reactions to commensal flora, has been linked to metabolic,
neurodegenerative, and neoplastic diseases. Altered gut flora
may favor the production of effector over regulatory T
cells, thereby contributing to the development of autoimmune
disorders. For example, segmented filamentous bacteria in
the
gut
have
been
associated
with
a
variety
of
Th17-
mediated diseases. Through mechanisms not yet completely
understood, the gut microbiome’
s influence clearly extends
beyond the GI system. One distant organ known to have
a particularly complex connection with the gut is the skin
(Levkovich et al., 2013; Kim Y.G. et al., 2014; Kosiewicz et al.,
2014).
ROLE OF THE GUT MICROBIOME IN
SKIN HOMEOSTASIS
The skin effectively performs its functions – protection,
temperature regulation, water retention, and more –when in a
state of homeostasis. As an organ undergoing constant renewal,
effective epidermal turnover, the process by which the skin
regenerates itself, is essential to maintaining this state. Epidermal
cells originate from stem cells in the basal layer of the epidermis
and then undergo morphologic change while migrating to the
skin surface. Cells differentiate into three cell types –basal cells,
spinous cells, and granule cells –before ultimately becoming the
corneocytes that make up the outermost layer of the epidermis,
the stratum corneum. This process of epidermal differentiation,
also referred to as keratinization, is under the control of
dedicated transcriptional programs. For example, the expression
of KRT5/K5 and KRT14, the genes which encode keratin 5
and keratin 14, respectively, is downregulated as migrating cells
move outward, while the expression of genes encoding KRT1
and KRT10 is upregulated (Baba et al., 2012; Weaver et al.,
2013; Gaur et al., 2014; Abhishek et al., 2016). Ultimately, this
highly regulated process results in a stratum corneum consisting
of approximately 15 layers of densely keratinized, stratified,
and anucleated corneocytes held together with multiple lipid
bilayers in a “
brick and mortar” model. The corneocytes serve
as the bricks, while ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids, and
cholesterol esters make up the mortar that holds the bricks
together. When epidermal turnover functions appropriately,

Gut Microbiome and the Gut-Skin Axis
the resulting brick and mortar structure serves as an effective
skin barrier with the ability to limit evaporation, preserve
skin moisture, and protect from invasion by foreign organisms
and substances (Baba et al., 2012; Weaver et al., 2013; Gaur
et al., 2014). Through its influence on the signaling pathways
that coordinate this process essential to skin homeostasis, the
gut microbiome impacts integumentary health (O’
Neill et al.,
2016).
Though not yet fully explored, the mechanisms by which
intestinal microbiota exert their influence on skin homeostasis
appear to be related to the modulatory effect of gut commensals
on systemic immunity (O’
Neill et al., 2016). Certain gut
microbes and metabolites – retinoic acid, polysaccharide A
from Bacteroides fragilis, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and
bacteria belonging to Clostridium cluster IV and XI promote
the accumulation of regulatory T cells, lymphocytes which
facilitate anti-inflammatory responses (Forbes et al., 2015).
Segmented filamentous bacteria, alternatively, promote the
accumulation of pro-inflammatory Th17 and Th1 cells. SCFAs,
particularly butyrate, suppress immune responses by inhibiting
inflammatory cells’ proliferation, migration, adhesion, and
cytokine production. In addition, through their inhibition
of histone deacetylase and inactivation of NF-κB signaling
pathways, SCFAs regulate both the activation and apoptosis of
immune cells. The inhibition of histone deacetylase promotes the
proliferation of regulatory cells involved in various cutaneous
physiologic functions including regulation of hair follicle stem
cell differentiation and wound healing (Meijer et al., 2010;
Loser and Beissert, 2012; Samuelson et al., 2015). In addition,
there is new evidence that the intestinal microbiome may
impact cutaneous physiology, pathology, and immune response
more directly, through the metastasis of gut microbiota and
their metabolites to the skin (Samuelson et al., 2015; O’
Neill
et al., 2016). In cases of disturbed intestinal barriers, intestinal
bacteria as well as intestinal microbiota metabolites have been
reported to gain access to the bloodstream, accumulate in
the skin, and disrupt skin homeostasis (O’
Neill et al., 2016).
DNA of intestinal bacteria has been successfully isolated from
the plasma of psoriatic patients (O’
Neill et al., 2016). These
findings represent evidence of a more direct link between the gut
microbiome and cutaneous homeostasis that has just begun to be
explored.
The gut microbiome appears to influence the skin microbiome
as well. SCFAs resulting from fiber fermentation in the gut –
propionate, acetate, and butyrate – are believed to play a
pivotal role in determining the predominance of certain skin
microbiomic profiles which subsequently influence cutaneous
immune defense mechanisms. Propionibacterium, for example,
is a genus capable of producing SCFAs, predominantly acetate
and propionic acid. Propionic acid can exhibit a profound
antimicrobial effect against USA300, the most prevailing
community-acquired
methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus
aureus (Shu et al., 2013; Samuelson et al., 2015; Schwarz et al.,
2017). S. epidermidis and P. acnes are examples of cutaneous
commensals known to tolerate wider SCFA shifts than other
flora. Altogether, these findings provide supportive evidence for
a functional interactive mechanism between gut and skin.
The beneficial effects of gut bacteria on skin health and
appearance have been documented in several rodent and human
studies (Tables 1, 2). In a study by Levkovich et al. (2013), mice
who received Lactobacillus reuteri supplementation experienced
increased dermal thickness, enhanced folliculogenesis, and
increased sebocyte production which manifested as thicker,
shinier fur. In another rodent study, Horii et al. (2014) reported
that oral supplementation of Lactobacillus brevis SBC8803 in
rats resulted in decreased cutaneous arterial sympathetic nerve
tone and increased cutaneous blood flow, possibly via increased
serotonin release from intestinal enterochromaffin cells and
subsequent activation of parasympathetic pathways. A significant
decrease in transepidermal water loss (TEWL), a marker of skin
barrier function, was noted as well (Horii et al., 2014). This
effect was reproduced in human clinical research. After taking
L. brevis SBC8803 oral supplements for 12 weeks, human subjects
had significantly decreased TEWL and significantly increased
corneal hydration (Ogawa et al., 2016). In a separate placebo-
controlled human study, bacterial supplementation was shown to
have a positive effect on skin barrier function (Guéniche et al.,
2013). Volunteers who took Lactobacillus paracasei NCC2461
supplements for 2 months had decreased skin sensitivity and
TEWL, an effect attributed to an observed increase in circulating
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), a cytokine known to
have a favorable effect on barrier integrity (Guéniche et al., 2013;
O’
Neill et al., 2016). A study by Baba et al. (2006) found that when
Lactobacillus helveticus-fermented milk whey was introduced
to human epidermal keratinocyte cultures, there was increased
expression of keratin 10 and involucrin, markers of early and
late differentiation, respectively, suggesting that L. helveticus
can promote epidermal differentiation. In addition, there was
a dose-dependent increase in profilaggrin, a protein involved
in the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. Profilaggrin is
ultimately cleaved to form filaggrin (FLG), a protein essential to
normal epidermal flexibility and hydration, suggesting a potential
moisturizing benefit of this bacteria as well (Baba et al., 2006).
GUT MICROBIOTA AND SKIN
ALLOSTASIS
The intestinal microbiome contributes to skin allostasis, the
restoration of homeostasis after a disturbance or stressor, through
gut microbiota-mediated effects on both innate and adaptive
immunity (Benyacoub et al., 2014; Kim Y.G. et al., 2014; Chen
et al., 2017). Studies have demonstrated that gut bacteria can
positively impact the response to disturbed skin barrier function.
For example, a study by Baba et al. (2010) demonstrated that the
administration of Lactobacillus helveticus decreased the severity
of sodium dodecyl sulfate-induced dermatitis and subsequent
TEWL. Another study showed improved recovery of skin barrier
function and decreased signs of reactive skin inflammation –
including mast cell degranulation, vasodilation, edema, and
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) release – following the
administration of Lactobacillus paracasei CNCM I-2116 (ST11)
(Branchet-Gumila et al., 1999; Guéniche et al., 2010; Philippe
et al., 2011). Research conducted by Poutahidis et al. (2013) found

that mice experienced accelerated wound healing following the
consumption of Lactobacillus reuteri. Microscopic examination
of wounds throughout the healing process revealed the usual
histomorphologic stages of wound healing in both probiotic-
treated and untreated mice, however, the time required for
complete healing was markedly reduced in the treated group.
Foxp3+ regulatory T cells were the prominent immune cell
population in wound sites among the treated group, while
neutrophils were almost completely absent. L. reuteri-induced
oxytocin-mediated regulatory T cell trafficking resulted in the
rapid clearance of neutrophils from the wounds of the treated
group, ultimately resulting in decreased time-to-heal (Poutahidis
et al., 2013).
The gut microbiome has also been shown to support
restoration of skin homeostasis after ultraviolet (UV) radiation
exposure. In one study, 10 days of oral supplementation with
Lactobacillus johnsonii in hairless mice protected the mice
against UV-induced contact hypersensitivity, an effect attributed
to reduced epidermal Langerhans cells and increased systemic
IL-10 levels (Guéniche et al., 2006). In a placebo-controlled
study, Lactobacillus johnsonii La1 supplementation protected
cutaneous immune homeostasis in 54 healthy volunteers
following UV radiation exposure. This effect was mediated
by the normalization of epidermal expression of CD1a,
a transmembrane glycoprotein structurally similar to major
histocompatibility complex that presents self and microbial
glycolipids to T cells (Dougan et al., 2007; Peguet-Navarro et al.,
2008).

to 2-4-dinitrofluorobenzene (Table 1). This microbe also
increased recruitment of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells to the skin,
resulting in decreased apoptosis-mediated skin inflammation,
thereby restoring homeostasis through immune-modulatory
mechanisms (Chapat et al., 2004; Hacini-Rachinel et al., 2009).
Th17 cells are abundant in both the skin and intestine, as both
organs contact the external environment (Weaver et al., 2013).
These cells and their pro-inflammatory cytokines are thought
to directly contribute to the pathogenesis of several chronic
inflammatory dermatoses including psoriasis, Behcet’
s disease,
and contact hypersensitivity (Van Beelen et al., 2007; Esplugues
et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012). The balance between Th17
effector cells and their counterpart regulatory T cells is greatly
influenced by the intestinal microbiome (Van Beelen et al., 2007).
Th17 cells can be eliminated in the intestinal lumen, or they
may acquire a regulatory phenotype with immunosuppressive
characteristics (rTh17) that restricts pathogenicity (Esplugues
et al., 2011).
DYSBIOSIS AND SKIN
DYSHOMEOSTASIS
Intestinal dysbiosis, a state of microbial imbalance, has the
potential to negatively impact skin function. Free phenol and
p-cresol, metabolic products of aromatic amino acids, are
considered biomarkers of a disturbed gut milieu as their
production is induced by certain pathogenic bacteria, most
notably Clostridium difficile. These metabolites can access the
circulation, preferentially accumulate in the skin, and impair
epidermal differentiation and skin barrier integrity (O’
Neill
et al., 2016). Indeed, high p-cresol serum levels are associated
with reduced skin hydration and impaired keratinization
(Dawson et al., 2011; Miyazaki et al., 2014). Intestinal dysbiosis
results in increased epithelial permeability which then triggers
the activation of effector T cells, disrupting their balance
with immunosuppressive regulatory T cells. Pro-inflammatory
cytokines further enhance epithelial permeability and set up a

vicious cycle of chronic systemic inflammation (Kosiewicz et al.,
2014; O’
Neill et al., 2016). These are just a few mechanisms by
which a disturbed gut microbiome manifests in impaired skin
function. Here, we will discuss mechanisms by which intestinal
dysbiosis contributes to three common skin disorders –acne, AD,
and psoriasis.
Acne Vulgaris
Acne vulgaris is a chronic disease of the pilosebaceous unit
that manifests clinically as non-inflammatory comedones or
inflammatory papules, pustules, and nodules (Yentzer et al., 2010;
Bhate and Williams, 2013). Three primary factors are implicated
in
its
pathophysiology
– sebum
oversecretion,
abnormal
keratinocyte desquamation leading to ductal obstruction, and
superimposed inflammation mediated by Propionibacterium
acnes (Dawson and Dellavalle, 2013; Agak et al., 2014; Fox et al.,
2016; Dreno et al., 2017; Picardo et al., 2017; Rodan et al., 2017).
Approximately 85% of adolescents and young adults between
the ages of 12 and 25 are affected by acne, and it represents
the eighth most common medical disorder worldwide (Hay
et
al.,
2014;
Tan
and
Bhate,
2015;
Lynn
et
al.,
2016;
Zaenglein et al., 2016). Acne is particularly prevalent in
western countries, a phenomenon thought to be related to
an abundance of carbohydrates in the typical western diet.
A high glycemic load promotes an increase in insulin/insulin-
like growth factor (IGF-1) signaling. This is thought to induce
increased cytoplasmic expression of the metabolic forkhead
box transcription factor (FoxO1), a sensor of cell nutrition
state. FoxO1 ultimately triggers mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1), a governor of metabolism and cell
proliferation, to mediate sebaceous gland hyperproliferation,
lipogenesis, and hyperplasia of acroinfundibular keratinocytes,
thereby contributing to the development of acne (Melnik, 2015;
Agamia et al., 2016; Zaenglein et al., 2016).
Gut microbiota influence the pathophysiology of acne via
cross talk between intestinal commensal bacteria and the mTOR
pathway (Noureldein and Eid, 2018). Metabolites produced by
gut microbiota have been shown to regulate cell proliferation,
lipid metabolism, and other metabolic functions mediated by
the mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway can in turn affect the
composition of intestinal microbiota through regulation of the
intestinal barrier. In cases of intestinal dysbiosis and disrupted
gut barrier integrity, this bidirectional relationship can result in
a positive feedback cycle of metabolic inflammation. Given the
important role of mTORC1 in the pathogenesis of acne, this
relationship serves as a mechanism by which the gut microbiome
can influence acne pathophysiology.
The complex connection between acne and GI dysfunction
may also be mediated by the brain, an idea first postulated by
Stokes and Pillsbury (1930). Supporting this hypothesis is the
frequent association of both psychological comorbidities –
anxiety
and
depression
– and
GI
distress
with
acne.
These psychological stressors are hypothesized to cause the
intestinal flora to either produce different neurotransmitters –
serotonin, norepinephrine and acetylcholine – or trigger
nearby enteroendocrine cells to release neuropeptides. These
neurotransmitters not only increase intestinal permeability,
leading to both intestinal and systemic inflammation, but
also directly access the circulation through the compromised
intestinal barrier resulting in systemic effects (Zhang et al., 2008;
Do et al., 2009; Bowe and Logan, 2011; Bowe et al., 2012, 2014;
Zouboulis, 2014; Duman et al., 2016; Jena and Sahoo, 2016;
Prakash et al., 2016; Ramrakha et al., 2016; Vaughn et al., 2017).
The gut-brain-skin axis hypothesis remained dormant for several
decades but has been validated by recent advances in microbiome
research and our understanding of its effect on health and disease
(Bowe and Logan, 2011; Bowe et al., 2014). Consistent with this
hypothesis, an upregulation of substance P containing nerves
and a strong expression of this neuropeptide is mutually seen
in both acne vulgaris and intestinal dysbiosis. Substance P
can trigger inflammatory signals that result in the increase of
pro-inflammatory mediators implicated in the pathogenesis of
acne (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, PPAR-γ) (Lee et al., 2008; Arck et al.,
2010; Bercik and Collins, 2014; Borovaya et al., 2014; Theodorou
et al., 2014; Petra et al., 2015; Rokowska-Waluch et al., 2016).
Alternatively, the link may originate with GI dysfunction
which then leads to psychological and cutaneous disorders.
Hypochlorhydria is frequently associated with acne. Low levels of
acidity allows for the migration of colonic bacteria to distal parts
of the small intestine, creating a state of intestinal dysbiosis and
small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). A larger bacterial
population competes for nutrients and impairs the absorption
of fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and vitamins. Malabsorbed
nutrients, including folic acid, zinc, chromium, selenium, and ω-
3 fatty acids have been shown to influence one’
s psychological
state and, along with systemic oxidative stress, have been
implicated in the pathophysiology of acne vulgaris (Katzman
and Logan, 2007). SIBO also results in the production of toxic
metabolites, which can injure enterocytes, increase intestinal
permeability, and ultimately lead to systemic inflammation
(Bures et al., 2010; Bowe and Logan, 2011; Bowe et al., 2014).
Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic pruritic
inflammatory dermatosis, affecting 15–
30% of children and 2–
10% of adults (Simpson et al., 2014; Seite and Bieber, 2015; Bin
and Leung, 2016). It is a heterogeneous disorder with a variety
of endotypes and phenotypes illustrated by wide variations
in clinical features with respect to age, severity, and allergen
response (Seite and Bieber, 2015; Bin and Leung, 2016; Irvine
et al., 2016; Muraro et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017).
Over the last few decades, our understanding of the
pathogenesis of AD has improved with the discovery of more
innate and adaptive immune cells and cytokines (Otsuka et al.,
2017). Skin barrier dysfunction and altered immune responses
are primary players in the pathogenesis of AD (Seite and Bieber,
2015; Bin and Leung, 2016; Irvine et al., 2016; Muraro et al.,
2016; Huang et al., 2017). A compromised barrier secondary
to environmental or genetic causes is typically the preceding
event in AD development. The principal inherited cause of
barrier dysfunction is loss of function mutations in the gene
encoding FLG. FLG plays an essential role in maintaining
epidermal homeostasis by assisting with water retention and
barrier function. Therefore, a mutation in FLG results in

Gut Microbiome and the Gut-Skin Axis
increased TEWL as well as increased susceptibility to invasion by
environmental antigens (Kelleher et al., 2015; Horimukai et al.,
2016).
In the acute stage, allergens breaching a dysfunctional
skin barrier will trigger the release of keratinocyte-derived
cytokines such as TSLP, IL-33 and IL-25. IL-25 and IL-33 will
in-turn activate type 2 innate lymphoid cells through their
interaction with IL-17B and IL-1RL1, respectively, resulting in
the production of IL-13 and IL-5 which will then stimulate a Th2
immune response. Activation of Th2 cells is further enhanced
by TSLP-mediated maturation of Langerhans cells and CD11+
dendritic cells. In the chronic stage, IL-22 released from Th22
CELLS promotes the epidermal production of anti-microbial
peptides, including defensins, which can participate in skewing
the immune response toward a more predominant Th1 response.
Tissue remodeling seen in this stage could be secondary to an IL-
17 mediated release of pro-fibrotic cytokines such as IL-11 and
TGF-β from eosinophils (Otsuka et al., 2017).
Allergic diseases including asthma, hay fever, and eczema
have increased in prevalence over the past several decades
(Wesemann and Nagler, 2016; Johnson and Ownby, 2017). As
developed countries known for their sterile environments saw
the most dramatic rise in AD and other allergic diseases, the
hygiene hypothesis, first proposed by Strachan (1989), was a
widely accepted theory used to explain this phenomenon. Dr.
Strachan proposed that allergic disorders arise when our immune
system inappropriately responds to harmless antigens via Th2-
mediated responses. According to his hypothesis, early exposure
to microbial antigens is essential to immune development, as it
encourages Th1 rather than Th2-mediated immune responses.
With more sterile environments in developed countries, the
hygiene hypothesis explains the disproportionate rise of allergic
disease in the western world. This theory, however, is flawed
in that it fails to explain the parallel increase in prevalence
of Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases. Another proposed
explanation, the diet-microbiome theory, seeks to reconcile this
flaw.
The diet-microbiome theory implies that the increased
prevalence of allergic disease stems from a less robust state
of immune homeostasis rather than from overresponse to
innocuous environmental cues (Kim et al., 2013; Purchiaroni
et al., 2013; Song et al., 2016; Johnson and Ownby, 2017).
According to this theory, the gut microbiome’
s contribution to
immune homeostasis is impaired by the typical western diet.
Immune homeostasis begins to take shape early in life through
exposure to maternal microbiota, and the infant’
s intestinal
flora is further developed with exposure to breast milk, other
food, and environmental microbes (Sironi and Clerici, 2010;
Neu and Rushing, 2011; Clemente et al., 2012; Frei et al.,
2012; Rook, 2012; Bendiks and Kopp, 2013; Kim et al., 2013;
Purchiaroni et al., 2013; Bloomfield et al., 2016; Song et al.,
2016; Johnson and Ownby, 2017). The low fiber and high
fat content characteristic of the western diet fundamentally
changes the gut microbiome, resulting in deficient production
of immunomodulatory metabolites, particularly SCFAs. SCFAs
are known for their anti-inflammatory actions mediated by
G-protein coupled receptor 43 and for their contribution
to epithelial barrier integrity (Maslowski et al., 2009). Anti-
inflammatory activity is further mediated by regulatory T cells
and driven by TGF-β and/or interleukin 10 (IL-10). IL-10 exerts
its inhibitory function by inducing TGF-β and other cytokines
as well as suppressive signaling molecules including CTLA-4 and
PD-1. Reduced local and systemic immune tolerance resulting
from an altered gut microbiome may help explain the observed
rise of both autoimmune and atopic disease observed in the
western world (Maslowski et al., 2009; Agrawal et al., 2011;
Purchiaroni et al., 2013; Seite and Bieber, 2015; Johnson and
Ownby, 2017).
Studies have sought to demonstrate the link between intestinal
dysbiosis and atopic disease (Johnson and Ownby, 2017). In
two Korean studies, metagenomic analysis of fecal samples
from patients with AD demonstrated a significant reduction
in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii species compared to control
patients. A parallel decrease in SCFA production among AD
patients was observed as well. The authors emphasized a possible
positive feedback loop between intestinal dysbiosis regarding
F. prausnitzii and epithelial barrier disruption secondary to
uncontrolled epithelial inflammation (Kim et al., 2013; Song
et al., 2016). Disruption in the intestinal barrier contributes
to this feedback loop by allowing the penetration of poorly
digested food, microbes, and toxins into the circulation to reach
target tissue, including the skin, where they trigger Th2 immune
responses resulting in further tissue damage (Purchiaroni et al.,
2013; Seite and Bieber, 2015; Song et al., 2016; Johnson and
Ownby, 2017).
Psoriasis
Psoriasis is an immune-mediated chronic relapsing-remitting
inflammatory
dermatosis
triggered
by
a
multitude
of
environmental and internal factors in genetically susceptible
individuals (Parisi et al., 2013; Rachakonda et al., 2014; Kulig
et al., 2016; Takeshita et al., 2017). Histologic features include
acanthosis, reflective of a state of keratinocyte hyperproliferation,
and
parakeratosis,
indicative
of
dysregulated
keratinocyte
differentiation. Increased vascularity is characteristic as well,
allowing for the accumulation of inflammatory subpopulations
of neutrophils, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes (Roberson
and Bowcock, 2010; Kulig et al., 2016). Clinically, psoriasis
commonly presents as recurrent episodes of well-demarcated
scaly erythematous plaques but can rarely also manifest
as generalized life-threatening erythroderma (Mari et al.,
2017).
Treatment options have evolved as the pathophysiology of
psoriasis has become better understood. Initially considered
merely a hyperproliferative skin disorder, treatment once focused
on anti-proliferative therapeutic modalities. In the 1980s, the
Th1 subset of effector T cells their derived cytokines became the
target of many psoriasis therapeutics. More recently, after the
discovery of elevated IL-17 levels in psoriatic lesions, therapies
have focused on Th17 cells, a novel subset of T cells, as a
principal player. Th17 cytokines enhance the expression of the IL-
10 cytokine family including; IL-20 and IL-22 cytokines capable
of promoting the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Following
the discovery of the Th17 pathway, most clinical and mechanistic

Gut Microbiome and the Gut-Skin Axis
evidence suggests that psoriasis is primarily driven by the IL-
23/IL-17/Th17 axis (Baba et al., 2006; Fitch et al., 2007; Guttman-
Yassky et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2008; Gaffen et al., 2015; Coates et al.,
2016).
Psoriasis is commonly accompanied by inflammation in other
organ systems. Seven to 11% of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
patients are diagnosed with psoriasis, making the association with
GI inflammation particularly strong (Huang et al., 2012; Eppinga
et al., 2014; Takeshita et al., 2017). Certain shared genetic and
environmental factors as well as immune pathways have been
implicated in the etiopathogenesis of both diseases (Huang et al.,
2012). For example, Th17 cells and their cytokines, known to
play a principal role in the development of psoriasis, have been
implicated in the pathophysiology of IBD as well (Eppinga et al.,
2014; Verstockt et al., 2016). This subset of cells is also thought
to play a role in the development of ankylosing spondylitis
and rheumatoid arthritis, two autoimmune inflammatory joint
diseases commonly reported in patients with psoriasis and IBD
(Zhang et al., 2012). Evidence such as this suggests another
possible tri-directional axis orchestrated by the gut and its
influence on the skin (Eppinga et al., 2014).
Metabolites produced by the intestinal microbiome have
immune-modifying potential, capable of altering the balance
between immune tolerance and inflammation through their
influence on the differentiation of naïve T cells into either
regulatory or Th17 lineages. Effector T cells are generally
anabolic and depend on glycolysis as their source of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP). Memory and resting T cells, however, are
considered catabolic and utilize fatty acids and amino acids,
in addition to glucose, to generate ATP through oxidative
phosphorylation. The primary transcription factors of the
lipogenic and glycolytic pathways are adenosine monophosphate
activated kinase and rapamycin, respectively. Both serve as
energy sensors and are regulated by the accessibility of nutrients
in the gut milieu, which can be modulated by gut microbiota
(Omenetti and Pizarro, 2015).
The pattern of dysbiosis found in IBD patients has also been
described in psoriatic patients with and without IBD (Scher
et al., 2015). There is depletion of symbiont bacteria, including
Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii as
well as colonization with certain pathobionts such as Salmonella,
Escherichia coli, Helicobacter, Campylobacter, Mycobacterium,
and Alcaligenes. One study revealed a decreased presence of
Parabacteroides and Coprobacillus, two beneficial gut species,
in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients comparable to
what is observed in patients with IBD. Reduced presence of
beneficial phyla may translate into functional consequences
including poor regulation of intestinal immune responses that
may then affect distant organ systems (Scher et al., 2015).
F. prausnitzii, one of the most common microbial inhabitants
of the large intestine, provides many benefits to the host.
It serves as an important source of butyrate, a SCFA that
provides energy for colonocytes, reduces oxidative stress, and
imparts anti-inflammatory action by triggering regulatory T
cells, thereby conferring immune tolerance that extends beyond
the GI system (Sokol et al., 2008; Lopez-Siles et al., 2012).
Psoriatic patients harbor a significantly lower number of
this microbe compared to healthy controls (Eppinga et al.,
2016). It has also been theorized that the far-reaching effects
of intestinal dysbiosis are the result of gut microbes and
their metabolites breaching an impaired intestinal barrier and
entering systemic circulation to directly target distant organs,
including the skin and joints. Consistent with this hypothesis,
DNA of gut microbial origin has been isolated from the
blood of patients with active psoriasis (Ramírez-Boscá et al.,
2015).
MODULATION OF THE GUT
MICROBIOTA FOR TREATMENT AND
PREVENTION (REHABILITATION OF THE
GUT ECOSYSTEM)
The gut microbiome is greatly influenced by diet. Though
long-term dietary habits shape bacterial composition, dramatic
modulation of diet over the short term can rapidly alter
gut bacteria as well. Given the gut microbiome’
s influence
on
inflammatory
disease,
this
provides
an
opportunity
to intentionally modify the microbiome with therapeutic
aims (Huang et al., 2017). Probiotic supplementation, the
administration of live beneficial gut bacteria, has a promising
potential role in the prevention and management of various skin
conditions (Krutmann, 2009; Hill et al., 2014; Farris, 2016; Grant
and Baker, 2017; Sánchez et al., 2017; Sarao and Arora, 2017).
Prebiotics, non-viable bacterial components and metabolites,
and synbiotics, the combination of pro- and prebiotics, offer
similar health benefits (Muizzuddin et al., 2012; Frei et al., 2015).
Cosmetic Effect of Probiotics on Skin
Ultraviolet radiation is the primary external contributor to skin
aging. Through its stimulation of signaling pathways which
ultimately increase the transcription of target genes key to
photoaging, UV radiation results in increased laxity, dryness,
and pigmentation (Chen et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2015; Wiegand
et al., 2016). Activator protein 1 is a matrix metalloproteinase
(MMP) transcription factor with a primary role in UVB-induced
skin aging. MMPs are zinc-dependent endopeptidases capable
of degrading extracellular matrix macromolecules. Interstitial
collagenase (MMP-1) cleaves collagen I and III fibrils in skin,
while MMP-9 further degrades these fibrils into smaller peptides
(Quan et al., 2013; Cavinato and Jansen-Dürr, 2017; Qin et al.,
2017). MMP-2 and MMP-9, primarily expressed in the epidermis,
break down collagen IV and VII found in the epidermal basement
membrane (Pittayapruek et al., 2016). When keratinocytes are
exposed to UVA radiation, there is increased expression of TNF-
α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine (Jeong et al., 2016).
Studies have sought to demonstrate how modulation of the
gut microbiome can influence immune signaling pathways in
a way that counteracts UV damage. Lipoteichoic acid (LTA),
a cell wall component of Lactobacillus species, is known for
its anti-inflammatory properties (Jeong et al., 2016). In one
Korean study, oral administration of Lactobacillus plantarum
HY7714, resulted in the prevention of UV-induced photoaging

Gut Microbiome and the Gut-Skin Axis
in mice through the inhibition of MMP-1 expression in dermal
fibroblasts (Kim H.M. et al., 2014). This anti-aging effect was
reproduced in human research. In a double-blind, placebo-
controlled study, oral supplementation of L. plantarum HY7714
in 110 middle-aged Korean subjects for 12 weeks resulted in
improved cutaneous elasticity and increased skin hydration (Lee
et al., 2015). Another study demonstrated that Lactobacillus sakei
LTA is capable of reversing UV-induced skin aging through its
immune modulating effect on monocytes (You et al., 2013).
Probiotics and Acne Vulgaris
Topical and oral antibiotics are often included in traditional
acne treatment regimens. Though effective, this approach risks
antibiotic resistance and disruption of the microbiome. Given
the role of intestinal dysbiosis in inflammatory skin conditions,
probiotic supplementation represents a promising alternate, or
adjuvant, acne treatment approach.
In an early study of probiotic supplementation, the ingestion
of
Lactobacillus
acidophilus
and
Lactobacillus
bulgaricus
probiotic
tablets
by
300
acne
patients
resulted
in
acne
improvement in 80% of subjects, particularly in subjects
with inflammatory lesions (Siver, 1961; Bowe and Logan, 2011;
Bowe et al., 2014). Probiotics can suppress Propionibacterium
acnes through the secretion of antibacterial protein. Streptococcus
salivarius and Lactococcus HY449 produce bacteriocin-like
inhibitory substance and bacteriocins, respectively, which inhibit
the growth of P. acnes (Bowe and Logan, 2011; Bowe et al.,
2014; Kober and Bowe, 2015). In another clinical study, subjects
who received oral Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species in
conjunction with oral antibiotics experienced a significantly
greater decrease in acne lesion count compared to an antibiotic-
only control group (Table 2) (Volkova et al., 2001; Jung et al.,
2013).
In addition to their antimicrobial effects, probiotics can
disrupt the pathogenesis of acne through immunomodulatory
and anti-inflammatory actions. In vitro studies of Streptococcus
salivarius,
a
commensal
microbe,
attributed
the
anti-
inflammatory effect of this strain to inhibition of IL-8 secretion,
suppression of the NF-κB pathway, and downregulation of genes
associated with the adhesion of bacteria to epidermal surfaces
(Cosseau et al., 2008).
Probiotics may also lower the glycemic load, reduce IGF-1
signaling, and ultimately decrease keratinocyte proliferation and
sebaceous gland hyperplasia. In one pilot study, the consumption
of Lactobacillus rhamnosus SP1 for 12 weeks resulted in reduced
expression of IGF-1 and oxidative stress markers (Table 2)
(Fabbrocini et al., 2016). In a study of obese diabetic mice,
administration of Bifidobacterium species resulted in inhibition
of high-fat diet-induced endotoxemia and inflammation via a
GLP-2-dependant mechanism. Increased glucagon-like peptide
2 (GLP-2), an intestinotrophic proglucagon-derived peptide,
resulted in improved tight junction integrity and reduced
intestinal permeability (Cani et al., 2009).
Probiotics and Atopic Dermatitis
The primary treatment approach to AD combines topical
emollients and anti-inflammatory drugs to compensate for
disrupted
barrier
function
and
poor
immune
tolerance,
respectively (Muraro et al., 2016). Given the gut microbiome’
s
integral
role
in
immune
development
and
homeostasis,
probiotics may be useful in both the prevention and treatment
of allergic disorders including AD via microbial, epithelial,
and immune effects. Probiotics modify microbial composition,
prevent pathogen invasion by competitively binding to epithelial
cells, and suppress growth of pathogens by secreting bacteriocin.
They also contribute to the restoration of impaired barrier
function by increasing the expression of tight junction proteins
as well as the production of SCFAs. Immune benefits include
the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-4, INFγ, IL-17)
and the promotion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10,
TGF-β). Probiotics can increase the number of regulatory T
cells that suppress the cutaneous expression of thymic stromal
lymphopoietin involved in the stimulation of dendritic cells,
effectively preventing the differentiation of naïve T cells into
Th2 and Th17 subtypes. Regulatory T cells can migrate to the
skin and inhibit Th2 and Th17 responses, thereby exerting a
therapeutic role in addition to a preventative one (Kim et al.,
2013; Chang et al., 2016; McCusker and Sidbury, 2016; Rather
et al., 2016).
Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species are the most
commonly tested probiotics in AD (Kim et al., 2010; Enomoto
et al., 2014). Oral supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus
Lcr35 in an AD mouse model resulted in the upregulation of
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and the downregulation
of interleukin-4 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (Table 1)
(Kim et al., 2012). In a separate study, supplementation of
another AD mouse model with Lactobacillus plantarum CJLP55,
CJLP133, and CJLP136 resulted in inhibition of house dust
mite-induced dermatitis via increased production of IL-10 and
alteration of the Th1/Th2 balance (Won et al., 2011). After
supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus IDCC 3201, there
was suppression of mast cell mediated inflammation in the same
mouse model (Lee et al., 2016).
In humans, prenatal and postnatal probiotics have proven
efficacy in the management, and even prevention, of AD in high
risk infants. In one placebo-controlled study, Bifidobacterium
bifidum BGN4, Bifidobacterium lactis AD011, and Lactobacillus
acidophilus AD031 supplements were given to pregnant Korean
women with a positive family history of AD 4–
8 weeks before
delivery and to their infants for the first 2 months of life.
The incidence of AD was significantly lower in the probiotic-
treated group compared to the control group (Kim et al.,
2010). In a separate study, prenatal and postnatal probiotic milk
supplementation in Norwegian women and their infants was
also associated with a reduced incidence of AD (Bertelsen et al.,
2014). In a third study, maternal and infant supplementation with
Bifidobacterium breve M-16V and Bifidobacterium longum BB536
further supported the preventative effect of probiotics in AD
(Enomoto et al., 2014). Regarding AD treatment, a recent meta-
analysis was conducted of studies investigating the efficacy of
probiotics in AD symptom-control. This analysis concluded that
probiotic use improved AD, reflected by a significant reduction in
the Severity Scoring of AD index, in all ages except infants under
1 year (Chang et al., 2016).

Gut Microbiome and the Gut-Skin Axis
Probiotics and Psoriasis
Data on probiotic supplementation in psoriasis treatment are
limited, but promising outcomes have been documented. One
study evaluating the effect of Lactobacillus pentosus GMNL-77
on an imiquimod-induced psoriasis mouse model found that
probiotic-treated mice experienced significantly less erythema,
scaling, and epidermal thickening compared to untreated control
mice (Chen et al., 2017). Oral administration of L. pentosus
GMNL-77 appeared to suppress expression of TNF-α, IL-6,
and proinflammatory cytokines in the IL-23/IL-17 cytokine
axis. Though the mechanism for reduced T cell activity
was unclear, the study authors proposed that this effect was
mediated by suppression of CD103+ dendritic cells, intestinal
antigen presenting cells that have been shown to modulate
regulatory T cells in the GI tract. In a separate placebo-
controlled study of psoriasis patients, Bifidobacterium infantis
35624 supplementation led to significantly reduced plasma
levels of TNF-α in the probiotic-treated group (Table 2)
(Groeger et al., 2013). In one documented case of severe
pustular psoriasis unresponsive to steroids, dapsone, and
methotrexate, clinical improvement was observed within 2 weeks
of initiating Lactobacillus sporogenes supplementation three times
per day, with almost complete resolution achieved at 4 weeks
(Vijayashankar and Raghunath, 2012).
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES
Basic science research and clinical studies have demonstrated
the gut microbiome’
s contribution to host homeostasis, allostasis,
and the pathogenesis of disease. Through complex immune
mechanisms, the influence of the gut microbiome extends
to involve distant organ systems including the skin. With
intentional modulation of the microbiome, probiotics, prebiotics,
and synbiotics have proven beneficial in the prevention
and/or treatment of inflammatory skin diseases including
acne vulgaris, AD, and psoriasis. In this up-and-coming field,
future research should improve our understanding of the
complex mechanisms underlying the gut-skin axis, investigate
the therapeutic potential of long-term modulation of the gut
microbiome, and potentially expand therapeutic manipulation
to include commensal gut fungi and viruses in order to fully
harness the gut microbiome’
s influence in the treatment of skin
disease.
