IMPORTANCE There are few data on the prevalence or outcome of bystander
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (BCPR) in children 18 years and younger.
OBJECTIVE To characterize BCPR in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCAs).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This analysis of the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance
Survival database investigated nontraumatic OHCAs in children 18 years and younger from
January 2013 through December 2015.
EXPOSURES Bystander CPR, which included conventional CPR and compression-only CPR.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall survival and neurologically favorable survival,
defined as a Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 or 2, at the time of hospital discharge.
RESULTS Of the 3900 children younger than 18 years with OHCA, 2317 (59.4%) were infants,
2346 (60.2%) were female, and 3595 (92.2%) had nonshockable rhythms. Bystander CPR
was performed on 1814 children (46.5%) and was more common for white children (687 of
1221 [56.3%]) compared with African American children (447 of 1134 [39.4%]) and Hispanic
children (197 of 455 [43.3%]) (P < .001). Overall survival and neurologically favorable survival
were 11.3% (440 of 3900) and 9.1% (354 of 3900), respectively. On multivariable analysis,
BCPR was independently associated with improved overall survival (adjusted proportion,
13.2%; 95% CI, 11.81-14.58; adjusted odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.25-1.96) and neurologically
favorable survival (adjusted proportion, 10.3%; 95% CI, 9.10-11.54; adjusted odds ratio, 1.50;
95% CI, 1.21-1.98) compared with no BCPR (overall survival: adjusted proportion, 9.5%; 95%
CI, 8.28-10.69; neurologically favorable survival: adjusted proportion, 7.59%; 95% CI,
6.50-8.68). For those with data on type of BCPR, 697 of 1411 (49.4%) received conventional
CPR and 714 of 1411 (50.6%) received compression-only CPR. On multivariable analysis, only
conventional CPR (adjusted proportion, 12.89%; 95% CI, 10.69-15.09; adjusted odds ratio,
2.06; 95% CI, 1.51-2.79) was associated with improved neurologically favorable survival
compared with no BCPR (adjusted proportion, 9.59%; 95% CI, 6.45-8.61). There was a
significant interaction of BCPR with age. Among infants, conventional BCPR was associated
with improved overall survival and neurologically favorable survival while compression-only
CPR had similar outcomes to no BCPR.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Bystander CPR is associated with improved outcomes in
pediatric OHCAs. Improving the provision of BCPR in minority communities and increasing
the use of conventional BCPR may improve outcomes for children with OHCA.

M
ore than 5000 children experience an out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) every year in the
UnitedStates.1,2Theoutcomeofthesearrestsispoor,
with a mortality rate greater than 90%.2,3 An important clini-
calpredictorofsurvivalfollowingadultOHCAisbystandercar-
diopulmonary resuscitation (BCPR),4 yet most studies reveal
that only one-third of children receive BCPR following OHCA.2
Widespread national and statewide efforts have been un-
dertaken to improve BCPR rates in adults and children that in-
clude the performance of compression-only CPR (COR) for by-
standers who are reluctant to perform rescue breaths.5,6
Although COR appears to be as effective as conventional CPR
with chest compressions and rescue breaths for adults with
OHCA,5 it may be less effective for children, whose OHCAs are
most commonly from asphyxia.7,8 Therefore, the American
Heart Association recommends conventional CPR for pediat-
ric cardiac arrest instead of COR. However, if a bystander is un-
able to perform rescue breathing, the American Heart Associa-
tion recommends COR, which is preferable to no CPR at all.9,10
The objectives of this study were 2-fold: The first aim was
to characterize BCPR in pediatric OHCAs and test the hypoth-
esis that BCPR would be associated with improved overall sur-
vival and neurologically favorable survival at hospital dis-
chargefromalargecardiacarrestregistryintheUnitedStates.11
The second aim was to characterize bystander COR and com-
pare survival outcomes following bystander COR with
conventional CPR in children.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
A secondary data analysis of the Cardiac Arrest Registry to En-
hance Survival (CARES) database was conducted. The CARES
database was established by the US Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention in collaboration with the Department of
Emergency Medicine at the Emory University School of Medi-
cine in Atlanta, Georgia. The CARES database includes an over-
all catchment area of more than 90 million people in 37 states
across the United States. The CARES is an emergency medical
services–based registry for OHCA and is composed of a lim-
ited standard set of data elements from 3 sources: 911 call cen-
ters,respondingemergencymedicalserviceprofessionals,and
receiving hospitals.12 Responding emergency medical ser-
vice professionals were defined as personnel (ie, emergency
medicine technicians and paramedics) who responded to the
medical emergency in an official capacity as part of an orga-
nized medical response team and were the designated trans-
porters of the patient to the hospital. Detailed information on
the design and development of this registry as well as the data
elements included in the registry is published elsewhere.11
From January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015, CARES
captured all 911-activated nontraumatic cardiac arrest events,
defined as apnea and unresponsiveness in which resuscitation
with either CPR or defibrillation was attempted. Children with
obvious signs of death (eg, rigor mortis or dependent lividity)
or for whom a “do not resuscitate” order was respected were
not included. Standardized international Utstein Style defini-
tions for defining clinical variables and outcomes were used to
ensure uniformity in reporting.13 Because the etiology of car-
diacarrestinchildrenisdifficulttodetermine,especiallyincases
that result in death, all patients with nontraumatic OHCA were
included regardless of presumed etiology, including respira-
tory, cardiac, drowning, electrocution, or other. Only in-
stances of traumatic OHCA were excluded from the analysis.
AnalystsoftheCARESdatabaseconfirmedthecaptureofallcar-
diac arrests by each community’
s 911 center during the data re-
view process. Cerebral Performance Category information was
obtained from receiving hospitals. The CARES established a
point of contact at each participating hospital and trained the
contactonCAREShospitalelementdefinitionsandthedataen-
try process. The local hospital contact abstracted information
from patients’medical records and entered data. All data were
enteredusingaweb-basedplatform,andanExcelfile(Microsoft

Thisstudywasapprovedbytheinstitutionalreviewboards
at both Emory University and The Children’
s Hospital of Los
Angeles. Given the use of deidentified data, the study was de-
termined to be exempt for review by the Children’
s Hospital
of Philadelphia Institutional Review Board of The Children’
s
Hospital of Philadelphia. Because the study used data from a
deidentified database, informed consent was waived.
Study Sample
Allchildren18yearsandyoungerwithnontraumaticOHCAsub-
mitted to the registry during the study period were eligible for
inclusion. Arrests that occurred in medical facilities or nurs-
ing homes, traumatic arrests, and 911 responder–witnessed ar-
rests were excluded.
Variables of Interest and Study Outcome
Patientcharacteristicsobtainedfromthedatabaseincludedage,
sex, race/ethnicity, bystander witness status, arrest location,
rhythm type, and automated external defibrillator (AED) use.
Race/ethnicity data were evaluated to determine whether CPR
provision was influenced by race/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was
assigned as considered by the child, family, or 911 responder.
Key Points
Question What are the characteristics and outcomes of bystander
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and compression-only CPR
following pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest?
Findings In this analysis of data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry
to Enhance Survival, bystander CPR was provided in 1814 of 3900
instances (46.5%) of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in children
younger than 18 years and was significantly associated with
improved overall survival and neurologically favorable survival.
Conventional CPR had improved outcomes compared with
compression-only CPR.
Meaning Public health efforts to improve the provision of CPR in
minority communities and increase the use of conventional
bystander CPR may improve outcomes for pediatric
out-of-hospital cardiac arrests.

The race/ethnicity category included white, African Ameri-
can, Hispanic/Latino, and other (eg, American Indian/
Alaskan,Asian,andNativeHawaiian/Pacific).Theprimaryout-
comes of interest were overall survival and neurologically
favorable survival, defined as a Cerebral Performance Cat-
egory score of 1 (no neurologic disability) or 2 (moderate dis-
ability) at the time of discharge.14 Unfavorable neurologic out-
come was defined as a Cerebral Performance Category score of
3(severedisability)or4(comaorvegetativestate)ordeath.Sec-
ondary outcomes included survival after BCPR with COR com-
pared with conventional BCPR. Bystander CPR was defined as
CPR administered by a layperson (ie, a lay family member, lay-
person, or layperson with medical training not part of the or-
ganized emergency medical response). Conventional CPR was
definedasCPRwithchestcompressionsandrescuebreaths;COR
was defined as CPR with chest compressions only.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analyses report overall child and arrest character-
istics, characteristics for arrests that had BCPR vs no by-
stander CPR, and characteristics for arrests that had COR and
conventional CPR. Bivariable statistics were used to describe
the percentage of arrests with survival to hospital discharge
andneurologicallyfavorablesurvival.Logisticregressionmod-
els with robust standard errors were used to examine the as-
sociations of the predictors with the probability of survival to
hospital discharge and neurologically favorable survival. The
analysiswasadjustedforpotentialconfounders,includingage,
sex, arrest witness status, location of the arrest, rhythm type,
and AED use. Further analyses examined whether BCPR modi-
fied the results by all other covariates via interactions. Re-
sults are expressed as odds ratios and standardized marginal
probabilities with 95% CIs. Significance was set at P < .05, and
all associations were determined through 2-sided testing.
Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Insti-
tute) and STATA version 10.3 (StataCorp).
Results
Atotalof3900childrenyoungerthan18yearswithOHCAwere
evaluated (Table 1). Most cardiac arrests occurred in infants
(59.4% [2317 of 3900]), and arrests occurred more frequently
in girls (60.2% [2346 of 3900]) than in boys. Patients who were
white (1221 of 3900 [31.3%]) composed the largest racial group,
followed by African American (1134 of 3900 [29.1%]) and His-
panic (455 of 3900 [11.7%]) patients. Most arrests occurred at
home/residence (83.7% [3263 of 3900]), were unwitnessed
(72.2% [2817 of 3900]), and had nonshockable rhythms (ie,
asystole or pulseless electrical activity; 92.2% [3595 of 3900]).
Most arrests did not receive AED application by a bystander
or first responder prior to emergency medical service arrival
(82.6%[3222of3900]).Theoverallsurvivalratewas11.3%(440
of 3900), and the neurologically favorable survival rate was
9.1% (354 of 3900).
Bystander CPR was provided in 46.5% (1814 of 3900) of
arrests, most commonly by a family member (67.4% [1222 of
1814]), followed by a layperson (22.9% [416 of 1814]) and lay-
person with medical training (9.7% [176 of 1814]). Bystander
CPR was more common for white (687 of 1221 [56.3%]) com-
pared with African American (447 of 1134 [39.4%]) and His-
panic (197 of 455 [43.3%]) children (P < .001). Bystander CPR
was also more common in girls, witnessed arrests, nonhome/
public arrests, arrests with a shockable rhythm, and arrests in
which an AED was used.
For bivariable analysis, survival to hospital discharge was
associated with BCPR (BCPR, 14.28%; no BCPR, 8.68%;
P < .001) (Table 2 and Table 3) and . Other factors associated
withimprovedsurvivaltohospitaldischargeincludedageolder
than 1 year, female sex, white race/ethnicity, witnessed ar-
rests,nonhome/publicarrests,shockablerhythm,andAEDuse
(Table 2 and Table 3). For multivariable analysis, BCPR was in-
dependently associated with survival to hospital discharge
compared with no BCPR (adjusted proportion, 13.19%; 95% CI,
11.81-14.58 vs 9.48%; 95% CI, 8.28-10.69; adjusted odds ratio
[OR], 1.57; 95% CI, 1.25-1.96). Other predictors of survival to
hospital discharge included age older than 1 year, female sex,
witnessed arrests, nonhome/public arrests, and arrests with
a shockable rhythm. Several interactions noted with BCPR in-
cluded age, sex, race/ethnicity, witnessed arrests, arrest loca-
tion, rhythm type, and AED use (eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment). For infants, survival to hospital discharge was not

associated with BCPR, although there was a significant asso-
ciation with BCPR in children older than 1 year.
For neurologically favorable survival, BCPR was signifi-
cantly associated compared with no BCPR in bivariable analy-
sis (BCPR, 11.63%; no BCPR, 6.86%; P < .001). Other factors as-
sociated with improved neurologically favorable survival for
children included age older than 1 year, female sex, white race/
ethnicity, witnessed arrests, nonhome/public location, shock-
able rhythm, and AED use. The significant association of BCPR
with neurologically favorable survival held in the multivari-
able model compared with no BCPR (adjusted proportion,
10.32%; 95% CI, 9.10-11.54 vs 7.59%; 95% CI, 6.50-8.68; ad-
justed OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.21-1.98). Predictors of neurologically
favorable survival in children included age older than 1 year,
white race/ethnicity, witnessed arrests, nonhome/public loca-
tion, and shockable rhythm. Several interactions with BCPR
were also noted, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, witness sta-
tus, arrest location, rhythm type, and AED use (eFigure 2 in the
Supplement).Forinfants,neurologicallyfavorablesurvivalwas
not associated with BCPR, although there was a significant
association of BCPR in children older than 1 year.
Of the 1814 children that received BCPR, the type of CPR
was available for 1411 (77.8%). For those events where type of
CPR data was available, 49.4% (697 of 1411) received conven-
tional CPR and 50.6% (714 of 1411) received COR (eTable in the
Supplement). Children older than 1 year and African Ameri-
canandHispanicchildrenweremorelikelytoreceiveCORcom-
pared with conventional CPR. There was no difference in the
type of BCPR by sex, witnessed arrest, arrest location, rhythm
type, and AED use.
An analysis was conducted on the association of type of
BCPR with no BCPR and outcomes (Table 4 and Table 5). For
bivariable analysis, conventional CPR and COR resulted in
higher rates of survival to hospital discharge compared with
no BCPR (conventional CPR, 17.07%; COR, 14.15%; no BCPR,
8.68%; P < .001). On multivariable analysis, conventional
CPR (adjusted proportion, 16.79%; 95% CI, 14.26-19.31;
adjusted OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.69-2.95) and COR (adjusted pro-
portion, 12.09%; 95% CI, 9.99-14.19; adjusted OR, 1.14; 95%
CI, 1.05-1.97) were independently associated with survival to
hospital discharge compared with no BCPR (adjusted pro-
portion, 9.37%; 95% CI, 8.17-10.57). On bivariable analysis,
conventional CPR and COR had improved neurologically
favorable survival compared with no BCPR (conventional

the Supplement). For infants, conventional BCPR was associ-
ated with higher rates of survival to hospital discharge and
neurologically favorable survival. However, COR had out-
comes that were similar to no BCPR (Figure). For children
older than 1 year, both conventional CPR and COR were asso-

neurologically favorable survival compared with no BCPR.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report focused on the
association of BCPR and COR in children from the United
States. There are several important findings to highlight.
Bystander CPR was provided for 47% of these children after

cardiac arrest, which is greater than previously reported.2
Second, BCPR was associated with a higher survival to hos-
pital discharge and neurologically favorable survival than
previously reported from the United States.2,3 Third, a racial
disparity exists in the provision of BCPR. Fourth, COR and
conventional CPR were provided in a similar number of
arrests. Fifth, conventional CPR was associated with better
outcomes than COR for children overall. Sixth, both conven-
tional CPR and COR were associated with better outcomes
than no BCPR for children aged 1 to 18 years. Seventh,
although infants composed the largest age group, BCPR was
only associated with improved outcomes in infants when
ventilations were also performed.
In this study, BCPR was provided in just under half of pe-
diatric OHCAs (46.5%), which is similar to reports from Japan
(52%)15 but higher than previous reports from the United
States.1,2 The Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium reported a
35% incidence of BCPR in 624 children with OHCA that oc-
curred between 2005 and 2007.2 This increase in BCPR may
be secondary to an increase in COR by bystanders unwilling
to perform conventional CPR with rescue breaths. This is sup-
ported by the present study, which shows that an almost equal
number of children received conventional CPR and COR.
This report found a survival to hospital discharge of 11.3%,
whichishigherthanpreviouslyreportedintheUnitedStates.1-3
In a report from the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium, sur-
vival to hospital discharge was 6.4%.2 In a more recent report
from the CARES registry evaluating OHCA in 1980 children be-
tween 2005 and 2013, 8.2% survived to hospital discharge.3
This improvement is presumably because of the increased
BCPR noted in this study as well as improvements in manage-
ment after cardiac arrest.16,17 The CARES is a voluntary regis-
try, and agencies that choose to participate may have more re-
sourcestodedicatetoqualityimprovementinitiatives,resulting
inhighersurvivalratesthanotheragencies.18Greaterthan80%
of children who survived a cardiac arrest had neurologically
favorable survival. Overall, 9.1% had neurologically favor-
able survival at discharge, substantially higher than the 3.2%
and 5.1% favorable neurologic survival reported by Kitamura
et al19 and Akahane et al,15 respectively, in Japan.
These data also reveal a racial disparity in the provision
of BCPR. White children were much more likely to receive
BCPR compared with African American or Hispanic children.
A similar racial disparity has been observed in adult studies.
Becker et al20 studied 6451 adults with nontraumatic OHCA
in the Chicago, Illinois, area between 1987 and 1988 and
found that African American adults were less likely to
receive BCPR, have a witnessed cardiac arrest, have a shock-
able rhythm, or be admitted to a hospital. More recently,
Sasson et al21 studied 14 225 adults with cardiac arrest from
the CARES registry and found that patients who had an
OHCA in low-income and predominantly African American
neighborhoods were less likely to receive BCPR than those in
high-income and predominantly white neighborhoods. A
study examining whether race/ethnicity was an independent
predictor of survival to hospital discharge when controlled
for income observed 1690 adults with OHCA in an affluent
population and found that race/ethnicity did not predict
adverse outcomes; however, African American individuals
were less likely to receive BCPR compared with white indi-
viduals (11% vs 20%; P = .002).22 This report suggests a
potential target for intervention in African American and
Hispanic communities where a public health strategy can be
undertaken to enhance BCPR in children.
In the present study, COR was provided as commonly as
conventional CPR. Neurologically favorable survival was more
likely to occur after conventional CPR. A recent study from
Japan23 on the association of dispatcher-assisted CPR on neu-
rological outcomes in children with OHCA had similar find-
ings, with a benefit of conventional CPR over COR on overall
survival and neurologically favorable outcome 1 month fol-
lowing OHCA. Another study from Japan by Kitamura et al19
evaluated the association of the type of BCPR in children with
OHCAinwhichone-thirdofchildrenreceivedconventionalCPR
and another 17% received COR. For children with arrests from
noncardiac causes, conventional CPR had improved neuro-
logical outcomes compared with COR; however, in children
with arrests from cardiac causes, both conventional and COR
were similarly effective.19 The current study was not able to
differentiate etiology of cardiac arrest, although conven-
tional CPR was associated with improved overall outcomes
compared with COR.
Most pediatric OHCAs occurred in infants, similar to pre-
vious studies.2 Most of these arrests were most likely sec-
ondary to sudden infant death syndrome,7 which is usually
unwitnessed, discovered long after death has occurred. This
is in stark contrast to the outcomes of in-hospital cardiac
arrests, which are generally witnessed and where infants
have the greatest survival rates.24,25 There was no observed
benefit of BCPR for infants unless ventilations were per-
formed, which was not the case in older children. For chil-
dren older than 1 year, there was a significant benefit of
bystander COR and conventional CPR compared with no
BCPR. As the survival rate among infants remains low and
public health campaigns stress the provision of chest com-
pressions over ventilations (a more difficult technique),
alternative public health strategies may be needed to
improve outcomes in this age group.
This study has several limitations. The data are observa-
tional and therefore may be associated with unmeasured con-
founding. Determining the etiology of a cardiac arrest in the
field is problematic, so all nontraumatic etiologies were con-
sidered regardless of the presumed initial field etiology that
was chosen. However, multiple previous reports describe re-
spiratory disease as the most common etiology of OHCA in
children.7,8 Type of BCPR is a supplemental element in CARES
and therefore was not available for all arrests because only a
subset of agencies chose to enter this data element. In addi-
tion, there were missing data for 72 patients, who were ex-
cluded from analysis. This study did not include CPR quality
data; however, previous studies show that CPR quality in
children is poor even when performed by professional
rescuers,26,27andpresumably,theprovisionoflow-qualityCPR
is better than no CPR. There were no data on the duration of
CPR or time to CPR. In addition, there is no long-term
follow-up of survivors.

Bystander CPR is associated with improved outcomes in chil-
dren with OHCA. Conventional BCPR is associated with
improved outcomes compared with COR, and among infants,
there was no benefit of BCPR unless ventilations were pro-
vided.EffortstoimprovetheprovisionofCPRinminoritycom-
