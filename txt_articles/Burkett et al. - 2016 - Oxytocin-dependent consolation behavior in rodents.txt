COMPARATIVE BEHAVIOR
Oxytocin-dependent consolation
behavior in rodents

Consolation behavior toward distressed others is common in humans and great apes,
yet our ability to explore the biological mechanisms underlying this behavior is limited
by its apparent absence in laboratory animals. Here, we provide empirical evidence that
a rodent species, the highly social and monogamous prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster),
greatly increases partner-directed grooming toward familiar conspecifics (but not strangers)
that have experienced an unobserved stressor, providing social buffering. Prairie voles also
match the fear response, anxiety-related behaviors, and corticosterone increase of the
stressed cagemate, suggesting an empathy mechanism. Exposure to the stressed cagemate
increases activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, and oxytocin receptor antagonist infused
into this region abolishes the partner-directed response, showing conserved neural
mechanisms between prairie vole and human.
C
onsolation, which entails comforting con-
tact directed at a distressed party, is a com-
mon empathetic response in humans that
emerges in the second year of life (1). Until
now, consolation behavior has only been
documented in a few nonhuman species and
only in the context of naturally occurring ag-
gressive conflicts, as first described in great apes
(2, 3) and subsequently in canids (4, 5), corvids
(6, 7), and elephants (8). These observations have,
so far, been taken to mean that consolation be-
havior may require advanced cognitive capacities
(9). Nonetheless, rodents also manifest some of
the empathy-related capacities (10–16) thought
to underlie consolation in humans and chimpan-
zees (1, 17). If consolation behavior were to be ob-
served outside of species with advanced cognition,
this would suggest that it rests on much older,
more widespread, and less cognitive capacities
and may be variably expressed because of species-
specific evolutionary context. Moreover, observing
consolation behavior in a laboratory rodent under
reproducible conditions would allow for empir-
ical research on causal biological mechanisms
relevant to human mental health.
Rodents in the genus Microtus display diverse
mating strategies and social structures. The prairie
vole (Microtus ochrogaster) is a socially monog-
amous, biparental rodent species in which both
males and females may participate in philopatric
cooperative breeding in the parental nest (18).
These social traits frequently coevolve with other
cooperative or altruistic behaviors that increase
direct or indirect fitness, including social buffer-
ing among colony members (19). In contrast,
closely related meadow voles (M. pennsylvanicus)
are promiscuous breeders with no formal social
structure that show comparatively abbreviated,
uniparental care of pups (20). We hypothesized
that the prairie vole, but not the meadow vole,
would show consolation behavior under repro-
ducible laboratory conditions. Additionally, we
hypothesized that as suggested for humans and
great apes, consolation behavior in the prairie
vole would be based on an empathy mechanism.
Last, we hypothesized that consolation behavior
would be mediated by conserved neurobiological
and neurochemical mechanisms consistent with
those implicated in empathy in humans.
Consolation behavior has been defined as an
increase in affiliative contact in response to and
directed toward a distressed individual, such as a
victim of aggression, by an uninvolved bystander,
which produces a calming effect (2). This defi-
nition emphasizes victims of aggression due to
observational constraints in naturalistic studies.
In humans, the definition includes individuals
experiencing stress from other sources (1), a
strategy used in elephants (8) and suggested for
primates (9). On the basis of this research, we
first developed a set of laboratory conditions
under which unstressed male and female prairie
voles (“observers”) would respond spontaneously
and selectively to stressed conspecifics (“demon-
strators”) with a prosocial, other-directed be-
havior (the “consolation test”) (Fig. 1A). In this
protocol, an observer and a demonstrator housed
together are separated from each other, and the
demonstrator either sits alone in a home cage
compartment or is exposed to a stressor con-
sisting of five tones paired with light foot-shocks
(0.8 mA, 0.5 s) distributed over the course of
24 min (Pavlovian fear conditioning). The dem-
onstrator is then reunited with the naïve ob-
server, and the natural response is recorded and
measured. Under these experimental conditions,
lickingandgroomingdirectedby observers toward
demonstrators (or “allogrooming”) was signifi-
cantly longer in duration (time-treatment inter-
action, F1,11 = 6.7, P < 0.025) and shorter in latency
(t11 = 3.9, P < 0.003) after a separation during
which the demonstrator was stressed (Fig. 1B
and fig. S1). Prairie vole observers did not in-
crease allogrooming toward demonstrators after
a control separation, demonstrating the selectivity
of the response. Both male and female observers

 showed this behavioral response, differing only
in baseline allogrooming (sex-time interaction,
F1,73 = 6.4, P < 0.015) (fig. S2). Meta-analysis
across 13 experiments shows that observers ini-
tiate allogrooming within the first minute and
continue for at least the first 10 min of reunion
time (Fig. 1C, figs. S3 and S4, and table S1). Ad-
ditionally, stressed demonstrators that rested
alone in the home cage after the stressor sub-
sequently showed increased anxiety-like behav-
ior relative to unstressed controls, whereas those
that interacted with the observer for the same
period of time showed completely normalized
anxiety behavior (interaction effect, F2,63 = 3.2,
P < 0.05) (Fig. 1D). This suggests that the ob-
server provided social buffering to the demon-
strator, which is consistent with other studies
showing stress reduction in rodents (21, 22) and
primates (3, 23). In contrast, meadow vole ob-
servers showed no differences in allogrooming
based on the stress state of the demonstrator
(fig. S5). The combination of a selective in-
crease in directed affiliation with a social buf-
fering effect supports the designation of the
prairie vole’s natural response as a consolation
behavior.
The observation that prairie voles detect the
stress state of conspecifics and form a directed
prosocial response raises the question of whether
the behavior is empathy-based. The empathy hy-
pothesis was tested by assaying for some of its
purported characteristics in human and other
mammalian species, including emotional con-
tagion, state matching, familiarity bias, and self-
other differentiation (24–26). In accordance,
prairie vole observers showed behavioral re-
sponses consistent with emotional contagion by
mimicking the anxiety- and fear-related behav-
iors of stressed demonstrators (Fig. 2). Observ-
ers interacting with a stressed demonstrator after
separation matched the increase in self-grooming
shown by the demonstrator (main effect of time,
F1,23 = 12.7, P < 0.002) (Fig. 2A). Additionally,
when observing a fear-conditioned demonstra-
tor freezing during presentations of the con-
ditioned stimulus (tones), the unconditioned
observers showed an increase in freezing (main
effect of time, F1,22 = 22.2, P < 0.0002) (Fig. 2B)
concurrently with the demonstrator’s freezing
(Fig. 2C). Observers separated from stressed
demonstrators across a clear, perforated barrier
had significantly elevated plasma corticosterone
afterward (main effect of barrier, F2,27 = 4.8, P <
0.017) (Fig. 3A), which strongly correlated with
that of the demonstrator (stressor, R2 = 0.82, P <
0.001; separation, R2 < 0.01, P > 0.98; difference
between correlations, Fisher’s transformation,
Z = 2.8, P < 0.006) (Fig. 3B), representing a clear
example of physiological state–matching similar
to that attributed to empathy in humans (27). Ob-
servers in full contact with demonstrators with-
out a barrier showed no increase, suggesting that
active performance of consolation behavior may
ameliorate the observer’s physiological stress re-
sponse. Consolation behavior was significantly
biased toward familiar individuals: Although
baseline allogrooming did not differ between
groups containing mates, siblings, cagemates,
and strangers, observers directed consolation
behavior only toward familiar stressed demonstra-
tors and not toward stressed strangers (time-
relation interaction, F2,73 = 13.6, P < 0.0001; main
effect of relation, F2,73 = 26.6, P < 0.0001; cage-
mates, t(8) = –6.1, P < 0.0003) (Fig. 3C and figs.
S6 and S7). Last, although observers and stressed
demonstrators both showed signs of anxiety
and stress during reunion, observers increased
allogrooming toward demonstrators, whereas
demonstrators themselves did not alter their
allogrooming (time-subject interaction, F1,70 =
35.6, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3D). This differential re-
sponse dependent on the source of the individ-
ual’s stress (vicarious or personal) is an example
of self-other differentiation, which shows that
the allogrooming response is not a general stress-
coping behavior.
The combination of behavioral and physiolog-
ical state matching in the observer shows that
the observer is not neutral to the stress state of
the demonstrator, as might be predicted if the
allogrooming response were purely information-
gathering behavior. Empathy-related responses
and behaviors are biased toward familiar in-
dividuals in many species, including humans
(10, 11, 17, 28); the allogrooming response in
prairie voles is also selective for familiar con-
specifics (including unrelated long-term cage-
mates), representing a true social behavior rather
than reproductive or kinship-related. Addition-
ally, the lack of response toward strangers shows
that observers are not simply reacting to aversive

 cues. Whereas some empathy-related studies used
training or conditioning (15, 16, 29, 30), the con-
solation test in the present experiments was ad-
ministered only once to each set of subjects and
therefore captured unconditioned responses. The
focus on unconditioned responses means that the
consolation test does not assume or necessarily
require any particular cognitive capacities, includ-
ing conscious knowledge or perspective taking—
which, in a multilayered view of empathy, may
be included but are not required (24–26). Several
empathy-related paradigms require priming the
observer with direct exposure to the stressor
(12–15); in contrast, observers in the present pa-
radigm neither experienced nor witnessed the
stressor, and therefore self-referential anticipa-
tion of a threat can be ruled out as an expla-
nation. Last, a novel experience alone was not
sufficient to elicit a consolation response in ab-
sence of a stressor (time-treatment interaction,
F1,16 = 7.1, P = 0.017) (fig. S8). This confluence of
evidence and exclusion of alternative explana-
tions supports the interpretation that an empa-
thy mechanism underlies the increase in affiliative
behavior in prairie voles in response to a stressed
conspecific.
In humans, the oxytocin receptor (OTR) has
been linked to empathy, emotion recognition,
and socioemotional engagement (31–33). Observ-
ers that received an injection of an oxytocin an-
tagonist (OTA) into the cerebral ventricle before
the consolation test did not change their base-
line allogrooming but showed no consolation
response (time-treatment interaction, F1,27 =
5.0, P < 0.04) (Fig. 4A), demonstrating that OTR
activation in the brain is necessary for consola-
tion behavior. The prairie vole anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC), adjacent prelimbic cortex (PLC),
and nucleus accumbens shell (NACS) all express
high densities of OTR (Fig. 4B); in humans, the
ACC and homologous medial prefrontal cortex
have been linked to empathy (34), and the NACS
is typically linked to social and nonsocial reward
(35). Using immunohistochemistry targeting the
immediate early gene protein FOS, we deter-
mined that the ACC, but not PLC or NACS, is
differentially active in observers interacting with
stressed demonstrators as compared with un-
stressed demonstrators (treatment-region interac-
tion, F2,34 = 6.7, P < 0.004; post-hoc t test, P < 0.02
uncorrected) (Fig. 4, C and D, and fig. S9). This
result was validated in observers exposed to
stressed demonstrators across a clear perforated
barrier (t test, P < 0.04) (fig. S10), suggesting
that the difference in activity was due to expo-
sure to the stressed demonstrator rather than
caused by the observer’s behavior. Following
these results, we hypothesized that oxytocin may
act region-specifically on OTR in the ACC to en-
able consolation behavior. An injection of OTA
directly into ACC abolished the consolation
response in observers (time-treatment interac-
tion, F1,13 = 7.4, P < 0.02) (Fig. 4E and fig. S11A),
whereas injections into adjacent PLC had no
effect (Fig. 4F and fig. S11B); this shows that OTR
signaling within the ACC modulates consolation,
possibly by disrupting physiological, emotional,

 and/or behavioral responses. This evidence dem-
onstrates that the ACC is one node where activity
increases during interaction with a stressed con-
specific, and where OTR activation is necessary for
the expression of consolation behavior. These
neural substrates suggest conserved biological
mechanisms for consolation behavior between
prairie vole and human.
The presence of consolation behavior in prairie
voles demonstrates that this behavior does not
require advanced cognitive capacities, and the
conserved neurobiology of consolation between
prairie voles and humans suggests a deep ho-
mology of the underlying neural substrates. The
ancestralbiologicalmechanismssupportingmater-
nal care in mammals have likely served as the
basis from which many complex social behaviors
evolved, including empathy (24, 36) and pair
bonding (37), both of which involve the reorient-
ing of parental behaviors toward adult con-
specifics. Nonetheless, the confirmed absence
of consolation in the closely related meadow vole
and in most macaques (9, 38) shows that con-
solation behavior emerges only under particular
social and evolutionary conditions. Understand-
ing the neurobiology of oxytocin-dependent con-
solation behavior in prairie voles may help us to
understand the diverse deficits in detecting and
responding to the emotions of others that are
present in many psychiatric conditions, includ-
ing autism, schizophrenia, and psychopathy.

Fig. 4. Neural mechanisms of consolation behavior. (A) Observers re-
ceived an intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of OTA (n = 16 voles) or
vehicle (n = 12 voles) before the consolation test. Bars represent mean ± SEM.
(B) Receptor autoradiographs show the presence of OTR in prairie vole PLC,
ACC, and NACS. (C) Observers were administered a consolation test with
control separations (n = 10 voles) or separations with stressor (n = 9 voles).
Bars represent mean ± SEM. (D) Images show FOS immunoreactivity in the
right ACC of observers representing the mean from each treatment group.
Dashed circles show the quantified area. cc, corpus callosum. (E) Observers
received a bilateral injection of OTA (n = 8 voles) or vehicle (n =7 voles) directly
into the ACC before the consolation test. Bars represent mean ± SEM. (F)
