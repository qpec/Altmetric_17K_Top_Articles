Abstract
Importance, Objective—Studies on the relation between service attendance and mortality often 
have been limited by inadequate methodology for reverse causation, inability to assess effects over 
time, and limited information on mediators and cause-specific mortality.
Design, Setting, Participants, Main Outcomes and Measures—We evaluated 
associations between attendance and mortality in a prospective cohort, the Nurses’ Health Study 
(NHS), which included 74,534 women who were free of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer 
at baseline. Religious service attendance was assessed by a self-reported question and was 
collected in 1992 and every four years subsequently. We used Cox proportional hazard model and 
marginal structural models with time-varying covariates to examine the association of religious 
service attendance with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. We adjusted for a wide range of 
demographic covariates, lifestyle factors and medical history measured repeatedly during the 
follow-up, and performed sensitivity analyses to examine the influence of potential unmeasured 
and residual confounding.
Results—During follow-up from 1996 until 2012, we identified 13,537 deaths, including 2,721 
due to cardiovascular diseases and 4,479 due to cancer. After multivariate adjustment for major 
lifestyle, risk factors and attendance in 1992, attending religious service more than once/week was 
associated with 33% lower all-cause mortality, compared with women who had never attended 
religious services (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62–0.71, p for trend 
<0.0001). Comparing women who attended religious services more than once per week with those 
who never attend, the HR for cardiovascular mortality was 0.73 (0.62–0.85, p for trend <0.0001); 
and cancer mortality was 0.79 (0.70–0.89, p for trend <0.0001). Results were robust in sensitivity 
analysis. We found evidence that social support, depressive symptoms, smoking and optimism 
mediated the relationship between attendance and mortality.

Background
The World Health Organization defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental, and 
social well-being”1. Certain religious groups and others likewise view health holistically and 
emphasize the unity of body, mind, and spirit2–4. Health is often viewed as an inseparable 
component of spiritual well-being within some religious understandings5,6. Religious 
participation and beliefs can affect individual behavior, shift cognition and emotion, promote 
compassion, shape communities and public life, and may otherwise promote well-being and 
health/wholeness, but religion can also promote guilt, anxiety, violence and intolerance. A 
priori its effects on health are not thus immediately clear. Religious practice is common in 
America: Approximately 65% of Americans consider religion to be an important part of life, 
83% report praying to God in the last week and 43% report having attended a religious 
service in the past week7,8.
A meta-analysis of studies related to the connection between religious service attendance 
and mortality between 1994 and 2009 concluded that “religious service attendance helped 
reduce mortality by 18% in healthy populations”9–12. Research on religion and health has 
led to some controversy. Sloan et al. questioned the validity of these studies and argued that 
the evidence is often weak and unconvincing with poor methodology and study design13,14. 
Denberg et al. criticized this kind of “research” as “simply reporting an association and then 
calling for more future research” arguing it was “trivial and unworthy of publication”15. 
Koenig et al. responded that Sloan et al.’s review was highly selective and biased with a 
misunderstanding of the epidemiological method16.
Much of the debate concerned major methodological limitations in previous studies9,17 that 
it was difficult to infer causality and that the observed association could be due to reverse 
causation if only healthy participants are able to attend services. Some stronger longitudinal 
studies have been published18–20.
However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has used methodology for 
repeated measures and time-dependent confounding that handles potential reverse causation 
between service attendance and health and evaluates “incident” rather than “prevalent” 
religious service attendance with mortality. We propose to address these issues using the 
Nurses’ Health Study, a large prospective cohort study among U.S. women with repeated 
measurements of religious service attendance, including detailed information on dietary, 
lifestyle, medical history and long-term follow-up. In addition, we could assess interactions 
with race, time-varying effects, and cause-specific mortality.

 Methods
Study design
The Nurses’ Health study (NHS) began in 1976 and included 121,700 nurses aged 30–55 
years from across the United States21. Information on lifestyle and medical history was 
collected using a self-administered questionnaire at baseline and every 2 years thereafter. 
Religious service attendance information was self-reported first in 1992, and every four 
years subsequently, in response to the question: “How often do you go to religious meetings 
or services? Response categories include “more than once a week, once a week, 1–3 times 
per month, less than once per month, never or almost never”. We defined baseline for this 
analysis as attendance as assessed in 1996; we used attendance in 1992 as an additional 
covariate. Follow-up for mortality continued until 2012. Participants who died before the 
baseline 1996, or did not reply to the 1996 questionnaire (n=27,122), who had 1996 
religious service attendance missing (n=7,246), or had a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease 
(n=4,362) or cancer (n=8,457, except non-melanoma skin cancer) before 1996 were 
excluded. Participants were followed up from the return of the 1996 questionnaire until 
death, loss of follow-up, or the end of follow-up at June 2012, whichever came first. Our 
study includes 74,534 participants with 1,104,175, person years. We identified 13,537 total 
deaths, 2,721 cardiovascular deaths and 4,479 cancer deaths during follow up. The study 
protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of Brigham and Women’s Hospital 
and Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health.
Outcome
All-cause and cause-specific mortality was assessed between the return of the 1996 
questionnaire and the end of follow-up (June 2012). Death events were identified through 
reports from next of kin and the National Death Index. We identified causes of death based 
on family reports, death certificates, and medical record. We searched in the National Death 
Index for names of non-responders and this has been shown to have good sensitivity and 
specificity22. We used International Classification of Diseases code, 8th revision (ICD-8) to 
define cancer related deaths (ICD:140–207), and cardiovascular disease related deaths (ICD: 
390–459 and 795). We used the following ICD codes to identify detailed subcategories of 
cardiovascular disease and cancer: ischaemic heart disease (IHD; ICD codes 410–414), 
cerebrovascular disease (430–438), and any other CVD (ICD codes 390–459 and 795 
excluding 410–414 and 430–438); cancers of the lung (ICD code 162), breast (174), ovaries 
(183), pancreas (157), colon or rectum (153), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (200, 202, 204), 
and cancer of other sites.
Covariates
We adjusted the analyses for the following known predictors of mortality in this cohort: age 
(continuous, years), alcohol consumption (none, 0.1–4.9, 5.0–14.9, ≥15.0 g/d), physical 
exercise (metabolic equivalent hours per week; quintiles), multivitamin use (yes, no), 
hypertension (yes, no), hypercholesterolemia (yes, no), type 2 diabetes (yes, no), 
menopausal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal) and post-menopausal hormone use 
(never, past and current), physical exam in the past 2 years (no, yes for symptoms and yes 
for screenings), Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 score (quintiles)23, smoking status

 (never, former, current), pack-years (<10, 10–19, 20–39, ≥40 pack-years for former smokers; 
<25, 25–44, 45–64, ≥65 pack-years for current smokers), BMI (kg/m2; <21, 21–22.9, 23–
24.9, 25–27.4, 27.5–29.9, 30–34.9, ≥35), husband’s education (less than high school, some 
high school, high school graduate, college, graduate school), good physical function 
(defined as absence of limitations in moderate activities or moderate limitations in 
demanding activities, yes, no24,25), social integration score (social integration was derived 
included the following 6 components: Marital status, other group participation, number of 
close friends, number of close relatives, number of close friends see at least once per month, 
number of close relatives seen at least once per month26, quartiles), living alone (yes, no), 
median income of the family (dollars per year, quintiles), geographic region (north, south, 
middle, other), depression in 1992 (yes, no), and religious service attendance in 1992 (never, 
< 1/week, ≥ 1/week). Indicator variables were used for any missing covariate information for 
categorical variables and median imputation was used for missing continuous covariates.
For mediation analysis, covariate measurements prior to the religious attendance exposure 
were taken as potential confounders and those subsequent to religious attendance exposures 
were taken as potential mediators. For mediators, we considered the first measure available 
subsequent to 1996 which included depressive symptoms in 2000 measured using the Center 
for Epidemiologic Studies Depression-10 (CESD-10)27, smoking, alcohol consumption, and 
diet quality in 1998, number of close friends and have someone close to talk to in 2000, and 
optimism and phobic anxiety in 2004 measured using the Crown-Crisp Index (CCI)28.
Statistical analyses
We examined the association of religious service attendance with all-cause and cause-
specific mortality using various analytic strategies including Cox proportional hazard 
models and marginal structural models with weights accounting for missing data and 
censoring. The marginal structural models account for reverse causation and time-varying 
confounding by weighting and are described at length elsewhere, and also in the online 
supplement29,30. Person time was accrued from baseline (return of the 1996 questionnaire) 
until the date of death, loss to follow up, or June 2012, whichever came first. We calculated 
hazard ratios and its 95% confidence interval comparing frequency of religious services 
attendance (more than, or equal to, or less than once per week) vs. never attend, for all-cause 
mortality and cause-specific mortality. For cause-specific mortality, we also further adjusted 
for cause-specific risk factors. Linear trends across categories of religious service attendance 
were tested by modeling attendance frequency as a continuous variable. Confounders were 
adjusted for in 1992 in the proportional hazards models; confounders were updated over 
time in the marginal structural model. We examined the joint effect of religious service 
attendance in 1996 and 2000 with all-cause mortality. We further stratified the analysis by 
race/ethnic groups (among Caucasians and African Americans only), and religious group 
(among Catholic and Protestant only). Likelihood ratio tests were used to assess the 
significance of the interaction. The relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) and its 95% 
confidence interval were calculated31,32.
We applied mediation analysis methods33,34 to examine proportions of the association 
between religious service attendance in 1996 and mortality in 2012 that was mediated by the

 following factors: current smoking, alcohol intake, and diet quality in 1998, social support 
and depressive symptoms in 2000, phobic anxiety in 2004, optimism in 2004, and 
components of social integration in 2000 (including currently married, number of close 
friends, number of close relatives, seen close friends at least once per month, seen close 
relatives at least once per month, and hours of social group participation). For the mediation 
analysis, we further excluded participants who had mediator information missing, or who 
died between baseline and the mediator measurement. These mediators were selected a 
priori based on subject knowledge and assessed using multivariate logistic regression and 
linear regression models of the outcome and of the potential mediator, the results of which 
are then combined to estimate direct and indirect effects33,34. Methods for mediation assume 
baseline covariates suffice to control for exposure-outcome, mediator-outcome, and 
exposure-mediator confounding. Proportion mediated on a risk difference scale was 
calculated as the indirect effect divided by total effect and tests were conducted for evidence 
of mediation.
We conducted several sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results. To minimize 
the influence of reverse causation, we additionally performed subgroup analyses among 
participants who were free living (not living in a nursing home), never smokers, with no 
physical or functional limitations, no major medical comorbidities (such as depression), and 
exclusion of death events in the first 4 years of follow up. We compared effects sizes of 
religious service attendance with other components of social integration and with other 
covariates. We also updated covariates, modeled service attendance as time varying 
exposure, compared hazard ratios over different specific time frames of follow-up, and with 
different analytic strategies as sensitivity analyses. We examined the change of service 
attendance over time, and also calculated years of live saved35. We further assessed how 
substantial residual unmeasured confounding would need to be to explain away the observed 
associations36,37.
Results
Among 74,534 women at 1996 baseline with reported religious service attendance, 14,158 
women attended more than once per week, 30,401 attended once per week, 12,103 attended 
less than once per week, and 17,872 never attended (Table 1). A majority of our study 
participants were Catholic or Protestant. Women who attended religious services more 
frequently tended to have fewer depressive symptoms; were less likely to be current 
smokers; and more likely to be married (Table 1). During follow up, a large majority of 
participants maintained their levels of service attendance but there was also considerable 
movement across all categories (eTable 1).
Using a Cox proportional hazard model, compared with women who never attended 
religious services, women who attended regularly had lower mortality in follow-up (Figure 
1) with multivariate adjusted HR=0.67 (95%CI: 0.62–0.71) for those attending more than 
once per week in 1996; HR=0.74 (95%CI: 0.70–0.78) for those attending weekly and 
HR=0.87 (95%CI: 0.81–0.92) for those attending less than weekly (p for trend <0.0001). 
Those who attended regularly in both 2000 and 1996 had even lower mortality rates with 
multivariate adjusted HR=0.55 (95%CI: 0.52–0.59) (Table 2). When using marginal

 structural models to better address potential feedback and reverse causation, the effect sizes 
were similar (Table 2). Results were also similar in analyses among participants who were 
free living, never smokers, with no physical or functional limitations, no major medical 
comorbidities (such as depression), and exclusion of death events in the first 4 years of 
follow up (eTable2, 3). Effect size of religious service attendance was comparable to 
physical activity and BMI (eTable 4). The inverse association between service attendance 
and mortality were consistent over time (eTable5). Religious service attendance was 
associated with 0.43 (95%CI: −0.09 −1.54) years longer survival for women who regularly 
attend services once per week or more (eTable 6).
In the Cox model, for an unmeasured confounder to explain away the hazard ratio estimate 
of 0.67, the unmeasured confounder would have to both increase the likelihood of service 
attendance and decrease the likelihood of mortality by 2.35-fold, above and beyond the 
measured confounders. For an unmeasured confounder to bring the upper confidence limit 
of 0.71 for this estimate above 1, the unmeasured confounder would still have to both 
increase the likelihood of service attendance and decrease the likelihood of mortality by 
2.16-fold. Similar substantial confounding would be needed to explain away the other 
estimates.
For cause-specific mortality, frequent religious service attendance was also inversely 
associated with cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality, with HR=0.73 (0.62–0.85, p 
for trend<0.0001), and 0.79 (0.70–0.89, p for trend<0.0001) respectively (Table 3). 
Attendance was associated with lower cerebrovascular disease and other cardiovascular 
diseases mortality, but not ischemic heart disease (eTable 7). For site specific cancer 
mortality, frequent religious service attendance is associated with significantly lower risk of 
breast cancer mortality and colorectal cancer mortality, but not for other sites of cancer 
(eTable 8). Although attendance was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality and 
cancer mortality, attendance was not associated with breast cancer incidence (eTable 9) and 
only weakly associated with incidence of cardiovascular disease (eTable 10).
Comparing Caucasians and African Americans, the hazard ratio comparing those attending 
more than once per week to not at all was 0.88 (0.85–0.92) for Caucasians and 0.64 (0.46–
0.90) for African Americans, though multiplicative interaction between the effect of 
attendance on mortality by race was not statistically significant (p for interaction =0.08, 
eTable 11). The hazard ratios for service attendance were comparable for Protestants and 
Catholics; for each level of service attendance, Catholics had slightly lower mortality than 
Protestants (eTable 12). We further compared the magnitude of the association of religious 
service attendance with other aspects of social integration and found that the inverse 
association with mortality was strongest for religious service attendance (eTable 13).
We used mediation analysis to estimate the proportion of the association that was mediated 
through each mediator. Depressive symptoms, smoking, social support and optimism were 
potentially important mediators, though the overall proportion of the association that was 
mediated through each mediator was moderate e.g. smoking explained about 22% of the 
effect, social support 23% etc. (Table 4).

 Discussion
In this large prospective cohort of U.S. nurses, we found a consistent inverse association 
between frequent religious service attendance and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular 
mortality and cancer mortality. Compared with women who never attended religious 
services, women who attended more than once per week had 33% lower mortality risk; 
results were robust across different race/ethnicity groups, different analytic strategies and in 
sensitivity analyses.
In examining the potential pathways from religious service to all-cause mortality, we found 
that depressive symptoms, smoking, social support and optimism were potentially important 
mediators. No single mediator explained more than about 25% of the effect. There may be 
many pathways from religious service attendance to health. However, the proportion of 
effects mediated may be underestimated as mediators were considered only at a single point 
in time, and are measured imperfectly. Moreover, some individuals died before the mediators 
occurred and were excluded further which may affect our results. Future studies 
implementing causal mediation analysis with time-varying religious service attendance, 
time-varying mediators, and confounders are warranted. Other mechanisms that have been 
proposed that were not assessed here include increasing psychosocial resilience, religious 
coping mechanisms, purpose in life, and improving self-discipline38.
Our findings were consistent with previous study findings and the effect sizes were similar 
or somewhat larger, especially when examining associations with consistent pattern of 
service attendance. Literature supports the notion that religious service attendance is 
associated with better health and reduced mortality14,39–44. In our study, we were able to 
account for time-dependent confounding and examined the association between repeated 
measures of religious service attendance with long-term all-cause and cause-specific 
mortality. Although our study was not targeted to a particular religious group, the study in 
fact consists mainly of Caucasian Christians. Our results might not be generalizable to the 
general population, or to other countries, or to areas with limited religious freedom. Our 
study moreover consists of U.S. nurses with similar socioeconomic status who tend to be 
more health conscious. Our analysis is also restricted to the specific time period under 
consideration and the effects of service attendance may vary over time as the nature of 
attendance itself changes. Although frequency of service attendance did not substantially 
change in our study, it is possible that the content of the services themselves changed and 
this needs to be taken into account in interpretation. Further research could examine other 
religious practices, mindfulness practices, other aspects of spirituality and religiosity, other 
race/ethnicity and demographic groups, and could also further investigate the potential 
underlying mechanisms45,46. Our results do not imply that health care providers should 
prescribe religious service attendance, but for those who do already hold religious beliefs, 
service attendance could be encouraged as a form of meaningful social participation.
One limitation of our study is that we only have one single domain measure of religiosity or 
spirituality, namely, service attendance. This captures only one aspect of religiosity and may 
be subject to measurement error and over-reporting47–49, though with over-reporting the 
relative ordering of frequency might still be preserved. There is no reason to think that 
Shanshan et al.

 individual over-reporting would be related to mortality, and such non-differential 
misclassification in fact tends to yield conservative effect estimates50. Our finding of 
substantially lower breast cancer mortality in frequent attenders, despite no association for 
breast cancer incidence, lends support to an effect of social participation, and enhances the 
plausibility of our results. Religious service attendance may be highly correlated with other 
measures of social engagement, such as number of close friends and having someone close 
to talk to, which are significant predictors for lower mortality and thus may serve as 
important mechanisms. However, a number of studies of the health effects of religious 
attendance4,51 have examined the role of other measures of social engagement and find that 
religious attendance has robust effects even after the inclusion of these measures. In our 
study, this was also the case, and we moreover found that the inverse association with 
mortality was driven substantially by religious service attendance.
Clearly a randomized trial of religious service attendance is neither ethical nor feasible. Our 
study is an observational study. Although we adjusted for major confounders for the 
association between religious service attendance and mortality, the results may still be 
subject to unmeasured confounders and residual confounding. Personal, social, 
psychological, and socio-economic characteristics that may confound service attendance 
could be a potentially plausible explanation for the association. Some of the mediators are 
also potential confounders, which we adjusted at baseline. However, we performed 
sensitivity analyses techniques to assess how strong unmeasured confounding would need to 
be to explain away the observed association. For an unmeasured confounder to explain away 
the association of service attendance and mortality it would have to both increase the 
likelihood of service attendance and decrease the likelihood of mortality by 2.35-fold, above 
and beyond the measured covariates. Such substantial confounding by unmeasured factors 
seems unlikely given adjustment for an extensive set of covariates. We also performed 
subgroup analyses among participants who were free living, never smokers, no physical or 
functional limitations, no major medical comorbidities (such as depression), and exclusion 
of death events in the first 4 years of follow up, and estimates were similar.
Strengths of our study include a large sample size, long duration of follow-up, prospective 
cohort study design, and repeated measures of religious service attendance, analytic methods 
for feedback and reverse causation, and extensive confounding control. We have clear 
temporality of the exposure, covariates and outcome, and also have been able to adjust for 
baseline religious service attendance, baseline confounders, and account for time-dependent 
confounding. Our results were robust to methodology to address potential reverse causation.
Conclusion
In this large prospective long-term cohort study of US women, frequent religious service 
attendance, particularly recent service attendance, was associated with lower all-cause 
mortality, cardiovascular and cancer mortality.

(yes, no), median family income (continuous, dollars per year), geographic region (north, 
south, west, other), and religious service attendance in 1992 (never, < 1/week, ≥ 1/week). 
Social integration score, including score and frequency of relatives and friends were derived 
based on the definition from Am J Epidemiol 1979;109:186–204. For adjustment, we 
derived social integration score without religious service attendance components.
