SUMMARY
Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in GRIN2B, a subunit of the NMDA receptor, cause intellectual disability and language impair-
ment. We developed clonal models of GRIN2B deletion and loss-of-function mutations in a region coding for the glutamate binding
domain in human cells and generated neurons from a patient harboring a missense mutation in the same domain. Transcriptome anal-
ysis revealed extensive increases in genes associated with cell proliferation and decreases in genes associated with neuron differentiation,
a result supported by extensive protein analyses. Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we demonstrate that NMDA receptors are
present on neural progenitor cells and that human mutations in GRIN2B can impair calcium influx and membrane depolarization even in
a presumed undifferentiated cell state, highlighting an important role for non-synaptic NMDA receptors. It may be this function, in part,
which underlies the neurological disease observed in patients with GRIN2B mutations.
INTRODUCTION
N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) are widely
expressed in neurons and are composed of different sub-
units that form specific types of functional glutamate re-
ceptors. NMDARs are made up of an assortment of four
subunits in a combination of two dimers (Salussolia et al.,
2011; Sheng et al., 1994), where the GRIN1 subunit is the
only essential member and the most genetically distant
from other members (Cull-Candy et al., 2001). Subunit
composition of NMDARs confers different biophysical
properties on NMDARs such as glutamate binding affin-
ities, activation/deactivation kinetics, or ion conductance
(Cull-Candy et al., 2001). Subunit expression patterns are
often specific to developmental location or time window.
For example, inclusion of GRIN2 subunits A–D varies de-
pending on brain region and developmental time window
(Monyer et al., 1994), where GRIN2B is present in embry-
onic NMDARs but is replaced in postnatal NMDARs by
GRIN2A (Williams et al., 1993). The presence of GRIN2C
likely occurs only in the cerebellum and after birth, and
the presence GRIN3A and GRIN3B in NMDARs may influ-
ence synapse formation (Das et al., 1998). These consistent
patterns of GRIN1–3 expression suggest tight regulatory
control and highlight the tuning of NMDARs to signal
different effects in a cell.
The development of whole-genome sequencing technol-
ogies has allowed for major sequencing efforts of patients
with neurodevelopmental disorders, and has underscored
the importance of GRIN2B in human brain development.
Large cohort studies for intellectual disability or autism
spectrum disorders both have identified loss-of-function
(LOF) mutations in GRIN2B that cause a severe neurological
phenotype of broad spectrum (Endele et al., 2010; O’Roak
et al., 2011), a result supported by several case reports (Di-
massi et al., 2013; Freunscht et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2016).
Homozygous Grin2b-deletion mice die at early postnatal
stages due to impaired suckling response and show
impaired hippocampal long-term depression (Kutsuwada
et al., 1996), while heterozygous mice show reduced
expression of GRIN2B but survive. Human mutations in
GRIN2B identified as likely pathogenic lead to LOF of one
copy of the gene, a result consistent with a dominant ge-
netic disorder due to either haploinsufficiency (reduced
dosage [RD]) or production of a mutant gene product (Hu
et al., 2016), causing LOF. Fourteen percent (6/44) of hu-
man heterozygous GRIN2B mutation cases show gross
cortical anomalies (Platzer et al., 2017) as measured by
magnetic resonance imaging, while all mouse homozygous
Grin2b mutants have grossly normal cerebral cortices. The
large discrepancy in phenotype between human and
mouse GRIN2B mutants suggests that the role of GRIN2B
varies between the species.
While the role of GRIN2B in mature synapses, usually
within hippocampal circuits, is intensely studied (Bliss
and Collingridge, 1993), its role in neurodevelopment,

 particularly human brain development, is less well under-
stood. GRIN2B-NMDARs (i.e., those NMDARs that have
GRIN2B as a subunit) were initially hypothesized to be
important in interpreting early signaling cues in the em-
bryonic environment to guide neuronal differentiation
(Cohen and Greenberg, 2008) before synapses form. This
idea was supported by several studies from almost three de-
cades ago that suggested that NMDARs may be an impor-
tant part of neuronal differentiation in cortex, cerebellum,
and spinal cord (Balazs et al., 1988; Blanton et al., 1990;
Brenneman et al., 1990). NMDA receptors are also critical
for subventricular zone neural progenitor migration to
the cortex in mouse (Behar et al., 1999), an idea consistent
with the importance of NMDA receptors in neural stem
cells, an unambiguously non-synaptic developmental
time point as cells can still become neurons, astrocytes,
or oligodendrocytes. Given the reports of the importance
of GRIN2B in cell differentiation, we reasoned that muta-
tions in GRIN2B in human may lead to a neurodevelop-
mental disorder not only through its well-known role in
synaptic plasticity but through a role in differentiating
neural stem cells. To address this question without using
animal models of brain development, we elected to use hu-
man induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate
forebrain neurons.
RESULTS
Forebrain Neural Progenitor Cells Respond to NMDA
and Express GRIN1
After extensive quality control including mycoplasma
testing, endogenous marker staining, and molecular karyo-
typing in iPSCs (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1), we generated fore-
brain neural progenitor cells (NPCs) (Figures 1C and S2).
We define NPCs as committed forebrain progenitors that
cycle indefinitely in basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)
and epidermal growth factor (EGF) media and have the
potential to become astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or fore-
brain neurons. When these cells are differentiated for
30 days, >90% of Tuj1-positive cells express glutamatergic
(�60%) or GABAergic (�30%) markers, with a fraction
(�10%) expressing astrocytic makers (Figures 1D and 1E).
As NPCs differentiate, the ratio of GRIN2B/GRIN2A rises,
while cells matured for 30 days have an expression profile
closest to mouse subventricular zone radial precursor cells
at embryonic day 13.5 (Figure S3). Differentiated forebrain
NPCs form clusters as they mature into neurons and ex-
press synapsin-1 (Figures 1D and 1E). Differentiated cells
are electrically active and demonstrate spontaneous action
potentials (Figures 1H–1J).
Studies on subventricular zone NPCs isolated before
cortical migration respond to NMDA and express subunits
of NMDARs (Behar et al., 1999). To assess human NPCs for
the presence of functional NMDARs, we recorded from five
independent NPCs (Figures 2A–2C), where two cells
showed action potentials and one responded to NMDA,
despite universal expression of NPC markers in these cul-
tures (Figure 2D). The GRIN1 and GRIN2B protein was
easily identifiable in NPCs via western blot, although
expression in NPCs was lower than in these same cells
matured for 30 days, as expected (Figure 1E). RNA
sequencing of control NPCs (n = 3 cell lines) revealed
expression of almost all NMDAR subunits as well as sub-
units from AMPA, kainate, and metabotropic glutamate re-
ceptors (Figure S4). To unambiguously show NMDA
response in NPC cultures, we have provided videos (Videos
S1 and S2) and images (Figures 2F and 2G) of calcium influx
after application of NMDA in NPCs and D5 neurons, where
D5 neurons show an increased response, likely reflecting a
more mature stage of development. It is not immediately
obvious whether some cells that are presumed to be in an
NPC state are in fact differentiated. A further unknown is
whether this is a function of in vitro techniques or may
reflect NPC populations within the human brain.
Engineered Reduced Dosage and LOF Mutations in
GRIN2B Impair Differentiation of NPCs
Using our simultaneous reprogramming and gene-editing
protocol (Bell et al., 2017), we generated clonal RD and
LOF GRIN2B models. RD cells are heterozygous for a frame-
shift mutation in exon 11 and have one functional copy of
GRIN2B, whereas LOF cells have two different GRIN2B
mutant alleles, both with in-frame deletions of a large
segment of the glutamate binding pocket (Figures 3A and
3B). RD has a �50% decrease in GRIN2B mRNA expression,
whereas LOF has a milder decrease in mRNA expression
of �25% (Figure 3C). Using independent replicates (control
n = 4, LOF n = 4, RD n = 2), we differentiated NPCs for
30 days and performed whole transcriptomic sequencing
in RNA extracted from these neurons, and found excellent
segregation of expression patterns (Figure 3D). Both
models of GRIN2B deficiency had several genome-wide sig-
nificant gene-expression differences compared with the
isogenic control cells, although we focused on those genes
that showed expression differences in both GRIN2B
mutant models, which revealed 657 differentially ex-
pressed genes common to both models (hypergeometric
p < 1.8 3 10�204) (Figure 3F). The strongest gene ontology
terms for these common 657 genes were associated with
genes related to increased cell proliferation and decreased
cell differentiation (Figure 3G).
Activation of NMDARs drives immediate-early gene
expression (Bading et al., 1993). Both FOS (Xia et al.,
1996) and EGR1 (Vaccarino et al., 1992) are immediate-
early genes that are downregulated in GRIN2B mutation

 (Figures 3G–3J), showed that while GRIN2B was consistently
reduced in RD and LOF neurons compared with controls,
KI67 and MET were consistently increased. This suggested
that LOF and RD neurons were more immature than control
neurons differentiated for the same amount of time.
A Missense Mutation in GRIN2B Impairs NPC
Differentiation and Is Rescued by Genetic Repair
We next generated neurons from a well-studied (Adams
et al., 2014) patient with autism and moderate intellectual
disability.
The subject has a heterozygous
mutation
(E413G) in the glutamate binding pocket of GRIN2B (Fig-
ures 4A and 4B), which is reported to decreases glutamate
signaling >50-fold (Adams et al., 2014). Assessing the neu-
rons in steps identical to those for the gene-edited GRIN2B
models, we were able to fully recapitulate the deficient
maturational state observed in RD and LOF neurons in pa-
tient neurons (Figures 4D–4G).
A pathway whereby CREB becomes phosphorylated at
serine 133 after NMDA stimulation and cell maturation
has been identified (Sala et al., 2000). To confirm deficiency
in this pathway in patients and genetically engineered
models of GRIN2B deficiency, we performed western blots
to determine the protein levels of P133-CREB and CFOS,
output markers of NMDA activation albeit non-specific
(Xia et al., 1996). The data strongly support the hypothesis
that mutant GRIN2B impairs NMDA signaling (Figure 4H).
Patient cells can show altered levels of GRIN2B and other
output measures due to genetic background. To address
this, we corrected the patient mutation back to the wild-
type sequence in two clonal lines (Figures 4I and 4J; Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures). Using clonal cell lines
from the patient who failed to repair as control (n = 2),
we differentiated all NPC lines for 30 days as assessed
output makers GRIN2B, KI67, and MET via qPCR. We
observed significantly higher expression of GRIN2B in re-
paired cells and lower levels of KI67 and MET in failed
repair patient cells (Figure 4K).
Pharmacological Block of NMDARs Impairs NPC
Differentiation
Loss
of
GRIN2B,
and

deficient
NMDA
signaling, increases MET and KI67 while decreasing
GRIN2B expression. To determine whether pharmacolog-
ical blockade of NMDARs or GRIN2B phenocopied these
effects, we applied two concentrations of 2-amino-5-phos-
phonovalerate (APV), a competitive antagonist of NMDA,
as well as ifenprodil, an uncompetitive inhibitor of
NMDARs that contain GRIN2B (Williams, 1993) for
30 days in culture (Figure 5A). We performed protein assess-
ments of GRIN2B, KI67, and METand found that both APV
and ifenprodil produced a decrease in GRIN2B expression,
but a significant increase in both KI67 and MET expression
(Figures 5B–5D).
Mutations in GRIN2B Show Impaired Responses to
NMDA
To assess whether there is a functional consequence to both
genetically engineered and the patient missense mutation
in GRIN2B, we differentiated NPCs for 21 days and per-
formed live calcium imaging and electrophysiological re-
cordings. All three GRIN2B-deficient cell lines showed a
reduced response to NMDA application compared with a
control cell line (Figures 6A and 6B; Videos S3–S6). Electro-
physiological recordings also presented decreased fre-
quency and amplitude of responses after application of
NMDA compared with control cells (Figures 6C and 6D).
DISCUSSION
This work provides a description of iPSC-derived models of
GRIN2B mutations. All models point to a significant role of
GRIN2B and NMDARs in cell differentiation, consistent
with previous reports showing that stimulation of NMDA
receptors affects neuron development (Aamodt and Con-
stantine-Paton, 1999; Blanton et al., 1990; Tovar and West-
brook, 1999). We propose a model whereby GRIN2B-NMDA
receptors are critical for signal transduction in neural stem
cells. Deficits in this process delay or impair differentiation,
including GRIN2B expression itself, further impairing differ-
entiation. This suggests a feedforward loop whereby NMDA
signaling leads to more expression of GRIN2B, and thus
more NMDA signaling. We hypothesize that this feedfor-
ward loop is not specific to GRIN2B, but rather the general
differentiation
state of
the
cell.
Glutamate
signaling
through NMDA in neural stem cells or immediately postmi-
totic neurons may be critical for cells to interpret their envi-
ronment and differentiate accordingly. In our study we
could detect NMDA response in some NPCs as well as action
potential generation. There are two possible explanations
for this. (1) Cells that stain positive for PAX6, NESTIN,

 and SOX2 are not truly NPCs but rather cells that have
differentiated. On close inspection (Figure 2, NPC #4)
some NPCs show bipolar morphology, which has implica-
tions for these markers in these types of studies. It also has
implications for the probabilistic nature of proliferation
and differentiation itself, specifically that NPCs may
constantly want to differentiate but are held in a prolifera-
tive state by the presence of growth factors, with a small
minority of cells differentiating regardless under these con-
ditions in vitro. (2) Alternatively, NPCs have functional
NMDARs that contain GRIN2B, in which case the definition
of NMDAR function needs to be expanded beyond its role in
the synapse and synapse assembly, as has been suggested in
mouse (Behar et al., 1999). We favor the latter explanation
without discounting the former, but neither may be mutu-
ally exclusive.
These data are consistent with a model of neurodevelop-
mental disease whereby any genetic alteration that alters
the precise timing of neuronal differentiation may lead to
altered numbers of progenitor cell populations and/or inte-
gration of cells into developing circuits (Ernst, 2016). In
the current work, loss of GRIN2B function may retain cells
in a more proliferative-like state, impairing differentiation
and,presumably,howneuronsintegrateintodevelopingcir-
cuits. In our view, this is the link between the divergent and
extensive list of genes that when mutated lead to variable
phenotypes related to intellectual disability. For example,
mutations in PTEN, CHD8, or CDKL5 all lead to neurodeve-
lopmental disease, and all have a role in cell proliferation.
There have been intensive studies of the role of genes ex-
pressed at synapses in neurodevelopmental diseases (Bour-
geron, 2015), and we suggest that GRIN2B action in neural
stem cells may also play a role in these diseases. This leads
to a larger question: might other genes with strong associ-
ations with neurodevelopment and usually considered in a
synaptic context (e.g., NRXN1 [Kim et al., 2008] or SHANK3
[Monteiro and Feng, 2017]) also have a role in early cell dif-
ferentiation? Our study suggests that perhaps other genes
considered to have a primarily synaptic function might
play a key role in developing neurons.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Somatic Cell Reprogramming
The induction of iPSCs and their subsequent differentiation into
neuronal cells was carried out using methods identical to those
described previously (Bell et al., 2017). All cell lines were generated
from fibroblasts. Control fibroblasts were obtained from the Coriell
Cell Repository (Camden, USA), and patient fibroblasts were ob-
tained from the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chi-
cago (Chicago, USA) in adherence with ethical research principles
and under protocols approved by the local institutional review
board. Further information regarding the cell lines used in this
experiment can be found in Table S1.
Fibroblasts were reprogrammed using episomal reprogramming
vectors
containing
Oct4,
Sox2,
Myc3/4,
Klf4,
and
ShRNA
P53 (ALSTEM) and a Neon Transfection System (Invitrogen, Bur-
lington). A total of 5.0 3 105 cells were electroporated and
reprogrammed with 5 mg of episomal vectors per reaction.

 Electroporation parameters were as follows: 11,650 V, 10 ms, 3
pulses. Following transfection, cells were plated at extremely
low density (�10 cells per well) on tissue culture plates coated
with Matrigel (Corning) in 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
DMEM. The following day, the medium was exchanged for fresh
10% FBS DMEM supplemented with 2 mg/mL puromycin, where
applicable (Sigma-Aldrich). Puromycin selection was applied for
48 hr, after which the medium was exchanged with fresh TesR-E7
medium (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver). During the in-
duction process, TesR-E7, medium was changed every day. Single
iPSC colonies were observed, and could be seen forming from a
single skin cell. Once colonies formed a distinct border (�500–
1,000 mm in diameter), cells were detached using ReLeSR medium
(STEMCELL), and replated in mTesR1 medium (STEMCELL) sup-
plemented with ROCK inhibitor y-27632 (Sigma-Aldrich) at a
final concentration of 10 mM.

 Quality Control of iPSCs
iPSCs were rigorously characterized using several assays. All cells
underwent short tandem repeat profiling using ten markers to
ensure that derived cells could always be related back to their
source cell. All cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination
(EZ-PCR Mycoplasma Test Kit [Biological Industries]). Pluripotency
was assessed by immunostaining with surface and nuclear plurip-
otency markers (Figure S1), and spontaneous 7-day embryoid body
(EB) differentiation confirmed the capacity to form the three germ
layers. Once iPSC lines were stable, we performed array compara-
tive hybridization (aCGH; Cytoscan HD at SickKids Toronto;
Thermo Fisher Scientific). No de novo CNVs >1 Mb were observed
in any colonies, and no de novo rare CNVs (<1% in Caucasian pop-
ulation) were observed in genes.

 Genetic Engineering
CRISPR gene editing was performed concurrently with iPSC induc-
tion, using previously published protocols (Bell et al., 2017). More
information regarding CRIPSR design, including the regions
of GRIN2B targeted, guide RNA sequences, and sequencing
chromatograms can be found in Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
iPSC Differentiation to Forebrain Progenitor Cells
iPSCs were dissociated using Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent
(STEMCELL) and resuspended in Neural Induction medium
(DMEM/F12 supplemented with N2 [Invitrogen], B27 supplement
[Invitrogen], BSA [1 mg/mL], Y27632 [10 mM; AdooQ Bioscience],
SB431542 [10 mM; Selleckchem], and noggin [200 ng/mL;
GenScript]), onto low-bind plates (Corning) or Petri dishes (Corn-
ing). Cells were plated at a density of 2–3 3 106 cells per 100-mm2
plate. Cells were cultured in suspension and monitored for the for-
mation of organoids, which occurred approximately 4 days after
suspension. Three days after the formation of EBs, a 70-mm Falcon
cell strainer was used to collect aggregations, which were then re-
suspended in a fresh low-bind/Petri dish in Neural Progenitor
(NP) medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with N2, B27 supple-
ment, bFGF [20 ng/mL; GenScript], EGF [20 ng/mL; GenScript],
laminin [1 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich]). The medium was exchanged
every day for fresh NP medium for 14 days. Following 14 days in
NP medium, cell aggregations were resuspended in Final Differen-
tiation (FD) medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with N2, B27 sup-
plement, brain-derived neurotrophic factor [20 ng/mL; GenScript],
glia-derived neurotrophic factor [20 ng/mL; GenScript], laminin
[1 mg/mL]). FD medium was changed every 2 days for 7 days. Orga-
noids were plated on polyornithine- and laminin-coated tissue
culture plates in Neuron Maturation (NM) medium (DMEM/F12
supplemented with N2, B27 supplement). Following attachment,
organoids were dissociated with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and replated
onto fresh polyornithine- and laminin-coated plates in NM me-
dium. Half the medium was exchanged for fresh medium every
3 days.
Videomicroscopy
Cells were seeded in 35-mm MatTek Dishes (MatTek) in the
StemDiff Neural Progenitor Medium and differentiated for up to
21 days At the day of the acquisition, the Fluo4 calcium indicator
(Thermo Fisher) was incubated for 30 min at a final concentration
of 1 mM. Cells were then washed twice for 5 min with the differen-
tiation medium before acquisition. Acquisition were performed
using an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Zeiss) assisted by Zen 2 soft-
ware. Pictures were collected at every 400 ms for 5 min, with a
correction for defined focus every 30 pictures. At picture 120 a
vehicle solution was applied, corresponding to cell-culture me-
dium in the case of subsequent NMDA. At picture 240, NMDA
was applied at a final concentration of 2 mM. The acquisitions
were treated using Fiji/ImageJ software. Threshold was set up to
perform a segmentation of the cells, and ROIs were determined
and collected through the particle analysis module. Multiple mea-
surement tool from the ROI manager was used to the measure the
mean pixel values of each ROI in each picture of the time stack. For
the acquisition performed at the NPC stage, a manual segmenta-
tion was required to analyze Fluo4 fluorescence variations upon
NMDA application. The rest of the data collection process re-
mained the same. Once the data were extracted from the time
stack, background was subtracted from every single ROI at every
time point. Signal variation is expressed as DF/F0, F0 being the min-
imal intensity signal for a given ROI after background subtraction
and DF being the difference between an intensity signal at a given
time point and F0. Amplitude of DF/F0 variations following NMDA
applications were monitored in the ROIs and averaged to compare
responses between the different conditions. The time stacks were
submitted to a JPEG compression at 20 fps to obtain videos.
Electrophysiology
For whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, individual coverslips con-
taining differentiated human iPSC-derived neurons were trans-
ferred into a heated recording chamber and continuously perfused
(1 mL/min) with BrainPhys Neuronal Medium (STEMCELL)
bubbled with a mixture of CO2 (5%) and O2 (95%) and maintained
at 35�C. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained using
borosilicate pipettes (3–6 MU) filled with intracellular solution
that contained the following: 5 in mM HEPES, 2 in mM KCl, 136
in mM potassium gluconate, 5 in mM EGTA, 5 in mM Mg-ATP, 8
in mM creatine phosphate, and 0.35 in mM guanosine triphos-
phate. The pH was adjusted to 7.27 with KOH, and the osmolarity
adjusted with distilled water or concentrated potassium gluconate
if needed to between 295 and 298 mOsm with an osmometer
(Advanced Instruments). After a recording was completed, we
corrected the nominal membrane potential in voltage- and cur-
rent-clamp recordings for the calculated 10-mV liquid junction
potential. All potential values reported reflect this correction.
Once whole-cell recording had been established, neurons were
routinely held in voltage clamp at �70 mV except when exam-
ining changes in the resting membrane potential and rheobase,
which was performed in current clamp. Cells were only studied if
they exhibited a stable holding current and access resistance for
at least 10 min before experimental manipulations. Data were ac-
quired using a Digidata 1550A/Multiclamp 700B (Axon Instru-
ments) and Clampex 10.5 (Molecular Devices). Currents were
filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 20 kHz.
qPCR
Reverse transcriptions were done on the total RNA fraction in order
to obtain cDNA in 40-mL volume containing 1 mg of total RNA,
0.5 mg of random primers, 0.5 mM dNTPs, 0.01 M DTT, and
400 U M-MLV RT (Invitrogen). The reactions were performed in
a total volume of 20 mL on a 384-well plate using either an Applied
Biosystems 7900 HT (Applied Biosystems) or a QuantStudio 6
(Thermo Fisher) PCR machine. For each well, PCR mix included
10 mL of 23 No AmpErase UNG master mix (Applied Biosystems)
for Taqman assays or 10 mL of Power SybrGreen PCR Mastermix
(Life Technologies), 1 mL of primers/probe mix, 2 mL of cDNA,
with H2O up to 20 mL. Serial dilutions of a mix of cDNA ranging be-
tween 0.003052 ng and 50 ng were used to generate a calibration
curve for an absolute quantification. Expression levels were given
as a ratio between the relative quantities of the gene of interest
and the endogenous control. GAPDH was used as internal control
for normalization. The normalized expression levels were then

 compared between cell lines using ANOVA with a post hoc t test.
Further details on the primers used for qPCR can be found in Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures.
Immunocytochemistry and Microscopy
Cells were plated on glass coverslips coated with Matrigel. Once
cells were ready for ICC they were washed with PBS and fixed
with 3% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min. Samples
were permeabilized with 0.5% TX-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.5%
PBS-BSA for 15 min and then blocked in 0.5% PBS-BSA for an addi-
tional 15 min. Primary antibodies were added in appropriate dilu-
tions in 0.5% PBS-BSA and added to samples for 30 min. Samples
were washed, then 0.5% PBS-BSA containing an appropriate dilu-
tion of secondary antibody was added to the samples and incu-
bated for 30 min in the dark. Samples were washed with 0.5%
PBS-BSA and visualized on an FV1200 laser scanning microscope
(Olympus). Further details on the antibodies used for ICC can be
found in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Data Acquisition from Images
All ICC images were analyzed using the software ImageJ. Images
were converted to an 8-bit mode allowing pixel values in a range
between 0 and 256. A threshold was set for each channel to
discriminate specific signal intensities from the background. The
threshold was determined on the condition presenting the highest
signal-to-noise ratio. The average pixel intensities above threshold
were normalized by the number of DAPI-positive pixels to mini-
mize biases generated by differences in cell number in between
acquisition fields. Data between groups were compared using
t tests that followed ANOVA when required. Statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS 20.
Western Blotting
Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (Sigma) supplemented with
SIGMAFAST Protease Inhibitor Tablets (Millipore-Sigma). Protein
concentrations were determined using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay
Kit (Thermo Fisher). Approximately 15 mg of protein was loaded
per well in Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free Precast Gels (Bio-Rad).
Gels were run at 150 V for approximately 75 min and then trans-
ferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a Trans-Blot Turbo Trans-
fer System (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 4% non-fat milk
dissolved in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 (TBST) buffer (Sigma-
Aldrich) for 20 min, then incubated with primary antibodies over-
night at 4�C with shaking. Blots were washed three times in TBST
for 5 min and then incubated with appropriate mouse or rabbit sec-
ondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. Blots were washed
a further three times in TBST for 5 min, then imaged using a
ChemiDoc XRS+ System (Bio-Rad). Blots were imaged and analyzed
using ImageLab software, and statistical analysis was performed us-
ing Student’s t tests when two sample conditions were present and
one-way ANOVA when more than two sample conditions were pre-
sent. Further details on the antibodies used can be found in Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures.

entiated in medium supplemented with 10 mM and 50 mM of APV
(Tocis) or 3 mM of ifenprodil (Tocris) for 30 days. All other cell-culture
parameters were identical to thedifferentiation protocol citedabove.
Every 3 days, half of the medium was exchanged. After 30 days the
coverslips were removed and prepared for ICC as described above.
