 SUMMARY
Hallmarks of aging that negatively impact health include weight gain and reduced physical fitness, 
which can increase insulin resistance and risk for many diseases including type 2 diabetes. The 
underlying mechanism(s) for these phenomena is poorly understood. Here we report that aging 
increases DNA breaks and activates DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) in skeletal muscle, 
which suppresses mitochondrial function, energy metabolism and physical fitness. DNA-PK 
phosphorylates threonines 5 and 7 of HSP90α, decreasing its chaperone function for clients such 
as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is critical for mitochondrial biogenesis and 
energy metabolism. Decreasing DNA-PK activity increases AMPK activity and prevents weight 
gain, decline of mitochondrial function and physical fitness in middle aged mice and protects 
against type 2 diabetes. Therefore, DNA-PK is one of the drivers of the metabolic and fitness 
decline during aging, which make staying lean and physically fit difficult and increase 
susceptibility to metabolic diseases.

INTRODUCTION
One of the aging-associated metabolic changes is the loss of mitochondrial content and 
function in tissues such as skeletal muscle (Barazzoni et al., 2000; Petersen et al., 2003; 
Short et al., 2005). Since mitochondria convert nutrients to energy and heat, the 
mitochondrial decline is relevant to aging-associated decline in metabolic rate and exercise 
capacity. Lee et. al. (Lee et al., 2010) reported that the rise of mitochondrial reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) with aging causes a decline in mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle. This

 can lead to metabolic dysfunctions such as insulin resistance, which can lead to chronic 
diseases such as type 2 diabetes.
Accumulating evidence indicates that the aging-associated decline in skeletal muscle activity 
of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key regulator of mitochondrial function and 
energy balance (Hardie, 2007), plays an important role in the metabolic decline associated 
with aging (Koonen et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2010; Qiang et al., 2007; Reznick et al., 2007). 
AMPK has numerous functions including stimulation of glucose uptake, fat oxidation, 
energy production and mitochondrial biogenesis (Ruderman et al., 2013). Increased AMPK 
activity decreases visceral fat (Narkar et al., 2008) and increases mitochondrial biogenesis 
and energy production in skeletal muscle resulting in improved physical fitness (Zong et al., 
2002). On the other hand, AMPK-deficiency in skeletal muscle leads to mitochondrial loss, 
impaired glucose uptake and exercise intolerance (O’Neill et al., 2011). Metformin, the most 
commonly used type 2 diabetes drug acts in part by AMPK activation (Zhou et al., 2001). 
However, the molecular mechanism by which aging decreases AMPK activity in skeletal 
muscle is poorly understood.
DNA-PK (Jackson, 1997) is activated by DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs). It is a 
trimeric complex composed of the catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs, and the Ku70/80 
heterodimer. DNA-PK mediates non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), which joins 
programmed DSBs created during V(D)J recombination and class switching recombination 
in lymphocytes (Critchlow and Jackson, 1998). As a result, severe combined immune 
deficiency (SCID) mice (Blunt et al., 1996), which carry a leaky mutation in DNA-PKcs, 
have impaired lymphocyte development. As a DNA DSB sensor, DNA-PK has some unusual 
properties. For example, DNA-PK is very abundant: it is estimated that HeLa cells contain 
approximately 100,000 copies of DNA-PKcs per cell (Anderson and Carter, 1996), far in 
excess of what is probably needed for NHEJ. In addition, DNA-PKcs is present not only in 
the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm (Huston et al., 2008). In agreement with this, evidence 
is mounting that DNA-PK has functions beyond genetic stability. One such function is in 
metabolism: DNA-PK phosphorylates transcription factor USF-1 and promotes fatty acid 
synthesis in response to insulin (Wong et al., 2009).
One of the proteins DNA-PK interacts with and phosphorylates is HSP90α (Lees-Miller and 
Anderson, 1989), one of the two isoforms of HSP90 (α and β). HSP90 is unique among 
chaperone proteins in that it binds to and folds only a small fraction of the total proteome 
called “clients,” the majority of which are protein kinases (Li and Buchner, 2013). DNA-PK 
phosphorylates Thr5,7 (T5,7) in the extreme N-terminus (ENT) region of HSP90α (aa. 1–
11, Figure S1) (Lees-Miller and Anderson, 1989; Quanz et al., 2012; Solier et al., 2012), but 
DNA-PK does not phosphorylate HSP90β (Lees-Miller and Anderson, 1989). The effect of 
T5,7 phosphorylation on HSP90α function is not known.
Here, we show that T5,7 phosphorylation of HSP90α, which increases with aging in skeletal 
muscle, disrupts the HSP90α-client complex. AMPK (Taipale et al., 2012) and its upstream 
activator kinase LKB1 are known HSP90 clients. Preventing T5,7 phosphorylation, either by 
mutating T5,7 or by genetic loss of DNA-PKcs increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle.

 against loss of mitochondria and physical fitness at older age in mice. Therefore, DNA-PK 
promotes metabolic and physical decline in older age.
RESULTS
Aging increases DNA DSBs and DNA-PK activity
A naturally occurring condition that may increase DNA DSBs and potentially activate DNA-
PK is aging. In order to determine if aging is associated with increased DNA DSBs in 
skeletal muscle, we isolated skeletal muscle from young (3 mo) and old (25 mo) mice and 
visualized γ-H2AX (Rogakou et al., 1998), a phosphorylated form of histone H2AX that is a 
marker for DNA DSBs (Figure 1A). We found that skeletal muscle from old mice has more 
γ-H2AX, suggesting that aging increases DNA DSBs in skeletal muscle.
We then examined the association of aging and DNA-PK activity in two different organisms: 
rhesus macaques and mice. We isolated skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) from healthy rhesus 
macaques ranging in age from 1 to 15 yr, which is equivalent to 3 to 45 yr in human age. 
The tissue was isolated from fasted animals to exclude food intake as a variable. We detected 
DNA-PK activity by visualizing autophosphorylation of S2056 (p-DNA-PK) in DNA-PKcs 
(Chen et al., 2005). In all cases, the level phosphorylation was normalized to the total protein 
level. The levels of p-DNA-PK were similar at 1, 3 and 10 yr (image not shown), but rose 
significantly at 15 yr (Figure 1B). The antibody specific for p-DNA-PK, which was raised 
against human DNA-PKcs, was too weakly cross reacting for detection of mouse p-DNA-
PK (data not shown).
Consistent with the dramatic increase in p-DNA-PK at middle aged, T5,7-HSP90α (p-
HSP90α) was significantly higher in middle aged macacque skeletal muscle (Figure 1C). 
Similarly, p-HSP90α was significantly higher in skeletal muscle from old mice compared to 
that in young mice (Figure 1D). These findings indicate that both DNA-PK activity and p-
HSP90α are elevated in skeletal muscle of older rhesus monkeys and mice. Interestingly, p-
HSP90α did not increase with aging in the lung, indicating that aging does not increase p-
HSP90α in all tissues (Figure S2).
DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of HSP90α triggers release of clients
Although HSP90 is more abundant in the cytoplasm, there is some HSP90 in the nucleus 
(van Bergen en Henegouwen et al., 1987). In order to determine the cellular compartment to 
which phosphorylated p-HSP90α is localized, we purified the cytoplasmic and nuclear 
fractions before and after ionizing radiation (IR), which generates DNA DSBs and activates 
DNA-PK (Figure 2A). We found a detectable basal level of p-HSP90α in the cytoplasm and 
nucleus, but after IR, p-HSP90α increased dramatically in both compartments. Moreover, IR 
increased nuclear accumulation of HSP90α but not HSP90β.
Based on a previous report showing that the ENT region may regulate HSP90 chaperone 
function by affecting the HSP90-client complex formation (Pullen and Bolon, 2011), we 
examined whether T5,7 phosphorylation affects HSP90α-client interaction. To test this, we 
transiently-transfected C2C12 myotubes with vectors encoding Flag-tagged WT, T5,7A 
(T→A) mutant and phosphomimetic T5,7D (T→D) mutant HSP90α, treated them with IR

 and examined the interaction of the HSP90α mutants with the clients liver kinase B1 
(LKB1) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that IR 
released LKB1 from WT HSP90α, but not from T5,7A HSP90α (Figure 2B). T5,7D 
HSP90α bound poorly to LKB1 even in the absence of IR. Similarly, IR released GR from 
WT HSP90α, but not from T5,7A HSP90α (Figure 2C); T5,7D HSP90α also bound poorly 
to GR even in the absence of IR. Unlike the HSP90α-GR interaction, the HSP90β-GR 
interaction was not affected by IR (Figure 2D). To demonstrate that the IR-induced release 
of GR from HSP90α was mediated by DNA-PK-dependent phosphorylation, we performed 
co-immunoprecipitation between GR and HSP90α after knocking-down DNA-PKcs with 
siRNA. As shown in Figure 2E, DNA-PKcs siRNA significantly reduced p-HSP90α and 
prevented IR from disrupting the GR-HSP90α interaction (Figure 2F). The T5,7A mutations 
also blunted IR-induced release of other HSP90 clients such as endothelial nitric oxide 
synthase (eNOS) (Figure 2G) and the androgen receptor (AR) (Figure 2H) from HSP90α. 
Taken together, these findings indicate that DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of HSP90α 
can disrupt HSP90α-client complexes.
Inhibition of DNA-PK activates AMP-activated protein kinase
Since AMPK (Taipale et al., 2012) and its upstream activator kinase LKB1 (Nony et al., 
2003) are HSP90 clients, we investigated whether DNA-PK and phosphorylation of HSP90α 
mediate the aging-related decline in AMPK activity. Although AMPKα2 (the dominant 
AMPK in skeletal muscle) is an HSP90 client, its interaction with HSP90 is weak to begin 
with (background intensity) (Taipale et al., 2012), making it difficult to see further decrease 
in interaction after IR. However, to confirm that AMPK is a client of HSP90α, we knocked-
down HSP90α with siRNA and visualized the level of AMPK in C2C12 myotubes. 
Decreased chaperone function of HSP90 often results in decreased levels of client proteins 
due to aggregation and/or destabilization. Consistent with the notion that AMPK is a client 
of HSP90α, HSP90α siRNA decreased AMPK levels (Figure 3A top and bottom left panels) 
without affecting its mRNA levels (Figure 3A bottom right panel), and treatment with the 
HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG also decreased AMPK levels (Figure 3B). We also investigated 
whether the T5,7 phosphorylation affects the AMPK-HSP90α interaction by transiently 
expressing WT and T5,7A HSP90α. As shown in Figure 3C, AMPK interaction with T5,7A 
HSP90α was stronger than with WT HSP90α and consistent with this, p-AMPK (T172), a 
marker of AMPK activity, was higher with T5,7A HSP90α compared with WT HSP90α 
(Figure 3D). These findings suggest that phosphorylation of T5,7 decreases HSP90α-AMPK 
complex formation and AMPK activity.
We then investigated whether DNA-PK affects AMPK activity in vivo. For this purpose, we 
used severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, which carry a leaky mutation in 
DNA-PKcs (Blunt et al., 1996) but have a normal lifespan (Bailey et al., 1999). We 
visualized p-AMPK in skeletal muscle of young (3–4 mo) and middle aged (12–14 mo) WT 
and SCID mice (Figures 3E and F). In young SCID mice, p-AMPK was similar to that in 
WT mice but in middle aged SCID mice, p-AMPK was higher than that in WT mice. In line 
with this observation, p-HSP90α was also decreased in middle aged SCID muscle relative to 
WT muscle (Figures 3G and H). To confirm that the DNA-PK-AMPK link was cell 
autonomous in vivo, we generated a conditional knockout of DNA-PKcs in skeletal muscle

 (MDPKO) by breeding DNA-PKcsfl/fl mice (Mishra et al., 2015) with mice expressing the 
Cre recombinase driven by muscle creatine kinase (MCK) (Figure 3I). As expected, in 
skeletal muscle, p-HSP90α was lower and p-AMPK and phosphorylation of AMPK 
substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase (p-ACC) were higher in 17 mo old MDPKO mice 
compared to DNA-PKcsfl/fl (fl/fl) mice; there was less difference in 5 mo old mice. Taken 
together, these findings support the notion that the aging-related increase in DNA-PK-
mediated phosphorylation of HSP90α leads to the decline of AMPK activity with age.
Since DNA-PK is involved in NHEJ, we asked whether DNA-PK-deficiency or treatment 
with DNA-PK inhibitor NU7441 may affect the DNA DSB burden in skeletal muscle. As 
shown in Figure S3, γ-H2AX in skeletal muscle of SCID and MDPKO mice were similar or 
slightly decreased (in old SCID) compared to WT mice; treatment with NU7441 also did not 
affect γ-H2AX levels.
DNA-PK inhibition increases skeletal muscle mitochondrial content
These findings led us to consider the possibility that DNA-PK may promote aging-
associated mitochondrial decline in skeletal muscle. We quantified mitochondrial content in 
skeletal muscle of 14–16 year old rhesus monkeys and its correlation with DNA-PKcs 
activity. We found a strong inverse correlation between mitochondrial content and p-DNA-
PK in middle aged skeletal muscle (r=−0.93, p=0.008) (Figure 4A). One possible 
interpretation of this finding is that DNA-PK suppresses mitochondrial biogenesis in middle 
aged skeletal muscle.
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) (Puigserver et 
al., 1998) is the master regulator of mitochondrial function. We measured mRNA levels of 
PGC-1α as well as related PGC-1β and additional genes involved in mitochondrial function 
in skeletal muscle isolated from WT and SCID young mice (Y, 3–4 mo old), obese mice 
generated by feeding high-fat diet (HFD) for 4–5 months (Ob, 5–6 mo old) and middle aged 
mice (MA, 12–14 mo old) (Figure 4B). We found that mRNA levels of PGC-1α and PPARδ, 
were decreased in muscle from obese WT mice but not from SCID mice fed a HFD. Also, 
the expression of all the genes tested was decreased in middle aged WT muscle, but not in 
middle aged SCID muscle. Consistent with this, the protein levels of PGC-1α in skeletal 
muscle of 17 mo old MDPKO mice were elevated compared to the controls (Figure 4C).
We then calculated the mitochondrial density in skeletal muscle of young and middle aged 
WT and SCID mice. Morphometric analyses of electron micrographs indicated that middle 
aged WT muscle had 36% less mitochondrial density than young WT muscle (Figure 4D). 
However, middle aged SCID muscle had same mitochondrial density as young SCID and 
WT muscle. In agreement with this, the mtDNA copy number in middle aged muscle was 
higher in SCID mice (Figure 4E) and tended to be higher in MDPKO mice (Figure 4F) 
compared to their respective controls.
These findings imply that inhibition of DNA-PK activity with a small molecule will induce 
mitochondrial biogenesis. We treated WT mice with highly-specific DNA-PK inhibitor 
NU7441 for 3 mo by incorporating it in the HFD pellet, starting from age 1 mo. After 
treatment, we measured serum IgG levels to determine if the inhibitor caused any immune

 dysfunction. Unlike SCID mice, which do not produce any antibody because of the 
lymphocyte defect, WT mice treated with NU7441 had normal levels of serum antibodies 
(Figure 4G), indicating that in adult mice, the DNA-PK inhibitor did not significantly affect 
B-cell function. To determine the role of AMPK in mitochondrial biogenesis, we also treated 
AMPKα2 KO mice (Viollet et al., 2003) on HFD with the inhibitor. As shown in Figure 4H, 
NU7441 increased mitochondrial content by approximately 50% in WT mice but did not 
increase it in AMPKα2 KO mice. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the 
notion that inhibiting DNA-PK increases mitochondrial biogenesis in an AMPK-dependent 
manner.
DNA-PK inhibition increases physical fitness in obese and middle aged animals
Skeletal muscle is composed of oxidative and glycolytic fiber types. Type 1 and type 2A 
fibers are high in mitochondrial content and are oxidative whereas type 2X and type 2B 
fibers are lower in mitochondrial content and are glycolytic. Previous studies have shown 
that increased expression of PGC-1α causes fiber switch from glycolytic toward more 
oxidative fibers (Lin et al., 2002). We analyzed the fiber type composition of gastrocnemius 
muscle, which is largely glycolytic, from middle aged SCID and WT mice and WT mice 
treated with the DNA-PK inhibitor for 10–12 weeks. As shown in Figure 5A, SCID muscle 
had more Type 1 fiber and less Type 2B fiber than WT muscle as did the muscle from the 
inhibitor treated mice (Figure 5B). Consistent with increased mitochondrial content and 
oxidative fiber in middle aged SCID muscle, they had higher mitochondrial oxygen 
consumption rate (VO2) in permeabilized muscle (Figure S4A).
Treatments that activate AMPK and/or reprogram glycolytic fibers, which are prone to 
fatigue, to oxidative fibers are known to increase fat oxidation and fatigue-resistance (Narkar 
et al., 2008; Suwa et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2004). Mice with increased mitochondrial 
content in skeletal muscle generally have lower serum lactate, the by-product of glycolysis 
and a major source of muscle fatigue (Hanson and Hakimi, 2008; Mason et al., 2004). Since 
SCID muscle has more oxidative fibers, we suspected that SCID mice might have lower 
serum lactate levels. Indeed, serum lactate levels of middle aged SCID mice were 17% lower 
than those of WT mice (Figure 5C) in the resting state.
These findings suggest that DNA-PK may promote aging-associated decline in physical 
fitness. To test this, we measured the treadmill running capacity of young and middle aged 
WT and SCID mice. Young WT and SCID mice ran similar distances, but middle aged 
SCID mice ran nearly twice the distance of middle aged WT mice, showing no aging-
associated decline (Figure 5D). With some high-endurance mice, repeated exercise damages 
muscle and decreases endurance (Mason et al., 2004). This was a potential concern because 
increased mitochondrial content could lead to increased oxidative damage, including DNA 
damage. To test whether this is the case with SCID mice, we exercised obese and middle 
aged WT and SCID mice for three consecutive days (Figure S4B). By the third day of 
exercise, the superior endurance of SCID mice compared to WT mice became even more 
pronounced, indicating that SCID muscle is not prone to damage by repeated exercise.
Results shown above suggest that the DNA-PK inhibitor may be an effective fitness 
enhancer. Indeed, obese and middle aged WT mice treated with NU7441 ran approximately

 60% and 40% greater distance, respectively (Figure 5E). Consistent with our earlier finding 
that DNA-PK inhibition does not increase mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle of 
obese AMPKα2 mice (Figure 4H), the inhibitor increased the running distance by more than 
60% in obese WT mice but had no effect on the running distance in obese AMPKα2 KO 
mice (Figure 5F). Taken together, these findings indicate that DNA-PK inhibition can 
prevent aging-associated loss of mitochondria and its function and dramatically improve 
fitness in an AMPK-dependent manner.
To determine if the immune status of SCID plays any role in their physical performance, we 
exercised mice deficient in Rag1, a nuclease that is essential for VDJ recombination and 
lymphocyte development (Oettinger et al., 1990). Since Rag1 and DNA-PKcs participate 
sequentially in the same VDJ recombination pathway in lymphocytes, the immune status of 
Rag1 KO and SCID mice are very similar. Unlike SCID muscle, Rag1 KO muscle did not 
express higher PGC-1α or PPARδ expression (Figure S5A) and had normal physical 
endurance (Figure S5B).
Inhibition of DNA-PK protects against obesity and type-2 diabetes
To investigate the metabolic function of DNA-PKcs in vivo, we measured the body weight 
of young WT and SCID mice fed either regular chow diet (RCD) or HFD after weaning. 
After 20 wk on RCD, SCID mice weighed 1–2 gm less than WT mice, but the difference 
was statistically not significant (Figure S6A). On HFD, SCID mice were relatively resistant 
to weight gain (Figure S6B) compared to WT mice even though their food intake (Figure 
S6C) and fat absorption (Figure S6D) were similar to those of WT mice. NMR spectroscopy 
analysis indicated that on HFD, SCID mice have approximately 25% lower fat mass index 
than WT mice (Figure S6E). Consistent with this, fat in the abdominal region was noticeably 
decreased in SCID mice (Figure S6F and G). On the other hand, WT and SCID mice had 
similar lean mass index (Figure S6H).
Although the body weight difference between WT and SCID mice was insignificant at 
young age (see Figure S6A), it became much more pronounced at middle aged (14 mo) 
(Figure S6I). Consistent with this, middle aged SCID mice had lower plasma triglyceride 
levels than WT mice (Figure S6J). Middle aged SCID mice had similar fasting plasma 
glucose levels as WT mice (92 ± 8 mg/dl vs 94 ± 14 mg/dl) despite having significantly 
lower plasma insulin levels than WT mice (0.28 ± 0.01 ng/ml vs 0.64 ± 0.1 ng/ml, p<0.05). 
This suggested that middle aged SCID mice are less insulin resistant than WT mice. Indeed, 
the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) increased with age in WT mice as expected but did 
not change in SCID mice (Figure S6K). Taken together, these results indicate that DNA-PK 
promotes aging-associated increase in insulin resistance.
The results shown above suggested that a DNA-PK inhibitor might have an anti-diabetic 
effect in obese WT mice. Indeed, we found that including NU7441 in the pellet decreased 
weight gain on HFD (Figure 6A) and increased glucose tolerance (Figure 6B) and insulin 
sensitivity (Figure 6C). Activation of AMPK can increase the secretion of glucagon-like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1), a peptide hormone produced by the L-cells in the gut that helps to 
maintain normoglycemia (Baggio and Drucker, 2007). Consistent with the DNA-PK-AMPK 
link, the inhibitor increased the plasma level of GLP-1 (Figure 6D). To determine the site of

 improved insulin action in these mice, we performed hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps. 
The glucose infusion rate (GIR) required to maintain euglycemia was approximately 27% 
higher in inhibitor-treated mice (Figure 6E, Figure S7A, B) and the total glucose disposal 
rate (GDR) was increased by almost 20% (Figure 6F). The inhibitor increased insulin-
stimulated glucose uptake (GU) into skeletal muscle, the primary site of insulin-stimulated 
glucose disposal, by almost 40% (Figure 6G) and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into 
white adipose tissue (WAT) by more than 120% (Figure 6H). However, endogenous glucose 
production (EGP) by the liver was not improved by NU7441 (Figure 6I). Middle aged 
MDPKO mice also tended to have lower body weight, fasting glucose and insulin resistance 
compared to fl/fl mice although the differences were not statistically significant (Figure 
S7C). These findings indicate that inhibition of DNA-PK activity with a small molecule 
inhibitor protects against obesity and has an anti-diabetic effect.
Calorie restriction and aerobic fitness are associated with decreased DNA-PK activity
Calorie-restriction (CR), like DNA-PK inhibition, increases mitochondrial biogenesis 
(Lopez-Lluch et al., 2006) and protects against insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome 
(Omodei and Fontana, 2011). We examined how CR affected DNA-PK activity and 
phosphorylation of T5,7 in HSP90α in middle aged rhesus macaques. CR, 30% caloric 
reduction compared to ad libitum feeding for 3.4 yr, decreased both DNA-PKcs 
autophosphorylation and HSP90α phosphorylation in middle aged skeletal muscle (Figure 
7A).
A number of clinical studies during the past two decades have shown that low exercise 
capacity is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality (Kokkinos et al., 2008). As part of 
an effort to understand the link between exercise capacity and health, rats with low and high 
intrinsic treadmill running capacity have been produced by two-way selective breeding of 
genetically heterogeneous founder rats (Koch et al., 2012). The lines, termed the Low 
Capacity Runners (LCR) and the High Capacity Runners (HCR), differed by approximately 
7-fold in running capacity after 27 generations of selective breeding. The sedentary HCR 
rats have increased mitochondrial content and function, are protected from the metabolic 
syndrome, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and cancer and have longer lifespan compared to 
the sedentary LCR rats (Garton et al., 2016). Since the HCR rats have metabolic phenotypes 
that resemble CR and DNA-PK-deficiency, we hypothesized that breeding for the HCR rats 
may have led to the generation of rats with decreased DNA-PK activity. We measured total 
DNA-PKcs level and p-HSP90α in skeletal muscle of 7–9 mo sedentary the HCR and LCR 
rats. As shown in Figure 7B, DNA-PKcs level was three-fold lower and p-HSP90α was 
approximately 60% lower in the HCR rats compared to LCR rats. Taken together, these 
findings suggest that CR and aerobic fitness, which delay aging and protect against chronic 
diseases, are associated with decreased DNA-PK activity.
DISCUSSION
In western societies, approximately 30% of the population becomes obese by age 60–70 and 
40% becomes either prediabetic or diabetic by age 70–80 (Harris, 1993). Moreover, the 
capacity for physical exercise, which has protective effects against obesity as well as many

 diseases of aging, also declines with age. Obesity and aging are also dominant risk factors 
for many common diseases including type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, 
stroke, cancer and even Alzheimer’s disease. Since the percentage of people age 65 or more 
is rapidly increasing, understanding how aging negatively affects energy metabolism and 
exercise capacity is imperative.
Cells respond to conditions in which energy demand exceeds respiratory capacity by 
expanding mitochondrial content, but with increasing age, mitochondrial content and 
function declines. One clue to the mechanism for their decline was the discovery that aging 
impairs AMPK-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle (Lee et al., 2010; 
Reznick et al., 2007) although the reason for this was not known. Our findings indicate that 
aging increases DNA DSBs and DNA-PK-mediated phosphorylation of HSP90α, which 
results in decreased chaperone function for LKB1/AMPK (Figure 7C).
The long-held belief has been that aging-associated forms of deterioration, including the 
mitochondrial decline in skeletal muscle, are due to passive accumulation of damage to 
DNA, proteins and/or lipids with age. While these accumulated damages may contribute to 
aging-associated metabolic decline, our findings indicate that a genetic program activated by 
DNA-PK (Figure 7C) contributes to the metabolic and physical decline at older age. Aging 
is also associated with inflammation, which is a common denominator of most chronic 
diseases, including type 2 diabetes (Lumeng and Saltiel, 2011). Therefore, it is possible that 
the proinflammatory effects of DNA-PK (Mishra et al., 2015) may also contribute to the 
metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity and aging.
Although both DNA DSBs and DNA-PK activity increase with aging in skeletal muscle 
(Figure 2A), we cannot conclude that aging-associated increase in DNA-PK activity is solely 
mediated by chromosomal breaks as DNA-PK is also activated independently of 
chromosomal breaks by ROS (Li et al., 2014), which increase with aging (Lee et al., 2010). 
In light of our finding that DNA-PK activity decreases mitochondrial function in skeletal 
muscle of older mice, activation of DNA-PK by ROS is an intriguing possibility as 
mitochondria are the main source of ROS production in metabolic tissues and CR decreases 
ROS (Sohal and Weindruch, 1996).
The most prominent phenotype of SCID mice is lymphocyte deficiency. However, mice 
deficient in Rag1, which functions in the same pathway as DNA-PK in VDJ rearrangement 
in lymphocytes (Oettinger et al., 1990) had similar mitochondrial gene expressions and 
physical fitness (Figure S5). Consistent with this, Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2015) reported that 
Rag1−/− mice are not leaner than WT mice on high-fat diet. Taken together, these findings 
indicate that the lymphocyte deficiency does not play a significant role in the metabolic 
phenotype of SCID mice. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that some of the changes seen in 
SCID tissues may be due to tissue cross-talk. For example, we cannot rule out the possibility 
that some phenotype in SCID skeletal muscle may have been caused by decreased adiposity.
Our finding that SCID mutation or treatment with DNA-PK inhibitor protects against aging-
associated decline in metabolism and physical fitness is at odds with the observation that 
DNA-PK−/− mice undergo accelerated aging (Espejel et al., 2004). The most likely

 explanation for this paradox is that the SCID mutation is leaky and the DNA-PK inhibitor 
does not inhibit DNA-PK completely. The residual DNA-PK activity may have some 
protective function against the level of DNA DSBs generated naturally. Moreover, in the 
non-lymphoid cells, the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex may contribute to NHEJ (Rass et al., 
2009) in a redundant manner.
In addition to the increase in DNA DSBs, another change that occurs with aging is the 
decline of NAD+, the cofactor for Sirt1 (Imai and Guarente, 2014). As Sirt1 plays an 
important role in mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, the decline in NAD+ levels 
may contribute to mitochondrial and metabolic decline. The roles of Sirt1 and DNA-PK in 
aging-related changes may be interlinked as AMPK promotes the synthesis of NAD+ by 
regulating the NAD+ biosynthetic enzyme Nampt (Fulco et al., 2008).
The biochemical function of HSP90 is to fold metastable proteins. One of the important 
concepts to come out of the HSP90 field is that it is a capacitor of phenotypic variation 
(Queitsch et al., 2002). That is, by acting as a buffer, HSP90 allows mutations or 
polymorphisms (inherited or acquired) to accumulate unseen, free from the pressures of 
natural selection. As demand for HSP90 function increases with stress, HSP90 is no longer 
able to shield these mutations, leading to a diverse array of defects. Adopting this concept to 
our work, HSP90α T5,7 phosphorylation, combined with the aging-associated stress, might 
decrease the ability of HSP90α to provide the necessary buffering at older age, at least in 
skeletal muscle (Figure 7C). As a consequence, chaperone function may be decreased and 
mutations or polymorphisms may be exposed at older age. In this scenario, aging and aging-
associated diseases may partly be a manifestation of the exposure of these mutations or 
polymorphisms.
Weight gain and lack of exercise is often attributed to poor lifestyle choices. One’s lifestyle 
is ultimately the individual’s choice, but we must acknowledge that strong underlying forces 
that cause metabolic and physical decline make healthy lifestyle goals difficult to attain with 
aging. Understanding the molecular basis of these forces will help us address more 
effectively the public health challenges brought on by obesity, lack of exercise and aging.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Cell Culture and siRNA transfection—C2C12 cells were obtained from American 
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s 
medium (DMEM) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (growth 
media) and 100 g/ml penicillin and streptomycin. C2C12 cells were used before passage 25. 
When C2C12 were nearly confluent (70%–80% confluency), they were induced to 
differentiate by replacing the growth media with the differentiation media (DMEM 
supplemented with 2% horse serum). For studies that use dexamethasone, we used charcoal-

 stripped 2% horse serum (Invitrogen) in the differentiation media. The mouse DNA-PKcs 
(ON-TARGETplus Mouse Prkdc (19090) siRNA - SMARTpool), HSP90α (ON-
TARGETplus Mouse Hsp90aa1 (15519) siRNA - SMARTpool, 5 nmol) were purchased 
from Dharmacon. Control siRNA (ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting siRNA #1) was also 
from Dharmacon. DNA-PKcs or HSP90α was knocked down by transfecting 80–90% 
confluent C2C12 cells with siRNA by using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were switched to low serum media (2% horse serum) to 
induce differentiation. Three days after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed.
Mice and rats: All experiments were approved by the ACUC (Animal Care and Use 
Committee) of the NHLBI and the University of Utah. Male C57BL/6, PrkdcSCID 
(B6.CB17-PrkdcSCID), B6.129S7-Rag1tm1Mom/J and B6.FVB(129S4)-Tg(Ckmm-cre)5/Khn 
mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine). DNA-PKcsfl/fl 
mice(Mishra et al., 2015) were bred with B6.FVB(129S4)-Tg(Ckmm-cre)5/Khn mice to 
generate DNA-PKcsfl/fl; CKmm-Cre (MDPKO) mice that were homozygous at each allele. 
AMPKα2KO mice (Viollet et al., 2003) were backcrossed to C57BL/6J for at least six 
generations. Unless indicated otherwise, mice were fed Lab Diet 5021. We used male 
littermate controls for all mouse studies.
For DNA-PK inhibitor (NU7441) studies in middle-age mice, mice were dosed once daily 
by oral gavage with or without 40 mg/kg/d NU-7441 in 10% PEG400 in saline for up to 12 
weeks. 10 l/g body weight was dosed by oral gavage. For high fat diet (HFD) studies with 
DNA-PK inhibitor in WT and/or AMPKα2KO mice, NU7441 was mixed with HFD (40% 
fat by calories, D12327, Research diet, New Brunswick, USA) at a concentration of 3g/kg of 
food to provide a 300 mg/kg dose, and pellets were then reconstituted. Control groups 
received pellets without NU7441. Body weight and caloric intake were monitored 
throughout the experiments. Mice were housed with a 12 hr light-dark cycle (light on 6 am–
6 pm) with free access to food and water.
To induce obesity in WT, SCID and RAG1−/− mice, they were fed HFD (60% fat by 
calories, D12492, Research Diets) for 5 mo starting immediately after weaning (3–4 weeks 
of age). Regular chow diet (RCD, 12% fat by Kcal) was purchased from Zeigler (Rodent 
NIH-31). Body weight was recorded monthly and food intake was measured every second 
day for 14 consecutive days.
The LCR and HCR rats were birthed and subsequently tested for treadmill endurance 
running capacity when 11 weeks old using procedures on an IACUC protocol approved by 
the University of Michigan. Only Male Rats were shipped from Ann Arbor, Michigan, via 
air courier at 6 mo age. Tissues were harvested from these rats at 7–9 mo age.
Rhesus Macaque tissue analysis: Animal care was provided in accordance with the NIH 
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and this research was approved by the 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Oregon National Primate Research 
Center. Male rhesus macques (Macaca mulatta) ranging in age 1–16 y.o. were used for the 
aging studies. After overnight fasting, animals were anesthetized and gastrocnemius and 
subcutaneous fat were biopsied. Female rhesus macaques (10–12 y.o.) were matched by

 body weight and age, then assigned to ad libitum control or 30% calorically-restricted (CR) 
treatment groups for 3.4 y. The monkeys were singly-caged indoors at a temperature of 24°C 
under a fixed 12 h light:12 h dark photoperiod, with unlimited access to drinking water. All 
animals received a specially formulated monkey chow that included additional vitamin and 
minerals to avoid any deficiencies in essential nutrients. Feedings were conducted at 0800 h 
and 1500 h each day, but with CR animals receiving 30% fewer calories, as previously 
described (Ingram et al., 1990; Ingram et al., 1993; Mattison et al., 2003). Monkeys were 
also supplemented with daily fresh fruits or vegetables.

METHODS DETAILS
Body composition analysis—Body fat and lean mass were measured by NMR (Bruker 
BioSpin Corporation, Houston, TX). Body fat indices were calculated by dividing fat or lean 
mass by body weight.
Insulin tolerance test (ITT) and Glucose tolerance test (GTT)—Plasma glucose 
was measured by using a glucometer (Ascensia). For the glucose tolerance test and insulin 
tolerance test, mice were fasted for 16 hr, and 1 mg/g glucose or 0.75 mIU/g insulin were 
injected intraperitoneally (i.p.). Blood glucose was measured at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min 
after injection.
Treadmill endurance test—Prior to the treadmill endurance tests, the mice were trained 
by running on an Exer-3/6 mouse treadmill (Columbus Instruments) at 10 m/min for 5 
minutes for 2 days. For the endurance test, the treadmill was set at a 15° incline, and the 
speed was increased in a stepwise-fashion (10 m/min for 10 min followed by 14 m/min for 5 
min and then the final speed of 18 m/min). The test was terminated when mice reached 
exhaustion, which was defined as immobility for more than 30 sec.
Fat absorption—A synthetic diet containing 5% sucrose polybehenate, which is not 
absorbed, was fed to WT and SCID mice for 3 days. Fecal samples were collected and 
analyzed for fatty acid methyl esters by gas chromatography. Fat absorption was calculated 
from the ratio of behenic acid to the other fatty acids in the diet.
Serum analysis—Serum nonesterified fatty acid and triglyceride were measured by 
spectrophotometric enzymatic assay (Free fatty acids, half micro test; Roche Diagnostics

 and Infinity Triglycerides liquid Stable Reagent; Thermo Scientific). Serum GLP-1 levels 
were measured using GLP-1 (active) ELISA (Millipore), according to the manufacturer’s 
directions. Serum insulin level was determined using an ELISA kit (EMD Millipore). Serum 
lactate level was measured by colorimetric assay kit (Eton Bioscience), serum IgG level was 
measured by easy-titer mouse IgG assay kit (Thermo Scientific).
Real-time PCR—Frozen skeletal muscles, liver, WAT and BAT were ground and 
homogenized in a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using 
TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Complementary DNA 
(cDNA) was synthesized from 2 μg of DNA-free total RNA using High Capacity cDNA 
Archive kit (Applied Biosystems). 10 μl of RNA (2 g) was mixed with 10 μl reverse 
transcriptase master mix (2X), which contained 2 μl 10× RT buffer, 2 μl 10X Random 
Primers, 0.8 μl 25X dNTP mix, 1 μl MultiScribe RT (50 U/ul) and 4.2 μl RNAse free water, 
giving a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 25°C for 10 min and 
37°C for 120 min. Reverse transcription products were diluted 1:3 in nuclease-free water, 
and 1  μl was used for RT-PCR with the Taqman core reagents RT-PCR kit (Applied 
Biosystems) in combination with the 7900T Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). 
The RT-PCR was performed for 40 cycles at the following cycling condition: 5°C for 10 min 
initial denaturation, then 40 cycles at 95°C denaturation, 60°C anneal/extension for 15 sec 
and 1 min at each temperature, respectively. 18S RNA was used as the internal standard for 
all mRNA. The following primers (Applied Biosystems) were used in these studies: 
PGC-1α, Mm00447183_m1; PGC-1β, Mm00504720_m1; PPARδ, Mm00803186_g1; 
CPT1b, Mm00487200_m1; ERRα, Mm00433143_m1; Tfam, Mm00447485_m1; Euk 
18SrRNA, 4333760F; AMPKα, Mm01264789_m1.
Transmission Electron Microscopy—The samples were fixed for 1 h in a mixture of 
2.5% glutaraldehyde, 4% paraformaldehyde, in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), washed in 
distilled water, and placed in 1% osmium for 1 hour. The samples were then washed again 
and dehydrated with acetone before infiltration and embedding with EPON 812. The EPON-
embedded samples were baked at 60°C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections (about 60–90nm) were 
cut on a Leica Ultracut Ultramicrotome, picked up on to copper grids stained with 
uranylacetate and lead citrate, and examined in a JEOL 1200EX Transmission Electron 
Micoscope (JEOL).
Immunoblotting and reagents—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and subjected to 
immunoblotting. The following antibodies were used: ACC1 (Cell Signaling); p-ACC1 (Cell 
ignaling); AMPK (Cell Signaling); p-AMPK(T172) (Cell Signaling); H2AX (Cell 
Signaling); phospho-H2AX(S139) (Cell Signaling); DNA-PK (Lab Vision); p-DNA-
PK(S2056) (Abcam); LKB1 (Santa Cruz); HSP90α (Millipore); p-HSP90(T5,7) (Cell 
Signaling); PGC-1α (Santa Cruz); Cyto C (Cell Signaling); Actin (Santa Cruz). 
Densitometry was performed with the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Whole-cell lysate preparation—Cell pellets were lysed on ice for 20 min in RIPA 
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium 
deoxycholate) freshly supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Millipore).

 Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Proteins were quantified 
using the Coomassie plus protein.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Quantification by Quantitative Real-Time PCR—
Relative amounts of nuclear DNA and mtDNA were determined by quantitative Real-Time 
PCR. The ratio of mtDNA to nuclear DNA reflects the tissue concentration of mitochondria 
per cell. Skeletal muscle tissue were homogenized and digested with Proteinase K overnight 
in a lysis buffer for DNA extraction by DNeasy blood and tissue kit (QIAGEN). Quantitative 
PCR was performed using each primers (mtDNA specific PCR, forward 5′-
CCGCAAGGGAAAGATGAAAGA-3′, reverse 5′-TCGTTTGGTTTCGGGGTTTC-3′; and 
nuclear DNA specific PCR, forward 5′-GCCAGCCTCTCCTGATTTTAGTGT-3′, reverse 
5′-GGGAACACAAAAGACCTCTTCTGG-3′) and Power SYBR Green PCR master mix 
(Applied Biosystems) in a 7900T Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The PCR 
reactions consisted of 10 μl Power SYBR Green PCR Master mix (2X), 7 μl RNAse free 
water, 1 μl 300 nM primer mix and 2 μl cDNA, to a total volume of 20 μl. Three technical 
replicates were performed for each sample. The cycling conditions were 15 minutes at 95° 
C, followed by 50 to 60 cycles of 15 seconds at 95° C, 20 seconds at 58° C and 20 seconds 
at 72° C as previously described(Lagouge et al., 2006).
Tissue lysate preparation—Frozen tissues were ground and homogenized in a mortar 
and pestle under liquid nitrogen. Samples were then incubated in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-
HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) freshly 
supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Millipore). In order to break the 
tissue up further and to shear DNA, lysates were sonicated briefly (5 sec, 140 watt, setting 7 
using Ultrasonics W-385 Sonicator (Heat Systems), which were then vortexed every 30 
minutes. The homogenates were incubated at 4°C for 2 h and then centrifuged (13,000 rpm) 
for 15 min at 4°C, and supernatants were collected.
Muscle fiber analysis—Muscle tissue lysates were prepared in a sample buffer consisting 
of dithiothreitol (DTT, 100 mM), sodium dodecyl ulphate (SDS, 2%), Tris-base (80 mM) pH 
6.8, glycerol (10%) and Bromphenol Blue (1.2% w/v). Samples were boiled (2 min) and 
electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE. Total acrylamide concentration was 4% and 8% in the 
stacking and resolving gels, respectively (bis-acrylamide, 1:50). Gels (16′ 22 cm, 0.75 mm 
thick) were run at a constant current of 10 mA until voltage rose to 275 V, and thereafter at 
constant voltage for 16 h at 4±6°C. For each muscle a volume corresponding to 1.25 lg of 
total protein was loaded into a well and gels were silver-stained (BioRad, Hercules, CA). 
Myosin heavy chain bands were analyzed by using a BioRad GS-800 Calibrated 
Densitometer and quantified by usingQuantity One.
Morphometric analysis—Electron microscopic morphometric analysis of the volume 
density of mitochondria was carried out in young and middle aged mice. Micrographs of 
randomly selected areas of muscle fibers were obtained and scanned. These micrographs 
were analyzed with an image analysis software (Aperio imagescope).
Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp—The clamp studies were performed in 
conscious, restrained mice. Four days before the clamp experiment, mice were anesthetized

 with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. A catheter was inserted into a lateral 
incision on the right side of the neck and advanced into the superior vena cava via the right 
internal jugular vein. The catheter was then sutured into place according to the protocol of 
MacLeod and Shapiro (MacLeod and Shapiro, 1988). Experiments were started at 0800 
hours, after a 14-hour fast. The basal rates of glucose turnover were measured by continuous 
infusion of [3-3H]glucose (0.05 μCi/min) for 120 min, which followed a bolus of 2 μCi. 
Blood samples (20 μl) were taken at 90 and 115 min of the basal period for the 
determination of plasma [3H] glucose concentration. A 120-min hyperinsulinemic 
euglycemic clamp was started at 10:00 AM. Insulin was infused as a bolus of 18 mU/kg over 
a period of 3 min followed by continuous insulin infusion at the rate of 2.5 mU·kg−1·min−1 
(Humulin R; Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, IN) to raise the plasma insulin concentration to ~1.5 
ng/ml. During the clamp study, blood samples (20 μl) were collected via a small nick in the 
tail vein at 15-min intervals for the immediate measurement of plasma glucose 
concentration, and 20% glucose was infused at variable rates to maintain blood glucose at 
~140 mg/dl in WT mice. Insulin stimulated whole body glucose flux was estimated using a 
continuous infusion of high-pressure liquid chromatography-purified [3-3H]glucose (0.1 
μCi/min; NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) throughout the clamps. To estimate 
insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity and metabolism in skeletal muscle, 2-deoxy-D-
[1-14C]glucose (NEN Life Science Products) was administered as a bolus (10 μCi) at 45 min 
before the end of clamps. Blood samples (20 μl) were taken at 80, 85, 90, 100, 110, and 120 
min after the start of clamps for the determination of plasma [3H]glucose, 2-deoxy-D-
[1-14C]glucose, and 3H2O concentrations. Additional blood samples (10 μl) were collected 
before the start and at the end of clamp studies for measurements of plasma insulin 
concentration. All infusions were performed using microdialysis pumps (CMA/
Microdialysis, Acton, MA). At the end of the clamp period, animals were anesthetized with 
ketamine-xylazine injection. Within 5 min, gastrocnemius muscle from hindlimbs, 
epididymal and brown adipose tissue, and liver were removed. Each tissue, once exposed, 
was dissected within 2 s, frozen immediately using liquid nitrogen-cooled aluminum blocks, 
and stored at –70°C for later analysis. The determination of plasma [3-3H]glucose and 2-
deoxy-D-[1-14C] glucose concentrations and tissue 2-deoxy-D-[1-14C] glucose-6-phosphate 
were performed as described previously (Youn et al., 1994). Basal endogenous glucose 
production was calculated as the ratio of the preclamp [3-3H]glucose infusion rate (dpm/
min) to the specific activity of the plasma glucose (mean of the values in the 90 and 115 min 
of basal preclamp period, in dpm/μmol). Clamp whole-body glucose uptake was calculated 
as the ratio of the [3-3H]glucose infusion rate (dpm/min) to the specific activity of plasma 
glucose (dpm/μmol) during the last 30 min of the clamp (mean of the 90–120 min samples). 
Clamp endogenous glucose production was determined by subtracting the average glucose 
infusion rate in the last 30 min of clamp from the whole-body glucose uptake. Muscle and 
white and brown adipose tissue glucose uptake was calculated from the plasma 2-deoxy-D-
[1-14C] glucose concentration profile (using plasma 14C counts at 80–120 min, the area 
under the curve was calculated by trapezoidal approximation) and tissue 2-deoxy-D-[1-14C] 
glucose-6-phosphate content as described previously (Youn et al., 1994). Tissue glycogen 
synthesis was calculated from 3H incorporation to glycogen (Toyoshima et al., 2005).

respiration was measured after addition of 5 mM Succinate and 10 mM Rotenone (Complex 
I inhibitor). State 3 respiration was assessed by adding 1 mM ADP and state 4 respiration 
measured after addition of 1 μg/mL oligomycin (ATP synthase inhibitor).
HOMA-IR—The HOMA-IR formula and HOMA2-IR online calculator downloaded from 
https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/ were used to calculate HOMA-IR.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical comparisons between groups were analyzed by Two-way ANOVA and Two-way 
repeated measures ANOVA for a parametric test or Mann-Whitney test for a nonparametric 
test using Prism7. Results are expressed as the mean±s.e.m. Significance was accepted at 
p<0.05. The Excel software (Microsoft) was used to determine average values, standard 
errors and standard deviations. For each figure, number of experimental replicates and other 
information relevant for assessing the accuracy and precision of the analysis are included in 
the accompanying legend.

 Figure 5. DNA-PK inhibition increases physical fitness in obese and middle aged animals
Gastrocnemius muscle fiber composition in middle aged WT and SCID mice (A) and in WT 
middle aged mice fed vehicle or the DNA-PK inhibitor for 10–12 wk (B) (n=5 per group). 
All values are given as mean ± s.e.m. ***, p<0.001 (Two-way ANOVA) between genotype 
and treatment groups. (C) Resting serum lactate levels in middle-age WT and SCID mice. 
Mann-Whitney Test: *, p<0.05 between WT and SCID values. (D) The distance (in meters) 
young (Y, 4 months old) and middle aged (MA, 12 mo) WT and SCID mice ran on the 
treadmill before exhaustion. For young, n=8; middle aged, n=8, for each genotype. Mann-
Whitney Test: **, p<0.01 between WT and SCID values. (E) The distance middle aged 
(MA) and obese (Ob) mice treated with either vehicle or DNA-PKcs inhibitor ran on the 
treadmill before exhaustion (n=10 per treatment group). Mann-Whitney Test: **, p<0.01 
between the treatment groups. (F) The distance obese WT and AMPKα2 knockout mice 
treated with either vehicle or DNA-PKcs inhibitor ran on the treadmill before exhaustion 
(n=4–6 per treatment group). Mann-Whitney Test: *, p<0.05 between the treatment groups.

 Figure 6. Inhibition of DNA-PK protects against obesity and type-2 diabetes
(A) Weight gain of WT mice fed HFD (±NU7441) (n=10 per treatment group). All values 
are expressed as mean ± s.e.m. ***, p<0.001 (Two-way repeated measures ANOVA) 
between the treatment groups. Glucose tolerance (B) and insulin sensitivity (C) of mice on 
HFD (±NU7441) for 10–12 wk are shown (n=10 per treatment group). ***, p<0.001 (Two-
way repeated measures ANOVA) between the treatment groups. (D) Plasma concentrations 
of GLP-1 in mice fed HFD (±NU7441) (n=7–8 per treatment group). Mann-Whitney Test: 
**, p<0.01 between the treatment groups. A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study was 
performed on mice fed HFD (±NU7441) (n=7–8 per treatment group) to measure (E) 
glucose infusion rate (GIR), (F) glucose disposal rate (GDR), (G and H) glucose uptake 
(GU) in skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) and WAT, respectively, and (I) endogenous glucose 
production (EGP) from the liver. N.S., not significant; *, p<0.05 between the treatment 
groups.
