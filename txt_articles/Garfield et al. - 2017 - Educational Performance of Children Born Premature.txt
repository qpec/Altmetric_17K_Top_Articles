IMPORTANCE Survivors of preterm birth often present with medical morbidities; however,
variation in their long-term educational performance has not been well described.
OBJECTIVE To estimate the association between gestational age and 4 outcomes in
school-aged children: readiness to enter kindergarten, scores on standardized tests in
elementary and middle school, gifted status, and low performance.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a retrospective cohort study, children born in Florida
between 1992 and 2002 at 23 to 41 weeks’gestation who entered Florida’
s public schools
between 1995 and 2012 were assessed for kindergarten readiness and tested in mathematics
and reading in grades 3 through 8. Data analysis was performed from January 12, 2016, to
March 1, 2017.
EXPOSURES Gestational age at birth.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Kindergarten readiness, scores on the Florida
Comprehensive Achievement Test (FCAT), classified as gifted, and classified as low
performance.
RESULTS A total of 1 527 113 singleton infants with gestational ages of 23 to 41 weeks born
between 1992 and 2002 were matched to Florida public school records. Of these, 1 301 497
children were included in the analysis; 641 479 (49.3%) were girls. A total of 301 (65.0%)
Florida children born at 23 to 24 weeks’gestation were designated as ready to start
kindergarten. When the FCAT test scores were adjusted for potentially confounding maternal
and infant variables, children born at 23 to 24 weeks’gestation performed 0.66 SD (95% CI,
−0.73 to −0.59) lower compared with those born at full term. A total of 123 554 (9.5%) of all
Florida-born public school students were considered gifted, including 17 (1.8%) of those born
at 23 to 24 weeks’gestation. In comparison, 75 458 (5.8%) of all Florida-born public school
students were low performing; 310 (33.5%) of these children had been born at 23 to 24
weeks’gestation. Kindergarten readiness, FCAT scores, and gifted status were positively
related to gestational age, whereas low performance was inversely related to gestational age.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although gestational age has long been associated with poor
educational performance, a sufficient proportion of children born near the limits of viability
performed within expected school norms, warranting further investigation into how and why
certain children are able to overcome the educational burdens that may follow preterm birth.

reterm birth confers risks of mortality, medical
morbidities,1,2 and adverse neurodevelopment in
early childhood.3 Numerous studies have documented
neurodevelopmental impairment among infants with shorter
gestational ages (extremely premature, <28 weeks’gesta-
tion), typically assessed close to 2 years’corrected age.4 Both
motor and cognitive disabilities have been related to anteced-
entmaternalhealthcharacteristics5andmedicalinterventions.6

ciations of later markers of neurodevelopmental impairment
or, conversely, academic achievement with early infant char-
acteristics remain elusive,11,12 particularly as they pertain to

reports that differ greatly because of variation in size of report-

assessment.16 Parents in turn may have difficulty grasping how

ment, cerebral palsy, and cognitive impairments, may be hard

come, such as school readiness. However, measures of school
readiness or later assessment of school performance may not
be standardized across states or nations.
The aim of this study was to estimate the association be-
tween gestational age at birth and school readiness and per-
formance, including performance on school-based standard-
ized assessments between third and eighth grade among
surviving infants born in Florida between 1992 and 2002. We
hypothesized that the degree of prematurity is associated
with both the readiness to start kindergarten and the level of
impairment throughout school in these cohorts.
Methods
Study Cohorts
All birth certificates from singleton infants born at 23 to 41
weeks’gestation in Florida from 1992 to 2002 and surviving
to 1 year were obtained from the Florida Bureau of Vital
Statistics. Certificates were matched to Florida public school
educational records maintained in the Education Data
Warehouse of the Florida Department of Education accord-
ing to 4 variables: first and last names, date of birth, and so-
cial security number. To maximize correct matches, transpo-
sition of letters or numbers was allowed in up to 2 instances
as long as the transposition did not match more than 1 record.
Children were included if they (1) were born in Florida,
(2) remained in Florida until school age, and (3) attended
Florida public schools. Complete data for children attending
private schools were unavailable and excluded. Results were
compared with findings from the American Community
Survey,21 a 1% representative sample of the US population, to
provide face validity in match rates to the proportion of Florida
children who go on to attend public schools.
Thisstudywasapprovedbytheinstitutionalreviewboards
of Northwestern University, the University of Florida, and
Florida’
s education and health agencies and involved a thor-
ough review of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
as well as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act regulations.22
Exposure and Outcome Variables
Gestational age at birth as recorded in the birth certificate was
the primary exposure and was stratified into 9 groups: 23 to
24, 25 to 26, 27 to 28, 29 to 30, 31 to 32, 33 to 34, 35 to 36, 37
to 38, and 39 to 41 weeks’gestation. Four educational out-
comes were assessed: kindergarten readiness, mean Florida
Comprehensive Achievement Test (FCAT) scores, gifted
status, and low performance.
Kindergarten readiness assessment was a dichotomous
(ready/not ready) variable ascertained between ages 5 and 6
years. From the 1998-1999 to 2001-2002 school years when
children entered school, readiness was determined by a check-
list of academic and behavioral skills designed by the Florida
Department of Education23 and administered by the teacher.
Fromthe2006-2007to2008-2009schoolyears,readinesswas
determined by the Florida Dynamic Indicators of Basic Life
Early Literacy Skills assessment.24 Readiness was not
assessed during the 2002-2003 to 2005-2006 school years.
The FCAT score is an assessment administered in Florida
schools that we have standardized at grade and school year as
a mean (SD) score of 0 (1). Available standardized scores for
children in grades 3 to 8 (aged 8-14 years) were averaged for
each child across grades and the 2 tests (math and reading).
A child with gifted status is defined by the Florida Depart-
ment of Education as “one who has superior intellectual
developmentandiscapableofhighperformance.
”25Giftedsta-
tus is assessed throughout schooling, with a median age at
assignment of 8 years among those classified as gifted. This
Key Points
Question How well do children who were born prematurely
perform in elementary and middle school?
Findings In this population-based study of 1 301 497 children,
those who were born prematurely frequently performed at levels
comparable to the level of children born at full term on tests of
kindergarten readiness and standardized mathematics and
reading competences. A small proportion of children born near the
limits of viability achieved gifted status.
Meaning The effects of prematurity—including extreme
prematurity—are not uniformly deleterious.

 status can generally be considered static as 82.8% of children
classified as gifted were so identified in grade 4 or before, and
only 1.5% of students classified as gifted have their status
revoked. Thus, this was a dichotomous variable (yes/no)
constructed as ever being classified gifted.
Low performance is defined as either being below the 5th
percentile on the averaged FCAT score or having a missing test
score and a disability such that participation in the statewide
assessment program was deemed “not appropriate.
”26 A total
of 76.6% of children who are ever considered disabled had al-
readyreceivedtheirdisabilityclassificationpriortocommence-
mentoftestingingrade3.Forthisreason,aswellasthefactthat
prior disability in this or any grade is highly path dependent on
prior disability classification, this dichotomous variable (yes/
no) was constructed as a single measure of ever observed.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to quantify the maternal and
infantcharacteristicsafterstratifyingtheeligiblecohortsbyges-
tational age. Differences in the characteristics between the ges-
tationalagestratawereidentifiedusingregressionanalysisand
F test. Two-tailed P values for all characteristics were <.001.
ThemeanFCATscoresofgestationalagegroupswerecom-
pared using linear regression models; logistic regression mod-
els were used to estimate the odds for kindergarten readi-
ness, gifted status, and low performance. In all models, each
gestational age group presents contrasts relative to full-term
(39-41 weeks’gestation) infants. To account for family back-
ground characteristics, analyses were adjusted for available
maternal and child variables contained in the birth certifi-
cate. The variables considered were those related to gesta-
tional age and known or hypothesized to be related to future
educational attainment or performance. These maternal vari-
ables include indicators for African American race, Hispanic
ethnicity, birth outside of the United States, age at the time of
birth (classified as <20, 20-29, 30-35, and ≥36 years), 3 edu-
cational levels (classified as <12, 12-15, and >15 years of edu-
cation), number of prior births, health problems (eg, hyper-
tension, diabetes), language spoken at home, start of prenatal
care in first trimester, and marital status. Infant characteris-
tics were controlled for by including indicators for sex, con-
genital anomalies (eg, spina bifida, Down syndrome), abnor-
mal conditions at birth (eg, meconium aspiration syndrome,
seizures),andtimingofbirth(monthandyear).TheFCATscore
analysis further controlled for indicators of the child’
s age
in third grade to account for differences in “holding back”
decisions that may have been related to gestational age.
Three sensitivity analyses were conducted with a subset of
the data. First, we repeated the analysis, restricting it to 1994-
2002birthcohortstofocusonthechildrenwhoweremorelikely

rated the available zip code-level data and Medicaid eligibility
indicators for this same 1994-2002 data set as additional
covariates (both shown in the eFigure in the Supplement).

Results
From 1992 through 2002, there were 1 896 674 singleton births
with complete birth certificate information on infants born
from 23 to 41 weeks’gestation in Florida. Matches were made
for 1 527 113 (80.5%) records on children born in Florida who at-
tended public schools. Results from the American Community
Survey indicated that 80.9% of Florida-born infants attended
publicschools,suggestingthatthelinkageratewashighandthat
nearly all potentially matchable children were matched in our
data. In comparing the full birth sample with children who en-
rolled in Florida schools, we noted that children who were in
the final study sample had less educated mothers who were
more likely to be unmarried and African American compared
withthosewhoeitherleftthestateorenrolledinprivateschools
(eTable 2 in the Supplement; column 1 vs column 4).
The matched data set contained FCAT scores for 1 276 943
(83.6%)Florida-bornchildrenwhosubsequentlyattendedstate
public schools. Records on children who left the state prior to
the start of testing in the third grade or had missing test score
information accounted for 225 616 (14.8%) and 12 777 (0.8%) of
the remaining sample, respectively. Disability that precluded
FCAT scoring accounted for 11 777 (0.8%) of the records; how-
ever, these children were included when gifted status and low
performance were assessed. Finally, the kindergarten readi-
ness measure was present in 678 072 (44.4%) student records
because the state did not test readiness every year.
Maternal and infant characteristics were tabulated by ges-
tational age (Table). Groups with gestational ages classified as
extremely preterm (<28 weeks’gestation) had a higher pro-
portion of African American mothers and a lower proportion
of married mothers compared with the very preterm (28-31
weeks’gestation), preterm (32-36 weeks’gestation), and term
(37-41 weeks’gestation) groups. Although statistically signifi-
cant differences were identified for all variables (P < .001), fre-
quencies in male sex of the infant, high school education,
Hispanic ethnicity, and nativity status appeared to be rela-
tively static with respect to the duration of pregnancies.
Of Florida children born at 23 to 24 weeks’gestation, 301
(65.0%) were designated as kindergarten ready. This propor-
tionincreasedwithgestationalage,with391 376(85.3%)ofchil-
dren born at full term deemed kindergarten ready. The unad-
justed and adjusted associations between gestational age and
kindergarten readiness were similar (Figure, A). The adjusted
odds ratios (ORs) for premature compared with full-term
children were 0.35 (95% CI, 0.29-0.44) for children born at 23
to 24 weeks’gestation, 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.85) for those born
at 29 to 30 weeks’gestation, and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.86-0.91) for
those born at 35 to 36 weeks’gestation.

 Among children who took the FCAT, both adjusted and un-
adjusted FCAT scores were higher for those born prematurely
but with longer gestational age compared with full-term chil-
dren (Figure, B). For children born at 23 to 24 weeks’gesta-
tion, their adjusted FCAT score was 0.66 SD (95% CI, −0.73 to
−0.59) lower than that of those born at full term. Correspond-
ingly, the FCAT scores of children born at 29 to 30 weeks’ges-
tation (−0.18 SD; 95% CI, −0.20 to −0.15) and 35 to 36 weeks’
gestation (−0.03 SD; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.02) were also lower
than the scores of those born at full term.
A total of 123 554 (9.5%) Florida-born public school stu-
dents were deemed gifted. The proportion of gifted students
increased with gestational age, from 17 (1.8%) children
among those born at 23 to 24 weeks’gestation to 86 199 (9.9%)
for those born at full term. In multivariable analysis, the ad-
justed ORs increased with rising gestational age (P < .001)
(Figure, C) and, compared with children born at full term, were
0.23 (95% CI, 0.14-0.38) at 23 to 24 weeks’gestation, 0.63 (95%
CI, 0.55-0.72) at 29 to 30 weeks’gestation, and 0.91 (95% CI,
0.88-0.94) at 35 to 36 weeks’gestation.
Finally, 75 458 (5.8%) of all Florida-born public school stu-
dents were considered low performers, and 310 (33.5%) chil-
dren born at 23 to 24 weeks’gestation had this poor cognitive
outcome. The proportion of children defined as low perform-
ers decreased with gestational age to 46 743 (5.4%) of those
born at full term. Compared with full-term children, the ad-
justed ORs for those born prematurely were 7.68 (95% CI, 6.57-
8.98), 2.01 (95% CI, 1.84-2.20), and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.22-1.30) for
children born at 23 to 24, 29 to 30, and 35 to 36 weeks’gesta-
tion, respectively (Figure, D).
Discussion
In this longitudinal, secondary data analysis of prospectively
collected data on nearly all matchable children born in Florida
from 1992 to 2002, the degree of prematurity was associated
with worse educational outcomes. Children born at a lower
gestational age (1) were less likely to be kindergarten ready,
(2) scored lower on standardized tests, (3) were less likely to be
classified as gifted, and (4) were more likely to perform at a low
level compared with children born at full term. This pattern
alignswitharecentdescriptionoftherelationshipbetweenges-
tational age and kindergarten academic achievement in a rep-
resentative sample of the 2001 US birth cohort.27 However, the

 studies, perform well within expected school norms. To our
knowledge, this is the first US-based study utilizing state reg-
istry data and delineating educational performance in school
from kindergarten through 8th grade based on gestational age
while accounting for confounding factors related to maternal
and socioeconomic differences.
Our analysis used a novel population-based cohort link-
ing statewide births in Florida and educational assessments
measured in nearly all live-born children over an 11-year
period. This analysis also took advantage of a high rate of
follow-up, with 67.3% in the full birth cohort population and
99.3% among potentially observable records. This high rate of
follow-up occurred outside the context of a specific random-
ized trial or observational study and incorporated population-
based outcome assessments in children’
s educational set-
tings. In doing so, we demonstrate the utility of a potentially
reproducible method of assessing these cognitive outcomes
and, specifically, prematurity in ways that may be recapitu-
lated in other states or countries.
These results contribute to the growing body of
knowledge11,12 that, although preterm birth—even near the
traditional limits of viability—confers risks of long-term
developmental impairments, the outcomes may not be uni-
formly deleterious.1,2,9,10,28,29 Considerable variability exists
in the type and severity of impairment in extremely preterm
infants.30,31 Our results suggest that, by 5 to 6 years, the nega-
tiveeffectsofpretermbirthonkindergartenreadiness32orlater
achieving competence in mathematics and reading tests might
be less than expected when compared with full-term infants.33
These findings may assist clinicians in reassuring parents dur-
ing and after their infant’
s discharge from the neonatal inten-
sive care unit. Moreover, these findings are supported by the

A, Kindergarten readiness odds ratios (ORs); error bars indicate 95% CI. There is
a mean (SD) value of 0.853 (0.354) for the reference group (39-41 weeks’
gestation). B, Linear regression of mean Florida Comprehensive Achievement
Test (FCAT) scores. Error bars indicate 95% CI. There is a mean (SD) value of
0.028 (0.992) for the reference group. C, Gifted status ORs; error bars indicate
95% CI. There is a mean (SD) value of 0.099 (0.298) for the reference group.
D, Low performance ORs; error bars indicate 95% CI. There is a mean (SD) value
of 0.054 (0.255) for the reference group. All coefficients are relative to full-term
gestation. Sample was based on 1992-2002 birth cohorts, but birth cohorts
1997-1999 were excluded in the kindergarten readiness analysis because
readiness was not assessed in these 3 years. Standard errors corrected for
heteroscedasticity were used to calculate 95% CI. The unadjusted analysis did
not include controls. The adjusted analysis controlled for the following maternal
characteristics: race, ethnicity, nativity status, marital status, educational level,
age at the time of the child’
s birth, number of previous births, prenatal care
started in first trimester, maternal health problems, and language spoken at
home. It also controlled for the following child characteristics: sex, month and
year of birth indicators, congenital anomalies, abnormal conditions at birth, and
age in third grade for test scores.

 large, longitudinal design covering 11 cohorts that corre-
sponded to the time frame during which many advances in
perinatal medicine (eg, antenatal corticosteroids34 and
surfactant) were achieved.
Limitations
Limitations exist for this study. As an analysis of administra-
tive data, our findings are associations and do not imply
causality. Although our follow-up rate was high, it does not
exclude the possibility that children who were not tested were
systematically different from those who were. For example,
our public schools sample comprised relatively fewer afflu-
entfamiliesbecauseaffluentfamiliesweremorelikelytomove
away from Florida or educate their children in private schools
where state-standardized testing was not required. In addi-
tion, our initial sample was positively selected because we re-
quired an infant to survive at least to 1 year. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention–linked birth-death cohort data
for Florida for 1995-2002 births suggest that the 1-year
mortality rate is as high as 49% among infants born at 23 to
24 weeks’gestation.35
As in any analysis of secondary data, unknown and
unmeasured factors (eg, incidence of bronchopulmonary
dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, caffeine or cortico-
steroid use, or even family and environmental factors) may
have modified the observed associations. Moreover, coding
errors within administrative data are always a concern; for
example, gestational age may have been misclassified, which
is a factor documented in other geographic regions.36,37 In our
sample, the median birthweight for infants born near the lim-
its of viability (23-24 weeks) was approximately 9% larger than
the published values found in Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention natality files.38 The median birthweights for all
other gestational age groups were equal to or lower than offi-
cial statistics that include 1-year mortality. However, we found
the pattern of results to be identical in the subcohort of
low-risk pregnancies.
Finally, 2 of our outcomes—kindergarten readiness and
FCAT score—are objective measures based on results
using standardized assessment instruments. Our other 2
outcomes—giftedstatusandlowperformance—havesomelevel
of subjectivity because these classifications are the result of
parent and teacher conferences that culminate in drafting
an individualized learning plan.
Conclusions
The limitations do not diminish the findings in this linked
birth certificate and school-based data set that a portion of
prematurely born children—even those of extremely pre-
term birth—will enter kindergarten ready to learn, do well
on mathematics and reading tests, and be considered gifted.
Understanding why certain children are able to overcome
the educational burdens of preterm birth and thrive is an
area for future investigation.
