Anti-drug antibodies in hemophilia patients substantially
complicate treatment. Their elimination through immune
tolerance induction (ITI) protocols poses enormous costs,
and ITI is often ineffective for factor IX (FIX) inhibitors. More-
over, there is no prophylactic ITI protocol to prevent anti-drug
antibody (ADA) formation. Using general immune suppres-
sion is problematic. To address this urgent unmet medical
need, we delivered antigen bioencapsulated in plant cells to he-
mophilia B dogs. Commercial-scale production of CTB-FIX
fusion expressed in lettuce chloroplasts was done in a hydro-
ponic facility. CTB-FIX (�1 mg/g) in lyophilized cells was
stable with proper folding, disulfide bonds, and pentamer as-
sembly after 30-month storage at ambient temperature. Robust
suppression of immunoglobulin G (IgG)/inhibitor and IgE for-
mation against intravenous FIX was observed in three of four
hemophilia B dogs fed with lyophilized lettuce cells expressing
CTB-FIX. No side effects were detected after feeding CTB-FIX-
lyophilized plant cells for >300 days. Coagulation times were
markedly shortened by intravenous FIX in orally tolerized
treated dogs, in contrast to control dogs that formed high-titer
antibodies to FIX. Commercial-scale production, stability, pro-
longed storage of lyophilized cells, and efficacy in tolerance in-
duction in a large, non-rodent model of human disease offer a
novel concept for oral tolerance and low-cost production and
delivery of biopharmaceuticals.
INTRODUCTION
Currently, protein drugs for the treatment of human diseases are typi-
cally administered intravenously (i.v.), such as in enzyme-replace-
ment therapies (ERTs) for genetic diseases or monoclonal antibody
therapies. Anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation is a serious compli-
cation that not only renders therapy ineffective but can also cause
severe immunotoxicities. Unfortunately, no immune tolerance proto-
cols are currently available for patients to prevent ADA formation.
General immune suppression can be applied, as for example in treat-
ment of Pompe disease, but is not generally acceptable.1,2 In the case
of the X-linked bleeding disorder hemophilia, immune tolerance in-
duction (ITI) protocols are attempted only after neutralizing anti-
bodies (termed “inhibitors”) have formed. This strategy puts patients
at risk of increased morbidity and mortality until the inhibitors are
eradicated, which can take months to years and is not effective in
all patients.3,4 Conceptually, oral tolerance offers an elegant solution.
Uptake of orally administered protein by the intestinal immune sys-
tem can induce a state of immune tolerance, in which responses to
this specific antigen are systemically suppressed.5 Although proof of
principle has been achieved in numerous studies in mice, preclinical
studies in large, non-rodent animal models are lacking. Oral tolerance
induction has yielded only limited success in clinical trials for autoim-
mune diseases.5,6 However, multiple recent studies aimed to desensi-
tize from food allergens suggest that oral tolerance is applicable to
humans.7,8
However, a new emerging system offers potential solutions to afore-
mentioned challenges. Protein drugs are expressed at high levels in
plant chloroplasts, and lyophilized plant cells can be stored for
several years maintaining their folding, assembly, and efficacy,
which facilitate low-cost current good manufacturing practices
(cGMP) production.9–12 Upon oral delivery, the plant cell wall
(based on unique structural composition) protects protein drugs
from acids and enzymes in the stomach, which are incapable of
breaking down all glycosidic bonds. However, when intact plant
cells reach the gut, commensal bacteria release cellulases and lyse
plant cells, releasing protein drugs into the gut lumen.13,14 When
suitable tags are fused to protein drugs, they cross the gut epithe-
lium and are delivered into circulation or the immune system.13,15
Therefore, engineered plant cells are exceptionally suitable for oral
delivery of protein drugs, preventing protein degradation prior to
reaching the small intestine and accomplishing transmucosal deliv-
ery to the immune or circulatory system. However, initial studies
supporting this concept have been done in small animal models
(mice and rats) and are awaiting evaluation in large animal models
that could offer valuable information on drug delivery, stability, and
potential toxicity.

 The challenges for oral tolerance include protection from degradation
prior to reaching the small intestine, efficient translocation across the
intestinal epithelium and targeting of the gut immune system, and
high cost of production of the protein antigen. Current recombinant
production systems use fermentation facilities, which cost $500–$900
million,16,17 and require prohibitively expensive purification of host
proteins.18 In addition, purified proteins are highly unstable and
require cold storage and transportation. In order to address these con-
cerns, it is important to develop new strategies for production and
oral delivery of protein drugs.
In previous studies, we documented that repeated oral delivery of
frozen transplastomic leaf cells expressing CTB (cholera toxin B
subunit) fusions of coagulation factor IX (FIX) prevented inhibitor
formation and anaphylaxis to i.v. replacement therapy in hemo-
philia B mice.19,20 Similarly, inhibitor formation against factor VIII
(FVIII) was suppressed in hemophilia A mice using an analogous
approach.21,22 Early studies utilized transplastomic tobacco, which,
however, is not suitable for clinical application due to its nicotine con-
tents. Therefore, we optimized chloroplast gene transfer and expres-

RESULTS
Production and Characterization of CTB-
FIX Expressed in Lettuce Chloroplasts
To produce high concentrations of human FIX
fused with the transmucosal carrier CTB, we
utilized the chloroplast transformation technol-
ogy in edible plant cells in combination with the
unlimited scalability of the plant-production system. Germination of
the CTB-FIX lettuce seeds in the selection medium showed maternal
inheritance and lack of Mendelian segregation (data not shown).
Mature CTB-FIX lettuce leaves were harvested in the H.D. lab green-
house. Multiple harvests of the mature CTB-FIX leaves were made
every �3 weeks until transplastomic plants reached the flowering
stage. To feed hemophilia B dogs with lettuce-cell-derived CTB-FIX
antigen, lyophilized CTB-FIX lettuce dry powder was prepared. A to-
tal of �700 g (dry weight) of CTB-FIX leaf powder was generated
from more than 14 kg of fresh leaves. In this study, approximately
430 g of dry leaf powder derived from four batches of preparations
(defined as Fed-B1, Fed-B2, Fed-B3, and Fed-B4, respectively) were
used to feed hemophilia B dogs. As determined by western blot quan-
titation, the CTB-FIX concentrations (mg/g dry weight [DW]) varied
in different batches based on age and growth conditions as follows
(Figures 1A–1D): Fed-B1 (0.78 ± 0.02); Fed-B2 (1.97 ± 0.04); Fed-
B3 (2.13 ± 0.02); and Fed-B4 (2.00 ± 0.04). Fed-B1 was used to
feed dogs O07 and O67. Fed-B2 and Fed-B3 were both used to feed
dogs S14 and S15. Fed-B3 and Fed-B4 were both used to feed dogs
P44 and S12 (Tables S1 and S2). The �40-kDa polypeptide was

 observed in all the plant extracts, including untransformed wild-type
control (lane “WT” in Figures 1A–1C). Therefore, the �40-kDa poly-
peptide cross-reacting with CTB antibody is an endogenous protein
in lettuce cells and not due to cleavage of CTB-FIX fusion protein.
Dry powder weight was adjusted to feed identical doses of CTB-FIX
in all batches of dogs. Except for the first batch, during which growth
conditions were optimized, all other batches showed similar levels of
expression.
As pentameric structure of CTB-fusion protein is essential for bind-
ing to GM1-ganglioside receptor of the intestinal epithelial cells,
GM1-binding-based ELISA assay was used to evaluate stability of
folding, disulfide bonds, and pentamer assembly of CTB-FIX in
different batches.12,19,22,25 CTB-FIX protein extracts from all four
batches of leaf powder showed strong binding affinity to GM1 (Fig-
ure 1E), confirming functional stability of the CTB-FIX pentamers
in lyophilized leaves after prolonged storage at ambient temperature
for 30 months (Fed-B1), 14 months (Fed-B2), 12 months (Fed-B3),
and 10 months (Fed-B4). For hemophilia B dog studies, the lyophi-
lized leaves were used within 5–10 months of storage at ambient
temperature, which is well within the effective shelf life of bio-
encapsulated CTB-FIX (Table S2). As shown in Figure 1F, intact
CTB-FIX monomer without any cleaved product was detected as
the predominant band in all tested samples with equal loading
amounts, which was confirmed by re-probing blots with antibody
for a major chloroplast protein, Rubisco.
To facilitate translational studies of hemophilia B, we also used the
Fraunhofer cGMP hydroponic system to generate clinical-grade
CTB-FIX lettuce biomass. In order to find an optimal growth condi-
tion in this hydroponic system, a time course study was performed via
harvesting different batches of leaves from the same population of
plants at different plant age. The collected fresh leaves were lyophi-
lized and ground into dry powder. We observed that the CTB-FIX
expression levels increased as plants grew older. The CTB-FIX con-
centrations (mg/g DW) in five tested plant ages (days) were 0.47 ±
0.04 (32 days), 0.95 ± 0.10 (51 days), 1.18 ± 0.08 (78 days), 1.81 ±
0.10 (101 days), and 1.79 ± 0.05 (121 days), which were equivalent
to 0.15% (±0.01%), 0.32% (±0.03%), 0.37% (±0.03%), 0.48%
(±0.03%), and 0.57% (±0.01%) of total leaf proteins, respectively
(Figure 2B). These results showed that high-level expression of
CTB-FIX was obtained between 101 days and 121 days of plant
growth, suggesting that the CTB-FIX lettuce leaves should be har-
vested at later stages of plant growth in the hydroponic system,
balancing this with biomass yield. The fresh weight (g) of the leaves
harvested from �500 plants at five different ages were 1,304
(32 days), 1,068 (51 days), 1,368 (78 days), 926 (101 days), and 656
(121 days), respectively. Irrespective of the harvest time, CTB-FIX
was highly stable during storage and no cleaved product was detected
(Figure 2A). It should be pointed out that the CTB-FIX fusion lacks
the pre-pro-peptide of FIX and thus is not subject to g-carboxylation,
resulting in a complete lack of coagulation activity.
Antibody Formation against Human FIX in Hemophilia B Dogs
upon Repeated i.v. Delivery
Outbred hemophilia B dogs (20–24 kg) of the UNC-Chapel Hill strain
were used. These dogs have a F9 missense mutation, undetectable
circulating FIX antigen and activity, and phenotypically severe hemo-
philia B.26,27 This strain of dog was chosen because it has a track re-
cord of high degree of predictive accuracy for translational studies.23
First, a pilot study was performed to document safety of CTB-FIX in
dogs and to try to identify a suitable protocol for i.v. FIX challenges
for a follow-on study (Table S1). Bioencapsulated CTB-FIX was fed
to two female hemophilia B dogs (O07 and O67) 2� per week for
10 months in a dose that ranged from 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg. CTB-FIX-ex-
pressing lyophilized plant cells were mixed with canned dog food, and
the dogs usually completely consumed the mixture in <5 min. The
dogs were fed dry dog food on the other days. No adverse events
were detected clinically, nor were there any significant changes in
serum liver enzymes, serum creatinine, or total protein and albumin
(Table 1).
Figure 2. cGMP Hydroponic Production of CTB-FIX
Transplastomic lettuce plants expressing CTB-FIX were grown in Fraunhofer cGMP
hydroponic system. Leaves were harvested after 32, 51, 78, 101, and 121 days of
plant growth. (A) Western blot quantification of CTB-FIX amounts in lettuce leaves
harvested at different ages is shown. (B) Concentrations of CTB-FIX in lyophilized
lettuce leaves at different stages of growth are shown. Data shown are means ± SD

 Two other female hemophilia B dogs (P08 and P10) received weekly
i.v. injections of recombinant human FIX (10 IU/kg) for 4 weeks (Fig-
ure 3A). As a result, both animals formed human FIX-specific immu-
noglobulin G2 (IgG2) (the equivalent to murine IgG1 and human
IgG4) at �5 mg/mL (Figure 3B). Inhibitory antibodies were also
detected at 5–7 BU/mL at week 5, which however declined to undetect-
able within 1 week (Figure 3D). Therefore, we chose an extended treat-
ment of eight weekly i.v. injections of FIX for subsequent experiments.
Furthermore, to “standardize” the comparison of the humoral im-
mune response to FIX in fed versus control dogs, we sought to estab-
lish a challenge protocol that consistently raised IgG2 anti-FIX levels
to >10 mg/mL. Two male dogs (P05 and S13) again formed IgG2
against FIX at �5 mg/mL after four injections (Figure 3B; hence,
IgG2 anti-FIX formation is highly reproducible at a predictable titer
and is independent of gender or age, which ranged from 15 months
to 5 years). By eight injections in these two animals, IgG2 titers rose
to 19–23 mg/mL. Furthermore, both dogs (P05 and S13) additionally
formed IgG1 at later time points (Figure 3B). One dog (S13) developed
an inhibitory antibody by 1 week after the fourth i.v. injection, which
peaked at 53 BU/mL and lasted for 6 weeks (Figure 3D). The other dog
(P05) formed an inhibitor after the sixth injection, which peaked at 7
BU/mL and lasted for 4 weeks (Figure 3D). In addition, both dogs had
visible anaphylactic reactions (including a transient drop in blood
pressure and general unresponsiveness) at the fourth or seventh i.v. in-
jection and developed circulating IgE against FIX (Figures 4A and 4B).
To counter these anaphylactic reactions, antihistamine was given.
Antihistamine was administered with all subsequent FIX injections
to these control dogs out of precaution (orally tolerized dogs also
received antihistamine with these late FIX injections in order to
keep the treatment protocols identical). WBCT and thromboelastog-
raphy showed complete correction of coagulation after each of the first
three injections and partial correction upon the fourth injection (Fig-
ures 5A and 5B), correlating with the onset of anti-FIX formation.
Coagulation times entirely failed to correct upon injections 5–8.
Allergic reactions were also reflected in hematological parameters,
characterized by a transient (<1 hr) drop in platelet and white blood
cell (WBC) counts (Figures 5C and 5D).

Lettuce

S12, and S14) that received oral doses of lyophilized lettuce (mixed

FIX/kg) showed robust suppression of IgG2 formation and entirely
failed to form IgG1 or IgE (Figures 3C and 4C–4E). No anaphy-
lactic reactions were observed. In these animals, eight weekly i.v.
injections of FIX were given during weeks 4–11 of the oral toler-
ance regimen (Figure 3A). Importantly, because of a lack of anti-
FIX formation, coagulation times were corrected upon all eight
i.v. injections of FIX (Figures 5A and 5B). These orally tolerized
dogs had no detectable inhibitor throughout the experiment (P44
and S12) or showed a BU titer only at a single time point (S14; Fig-
ure 3E). A fourth dog (S15) fed with CTB-FIX responded only
partially to the oral tolerance protocol. Whereas IgG2 formation
was still substantially suppressed and no IgG1 was detected, an in-
hibitor still formed (Figures 3C and 3E) and coagulation times only
transiently corrected (Figures 5A and 5B). In addition, the dog
formed IgE and showed a transient decrease in platelet counts
and WBC after the sixth i.v. injection (Figures 5C and 5D). In
contrast to the other three orally treated dogs (P44, S12, and

 S14), this animal (S15) had a pre-existing antibody to human FIX
(Figure S1) of unknown origin (the animal had no prior exposure
to human FIX). However, even when this animal is factored in,
average IgG2 titers 1 week after the last FIX i.v. injection were
32 times lower in the four orally treated compared to the control
dogs that also received eight i.v. injections. When comparing the
four experimental with all four control dogs, IgG2 peak titers
were significantly lower for orally tolerized dogs (p < 0.05), even
though two of the control dogs received only four i.v. injections
(Figures 3B and 3C).
Lack of Toxicity following Oral Delivery of Bioencapsulated FIX
Consistent with our prior observations in hemophilic mice,
none of the dogs that were fed with bioencapsulated CTB-FIX
(0.3 mg/kg twice weekly for 3 months) formed antibodies against
FIX prior to challenge with i.v. FIX, and no allergic reactions
against the fed lettuce material were noted, indicating that oral
delivery is not immunogenic. All dogs maintained good general
health and normal eating habits and had no loss in weight (data
not shown). During the entire feeding period, values of different
liver enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and
gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), remained in the normal
range, indicating lack of liver toxicity after repeated administration
of CTB-FIX lettuce for 302 days (�10 months; Table 1). Long-
term (302 days) feeding of CTB-FIX lettuce did not impair the

renal function as creatinine (CREA) and
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were maintained
at normal levels. More intriguingly, consump-
tion of extra carbohydrates derived from
plant cells did not affect blood glucose levels
in dogs fed with CTB-FIX lettuce. Hemato-
logical parameters also remained normal in
CTB-FIX-fed dogs (Figures 5C–5F), except
for the animal that was not fully orally toler-
ized and thus developed allergic reactions to
i.v.-infused FIX. Finally, none of the CTB-
FIX-fed dogs developed circulating antibodies
against CTB (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrates successful induction of
oral tolerance, preventing pathogenic antibody
formation in protein-replacement therapy in a large, non-rodent an-
imal model of human disease. These results establish that both the
concept of oral tolerance for therapeutic protein antigens and the
approach of oral delivery of plant cells containing chloroplast-
made proteins are not limited to mice. More specifically, the data
support clinical development of oral administration of transplas-
tomic lettuce as a means of prevention of antibody formation and
anaphylaxis in patients with hemophilia.
Clinical Challenges for Tolerance Induction in Hemophilia
During FVIII replacement therapy, 20%–30% of severe hemo-
philia A patients develop inhibitors that severely complicate
therapy. These mostly form in <50 days of exposure. Titers
>5 BU/mL render FVIII administration completely ineffective
in improving coagulation. ITI protocols to eliminate inhibitors
are based on frequent high-dose FVIII injections, which usually
require implantation of a port to facilitate i.v. access. Elimi-
nation of the inhibitor by this method can take months to years,
cost >$1,000,000, and is not always effective, so that immune
suppression may be considered.4,28 Inhibitor formation against
FIX occurs less frequently (in 2%–5% of patients, with an
elevated risk for those with F9 gene deletions). However, ITI
often has to be stopped because of anaphylaxis or nephrotic
syndrome.3 Moreover, there are currently no prophylactic ITI
protocols to prevent ADA formation to FVIII or FIX. Such a
protocol would have to be acceptable in pediatric patients, with

 a favorable risk/benefit ratio, in part also because prediction of in-
hibitor formation for a specific patient is not yet very accurate. Use
of immune-suppressive drugs or genetic manipulations is therefore
viewed with caution. However, an oral tolerance based on delivery
of the antigen in an edible crop plant would be attractive. Multiple
clinical trials on oral tolerance induction in patients with autoim-
mune disease have largely failed to show efficacy despite excellent
preclinical data in mice.6 Autoimmune diseases are complex, often
involving multiple antigens and immune dysregulation. However,
other factors likely also contributed, such as insufficient protection
of the antigen from degradation and ineffective targeting to the gut
immune system.29
Assessing the Potential of Plant-Based Oral Tolerance for
Hemophilia in Different Species
Our new data on oral delivery of lettuce cells demonstrate effective-
ness in a non-rodent model of genetic disease. Success in two very
diverse species (mice and dogs) suggests that our approach is broadly
applicable. Ultimately, we envision that pediatric patients with
elevated risk for inhibitor formation to FIX (such as those with F9

 gene deletion) will be considered for a prophylactic oral immune
tolerance protocol. In mice, CTB-FIX made in lettuce was effective
over a broad dose range of 0.06–0.6 mg/kg.12 Because delivery to
the dogs was less controlled (compared to oral gavages in mice),
and because their diet is less plant based, we chose a dose
(0.3 mg/kg) closer to the highest tested dose in mice. Our prior studies
in mice indicate that tolerance is sustained for some time after oral
delivery is stopped, which remains to be studied in the canine
model.12,19 It would also be of interest to know whether the oral toler-
ance induction regimen and subsequent i.v. injections of FIX could be
done sequentially rather than overlapping. Thus far, our protocol
always included a period when antigen was administered both orally
(in form of bioencapsulated CTB fusion) and i.v. (in form of tradi-
tional recombinant factor). Mechanistic studies in mice showed
that this combination of oral and systemic administration of antigen
amplified immune regulatory responses and thus enhanced the toler-
ance response.20
Whereas hemophilia B mice and dogs showed similarities in their
responses to i.v. delivery of FIX, there were also differences. In
mice, inhibitors persisted after injections were stopped,19,20 whereas
in the dogs, inhibitor titers declined rapidly afterward. However,
IgG2 formation against FIX in dogs persisted for several weeks with
minimal decline and was highly reproducible, both with regard to
timing and titers. Also highly reproducible was the resulting lack of
correction of coagulation by the fourth to fifth injection. Inhibitor for-
mation was much more variable and did not correlate well with IgG2
titers. Interestingly, there was good correlation between the onset of
the inhibitor formation and of anaphylaxis or IgE formation. In he-
mophilia B mice, inhibitor formation was more suppressed than
IgG formation. Non-neutralizing antibodies persisted at considerable
titers, although these did not enhance clearance of FIX or interfere
with correction of coagulation.12 In contrast, we observed robust sup-
pression of binding antibodies in the canine model. Further studies
are needed to characterize the severe allergic reactions to FIX in
dogs and determine how they are similar or may differ from those
seen in inhibitor patients or in the murine model. For example, the
changes in hematological parameters are less typical in FIX inhibitor
patients. Both the dogs and mice form IgE, which is why we refer to
these as anaphylactic (as opposed to IgG-dependent “anaphylactoid”
reactions). Antihistamine was useful to counter the reactions, whereas
mice required antihistamine combined with anti-platelet activating
factor.19,30,31 Abrupt reductions in blood pressure immediately
following the i.v. administration of human FIX were consistent
with cardiovascular complications in the dogs and similar to human
anaphylactic reactions.
Oral tolerance was successful in three hemophilia B dogs. A fourth
dog showed only a partial response. Whereas there could be natural
variability in an outbred population, we noticed that this dog (in
contrast to the other three) had a relatively low-titer antibody that re-
acted to human FIX by ELISA prior to the onset of the study that may
have confounded the results. Because this dog (S15) had not been
exposed to this antigen before, the natural history of the antibody is
unknown. S15 only had two prior exposures during bleeding events
to normal canine plasma that contains �5 mg/mL of canine FIX
(spaced several months apart), making it unlikely, but not impossible,
that there was a cross-reacting antibody against canine FIX. However,
S12, S13, and S14 had higher exposure to normal canine plasma for
bleeding events and had no pre-existing antibody that bound human
FIX. Within this litter, S12 had the best response to oral tolerance in-
duction but also had the highest prior exposure to normal canine
plasma. One could therefore speculate that repeated treatment with
normal canine plasma actually reduced the response to FIX, even
when given in the context of a bleeding event. However, control
dog P05 had similar high and frequent exposure to normal canine
plasma for bleeding events and still formed a strong immune
response. Therefore, we conclude that modifying effects, derived
from genetic factors or exposure to normal canine plasma, have min-
imal impact. As discussed above, all control dogs, regardless of litter,
age, or gender, formed very similar levels of IgG2 against human FIX,
which was substantially suppressed in orally tolerized animals.
Interestingly, oral delivery of bioencapsulated CTB-FIX reversed
pre-existing inhibitors from >10 BU/mL to 1 or 2 BU/mL and
prevented anaphylactic reactions in hemophilia B mice (correlating
with a reversal of IgE formation) as long as oral delivery was
continued when i.v. replacement therapy resumed.20 Therefore, the
approach has the potential to reverse the pathogenic antibody
response to FIX. Future studies can address this question in the canine
model, including a potential requirement to adjust antigen doses or
frequency and duration of oral delivery when switching from a
preventive application to reversal. In other studies, we induced oral
tolerance to B-domain-deleted (BDD) FVIII.22 Whereas detailed
dose responses to oral CTB-FVIII are still forthcoming, initial data
suggest that the required antigen doses will likely be similar to those
for CTB-FIX.22 Ongoing work will determine whether a single BDD-
FVIII antigen can be produced at adequate levels or whether a
mixture of two transgenic lettuce plants (each expressing a portion
of FVIII as published) will be superior.22 Importantly, recent ad-
vances in chloroplast genomics and codon-optimization technology
results in substantially increased transgenic protein expression.13,18
In general, FVIII is considered more immunogenic than FIX. Future
translation work will show the extent to which the current oral toler-
ance approach reduces the risk and magnitude of inhibitor formation
in hemophilia A or whether adjunct therapeutic approaches may be
needed.
One potential concern with our protocol is use of CTB for repeated
antigen delivery. CTB is clinically approved as a component of
some oral vaccines, and oral delivery of a CTB fusion protein was suc-
cessfully tested for prevention of relapse of autoimmune uveitis in
patients with Behçet’s disease.32 Here, repeated oral administration
to dogs over several months did not cause detectible toxicities or
negatively affect the animals’ health. Equally important, CTB fusions
contained in plant cells fail to prime an antibody response against
FIX, which has now been shown for a large number of antigens.9,33
Given the large number of “foreign” antigens contained in food, the

 immune system of the gut has evolved a complex regulatory network
to maintain tolerance to dietary antigens while still providing mucosal
tolerance against pathogens.34 Recent studies have shown that regu-
latory T cells (T-reg) are a key component of this mechanism, of
which our approach takes advantage.20,35 Upon CTB-mediated bind-
ing to the GM1 receptor on the epithelium of the small intestine and
translocation from the gut lumen, the FIX antigen is released via pro-
teolytic cleavage and delivered to dendritic cells (DCs), including
CD103+ DCs that are critical for transport of antigen to the mesen-
teric lymph nodes and T-reg cell induction. Antigen presentation to
MHC-II-restricted CD4+ T cells results in induction of several subsets
of T-reg cells. CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T-reg cells and interleukin-10
(IL)-10-expressing LAP+CD4+CD25�FoxP3� T-reg cells systemi-
cally enforce suppression of antibody formation, which we found to
be antigen specific.20,36 Immunological reagents in the canine model
are limited (for example, an antibody to canine LAP is lacking).
Nonetheless, we measured frequencies of FoxP3+ T-reg cells in pe-
ripheral blood of those dogs that received eight i.v. FIX challenges.
Antigen-specific FoxP3+ T-reg cells suppress at low numbers so
that total FoxP3+ T-reg cell frequencies may not significantly change.
However, it is intriguing that, in one of the orally tolerized dogs (S12),
their frequency doubled over time during oral CTB-FIX delivery,
whereas it declined in one of the control dogs (P05; Figure S2).
Distinct Advantages of Producing Antigens in Chloroplasts
In this novel protein drug production and delivery concept using
transplastomic plants, genes encoding human blood proteins are
stably integrated into the chloroplast genome of edible plants.
When all copies of plastid genomes in each cell are modified, protein
drugs can be expressed at high levels.37,38 Lyophilized plant cells can
be stored for several months or years at room temperature without
protein drugs losing their efficacy.12,39,40 Low-cost, commercial-scale
production in a cGMP facility has also been recently achieved, facil-
itating further clinical development.12 Plant cells offer natural bio-
encapsulation through their cell wall. Thus, the expressed protein is
protected from stomach acids and digestive juices but is released in
the small intestine, following degradation by enzymes produced by
commensal bacteria. Although these basic concepts have been
demonstrated in mice or rats, this is the first demonstration of feasi-
bility of this concept in a non-rodent animal model, thereby
advancing this concept further toward human clinical studies. The
combination of bioencapsulation and efficient targeting reduces
required antigen doses and are unique features of this low-cost
drug delivery concept. This study shows that these features are similar
in dogs and most likely in the human system.
However, there are always lingering questions on long-term, repeti-
tive delivery of CTB fusion proteins. None of the dogs that were fed
with bioencapsulated CTB-FIX for 98 days or 176 days formed anti-
bodies against FIX prior to challenge with i.v. FIX, and no allergic re-
actions against the fed lettuce material were noted, indicating that oral
antigen delivery is not immunogenic. Good health and lack of liver or
kidney toxicity after prolonged (>300 days) and repetitive feeding was
observed. More importantly, consumption of additional carbohy-
drates derived from plant cells did not affect blood glucose levels in
dogs fed with CTB-FIX lettuce. These studies provide solid founda-
tion for advancing this approach toward human clinical studies.
Ability to store CTB-FIX for more than 30 months at ambient tem-
perature is a major breakthrough that addresses the relatively short
shelf life of many current protein drugs. This study further establishes
conditions to deliver effective doses of CTB-FIX to a large animal
model of hemophilia of similar size as pediatric patients that are likely
candidates for oral tolerance. Our ability to produce cGMP-grade ma-
terial in a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved facility
and recent approval of plant cells for production of protein drugs
similar to other cell culture systems argue well for further clinical
advancement of this technology.12,41
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Generation and Characterization of Lettuce-Cell-Derived CTB-
FIX Antigen
Transformation of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) cv. Simpson Elite chloro-
plasts, analysis of CTB-FIX transgene integration, and homoplasmic
transplastomic lines were performed as previously reported.12 To
generate a large scale of lettuce biomass with high concentration of
antigen, hundreds of CTB-FIX lettuce seeds were germinated on
MS medium for 3 weeks in the growth room. The 3-week-old seed-
lings were then transferred to the greenhouse and were grown up
to 4 months. Lettuce leaves were harvested every �3 weeks starting
from �2.5-month-old plants. Fresh lettuce leaves were stored
at �80�C for several weeks or months. Frozen leaves were then sub-
jected to lyophilization as previously described.12 The freeze-dried
leaves were ground into fine powder with coffee grinders at maximum
speed for three times (5 s pulse/90 s off, each time). The dry leaf pow-
der was packed in 500 mL moisture-free plastic bottles for shipping or
storage at room temperature. Production of CTB-FIX lettuce leaves in
Fraunhofer hydroponic system was carried out as described by Su
et al.12 Western blot analysis, GM1-ganglioside ELISA assay, and pro-
tein stability detection of the CTB-FIX fusion proteins in lyophilized
leaf samples were performed by following the protocols in previous
publications.12,19
Animals and Treatment Schedule
All procedures in dogs were approved by the University of North Car-
olina at Chapel Hill’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Outbred hemophilia B dogs (20–24 kg) of the UNC-Chapel Hill strain
were used. These dogs have a F9 missense mutation, resulting in a lack
of circulating antigen and severe hemophilia B.26,27 To induce oral
tolerance, lyophilized lettuce cells were mixed into dog chow and
fed twice per week for 13 weeks. Each dose was adjusted to deliver
CTB-FIX antigen at 0.3 mg/kg. Starting at 4 weeks into the experi-
ment, recombinant human FIX (Benefix; Pfizer) was given i.v. at
10 IU/kg (once per week for 8 weeks). The four dogs undergoing
oral tolerance studies were S12 (male; 2 years old), S14 and S15
(males; 15 months old), and P44 (male; 4 years old). Control dogs
received FIX i.v. but no oral antigen: P08 and P10 (females; 3 years
old) were injected weekly at 10 IU/kg for 4 weeks and S13 (male;

 15 months old) and P05 (male; 5 years old) were injected weekly at
10 IU/kg for 8 weeks. Finally, two additional dogs (O07 and O67;
female; 3 years old) received oral CTB-FIX antigen at 0.03–
0.12 mg/kg twice per week for �6 months.
Coagulation, Antibody, and Blood Chemistry Measurements
Coagulation times (whole blood clotting time [WBCT] and throm-
boelastography [TEG]) as well as inhibitory antibody/Bethesda
titers against human FIX were performed as published.42 Measure-
ment of FIX-specific IgG1 and IgG2 titers in sera or plasma by
ELISA were also as published.25 An analogous ELISA to measure
FIX-specific IgE in sera was established using reagents from Bethyl
Laboratories. Briefly, wells were coated with serially diluted canine
immunoglobulin containing known amounts of IgE to establish a
standard curve. Other wells were coated with human FIX and
then incubated with serum samples diluted 1:3. Horseradish perox-
idase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-dog IgE was used for detection.
Complete blood counts were performed on a SCIL VetABC cali-
brated for canine cells, and serum chemistries were performed by
Antech Diagnostics.
