Obesity, diabetes, and related manifestations are associated with an enhanced, but poorly
understood, risk for mucosal infection and systemic inflammation. Here, we show in mouse
models of obesity and diabetes that hyperglycemia drives intestinal barrier permeability,
through GLUT2-dependent transcriptional reprogramming of intestinal epithelial cells and
alteration of tight and adherence junction integrity. Consequently, hyperglycemia-mediated
barrier disruption leads to systemic influx of microbial products and enhanced dissemination
of enteric infection. Treatment of hyperglycemia, intestinal epithelial–specific GLUT2
deletion, or inhibition of glucose metabolism restores barrier function and bacterial
containment. In humans, systemic influx of intestinal microbiome products correlates with
individualized glycemic control, indicated by glycated hemoglobin levels.Together, our results
mechanistically link hyperglycemia and intestinal barrier function with systemic infectious
and inflammatory consequences of obesity and diabetes.
T
he obesity pandemic has reached alarming
magnitudes, affecting more than 2 billion
people worldwide and accounting for more
than 3 million deaths per year (1). A poorly
understood feature of the “metabolic syn-
drome” is its association with dysfunctions of the
intestinal barrier, leading to enhanced perme-
ability and translocation of microbial molecules
to the intestinal lamina propria and systemic cir-
culation (2). This influx of immune-stimulatory
microbial ligands into the vasculature, in turn,
has been suggested to underlie the chronic in-
flammatory processes that are frequently observed
in obesity and its complications (3), while entry of
pathogens and pathobionts through an impaired
barrier leads to an enhanced risk of infection in
obese and diabetic individuals (4, 5), particularly
at mucosal sites (6). However, the mechanistic
basis for barrier dysfunction accompanying the
metabolic syndrome remains poorly understood.
Beyond metabolic disease, enhanced intestinal
permeability has also been linked with systemic
inflammation in a variety of conditions, including
cancer (7), neurodegeneration (8), and aging (9).
Thus, there is an urgent scientific need to better
define the molecular and cellular orchestrators
and disruptors of intestinal barrier function, to
devise strategies to counteract the detrimental
systemic consequences of gut barrier alterations.
Obesity is associated with, but
not required for, intestinal
barrier dysfunction
We began our investigation of the drivers of
gastrointestinal barrier dysfunction in obesity
by hypothesizing that the adipokine leptin, a
major orchestrator of mammalian satiety, may
act as an obesity-associated regulator of barrier
integrity. Leptin deficiency and resistance to
leptin signaling are strongly associated with
morbid obesity in mice and humans, and both
leptin deficiency and resistance were previously
suggested to contribute to intestinal barrier dys-
function and susceptibility to enteric infection
(10–13). We used a mouse model featuring genetic
dysfunction of the leptin receptor (LepR), leading
to hyperphagia and morbid obesity (db/db, fig.
S1A). Indeed, we detected elevated amounts of
microbial pattern recognition receptor (PRR)
ligands at multiple systemic sites in leptin-
unresponsive db/db mice (Fig. 1, A to C), indic-
ative of enhanced influx of gut commensal-derived
products. A similar phenomenon was observed in
leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob, fig. S1, B and C). To
gain insight into the molecular signatures accom-
panying barrier dysfunction under aberrant leptin
signaling, we performed RNA sequencing of
colonic tissue, obtained from db/db mice and
their wild-type (WT) littermates under steady-
state conditions. Leptin unresponsiveness was
associated with global alterations of transcription
(fig. S1D), with several hundred genes featuring
differential expression between both groups (fig.
S1E). Among the genes whose expression was
most strongly abrogated in obese mice were
members of the tight and adherence junction
structures (fig. S1F), protein complexes that in-
hibit paracellular flux of intestinal molecules
into the lamina propria (14). Consequently, tight
junction integrity was compromised in db/db
mice (Fig. 1, D and E), leading to enhanced influx
of luminal molecules and electrical current mea-
sured across the epithelial layer (Fig. 1, F and G).
To determine the consequences of barrier dys-
function in leptin-resistant mice, we used the
murine Citrobacter rodentium model simulat-
ing human enteropathogenic Escherichia coli
infection (15). A bioluminescent variant of
C. rodentium allowed us to noninvasively track
infection in vivo (16). In WT mice, C. rodentium
caused a self-limiting, mainly gut-contained in-
fection (Fig. 1, H to L). In contrast, db/db mice
did not clear the pathogen from their intestine
(Fig. 1, H and I), in line with previous reports (12).
Notably, db/db mice also showed a significantly
enhanced bacterial attachment to the intestinal
wall (fig. S1, G and H) and featured C. rodentium
colonization at systemic sites (Fig. 1, J to L, and
fig. S1I). Similar susceptibility to C. rodentium
was noted for leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (fig.
S1, J to N).
To understand which cell type was responsible
for LepR-mediated protection from enteric infec-
tion, we generated bone marrow chimeras, in
which WT and db/db mice were used as either
recipients or donors of bone marrow trans-
planted into lethally irradiated mice. Exacerbated
infection and systemic spread of C. rodentium was
observed whenever the bone marrow recipient
was LepR-deficient, regardless of the source of
bone marrow (Fig. 1, M and N, and fig. S1O), in-
dicating that the nonhematopoietic compartment
mediated resistance against infection. LepR ex-
pression on nonhematopoietic cells has been re-
ported in multiple tissues, including the gut,
liver, and most prominently the nervous system
(17). Mice lacking LepR in intestinal epithelial
cells (Villin-Cre:LepRfl/fl) or hepatocytes (Albumin-
Cre:LepRfl/fl) did not show any signs of enhanced
susceptibility to C. rodentium infection (fig. S2, A
to F), whereas mice with LepR deficiency specif-
ically in the nervous system (Nestin-Cre:LepRfl/fl)
featured an exacerbated (fig. S2, G to I), yet highly
variable (fig. S2, J to O), bacterial growth. To fur-
ther explore the possibility of neuronal leptin sig-
naling driving barrier dysfunction and risk of
infection, we generated mice with a specific

 deletion of LepR in the paraventricular hypo-
thalamus (Sim1-Cre:LepRfl/fl), in the ventromedial
hypothalamus (SF1-Cre:LepRfl/fl), in cholinergic
neurons (ChAT-Cre:LepRfl/fl), and in the arcuate
nucleus of the hypothalamus (POMC-Cre:LepRfl/fl
and AgRP-Cre:LepRfl/fl) and infected them with
C. rodentium. However, none of these mice showed
enhanced susceptibility to pathogenic invasion
when compared to littermate controls (fig. S3, A
to O). Collectively, these results suggested that
leptin deficiency per se might not provide a suf-
ficient explanation to barrier dysfunction and
enhanced risk of enteric infection.
A feature common to all leptin- and LepR-
deficient mice exhibiting an impaired barrier
function and enhanced C. rodentium dissemi-
nation in our studies (db/db, ob/ob and Nestin-
Cre:LepRfl/fl) was their tendency to develop obesity.
We therefore hypothesized that an obesity-related
factor distinct from leptin signaling may pre-
dispose these mice to impaired barrier function
and exacerbated intestinal infection. Thus, to com-
plement the above genetic models of obesity, we
fed WT mice a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce
weight gain (fig. S4A). Similarly to obese leptin-
and LepR-deficient mice, HFD-fed obese mice
showed elevated steady-state systemic PRR lig-
and influx (Fig. 2A), as well as exacerbated
C. rodentium infection and systemic dissemina-
tion (Fig. 2, B to E, and fig. S4B). To further test
whether obesity is the major driver for barrier
dysfunction and impaired C. rodentium contain-
ment in LepR-deficient mice, we performed paired-
feeding experiments, in which the food access for
db/db mice was restricted to the amount con-
sumed by their WT littermates, thereby equaliz-
ing body weight between both groups (Fig. 2F).
Surprisingly, even after weight reduction to con-
trol levels, lean db/db mice were still unable to
cope with C. rodentium infection (Fig. 2, G and
H), ruling out that obesity per se was directly
driving barrier dysfunction and risk for enteric
infection in these mice. The lack of a direct causal
relationship between obesity and barrier dys-
function was further supported by experiments
using a chemical inhibitor of leptin signaling
(18), which rendered WT mice susceptible to
exacerbated infection and systemic bacterial
spread even before the onset of marked obesity
(Fig. 2, I to L, and fig. S4, C to F). Together, these
data indicated that neither leptin signaling nor
obesity per se sufficiently explain the severity of
barrier dysfunction and systemic enteric infec-
tion in mice with the metabolic syndrome.
In search of a unifying explanation for the
above results in multiple mouse models of ge-
netic and acquired obesity and leptin deficiency,
we investigated other common features of the
metabolic syndrome that could potentially contrib-
ute to barrier dysfunction. One such manifestation

 of the metabolic syndrome, typically accompany-
ing obesity and potentially contributing to barrier
dysfunction, is glucose intolerance and resultant
hyperglycemia. Notably, all mice featuring marked
susceptibility C. rodentium infection, including
obese db/db, pair-fed lean db/db mice, Nestin-Cre:
LepRfl/fl mice, mice fed a HFD, and mice treated
with leptin antagonist, showed elevated blood
glucose concentrations (Fig. 2, M to O, and fig. S4,
G and H). In contrast, all mouse groups and models
that did not develop enhanced C. rodentium sus-
ceptibility (Villin-Cre:LepRfl/fl, Albumin-Cre:
LepRfl/fl, Sim1-Cre:LepRfl/fl, SF1-Cre:LepRfl/fl, ChAT-
Cre:LepRfl/fl, POMC-Cre:LepRfl/fl, and AgRP-Cre:
LepRfl/fl, as well as those Nestin-Cre:LepRfl/fl mice
that did not feature a tendency for severe infec-
tion) collectively showed normoglycemic levels
(fig. S4, I and J). Together, these results suggested
that hyperglycemia, rather than obesity or altera-
tions in leptin signaling, may predispose to barrier
dysfunction leading to enhanced enteric infection
in the setup of the metabolic syndrome in mice.
Hyperglycemia drives intestinal
barrier disruption
To test whether elevated glucose concentrations
were causally involved in host defense against
intestinal infection, we induced hyperglycemia
in the absence of obesity in a mouse model of
type 1 diabetes mellitus through administration
of streptozotocin [STZ (19), fig. S5A]. Indeed,
STZ-treated mice developed severe C. rodentium
infection and systemictranslocation, accompanied
by enhanced bacterial growth, epithelial adherence,
and systemic spread (Fig. 3, A to E). STZ treatment
also resulted in dysfunction of intestinal epithelial
adherence junctions under steady-state conditions
(Fig. 3, F and G), coupled with systemic dissemina-
tion of microbial products (fig. S5, B and C), and
enhanced transepithelial flux (Fig. 3, H and I).
Oral antibiotic treatment prevented the detec-
tion of bacterial products at systemic sites in
STZ-treated mice (Fig. 3, J to L), demonstrating
that the intestinal microbiota was the probable
source of disseminated microbial molecules. In
contrast to the load of bacterial products at distal
organs (fig. S5D), the microbial load in the in-
testinal lumen was unaffected by hyperglycemia
(fig. S5E). We next sought to test the possibility
that barrier dysfunction in STZ-treated mice was
mediated by compositional microbiota alterations.
Indeed, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing
revealed a taxonomic change in the configuration
of the intestinal microbiota of hyperglycemic mice,
which was corrected by insulin treatment and
resultant normalization of serum glucose concen-
trations (fig. S6, A to D). However, these compo-
sitional microbial changes did not seem to play a
critical role in glucose-mediated barrier dysfunc-
tion, as microbiota transfer from STZ-treated

 donors and controls to normoglycemic germ-free
mice neither induced dissemination of bacterial
products to systemic sites (fig. S6E) nor increased
susceptibility to C. rodentium infection (fig. S6, F
to J). These data indicate that although the com-
mensal microbiota serves as the reservoir of micro-
bial molecules that translocate to the systemic
circulation upon disruption of the intestinal
barrier, compositional microbiota alterations
arising under hyperglycemic conditions do not
directly affect barrier integrity.
To corroborate the specificity of hyperglycemia
as a driver of susceptibility to intestinal infection,
we used hyperglycemic Akita mice (fig. S7A), an
STZ-independent model of type I diabetes mellitus
that harbors a spontaneous mutation in the gene
encoding insulin 2 (20). As in STZ-treated mice,
we observed in this model elevated C. rodentium
growth and pathogenic translocation to systemic
tissues (Fig. 3, M and N, and fig. S7, B and C). To
further validatethespecificimpactofhyperglycemia
as a driver of the barrier dysfunction phenotype,
we administered 0.25 U per day of insulin to STZ-
treated mice via hyperosmotic pumps for 4 weeks,
which restored normoglycemic levels (fig. S7D).
Treatment with insulin also prevented the loss of
adherence junction integrity (Fig. 4A and fig. S7E),
systemic dissemination of microbial products
(Fig. 4B), and enhanced C. rodentium growth and
pathogenic translocation (Fig. 4, C and D). Together,
these experiments establish hyperglycemia as a
direct and specific cause for intestinal barrier dys-
function and susceptibility to enteric infection.
Hyperglycemia reprograms intestinal
epithelial cells
To determine whether glucose acted directly on
intestinal epithelial cells to affect barrier func-
tion, we used an in vitro system of cultured intes-
tinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells exposed to different
concentrations of glucose in the culture medium.
We assessed tight junction integrity through
automatedhigh-throughputanalysisofZO-1stain-
ing patterns. Indeed, glucose induced barrier al-
terations in a dose- and time-dependent manner,
manifesting visually as increased tortuosity and
altered appearance of cell-cell junctions (Fig. 4, E
to H). To investigate the mechanisms by which
elevated blood glucose concentrations compro-
mise intestinal epithelial cell function in vivo,
weperformedRNAsequencingofpurifiedintestinal
epithelial cells from STZ-treated mice and con-
trols. Global reprogramming of the epithelial
transcriptome was detected inhyperglycemicmice
(Fig. 4I), in which more than 1000 genes were dif-
ferentially expressed compared to vehicle-treated
controls(Fig. 4J). These genes were predominantly
involved in metabolic pathways, and specifically in
N-glycan biosynthesis and pentose-glucuronate
interconversion (Fig. 4K), two intracellular func-
tions critically involved in the maintenance of
epithelial barrier function (21–29). For example,
hyperglycemia affected the entire pathway of pro-
tein N-glycosylation by provoking marked down-
regulation of central genes (Fig. 4L and fig. S8). In
contrast, epithelial proliferation or cell death were
not affected by STZ treatment (fig. S9, A to D).
In addition to the above epithelial changes,
hyperglycemia modestly affected the intestinal

 and splenic immune system, specifically by causing
an increased representation of myeloid cells (fig.
S10, A to J), in line with previous reports (30).
However, STZ treatment did not provoke an
overt inflammatory state in the intestine (fig.
S11, A to E). In particular, cytokines involved in
interleukin-22 (IL-22)–mediated barrier function
and host defense, which has been implicated in
the susceptibility of obese mice to infection (12),
were unaltered, as was the epithelial transcrip-
tional response to IL-22 (fig. S11F). Indeed, hy-
perglycemia and IL-22 appeared to have additive
effects in mediating host defense against
C. rodentium, because STZ-treated IL-22–deficient
mice featured accelerated bacterial growth and
mortality when compared to IL-22–deficient con-
trols (fig. S11, G and H). We further compared the
involvement of epithelial and immune cells in
host defense against another gastrointestinal
pathogen, Salmonella Typhimurium. STZ-treated
mice orally infected with Salmonella showed en-
hanced systemic colonization, whereas intestinal
luminal growth was comparable to that of vehicle-
treated controls (fig. S12, A to E). In contrast to
this marked susceptibility of STZ-treated mice to
oral Salmonella Typhimurium infection, suscep-
tibility of these mice to systemic infection was
only apparent in the liver (fig. S12, F to H). Notably,
systemic infection with Salmonella caused en-
hanced intestinal colonization in STZ-treated
mice, potentially indicative of retrograde spread
of bacteria across a compromised barrier (fig.
S12, I and J).
Epithelial reprogramming by
hyperglycemia involves glucose
metabolism and GLUT2
We next assessed whether epithelial glucose me-
tabolism was involved in the transcriptional
reprogramming of STZ-treated mice. Isolated in-
testinal epithelial cells from hyperglycemic mice
featured elevated amounts of metabolites along
the glycolytic cascade (fig. S13A). Inhibition of
glucose metabolism via 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)
rescued glucose-induced barrier aberrations in
vitro in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5, A to
C). In addition, 2-DG administration blocked
transcriptional reprogramming in STZ-treated
mice (Fig. 5D and fig. S13B), including the N-
glycan pathway (fig. S13C); prevented the sys-
temic dissemination of microbial products (Fig.
5, E and F); and restored host defense against
C. rodentium (Fig. 5G and fig. S13, D to F). Bacterial
growth in the intestinal lumen was unaffected by
2-DG treatment (fig. S13G). To test whether 2-DG
could be used to counteract hyperglycemia-
mediated loss of barrier integrity beyond the STZ
model, we administered 2-DG to C. rodentium-
infected db/db mice and assessed its impact on
systemic dissemination of the pathogen. Notably,
the detectable pathogen load in the mesenteric
lymph nodes, spleens, and livers of 2-DG–treated
db/db mice was strongly reduced under 2-DG
treatment (Fig. 5H and fig. S13, H and I). To-
gether, these data suggest that glucose-mediated
reprogramming of epithelial cell metabolic func-
tion leads to transcriptional alterations, abroga-
tion of the intestinal barrier, and impaired host
defense against enteric infection.

 Glucose transport between the intestinal
epithelium and circulation is mediated by the
bidirectional glucose transporter GLUT2 (31).
To determine the role of this transporter in
hyperglycemia-mediatedepithelialreprogramming,
we next used mice selectively lacking GLUT2 in
intestinal epithelial cells (GLUT2DIEC) (32) and
induced hyperglycemia in these mice by STZ
administration. Indeed, GLUT2DIEC mice were
resistant to STZ-induced transcriptional repro-
gramming and retained epithelial transcriptomes
similar to those of controls (fig. S14, A and B).
GLUT2DIEC mice also retained intact tight and
adherence junction complexes (Fig. 5, I and J,
and fig. S14, C and D), reduced transepithelial
flux (fig. S14E), and intestinal containment of
microbial PRR ligands (Fig. 5K), despite sustained
STZ-induced hyperglycemia (fig. S14F). Ablation
of GLUT2 also ameliorated the STZ-induced sus-
ceptibility to C. rodentium growth and systemic
dissemination (Fig. 5 L, and fig. S14, G to I). Col-
lectively, these results indicate that GLUT2 is in-
volved in the hyperglycemia-induced metabolic
and transcriptional alterations in intestinal epi-
thelial cells, resulting in barrier dysfunction and
microbial translocation to the systemic circulation.
Blood glucose concentrations are
associated with microbial product influx
in humans
Finally, we sought to determine whether glyce-
mic levels similarly correlate with intestinal bar-
rier function in humans. To this end, we recruited
27 healthy individuals (fig. S15, A and B) and
performed measurements of multiple serum pa-
rameters and microbial products in the circula-
tion. Of all variables measured, hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c), indicative of an individual’s 3-month
average plasma glucose concentration, showed
the strongest correlation with serum levels of
PRR ligands (Fig. 6, A to C, and fig. S15, C to E).
In contrast, high body mass index and other
hallmarks of metabolic disease did not signif-
icantly associate with the influx of microbial
products (Fig. 6, A and B, and fig. S15F). Total stool
bacterial content did not correlate with HbA1c
levels (fig. S15G). Together, these data suggest that
similar to their effects in mice, serum glucose
concentrations, rather than obesity, may associ-
ate with or potentially even drive intestinal bar-
rier dysfunction in humans.
Discussion
Serum glucose is among the most strictly con-
trolled physiological variables of organismal
homeostasis. Chronically elevated glucose concen-
trations, as observed in diabetes mellitus, obesity,
and associated metabolic disorders, such as non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease, result from altered
homeostatic set points of the tightly regulated
normoglycemic levels (33). Long-standing hyper-
glycemia, in turn, leads to a myriad of potentially
devastating biochemical and physiological conse-
quences, such as the generation of advanced
glycation end products, pancreatic glucose toxic-
ity (34, 35), macrovascular and microvascular
complications affecting virtually every organ (36),
risk of infection (37), and enhanced mortality (38).
In this study, we have identified glucose as an
orchestrator of intestinal barrier function. Hyper-
glycemia markedly interfered with homeostatic
epithelial integrity, leading to abnormal influx of

 immune-stimulatory microbial products and a
propensity for systemic spread of enteric patho-
gens. Our results indicate that hyperglycemia
causes retrograde transport of glucose into in-
testinal epithelial cells via GLUT2, followed by
alterations in intracellular glucose metabolism
and transcriptional reprogramming (fig. S16).
One of the most strongly affected pathways by
hyperglycemia in our study involves the N-
glycosylation of proteins in the endoplasmic re-
ticulum and Golgi apparatus, which has been
implicated as a key regulator of a multitude of
epithelial functions (25). Although our study
focused on the impact of systemic glucose con-
centrations on the intestinal barrier, similar ef-
fects might be caused by a high-glucose diet,
which may affect intestinal epithelial cells in a
similar manner, potentially resulting in diet-
induced alterations of barrier function. Such
potential physiologically important dietary effects
on barrier function merit further studies. Further-
more, the impact of hyperglycemia on epithelial
barrier function might be relevant beyond the
gastrointestinal tract and affect other mucosal
surfaces, such as the respiratory tract, as was
indicated by a recent study of close to 70,000
diabetes patients highlighting a positive corre-
lation between HbA1c values and a variety of
mucosal community- and hospital-acquired in-
fections (39).
Collectively, our findings provide a potential
molecular explanation for altered barrier func-
tion in the context of the metabolic syndrome
and the resultant enhanced mucosal infection
noted in patients suffering from obesity (5) and
diabetes mellitus (40). Furthermore, the link that
we highlight between hyperglycemia and gut bar-
rier alterations may provide a mechanistic basis
for a variety of seemingly unrelated inflammatory
manifestations, complications, and associations
of the metabolic syndrome—collectively termed
“metaflammation” or “para-inflammation” (41, 42).
Examples of these include adipose tissue inflam-
mation driving exacerbated obesity and glucose
intolerance (43), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
progressing to detrimental nonalcoholic steato-
hepatitis (44), inflammation contributing to ath-
erosclerosis and associated cardiovascular disease
(45), and even recently suggested associations
between the metabolic syndrome and neuro-
degeneration (46). Ultimately, our results may
present the starting point for harnessing glucose
metabolism or other regulators of intestinal bar-
rier integrity as potential therapeutic targets in
the prevention and amelioration of enteric in-
fection and gut-related systemic inflammation.
