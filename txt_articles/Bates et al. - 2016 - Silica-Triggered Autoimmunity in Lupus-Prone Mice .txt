Abstract
Occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica (cSiO2, quartz) is etiologically linked
to systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) and other human autoimmune diseases (ADs).
In the female NZBWF1 mouse, a widely used animal model that is genetically prone to
lupus, short-term repeated intranasal exposure to cSiO2 triggers premature initiation of
autoimmune responses in the lungs and kidneys. In contrast to cSiO2’s triggering action,
consumption of the ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) prevents
spontaneous onset of autoimmunity in this mouse strain. The aim of this study was to test
the hypothesis that consumption of DHA will prevent cSiO2-triggered autoimmunity in the
female NZBWF1 mouse. Mice (6 wk old) were fed isocaloric AIN-93G diets containing 0.0,
0.4, 1.2 or 2.4% DHA. Two wk after initiating feeding, mice were intranasally instilled with
1 mg cSiO2 once per wk for 4 wk and maintained on experimental diets for an additional
12 wk. Mice were then sacrificed and the lung, blood and kidney assessed for markers of
inflammation and autoimmunity. DHA was incorporated into lung, red blood cells and kidney
from diet in a concentration-dependent fashion. Dietary DHA dose-dependently suppressed
cSiO2-triggered perivascular leukocyte infiltration and ectopic lymphoid tissue neogenesis
in the lung. DHA consumption concurrently inhibited cSiO2–driven elevation of proinflam-
matory cytokines, B-cell proliferation factors, IgG and anti-dsDNA Ig in both bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid and plasma. DHA’s prophylactic effects were further mirrored in reduced pro-
teinuria and glomerulonephritis in cSiO2-treated mice. Taken together, these results reveal
that DHA consumption suppresses cSiO2 triggering of autoimmunity in female NZBWF1
mice as manifested in the lung, blood and kidney. Our findings provide novel insight into
how dietary modulation of the lipidome might be used to prevent or delay triggering of AD by

 cSiO2. Such knowledge opens the possibility of developing practical, low-cost preventative
strategies to reduce the risk of initiating AD and subsequent flaring in cSiO2-exposed indi-
viduals. Additional research in this model is required to establish the mechanisms by which
DHA suppresses cSiO2-induced autoimmunity and to ascertain unique lipidome signatures
predictive of susceptibility to cSiO2-triggered AD.
Background
Autoimmune diseases (ADs) affect 24 million individuals in the U.S., inflicting tremendous
individual suffering and societal costs [1]. The genome is universally recognized to be a pri-
mary predisposing factor for AD; however, the exposome, an individual’s lifetime environmen-
tal exposures, is a contributor of considerable and underappreciated importance. One
component of the exposome likely to be critical to AD onset and progression is exposure to
respirable particles such as crystalline silica (cSiO2, quartz) [2]. An estimated 2.3 million Amer-
icans employed in construction, manufacturing, mining, hydraulic fracturing, farming and cus-
todial service are exposed to high concentrations of cSiO2 [3]. These individuals are at
increased risk of developing ADs that include systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), rheuma-
toid arthritis, scleroderma and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis [4–7].
Lupus, a prototypical AD, is characterized by loss of tolerance to self-antigens, activation of
autoreactive B and T cells and consequential production of pathogenic autoantibodies [8].
These antibodies complex with self-antigens (e.g. nuclear components, including dsDNA) and
deposit in tissues facilitating mononuclear cell infiltration. In the kidney, these events drive
onset and progression of glomerulonephritis—a burdensome and potentially fatal complica-
tion of lupus. Mouse strains that spontaneously develop lupus have been widely employed to
understand how toxic stressors impact AD pathogenesis [9]. One example is the NZM2410
mouse, which develops lupus nephritis early in life causing them to succumb by 25 wk of age
[10]. Intranasal cSiO2 instillation of NZM2410 accelerates the onset of lupus-related responses
comprising of elevated autoreactive antibodies, proteinuria, and glomerulonephritis [11–14].
Accordingly, both experimental animal and human epidemiological studies suggest that cSiO2
could be a significant environmental trigger for lupus and potentially other ADs.
The female New Zealand Black White (F1) mouse (NZBWF1), another widely used murine
model of human lupus [9], spontaneously shows autoantibody production early in life.
Glomerulonephritis onset is observed at approximately 34 wk of age, resulting in very high
mortality by 12 months of age. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that weekly intranasal
exposure to cSiO2 for 4 wk beginning at 9 wk of age of NZBWF1 mice dramatically shortened
glomerulonephritis onset time to 22 wk of age [15]. Concurrently, cSiO2 elicited intense
inflammatory responses in the lungs as evidenced by robust perivascular and peribronchial
lymphocytic cell infiltration. These immune cells consisted of large numbers of B (CD45R+)
cells, T (CD3+) cells and IgG-secreting plasma cells indicative of ectopic lymphoid tissue (ELT)
neogenesis. Consistent with pulmonary inflammation and ELT development, bronchiolar
lavage fluid (BALF) from cSiO2-exposed mice displayed elevated concentrations of IgG and the
cytokines MCP-1, TNF-α and IL-6. cSiO2 exposure also evoked increases in plasma autoanti-
bodies and proinflammatory cytokines. The discovery that cSiO2-induced inflammation and
ELT neogenesis within the pulmonary compartment of NZBWF1 mice occurs in parallel with
systemic inflammatory and autoimmune responses strongly suggests the lung functions as a
platform for AD triggering by this respirable particle.
Another component of an individual’s exposome that potentially influences susceptibility to
autoimmunity is diet [16]. Fat is a macronutrient that prominently influences immune

 function, with dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) being of particular relevance [17].
PUFA that contain more than one double bond in their backbone are classified as ω-3 or ω-6
according to the position of the first double bond relative to the terminal carbon in the aliphatic
chain. Generally, ω-6 PUFA are regarded as proinflammatory in nature, whereas ω-3 PUFA
such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are recognized to be
anti-inflammatory. Linoleic acid (C18:2 ω-6; LA), the major PUFA found in food oils derived
from plants (e.g. corn and soybean), is the primary PUFA found in Western diets. Following
consumption by humans, LA is enzymatically elongated and desaturated to arachidonic acid
(C20:4 ω-6; ARA). Both LA and ARA become major components of cell membranes through-
out the body. Although the ω-3 PUFA α-linolenic acid (C18:3 ω-3; ALA) is also found in plant
oils, humans and other mammals have limited capacity to elongate it to eicosapentaenoic acid
(C20:5 ω-3; EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 ω-3; DHA) and afterwards incorporate these
metabolites into cell membranes [18]. Thus, humans require exogenous sources for ω-3 PUFA
other than plants or terrestrial animals. Certain marine microalgae efficiently catalyze the for-
mation of EPA and DHA and cold-water fish consuming such algae readily bioconcentrate
these ω-3 PUFA into their tissue [19]. Consequently, fish, fish oil and, more recently, microal-
gal oil are important sources of EPA and DHA for humans [20]. Animal and clinical studies
over the past 30 years indicate that ingestion of ω-3 PUFA both prevents and resolves inflam-
mation and, hence, might help those individuals who have a genetic predisposition to AD [21].
With the exception of multivitamins, ω-3 PUFA are the most widely used nutritional supple-
ment [22, 23]. An estimated 30 million American adults regularly consume ω-3 PUFA suggest-
ing both wide usage and consumer acceptance; however, the impact of dose on potential health
effects remains unclear.
In a prior study, we compared latency and severity of autoimmunity in NZBWF1 mice con-
suming 1) an ω-3 PUFA- diet containing DHA-enriched fish oil, 2) an ω-6 PUFA-rich West-
ern-type diet containing corn oil or 3) an ω-9 monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich
Mediterranean-type diet containing high oleic safflower oil [24]. Spontaneous elevations of
plasma autoantibodies, proteinuria and glomerulonephritis occurred in mice at 34 wk of age
fed ω-6 PUFA or ω-9 MUFA diets; however, these endpoints were dramatically diminished or
even blocked in mice fed the DHA-rich diet. Inhibition of autoimmunity in ω-3 PUFA-fed
NZBWF1 mice was associated with generalized downregulation of genes in both the kidney
and spleen that contribute to inflammatory responses, antigen presentation, T cell activation, B
cell activation/differentiation and leukocyte recruitment. Notably, many of these genes are cur-
rently under consideration as biomarkers and/or biotherapeutic targets for lupus.
Nothing is known about the interactive effects cSiO2 exposure and ω-3 consumption on the
development of AD. To address this knowledge gap, we tested the hypothesis that consumption
of DHA-rich microalgal oil will prevent cSiO2-triggered autoimmunity in the female NZBWF1
mouse. The results show that DHA supplementation dose-dependently suppressed most indi-
cators of cSiO2-accelerated autoimmune pathogenesis in lung, blood and kidney in this lupus-
prone mouse model.
Materials and Methods
Animals and diets
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Michigan State University reviewed and
approved all animal procedures in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines
(AUF# 01/12-002-00). Female 6 wk old NZBWF1 and control NZW/LacJ mice were obtained
from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Upon arrival, mice were randomized into experi-
mental groups. They were then housed four per cage with free access to food and water.

 Animals were maintained at constant temperature and humidity (21°C–24°C and 40–55%,
respectively) under a 12 h light/dark cycle.
Formulations of experimental diets are summarized in Table 1. Briefly, modified American
Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-93G diet containing 70 g/kg fat was prepared as described previously
[24, 25]. All diets contained 10 g/kg food-grade corn oil to provide basal essential fatty acids.
Control diet (CON) was formulated with 60 g/kg food-grade high-oleic safflower oil (Hain Pure
Foods, Boulder, CO). High-oleic safflower oil was replaced with 10, 30, or 60 g/kg microalgal oil
containing 40% DHA (DHASCOTM, provided by Dr. Kevin Hadley, Martek Biosciences Corpo-
ration Columbia, MD) yielding experimental diets that corresponded to 0.4, 1.2, or 2.4% (w/w)
DHA, respectively. Based on energy percentages, these concentrations are estimated to mimic
human consumption of 2, 6, and 12 g/d of DHA, respectively. Fatty acid compositions based on
total lipids in each diet were analyzed as described below and are summarized in Table 2.
Experimental design
Overall study design is depicted in Fig 1. Upon arrival, NZBWF1 mice (6 wk old) were fed
CON diet or 0.4, 1.2, or 2.4% DHA-containing diets and maintained on assigned diet until
experiment termination. To limit formation of lipid oxidation products, diets were prepared
biweekly, stored at -20°C until use, and provided fresh to mice every other day. Beginning at 8
wk of age, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and intranasally instilled with 1.0 mg
cSiO2 (Min-U-Sil-5, 1.5–2.0 μm average particle size, Pennsylvania Sand Glass Corporation,
Pittsburgh, PA) in 25 μl PBS or PBS vehicle (VEH) once per wk for 4 wk [15]. The total dose of
cSiO2 (4 mg) in mice approximates one half of a human lifetime exposure at the recommended
occupational health guideline established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administra-
tion [3]. Urine was collected weekly and evaluated for protein using reagent dipsticks (Cortez
Diagnostics, Inc., Calabasas, CA). Mice were euthanized and tissues collected 12 wk after the

 develop lupus [10, 26],. Age-matched female NZW/LacJ mice were fed either CON or 2.4%
DHA-enriched AIN-93G for 2 wk prior to vehicle or cSiO2 exposure and then maintained on
experimental diets as described above.
Necropsy and tissue collection
Mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection with 56 mg/kg BW sodium pentobarbital.
Blood was collected from the abdominal aorta using heparinized syringes and centrifuged at
3500 x g for 10 min at 4°C. Resultant plasma was stored at -80°C. Red blood cell pellets were
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for fatty acid analysis. Bronchoalveo-
lar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from whole lungs as described previously [27]. After
lavage, the right lung lobes were removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C for
fatty acid analysis. The left lung lobe was fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher Sci-
entific, Pittsburgh, PA) at constant pressure (30 cm H2O) for minimum of 1 h and stored in
fixative until further processing for histology. The right kidney was excised and the cranial por-
tion fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 24 h. The left kidney was removed and stored at
-80°C for fatty acid analysis.
Fatty acid analyses
Fatty acid concentrations of diets were determined using a modification of a direct transesteri-
fication method [28] as reported previously [29]. Total lipids were extracted from lung and kid-
ney tissue according to the method of Bligh and Dyer [30] using a mixture of methanol:
chloroform:water (2:2:1.8, by vol). Red blood cells were isolated and purified from whole blood
according to Burton and coworkers [31] and lipids extracted as described for lung and kidney.
Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) were prepared from lipid extracts using KOH solution and
boron trifluoride in methanol [32]. Gas liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis of FAME
extracts were performed on a GC-2010 gas chromatograph (Shimadzu) equipped with a flame
ionization detector using a CP-Sil 88 capillary column (100m × 0.25mm I.D. × 0.25 μm film
thickness, Varian). Gas chromatographic conditions were as detailed previously [29]. Individ-
ual FAME were identified by comparison of retention times with known FAME standards
(GLC reference standard 63-A and GLC reference standard 455 from Nu-Chek Prep Inc.).
Fatty acid results are expressed as percentages (w/w) of fatty acids detected with a chain length
between 10 and 24 carbon atoms. The lower limit of detection was <0.001 g/100 g fatty acids.
Kidney histopathology
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded kidneys were sectioned to 5 μm and stained with either
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Periodic Acid Schiff and hematoxylin (PASH). Slide sections
were individually graded by a board-certified veterinary pathologist graded using a modified
International Society of Nephrology-Renal Pathology Society Lupus Nephritis Classification
[33] as follows: (0) no tubular proteinosis and normal glomeruli; (1) mild tubular proteinosis
with multifocal segmental proliferative glomerulonephritis and occasional early glomerular
sclerosis and crescent formation; (2) moderate tubular proteinosis with diffuse segmental pro-
liferative glomerulonephritis, early glomerular sclerosis and crescent formation; and (3)
marked tubular proteinosis with diffuse global proliferative and sclerosing glomerulonephritis.
Lung histopathology
The formalin-fixed inflated left lung lobe was cut in randomly oriented 2 mm thick serial sec-
tions. All sections (4–6 per left lung lobe) were embedded in paraffin for histopathological and

 morphometric analysis. Tissue sections (5 μm) were routinely stained with H&E for cellular
morphometry and histopathology. Sections were semi-quantitatively scored by a board-certi-
fied veterinary pathologist for the following lung lesions: (a) presence of lymphocytic cell infil-
tration within perivascular and peribronchial regions, (b) alveolitis defined as the presence of
alveolar infiltration of vacuolated macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, granuloma for-
mation in the alveolus, type II epithelial cell hyperplasia, and thickened alveolar wall, and (c)
presence of alveolar proteinosis. Individual lungs were graded for these lesions using the fol-
lowing criteria (% of total pulmonary tissue examined): (0) no changes compared to control
mice; (1) minimal (<10%); (2) slight (10–25%); (3) moderate (26–50%); (4) severe (51–75%);
or (5) very severe (>75%) of total area affected.
Lung immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded lung sections for
identification of B and T lymphocytes in lung parenchyma. Briefly, B and T cells were identi-
fied using rat monoclonal anti-mouse CD45R (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) (1:300) and rab-
bit polyclonal anti-mouse CD3 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) (1:100), respectively. Deparaffinized
tissue sections (4 μm) were first subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval with citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) at 100°C for 30 min (CD45R) or 125°C for 15 min (CD3). Following pretreatments to
block non-specific binding and endogenous biotin, primary antibody staining was performed.
Bound CD45R and CD3 antibodies were detected by incubation with biotinylated secondary
antibodies followed by Peroxidase Reagent and Nova Red substrate (Vector Laboratories, Inc.,
Burlingame, CA) prior to being counterstained with hematoxylin.
Lung morphometry for B and T cells
To quantify B and T cell infiltration, slides stained with antibodies to CD45R and CD3, respec-
tively, were scanned and digitized with a VS110 (Olympus, Hicksville, NY) virtual slide system.
The lung tissues on scanned slides were selected as region of interest and 10% of the lung sec-
tion was captured at 20X magnification by systematic random sampling with NewCast soft-
ware (Visiopharm, Hoersholm, Denmark). The volume density of CD45R+ or CD3+ cells in
the bronchial and perivascular regions of the lungs was estimated by projecting a point grid
over the randomly sampled images with the STEPanizer 1.8 Stereology Tool (http://www.
stepanizer.com/)[34]. The numbers of points hitting the CD45R+ or CD3+ cells as well as the
whole lung tissues (i.e. lung parenchyma and interstitium) were counted. Finally, the volume
density or percentage of CD45R+ and CD3+ per reference area was calculated.
BALF cell quantitation and identification
Total cell numbers in BALF were determined by counting intact cells using a hemocytometer
without Trypan Blue exclusion. Cytological slides from BALF were prepared by centrifugation
at 400 x g for 10 min using a Shandon Cytospin 3 (Shandon Scientific, PA), allowed to air dry,
and stained with Diff-Quick (Fisher Scientific). Remaining BALF was centrifuged at 2400 x g
for 15 min and supernatant collected and stored at -80°C. Differential cell counts for macro-
phages/monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils in BALF were determined using
morphological criteria from 200 total cells on cytological slides.
IgG and autoantibody measurement
Total IgG in BALF and plasma was determined by ELISA [35]. Briefly, 96-well plates were
coated with 50 μL per well of 5 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG (γ-chain specific, Alpha Diagnostics,

 Inc., cat # 40120) in carbonate coating buffer. Afterwards, BALF and plasma samples as well as
standards were loaded on the plate, followed by another incubation step with horseradish per-
oxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (γ-chain specific) (Alpha Diagnostics, Inc., cat # 40121).
The standard curve was generated with mouse reference serum (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.,
Montgomery, TX). Plates were read on an ELISA reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA)
and IgG calculated from the standard curve using Softmax software (Molecular Devices). To
quantify anti-dsDNA Ig [36], 96-well plates were coated with 5 μg/ml dsDNA purified from
calf thymus (Alpha Diagnostics, Inc. cat # DNAD25-N-1) in borate buffered saline. BALF,
plasma samples or standards (mouse anti-dsDNA, Abcam clone HYB331/01) were loaded on
the plate. Bound antibody was measured using horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse
IgG (Fab2-specific) (Cappel Labs, cat # 3211021). Since this detector antibody reacts with all
immunoglobulin classes (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgD and IgE), data were reported as anti-dsDNA Ig
(ng/ml). Anti-dsDNA Ig in samples was determined from standard curve.
Cytokine analyses
BALF supernatant and plasma were analyzed for the proinflammatory cytokines MCP-1, TNF-
α, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12p70, and IL-17a by flow cytometric bead array using Flex Set
reagents (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Sample data were acquired using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences) and cytokine concentrations were calculated from standard curves
using FCAP Array Software (BD Biosciences). In addition to the Flex Set array, B cell stimulat-
ing cytokines in BALF supernatant and plasma were quantitated using mouse B-cell Activating
Factor (BAFF) and Osteopontin DuoSets (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to man-
ufacturer’s instructions.
Statistics
All treatments consisted of 8 mice per group and data presented as �
x ± SEM. A p value
of < 0.05 was considered statistically different for all study outcomes. Grubb’s outlier test was
performed and any identified outliers were excluded from statistical analysis. Data were ana-
lyzed using SigmaPlot 11.0 for Windows (Jandel Scientific; San Rafael, CA). Student’s t test was
used to determine differences in CON-fed mice instilled with VEH or cSiO2. The effects of con-
suming DHA diets on cSiO2-triggered responses were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. If the assumption of normality
or equal variance failed, Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA on Ranks followed by Dunn’s test
was used. The Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient was used to correlate DHA concen-
trations in diet to experimental endpoints in cSiO2-exposed NZBWF1 mice. Comparisons
between VEH-exposed NZW/LacJ mice and cSiO2-exposed counterparts fed CON or DHA-
enriched diets were conducted using Student’s t-test. If the assumption of normality or equal
variance failed, differences were analyzed by Mann Whitney Rank Sum test.
Results
Consumption of DHA-rich microalgal oil dose-dependently increases
tissue DHA
Substitution of high oleic safflower oil in AIN-93G diets with increasing amounts of DHA oil
(Tables 1 and 2) dose-dependently increased DHA content of lung (Fig 2A; S1 Table), red
blood cells (Fig 2B; S2 Table) and kidney (Fig 2C; S3 Table) in NZBWF1 mice 12 wk after the
last cSiO2 instillation. These effects co-occurred with reductions of the ω-6 PUFA ARA, sug-
gesting that DHA effectively replaced ARA from cell membrane phospholipids in these three

 tissues. There was very little EPA detected in the tissues indicating that there was no retrocon-
version of DHA. Finally, cSiO2 exposure did not significantly affect DHA content in tissues of
CON-fed mice.
DHA consumption suppresses cSiO2-triggered proteinuria and lupus
nephritis
Consistent with our prior findings [15], short-term repeated intranasal exposure to cSiO2 trig-
gered the premature onset of proteinuria in CON-fed NZBWF1 mice as compared to VEH-
instilled CON-fed mice (Fig 3). Proteinuria in cSiO2-exposed animals was apparent beginning
at 10 wk post-instillation (PI) with 38% of this group responding by 12 wk PI. In contrast,
cSiO2-exposed NZBWF1 mice fed 0.4% DHA showed delayed proteinuria onset, first detect-
able 11 wk PI; by 12 wk PI, 25% of this group was affected. None of the cSiO2-exposed

 NZBWF1 mice fed either 1.2% or 2.4% DHA exhibited proteinuria upon termination at 12 wk
PI. Proteinuria was not evident at 12 wk PI in VEH- or cSiO2-instilled NZW/LacJ mice, which
were controls without genetic susceptibility to autoimmunity.
DHA’s preventative effects on cSiO2-triggered renal injury in NZBW1 mice were confirmed
histologically. CON-fed mice instilled with cSiO2 exhibited moderate to severe diffuse glomer-
ular hypercellularity, mesangial matrix expansion, lymphocytic infiltration, and tubular protei-
nosis characteristic of glomerulonephritis as compared to CON diet-fed mice instilled with
VEH (Fig 4A and 4B). In contrast, NZBWF1 mice fed diets containing 2.4% DHA exhibited
marked reduction of such lesions (Fig 4C). Individual NZBWF1 mice were graded for severity
of lupus nephritis (Fig 5). CON-fed mice that received cSiO2 showed significantly higher lupus
nephritis scores than CON-fed mice instilled with VEH. In contrast, consumption of diets con-
taining 1.2 or 2.4% DHA markedly reduced severity of cSiO2-induced nephritis. Consumption
of diets containing 0.4% DHA did not affect cSiO2-induced nephritis. Hence, DHA consump-
tion suppressed cSiO2-triggered kidney injury in the female NZBWF1 mouse.
cSiO2 instillation also induced renal lesions indicative of mild nephritis in NZW/LacJ con-
trol mice PI (Figs 4E and 5). These results indicate that intranasal exposure to cSiO2 per se
might be sufficient to induce nephritis even in the absence of strong genetic predisposition to
autoimmunity. Consistent with effects of DHA observed in cSiO2-exposed NZBWF1 mice,
supplementation with 2.4% DHA appeared to reduce the severity of kidney lesions in NZW/
LacJ mice exposed to cSiO2 (Figs 4F and 5).
DHA consumption abrogates cSiO2-induced inflammatory cell response
in lungs
CON-fed NZBWF1 mice instilled with cSiO2 exhibited extensive inflammation in the lungs
consisting of significant perivascular and peribronchiolar mononuclear cell infiltration com-
pared to those instilled with VEH (Fig 6A and 6B). While diet supplemented with 0.4% DHA
modestly reduced perivascular mononuclear infiltration, consumption of the 1.2 and 2.4%
DHA diets dramatically suppressed cSiO2 induced mononuclear cell infiltration (Fig 6C).
NZW/LacJ mice fed CON diet and intranasally instilled with cSiO2 also developed pulmonary
mononuclear cell infiltration (Fig 6D and 6E), but this response was much less severe than in
NZBWF1 mice. Nonetheless, consumption of 2.4% DHA reduced cSiO2-triggered mononu-
clear cell infiltration in this mouse strain (Fig 6F).
Observations in H&E stained serial lung sections from NZBWF1 and NZW/LacJ mice were
confirmed by semi-quantitatively grading severity of pulmonary inflammation (Table 3). cSiO2
induced lymphocytic cell infiltration in both CON diet-fed NZBWF1 and NZW/LacJ mice;
however, the response induced in autoimmune-prone NZBWF1 mice was considerably more
severe. DHA diets were effective at reducing this infiltration in NZBWF1 mice in a dose-depen-
dent manner. Infiltration of mononuclear cells in cSiO2-treated NZW/LacJ mice was also sup-
pressed by feeding diets containing 2.4% DHA. Dietary supplementation with 2.4% DHA
reduced alveolitis in NZBWF1 mice as compared to CON diet-fed mice, whereas consumption
of 0.4 and 1.2% DHA diets had no effect. These effects were not observed in NZW/LacJ mice.
Finally, DHA consumption did not influence cSiO2-triggered alveolar proteinosis in NZBWF1
or NZW/LacJ mice. Consequently, DHA supplementation primarily targeted lymphocytic cell
infiltration in the lung.
Macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils were dramatically increased in the BALF of
CON-fed NZBWF1 mice instilled with cSiO2, while NZW/LacJ mice exhibited slighter
increases (Fig 7A–7C). Total cell counts in BALF of cSiO2-exposed NZBWF1 mice were
approximately 3-fold higher relative to NZW/LacJ mice. Consumption of 1.2 and 2.4% DHA

 markedly impaired macrophage, lymphocyte, and neutrophil cellular infiltration in cSiO2-
exposed NZBWF1 mice. Consumption of the 0.4% DHA diet reduced lymphocyte counts in
BALF but did not affect macrophage or neutrophil infiltration. cSiO2-exposed NZW/LacJ mice
fed 2.4% DHA also showed a trend towards decreased lymphocyte and neutrophil infiltration
compared to CON-fed mice.

tively. Both CD45R+ (Fig 8A and 8B) and CD3+ cells (Fig 8D and 8E) indicative of cSiO2-
induced ELT neogenesis were detected in lung parenchyma in CON-fed mice. Morphometry

 revealed that CD45R+ cells (Fig 9A) were more abundant in lung parenchyma than CD3+ cells
(Fig 9B). These findings confirmed previous observations that intranasal cSiO2 exposure
induces ELT development in NZBWF1 mice [15]. Dietary supplementation with 0.4, 1.2, and
2.4% DHA dose-dependently suppressed cSiO2-triggered B and T cell expansion (Figs 8C, 8F
and 9). The CD45R+ cell area in lung parenchyma was reduced by DHA consumption 80, 98,
and 96%, respectively, relative to cSiO2-exposed NZBWF1 fed CON diet (Fig 9A). In analogous
fashion, DHA supplementation reduced CD3+ cell area in lung parenchyma by 41, 79, and
83%, respectively (Fig 9B).
Consistent with immunohistochemical findings, cSiO2 triggered robust elevations in total
IgG and anti-dsDNA Ig concentrations, clinical signs of active lupus, in the BALF of CON

 diet-fed NZBWF1 mice (Fig 10A and 10B). cSiO2-triggered elevation in total IgG was sup-
pressed in mice fed diets containing 1.2 and 2.4% DHA. Likewise, DHA feeding at 0.4, 1.2 and
2.4% decreased anti-dsDNA Ig in BALF by 82, 97, and 95% respectively, relative to CON-fed
cSiO2-exposed NZBWF. Accordingly, dietary DHA consumption dramatically diminished
cSiO2-induced ELT neogenesis and production of total and autoreactive IgG production in the
lung.
DHA consumption suppresses cSiO2–triggered secretion of
proinflammatory and B-cell stimulatory cytokines into BALF
cSiO2 instillation of CON-fed NZBWF1 mice elicited increased concentrations of MCP-1,
TNF-α, and IL-6 in BALF compared to CON-fed mice instilled with VEH (Fig 11A–11C).
DHA consumption dose-dependently attenuated these responses, with the 1.2 and 2.4% DHA
diets being more efficacious than the 0.4% DHA diet. Other cytokines in the flow cytometric
bead panel IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12p70, and IL-17a fell below the limit of detection. The
effects of DHA on two B-cell stimulating cytokines, BAFF and OPN, were also assessed in
BALF of NZBWF1 mice. Both cytokines were significantly induced in CON-fed mice instilled
with cSiO2 (Fig 12A and 12B). Dietary supplementation with DHA dose-dependently
decreased ciSO2-induced BAFF and a similar trend was observed for ciSO2-induced OPN.
Dietary DHA attenuates cSiO2-induced systemic autoantibody and
cytokine elevation
As observed in BALF, CON-fed NZBWF1 mice instilled with cSiO2 exhibited plasma elevations of
total IgG and anti-dsDNA Ig relative to their VEH-exposed counterparts (Fig 13A and 13B). Con-
sumption of diets containing 1.2 and 2.4% DHA suppressed cSiO2-induced IgG elevation. Dietary
DHA also dose-dependently decreased anti-dsDNA Ig concentrations in plasma of NZBWF1
mice. Differences in total IgG were not evident between CON-fed NZW/LacJ mice exposed to
VEH or cSiO2. Interestingly, cSiO2-exposed NZW/LacJ mice fed DHA had significantly decreased
total IgG in plasma compared to cSiO2-exposed mice fed CON diet (Fig 13A). Differences in anti-
dsDNA Ig were not detected among any NZW/LacJ treatment groups (Fig 13B).
Plasma was also analyzed for cytokines to evaluate systemic effects of cSiO2 and DHA. In
CON-fed NZBWF1 mice, cSiO2 instillation caused an elevation in systemic MCP-1 and TNF-α.
Dose-dependent reductions in MCP-1 and TNF-in plasma occurred because of dietary treatment
with DHA (Fig 11D and 11E). cSiO2 treatment did not increase IL-6 in plasma but there was a
trend toward decreased levels of this cytokine in DHA-fed mice (Fig 11F). Other cytokines IFN-
γ, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12p70, and IL-17a fell below the limit of detection. cSiO2 exposure also
induced plasma BAFF in CON-fed NZBWF1 mice (Fig 12C). Consumption of 1.2, and 2.4%
DHA diets significantly reduced cSiO2-induced systemic BAFF responses. Similar trends were
observed for OPN with 1.2% DHA diet significantly suppressing this B cell factor (Fig 12D).
Discussion
Heredity is widely viewed to be critical in the manifestation of autoimmunity in an individual;
however, the exposome can impact both latency and severity of an AD [37]. This investigation

 is unique because it is the first to employ an animal model genetically predisposed to lupus, a
prototypical AD, to identify how two highly relevant and countervailing exposome elements,
cSiO2 exposure, and ω-3 PUFA content of the diet, influence latency, and progression of auto-
immunity. Importantly, we demonstrate that dietary DHA dose-dependently inhibited cSiO2-
triggered inflammation, ELT neogenesis and autoantibody production in the lung. Moreover,
these effects were recapitulated systemically as evidenced by concurrent DHA-mediated sup-
pression of cSiO2-induced elevations in cytokines and autoantibodies in plasma. Lastly, DHA
consumption acted further downstream at the kidney by preventing glomerulonephritis and
resultant proteinuria. Collectively, these data support the contention that triggering of autoim-
munity by cSiO2 might be prevented or delayed by modulating dietary lipid composition.
Our findings confirm recent observations that weekly intranasal exposure of female
NZBWF1 mice to 1 mg cSiO2 for 4 wk triggers autoimmune responses in the lung, blood and
kidney [15]. Notably, there was robust development of ELT in the lung as evidenced by exten-
sive perivascular and peribronchial lymphoplasmacytic infiltration consisting of T cells, B cells,
and IgG-producing plasma cells. We further detected elevated concentrations of autoantibod-
ies, cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), the chemokine MCP-1 and B cell stimulatory factors (BAFF,
OPN) in BALF and plasma. Both reduced latency and increased intensity of glomerulonephri-
tis paralleled inflammatory events in the lung and plasma. Hence, our current and previous
findings strongly suggest that, following airway exposure to cSiO2, the lung might serve as a
staging point for triggering systemic autoimmunity and lupus nephritis.
Initiation of lupus involves, in part, impaired phagocytosis of dead or dying cells leading to
aberrant autoantigen presentation and production of autoantibodies, an immunological hall-
mark for this AD [38–43]. These autoantibodies form complexes with self-antigens (e.g.
dsDNA and nucleosome fractions) that subsequently deposit widely in tissues. In the kidney,
such immune complexes promote proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production that
mediate infiltration by mononuclear cells and consequent tissue injury [44–47]. Lupus morbid-
ity and mortality often correspond with severity of autoimmune glomerulonephritis [48]. It
has been convincingly established that airway exposure to cSiO2 or other particles unleashes a
vicious, repetitive cycle in alveolar macrophages of phagocytosis ! lysosomal membrane per-
meabilization ! inflammasome activation ! cell death ! release of free cSiO2 particles !
phagocytosis that drives chronic inflammation in the lung [49, 50]. This cycle may deplete the
alveolar macrophage population, thereby promoting cell debris accumulation, secondary
necrosis, alarmin release, and self-antigen presentation that culminate in early loss of tolerance
with consequent production of pathogenic autoantibodies. Intriguingly, many of the processes
that drive toxicity of cSiO2 particles in the lung overlap with well-established early events in
lupus pathogenesis [51]. Consistent with this model, our findings, summarized in Fig 14, sug-
gest that DHA consumption attenuates cSiO2-induced i) cytokine and chemokine release, ii)
lymphocyte activation, proliferation and homing, iii) B cell differentiation to plasma cells and
iv)IgG secretion by plasma cells.
Several points are noteworthy regarding the cSiO2 dosing regimen employed here. Because
the mouse lifetime is approximately 30 to 40 times less than that of a person, a contracted
period of cSiO2 dosing (4 wk) was used to mimic long-term chronic human exposure. The
total cSiO2 dose in this study approximates one half of a human lifetime occupational exposure

have been reported such as intratracheal and trans-oral instillation (oropharyngeal aspiration),
we chose intranasal instillation based on its successful prior use in NZBWF1 and NZM2410

 approaches reported in mice receiving a single 1 mg dose of cSiO2 by each technique elicited
similarly robust pulmonary inflammation [53].
Little is known regarding the distribution of cSiO2 particles outside of the lung following
exposure and how such distribution might impact chronic toxicity to cSiO2. Sparse case reports
from individuals occupationally exposed to cSiO2 have reported not only the development of
typical silica-induced pulmonary diseases (i.e. silicosis), but also observations of cSiO2 particles
in peripheral organs such the lymph node, spleen, and kidney [54]. However, computational
models have predicted that distribution of cSiO2 particles to these compartments is negligible
[55], suggesting that pathological changes observed in these distal tissues are more likely a
result of immune system dysfunction rather than direct effects of particle toxicity. An alterna-
tive possibility for the pronounced suppressive effect of DHA we observed in both the lung and
distal organs of cSiO2-exposed NZBWF1 mice is dependent on restoration of the function of
the mucociliary escalator, which mediates clearance of particle-laden alveolar macrophages
from the respiratory tract. In a process termed "particle overload", high particle lung burdens
(such as those encountered by chronic exposure in occupational settings and doses of cSiO2
utilized in this study), result in alveolar macrophages saturated with engulfed cSiO2 that cease
translocation to the mucociliary escalator, culminating in inhibition of this clearance mecha-
nism and contributing to chronic toxicity [56, 57]. It is tempting to speculate that DHA could
facilitate enhanced phagocytosis of cSiO2 particles, possibly by increasing the fluidity of macro-
phage cellular membranes [58], which may facilitate pulmonary clearance of cSiO2-laden alve-
olar macrophages in lieu of the high concentrations of cSiO2. In support of this possibility,
previous studies have demonstrated that DHA and/or its metabolites enhanced phagocytosis
of zymosan beads [59, 60]; however no studies have specifically addressed their effect on
phagocytosis or clearance of environmental particulates.
The NZW/LacJ strain was selected as a control for this study because it is a parental strain
for NZBWF1 that does not spontaneously develop glomerulonephritis [10, 26]. It was therefore
notable that NZW/LacJ mice also exhibited modest pneumonitis and nephritis after cSiO2
exposure and that this could be prevented by consumption of DHA. Interestingly, we similarly
found that cSiO2 induces similar effects in C57Bl6 mice, which are also not prone to autoim-
munity [15].
Numerous preclinical/clinical studies have demonstrated that dietary ω-3 PUFA supple-
mentation suppresses and sometimes even reverses innate immune cell-driven inflammation
thus making these dietary lipids attractive candidates for the prevention/treatment of chronic
inflammatory diseases [21]. For example, ω-3 PUFAs suppress proinflammatory cytokine pro-
duction, lymphocyte proliferation, cytotoxic T cell activity, natural killer cell activity, macro-
phage-mediated cytotoxicity, neutrophil/monocyte chemotaxis, MHCII expression and
antigen presentation. Mechanistically, the anti-inflammatory effects of ω-3 PUFAs have been
linked to alterations in: 1) production of bioactive lipid mediators, 2) intracellular signaling,
transcription factor activity, and gene expression; and 3) membrane structure/function [61].
The potential of fish oil or semi-purified ω-3 PUFAs to specifically delay, prevent, and ame-
liorate autoimmunity has been investigated extensively in lupus-prone mouse models. Early
studies with NZBWF1 mice demonstrated that initiating feeding of menhaden oil, DHA ethyl

0.001). DHA dose-dependently decreased plasma anti-dsDNA Ig in NZBWF1 (r2 = -0.567, p < 0.001).

 ester or EPA ethyl ester early in life markedly reduce severity and incidence of renal disease as
well as extend the lifespan compared to mice fed beef tallow [62–64]. These findings coincide
with reductions of autoantibodies and circulating immune complexes. Elegant studies from the
Fernandes laboratory have related the delayed onset and decreased severity of renal disease
exhibited in fish oil-fed NZBWF1 mice to reduced IL-1β, TNF-α, TGFβ1, ICAM-1 and fibro-
nectin expression and increased expression of antioxidant enzymes [65–69]. The ameliorative
effects of ω-3 PUFAs have been similarly replicated in two other murine lupus models, BXSB/
MpJ and MRL-1pr/1pr, as evidenced by decreased plasma proinflammatory cytokines, protein-
uria, and glomerular injury as well as increased lifespan [70, 63, 71–73]. In a recent study com-
paring the effects of consuming ω-3 PUFA-, ω-6 PUFA- and ω-9 MUFA-rich diets on
spontaneous AD development in NZBWF1 mice, we observed elevated plasma autoantibodies,
proteinuria and glomerulonephritis in mice fed the latter two diets [24]. In contrast, all three
endpoints were markedly attenuated in mice consuming the ω-3 PUFA diet, which contained
primarily DHA.
Current Western diets predominantly supply ω-6 PUFA but are deficient in ω-3 PUFA
[61]. LA, the primary ω-6 PUFA in plant-derived oils, and its metabolite ARA are major PUFA
in phospholipids of cell membranes. By replacing these, DHA is readily integrated into plasma
membrane phospholipids in cells throughout the body, including those that mediate immune
function [17]. Consistent with this paradigm, we observed dose-dependent increases in DHA
and decreases in ARA in lung, kidney and RBCs. DHA was selected for this study over other ω-
3 PUFA such as EPA because it has been shown to be superior in preventing spontaneous auto-
immunity in NZBWF1 mice [74]. The DHA-rich microalgal oil employed in this study is free
of heavy metals and organic pollutants that might be encountered in oils produced from
farmed and wild cold-water fish [19]. As this product is formulated to be a source of DHA, the
ω-3 PUFA EPA is not present. Accordingly, the microalgal oil employed here is preferable to
fish oil-derived formulations because experimental results are attributable to DHA and not
confounded by the presence of EPA or other ω-3 PUFAs.
Representative ω-3 PUFA intake recommendations for healthy people range from 0.5 to 2
g/d, but higher levels of consumption up to 20 g/d have been used in clinical therapy trials for
established lupus [75–77]. The 0.4, 1.2, and 2.4% dietary DHA concentrations used in this
study account for 0.9, 2.7, and 5.4% of total energy intake. Upon extrapolation, a human eating
2000 kcal/d (8.368 MJ/d) would require 2, 6, and 12 g/d to correlate with the amounts con-
sumed in this study. Consequently, in terms of energy percentage in a typical human diet, the
concentrations employed here span a range attainable through diet, supplement consumption
or by prescription. Therefore, given that some beneficial effects occurred at all three DHA
doses, our findings have physiologic relevance to humans. During the course of this study, the
European Food Safety Authority deemed that human consumption of supplements containing
up to 5 g/d ω-3 PUFA derived from microalgal oil is considered safe [78]. Future perspectives
of this model should therefore focus on effects of consuming 5 g/d DHA or lower human
equivalents (i.e. � 2.4% of total energy intake) and consider effects of DHA consumption by
lupus-prone mice during early life-stages on long-term susceptibility to environmental AD
triggers.
Conclusions
Our findings reveal for the first time that DHA consumption dose-dependently suppresses
cSiO2 triggering of autoimmunity in female NZBWF1 mice as manifested in the lung, blood
and kidney (Fig 14). These observations provide a foundation for further mechanistic explora-
tion of how modulation of the lipidome may be used to prevent or delay triggering of AD by

 cSiO2 and potentially other respirable toxicants. Such knowledge possibly could lead to devel-
opment of practical, low-cost preventative strategies to reduce the risk of developing AD in
cSiO2-exposed individuals or even slow progression of existing autoimmunity [79]. Future
studies will focus on understanding the mechanisms by which DHA and/or its metabolites sup-
press cSiO2-triggered autoimmunity in this model emphasizing the alveolar macrophage. It
will be particularly interesting to determine if unique lipidome signatures are predictive of pro-
tective effects of ω-3 PUFA on populations exposed to environmental AD triggers.
