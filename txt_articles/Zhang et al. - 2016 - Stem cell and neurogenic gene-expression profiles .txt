The prostate gland mainly contains basal and luminal cells constructed as a pseudostratified
epithelium. Annotation of prostate epithelial transcriptomes provides a foundation for
discoveries that can impact disease understanding and treatment. Here we describe a
genome-wide transcriptome analysis of human benign prostatic basal and luminal epithelial
populations using deep RNA sequencing. Through molecular and biological characterizations,
we show that the differential gene-expression profiles account for their distinct functional
properties. Strikingly, basal cells preferentially express gene categories associated with stem
cells, neurogenesis and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) biogenesis. Consistent with this profile, basal
cells functionally exhibit intrinsic stem-like and neurogenic properties with enhanced rRNA
transcription activity. Of clinical relevance, the basal cell gene-expression profile is enriched in
advanced, anaplastic, castration-resistant and metastatic prostate cancers. Therefore, we link
the cell-type-specific gene signatures to aggressive subtypes of prostate cancer and identify
gene signatures associated with adverse clinical features.

 P
rostate
cancer
(PCa) is
a heterogeneous
malignancy
harbouring
phenotypically
and
functionally
diverse
subpopulations of cancer cells1,2. To better understand
PCa cell heterogeneity, it is crucial to dissect the biology of
normal prostate epithelial lineages, which could help address
important questions such as the cell(s)-of-origin
of PCa.
The prostate is an exocrine gland in which prostatic ducts are
lined by three cell types: secretory luminal cells, basal cells and
rare neuroendocrine cells3. Developmentally, the murine prostate
originates from an ancestral p63 þAR � basal stem cell (SC)
population4. Prostate regeneration assays also reveal SCs with
multi-lineage differentiation potential to be localized to the basal
layer of the mouse prostate5–8. Lineage-tracing studies, on the
other hand, suggest that both basal and luminal cell layers in
adult murine prostate contain lineage-restricted stem/progenitor
cells9,10 although primitive SCs reside in the basal layer10. In
support, some mouse prostate basal cells can undergo asymmetric
divisions (a cardinal feature of SCs), whereas luminal cells only
undergo symmetrical divisions11. In the human prostate, there is
also evidence that the basal cell layer harbours regenerative
SCs6,12. Nevertheless, ‘direct’ evidence is still lacking, as, for
obvious reasons, lineage tracing cannot be performed in the live
human prostate.
Defining the cells-of-origin for cancer is of great value for
patient
tumour
stratification
and
delivering
personalized
treatment. Luminal cells are traditionally believed to be the
cell-of-origin for human PCa due to the predominantly luminal-
like phenotype of the disease. However, tissue regeneration-based
assays indicate that only a subset of basal cells can function as the
cell-of-origin for PCa6, whereas studies in genetic mouse models
show that PCa can originate from both basal and luminal cell
lineages and that luminal cells are even more susceptible to
tumourigenesis9,13. It is presently unclear what might account
for the discrepancies in these two lines of studies. Potentially, an
in-depth understanding of the gene-expression differences in
normal
human
prostate
basal
versus
luminal
cells
could
help illuminate the intrinsic functional differences between
the two cell types, which, in turn, could offer fresh insights into
the cell-of-origin for (different types of) PCa.
Gene expression is a key determinant of cellular phenotypes.
A comprehensive annotation of the transcriptome would facilitate
a better understanding of how gene expression influences
phenotypic
manifestations.
Recently,
RNA
sequencing
(RNA-Seq) has been widely used to delineate the entire
transcriptome in a large variety of tissues and cancers at
unprecedented
depth
and
sensitivity.
In
particular,
deep
RNA-Seq allows the detection of the novel and relatively low
abundant transcripts (for example, long non-coding RNAs).
Comprehensive exploration of the DNA mutational landscape of
PCa has been achieved using genome-wide sequencing14,15.
Recent TCGA project also includes the RNA-Seq data for
hundreds of PCa patients. However, all large-scale sequencing
studies as of yet in the field have used heterogeneous tissue pieces
(which contain epithelial and non-epithelial cells) as the material
for DNA and RNA extraction, suggesting a lack of insight into the
biology of distinct epithelial lineages.
Here
we
describe
a
detailed
transcriptome
analysis
of
unperturbed human benign prostatic basal and luminal cells by
deep RNA-Seq. The results reveal the surprising findings that
basal cells are intrinsically enriched in gene sets normally
associated with SCs, neurogenesis and ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
biogenesis.
We
show
that,
coupled
with
their
unique
gene-expression
profiles,
basal
cells
functionally
exhibit
intrinsic stem-like and neurogenic properties with enhanced
rRNA transcription activity. We further link the basal cell
gene
signature
to
those
in
aggressive,
castration-resistant
and anaplastic PCa subtypes. We also identify molecular
signatures
associated
with
patient
outcome.
Altogether,
our results provide the most functionally comprehensive study
on, and a resource of the transcriptomes in, unperturbed subtypes
of human prostatic epithelial cells that shed light on PCa
aetiology.
Results
Distinct transcriptomes of prostatic basal and luminal cells.
To comprehensively interrogate the molecular features of human
prostate epithelial lineages, we determined the transcriptomes of
unperturbed benign basal and luminal populations by deep
paired-end
RNA-Seq.
Three
representative
human
benign
samples (HPCa173N, 175N and 177N) from PCa patients who
had
largely
benign
biopsies
(Supplementary
Fig.
1a
and
Supplementary Table 1) were selected for purification of basal
(Trop2 þCD49fhi) and luminal (Trop2 þCD49flo) fractions6
using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; Fig. 1a and
Supplementary Fig. 1b). Three pairs of total RNAs derived from
basal and luminal populations were generated for library
preparations and subsequent RNA-Seq.
By deep sequencing of the rRNA-depleted total RNAs, we
obtained
an
average
of
211.5
million
reads
per
sample
(range from 196.6 to 229.9) with an average mapping rate of
91.7% to the reference human genome (UCSC version hg19;
Supplementary Fig. 1c). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering
showed that the basal and luminal populations were grouped
together and well-separated (Fig. 1b) and MA plot indicated
appropriate normalization of our RNA-Seq data (Supplementary
Fig. 1d). By applying a stringent statistic threshold of greater than
equal to twofold change (FC) and false discovery rate (FDR) of
o0.05, we identified a consensus of 853 differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) upregulated in basal and 940 DEGs in luminal cells
(Supplementary Data 1). Basal and luminal cells showed
exclusively high expression in molecules known to be restricted
to each cell type (Fig. 1c). As expected, no difference was found
for TACSTD2 (Trop2), and neuroendocrine markers showed little

 luminal (mammary luminal cell signature and AR pathway,
Fig. 1e) epithelial phenotypes, respectively. Remarkably, when we
extracted three sets of androgen-responsive genes and AR-
regulated genes16–18, we found that they were all enriched in our
luminal cells (Fig. 1f). To further dissect the transcriptomic
profiles, we performed the pathway/network enrichment analysis
by GSEA and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Strikingly, GSEA
revealed that genes upregulated in basal or luminal cells were
enriched in markedly different functional pathways, which were
corroborated by IPA (Supplementary Data 2 and Supplementary
Fig. 1e). Finally, we combined gene ontology (GO) analysis and
literature-based manual curation to classify each DEG in each cell
type into non-redundant functional categories (Supplementary
Data 1). Such thorough gene annotations demonstrated that,
consistent with global GSEA and IPA, SCs and development,
neural/neuronal development, the cell adhesion and motility, RNA
metabolism and ribosome/translation represented the top gene
categories in basal cells (Fig. 1g). In contrast, genes upregulated in
luminal cells fell into categories of prostate organ function (for
example, steroid hormone processing, secretion, lipid metabolism),
androgen and AR signalling, and inflammation and immunity
(Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 1e). In support, gene signatures
corresponding to above categories were highly enriched in luminal
cells (Fig. 1e–h). Therefore, our RNA-Seq-derived gene-expression
profiles in basal and luminal cells mirror their well-established
biological functions and support basal cells as undifferentiated
stem-like and luminal cells as differentiated functional cell types.
The current study presents the deepest annotated transcriptomes
of the two human prostate epithelial lineages.
Interestingly, in addition to coding RNAs, we also identified
many differentially expressed non-coding RNAs. Consistent with
the
reliability
of
our
RNA-Seq
data,
we
observed
many
AR-regulated ncRNAs (including miRNAs and lncRNAs) in
luminal
cells
and
p63-regulated
ncRNAs
in
basal
cells
(Supplementary Data 1). The functional significance of these
changes in regulating human prostate epithelial biology is
currently under investigation.
Identification of novel prostate epithelial lineage markers. In
addition to capturing the global view of prostatic basal and luminal
cell transcriptomes, our RNA-Seq analysis identified sets of genes
specific to each cell type, potentially providing a battery of novel
markers that can be used to distinguish the two epithelial lineages.
For example, consistent with RNA-Seq data, immunohistochem-
istry analysis of EGFR and SNAI2 showed enhanced staining
intensity and frequency in basal versus luminal cells, whereas
CTNNB1
exhibited
no
staining
difference
in
both
layers
(Supplementary Fig. 1f,g). We identified the top 50 putative
marker genes for each lineage (Fig. 1i) inferred from tran-
scriptomes based on both relative differential expression (FC) and
absolute expression levels (normalized read counts; see the
‘Methods’
section),
some
of
which
were
confirmed
by
immunofluorescence,
including
COL17A1
and
HMGA2
(Supplementary Fig. 1h), DLL4 (Fig. 1j), and FGFR3 and NGFR
(see below). In particular, DLL4 was confirmed to be a bona fide
luminal marker. Considering that NOTCH receptors (NOTCH1/
4) were preferentially expressed in basal cells, this may represent an
example of signalling crosstalk between basal and luminal cells.
Notably, we also identified many transcription and nuclear factors
whose expression profiles were strongly linked to each cell type
(Supplementary Data 1).
Intrinsic SC and EMT properties of prostatic basal cells. The
unique gene- (for example, SC- and epithelial–mesenchymal
transition (EMT)-enriched) expression profile in basal cells
(Supplementary Fig. 1e) and current inability to culture fully
differentiated AR þ/PSA þ luminal cells prompted us to focus our
subsequent studies on basal cells. Freshly purified primary basal
cells and short-term expanded cultures (oP3) were utilized in a
spectrum of in vitro and in vivo assays to characterize the basal
cell stem/progenitor activities. Our RNA-Seq suggests a stem-like
transcriptional programme in basal cells, and many of the known
SC-related genes and pathways were upregulated in basal cells
(Fig. 2a,b). Consistent with the SC-enriched gene profiles, freshly
purified basal cells exhibited much higher clonal (colony forma-
tion; Fig. 2c) and clonogenic (sphere-forming; Fig. 2d) capacities
than matched luminal cells. Primary basal cells also possessed
long-term proliferative capacity (Fig. 2e), as supported by high
Ki-67 þ labelling efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Importantly,
freshly purified basal cells could differentiate into CK8 þ luminal
cells in sphere cultures in the presence of dihydrotestosterone
(Supplementary Fig. 2b). The spheres initially emerged as a
solid ball and then developed into hollow organoids with
secretion inside the lumen. Structurally, p63 þ and CK5 þ basal
cells mainly resided in the peripheral layer (Supplementary
Fig.
2b),
consistent
with
a
recent
report19.
Significantly,
primary basal cells, when implanted with embryonic urogenital
sinus mesenchyme subcutaneously, were able to regenerate
glandular
structures
with
luminal
differentiation
(Fig.
2f
and Supplementary Fig. 2c). The basal identity of the cells
injected and human origin of the recombinants were verified
by p63 and human-specific mitochondria staining, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. 2d). Since adult tissue SCs normally remain
quiescent in situ, we performed double immunofluorescence of
Ki-67 with CK5 or CK8 and quantified Ki-67 þ cells according to
epithelial identity. Consistent with observations in the murine
prostate20, more than 80% of Ki-67 þ
cells were luminal,
documenting the relative quiescence of basal cells (Fig. 2g).
Rapid adhesion to collagen and preferential expression of cell-
surface integrins have been exploited to enrich SCs in the human
prostate12. Consistently, basal cells preferentially expressed many
genes associated with cell adhesion/cytoskeleton/extracellular
matrix
remodelling
(Fig.
1g).
In
contrast,
luminal
cells
expressed only about half as many genes that fall into this
category (8.7 versus 15.6%). GSEA and IPA indicated that many
of cell junction and movement pathways were preferentially
enriched in basal cells (Supplementary Fig. 1e and Supplementary
Data 2), suggesting that basal cells might be more motile. In
support, basal cells expressed an EMT signature and many typical
EMT inducers and markers (Fig. 2a,b), and primary basal cells
exhibited high migratory and invasive capacities compared with
luminal cells (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 2e).
Pathways regulating the SC properties of basal cells. GSEA and
IPA uncovered important signalling pathways enriched in basal
cells including TGF-b, NOTCH, WNT/TCF, IGF, FGF, STAT3/
IL6
and
others
(Supplementary
Fig.
1e
and
3a–c;
and
Supplementary Data 2). For instance, immunofluorescence of
FGFR3 validated our RNA-Seq data and revealed its expression
preferentially in the basal layer (Fig. 3a). We systematically
investigated some of these pathways in regulating primary basal
stem/progenitor activities. Given that each pathway has a large
number of components, we first used the pathway-specific
pharmacological inhibitors to interrogate their roles in regulating
basal cell activity. For pathways of particular interest, small
interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knock-down experiments
were performed to validate the inhibitor results.
Overall,

activities. Surprisingly, basal cells were relatively tolerant of

 inhibitors of the TGFbR, NOTCH and WNT pathways in 2D cell
growth (Fig. 3b) but were very sensitive to these inhibitors in 3D
sphere-formation (Fig. 3c) assays. In particular, DAPT, an
inhibitor of NOTCH, only slightly affected basal cell proliferation
at r20 mM (Fig. 3b) but significantly inhibited sphere formation
(both number and size) at r10 mM (Fig. 3c). This is consistent
with recent genetic studies showing that disrupting canonical
Notch impairs the differentiation of murine prostate basal SCs
but not their proliferation21. Similar results were observed in
other primary basal cells (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Consistent
with the reported requirement of IGF and FGF in establishing a
regulatory SC niche in cultured human ESCs22, and promotion by
STAT3 of stem-like phenotypes in normal prostate and PCa
cells23,24, basal cells exhibited a high sensitivity to inhibitors of
FGFR, IGF1R and STAT3 signalling (Fig. 3b–d). Consistently,
knocking down FGFR3, NOTCH1 and CTNNB1 also greatly
reduced colony and sphere formation in basal cells (Fig. 3e,f and
Supplementary Fig. 3e–g).
A key feature of basal SC properties is reflected in their ability
to differentiate into luminal-like cells. As blockade of FGFR3,
NOTCH1
and
CTNNB1
pathways
impaired
basal
cell
proliferation, we reasoned that inhibition of these pathways
might also promote cellular differentiation. As shown in Fig. 3g,
SU5402-,
DAPT-
and
XAV-939-treated
spheres
exhibited
markedly increased mRNA levels of AR, KLK3 (PSA) and
KRT18, respectively. These data suggest that blocking signalling

 synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide significantly inhibited basal cell
proliferation at as low as 20 nM (Supplementary Fig. 4a).
Strikingly,
basal
cells
also
preferentially
upregulated
the
signatures of Pol I transcription and ribosome biogenesis
(Fig. 4c). Pol I-dependent transcription governs abundance of
rRNA and directly regulates cellular translational and thus
proliferative capacity. It is well-known that MYC regulates
rRNA
synthesis
and
ribosome
biogenesis
through
direct
activation of Pol I and transcriptionally increasing the levels of
Pol I subunits26. In support of this connection, MYC was
upregulated in basal cells, along with the MYC targets and
MYC-dependent
transcriptional
programme
(Fig.
4d
and
Supplementary Fig. 4b). Moreover, several key Pol I complex
subunits (Supplementary Fig. 4c) and genes involved in rRNA
processing were also upregulated in basal cells (Fig. 4e).
qRT–PCR analysis in three other pairs of matching basal and
luminal populations revealed enhanced rRNA transcription rate
in basal cells (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 4d,e).
Several recent reports have linked rRNA transcription and
ribosome biogenesis to SC activities27–29. To examine the role of
rRNA transcription in basal stem/progenitor cell activities, we
utilized Actinomycin D, a transcriptional inhibitor that mainly
inhibits rRNA transcription when used at a low concentration27.
We observed that Actinomycin D, at as low as 20 pM, greatly
inhibited cell proliferation (Fig. 4g). We also treated freshly
purified basal cells with CX-5461, which selectively inhibits Pol
I-dependent
transcription30,
and
observed
that
CX-5461
completely blocked the cell proliferation at 40 nM (Fig. 4g
and Supplementary Fig. 4f). Notably, both inhibitors also
severely impaired the sphere-formation ability (Supplementary
Fig. 4g).
Next, we utilized JQ1 to investigate the role of MYC
transcriptional
programme.

 attenuated MYC transcriptional programme by decreasing MYC
itself and its targets (Fig. 4h). Perturbation of MYC programme
also decreased the rate of pre-rRNA transcription (ITS2) and the
levels of key Pol I subunit CD3EAP (Fig. 4h). These results
suggest that MYC positively regulates basal cell proliferation, at
least
partially,
through
enhancing
Pol
I-mediated
rRNA
transcription. In support, siRNA-mediated knock down of the
key subunit of Pol I complex CD3EAP inhibited cell proliferation
and sphere formation, as well as the sphere sizes (Fig. 4i).
Collectively, these data reveal enhanced Pol I transcription and

 and neurogenesis were markedly enriched in basal cells whereas
luminal cells were enriched in terms/signatures associated with
neural
sensory
perception
and
response
(Supplementary
Fig. 5a,b).
Immunofluorescence analysis of NGFR revealed a basal
localization (Fig. 5a), validating RNA-Seq data. Gene-expression
plot (Fig. 5b) and GSEA (Fig. 5c) highlighted an independent
signature of 99 essential neural/neuronal development genes
(Supplementary Table 2) enriched in basal cells. Considering
the demonstrated SC properties of basal cells (Fig. 2), we
reasoned that the enriched proneural gene profile might confer
on them certain intrinsic traits of neural SCs (NSCs). We
performed a classical NSC assay to show that freshly purified
basal cells displayed approximately five times higher efficiency in
generating ‘neurospheres’ in neural culture conditions32 with or
without Matrigel (Fig. 5d). Strikingly, primary basal cell cultures
showed homogeneous and strong expression of SOX2 and
sporadic
expression
of
NES,
whereas
PAX6
was
not
detectable (Fig. 5e), consistent with its low mRNA level
(FPKMo0.1). A recent study reported that SOX2 alone could
reprogramme
human
fibroblasts
into
multipotent
NSCs33.
Therefore, high levels of SOX2 may provide a mechanism to
confer basal cells NSC-like properties. Also, basal cells highly
overexpressed HMGA2 (FPKM ¼ 8.62±3.43 in basal versus
0.42±0.2 in luminal), an epigenetic factor that can facilitate the
reprogramming of human adult somatic cells into NSCs through
an interaction with SOX2 (ref. 34).
During the initial culture of freshly purified basal cells, virtually
all cells presented typical flat epithelial morphology. However,
upon reaching confluence, we frequently observed clusters of cells
resembling classical neural rosettes (Supplementary Fig. 5c,
circles). In particular, in post-confluent cultures, numerous cells
manifested as morphologically neural-like cells, which were not
neuroendocrine cells as they were negative for neuroendocrine
markers such as SYN (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Longitudinal
tracking and quantification of the morphologically neural-like
cells at different culture stages indicated that these neural-like
cells
were
differentiated
from
basal
epithelial
cells
(Supplementary Fig. 5d,e). Considering the high levels of SOX2
and HMGA2, these results suggest the presence of NSC-like cells
in our primary basal cell cultures, which have the potential to
differentiate into neural-like cells.
We next investigated the proneural differentiation potential of
primary basal cells using three different protocols (see ‘Methods’
section). In the default ‘spontaneous’ protocol, basal cells were
continuously cultured for 3 weeks post confluence without
medium change. In the second protocol, 10 mM retinoic acid (RA)
was
introduced,
as
it
is
widely
used
to
induce
neural
differentiation
of
pluripotent
SCs.
In
the
third
protocol,
neurotrophic factors (NFs; namely BDNF, GDNF and NGF-b,
all at 10 ng ml � 1) and db-cAMP (0.5 mM) were added to
the medium35, as basal cells upregulated several receptors
(for
example,
NGFR,
NPBWR1).
Remarkably,
all
three
protocols resulted in similar neural-like cultures during the
time course investigated (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 5e),
although RA treatment induced more rosette-like structures
(Fig. 5g). Characterization of the end point cultures revealed
strong staining of astrocyte marker GFAP and neuronal marker
TH, and relatively weak staining of mature neuronal markers
MAP2, NeuN and b-tubulin III (Fig. 5h). The majority of the cells
were also positive for oligodendrocyte precursor marker Olig2
(Fig. 5h). These results, together, suggest that the primary
prostatic basal cells have the capacity to differentiate into neural
progenitor-like
cells,
evidenced
by
expression
of
multiple
progenitor but not mature neuronal markers. The specificity of
antibodies used was validated by immunofluorescence analysis
of mouse brain tissues (Supplementary Fig. 5f). qRT–PCR
analysis showed that, upon induction of differentiation in the
default protocol, basal cells attenuated their basal epithelial
identity and upregulated the levels of NSC markers and a panel of
neural/neuronal genes (Fig. 5i and Supplementary Fig. 5g).
Finally, single-cell clonal analysis confirmed the ability of basal
cells to differentiate into neural-like cells (Supplementary Fig. 5h).
Collectively, these results suggest that prostatic basal cells
intrinsically express a neurogenic gene profile and are endowed
with the ability to differentiate along neural lineages.
The prostate is an organ richly innervated by the autonomic
nervous system, and autonomic nerve development contributes to
PCa progression36. Considering that nerves are a common feature
of the microenvironment, we speculated that the presence of
neurons, together with other types of neural cells, in the stroma
might contribute to the proneural properties of basal epithelial
cells.
Indeed,
immunofluorescence
analysis
revealed
rare
TH þ, NES þ and b-Tubulin III þ nerve fibres and abundant
GFAP þ cells proximal to the basal layer (Supplementary Fig. 6a),
suggesting that basal epithelial cells may also respond to and are
regulated
by
neural/neuronal
signals
from
the
underlying
microenvironment.

primary
basal cells (Supplementary Fig. 6b). These data suggest that
the stromal microenvironment might contribute to and regulate
the neurogenic property of basal cells.
Proneural genes regulate basal stem/progenitor activities.
We have, for the first time, identified a proneural gene-expression
profile in basal cells, but the functional significance for these
genes in regulating the basal cell properties remains unknown.
Among them, several, that is, HMGA2, CDH13, NGFR and
NRG1 (Fig. 1i) are of particular interest. HMGA2 is highly
expressed in and also regulates the murine fetal NSCs37.
CDH13 is a GPI-anchored member of cadherin superfamily
with
regulatory
functions
in
axon
growth
during
neural
differentiation,
and
does
not
function
through
cell–cell
adhesion due to the lack of a cytoplasmic domain characteristic
of other cadherins. Interestingly, CDH13 is generally lost in
cancer, including PCa, due to promoter hypermethylation38.
NGFR has been previously reported as a prostate basal cell
marker underexpressed in PCa39. NRG1 is a glycoprotein that
interacts with and activates ERBB receptors. Notably, ERBB1
(EGFR, FC ¼ 2.15, FDR ¼ 0.054; Supplementary Fig. 1f) and
ERBB3 (FC ¼ 3.62, FDR ¼ 0.0009) are significantly overexpressed
in basal and luminal cells, respectively, suggesting the possible
involvement of NRG1-mediated signalling in regulating both cell
layers. Consistent with this possibility, basal mammary epithelial
cells control luminal progenitor maturation and function through
a paracrine p63-NRG1 axis during lactogenesis40.
Knocking down of HMGA2 and CDH13 by siRNA signifi-
cantly impaired basal cell proliferation and stemness (Fig. 6a,b).
Experiments using blocking antibody further confirmed the
effect of CDH13 knock down on basal cell biology (Fig. 6c).
Although the knock-down efficiency of HMGA2 siRNAs was
relatively low, the results could be readily reproduced in primary
basal cells from other benign prostate tissues (Supplementary
Fig. 7a,b). Likewise, lentiviral shRNA-mediated knock down of
NGFR and NRG1 inhibited basal cell colony and sphere
formation (Fig. 6d,e and Supplementary Fig. 7c), neurosphere
formation (Fig. 6f), as well as the proneural differentiation
(Fig. 6g). These data suggest that the proneural genes are
functionally important in regulating basal stem/progenitor
activities, as well as their capacity to undergo proneural
differentiation.

 Basal cell gene profile is linked to aggressive PCa. We
determined whether our global transcriptomic profiles of normal
basal and luminal epithelial lineages could be linked to clinical
features of PCa by comparing with multiple clinical sample
(including TCGA) and cell line data sets. It is well-known that the
majority of untreated primary PCa present as adenocarcinomas
while a small subset (1–5%) of patient tumours is classified
as undifferentiated or anaplastic PCa variants frequently termed
as small cell PCa or neuroendocrine PCa. These tumours have a
clinically aggressive behaviour, lack AR expression, and are

 refractory to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Significantly,
such aggressive variants markedly increase in castration-resistant
PCa (CRPC) patients41. GSEA showed that typical clinical PCa
and LNCaP cells presented a luminal cell-like gene-expression
profile (Fig. 6h–j). In contrast, the basal cells were greatly
enriched in gene signatures associated with aggressive PCa
including
neuroendocrine
PCa42,
small
cell
PCa/LCNEC
(large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma)43, and PC3 and Du145
(Fig. 6k–m and Supplementary Fig.7d), suggesting a global basal
cell-like
gene-expression
profile
for
these
PCa
variants.
Importantly, a 19-gene indolent PCa signature44 was enriched
in luminal cells (Fig. 6n), suggesting a predictive value of luminal
cell gene profile in distinguishing indolent versus aggressive
disease. In support, when we performed clustering analysis of
TCGA-PCa data, we extracted two gene signatures corresponding
to patients with low and high Gleason score (GS; Supplementary
Fig.7e), and observed a strong enrichment of low GS signature in
luminal cells and of high GS signature in basal cells (Fig. 6o).
Two RNA-Seq data sets generated from PCa patients before and
after
ADT45
were
utilized
to
investigate
whether
our
transcriptomes could distinguish CRPC versus treatment naive
PCa.
Strikingly,
the
‘before-ADT’
gene-expression
profile
resembled that of luminal cells (Fig. 6p) whereas CRPC after
ADT expressed a basal-like profile (Fig. 6q). A similar association
between basal gene profile and CRPC was observed in two
Oncomine data sets (Fig. 6r and Supplementary Fig. 7f). Finally, in
TCGA-PCa patients, the gene signature in patients with or without
hormonal therapy (HT) was greatly enriched in our benign basal
and luminal cells, respectively (Fig. 6o and Supplementary Fig. 7g).
Compared with the signature of untreated high GS patients, the
signature of high GS patients after HT became further enriched in
basal cells evidenced by increased NES (1.21 versus 1.48; Fig. 6o),
suggesting that HT induced a further shift of gene expression
towards a basal-like profile. Finally, Oncomine concept analysis
showed that 10 basal and 18 luminal proneural genes were up and
downregulated, respectively, in metastatic versus primary PCa
(Supplementary Fig. 7h), suggesting that metastatic PCa are more
likely to express a basal-like profile. Further analysis showed that
the expression levels of some basal (for example, GLS, NME1) and
luminal (for example, DLGAP1, PTPRN2) proneural genes were,
respectively, associated with poor and better patient survival
(Supplementary Fig. 7i).
Discussion
The current study has made the following significant findings
(see Supplementary Discussion). First, our study uncovers unique
SC- and EMT-enriched gene-expression profile in unperturbed
basal cells that support the long-held hypothesis that the human
prostate basal cell layer harbours primitive SCs. Second, we report
the surprising finding that basal cells are enriched in genes
normally associated with neurogenesis. In contrast, luminal cells
preferentially express proneural genes involved in neural signal
response and processing. Consistently, primary basal cells can
spontaneously or be induced to undergo ‘neural’ development
in vitro, generating NSC-like cells. Combined with the SC
features, these transcriptional programs provide a molecular
understanding for the reported basal cell plasticity20. Third, basal
cells express high levels of Pol I-associated rRNA biogenesis
genes regulated, at least in part, by the MYC transcriptional
programme. MYC is often found overexpressed in PCa, especially
metastatic PCa46. Increased transcription of rRNA genes by Pol I
is a common feature of human cancer. Thus, our data may
suggest a rationale for treating anaplastic PCa and CRPC with Pol
I inhibition30,47, as well as targeting MYC and the MYC-mediated
transcriptional programme as a therapy for PCa. Fourth, our deep
RNA-Seq data provide a rich resource for epithelial lineage-
specific genes and markers in the human prostate. Fifth, distinct
transcriptomes in basal and luminal cells also suggest cross
communications between the two epithelial cell types, as well as
between the epithelial compartment and the underlying stroma
(Fig. 7; Supplementary Discussion). Understanding such crosstalk
will be instrumental for understanding the normal development
and tumourigenesis of prostate. Although many of the signalling
pathways mentioned in this study are poorly investigated in
normal prostate epithelial biology, their functional involvement
in
PCa
development
and
progression
has
been
widely
documented3. Last, the basal cell gene-expression profile is
linked to adverse clinical features of PCa, indicating a ‘biomarker’
value of basal cell gene signature for aggressive PCa. Importantly,
the molecular resemblance of basal cells to anaplastic PCa and
CRPC provides a common molecular understanding of these
diverse and poorly characterized aggressive PCa subtypes and
implicates basal cells as the cell-of-origin for these variant PCa
(Fig. 7d). It should be noted that while this manuscript was under
review, another paper reported similar findings in linking the
basal cell gene expression to aggressive PCa48.
Overall, by detailed transcriptome analysis of unperturbed
human benign prostatic basal and luminal cells, we uncover many
intrinsic molecular and functional differences in the two cell types
that are linked to their distinct biological properties. Further
characterizing these differences will shed fresh lights on the
aetiology of
and developing
novel
therapies against
both
adenocarcinomas and variant PCa.
Methods
Human primary prostate tissue processing and FACS. All primary human PCa
(HPCa; Supplementary Table 1) patient benign samples were obtained with the
written informed consent from the patients in accordance with federal and
institutional guidelines and with the approved IRB protocols (MDACC
LAB04-0498). HPCa processing protocol was previously described49. The final
dissociated single-cell suspension was stained with PE-CD49f (1:200, Clone GoH3,
Biolegend, San Diego, CA), APC-Cy7-CD45 (1:100, Clone HI30, eBioscience, San
Diego, CA) and APC-Trop2 (1:50, Clone 77220, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)
antibodies. FACS analysis and sorting were performed by using the BD Aria or
Fusion (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Propidium iodide was added before FACS
analysis to separate viable from dead cells. In this study, the CD45 þ immune cells
were excluded, and Trop2 þ epithelial cells were collected according to high
(basal-enriched) or low (luminal-enriched) expression of CD49f.
Deep RNA-Seq and data processing. The FACS-purified human prostate basal
(Trop2 þCD49fhi) and luminal (Trop2þCD49flo) epithelial populations were
subject to total RNA extraction by RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA
libraries were constructed by using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Preparation Kit
(Illumina, cat #: RS-122-2301), which contained Ribo-Zero Gold and allowed the
depletion of rRNA. Importantly, we only amplified our libraries with 10 PCR cycles
(instead of 15 cycles suggested by the manufacturer) to minimize amplification-
induced noise. Purified libraries were quantified using a Kapa library quantification
kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA), and then loaded on cBot (Illumina, San
Diego, CA) at a final concentration of 10pM to perform cluster generation, followed
by 2 � 76bp sequencing on HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Two libraries
were pooled and loaded on HiSeq 2000, producing an average of 400 million 76-mer
reads per lane. From each sample, we obtained about 100 million pairs of reads
(200 M reads), indicating the high depth of sequencing. We mapped the sequencing
reads to the reference human genome sequence (NCBI 36.1 [hg19] assembly) using
TopHat v2.0.9 (ref. 50) and Bowtie v2.1.0 (ref. 51). Then, we assembled the
alignments into gene transcripts and calculated their relative abundance using
Cufflinks v2.1.1 and HTSeq v0.5.3p9 (ref. 52). DESeq v1.10.1 (ref. 53) was used as a
statistical procedure to call DEGs in different samples. For quality check, MA plot
was generated using log ratios and average expression.
DEG calling and novel markers for each cell lineage. In RNA-Seq analysis, the
q value is an adjusted P value, taking into account the FDR. A P value of 0.05
indicates that 5% of all tests will be false positives. An FDR-adjusted P value of 0.05
implies that 5% of the tests found to be statistically significant (for example, by
P value) will be false positives. Therefore, FDR has a greater power than P value,
and we have mainly relied on FDR to gauge DEGs. To define DEGs, we used very
stringent statistic threshold of Z2 FC and FDR o0.05 to generate manageable lists
in order for us to perform manual curation to classify each DEG in each cell type into

11
 non-redundant functional categories. Using the above statistical threshold, we
identified a consensus of 853 DEGs upregulated in basal and 940 DEGs in luminal
cells (Supplementary Data 1). Notably, to avoid the misunderstanding that genes not
presented in the ‘stringent’ lists are not DEGs, we also listed genes that passed a
relatively loose but still statistically significant cutoff (that is, FCZ2 and Po0.05) in
Supplementary Data 1. This latter cutoff resulted in more DEGs in basal (n ¼ 1,432)
and luminal (n ¼ 1,548) cell populations (Supplementary Data 1). For example,
FGFR3 (Fig. 3a) and some Pol I complex subunits (Fig. 4e; for example, POLR1B
(P ¼ 0.006, FDR ¼ 0.069), POLR1C (P ¼ 0.006, FDR ¼ 0.069), NIP7 (P ¼ 0.005,
FDR ¼ 0.060), and ESF1 (P ¼ 0.006, FDR¼ 0.063) were not in the list with
FDRo0.05, but were in the list with Po0.05. For Fig. 3a, the reason we chose
FGFR3 (P ¼ 0.006, FDR ¼ 0.07) for demonstration was its abundance over other
differentially expressed FGFRs (for example, the mean FPKM in basal cell,
FGFR3¼ 11 versus FGFR4 ¼ 1), although its FDR was slightly above the stringent
cutoff of 0.05. To get more reliable and manageable results, we mainly used the fewer
DEGs lists for bioinformatics analysis.
For Fig. 1i, we identified the top 50 putative marker genes specific for each
lineage inferred from transcriptomes based on both relative differential expression
(FC) and absolute expression levels (normalized read counts). To increase the
confidence of this selection, we scanned the genes from the stringent DEGs lists.
Thus, the genes showing high-RNA expression (normalized read counts4300) in
both cell types, regardless of the differential FC, would be excluded due to the high
probability of protein expression in both cell types. Likewise, genes showing high
FC difference between the two cell types but having minimal RNA expression in
either cell type (that is, normalized read countso300, indicating the less
probability of robust protein expression) would also be eliminated. Note that
normalized read counts of 300 (quite high) is an arbitrary set-up to increase the
reliability of this selection. Using these criteria, we could identify 4100 genes
unique for each cell type, and the top 50 were shown in Fig. 1i. Notably, FGFR3 is
not in the top 50, but we included it in Fig. 1i owing to the experimental data and
for the reasons discussed above.
IPA and GSEA. For GO analysis, IPA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and DAVID version
6.7 (ref. 54) were used with gene symbols. GSEA was carried out by using the
curated gene sets (C2) of the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) version 4.0
provided by the Broad Institute (http://www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/)55. Note that to
dissect the profile of each cell type, the list of DEGs and entire detectable genes
derived from each sample were used for IPA and GSEA, respectively. In particular,
we followed the standard procedure as described by GSEA user guide
(http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html). The FDR
for GSEA is the estimated probability that a gene set with a given NES (normalized
enrichment score) represents a false-positive finding, and an FDRo0.25 is
considered to be statistically significant for GSEA.
Generation of signatures from PCa cell lines and literature. The majority of the
gene signatures used in this study were obtained from MSigDB, unless noted in the
main text or here. To compare our epithelial cell transcriptomic data with
gene-expression profiles of PCa cell lines, we have taken two complementary
approaches to perform GSEA. First, the RNA-Seq data of several PCa cell lines
(that is, LNCaP, Du145 and PC3) have been recently generated by our colleagues
(Drs M Estecio and C Liu). We used our well-defined basal and luminal signatures
to perform GSEA against the three PCa cell RNA-Seq data, finding enrichment of

 luminal signature in LNCaP cells (data not shown), and of basal signature in PC3
(Supplementary Fig. 7d) and Du145 (data not shown) cells. Alternatively, we
extracted the cell line signatures and then performed GSEA against our basal and
luminal RNA-Seq data. For example, the LNCaP signature (Fig. 6h) comprised
genes only expressed by LNCaP plus the genes overexpressed in LNCaP compared
with PC3, whereas the Du145 (Fig. 6k) and PC3 (data not shown) signatures were
composed of genes only expressed by them plus the overexpressed genes compared
with LNCaP. As expected, the two methods generated highly concordant results.
For data sets or signatures from published literature, we collected them from
corresponding Supplementary Information. These references and brief details of
these studies were summarized in Supplementary Table 3.
Analysis of TCGA-prostate adenocarcinoma RNA-Seq data. Currently, the
TCGA-PCa project contains a total of 498 cases, in which 497 cases have mRNA
(RNA-Seq) data. On the basis of the availability of the matched RNA-Seq and
clinical data (for example, GS and treatment information), we found 487 cases
useful for our analysis. According to the GS distribution, 45 cases are GS6, 246
GS7, 62 GS8, 131 GS9 and 3 GS10. We assigned the 3 GS10 patients into the group
of GS9 þ 10. In Supplementary Fig. 7e, to create gene signatures specific to low
(n ¼ 605 genes) and high (n ¼ 639 genes) GS patients, respectively, we used all
detectable genes (n ¼ 20,502) and objectively applied them to the shrunken
centroid supervised algorithm (PAMR)56 to perform feature selection, resulting in
1,244 genes that were associated with GS based on the prediction error.
Interestingly, among the 487 informative cases, 64 patients were treated with
HT, providing us a unique source to investigate the HT-induced changes in global
gene-expression profiles. In this treatment group, 5 are GS7, 14 GS8 and 45 GS9.
Therefore, to generate signatures tightly associated with treatment (n ¼ 435 genes)
versus no treatment (n ¼ 222 genes), and considering the majority of treated cases
were GSZ8, we only included GS8 and GS9 patients (n ¼ 59) for analysis, and used
them to compare the rest of patients (untreated n ¼ 137) with GSZ8. Again, based
on the TCGA-PCa RNA-Seq data, we applied multiple t-tests, and selected genes
whose expression values were 42.4 and testing raw P values o0.05. In total, we
observed 657 genes that could discriminate the treatment versus non-treatment
groups, in which 435 genes (signature with HT) were upregulated in the treatment
group, whereas 222 genes (signature without HT) were upregulated in non-
treatment group (Supplementary Fig. 7g).
Human primary prostate cell cultures. Either the bulk dissociated prostate
epithelial cells or the FACS-purified basal and luminal cell populations were plated
in T25 flasks precoated with PureCol (Advanced BioMatrix, San Diego, CA). We
mainly used WIT medium (Stemgent, Cambridge, MA, cat no# 00-0045-500)
supplemented with 10 mM of p160 ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 dihydrochloride
(Selleckchem, Houston, TX) in this study. WIT Medium is a serum-free defined
medium originally optimized for the robust culture of human primary mammary
epithelial cells without the need of feeder cells57. PrEGM (Prostate Epithelial Cell
Growth Medium; Lonza, Walkersville, MD) has been widely used in culturing
prostate cells in the field58; however, we chose the WIT medium for most of our
studies because we have observed that the WIT medium supports human primary
prostate cells better than PrEGM. For cell passaging, the Trypsin-EDTA for
Primary Cells (ATCC PCS-999-003) and Trypsin Neutralizing Solution (ATCC
PCS-999-004) were utilized. In this study, freshly purified primary basal cells and
short-term expanded cultures (opassage 3) were utilized in a spectrum of in vitro
and in vivo assays to characterize the epithelial biology.
Colony-formation and sphere-related assays. For colony-formation assays59, we
plated primary prostatic cells at a low density (that is, 800–1,000 cells per well) in a
precoated six-well dish, and let cells grow for 7–9 days before the visualization of
the culture by crystal violet staining. For inhibitor studies, we usually plated 1,000
cells per well in normal medium at day 1, and then added the inhibitors at varying
concentrations on day 2. For sphere-formation assays60, cells were suspended in 1:1
Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)/WIT in a total volume of 100 ml. The
mixtures were then plated around the rim of wells in a 12-well plate and allowed to
solidify in 37 �C incubator for 25 min, followed by addition of 1 ml of warm WIT
medium. Usually 7–9 days after plating, spheres with a diameter over 50 mm were
counted. For inhibitor studies in sphere-formation assays, we plated the cells at day
1, and then replaced the medium containing varying concentrations of inhibitors at
day 2. For sphere-based differentiation assays, we first established and grew the
spheres for 6–7 days in dihydrotestosterone -free medium, and then added the
inhibitors and dihydrotestosterone for another 3–5 days of prolonged culture.
Dihydrotestosterone has been shown to further induce differentiation of prostate
sphere cells60. For all above experiments, we ran a minimum of triplicate wells for
each condition and repeated experiments in different patient-derived cells
whenever feasible.
Neural sphere-formation assay. The neural sphere formation, a classical NSC
assay, was used to measure the proneural or NSC-like properties of prostatic basal
cells. Varying numbers of freshly purified human prostatic basal and luminal cells
were seeded in serum-free neural media with or without the presence of 5%
Matrigel in 96-well ultra-low attachment plates. The neural media32 is consisted of
DMEM/F12 supplemented with B27, N2, 1 � Glutamax, EGF and Pen/Strep
(all from Life Technologies, NY). In some cases (for example, see Fig. 6f), 5%
Matrigel was included in the neural media. The number and size of neural spheres
formed were generally measured 7–9 days after initial culturing.
Proneural differentiation protocols. We investigated the proneural
differentiation potential of primary basal cells using three different experimental
protocols (Fig. 5f). In the default ‘spontaneous’ protocol, basal cells were
continuously cultured for 3 weeks in WIT post confluence without medium
change. In the second protocol, 10 mM RA was introduced, as RA is widely used to
induce neural differentiation of pluripotent SCs. In the third protocol, NFs (BDNF,
GDNF and NGF-b, all at 10 ng ml � 1) and db-cAMP (0.5 mM) were added in the
medium35, as basal cells upregulated several receptors for these NFs (for example,
NGFR, NPBWR1). To phenotypically characterize the end point cultures, we
stained the cells with antibodies against well-known neural/neuronal lineage
markers (that is, GFAP, TH, MAP2, SOX2, NES, RBFOX3 (also known as NeuN),
b-Tubulin III, and OLIG2). At molecular level, a panel of neural/neuronal related
genes were analysed by qRT–PCR to reveal their expression changes along the
proneural differentiation.
Histology and immunofluorescence staining. Hematoxylin and eosin and
immunofluorescence staining was performed on either 5-mm paraffin-embedded or
OCT-frozen sections. Basic immunofluorescence procedures have been described
previously59. For staining of cell cultures, cells were first grown on glass coverslips
precoated with PureCol (Type I collagen; Advanced BioMatrix, San Diego, CA),
then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde containing 5% sucrose (pH 7.2).
The coverslips or the tissue slides were blocked with Background Sniper
(Biocare Medical, Concord, CA) for 30 min, followed by primary antibody
incubation overnight at 4 �C. Primary antibodies and dilutions used are listed in
Supplementary Table 4. Slides were then incubated with secondary antibodies
(diluted 1:700 in antibody diluent (Dako, Carpinteria, CA)) labelled with Alexa
Fluor 488 or 594 (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Grand Island, NY). After washing
(3 � ) with PBS, sections were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade
Mountant (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Immunohistochemistry and
immunofluorescence images were captured by Olympus IX71 and Zeiss LSM510
META confocal microscope, respectively.
RNA isolation and quantitative RT–PCR. Total RNA was isolated from cells
using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The first-strand cDNA synthesis
was achieved by reverse transcription of RNA using random hexamers and
SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT–PCR was
performed using the iQ SYBR Green supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA) on a
7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The
primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 4. Normally, the
housekeeping gene GAPDH or b-actin was used as internal control for gene-
expression normalization. In particular, B2M gene was used as a control for rRNA-
related qRT–PCR analysis, since its transcription was not affected by perturbation
of either Pol I or MYC activities47.
Migration and invasion assays. Cell migration and invasion assays were
performed using Boyden chambers (CellBiolabs, San Diego, CA) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, freshly purified basal and luminal cell
populations were loaded into the chambers and cultured in media for 2 days, and
the results were visualized by PROTOCOL Hema 3 staining kit (Fisher Scientific,
Pittsburgh, PA). Images of the membranes were captured by Olympus IX71. Data
was quantified based on the cell number counting of at least five � 20 images. To
test the response of prostatic basal cells to neural signals (Supplementary Fig. 6b),
primary basal cells were incubated in the chambers in media with or without neural
growth factors (20 ng ml � 1 of BDNF/GDNF/NGF-b, 500 mM GABA and 0.5 mM
db-cAMP).
siRNA-mediated knock-down experiments. To knock down the genes of interest,
we used the Trilencer-27 Human siRNA system (OriGene, Rockville, MD). For each
gene (FGFR3 (ID2261), NOTCH1 (ID4851), HMGA2 (ID8091), CDH13 (ID1012),
CTNNB1 (ID1499) and CD3EAP (ID10849), 3 unique 27mer siRNA duplexes were
used. When passaging, the primary human prostatic basal cells were plated in
12-well plates at a desired density and transfected with 400nM siRNA oligonu-
cleotides or non-targeting controls. Due to the limited transfection efficiency in
primary cells, we usually transfected the cells twice at 12 and 24h after plating.
Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine RNAi MAX in WIT medium.
Knock-down efficiency was determined by qPCR at 48h post transfection. At
48–72h after transfection, cells were trypsinized, counted and seeded in 6-well plates
for colony-formation and in 12-well plates for sphere-formation assays. The
sequences for all siRNAs are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

 Lentiviral shRNA-mediated knock-down experiments. To establish long-term
knock-down experiments, the GIPz-shRNA lentiviral vectors targeting NRG1
(Clone ID: V2LHS_84774 and V3LHS_344002) and NGFR (Clone ID:
V2LHS_152261 and V2LHS_152259) were purchased from the MDACC ShRNA
and ORFeome Core Facility. Two shRNAs were used to target each gene
(Supplementary Table 5). Basic lentiviral procedures were previously described2.
Lentivirus was produced in 293FT packaging cells and titres determined using GFP
positivity in 293FT cells. Primary prostate cells were infected, generally, at a
multiplicity of infection of 15 and collected for experiments 48–72 h post-infection.
Cells were trypsinized, counted and seeded in 6-well plates for colony-formation
and in 12-well plates for sphere-formation assays. Knock-down efficiency of
shRNAs on target genes was determined by qPCR.
Reproducibility of experiments. No statistical method was used to predetermine
sample size for all experiments. Since joining the group, D.Z. has worked on 475
HPCa samples. For immunofluorescence staining, including Figs 1i, 2g,f, 3a, 5a,e,h
and Supplementary Figs 1h, 2a,b,d, 5c,f,h, 6a,b, at least 2 different HPCa samples
were used, and multiple fields were imaged on each slide. For immunohis-
tochemistry analysis (for example, Supplementary Fig. 1f,g), multiple images were
taken from different fields on each slide, and 1 or 2 HPCa samples were utilized.
For migration and invasion assays (for example, Fig. 2h and Supplementary Figs 2e
and 6b), 2 technical replicates were included for each cell type, and experiments
were repeated in 2–3 different biological samples. In particular, 5–6 random high
magnification ( � 20) images were captured for each membrane and used for
quantifications of cell numbers. For all qPCR analysis, three technical replicates
were included for each sample, and data shown for qPCR analysis was from one
experiment that was representative of more than equal to two independent
experiments. In addition to repeat experiments using different biological samples
when feasible, the drug treatment (for example, inhibitors), siRNA and
shRNA-mediated knock-down, and many other experiments were generally
repeated at different passages (time points) in the same patient-derived primary
prostate epithelial cells. For all sphere-formation assays, 3–6 technical replicates
were included for each sample.
Statistical analysis. Graphpad Prism software was used to calculate mean and
standard deviation. In general, Student’s t-test was used to calculate the statistical
significance between the two groups of data. Po0.05 is considered statistically
significant.
