Development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against
HIV-1 usually requires prolonged infection and induction of Abs
with unusual features, such as long heavy-chain complementarity-
determining region 3 (HCDR3) loops. Here we sought to determine
whether the repertoires of HIV-1–naïve individuals contain Abs
with long HCDR3 loops that could mediate HIV-1 neutralization.
We interrogated at massive scale the structural properties of long
Ab HCDR3 loops in HIV-1–naïve donors, searching for structured
HCDR3s similar to those of the HIV-1 bnAb PG9. We determined
the nucleotide sequences encoding 2.3 × 107 unique HCDR3 amino
acid regions from 70 different HIV-1–naïve donors. Of the 26,917
HCDR3 loops with 30-amino acid length identified, we tested 30
for further study that were predicted to have PG9-like structure
when chimerized onto PG9. Three of these 30 PG9 chimeras bound
to the HIV-1 gp120 monomer, and two were neutralizing. In addi-
tion, we found 14 naturally occurring HCDR3 sequences that ac-
quired the ability to bind to the HIV-1 gp120 monomer when
adding 2- to 7-amino acid mutations via computational design. Of
those 14 designed Abs, 8 neutralized HIV-1, with IC50 values ranging
from 0.7 to 98 μg/mL. These data suggest that the repertoire of HIV-
1–naïve individuals contains rare B cells that encode HCDR3 loops
that bind or neutralize HIV-1 when presented on a PG9 background
with relatively few or no additional mutations. Long HCDR3 se-
quences are present in the HIV-naïve B-cell repertoire, suggesting
that this class of bnAbs is a favorable target for rationally designed
preventative vaccine efforts.

E
licitation of broadly neutralizing Abs (bnAbs) against HIV
type 1 (HIV-1) is one of the greatest challenges in modern
vaccinology (1). A bnAb response occurs at various levels in most
HIV-1–infected individuals and is extraordinarily broad and potent
in a minor subset of subjects (2, 3). These bnAbs typically arise only
a year or more after infection and peak at ∼3–4 y after infection
(4). Recent advances in donor selection from cohorts of chronically
infected patients, novel screening methods, and Ab isolation tech-
nologies have allowed identification of dozens of new bnAbs specific
to the envelope glycoproteins gp120/gp41 of HIV-1 (5). Although
bnAbs of interest have been isolated using different strategies, the
genes encoding these bnAbs often share certain distinctive and
unusual features such as excessively large amounts of somatic mu-
tation or very long heavy-chain complementarity-determining region
3 (HCDR3) structures (6). The requirement for these unusual Ab
genetic features as the basis of formation of HIV-1 bnAbs is an
obstacle to vaccination, because conventional vaccines fail to induce
a high frequency of Abs with such characteristics.
Although studies based on bnAb isolation have revealed new
targets for immunogen design and have been useful for experi-
mental therapeutic efficacy (7), the design of an effective vaccine
against HIV-1 has remained elusive (8). There is a structural class
of bnAbs represented by PG9 and PG16 whose members have long
protruding anionic HCDR3 structures that form beta-sheet ham-
merheads and target the V1/V2 epitope (9–11). These bnAbs can
be very broad and potent, neutralizing up to ∼80% of viral variants
tested (12). This class of Abs often has lower levels of somatic
mutation relative to other bnAbs, making them attractive targets
for a rational vaccine design strategy. However, the genetic basis
for formation of these types of long HCDR3s is poorly understood.
PG9 was isolated from an HIV-1–infected individual, but here we
sought to determine whether any Ab sequences in the HIV-1–naïve
donor B-cell repertoire encode long HCDR3 structures that can
bind and neutralize HIV-1 when presented in the context of the
naturally occurring PG9 antibody. The presence of such Abs in the
HIV-1–naïve repertoire might suggest optimal paratope targets for
vaccine B-cell priming by rationally designed HIV-1 envelope
(Env) antigens. To search for HIV-1–reactive HCDR3 sequences
in the HIV-1–naïve repertoire, we developed an experimental and
bioinformatics pipeline that coupled next-generation sequencing
with 3D structure prediction and functional design and then
Significance
When HIV neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses occur, they are
often mediated by Abs with exceptional levels of somatic muta-
tion. An exception are HIV neutralizing Abs that feature long
heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) re-
gions, such as the Ab PG9. Relative to many other HIV broadly
neutralizing Abs (bnAbs), PG9 has fewer somatic mutations than
most potent bnAbs. Here we used deep-sequencing and compu-
tational methods to identify a panel of HCDR3 sequences in HIV-
naïve donors that mediated binding and neutralization of HIV by
mimicking the bnAb PG9 long HCDR3 region when expressed in
the context of the rest of the PG9 antibody sequence. Thus, it may
be possible for structure-based vaccine design efforts to engage
long HCDR3s available in the HIV-naïve Ab repertoire and elicit
a neutralizing response.

 validated the findings with experimental characterization (Fig. 1).
We found two naturally occurring HCDR3 sequences from 2 dif-
ferent donors of 70 studied that were predicted to adopt a PG9-like
hammerhead conformation and were able to bind and neutralize
PG9-susceptible viruses. In addition, we used computational design
to mimic the process of maturation by somatic mutation of HCDR3
sequences from the HIV-1–naïve repertoire that were predicted to
adopt a PG9-like hammerhead conformation. We identified two to
seven mutations in eight different HCDR3 sequences that facili-
tated neutralization of HIV when grafted on a PG9 Ab background.
Results
To obtain a large number of long HCDR3 sequences for this
analysis, we collected white blood cells from the leukoreduction
filters of 70 different HIV-1–negative blood donors from the
Nashville, TN, American Red Cross. Using a primer design that
amplified the HCDR3 sequence from the Ab heavy chain (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1), we generated amplicons for sequence analysis
on the Illumina HiSeq platform by RT-PCR. This approach gen-
erated 2.3 × 107 unique HCDR3 amino acid sequences (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S2). The mean length for the HCDR3 sequences was
16.4 ± 4.0 amino acids. Because the amplicon sequence started
from the framework 3 region, only assignments of VH families and
not VH genes could be resolved unambiguously. However, the
distribution of gene assignments (SI Appendix, Fig. S3) matched
previous observations of gene distribution in the repertoire of
healthy donors using analysis of full-length Ab variable gene se-
quences (13). IGHD3-3 and IGHJ6 gene segments were used more
frequently as the length of the HCDR3 increased.
Structural Modeling Provides a Rapid Heuristic to Predict PG9
Mimicry. To facilitate large-scale structural modeling of HCDR3s,
we only considered sequences with HCDR3 loops that were the
same length as PG9 (30 amino acids). This approach identified
26,917 unique sequences to be examined for PG9-like structure
and activity. For efficient identification of the sequences most likely
to exhibit a PG9-like HCDR3 structure, we developed a testing
heuristic we designated a position-specific structure scoring matrix
(P3SM) that used ROSETTA energy scores for a relatively small
number of sequences and extrapolated those predictions to the
whole sequence pool. In this way, we could explore a large se-
quence library to identify a subset of sequences with a higher
likelihood of mimicking PG9 structure, even though it was not
feasible computationally to predict the structure of all members
using ROSETTA. First, we obtained 4,000 randomly selected se-
quences from the pool of 26,917 HCDR3s with 30-amino acid
length. Next, the naturally occurring HCDR3 sequences were
threaded over the wild-type PG9 (PG9wt) structure after removing
the Env V1/V2 antigen from the known Ab–antigen structure
[Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 3U4E (11); Movie S1]. We
then energetically minimized the sequence to check the “tolerance”
for maintaining the PG9wt hammerhead structure (Movie S2).
HCDR3 sequences were evaluated for structural mimicry of PG9wt
by how well they retained the PG9wt topology, measured as rmsd to
PG9wt, and the sequence tolerance to the PG9 topology, measured
as the ROSETTA energy (Fig. 2A). We found three different distri-
butions for the energetically minimized sequences: (i) sequences
that retained PG9wt HCDR3 topology but had unfavorable ener-
gies (Fig. 2B); (ii) sequences that had favorable energies but did not
retain PG9wt topology (Fig. 2C); or (iii) sequences that retained
both HCDR3 topology and favorable energy scores (Fig. 2D).
ROSETTA allows examination of scoring terms on a per-residue
basis (14). Therefore, we filled the P3SM with an average energy
for each amino acid identity seen in the naturally occurring se-
quences. Fig. 2E shows the P3SM analysis results as a heat map,
where each amino acid identity was assigned an average energy
as calculated by ROSETTA. For example, positions 100C and 100D
preferred glycine, as these positions have a very narrow range of

Summary of methodology. The methodology used was a combination of computational (dashed borders) and experimental procedures (solid borders).
(A) HIV-naïve donor blood was collected from 70 adult donors and the HCDR3 genetic repertoire was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq platform. PBMC, peripheral
blood mononuclear cells. (B) The raw sequences were reconstructed and analyzed against germ-line databases using custom software. The sequences were parsed
and stored in optimized databases to handle the large quantity of Ab sequences. (C) HCDR3 sequences were chosen by length and tested for mimicry of the PG9
HCDR3 structure using the ROSETTA software suite. Iterative rounds of minimization, docking, and design, followed by rigorous statistical analysis, allowed for a
robust prediction of potential candidates from the HIV-naïve donor repertoire that may bind or neutralize HIV. (D) A tractable number of sequences was
synthesized and tested experimentally through biophysical characterization and binding and neutralization studies against HIV.

Screening and redesign of HIV-1–naïve donor HCDR3 sequences using ROSETTA. (A) Four thousand randomly selected sequences that encode HCDR3s that are
30 amino acids in length were selected from next-generation amplicon sequence libraries generated from the blood samples of 70 HIV-naïve donors. The predicted
amino acid sequences were threaded onto the PG9wt backbone structure (PDB ID code 3U4E) and their tolerance to PG9wt as a measure of overall energy (y axis) and
retention of PG9wt HCDR3 structure (x axis) were predicted. Abs from HIV-1–naïve donors are shown in black. PG9wt and PG16wt are shown in blue and red,
respectively. (B–D) Three outcomes were produced, as follows. (B) Sequences that retained the HCDR3 topology but increased in energy. (C) Sequences that lowered
in energy but could not retain the HCDR3 topology. (D) Sequences that could retain the topology and had a favorable energy score. The color of each amino acid
corresponds to a position on a blue–red scale for favorable to unfavorable energy, as assessed by ROSETTA. (E) Each of the sequences from A constructs a position-
specific structure-scoring matrix (P3SM), where each of the HCDR3 positions is shown on the y axis and each amino acid identity is shown on the x axis. The average
energy of each amino acid for each position fills the matrix. The topology of the HCDR3 loop is shown as a reference. (F) The top 100 sequences clustered into nine
groups, designated clusters B–J, and five additional sequences that did not fit a group, “independent groups” 1–5 (designated IG1–5). A consensus sequence for each
group is aligned with PG9. (G) The dendrogram for each of the sequences shows the clustering. (H) Scoring of the top 100 sequences assessed by ROSETTA is shown as a
function of binding energy (x axis) and total energy (y axis). (I) The energetic gap was recovered by minimal redesign of wt sequences (circles) and produced se-
quences with a few mutations (triangles). The wt sequences were characterized for sequence recovery (red–blue scale).

 torsional angles that accommodate the hinge region of the
hammerhead.
Next, all 26,917 sequences with 30-amino acid length were rank-
ordered by their P3SM score. We ranked the P3SM scores assuming
that the PG9wt sequence should be the top-scoring sequence tested.
We found that PG9wt ranked 92nd (0.4%), scoring 3.82 ROSETTA
energy units (REUs) worse than the best sequence (SI Appendix,
Fig. S5C). We rationalized that PG9wt should have a lower energy
than all sequences from the naïve repertoire and therefore in-
troduced 3.82 REUs as a minimum error margin of the P3SM
score. To avoid excluding potential hit sequences, we selected the
top 1,000 HCDR3 sequences that scored within ±3.82 REUs of
PG9wt for further analysis. These sequences were submitted to a
more accurate ROSETTA energy evaluation protocol that was too
time-consuming to apply to all 26,917 sequences (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6) (15, 16). In this protocol, the full complex of PG9wt bound to
the HIV-1 CAP45 strain V1/V2 scaffold (PDB ID code 3U4E) was
used in modeling. Glycans at positions 156 and 160 (lab-adapted
HIV strain HXBc2 numbering) were reconstituted for evaluation by
the ROSETTA scoring function (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). To include
parts of the scoring function that selected for other HCDR3 se-
quences in which PG9 and PG16 were in the top 10% of the scores
but not necessarily the top-scoring, we found that scores affiliated
with glycan modification, HCDR3 contribution to binding energy,
and the shift in Cα rmsd also ranked PG9 and PG16 HCDR3s
favorable. Because these numbers are not directly comparable, the
Z-score metric was introduced to rescale each score and combine
them into one composite metric. Using this weighted Z-score
metric, 100 models were generated for each sequence (SI Appendix,
Materials and Methods and Fig. S7). The top 100 sequences from the
weighted Z-score metric were used for further analysis. Using
Clustal W2 (17), we performed a multiple sequence analysis and
subsequent phylogeny construction to see whether sequences
identified in the rank order were related. Indeed, the sequences
clustered to nine unique groups (clusters B–J, containing ≥2
members) and five independent group clusters with a single mem-
ber (designated IG1–5, Fig. 2 F and G and SI Appendix, Table S1).
Antibody Design Compensates for Incomplete PG9 Mimicry by Naturally
Occurring HCDR3 Sequences. As seen in Fig. 2H, an energetic gap
occurred between each of the HIV-1–naïve donor sequences and
PG9/16 when comparing thermodynamic stability in the PG9wt
conformation and predicted binding affinity to the HIV-1 CAP45
strain V1/V2 scaffold. This gap generally was caused by the effect
of a few amino acids in the naturally occurring wt sequence that
scored poorly when adopting the PG9wt topology. This gap is
expected, as no HCDR3 sequence from the HIV-naïve repertoire
was optimized to adopt PG9wt topology via somatic mutations. To
mimic this maturation process and remove the energetic gap, we
redesigned the starting sequences of the HCDR3s to simulta-
neously optimize stability and binding. To limit the number of
mutations introduced by ROSETTADESIGN, an energetic bonus to
the starting sequence was introduced (18). As a result, each of the
HCDR3 variants mutated between 30% and 60% of the amino
acids (Fig. 2I). We visually inspected mutations proposed by
ROSETTA and reverted some that appeared not motivated by
structural context. This process is needed, as the ROSETTA scoring
function is limited in accuracy by its pairwise decomposability and a
distance cutoff when considering interactions. Further, the design
process is stochastic and might terminate in local energetic minima.
The visual inspection and triage ensure that only necessary muta-
tions are introduced (SI Appendix, Fig. S8).
HIV-Naïve Donor HCDR3 Sequences on a PG9 Background Enable HIV
gp120 Binding. The top-scoring wt sequence from each cluster and
a combination of designed sequences provided a total of 84
HCDR3 predicted PG9-like sequences that we synthesized and
cloned into a plasmid encoding PG9wt, thus replacing the PG9wt
HCDR3 with an HIV-1–naïve donor HCDR3 sequence (SI Ap-
pendix, Table S2). These expression experiments resulted in pre-
dicted PG9-like chimeras in which the HCDR3 from the naïve or
designed sequences was placed onto a PG9 background. The PG9
background retains 17 mutations in the VH region and 13 mutations
in the VL region. We screened each of the variant Ab supernatants
for level of expression of IgG and for binding to HIV-1 using a
mixture of eight gp120 monomers as antigen in an ELISA binding
assay. Ab variants were named by clone number and how many
mutations away from the wt sequence each contained. For example,
VU2383_5MUTD is Vanderbilt University (VU) site HIV-1–naïve
donor wt clone 2383 derived from an HCDR3 sequence with five
mutations; the letter D indicates that this was the fourth 5MUT
variant in sequence that was tested in this group of antibody vari-
ants. If the variant Ab clone expressed IgG and that Ab bound to
Env antigens in the gp120 ELISA at the maximum endpoint titer, it
was considered further (SI Appendix, Fig. S9 and Table S3).
Fourteen of the 84 Abs failed to express recombinantly, and 32 of
the 84 Abs expressed but did not bind at the maximum supernatant
titer. These findings resulted in the identification of 30 predicted
PG9-like HCDR3 variant sequences that were evaluated for bind-
ing and neutralization on a larger scale (Fig. 3A). Of the 30 se-
quences evaluated, 16 bound at least one of the gp120 monomers at
a concentration less than 100 μg/mL. We chose 100 μg/mL as our
cutoff for binding, as this level was found previously to be less than
the biologically relevant cutoff of 1 μM KD necessary to produce an
immune response (19–21). Of those, 2 were based on completely wt
HIV-1–naïve donor HCDR3 sequences (VU4322, VU65128) and
14 clones had two to seven altered amino acids that were designed
by ROSETTA. As expected, the HIV-1 gp120 monomers recognized
most frequently by the HCDR3 variant Abs were derived from
HIV-1 strains BaL.01 and ZM109F.PB, which were determined
previously to bind PG9wt strongly (11). The Ab with the tightest
binding (VU28693_5MUT, with an EC50 of 1.03 μg/mL) had five
mutations (17% mutated) compared with the originally isolated
HIV-1–naïve donor HCDR3 sequence. The Ab based on a wt HIV-
1–naïve donor HCDR3 sequence with the tightest binding that had
no designed mutations, designated VU42232, bound to HIV-1
strain ZM109F.PB gp120 with an EC50 of 3.75 μg/mL. The Ab
that exhibited the broadest reactivity for diverse strains was
VU28693_2MUTB, which bound four out of the eight gp120
variants tested (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Table S4).
HIV-Naïve Donor HCDR3 Sequences on a PG9 Background Enable HIV
Neutralization. For neutralization screening, Abs VU65128 and
VU4946, with wt HCDR3 sequences, neutralized at an IC50 of
17.7 and 46.1 μg/mL, respectively. Interestingly, although VU4946
neutralized, it did not bind any of the gp120 monomers tested, a
phenomenon that has been observed for this class of Ab (11, 22).
Conversely, VU42232 bound strain BaL.01 and ZM109F.PB gp120
at 3.4 and 3.2 μg/mL, respectively, but did not neutralize any of the
variants tested. A group of nine minimally designed HCDR3 se-
quences neutralized at least one of the variants tested at concen-
trations ranging from 0.7 to 98 μg/mL. The Ab with the most potent
neutralizing activity for any clone tested was VU2383_3MUTD,
which neutralized the HIV-1 strain CAP45.2.00.G3 with an IC50 of
0.7 μg/mL. The Ab with the broadest neutralizing activity for di-
verse strains was VU30400_3MUTB, which neutralized BaL.26,
ZM109F.PB4, or CAP45.2.00.G3 with IC50 values of 24, 29, or
21 μg/mL, respectively (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Table S5).
The Abs we expressed were modeled to interact with HIV-1 due
to a PG9-like HCDR3 structure. However, the crystal structure of
PG9wt in complex with the CAP45.2.00.G3 V1/V2 scaffold
revealed that there are additional contacts besides the HCDR3
that were involved in binding. We explored whether such contacts
mediated the binding and neutralization observed in HIV-1–naïve
donor-origin Abs, rather than the HCDR3 region. To test this, we
expressed a variant Ab designated PG9 ΔCDR3 in which the
HCDR3 was replaced with a GGG motif. This variant did not bind
or neutralize any of the HIV strains tested. We also screened all
variant Abs for epitope-specific neutralization by testing activity
against the RHPA.N160A virus containing an N160A Env change
that removes a glycosylation site required for PG9wt neutralizing
activity (23). With the exception of one variant (VU30400_7MUT),

 the variants did not neutralize the N160A knockout mutant (Fig.
3A and SI Appendix, Table S5).
We explored the molecular basis for the functional and structural
convergence of the clones on mimicry of PG9. Surprisingly, there
was little sequence homology between the HCDR3s of HIV-1–
naïve donor-reactive clones and that of PG9wt (Fig. 3B). With the
exception of positions 93–95, 100C–E, and 100O–103, the sequence
of each variant used a unique set of mutations that were predicted
to achieve the hammerhead HCDR3 configuration and enable
binding to HIV-1 gp120. We considered the success of the design
process used here to introduce a minimal number of beneficial
mutations into HCDR3 regions with suboptimal interaction, a
process that mimics affinity maturation through somatic hyper-
mutation. For instance, the Ab encoded by the wt HCDR3 clone
for cluster E, termed VU11631, was found to express poorly in
culture. In contrast, several minimally designed variant Abs, termed
VU28693_2MUTB and VU28693_5MUT, were found to express,
bind gp120, and neutralize HIV-1. VU28693_Y100DN was pre-
dicted to pack more densely and form hydrogen bonds with K168
of the CAP45 V1/V2 interface, which mimics the interaction of
PG9wt. VU28693_L100GH exposes a polar group to the solvent
face while retaining burial of the hydrophobic portion, and
VU28693_L100LN uses the terminal amine group to point toward
solvent space and create a hydrogen bond with T163 of the V1/V2
interface (SI Appendix, Fig. S11A). VU15053_W100BR is predicted
to form two hydrogen bonds with the V1/V2 glycan at position
N160, whereas VU15053_R100LD forms an additional three hy-
drogen bonds that are out of the range of the wt arginine
(SI Appendix, Fig. S11B).
Discussion
A protective vaccine against HIV-1 likely will need to elicit a
broadly neutralizing serum Ab response (24–29). Here we in-
terrogated the long HCDR3 repertoire, before infection, using
samples from a cohort of HIV-1–naïve donors, maximizing the
sequence pool and diversity. The combination of computational
modeling with bioinformatically driven heuristics allowed the
screening of a large number of HIV-1–naïve Ab sequences. Al-
though computational modeling of all 26,917 sequences might be
feasible in principle, we sought to establish a method that could be
extended to an orders-of-magnitude greater number of sequences
that will result from the rapidly growing output of evolving
amplicon sequencing technologies (30). We found that three out of
the seven wt sequences we tested bound to HIV gp120, and each of
these was derived from a unique donor. We chose the recombinant
gp120 monomer to test the binding of these Abs. Note that some
neutralizing Abs in this class fail to bind the gp120 recombinant
monomer. This finding has been attributed to the fact that the
epitope for Abs interacting with two protomers in the intact HIV
BG505 trimer on the envelope is not fully recapitulated in a gp120
monomer (31). In addition, the gp120 monomer is differentially
glycosylated from the native trimeric envelope (32). PG16, a long
HCDR3-type Ab related to PG9, has been found to be more se-
lective in the glycan types to which it binds and neutralizes (33).
This finding is attributed to subtle mutations that interact with the
branched sugars at positions 156 and 160.
Many Abs capable of adopting a PG9-like structure might be
missed by a sequence-only search strategy. Instead, we sought to
use structure-based homology prediction as a metric to assess
predicted PG9-like HCDR3 activity. We attribute this finding to
the many sequence-independent interactions found in PG9 and
PG16 Ab complexes (11). In this way, a sequence may only need
to adopt the rigid secondary structure found in the HCDR3
hammerhead structure.
We note the limitations of using only HCDR3 sequences rather
than the full VH gene sequence or paired heavy–light chain variable
gene sequences. We chose a method with shorter read length to
achieve sequencing depth, as 30-amino acid-length HCDR3 se-
quences are infrequent in the human repertoire, and a large Ab
sequence pool would be needed to find HCDR3 sequences with
anything resembling predicted PG9-like HCDR3 activity. Indeed,
we found two wt HCDR3 sequences with neutralizing activity, de-
rived from 26,917 sequences that were potential candidates based
on length from the HCDR3 repertoire. In the scope of this study,
only 26,917 possible sequences were tested. We expect that the
typical B-cell repertoire has more HCDR3 sequences containing
a 30-amino acid-length HCDR3 than this representative sam-
pling. With the exception of two Abs (VU30400_G_7MUT and
VU2383_3MUTD), all of the predicted PG9-like HCDR3 se-
quences failed to neutralize RHPA.N160A, a PG9 epitope knock-
out mutation that removes the N160 glycan site. From this, we
hypothesize that the HCDR3 sequences from the HIV-naïve rep-
ertoire work synergistically with the mature heavy- and light-chain
mutations of PG9 by contributing to binding or neutralization.
Recently, Andrabi et al. reported work on viral variants that
bind PG9 variant Abs with VH/VL reverted mutations. Results in
those studies show that the common VH germ-line genes in PG9
and CAP256.09 Abs play a vital role in the neutralization of sen-
sitive viruses and that their ability to neutralize these viruses is not a
function of HCDR3 alone. Instead, neutralization appeared to
derive from interactions mediated by both the HCDR3 (especially
the YYD amino acid motif from the common germ-line D gene)

Experimental characterization of HIV-1–naïve donor HCDR3 sequences
that bind and neutralize HIV. (A) A blue–yellow–red heat map corresponding
to the EC50 or IC50 for binding or neutralization, respectively. Values in white
indicate an EC50 or IC50 higher than the top concentration of 100 μg/mL, and
are shown for all characterized Ab variants that expressed at sufficient con-
centration for analysis. The viral variants used in binding and neutralization
assays are shown at the top whereas the HCDR3 variants and parental Ab
clusters are shown on the side. (B) The Ab variants that bound at a con-
centration less than 20 μg/mL are shown in a multiple sequence alignment.
The black–gray scale indicates similarity to PG9. The EC50 value is shown.
All underlined amino acid sequences were redesigned from the parental
Ab sequence.

Willis et al.
 and residues in VH-encoded regions (including residues that are
both germ line-encoded and somatic mutations). These investiga-
tors found that 16 of 26 mutations are necessary to bind a majority
of the viral variants they tested, suggesting that some but not all of
the somatic mutations outside of the HCDR3 of PG9 are required
for recognition of HIV (34).
This work has several implications for HIV-1 vaccine design. The
data reveal that some HIV-1–naïve donors possess B cells in the
preimmune repertoire whose HCDR3 structure is predicted to
mimic that of a class of V1/V2 binding Abs that is known to exhibit
broad and potent HIV-1 neutralizing activity, when configured in
the context of the naturally occurring PG9 antibody. Recently, a
genetic pathway for the development of V1/V2 binding Abs with
long HCDR3s has been elucidated for potent bnAbs (22), revealing
a very large number and diversity of mutations from the unmutated
common ancestor in the HCDR3 associated with neutralization
breadth of diverse strains. That study suggests a large range of Ab
sequence diversity in clonal lineages that can converge onto one
epitope while maximizing breadth and potency. In the scope of this
study, only 2 out of the 26,917 sequences from two different donors
were found to have neutralizing activity against HIV. However, only
26,917 HCDR3 sequences of 30-amino acid length were identified
in the deep-sequencing reactions used here, a much smaller number
than the pool size of such antibodies that is estimated for the entire
naïve B-cell repertoire in a person. Targeting the diverse repertoire
of Abs with PG9-like HCDR3 structures and function in the pre-
immune repertoire may offer a more tractable focus for vaccination,
because lower numbers of somatic mutations may be required for
HIV-1 recognition by these clones. The data suggest that induction
of B cells encoding long HCDR3s from the HIV-naïve repertoire is
an attractive target for structure-based vaccine design.
Materials and Methods
HCDR3 amplicons were generated from RNA that was extracted from the white
blood cells of 70 HIV-uninfected individuals. Use of deidentified cells obtained
from discarded leukofiltration filters was approved by the Vanderbilt and Red
Cross Institutional Review Boards. Reads (5.14 × 107) were obtained from using
the Illumina HiSeq platform. Sequence tolerance for PG9 was modeled using
the PG9 complex with scaffolded V1/V2 CAP45 (PDB ID code 3U4E) and the
modeling suite ROSETTA. Additional HCDR3 sequences were designed using
ROSETTA, starting with healthy donor HCDR3 sequences as template. Four
HCDR3 sequences were synthesized and chimerized with the mature PG9 se-
quence. Chimeric Abs were tested for binding or neutralization using a gp120
ELISA or luciferase reporter TZM-bl assay, respectively. For full methods, see SI
