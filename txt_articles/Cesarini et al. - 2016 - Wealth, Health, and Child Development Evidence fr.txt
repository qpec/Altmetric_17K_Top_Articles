We use administrative data on Swedish lottery players to estimate the
causal impact of substantial wealth shocks on players’ own health and their
children’s health and developmental outcomes. Our estimation sample is large,
virtually free of attrition, and allows us to control for the factors conditional on
which the prizes were randomly assigned. In adults, we find no evidence that
wealth impacts mortality or health care utilization, with the possible exception
of a small reduction in the consumption of mental health drugs. Our estimates
allow us to rule out effects on 10-year mortality one sixth as large as the cross-
sectional wealth-mortality gradient. In our intergenerational analyses, we find
that wealth increases children’s health care utilization in the years following
the lottery and may also reduce obesity risk. The effects on most other child
outcomes, including drug consumption, scholastic performance, and skills, can
usually be bounded to a tight interval around zero. Overall, our findings sug-
gest that in affluent countries with extensive social safety nets, causal effects of
wealth are not a major source of the wealth-mortality gradients, nor of the
observed relationships between child developmental outcomes and household
income. JEL Codes: I10, I14, J24.

 I. Introduction
At every stage in the life cycle, health is robustly associated
with various markers for socioeconomic status (SES), such as
income,
educational
attainment,
and
occupational
prestige
(Smith 1999; Currie 2009; Cutler, Lleras-Muney, and Vogl
2012). These relationships manifest themselves early. For exam-
ple, children from low-income households weigh less at birth, are
more likely to be born prematurely, and are increasingly at
greater risk for chronic health conditions as they age (Brooks-
Gunn and Duncan 1997; Newacheck and Halfon 1998; Currie
2009). Childhood health is in turn positively related to a
number of later outcomes, including skills, scholastic achieve-
ment, and adult economic status (Currie 2009; Smith 2009). In
adults, it is also a well-established fact that individuals with
higher incomes enjoy better health outcomes (Smith 1999;
Deaton 2002). Descriptive research has uncovered these positive
relationships in many different countries and time periods and in
many different subpopulations (Smith 1999; Deaton 2002; Cutler,
Lleras-Muney, and Vogl 2012).
Although the existence of these gradients for adult health
and child outcomes is not controversial, credibly elucidating
their underlying causal pathways has proven challenging, as con-
cerns about reverse causation and omitted variable bias often
loom large (Mayer 1998; Deaton 2002; Currie 2009; Chandra
and Vogl 2010; Baker and Stabile 2012; Cutler, Lleras-Muney,
and Vogl 2012). One review article on the causes and conse-
quences of early childhood health notes that ‘‘the number of stud-
ies associating poor child outcomes with low SES far exceeds the
number that make substantive progress on this difficult question
of causality’’ (Baker and Stabile 2012, p. 8). Writing about the
adult health gradient, Deaton concludes that ‘‘there is no general
agreement about [its] causes . . . [and] what apparent agreement
there is is sometimes better supported by repeated assertion than
by solid evidence’’ (2002, p. 15).
In this article, we use the randomized assignment of lottery
prizes in three samples of Swedish lottery players to estimate the
causal effect of wealth on players’ health and their children’s
health and development. The prizes vary in magnitude, but
75% of the combined prize pool is accounted for by prizes whose
value is in the range 1 to 40 Swedish median annual disposable
incomes (approximately $20,000 to $800,000). The estimates we

 report are therefore useful for testing and refining hypotheses
about the sources of the relationship between permanent
income and the outcomes we consider.
Our study has three key methodological features that enable
us to make stronger inferences about the causal impact of wealth
than previous lottery studies evaluating the effect of wealth on
health (Lindahl 2005; Gardner and Oswald 2007; van Kippersluis
and Galama 2013; Apouey and Clark 2015) and health expendi-
ture (Cheng, Costa-i-Font, and Powdthavee 2015). First, we
observe the factors conditional on which the lottery wealth is ran-
domly assigned, allowing us to leverage only the portion of lot-
tery-induced variation in wealth that is exogenous. Second, the
size of the prize pool is almost $1 billion—two orders of magnitude
larger than in any previous study of lottery players’ health. Third,
Sweden’s high-quality administrative data allow us to observe a
rich set of outcomes, some of which are realized over 20 years
after the event, in a virtually attrition-free sample. In addition,
our data allow us to address many (but not all) concerns that are
often voiced about the external validity of studies of lottery
players.
We conduct two sets of analyses. In the adult analyses, the
primary outcomes of interest are total and cause-specific mortal-
ities, and we also report estimates of the impact of wealth on an
array of hospitalization and drug prescription variables. Several
of the specific outcomes considered in the adult analyses are in-
cluded because of their hypothesized relationships to health be-
haviors and stress, the two primary mechanisms through which
epidemiologists have proposed that low income can adversely
impact cardiovascular health, mental health, and the risk of au-
toimmune disease (Williams 1990; Brunner 1997; Adler and
Newman 2002; Stansfeld et al. 2002; Marmot and Wilkinson
2006). In our intergenerational analyses, we study how wealth
affects a number of infant and child health characteristics studied
in earlier work (Currie 2009; Baker and Stabile 2012). Given the
known associations between early health and subsequent psycho-
logical
development,
we
also
examine
children’s
scholastic
achievement and cognitive and noncognitive skills. Throughout,
we try to facilitate the interpretation of our findings by reporting
the causal estimates from the adult sample alongside cross-sec-
tional wealth gradients and the causal estimates from the inter-
generational sample alongside the estimated gradient with
respect to a 10-year total of household disposable income.

 In our adult analyses, we find that the effect of wealth on
mortality and health care utilization can be bounded to a tight
interval around zero. For example, our estimates allow us to rule
out a causal effect of wealth on 10-year adult mortality one sixth
as large as the cross-sectional gradient between mortality and
wealth. We continue to find effects that can be bounded away
from the gradient when we stratify the sample by age, income,
sex, health, and education. In our intergenerational analyses, the
estimated effect of wealth on scholastic achievement and cogni-
tive and noncognitive skills is always precise enough to bound the
parameter to a tight interval around zero, and we can reject effect
sizes much smaller than the household-income gradient. The
estimated effects on the child health outcomes—with all-cause
hospitalizations as the exception—are not statistically distin-
guishable from the household-income gradients but often esti-
mated with enough precision to allow us to reject effects of the
magnitude reported in most previous research finding positive
effects (Duncan, Morris, and Rodrigues 2011; Cooper and
Stewart 2013).
There are some exceptions to the overall pattern of null re-
sults. In the adult analyses, we find suggestive evidence that
wealth causes a small reduction in the consumption of anxiolytics
(‘‘anti-anxiety’’ medication) and hypnotics and sedatives (‘‘sleep-
ing pills’’). In the intergenerational analyses, we find that lottery
wealth increases children’s hospitalization risk in the years fol-
lowing the lottery and reduces obesity risk around the age of 18.
Yet taken in their entirety, the findings of this article provide
little reason to interpret the wealth-health gradients and
wealth-child development gradients in our Swedish sample as
primarily arising due to causal effects of wealth. Rather, our find-
ings suggest that, as many authors have cautioned (Mayer 1998;
Smith 1999; Deaton 2002; Chandra and Vogl 2010; Cutler,
Lleras-Muney, and Vogl 2012), causal interpretations of the gra-
dients
observed
in
developed
countries
should
be
viewed
skeptically.1

 The article is structured as follows. Section II briefly reviews
the register data and describes the pooled lottery data. Section III
describes our identification strategy, provides evidence of the
(conditional) random assignment of wealth and discusses the ap-
propriateness of generalizing from the Swedish sample of lottery
players to the Swedish population. In Sections IV and V, we
report the results from the adult and intergenerational analyses.
Section VI concludes with a discussion that places our findings in
the context of the wider literature. Throughout the manuscript,
appendix tables and figures are available in the Online Appendix.
II. Data
To set the stage, Table I gives a summary overview of the
registers from which we derive our main outcome variables
(Panel A) and the wealth and household-income variables we
use to estimate cross-sectional gradients used to benchmark the
lottery-based estimates (Panel B). Panel C defines three sets of
characteristics—birth demographics, other demographics, and
health characteristics—that play a key role in many of our anal-
yses. The birth demographics are a third-order age polynomial,
an indicator for female, and an indicator for being born in a
Nordic country. The other demographics are income and indica-
tor variables for college completion, marital status, and retire-
ment status. Finally, the health characteristics are (a proxy for)
the Charlson co-morbidity index2 (Charlson et al. 1987) and indi-
cator variables for having been hospitalized in the past five years
(i) at all, (ii) for more than one week, (iii) for circulatory disease,
(iv) for respiratory disease, or (v) for cancer. Throughout the ar-
ticle, we refer to all these characteristics collectively as our set of
baseline controls. All variables measured in monetary units (e.g.,
lottery prizes, wealth or household income) are measued in year
2010 prices.
Our analyses are based on a pooled sample of lottery players
who, along with their children, were merged to administrative
records, using information about player personal identification
numbers (PINs). Our basic identification strategy is to use the
data and knowledge about the institutional details of each of

Notes. Panel A provides background information about the registers from which several of our key variables are derived. Panel B defines the wealth and income variables we
use to estimate gradients against which we sometimes benchmark our causal estimates. Panel C defines a set of variables that will be used throughout the article. We refer to the
union of birth and other demographics as ‘‘demographic characteristics’’ and to the union of demographic and health characteristics as the ‘‘baseline characteristics’’ or ‘‘baseline
controls.’’ Annual labor income is measured in SEK. All hospitalization variables are binary and defined over the preceding five years. For additional details on the variables, see

 the three lotteries that make up the pooled sample to define cells
within which lottery prizes are randomly assigned. In our analy-
ses, we then control for the cell fixed effects in regressions of
health and child outcomes on the size of the lottery prize won.
Because the construction of the cells varies by lottery, we discuss
each separately. For expositional clarity, we begin by describing
the construction of the cells used in the adult analyses; the con-
struction of the intergenerational cells is a straightforward ex-
tension described in Section III.3
II.A.
Prize-Linked Savings Accounts
Prize-linked savings (PLS) accounts incorporate a lottery el-
ement instead of paying interest (Kearney et al. 2011). PLS ac-
counts have existed in Sweden since 1949 and were originally
subsidized by the government. The subsidies ceased in 1985, at
which point the government authorized banks to offer PLS prod-
ucts under new names. Two systems were put into place. The
savings banks (Sparbankerna) started offering their clients a
PLS product known as the Million Account (Miljonkontot),
whereas the remaining banks joined forces and offered a PLS
product known as the Winner Account (Vinnarkontot). Each
system had over 2 million accounts, implying that one in two
Swedes held a PLS account.
Our analyses are based on two sources of information about
the Winner Account system that were retrieved from the
National Archives: a set of microfiche images with account data
and prize lists printed on paper (see PLS Figures II–IV in the
Online Appendix). One separate microfiche volume exists for
each monthly PLS draw that took place between December
1986 and December 1994 (the ‘‘fiche period’’). Each volume con-
tains one row of data for each account in existence at the time,
with information about the account number, the account owner’s
PIN, and the account balance. The prize lists, which are available
for each draw until 2003, contain information about the account
numbers of winning accounts and the prizes won (type of prize
and prize amount). The prize lists do not contain the account
owner’s PIN, so the fiches are needed to identify the unique map-
ping from account number to PIN. After the fiche period, we can
3. See Online Appendix III (PLS), IV (Triss), and V (Kombi) for a detailed
description ofhowthe data from the lotterieswere processedand quality controlled.

 identify the PIN of winners as long as the winning account was
active during the fiche period.
Two research assistants working independently manually
entered each prize list. We relied on optical character recognition
(OCR) technology to digitize the microfiche cards, which contain
almost 200 million rows of data. We also supplemented the OCR-
digitized data with manually gathered data for all accounts that
won 100,000 SEK or more during the fiche period. In the Online
Appendix, we provide a detailed account of how we processed the
digitized data to construct a monthly panel for the years 1986
to 1994 with information about accounts, their balance, and the
PIN of the account holder. Our quality checks, which rely in part
on the manually collected data, showed that our algorithm
was very effective at correctly mapping prize-winning accounts
to a PIN and determining their account balances (Online
Appendix III.C–III.E).
PLS players could win two types of prizes: fixed prizes and
odds prizes. To select the winners, each account was first as-
signed one unique integer-valued lottery ticket per 100 SEK in
balance. Each prize was then awarded by randomly drawing a
winning ticket. Fixed prizes varied between 1,000 and 2 million
SEK net of taxes and (conditional on winning) did not depend on
the account balance. The odds prizes instead paid a multiple of 1,
10, or 100 of the account balance to the winner, with the prize
amount capped at 1 million SEK. Conditional on winning an odds
prize, an account with a larger balance thus won a larger prize
(except when the cap was binding).
To construct the cells used in our adult analyses, we use dif-
ferent approaches depending on the type of prize won. For fixed-
prize winners, our identification strategy exploits the fact that in
the population of players who won exactly n fixed prizes in a
particular draw, the total sum of fixed prizes won is independent
of the account balance (see Online Appendix III.I for a formal
treatment). For each draw, we therefore assign winners to the
same cell if they won an identical number of fixed prizes in that
draw and define the treatment variable as the sum of fixed prizes
won. Several previous papers have used this identification strat-
egy (Imbens, Rubin, and Sacerdote 2001; Hankins and Hoekstra
2011; Hankins, Hoekstra, and Skiba 2011). Because it does not
require information about the number of tickets owned, we can
use it for fixed prizes won during and after the fiche period.
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

 For odds-prize winners, matching on number of prizes won
and draw is insufficient because winners of larger odds prizes, on
average, have larger account balances (which may be correlated
with unobservable determinants of health). We therefore match
individuals who won exactly one odds prize to controls who won
exactly one prize (odds or fixed) in the same draw and whose
account had a near-identical balance to that of the winning ac-
count.4 A fixed-prize winner who is successfully matched to an
odds-prize winner is moved from the original fixed-prize cell to
the cell of the odds-prize winner. After the fiche period, we do not
observe account balances; therefore we restrict attention to odds
prizes won during the fiche period (1986–1994).
The final sample is restricted to prize-winning accounts only
because we find some indications that in the full panel, nonwin-
ning accounts in a given draw are not missing at random.5 For the
prize-winning accounts, we were able to reliably match 98.7% of
the winning accounts from the fiche period to a PIN, implying a
negligibly small rate of attrition. In practice, little variation in
lottery prizes is lost by comparing winners of large prizes to win-
ners of small prizes (typically 1,000 SEK in the PLS data) instead
of comparing winners of large prizes to nonwinners. Because the
majority of PLS prizes are small, the small prize winners can still
be used to accurately estimate the counterfactual trajectories of
large winners. Online Appendix III.F contains an illustration,
based on hypothetical data, of the procedure used to generate
the PLS cells.
II.B.
The Kombi Lottery
Kombi is a monthly subscription ticket lottery whose pro-
ceeds are given to the Swedish Social Democratic Party and its
youth movement. Participants are therefore unrepresentative of
the Swedish population in terms of political ideology. Subscribers
are billed monthly for their tickets. Ticket owners automatically
participate in regular prize draws in which they can win cash
prizes or merchandise.
Kombi provided us with an electronic data set with informa-
tion about the monthly ticket balance of all Kombi participants

III.F.

 since January 1998.6 They also provided a list of all individuals
who won 1 million SEK (net of taxes) or more, along with infor-
mation about the month and year of the win. Our empirical strat-
egy is to compare each winner of a large prize with ‘‘matched
controls’’ who did not win a large prize but owned an identical
number of tickets at the time of the draw. We matched each
winner of a large prize to (up to) 100 controls. To improve the
precision of our estimates, we choose controls similar in age and
sex whenever possible. In those cases in which we had fewer than
100 controls, we included all of them. Our final estimation sample
includes the winners of 462 large prizes matched to 46,024 con-
trols (comprising 40,366 unique individuals).
II.C.
The Triss Lottery
Triss is a scratch-ticket lottery run since 1986 by Svenska
Spel, the Swedish government–owned gambling operator. Triss
tickets can be bought in virtually any Swedish store. Our sample
contains winners of two types of Triss prizes: Triss-Lumpsum and
Triss-Monthly.
Winners of the Triss-Lumpsum and Triss-Monthly prize are
eligible to participate in a morning TV show broadcast on na-
tional television (‘‘TV4 Morgon’’). At the show, Triss-Lumpsum
winners draw a prize from a stack of tickets. This stack of tickets
is determined by a prize plan that is subject to occasional revi-
sions. Triss-Lumpsum prizes vary in size from 50,000 to 5 million
SEK (net of taxes). Triss-Monthly winners participate in the
same TV show, but draw one ticket that determines the size of
a monthly installment and a second that determines its duration.
The tickets are drawn independently. The durations range
from 10 to 50 years, and the monthly installments range from
10,000 to 50,000 SEK. To make the monthly installments in
Triss-Monthly comparable to the lump-sum prizes in the other
lotteries, we convert them to present value using a 2% annual
discount rate.
Svenska Spel supplied us with a spreadsheet with informa-
tion on all participants in Triss-Lumpsum and Triss-Monthly
prize draws in the period between 1994 and 2010. The Triss-
Monthly prize was not introduced until 1997. Around 25 Triss-

they did not provide a valid PIN on enrollment. This missingness is not endogenous
to the lottery and hence not a source of bias.

 Lumpsum prizes and five Triss-Monthly prizes are awarded each
month. With the help of Statistics Sweden, we were able to use
the information in the spreadsheet (name, age, region of resi-
dence, and often also the names of close relatives), to reliably
identify the PINs of 98.7% of the winners of Triss prizes. The
spreadsheet also notes instances in which the participant
shared ownership of the ticket. Our main analyses are based ex-
clusively on the 90% of winners who did not indicate prior to the
TV show that they shared ownership of the lottery tickets.
However, all of our main results are substantively identical
with shared prizes included (see Online Appendix IV.D).
Our empirical strategy makes use of the fact that conditional
on making it to the show, prizes are drawn randomly conditional
on the prize plan. We assign players to the same cell if they won
the same type of lottery prize (Triss-Lumpsum or Triss-Monthly)
under the same prize plan and in the same year.
III. Identification Strategy
In our adult analyses, each observation corresponds to a
prize won by a player aged 18 or above at the time of the lottery.
Normalizing the year of the lottery to t = 0, our main estimating
equation is given by
Yi;t ¼ �tPi;0 þ Xi;0bt þ Zi;�1ct þ ei;t;
ð1Þ
where Yi,t is the (possibly time-varying) postlottery outcome of
interest, Pi,0 is the prize amount won in million SEK, and Xi,0 is
a vector of cell fixed effects. The key identifying assumption is
that Pi,0 is independent of potential outcomes conditional on
Xi,0. We include the vector of baseline controls measured at
year end in t = –1, Zi,–1, to improve the precision of our esti-
mates.
Unless
otherwise
noted,
we
estimate
equation
(1)
using ordinary least squares (OLS).
Our intergenerational analyses are based on a version of equa-
tion (1) in which the unit of analysis is the child of a player. In
these analyses, we distinguish between pre- and postlottery chil-
dren. Players’ children who were conceived but not yet aged 18 at
the time of the lottery are defined as prelottery children. We refer
to children conceived after the lottery as postlottery children. If the
impact of wealth on fertility is heterogeneous, it could invalidate
any experimental comparisons of the postlottery children of

 winners who won small prizes to postlottery of winners who won
large prizes. Though wealth effects on the composition of births are
interesting, we restrict the estimation sample to prelottery chil-
dren except when studying infant health outcomes (which by def-
inition are realized before the lottery in virtually all prelottery
children). We discuss and evaluate possible selection effects in
the infant health analyses in Section III.B.
The cells used in all of our intergenerational analyses are
generated following a procedure analogous to that used for the
adult sample, with two exceptions. First, when generating the
cells, we condition on the lottery-playing parent’s number of
prelottery children, thus ensuring the amount won per child is
the same within a cell regardless of whether Pi,0 is defined as the
prize won by the winning parent or the prize won per prelottery
child. In our primary specification, Pi,0 is defined as in the adult
analyses, but we also report a robustness check where the treat-
ment variable is defined as the lottery prize per child. The second
difference is that we drop all odds-prize cells in the intergenera-
tional analyses.7 In the intergenerational analyses, we control for
the child’s parent’s baseline characteristics (except retirement
status, due to the low fraction of parents who are retired) and
for the child’s birth demographics. Table II summarizes our iden-
tification strategy in the adult and intergenerational analyses.
III.A.
Inference
We took a number of steps to ensure the standard errors we
report convey the precision of our estimates as accurately as pos-
sible. Throughout the article, we adjust the analytical standard
errors for two sources of nonindependence. First, players who win
more than one prize will typically appear more than once in the
sample (as will the children of such players). Second, in the inter-
generational analyses, siblings’ outcomes are clearly not indepen-
dent. We therefore reported clustered standard errors (Liang and
Zeger 1986) throughout the manuscript. We cluster at the level of
the player in the adult analyses and at the household level in the
intergenerational analyses (using an iterative process that
always assigns half-siblings to the same cluster).
7. Because the odds prizes are only randomly assigned conditional on account
balances, there are fewer observations per cell, so further partitioning the odds-
prize cells by the number of prelottery children would leave little useful identifying
variation.

Notes. This table provides a summary overview of the identification strategies used in the adult and intergenerational analyses. Our identification strategy uses the available
data and detailed knowledge about the lotteries to define subsamples/cells within which wealth is randomly assigned. ‘‘Cell construction’’ describes the characteristics two players
must share to be assigned to the same cell. Prelottery children are children conceived before the lottery and postlottery children are children conceived after the lottery. Postlottery
children are only included in our analyses of infant health outcomes, whereas prelottery children are included in all other intergenerational analyses.

 The analytical standard errors rely on an asymptotic approx-
imation that may introduce substantial biases in finite samples.
Though our sample size is large, some of the variables are heavily
skewed, so standard rules of thumb about the appropriate sample
sizes may not apply. To quantify the amount of finite-sample bias,
we conducted Monte Carlo simulations in our adult and interge-
nerational estimation samples (see Online Appendix VII.A for
details). In the simulations, we exploit the fact that the prizes
are randomly assigned within cells to obtain the approximate
finite-sample distribution of our test statistics under the null hy-
pothesis that the effect of wealth is zero. Procedurally, we gener-
ated 1,000 data sets in which the prizes won by the players (and
hence also their children) were permuted within each cell. For
each outcome and each permuted sample, we then estimated
equation (1).
In the simulated data, prize amount is (conditionally) inde-
pendent of the outcome by construction, so if the p-values obtained
from analytical standard errors follow a uniform distribution, we
interpret this finding as evidence that they are reliable. By this
criterion, the analytical standard errors we report in our main
analyses are generally reliable. In all our major analyses, we nev-
ertheless supplement analytical standard errors with resampling-
based p-values (constructed from the resampling distribution gen-
erated in the Monte Carlo simulations). In some analyses of either
skewed variables (e.g., prescription drug consumption) or rare
binary variables (e.g., short-run cause-specific hospitalizations),
we occasionally observe nontrivial differences between the analyt-
ical and resampling-based p-values. In such cases, we rely on the
resampling-based p-values, which are usually more conservative.
III.B.
Random Assignment
If the identifying assumptions of Table II are correct, no co-
variates determined before the lottery should have predictive
power for the lottery outcome once we condition on the cell
fixed effects. Normalizing the time of the lottery to 0, we test
for (conditional) random assignment by running regressions of
the following form:
Pi;0 ¼ Xi;0b þ Z�1c þ ei;0;
ð2Þ
where Pi,0 is prize money at the time of the event, Xi,0 is the
matrix of cell fixed effects, and Z–1 is the full set of baseline
controls (see Table I) measured at t = –1. To test for random

 assignment, in Table III we report omnibus p-values for joint

characteristics
defined
in
Table I, the health characteristics, and their union. We run
these randomization tests in the pooled adult sample, in the
four lottery samples, and for parents of prelottery children or
postlottery children. In the pooled sample, we also estimate
equation (2) without cell fixed effects. Overall, the results in
Table III are consistent with our null hypothesis that wealth
is randomly assigned if and only if we condition on the cell fixed
effects.8
Because the hypothesis of conditional random assignment of
wealth is the least credible in the potentially selected sample of
postlottery children, we also tested whether wealth shocks have
an impact on fertility (a fundamental question in its own right—
see Becker and Tomes 1976). As is common in studies of infant
health, we restricted our analyses to postlottery children of
female players. As shown in Online Appendix Table AIII, we
find no evidence that lottery wealth affects fertility of women
below the age of 50.
III.C.
External Validity
In this section, we address a number of questions about the
appropriateness of generalizing from our Swedish sample of lot-
tery players to the Swedish population.
1. How Representative Are Players? Table IV compares our
pooled adult sample to representative samples of Swedes.
Column (1) reports unweighted summary statistics for the
pooled lottery sample; column (2) reports summary statistics
with observations weighted by prize won. All characteristics are
measured the year before the lottery. The average difference be-
tween players’ age in the year of a win and that of a randomly
drawn Swedish adult is approximately 10 years. In columns (3)
and (4), we report descriptive statistics for representative sam-
ples of Swedes reweighted to match the age and sex distributions
in columns (1) and (2). We find that after adjusting for age
8. As an alternative randomization check, Online Appendix Table AI shows
that within cells, prelottery baseline characteristics are balanced across individ-
uals who won above- and below-median prizes. Table AII reports estimates of how
wealth impacts the likelihood of being missing from several of the key registers
listed in Table I. We find no evidence of such effects.

Notes. This table reports results from our randomization tests. Each column corresponds to a regression where the dependent variable is lottery prize and we control for
baseline characteristics measured the year before the lottery event in all specifications. Under the null hypothesis of conditional random assignment, variables determined before
the lottery should not have any predictive power conditional on the cell fixed effects. Column (1) shows the specification without cell fixed effects and column (2) the specification
that controls for cell fixed effects. Columns (3)-(6) report the results separately by lottery and columns (7) and (8) display the results when we restrict the sample to players with
pre- or postlottery children, respectively. The reported p-values are from tests of the joint significance of the demographic characteristics, the health characteristics, and the
baseline characteristics. The nonparametric p-values are obtained from the resampling distribution of the F-statistic in 1,000 Monte Carlo simulation draws in which prizes are
randomly permuted within each cell.

 number of prizes awarded in five mutually exclusive prize range
categories. For the adult sample, we also report the average prize
in each category. Although 91% of the winners in the adult
sample are small-prize winners from PLS, these small prizes
only account for 7% of the total value of the prizes disbursed to
winners. Dropping these prizes altogether reduces the amount of
identifying variation by 10%.9 The estimates we report therefore
assign relatively little weight to the marginal effects of small lot-
tery prizes, even though small prizes account for a large fraction
of the total number of prizes won. By contrast, prizes greater than
500,000 SEK account for over 70% of the total prize pool. To
convey a sense of the magnitudes of the large prizes that ac-
count for most of our identifying variation, the 10th, 50th
(median), and 90th percentiles of the distribution of adult
Swedes’ annual disposable income in 1999 were 65,000 ($9,100),
144,000 ($20,100) and 247,000 SEK ($34,500).10 Thus, a prize of
1M SEK, the typical prize won by large-prize winners in both PLS
and Kombi, is approximately equal to 7 median annual disposable
incomes.

Notes. This table shows the number of prizes assigned to individuals in our final estimation sample.
Matched controls from the Kombi sample are included in the category <10K. For Triss-monthly, we define
the prize size as the net present value of the monthly installments assuming an annual discount rate of
2%. Mean prize is the average value of prizes in the category in the adult sample.
9. Because all analyses include cell fixed effects, none of our identifying vari-
ation comes from between-cell comparisons. The total amount of variation is there-
fore appropriately defined as the total sum of squares of the cell-demeaned prizes.
10. For net wealth, the analogous figures are �121,000 (�$16,900), 98,000
($13,700) and 1,264,000 SEK ($176,700).

 3. Is Lottery Wealth Different? A general concern often voiced
about studies of lottery winners is that people may react differ-
ently to lottery wealth than to other types of wealth shocks (e.g.,
changes in taxes, welfare systems, or asset-price fluctuations).
This argument can take many specific forms, one of them being
that lottery prizes are usually paid in lump sums, whereas many
policy changes involve changes to income flows. Throughout the
article, we test for heterogeneity by lottery and by type of prize
(monthly installments versus lump sum). In interpreting these
estimates, recall that the Triss-Monthly prizes supplement
monthly incomes by 10,000 to 50,000 SEK ($1,400–7,000). Such
figures are far too large to realistically replicate the features of
most income support programs. Instead, they allow us to evaluate
whether our conclusions about the effects of substantial shocks to
permanent income are robust to the mode of payment. The infor-
mativeness of the estimates from the Triss-Monthly sample also
varies across outcomes depending on the effective sample size.
According to a folk wisdom, lottery winners spend lottery
wealth more frivolously than other types of wealth. In a compan-
ion paper on labor supply (Cesarini et al. 2015), we show that the
earnings response to the lottery wealth shock is immediate,
modest in size, seemingly permanent, and similar across lotter-
ies. Figure I shows the trajectory of net wealth in the years
following the lottery win. Plotted are coefficient estimates for
t = –1, . . . ,10 obtained from our main estimating equation with
the outcome variable defined as (household-level) year-end net
wealth. In the year of the lottery, measured net wealth increases
by over 60% of the prize amount won. The net wealth trajectories
are similar across lotteries and suggest winners spread out the
consumption of lottery wealth fairly evenly over time. The indi-
cations are thus that winners of large prizes in all lotteries enjoy a
modest but sustained increase in consumption and leisure for an
extended period of time.
IV. Adult Health
We use information from the Cause of Death Register to
study overall mortality and cause-specific mortalities and infor-
mation from additional registers to study in-patient hospitaliza-
tions and consumption of prescription drugs. We examine deaths
and health care utilization events classified into two cause

 categories: common causes and hypotheses-based causes. The
common causes are cancer, respiratory disease, cardiovascular
disease, and other. The hypotheses-based causes, which we
sought to harmonize across registers, include diabetes, ischemic
heart disease, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, alcohol con-
sumption, injury, and smoking.11
We chose these categories to test some of the hypotheses
about the causal pathways from income to health that have
been proposed in economics and epidemiology. Epidemiologists
argue that the stress induced by low income has deleterious
health effects, either through relatively proximal biological

The Effect of Lottery Wealth on Net Wealth According to Administrative

See Online Appendix VI.D for details on the net wealth variable. Plotted in
the figure are regression coefficients from equation (1) with the dependent var-
iable defined as household net wealth at t = �1, . . ., 10. Standard errors are
clustered by individual, and the error bars give 95% confidence intervals. The
seemingly anomalous lottery-specific estimates (e.g., PLS at t = 0 and Kombi at
t = 9) are all imprecisely estimated. For example, the t = 9 Kombi estimate is
based on draws from a single year of data; the Kombi panel begins in 1998 and
our last year with wealth data is 2007. Household wealth is defined as the
wealth of the winner plus, if applicable, the wealth of the spouse or cohabitat-
ing partner. Coefficients can be interpreted as the effect of a 1 SEK increase in

Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnoses codes to the cause-specific death and
hospitalization events.

 mechanisms that divert resources away from the maintenance of
long-term health (the ‘‘fight or flight’’ response) or through behav-
ioral responses such as smoking, excessive drinking, or unhealthy
dieting (Williams 1990; Adler and Newman 2002). These biologi-
cal mechanisms, in turn, increase the risk of bad health in the
categories covered by our hypotheses-based classification. In the
framework that economists use to study the wealth-health rela-
tionship (Grossman 1972), health is a stock whose malleability
may vary over the life cycle (Cutler, Lleras-Muney, and Vogl
2012). Plausible channels through which wealth could affect
health include changes to lifestyle factors, such as consumption
of cigarettes, alcohol, or an unhealthy diet, and health invest-
ments with a substantial time cost, such as exercise or access to
medical services that require multiple time-consuming interac-
tions with the health care system before being offered.
IV.A.
Total and Cause-Specific Mortality
We begin with mortality because it is the most objective
health measure available in our data. In our main analyses of
mortality, the dependent variable is an indicator variable that
takes the value 1 if the individual was deceased t = 1, . . . , 10
years after the lottery. For each of these 10 survival horizons,
we estimate a separate linear probability model. In all lottery
regressions, we control for the full set of baseline characteristics
measured at t = –1 and scale the treatment variable so that a co-
efficient of 1.00 means 1M SEK decreases the survival probability
over the relevant time horizon by 1 percentage point.
Given that wealth-mortality gradients are sometimes given
causal interpretations, we compare the lottery-based estimates to
the cross-sectional gradients estimated from nonexperimental
variation in a Swedish representative sample drawn in 2000
and a U.S. sample. The U.S. analyses are based on all adult mem-
bers of the Health and Retirement Study’s AHEAD cohort who
were alive in 1993. To maximize comparability to the lottery esti-
mates, we reweight both cross-sectional samples to match the age
and sex distributions of the pooled lottery sample. We estimate
Swedish cross-sectional gradients from regressions of the form
Yi;t ¼ �tWi;1999 þ Zi;1999ct þ ei;
ð3Þ
where Yi,t is an indicator variable equal to 1 if individual i is
deceased in year t, Wi,1999 is net wealth by December 31, 1999,
WEALTH, HEALTH, AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT
707
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/131/2/687/2606947 by guest on 01 June 2019
 and Zi,1999 is a set of controls. We estimate a separate regres-
sion for t = 2001, . . . , 2010. The U.S. gradients are estimated
using an analogous specification, except that covariates are
measured in 1992, and mortality observed for t = 1994, . . . ,
2003. We winsorize net wealth in both samples at the 1st
and 99th percentiles and convert the winsorized variable to
year 2010 SEK.
Figure II graphically illustrates the estimated coefficients in
(i) our pooled lottery sample, (ii) the weighted Swedish represen-
tative sample controlling for just the birth demographics, (iii) the
weighted Swedish sample controlling for the baseline character-
istics, and (iv) the weighted U.S. sample with controls for birth
demographics. The estimates for t = 2, 5, and 10 are reported in
Online Appendix Table AVIII, which also shows the fraction of
individuals deceased at t = 2, 5, and 10 in the lottery sample and
the two representative samples.
The wealth-mortality gradients in Sweden and the United
States are of similar magnitude and exhibit similar trajectories
over time.12 In Sweden, an additional 1M is associated with ap-
proximately a 2.8 percentage point decrease in 10-year mortality
risk, and the point estimate only falls to 2.1 if we control for the
full set of baseline characteristics (Online Appendix Table AVIII).
In sharp contrast to the cross-sectional gradients, the lottery-
based estimates are close to zero and never statistically distin-
guishable from zero in the pooled sample. For all survival hori-
zons greater than two years, the lottery-based estimates are
statistically distinguishable from the gradients. For 10-year mor-
tality, the 95% confidence interval allows us to rule out causal
effects one sixth of the gradient. We find no evidence of a positive
gradual accumulation of effects. If anything, the temporal pat-
tern appears to be the opposite: positive effects fade to zero and
may even be negative over longer horizons. The estimates and
their standard errors are substantively identical if we use the
probit estimator (Online Appendix Table AVIII), and our conclu-
sions are robust to restricting the sample to lottery players who
can be followed for at least 10 years after the lottery (thus holding
the composition of the lottery sample fixed; see Online Appendix
Figure AII).

and the United States, see Semyonov, Lewin-Epstein, and Maskileyson (2013).

 We repeated the above analyses for all the common and hy-
potheses-based cause-specific mortalities at t = 5 and 10 (Online
Appendix Figures AIII–AIV and Table AIX).13 We find no evi-
dence that lottery wealth affects the probability of death due to
any of these causes. Compared with the respective gradients, the
lottery-based estimates almost always imply a smaller protective
effect (or even a harmful effect) of wealth. Our lottery-based es-
timates are statistically distinguishable at the 5% level from sev-

Wealth and Mortality
This figure contrasts our lottery-based estimates of the effect of wealth on
mortality to gradients estimated in Swedish and U.S. population samples. The
population samples have been reweighted to match the sex and age distribution
of our sample of lottery winners. Gradients are separately estimated with con-
trols for birth demographics for Sweden and the United States, as well as with
the full set of baseline controls for Sweden. Standard errors are clustered by
individual, and the error bars give 95% confidence intervals of the coefficient.
13. We abstain from reporting results for t = 2 because the fraction of individ-
uals deceased from several of our specific causes is too low over this time horizon to
generate informative estimates.

 number of subpopulations. Health is a stock whose correlation
with income varies over the life cycle, and so may the mix of
causal forces that give rise to the correlation at different ages
(Smith 2007; Cutler, Lleras-Muney, and Vogl 2012). We therefore
reran our main analyses of overall mortality at t = 2, 5, and 10 in
three subsamples defined by age at the time of the lottery: early
(ages 18–44), middle (45–69), and late adulthood (70 +). We also
test for heterogeneity by sex, health status (hospitalized or not
during the past five years), college completion, and income (indi-
vidual disposable income above versus below the median in the
individual’s age category). In each heterogeneity analysis, we es-
timated an extended version of equation (1) in which all coeffi-
cients are allowed to vary flexibly by subsample. We then conduct
a conventional F-test of the null hypothesis that the effect of
wealth is the same across all subgroups.
As shown in Online Appendix Figure AV and Online
Appendix Tables AX–AXI, we find no strong evidence of hetero-
geneous effects, but we observe nominally significant effects of
wealth on mortality in some of the subsamples; for example, we
find signs that wealth increases 10-year mortality in players
above 70 years of age, in female players, and in players with
below-median income, and suggestive evidence that wealth is
protective in individuals with college degrees. Given the large
number of hypotheses tested, we interpret these results cau-
tiously. The most important conclusion from our heterogeneity
analysis is that in each of the 11 subsamples, some of which in-
clude fewer than 15% of the members of the pooled sample, the
estimated effect of wealth on 10-year mortality is precise enough
to rule out even the more conservatively estimated Swedish gra-
dient of �2.1. In fact, we can reject causal effects one third as
large as this gradient in 7 of our 11 subsamples, including in
several populations (e.g., low-income households) sometimes
identified as vulnerable in the literature.
We also investigated whether the effect of wealth on overall
mortality varied by lottery (Online Appendix Table AXII). Because
most players whom we can follow for 10 years are from the PLS
lottery, the 10-year mortality estimates in remaining lotteries are
too imprecise to convey any valuable information about heteroge-
neity. For two- and five-year mortality, the estimated effects are
similar across the lotteries and estimated with reasonable preci-
sion. The cross-sectional gradient for five-year mortality is �1.57

 controlling for birth demographics, a magnitude we can reject at
the 5% level in all lotteries except Kombi (95% CI �1.85 to 2.50).
To better understand what sort of nonlinear effects are con-
sistent with our results, we reestimated our main mortality re-
gressions, dropping small (<10K), large (>2M), or very large
(>4M) prizes altogether. These sample restrictions appear to
have little systematic impact on our estimates, suggesting that
none of our results are driven by extreme prizes (Online Appendix
Table AXIII). We also estimated two piecewise linear models, the
first with a single knot at 1M and the second with knots at 100K
and 1M. If lottery wealth has positive and diminishing marginal
health benefits (Adler and Newman 2002), we expect negative
coefficients that are further away from zero at lower prizes. Our
point estimates suggest the opposite pattern—increases in mor-
tality risk that are greatest at lower levels of wealth. Online
Appendix Figure AVI illustrates the spline estimates. Though
we can never statistically reject constant marginal effects, the
upper panel of the figure shows our 95% confidence intervals
allow us to rule out even modest positive diminishing marginal
effects of wealth. For example, according to the first model, the
effect of a 1M wealth shock on 10-year survival probability is at
most 0.2 percentage point. The lower panel shows the marginal
effect of wealth below 100K is estimated with too little precision
to convey useful information.
We supplement our main results with estimates from dura-
tion models, which make stronger parametric assumptions about
the relationship between wealth and mortality but also accommo-
date the right-censoring of the data and thus make more efficient
use of the full data set (which includes some players observed up
to 24 years after the lottery event). We estimate an exponential
proportional hazard model in which, again normalizing the time
of the lottery to t = 0, the hazard of death individual i faces at t is
assumed to be given by

where Pi,0 is the lottery prize won at event time t=0, Ait is the
age (in years) of individual i at time t, Xi,0 is the vector of cell
fixed effects, Zi,–1 is the vector of predetermined covariates
except for age, and l0 is the baseline hazard. Because we do
not wish to impose the implausible restriction that individuals

 face a constant hazard of death over the life cycle, we allow the
hazard to vary with a third-order polynomial in age. The key
assumption in equation (4) is that all of the exponentiated co-
variates proportionally affect this age-varying baseline hazard.
In Table VI, we report estimates of equation (4) obtained from
the full adult sample and the subsamples used in the heteroge-
neity analyses above. The first column shows the estimated
effect of wealth in the full sample. The estimates are all
shown as hazard ratios, so the estimate in column (1) of
1.015 (95% CI 0.964–1.066) means the mortality risk increases
by 1.5% for each million SEK won. The next two columns con-
tains estimates from the reweighted Swedish 2000 representa-
tive sample. The hazard ratio is 0.874 with the baseline set of
covariates and 0.828 with the narrower set of controls. In the
cross section, 1M SEK of net wealth is thus associated with a
17.2% or 12.6% lower mortality risk. The results from the

Notes. This table shows the estimated hazard ratios from survival models with right censoring. All
regressions except (3) includes the full set of baseline controls. ‘‘Hospitalized’’ refers to whether the winner
was hospitalized during the five years preceding the lottery event. Coefficients are expressed as hazard
ratios, so an estimate of 1.1 would imply that 1M SEK increases the hazard by 10%. Standard errors are
clustered by individual. Heterogeneity p refers to the p-value from test of null hypothesis that the hazard
ratio is equal to the hazard ratio in column (2).

 heterogeneity analyses are qualitatively similar to the OLS
findings. Hazard ratios hover around 1.00 and are estimated
with enough precision to reject the gradient in all subsamples
except college-educated winners and winners aged 18–44.
As an alternative benchmark for these estimates, an extra
year of schooling is believed to reduce mortality rates by about 8%
across the entire life cycle (Deaton 2002, p. 21). Our estimates
allow us to reject that 100,000 SEK—roughly the annual U.S. per
pupil spending in high school—reduces the mortality rate by
more than 0.4%. We also sought to evaluate whether the effects
are small or large from a welfare perspective, by calculating the
cost per life year saved at the bounds of our confidence intervals.
Even if we take the lower bound of our 95% CI for the hazard, the
estimated hazard translates into an average prolonged life of four
months per 1M SEK in our sample. Our estimates therefore allow
us to reject costs smaller than 3M SEK per year of life saved,
approximately three times larger than a recent Swedish estimate
of the value of a quality-adjusted life year of 1.2M SEK
(Hultkrantz and Svensson 2012, p. 309).
IV.B.
Health Care Utilization
We examine two types of health care utilization: hospitaliza-
tions requiring inpatient care and consumption of prescription
drugs. The hospitalization analyses are based on data on inpa-
tient care from the National Patient Register. From 1987 onward,
this register contains information about each patient’s arrival
and discharge dates and diagnoses codes (in ICD format). Our
analyses of drug prescriptions are based on data from the
Prescribed Drug Register, which contains information about all
over-the-counter sales of prescribed medical drugs between 2006
and 2010. During this period, we observe on which day a prescrip-
tion was purchased, the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical
Classification System (ATC) code of the drug, and the number
of defined daily doses (DDDs) purchased. A DDD is an estimate
of the maintenance dose per day of a drug when it is used for its
main indication.
Unlike the well-studied wealth-mortality gradients, health
care utilization gradients with respect to income are on average
quite small, but vary both in their sign and their magnitude
across countries (Majo and van Soest 2012). Given Sweden’s uni-
versal coverage, extrapolations of the findings reported here to
WEALTH, HEALTH, AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT
713

 other settings are clearly fraught with numerous difficulties. To
facilitate the exposition, we seek to mimic the mortality analyses
as closely as possible but relegate most of the findings to the
Online Appendix. In our analyses of cause-specific hospitaliza-
tions, we consider the same common and hypotheses-based
causes as in the mortality analyses. In our hospitalization anal-
yses, the main outcome variables are a set of binary outcome
variables equal to 1 if in at least one of the 2, 5, and 10 years
following the lottery the individual was hospitalized for at least
one night. We construct one variable for each of the specific
causes and also an omnibus (all-cause) variable that includes
hospitalizations due to all causes except pregnancy. We also con-
struct an alternative all-cause hospitalization variable for hospi-
talizations whose duration exceeds at least one week. We also
construct a health index that aggregates the information avail-
able in the registers to predict five-year mortality risk. The index,
which ranges from 0 to 100, is defined so higher values denote
worse health (see Online Appendix VI.C for details).
In our drug prescription analyses, the nature of the data re-
quired us to make some minor changes to the categories,14 the
most important of which is that we include mental health as one
of the hypotheses-based causes.15 We estimate the impact of
wealth on the intensive- and extensive-margin drug consumption
2006–2010. Our primary outcome is the sum of DDDs prescribed
between
2006
and
2010
in
all
drug
categories
except
contraceptives.
In all health care utilization analyses, we restrict the estima-
tion sample to individuals who were alive for the entire period
over which a variable is defined. For example, the drug prescrip-
tion analyses are restricted to a sample of individuals who won
14. First, we merge ischemic heart disease and hypertension into a single cat-
egory (Heart) because many drugs are prescribed to treat both ischemic heart dis-
ease and hypertension. Second, we make no attempt to identify drugs used to treat
diseases often caused by alcohol and tobacco consumption; the structure of the drug
prescription data makes the identification of such drugs difficult. Online Appendix
Table AVII shows how we use a drug’s ATC to assign it to one of the categories.
15. We did not include mental health in the other analyses because inferring
mental health status from hospitalization records and death certificates is difficult.
Our decision to study mental health drugs was made prior to accessing the data and
was in fact one of the major motivations we gave when requesting access to the data
on drug prescription.

 before 2006 (the first year for which we have data) and were alive
in 2010 (the last year with data).
To give a broad summary of the overall pattern of results,
Table VII reports results for eight key outcomes: all-cause hospi-
talizations and the health index at t = 2, 5, 10; total drug
consumption; and intensive-margin consumption of mental
health drugs. As a benchmark, the table also reports the wealth
gradients estimated in a representative sample reweighted so its
sex and age distribution matches the lottery sample.16 The causal
estimates on the three all-cause hospitalization variables are not
statistically distinguishable from zero. The estimated marginal
effects of 1M SEK on the probability of hospitalization within 5
and 10 years are 0.39 (95% CI �0.82 to 1.60) and �0.03 percent-
age points (95% CI �1.54 to 1.48), respectively. Given baseline
probabilities of 38.3% and 51.2%, these estimates allow us to rule
out effects on relative risk that are fairly small. For t = 2 and t = 5
hospitalizations, the causal estimates are statistically distin-
guishable from the gradients at the 10% level.
The estimated effect of 1M on the health index, whose value
ranges from 0 to 100, is �0.08 (95% CI �0.36 to 0.20) at t = 2, 0.30
(95% CI �0.23 to 0.82) at t = 5, and 0.45 (95% CI �0.24 to 1.15) at
t = 10. These estimates are clearly statistically distinguishable
from the gradients.
Our estimated effects on total and mental health drug con-
sumption are also small. The 95% confidence interval for the es-
timated impact of 1M SEK on total drug consumption is �0.04 to
0.01 standard deviation units. For mental health, our estimate
suggests wealth significantly reduces intensive margin consump-
tion, but the coefficient estimate (�32.50) is small. In standard
deviation units, 32.5 DDDs corresponds to an effect of 0.03, so the
estimated effect is not an exception to the overall pattern of small
effects of wealth. Moreover, mental health was one of several
categories of prescription drugs considered, and the result does
not survive a multiple-hypotheses correction that takes into ac-
count all the drug-prescription variables analyzed (adjusted
p-value = .21).17 We therefore interpret the finding cautiously.
16. To maximize comparability, we also limit the representative sample to in-
dividuals who were alive for the entire period over which the dependent variable is
defined, and then reweight it to match the sex and age distribution in our lottery
estimation sample.
17. To implement the multiple-hypotheses correction, we simulate the lottery
10,000 times, each time randomly permuting the prize within each cell. In each

Notes. This table reports estimates of the causal impact of wealth on some key health care utilization variables. For the binary hospitalization variables, wealth is scaled so a
coefficient of 1.00 implies that 1M SEK increases the probability of hospitalization by one percentage point. For remaining outcomes, wealth is scaled in million SEK. Wealth
gradients are estimated in a representative sample of adults that has been reweighted to match the sex and age distribution of the lottery sample. All regressions include controls
for the full set of baseline characteristics. Higher values for the health index denotes worse health. Standard errors are clustered by individual. Resampling-based p-values are
obtained from 1,000 Monte Carlo simulation draws in which the prizes are permuted randomly within each cell. The heterogeneity p-value is from a two-sided t-test of the null
hypothesis that the gradient and causal parameter are equal.

 In post hoc analyses reported in Online Appendix Table AXVI, we
found that the effect, if real, is explained mostly by reductions in
the consumption of anxiolytics (used to treat anxiety) and hyp-
notics and sedatives (used to treat insomnia). The mental health
result shows up robustly if a count model is used in lieu of our
baseline OLS specification, but the estimated effect is not statis-
tically significant if we winsorize the mental health variable at
the 99th percentile (Online Appendix Table AXVII).
For four of the outcomes in Table VII—five-year hospitaliza-
tion, five-year health index, total drug consumption, and mental
health drug consumption—we also undertook a series of additional
heterogeneity and nonlinearity analyses analogous to those con-
ducted
for
overall
mortality
(Online
Appendix
Tables
AXIX-AXXII). The estimated effect on mental health is negative
in 10 out of 11 subsamples considered in the heterogeneity analy-
ses (the exception is individuals above 70) and in all four lotteries,
and appears to be driven primarily by large-prize winners.
Online Appendix Table AXVIII reports lottery-based esti-
mates and wealth gradients for the full set of cause-specific hos-
pitalization variables we considered. For all but 2 of the 26
outcomes, the gradients are negative, implying higher net
wealth is associated with lower hospitalization risk. The excep-
tions are 10-year hospitalization risk for cancer and cerebrovas-
cular disease. The causal estimates also exceed the gradients for
all but two outcomes, implying that the evidence in its entirety
suggests that the causal benefits of wealth on health are of smal-
ler magnitude than the gradient. However, the difference is only
statistically significant at the 5% level for six outcomes: all-cause
hospitalizations lasting at least a week (t = 5), alcohol (t = 5 and
t = 10), diabetes (t = 5 and t = 10), and ischemic heart disease
(t = 5). An analogous analysis of the drug prescription variables
yields similar conclusions. For example, the estimated causal ef-
fects on the eight extensive margin drug variables are always
greater than the gradients, though the difference is only signifi-
cant for cerebrovascular disease and diabetes (Online Appendix
Table AXIV).
simulated data set, we then run 17 separate outcome regressions, one for each of
outcome listed in Online Appendix Tables AXIV and AXV. In each simulated data
set, we compute the minimum of the 17 p-values from the null that the effect of
wealth is zero. The resampling-based p-value of .018 exceeds the minimum of the 17
p-values only 21% of the time.

 V. Intergenerational Analyses
To minimize concerns about undisclosed multiple-hypothesis
testing, our intergenerational analyses were prespecified in an
analysis plan posted in the public domain before running any
regressions
of
child
outcomes
on
the
treatment
variable
(Cesarini et al. 2014).18 The plan defines our set of child health
and child development outcomes and specifies all major aspects of
the analyses, including the main estimating equation, the con-
struction of the intergenerational cells, sample selection criteria,
and the heterogeneity analyses. The plan also contains some
basic descriptive analyses of how the outcomes vary by household
income.
Overall, we sought to examine outcomes resembling those
that have featured prominently in earlier research on child
health
and
development
(Brooks-Gunn
and
Duncan
1997;
Newacheck and Halfon 1998; Currie 2009). This line of research
has shown that on average, children from households with lower
incomes weigh less at birth, are more likely to suffer health in-
sults due to accidents or injury, and are at greater risk for chronic
conditions such as asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disor-
der (ADHD), and being overweight. We therefore consider several
health outcomes in these domains, for example, hospitalizations
due to respiratory disease, consumption of ADHD prescription
drugs, and obesity. Many markers of childhood health are also
predictive of subsequent cognitive and emotional development
(Currie 2009), so we also examine how wealth impacts childrens’
cognitive and noncognitive skills and their scholastic perfor-
mance. Online Appendix Table AXXIII contains detailed informa-
tion about the definition of our outcome variables and sample
selection criteria.
Throughout this section, we eschew comparisons to the cross-
sectional gradient with respect to net wealth, because net wealth
measured early in the life cycle is a poor proxy for permanent
income.19 Instead, we benchmark our estimates against the gra-
dient with respect to a 10-year sum of household income. We

19. In our representative sample drawn in 2000, the R2 from the regression of
10-year disposable income (measured 2001–2010) on net wealth measured in 1999
varies substantially by age. The R2 is 1% in individuals aged 15–24, 5% for individ-
uals aged 25–34, and rises monotonically to 25% for individuals aged 65–74.

 define household income as the sum of the disposable incomes of
the child’s two biological parents in the first 10 years of the child’s
life. We estimate these gradients in a large representative
sample, controlling for parents’ birth demographics, and impos-
ing the same cohort and age restrictions used in the lottery anal-

V.A.
Child Health
Table VIII summarizes the results for our 18 prespecified
child health outcomes. For each outcome, we report lottery-
based estimates alongside household-income gradients.
We begin with the analyses of infant health, which are based
on variables derived from the Medical Birth Register. Columns
(1)–(3) of Table VIII display the results for our three prespecified
(and commonly studied) outcomes—birth weight (in grams), pre-
term birth (gestation length < 37 weeks), and low birth weight
(birth weight < 2,500 grams). Whereas all remaining analyses
are based on prelottery children, the infant health analyses are
restricted to the smaller sample of postlottery children born to
female players, leading to less precise estimates. None of the
three causal estimates are robustly distinguishable from either
zero or the household-income gradients.
We use data from the Swedish Conscript Register to con-
struct three measures of body weight: BMI measured on a con-
tinuous scale and indicator variables for having a BMI above 25
and 30, the standard cutoffs used to define ‘‘overweight’’ and ‘‘obe-
sity.’’ Conscription was mandatory for all Swedish men until
2010, so these analyses are limited to male prelottery children
who reached conscription age (18–19) no later than 2010. The
results from these analyses are shown in columns (4)–(6). For
BMI, the point estimate is �0.11 with a 95% CI that ranges
from �0.55 to 0.33 (-0.18 to 0.10 in standard deviation units).
We estimate a statistically significant effect of wealth on obesity
risk: according to our point estimate, 1M SEK reduces the
20. Based on exploratory analyses described in the analysis plan, we decided to
restrict the estimation samples for some outcomes. For example, ADHD medication
is not prescribed to children below the age of six, so the ADHD-analyses are re-
stricted to person-year observations in which the child was at least six years old.

Notes. This table summarizes the results from our analyses of the prespecified child health outcomes. In the regressions with binary dependent variables, wealth is scaled so a
coefficient of 1.00 implies that 1M SEK increases the probability by 1 percentage point. For remaining outcomes, wealth is scaled in million SEK. Household-income gradients are
obtained by regressing each outcome on a 10-year sum of household disposable income in a representative sample selected using the same cohort and age restrictions used in the
lottery analyses (Online Appendix Table AXXIII). Except in the infant health analyses, we control for the child’s birth characteristics. In the lottery regressions, we also control for
the winning parent’s demographic characteristics. Standard errors are clustered using an iterative algorithm that assigns siblings and half-siblings to the same cluster. Resampling-
based p-values are obtained from 1,000 Monte Carlo simulation draws in which the prizes are permuted randomly within each cell. The heterogeneity p-value is from a two-sided
t-test of the null hypothesis that the gradient and causal parameter are equal. BMI: Body Mass Index. ADHD: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

 probability of being obese around age 18 by 2.1 percentage points,
roughly twice the size of the gradient. The obesity result sur-
vives an adjustment for multiple-hypothesis testing21 (adjusted
p-value = .04), but because the estimated effect is outside the
range we consider plausible and is not statistically significant
in several of our sensitivity analyses, we interpret the result
with some caution.22
We also used data from the Prescribed Drug Register to study
prescription drug consumption in four categories. The first three
categories—asthma & allergy, mental health and ADHD—have
featured prominently in the U.S. literature on child development
(Currie 2009). The fourth category—total—includes all drug con-
sumption except contraceptives and drugs included in the first
three categories. The results from the prescription-drug analyses
are shown in columns (7)–(10). We find no evidence that wealth
impacts the total number of DDDs consumed in any of the four
categories. The estimates consistently have good precision in the
sense that we can bound the effect of 1M SEK to within ± 0.03
standard deviation units of the point estimate. The estimates are
not statistically distinguishable from the household-income
gradients.
Our final set of child health outcomes are hospitalization
variables derived from the National Patient Register. We con-
sider inpatient hospitalizations due to respiratory disease, exter-
nal causes (accidents, injuries, and poisoning), and an omnibus
(‘‘all-cause’’) category covering all hospitalizations except those
due to pregnancy. For each category, we define indicator vari-
ables equal to 1 if a child was hospitalized due to that cause
within two or five years of the lottery event. For the all-cause
21. Weuseaprocedureanalogoustotheonedescribedinnote17toadjustforthe
multiple hypotheses tested in the child health analyses. The adjustment is re-
stricted to the 15 out of 18 child health outcomes studied in prelottery children.
We exclude the infant health characteristics from the multiple-hypotheses adjust-
ment for practical reasons; because of Statistics Sweden’s privacy rules, the char-
acteristics were supplied to us in another data set with the same subjects but a
different set of masking identifiers.
22. Given that 2.9% of the conscripts in our sample are obese, we consider a
point estimate of �2.1 implausibly large. Those who share this assessment may
nevertheless find our result informative. To illustrate, consider a Bayesian whose
prior about the true effect size is uniform on the interval from �1.00 to 1.00 per-
centage points. On seeing our results, the mean of her posterior is �0.66 and the
probability assigned to the event that the sign of wealth is negative should change
from 50% to 94%.

 category, we also define a second set of indicators for hospitaliza-
tions lasting at least a week. We focus on respiratory disease and
external causes because these are the most common chronic phys-
ical health conditions afflicting children in developed countries
(Currie 2009).
The results of the hospitalization analyses are reported in
columns (11)–(18) of Table VIII. According to our lottery esti-
mates, a 1M SEK positive wealth shock increases the probability
of all-cause hospitalization within two years by 2.1 percentage
points and within five years by 3.4 percentage points. These esti-
mates are statistically distinguishable both from zero and from
the gradients, which are negative. The five-year effect surives an
adjustment for multiple-hypothesis testing (following the same
procedure as for obesity; adjusted p-value = .01). Expressed as
relative risks, our estimates imply that 1M SEK increases both
two- and five-year hospitalization risk by 19%. For hospitaliza-
tions due to both respiratory disease and external causes, the
effects of wealth are of similar magnitude but less precisely
estimated.
V.B.
Child Development
Table IX reports results for our six development variables.
Our first two outcomes, cognitive and noncognitive skills, are ob-
tained from the Swedish Conscript Register and hence are avail-
able only for male children. Our remaining four variables
measure scholastic achievement in ninth grade, the last year of
compulsory schooling. Our primary outcome, obtained from the
Ninth Grade Register, is the child’s overall GPA. From 2003, we
also have information from the National Tests Register about
performance on mandatory tests in Swedish, English, and math-
ematics. The six outcomes in Table IX have been normalized in a
representative sample so that the effect size estimates can be
interpreted in population standard deviation units.
Our measure of cognitive skills is the recruit’s score on a
cognitive test similar to the Armed Forces Qualification Test. In
addition to taking the test, recruits meet with a military psychol-
ogist who assesses their ability to deal with the psychological re-
quirements of military service. The psychologist’s assessment is
our measure of noncognitive skill. Previous work has shown it to
be a reliable predictor of labor market outcomes even conditional
on cognitive skills (Lindqvist and Vestman 2011). The estimated
WEALTH, HEALTH, AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT
723
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/131/2/687/2606947 by guest on 01 June 2019
 effect on cognitive skills is �0.11 standard deviation units and
borderline significant (95% CI �0.21 to �0.02). The estimated
effect on noncognitive skills is �0.03 standard deviation units
(95% CI �0.19 to 0.12). For both outcomes, our estimates are
clearly bounded away from the household-income gradients,
which are 0.22 for cognitive skills and 0.16 for noncognitive
skills.
The estimated effects on scholastic achievement, reported in
columns (3)–(6), are also all negative, ranging from �0.02 stan-
dard deviation units for GPA to �0.08 standard deviation units
for English. For GPA, our 95% CI is �0.08 to 0.03 standard devi-
ation units. By way of comparison, the estimated household-
income gradient is 0.26. We can thus reject causal effects far
smaller than the gradient. The same conclusion holds for test
scores in Swedish (95% CI �0.11 to 0.04 standard deviation
units), English (95% CI �0.17 to 0.00 standard deviation units),
and mathematics (95% CI �0.13 to 0.07 standard deviation
units).

Notes. This table summarizes the findings from our analyses of the prespecified child development
outcomes. Wealth is scaled in million SEK and all variables are standardized so that coefficient estimates
are in population standard-deviation units. Gradients are obtained by regressing each outcome on the 10-
year sum of annual household disposable income in a representative sample selected using the same
cohort and age restrictions as in the lottery analyses (see Online Appendix Table AXXIII). We control
for the child’s birth characteristics. In all lottery regressions, we also control for the winning parent’s
demographic characteristics. Standard errors are clustered using an iterative algorithm that assigns
siblings and half-siblings to the same cluster. Resampling-based p-values are obtained from 1,000
Monte Carlo simulation draws in which the prizes are permuted randomly within each cell. The hetero-
geneity p-value is from a two-sided t-test of the null hypothesis that the gradient and causal parameter
are equal.

 V.C.
Robustness and Heterogeneity
We conducted a number of follow-up analyses of the findings
in Tables VIII and IX. To simplify the exposition, we restrict these
analyses to 15 variables: 9 key health outcomes and the 6 devel-
opmental outcomes. We relegate most results to the Online
Appendix. Our discussion here is selective and seeks to accom-
plish two primary aims, the first of which is to evaluate the ro-
bustness and heterogeneity of the two effects that survived
multiple-hypothesis correction: obesity and five-year all-cause
hospitalizations (hereafter, ‘‘hospitalization’’).
Online Appendix Table AXXIV shows that the effect size es-
timates for obesity and hospitalization do not change appreciably
if the treatment variable is instead defined as the prize per child,
although the obesity effect is no longer statistically significant. In
our nonlinearity analyses (Online Appendix Table AXXV), we
find that the estimated effect on hospitalization is of similar mag-
nitude when we drop small (<10K), large (>2M), and very large
prizes (>4M) prizes, whereas the obesity coefficient falls by 30–
40% with the largest prizes dropped. In our main heterogeneity
analyses, we stratified the sample by: (i) household-income
(bottom quartile versus top three quartiles), (ii) child age at the
time of the lottery (above or below nine), (iii) winning parent
(father or mother), and (iv) child’s sex (male or female). In all
eight subsamples, wealth is estimated to increase hospitalization
risk, significantly so in six cases (Online Appendix Tables
AXXVII–AXXVIII). The estimated effects on obesity are also
directionally consistent across all the heterogeneity analyses
and statistically significant in two subsamples: low-income
households and households where the mother won. Overall,
these analyses suggest that the hospitalization effect shows up
robustly across specifications, whereas the obesity findings are
less definitive.
The second aim is to systematically compare the causal effect
estimates obtained from our eight subsamples to the household-
income gradient. For the six developmental outcomes, we con-
ducted a total of 44 heterogeneity analyses: 8 for each of the
four scholastic achievement variables, and 6 for each of the two
skills variables (only available in males, making sex-stratified
analyses impossible). Of the 44 estimated treatment effects, all
but 2 are statistically distinguishable from the population
WEALTH, HEALTH, AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT
725
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/131/2/687/2606947 by guest on 01 June 2019
 gradients at the 5% level,23 and 7 are statistically distinguishable
from zero at the 5% level, always with estimates implying adverse
effects on developmental outcomes. The difference between the
causal estimates and the household-income gradients is especially
striking for GPA, where our 95% CIs allow us to reject positive ef-
fects one third as large as the household-income gradients in all
eight subsamples. For health, the overall pattern of results is very
different: our lottery-based estimates are typically not distinguish-
able from the household-income gradients. The only major exception
is our hospitalization variable, for which we can reject the house-
hold-income gradient in all eight subsamples.24
V.D.
Comparison to Previous Causal Estimates
As a complementary benchmark for our estimates, we com-
pared them to the range of effect sizes reported in meta-analyses
of the causal impact of income on child outcomes (Duncan,
Morris, and Rodrigues 2011; Cooper and Stewart 2013). These
studies measure effects in units of standard deviations of the out-
come per $1,000 of annual income. Using this scale, Cooper and
Stewart (2013) reported positive effects in the range of 0.04–0.22
for studies finding effects on skills and scholastic achievement (of
the 21 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria in their study
and examined cognitive/scholastic outcomes, 16 reported positive
effects and 5 reported null results). The meta-analysis of Duncan,
Morris, and Rodrigues (2011) was restricted to welfare-to-work
experiments and reported an effect size range of 0.04–0.05 for
cognitive skills.25 It is noteworthy that even in the studies report-
ing positive effects at the lower end of these effect size ranges, the
causal estimates exceed the income gradients.26
There is no unassailable way of making our estimates com-
parable to those in previous studies. We proceed by measuring
23. Both exceptions are observed in the sample of children treated after the age
of nine. In this population, the upper bound of our 95% CI is 0.26 for mathematics
(gradient 0.21) and 0.22 for Swedish (gradient 0.20).
24. The fact that our estimated effects are robustly bounded away from the
household-income gradients for the developmental outcomes but not the health
outcomes is primarily due to the gradients being smaller for the health outcomes.
25. The original effect size ranges cited in this paragraph were measured in
year 2000 or year 2001 prices. To make them comparable to our estimates, the
coefficients have been converted to year 2010 prices.
26. Two prominent examples are Milligan and Stabile (2011) and Dahl and
Lochner (2012).

 the shock to annual income as the annual payout that each lottery
prize would generate if it were annuitized over a 20-year period at
an actuarially fair price and a real return of 2.3%.27 For point of
reference, 1M SEK thus annuitized corresponds to an annual
income increase of $8,800. A sustained increase in net annual
income of that magnitude is large enough to move most house-
holds two to three deciles up the distribution of permanent
income. Because the households in our sample enjoy an increase
in income that lasts longer than the income supplements studied
in previous quasi-experimental or experimental studies, our
rescaled estimates will, all else equal, overstate the benefits of
wealth in Sweden if the effects of income are positive and
cumulative.
In all eight subsamples, we can rule out wealth effects on
GPA smaller than 0.01 standard deviations, one quarter as
large as the effects at the bottom end of the range reported in
earlier studies with positive findings. To illustrate, Figure III
plots our estimates, rescaled as described, of the causal effects
on GPA from our pooled sample and four subsamples. To illus-
trate the point that the effect sizes in most published quasi-ex-
perimental studies exceed the gradient, the household-income
gradient is depicted on the far left of the graph.28 Replacing
GPA in Figure III by any of the other five developmental out-
comes gives substantively identical results.
Cooper and Stewart’s meta-analysis also covers physical and
mental health outcomes. For these, effect sizes in studies with
positive findings always exceed 0.03 standard deviation units
(but are usually much larger). There are several reasons this
lower bound may be a less informative benchmark for our
health estimates than the corresponding lower bound for our de-
velopmental outcomes. The studies of health are fewer and tend
to focus on outcomes whose comparability with our outcomes is
more limited. Also, the tendency for health gradients to be
27. This is the historical return on long-term Swedish government bonds cal-
culated by Waldenstro
¨m (2014). Using the 2010 SEK/USD exchange rate, 1M year
2010 SEK will generate an annual income stream of $8,799. Hence, the original
coefficient estimates must be divided by a factor of 8.799 � �Y, where �Y is the stan-
dard deviation of the dependent variable, to generate what we refer to as our
rescaled estimates.
28. To generate household-income gradients comparable to our rescaled esti-
mates, we calculate the yearly average of 10-year household income and convert it
to $1,000.

This figure compares our lottery-based estimates, rescaled for comparability, of the causal impact of wealth on child GPA in
different subsamples to the household-income gradient estimated in a large representative sample of children. All coefficients are in
standardized GPA units. Gradients include controls for birth demographics and the lottery estimates additionally include demographic
controls for the winning parent. Standard errors are clustered using an iterative algorithm that assigns siblings and half-siblings to
the same cluster.

 smaller in Sweden (Online Appendix Figure AVIII), perhaps due
to features of the Swedish health care system, may exacerbate
concerns about external validity. With these caveats in mind, it is
nevertheless interesting to note that our rescaled effect size esti-
mates for the health outcomes studied in pre-lottery children con-
sistently allow us to reject effects far below 0.03 standard
deviation units.29 Online Appendix Figure AVIII provides a
graphical illustration for the nine key health outcomes consid-
ered in our follow-up analyses. For total drug consumption, we
can for example rule out effects with an absolute value above
0.004 standard deviation units.
Considered in their entirety, our results clearly show that the
marginal effects implied by our estimates are substantially smal-
ler than previously reported causal estimates. Although hetero-
geneity in the outcome measures considered could explain why
we consistently find smaller effects on health, this explanation is
not credible for the developmental outcomes, where we use vari-
ables similar to those studied in most earlier work. There are
several plausible reasons, none of them mutually exlusive, that
may help explain why we systematically find smaller effects.
A first possible reason is population heterogeneity; most
studies have focused on children from disadvantaged back-
grounds, often in countries that differ in important ways from
Sweden. Yet our estimates allow us to reject positive effects
greater than 0.03 standard deviation units for outcomes such as
drug consumption and school achievement even when we restrict
our subsample to low-income households. For the two skills var-
iables, we can rule out positive effects altogether in our low-
income sample. Our estimates are also smaller than the positive
effects found for some child health and development outcomes in
quasi-experimental studies in Canada and Norway, two countries
that share many institutional features with Sweden (Milligan
and Stabile 2011; Løken, Mogstad, and Wiswall 2012).
Another potential source of the difference is that most policy
changes or welfare-to-work experiments that have been exploited
in earlier studies of income effects involve change to both incomes
and prices (e.g., through changes to taxes or child care subsidies).
Some authors have argued that these studies cannot credibly
29. For birth weight our rescaled estimates are less precise. One study reports
significant positive effects that are contained within our confidence intervals
(Hoynes, Miller, and Simon 2015).

 separate income effects from other changes and may be picking
up difficult-to-model substitution effects (Currie 2009; Mayer
2010; Heckman and Mosso 2014).30 Our estimates, by contrast,
can be interpreted quite unambiguously as income effects.
Finally, most earlier studies have evaluated the consequences
of more modestly sized (usually monthly) income supplements.
One of our lotteries (Triss-Monthly) pays prizes in monthly sup-
plements, but the supplements are much larger than those con-
sidered in previous studies of income support programs. For some
child outcomes, such as GPA, we continue to be able to rule out
effects of $1,000 in annual income larger than 0.05 standard de-
viation units even when we restrict the sample to Triss-Monthly.
The lower effects we report could reflect diminishing marginal
effects of income supplements.
V.E.
Parental Behavior
Even absent any direct evidence of an impact of wealth on
most of our child outcomes, knowing if the wealth shocks have
any discernible impact on parental behaviors is valuable. No var-
iables in administrative records can be unambiguously inter-
preted as measures of parental investments or parenting
quality, but our analysis plan (Cesarini et al. 2014) specified
five outcomes that may be of some relevance for testing theories
of how wealth impacts children’s outcomes. These five variables
are asset transfers, local school quality, parental mental health,
maternal smoking, and duration of parental leave.31 A summary
of the results is that none of the causal estimates are statistically
distinguishable from zero (see Online Appendix Table AXXIX for
the full set of results). For three of the outcomes—duration of
maternal leave, paternal leave, and school quality—we consider
the estimates precise enough to conclude that the behavioral re-
sponses on these margins must be very small. For example, we
can reject positive effects of 1M SEK on maternity leave larger
30. The challenge is to credibly rule out the possibility that the policy changes
used in quasi-experimental studies only impact wealth. See, for example, the con-
cerns voiced by Currie (2009, p. 96) about the welfare-to-work experiments and by
Heckman and Mosso (2014, p. 717) about the studies of Duncan, Morris, and
Rodrigues (2011) and Milligan and Stabile (2011).
31. Psychologists have argued that by reducing stress, more income can im-
prove parenting and maternal health behaviors (Elder 1974; Conger et al. 1994).
In the framework economists use to analyze child development, wealth affects chil-
dren through parental investments in goods and services.

 than 13 days, a small effect given that the average mother claims
386 days of maternity leave benefits.
VI. Discussion
Observational studies consistently find strong gradients be-
tween markers for socioeconomic status and health and child out-
comes. But the causal processes that underlie these relationships
remain poorly understood (Smith 1999; Deaton 2002; Currie
2009; Mayer 2010; Baker and Stabile 2012; Cutler, Lleras-
Muney, and Vogl 2012). We contribute to this literature by pro-
viding credible and statistically precise estimates of the causal
impact of substantial wealth shocks on a rich set of outcomes
available in administrative registers. For most outcomes, we
report estimates that are not statistically distinguishable from
zero but often precise enough to bound the parameter being esti-
mated to a tight range around the point estimate. Three possible
exceptions to our overall finding of zero effects are that wealth
appears to improve adults’ mental health, increase hospitaliza-
tion of children, and perhaps reduce children’s obesity risk.
There are limitations to what can be learned about health
and child achievement gradients by studying the randomized as-
signment of large lottery prizes to Swedish lottery players.
Sweden has a publicly funded and universal health care
system, and an educational system under which schools are pro-
hibited from charging tuition and required to follow a national
curriculum. Consequently, caution is warranted in extrapolating
our results to other settings, especially to developing countries,
where we have sound theoretical reasons to expect larger effects
and evidence consistent with this expectation (Case 2004). Nor
should one infer from our findings that large, positive wealth
shocks will necessarily have small impacts on health care
demand in developed countries without universal health care.
However, health and child achievement gradients show up reli-
ably across developed countries with quite different institutional
arrangements.32 Many theories of the gradients therefore invoke
causal mechanisms that plausibly operate in Sweden and across a
wide range of other cultural and policy environments.
32. For example, neither within- nor cross-country analyses find a strong rela-
tionship between the strength of the health gradient and health care institutions
(Cutler, Lleras-Muney, and Vogl 2012).

 We view our intergenerational estimates as useful primarily
for testing hypotheses about the causes of the graded association
between permanent income and child outcomes. Because our
wealth shocks are large even from a life cycle point of view, and
children in our sample come from a heterogeneous collection of
backgrounds, the setting we consider is especially suitable for
testing predictions about the effects of large windfall gains on
children from households with incomes spanning the income
distribution.
Our results suggest that in a model of child development
parameterized to match conditions in Sweden, the effect of per-
manent income on children’s outcomes is small. With the excep-
tion of obesity risk, we estimate precise zero or negative effects in
subpopulations for which theories of child development predict
larger benefits of wealth. For example, though the mechanism
differs, investment models (Becker and Tomes 1979) and parental
stress models (Bradley and Corwyn 2002) predict larger positive
effects of wealth shocks in families with low incomes. The small
impact of wealth on proxies for parenting behavior may explain
why the shocks to permanent income appear to have few discern-
ible intergenerational impacts. Our conclusions about the impact
of wealth are consistent with the findings from a rigorous study of
Korean-born adoptees who were assigned to U.S. families using a
plausibly random mechanism (Sacerdote 2007), and the struc-
tural literature on child development (Heckman and Mosso
2014). Our findings are also strikingly similar to those reported
by Bleakley and Ferrie (forthcoming) in a study exploiting
the randomized assignment of land in a lottery held in early
nineteenth-century Georgia. Winners were assigned a piece of
land whose value was roughly equal to the median wealth at
the time. Bleakley and Ferrie find no evidence that these substan-
tial wealth shocks affected the human-capital outcomes of win-
ners’ children or grandchildren.
In our adult analyses, our estimates allow us to rule out all
but very modest effects of wealth on overall long-run mortality,
cause-specific mortality, and an array of health care utilization
variables. Three previous studies of lottery players’ health report
statistically significant positive effects on mental health (Lindahl
2005; Gardner and Oswald 2007; Apouey and Clark 2015). The
findings of these previous studies are qualitatively but not quan-
titatively similar to our mental health results. Indeed, one inter-
pretation of our results is that previous studies have lacked
QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

 statistical power to detect effect sizes that our study suggests are
plausible. If so, the effect sizes we estimate are useful for evalu-
ating the credibility of statistically significant findings in earlier
studies on smaller samples. To illustrate, consider the pioneering
study of Lindahl (2005). Converting Lindahl’s estimates to make
them comparable to ours, the estimated effect of 1M SEK on an
index of mental health is 0.42 in standard deviation units (std.
err. = 0.19). In our sample, we can reject effects on our mental
health variable greater than 0.06 standard deviation units. If
we assume 0.06 is a realistic effect size, then Lindahl’s statistical
power to detect such an effect at the 95% level was 6.2%.
Conditional on observing an effect that is significant at the 5%
level, a study with such low power has a 19% chance of incorrectly
signing the coefficient and will overestimate the effect size by a
factor of 7.4.33
Differences in the definition of the outcome variables could
explain why previous studies have found order-of-magnitude
stronger effects on mental health, but not why our mortality re-
sults differ from those reported by Lindahl. He estimates that
100K reduces five-year mortality by 1.30 percentage points
(95% CI �2.22 to �0.41 percentage points) and 10-year mortality
by 1.89 percentage points (95% CI �3.30 to �0.49 percentage
points). In our pooled sample, the analogous estimates are 0.00
for five-year mortality (95% CI �0.06 to 0.06 percentage points)
and 0.07 for 10-year mortality (95% CI �0.03 to 0.16).34 In the 11
subsamples considered in our heterogeneity analyses, our study
had 99% power to detect effect sizes one quarter the size of
Lindahl’s. In this specific case, the discrepancy in findings is
not plausibly attributable to treatment effect heterogeneity.
Our findings of small effects are consistent with the conclu-
sions of a number of quasi-experimental papers using natural
experiments other than lotteries (Meer, Miller, and Rosen 2003;
Frijters, Haisken-DeNew, and Shields 2005; Snyder and Evans
33. These calculations are based on Gelman and Carlin (2014). The implied
effect reported by Gardner and Oswald (2007) is an order of magnitude larger
than Lindahl’s estimate of 0.42 standard deviation units, so similar analyses of
their results would yield even more dramatic conclusions.
34. Lindahl’s estimates are reported in units of 130K year 1998 SEK. Inflation
was 18% between 1998 and 2010, so the estimates in his Table 4 need to be multi-
plied by a factor of 100,000/(1.18*130,000) to be expressed in units of 100K year
2010 SEK. Our coefficient estimates are comparable to these transformed esti-
mates if we divide them by 10.

 2006; Erixson 2014; Schwandt 2014). Economists, placing the
most weight on this evidence, have often concluded that omitted
variables and reverse causation from health to wealth primarily
explain the gradients between income and health (Smith 1999;
Deaton 2003; Chandra and Vogl 2010), whereas epidemiologists
frequently point to the substantial health-wealth correlations—
and their apparent robustness to the inclusion of a large set of
controls—in support of their positions (Marmot 1994). Our esti-
mates reinforce the economists’ skepticism.35
We find little support for what we take to be the predictions
from the epidemiological literature about the impacts of wealth.
Our mental health findings are consistent with income convey-
ing some psychosocial benefits (Adler and Newman 2002;
Marmot and Wilkinson 2006), but we find no evidence that
these benefits translate into improved autoimmune or cardiovas-
cular health. Nor do we find positive effects on health outcomes in
individuals with low socioeconomic status. In our mortality anal-
yses, we find no evidence for a gradual accumulation of positive
effects or that wealth confers large benefits to members of groups
that the epidemiological literature has traditionally identified as
vulnerable.
The identification of the causal processes that produce the
relationships between socioeconomic status and health over the
life cycle is fraught with methodological hazards. One such
hazard is that treating socioeconomic status as a unified concept
may obfuscate the heterogenous effects of its various dimensions
over the life cycle (Deaton 2002; Cutler, Lleras-Muney, and Vogl
2012). Though no silver bullet can answer these pressing re-
search questions, studies of lottery players are one attractive re-
search strategy for understanding how economic resources, one
important dimension of socioeconomic status, impact health and
child outcomes (Mayer 1998; Smith 1999). We find that overall,
the effects of substantial positive wealth shocks are small in the
aggregate and in subsamples. Our results are not incompatible
with the existence of substantial causal pathways from some di-
mensions of socioeconomic status to health but may help narrow
35. Our findings are not at odds with a U.S. literature that shows a within-
month mortality spike in connection with receipt of government transfer payments
(Dobkin and Puller 2007; Evans and Moore 2011, 2012). Similar spikes have been
documented in Swedish data (Andersson, Lundborg, and Vikstro
¨m 2015). These
studies examinetheimpact ofamodestly sizedandanticipatedliquidityshocks;our
study examines the effects of positive shocks to permanent income.
