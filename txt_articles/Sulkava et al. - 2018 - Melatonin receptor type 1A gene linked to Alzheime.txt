Abstract
Disruption of the circadian rhythms is a frequent preclinical and clinical manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, it has been 
suggested that shift work is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Previously, we have reported association of intolerance to shift work (job-
related exhaustion in shift workers) with a variant rs12506228A, which is situated close to melatonin receptor type 1A gene (MTNR1A) and 
linked to MTNR1A brain expression levels. Here, we studied association of that variant with clinical and neuropathological Alzheimer’s 
disease in a Finnish whole-population cohort Vantaa 85+ (n = 512, participants over 85 years) and two follow-up cohorts. Rs12506228A was 
associated with clinical Alzheimer’s disease (p = 0.000073). Analysis of post-mortem brain tissues showed association with higher amount of 
neurofibrillary tangles (p = 0.0039) and amyloid beta plaques (p = 0.0041). We then followed up the associations in two independent replication 
samples. Replication for the association with clinical Alzheimer’s disease was detected in Kuopio 75+ (p = 0.012, n = 574), but not in the 
younger case-control sample (n = 651 + 669). While melatonin has been established in regulation of circadian rhythms, an independent role 
has been also shown for neuroprotection and specifically for anti-amyloidogenic effects. Indeed, in vitro, RNAi mediated silencing of MTNR1A 
increased the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neurons, whereas overexpression decreased it. Our findings 
suggest variation close to MTNR1A as a shared genetic risk factor for intolerance to shift work and Alzheimer’s disease in old age. The genetic 
associations are likely to be mediated by differences in MTNR1A expression, which, in turn, modulate APP metabolism.
Key words:  Alzheimer’s disease; melatonin receptor; genetic association study; gene expression; amyloid beta; neurofibrillary tangles
Statement of Significance
The previous systematic search for molecular genetic risk factors for intolerance to shift work identified a risk variant close to melatonin 
receptor 1a (MTNR1A). Here, we showed association of the same risk variant with clinical and pathological Alzheimer’s disease in the very 
elderly. In line, modulation of the MTNR1A expression level in cell culture regulated amyloid beta production. Thus, we revealed a novel 
molecular genetic connection between circadian phenotype in the working age and neurodegeneration in old age, which supports the view 
that circadian regulation, possibly through weaker physiological melatonin signaling, contributes to the pathological cascade of Alzheimer’s 
disease. Future studies are needed to clarify whether the poor tolerance to shift work per se indicates increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.

 Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia. 
It is clinically characterized by progressive cognitive decline 
and neuropathological changes, including amyloid beta (Aβ) 
plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. The cogni-
tive symptoms in people with Alzheimer’s disease are usually 
accompanied by dysfunction of the circadian system, which 
manifests for example as a fragmented sleep-wake cycle, 
decreased rhythmicity of melatonin secretion, and evening rest-
lessness and agitation [1–3]. This dysfunction has already been 
reported in the preclinical phase [4–6]. In addition, disruption of 
circadian rhythms and sleep deprivation can interfere with the 
pathological cascades of Alzheimer’s disease at least two ways: 
by increasing the generation of the Aβ peptide [7] and by disturb-
ing the normal clearance of Aβ and other metabolites from the 
brain during sleep [8].
Shift work represents a common environmental source for 
disruption of circadian rhythms and sleep deprivation. There is 
evidence of transient cognitive decline in shift workers [9, 10], 
as well as association with the risk of Alzheimer’s disease [11] 
and dementia [12]. No association with the risk of dementia 
or accelerated cognitive decline at later life was visible in the 
recent longitudinal studies [13, 14]. However, cardiovascular 
death as a competing risk is likely to mask potential associa-
tions with dementia, because shift workers have increased risk 
for cardiovascular mortality [11] and, thus, less likely to become 
old enough to have dementia, like demonstrated for smoking 
and dementia [15]. To our knowledge, no studies have examined 
the risk of dementia of those workers with poor tolerance to 
shift work.
In our previous genome-wide study, we identified a genetic 
risk variant for intolerance to shift work by studying shift work-
ers from the general Finnish population and specific occupa-
tional cohorts [16]. The risk variant, rs12506228, which is situated 
downstream of melatonin receptor type 1A gene (MTNR1A), was 
associated with reduced MTNR1A expression levels in cerebellar 
brain tissue in the eGWAS Mayo data. The allele-specific differ-
ences in gene expression were likely mediated by changes in 
DNA methylation in the 5′ regulatory region of MTNR1A [16].
Melatonin has been reported to have neuroprotective and 
anti-amyloidogenic effects: it reduces Aβ production in multiple 
neuronal cell lines [17, 18]. It also decreases amyloid pathology 
and memory deficits in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease 
[19, 20], and reverses the age-related changes in normal aged 
mice [21]. However, it has been unclear if these effects are medi-
ated by the two high-affinity melatonin receptors (coded by 
MTNR1A and MTNR1B) [22] or by other pathways [23]. Melatonin 
secretion decreases with age, and this is especially pronounced 
in people with Alzheimer’s disease [24]. A similar trend of 
age-related decrease has been reported for the expression of 
MTNR1A in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master cir-
cadian clock of the body [25].
We hypothesized that intolerance to shift work and late-
onset Alzheimer’s disease would share genetic risk factors. To 
test that hypothesis, we examined whether MTNR1A variant 
rs12506228 would confer an increased risk of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease in an elderly Finnish population cohort with clinical and 
neuropathological characterization of Alzheimer’s disease. The 
associations with clinical traits were studied further in another 
Finnish population-based sample and in a case-control sam-
ple of Alzheimer’s disease. Because of the previously reported 
association of rs12506228 with decreased MTNR1A expression, 
we also studied the effects of gene silencing by RNAi, as well 
as overexpression of MTNR1A on amyloidogenic processing of 
β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in N2A cells.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Alzheimer’s disease was studied primarily in the Vantaa 85+ 
study [26], a Finnish population-based cohort comprising all par-
ticipants aged 85 years or older from Vantaa, Finland as of April 
1, 1991 (n = 601). The participants were studied at the baseline 
and survivors were re-examined in 1994, 1996, 1999, and 2001. 
A clinical examination was carried out on 553 participants, 534 
with DNA samples available. Dementia status was tested in the 
baseline and during follow-up visits according to the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (third ed., rev., DSM-
III-R) [27], while clinical Alzheimer-type dementia was diag-
nosed in accordance with criteria from the National Institute of 
Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the 
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders 
Association (NINCDS–
ADRDA) [28] as presented in detail previously [26]. In addition, 
all non-demented individuals were followed-up until death for 
symptoms of dementia through a review of their health-care 
records. Mixed cases of vascular and Alzheimer-type dementia 
were classified as vascular dementia and not Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. Thus, participants with Alzheimer-type dementia were 
“pure” cases of Alzheimer’s disease without known vascular 
events. Consequently, the frequency of Alzheimer-type demen-
tia was relatively low in Vantaa 85+ (Table 1). Cognition was 
evaluated using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [29] and 
Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) [30] cogni-
tive tests, and performance in everyday life was evaluated by a 
nurse using a scale from 1 (independent) to 6 (fully dependent). 
Age of onset for dementia was assessed according to the esti-
mated age of onset for symptoms.
Neuropathological autopsies were completed in 304 par-
ticipants (51%) and carried out as described earlier [26]. The 
neurofibrillary tangles were assessed using Braak staging 
[31], and the Aβ plaques using the Consortium to Establish a 
Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) protocol to evalu-
ate the maximum density of the plaques in the cortical sec-
tions. As an additional measure for neocortical amyloid plaque 
load, we performed morphometric analysis of methenamine-
silver stained sections [32, 33]. That trait was transformed 
with natural logarithm to increase normality of the distribu-
tion. Descriptive statistics for the neuropathological meas-
ures are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Neuropathological 
Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis was assessed using the modi-
fied neuropathological National Institute on Aging and Reagan 
Institute (NIA-RI) criteria [34] in order to create a group of indi-
viduals with no Alzheimer’s disease or a low probability for 
Alzheimer’s disease and another group of individuals with a 
high or intermediate probability for Alzheimer’s disease (con-
trols: CERAD scores of no or sparse neuritic plaques and Braak 
stages 0–II, cases: CERAD scores of moderate or frequent neu-
ritic plaques and Braak stages IV–VI). We only included cases 
with diagnosed clinical dementia. Participants who failed to 
fulfill the criteria for either of the groups were excluded from 
that analysis.

 The Kuopio 75+ cohort was collected using a protocol resem-
bling that used in the Vantaa 85+, and it is described in detail 
elsewhere [35, 36]. The baseline phase, carried out in 1998, con-
sisted of a representative sample (n = 700, 5.3%) of inhabitants 
over 75 years of age of Kuopio, Finland, 601 of which were exam-
ined. A follow-up examination was performed 5 years later for 
339 persons. Information for diagnostics was gathered from 
questionnaires, from structured clinical examination and inter-
view by geriatrician and trained nurse, as well as from inter-
views of relatives and caregivers, the clinical records of local 
hospitals, Kuopio University hospital, health care centers and 
home nursing if needed. Dementia diagnoses were established 
in consensus meetings by a neurogeriatrician (RS) using DSM-
III-R criteria for dementia, and DSM-IV criteria [37] for clini-
cal Alzheimer-type dementia (probable Alzheimer’s disease). 
Similarly to Vantaa 85+, mixed cases of vascular and Alzheimer-
type dementia were classified as vascular dementia. Age of 
onset for dementia was assessed according to reported age of 
onset for symptoms. If dementia was diagnosed in the follow-
up but not in the baseline, the age of onset was estimated to the 
midpoint of the 5 years follow-up. DNA samples were given by 
590 individuals. All phenotypes were determined using the lat-
est measure available. At that point, most individuals were over 
80 years old (86.4%), and 36.7% were also over 85 years of age.
The 
“Kuopio 
case-control 
study” 
consisted 
of 
673 
Alzheimer’s disease cases and 686 controls [38]. All patients 
were drawn from Eastern Finland and were examined in the 
Kuopio University Hospital’s memory clinic, and probable 
Alzheimer’s disease was diagnosed according to the NINCDS–
ADRDA criteria [39]. The community-based voluntary unre-
lated control participants were age-matched with the cases 
and derived from the same restricted area of eight commu-
nities in the province of Northern Savo [40]. The mean age of 
onset of dementia was 71.4 (SD = 7.4) for cases, and the mean 
age at examination was 69.1 (SD = 6.2) for controls. Controls 
had no symptoms of cognitive impairment based on a clinical 
interview and neuropsychological examination. The individu-
als were nonoverlapping with the Kuopio 75+ study.
Ethical permissions
All participants, and their relatives in case of dementia, gave 
their informed consent including for the use of genetic data. 
Local ethical committees approved the study protocols. The 
Ministry of Social Affairs and Health granted permission to use 
the health and social care notes for the Vantaa 85+ study par-
ticipants. The Center for Medico-Legal Affairs granted permis-
sion to collect and use autopsy tissue for the Vantaa 85+ study 
participants.
Genotyping
In the Vantaa 85+ cohort, genotypes were extracted from 
Illumina 370 K platform and underwent quality control as 
described previously [41]. Call rates for individuals and markers 
in genome-wide genotyping were >95%. In Kuopio 75+, geno-
typing of rs12506228 was performed with capillary sequencing 
using sequencing primer 5-GGGGCATATCTTTGTCTATGG-3. 
The genotypes were read by hand by two persons. Samples 
were excluded due to missing phenotype data for demen-
tia (n = 1), disrupted sample (n = 10) or failed or low-quality 
sequencing (n = 4/579, 0.7%). Genotyping of rs12506228 in the 
Kuopio case-control study (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium p > 
0.001) was performed by MassARRAY genotyping using iPLEX 
Gold chemistry (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) (an average call 
rate of ≥90%).
Whole-genome sequencing
Samples for whole-genome sequencing from the Vantaa 85+ 
Study were selected based on DNA quality and quantity (more 
than 4 ug left). Three hundred nine samples underwent genome 
sequencing, and, of these, 300 were successfully sequenced. 
Genome sequencing was performed using the Illumina TruSeq 
DNA PCR Free library preparation kit and the HiSeq X10 
sequencing system to produce 150-base pair paired-end reads 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Raw sequence data 
was processed according to Broad Best Practices API (application 
program interface).
Downstream analysis was performed with PLINK v1.9, 
https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2 [42]. Additional qual-
ity control criteria were applied: related individuals (IBD > 
0.185), individuals with discordant sex information, elevated 
missing data rate (>3%) or outlying heterozygosity rate (±2 SD) 
were excluded. Variants with missing per person rate >10%, 
missing rate >5% or significantly different genotype call rates 
between cases and controls (p < 0.00001) were excluded. 
Variants not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 0.00001) 
were also excluded.

 Statistical analysis
SNP association analyses were performed using PLINK, version 
1.07, http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/ [43] for all 
samples, with the exception of the Kuopio case-control sam-
ple, where SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 21.0, 
IBM Corp. Armonk, NY) was used. Quantitative traits were ana-
lyzed using linear regression model and dichotomous traits with 
logistic regression model using additive model adjusting for 
sex. Fixed-effect meta-analyses were performed using GWAMA 
[44]. The statistical tests were two-tailed and the alpha-level of 
p < 0.05 was used for this candidate gene study. No correction for 
multiple testing was performed.
In vitro analysis of the modulation of APP 
metabolism by MTNR1A
A stable mouse neuroblastoma N2A cell line (N2A/APP) over-
expressing the human APP751 isoform was selected and main-
tained using G418. Human MTNR1A cDNA (BC116900) was 
purchased from OpenBiosystems/ThermoFisher and subcloned 
to the pcDNA6/V5-His vector. For the characterization of the 
effects of MTNR1A on APP metabolism, N2A/APP cells were tran-
siently transfected with either pcDNA6-MTNR1A overexpres-
sion plasmid or MTNR1A/B3 shRNA plasmid using the JetPEI 
reagent (Polyplus) according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
(Supplementary Methods). The media was changed at 24-hour 
post-transfection and melatonin (1 or 10 μM; Sigma) or a vehi-
cle was added to the cells for another 24 hours. Conditioned 
media was collected at 48-hour post-transfection and cleared 
of debris by centrifugation at 3000× g. Cells were washed twice 
with ice-cold PBS and harvested, with the total protein content 
determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce/Thermo), and 
an equal amount of protein per sample was analyzed in Western 
blots as described previously [45]. For soluble amyloid precur-
sor protein-β (sAPPβ) detection, equal volumes of conditioned 
media were analyzed on Western blots. The following antibodies 
were used: APP C-terminal (A8717, Sigma), sAPPβ (Covance), APP 
N-terminal (sAPPtotal, 22C11, Millipore), MTNR1A (Santa Cruz), 
BACE1 (Santa Cruz), GAPDH (Millipore), and β-tubulin (isoforms 
I+II; Sigma). Western blot images were quantitated using the 
Quantity One software package (Bio-Rad).
Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptides from the conditioned media were 
analyzed using commercially available sandwich ELISA kits 
according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Human Amyloid-β 
(1–40) Assay Kit 27718 and Human Amyloid-β (1–42) Assay Kit 
27719, IBL International GmbH, Germany). Three replicate wells 
per sample were analyzed from three independent experiments. 
Statistical analyses were based on ANOVA with Bonferroni’s 
correction.
Results
Association of rs12506228 near MTNR1A with 
clinical and pathological Alzheimer’s disease
To test the hypothesis of shared genetic background for intol-
erance to shift work and Alzheimer’s disease, we examined 
association of rs12506228 with clinical dementia and pathologi-
cal hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease in the Vantaa 85+ cohort. 
We first analyzed associations with clinical variables (overall 
dementia vs. no dementia, age-of-onset of dementia, Alzheimer-
type of dementia according to NINCDS–ADRDA criteria vs. no 
dementia, baseline cognition and general performance). The 
A allele of rs12506228 was significantly associated with demen-
tia (p = 0.0012, odds ratio [OR] = 1.62), earlier age-of-onset for 
dementia (p = 0.0070, β = −1.15), Alzheimer-type of dementia 
(p = 7.3 × 10−5, OR = 2.06), worse baseline cognitive tests (MMSE: 
p = 2.1 × 10−4, β = −0.26; SPMSQ: p = 1.1 × 10−5, β = 1.15), and worse 
general performance evaluated by nurse (p = 0.0085, β = 0.29) 
(Figure 1A, Supplementary Figures S1–S3).
Next, we looked at association of rs12506228 with neuro-
pathological findings of Alzheimer’s disease. The rs12506228 
variant associated both with amyloid plaques (CERAD score: 
p = 0.0041, β = 0.27) and neurofibrillary tangles (Braak stage: 
p = 0.0039, β = 0.40).
Finally, we studied association with the combined clini-
cal and histopathological measures (modified NIA-RI criteria), 
which represent neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. The rs12506228 was associated with neuropathologically 
defined Alzheimer’s disease (p = 0.0021, OR = 2.69) (Figure 1B, 
Supplementary Figure S4).
Replication of rs12506228 with clinical Alzheimer’s 
disease in another population-based but not in a 
younger case-control sample
We performed replication analysis in Kuopio 75+. A significant 
association of the A allele of rs12506228 was found with clinical 
Alzheimer-type dementia (p = 0.012, OR = 1.53), as well as with 
cognitive test (MMSE: p = 0.040, β = −1.07). The association was 
driven by Alzheimer-type dementia, as the analysis for all types 
of dementia (combined) was nonsignificant (p = 0.14, OR = 1.23).
We then performed a fixed-effect meta-analysis for the old 
cohorts Vantaa 85+ and Kuopio 75+. The association signals 
became stronger (more significant) for clinical Alzheimer-type 
dementia (p = 5.9 × 10–6, OR = 1.75), all types of dementia (p = 0.0011, 
OR = 1.39), and MMSE (p = 8.1 × 10–5, β = −1.59) (Figure 1A).
Finally, in order to test the association in the third sample 
with participants at relatively younger age (mean 71 years for 
cases and 69 years for controls), we studied a clinical case-
control sample from the Kuopio region. In contrast to the two 
population-cohorts comprising the oldest old, no association 
with clinical Alzheimer-type dementia was detected (p = 0.90, 
OR = 1.01, Figure 1C, Table 2). When restricting the analysis to 
cases and controls over 75 years, the number of controls was 
limited to 100, and the same direction of effect with Vantaa 85+ 
and Kuopio 75+ was nonsignificant (p = 0.53, OR = 1.13, Table 2).
Fine mapping of the association signal
To search for potentially causative variants linked to rs12506228, 
we studied whole-genome sequencing data for 278 Vantaa 85+ 
participants and then subjected additional variants to associa-
tion analysis. Variants in the 500 kb region around rs12506228 
were investigated. Supplementary Table S2 shows those 130 
SNPs which have r2 > 0.2 with rs12506228. Out of these variants, 
the strongest associations with clinical Alzheimer’s disease were 
detected with three SNPs, rs11723770 (p = 9.05E-07), rs7684546 
(p = 1.66E-06) and rs78783920 (p = 2.83E-06). The fourth strong-
est association was found with the original SNP rs12506228 
(p = 2.89E-05, Supplementary Table S3). The strongest association

 with CERAD was found with rs4862701 (p = 0.02) and the sec-
ond strongest with rs12506228 (Supplementary Table S4). With 
Braak, no associations stronger than that of rs12506228 were 
detected (Supplementary Table S5). Rs11723770 was genotyped 
also as part of the genome-wide genotyping in the whole Vantaa 
85+ cohort [41]. The association of that variant with clinical 
Alzheimer’s disease (OR = 2.2, p = 1.17 × 10−5) as well as all types 
of clinical dementia (OR = 1.65, p = 0.00059) remained slightly 
stronger than that of rs12506228, but the association with age 
of onset for dementia (β = −0.51, p = 0.23), and neuropathological 
markers, Braak (β = 0.30, p = 0.027) and CERAD (β = 0.23, p = 0.012) 
were weaker to that of rs12506228. All these associating SNPs 
were in high linkage disequilibrium (r2 > 0.8) with rs12506228 
and they are located, as rs12506228, downstream of MTNR1A in 
the intron of the RNA gene F11-AS1.
In addition, rs78783920 (known also as rs2023257), the 
SNP in the highest LD (r2 = 0.91) with rs12506228, is located 
inside a microsatellite length polymorphism at bp 187380340-
187380372 (GRCh37/hg19). The intermediate-sized 13m allele 
of the microsatellite was tightly linked to both the T allele of 
rs78783920 and the risk allele A of rs12506228 [16]. Here, we 
found an association of the 13m allele of the microsatellite,

dementia in a joint analysis of the Vantaa 85+ and Kuopio 75+ 
cohorts (Supplementary Table S6), but the association was 
statistically weaker as compared to that of rs12506228. Thus, 
there are several plausible variants downstream of MNTR1A, 
which may contribute to the signal of association obtained 
with rs12506228.
Inverse correlation of MTNR1A expression levels 
with amyloidogenic processing of APP in vitro
Next, we studied the impact of the MT1 melatonin receptors—
the product of the MTNR1A gene—on proteolytic processing of 
APP by using N2A cells overexpressing the human APP751 iso-
form. MT1 melatonin receptor levels were knocked down by 
RNAi (transfection with MTNR1A shRNA plasmid), or up-regu-
lated by transient overexpression of MTNR1A.
Amyloidogenic processing of APP was increased in cells 
where the MT1 melatonin receptor were decreased, as shown by 
the 40% increase in the levels of sAPPβ, the soluble APP ectodo-
main derived from amyloidogenic cleavage by BACE1 (Figure 2, 
A and B). Conversely, cells overexpressing MT1 melatonin recep-
tors secreted 47% less sAPPβ (Figure 2, A and B). In concordance, 
MT1 melatonin receptor knockdown increased the levels of 
secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 by 30% and 25%, respectively (Figure 2C), 
while both were decreased (by −62% and −67%, respectively; 
Figure 2C) in cells overexpressing MT1 melatonin receptors. 
Modulation of the receptor levels had no impact on the Aβ42 / 
Aβ40 ratio (which would indicate altered γ-secretase cleavage) or 
the levels of APP holoprotein or BACE1, the enzyme responsible 
for the β-cleavage of APP (Figure 2A).
Addition of melatonin (1 or 10 μM) to the media further 
decreased the Aβ levels in cells overexpressing the MT1 receptor 
(Figure 2C). In cells where MT1 receptor levels were reduced by

MTNR1A shRNA plasmids, and treated with either a vehicle or melatonin (1 or 10 μM) for 24 hours. Soluble APP fragments were analyzed from the conditioned media 
with 22C11 (total sAPP) and sAPPβ-specific antibodies. APP holoprotein, C-terminal fragment, and BACE1 levels were analyzed from cell lysates. (B) sAPPβ levels were 
quantitated densitometrically from Western blots. (C) Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels in the conditioned media were determined by sandwich ELISA. *p < 0.05, **p > 0.01, ***p < 0.001.

 RNAi, the addition of melatonin partially compensated for the 
increased Aβ secretion, likely reflecting the incomplete knock-
down by RNAi.
Discussion
Here, we describe an association of an MTNR1A genetic variant 
with neuropathological Alzheimer’s disease as well as clinical 
Alzheimer-type dementia in two elderly population cohorts. 
Our previous study identified the same risk variant for intoler-
ance to shift work, and also reported association of that variant 
with reduced MTNR1A expression. Here, we showed that in vitro 
reduction of MT1 melatonin receptors, the product of MTNR1A, 
promoted Aβ production, likely via enhanced β-cleavage of APP. 
These results support previous studies suggesting that the 
pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (APP metabolism) is 
linked to the circadian regulatory system. Our results raise the 
hypothesis that part of the genetic predisposition to Alzheimer’s 
disease, especially in very old age, is mediated via differences in 
MTNR1A regulation.
The association of rs12506228 with clinical Alzheimer-type 
dementia was found in two cohorts of very elderly population, 
but not in the younger clinical case-control sample. Age is the 
strongest risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, and if old 
age is not reached, the differences in genetic risks and accumu-
lating Alzheimer’s disease pathology may remain unexpressed. 
In our study, higher OR was detected when neuropathologi-
cal changes were taken into account in addition to the clinical 
dementia status, similar to that previously reported for APOE4 
[46, 47]. In Vantaa 85+ none of the 23 participants with A/A geno-
type of rs12506228 were free of severe Aβ or neurofibrillary neu-
ropathology (Supplementary Figure S4). In addition, previously, 
when using cognitively intact and old (> 85 years) “supercon-
trols,” stronger effect size was reported in the Icelandic popula-
tion for a putative protective variant, A673T substitution of APP 
[48], and for a risk variant rs75932628-T of TREM2 [49]. Here, the 
very old individuals in the Vantaa 85+ and Kuopio 75+ cohorts 
without dementia can be considered as “supercontrols” regard-
ing Alzheimer’s disease, who may have lower than general pop-
ulation frequency of the risk variants for Alzheimer’s disease. 
This consequently increases the odds to detect the associations 
as compared to use of younger controls which are not part of the 
same population-based sampling with cases. This kind of pat-
tern of allele frequencies is apparent for rs12506228. (Figure 1C). 
None of the published GWASes for Alzheimer’s disease, to our 
knowledge, have been performed in samples with a mean age 
of over 80 years for cases and controls (GWASes of Alzheimer’s 
disease in Supplementary Table S7), which may explain why 
rs12506228 has not been detected as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s 
disease in earlier studies.
Neuroprotective effects of melatonin have become evident 
[50]. It has been unclear if the neuroprotective and anti-amy-
loidogenic effects of melatonin are mediated by the two high-
affinity melatonin receptors or by other properties of melatonin. 
Neuroprotective effects of melatonin on mitochondrial and the 
Rip2/Caspase-1 cell-death pathways common to many neuro-
degenerative diseases, was demonstrated to be mediated by 
MT1 melatonin receptors [51]. One recent in vivo study in mice 
reported both receptor-dependent and independent effects on 
memory, receptor-dependent effects on antioxidant pathways 
but receptor-independent effects on Aβ plaques and plasma 
Aβ1–42 levels [23]. In contrast, a recent in vitro study demon-
strated receptor-dependent effects on the key enzymes of the 
amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic route of APP process-
ing, BACE1, Presenilin-1, and ADAM10, as well as on the product 
of the non-amyloidogenic route, sAPPα [22]. This is concordant 
with our study, which showed that MT1 melatonin receptor lev-
els modulate the production of Aβ and sAPPβ. In our model sys-
tem, we observed no changes in BACE1 levels, which has been 
previously suggested as a potential mechanism for melatonin-
mediated regulation of Aβ generation [22]. Although our data 
suggest that BACE1 activity may be directly affected by mela-
tonin and MT1 melatonin receptor levels, it is possible that in 
brain tissue both the expression and activity are regulated by 
melatonin signaling in parallel.
In our study, most of the anti-amyloidogenic effect of 
MTNR1A overexpression was visible also without addition of 
melatonin (Figure 2). This is in line with previous reports of the 
constitutive activity of the MT1 melatonin receptors [52–54], 
which can cover 80%–90% of the maximal G-protein activity of 
the receptor [52].
Several, probably coexisting, explanations could be consid-
ered for our finding of the MTNR1A-linked genetic variant as 
a risk factor for the two traits: intolerance to shift work and 
Alzheimer’s disease (Figure 3). First, melatonin has several tar-
gets in the body. Inadequacy of the receptors, in parallel, both 
increases the build-up of amyloid pathology in neurons as 
shown here and destabilizes the circadian rhythm in the SCN, 
which may lead to worse tolerance to shift work [16]. Second, 
the relative lack of melatonin receptors destabilizes the circa-
dian rhythm in SCN, which leads to circadian disturbances and 
sleep problems, subsequently enhancing the behavioral and cel-
lular processes associated with Alzheimer’s disease pathogen-
esis [7, 8]. Third, decreased MT1 melatonin receptor levels in the 
individuals with the genetic risk variant increase the amyloido-
genic processing of APP in neurons and enhance the pathologi-
cal process of Alzheimer’s disease. The preclinical pathological 
changes in the circadian regulatory areas in SCN, pineal gland, 
and cholinergic cells of the basal forebrain, in turn, decrease the 
amplitude of circadian rhythms [55] and lead to worse tolerance 
to circadian challenge of shift work in middle age (mean age 
43–47 years in [16]). Whether intolerance to shift work is a pre-
clinical manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease should be clarified 
by using amyloid imaging techniques and cerebrospinal fluid 
Aβ1–42 measurements showing Aβ build-up in tolerant and intol-
erant shift workers.
In addition, the effect of melatonin signaling on Alzheimer’s 
pathology could be mediated by neuroinflammatory and oxida-
tive stress components in the pathological cascade of Alzheimer 
since melatonin [56, 57] or normally functioning circadian 
rhythms in itself [58] has been suggested to have antioxidant 
and anti-inflammatory properties, partially mediated by mela-
tonin receptors [56].
Some limitations occur which should be noted. Association of 
rs12506228 was studied with human neuropathology, but no with 
amyloidogenic processing in vitro, since the available neuronal 
cell lines were rodent cell lines with different genetic architec-
ture near MTNR1A. We were also lacking the historical infor-
mation of tolerance to shift work/circadian disruption for our 
elderly cohorts to evaluate the direct association of the two phe-
notypes. No correction for genetic structure was included in the 
genetic analyses because of the lack of the genome-wide data on

 Kuopio 75+ or Kuopio case-control samples. However, population 
stratification is not likely to explain the signal of association of 
the MTNR1A variant with Alzheimer’s disease in the Kuopio 75+ 
and Vantaa 85+ samples, as both are based on population-based 
sampling in the area of only one city with very high participation 
rate (92% for Vantaa 85+ and 86% for Kuopio 75+).
Taken together, we have identified a genetic variation near 
MTNR1A that was associated with both intolerance to shift work 
at working age and with Alzheimer’s disease at old age. We fur-
ther demonstrated in vitro that levels of MT1 melatonin recep-
tors regulate the amyloidogenic processing of APP. These results 
support the view that weaker physiological melatonin signaling 
contributes to the pathological cascade of Alzheimer’s disease. 
Future studies are needed to clarify whether poor tolerance to 
shift work per se indicates increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease. 
We also encourage clinical studies with administered melatonin 
to consider the availability of the melatonin receptors.
