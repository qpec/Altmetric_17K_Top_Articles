Background-—Optimal macronutrient distribution of weight loss diets has not been established. The distribution of energy from
carbohydrate and fat has been observed to promote differential plasma lipid responses in previous weight loss studies, and insulin
resistance status may interact with diet composition and affect weight loss and lipid responses.
Methods and Results-—Overweight and obese women (n=245) were enrolled in a 1-year behavioral weight loss intervention and
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 study groups: a lower fat (20% energy), higher carbohydrate (65% energy) diet; a lower carbohydrate
(45% energy), higher fat (35% energy) diet; or a walnut-rich, higher fat (35% energy), lower carbohydrate (45% energy) diet. Blood
samples and data available from 213 women at baseline and at 6 months were the focus of this analysis. Triglycerides, total
cholesterol, and high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were quantified and compared between and within groups.
Triglycerides decreased in all study arms at 6 months (P<0.05). The walnut-rich diet increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
more than either the lower fat or lower carbohydrate diet (P<0.05). The walnut-rich diet also reduced low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol in insulin-sensitive women, whereas the lower fat diet reduced both total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol in insulin-sensitive women (P<0.05). Insulin sensitivity and C-reactive protein levels also improved.
Conclusions-—Weight loss was similar across the diet groups, although insulin-sensitive women lost more weight with a lower fat,
higher carbohydrate diet versus a higher fat, lower carbohydrate diet. The walnut-rich, higher fat diet resulted in the most favorable
changes in lipid levels.

yslipidemia is a major health concern in the United
States as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease that
also may increase risk for other comorbidities.1–3 According
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was
estimated as of 2012 that 28% of US adults aged >40 years
were on some type of lipid-lowering medication, and of that
population, 93% were using a statin.4 Although these medi-
cations are very effective, they may put patients at risk for
drug interactions and undesirable adverse effects. In addition,
overweight or obese persons are more likely to present with
dyslipidemia than leaner persons.5 In addition to cardiovas-
cular disease, strong evidence shows that obesity and fat
distribution are associated with risk for many types of
cancer.6 There also is compelling evidence that overweight
status and obesity influences overall health outcomes and
likelihood of comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease
among those who have been diagnosed with cancer.7 Weight
loss and diet modification are strategies that may reduce risk
of cardiovascular and other diseases linked to dyslipidemia
and atherosclerosis.
Therapeutic lifestyle changes are the first-choice therapy
recommended to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C) levels and to improve the lipid profile.1,2 Historically,
the most common dietary recommendation to reduce risk for
cardiovascular disease has been to consume a low-fat, higher
carbohydrate diet.8 This dietary approach serves to lower the
intake of saturated fat, which has had the strongest
association with risk of cardiovascular disease; however,
dietary patterns that replace saturated fat with unsaturated
fat rather than carbohydrate, such as the Mediterranean diet,

 can substantially reduce cardiovascular disease risk.9 Fur-
thermore, current evidence suggests that persons who are
insulin resistant or who have type 2 diabetes may benefit
more from a higher fat, lower carbohydrate diet if those fats
are
monounsaturated
and
polyunsaturated
fat.2,10
For
patients with metabolic syndrome, a condition of insulin
resistance, replacing saturated fat with unsaturated fat rather
than carbohydrate and avoiding very low-fat diets has been
recommended to avoid further worsening high triglyceride and
low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.8
Current dietary guidelines for lowering LDL-C recommend
limiting the intake of saturated fat by adhering to either a
higher fat (eg, Mediterranean) or lower fat (eg, Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension, or DASH) dietary pattern.1
A recent meta-analysis of 32 studies comparing low- and
high-fat diets found significant reduction in total cholesterol
and LDL-C in low-fat diets compared with high-fat diets and a
significant increase in HDL-C and decrease in triglycerides in
high-fat compared with low-fat diets.11 Another meta-analysis
of studies of the effects of dietary fat on HDL-C metabolism
also found that replacing carbohydrate with fat (saturated or
unsaturated) significantly increased HDL-C.12
Numerous clinical studies of nut consumption, focused
primarily on the effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors
and markers of inflammation, have observed a minimal (if any)
effect on body weight, despite the potential additional energy
intake contributed by the addition of nuts to the diet.13,14 A
recent meta-analysis of 13 short-term walnut feeding and
walnut-rich diet intervention studies concluded that a walnut-
enriched diet significantly decreased total cholesterol and
LDL-C compared with a control diet.15 Furthermore, a
randomized crossover feeding trial compared the effects of
a Mediterranean diet (high monounsaturated fat, lower
carbohydrate) with those of a walnut-enriched diet (high
polyunsaturated fat, lower carbohydrate) in 21 hypercholes-
terolemic men and women and found that substituting
walnuts for monounsaturated fatty acids significantly reduced
total cholesterol and LDL-C.16
A primary aim of this analysis was to examine the effects
of diet composition on the plasma lipid profile at 6 months
in overweight and obese women participating in a behavioral
weight loss intervention. A secondary aim was to examine
the lipid profile in consideration of insulin resistance status.
The diets compared were lower fat (20% energy), higher
carbohydrate (65% energy); lower carbohydrate (45% energy),
higher fat (35% energy); and walnut-rich (18% energy), higher
fat (35% energy), and lower carbohydrate (45% energy).
Increased
knowledge
of
how
lipid
responses
may
be
influenced by diet composition and insulin resistance may
allow more patient-specific recommendations to optimize the
diet prescription for managing dyslipidemia and reducing
disease risk.
Methods
Study Participants
The behavioral weight loss intervention trial randomized 245
overweight and obese women from a screened sample of
1559 women. To be included in the study, women had to
meet the following criteria: age ≥21 years; body mass index
(in
kg/m2) between 27 and 40; willingness and ability to
participate in clinic visits, group sessions, and telephone
and Internet communications; ability to provide data through
questionnaires and telephone; willingness to maintain con-
tact with investigators for 12 months; willingness to allow
blood collections; no known allergy to tree nuts; and ability
to perform a simple test for assessing cardiopulmonary
fitness.17 Exclusion criteria were any of the following
factors: inability to participate in physical activity due to
severe disability, history or presence of a comorbid disease
for which diet modification and increased physical activity
may be contraindicated, self-reported pregnancy or breast-
feeding or planning a pregnancy within the next year,
current involvement in another diet intervention study or
weight loss program, and history or presence of a significant
psychiatric disorder or any condition that would interfere
with participation in the trial.17 The University of California
San Diego institutional review board approved the study
protocol, and all participants provided written informed
consent.
Prior to enrollment, women were screened for diabetes and
were considered ineligible with a fasting blood glucose level
≥125 mg/dL. Women were also asked to report all prescrip-
tion medications and were asked if they had ever been told by
a doctor that they had high blood cholesterol.
Once enrolled, participants were randomly assigned to 1
of the 3 study arms: lower fat (20% energy), higher
carbohydrate (65% energy) diet; higher fat (35% energy),
lower carbohydrate (45% energy) diet; or walnut-rich (18%
energy), higher fat (35% energy), lower carbohydrate (45%
energy) diet. All diet prescriptions limited saturated fat, so
guidance for the higher fat diet emphasized lean meats and
reduced-fat dairy foods and encouraged monounsaturated
fat as a major (although not sole) source of fat in the diet.
In all diets, prescribed protein intake exceeded recom-
mended levels, although it was slightly lower for the lower
fat diet compared with the others (15% versus 20% of
energy). Randomization was stratified by menopausal status
(aged ≥55 or <55 years
as a
proxy)
and by insulin
resistance status (insulin sensitive or insulin resistant), with
a homeostasis model assessment value of >3.0 indicative
of insulin resistance. Fasting glucose and insulin were
measured at the screening clinic visit to calculate home-
ostasis model assessment for the baseline characterization
of insulin resistance status. Data collection, anthropometric

 measurements, and blood sample collection were con-
ducted at clinic visits at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.
Intervention
Following randomization, participants were provided with a
detailed diet prescription and sample meal plans in an
individual counseling session with a dietitian, with follow-up at
regular intervals by telephone or email to provide additional
support and reinforce adherence. The overall goal of the
dietary guidance was to promote a reduction in energy intake,
aiming for a 500- to 1000-kcal/day deficit relative to
expenditure, according to the individualized prescribed diet
plan (1200, 1500, or 1800 kcal/day). Specific instructions for
the lower fat diet were to choose lean protein sources and
reduced-fat dairy foods and to emphasize vegetables, fruit,
and whole grains as healthy high-carbohydrate choices.
Participants assigned to the lower carbohydrate diet were
educated about higher versus lower carbohydrate choices and
lean protein sources and were instructed to achieve a high
monounsaturated fat intake; examples and recipes were
discussed.
Participants assigned to the walnut-rich study group were
also educated about higher versus lower carbohydrate
choices and lean protein sources. In addition, they were
instructed to consume an average of 42 g (1.5 oz) of walnuts
per day, within their energy-reduced diet plan, and were
provided meal and snack suggestions and recipes to facilitate
adherence. Walnuts were distributed to participants assigned
to that group approximately every 2 weeks, and participants
were instructed to record walnut consumption on a simple
form. Diet prescriptions for participants assigned to the other
2 study groups excluded nuts.
All participants were encouraged to use Web-based
tracking programs that guide dietary intake toward the
prescribed
macronutrient
distribution.
To
facilitate
self-
monitoring, all participants were provided with a scale and a
pedometer,
to
monitor
weight
and
steps
(aiming
for
>10 000 steps per day) on a daily basis, as well as measuring
cups and exercise videos.
The
group-based
behavioral
weight
loss
intervention
involved an intensive 6-month intervention period during which
participants met in closed group sessions weekly for the first
4 months, met biweekly for the following 2 months, and then
met monthly for the remaining 6 months of the program. In
addition to group meetings, participants had telephone and
email counseling contacts with their group coleaders, who had
backgrounds in dietetics, psychology, and/or exercise physi-
ology, to individualize the experience by setting specific
behavioral goals and monitoring progress.17 In addition to
reducing energy intake, the physical activity goal was an
average of at least 60 min/day of purposeful exercise at a
moderate level of intensity plus increased lifestyle activity.
Strategies and approaches that were applied in this intervention
included self-monitoring of food intake and exercise; setting
realistic goals; using behavior-specific goals and a stepwise
approach to progress to promote self-efficacy; addressing body
image concerns; training and role playing in problem solving;
preventing relapse; and modifying problematic thoughts and
attitudes about weight, food, and physical activity.
Outcomes
At data collection clinic visits, weight and height (baseline
only) were measured, body mass index (weight in kilograms/
height in Should be meters squared) was calculated, and
questionnaires were collected by research staff. Fasting
(≥6 hours) blood samples were collected at each clinic visit.
Two-thirds of blood draws were in the early morning after an
overnight fast, and 82% of participants had both fasting draws
within �3 hours of each other. Glucose, total cholesterol,
triglycerides, and HDL-C were measured with the Kodak
Ektachem Analyzer system (Johnson & Johnson Clinical
Diagnostics). LDL-C values were calculated by the Friedewald
equation.18 The ADVIA Centaur assay (Siemens), a double-
antibody immunoassay with chemiluminescent detection, was
used for insulin quantification, and high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein (CRP) was assayed using an electochemiluminiscence
polystyrene-enhanced turbidimetric in vitro immunoassay
(MesoScale Discovery) at the Laboratory for Clinical Biochem-
istry Research, University of Vermont. Accuracy and precision
were monitored by the use of an in-house quality control pool
and laboratory participation in the College of American
Pathologists quality assurance program.
As a biomarker of adherence to the prescribed walnut
intake, the fatty acid profile in red blood cells was determined
using gas liquid chromatography methodology, conducted at
the Wake Forest School of Medicine Lipid and Lipoprotein
Analytic Laboratory. Briefly, the fatty acid moieties of the red
blood cell lipids were converted to more volatile fatty acid
methyl esters following saponification of an aliquot in
ethanolic potassium hydroxide, removal of nonsaponifiables,
and extraction of the acidified fatty acids into hexane. The
fatty acid methyl esters were extracted into isooctane, then
the isooctane was dried with sodium sulfate, and a sample
was injected onto a gas liquid chromatography column. Each
chromatogram was examined for correct identification of fatty
acid peaks and quality control. Results were reported as the
amount and percentage of each identified fatty acid.

 self-reported race and ethnicity. Percentages of participants
reporting any prescription medication for high cholesterol or
any diagnosis of high cholesterol at study entry were
tabulated.
Means and standard errors for levels of cholesterol,
triglycerides, HDL-C, and LDL-C and proportions of partici-
pants with high cholesterol (≥200 mg/dL) at baseline and at
6 months for each study arm (and for all participants
aggregated) were examined. In addition to the lipid analysis,
CRP, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment were also
examined. Analytes that did not conform to a Gaussian
distribution (triglycerides, CRP) were log transformed in
analysis. Mixed models were used to test differences between
lipid levels by diet group assignment and time period and in a
group–time interaction. Mixed models including baseline
insulin resistance status (insulin sensitive versus insulin
resistant) were then tested for differences between these
fixed effects. Mixed models (our primary analysis method)
included partitioned analysis of the least squares means for
an interaction, which is equivalent to custom contrast
statements comparing specific diets, study time, and insulin
resistance status.
Multivariate regression models predicted 6-month levels of
cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, and LDL-C, and potentially
associated factors were baseline level, baseline weight,
percentage weight change at 6 months, age, diet group
(reference was the lower carbohydrate, higher monounsatu-
rated fat diet group), insulin resistance status, and self-
reported prescription lipid-lowering medication.
Significance level was set at a=0.05 for the primary mixed
model analysis and at a=0.01 for the regression models. No
additional correction for multiple comparisons was used. All
analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
The baseline characteristics of the participants are presented
in Table 1. The study enrolled 245 overweight and obese
women, and weight and lipid data were available at 6 months
for 213 women. At enrollment, these women had a mean age
of 50 years and a mean body mass index of 33.5. When
categorized by insulin resistance status, 119 (48.6%) women
were insulin sensitive and 126 (51.4%) were insulin resistant.
Also at baseline, 56 (22.9%) of the 245 women self-reported
that they had high cholesterol; however, only 29 (11.8%) of
those women reported that they were taking a lipid-lowering
medication.
At study entry, participants in each of the 3 diet arms had a
mean percentage of red blood cell a-linolenic acid of 0.12%
(SEM 0.01%). At 6 months, a-linolenic acid levels were
unchanged in the lower fat and lower carbohydrate diet arms,
but in women prescribed the walnut-rich diet, the percentage
had increased to 0.17% (SEM 0.01%) a-linolenic acid (P<0.01).
Baseline red blood cell linoleic acid averaged 13.3% (SEM
0.3%) in all participants, but at 6 months, the walnut-rich diet
participants had a mean of 14.0% (SEM 0.3%) compared with
lower fat diet participants (12.2% [SEM 0.3%], P<0.01) and
lower carbohydrate diet participants (13.1% [0.3%], P=0.03).
Group-by-time P value in a mixed model for the 2 biomarkers
was P<0.05. Approximately 93% of participants assigned to
the walnut-rich diet reported compliance with the regimen,

 although there was some variability across the year of study
participation because of illness, travel, and holidays.
At 6 months, average weight loss was 7.5% of initial weight
in the total sample, and weight loss did not differ significantly
across the diet groups. Percentage weight loss was 8.5%
(SEM 0.7%), 6.3% (SEM 0.7%), and 7.5% (SEM 0.7%) for the
lower fat, lower carbohydrate, and walnut-rich higher fat diets,
respectively. Insulin-sensitive women assigned to the lower
fat diet lost more weight than those assigned to the lower
carbohydrate diet (8.3% [SEM 1.0%] versus 5.4% [1.0%],
respectively) but not those assigned to the walnut-rich diet
(7.9% [SEM 0.9%]; P<0.05). Differential degree of weight loss
in the insulin-resistant women across the diet groups was not
observed, averaging 8.7% (SEM 0.9%), 7.2% (SEM 1.0%), and
7.1% (SEM 1.1%) for the lower fat, lower carbohydrate, and
walnut-rich
diets,
respectively.
Overall,
37%
of
insulin-
resistant women became insulin sensitive at 6 months (35%
in lower fat, 35% in lower carbohydrate, and 40% in walnut-
rich diet groups). CRP decreased in all diet groups (Table 2).
Table 2 shows the changes in lipid levels of the women
from baseline to 6 months, grouped by diet composition
assignment. At baseline, there were no differences in any of
the lipid levels between the 3 study arms. At 6 months, there
was a significant reduction in triglycerides compared with
baseline in all diet groups (P<0.05), and a reduction in HDL-C
level was observed in the lower fat diet group (P<0.01). A
significant decrease in LDL-C was observed at 6 months in
the lower fat (P<0.05) and walnut-rich (P<0.01) diet groups.
There was also a significant reduction in total cholesterol in all
3 of the study groups at 6 months (P<0.01); however, only
the walnut-rich diet group had a notable reduction in the
percentage of participants with high cholesterol (P<0.05). The
walnut-rich diet group increased HDL-C more than the lower
fat diet group (P<0.01) and more than the lower carbohydrate
diet group (P<0.05).
The lipid levels in response to diet composition catego-
rized by insulin resistance status are presented in Table 3.
At baseline, statistically significant differences were found
in the level of triglycerides between insulin-resistant and
insulin-sensitive participants within each study arm and all
inclusively, regardless of study group assignment (P<0.01
for each). Women who were insulin resistant within the

 lower fat and walnut-rich diet arms also differed in HDL-C,
with
significantly
lower
HDL-C
(P<0.01).
As
expected,
insulin differed by insulin resistance status (P<0.05) and
declined significantly in insulin-resistant women. CRP gen-
erally declined in association with weight loss, also as
expected.
At 6 months, there were significant decreases in triglyc-
erides within all 3 diet arms in women who were insulin
resistant (P<0.05). There was a significant decrease in HDL-C
in insulin-sensitive women in the lower fat diet group
(P<0.05). A significant decrease in LDL-C was observed only
in the insulin-sensitive women of the walnut-rich diet arm
(P<0.01). Total cholesterol decreased from baseline in all
groups except in the insulin-resistant women in the lower
carbohydrate diet study arm (P<0.05).
The lower carbohydrate diet study arm was used as the
reference group to examine different factors that were
potentially associated with the lipid levels at 6 months
(Table 4). The baseline levels were all significantly positively
associated
with
the
6-month
follow-up
measurement
(P<0.01), as expected. In addition, there was a significant
association between percentage weight change and total
cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-C (P<0.01 for each). Insulin
resistance was also positively associated with triglyceride
level at 6 months (P<0.01). Moreover, it should be noted that
a positive relationship was seen between the lower fat diet

Discussion
Overall weight loss in the behavioral weight loss intervention
was similar across the diet groups, although women who were
insulin sensitive lost more weight with a lower fat diet than a
lower carbohydrate diet. Weight loss was generally associated
with an improvement in the lipid profile, but there were
differences depending on insulin resistance status and diet
composition. The walnut-rich diet resulted in the most
favorable changes in lipid levels while promoting a degree
of weight loss that was comparable to the lower fat diet.
Differential weight loss in response to diet composition in
relation to insulin resistance status has been observed in 2
previous studies.10,19 In those studies, insulin sensitivity was
associated with more weight loss in response to a lower fat
(versus lower carbohydrate) diet, and insulin resistance was
associated with more weight loss in response to a lower
carbohydrate (versus lower fat) diet. We observed differential
weight loss in the insulin-sensitive but not the insulin-resistant
women, although the lipid response to differential diet
composition was more marked among those who were insulin
resistant. Furthermore, insulin-resistant women in all diet
groups demonstrated significant improvement in their home-
ostasis model assessment levels.
Obesity and overweight, associated with excess adipose
tissue, result from energy intake that exceeds expenditure.
Excessive accumulation of adipose tissue can lead to
inflammatory responses that can upregulate the release of
free fatty acids into the blood, resulting in increased
triglyceride levels, especially in those with insulin resis-
tance.20,21 These results suggest that weight loss promoted
by reduced energy intake can potentially have positive
influences on triglyceride levels for women who are insulin
resistant, given that the women lost weight and, presumably,
reduced central fat deposits.
Women who were insulin resistant, but not those who
were insulin sensitive, had a reduction in triglyceride levels
by 6 months in all 3 diet groups. These findings are
consistent with current understanding of insulin resistance,
in which the impaired ability to manage glucose leads to a
higher level of triglycerides in response to carbohydrate
consumption. McLaughlin et al suggested that when labora-
tory data for insulin concentration are not readily available,
quantifying plasma triglyceride levels would be a practical
option
for
identifying
insulin
resistance
in
overweight
persons.22 The beneficial effects of the walnut-rich diet on
lipids were especially pronounced for the insulin-resistant
women.
Regular consumption of nuts has been consistently
associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.23
Compared with most nuts, which contain monounsaturated
fatty acids, walnuts are a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty
acids, particularly the x-3 fatty acid, a-linolenic acid, and x-6
linoleic acid. Walnuts also provide several bioactive con-
stituents that may exert anti-inflammatory effects, such as
antioxidants (tocopherols, phenolic compounds, and ellagic
acid).24 Several studies have observed decreased inflamma-
tory markers with the consumption of walnuts.25–27 The
additional anti-inflammatory properties of walnuts provide
potential benefits in addition to effects on lipids.

 A meta-analysis conducted by Yanai et al found that HDL-C
increased when carbohydrates were substituted by fatty
acids, and the reverse was also observed.12 Our findings
support those prior reports. Increased HDL-C in response to
the walnut-rich diet in this study may result from the high
polyunsaturated fat content of walnuts. HDL-C increased in
the walnut-rich study arm, and the effect was most substan-
tial in women who were insulin sensitive. An established
inverse relationship between HDL-C and triglycerides28 could
suggest that the higher levels of triglycerides found in women
who were insulin resistant may have attenuated the response
of HDL-C to the walnut-rich diet.
Women in both the lower fat and walnut-rich diet groups
demonstrated a significant reduction in LDL-C, particularly
for insulin-sensitive women in the walnut-rich diet group.
There have been consistent findings of decreased LDL-C in
both low- and modified-fat diets in numerous studies.16,29,30
All 3 diets examined in this study were low in saturated fat;
therefore, the decrease in LDL-C was consistent with the
relationship
between
saturated
fat
intake
and
LDL-C.
Although it was observed that LDL-C was reduced with each
of these diet compositions, a study conducted by Ros et al
found greater reduction in LDL-C in response to a walnut-rich
diet compared with a Mediterranean diet.16 Antioxidants
from walnuts also may help reduce the amount of oxidized
LDL-C,
suggesting
additional
potential
benefits
beyond
effects on lipid levels.
Strengths of this study included its randomized design and
its in-depth comparison of lipid levels in response to diet
composition with further analysis based on insulin resistance
status. This lipid study was an analysis within a weight loss
intervention study, and the statistical power assessed for the
project was determined for weight loss and not changes in
lipid levels. In addition, although 245 women were enrolled,
when participants were divided into individual diet groups and
further stratified by insulin resistance status, statistical power
was reduced because of small sample sizes in the subgroups
that
were
compared.
Further
investigation
with
power
assessed specifically for lipid analysis should be considered
for future studies. Another limitation is the lack of assessment
of lipoprotein particle size, known to be associated with
cardiovascular risk and responsive to dietary intervention. The
sample consisted of women, so these results may not be
generalizable to men.
Finally, a limitation is the lack of detailed information
about dietary intake and specific adherence to the pre-
scribed diets. The target was a free-living population, so
variability in adherence is likely. Self-reported dietary data
have well-recognized limitations of accuracy, characterized
as
substantial
underreporting
and
misreporting
among
overweight and obese persons. An implication of this
limitation is that it is not known whether the differential
responses among those assigned to the various diets may
be due to differential adherence. Given the weight loss
demonstrated by most study participants, we can assume
that most were adhering to a reduced-energy diet. In
addition, changes in the dietary biomarkers (red blood cell
fatty acids) indicate good adherence in the walnut-rich diet
group, as observed in previous walnut feeding and walnut-
rich diet intervention studies.9,16
In conclusion, results from this study provide better
understanding of lipid response to diet composition in
consideration of insulin resistance status. Weight loss in the
behavioral weight loss intervention was comparable across
lower fat, higher carbohydrate and walnut-rich diets. Weight
loss was generally associated with an improvement in the lipid
profile but was influenced by insulin resistance status and diet
composition. Decreased CRP was observed in all diet groups
as well as improved insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant
women. The walnut-rich diet resulted in the most favorable
changes in lipid levels while still associated with a degree of
weight loss that was comparable to the lower fat diet.
