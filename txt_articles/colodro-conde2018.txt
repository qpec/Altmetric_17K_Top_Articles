IMPORTANCE Urban life has been proposed as an environmental risk factor accounting for
the increased prevalence of schizophrenia in urban areas. An alternative hypothesis is that
individuals with increased genetic risk tend to live in urban/dense areas.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether adults with higher genetic risk for schizophrenia have an
increased probability to live in more populated areas than those with lower risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Four large, cross-sectional samples of genotyped
individuals of European ancestry older than 18 years with known addresses in Australia, the
United Kingdom, and the Netherlands were included in the analysis. Data were based on the
postcode of residence at the time of last contact with the participants. Community-based
samples who took part in studies conducted by the Queensland Institute for Medical
Research Berghofer Medical Research Institute (QIMR), UK Biobank (UKB), Netherlands
Twin Register (NTR), or QSkin Sun and Health Study (QSKIN) were included. Genome-wide
association analysis and mendelian randomization (MR) were included. The study was
conducted between 2016 and 2018.
EXPOSURES Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia derived from genetic data (genetic risk is
independently measured from the occurrence of the disease). Socioeconomic status of the
area was included as a moderator in some of the models.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Population density of the place of residence of the
participants determined from census data. Remoteness and socioeconomic status of the area
were also tested.
RESULTS The QIMR participants (15 544; 10 197 [65.6%] women; mean [SD] age, 54.4 [13.2]
years) living in more densely populated areas (people per square kilometer) had a higher
genetic loading for schizophrenia (r2 = 0.12%; P = 5.69 × 10−5), a result that was replicated
across all 3 other cohorts (UKB: 345 246; 187 469 [54.3%] women; age, 65.7 [8.0] years;
NTR: 11 212; 6727 [60.0%] women; age, 48.6 [17.5] years; and QSKIN: 15 726; 8602 [54.7%]
women; age, 57.0 [7.9] years). This genetic association could account for 1.7% (95% CI,
0.8%-3.2%) of the schizophrenia risk. Estimates from MR analyses performed in the UKB
sample were significant (b = 0.049; P = 3.7 × 10−7 using GSMR), suggesting that the genetic
liability to schizophrenia may have a causal association with the tendency to live in urbanized
locations.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The results of this study appear to support the hypothesis
that individuals with increased genetic risk tend to live in urban/dense areas and suggest the
need to refine the social stress model for schizophrenia by including genetics as well as
possible gene-environment interactions.

n 2011, Lederbogen and colleagues1 published a func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging study that showed
greater brain activation of the stress-processing pathways
inparticipantslivinginurbanvsruralareasandsuggestedthere
and in a later study2 that the greater social stress of urban liv-
ing could explain the well-documented higher prevalence of
schizophrenia observed in urban than rural environments
(odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.53-1.92).3 Herein, we investigate an
alternative, but not incompatible, explanation: people with
higher genetic risk for schizophrenia tend to live in more ur-
banized areas owing to selective migration4 in either past or
current generations.
eAppendix 1 in the Supplement presents a short review of
the literature in this area. In summary, living in an urban en-
vironment,whichisitselfpartiallyheritable,5isassociatedwith
increased risk of developing schizophrenia after controlling for
potentialconfounders(age,sex,ethnicity,druguse,socialclass,
family history, and season of birth) and using different mea-
sures of urbanicity (population size or density6,7), window of
exposure (birth,4,8 upbringing,1,6 or illness onset7,9), and dis-
ease definition (narrow schizophrenia or broad psychosis7,10).
Although the association is established, its putative (familial)
environmental or genetic components are unclear. It has been
suggested that approximately 30% of all schizophrenia cases
could be potentially prevented if the exposure to urban envi-
ronments was removed, assuming urban environment is a
causal factor.10 However, it is not clear whether urban resi-
dence has a causal effect on mental health or whether urban
residence is a consequence of the disease (eg, migration to the
city of people in the prodromal stages of the disorder6).
In the present study, we sought to examine the nature of
this association by testing whether adults older than 18 years
with higher genetic risk for schizophrenia are more likely to
live in urbanized and populated areas (measured as popula-
tion density) than those with lower genetic risk. If so, this
finding would suggest that the higher prevalence of schizo-
phrenia in cities is not only a consequence of the urban envi-
ronment. This determination has been made possible by the
advances in the identification of common genetic variants as-
sociated with schizophrenia in large discovery samples11 and
the development of polygenic risk scores (PRS) in indepen-
dent samples.12 In addition, we checked that the association
could not be explained by differences in socioeconomic sta-
tus (SES) of the residential areas. We also investigated the di-
rection of causation between schizophrenia and population
density using multi-instrument mendelian randomization
(MR).13,14 For completeness, we present the estimates of the
twinheritabilityandgenome-wideassociationanalyses(GWAS)
of our main phenotypes.
Methods
Cohorts and Variables
We performed the analyses using a discovery cohort of 15 544
participants genotyped as part of a series of studies of general
healthconditionsconductedbytheGeneticEpidemiologyUnit
at Queensland Institute for Medical Research Berghofer Medi-
cal Research Institute (QIMR), Australia15,16 (Table 1; eAppen-
dix 2, eTable 1, and eFigure 1 in the Supplement provide co-
hort and variable descriptions). We used the UK Biobank (UKB)
(n = 456 426),17,18 the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR)
(n = 16 434),19 and the Australian QSkin Sun and Health Study
(QSKIN)sample(n = 15 726)20toreplicateandextendouranaly-
ses (Table 1; eAppendixes 3-5, eTable 2, eTable 3, eFigures 2-5
in the Supplement provide cohort and variable descriptions).
The QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute-Human
Research Ethics Committee approved the study. The study was
conducted between 2016 and 2018.
Statistical Analysis
Variance Component Analysis
We analyzed data from 5894 twins from the QIMR sample to
estimate the contribution of additive genetic influences (nar-
row sense heritability), shared/familial environment, and
unique environment to the interpersonal differences in popu-
lationdensity,remoteness,andSESoftheresidentialarea(eAp-
pendix6intheSupplementprovidesmoreinformationontwin
and family studies). We used the OpenMx24 package in R25 to
estimate the parameters of the mixed models. Significance of
thevariancecomponentswastestedusinglikelihoodratiotests
on nested models.26 We used the same approach to replicate
the results on population density in the NTR cohort.
In the QIMR data, we fit a gene-environment moderator
effect model27 that allows the variance components (herita-
bility, shared environment, and unique environment) to vary
across age (eAppendix 7 in the Supplement). This approach re-
flected previous results from Whitfield et al5 that suggested
thatheritabilityofrural/urbanlivinginAustraliaincreaseswith
age. Finally, we estimated the genetic and environmental cor-
relations between population density, remoteness, and SES
using bivariate twin models.26 All models included age, age,2
sex, age × sex, age2 × sex, GWAS array, and 4 genetic princi-
pal components as covariates.
PRS Analysis
The PRS in the QIMR sample were calculated from the im-
puted genotype dosage scores using GWAS summary statis-
tics from the GWAS meta-analysis from the 2014 Psychiatric
Key Points
Question Are adults with higher genetic risk for schizophrenia
more likely to live in urbanized and populated areas than those
with lower risk?
Findings In this cross-sectional study of 4 community-based
samples from Australia, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands
(N = 504 130), significantly higher genetic loading for
schizophrenia was identified in participants living in more densely
populated areas; mendelian randomization on a subsample
suggests that schizophrenia may have a causal association with
the tendency to live in urban areas.
Meaning The higher rates of schizophrenia in cities may be
accentuated by selective migration to cities of participants with
higher genetic risks.

 Genomics Consortium Schizophrenia Working Group (36 989

by Wray et al.12 We excluded single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) with low imputation quality (r2<0.6) or minor
allele frequency (MAF) below 1%. We selected the most sig-
nificant independent SNPs using PLINK1.928 to correct for sig-
nal redundancy owing to linkage disequilibrium (LD) (criteria
LD r2<0.1 within windows of 10 mb). We calculated 8 differ-
ent PRS using different P value thresholding of the GWAS sum-
mary statistics (eTable 1 in the Supplement provides the num-
ber of SNPs included for each threshold, and eFigure 1 in the
Supplement shows histograms of PRS for schizophrenia). We
used mixed models to test the association between neighbor-
hood variables (population density, remoteness, and SES) and
PRS and set the significance threshold to 3.15 × 10−3 to ac-
count for multiple testing (eAppendix 8 in the Supplement).
We replicated the PRS analysis for the neighborhood vari-
ables in the UKB, NTR, and QSKIN samples using the same
GWAS summary statistics11 and mixed model approach (eAp-

Supplementprovidedifferencesinphenotypicandgeneticdata
and PRS calculation between these samples.
Genome-wide Association Analyses
We performed GWAS of population density or SES in our larg-
est sample, the UKB, using BOLT-LMM29 including age, age,2
sex, age × sex, age2 × sex, and 4 genetic principal compo-
nents 30 on 12 272 635 SNPs with MAF greater than 0.005%.
We ran additional GWAS of population density controlling for
SES and of SES controlling for population density.
We also conducted GWAS of population density in the
QIMR, NTR, and QSKIN cohorts. In the QIMR sample, we used
RAREMETALWORKER31 and controlled for age, age,2 sex,
age × sex, age2 × sex, SES, GWAS array, and 4 genetic princi-
pal components as covariates. We explicitly corrected for re-
latednessusingthekinpedigreeoption.Single-nucleotidepoly-
morphismswithMAFlessthan0.5%orimputationr2<0.6were
excluded, leaving 8 495 074 SNPs for analyses. In the NTR, the
GWAS, corrected for age and sex, was performed using
GCTA-MLMA32,33 to account for relatedness and population
stratification using 2 genetic relationship matrices (one cor-
rects for the related individuals; the second corrects for the
population stratification in the distantly related individuals)
and 5 genetic principal components. The number of markers
included after quality control (r2>0.8 and MAF<0.01%) was
7 636 917. Finally, we performed the GWAS in QSKIN using
PLINK, version 1.90b4.128 with age, sex, and 4 genetic princi-
pal components as covariates, using a total of 7 672 045 mark-
ers after selecting those with r2>0.6 and MAF less than 0.01%.
We used LD score regressions34 to confirm the SNP heri-
tability and the genetic correlations between the measures of
population density across samples. eAppendixes 2-5 in the
Supplement provide details on genetic data of the 4 cohorts.
Mendelian Randomization
Mendelian randomization methods allow us to generate
hypotheses concerning the direction of causation between 2
heritable variables.13 Herein, we relied on the 2014 GWAS
meta-analysis summary results from the Psychiatric Genom-
ics Consortium for schizophrenia and the GWAS results cal-
culated from our samples for population density and SES.
We used MR-Base35 (TwoSampleMR R package36) and
GSMR37 to conduct MR using known schizophrenia SNPs as
instruments, thus testing the selection hypothesis that hav-
ing a higher propensity to schizophrenia (ie, higher PRS) may
have a possible causal association with the tendency to live
in a denser and less remote area (eAppendix 9 in the
Supplement gives more details on MR and our analysis). We
also investigated the reverse hypothesis (population density
or SES inducing onset of schizophrenia) using GWAS results
from our largest sample, the UKB.
Results
Variance Component Analysis
Population density, remoteness, and SES were all signifi-
cantly correlated at a phenotypic level in all samples consid-
ered (eAppendix 10 and eTable 4 in the Supplement). Popu-
lation density and remoteness were heritable (heritability [h2])
in the QIMR sample (Figure 1) (h2 for population den-
sity = 16.9%; 95% CI, 3.4-30.4; P = .01; h2 for remote-
ness = 16.3%; 95% CI, 3.5-29.0; P = .01); the heritability of SES
was not significant (h2 = 11.0%; 95% CI, 0.00-24.6; P = .12).
Shared environment (common environment [c2]) effects ex-
plained a more substantial and highly significant proportion
of the trait variance (Figure 1) (c2 for population den-
sity = 24.3%; 95% CI, 13.1-35.1; c2 for remoteness = 29.1%; 95%
CI, 19.0-40.0; and c2 for socioeconomic status = 26.8%; 95%
CI, 15.6-37.1; all P < .001), which highlights that people tend
to live with or close to their parents or other relatives. Popu-
lation density was also heritable in the NTR (h2 = 12.1%; 95%

of variance (c2 = 36.5; 95% CI, 26.8-45.7; P = 7 × 10−12).
In the QIMR cohort, population density was more heri-
table and less influenced by shared environmental sources as
participants became older (eAppendix 11 in the Supplement),
with the heritability increasing from 9.0% to 25.6% between
ages20and80years.Overthesamelifespan,c2decreasedfrom
44.5% to less than 10.0% (eAppendix 11 in the Supplement),
but variance explained by unique environmental sources (in-
cluding measurement error) remained constant (eAppendix 11
in the Supplement). Similar results were obtained using stan-
dardized estimates, suggesting constant phenotypic vari-
ance across age. In addition, population density, remoteness,
and SES shared environmental influences as indicated by sig-
nificant environmental correlations from the twin models
(eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Polygenic Risk Scores Analysis
Figure 2 shows the percentage of variance of the population
density of the place of residence explained by the PRS for
schizophrenia, with and without controlling for SES. In the
QIMR sample, PRS calculated from all semi-independent SNPs
across the genome (Figure 2) explained the greatest amount
of variance in population density (r2 = 0.12%; P = 5.69 × 10−5),
and still explained (r2 = 0.074%; P < .001) when accounting for
SES. Schizophrenia PRS also were significantly associated with
remoteness (r2 = 0.06%; P = .003) when including all of the in-
dependent SNPs, although the association disappeared when
correcting for SES. eFigure 6 and eAppendix 12 in the
Supplement provide information on the association between
genetic risk for schizophrenia, remoteness, and SES. We did
not find evidence of interactions between sex or age and PRS
for schizophrenia (P > .05) contributing to population den-
sity or remoteness in the QIMR sample.
The association between schizophrenia risk score and
population density was replicated in the NTR (r2 = 0.14%;
P = 8.3 × 10−4 and r2 = 0.073%; P = .002 when correcting for
SES), in the UKB (r2 = 0.088%; P = 7.7 × 10−59; r2 = 0.012%;
P = 1.2 × 10−11 when accounting for SES) and in QSKIN
(r2 = 0.027%; P = .02 and r2 = 0.015%; P = .047 when correct-
ing for SES) (Figure 2). All correlations were in the same direc-
tion, pointing to increased PRS for participants living in more
densely populated areas. Results for remoteness and SES in
QSKIN were consistent with those in QIMR and are presented
in eFigure 7 in the Supplement.
In addition, we tested the association between SES and
schizophreniaPRS.Theassociationdidnotreachstatisticalsig-
nificance in the QIMR or QSKIN sample when taking into ac-
count multiple testing (P > .01) (eFigures 6 and 7 in the Supple-
ment) but was significant in the UKB (r2 = 0.084%;
P = 8.6 × 10−64, correcting for population density) (eFigure 8
in the Supplement) likely because of the gain of power owing
to its very large sample size.
Genome-wide Association Analyses
Six genomic regions reached genome-wide significance for
population density in the UKB, and this number increased to
12 when correcting for SES. Similarly, we identified 13 loci as-
sociated with SES in the UKB when correcting for population
density.Weobservedfewersignificantassociationswithpopu-
lation density or remoteness in the smaller samples, but they
did not correspond to the SNP associations found in the UKB.
TheSNPheritabilityrangedfrom0.6%(QIMR:SE,3.2%)to9.3%
(QSKIN: SE, 4.0%) as estimated by LD score regression (eTable
5 in the Supplement). The genetic correlation between popu-
lation density across samples ranged from 0.30 (SE, 0.44;
P = .49,QSKIN-NTR)to0.61(SE,0.29;P = .04,UKB-NTR).eAp-
pendix 13, eFigures 9-16, and eTable 5 in the Supplement pro-
vide all GWAS and LD score regression results (including GWAS
meta-analysis).
Mendelian Randomization
Finally, we selected between 88 and 94 genome-wide signifi-
cant SNPs for schizophrenia as instruments to perform MR
analyses with population density as the outcome variable af-
ter excluding SNPs showing evidence of pleiotropic effects by
the heterogeneity in dependent instruments outlier analysis
(implemented in the GSMR software).37 These numbers are
consistent with the 108 independent associations reported by
the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium11; the difference arose
from SNPs not being present or not passing quality control in
GWAS of population density and SES.
Estimates from MR analyses performed in the UKB sample
weresignificant(b = 0.049;P = 3.7 × 10−7usingGSMR)(Table2,
Figure 3), suggesting that the genetic liability to schizophre-
nia has a causal association with the tendency to live in ur-
banized locations. We observed similar effect sizes in all other
samples, although the MR results were not significant. We
foundnoevidenceofconfoundingheterogeneityofeffectsizes
(P > .30) or from pleiotropy (P > .05) using the tests imple-
mented in MR-Base. Reverse MR testing (propensity to live in
a more dense or low socioeconomic status area as a cause of
schizophrenia)wasonlysuggestiveofa(larger)associationwith
population density or SES on schizophrenia (b = 0.20; P = .01
using GSMR) as it did not survive multiple testing correction.
This lack of evidence could have been the result of reduced sta-
tistical power, as both genetic instruments had a smaller num-
ber of SNPs (n = 12) (Table 2; eAppendix 14 and eTables 6-10
in the Supplement provide detailed MR results).
Discussion
The present study investigated the association between ge-
netic risk for schizophrenia and characteristics of a person’
s
place of residence (population density, remoteness, and SES)
to test the genetic nature of the association between schizo-
phrenia and population density and infer the direction of cau-
sation. We used data on where people live collected as part of

A-D, Genetic risk for schizophrenia showed positive effects for population
density in all significant associations. Results in bold highlight significant results
after correction for multiple testing. In the discovery Queensland Institute of
Medical Research sample, we accounted for the number of tests performed. In
the Netherlands Twin Register, UK Biobank, and QSkin Sun and Health Study,
we used a significance threshold of .05 as we aimed to replicate the results
found with the polygenic risk scores (PRS) calculated over all independent
genomic regions. However, when multiple PRS were available, we present all of
the results for completeness. Python-based software (LDpred) was used to
conduct the analyses in the NTR cohort.

 placeofresidenceacrosstheUnitedKingdom,althoughthisas-
sociation was not replicated in the 2 Australian samples.
Our MR results in the UKB suggest that schizophrenia risk
could be a causal factor in the choice to live in more densely
populated and low socioeconomic status areas, although more
powered analyses would be required to confirm this result in
the other cohorts (Figure 3). These results are consistent with
the selective migration hypothesis that individuals with ge-
neticliabilityforschizophreniatendtomovetoorremaininur-
ban areas.38 Larger GWAS for the environmental variables are
required to confirm a reverse causation (eTable 9 and eTable 10
intheSupplement)andclarifyhowpsychopathologictraitsand
residential location relate to each other. More data are needed
toclarifytheinfluenceofcomorbidpsychiatricrisks39-41andas-
sociated traits (eg, educational attainment, creativity, or risk
taking)11,40,41 on the reported association.
Our work builds on previous research that reported that
the density of population of where one lives is significantly
heritable5 and on nonmolecular studies showing evidence of
a familial effect (ie, owing to genetics and/or family environ-
ment) in the association between schizophrenia and urban
dwelling.4,42,43
Our results complement 2 recent publications on the in-
terplaybetweenschizophreniariskandneighborhood.10,38The
first, from the Swedish registries (N = 759 536), reported an
association between schizophrenia PRS and low socioeco-
nomic status neighborhood,38 which we replicated in the UKB.
In addition, we found that SES could not completely explain
the association between schizophrenia PRS and population
density.
We found a large environmental correlation between SES
and population density in Australia (bivariate model includ-
ing additive genetic, common environmental, and unique
environmental factors, rC = 0.86, P < .0001; rE = 0.33,
P < .0001) compared with the estimated genetic correlation
(rG = 0.35, P = .34.) (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Thus, SES
is a potential confounder of genetic analyses of population
density, and conversely, population density is a confounder
of SES genetic analyses. Composition of SES measures23
studied here differed in each country and also differ from
the Swedish study.38
A study from the Danish registries found an association
between schizophrenia PRS and urban living only for indi-
viduals aged 15 years, but not at birth,10 and did not study the
neighborhood during adult age. Herein, we showed that the
population density of where a person lives is mostly ex-
plained by shared and unique environment, with the herita-
bility increasing with age (eAppendix 11 in the Supplement).
Thus, we are uncertain whether shared environment con-
founded the results observed in the Danish population. How-
ever, we cannot rule out a genetic association between up-
bringing environment and the disease risk (ie, a passive
gene-environment correlation) in which the association is
driven by the genotype that a child inherits and the environ-
ment in which they are raised. Herein, we rather focused on
anactivegene-environmentcorrelation,presumablydrivenby
selective migration, by including only older participants who
have a higher degree of independence in choosing where they
live. More work is needed to confirm and examine these re-
sults over age groups, which will likely require large, longitu-
dinal cohorts, such as national registries.
We highlighted the importance of age in our analysis by
replicating and expanding previous results5: that place of resi-
denceisheritableandtheheritabilityincreasesovertime,while
the influence of family environment declines (eAppendix 11
in the Supplement). This age effect, together with sex differ-
ences in prevalence and age of onset of schizophrenia,44,45 jus-
tified the study of interactions between PRS and age and sex
that may contribute to the choice of neighborhood; however,
these interactions were not significant in our analyses.

 of power results in a limited PRS instrument that explains only
11.6% of the total trait heritability in the population.11 Thus,
the variance explained by the current PRS, which is based on
common variants, may be only one-tenth of what one would
observewithaPRScapturingthewholegeneticsignal.Asacon-
sequence, the small association with population density re-
ported herein may account for 1.7% (95% CI, 0.8%-3.2%) of the
schizophrenia risk (based on population density explaining

pecially for the variables studied herein (eAppendix 15 and
eFigures 17-19 in the Supplement48). We tried to overcome this
issue using mixed models that are equivalent to fitting all ge-
netic principal components as covariates (eAppendixes 8 and
15 in the Supplement).
Another limitation is the possible sample overlap be-
tween the UKB sample and data used in the schizophrenia
GWAS, which may inflate results from PRS and MR analyses
(eAppendix 16 in the Supplement). However, we estimated the
overlap to be negligible (64 participants or 0.01%, eAppendix

Conclusions
Our findings support the notion that the increased schizo-
phrenia prevalence in urbanized areas is not only owing to
the environmental stressors of the city or other putative risk
factors associated with urbanicity (eg, increased risk of
infection, low vitamin D levels, and substance abuse)49
but also on the genetic risk for the disease. The associated
PRS prediction was replicated across 3 different countries
that likely differ in availability of space, social mobility/
opportunities, associations between population density and
SES of the area, and historical constraints on living environ-

 ment. We showed that the distribution of the genetic risk for
the disorder is not uniform and concentrates in more popu-
lated and urban areas, supporting the idea of an active gene-
environment correlation because of selective migration. Pre-
vious evidence of an environmental association between
city living and schizophrenia risk1,2 is compatible with our
results and reflects that there are genetic as well as environ-
mental risk factors for schizophrenia. Furthermore, we pro-
vide evidence that schizophrenia genetic risk may lead to
individuals (or had led to their ancestors) seeking denser/
urban and low socioeconomic status neighborhoods, which
could in turn be risk factors for the disease.1,2,49
