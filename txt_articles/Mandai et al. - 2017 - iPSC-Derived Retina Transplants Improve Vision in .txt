SUMMARY
Recent success in functional recovery by photoreceptor precursor transplantation in dysfunctional retina has led to an increased interest
in using embryonic stem cell (ESC) or induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal progenitors to treat retinal degeneration. How-
ever, cell-based therapies for end-stage degenerative retinas that have lost the outer nuclear layer (ONL) are still a big challenge. In the
present study, by transplanting mouse iPSC-derived retinal tissue (miPSC retina) in the end-stage retinal-degeneration model (rd1), we
visualized the direct contact between host bipolar cell terminals and the presynaptic terminal of graft photoreceptors by gene labeling,
showed light-responsive behaviors in transplanted rd1 mice, and recorded responses from the host retina with transplants by ex vivo mi-
cro-electroretinography and ganglion cell recordings using a multiple-electrode array system. Our data provides a proof of concept for
transplanting ESC/iPSC retinas to restore vision in end-stage retinal degeneration.
INTRODUCTION
Neonatal and fetal retina sheet transplants are reported to
restore activity in host retinal ganglion cells or superior col-
liculus, a midbrain visual center for motor commands, in
some mice and rats with retinal degeneration (Woch
et al., 2001; Radner et al., 2001; Sagdullaev et al., 2003),
and fetal retinas have been transplanted together with
retinal pigment epithelium into patients with retinal
degeneration and improved vision in some patients
(Radtke et al., 2008). Mechanisms have been suggested as
neurotrophic effect (Radner et al., 2001) or synaptic con-
nections between unspecified inner retinal cells of host
and graft (Seiler et al., 2008, Seiler et al., 2010), but there
is no conclusive evidence that photoreceptors in these
retina transplants can form functional synapses with host
bipolar cells. Recently, Pearson et al. (2012) demonstrated
that postnatal photoreceptor precursor cells can function-
ally integrate into the outer nuclear layer (ONL) of Gnat�/�
mice and restore visual function; in these mice, rod pho-
toreceptors are not functional but transplanted rod cells
can restore scotopic visual function in a dose-dependent
manner. Gonzalez-Cordero et al. (2013) then reported
that mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC)-derived photore-
ceptor precursors can integrate into the ONL of mice retina.
These reports, together with a number of reports describing
protocols to differentiate retinal tissue from human ESCs or
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Kuwahara et al.,
2015; Nakano et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2014), provided a
basis for developing cell-based therapies for retinal degen-
erative diseases. More recently, however, Pearson’s and
another group have reinterpreted their work, as new evi-
dence has emerged that the functional restoration after
photoreceptor transplantation had been more likely the
result of biomaterial transfer from the transplanted cells
to the local photoreceptor cells in the host ONL, rather
than direct integration of the graft cells (Pearson et al.,
2016; Santos-Ferreira et al., 2016). These reports brought
us back to the initial question of whether the transplanted
photoreceptors could make synapses with adult host
retinal cells.
In clinical practice, cell-based therapies would primarily
target end-stage retinas that have lost the ONL, leaving
the secondary retinal neurons missing their partners for
signal input. Therefore, the end-stage retinas can be consid-
ered to be in a different environment for graft cells from
those of disease models retaining ONL that were used in
the previous studies. Recent studies using cell suspensions
of postnatal mouse photoreceptor precursors or human ES/
iPS derived photoreceptor precursors in end-stage retinas,
which have lost the ONL, indicated possible light response
by pupillary reflex and behavior tests, although direct evi-
dence of light response from the graft cells or synaptic
function is still lacking. These graft photoreceptors did
not develop mature morphology with outer segments or
organized ONL structure that is important for photorecep-
tors to efficiently respond to light (Barnea-Cramer et al.,
2016; Singh et al., 2013). In addition, rat fetal retina sheet
grafts (Sagdullaev et al., 2003) apparently survive longer
than mouse cell suspensions (Mandai et al., 2012; West
et al., 2010), and a fetal retinal graft sheet in a clinical trial
was observed to survive 3 years after the transplantation,
while transplants in the form of microaggregates were
no longer detected (del Cerro et al., 2000). Reconstruction
of a structured ONL would definitely be ideal in these
cases, but it has not been clearly demonstrated that an

 ES/iPS-derived structured, retina-like sheet can restore
visual function. The difficulty of proving that visual func-
tion is present in mice and rats adds to the challenge of
developing effective therapies for retinal degeneration.
We previously reported that 3D retinal tissue differenti-
ated from mESC or mouse iPSC (miPSC) retina can develop
a structured ONL of fully mature photoreceptors with
outer-segment structures when transplanted into rd1 end-
stage retinal-degeneration model mice, possibly by form-
ing synapses with host bipolar cells (Assawachananont
et al., 2014). These grafts can integrate with or without
the presence of graft inner cells between the host inner nu-
clear layer (INL) and the graft ONL; the latter most closely
resembles the natural retina and appears most promising
for restoring visual function, although this has not been
demonstrated. More recently, we also showed that hESC
retina can similarly develop and mature after transplanta-
tion in the ONL-lost retinal-degeneration models of rats
and monkeys in a similar manner (Shirai et al., 2015).
Thus, the current question is whether the integrated ONL
responds to light and transmits signals to host upper neu-
rons in the end-stage host retina, especially to the retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs) that subsequently transmit the neu-
ral signals to the brain.
In the present study, we assessed the visual function in rd1
mice with miPSC-retina transplants using a refined protocol
on shuttle-avoidance tests, analyzed the light-responsive
function in retinal transplants using ex vivo micro-electro-
retinogram (mERG) and RGC recordings, and examined
the host-graft contact directly by genetically labeling the
graft photoreceptor terminals. Our data provide a proof of
concept for transplanting ESC/iPSC retinas to treat end-
stage retinal degeneration. Here we also demonstrate prac-
tical, reliable methods for qualitatively and quantitatively
assessing visual function in regenerative studies in mice.
RESULTS
Visualization of Direct Contact between Host Bipolar
Cells and Synaptic Terminals of Graft Rod
Photoreceptors
To clearly identify direct host-graft integration, we gener-
ated iPSC lines that express CtBP2-tdTomato at photore-
ceptor synaptic terminals after differentiation (Nrl-GFP/
ROSA::Nrl-CtBP2-tdTomato) (Figures S1A–S1C). We also
prepared an end-stage retinal-degeneration model mouse
that expresses GFP in rod bipolar cells (L7-GFP/rd1) by
crossing rd1-2J and L7-GFP mice. We found that three of
the Nrl-GFP/ROSA::Nrl-CtBP2-tdTomato lines differenti-
ated to form optic vesicles similar to those we described pre-
viously (Figure S1D). A retinal sheet cut out from an optic
vesicle on differentiation day 13 (DD13) was transplanted
into each L7-GFP/rd1 mouse; after transplantation, the
grafts developed an Nrl-GFP-positive, rhodopsin-positive
ONL with outer-segment-like structures on DD35, as we
showed previously, although GFP positivity was weaker
compared with later DDs (Figures 1A and 1A0) (Assawacha-
nanont et al., 2014), and L7-GFP-positive host bipolar
terminals contacted CtBP2-tdTomato-positive graft re-
gions. CtBP2-tdTomato, which was present along the
margins of the Nrl-GFP-positive graft ONL, colocalized
with
anti-CtBP2
immunostaining
(Figures
1B–1B%).
CtBP2-tdTomato also clustered at the tips of graft bipolar
dendrites where they formed intra-graft synapses with
Nrl-GFP-positive photoreceptors (Figure S2A). These find-
ings indicate that tdTomato represents the CtBP2 expres-
sion at graft photoreceptor terminals. Some terminals in
the host retina were negative for tdTomato (Figure 1C, ar-
rows), suggesting that they were the remnants of host pho-
toreceptors. We also found the outgrowth of tdTomato-
positive graft CtBP2 into the host synaptic layer (Figures
1D–1D%, arrows). We then more closely studied the contact
between L7-GFP-positive host bipolar cells and CtBP2-
tdTomato on graft photoreceptors. In the L7-GFP retina,
GFP-positive bipolar cells mostly overlapped with protein
kinase Ca (PKCa)-positive bipolar cells, but in L7-GFP/rd,
GFP expression was reduced in variable degree in PKCa-pos-
itive cells in some parts of the retina (Figures S2B and S2C).
GFP-positive host bipolar cells sometimes extend their
dendrites even through the remaining graft INL to reach
tdTomato-positive graft CtBP2 (Figure 2A). Although it
was sometimes difficult to distinguish graft and host termi-
nals of either bipolar cells or photoreceptors, our labeling
approach offers evidence of direct contact between the
host L7-GFP-positive bipolar cell dendrites and tdTomato-
positive graft photoreceptor synaptic terminals, such as
seen between bipolar dendrites and CtBP2 in L7-GFP wild-
type retina (Figures 2B and 2C–2C%). We also stained one
of the postsynaptic markers, CACNA1s, that was reported
to localize at postsynaptic ribbon synapses and recently
identified to cross-react with GRP179 (Hasan et al., 2016;
Specht et al., 2009; Tummala et al., 2014). The presence of
CACNA1s was observed at the tips of bipolar cells in a
wild-type retina (Figure 2D), and CACNA1s immunoreactiv-
ities were also present coupled with graft presynaptic termi-
nal, CtBP2-tdTomato, at the tips of L7-GFP-positive bipolar
cells, indicating the presence of host-graft synaptic forma-
tion (Figures 2E and 2E0). We also observed dendrite tips
of PKCa-positive/GFP-negative bipolar cells in the host
retina that were in contact with graft regions labeled by
CtBP2-tdTomato (Figure S2D), implying that host-graft
contact occurred more frequently than was reported by
our labels.
Since in the grafts the rosettes were formed with
inner/outer segments inward and outer plexiform layer

 side outward, basically in the correct position to form host-
graft interaction, we roughly measured the percentages of
the rosette area that can possibly contact host INL (the
presence of graft ONL approximately within 10 mm from
host retinal margin) (Figure S2E). We estimated that graft
photoreceptors of approximately 50.8% ± 7.8% (mean ±
SEM, n = 5) of the total graft area may have access to host
retina to form synapses.
Light-Responsive Behavior Analyzed by
Shuttle-Avoidance System
Because we could not obtain convincing results by optoki-
netic analysis, on the assumption that, with a small piece of
graft in the whole retinal area, these mice may see a very
small, spot-like light in some part of their visual field at
their best, we adapted a shuttle-avoidance system (SAS)
(Figures 3A–3C; see also Experimental Procedures for

 detailed protocols) to test visual function. To detect both
rod and cone function to the greatest extent possible, we
usedamesopiclightstimulusof0.3cd/m2withdark-adapted
mice, and supplied the mice with 9-cis retinol acetate in
case isomerization of all-trans retinol may be inhibited,
since the grafted ONLs often form rosettes with their outer
segments being separated from the retinal pigment epithe-
lium (RPE). The avoidance ratio is often used as an index
(Jiang et al., 1996), but mice tend to move more randomly
when they are not confident of avoiding the stimuli, which
can increase the avoidance ratio simply by chance. Thus,
instead of simply accepting the avoidance rate, we included
inter-trial interval (ITI) counts as an additional observa-
tion: for every tested animal, we fitted the observed results
to a model with three parameters, namely b1, b2, and b3,
and estimated the parameters as features of the animal (Fig-
ure S3A). Among these parameters, b3 showed the effect of
interference with visual function. When the 95% credible
interval of the distribution of the estimated b3 was above
zero, we judged that interference (mostly transplantation
in our study) improved visual function. We included
non-treated rd1 (rd1/B6) mice as reference data (n = 11)
for comparison with each mouse (Figure 3D, black dots
and curves). Another rd1 strain, rd1-2J, was also tested on
this system to check the reliability of the SAS test, and
because rd1-2J were also used in multiple-electrode array
(MEA) analysis. When mice were given simultaneous light
and audio (beep) signals, the wild-type and rd1-2J mice had
similarly high success ratios and low ITIs (Figures S3B and
S3C). However, when we switched to a light-only signal,
the wild-type mice quickly learned to respond whereas
rd1-2J mice did not, with or without 9-cis retinol acetate
treatment, much like rd1/B6 mice (Figures 3D and 3E).
We then tested the rd1 mice with good iPSC-retina trans-
plants by OCT (Figure S3D). After retinal transplantation,
4 of 10 mice with transplants in both eyes (B) and 5 of
11 mice with a transplant in only one eye (M) were judged
to have responded to the light signal (Figures 3F and 3G)
while none of the eyes with poor grafting (graft leakage
in the vitreous space or retinal detachment in rd1/B6)
responded to light. Typical data for a light-responsive
grafted mouse and for one with no response are shown in
Figure 3H; the light-signal tests are shown in Movies S1
and S2 (for M10 and M8, respectively).
mERG and RGC Recordings from Transplanted Host
rd1 Retinas
Next, we used a multielectrode arrays (MEA) system to
analyze mERG and RGC recordings. We previously found
that mERG in the wild-type retina shows the a- and
b-wave-like component similar to the full-field ERG, and
the mERG responses were well correlated with responses
by RGCs (Fujii et al., 2016). In the wild-type retina, the
b-wave that typically represents ON bipolar cell response
as well as RGC ON response disappears by the use of
mGluR6 receptor agonist L-AP4, whereas in rd1-2J mice,
mERG responses were detected only up to 5 weeks old
and all the wave components were abolished by L-AP4,
indicating the modified intra-retinal signal transmission
in these mice (Fujii et al., 2016). In the present study, we
transplanted iPSC retinas into rd1 mice at 7 or more weeks
of age, and tested their responses by MEA 1.5–4 months
later. We analyzed seven retinas after transplantation. The
host mouse lines, ages, graft-source iPSC lines and clones,
and time after transplantation are summarized in Table 1,
along with the number of electrodes on the grafted area
and the recorded mERG or RGC responses. The number
of RGC responses was objectively calculated followed by
the spike sorting and clustering of spike patterns as
described in Experimental Procedures and Figures S5A
and S5B. We detected mERGs only from the grafted area
in all of the samples tested, and representative data are
shown in Figures 4A and S4A. The a- and b-wave amplitudes
were generally much smaller than those of wild-type retina
and grafted retina sometimes elicited irregular mERG wave
patterns,butthepositivewave(b-wave)was morefrequently
observed compared with those of young rd1-2J retina (Fujii
et al., 2016). The pharmacologic features of mERG and
RGC recordings on the representative channels are also
shown from the samples TP-5 (Figures 4A–4D), TP-4, and

 TP-6 (Figure S4B). Typical a- and b-waves were recorded on
channels 15 and 16 (thick graft area), whereas only b-waves
were recorded on channels 25 and 26 (graft margins) (Fig-
ure 4A). L-AP4 treatment abolished the b-waves (black ar-
rows in Figures 4C and S4B) in both cases, in association
with the elimination of transient ON RGC responses (blue
arrows in Figures 4D and S4B), similar to the responses in
wild-type retina in mERG (Figure 4E), indicating that light-
responsive signals were transmitted to ON bipolar cells and
then to host RGCs in the grafted area.
Clustering RGC Light Responses in the Host rd1 Retina
after Transplantation
We also adapted deep-learning methods to cluster the
RGC spike patterns into groups that included both ON
and OFF responses (Figures 5A and 5B). Transient ON,
OFF, and ON-OFF responses were most dominant in the
wild-type (B6) retina with a full-field light flash of 0.45
log cd/m2; these shifted to a transient OFF response
when mGluR6 was blocked (Figure 5A). In retinas from
7-week-old or older rd1-2J mice, all of the spikes were
clustered as non-specific patterns except for 0.2% of the
ON-hyperactive pattern. However, we detected transient
ON responses consistently in the grafted area, with an
average of 5% (0% to 16% at maximum) of all the de-
tected RGC sources from the whole recorded area (Fig-
ure
5A).
The

(RGCs) and their patterns are shown for each tested retina

number of electrodes elicited a higher number of RGC re-

tively) only few or no typical RGC responses were
recorded (Table 1). When the number of typical light
responses
(transient
ON/transient
OFF/ON-OFF)
was
plotted against the number of electrodes with graft, it
showed a linear correlation tendency except for TP-5,
which showed an exceptionally good result among the
tested samples (Figure 5C). These RGC responses over
the graft were clearly distinguishable from residual RGC
activity in the degenerating rd1 retina; rd1 retina eli-
cited either a non-specific pattern with regular intensity
stimuli, or hyperactive patterns (ON, OFF, and delayed)

3D Image Reconstruction of the Samples after MEA
Recordings
To eliminate the possibility of a contaminant response
from graft cells, we reconstructed 3D histological images
of the MEA-recorded area after MEA analysis and carefully
observed host-graft integration over the MEA-recorded
channels (Figures 6A–6C). The sectional views over the
channels presented in Figure 4D (channels 16 and 25)
revealed that the Nrl-GFP-positive graft ONLs expressed
the presynaptic marker CtBP2-tdTomato at the host-graft
interfaces (red arrows) in contact with the host INLs
(white arrows), which contained L7-GFP-positive bipolar
cells (green arrows). Channel 16 showed larger, thicker
graft ONL than those observed in channel 25, consistent
with the presence of marked a-waves on channel 16 but
not channel 25 (Figure 4C).
DISCUSSION
We have previously shown that retinal tissues differenti-
ated from mouse or human ESCs or iPSCs could develop
to form ONLs consisting of mature photoreceptors with
highly differentiated structures such as inner/outer seg-
ments after transplantation in the degenerated host retina
(Assawachananont et al., 2014; Shirai et al., 2015). We also
showed that these graft ONL integrated as a structured
layer to the host inner layers possibly with host-graft

 synaptogenesis. However, the functional evaluation was
yet to be performed.
In the current study, with the use of Nrl-GFP/CtBP2-
tdTomato cell lines with host L7-GFP/rd1 mice, we readily
visualized direct contact between the host-graft cells, and
our observations revealed that host bipolar cells extend
their dendrites into the graft, sometimes even through
the remaining graft inner cells (Figure 1C). Retraction of bi-
polar cell dendrites were observed after photoreceptor
degeneration (Marc et al., 2003), and transplanted photore-
ceptors seem to provide some environmental change for
the host bipolar cells to regrow dendrites. The reason for
and effect of the variable degree of host L7-GFP expression
in PKCa-positive rod bipolar cells with rd1 phenotype is
not known, but the use of the present host-graft combina-
tion may further help to quantitatively access the host-
graft integration in our future studies in optimizing the
transplantation conditions.
To evaluate visual function through behavioral tests, we
first tried optokinetic testing (OKT). Some of the mice with
retinal transplants did not noticeably track the moving bars
but became exceptionally static. Considering the relatively
small graft area and the unknown efficiency of synaptogen-
esis, these mice probably saw a very small, spot-like light in
some part of their visual field. We concluded that OKT was
inadequate for detecting visual function in these mice. In
addition, OKT has shown conflicting results in retinal
degeneration and should be used with caution (McGill
et al., 2012). Likewise, these transplanted mice will not
follow regular light-avoidance behavior patterns if they
only see small or ambient light. This led us to adapt
SAS for objective evaluation of their behavior patterns in
response to light. The SAS requires approximately 2 weeks
of training with beep and light, and 2 more weeks of eval-
uation with a light-only signal, so we restricted the use of
analysis to only the mice with a substantial amount of
subretinal graft as judged by in vivo OCT imaging after
transplantation. There was no difference in the results
between mice with transplants in one or both eyes, and
we assume that the graft area, and possibly the location,
may contribute to the sensitivity of visual perception in
our SAS evaluation.
Forthephotoreceptors tofunction,recyclingofvisualpig-
ments by isomerization and oxidation, from all-trans retinol
to 11-cis retinol, and to 11-cis retinal, is essential (Parker and
Crouch, 2010). The first essential step of isomerization to
form 11-cis retinol is catalyzed by RPE65 in RPE for rod
visual pigments (Redmond et al., 1998) and in Muller cells
for cone visual pigments (Travis et al., 2005). The further
oxidationto restore 11-cis retinal is thencatalyzedby retinol
dehydrogenases (RDHs), which are distributed in retina
and RPE in a number of isoforms with overlapping activities
(Maeda et al., 2007; Parker and Crouch, 2010). Because the
grafted ONLs often form rosettes with their outer segments
being separated from the RPE, isomerization of all-trans
retinol may be inhibited. Since the treatment of 9-cis retinyl
acetate (9-cis retinol acetate) restored the impaired visual
function in Rpe65�/� mice (Maeda et al., 2009), we supplied
9-cis retinol acetate when we performed a behavior test with
light-only signals to supply a substantial amount of the
source of 11-cis retinal, although not the direct competent
form. Partly because SAS was a time-consuming test, we
did not perform the experiments with or without the drug
treatment, or the tests after washout, so we were unable to
determine the effects of 9-cis retinol acetate supplemen-
tation. Treatment of 9-cis retinol acetate had no effect on
unsuccessful transplantation or non-treated rd1 mice, so
the change in SAS results after transplantation is not due
to the protective effect by the treatment.
In electrophysiological evaluation using MEA, we care-
fully evaluated the graft-originated responses not simply
by their presence or absence but by their functional prop-
erties. The presence of mERG responses were hardly de-
tected in rd1 host retinas at 7 weeks or older, and, even
in earlier degeneration, all the wave components were
eliminated by mGluR6 blockade by L-AP4 (Fujii et al.,
2016).
After
transplantation,
marked
light-responsive
mERGs were recorded in the grafted area in all the sam-
ples tested, although the amplitudes were smaller than
those of wild-type retina and the wave patterns were
more variable, indicating that graft is responsive to light.
The presence of the remaining negative-wave compo-
nents after mGluR6 blockade implies that these responses
may originate either from the graft photoreceptors or OFF
components of host second neurons, which were both
absent in rd1 host retinas before transplantation (Fujii
et al., 2016). Furthermore, we were able to record signifi-
cant light-responsive spikes from the host RGC layer,
most of which were clustered as transient ON patterns.
With our MEA system, approximately 20 cells are on
one electrode in the RGC layer, half of which are report-
edly amacrine cells (Jeon et al., 1998). Possible flaws in
interpreting these RGC recordings include (1) residual
responses from the host (cone) photoreceptors, (2) light-
dependent
RGC
responses
from
intrinsically
photo-
sensitive retinal ganglion cells (iRGCs) (Berson et al.,
2002; Hattar et al., 2002; Pickard and Sollars, 2012), and
(3) spikes from graft cells, including graft RGCs, that
may have been exposed on the host RGC surface layer.
As we have described, the possibility of residual host
transient ON function is unlikely. The possibility of
iRGC activities can also be discounted, because the
L-AP4 blockage of mGluR6 demonstrated that the RGC re-
sponses were postsynaptic. We also observed that in the
area where light-responsive RGCs were recorded, the
RGC and inner layers of host retina was present by

 histological examination, leaving little possibility that
these RGC responses were mostly contributed by exposed
graft cells. Interestingly, the channels that elicit RGC re-
sponses and those with evident mERG responses are not
completely the same, such as seen in TP-6 in Figure S4A,
which indicated that the former may represent the graft
status such as the presence of graft photoreceptor outer
segments in correct orientation, whereas the latter may
represent the location of RGCs that eventually received
input from graft light response. A few RGC responses de-
tected outside the graft margin, as shown in Figure 4B,
may also support that the responses derive from the
host RGCs that may include the graft area in their recep-
tive fields.
This proof-of-concept study showed that the iPSC
retina, when transplanted into the eyes of end-stage
retinal-degeneration mice, develops a mature ONL and re-
sponds to light. Nearly half of the mice with retinal trans-
plant showed light-responsive behavior. We recently
showed that the hESC retina can develop and mature after
being transplanted into the eyes of monkeys with ONL-lost
retinal degeneration (Shirai et al., 2015). We are currently
testing the competency of a human iPSC retina to restore
visual function.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with local
guidelines and the ARVO statement on the use of animals in
ophthalmic and vision research. All of the experimental protocols
were approved by the committee of the RIKEN Center for Develop-
mental Biology (CDB).
Animals
The mouse lines rd1-2J and Tg(Pcp2-EGFP)2Yuza were obtained
from The Jackson Laboratory and C3H/Hej Yok Slc strain mice
were obtained from Nihon SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). Tg(Pcp2-EGFP)
2Yuza/rd1-2J (L7-GFP/rd1) mice were prepared by crossbreeding
and establishing homologous transgene-positive rd1-2J lines. The
rd1 (rd1/B6) line was prepared by backcrossing C3H/Hej mice
with C57BL/6JJmsSlc mice for several generations. All mice were
kept on a standard 12:12-hr light/dark cycle. During behavior tests,
the animals were kept in the dark for 24 hr to adapt to darkness. For
anesthesia, mice were anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride
(1 mg/10 g weight; Ketalar, Daiichi Sankyo Propharma) and xyla-
zine (0.04%/10 g weight; Selactar, Bayer Yakuhin), and the pupils
were dilated using tropicamide and phenylephrine hydrochloride
(Midorin-P, Santen Pharmaceutical).
Generation of Nrl-GFP::pNrl-CtBP2-tdTomato Lines
For labeling of synapses, the CtBP2-tdTomato fusion sequence un-
der the Nrl promoter was knocked in, in reverse position, into the
genome ROSA locus of the Nrl-GFP miPSC line, which was gener-
ated from Nrl-eGFP mice (Akimoto et al., 2006; Homma et al.,
2013). The targeting method is summarized in Figure S1A and de-
tails are described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Differentiation of miPSC Retina and Its Subretinal
Transplantation
Nrl-GFP transgenic miPSCs were generated from Nrl-eGFP mice
(Akimoto et al., 2006; Homma et al., 2013), and the genetically
modified lines were maintained and differentiated as already
described (Assawachananont et al., 2014). More details are
described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
In Vivo OCT Imaging after Transplantation
To confirm that the graft was substantially and properly located
in the subretinal space, we obtained SD-OCT (spectral domain
ophthalmic imaging system) images with an Envisu R-series SDOIS
(Bioptogen) 2–4 weeks after transplantation under anesthesia.
Shuttle-Avoidance System Tests
The shuttle-avoidance system (CompACT SAS/W, Muromachi
Kikai) was customized for mesopic testing and placed in a sound-
and light-insulated box. The training/test box consisted of two
chambersseparatedbyadarkwallwithasmallopeningthatallowed
the animal to move freely between the compartments (Figures 3A
and 3B). The basic concept of this study is to evaluate whether a
mouse can learn to avoid the electric shock by moving into the
other chamber by the visual perception of light as a warning signal.
The mouse was placed in the box and trained with simulta-
neous beep and mesopic light (0.3 cd) signals as a pre-warning
for an electric shock delivered 5 s later on the floor bars. The
mouse could avoid the shock by moving to the other chamber,
in which case the trial was considered successful. If the mouse re-
mained in the same chamber and was shocked, the trial was re-
corded as a failure. One series of training or experiments con-
sisted of 30 trials, each recorded as either successful avoidance
or a failure. The signals were given at random intervals. The num-
ber of times the mouse moved between the two chambers in the
intervals between trials, recorded as ITI counts, was also used as a
parameter for analysis. Mice that learned and improved within
the first 10 days of SAS training (using both beep and light sig-
nals) were used in further experiments. Once the mouse attained
a success ratio greater than 70% with simultaneous beep/light sig-
nals, the experiment was performed using only a light signal. In
the transplanted group, 6- to 9-week-old rd1/B6 mice were subre-
tinally transplanted with iPSC retina of DD11-17 iPSC retina, and
SAS training was started at 5 weeks or later after transplantation.
Transplanted animals were given an intraperitoneal treatment of
9-cis retinol acetate (0.0125 mg/mouse/day; Toronto Research
Chemicals) for 4 days each week during the SAS period to supply
a substantial amount of the source of 11-cis retinal in case graft
ONL were not in contact with RPE. Experiments using only light
signals were performed only after the mouse had passed the dual
beep/light-signal test on the same day. Success ratios and ITI
counts using only the light signal were recorded for each mouse
until the response of the mouse appeared to plateau. Training
and experiments were performed daily except for weekends,
with either one series (beep/light) or two series (beep/light fol-
lowed by light only) per day.

 Analysis of the Shuttle-Avoidance Test
To evaluate shuttle-avoidance test results as an index for visual
perception of light, we constructed a binomial generalized linear
mixed model, in which the success rate is described as a function
of ITI count and the retinal implantation state of the animal. Esti-
mating the parameters of the model by Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling using Stan (Stan Development Team, 2016a)
(version 2.10.1) with the RStan library (Stan Development Team,
2016b) (version 2.10.1) in R (R Core Team, 2015) (version 3.3.0),
we tested whether visual acuity had improved in each retina-
grafted mouse based on the posterior distribution of the estimated
parameters.
First, we assumed that the count for successful avoidance
yi within 30 SAS trials, counted on the ith test, followed a binomial
distribution for the probability qi, which is the avoidance probabil-
ity of a single SAS trial during the ith test. Thus, yi can be
described as
yi � Binomial

yijN; qi

N
yi
�

yi�
1 � qi
�N�yi;
0 % yi % N;
N = 30:
Second, we described the probability qi as a function of ITI count,
the retinal implantation state, and the random effect of an individ-
ual mouse. The explanatory variables included a continuous fixed
effect xi for ITI counts of the ith test, a categorical fixed effect
fj for retinal implantation, and individual random effects rj of the
jth mouse; rj was described with a normal distributions with a
mean of zero and variance sj. Applying the logistic transformation,
qi can be described as
qi =

zi = b1 + b2xi + b3fj + rj
fj �

0; when no retina was transplanted

;

where b1, b2, and b3 denote coefficients of the linear predictor zi.
b1 is the base coefficient, which is common among every SAS
test included in the analysis. In other words, this coefficient de-
scribes the qi when ITI count is zero with no interference. b2 is
the coefficient for xi, which shows how the ITI count affects the
shock avoidance rate. This should be positive because if ITI count
increases, the rate for the animal to avoid shock by chance should
increase. b3 is the coefficient showing the effect of interference to
shock avoidance. In this study, retinal transplantation was mostly
the interference. If b3 is positive, the interference is estimated to in-
crease the qi. For each animal with a retinal transplant, this model
was fitted by SAS results using the negative-control rd1 mouse line,
which was backcrossed from C3H/HeJ mice with C57BL/6JJmsSlc
(rd1/B6) mice (n = 11). We judged that the animal’s visual function
improved when the 95% credible interval of the posterior distribu-
tion of b3 was above zero. Moreover, any type of interference can
be tested if it is provided as fi. Therefore, to test the functionality
of this method, we estimated the b3 for wild-type animals
or another group of rd mice (Figure 3D). The estimated b2 was
constantly positive, indicating that the larger the ITI count, the
larger the qi. Uniform priors were applied for every estimated
parameter for MCMC sampling.
Classification of Light Responses by Deep-Learning
Models
The deep-learning model for classifying light responses was built
on an open-source machine-learning platform H2O (version
3.8.2.6) (www.h2o.ai) accessed from R (R Core Team, 2015)
(version 3.3.0). First, a manually classified light-response dataset
(Data S1) was prepared for training and validating the model.
The annotated training dataset used in this study is available in
Data S2 and the light-response binary data can be downloaded at
https://goo.gl/JtQqIF (training_data.xdr). Three thousand light
responses randomly selected from two wild-type retinas and five
rd1-2J retinas (7w–38w) using 1 s of 0.45 log cd/m2 and 3.01 log
cd/m2 light stimuli were classified into 11 clusters based on the
response pattern. Cluster 1 was designated as a non-specific
response, and the following 10 clusters were designated as func-
tional light responses (Figure S4A). Next, applying the training da-
taset, we trained two deep-learning models (models 1 and 2) to
cluster the light responses. Because more than 85% of the recorded
spikes turned out to be cluster 1, model 1 aimed to distinguish be-
tween cluster 1 and non-1 clusters. Model 2 was designed to cluster
the non-1 responses into clusters 2 to 11. Each light response had
20 s of recordings for 2,000 points of spike frequency within a
0.01-s bin. We fed the deep-learning model with these time series
of spiking frequency and with four additional calculated features:
the SDs of before and after the light stimuli, and the mean spiking
frequency difference around the beginning and the end of the light
stimuli (see Data S3 for the detailed calculation formula). We tested
several structures for the deep neural network and chose the
models with the highest accuracy. For the detailed model struc-
tures, please refer to the source code for training (Data S3). In short,
model 1 had 2,004 inputs and two outputs, with four hidden layers
with 128 inputs. Model 2 had 2,004 inputs and 11 outputs, with
five hidden layers with 128 inputs. Every light response in this
study was clustered according to the following rules (Figure S4B):
the response was classified as cluster 1 when the model 1 was
judged so at a confidence level higher than 99.5%, and the remain-
ing (non-1) responses were clustered based on the results of classi-
fication by model 2. The source code and the two models can be
downloaded at https://goo.gl/dTUv1m (clustering.zip) with sam-
ple data. In this study, a single train of spikes had three serial light
responses (See MEA Recordings). The majority rule was adopted;
thus, when more than two out of three responses were classified
into an identical cluster, the cell was classified to the major cluster,
and when not was classified as ‘‘not classified (N.C.)’’.
RGC counts were calculated as the sum of before the treatment of
and after the washout of L-AP4 on each channel, because some-
times the RGC spikes were more evident on either of these two
conditions than the other in a few channels.

et al., 2016). Details are included in Supplemental Experimental
