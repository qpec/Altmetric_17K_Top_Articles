Abstract 
Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is associated with raised peripheral 
inflammatory markers. Mounting evidence also suggests that inflammation is involved in 
suicidal behavior. However, the involvement of inflammation in the brains of depressed 
individuals, and its association with suicidal ideation, needs further clarification. Translocator 
protein (TSPO), which is upregulated in activated glia, predominantly microglia, can be 
measured as an indication of neuroinflammation in-vivo using Positron Emission 
Tomography (PET) and TSPO-specific radioligands.  
Methods: We used [11C](R)-PK11195 PET to compare TSPO availability in anterior 
cingulate cortex (ACC), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and insula between fourteen medication-free 
patients in a major depressive episode (MDE) of at least moderate severity and thirteen 
matched healthy controls. In a post-hoc analysis, we also compared TSPO availability 
between patients with and without suicidal thoughts.  
Results: Multivariate analysis of variance indicated significantly higher TSPO in patients 
compared to controls (p=0.005). The elevation was of large effect size and significant in ACC 
(p=0.022; Cohen’s d=0.95), with smaller, non-significant elevations in PFC (p=0.342; 
Cohen’s d=0.38) and insula (p=0.466; Cohen’s d=0.29). TSPO was not elevated in patients 
without suicidal thinking, but was significantly increased in those with suicidal thoughts 
compared to those without, most robustly in ACC (p=0.008) and insula (p=0.023).  
Conclusions: We confirm evidence for increased TSPO availability, suggestive of 
predominantly microglial activation, in the ACC during a moderate to severe MDE. Our 
findings provide further incentive for evaluating anti-inflammatory therapies in MDD.

Introduction 
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide (1, 2). 
However, approximately one third of patients fail to respond to conventional antidepressants 
(3) and there is a pressing need to develop more effective and better tolerated treatments. A 
promising avenue of research for new treatment strategies is inflammation (4-7), based on 
evidence that at least a subset of individuals with MDD have higher levels of peripheral pro-
inflammatory cytokines (8-11); a high prevalence of depression  in inflammatory medical 
disorders (12); an association of depression and its response to treatment with polymorphisms 
in inflammatory cytokine genes (13); the development of depression in patients administered 
therapeutic pro-inflammatory cytokines (14-16) and healthy volunteers given a peripheral 
immune challenge (17, 18); the association of inflammation with certain risk factors for 
depression (19-22); and evidence that inflammation may be associated with non-
responsiveness to antidepressants (23-25).  
Peripheral inflammation can lead directly to an inflammatory response in the human brain 
(26). In response to inflammation, the metabolism of tryptophan is diverted from the 
production of serotonin (5-HT) to kynurenine (KYN), which is subsequently converted into 
the neurotoxic quinolinic acid (QUIN) by activated microglia and infiltrating macrophages 
and monocytes (27, 28). That this mechanism may be involved in neuroinflammation-
associated depression is supported by observations that activation of the KYN pathway is 
essential for depressive like behavior in rats (29), and that KYN and QUIN are increased in 
the cerebrospinal fluid of cancer patients who had undergone interferon (IFN)-alpha therapy, 
which correlated with depressive symptoms (30). Consistent with this, postmortem studies 
have found increased levels of QUIN in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of depressed 
individuals who had committed suicide (31), and microglial and astrocytic activation in the 
ACC, thalamus and frontal cortex of depressed individuals (32-35). These studies have a 
number of potentially confounding factors including antemortem use of antidepressants, 
 Holmes SE et al. PET imaging of translocator protein in major depression 
Page 5 
which can have significant effects on inflammatory processes (36). A crucial question is 
therefore whether there is inflammation in-vivo in the brains of medication-free individuals 
currently experiencing a MDE.  
One index of neuroinflammation can be measured in-vivo using PET and radioligands 
specific for the 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a mitochondrial protein that is 
upregulated in activated glial cells, predominantly microglia, in a range of pathological 
conditions (37). To date, there have been two published PET studies investigating TSPO in 
MDD in working-age adults. The first found unaltered TSPO in a mild-to-moderate MDE 
(38). A second larger study found increased TSPO in medication-free patients in a moderate-
to-severe MDE (39), most prominently in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), ACC and insula. There 
was, however, considerable overlap between patients and controls, with a subset of patients 
exhibiting higher levels of TSPO. This is consistent with the studies of peripheral 
inflammatory markers in depression, as well as a large survey showing CRP levels ≥5mg/L in 
around 30% of depressed individuals (40). This subpopulation of depressed individuals 
showing heightened inflammation may benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment strategies 
(23, 41, 42).  
Mounting evidence also suggests that neuroinflammation may be particularly pronounced in 
suicidality (43). Robust increases have been found in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-6 in blood 
and postmortem samples of patients with suicidal thinking compared with patients without 
suicidal thinking and controls (44). Furthermore, a higher degree of suicidal ideation has been 
associated with an increased inflammatory index, independent of severity of depressive 
symptoms (45). Multiple postmortem studies have found evidence for inflammation in the 
brains of suicide victims (46, 47), with specific evidence for activated microglia in the ACC 
and PFC of depressed individuals who had committed suicide (32, 33), and significantly less 
microglial activation in the dorsal raphe nucleus in non-suicidal depressed patients who had 
died of other causes compared to suicidal depressed patients and controls (48). However, no 
 Holmes SE et al. PET imaging of translocator protein in major depression 
Page 6 
study to date has investigated the association between neuroinflammation and suicidality in 
depression in-vivo.  
The aims of the current study were therefore to investigate brain TSPO availability in MDD 
and to explore factors that might be associated with heightened inflammation. We used the 
prototypical TSPO radioligand [11C](R)-PK11195 to measure brain TSPO availability in 
patients with moderate to severe depression who were non-smoking, medically healthy and 
antidepressant- naïve or antidepressant-free for at least 8 months. We hypothesized that TSPO 
availability would be higher in ACC, PFC and insula in depressed individuals compared to 
matched controls. These regions were chosen as they are the three regions hypothesised a 
priori in the study by Setiawan et al (39) and found to have significantly elevated TSPO; due 
to their role in mood regulation (49); and based on literature implicating the ACC in 
particular in the association between inflammation and depression (17, 31-33, 50, 51). 
Secondary aims were to explore associations between brain TSPO levels, symptom severity, 
suicidal ideation, exercise levels, childhood adversity and peripheral markers of 
inflammation.

Methods and Materials 
Participants 
Nineteen patients with MDD were recruited from the Manchester region of the UK by self-
referral following placement of advertisements in mental health services, voluntary 
organisations, doctors’ surgeries and online. Three patients were excluded before data 
collection (two for not meeting criteria, one for possibility of pregnancy). Fourteen patients (7 
males; mean ± SD age 31±12 yr) completed the study.  
Diagnosis was confirmed using the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID-I) 
(52). All patients were in a moderate to severe MDE (mean±SD MADRS score 31±4; 
mean±SD HAM-D score 20±3) and had not taken antidepressants for at least eight months. 
Seven of the fourteen MDD patients had taken antidepressants in the past and seven were 
antidepressant-naïve (for details of past medication use see Supplementary Material Section 
1). Patients were sex- and age-matched (±5 yr) with 13 healthy controls (7 males; age 33±11 
yr) recruited as part of this and another recent study (53), and scanned using the same 
protocol. All participants ranged in age from 18-55, were medically healthy based on clinical 
history, physical examination, routine blood tests and negative urine toxicology, and were 
non-smoking. For demographic and clinical characteristics, see Table 1. Additional measures 
included body mass index (BMI); childhood adversity, measured by the Childhood Adversity 
Questionnaire (54); physical exercise, measured by the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise 
Questionnaire (55, 56); and the following markers of inflammation in plasma: TNF-α, IFN-γ, 
IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β and CRP. Exclusion criteria for all participants included substance misuse in 
the previous year, lifetime history of substance dependence, anti-inflammatory medications in 
the previous month, another Axis I disorder, pregnancy, and history of neurological or 
autoimmune disorder. The study was approved by the Greater Manchester East Research 
Ethics Committee and the United Kingdom Administration of Radioactive Substances 
Advisory Committee (ARSAC). All participants provided written informed consent.

Image acquisition and analysis 
The methodology for image acquisition and analysis was recently published (57). In 
summary, following intravenous injection of [11C](R)-PK11195, emission data were acquired 
for 60 minutes on a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT; Siemens/CTI, Knoxville, 
Tennessee). A T1-weighted MRI brain scan was also acquired to exclude significant 
abnormality, for identification of regions of interest (ROIs), and Voxel Based Morphometry 
(VBM) analysis. The hypothesized regions (ACC, PFC, insula) were identified using a 
maximum probability brain atlas (58, 59) in which ACC and insula are individual ROIs. Our 
PFC ROI is a composite of the following atlas ROIs: middle frontal, inferior frontal and 
superior frontal gyri.  
There is no reference region devoid of TSPO for PET studies as TSPO expression is 
ubiquitous throughout the brain. An alternative is to use a tissue with relatively low TSPO 
expression as a pseudo-reference region. To optimise our choice, we compared the use of two 
pseudo-reference regions in our data: i) cerebellar grey matter (GM) (60); and ii) supervised 
cluster reference input function (SVC6), a data-driven method which extracts a cluster of GM 
voxels with kinetic behaviour closest to that of healthy GM (see Supplementary Material 
Sections 2 and 3 for further details). Binding potential (BPND), representing the ratio at 
equilibrium of specifically bound radioligand to that of non-displaceable radioligand in tissue 
(61), was calculated using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) (62) and the two 
pseudo-reference regions. Parametric maps of BPND were generated with a basis-function 
implementation of the SRTM (63) and the individualised GM brain atlases were then 
projected onto these parametric maps to obtain mean BPND values for the ROIs. Overall, 
regional BPND values derived from SVC6 were modestly lower and had higher variance 
compared to using the cerebellar GM input function (data not shown). We therefore present 
the latter data, in concurrence with the superiority of the cerebellum over a data-driven 
approach in the literature (64) and our previous [11C](R)-PK11195 studies on the HRRT (57, 
65-68). TSPO availability in the cerebellum (BPND derived by SVC6) did not significantly 
 Holmes SE et al. PET imaging of translocator protein in major depression 
Page 9 
differ (p=0.77) in our data between healthy controls and MDD patients (see Supplementary 
Material Section 4 for Figure and further details).   
Statistical analysis  
Statistical analysis was performed in SPSS Statistics Version 22 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). 
Independent-samples t-tests and univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to 
assess differences between demographic, clinical and radiotracer characteristics across 
groups. Sex differences were compared using Fisher's exact test (2-tailed). Group differences 
in [11C](R)-PK11195 BPND were determined using a multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA), with 
BPND in ACC, PFC and insula as the dependent variables, and group (MDD or healthy 
controls) as the fixed independent variable. The effect size of the group differences in the 
three ROIs was calculated using partial eta-squared (η2) and Cohen’s d (mean difference 
divided by the pooled standard deviation). In a further exploratory analysis of potential effects 
of suicidal ideation on TSPO availability, patients were stratified into those with and without 
current suicidal thinking and a MANOVA performed with regional BPND (ACC, PFC and 
insula) as dependent variables, and trichotomous group (healthy controls, MDD with suicidal 
thoughts, MDD without suicidal thoughts) as the fixed independent variable, with Bonferroni 
correction for multiple comparisons across the three groups.  
The normal distribution of BPND for each combination of the variables was confirmed by 
Shapiro-Wilk's test (p >0.05) and Normal Q-Q Plot. Equality of covariance was confirmed by 
Box’s test. Homogeneity of variances was checked by Levine’s test. Correlations (Pearson's r, 
2-tailed) were used to determine the association between TSPO availability and symptom 
severity, childhood adversity, exercise and peripheral inflammatory markers in the patient 
group. Comparison of these measurements with healthy controls was not performed as these 
data were not collected for all the controls. Findings were considered significant at the p<0.05 
level.

Results 
Patients and healthy controls were well matched for age, sex, BMI, smoking status (all non-
smoking) and injected mass of radiotracer (see Table 1). For all analyses, ANOVA 
assumptions were not violated. There was no significant main effect of age on BPND 
(MANOVA: F3, 22=0.85, p=0.479).  
Across the hypothesized regions (ACC, PFC and insula) TSPO availability ([11C](R)-
PK11195 BPND) was higher in the MDD patients than the controls by a mean of 39%, which 
was statistically significant (MANOVA, main effect of group: F3, 23=5.63, p=0.005). The 
increase was highest in the ACC (67%), with smaller elevations seen in the PFC (29%) and 
insula (24%). Univariate tests on the individual regions indicated that the elevation in the 
ACC was of large effect size and statistically significant (F1, 25=5.99, p=0.022; partial 
η2=0.193; Cohen’s d=0.95), but was of small effect size and failed to reach significance in 
PFC (F1, 25=0.94, p=0.342; partial η2=0.036; Cohen’s d=0.38) or insula (F1, 25=0.549, p=0.466; 
partial η2=0.021; Cohen’s d=0.29) (see Figure 1 and Table 2). The significance of these 
differences was not materially altered if age was applied as a covariate (see Supplementary 
Material Section 5).  
In the exploratory analysis of the effects of suicidal ideation on TSPO availability, patients 
were stratified into those with (n=9) and without (n=5) current suicidal thoughts. The 
presence of suicidal thoughts was defined as the disclosure of suicidal thoughts during the 
previous two weeks on direct enquiry and a score of 3 or higher on the ‘Suicidal Thoughts’ 
item of the MADRS. Their absence was defined as the denial of any suicidal thinking and a 
score of zero on the MADRS item. There were no significant differences in age, sex, BMI or 
injected mass of radiotracer between the two MDD subgroups. In addition, the two subgroups 
were well matched for overall MDE severity on the MADRS and HAM-D, mean scores being 
high in the moderate depression range for both subgroups (see Table 1). TSPO availability 
differed significantly between the three groups (controls, patients with suicidal thinking, and 
 Holmes SE et al. PET imaging of translocator protein in major depression 
Page 11 
patients without suicidal thinking) across the three regions (MANOVA, main effect of group: 
F6, 46=4.22, p=0.002). Visual inspection (Figure 2) shows a pattern across all three regions 
whereby mean BPND in patients without suicidal thinking is very similar to, or slightly lower 
than, healthy controls; while BPND in patients with suicidal thinking is much higher than in 
both other groups. Univariate tests on the individual regions show that these differences were 
statistically significant and of large effect size in ACC (F2, 24=9.91, p=0.001; partial 
η2=0.452) and insula (F2, 24=4.59, p=0.021; partial η2=0.277), and reached trend significance 
in PFC (F2, 24=3.15, p=0.061; partial η2=0.208). Pairwise comparisons of BPND in each region 
between the three groups, with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons, showed that 
the patients with suicidal thinking had significantly higher TSPO availability than those 
without suicidal thinking in ACC (+118%; p=0.008) and insula (+245%; p=0.023), and trend 
higher TSPO availability in PFC (+129%; p=0.096). Patients with suicidal thinking also had 
significantly higher TSPO availability than healthy controls in ACC (+107%; p=0.001) (see 
Table 2 and Figure 2). Elevations compared to healthy controls in the PFC (+61%) and insula 
(+66%) were not statistically significance (Table 2). Nor were there any significant 
differences between healthy controls and patients without suicidal thinking in any of the 
regions. 
There were no significant correlations between BPND in any of the regions and symptom 
severity (MADRS and HAM-D scores), duration of illness, BMI, childhood adversity, or any 
of the peripheral inflammatory markers. Nor did we find any differences in concentration of 
peripheral inflammatory markers between patients with and without suicidal thoughts. In the 
MDD patients (n=14), a negative correlation between BPND in the ACC and their degree of 
physical exercise reached trend significance (r=-0.47, p=0.07). 
A post-hoc VBM analysis using SPM12 was carried out on the MRI scans to examine the 
potential contribution of differences in GM volume between MDD patients and controls to 
the significant between-group differences in BPND. For details of the VBM methodology, see 
Supplementary Material Section 6. No significant between-group GM volume differences 
 Holmes SE et al. PET imaging of translocator protein in major depression 
Page 12 
were found, suggesting that the significant differences in BPND between groups are unlikely to 
be an artefact of differences in regional tissue volumes. 
A secondary between-group comparison (independent-samples t-test) on nine further ROIs is 
presented in Supplementary Material Section 7. TSPO was higher in MDD patients compared 
to healthy controls in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC; p=0.04). However, this would not 
be considered significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Discussion 
Our study provides the first confirmatory evidence, to the best of our knowledge, for elevated 
TSPO in the ACC of drug-free, working-age adults with MDD in a moderate to severe MDE 
in vivo, following the earlier report of Setiawan et al (39). It also provides the first in vivo 
evidence in humans that elevated TSPO in MDD may be associated more with suicidality 
than the diagnosis of MDD itself.  
Under pathological conditions TSPO expression increases in microglia, infiltrating 
macrophages, astrocytes, and vascular endothelial cells (69-72). However, TSPO ligand 
binding appears to represent principally microglial activation in vivo (37, 73-75). We 
therefore tentatively interpret our finding as support for the presence of microglial activation 
in a moderate to severe MDE, while acknowledging the need for caution in interpreting 
altered TSPO binding in mental disorders in the absence of more selective microglial PET 
markers (72) and that we cannot exclude a contribution from other cell types.  
Although our study design was independent of the Setiawan study, the patients in both studies 
are comparable. All were antidepressant-free non-smokers with similar mean age, symptom 
severity, and normal BMI. Our MDD group size was smaller (n=14 vs 20) while our patients 
were drug-free for longer (>8 months vs >6 weeks). Given this clinical comparability, it is 
interesting that our increases in TSPO across the ACC (67%), PFC (29%) and insula (24%) 
(mean 39%) are similar to the increases of 32%, 26% and 33% (mean ~30%), respectively, 
seen in the Setiawan study. We also found the most robust increase in the ACC. Although 
TSPO was also elevated in the PFC and insula of MDD patients in our study, these group 
differences were of small effect size, were not statistically significant, and we were unable to 
replicate the findings of the Setiawan study in these regions. With [11C](R)-PK11195 the 
signal to noise ratio is low, as reflected in the low BPND values, and this may contribute to 
lack of statistical power. Post-hoc calculation based on the observed effect sizes (Cohen’s d) 
of the between-group differences in our data indicates that group sizes of at least 100 would 
 Holmes SE et al. PET imaging of translocator protein in major depression 
Page 14 
have been required to be fully powered to detect significant differences in PFC and insula (2-
tailed, α=0.05, power=0.8). This suggests that for these regions the combination of the size of 
the biological effect, the variance in the data and the sensitivity of the methodology limit its 
suitability for future studies in MDD in anything other than extremely large group sizes. For 
the ACC, our sample size can detect a significant difference with a power of 0.7, suggesting 
that our methodology is adequate for the ACC. However, in addition to reducing the chance 
of detecting a true effect, low power also reduces the probability that a statistically significant 
result reflects a true effect and increases the chance that the estimate of the effect size is 
exaggerated (76). The modest group sizes and lack of statistical power in our study therefore 
reduces the probability of our positive finding in the ACC and its effect size. On the other 
hand, the probability that elevated TSPO in the ACC is a false positive is controlled by our 
having limited our a priori hypothesis to the three regions which were themselves 
hypothesised a priori in the initial study (39) based on their biological association with MDD, 
and found to have significantly elevated TSPO. We would therefore have needed to be 
particularly fortunate to have obtained this positive finding in the ACC. Nevertheless, further 
replication studies will be important, ideally with group sizes even larger than the initial 
study, to arrive at a more accurate estimation of the effect size in these regions (76). 
We observed significantly greater TSPO in the ACC and insula of patients experiencing 
suicidal thoughts than patients without suicidal thoughts. This is consistent with mounting 
evidence for an association between inflammation and suicide (32, 33, 43, 46, 47, 77-79) and 
a higher specificity of inflammation for suicide than for diagnosis (33, 47, 77). Ours is the 
first study, to our knowledge, to show such an association in-vivo. However, because of the 
small subgroup sizes and post-hoc nature of the analysis, our results are preliminary and 
require replication. TSPO availability in the patients without suicidal thoughts was the same 
as, or slightly lower than healthy controls (Figure 2). We cannot necessarily conclude that 
neuroinflammation is absent in those with normal or lowered TSPO as increased levels of 
inflammatory cytokines can occur with a downregulation (rather than upregulation) of TSPO 
 Holmes SE et al. PET imaging of translocator protein in major depression 
Page 15 
(72). Nevertheless, the pattern of TSPO availability in our patients is consistent with recent 
postmortem findings of significantly decreased microglial activation in non-suicidal 
depressed patients compared to suicidal depressed patients and controls in the dorsal raphe 
nucleus, which provides the major serotonergic innervation to the ACC, PFC and insula (48). 
This is particularly interesting given recent evidence that abnormal 5-HT function measured 
using PET predicts higher suicidal ideation and more lethal suicidal behavior (80). A 
limitation for our study is that there was an overlap between patients experiencing suicidal 
thoughts and those who had taken antidepressants in the past, raising the possibility that there 
are other differences between the two MDD subgroups. Of the nine patients with suicidal 
thinking, BPND was lower in each of the ROIs in the three patients who were antidepressant-
naïve than the six with prior medication use. The fact that these patients had been drug-free 
for at least eight months makes a residual direct effect of antidepressants unlikely. However, 
they reported stopping the antidepressants due to lack of efficacy, and there is some evidence 
for an association between inflammation and non-responsiveness to antidepressants (23-25). 
Although these are very small subgroups, we cannot exclude a potential role of treatment 
resistance in the TSPO increase seen in our patients with suicidal thinking. 
Our results contribute to an emerging view that glial, principally microglial, activation during 
an MDE may be particularly prominent in the ACC. The ACC plays a key role in regulating 
normal cognitive and emotional processing (81) and in the pathophysiology of MDD (82-87). 
Postmortem studies find increased inflammatory markers in the ACC of depressed individuals 
(31-33), and levels of systemic cytokines are associated with increased activation in the ACC 
(17, 50, 51), suggesting that the ACC might be particularly sensitive to heightened peripheral 
inflammation and be central to inflammation-induced changes in mood. The trend-significant 
negative correlation between TSPO in the ACC and physical exercise in our data suggests 
that a potential association between brain inflammation and exercise levels warrants further 
investigation in a larger sample.  
 Holmes SE et al. PET imaging of translocator protein in major depression 
Page 16 
We found no significant correlations between central TSPO and peripheral inflammatory 
markers. The mechanisms of immune-to-brain communication remain to be fully elucidated. 
However, this lack of correlation is consistent with previous PET studies in humans reporting 
both central and peripheral measures in depression (39) and schizophrenia (57, 88), and 
preclinical models involving experimental induction of both local and systemic peripheral 
inflammation (89-92). 
Our study has several additional limitations. Firstly, we used a pseudo-reference region 
(cerebellum). Although the presence of some specific binding in the cerebellum will cause an 
underestimation of the specific binding in the ROIs, this remains a reasonable approach as 
long as there is no significant systematic difference in cerebellar TSPO availability between 
healthy subjects and patients. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published 
postmortem data on TSPO or microglia in the cerebellum in MDD so we cannot exclude the 
possibility that a difference exists. Our finding of no difference in cerebellar BPND (SVC6) 
between patients and controls provides some reassurance that the study findings are not 
confounded by a systematic difference in cerebellar TSPO binding between controls and 
patients. However, this reassurance is to a limited degree and cerebellar BPND is not as strong 
as measurement of cerebellar total volume of distribution (VT) would have been using a 
metabolite-corrected arterial input function. Secondly, a limitation common to all TSPO PET 
studies is that microglia have a range of pro- and anti-inflammatory chemical phenotypes 
including cytotoxic, repair and regeneration, and immunomodulatory (93), and at present PET 
is unable to distinguish between these. However, given the postmortem studies implicating a 
pro-inflammatory microglial phenotype in MDD and in suicide (31, 32), we propose that 
increased TSPO binding in MDD represents a cytotoxic phenotype.  
In conclusion, we have replicated the first PET findings of increased TSPO availability, 
suggestive of microglial activation, in the ACC of medication-free patients in a MDE. Our 
findings add support for the presence of a neuroinflammatory process in MDD and for TSPO 
as a therapeutic target (71). Trials of anti-inflammatory agents in MDD have indicated that 
 Holmes SE et al. PET imaging of translocator protein in major depression 
Page 17 
they might be most effective in a subset of individuals with heightened inflammation, 
suggesting that a more targeted ‘personalised’ strategy might be a successful approach to 
treating depression. It will therefore be important for future research to determine whether 
patients with elevated TSPO would benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment. A potential 
contribution of suicidality to the elevated TSPO in MDD warrants further research in 
adequately powered studies.
