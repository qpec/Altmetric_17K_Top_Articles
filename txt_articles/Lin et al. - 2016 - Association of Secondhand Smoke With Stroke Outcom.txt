igarette smoking, an independent modifiable risk factor 
for cardiovascular disease, doubles the risk of stroke.1 Up 
to 1 in 4 cardiovascular disease deaths in the United States 
each year are attributable to smoking2; the risk is strongly dose 
related.3 Although smoking is a well-established stroke risk 
factor, the associations between secondhand smoking, stroke, 
and mortality after stroke remain uncertain.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 
nearly half of US nonsmokers are exposed to secondhand 
smoke (SHS),4 and no risk-free level of exposure to SHS 
exists.5,6 Despite a quarter century of multipronged efforts to 
reduce active smoking, exposure to SHS continues to cause 
>41 000 deaths among nonsmoking adults and 400 deaths in 
infants each year, and ≈$5.6 billion annually in terms of lost 
productivity.7
The aims of the current study were (1) to describe trends 
in the prevalence of household exposure to SHS among never 
smokers over the past two and half decades, (2) to examine the 
association between household exposure to SHS and stroke, 
and (3) to explore the dose effect of household exposure to 
SHS on all-cause mortality after stroke.
Methods
Study Population
Data were obtained from the US National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Surveys (NHANES), which are a series of cross-sectional, 
national, stratified, multistage probability surveys constituting represen-
tative samples of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. Each 
survey participant completed a household interview and underwent a 
physical examination. Detailed descriptions of the plan and operation of 
each survey have been published.8 The study received approval from the 
National Center for Health Statistics Research Ethics Review Board, and 
participants were asked to sign an informed consent form. Our sample 
included adult (≥18 years) never smokers from survey participation in 
1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2012 to mortality assessment in 2010.
Definition of SHS
Household exposure to SHS was measured in 2 ways: self-report 
and serum cotinine levels. NHANES provides data on exposure to 
Background and Purpose—Approximately half of never smokers are exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS). Smoking is a 
well-established stroke risk factor, yet associations between SHS, stroke, and poststroke mortality remain uncertain. We 
aimed to determine the prevalence of exposure to SHS among those with and without stroke and its impact on mortality.
Methods—Data were obtained from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for 27 836 never smokers 
with/without self-reported stroke aged ≥18 years, sampled from 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2012, with linked mortality 
through 2010. Household exposure to SHS was determined by self-report; exposure severity was quantified by serum 
cotinine level. Independent relationships between SHS and all-cause mortality were assessed using Cox regression 
models, before and after adjusting for sociodemographics and comorbidities.
Results—From 1988 to 1994 to 1999 to 2012, age-adjusted prevalence of exposure to SHS declined from 11.5% to 6.6% 
among survivors of stroke (P=0.08), and 14.6% to 5.9% among persons without stroke (P<0.01). Factors associated with 
high exposure to SHS were male sex, black race, ≤12th-grade education, poverty income ratio ≤200%, high alcohol 
intake, and history of myocardial infarction (all P<0.05). High exposure to SHS was associated with higher odds of 
previous stroke (odds ratio, 1.46; P=0.026). There was a dose-dependent relationship between exposure to SHS and all-
cause mortality after stroke.
Conclusions—Individuals with previous stroke have 50% greater odds to have been exposed to SHS; SHS is associated with 
a 2-fold increase in mortality after stroke. This study highlights the importance of obtaining exposure to SHS history and 
counseling patients and their families on the potential impact of SHS on poststroke outcomes.

SHS at home in family smoking questionnaires. The specific question 
that provided data on exposure to SHS at home was: “Does anyone 
who lives here smoke cigarettes, cigars, or pipes anywhere inside this 
home?” If the answer to this question was yes, the respondent was 
considered to be exposed to SHS at home.
Exposure to SHS severity was quantified by serum cotinine level, 
a metabolite of nicotine that has been validated in previous human 
studies with a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 87% to differenti-
ate active smokers from nonsmokers not exposed to SHS and those 
exposed to SHS (area under the curve 0.902).9–11 Cotinine levels 
were categorize by undetectable (<0.05 ng/mL), median, and across 
quartiles.
Outcome Measures: SHS Prevalence, 
Stroke, and Mortality
Prevalence of exposure to SHS and the geometric mean of serum coti-
nine levels were computed and compared across time (1988–1994 
and 1999–2012) in people with and without stroke. History of stroke 
was obtained by self-report (“Has a doctor or other health profes-
sional ever told you that you had a stroke”). Mortality was reported 
as 10-year cumulative mortality and as mortality rates per 1000 
person-years.
Demographic and comorbid covariates included age, sex, race/
ethnicity, poverty income ratio (PIR; which represents the ratio of 
family income to their appropriate poverty threshold. Ratios <100% 
indicate that the income for the respective family below the official 
definition of poverty. PIR >200% is a commonly used threshold in 
NHANES studies, indicates that income was 200% above the appro-
priate poverty threshold), education level (≤12th grade versus >12th 
grade), hypertension (blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg, on antihyper-
tensive medications, or self-report), diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin 
A1C ≥6.5%, on diabetes mellitus medications, or self-report), hyper-
cholesterolemia (total serum cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL or on choles-
terol-lowering medications), history of myocardial infarction (MI, 
by self-report), chronic kidney disease (CKD, urine albumin to urine 
creatinine ratio >30 mg/g), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(forced expiratory volume 1/forced vital capacity ratio <0.7, or self-
report), and alcohol intake in the past 12 months. Time was catego-
rized as early (1988–1994) and late (1999–2012).
Statistical Analysis
We estimated the survey-weighted prevalence of the baseline sociode-
mographic and comorbidities by self-reported history of stroke. We 
compared the crude and age-adjusted prevalence of self-reported 
household exposure to SHS for a given time interval according to 
the level of each baseline covariate in people with and without stroke 
using logistic regression analyses taking into account the NHANES 
survey design. Crude and age-adjusted geometric means of serum 
cotinine levels were compared by level of each covariate over time 
in people with and without stroke using linear regression analyses 
taking into account the NHANES survey design. Mean serum coti-
nine–level comparisons were determined on the log scale to reduce 
skewness and remove the impact of outliers. Age adjustment was per-
formed using the direct method based on 2 age groups (<65 years and 
≥65 years) to the overall age distribution in the early time interval 
under the regression models.
To evaluate the relationship between exposure to SHS and the odds 
of previous stroke, multivariable logistic regression analyses before 
and after adjusting for covariates were performed. Model 1 adjusted 
for sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, PIR, and edu-
cation level). Model 2 adjusted for sociodemographic factors (as 
above) and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterol-
emia, MI, CKD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and alcohol 
intake).
For mortality, we computed the crude and the age-adjusted mor-
tality rates per 1000 person-years by each cotinine category using 
the Poisson regression model adjusting for the survey design after 
stratifying by previous stroke. In addition, we computed the hazard 
ratios and the corresponding 10-year adjusted mortality risks by each 
cotinine category using the Cox regression model taking into account 
the survey design after stratifying by previous stroke (adjusted mod-
els 1 and 2).
To examine the association between exposure to SHS and all-cause 
mortality, univariable and multivariable analyses were performed 
using Cox regression models after adjusting for the survey design 
variables. Age-adjusted hazard ratios of all-cause mortality compar-
ing highest quartile of serum cotinine versus undetectable serum 
cotinine were computed in people with previous stroke versus those 
without previous stroke. Data were analyzed using STATA software 
version 11.2 (StataCorp, Inc, College Station, TX) and R (version 
3.0.2).
Results
Study Population
A total of 27 836 never smokers aged ≥18 years were included 
in the study. Survivors of stroke were more likely to be 
women, age ≥65 years, have ≤12th-grade education, have PIR 
≤200%, and have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercho-
lesterolemia, MI, and CKD (Table 1).
Prevalence of Exposure to SHS
From 1988 to 1994 to 1999 to 2012, age-adjusted prevalence 
of household exposure to SHS declined from 11.5% (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 5.6%–17.4%) to 6.6% (95% CI, 
4.4%–8.8%) among survivors of stroke (P=0.08) and from 
14.6% (95% CI, 13.0%–16.2%) to 5.9% (95% CI, 5.3%–6.5%) 
among people without stroke (P<0.01; Table 2). Although 
SHS prevalence among all subgroups without previous stroke 
declined over time, SHS prevalence among survivors of stroke 
who were aged <45 years, ≥80 years, men, were associated 
with PIR >200% and with CKD, or had reported high alcohol 
intake increased without achieving statistical significance.
The geometric mean of serum cotinine levels decreased 
over time from 0.26 to 0.06 ng/mL (P<0.01) among survi-
vors of stroke and from 0.24 to 0.05 ng/mL (P<0.01) among 
people without previous stroke. Similar trends were observed 
after adjusting for age. There was a temporal shift toward 
more individuals having undetectable serum cotinine levels, 
from 21.84% in 1988 to 1994 to 64.78% in 1999 to 2012 
(inversely, prevalence of exposure to SHS declined from 
78.16% to 35.22% over time; Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Characteristics associated with high exposure to SHS 
(higher mean serum cotinine level) were younger age, male 
sex, black race, ≤12th-grade education, PIR ≤200%, high 
alcohol intake (>12 drinks per year), and history of MI (all 
P<0.05 in 1999–2012 survey; Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Association Between SHS and Stroke History
Stroke prevalence was higher among participants with self-
reported household SHS (2.69±0.48%) compared with those 
without exposure to SHS (2.24±0.14%) in 1999 to 2012. High 
exposure to SHS (cotinine level above median) was associated 
with higher odds of stroke (odds ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.05–2.3; P=0.026) in the NHANES 1999 to 
2012 cohort (Table 3). This relationship was not observed in 
the 1988 to 1994 cohort.

 2832  Stroke  November 2016
Dose-Dependent Relationship Between Exposure 
to SHS and Mortality Among Survivors of Stroke
Survivors of stroke with self-reported exposure to SHS 
had higher all-cause mortality compared with survivors of 
stroke without exposure to SHS (age-adjusted mortality rate: 
96.4±20.8 versus 56.7±4.8 per 1000 person-years; P=0.026; 
Table 4). Survivors of stroke were at higher odds of dying 
from exposure to SHS (adjusted hazard ratio=1.72; 95% CI, 
1.02–2.91; P=0.041). This correlation was not observed in 
participants in the 1988 to 1994 survey or among participants 
without a history of stroke.
There was a dose-dependent relationship between the quan-
tity of exposure to SHS and all-cause mortality after stroke. 
Age-standardized mortality rates per 1000 person-years were 
48.4±4.9, 47.8±11.5, 75.9±23.6, 103.1±31.1 across increas-
ing cotinine quartiles (trend P=0.01; Figure [A]). Similarly, 
adjusted 10-year cumulative mortality rates were 39.0±5.9%, 
40.7±9.8%, 58.3±14.2%, 65.4±13.3% across increasing coti-
nine quartiles (trend P=0.019; Table 4). Adjusted mortality 
rate ratios were 1.04, 1.74, and 2.11 across increasing cotinine 
quartiles (trend P=0.019). This relationship was not observed 
in people without stroke (Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
There was a differential effect of SHS on mortality by his-
tory of stroke (Figure [B]). Among individuals with previ-
ous stroke, people with serum cotinine levels in the highest 
quartile had 2.3 times greater mortality rates compared with 
those with undetectable cotinine levels (hazard ratio=2.34; 
95% CI, 1.36–4.01; P<0.01). Among individuals without 
 
a history of stroke, the corresponding age-standardized 
 
hazard ratio was 1.28 (95% CI, 0.98–1.67; P=0.07). Mortality 
rates associated with SHS were nearly 2 times greater for 
people with stroke compared with those without stroke, 
after adjusting for age (rate ratio=1.82; 95% CI, 0.95–3.50; 
P=0.07).
Discussion
Over the past two and a half decades, the prevalence of house-
hold exposure to SHS among never smokers decreased con-
siderably from 12% to 7% in participants with previous stroke 
and from 15% to 6% in participants without previous stroke. 
Household exposure to SHS remained higher among younger 
individuals, men, non-Hispanic blacks, and those living in 
poverty. Individuals with previous stroke were more likely to 
be exposed to SHS than those without previous stroke. There 
was a dose-dependent relationship between exposure to SHS 
and all-cause mortality after stroke. This dose–response rela-
tionship was not observed in people without previous history 
of stroke.
Our finding of a temporal decline in SHS prevalence is 
consistent with other population-based studies,11–13 meta-anal-
yses,14,15 and a recent CDC Mortality and Morbidity Weekly 
Report.13 In an analysis of nonsmokers aged ≥3 years who 
participated in NHANES 1999 to 2012, Homa et al13 found

that exposure to SHS declined from 52.5% in 1999 to 2000 to 
25.3% in 2011 to 2012. The 2011 to 2012 prevalence noted in 
the study by Homa et al was similar to the prevalence observed 
in the REGARDS study (Reasons for Geographic and Racial 
Differences in Stroke) cohort (23%). Our design differed from 
that of Homa et al in that we included a longer time frame, 
only never smokers, adults ≥18 years, and reported outcomes 
based on self-reported household exposure to SHS and coti-
nine levels.
We identified factors associated with higher household SHS 
exposure: younger age, male sex, black race, lower education, 
poverty, high alcohol intake, and history of MI. Similarly, a 
US study demonstrated that during 2011 to 2012, SHS was 
highest among children aged 3 to 11 years (40.6%), non-His-
panic blacks (46.8%), people living below the poverty level 
(43.2%), and people living in rental housing (36.8%).13 Our 
study also provides insights into temporal trends in household 
SHS exposure. Although declines occurred in all age, sex, and 
racial/ethnic categories among participants without previous 
stroke, self-reported exposure to SHS increased among survi-
vors of stroke who were 18 to 44 years, ≥80 years, men, had 
a PIR >200%, had a history of CKD, and had reported high 
annual alcohol intake. These findings have not been reported 
previously.
Since the 1980s, smoking bans have been implemented in a 
variety of settings, likely contributing to the temporal decline

 2834  Stroke  November 2016
in SHS.14 Comprehensive smoke-free legislation has been 
associated with lower rates of hospital admissions (and deaths) 
for stroke (relative risk [RR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75–0.94), coro-
nary events (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82–0.88), and other heart 
disease (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44–0.85).15 Numerous stud-
ies have shown a dose-dependent relationship between SHS 
and stroke incidence.6,9,16,17 We further demonstrated a dose-
dependent relationship between household exposure to SHS 
and all-cause mortality after stroke, a relationship that was not 
observed in participants without stroke.
The lack of association between SHS and mortality among 
those without stroke is hypothesis-generating and may imply 
a differential physiological effect of exposure to SHS on 
individuals with different comorbid conditions. Perhaps, 
SHS can accelerate atherosclerosis in those with underlying 
vascular risk factors but does not have an effect on those 
without atherosclerosis. Indeed, SHS may act synergistically 
with other vascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus and 
hypertension. Howard et al16 quantified the progression of 
carotid artery atherosclerosis using 10 914 participants from 
the ARIC study (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) and 
found a greater impact of SHS smoking on atherosclerotic 
progression in participants with diabetes mellitus than those 
without diabetes mellitus (interaction P=0.004). Chronic 
smoke exposure can lead to endothelial dysfunction, 
impaired arterial wall elasticity leading to dysfunctional 
cerebral autoregulation as have been demonstrated in animal 
and human studies.18–21
The prevalence of stroke was greater in those who self-
reported exposure to SHS than those without this exposure 
in the later cohort (1999–2012) but not in the earlier cohort 
(1988–1994). A similar pattern was observed for those with 
cotinine levels above the median when compared with people 
with undetectable cotinine levels across time eras (Table 3). 
The difference in findings between time eras may be attribut-
able to improved sensitivity of instruments used in cotinine 
detection in 2001. The limit of detection for serum cotinine 
was 0.05 ng/mL and changed to 0.015 mg/mL because of 
improvements in the method. It is also plausible that the dif-
ference is because of chance as crude and adjusted odds ratios 
for self-reported SHS were nonsignificant in either crude or 
adjusted models. The observation that the odds ratios for those 
with cotinine levels below the median (but not undetectable) 
seem to have better outcomes than those with undetectable 
levels of cotinine may provide some support that these are 
chance findings.
This study has several strengths: we used a large nation-
wide sample of individuals in the United States, with both 
survey- and laboratory-based measurements for exposure to 
SHS and comorbid conditions. Use of serum cotinine lev-
els reduced recall bias intrinsic to self-reported SHS; nev-
ertheless, one cannot completely exclude miss-reporting or 
laboratory errors. This study has several limitations. First, 
because stroke was assessed by self-report, we lacked infor-
mation about stroke type, duration since stroke, stroke sever-
ity, and functional status, factors which may have had an 
effect on mortality. Second, NHANES only captures nonin-
stitutionalized individuals and those who can comprehend 
and respond to surveys, resulting in a possible bias toward 
a healthier population. Third, we lacked detail on the dura-
tion and location of exposure to SHS. Serum cotinine levels 
could be influenced by places outside of the household, such 
as in the workplace, restaurants, and transportation system. 
Although smoke-free laws may have contributed to decline in 
total serum cotinine as exposure to smoking in public places 
have declined, they may not necessarily have direct impact on 
reducing household SHS.
In summary, the prevalence of exposure to SHS among 
never smokers with and without history of stroke declined 
between 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2012. High exposure to 
SHS was associated with history of previous stroke. There 
was a dose-dependent relationship between exposure to SHS 
and all-cause mortality after stroke, but this relationship was 
not observed in people without stroke. Although prospective 
studies are needed to assess causality, this study highlighted 
the importance of obtaining exposure to SHS history and 
counseling patients and their families on the potential impact 
of SHS on poststroke outcomes.
