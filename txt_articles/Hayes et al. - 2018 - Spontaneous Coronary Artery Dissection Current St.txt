Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection: 
Current State of the Science
A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association

ABSTRACT: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) has emerged as 
an important cause of acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, and 
sudden death, particularly among young women and individuals with few 
conventional atherosclerotic risk factors. Patient-initiated research has spurred 
increased awareness of SCAD, and improved diagnostic capabilities and 
findings from large case series have led to changes in approaches to initial 
and long-term management and increasing evidence that SCAD not only 
is more common than previously believed but also must be evaluated and 
treated differently from atherosclerotic myocardial infarction. High rates of 
recurrent SCAD; its association with female sex, pregnancy, and physical and 
emotional stress triggers; and concurrent systemic arteriopathies, particularly 
fibromuscular dysplasia, highlight the differences in clinical characteristics of 
SCAD compared with atherosclerotic disease. Recent insights into the causes 
of, clinical course of, treatment options for, outcomes of, and associated 
conditions of SCAD and the many persistent knowledge gaps are presented.
S
pontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is defined as an epicardial cor-
onary artery dissection that is not associated with atherosclerosis or trauma 
and not iatrogenic. The predominant mechanism of myocardial injury occur-
ring as a result of SCAD is coronary artery obstruction caused by formation of 
an intramural hematoma (IMH) or intimal disruption rather than atherosclerotic 
plaque rupture or intraluminal thrombus. Since the first description of SCAD by 
Pretty1 in 1931 at autopsy, our understanding of it has evolved tremendously dur-
ing the past 8 decades, especially in the past 5 years. On the basis of isolated 
case reports and small series, SCAD was initially described as a rare and almost 
universally fatal cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), myocardial infarction 
(MI), and sudden cardiac death in peripartum women,2–4 but contemporary reports 
have refuted these misconceptions. Indeed, advances in our understanding of the 
epidemiology of SCAD, the availability of intravascular imaging techniques,5 the 
development of SCAD-specific angiographic classification,6 heightened awareness 
among providers, and parallel efforts by patients7 using social media to broadly 
disseminate information suggest that SCAD is far more common than previously 
thought, especially in young women. In addition, SCAD has unique risk factors 
and associated conditions and different diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic 
implications compared with atherosclerotic coronary disease.8–17
Despite these advances, dissemination of new knowledge has been slow, 
and SCAD continues to be misdiagnosed, underdiagnosed, and managed as 
atherosclerotic ACS, which may harm patients with SCAD. An emphasis on 
accurate diagnosis is key to not only providing early supportive care but also

ensuring that an invasive strategy of percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) be reserved for a select 
group of these patients because PCI for SCAD has 
been associated with lower technical success and 
higher complications than PCI for atherosclerotic dis-
ease.13,18–20 Increasing awareness of SCAD may over-
come the limits of existing literature, which often ex-
cludes sex-specific information, a gap that may have 
clouded the understanding of this underrecognized 
 
condition.16,18,20–28
The authors of this statement hope to spur a change 
in the paradigm of care for women and men with 
SCAD. This American Heart Association scientific state-
ment provides an overview of current evidence and 
expert consensus with the aims of improving the un-
derstanding and management of SCAD in the medical 
community and of enhancing future collaborations and 
efforts to elucidate this still relatively poorly understood 
disease.
EPIDEMIOLOGY
The true prevalence of SCAD remains uncertain, pri-
marily because it is an underdiagnosed condition. 
Missed diagnoses are driven by a low suspicion of ACS 
in young women even in the presence of classic pre-
senting symptoms, limitations of current coronary an-
giographic techniques, and lack of clinician familiarity 
with the condition. SCAD most commonly occurs in 
patients with few or no traditional cardiovascular risk 
factors.8–10,13,16,29 Recent series using careful diagnostic 
criteria that exclude iatrogenic, traumatic, and athero-
sclerotic dissection6 suggest that SCAD may be a cause 
of up to 1% to 4% of ACS cases overall8,30–32 (Table 1), 
occurs overwhelmingly in women,8,11,13,30,31,33 may be 
the cause of ACS in up to 35% of MIs in women ≤50 
years of age,11,16,32 and is the most common cause of 
pregnancy-associated MI (43%)17 (Table 2). Pregnancy-
associated SCAD appears to make up a smaller pro-

portion of overall SCAD than early case series sug-
gest,13,19,29,33,35 likely as a result of better detection of 
less severe SCAD among women who were not recent-
ly pregnant.
The average age of women with SCAD ranges from 
45 to 53 years, but examples of patients presenting 
with SCAD in their second17 through eighth decades of 
life have been reported.6,8,11,13,30,31,33,36 One study report-
ed that men presented with SCAD at a slightly younger 
age than women (mean age, 48.6 [SD, 9.8] years versus 
52.3 [SD, 9.2] years; P=0.05).37,38 Although SCAD has 
been reported in all major racial and ethnic groups, the 
majority of patients are white, a finding that may reflect 
referral and sampling bias and the demography of pa-
tients cared for at reporting centers.8,13,15
The coronary distribution of SCAD has been well 
described. Although any artery can be affected, the 
left anterior descending artery is the most commonly 
affected (32%–46% of cases).8,10,13,16,19,33 In terms of 
territories, the left anterior descending and diagonal 
and septal branches are affected in 45% to 61% 
of cases; the circumflex and ramus and obtuse mar-
ginal branches in 15% to 45%; the right coronary 
artery and acute marginal, posterior descending, 
and posterolateral branches in 10% to 39%; and 
the left main artery in up to 4% of cases.10,11,13,16,19,33 
In the majority of cases, the mid to distal segments 
of coronary arteries are affected; in only <10% of 
cases are the proximal left anterior descending or 
circumflex, right coronary, or left main arteries af-
fected.13 Multivessel SCAD occurs in 9% to 23% of 
cases.8,10,11,13,16,19,33,35
HISTOPATHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 
AND FINDINGS
SCAD is characterized by the spontaneous formation of 
IMH within the wall of a coronary artery (Figure 1). This 
has been confirmed by both intracoronary imaging39–42 
and histopathological case reports and series.43–55 More 
recent publications confirm historical reports3,56,57 that 
describe the separation occurring in the outer third of 
the tunica media and IMH occupying the dissection and 
compressing the true lumen, leading to coronary insuf-
ficiency and MI47,50 (Figure 2).
Two theories of how SCAD develops have been de-
scribed.58 The first theory proposes that the primary 
pathological event is the development of a disruption 
in the vessel wall (intimal tear), which allows blood 
from the true lumen to enter and generate a false 
lumen. The second theory proposes that the primary 
event is a spontaneous hemorrhage arising from the 
vasa vasorum within the vessel wall.59 One group re-
porting an optical coherence tomography series from 
patients with SCAD noted that an intimal rupture site 
could not always be identified by this type of imaging, 
a finding supporting the second pathophysiological 
theory in at least a proportion of cases.42,60 For cases 
in which an intimal tear is identified, it remains un-
clear whether it is the initiating event or whether it is 
attributable to increasing pressure in the false lumen 
causing reverse intimal rupture into the true lumen 
or to the effect of coronary instrumentation during 
imaging.
There are several histopathological reports of a peri-
adventitial mixed inflammatory infiltrate, often with a 
predominance of eosinophils.44–46,49,50,52,54,55,61 However, 
there is controversy about the pathophysiological sig-
nificance of this eosinophilic infiltrate. Some authors 
consider it pathognomonic for SCAD,3,54,62 and others

attribute it to a nonspecific response to vascular injury.50 
The presence of an inflammatory cellular infiltrate sur-
rounding the dissection may be useful in distinguishing 
SCAD from iatrogenic postmortem dissection, which 
can confound the diagnosis of true SCAD.50 Cystic me-
dial necrosis was reported in a few older series,63–65 but 
it has either been reported to be absent44,49,53 or not 
commented on in reports since 2005. Fibromuscular 
dysplasia (FMD) involving coronary arteries in which 
SCAD occurred has been described in several histopath-
ological case reports,53,66–68 an implication that coronary 
FMD was the cause of SCAD and in keeping with the 
recently observed strong association between SCAD 
and FMD.29,69
In addition, the postmortem diagnosis of SCAD 
may be challenging, and a strong suspicion coupled 
with careful coronary histopathological examina-
tion is required in cases of unexplained sudden car-
diac death.47,50 When SCAD is suspected to be the 
cause, especially in young women, histopathological 
assessment of the coronary arteries should include 
distal segments of the epicardial arteries because of 
the predilection of SCAD for middistal coronary ar-
teries.15

PATHOGENESIS OF SCAD AND  
SCAD-ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS
Because of the unique demographic and risk factor pro-
file and the low prevalence of traditional cardiovascular 
risk factors of SCAD,6,8–10,13,16,29 its cause is hypothesized 
to be multifactorial with contributions from underlying 
arteriopathies, genetic factors, hormonal influences, 
inherited or acquired arteriopathies, or systemic inflam-
matory diseases, often compounded by environmental 
precipitants or stressors (Table 2).
FMD and Other Systemic Arteriopathies
Of the described arteriopathies, the association of 
SCAD with multifocal FMD in extracoronary arteries 
has been the most commonly reported. FMD is a non-
atherosclerotic, noninflammatory vascular disease that 
can affect nearly any arterial bed and can manifest as 
arterial stenosis, aneurysm, tortuosity, or dissection.70–72 
Multifocal FMD is the most common type of FMD and 
is defined angiographically as areas of alternating ste-
nosis and dilatation resulting in a string-of-beads pat-
tern (Figure 3). Focal FMD appears angiographically as a 
single concentric or tubular narrowing; <10% of cases 
of FMD are of this type. FMD is not currently considered 
a connective tissue disorder, which for the purposes of 
this document refers to conditions in which arterial fra-
gility is genetically mediated.
First described in 2005 and subsequently confirmed 
in several case series, the association of SCAD and FMD 
continues to be an area of considerable interest.69,73 
Subsequent cohort studies have shown a varying prev-
alence of concomitant FMD in extracoronary vascular 
beds, ranging from 17% to 86%, depending on the 
patient population, number of imaged vascular beds, 
and type of imaging used for screening.6,8,13,29,33,34,74,75 
There is also evidence that the prevalence of SCAD 
is not insignificant in patients with FMD. In the most 
recent report on dissection and aneurysm in patients 
with FMD in the US Registry for FMD, of the 237 of 
921 patients (25.7%) who experienced ≥1 arterial dis-
sections, 25 patients had SCAD, representing 10.5% 
of all dissections and an overall prevalence of coronary 
dissection of 2.7%.76 Case reports of typical histologi-
cal and angiographic features of FMD in coronary ar-
teries, including from patients with a prior SCAD ev
ent,53,58,66–68,77–81 have led some investigators to hy-
pothesize that SCAD may be a manifestation of coro-
nary FMD in at least a proportion of SCAD events.82 
Although FMD is the most common extracoronary 
vascular abnormality identified among patients with 
SCAD, patients without imaging signs of FMD have 
been reported to have other arterial abnormalities, in-
cluding dissections, aneurysms (including intracranial 
aneurysms in 14%–23%), or extracoronary and coro-
nary arterial tortuosity (78%).6,8,13,29,33,74–76,83 Some of 
these patients may indeed have had FMD but it was 
not identified because of incomplete or insufficiently 
sensitive imaging.
Pregnancy and Female Sex Hormones
The term peripartum SCAD does not have a universal def-
inition, and consistent with recent designations, we have 
elected to use the term pregnancy-associated SCAD.84 
Although pregnancy-associated SCAD encompasses a 
relatively small proportion of SCAD cases,13,19,30,33,84–86 it 
is the most common cause of MI among patients who 
are pregnant or postpartum.17 A recent analysis of a 
US administrative database found a prevalence of 1.81 
SCAD events per 100 
000 pregnancies during pregnancy 
or in the 6-week postpartum period.87 The majority of 
pregnancy-associated SCAD events occur in the third tri-
mester or early postpartum period, although SCAD has 
been reported as early as 5 weeks of gestation and up to 
several months to a year or more postpartum, particularly 
in women who are still lactating.35,85,86,88–90 The left main 
or left anterior descending artery has been described as 
the most commonly affected.17,35,85,86,89,91,92
The cause of pregnancy-associated SCAD is not fully 
understood. However, the hormonal changes of pregnan-
cy may lead to alterations in the architecture of the arterial 
wall.17,84,91,93,94 One hypothesis suggests that the estrogen 
and progesterone receptors present in the coronary arter-
ies may mediate changes, as they do in other connective 
tissues, that weaken the vessel wall, which culminates 
in arterial wall rupture, IMH, and onset of clinical symp-
toms.17 Accumulation of these changes over several preg-
nancies may explain the reported heightened risk of SCAD 
in multiparous women in some12,35,86,88 but not all87 series. 
Demographic and comorbid conditions reported with 
pregnancy-associated SCAD include black race, chronic 
hypertension, lipid abnormalities, chronic depression, mi-
graines,86,87 advanced maternal age and age at first child-
birth, and treatment for infertility. Gestational hypertension 
and preeclampsia have variably been associated.86,87 The 
average age at the time of pregnancy-associated SCAD 
has ranged from 33 to 36 years, a finding highlighting 
the potential impact of older age at time of pregnancy 
on cardiovascular complications such as SCAD.85,86,88,89,95 
Because maternal age and multiparity are associated, the 
independent contribution of these factors to SCAD risk is 
uncertain.
Women with pregnancy-associated SCAD seem to 
have a poorer prognosis than women with SCAD unre-
lated to pregnancy.85,86,88,89 In a series of 23 women with 
SCAD, 7 of whom had pregnancy-associated SCAD, 
postpartum patients had larger infarcts, more proximal 
artery dissections (86% versus 19%; P<.004), and lower 
mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (34% versus 
49%; P<0.01).85 In the Mayo Clinic SCAD Registry, 54

women with pregnancy-associated SCAD were com-
pared with 269 women with non–pregnancy-associated 
SCAD. Patients with pregnancy-associated SCAD were 
younger, were more likely to present with ST-segment–
elevation MI (50% versus 36%; P=0.013) and left main 
and multivessel dissections, had poorer LV function im-
mediately and at follow-up, and were less likely to have 
concurrent FMD.86 In a recent literature review of 120 
pregnancy-associated SCAD cases by Havakuk et al,96 
73% of women were postpartum and 76% presented 
with ST-segment–elevation MI. Maternal complications 
were common: cardiogenic shock in 24%, ventricular 
fibrillation requiring defibrillation in 16%, mechanical 
support in 28%, and an in-hospital mortality rate of 
4%. It is unclear why pregnancy-associated SCAD is as-
sociated with more aggressive and extensive dissections 
than non–pregnancy-associated SCAD and why the ma-
jority of pregnant women are spared from pregnancy-
associated SCAD.84
Inflammatory Conditions
SCAD is not commonly associated with systemic inflam-
matory disorders. Laboratory evaluation for inflamma-
tory or autoimmune conditions is generally low yield but 
may be considered in the post-MI setting, particularly in 
patients who have symptoms of or physical examination 
findings of autoimmune or rheumatologic disease. SCAD 
has been described in case reports of patients with vari-
ous systemic inflammatory diseases, including systemic 
lupus erythematosus,97–102 inflammatory bowel disease,103 
polyarteritis nodosa,104 sarcoidosis,52 celiac disease,105 and 
cryoglobulinemia in the setting of hepatitis C.106 In these 
series, underlying coronary vasculitis100 or systemic inflam-
mation100 may have contributed to the risk of SCAD, and 
larger cohort studies have shown that at least a small pro-
portion of patients have either underlying inflammatory 
diseases or short-term increases in inflammatory mark-
ers.13,60 Taken together, these series indicate that underly-
ing inflammatory conditions may be predisposing factors 
in the development of SCAD in a small proportion of pa-
tients. However, this possibility is based primarily on case 
reports or series of a small number of patients with inflam-
matory diseases that do not control for the prevalence of 
these conditions in the population reported and may rep-
resent coincidental association, especially because there is 
no published pathological proof of causation.

SCAD (≈≤5%).8,13,107 Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 
(caused by mutations in COL3A1107–109), Marfan syn-

etz syndrome (caused by mutation in genes encoding 
members of transforming growth factor-β signaling 
cascade such as TGFBRI, TGFBR2,111 and SMAD3112), 
and other mutations have been implicated and are 
known to be associated with arterial fragility and dis-
section, resulting in SCAD. Spontaneous arterial dis-
section without preceding aneurysm formation, as oc-
curs in SCAD, is characteristic of vascular Ehlers-Danlos 
syndrome. SCAD has also been described in polycystic 
kidney disease.113–115
Outside the context of these known genetic condi-
tions, however, SCAD does not seem to be strongly fa-
milial. In the largest series to investigate family history 
(421 subjects), Goel et al116 documented a family histo-
ry of SCAD in a very low proportion of patients (1.2%). 
In that study, both dominant and recessive modes of in-
heritance were suggested, but most SCAD cases seem 
to be sporadic, and no genetic risk loci have yet been 
definitively associated with SCAD. This lack of a consis-
tent inherited genetic pathway appears similar to FMD, 
for which, although heritability has been document-
ed,70,117–120 genetic testing has been largely unfruitful 
because of the absence of an identified monogenetic 
cause.121,122
Barriers to gene discovery in SCAD are related 
mostly to the rarity of the condition and its predomi-
nantly sporadic nature. Sample collection is underway 
at multiple centers, and collaborative efforts will like-
ly be needed to obtain sufficient statistical power to 
discover gene and gene-by-environment associations 
with SCAD.
Precipitants and Triggers
There appears to be a complex interplay between a vul-
nerable patient (ie, one with underlying arteriopathy) 
and potential triggers6,8,13,29,38,123–128 (Table 2) that initi-
ate a spontaneous arterial tear or IMH. However, this 
connection is not the case for all patients, highlight-
ing the incomplete understanding of the pathophysiol-
ogy of this disease process. Furthermore, although the 
frequency of patient-reported precipitants of SCAD is 
relatively high compared with that reported in a large 
multinational cohort of patients with ACS, there may 
be recall bias in the reporting of events around a life-
threatening event such as SCAD in typically young and 
previously healthy individuals. Thus, the potential for 
overreporting is important to consider.129
The most commonly reported precipitants are ex-
treme physical or emotional stress. Among 168 pa-
tients at a single center, an extreme emotional (40%) 
or physical (24%) stressor was reported before their 
SCAD event.13 Emotional stressors have more often 
been reported as precipitants of SCAD in women than 
in men,38 whereas physical stressors such as intense 
isometric exercise and weight lifting have more often 
been reported among men with SCAD.8,38 Stress cat-
echolamine surge during these events has been pos-
tulated to lead to coronary artery shear stress that, at 
least in part, contributes to the pathophysiology of 
SCAD. Although this hypothesis has not been specifi-
cally tested in patients with SCAD, a similar mechanism 
was proposed in other stress-induced cardiovascular 
conditions such as stress-induced cardiomyopathy (ta-
kotsubo syndrome).129,130
Unlike hormonal triggers related to pregnancy, other 
potential hormone-mediated SCAD triggers such as 
the perimenopausal state, use of oral contraceptives, 
postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT), infertility treat-
ments, and high-dose corticosteroid administration 
have less supportive data, although associations have 
been reported.6,29,125–127,131 The biggest challenge for 
confirming any of these correlations is that the baseline 
prevalence of these conditions is either common in the 
general population or unknown.
CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Although there are wide ranges of clinical presentations 
and severities of SCAD, patients who survive and pres-
ent for initial evaluation almost universally experience 
ACS and increased levels of cardiac enzymes. As many as 
2% to 5% of patients present in cardiogenic shock.10,11 
Among available series of patients presenting for evalu-
ation, 26% to 87% of patients with SCAD present with 
ST-segment–elevation MI, and 13% to 69% present 
with non–ST-segment–elevation MI.10,11,13,16,19,33 Present-
ing symptoms are consistent with atherosclerotic ACS, 
with chest pain being the most prevalent132 (Figure 4). 
Ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death account 
for SCAD presentation in 3% to 11% of reported se-
ries.8,10,11,13,19 These reports must be interpreted with care 
because individuals whose SCAD is not identified or is 
misdiagnosed, who do not survive to initial evaluation, or 
in whom coronary imaging or postmortem evaluation is 
not performed are not included in these studies.
Cardiac enzyme levels are almost invariably increased, 
 
although the initial troponin level in patients with SCAD 
presenting to the emergency department may be nor-
mal.19,133 In a cohort of 168 patients with SCAD from 
Vancouver, all patients had an increased troponin I level; 
the median increase was 6 μg/L (normal, <0.05 μg/L), 
and the interquartile range was broad (0.7–200 μg/L).13 
In a Japanese cohort of 63 patients with SCAD, the 
mean peak creatine kinase level (normal, 25–250 IU/L) 
was lower in young women with SCAD than in patients 
without SCAD (1689 versus 2874 IU/L; P=0.025).11 LV

DIAGNOSIS
Patients with SCAD are at risk of receiving alternative 
diagnoses and of being discharged after emergency de-
partment evaluation because their relatively young age 
and absence of atherosclerotic risk factors frequently 
do not fit the expected phenotype of an atherosclerotic 
patient with MI. Accurate diagnosis of SCAD in the 
early stages of ACS presentation is important because 
management and investigation are different from those 
for atherosclerotic forms of coronary artery disease.12,19 
The suspicion for SCAD is typically instigated by clini-
cal presenting features such as patient demograph-
ics, especially young age, female sex, and few or no 
conventional cardiovascular risk factors. Once SCAD is 
suspected, coronary angiography should be performed 
as early as feasible, especially in the setting of ST-seg-
ment–elevation MI. Despite the inherent limitations of 
conventional coronary angiography that reduce the 
diagnostic capability for SCAD, this technique remains 
the first-line diagnostic imaging method because it is 
widely available and recommended for early invasive 
management of ACS.135 The key limiting factor is that 
angiography is 2-dimensional “lumenography” and 
does not specifically image the arterial wall.
Dedicated intracoronary imaging methods, including 
intravascular ultrasonography and optical coherence to-
mography, provide detailed visualization of the arterial 
wall that aids the diagnosis of SCAD. However, these 
tools have additional risks and costs, and they are not 
readily available in all catheterization laboratories. Thus, 
availability, competence, and expertise can vary widely 
with these technologies. As a consequence, conven-
tional coronary angiography remains instrumental in di-
agnosing SCAD, and cardiologists should become pro-
ficient at recognizing its various angiographic patterns.
Coronary Angiography
The traditional angiographic description of SCAD em-
phasized the presence of multiple radiolucent lumens 
and extraluminal contrast staining, which may have in-
cluded spiral dissection or intraluminal filling defects.136 
However, contemporary angiographic SCAD series have 
since shown that this “pathognomonic” appearance is 
present in only a small proportion of SCAD cases.6,41 
Addressing the drawbacks of prior descriptions, a spe-
cific SCAD angiographic classification was proposed 
and now has been commonly adopted.6
In the Saw angiographic SCAD classification, type 1 
refers to the classic appearance of multiple radiolucent 
lumens or arterial wall contrast staining (Figure 5A). 
Type 2 refers to the presence of diffuse stenosis that 
can be of varying severity and length (usually >20 mm; 
Figure 5B): Variant 2A is diffuse arterial narrowing bor-
dered by normal segments proximal and distal to the 
IMH, and variant 2B is diffuse narrowing that extends 
to the distal tip of the artery.58 Type 3 is focal or tubular 
stenosis, usually <20 mm in length, that mimics athero-
sclerosis (Figure 5C); intracoronary imaging is required 
to confirm the presence of IMH and to diagnose SCAD 
(Figure 5D).
Several studies have reported that the diffuse 
smooth stenosis pattern (ie, type 2) is the most com-
mon angiographic manifestation of SCAD,11,13,16,41 oc-
curring in up to 67.5% of dissected arteries, followed 
by type 1 in 29.1% and type 3 in 3.4%.13 Thus, reli-
ance solely on the traditional multiple lumens or con-
trast staining of arterial walls to diagnose SCAD would 
result in missed diagnoses of >70% of SCAD cases. 
Therefore, familiarity with the diffuse narrowed-lumen 
appearance of IMH and use of intracoronary imaging 
are important steps to improve the diagnosis of SCAD. 
Care must be taken to ensure that SCAD is not misin-
terpreted as normal coronaries, atherosclerotic disease, 
coronary vasospasm, thromboembolism, or takotsubo 
syndrome.137,138

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
Although coronary angiography is the standard for 
the diagnosis of SCAD, this invasive procedure has in-
trinsic risk. Iatrogenic catheter-induced coronary artery 
dissection is reported to be increased in patients with 
SCAD; the reported overall prevalence is 3.4%,139,140 
whereas it is <0.2% for standard coronary angiogra-
phy.139,140 Underlying arterial fragility in patients with 
SCAD is believed to accentuate the risks for iatrogenic 
dissection.
Intracoronary Imaging
Intracoronary imaging has become instrumental to aid 
the diagnosis of SCAD in angiographically subtle or non-
diagnostic cases. Fortunately, the need to use intracoro-
nary imaging has diminished in recent years because of 
improved SCAD-pattern recognition on coronary angi-
ography. Intravascular ultrasonography has been avail-
able for >20 years, and it offers good spatial resolution 
of ≈150 μm to image the coronary arterial wall. It can 
detect intimal tear, false lumen, IMH, and intraluminal 
thrombi, although its resolution may not be adequate 
to clearly identify all such abnormalities related to 
SCAD.42,141 It has the advantage of deep penetration to 
assess the depth and extent of IMH. Optical coherence 
tomography is a more advanced technology that uses 
light waves to image the arterial wall. This technology 
has revolutionized the diagnosis of SCAD since its first 
reported use in 2008.5,13,34,40,41,69 It has a spatial resolu-
tion of 10 to 20 µm, and thus, it is superior to intravas-
cular ultrasonography for delineating the lumen-intimal 
interface and is better for visualizing intimal tears, false 
lumen, IMH, and intraluminal thrombi (Figure 6). This 
superior imaging improves the ease of detecting SCAD 
and is the preferred intracoronary imaging method 
when angiographic diagnosis is uncertain and when it is 
believed that intravascular imaging can be safely under-
taken.12 Nevertheless, both optical coherence tomog-
raphy and intravascular ultrasonography can provide 
complementary details for diagnosis of SCAD, which on 
intracoronary imaging requires the presence of IMH or 
double lumen.60 Because not all laboratories have both 
technologies accessible, angiographers should become 
familiar with interpreting features of SCAD with their 
available intracoronary imaging method.
Despite the importance of intracoronary imaging for 
the diagnosis of SCAD, these tools have potential risks, 
including extending the coronary dissection with wire 
or imaging catheter, guide-catheter iatrogenic dissec-
tion,139 catheter-induced occlusion of true lumen, and 
hydraulic extension with contrast injection for optical 
coherence tomography. With weighing of the risks and 
benefits, intracoronary imaging should be pursued only 
when coronary angiographic diagnosis is uncertain (eg, 
type 3 or unclear lesions) and when the vessel diameter 
is large enough for intracoronary imaging. In addition, 
there is generally no clinical indication to evaluate the 
full depth and extent of IMH or false lumen because

conservative management is typically preferred. There-
fore, intracoronary imaging can be limited to the proxi-
mal segment of dissection without the need to image 
the entire dissected segment. An algorithm for the an-
giographic diagnosis of SCAD is presented in Figure 7.
Coronary Computed Tomography 
Angiography
Cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) of 
the coronary arteries is emerging as an efficient tool 
for coronary assessment in low- and intermediate-risk 
patients presenting with ACS.142–146 Although the role 
of CCTA in patients with uncertain ACS diagnoses is 
promising, no dedicated study has addressed CCTA in 
the setting of acute SCAD. CCTA is generally contrain-
dicated in patients presenting with high-risk ACS and is 
not recommended as the first-line investigation for sus-
pected acute SCAD.143,147,148 Moreover, normal results on 
CCTA do not exclude SCAD. Coronary dissection seen 
on retrospective evaluation of initially negative CCTA 
images after SCAD was angiographically proved149 rein-
forces the need for CCTA or “triple rule-out” protocols 
that include CCTA to be interpreted with great caution 
when SCAD is in the differential diagnosis as a means 
to minimize false-negative results.147,148
Shortcomings of CCTA for SCAD include lower spatial 
and temporal resolution than coronary angiography,150 
inclusion of patients with a low pretest probability for 
atherosclerotic coronary artery disease that thereby pos-
sibly affects the interpreters’ judgment, and a SCAD 
coronary appearance on CCTA that differs from that 
of typical atherosclerosis.149,151 Coronary atherosclerosis 
on CCTA commonly appears as discrete calcifications or 
focal dense, noncalcified plaques, whereas SCAD ves-
sels may appear as having dual lumens on CCTA with 
contrast agent in the dissected plane. Most commonly, 
however, SCAD occurs without intimal disruption such 
that the contrast agent does not opacify the false lu-
men.58 Although in such cases the coronary artery nar-
rowing and IMH are sometimes visualized on CCTA, 
these unique features can be challenging to recognize

or are unidentifiable in small vessels.58,149,151 Poorly gated 
or nongated computed tomography angiography (such 
as computed tomography for pulmonary embolus) is in-
adequate for coronary artery assessment.53,149,152,153
CCTA may be useful for noninvasive follow-up of pa-
tients with SCAD, particularly in those with dissections 
in proximal or large-caliber coronary arteries.151,154,155 
A study of 24 patients with SCAD who had follow-
up CCTA found it to be a valuable, noninvasive study 
without complications and identified healing in most 
(83%).155 SCAD involvement of distal coronary arteries 
or side branches, or of vessel caliber <2.5 mm, general-
ly is not well visualized on CCTA; therefore, this method 
is of limited value in many SCAD cases.6,13
INITIAL MANAGEMENT
The American College of Cardiology/American Heart 
Association and the European Society of Cardiology 
guidelines for the management of ACS advocate an 
early invasive strategy with revascularization of cul-
prit lesions over conservative therapy alone.156,157 This 
stent-based lesion pacification reduces the risk of recur-
rent occlusion at the lesion site and associated adverse 
events in atherosclerotic MI, but there have been no 
randomized studies or subgroup analyses of treatment 
outcomes or comparisons between acute revasculariza-
tion strategies for ACS caused by SCAD. These studies 
are critical because the mechanism of vessel obstruc-
tion, the acute vessel response to balloon dilation, and 
the natural history of conservatively managed lesions 
differ significantly in SCAD compared with atheroscle-
rotic ACS.
Conservative Management
No comprehensive prospective studies have routinely 
performed angiographic restudy after SCAD, but ob-
servational data have indicated angiographic “healing” 
of SCAD lesions in the majority of patients (70%–97%) 
who were selectively restudied weeks to months after 
a conservatively managed index episode.6,8,16,19,33,41 A 
minority of patients had persistent dissection on an-
giography,8,13,19 and it is unclear why dissection per-
sisted in these cases or whether very late healing may 
have occurred subsequently. The time course of heal-
ing remains uncertain, but it can be detected within 
days8,13,158 and is frequently observed by 1 month.8,13 In 
an observational study of 131 SCAD lesions that had 
repeat coronary angiography, spontaneous healing oc-
curred in 88.5% of cases. For the cases in which repeat 
angiography was performed early (<35 days from index 
event), there were residual dissections. However, repeat 
angiography performed after 35 days showed angio-
graphic healing in all cases.139 These results suggest a 
time dependency for healing to occur.
Of note, early complications of recurrent MI may 
develop in 5% to 10% of conservatively managed pa-
tients, mostly related to extension of dissection within 
the first 7 days after an acute episode.8,10,13 The major-
ity of these patients require emergency revasculariza-
tion, and no angiographic or clinical predictors of acute 
worsening have been identified. Because of these find-
ings, inpatient monitoring for an extended period is 
typically recommended as part of a conservative strat-
egy for SCAD management.12,19,159
Conservative therapy may not be appropriate in high-
risk patients with ongoing ischemia, left main artery 
dissection, or hemodynamic instability. In such cases, it 
is the consensus of the working group that urgent in-
tervention with PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting 
(CABG) should be considered, but such decisions should 
be individualized and contemplated in the context of the 
coronary anatomy and the expertise of the operators or 
centers. A proposed algorithm to guide conservative 
versus invasive management is outlined in Figure 8.
Percutaneous Coronary Intervention
Observational studies have shown consistently that PCI 
for the treatment of SCAD is associated with an in-
creased risk of complications8–11,13,16,19,33 and suboptimal 
outcomes. Affected coronary arteries may be inherently 
weak architecturally as a result of underlying arteriopa-
thies, which can render them more susceptible to iat-
rogenic dissections and extension of dissections with 
PCI. Coronary guidewires may enter the false lumen 
and occlude the true lumen. Balloon dilation and stent 
placement can also confer risks of extending dissection 
of the intima or propagating IMH upstream and down-
stream from the vessel, causing worsening of vessel ob-
struction. Such extensions of dissection can be clinically 
significant, with some resulting in spiral dissections to 
the distal arterial segments or retrograde dissection into 
proximal arteries and adjacent branches, including the 
left main coronary artery. Given that dissection lengths 
are often extensive, complete PCI may require long cor-
onary stents, which can increase the risk of subsequent 
in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis. In addition, 
SCAD most frequently affects the distal coronary seg-
ments, which may be too small or too distal for stent 
implantation. Moreover, IMH naturally resorbs over 
time, which can result in subacute and late stent strut 
malapposition, potentially predisposing to future risk of 
stent thrombosis.158,159
These technical complications have been associated 
with adverse clinical outcomes in several series. The 
Mayo Clinic series of 189 patients showed PCI tech-
nical failure in 53% of the patients initially managed 
with PCI.19 Even when the percentage of residual ste-
nosis was ignored as a parameter, technical failure oc-
curred in 30%. Emergency CABG was required in 13%

of those treated with primary PCI; emergency repeat 
PCI was required in 4%; and there was 1 death. Simi-
lar rates of adverse technical and clinical outcomes oc-
curred whether there was impaired flow or normal or 
near-normal vessel flow at baseline.19 In the Vancouver 
cohort of 168 patients, technical failure occurred in 
36%, stent thrombosis in 6%, and emergency CABG as 
a complication of PCI in 12%.13 Similarly, in a European 
study of 134 patients, 27% of PCIs resulted in tech-
nical failure, and 9% of patients required emergency 
CABG.10
Optimizing PCI Approaches
Improving the outcomes of PCI in SCAD requires me-
ticulous angiographic and instrumentation techniques, 
including avoidance of deep catheter engagement, 
noncoaxial positioning of catheter tip, catheter damp-
ening, and strong contrast agent injection. In addition, 
in potential SCAD cases, preferential use of femoral ac-
cess or extra caution with radial catheterization should 
be considered in light of a retrospective series in which 
there was a 3-fold higher risk for catheter-induced iat-
rogenic dissection in patients with SCAD undergoing 
coronary angiography when radial access was used as 
opposed to femoral access.13,139
Multiple interventional strategies have been de-
scribed when PCI is pursued for SCAD lesions; how-
ever, no comparative studies have assessed the superi-
ority of such techniques. Examples of approaches that 
have had successful outcomes include the following: (1) 
implantation of long drug-eluting stents covering in ex-
cess of 5 to 10 mm on both proximal and distal edges 
of the IMH so as to accommodate propagation of the 
IMH when compressed by the stent; (2) direct stenting 
without balloon predilation to avoid additional risks of 
extension of the IMH; (3) balloon angioplasty alone to 
restore coronary flow without stenting; (4) cutting bal-
loon fenestration of the IMH to allow decompression 
of the false lumen blood pool into the true lumen160,161 
with or without additional stenting (acknowledging the 
theoretical risk of coronary rupture, cutting balloon in-
flation should be performed cautiously with an under-
sized balloon); (5) multistent approach by sealing distal 
and proximal ends first with stents, before stenting the 
middle, to minimize IMH propagation162; and (6) use 
of bioresorbable stents to provide a temporary scaffold 
because complete resorption of struts occurs within 2 
years.158,163 Finally, after successful PCI, dual-antiplatelet 
therapy should be administered according to the stents 
implanted.158,164,165
Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting
Published evidence on CABG after SCAD is limited to 
case reports, small case series, and retrospective obser-
vational studies with small sample size. CABG has been 
described as a treatment strategy for SCAD in patients 
with left main stem or proximal dissections, after tech-
nical failure of attempted PCI, when there is a complica-
tion of attempted PCI, and when ischemia is refractory 
despite attempted conservative therapy. Use of arterial 
and venous bypass conduits has been described, as 
have off-pump and robotic approaches.166–168 One study 
reported high rates of initial technical success and in-
hospital clinical outcomes with CABG as an index treat-
ment strategy (n=20 patients, 32 conduits).19 Although 
these findings provide some reassurance for CABG as 
a viable revascularization option for acute SCAD, cau-
tion should be used in the overinterpretation of the 
data given the almost certain selection bias for patients 
deemed to have suitable anatomy. During long-term 
follow-up, 1 study reported a high rate of both venous 
and arterial conduit failure (11 of 16 graft failures from 
11 of 20 patients undergoing follow-up angiography), 
almost certainly the result of subsequent healing of na-

tive SCAD vessels and competitive flow promoting graft 
occlusion. The study also showed that CABG was not 
protective against recurrent SCAD events.19 The use of 
vein grafts may be considered in light of frequent late 
graft failure and the opportunity to preserve arterial 
conduits for the future.
In summary, on the basis of the retrospective obser-
vational data cited above, conservative therapy is gen-
erally the preferred strategy in patients with SCAD who 
are clinically stable and without objective evidence of 
ongoing ischemia and has generally been associated 
with favorable outcomes.9,19 A conservative strategy is 
additionally appropriate in patients with occluded distal 
vessels or distal branches that would not routinely be 
amenable to PCI.
EARLY SCAD OUTCOMES: 
IMPLICATIONS FOR DURATION OF 
HOSPITALIZATION
Although rates of in-hospital mortality are low, up to 
14% of patients require urgent in-hospital revascular-
ization, usually because of extension of dissection. Rec-
ognized complications of SCAD depend on the initial 
treatment strategy (Table 3). Acknowledging the biases 
associated with selected retrospective series, among re-
ports including >100 patients,10,13,19 49.7% to 89.7% 
received medical therapy as initial treatment, and 2.6% 
to 8.5% of conservatively treated patients eventually 
required revascularization during the index hospitaliza-
tion. Revascularization with PCI was the initial treat-
ment for SCAD in 16.7% to 47.1% of patients. Report-
ed PCI success rates varied (36.4%–72.5%), most likely 
because of the wide variability in the definition of PCI 
success in SCAD, but all were substantially lower than 
success rates reported in control subjects with athero-
sclerotic ACS. Emergency CABG was required in 2.2% 
to 7.4% of patients who initially received medical ther-
apy or PCI. An initial CABG revascularization approach 
was used in 0.6% to 3.7%, and initial success (87.5%–
100%) was high in this small group of patients.
In current clinical practice, the duration of hospital-
ization after ACS is therefore largely dictated by the 
management strategy for the patient and the ongo-
ing symptoms.172 All patients with acute MI caused 
by SCAD are typically admitted for a minimum of 48 
hours to allow adjustment of medications and in-hos-
pital evaluation of physical activity tolerance before dis-
charge.12 A prolonged period of in-hospital monitoring 
(3–5 days) is justified as part of a conservative strat-
egy to observe for a small but important (5%–10%) 
early hazard of dissection extension or new recurrent 
SCAD.13,19 If clinical worsening occurs despite conser-
vative management (worsening of symptoms together 
with evidence of ischemia by electrocardiography or 
significant arrhythmia), repeat angiography should be 
performed and emergency revascularization undertak-
en to relieve ischemia if feasible. Chest pain does not 
necessarily imply active myocardial ischemia. Chest pain 
may be a manifestation of vessel wall dissection itself. 
Thus, chest pain alone should not be an indication to 
pursue emergency revascularization, especially if there 
is no evidence of ischemia or if the vessel flow is normal. 
Patients in whom PCI is unsuccessful or complicated by 
extension of dissection, ongoing ischemia, ventricular 
arrhythmias, or heart failure often require longer hos-
pitalizations, similar to conservatively treated patients.
OTHER SUPPORTIVE THERAPIES
Data on the use of therapies supportive of LV function 
or for persistent ischemia in SCAD are limited to single-
patient case reports, each with a favorable outcome. 
Intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation has been 
used mostly to support surgical revascularization or 
sometimes to bridge pregnant patients through surgi-
cal delivery before CABG.173–181 LV assist devices or ex-
tracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been used as 
a bridge to transplantation or to support recovery after 
CABG.175,177,180,182–186 In 1 case, extracorporeal mem-
brane oxygenation was used for cardiogenic shock af-
ter SCAD-associated cardiac arrest treated with PCI and 
was a successful bridge to myocardial recovery.180 The 
favorable outcomes in all reported cases likely represent 
a reporting bias given the high-risk scenarios described. 
The theoretical risks of percutaneous support devices 
in the setting of SCAD compared with atherosclerotic 
ACS include an increased propensity for iliac or femo-
ral arterial dissection with the placement of large-bore 
catheters in the presence of FMD or other arteriopa-
thies and hydraulic extension of intimal coronary dis-
section with increased diastolic coronary flow during 
intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation. Therapies 
supportive of LV function can be considered in cases 
of cardiogenic shock after SCAD as a bridge to recov-
ery or transplantation. No data are available to support 
unique strategies in SCAD that differ from current con-
sensus recommendations in this area.187
The role of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators or 
use of external defibrillator vests in patients with SCAD 
who present with sudden cardiac arrest temporally re-
lated to their ischemic event has not been studied. Pa-
tients with SCAD have been reported to receive early 
implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators or more ag-
gressive management despite the absence of high-risk 
features such as recurrent arrhythmia, LV dysfunction, 
or persistent ischemia.188 There are potential harms with 
this unproven aggressive practice, and currently, there is 
insufficient evidence to suggest altering clinical decision 
making for implantation of cardioverter-defibrillators 
on the basis of the cause of the ischemic event.172,189

MEDICAL THERAPY
The ultimate goals of short- and long-term medical 
therapy of SCAD are to alleviate symptoms, to improve 
short- and long-term outcomes, and to prevent recur-
rent SCAD. Unfortunately, there is a substantial gap in 
evidence to guide clinicians in this regard because of the 
relatively recent recognition of SCAD as an important 
clinical entity and the absence of identified cellular and 
molecular targets or randomized controlled trials to sup-
port an evidence-based approach. Given the paucity of 
evidence currently available, the following approaches 
are based largely on expert opinions derived from the 
clinical experience of members of the writing group.
Anticoagulation and Antiplatelet 
Therapy
Because the pathophysiology, mechanisms of ischemia, 
PCI outcomes, and residua of SCAD are distinct from 
those associated with atherosclerotic ACS, many inves-
tigators have questioned the rationale and potential 
risks of using standard ACS therapies in patients with 
SCAD. For instance, early heparin use may provide ben-
efit by reducing thrombus burden, but there are theo-
retical concerns about its use in the setting of acute 
SCAD presentation related to accentuating the risk of 
bleeding into the IMH or extension of dissection. There-
fore, if systemic anticoagulation is started at hospital 
presentation, in the absence of other indications for 
systemic anticoagulation, consideration of discontinua-
tion is appropriate once SCAD is diagnosed.190
Similarly, there are no data to guide the use of 
glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the emergency man-
agement of SCAD. Theoretical concerns about the 
extension of dissection, additional bleeding risk, and 
absence of evidence of benefit suggest a cautious ap-
proach to their use.190
Patients with SCAD who are undergoing coronary 
revascularization should receive the standard guideline-

AND GUIDELINES
based antiplatelet therapy after PCI.156 Clear evidence 
supporting the use of dual-antiplatelet therapy in pa-
tients with SCAD who do not undergo coronary inter-
vention is lacking. Although theoretical benefits of early 
dual-antiplatelet therapy in SCAD include protection 
from additional thrombosis in the prothrombotic envi-
ronment caused by intimal dissection, many practitioners 
avoid its use in light of an increased bleeding risk and no 
evidence of benefit. No study has compared short- or 
long-term outcomes or bleeding risks related to the use 
of dual-antiplatelet therapy and aspirin alone in SCAD.
In adherence with current guideline-directed use of 
antiplatelet therapy after ACS, some experts recom-
mend dual-antiplatelet therapy for at least 1 year af-
ter SCAD, regardless of initial management strategy, 
along with lifelong aspirin use.156 Others opt for no or 
limited use (1–3 months) followed by longer-term as-
pirin therapy. A retrospective Italian series examining 
in-hospital and long-term clinical outcomes among 
patients with SCAD found that dual-antiplatelet 
therapy with predominantly clopidogrel was adminis-
tered to 82% of conservatively managed patients and 
94% of patients who underwent PCI.10 This therapy 
was continued for a mean of 12.4 months (SD, 7.8 
months) in patients who had stenting and for 10.9 
months (SD, 2.9 months) in those treated conserva-
tively. Bleeding complications were not reported, but 
long-term outcomes in both groups were similar.10
Most experts recommend aspirin use for at least 1 
year and frequently indefinitely after SCAD in patients 
who receive medical treatment, in the absence of con-
traindications.10,31,190,191 In light of increased bleeding 
risks with antiplatelet agents, especially menorrhagia 
in premenopausal women, and uncertain benefits and 
risks, individual selection of suitability for dual-anti-
platelet therapy and aspirin therapy in conservatively 
managed survivors of SCAD is indicated.
β-Adrenergic Blockers
β-Blockers should be considered in patients with SCAD 
who have LV dysfunction or arrhythmias and for man-
agement of hypertension. Some experts advocate for 
their routine use for SCAD12 on the basis of extrapo-
lation from benefits in atherosclerotic MI135 or aortic 
dissection,192 whereas others recommend that they 
be used selectively out of concern for exacerbating 
vasospasm or symptomatic hypotension. In practice, 
β-blocker use is often limited by adverse effects, espe-
cially symptoms of fatigue and hypotension. However, 
in a recently reported 327-patient series from Vancou-
ver with a median duration of follow-up of 3.1 years, 
the use of β-blockers was associated with a hazard ratio 
of 0.36 for recurrent SCAD in multivariable analysis,193 a 
finding strengthening the practice of β-blocker admin-
istration after SCAD.
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 
Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor 
Blockers
After SCAD, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
or angiotensin receptor blockers should be used when 
MI is complicated by LV systolic dysfunction, according 
to national guidelines for the management of patients 
after MI.135 These drugs are also a treatment option for 
concomitant hypertension. Female patients of repro-
ductive age must be warned of the teratogenicity of 
renin-angiotensin system antagonists.
Statins
In a retrospective cohort of 87 patients, no relationship 
was found between post-SCAD medical management at 
discharge and SCAD recurrence, with the exception of 
statin use. Statin use was higher in patients who had a 
SCAD recurrence; however, this finding may have been 
affected by sample size, date of index event, and medi-
cation use that was started after discharge.8 In a more re-
cent 327-patient SCAD cohort, no association was found 
between statin use and recurrent SCAD.193 Statin therapy 
is therefore not recommended routinely after SCAD but 
is reserved for patients meeting guideline-based indica-
tions for primary prevention of atherosclerosis194 and for 
the management of patients with established concomi-
tant atherosclerotic disease or diabetes mellitus.194
Antianginal Therapy
The predominant role of antianginal therapies is for 
post-SCAD chest pain syndromes (see Evaluation and 
Management of Chest Pain Syndromes After SCAD). 
Inpatient management of chest pain may warrant an-
tianginal therapy, but currently, there is not a role for 
the routine use of antianginal therapy for either the 
index SCAD hospitalization or long term. Chest dis-
comfort is common in outpatients after SCAD, and for 
patients who are not candidates for revascularization 
or who have evidence suggesting coronary vasospasm 
or coronary microvascular dysfunction, relief of isch-
emia and symptoms may be achieved with nitrates, 
calcium channel blockers, or ranolazine. Their use, 
however, must be balanced with their adverse effect 
profile, most commonly symptomatic hypotension and 
headache (nitrates).
PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED SCAD: 
DIAGNOSIS AND SHORT-TERM 
MANAGEMENT
The majority of pregnancy-associated SCADs occur in 
the first 4 weeks after delivery, but SCAD has been 
reported during virtually all stages of pregnancy.86,96

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
Management of SCAD in the pregnant or peripartum 
patient requires a multidisciplinary team approach195,196 
from cardiology and obstetric services that incorporates 
management for the mother in combination with con-
siderations for fetal well-being. Recommendations for 
pregnancy follow-up and delivery after SCAD have been 
reviewed elsewhere and depend on both maternal and 
fetal status with the goals of limiting maternal hemody-
namic demand and close fetal monitoring.90 However, 
despite the special situation presented by pregnancy, 
the principles of SCAD management are largely the 
same as for non–pregnancy-associated SCAD, namely 
maintenance of a strong suspicion to ensure that the 
diagnosis is not missed, early and careful angiography 
to avoid iatrogenic dissection196,197 and to confirm the 
diagnosis (fetal radiation exposure is relatively low with 
current techniques90,198,199), and aiming for conservative 
management if there is no evidence of ongoing isch-
emia or infarction, hemodynamic instability, or particu-
larly high-risk anatomy.17,200
Special consideration must be given to post-SCAD 
pharmacotherapy recommendations for women who 
are pregnant or lactating. Given the unclear useful-
ness of clopidogrel therapy in SCAD, its use during 
pregnancy by women who do not undergo PCI should 
be individualized.201 There are no clear safety data for 
clopidogrel use during pregnancy or breastfeeding, 
and although there are case reports of it being used 
safely,202–204 it is generally not recommended in women 
who are breastfeeding.205,206 Low-dose aspirin use is 
safe during pregnancy and breastfeeding.195
Although β-blockers are associated with fetal 
growth restriction, they are routinely used during preg-
nancy for the treatment of hypertension. Labetalol is 
the preferred agent, especially in early pregnancy, be-
cause both metoprolol and atenolol are more highly 
associated with lower placental and fetal weights at 
delivery.195,207 Atenolol has also been associated with 
bradycardia in breastfed infants; therefore, it should 
also be avoided during breastfeeding.206,208
CARDIAC REHABILITATION, PHYSICAL 
ACTIVITY, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL 
CONSIDERATIONS AFTER SCAD
Cardiac Rehabilitation
All patients who have MI caused by SCAD should be 
referred for cardiac rehabilitation209 consistent with the 
secondary prevention, risk reduction, and psychosocial 
support strategy recommendations.27,156,210,211 The pro-
gram should be tailored and individualized, taking into 
account not only cardiopulmonary factors such as ejec-
tion fraction but also patient age, pre-SCAD physical 
activity level, and patient-centered recovery goals.211,212 
Current evidence in the SCAD population suggests low 
rates of both referral to and participation in cardiac re-
habilitation209,213,214 despite clear evidence of both safe-
ty and benefit, including improved measures of physi-
cal and psychosocial well-being, improved metabolic 
parameters, and lower symptom frequency.213–221 These 
low rates are compounded by the lower overall refer-
ral of women to cardiac rehabilitation,216,222 healthcare 
providers’ reluctance to refer patients with SCAD for 
cardiac rehabilitation because of fears that physical ex-
ertion will trigger recurrent SCAD, or the belief that rel-
atively fit young patients without atherosclerotic heart 
disease may not benefit from cardiac rehabilitation.215 
Patients with SCAD who enroll in cardiac rehabilitation 
often do not complete the program213,214 and may face 
barriers to participation unique to young women such 
as caregiving and work responsibilities, travel concerns, 
cost, and ongoing symptoms.214,222
Physical Activity During and After 
Cardiac Rehabilitation
In light of the association with physical activity as a trig-
ger for SCAD, concern exists about the safety of various 
forms of physical activity and exercise after SCAD.13,223 
As a result, and with the potential for physical and 
mental harm, some patients with SCAD continue to re-
ceive advice to severely restrict their activities such as 
to avoid lifting >10 lb or not to pursue activity beyond 
limited walking,220 which could place them at the risks 
associated with a sedentary lifestyle. Many patients had 
high levels of physical activity before their first SCAD 
event and express high levels of motivation to resume 
those activities.214 Therefore, providers are encouraged 
to prescribe a prudent approach to physical activity, bal-
ancing known benefits of exercise with the potential 
risks associated with high levels of exertion and strain. 
Referral to and participation in cardiac rehabilitation are 
paramount for addressing exercise-induced symptoms, 
providing immediate feedback on exercise hemody-
namics, and individualizing fitness needs.
Although patients and providers want specific guide-
lines for or limits to physical activity, in the absence of 
evidence for benefit or harm, arbitrary heart rate and 
weight lifting limits can sometimes lead to frustration 
or fear with unclear benefit both during and after car-
diac rehabilitation participation. Clinicians may want to 
consider conservative thresholds for a cardiac rehabili-
tation entrance exercise treadmill test that mirror those 
of the Vancouver General Hospital SCAD Program 
(blood pressure no higher than 130/80 mm 
Hg; heart 
rate 50% to 70% of heart rate reserve; free weights 
for resistance training of 2 to 12 lb, starting low and 
gradually increasing).214
Weight training with resistance up to 20 lb for wom-
en and 50 lb for men was shown to be safe in a small 
SCAD cardiac rehabilitation series.214,220 Strength train-

ing recommendations are typically to use low resistance 
and high repetitions designed to avoid strain or Valsalva 
maneuver. Cardiopulmonary stress testing after cardiac 
rehabilitation has been used by some groups as a way 
of developing more precise and individualized param-
eters based on level of fitness. This allows the develop-
ment of parameters that avoid exercising near or above 
the anaerobic threshold and for detection of exercise-
induced hypertension.192,220,224
In the absence of evidence for benefit or harm, such 
heart rate and weight lifting limits remain arbitrary, and 
larger prospective studies are needed to confirm com-
parison with standard cardiac rehabilitation programs 
or the safety of higher physical activity thresholds.209,225 
Current practice is based largely on clinical experi-
ence214,220 and recommendations offered to patients 
with aortic dilatation or aortopathy,192,226 recognizing 
the substantial differences in exercise-induced hemody-
namics within the aorta and coronary arteries. In addi-
tion to any symptom-limited physical activity guidelines, 
patients with SCAD should generally be advised to avoid 
prolonged high-intensity activities, highly competitive 
or contact sports, activities performed to exhaustion 
(racing, boot camp), abrupt increases in physical activity 
without a warm-up, exercise in extremes of tempera-
ture (hot yoga, cold weather) or terrain, or performance 
of Valsalva maneuver during lifting or exercise.
Psychosocial Considerations
Addressing mental health is a critical component of 
improving the short- and long-term health of patients 
with SCAD. The psychosocial effects of a diagnosis of 
heart disease are substantial, but patients with SCAD 
are a particularly high-risk population given that they 
are predominantly younger women who have received 
a diagnosis with substantial uncertainty in terms of 
management and prognosis. Anxiety and depression 
are common among survivors of SCAD, especially in 
those whose SCAD occurred during the peripartum pe-
riod.225 In a recent cross-sectional study of 158 patients 
with SCAD, ≈40% reported a history of depression and 
anxiety at any point in their life, and about one third 
reported receiving medication or behavioral therapy for 
their anxiety and depression after their initial SCAD.225 
Baseline characteristics of patients with SCAD who par-
ticipated in cardiac rehabilitation showed that approxi-
mately one fifth214 to one third29 of patients reported 
a history of depression. Compared with patients with 
non-SCAD MI, patients with SCAD MI have higher psy-
chological distress, depression and worry, anxiety, and 
tension scores on psychosocial questionnaires.221
Patients with SCAD are an already high-risk group for 
psychological morbidity. Among all patients with prior 
MI, younger women are at high risk for post-MI chest 
pain syndromes compared with men and older women. 
They experience short- and long-term outcomes20,227,228; 
angina229–231; psychosocial risk factors, including de-
pression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder; in-
creased prevalence of stress or depression at the time 
of MI230,232; more caregiving responsibilities233; lower 
health-related quality of life229,230; and reduced physi-
cal and mental functioning after discharge.20,227–231,234 
Current guidelines recommend formal screening for 
depression and anxiety after MI,235 but younger and 
female patients often do not receive these services.222
Patients with SCAD also face unique issues. They 
are more often treated by a healthcare team that has 
little familiarity with their condition or who voice uncer-
tainty about the diagnosis or treatment. They may be 
repeatedly advised to “change their lifestyle” as if they 
had atherosclerosis, despite the absence of modifiable 
cardiovascular disease risk factors. The lack of effective 
secondary prevention options can be anxiety provok-
ing. Postpartum patients have the additional burden 
of caregiving, hormonal shifts, peripartum mood dis-
orders, and disruption of expectations of early bond-
ing with their infant or breastfeeding. Most survivors of 
SCAD are fearful of resuming physical activities in light 
of the possibility of triggering another dissection. The 
relatively uncommon nature of SCAD often results in 
a lack of peer support. In addition, the medical jargon 
inundating patients with newly diagnosed SCAD can 
often be intimidating; therefore, patient-focused medi-
cal literature such as a “patient page” describing SCAD 
in lay terms can be helpful.236
Online communities and virtual peer support are es-
pecially important because patients may be geographi-
cally separated from each other. The first SCAD-related 
international support community was hosted by Wom-
enHeart: The National Coalition for Women With Heart 
Disease.237 Additional SCAD-specific patient support, 
advocacy, and nonprofit groups have formed around 
the world to raise awareness of SCAD, to connect pa-
tients, and to disseminate clinical practice and research 
developments. These organizations include SCAD Al-
liance,238 Beat SCAD,239 and SCAD Research, Inc.240 In 
addition, numerous patient-initiated online communi-
ties have emerged on social media platforms. These 
organizations and peer support groups have allowed 
geographically diverse survivors of SCAD to connect 
with, to provide support to, and to receive support 
from peers.

sex- and age-matched control subjects after atheroscle-
rotic MI. The symptoms can challenge both patient and 
clinician and often result in frequent evaluations, diag-
nostic testing, and substantial psychological burden. 
Post-SCAD symptoms range from acute chest pain that 
is reminiscent of the patient’s SCAD presenting symp-
toms, typical or atypical angina, to clearly noncardiac, 
but concerning, symptoms.
The differential diagnosis for patients who have 
chest pain syndrome after SCAD is similar to that in 
patients after ACS, with the additional consideration 
of extension or recurrent coronary dissection (Figure 9). 
An initial careful history and physical examination are 
critical. The clinician should be vigilant for signs and 
symptoms of in-stent restenosis or recurrent SCAD. The 
presence of noncardiac pain should be a diagnosis of 
exclusion, but differentiating chest wall and musculo-
skeletal discomfort on the basis of reproducibility on 
physical examination can be reassuring. If patients have 
more classic exertional symptoms, then diagnostic test-
ing such as an exercise treadmill test, stress echocar-
diography, or perfusion imaging can be performed.25 If 
the study results are abnormal, coronary angiography, 
CCTA, and initial medical therapy are options, depend-
ing on the severity of symptoms and degree of isch-
emia. Alternatively, if symptoms are stable or there is 
evidence of a noncardiac cause of the discomfort, pa-
tients can receive close monitoring for cardiac symp-
toms, reassessment, and guidance on activities during 
cardiac rehabilitation.138,213
Frequently after SCAD, patients experience nitrate-
responsive chest pain, often at rest or with mental 
stress, but have no inducible ischemia with even high 
levels of exercise. Premenopausal women may report 
chest pain at variable but predictable times of their 
menstrual cycle.241 One hypothesis is that this is a result 
of enhanced coronary vasomotion and abnormal endo-
thelial function or persistent microvascular dysfunction. 
Clinically, some of these patients respond to empirical 
use of long-acting nitrates or calcium channel block-
ers, either daily or during days of the month when they 
are predictably symptomatic. Although the use of these 
agents may be limited by adverse effects of hypoten-
sion or headaches, empirical therapy may be consid-
ered if the patient’s symptoms are relieved with short-
acting nitrates. The frequency and severity of chest pain

CORONARY ARTERY ASSESSMENT 
AFTER SCAD
After the acute presentation, diagnosis, and in-hospital 
management of SCAD, there may be reasons to reim-
age the dissected coronary arteries. Given the potential 
risks of iatrogenic dissections in patients with SCAD, 
repeat coronary angiography should be performed 
only when benefits may outweigh the potential risks, 
such as in patients with recurrent symptoms, abnormal 
functional tests, unclear cause of coronary stenosis (to 
assess for angiographic healing to help differentiate 
SCAD from other coronary disease), or high-risk anat-
omy (eg, left main, proximal, or multivessel dissection, 
in which residual dissections may benefit from revascu-
larization for high ischemic burden). The role of CCTA 
for reassessment after SCAD was discussed previously. 
A summary of coronary imaging in the evaluation of 
post-SCAD chest pain in the nonacute setting is out-
lined in Figure 9.
PREGNANCY, CONTRACEPTION, AND 
HORMONE USE AFTER SCAD
Given the concerns for possible recurrent SCAD on 
re-exposure to the physical, hormonal, and potentially 
emotionally stressful conditions present during preg-
nancy and the postpartum period and the current lack 
of secondary prevention strategies, many clinicians 
recommend against subsequent pregnancy in women 
after SCAD, although there are few data to support 
this potentially life-changing recommendation. In the 
only published series to date examining subsequent 
pregnancy after a previous SCAD event, 8 patients 
were followed up for a median of 36 months (inter-
quartile range, 24±70 months). One of the 8 patients 
experienced recurrent SCAD after delivery, presenting 
with ST-segment–elevation MI and ultimately requir-
ing CABG because of unsuccessful PCI.242 Given the 
potential risk of recurrent SCAD in a subsequent preg-
nancy and the accumulating evidence that pregnancy-
associated SCAD can result in worse outcomes,85,90,96 
clinicians should carefully counsel any patient contem-
plating pregnancy of the potential risk. Included in the 
consideration are risks associated with medication use, 
functional status, and concomitant myocardial or valvu-
lar dysfunction.
Patients who elect to attempt pregnancy after SCAD 
should be referred to tertiary medical centers for precon-
ception assessment and counseling, and those who be-
come pregnant without such consultation should seek 
early postconception evaluation and close follow-up by a 
multidisciplinary team that includes maternal-fetal medi-
cine specialists, cardiologists with experience managing 
SCAD, and obstetric anesthesiologists. Patients should 
be counseled on the potential increased risk of dissec-
tion and complications during the pregnancy. The man-
agement of these patients should include careful review 
of their medical regimen and adjustment or removal of 
medications that are unsafe or not recommended in 
pregnancy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 
atenolol, statins) and cardiac testing, including baseline 
electrocardiography and echocardiography.
Careful planning of the labor and delivery process and 
close postpartum care are essential.90,209 Mode of delivery 
should be individualized, taking into account LV function, 
vascular comorbidities such as FMD and vascular Ehlers-
Danlos syndrome, and obstetric variables, with a goal 
of minimizing intrapartum cardiovascular stress. Con-
siderations include early epidural placement, left lateral 
decubitus positioning, and treatment of hypertension. 
Although there is insufficient evidence to guide optimal 
mode of delivery in patients with SCAD, most cardiolo-
gists and maternal-fetal medicine specialists advocate for 
vaginal delivery, similar to recommendations for women 
with systemic vascular or connective tissue disorders. Oth-
er factors are the increased risk of hemorrhage, infection, 
thrombosis, and hemodynamic fluctuations with cesare-
an delivery in patients with cardiovascular disease.197,243,244 
Minimizing maternal effort during vaginal delivery, with 
passive descent in the second stage of labor and delayed 
Valsalva effort, is advised; operative vaginal delivery or 
cesarean delivery is used secondarily.195,197
Because SCAD occurs primarily in women and is as-
sociated with pregnancy, there is a presumed patho-
physiological association with female sex hormones, 
although the precise relationship remains unclear. Al-
though there is no direct evidence linking hormonal 
contraception with recurrent SCAD, exogenous expo-
sure to systemically absorbed hormones, including es-
trogen and progesterone for contraceptive and post-
menopausal therapy, is usually avoided if possible, and 
they are used only if the nonhormonal options have 
been considered and the benefits of HT outweigh po-
tential risks.8 Preferred methods of contraception in-
clude vasectomy for the male partners of patients with 
SCAD, tubal ligation (preferably performed once dual-
antiplatelet therapy has been stopped), and intrauterine 
devices with local delivery of progestin (levonorgestrel 
20 μg/d). Traditional or copper-containing intrauterine 
devices may be associated with increased cramping and 
menorrhagia, particularly in women receiving aspirin or 
dual-antiplatelet therapy.
Many female patients with SCAD are faced with 
decisions about management of menopause and post-
menopausal HT. Compared with oral and transdermal 
hormonal contraceptives, postmenopausal HT formu-

lations have substantially lower levels of estrogen and 
progesterone and have a lower risk of thrombosis, but 
concerns include the uncertain effects of HT on SCAD 
incidence and recurrence and the absence of safety data 
available to guide the initiation or continuation of HT 
specific to SCAD. Therefore, it is necessary to individual-
ize recommendations through the use of relevant con-
sensus statements, guidelines,245 and indications for use 
and to take into account patient preferences, known 
and perceived risks and benefits, and symptom severity 
while recognizing that the risks of HT differ depending 
on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, 
timing of initiation, and whether a progesterone is used.
Patients who experience SCAD while receiving HT 
should have their indications for HT reassessed, and un-
less there are compelling reasons to continue, HT should 
be discontinued. Indications for initiation of exogenous 
HT include premature and early surgical menopause, 
severe vasomotor symptoms that cannot be managed 
with lifestyle or nonhormonal treatments, and local 
treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause.245 
If severe vasomotor symptoms or genitourinary syn-
drome of menopause develop at menopause or return 
on stopping the use of HT, consideration of the use of 
HT can be made in collaboration with cardiovascular 
and menopause specialists. The appropriate, often low-
est, effective dose of systemic HT consistent with treat-
ment goals that provides benefits and minimizes risks 
for the patient should be the therapeutic goal. Locally 
applied vaginal estrogen is generally thought to be safe 
because there is minimal systemic absorption. Patients 
with cardiovascular disease are typically advised to use 
a transdermal systemic agent to minimize activation of 
thrombotic factors and effects on lipids.246 The indica-
tions, benefits, and risks of continuing or discontinuing 
use of HT should be reviewed periodically.
MANAGEMENT OF ABNORMAL 
UTERINE BLEEDING AFTER SCAD
Antiplatelet therapy is frequently prescribed after 
SCAD, and many proposed therapeutic regimens call for 
the use of aspirin and short-term use of clopidogrel after 
PCI. In this setting, many women of reproductive age re-
ceiving dual-antiplatelet therapy report abnormal uterine 
bleeding. The most common type related to this therapy 
is heavy menstrual bleeding, defined as cyclic bleeding 
that is heavy for prolonged periods.247 Chronic or heavy 
bleeding can result in anemia and pose a substantial 
disruption to activities of daily living. An important first 
step is to reassess the indication for ongoing antiplatelet 
therapy and to discontinue its use if appropriate.
When chronic heavy menstrual bleeding develops in 
women receiving antiplatelet therapy after SCAD, espe-
cially if it is severe, they often require intervention to man-
age bleeding. Patients with hemodynamic instability or 
bleeding that saturates a large pad or tampon hourly for 
at least 4 hours usually warrant urgent evaluation, and all 
reproductive-age women with abnormal uterine bleeding 
should be tested for pregnancy. In women without car-
diovascular disease, medical management with HT is usu-
ally sufficient and the first-line approach to control most 
heavy menstrual bleeding, but this approach is relatively 
contraindicated in SCAD, and careful clinical judgment is 
required. Other nonhormonal, noncontraceptive options 
for treating abnormal uterine bleeding such as nonsteroi-
dal anti-inflammatory drugs and tranexamic acid should 
generally be avoided in women with SCAD given their 
association with MI and thrombosis.248–250
Among medical therapies for heavy menstrual bleed-
ing, progestin-eluting intrauterine devices such as the le-
vonorgestrel 20 μg/d–releasing device may be useful for 
controlling bleeding and protect against pregnancy.251,252 
Systemic progesterone levels may increase minimally with 
these intrauterine devices, but the main effect is at the en-
dometrial level. The levonorgestrel 20 μg/d–releasing de-
vice is the most effective approach (comparable to the ef-
ficacy of endometrial ablation), resulting in 71% to 95% 
reduction in menstrual blood loss, and is the only proges-
tin intrauterine device that has been evaluated for treat-
ment of abnormal uterine bleeding. In 2013, a lower-dose 
progestin device (releasing levonorgestrel 14 μg/d) be-
came available253 and, if shown effective for management 
of abnormal uterine bleeding, may afford advantages for 
patients with SCAD in light of lower hormonal absorption. 
Although there are theoretical safety concerns, cyclic oral 
progestin treatment has been found to reduce bleeding 
by 87%252,254,255 and generally results in irregular bleeding 
and often reduction of menses to only light bleeding. In 
hemodynamically unstable women in whom bleeding is 
not controlled, high-dose oral or injectable progestin-only 
medications may be considered for the short term.
Because patients with SCAD are generally advised to 
avoid both pregnancy and exogenous hormones and 
because the long-term efficacy of conservative surgi-
cal treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding such as 
second-generation endometrial ablation techniques 
(thermal balloon, microwave, radiofrequency) is greater 
than that of oral medical treatment,256 these interven-
tions may be considered in the management of heavy 
menstrual bleeding after SCAD. Advantages of these 
ablative procedures include effectiveness in managing 
bleeding, reduction of pregnancy risk, and the ability to 
perform the procedure on patients without discontinu-
ation of antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. Other 
surgical options to control abnormal uterine bleeding 
are used primarily for women with structural abnormal-
ities such as polyps and fibroids. Balloon tamponade 
(30-mL balloon catheter) has been described as an ad-
ditional mechanical option to control acute bleeding in 
women who do not respond to HT.

SCREENING FOR SCAD-ASSOCIATED 
CONDITIONS
In the majority of patients, SCAD is not an isolated 
event but is reflective of an underlying vascular, genet-
ic, or as-yet undetected condition. To help determine 
appropriate follow-up evaluations, practitioners caring 
for patients with SCAD should obtain a careful history, 
including a detailed review of systems and personal and 
family history of SCAD-associated symptoms and con-
ditions. A list of screening questions to consider in the 
evaluation of the patient with SCAD is given in Table 4.
DIAGNOSIS OF SCAD-ASSOCIATED 
EXTRACORONARY ARTERIOPATHIES
FMD and other extracoronary vascular abnormalities 
are strongly associated with SCAD13,34,257 and have the 
potential to affect management and inform prognosis. 
The rationale for extracoronary vascular screening is 
to diagnose underlying associated conditions such as 
FMD, which may point to a potential cause of SCAD, 
and to identify other vascular abnormalities such as 
aneurysms or dissections that may require additional 
evaluation, management, or longitudinal follow-up.75 
Accordingly, all patients who have experienced SCAD 
should undergo a complete vascular physical examina-
tion with palpation and auscultation of the abdominal 
aorta, cervical carotid arteries, and peripheral arteries 
of the upper and lower extremities. A diminished pulse, 
side-to-side asymmetry, or bruit may be indicative of 
stenotic or dissected arteries, and widened or bounding 
pulse may be indicative of aneurysmal disease. In the 
US Registry for FMD, the presence of an epigastric or 
flank bruit had low sensitivity for the detection of renal 
FMD (24.0%); however, the specificity and positive pre-
dictive value were 93.3% and 92.6%, respectively.257 
Thus, the absence of a bruit does not sufficiently rule 
out arterial disease, but its presence should heighten 
suspicion of an underlying arteriopathy.
Given the high coprevalence of FMD, aneurysm, and 
other extracoronary vascular abnormalities among pa-
tients with SCAD,13,34,70,76,258,259 vascular imaging from 
the brain to pelvis should be considered in all patients, 
similar to current practice for FMD.70,71 According to the 
US Registry for FMD,257 the most commonly involved 
vascular beds are the renal arteries (79.7%), followed 
by the extracranial carotid arteries (74.3%).70,257 Recent 
imaging series among patients with SCAD reported the 
presence of intracranial aneurysm in 14% to 23%.13,75 In 
addition, several conditions associated with an increased 
prevalence of unruptured intracranial aneurysms overlap 
with those associated with SCAD, including FMD, vas-
cular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, 
and polycystic kidney disease.257,260–264 The ultimate goal 
of vascular screening is the detection of high-risk aneu-
rysms or extracoronary abnormalities requiring treatment 
in order to avoid aneurysm rupture and other complica-
tions associated with substantial morbidity and mortal-
ity.265–268 Screening for FMD and other extracoronary vas-
cular abnormalities must include patient counseling for 
the possible outcomes, including a false-negative result

(false reassurance), a false-positive result (and the risk of 
further testing), a true-positive result with advice for con-
servative management (and the potential for anxiety at 
the knowledge of harboring an aneurysm or dissection), 
and a true-positive result with advice for treatment. In 
the case of a true-positive result, there is a risk of treat-
ment-associated harm (iatrogenic dissection, stroke, an-
eurysmal rupture, and adverse effects of contrast agent).
Long-term management of FMD and other extravas-
cular abnormalities is beyond the scope of this state-
ment, and we suggest using the approaches outlined 
in condition-specific American Heart Association guide-
lines and scientific statements.70,226,268
Angiography
The standard imaging method for diagnosing FMD is 
catheter-based angiography given its superior spatial 
resolution (<0.1 mm), and it is the definitive test to di-
agnose cases that are equivocal on noninvasive imag-
ing.70 In patients undergoing coronary angiography to 
diagnose SCAD, additional nonselective or selective re-
nal and iliac artery catheter-based angiography can be 
done in the same setting to assess for FMD. Similarly, 
for brain imaging, 2-dimensional digital subtraction an-
giography has historically been the reference standard 
for in vivo diagnosis of intracranial and cervical FMD 
and aneurysms, but the superior detection of small 
aneurysms or subtle FMD compared with noninvasive 
testing may not offer a clinically relevant advantage. 
Given this, as well as the low, but important, rate of 
procedural complications, digital subtraction angiogra-
phy is not generally used as an initial method for cere-
brovascular screening purposes but may be appropriate 
when the diagnosis is still uncertain after noninvasive 
imaging or when intervention is contemplated.70
Computed Tomography Angiography
In patients undergoing noninvasive imaging, the higher 
resolution of computed tomography compared with 
that of magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonog-
raphy and the ease of imaging across multiple vascular 
territories in a single scan may improve detection of the 
vascular abnormalities that are often found in SCAD.76 
Notably, the FMD findings in patients with SCAD may 
be subtle and can be missed if not specifically sought. 
Regardless of the imaging method chosen, careful and 
focused image interpretation is critical. Multiple recon-
struction formats, including multiplanar reformatted 
images, shaded surface display, and maximum-intensi-
ty projections, are necessary to adequately review for 
changes of FMD.70,269 For the detection of brain aneu-
rysms, multirow detector computed tomography angi-
ography is generally the preferred noninvasive imaging 
method because it provides detailed evaluation of the 
extracranial carotid, vertebral, and intracranial arteries 
for potential aneurysms.70,270,271 The sensitivity for aneu-
rysms <3 mm is 82%.271 Advances in computed tomog-
raphy technology such as third-generation dual-source 
systems continue to drive down radiation exposure 
and further shorten scanning time while preserving or 
improving image resolution. Novel protocols to image 
multiple vascular beds in a single diagnostic session can 
facilitate patient convenience and diagnostic accuracy 
over magnetic resonance angiography.75
Magnetic Resonance Angiography
Magnetic resonance angiography has lower spatial res-
olution than computed tomography angiography for 
FMD diagnosis,12,272 but newer magnetic resonance an-
giography can take advantage of volume rendering and 
strong magnets (3.0 T) that have increased the sensitiv-
ity for detection of aneurysms, despite the potential for 
false-negative and false-positive results.273 Benefits of 
magnetic resonance angiography include the absence 
of radiation, highly sensitive imaging of the brain pa-
renchyma, and no requirement for contrast agent. The 
technique is limited by contraindications to magnetic 
resonance imaging (implanted metal, older pacemak-
ers) and long scanning times that can lead to a higher 
likelihood of motion artifact degrading the image.
Duplex Ultrasonography
Duplex ultrasonography for the diagnosis of FMD is 
challenged by the need for highly skilled technicians 
and oversight by interpreting physicians.70 Given the 
lower sensitivity of duplex ultrasonography compared 
with that of computed tomography angiography or 
magnetic resonance angiography for FMD and other 
arteriopathies, this method has largely been replaced 
by computed tomography angiography or magnetic 
resonance angiography in most institutions for screen-
ing in the SCAD population.
Radiation Exposure: Special Considerations 
for Young and Female Patients
The disadvantage of angiographic or computed tomo-
graphic approaches to screening for extracoronary ab-
normalities and coronary imaging is the exposure to ion-
izing radiation. Given that the majority of SCAD occurs 
in young patients and that imaging plays a critical role in 
diagnosis and management, a discussion of radiation ex-
posure is highly relevant. For women, the lifetime attrib-
utable risk of cancer is estimated at 2- to 4-fold greater 
for an exposure occurring at 20 versus 60 years of age 
compared with the risk in men.274 Because these young 
patients have a longer potential lifespan and are at risk 
of recurrent SCAD events and other conditions requir-

ing imaging, there is an increased probability for mul-
tiple imaging tests, repeated procedures, and multiple 
healthcare providers being involved in their care. Cardiac 
imaging studies used in the evaluation of SCAD requir-
ing ionizing radiation (invasive angiography and CCTA, 
stress myocardial perfusion imaging with positron emis-
sion tomography, and single-photon emission computed 
tomography) should be performed only after individual-
ized assessment of risks and benefits. Both technological 
and operator radiation dose–reduction strategies should 
be used.275,276 Once systemic arteriopathy is diagnosed or 
an extracoronary dissection or aneurysm is identified that 
requires longitudinal follow-up, subsequent use of alter-
native imaging methods that do not expose the patient 
to ionizing radiation (eg, magnetic resonance angiogra-
phy, duplex ultrasonography) should be considered.70,76 
Particular efforts should be made to limit both patient 
and offspring radiation and contrast agent exposure in 
pregnant or lactating patients with SCAD, in whom non-
emergency imaging should be deferred.199
ROLE OF GENETIC EVALUATION
The yield from routine genetic testing in patients with 
SCAD, especially among those without a suggestive 
personal or family history or physical examination of 
an inherited systemic arteriopathy or connective tissue 
disorder, has been shown to be low,107 and in the ab-
sence of a suggestive history or physical examination 
(Table 4), routine genetic testing after SCAD is not cur-
rently advised. Similarly, in patients with FMD, screen-
ing for variants in known arteriopathy-causing genes 
also seems to be of low yield.121,122 However, given the 
known association of SCAD with several inherited ar-
teriopathies, referral to a specialist in medical genetics 
for further evaluation should be considered to aid in 
decision making for formal genetic assessment if an 
underlying systemic arteriopathy or connective tissue 
disorder is suspected in SCAD survivors. Patients with 
pregnancy-associated SCAD should also be considered 
for this evaluation because an underlying arteriopathy 
may be triggered by the hemodynamic and hormonal 
changes of pregnancy. Although the prevalence of 
these disorders is low, the diagnosis of a systemic arte-
riopathy may influence recommendations for frequen-
cy of vascular screening, timing of surgical intervention 
for aneurysms, or assessment of risk of pregnancy in 
the case of vascular Ehler-Danlos syndrome. This infor-
mation can also guide screening in first-degree family 
members to determine their risk of aneurysm or dissec-
tion and need for clinical screening.
Formal medical genetics consultation, and testing if 
indicated, should be performed at a referral center with 
experience in genetically mediated arteriopathies and 
availability of medical genetics specialists.277 Given the 
complex financial, insurance, familial, and social issues 
surrounding genetic testing, genetic counseling is para-
mount before mutation screening.277 During the clinical 
evaluation for a genetically mediated arteriopathy, fam-
ily history is assessed with a 3-generation pedigree, per-
sonal history, and examination for features characteris-
tic of connective tissue disorders, including features of 
Marfan syndrome and other disorders caused by trans-
forming growth factor-β pathway gene mutations, as 
reviewed in the Inheritance and Genetics section. Mar-
fan syndrome and neurofibromatosis may be diagnosed 
clinically.278,279 Clinical findings of polycystic kidney dis-
ease should prompt an evaluation, which may include 
gene testing in some cases.
When findings suggestive of an inherited disorder 
are present, sequencing of a panel of genes inclusive of 
inherited arteriopathies (eg, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, COL3A1, 
FBN1, ACTA2, SMAD3, PLOD1, and COL5A1) should be 
considered an efficient approach to evaluate genetically 
mediated vascular disease. The history and physical ex-
amination may be unrevealing in vascular Ehlers-Danlos 
syndrome, and thus, the threshold for COL3A1 muta-
tion testing may be lower.
Given the rapid expansion of identified genes for 
aortopathies, clinical genome sequencing (focused on 
whole genome or exome) may provide a single source 
of genetic data in which queries may be performed as 
new findings emerge. However, given the current lack 
of data showing defined, specific genetic causes for 
SCAD and the sporadic nature of the disease, routine 
whole-genome or exome sequencing is not currently 
recommended. In the absence of a confirmed diag-
nosis of a heritable arteriopathy or connective tissue 
disorder, clinical screening in first-degree family mem-
bers of patients who experienced SCAD is not clearly 
indicated.
SCAD PROGNOSIS AND  
RECURRENCE RISK
The short- and long-term prognosis and risks of SCAD 
recurrence are highly relevant and of concern to both 
patients and their providers. After hospital dismissal, in-
termediate and long-term adverse cardiovascular events 
after SCAD are relatively common and include chest pain, 
depression, anxiety, and major adverse cardiac events 
such as recurrent MI, recurrent SCAD, unanticipated 
revascularization, congestive heart failure, stroke, and 
death. At an intermediate-term follow-up of 2 to 3 years, 
major adverse cardiac events were reported in 10% to 
30% of cases, mostly caused by recurrent MI from recur-
rent SCAD, reported in 15% to 22% of patients.11,13,193 
At longer-term follow-up, major adverse cardiac events 
were reported in 15% to 37% at 5 to 7 years, and the 
Kaplan-Meier–estimated rate of major adverse cardiac 
events is ≈50% at 10 years.8,10,13 These longer-term major

vary considerably in the literature (0%–37%),8–11,13,30,280 
likely representing differences in study design, duration 
of follow-up, and definition of recurrence. Historically, 
the term recurrent SCAD has been used relatively inter-
changeably to describe 2 distinct forms of dissection: ex-
tension of the index dissection in the acute phase result-
ing from expansion of the IMH of the unhealed SCAD 
lesion and de novo dissection unrelated to the index 
dissection, affecting different coronary artery segments 
and occurring later (>30 days) and remote from the in-
dex event.8,11,13,19,281 Given the disparate features and 
pathophysiology of extension of dissection and de novo 
recurrent dissection, the term recurrent SCAD should be 
limited to describe subsequent de novo SCAD.
When reports of recurrent SCAD are limited to sub-
sequent de novo dissections, incident recurrent SCAD 
rates are more consistent, and SCAD recurs in previously 
unaffected arteries 77% to 100% of the time.8,11,13,19,281 
In the Mayo Clinic series, SCAD recurred in 17% of pa-
tients (15 of 87) at a median time to the second episode 
of 2.8 years, and the 10-year Kaplan-Meier–estimated 
risk of recurrence was 29.4%.8 In the updated series by 
Eleid et al83 with 246 patients, the reported rate was 
16% over a median duration of 1.7 years. In the Japa-
nese series, recurrent SCAD was reported in 19% of pa-
tients (14 of 63) at a median duration of 42 days.11 In 
the 168-patient Vancouver series, recurrent SCAD was 
reported in 13% of patients (22 of 168).6 In the updated 
310-patient Vancouver cohort, recurrent SCAD occurred 
in 11% of patients (34 of 310); in all patients, new coro-
nary artery segments were affected, and the recurrence 
was 30 days (median, 3.6 years) after the index SCAD.281
Identification of risk markers or risk factors for recur-
rent SCAD has been and remains an important clinical 
goal. Small sample size of studies has been a limitation, 
and to date, only severe coronary tortuosity has been 
identified as a risk factor for recurrence, with recur-
rence most likely to occur in a segment of tortuosity.83 
Whether tortuosity itself confers a direct pathophysi-
ological risk or is simply a marker of a high-risk patient 
phenotype remains uncertain. Coronary tortuosity was 
also shown to be a coronary manifestation of FMD12,82 
and thus may be a confounder for the presence and 
strong association with FMD. Furthermore, the pres-
ence of FMD itself has not been identified as a predictor 
of recurrent SCAD.83,193
RESEARCH PRIORITIES AND CALL  
TO ACTION
SCAD is an important cause of ACS in otherwise healthy 
young and middle-aged individuals, particularly women 
without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. It is fre-
quently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed and can po-
tentially result in substantial morbidity and mortality; a 
heightened suspicion for SCAD is required for accurate 
diagnosis and treatment. Despite increased recognition 
of the condition by the medical community and patients, 
large gaps in knowledge must be addressed to provide 
the best outcomes. It should be acknowledged that only 
recently have there been even limited prospective stud-
ies, and most available data are retrospective and ob-
servational. The findings are limited by referral bias and 
survivor bias, both of which may serve to overestimate 
recurrence risk. Conversely, the well-recognized sex 
bias in pursuing cardiac investigations in young women 
presenting with chest pain, together with known chal-
lenges in diagnosing SCAD even when investigations 
are undertaken, may serve to underestimate recurrence 
risk. Future larger-scale prospective and epidemiological 
studies will help further our understanding of the de-
mographic, treatment, and anatomic factors associated 
with recurrence and allow more accurate prediction and 
ultimate prevention of recurrent SCAD.
The writing committee has classified research priori-
ties into the areas of epidemiology, pathogenesis, diag-
nosis, and treatment (Table 5), each with key questions 
intended to spur collaborative research and advances in 
treatment for this disease. SCAD is an important cause of 
MI, particularly in young women. Although several key 
Table 5. Research Priorities and Key Questions  
in SCAD
Epidemiology
 What is the prevalence of SCAD in the general population?
  
Are there sex differences in the cause, presentation, diagnosis, and 
treatment of SCAD?
  
What is the recurrence rate of SCAD, and what are the determinants of 
recurrence?
Pathogenesis
  
Are there underlying genetic, hormonal, and environmental causes of 
SCAD, and what are the proportionate contributions of each?
  
What are the roles of physical and emotional stress and other potential 
triggers of SCAD?
  
What is the proportionate contribution of FMD and other systemic 
arteriopathies to the development and recurrence of SCAD?
Diagnosis
  
Under what circumstances and time frame and with what imaging 
method should follow-up coronary imaging be performed?
Treatment
 What are the optimal approaches for initial revascularization?
  
What is the role of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in SCAD 
immediately and after the event?
  
What are appropriate physical activity guidelines after SCAD?
  
What are the risks of exogenous hormone therapy and pregnancy after 
SCAD?
FMD indicates fibromuscular dysplasia; and SCAD, spontaneous coronary 
artery dissection.

CLINICAL STATEMENTS  
AND GUIDELINES
questions have yet to be answered, this writing group 
hopes that this document increases the awareness of 
SCAD among physicians and other healthcare providers 
and thus improves the recognition and management of 
SCAD. This awareness must then initiate collaborative re-
search efforts to help understand the natural history of 
SCAD and to develop therapies to prevent SCAD compli-
cations and recurrence. We applaud the efforts of SCAD 
survivor–led initiatives, which have sparked collaboration 
and research thus far. We also call on the medical com-
munity to continue efforts to drive progress in this disease 
and to educate fellow physicians about SCAD. We hope 
that this inaugural American Heart Association scientific 
statement on SCAD becomes the catalyst for a call to ac-
tion among the medical and patient communities.
