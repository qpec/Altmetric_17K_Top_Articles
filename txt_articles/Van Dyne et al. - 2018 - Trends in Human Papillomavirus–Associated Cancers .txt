Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known cause of cervical 
cancer, as well as some oropharyngeal, vulvar, vaginal, penile, 
and anal cancers. To assess trends, characterized by average 
annual percent change (AAPC), in HPV-associated cancer 
incidence during 1999–2015, CDC analyzed data from cancer 
registries covering 97.8% of the U.S. population. A total of 
30,115 new cases of HPV-associated cancers were reported in 
1999 and 43,371 in 2015. During 1999–2015, cervical cancer 
rates decreased 1.6% per year; vaginal squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC) rates decreased 0.6% per year; oropharyngeal SCC rates 
increased among both men (2.7%) and women (0.8%); anal 
SCC rates also increased among both men (2.1%) and women 
(2.9%); vulvar SCC rates increased (1.3%); and penile SCC 
rates remained stable. In 2015 oropharyngeal SCC (15,479 
cases among men and 3,438 among women) was the most com-
mon HPV-associated cancer. Continued surveillance through 
high-quality cancer registries is important to monitor cancer 
incidence and trends in these potentially preventable cancers.
HPV causes cervical cancer and some types of oropharyngeal, 
vulvar, vaginal, penile, and anal cancer; HPV DNA is found in 
specific tissue types that include carcinomas of the cervix and 
SCCs of the vulva, vagina, penis, oropharynx, and anus (1,2). 
The natural history from HPV infection to precancerous lesion 
to invasive cervical cancer is well established. HPV is the most 
commonly sexually transmitted infection in the United States 
and is often acquired soon after initiating sexual activity (3). 
Studies indicate that approximately 90% of new cervical HPV 
infections, including types that cause cancer, clear or become 
undetectable within 2 years, and those that do not clear take 
decades to progress to invasive cervical cancer.* Less is known 
about carcinogenic progression of HPV-associated infection 
at other anatomic sites (2).
CDC analyzed data from population-based cancer registries 
that participate in the CDC’s National Program of Cancer 
Registries and the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results program that met the criteria 
for high data quality for all years from 1999 to 2015; these

data cover approximately 97.8% of the U.S. population.† 
Invasive cancers are not tested for HPV in most cancer regis-
tries; therefore, an HPV-associated cancer was defined as an 
invasive malignancy in which HPV DNA was frequently found 
in special studies, including carcinomas of the cervix (i.e., SCC, 
adenocarcinomas, and other carcinomas) and SCC of the vulva, 
vagina, penis, oropharynx, and anus (including rectal SCC) (2) 
and was microscopically confirmed.§ Cases were classified by 
anatomic site and cell type using the International Classification 
of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition. Oropharyngeal SCC 
included squamous cell cancer types at the base of tongue, 
pharyngeal tonsils, anterior and posterior tonsillar pillars, glos-
sotonsillar sulci, anterior surface of soft palate and uvula, and 
lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls. Anal SCC also included 
rectal SCCs because they are biologically similar and might 
be misclassified. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated 
per 100,000 persons and standardized to the 2000 U.S. stan-
dard population. Trends were measured with AAPC in rates 
calculated using joinpoint regression.¶ Rates were considered 
to increase if the AAPC was greater than zero (p<0.05) and to 
decrease if the AAPC was less than zero (p<0.05); otherwise, 
rates were considered stable. A maximum of two joinpoints

certificate; 2) ≤3% of cases missing information on sex; 3) ≤3% of cases missing 
information on age; 4) ≤5% of cases missing information on race; and 5) ≥97%

§ HPV-associated cancers were defined as cancers at specific anatomic sites with 
specific cell types in which HPV DNA frequently is found. All cancers were 
microscopically confirmed. Cervical cancers (ICD-O-3 http://codes.iarc.fr/ 
[ICD-O-3] site codes C53.0–C53.9) are limited to carcinomas (ICD-O-3 
histology codes 8010–8671, 8940–8941). Vaginal (ICD-O-3 site code C52.9), 
vulvar (ICD-O-3 site codes C51.0–C51.9), penile (ICD-O-3 site codes 
C60.0–60.9), anal (including rectal SCC; ICD-O-3 site code C20.9, C21.0–
C21.9), and oropharyngeal (ICD-O-3 site codes C01.9, C02.4, C02.8, C05.1, 
C05.2, C09.0, C09.1, C09.8, C09.9, C10.0, C10.1, C10.2, C10.3, C10.4, 
C10.8, C10.9, C14.0, C14.2 and C14.8) cancer sites are limited to squamous 
cell carcinomas (ICD-O-3 histology codes 8050–8084, 8120–8131). Anal and 
rectal SCC were combined into a single category “anal SCC” because a very 
small subset of rectal cancers (i.e. the SCCs, around 700 per year) are similar 
to anal SCC.

was used. Rates and trends were estimated by sex, age group, 
race,** ethnicity,†† and region.§§
In the United States, a total of 30,115 new cases of HPV-
associated cancer were reported in 1999 and 43,371 in 2015 
(Table 1). In 1999, cervical carcinoma (13,125 cases) was the 
most common HPV-associated cancer: 3,750 more cases of 
cervical carcinoma than of oropharyngeal SCC were identified. 
During 1999–2015 cervical carcinoma rates decreased 1.6% 
per year, and oropharyngeal SCC rates increased 2.7% per 
year among men and 0.8% per year among women (Figure 1) 
(Figure 2). In 2015, there were 11,788 reported cases of cervical 
carcinoma and 18,917 cases of oropharyngeal SCC, including 
15,479 (82%) among men and 3,438 (18%) among women.
Rates of oropharyngeal SCC increased among men in all 
age groups ≥40 years, ranging from 0.8% among men aged 
40–49 years to 4.0% among those aged 60–69 years (Table 1). 
Rates varied by race, with the largest increase occurring among 
white men (3.3%), and by region, with rates increasing more 
in the Midwest (3.2%) than in other regions (Table 2).
During 1999–2015 cervical carcinoma rates were stable 
among women aged 35–39 years and decreased among women 
aged 20–34 years and aged ≥40 years, decreasing >3% per year 
among women aged 20–24 years and ≥70 years (Table 1). 
Cervical carcinoma rates decreased among all racial/ethnic 
groups, more among Hispanics than among non-Hispanics, 
and more in the West than in all other regions (Table 2). 
During 1999–2015 vaginal SCC decreased 0.6% per year.
In contrast, penile SCC rates were stable, and vulvar SCC 
rates increased 1.3% per year (Table 1) (Figure 2). Specifically, 
vulvar SCC rates increased during 1999–2015 among women 
aged 50–69 years, among whites (1.5%), and blacks (1.0%), 
and in the Northeast (1.5%), Midwestern (1.5%), and 
Southern (1.3%) regions of the United States.
Anal SCC rates increased among women (2.9% per year) and 
men (2.1%) during this period. The largest increases in anal 
SCC rates were among women aged 50–69 years (4.6%–4.8%

increased among white women (3.2% per year), black women 
(2.2%), white men (2.1%), and black men (3.0%). Anal SCC 
rates increased among both men and women in all regions 
except among men in the West region; the largest rate increases

Discussion
HPV-associated cancer rates changed from 1999 to 2015. 
Rates increased for oropharyngeal SCC, anal SCC and vulvar 
SCC, decreased for cervical carcinoma and vaginal SCC, and 
remained stable for penile SCC.
The decline in cervical cancer from 1999 to 2015 represents 
a continued trend since the 1950s as a result of cancer screen-
ing (4). Rates of cervical carcinoma in this report decreased 
more among Hispanics, American Indian/Alaska Natives, 
and blacks than other groups; however, incidence rates were 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause some types of cervical, 
vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers.
What is added by this report?
Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is now the most 
common HPV-associated cancer. During 1999–2015 cervical 
carcinoma incidence rates decreased 1.6% per year, and 
oropharyngeal SCC incidence rates increased 2.7% per year 
among men and 0.8% per year among women.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Population-based screening is recommended for only one 
HPV-associated cancer (cervical) at this time; however, HPV 
vaccination can prevent infection with the HPV types most 
strongly associated with cancer. Ongoing surveillance for 
HPV-associated cancers using high-quality population-based 
registries is critical to monitor cancer rates and trends.
still higher among Hispanics and blacks than among whites 
in 2015. These persistent disparities in incidence suggest that 
health care delivery needs of some groups are not fully met.
Several factors could contribute to the increase in oropha-
ryngeal and anal cancers including changing sexual behaviors. 
Unprotected oral sex and receptive anal sex are risk factors for 
HPV infection (2,5). White men have the highest number of 
lifetime oral sex partners and report first performing oral sex 
at a younger age compared with other racial/ethnic groups; 
these risk factors could be contributing to a higher rate of 
oropharyngeal SCC among white men than other racial/ethnic 
groups (6). Although smoking is a risk factor for oropharyngeal 
cancers, smoking rates have been declining in the United States, 
and studies have indicated that the increase in oropharyngeal 
cancer is attributable to HPV (5). In contrast to cervical can-
cer, there currently is no U.S. Preventive Services Task Force 
recommended screening for other HPV-associated cancers (7).
The findings in this report are subject to at least two limita-
tions. First, although population-based cancer registries provide 
a reliable system for counting invasive cancers, registries do 
not routinely determine the HPV status of cancers. In the 
United States, HPV DNA has been determined through spe-
cial studies and found in 91% of cervical, 91% of anal, 75% 
of vaginal, 70% of oropharyngeal, 69% of vulvar, and 63% 
of penile cancers (1). Second, reporting of race and ethnicity 
uses data from medical records, which might be inaccurate 
in a small proportion of cases. An important strength of this 
study is the use of high quality population-based surveillance 
data with 97.8% coverage of the U.S. population, allowing 
for specific histologic definitions to monitor HPV-associated 
cancer trends.

Measures to prevent HPV-associated diseases in the United 
States include both females and males; HPV vaccination was 
included in the routine immunization program for females in 
2006 and for males in 2011. Although it might be too soon for 
effects on invasive cancers from HPV vaccination in the United 
States, studies have reported reductions in cervical HPV infec-
tion, genital warts, and cervical precancers (8). Most cervical 
cancers are preventable with both HPV vaccination and regular 
and timely screening among women aged 21–65 years with 
follow-up for abnormal test results. Routine HPV vaccination 
is recommended at age 11 or 12 years; currently, the 9-valent 
HPV vaccine, which targets oncogenic types attributed to 73% 
of HPV-associated cancers, is being used in the United States 
(1,9). Further research to understand the progression from 
HPV infection to oropharyngeal cancer would be beneficial. 
Continued surveillance through high-quality registries is impor-
tant to monitor changes in HPV-associated cancer incidence.
