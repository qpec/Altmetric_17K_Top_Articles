Broad-based species comparisons across mammalian orders suggest a number of
factors that might influence the evolution of large brains. However, the relationship
between these factors and total and regional brain size remains unclear. This study
investigated the relationship between relative brain size and regional brain volumes and
sociality in 13 felid species in hopes of revealing relationships that are not detected in
more inclusive comparative studies. In addition, a more detailed analysis was conducted
of four focal species: lions (Panthera leo), leopards (Panthera pardus), cougars (Puma
concolor), and cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). These species differ markedly in sociality
and behavioral flexibility, factors hypothesized to contribute to increased relative brain
size and/or frontal cortex size. Lions are the only truly social species, living in prides.
Although cheetahs are largely solitary, males often form small groups. Both leopards and
cougars are solitary. Of the four species, leopards exhibit the most behavioral flexibility,
readily adapting to changing circumstances. Regional brain volumes were analyzed
using computed tomography. Skulls (n = 75) were scanned to create three-dimensional
virtual endocasts, and regional brain volumes were measured using either sulcal or bony
landmarks obtained from the endocasts or skulls. Phylogenetic least squares regression
analyses found that sociality does not correspond with larger relative brain size in these
species. However, the sociality/solitary variable significantly predicted anterior cerebrum
(AC) volume, a region that includes frontal cortex. This latter finding is despite the fact
that the two social species in our sample, lions and cheetahs, possess the largest
and smallest relative AC volumes, respectively. Additionally, an ANOVA comparing
regional brain volumes in four focal species revealed that lions and leopards, while not
significantly different from one another, have relatively larger AC volumes than are found
in cheetahs or cougars. Further, female lions possess a significantly larger AC volume
than conspecific males; female lion values were also larger than those of the other three
species (regardless of sex). These results may reflect greater complexity in a female lion’s
social world, but additional studies are necessary. These data suggest that within family
comparisons may reveal variations not easily detected by broad comparative analyses.

Regional Brain Variations in Felids
INTRODUCTION
One hypothesis proposed to explain the evolution of large brains
is the social brain hypothesis, which posits that social information
processing demands enhanced neural computational capabilities
leading to larger brains (Dunbar, 1992). In primates, larger brains
over and above that expected for a given body size, larger relative
neocortical volume and, in particular, larger relative volume of
the frontal lobes all positively correlate with social group size
(Dunbar and Bever, 1998; Dunbar, 2011). However, whether
these findings are unique to primates or apply more generally
to other mammalian orders remains unclear. One prediction of
the social brain hypothesis is that non-primate species living
in large, complex societies also process social information and
should exhibit comparable enlargement of brain areas as those
found in primate species. The order Carnivora offers a unique
opportunity to evaluate the relationship between brain size and
sociality since this group consists of more than 280 species in
which social complexity ranges from strictly solitary species to
highly social species living in large complex groups.
A broad analysis examining brain variation relative to
ecological, life history and behavioral factors across Carnivora
suggested that a number of factors, most notably, diet and
breeding group size, might influence brain size among carnivores
(Gittleman, 1986). Support for the social brain hypothesis was
provided by three subsequent studies which found positive
correlations between sociality in carnivores and relative brain
size (Perez-Barberia et al., 2007), relative cerebrum volume
(Swanson et al., 2012), and relative neocortex size (Dunbar
and Bever, 1998). However, others have emphasized that
both social and non-social variables likely influence brain size
in carnivores (Holekamp, 2007), including general cognitive
abilities as demonstrated by puzzle box problem solving (Benson-
Amram et al., 2016). Moreover, Finarelli and Flynn (2009) noted
that the positive relationship between sociality and brain size
in carnivores is driven mostly by a single family, Canidae,
which consists primarily of social species. They found no
relationship between brain size and sociality in either Felidae or
Hyaenidae (Finarelli and Flynn, 2009). In contrast, a later study
that focused on the four extant hyaenid species (Sakai et al.,
2011a,b) found that social group size was positively correlated
with relative frontal cortex volume. While these last two studies
differ somewhat with respect to the variables measured, this
discrepancy suggests that analyses at lower taxonomic levels
may reveal patterns not easily detectable in broad species
comparisons.
Several
studies
have
demonstrated
that
the
relative
proportions of brain structures vary uniquely between taxa
and suggest that this is a result of grade specific shifts in brain
evolution (Barton and Harvey, 2000; Clark et al., 2001; Bush
and Allman, 2004; Iwaniuk and Arnold, 2004; Reep et al., 2007;
Smaers et al., 2012). It has further been argued that analyses at
lower taxonomic levels (e.g., within species and families) may
reveal details of brain size variation not observed in comparisons
across mammalian orders (Willemet, 2012). Closely related
species are expected to possess a characteristic brain cerebrotype,
a generalized pattern of weighted brain structures. Deviations
from that characteristic cerebrotype can aid in identifying how
various selection pressures impact brain evolution. Here, we
examine variation in total and regional brain size within the
family Felidae in hopes of revealing patterns that are not detected
in more inclusive comparative studies.
We investigate the relationship between relative regional brain
volumes and sociality in 13 felid species, while controlling for
the non-independent effect of phylogeny. In addition, a more
detailed species level analysis was conducted of four focal species,
including two that differ in sociality by sex (i.e., lions, Panthera
leo, and cheetahs, Acinonyx jubatus) and two that are solitary (i.e.,
leopards, Panthera pardus, and cougars, Puma concolor). Lions
are the only truly social felids, living in groups (prides) of as many
as 21 females and a dominant male (Mosser and Packer, 2009).
Females typically stay in the pride to which they were born, while
males leave their birth pride and attempt to take over another,
often working with other males to overthrow the resident male.
The only other social felids are male cheetahs, which often
form small groups (Caro and Collins, 1987); female cheetahs,
leopards and cougars are typically solitary. This comparison
expands on a previous study comparing brain volumes in lions
and cougars (Arsznov and Sakai, 2012). Here, three predictions
regarding inter- and intraspecific differences and regional brain
volumes were evaluated: (1) if sociality presents a greater neural
computational demand, then relative brain size is expected to
be larger in lions and cheetahs than in other felid species;
(2) similarly, since the frontal cortex has been implicated in
social information processing, proportionately greater frontal
cortex volume should be found in social compared to solitary
felids; (3) finally, given that males and females experience very
divergent social life histories in lions and cheetahs, but not in
leopards and cougars, relative frontal cortex volume should be
sexually dimorphic in the former, but not the latter. Here, virtual
endocasts were created from computed tomographic (CT) scans
of the skulls. Quantitative assessments of total and regional brain
volumes were obtained in order to examine both inter- and
intra-specific brain variations in selected felid species.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample
A total of 75 adult skulls, representing 13 felid species, were
examined. Each species was represented by at least one male
(m) and one female (f). Additional skulls were included in a
focal species level inquiry: lions (8 males, 6 females), leopards (10
males, 6 females), cougars (6 males, 7 females), and cheetahs (9
males, 5 females). The skulls were obtained from the collections
of Michigan State University Museum, University of Michigan
Museum of Zoology, American Museum of Natural History and
Field Museum of Natural History (see Appendix 1). Data on
11 felid species new to this study are combined with previously
collected lion and cougar CT scans (Arsznov and Sakai, 2012).
New regional brain volume and skull length data for each
skull were collected for this study. Our sampling attempted
to avoid, inasmuch as possible, captive status and conspecifics
collected from different geographical regions, as captivity and

Regional Brain Variations in Felids
geography are known to contribute to intraspecific variation in
brain size in both lions and tigers (Yamaguchi et al., 2009).
However, an additional requirement for undamaged skulls with
intact tentoriums necessarily limited the selection pool. In
our sample, lions, cheetahs and leopards originated primarily
from Africa. Although a number of leopard subspecies have
been named in Africa, only one (Panthera pardus pardus) is
supported by genomic analysis (Uphyrkina et al., 2001). Three
male leopards were from Sri Lanka and represent an additional
leopard subspecies, Panthera pardus fusca. Our cougar sample
includes individuals from both North and South America. Our
analysis did not reveal consistent species level variation related to
either captive status or geographical origin.
Computed Tomography
All skulls were scanned in a General Electric Discovery ST 16 or
64 slice scanner along the rostral-caudal axis in the Department
of Radiology, Michigan State University. The following scanning
parameters were used: 0.625 mm slice thickness, DFOV 18,
0.531:1 pitch, and 0.5 s scan rotation. Data were saved as Digital
Imaging and Communications in Medicine Centricity (DICOM)
images and imported to MIMICS 15.0 software (Materialise,
Inc., Plymouth, MI, USA), which was used to create the 3D
endocasts. These procedures were previously described in detail
(Sakai et al., 2011a,b). To summarize, the endocranial air space
deep to bone was selected in each coronal section from the
cribriform plate rostrally to the opening of the foramen magnum
caudally. Sections were subsequently compiled to create a three
dimensional virtual endocast. Total endocranial volume and
regional volumes were obtained using the MIMICS 3D volume
measurement operation.
The endocast was subdivided into four brain regions based
on both bony landmarks and the gyral and sulcal pattern. These
subdivisions are: olfactory bulb (OB), anterior cerebrum (AC),
posterior cerebrum (PC), and cerebellum/brain stem (CB+BS)
(Figure 1A). OB volume was defined as the region extending
from the cavity posterior to the nasal turbinates to the point of
the greatest constriction of this cavity (Figure 1D). The region
AC extends from OB posteriorly to the cruciate sulcus at midline
and ventrally to the optic canal (Figure 1E). The cruciate sulcus
is used here as a boundary since it is found reliably and is
known to coincide with the premotor and motor areas in many
carnivores studied (Hassler and Muhs-Clement, 1964; Stanton
et al., 1986; Sakai, 1990; Arsznov et al., 2010; Arsznov and Sakai,
2012). Although frontal cortex is defined in primates as the
cortex anterior to the central sulcus, the boundary between motor
and somatosensory cortex, a similar sulcal boundary is highly
variable in both size and shape and is not present in all carnivores
(Radinsky, 1969). The AC volume here is thus comprised of
the frontal cortex and subcortical structures, including a small
portion of the rostral-most head of the caudate nucleus, ventral
pallidum, olfactory tubercle and prepiriform cortex. PC volume
includes the region caudal to the cruciate sulcus but rostral
to the cerebellar tentorium (Figure 1F). This region includes
cortex caudal to the cruciate sulcus, underlying diencephalic and
rostral mesencephalic structures. Lastly, the CB+BS volume lies
between the foramen magnum and the cerebellar tentorium.
Thus, the CB+BS volume measurement includes cerebellum,
caudal mesencephalon, pons and medulla. Body weight data were
not available for each individual specimen. Instead, skull basal
length, the distance from the anterior border of the median
incisive alveolus to the mid-ventral border of the foramen
magnum, served as a proxy for body size (Figure 2A). Skull basal
length strongly correlates with body weight (Radinsky, 1984) and
is a reasonable substitute for body size when individual body
weight is not available (Janis, 1990; Van Valkenburgh, 1990).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was based on 75 endocasts representing 13
felid species. The relationship between total endocranial volume
and skull basal length was evaluated using Pearson’s r correlation
coefficient. A phylogenetic least squares regression analysis
(PGLS) was performed (Grafen, 1989) on total endocranial
volume (species averages) as a function of skull basal length
(species averages) and sociality (social vs. solitary). This analysis
assumed a Brownian motion model of evolution, using the
nlme (Pinheiro et al., 2014) and ape (Paradis et al., 2004)
packages in R version 3.1.0 (R Core Team, 2014). Briefly, a felid
phylogeny was constructed for the 13 species using estimated
divergence times presented in Johnson et al. (2006) (Figure 3).
Divergence time for Felis lybica was used for F. silvestris in
our analysis because subspecies information was not available
and these skulls originated from Africa. PGLS regressions were
also performed on three regional endocranial volumes (AC, PC,
and CB+BS), in each case looking at regional volume (species
averages) as a function of the rest of endocranial volume (i.e.,
total endocranial volume minus the volume of that region) and
sociality. Additionally, the subfamilies Pantherinae and Felinae
(Figure 3) were compared with respect to regional endocranial
volumes [as a proportion of rest of endocranial volume using
phylogenetic analyses of variance (ANOVA) in the geiger package
(Harmon et al., 2008)].
For the species-level comparisons of lions, leopards, cougars,
and cheetahs, differences in proportional regional brain volumes
were examined among species (ANOVA) and between sexes (t-
tests) using the statistical software package IBM SPSS 20.0 (IBM
corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).
RESULTS
Interspecies Differences
Whole Brain Endocasts
Major features of external brain morphology are visible in
the virtual endocasts, as evidenced by comparing a leopard
whole brain photograph (Figure 1C) to the virtual endocast
from the same species (Figure 1B). Prominent sulci including
the cruciate sulcus, lateral sulcus, ansate sulcus, suprasylvian
sulcus, anterior and posterior limbs of the ectosylvian sulcus
and sylvian sulcus are all clearly visible in the endocast (see
Figure 1 in Arsznov and Sakai, 2012, for lion and cougar
brain-to-endocast comparisons). Gross examination of species
differences in brain structure (based on endocasts) indicate
that the orientation of, and patterns formed by the sylvian

sulcus, suprasylvian sulcus, lateral sulcus, and cruciate sulcus
are similar across felids. However, interspecific differences were
observed in the presence of small sulci along the midline and
in the pattern formed by the postlateral sulcus. Further, while
the ectosylvian sulcus divides into an anterior and posterior
limb in the same general location in most species studied, it is
variably present as a single arched sulcus dorsal to the sylvian
sulcus and ventral to the lateral sulcus in lions and cougars.
In addition, most felids possess a small post-cruciate sulcus
located posterior to the cruciate sulcus and anterior to the
limbs of the ansate sulcus, however, this post-cruciate sulcus
was not readily identifiable in cheetahs. Line drawings of a
dorsolateral view of cheetah and leopard brains are shown in
Figures 4A,B, respectively. The cruciate sulcus is located quite
rostrally and is barely visible in a dorsal view of the cheetah
endocast and the most rostral part of the cheetah brain appears
flexed in comparison to the more horizontal slope of the dorsal
surface of the brain in other felids (see Figures 4C,D). When
viewed dorsally, the cheetah brain is globose in shape and
notably more rounded in appearance than observed in other
felids, such as leopards (Panthera pardus), ocelots (Leopardus
pardalis), wildcats (F. silvestris), bobcats (Lynx rufus), Geoffrey’s
cats (Leopardus geoffroyi), and kodkods (Leopardus guigna)
(Figure 3).

Endocranial Volume and Regional Brain Differences
Skull basal length (the proxy for body size) and total endocranial
volume are highly correlated in the 13 felid species examined
here (Pearson’s r = 0.96, p < 0.001) (Figure 2B). A PGLS
analysis revealed that skull basal length significantly predicts
total endocranial volume (β = 0.55, p < 0.001), but found
no significant effect of sociality on relative endocranial volume
(β = 0.28, p = 0.22), and no significant interaction (β = −0.13,
p = 0.20).
Phylogenetic least squares analyses of regional volumes
showed that both the rest of endocranial volume (β = 0.065,
p < 0.001) and the sociality/solitary variable (β = −5891.78,
p = 0.003) significantly predict AC volume (Figure 5).
Additionally, there is a significant interaction for AC volume
between rest of endocranial volume and sociality/solitary
(β = 0.032, p = 0.004) wherein rest of endocranial volume is
a significant predictor of AC volume in solitary species. Rest
of endocranial volume also significantly predicts PC volume
(β = 2.60, p < 0.001) and CB+BS volume (β = 0.23, p < 0.001)
(Figure 5). However, sociality was not a significant predictor in
either analysis: PC (β = 23264.90, p = 0.07), CB+BS volumes
(β = −1521.80, p = 0.60). Averaged endocranial and regional
brain volumes for each species are shown in Table 1.

p < 0.001 and F(3,53) = 30.72, p < 0.001, respectively] (Figure 6).

leopards have a significantly larger relative AC than cougars
(p < 0.001, p = 0.001, respectively) or cheetahs (p < 0.001,
p < 0.001, respectively). Additionally, while lions have a relatively
larger AC than leopards, this difference is not statistically
significant (p = 0.71). Cheetahs have the smallest AC to rest of
endocranial volume of the four species (p < 0.001; Figure 6).
Post hoc comparisons of relative PC to rest of endocranial volume
revealed that both cougars and cheetahs have a significantly larger
relative PC than lions (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively) or
leopards (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). However, there
were no significant differences in relative PC between cougars
and cheetahs (p = 0.05) or between lions and leopards (p = 0.74).
No significant main effect of the relative volume of CB+BS was
present between the species [F(3,53) = 1.34, p = 0.27].
Sex Differences in Regional Brain Volume in Four
Felid Species
Independent t-tests for sex differences in proportional regional
brain volumes of the four focal species (lions, leopards, cougars,
and cheetahs) revealed significant sex differences in lions and
cougars, but not in cheetahs or leopards. In lions, females possess
a significantly larger AC to rest of endocranial volume than
males [t(12) = 2.54, p = 0.03] (Figure 7A). This difference
is evident from gross examination of the dorsal brain surface
of adult male and female lions (Figures 7B,C). No significant
sex differences in relative PC or CB+BS were found in lions
[t(12) = 0.57, p = 0.58 and t(12) = 0.68, p = 0.51, respectively].
For cougars, no significant sex difference was identified in relative
AC [t(11) = 0.20, p = 0.84], but females had a significantly larger
relative PC than males [t(11) = 3.32, p = 0.007], while males had
a significantly larger relative CB+BS than females [t(11) = 2.67,
p = 0.02].
DISCUSSION
The relationship between regional brain volumes and sociality
was examined in wild-caught representatives of 13 felid species.
We found that sociality does not correspond with larger relative
brain size in these species. However, a PGLS regression analysis
revealed that the interaction of the sociality/solitary variable
and rest of endocranial volume has a significant effect on
AC volume. Relative AC volume is significantly predicted
by rest of endocranial volume in solitary species. The two
social felid species, lions and cheetahs, possess the largest and
smallest relative AC volumes, respectively. Inter- and intra-
specific comparisons of regional brain volumes in four focal
species (lions, leopards, cougars, and cheetahs) revealed that
lions and leopards have the largest relative AC volumes, and
lions exhibit significant sexual dimorphism in relative AC, with
larger volumes in females than in males. Based on these results,

Toward a Felid Cerebrotype
Our observations of a general felid cerebrotype, reflected in
characteristic regional brain morphology, is consistent with the
remarkable similarities in behavior, diet and ecology noted across
the family Felidae (Eaton, 1979; Bekoff et al., 1984; Mellen,
1993). Most member species are found in woodland or woodland
fringe terrain, most are nocturnal, most are meat eaters and
typically stalk and ambush prey (Eaton, 1979; Bekoff et al.,
1984; Mellen, 1993). An inspection of the endocasts and 3D
printed models created for each of the 13 species revealed
remarkable similarity in gross external brain morphology. The

respectively) or cheetahs (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively), and cougars have a significantly larger relative AC than cheetahs (p < 0.001). Although relative AC
volume is greater in lions than in leopards, this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.71). Relative PC volume is significantly greater in cheetahs and cougars
than in lions (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively) or leopards (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively), but does not differ significantly between lions and leopards
(p = 0.74) or between cougars and cheetahs (p = 0.05).

Regional Brain Variations in Felids
general pattern formed by sulci and gyri exhibited little variation
despite a large range in brain size and species relatedness.
The configuration and location of major sulci including the
lateral sulcus, suprasylvian sulcus, and sylvian sulcus were very
similar across species (Figure 3). For example, the anterior
and posterior limbs of the ectosylvian sulcus typically remain
separate in felids and the pattern formed by, and orientation
of, the cruciate sulcus are also relatively constant. The cruciate
sulcus is an important sulcus delimiting caudal area 4, the
primary motor cortex, from rostral area 4 and the premotor
area 6 based on cytoarchitectonic analysis in the cat (Hassler
and Muhs-Clement, 1964), dog (Tanaka et al., 1981; Stanton
et al., 1986), ferret (McLaughlin et al., 1998), and raccoon (Sakai,
1990). Although this is a limited sample, it is reasonable to
infer that the cruciate sulcus similarly demarcates the premotor
and rostral motor areas from the caudal motor area in wild
felids. Another relatively constant feature of the felid pericruciate
region found in most of the studied species is the presence
of a post-cruciate sulcus, a small sulcus located posterior
to the cruciate sulcus and rostral to the medial and lateral
limbs of the ansate sulcus. This sulcus is often quite variable
in carnivores, but when present, demarcates the boundary
between the somatosensory cortex caudally and the motor cortex
rostrally based on electrophysiological mapping studies in the
cat (Nieoullon and Rispal-Padel, 1976), dog (Gorska, 1974), and
raccoon (Welker and Seidenstein, 1959; Hardin et al., 1968).
The remarkable similarities in brain morphology and sulcal
patterns among extant felids were previously noted by Radinsky
(1969, 1975) and our present observations largely support his
descriptions.
Some deviations from the general felid plan were also noted.
For example, although the two limbs of the ectosylvian sulcus
are typically separate, it is a single complete arch uniting the
anterior and posterior ectosylvian sulci inconsistently either
between cerebral hemispheres or between individuals in lions and
less often in cougars. The middle ectosylvian gyrus contains the
primary auditory cortex in the cat (Reale and Imig, 1980) and
dog (Tunturi, 1962; Lyras and Van Der Geer, 2003), but it is
unclear how the presence of a single complete ectosylvian arch
in these species might be functionally related. Second, overall
brain shape ranged from a rounded, globose morphology, to a
more elongated form across the felid species. In the globose form,
the temporal lobes appear more distinct and broader than those
found in the elongated form. Radinsky (1975) noted the globose
brain shape of cheetahs and Lynx sp. (including Lynx canadensis)
and suggested that this form may be more characteristic of
smaller felids. Our data confirm that the globose form is found
in cheetahs and Lynx canadensis, but also in lions, tigers, cougars,
and jaguars. A more elongated brain shape is evident in leopards,
ocelots, wildcats, bobcats, Geoffrey’s cats and kodkods. Whether
this difference in brain shape is related to felid brain evolution
or a consequence of variation in skull morphology is beyond
the scope of the present study. However, a recent analysis using
geometric morphometrics to examine brain shape evolution in
New World monkeys (Aristide et al., 2016) promises to be a
useful method in future studies examining convergence of brain
phenotypes.
Exceptions to the Rule: Cheetahs and
Lions
Despite the relative conservation of behavior, diet, and ecology,
along with the remarkable similarities in sulcal and gyral patterns
and overall brain shape among felids, two species stand out from
the others: cheetahs and lions. These are the only social species
in the family, and while relative AC volume is predicted by
rest of endocranial volume for solitary species, that was not the
case for these social cats. Relative regional brain volumes differ
significantly between lions and cheetahs, and also between each
of these species and other felids.
The brain morphology of cheetahs is distinctive in at least
three respects. First, the post-cruciate sulcus that typically
separates motor and somatosensory cortex in felids is absent
in cheetahs. Radinsky (1975) first noted this difference and
speculated that the absence of this sulcus might be related
to limited motor control of limb musculature. Cheetahs are
limited in forepaw use (Van Valkenburgh, 1996). The ability
to climb trees and manipulate prey is diminished compared
to other felids. In tests of forepaw dexterity, cheetahs rank
the lowest among felids studied (Iwaniuk et al., 2000). Second,
overall brain shape is more globular in cheetahs than in
other felids; this appears to reflect the broad expanse of the
temporal lobes. Finally, the brain of cheetahs exhibits a distinctive
rostral dorsiflexion not found in other cats (Figures 3 and 4C).
This dorsiflexion and the associated domed skull likely reflect
the cheetah’s unusually large frontal sinuses (O’Regan, 2002;
Sicuro and Oliveira, 2011; Curtis and Van Valkenburgh, 2014),
which are hypothesized to act as a vascular cooling mechanism
facilitating the ability to engage in high speed chases (Salles,
1992; Sicuro and Oliveira, 2011). The unique skull morphology
of cheetahs is also thought to improve biting efficiency, allowing
the animal to use less muscle force to achieve killing bite
strength (Chamoli and Wroe, 2011; Sicuro and Oliveira, 2011).
The reduced muscle and bone mass contribute to a lighter
body, which may also facilitate increased speed in chase
pursuits.
Social life history is sexually divergent in cheetahs. As in
most other felids, female cheetahs are typically solitary except
when raising young. However, male cheetahs are considered
semi-social. They may be solitary (41%) or form coalitions
comprised of two (40%) or three (19%) (usually related)
individuals (Caro and Collins, 1987; Durant et al., 2004). These
male coalitions can last a lifetime. Male coalitions gain a
territorial and reproductive advantage in regions where coalitions
are common (Durant et al., 2004). Although male coalitions
may hunt larger prey than solitary cheetahs, they cooperate
little during a hunt (Caro and Kelly, 2001). We expected
that the social behavior exhibited by male cheetahs might be
reflected in its having a larger relative AC volume than non-
social cats (including female cheetahs), similar to the effect
found previously in social carnivores such as spotted hyenas
(Arsznov et al., 2010), coatimundis (Arsznov and Sakai, 2013),
and lions (Arsznov and Sakai, 2012). However, we found
that cheetahs possess the smallest anterior cerebrum volume
of all species studied here and exhibit no significant sexual
dimorphism.

Regional Brain Variations in Felids
Cheetahs also possess the smallest relative brain volume of
the species we sampled. Small brains weigh less and require less
energy, factors that might contribute to the remarkable running
speeds that cheetahs achieve. The unique morphology of cheetahs
might also reflect, at least in part, their unusual genetic history.
Cheetahs experienced two severe population bottlenecks, one as
many as 10,000 years ago, and a second, as recently as within
the last 100 years (O’Brien et al., 1987), resulting in a 95–98%
reduction in genetic diversity compared to other (selected) wild
felids (Dobrynin et al., 2015). In our sample, the closest relative
to cheetahs, cougars, possess both larger relative brain size and
larger relative AC volume.
The largest relative AC volume was found in female lions,
which are, by far, the most gregarious of felids. The social group,
the pride, consists of as many as 21 adult females, offspring and
male coalitions (Mosser and Packer, 2009; VanderWaal et al.,
2009). Female lions are primarily philopatric and remain social
throughout their lives. The pride is a stable social unit lacking
a dominance hierarchy. Pride females communally rear their
young and may nurse offspring of other pride members. They
work together to protect cubs from invading males (Packer et al.,
2001) and will also coordinate their movements in hunting large
prey and defending their territory (Packer and Pusey, 1997).
Male lions, in contrast, disperse upon reaching sexual maturity
and live alone or as part of a small coalition of usually brothers
or cousins (Packer and Pusey, 1997; VanderWaal et al., 2009).
A nomadic male lion may challenge a dominant male to take
over a pride, then aggress, often lethally, against young cubs.
Typically, a male lion is dominant in the pride for 2–3 years
before being displaced. Solitary male lions are less successful
hunters than group hunting female lions. Although the lion
pride is a fission–fusion society with individuals dispersing
and returning to the group (VanderWaal et al., 2009), it is
socially cohesive. Social network analysis of both captive origin
and wild prides indicate that female lions are central to the
social network with adult male lions most likely to receive
and least likely to initiate social interactions (Dunston et al.,
2016a,b). Male lions are not only less social than female
lions, but are also larger and more aggressive than female
lions. The cognitive demands associated with social information
processing are expected to be greater in female than male
lions. Appropriate behavior in response to dominance and
aggression demands impulse control and behavioral inhibition.
These behaviors are associated with frontal cortex functions in
other species, particularly primates (Hauser, 1999; for review,
see Passingham and Wise, 2012). Although the role of frontal
cortex in felids is not yet known, the finding of a larger relative
AC volume in female lions than in other cats (including male
lions) might similarly reflect the unusual social demands they
encounter.
An association between relative AC volumes and sociality has
been found in other carnivore families. The highly social spotted
hyena has a larger relative AC volume than other, less social
hyenids (Sakai et al., 2011a,b). Similarly, a larger relative AC
volume was found in the social coatimundis than in less social
procyonids (Arsznov and Sakai, 2013). Moreover, sex differences
in relative AC volume were found in both spotted hyenas
(Arsznov et al., 2010) and coatimundis (Arsznov and Sakai,
2013), consistent with enhanced social processing demands.
Despite much inquiry, it remains unclear whether enhanced
cognitive skills or the cognitive demands of social information
processing selectively drive frontal cortex size and/or relative
or absolute brain size (Gittleman, 1986; Dunbar, 2011; Smaers
et al., 2012; MacLean et al., 2014). A recent study examined
performance in 39 carnivore species across nine families and
reported that problem solving capabilities corresponded with
larger relative brain size but failed to find an association with
sociality (Benson-Amram et al., 2016). However, large-scale
comparisons can overlook variation occurring at a family level.
A similar problem-solving task was applied to study social and
solitary felids and found that lions exceeded the performance of
leopards and tigers on measures of innovation and exploration
in solving a puzzle box problem (Borrego and Gaines, 2016).
These authors suggest that the superior cognitive performance
exhibited by lions is related to selection pressures associated with
sociality. In this regard, it is of interest that here relative AC
volume in leopards, a solitary species, did not differ significantly
from that found in lions, and was larger than that found in
cheetahs, suggesting that factors other than sociality drive AC
volume. Of all the wild felids, leopards are especially noted for
their behavioral flexibility and adaptability (Hayward and Kerley,
2008; Pitman et al., 2013), behaviors associated with enhanced
cognitive processing (Sol, 2009). These results suggest that taxon
level analysis as well as within species comparisons lead to
results not easily detected by broader comparative analyses.
Additional studies examining social, ecological and life history
variables associated with regional brain volume differences within
carnivoran families are needed. Other carnivoran families such as
Mustelidae, Canidae, and Herpestidae exhibit greater variation in
social behavior than that found in Felidae. Parallel regional brain
analyses within these families are expected to further elucidate the
association between sociality and relative frontal cortex volume.
