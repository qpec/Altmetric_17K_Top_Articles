ABSTRACT
Objective: To provide an estimate of the annual number of super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE)
cases in the US and to evaluate utilization of hospital resources by these patients.
Methods: The Premier Hospital Database was utilized to estimate the number of SRSE cases based on
hospital discharges during 2012. Discharges were classified as SRSE cases based on an algorithm using
seizure-related International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) codes, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length
of stay (LOS), and treatment protocols (e.g. benzodiazepines, anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), and ventilator
use). Secondary analyses were conducted using more restrictive algorithms for SRSE.
Results: A total of 6,325 hospital discharges were classified as SRSE cases from a total of 5,300,000 hos-
pital discharges. Applying a weighting based on hospital characteristics and 2012 US demographics,
this projected to an estimated 41,156 cases of SRSE in the US during 2012, an estimated incidence rate
of �13/100,000 annually for SRSE in the US. Secondary analyses using stricter SRSE algorithms resulted
in estimated incidence rates of �11/100,000 and 8/100,000 annually. The mean LOS for SRSE hospital-
izations was 16.5 days (median ¼11; interquartile range [IQR] ¼ 6–20), and the mean ICU LOS was 9.3
days (median ¼6; IQR ¼3–12). The mean cost of an SRSE hospitalization was $51,247 (median ¼
$33,294; 95% CI ¼ $49,634–$52,861).
Limitations: The analysis uses ICD-9 diagnostic codes and claims information, and there are inherent
limitations in any methodology based on treatment protocol, which created challenges in distinguish-
ing with complete accuracy between SRSE, RSE, and SE on the basis of care patterns in the database.
Conclusion: SRSE is associated with high mortality and morbidity, which place a high burden on
healthcare resources. Projections based upon the findings of this study suggest an estimated
25,821–41,959 cases of SRSE may occur in the US each year, but more in-depth studies are required.

Introduction
Status epilepticus (SE) is an acute neurological medical emer-
gency associated, in its more severe forms, with significant
mortality and morbidity. SE is defined as a seizure lasting
more than 5 min or recurrent seizure activity without recov-
ery (returning to baseline) between seizures1–4. Primarily
treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), refractory SE (RSE) is
defined as seizures that continue despite the administration
of an initial benzodiazepine, followed by a second-line intra-
venous (IV) anti-epileptic drug (AED), such as phenytoin, fos-
phenytoin, levetiracetam, or valproate4,5. SE that persists for
24 h or more following onset of therapy with third-line
agents (e.g. propofol, high-dose midazolam, barbiturates) or
after the reduction or withdrawal of third-line agents is
defined as super-refractory SE (SRSE)6.
The patient population is highly heterogeneous. SRSE may
develop de novo, as a result of medication non-compliance,
tumors, substance abuse/overdose, or following severe brain
insult, such as infection, trauma, stroke, or autoimmune-
mediated inflammation6–10.
While there are guidelines for the evaluation and manage-
ment of SE4, the lack of randomized or controlled clinical tri-
als has hindered the development of definitive guidelines for
the treatment of SRSE11,12. In addition to anesthetics and
AEDs, there is a wide range of adjunctive treatments used to
manage SRSE in the ICU. These include ketamine, mild hypo-
thermia, ketogenic diet, pyridoxine infusions (pediatrics),
magnesium sulfate infusions, immunotherapy (including ste-
roids), and stiripentol6,7,12–16.
Previous reports estimate that SE affects from 12.5–61
people per 100,000 per year in the US, suggesting that the
annual number of SE cases in the US could be between
40,345–132,3221,3,17–21. Few studies have examined the inci-
dence for RSE and SRSE, and most of the studies that exist
have been focused on small populations in countries outside
the US9,10,22–25. Two US studies showed that 31–44% of
patients with SE progressed to RSE25,26. Shorvon and Ferlisi.12
estimated that �10–15% of SE cases become SRSE cases.
Several recent attempts have been made to study the inci-
dence of SRSE, with estimations ranging from 5–17% of SE

 cases becoming SRSE cases in small patient populations out-
side the US9,10,22. There is still a need for more comprehen-
sive analysis of the incidence of SE, RSE, and SRSE in the US
population. There is also little data regarding the healthcare
resource utilization of SRSE patients or the economic burden
of SRSE hospitalizations. The objectives of this study were to
estimate the annual incidence of SRSE cases in the US during
2012 and to assess associated costs and resource utilization
for SRSE patients.
Subjects/materials and methods
Study design
This was a cross-sectional study to identify and characterize
hospital discharges of SRSE patients during 2012.
Data source
This study used the Premier Hospital Database (referred to as
Premier Database). The Premier Database (Premier Healthcare
Alliance, Charlotte, NC) is a large US hospital, service-level,
all-payer, comparative database that represents real-world US
hospitalization patterns27. The Premier Database contains
information on �6 million annual hospital discharges (repre-
senting �20% of all US hospitalizations), primarily from non-
profit, non-governmental, community, and teaching hospitals,
and health systems. In 2012, the inpatient database included
a sample of �5.3 million discharges across 492 US hospitals.
In addition to the service-level data recorded in most stand-
ard hospital discharge files, the data source also contains a
daily log of all billed items at the individual patient level,
including procedures, medications, and laboratory tests, as
well as diagnostic and therapeutic services. In addition to
standard ICD9-CM procedures and diagnosis codes, this study
also leveraged Premier Database chargemaster codes refer-
encing ‘EEG’ services and mechanical ventilation.
Population
SRSE does not have a specific International Classification of
Diseases-9 (ICD-9) code, and SE codes are used inconsistently.
Therefore, the following algorithm was used to classify a dis-
charge as SRSE (Figure 1): each discharge was required to
have a seizure-related ICD-9 code (Table 1); an ICU stay of at
least 2 days; treatment with benzodiazepines or AEDs; con-
tinuous treatment with both IV AEDs (defined as IV anes-
thetics, IV barbiturates, and IV midazolam; Table 2) and
mechanical ventilation; and either or both treatment with
AEDs and benzodiazepines together or a definite SE ICD-9
diagnosis code (Table 1). Since patients were required to have
stayed at the ICU for at least 2 days, patients who died within
the first 48 hours were excluded from the cohort. Patients
under 18 years old were classified as pediatric patients.
Outcomes
The primary outcome for the study was the estimated num-
ber of annual SRSE cases based on discharges in the Premier
Database during 2012. Patients were characterized by health-
care resource utilization, comorbidity, and demographics.
The healthcare resource utilization outcomes were reported
for overall hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, epilepsy
and non-epilepsy medications, services during hospitalization,
discharge status, and total cost of each hospitalization. LOS,
services/treatments, and total cost of each hospitalization
were abstracted from the dataset directly as supplied by the
hospital. ICU LOS was defined as the number of days that
ICU room and board charge codes were present during
the hospitalization. Medication use was identified based on
pharmacy charges. Epilepsy medications included AEDs, ben-
zodiazepines, IV anesthetics, IV barbiturates, and IV benzodia-
zepines (Table 2). Non-epilepsy-specific medications included
anti-depressants, anti-infectives, anti-psychotics, bronchodila-
tors, muscle relaxants, narcotics, and vasopressors. Services
evaluated were electroencephalogram (EEG), mechanical ven-
tilator use, and tracheotomy. Discharge status indicated
whether the patient died in the hospital or was discharged
alive. The data did not show whether a patient was dis-
charged home or to another hospital, to long-term care, or
to a similar facility. Overall costs were defined as the total
cost for hospital treatment and included overhead and direct
costs. Costs were calculated based upon cost-to-charge ratios
and charges. Reimbursed costs were not available from this
dataset. Co-morbid conditions, as defined by ICD-9 codes,
were assessed to further characterize the patients.
Analysis
Results were reported for the overall, adult, and pediatric
populations. Descriptive statistics were calculated for out-
comes,

and
clinical
characteristics,

 therapies used. Projection weighting was carried out to esti-
mate the total number of annual hospitalizations of patients
classified as SRSE cases, as defined by our algorithm, in the
US. The projection was performed at the hospital level. Each
discharge was weighted to reflect region, ownership, teach-
ing status, size, and urban designation of hospitals in the
Premier
Hospital
Network,
based
on
national
American
Hospital Association data. For healthcare resource utilization
measures, means and medians were calculated for total hos-
pital LOS and ICU LOS. The proportion of patients utilizing
services, epilepsy medications, and other medications were
reported. Secondary analyses were conducted to estimate
the impact of using more restrictive SRSE algorithms. The first
sensitivity analysis evaluated the requirement of an ICU stay
of �3 days rather than �2 days; the other evaluated the
requirement of EEG codes during the hospitalization.
Results
Descriptive statistics
A total of 162,179 seizure-related discharges were identified
in the Premier Database, of which 6,325 were classified as
SRSE cases based on the primary algorithm (Figure 1). Adult
patients and pediatric patients accounted for 5,863 and 462,
respectively, of such discharges. The cases classified as SRSE
represented 4% of all ICD-9 codes for seizures in this data-
base. Of all seizure hospitalizations with a hospital LOS of �2
days, 1,291 of the patients died during the hospitalization
(Figure 1). Overall, 18% of the patients classified as SRSE
cases using the algorithm died during hospitalization; adult
mortality was 19%, and pediatric mortality was 5% (Table 3).
The mean ages of the adult and pediatric patients classified
as
having
SRSE
were
56.5
and
5.6
years,
respectively
(Table 3). Seventy per cent of these patients classified as
SRSE cases were treated in hospitals with >300 beds. The
most common co-morbid conditions were typical for ICU

National projection
Based on the 6,325 discharges in the Premier Database classi-
fied in our study as SRSE cases using the algorithm, it was
projected through weighting of these cases based on hos-
pital region, ownership, teaching status, size, and urban des-
ignation, and extrapolation using US demographics from
2012, that an estimated 41,156 cases of SRSE occurred in the
US during 2012. Of these 41,156 cases, a projected 38,717
(94%) were adults, and 2,439 (6%) were pediatric patients.
Based on these results, we further estimated that the total
upper limit of the SRSE incidence may be �13/100,000 per
year in the US.
The second analysis, in which we modified the SRSE defin-
ition by requiring an EEG or more days in the ICU, reduced
the estimated number of SRSE cases. Using a definition of
�3 days in the ICU, rather than �2 days, reduced the total
number of discharges classified as SRSE cases in the database
using the algorithm to 5,370. Using the weighting and US
demographics, this projected to an estimated 35,150 SRSE
cases nationally for 2012, or an incidence rate of 11/100,000
per year in the US. When the SRSE definition in the algorithm
included an EEG charge code, a total of 3,998 discharges
were classified as SRSE. Including EEG charge codes in the
algorithm
reduced
the
extrapolated
SRSE
projection
to
25,915 cases in 2012, or an incidence of 8/100,000 per year
in the US.
Healthcare resource utilization
The mean LOS for all patients classified as having SRSE in
this sample using the primary methodology was 16.5 days
(median ¼ 11; interquartile range [IQR] ¼ 6–20), with a mean
of 9.3 days (median ¼ 6; IQR ¼ 3–12) spent in an ICU (Table
4). The mean LOS was greater for pediatric patients com-
pared with adults: 20.0 days (median ¼12; IQR ¼5–26) vs
16.3 days (median ¼ 11; IQR ¼ 6–19; Table 4). The mean ICU
LOS was also longer for pediatric patients compared with
adults: 12.7 days (median ¼ 8; IQR ¼ 3–16) vs 9.0 days
(median ¼ 6; IQR ¼ 3–11; Table 4). The most common LOS
(32%) was 10–19 days (Figure 2).
The patients classified as SRSE received an average of five
different epilepsy medications, with many patients adminis-
tered multiple medications within each class (Table 5). The
use of AEDs, benzodiazepines and IV benzodiazepines, and IV
midazolam was high in both the adult and pediatric popula-
tions (Table 5). The use of IV anesthetics was slightly lower in
the pediatric population (57%) compared with the adult

 population (85%), while the use of IV barbiturates was higher
in the pediatric population (41%) compared with the adult
population (9%: Table 5).
Costs
The overall mean cost of hospitalization for a patient classi-
fied as having SRSE using the primary methodology was
$51,247 (95% CI ¼ $49,634–$52,861; Table 4). The mean costs
for pediatric and adult patients were $73,230 (95% CI ¼
$64,100–$82,359) and $49,515 (95% CI ¼ $47,938–$51,092),
respectively (Table 4). The mean cost per day was $3,400 for
treating adult patients, compared with $3,860 for treating
pediatric patients (Table 4). Among adults, Medicare was the
most frequent payer, accounting for 52% of discharges
(Table 3). Medicaid was the most common payer for children
(65%). Overall, commercial insurance paid for 18% of dis-
charges (Table 3).
Discussion
This is the largest study to date to examine the epidemiology
of SRSE using hospital discharge records from chargemaster
data and, as far as the authors are aware, the first study to
examine the economic impact of hospitalization in SRSE
cases. This study suggests that SRSE is associated with signifi-
cant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. The overall
mean cost of treating a patient classified as having SRSE
using the primary methodology was $51,247 (95% CI ¼
$49,634–$52,861), with a cost per day of $3,434. SRSE cases
had a mean LOS of 16.5 days (median ¼ 11; IQR ¼ 6–20)
and a mean ICU LOS of 9.3 days (median ¼ 6; IQR ¼ 3–12).
Projections based upon the findings of this study suggest
that between 25,915 and 41,156 cases of SRSE may occur in
the US each year.
Previous research has shown that the incidence of SE has
a bimodal age distribution, with the highest rates occurring
in children under 10 years old and adults over 50 years old3.
Jayalakshmi et al.9 observed a similar pattern among SRSE
patients. The current study also suggests that SRSE has a
bimodal age distribution (Figure 3). Although age has not
been found to be a significant risk factor for SRSE develop-
ment or mortality9, the common SRSE etiologies observed
in young children and adults (febrile SE/central nervous sys-
tem infection, and cerebrovascular and immune-mediated
disease,
respectively)7–9,28–30
may
explain
the
observed
distribution.
The primary aim of this paper is to provide an overall esti-
mation of the annual number of cases of SRSE in the US
population and to evaluate the hospital resources used in
caring for patients of all age ranges. Variations in the thera-
pies used between the adult and pediatric populations are
likely to be due to protocol differences. For example, propo-
fol is less frequently used in children because of the risk of
propofol infusion syndrome12.
The mean daily hospitalization costs for adult and pediat-
ric patients classified as having SRSE based on the primary
methodology were similar, at $3,400 and $3,860, respectively.
However, the mean cost per hospitalization for pediatric
patients was $73,230 (95% CI ¼ $69,100–$82,359) compared
with $49,515 (95% CI ¼ $47,938–$51,092) for adults. This dif-
ference in hospitalization cost appears to be related to the
increased LOS in children (20 days) compared with adults
(16.3 days). The impact that LOS had upon costs was also
seen in the overall population, with shorter stays being asso-
ciated with lower costs (Figure 2). Twenty-four per cent of all
patients spent �20 days in the hospital. The mean cost of
treating those with a LOS of 20–29 days was $73,300, while
the mean cost of treating those with a LOS of �30 days was
$156,500 (Figure 2).
There are more than 6,500 hospitals in the US, over 1,000
of which are tertiary hospitals31. Most patients classified in
the study as having SRSE based on the primary methodology
(70%) were treated in hospitals with >300 beds. Hospitals of
this size are typically tertiary centers, suggesting that SRSE is
usually managed in specialist care facilities.
Data on the prevalence of SE, RSE, and SRSE continue to
evolve. There are a range of estimates in the literature, but a

BURDEN OF ILLNESS FOR SUPER-REFRACTORY STATUS EPILEPTICUS
49
 lack of comprehensive studies of large patient populations.
Prevalence may vary country-to-country based on differences
in the rate of occurrence of the underlying conditions and
differences
in
accurate
diagnosis
rates
and
reporting.
Previous reports estimate that SE affects from 12.5–61 people
per 100,000 per year in the US. Globally, investigators have
estimated that 5–17% of SE cases become SRSE cases, sug-
gesting that SRSE may occur in up to 10 people per 100,000
per year in the US9,10,12,22. Using the primary methodology,
the current study estimates the annual incidence of SRSE in
the US to be 13/100,000 per year with a projected figure of
41,156 cases of annual US SRSE. These variations in estimates
of incidence may be explained by limitations of the method-
ology. For instance, as a consequence of our algorithm, some
patients with RSE may inadvertently have been included in
the SRSE group32. In fact, employing more stringent SRSE
definition criteria reduced the SRSE estimates. For example,
when �3 ICU days were required in applying the algorithm,
the estimated annual SRSE discharges in the US was reduced
by �15% to 35,150.
One of the major limitations of this study is the restricted
accuracy of the database’s EEG codes. In cases of SE, RSE,
and SRSE, continuous EEG should be initiated within 1 h of
SE onset if ongoing seizures are suspected4. In this database,
63% of discharges classified SRSE cases based on the algo-
rithm had EEG charge codes. Reasons for this may be that
some of the smaller hospitals may not have EEG capability or
that EEG codes were not recorded by the chargemaster data.
When an EEG code was used as part of the SRSE definition,
the patient population classified as SRSE cases was decreased
by �45%, which projected to 25,915 SRSE patients in 2012,
or an estimated incidence rate in the US of 8/100,000 per
year. This figure more closely aligns with literature-based esti-
mations that 5–17% of SE cases, which have been estimated
to occur in 12.5–61 cases/100,000 per year in the US, will
develop into SRSE cases9,10,12,22.
In this and previous studies, the validity of EEG charge
codes might be limited, since an EEG is a comparatively
inexpensive procedure and a more general code, or the
code that maximizes reimbursement may have been used
in preference to the most accurate code33. Furthermore,
while it has been demonstrated that providers in neur-
ology care often undercode33,34, adding EEG charges could
also lead to over-estimations. For example, patients admit-
ted with subarachnoid hemorrhage are monitored with
continuous EEG for up to 10 days for surveillance of focal
slowing, as a marker of the early development of focal
cerebral injury following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemor-
rhage35–37.
These
patients
are
more
often
mechanically
ventilated and administered anesthetics, as well as prophy-
lactic
anti-epileptic
medications.
They
would
only
be
excluded in our algorithm because of the absence of an
ICD-9 code for seizures.
Standardization to guide health-services researchers in
their case definitions would be ideal. For instance, some
authors have tried to standardize, or provide guidance to,
claims-based studies in epilepsy38–40. However, their case def-
initions do not specify SRSE. Once validated algorithms
become available, researchers could explore and compare
additional differences, such as particularities of databases,
demographics,
and
care characteristics.
For
SE patients,
step-wise, separate algorithms to identify SE, RSE, and SRSE
cases would be ideal41. In addition, validation against patient
charts would enhance the validity of our findings and pro-
vide the platform for subsequent studies.
SRSE has a high mortality rate, and patients who survive
are frequently left with some level of neurologic deficit after
the episode: only �30% of patients achieve satisfactory cog-
nitive outcomes12,42,43. Such levels of mortality and morbidity
place significant burdens upon healthcare resources and
demonstrate that SRSE remains an area of high unmet need.
The mortality rate of 18% observed in this study was lower
than the mortality rates of 35–62% reported by other stud-
ies12,42,43. However, the present study estimated the mortality
rate within a single hospitalization, whereas previous reports
for SRSE mortality have been for a given period of time, such
as 1 year42. Because the present study evaluated only SRSE
hospitalizations, any deaths that occurred after discharge
were not captured. Additionally, because our definition of
SRSE required patients to be in the ICU for at least 2 days,
anyone who died within the first day or who died before
hospitalization was excluded from this study.
Similarly, the mean LOS for patients in this inpatient hos-
pital database classified as SRSE cases based on the algo-
rithm
was
overall
shorter
than
what
is
expected
and
published for patients with SRSE. However, the duration of
stay might be influenced by many factors, including comor-
bidities, etiology, and discharge status. As outlined above, we
were not able to capture discharge status, and this may have
led to an important decrease in the mean LOS in our sample.
In other words, we were not able to differentiate between
patients
who
were
sent
home
vs
patients
who
were
transferred.
Second, the observed LOS using claims data might be sig-
nificantly different from the observed LOS in smaller cohort
studies at academic centers7–9,14. The recent literature sug-
gests that LOS have significant within-hospital and between-
hospital variance. This may be partially explained by the
various financial and political incentives that hospitals have
to discharge patients. As a result, we further believe that the
mean LOS for SRSE hospitalizations may have been under-
estimated, and that the true mean may have changed over
time, and should be stratified by discharge status.
Other studies have examined the economic burden associ-
ated with SE16,32,44. Using data from 1993–1994, Penberthy
et al.32 estimated the annual reimbursed cost in the US for
SE inpatient admissions at $4.0B, which is $6.2B after adjust-
ing for inflation. Based on the current study, if we assume
that there were 6,325 SRSE hospitalizations with an average
cost of $51,250, the total annual cost of SRSE hospitalizations
in 2012 would have been �$324 million. However, the over-
all financial impact of caring for patients with SRSE is likely
to be much higher than our estimate, since our results do
not include non-hospital care, such as community nursing,
social care, ambulances, and rehabilitation.
This study had several limitations, including that the data
source is based upon claims/chargemaster information (surro-
gate measures), which does not include definitive chart level
50
J. M. BEG ET AL.
 patient information. Although a robust data source, this
claims information is imperfect and difficult to validate.
Other limitations were the lack of specific diagnostic ICD-9
codes for RSE and SRSE and that management of these
patients varies between hospitals, units, and clinicians, thus
making it difficult to distinguish between SRSE, RSE, and SE
on the basis of care patterns. The definition of SRSE was
based upon a combination of ICU, LOS, medications, and
other available data. Information about when patients were
initiated and weaned from various epilepsy medications,
along with the reasons for medication changes, would have
allowed us to more accurately classify SRSE patients; how-
ever, this information was not available in the data source.
While a chart audit would have provided this treatment infor-
mation, it would not have included cost data and would by
necessity have been a much smaller and, therefore, less rep-
resentative, sample.
Another limitation of this study was that, while all patients
had seizures, the data did not indicate the reason for the
hospitalization. Defining SRSE patients as those who were
seen by a neurologist would have provided a more accurate
population
estimate.
However,
complete
data
regarding
physician type was unavailable. Benzodiazepine administra-
tion was not seen in 4% of patients. This may be due to
emergency or pre-hospitalization treatment with benzodiaze-
pines in an ambulance, which may not have been captured
in the inpatient database (Table 5).
Yet another limitation of the data set was the lack of even
more granular data, such as specific anesthetics doses used
and whether the patients received anesthetics for sedation
during mechanical ventilation and/or for treatment of SRSE.
Doses for sedation may vary according to multiple clinical
factors, such as weight, age, and other medications, as well
as unmeasured factors, such as prescriber experience. As
described by Walker41, when working with claims database
algorithms, the information resides in data patterns, rather
than data elements, which requires a fresh view of research.
The author makes the case that temporal sequence is crucial
and that any true indication is represented by a specific
sequence order41. Following this logic, we have with our
case-definition tried to follow a stepwise temporal sequence
to accurately identify cases of SRSE, starting with the basic
case definitions of SE, and adding temporal components to
differentiate RSE and SRSE17,39,45–51.
Previous studies have demonstrated varying degrees of
sensitivity, particularly those which independently surveyed
epilepsy prevalence via provider or a separate random sam-
ple of chart review17,33,39,45–51. In fact, there are no specific
ICD-9 codes for SRSE. We used seizure-related ICD-9 codes in
addition to other criteria to try to enhance the accuracy of
our case definition17,39,45–51. In epilepsy, validation studies of
medical claims databases suggest that accuracy may depend
on a variety of factors. A study of Medicaid using ICD codes
found that incidence of epilepsy could not be determined
before 3 years of enrollment due to claims trends46. In add-
ition, a comparison of ILAE disease classification and ICD
determined that there were significant variations between
these systems and versions, resulting in varying ICD validity
over time33. The sensitivity of combined algorithms (ICD-
9 þ EEG þ Medications) may be expected to be high, due to
payment incentives for coding52.
Patients who died or recovered during the first 48 h of
hospitalization were excluded from the analysis, which may
have impacted cost assessments. Based on time/treatment
selection criteria, these patients could not be identified as
having SRSE according to our definition. We would expect
these cases to be associated with comparatively low costs
and, thus, had they been incorporated into the dataset, the
overall mean cost might have been reduced.
Mortality rate in addition to incidence rate would be a
valuable measure to compare our findings with previous
studies using different observational datasets. However, our
mortality rate of 19% was derived after we excluded patients
who died during the first 48 h of admission. While these
patients could not be identified as having SRSE, most of
these patients would have met the criteria for RSE which
would fall within the published mortality rate range of
7–46%7,12,53.
Conclusion
This study suggests that SRSE is associated with high mortal-
ity and morbidity, and significant use of healthcare resources.
The mean cost of hospital care for a patient classified as hav-
ing SRSE using the primary methodology was $51,247.
Projections based on the number of cases classified as SRSE
using the algorithm suggest that US hospitals may treat
between 25,915–41,156 cases of SRSE annually. However,
more in-depth studies are needed to accurately determine
the prevalence of SRSE. Improved prevention and early
detection methods are needed for SRSE; these may improve
outcomes
and
decrease
healthcare
resource
utilization.
Further research into effective therapies specifically aimed at
treating SRSE could also help to reduce the societal and eco-
nomic impact of this condition.
