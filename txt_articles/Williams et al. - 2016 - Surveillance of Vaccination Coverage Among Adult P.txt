Abstract
Problem/Condition: Overall, the prevalence of illness attributable to vaccine-preventable diseases is greater among adults than 
among children. Adults are recommended to receive vaccinations based on their age, underlying medical conditions, lifestyle, 
prior vaccinations, and other considerations. Updated vaccination recommendations from CDC are published annually in the 
U.S. Adult Immunization Schedule. Despite longstanding recommendations for use of many vaccines, vaccination coverage 
among U.S. adults is low.
Reporting Period: August 2013–June 2014 (for influenza vaccination) and January–December 2014 (for pneumococcal, tetanus 
and diphtheria [Td] and tetanus and diphtheria with acellular pertussis [Tdap], hepatitis A, hepatitis B, herpes zoster, and human 
papillomavirus [HPV] vaccination).
Description of System: The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a continuous, cross-sectional national household survey 
of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population. In-person interviews are conducted throughout the year in a probability 
sample of households, and NHIS data are compiled and released annually. The survey objective is to monitor the health of the 
U.S. population and provide estimates of health indicators, health care use and access, and health-related behaviors.
Results: Compared with data from the 2013 NHIS, increases in vaccination coverage occurred for Tdap vaccine among adults 
aged ≥19 years (a 2.9 percentage point increase to 20.1%) and herpes zoster vaccine among adults aged ≥60 years (a 3.6 percentage 
point increase to 27.9%). Aside from these modest improvements, vaccination coverage among adults in 2014 was similar to 
estimates from 2013 (for influenza coverage, similar to the 2012–13 season). Influenza vaccination coverage among adults aged 
≥19 years was 43.2%. Pneumococcal vaccination coverage among high-risk persons aged 19–64 years was 20.3% and among 
adults aged ≥65 years was 61.3%. Td vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years was 62.2%. Hepatitis A vaccination 
coverage among adults aged ≥19 years was 9.0%. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years was 24.5%. 
HPV vaccination coverage among adults aged 19–26 years was 40.2% for females and 8.2% for males. Racial/ethnic differences 
in coverage persisted for all seven vaccines, with higher coverage generally for whites compared with most other groups. Adults 
without health insurance were significantly less likely than those with health insurance to report receipt of influenza vaccine (aged 
≥19 years), pneumococcal vaccine (aged 19–64 years with high-risk conditions and aged ≥65 years), Td vaccine (aged ≥19 years), 
Tdap vaccine (aged ≥19 years and 19–64 years), hepatitis A vaccine (aged ≥19 years overall and among travelers), hepatitis B vaccine 
(aged ≥19 years, 19–49 years, and 19–59 years with diabetes), 
herpes zoster vaccine (aged ≥60 years and 60–64 years), and 
HPV vaccine (females aged 19–26 years and males aged 
19–26 years). Adults who reported having a usual place for

health care generally were more likely to receive recommended vaccinations than those who did not have a usual place for health 
care, regardless of whether they had health insurance. Vaccination coverage was significantly higher among those reporting one 
or more physician contacts in the past year compared with those who had not visited a physician in the past year, regardless of 
whether they had health insurance. Even among adults who had health insurance and ≥10 physician contacts within the past year, 
23.8%–88.8% reported not having received vaccinations that were recommended either for all persons or for those with some 
specific indication. Overall, vaccination coverage among U.S.-born respondents was significantly higher than that of foreign-born 
respondents with few exceptions (influenza vaccination [adults aged 19–49 years], hepatitis A vaccination [adults aged ≥19 years], 
hepatitis B vaccination [adults with diabetes aged ≥60 years], and HPV vaccination [males aged 19–26 years]).
Interpretation: Overall, increases in adult vaccination coverage are needed. Although modest gains occurred in Tdap vaccination 
coverage among adults aged ≥19 years and herpes zoster vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥60 years, coverage for other 
vaccines and risk groups did not improve, and racial/ethnic disparities persisted for routinely recommended adult vaccines. 
Coverage for all vaccines for adults remained low, and missed opportunities to vaccinate adults continued. Although having health 
insurance coverage and a usual place for health care are associated with higher vaccination coverage, these factors alone do not 
assure optimal adult vaccination coverage.
Public Health Actions: Assessing associations with vaccination is important for understanding factors that contribute to low 
coverage rates and to disparities in vaccination, and for implementing strategies to improve vaccination coverage. Practices that have 
been demonstrated to improve vaccination coverage should be used. These practices include assessment of patients’ vaccination 
indications by health care providers and routine recommendation and offer of needed vaccines to adults, implementation of 
reminder-recall systems, use of standing-order programs for vaccination, and assessment of practice-level vaccination rates with 
feedback to staff members. For vaccination to be improved among those least likely to be up-to-date on recommended adult vaccines, 
efforts also are needed to identify adults who do not have a regular provider or insurance and who report fewer health care visits.
Introduction
Overall, the prevalence of illness attributable to vaccine-
preventable diseases is greater among adults aged ≥19 years 
than among children aged ≤12 years (1–4). The prevalence of 
illness among older persons is especially high. For example, in 
recent years, an estimated 50%–70% of the average 226,000 
annual influenza-related hospitalizations, 80%–90% of the 
3,000–49,000 influenza-related deaths (data available at http://
www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/65over.htm), and approximately 
half of the 13,500 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) 
in the United States occurred among persons aged ≥65 years 
(1–3). The lifetime risk for herpes zoster (also known as shingles) 
is approximately 30%, with the risk increasing with age (4). 
Vaccinations are recommended throughout a person’s lifetime to 
prevent vaccine-preventable diseases and their sequelae. However, 
adult vaccination coverage remains low for most routinely 
recommended vaccines (5) and below Healthy People 2020 targets 
(https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/
immunization-and-infectious-diseases/objectives).
Many factors contribute to low adult vaccination rates, 
including limited public awareness about adult vaccinations, 
misinformation about vaccines, lack of vaccine requirements 
for adults, gaps in incorporation of routine vaccine needs 
assessment and recommendations for adults during health care 
visits, the cost of stocking vaccines and providing vaccination 
services, inadequate and/or inconsistent payment for vaccines 
and vaccine administration, complexities in how adult 
vaccinations are paid for by private as well as public insurers, 
lack of health insurance and limited funding for programs 
to vaccinate uninsured adults, and acute medical care taking 
precedence over preventive services (6–14). In October 2015, 
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
approved the adult immunization schedule for 2016 (15). 
With the exception of influenza vaccination, which is 
recommended for all adults each year, other adult vaccinations 
are recommended for specific populations based on a person’s 
age, health conditions, behavioral risk factors (e.g., injection 
drug use), occupation, travel, and other indications (15).
This report represents the first comprehensive release of 
adult vaccination coverage data to include assessment of 
associations with expanded data on demographic characteristics 
of respondents including access to health care. These findings 
can be used by public health practitioners, adult vaccination 
providers, and the general public to better understand factors 
that contribute to low vaccination and modify strategies and 
interventions to improve vaccination coverage.
Methods
To assess vaccination coverage among adults aged ≥19 years 
for selected vaccines and factors associated with vaccination, 
CDC analyzed data from the 2014 National Health Interview 
Survey (NHIS); for influenza coverage, data from the 2013 
NHIS (August–December) also were used. This report

highlights results of that analysis for influenza, pneumococcal, 
tetanus toxoid-containing (tetanus and diphtheria vaccine 
[Td] or tetanus and diphtheria with acellular pertussis 
vaccine [Tdap]), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, herpes zoster 
(shingles), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines by 
selected demographic and access-to-care characteristics (e.g., 
age, race/ethnicity, vaccination indication, health insurance 
status, contacts with physicians, nativity and citizenship). 
Estimates of influenza vaccination coverage using 2014–15 
season data from other sources have been published (16–18). 
The attributes, strengths, and limitations of each of these data 
sources have been described (19). Proportions were estimated 
of adults aged ≥19 years who received selected vaccinations 
during 2010–2014. Additional information on NHIS methods 
is available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/methods.htm.
Data Source and Collection
NHIS collects information about the health and health care 
of the noninstitutionalized U.S. civilian population using 
nationally representative samples. Face-to-face interviews are 
conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for CDC’s National 
Center for Health Statistics. Questions about receipt of 
vaccinations recommended for adults are asked of one 
randomly selected adult within each family in the household. 
Respondents were asked if they had received an influenza 
shot or nasal spray in the past 12 months and if so, in which 
month and year. Respondents were asked if they had ever had a 
pneumonia shot. The proportion of pneumococcal vaccination 
by type of vaccine (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide 
vaccine or 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) was 
not measured. The presence of selected high-risk conditions 
as defined by ACIP for pneumococcal disease (Box) (15) was 
determined by responses to questions in NHIS. Respondents 
were asked if they had received a tetanus shot in the past 
10 years. Respondents who had received a tetanus shot in the 
past 10 years were asked if their most recent shot was received 
in 2005 or later. Respondents who had received a tetanus shot 
since 2005 were asked if they were told that their most recent 
tetanus shot included the pertussis or whooping cough vaccine. 
Respondents were asked if they had ever received the hepatitis A 
vaccine, and if yes, how many doses were received. Respondents 
were asked if they had ever received the hepatitis B vaccine, 
and if yes, whether they had received ≥3 doses or <3 doses. 
For hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination, data were collected 
on selected respondent characteristics that increase the risk for 
infection (travel to countries in which hepatitis A infections 
are endemic and having chronic liver disease, having diabetes, 
travel to countries in which hepatitis B infections are endemic, 
and having chronic liver disease, respectively). Respondents 
were asked if they had ever received a shingles vaccine and if 
they had ever received an HPV shot or cervical cancer vaccine, 
and if yes, age at the first dose.
Vaccination outcomes and demographic and other characteristics 
(e.g., health conditions, insurance status, and usual source and 
frequency of health care) are self-reported. Race/ethnicity was 
categorized as Hispanic or Latino, black, white, Asian, and 
“other.” Persons identified as Hispanic or Latino might be of any 
race. Persons identified as black, white, Asian, or other race are 
non-Hispanic. “Other” includes American Indian/Alaska Native 
and multiple race. The five racial/ethnic categories are mutually 
exclusive. Adults were classified as health care personnel (HCP) if 
they reported that they currently volunteer or work in a hospital, 
medical clinic, doctor’s office, dentist’s office, nursing home, or 
some other health care facility including part-time and unpaid 
work in a health care facility as well as professional nursing care 
provided in the home. Adults were considered insured if they 
reported having public health insurance coverage (Medicare, 
Medicaid, military health care [TRICARE/VA/CHAMP-VA], 
Indian Health Service, state-sponsored health plan, or other 
government program insurance) or private health insurance 
coverage. Respondents were asked if there is a place to which they 
usually go when sick or need advice on their health. Respondents 
answering “yes” were defined as having a usual place for health care.
BOX. Selected high-risk conditions for pneumococcal disease as 
defined by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
Adults were considered at high risk for pneumococcal 
disease or its complications if they
• had ever been told by a doctor or other health 
professional that they had diabetes, emphysema, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart 
disease, angina, heart attack, or other heart condition;
• had a diagnosis of cancer during the previous 
12 months (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer);
• had ever been told by a doctor or other health 
professional that they had lymphoma, leukemia, or 
blood cancer;
• had been told by a doctor or other health professional 
that they had chronic bronchitis or weak or failing 
kidneys during the preceding 12 months;
• had an asthma episode or attack during the preceding 
12 months; or
• were current smokers.

Analysis
For the noninfluenza adult vaccination coverage estimates, 
the weighted proportion of respondents who reported receiving 
selected vaccinations was calculated. To better assess influenza 
vaccination coverage for the 2013–14 influenza season, CDC 
restricted reported coverage to persons who were interviewed 
during August 2013–June 2014 and vaccinated during 
July 2013–May 2014, using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis 
procedure; 2013 NHIS data for August–December 2013 
were used. Differences were measured as the simple difference 
between the 2012–13 and 2013–14 influenza seasons. Data 
for missing month and year (3.1%) were imputed.
To assess adjusted vaccination coverage and adjusted 
prevalence ratios for each vaccine, CDC used logistic regression 
and predicted marginal modeling for selected comparisons 
(health insurance status). Estimates were adjusted for age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, marital status, education, employment status, 
poverty level, number of physician contacts in the past year, 
usual source of health care, self-reported health status, nativity, 
and region of residence. Income-to-poverty ratio variables 
are included in the NHIS public use data file (http://www.
cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/nhis_2014_data_release.htm). Poverty 
thresholds were defined according to family size using weighted 
average Census poverty thresholds from 2012, the average 
Consumer Price Index from 2012, actual Consumer Price 
Index values for January-July 2013, and projected Consumer 
Price Index values for August–December 2013 (ftp://ftp.cdc.
gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/
NHIS/2014/srvydesc.pd).
Weighted data were used to produce national vaccination 
coverage estimates. Point estimates and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were calculated by using statistical software 
to account for the complex sample design. T tests were used 
for comparisons by race/ethnicity (with non-Hispanic white 
as the reference), for comparisons between 2014 and 2013, 
and comparisons of covariates to the reference group within 
each level of each characteristic (e.g., age group, health care 
personnel status, patient care status, access-to-care factors, 
nativity, years of residence in the United States, and citizenship 
status). For influenza vaccination, tests for linear trend were 
performed using a weighted linear regression on the season-
specific estimates, using season number as the independent 
variable and weights as the inverse of the estimated variance 
of the estimated vaccination coverage. For vaccination with 
the other vaccines, tests for linear trend were performed in 
SUDAAN using the RATIO procedure. Statistical significance 
was defined as p<0.05. Coverage estimates are not reported for 
small sample size (n<30) or relative standard error (standard 
error/estimates) >0.3.
Results
The final sample adult component response rate for the 2014 
NHIS was 58.9%. The total adult sample was 36,324 persons 
aged ≥19 years. The final sample adult component response 
rates for estimating influenza vaccination coverage for the 
2013–14 influenza season were 61.2% for 2013 and 58.9% 
for 2014, respectively. The total adult sample for influenza 
coverage estimation was 32,296 persons aged ≥19 years.
Influenza Vaccination Coverage
Influenza vaccination coverage for the 2013–14 season 
among adults aged ≥19 years was 43.2%, similar to the NHIS 
estimate from the 2012–13 season (Table 1). Coverage among 
whites aged ≥19 years was higher (46.7%) than that for blacks 
(36.5%), Hispanics (33.2%) and those reporting other race 
(38.6%). Influenza coverage was 31.5% among adults aged 
19–49 years and 47.7% among adults aged 50–64 years. 
Coverage among adults aged ≥65 years (71.5%) was higher 
compared with younger age groups. Among HCP aged 
≥19 years, influenza vaccination coverage overall was 65.4%, 
similar to the estimate for 2013 (Table 2). Among HCP aged 
≥19 years with and without direct patient care responsibilities, 
influenza vaccination coverage was 65.1% and 66.0%, 
respectively, similar to 2013 estimates (Table 3). Coverage was 
74.8% for Hispanic HCP aged ≥19 years with direct patient 
care responsibilities, a 20.8 percentage point increase compared 
with the 2013 estimate. However, influenza vaccination 
coverage among HCP with direct patient care responsibilities 
was similar across all racial/ethnic groups (Table 3). During 
the 2009–10 through the 2013–14 influenza seasons, fewer 
than half of adults aged ≥19 years were vaccinated (range: 
37.2%–43.2%) (Figures 1 and 2); 56.6%–67.3% of HCP 
reported influenza vaccination (Figure 2).
Pneumococcal Vaccination Coverage
Reported pneumococcal vaccination coverage (23-valent 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine [PPSV23] and 13-valent 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13]) among adults 
aged 19–64 years at high risk was 20.3% overall, similar to 
the estimate from 2013 (Table 1). Coverage among whites 
aged 19–64 years at high risk was higher (21.1%) compared 
with Hispanics (16.4%) and Asians (14.6%) but was not 
significantly different for blacks (20.2%) and persons reporting 
other race (25.3%) compared with whites. Among adults aged 
≥65 years, coverage was 61.3% overall, similar to the estimate 
for 2013. Coverage among whites aged ≥65 years (64.7%) was 
higher compared with blacks (49.8%), Hispanics (45.2%), and 
Asians (47.7%) (Table 1). During 2010–2014, pneumococcal

vaccination coverage among adults aged 19–64 years at high 
risk and adults aged ≥65 years ranged from 18.5%–21.2% to 
59.7%–62.3%, respectively (Figures 1 and 2).
Tetanus Vaccination Coverage
In 2014, the proportion of adults reporting having received 
any tetanus toxoid-containing vaccination during the 
past 10 years was 62.2% overall for adults aged ≥19 years, 
62.6% for adults aged 19–49 years, 64.7% for adults aged 
50–64 years, and 57.7% for adults aged ≥65 years (Table 1). 
The proportion of adults receiving tetanus vaccination during 
the past 10 years across all age groups did not change compared 
with 2013. Whites had higher coverage across all age groups 
compared with blacks, Hispanics, and Asians. During 2010–
2014, tetanus vaccination among adults aged ≥19 years was 
unchanged at approximately 62% (Figures 1 and 3).
Among adults aged ≥19 years for whom Tdap vaccination 
specifically could be assessed, overall reported coverage in 
the past 9 years was 20.1%, a 2.9 percentage point increase 
compared with 2013 (Table 1). Tdap coverage for black 
(11.6%), Hispanic (12.4%), and Asian (15.5%) adults aged 
≥19 years was lower compared with whites (23.8%). Coverage 
among adults aged ≥19 years who reported living with an infant

* Influenza vaccination coverage for 2010 is coverage from the 2009–10 season, 2011 is coverage from the 2010–11 season, 2012 is coverage from the 2011–12 season, 
2013 is coverage from the 2012–13 season, and 2014 is coverage from the 2013–14 season. Interviews from August through June of each season were used to 
estimate coverage from July through May using Kaplan Meier survival analysis.  Tdap vaccination coverage data among adults aged ≥65 years are available beginning 
in the NHIS 2012 survey.  The 2010 HPV vaccination coverage estimate among males is suppressed due to relative standard error >30%.
† Adults were considered at high risk for pneumococcal disease if they had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had diabetes, emphysema, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (beginning in 2012), coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack, or other heart condition; had a diagnosis of cancer during 
the previous 12 months (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer); had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had lymphoma, leukemia, or

* Adults were classified as health care personnel if they reported they currently volunteer or work in a hospital, medical clinic, doctor’s office, dentist’s office, nursing 
home or some other health-care facility including part-time and unpaid work in a health care facility as well as professional nursing care provided in the home.
† Influenza vaccination coverage for 2010 is coverage from the 2009–10 season, 2011 is coverage from the 2010–11 season, 2012 is coverage from the 2011–12 season, 
2013 is coverage from the 2012–13 season, and 2014 is coverage from the 2013–14 season. Interviews from August through June of each season were used to 
estimate coverage from July through May using Kaplan Meier survival analysis. 
§ Adults were considered at high risk for pneumococcal disease if they had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had diabetes, emphysema, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (beginning in 2012), coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack, or other heart condition; had a diagnosis of cancer during 
the previous 12 months (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer); had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had lymphoma, leukemia, or 
blood cancer; had been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had chronic bronchitis or weak or failing kidneys during the preceding 12 months; 
had an asthma episode or attack during the preceding 12 months; or were current smokers. 
* In 2006, a single dose of Tdap was recommended for adults who have or who 
anticipate having close contact with an infant aged <1 year (e.g., parents, 
grandparents, child care providers, and health care personnel) to reduce the 
risk for transmitting pertussis.

had lower Tdap coverage (28.9%) compared with white HCP 
(52.4%), but coverage for HCP in the other racial/ethnic 
groups was similar to that for white HCP (Table 3). Tdap 
vaccination among HCP aged 19–64 years increased from 
22.0% in 2010 to 43.0% in 2014. Tdap vaccination among 
HCP aged ≥65 years reported during 2012–2014 ranged from 
16.9% to 30.7% (Figure 3). Among adults aged ≥19 years who 
received a tetanus vaccination and reported that they knew 
what type of tetanus vaccine they received, HCP were more 
likely to report receipt of Tdap (80.6%) than were non-HCP 
(68.0%) (Table 4).
Hepatitis A Vaccination Coverage
In 2014, reported hepatitis A vaccination coverage (≥2 doses) 
was 9.0% for adults aged ≥19 years, 12.1% among adults aged 
19–49 years, and 5.5% among adults aged ≥50 years, similar to 
the estimates for 2013 (Table 1). Among adults aged 19–49 years, 
coverage for Hispanics (9.6%) was lower than that for whites 
(12.7%). Vaccination coverage was higher among adults aged 
≥19 years who had traveled outside the United States since 1995 
to a country in which hepatitis A is of high or intermediate 
endemicity (countries other than the countries of Europe, Japan, 
Australia, New Zealand, or Canada) than among respondents 
who did not travel outside the United States or had traveled only 
to countries in which the disease is of low endemicity (16.0% 
versus 5.5%, respectively). Vaccination coverage among adult 
travelers to countries with high or intermediate endemicity was 
similar to the estimate for 2013 (Table 1). Overall coverage 
among adults aged ≥19 years with chronic liver conditions 
was 13.8%, similar to the 2013 estimate. During 2010–2014 
among adults aged ≥19 years, hepatitis A vaccination among 
travelers to countries with high or intermediate endemicity, 
among nontravelers, and among persons with chronic liver 
conditions remained stable (range: 14.6%–16.2%, 5.1%–5.7%, 
and 13.1%–14.9%, respectively) (Figure 4).

Hepatitis B Vaccination Coverage
Reported hepatitis B vaccination coverage (≥3 doses) 
among adults was 24.5% for adults aged ≥19 years, 32.2% 
among adults aged 19–49 years, and 15.7% among adults 
aged ≥50 years. Overall vaccination coverage among adults 
aged ≥19 years was similar to the 2013 estimate (Table 1). 
Vaccination coverage was higher among adults aged ≥19 years 
who had traveled outside the United States since 1995 to 
a country in which hepatitis B is of high or intermediate 
endemicity (countries other than the countries of Europe, 
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, or Canada) than among 
respondents who did not travel outside the United States 
or had traveled only to countries in which hepatitis B is 
of low endemicity (30.5% versus 21.4%, respectively). 
Among adults aged 19–49 years, vaccination coverage was 
lower for blacks (29.9%) and Hispanics (20.2%) compared 
with whites (36.3%). Overall coverage among adults aged 
≥19 years with chronic liver conditions was 29.8%, similar 
to the 2013 estimate. Vaccination coverage for persons with 
diabetes was 23.5% for those aged 19–59 years and 13.5% for 
those aged ≥60 years, similar to estimates for 2013. Overall, 
hepatitis B vaccination coverage among HCP aged ≥19 years 
was 60.7%, similar to the estimate for 2013. Black (51.4%) 
and Hispanic HCP (51.1%) had lower coverage compared 
with white HCP (63.0%) (Table 2). Among HCP aged 
≥19 years with direct patient care responsibilities, hepatitis B 
vaccination coverage was 67.7%, similar to the 2013 estimate 
(Table 3). Coverage for black HCP aged ≥19 years with direct 
patient care responsibilities was lower (56.6%) than that for 
white HCP with direct patient care responsibilities (70.9%) 
(Table 3). During 2010–2014, among adults aged ≥19 years,

35.0%, 20.9%–23.2%, 29.8%–38.5%, and 60.7%–65.0%, 
respectively (Figure 4).
Herpes Zoster Vaccination Coverage
In 2014, among adults aged ≥60 years, 27.9% reported 
receiving herpes zoster vaccination to prevent shingles, an 
increase from the 24.2% reported in 2013 (Table 1). Whites 
aged ≥60 years had higher herpes zoster vaccination coverage 
(32.0%) compared with blacks (11.6%), Hispanics (14.6%), 
Asians (16.5%), and those reporting other race (16.2%). 
Among adults aged 60–64 years, 20.4% reported receiving 
herpes zoster vaccination, with blacks (8.1%) and Hispanics 
(11.2%) reporting lower coverage compared with that for 
whites (24.3%) (Table 1). Estimates were similar to those for 
2013. Among adults aged ≥65 years, 31.1% reported herpes 
zoster vaccination, a 4.3 percentage point increase compared 
with 2013. Whites aged ≥65 years had higher herpes zoster 
vaccination coverage (35.0%) compared with blacks (13.5%), 
Hispanics (16.3%), Asians (20.7%), and those reporting other 
race (19.6%) (Table 1). Herpes zoster vaccination among adults 
aged ≥60 years increased from 14.4% in 2010 to 27.9% in 
2014 (Figures 1 and 5).
HPV Vaccination Coverage
In 2014, among women aged 19–26 years, 40.2% reported 
receipt of ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine, similar to the estimate 
reported for 2013 (Table 1). Coverage was 44.8% among 
women aged 19–21 years, similar to the 2013 estimate. 
Coverage was 37.6% among those aged 22–26 years, a 
5.3 percentage point increase compared with the 2013 
estimate. Among women aged 19–26 years, Hispanics 
(28.1%) and Asians (22.8%) had lower coverage compared 
with whites (46.3%), but coverage for blacks (37.4%) and 
adults who indicated other race (47.3%) was similar to that for 
whites. Receipt of ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine among males aged 
19–26 years was 8.2%, similar to the 2013 estimate. Coverage 
was 13.3% for males aged 19–21 years, a 5.6 percentage point 
increase compared with the estimate from 2013. Coverage was 
5.4% for those aged 22–26 years, similar to the 2013 estimate.
Among women aged 19–26 years, 2.1% reported receiving 
the first dose of HPV vaccine at age 8–10 years, 7.4% at age 
11–12 years, 58.1% at age 13–17 years, 12.5% at age 18 years, 
and 19.9% at age 19–26 years (Table 5). Among males aged 
19–26 years, 13.0% reported receiving the first dose of HPV 
vaccine at age 8–10 years, 3.5% at age 11–12 years, 33.1% 
at age 13–17 years, 24.4% at age 18 years, and 25.9% at

age 19–26 years. Among respondents aged 19–26 years, the 
difference between the age reported at the time of the interview 
and the age at which respondents indicated that the first 
dose of HPV vaccine was received was ≥10 years for 7.1% of 
women and for 13.8% of males. This would imply receipt of 
vaccination in 2004 or earlier, before HPV vaccine was licensed 
for use in 2006. Among females and males aged 19–26 years 
who had not received HPV prior to age 19 years, 11.8% and 
2.3% reported receiving the first dose of HPV vaccine at age 
19–26 years, respectively (Table 1). Fewer Hispanic females 
aged 19–26 years (7.4%) reported receiving the first dose 
of HPV vaccine at age 19–26 years compared with white 
females aged 19–26 years (13.9%) (Table 1). HPV vaccination 
increased from 20.7% in 2010 to 40.2% in 2014 for females 
aged 19–26 years, and from 2.1% in 2011 to 8.2% in 2014 
among males aged 19–26 years (Figures 1 and 5).
Trends in Adult Vaccination Coverage
Estimated proportions of adults aged ≥19 years who received 
selected vaccinations during the period 2010–2014 are shown 
(Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). Although the point estimates for 
each year vary by only a few percentage points, linear trend 
tests indicated that influenza vaccination coverage significantly 
increased overall among persons aged ≥19 years from the 
2009–10 influenza season to the 2013–14 season (test for 
trend: p = 0.01) (Figures 1 and 2). Influenza vaccination 
coverage did not increase significantly among HCP during 
this period (test for trend: p = 0.17) (Figure 2). During 
2010–2014, pneumococcal vaccination coverage increased 
significantly only among high-risk persons aged 19–64 years 
(test for trend: p = 0.01) (Figures 1 and 2). During 2010–2014, 
significant increases also occurred for Tdap vaccination overall 
among persons aged ≥19 years (test for trend: p< 0.01) and 
among HCP aged 19–64 years and those aged ≥65 years 
(tests for trend: p< 0.01 and 0.03, respectively), herpes zoster 
vaccination of persons aged ≥60 years (test for trend, p< 0.01), 
and HPV vaccination of females and males aged 19–26 years 
(test for trend, p< 0.01) (Figures 1, 3, and 5). There was a 
significant downward trend for hepatitis B vaccination among 
travelers to countries with high or intermediate endemicity 
and for nontravelers (test for trend: p< 0.01) (Figure 4). 
Coverage did not show statistically significant changes during 
2010–2014 for the other vaccines routinely recommended 
for adult populations (pneumococcal vaccination [persons 
aged ≥65 years] and overall tetanus vaccination [persons aged 
≥19 years]) (tests for trend: p>0.05) (Figure 1).
Association of Health Insurance Status 
with Vaccination Coverage  
Among Adult Populations
Most study respondents (86.7%) indicated having some type 
of health insurance. Overall, vaccination coverage was lower 
among adults without health insurance compared with those 
with health insurance, except for overall hepatitis B vaccination 
among those aged ≥19 years with chronic liver conditions or 
diabetes (Table 6). For influenza, pneumococcal, Tdap, herpes 
zoster, and HPV vaccination, coverage was two to five times 
higher among those with health insurance compared with those 
without insurance (Table 6).
Adult vaccination coverage differed by the type of health 
insurance. Vaccination coverage was higher among adults 
with private health insurance compared with those reporting 
public health insurance for pneumococcal vaccination among 
adults aged ≥65 years, tetanus and Tdap vaccination (all ages), 
overall hepatitis A vaccination among adults aged ≥19 years, 
hepatitis B vaccination among adults aged ≥19 years overall and 
those with diabetes aged ≥19 years and ≥60 years, and herpes 
zoster vaccination among adults aged ≥60 years (Table 6). 
Vaccination coverage was significantly lower among adults 
with private insurance compared with those with public 
insurance for overall influenza vaccination among adults aged 
≥19 years and for pneumococcal vaccination among adults aged 
19–64 years with high-risk conditions (Table 6).
Association of Health Insurance Status and 
Having a Usual Place for Health Care  
with Vaccination Coverage
Generally, adults with a usual place for health care were more 
likely to report having received recommended vaccinations 
than those who did not have a usual place for health care, 
regardless of whether they had health insurance. Among 
adults with health insurance, coverage was significantly higher 
among those who reported having a usual place for health 
care compared with those who did not have a usual place for 
health care except for hepatitis A vaccination and hepatitis B 
vaccination (Table 7). Among adults without health insurance, 
coverage was significantly higher among adults who had a 
usual place for health care compared with those who did not 
for influenza vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination among 
adults aged 19–64 years with high-risk conditions, and overall 
tetanus vaccination among adults aged ≥19 years (Table 7).

Adult Vaccination Coverage by Health 
Insurance Status and Physician Contacts
With a few exceptions (overall hepatitis A vaccination among 
adults aged ≥19 years and HPV vaccination among women 
aged 19–26 years), vaccination coverage was significantly 
higher among those reporting having had one or more 
physician contacts in the past year compared with those 
who had not visited a physician in the past year, regardless 
of whether they had health insurance (Table 8). In addition, 
vaccination coverage generally increased as the number of 
physician contacts increased (Table 8).
Among adults who had health insurance and reported having 
had ≥10 physician contacts within the past year, 23.8%–88.8% 
reported not receiving vaccinations that either are recommended 
for all persons or are recommended for those with some specific 
indication (not receiving influenza vaccination, 39.4% [aged 
≥19 years], 51.4% [aged 19–49 years], 38.3% [aged 50–64 years], 
23.8% [aged ≥65 years]; not receiving pneumococcal vaccination, 
61.4% [high-risk, aged 19–64 years], 29.3% [aged ≥65 years]; 
not receiving Td, 30.1% [aged ≥19 years]; not receiving Tdap, 
68.7% [aged 19–64 years], 83.9% [aged ≥65 years]; hepatitis A, 
82.4% [travelers aged ≥19 years], 82.0% [persons aged ≥19 years 
with chronic liver conditions]; hepatitis B, 62.9% [travelers aged 
≥19 years], 67.1% [persons aged ≥19 years with chronic liver 
conditions], 64.7% [adults aged 19–59 with diabetes], 88.8% 
[adults aged ≥60 years with diabetes]; herpes zoster, 67.7%; and 
HPV, 51.6% [women aged 19–26 years]) (Table 8).
Association of Respondent Age with  
Adult Vaccination Coverage
Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination coverage among 
adults aged ≥65 years was higher compared with coverage 
among adults aged 19–64 years; however, Td and Tdap 
coverage among adults aged ≥65 years was lower compared with 
coverage among adults aged <65 years. Hepatitis B vaccination 
coverage among adults with diabetes aged ≥60 years was lower 
compared with coverage among adults aged 19–59 years with 
diabetes (Tables 6, 7, and 8). Herpes zoster coverage among 
adults aged ≥65 years was higher compared with coverage 
among adults aged 60–64 years (Table 6).
Adult Vaccination Coverage Adjusted for 
Selected Demographic and  
Access to Care Characteristics
Adults without health insurance were significantly less 
likely than those with health insurance to be vaccinated after 
adjusting for confounders for influenza (aged ≥19 years); 
pneumococcal (aged 19–64 years with high-risk conditions); 
hepatitis B (aged ≥19 years and 19–49 years); herpes zoster 
(aged ≥60 years), and HPV (females aged 19–26 years) 
vaccination (Table 9). The difference in adjusted vaccination 
coverage between respondents with and without health 
insurance for those for whom the difference was statistically 
significant ranged from 2.9% (hepatitis B vaccination among 
adults aged ≥19 years) to 13.3% (influenza vaccination among 
adults aged ≥19 years) (Table 9).
Adult Vaccination Coverage by Nativity, 
Years Living in the United States,  
and Citizenship
Overall, vaccination coverage among U.S.-born respondents 
was significantly higher than that of foreign-born respondents 
with few exceptions (Table 10). Exceptions were noted for 
influenza vaccination (adults aged 19–49 years), overall 
hepatitis A vaccination (adults aged ≥19 years), hepatitis B 
vaccination among adults with diabetes aged ≥19 years and 
those aged ≥60 years, and HPV vaccination of males aged 
19–26 years. Vaccination coverage was higher for foreign-
born persons living in the United States ≥10 years compared 
with those in the United States <10 years for influenza 
vaccination (overall for persons aged ≥19 years and adults 
aged ≥65 years). Vaccination coverage was significantly lower 
for foreign-born persons living in the United States ≥10 years 
compared with those living in the United States <10 years for 
hepatitis A vaccination (adults aged ≥19 years overall), and 
hepatitis B vaccination (among adults ≥19 years overall and 
those aged ≥19 years with diabetes). Except for pneumococcal 
vaccination of adults aged ≥65 years, Td vaccination of 
adults aged ≥65 years, hepatitis A vaccination, hepatitis B 
vaccination among adults with diabetes aged ≥19 years, and 
HPV vaccination among females aged 19–26 years, coverage 
among foreign-born adults who were U.S. citizens was higher 
than that for foreign-born respondents who were not U.S. 
citizens (Table 10).
Discussion
In 2014, adult vaccination coverage in the United States 
did not improve from 2013, except for modest increases in 
Tdap vaccination for adults aged ≥19 years and herpes zoster 
vaccination among adults ≥60 years. Vaccination coverage 
estimates for the four vaccines in this report that are included 
in Healthy People 2020 (influenza, pneumococcal, herpes zoster, 
and hepatitis B [for HCP] vaccines) are below the respective 
target levels, including among insured adults and adults with 
 Surveillance Summaries

multiple health care visits in the past year. Racial/ethnic gaps 
in coverage persisted for all seven vaccines in this report and 
widened for Tdap and herpes zoster vaccination, with higher 
coverage generally for whites compared with most other 
groups. These data indicate multiple missed opportunities 
for vaccination and the need to increase routine assessment of 
adult vaccination needs, and vaccination with needed vaccines.
Influenza Vaccination
Since 2010, ACIP has recommended that all persons 
aged ≥6 months be vaccinated annually against influenza to 
prevent illness and related complications (20). Fewer than 
half of adults aged ≥19 years were vaccinated during the 
influenza seasons spanning the 2009–10 through 2013–14 
seasons. Higher vaccination rates could have resulted in 
prevention of a substantial greater number of influenza cases 
and hospitalizations. For example, using a model published 
in 2013 (21), CDC estimated the amount of influenza-
associated outcomes during the 2012–13 influenza season, a 
moderately severe season, that might have been prevented by 
influenza vaccination (22). For the 2013–14 influenza season, 
using updated estimates of vaccination coverage, vaccine 
effectiveness, and influenza hospitalizations, CDC estimates 
that influenza vaccination prevented approximately 7.2 million 
illnesses, 3.1 million medically attended illnesses, and 90,000 
hospitalizations associated with influenza (23). If influenza 
vaccination levels had reached the Healthy People 2020 target of 
70%, an estimated additional 5.9 million illnesses, 2.3 million 
medically attended illnesses, and 42,000 hospitalizations 
associated with influenza might have been averted. For the 
U.S. population to benefit more fully from influenza vaccines, 
more effort is needed to reach the Healthy People 2020 target. 
Ensuring that all persons who visit a health care provider during 
the influenza season receive a vaccination recommendation and 
offer from their provider and use of vaccination information 
systems could increase influenza vaccination rates and reduce 
the incidence of illness (24,25).
HCP are recommended for routine annual influenza 
vaccination (20,26). Preventing influenza among HCP 
who might serve as sources of influenza virus transmission 
provides additional protection to patients at risk for influenza 
complications. Although annual vaccination has long been 
recommended for HCP and is a high priority for reducing 
morbidity associated with influenza in health care settings 
(27–29), influenza vaccination coverage level among HCP 
aged ≥19 years during the 2013–14 season was 65.4% 
overall and 65.1% among those with direct patient care 
responsibilities. Higher HCP influenza vaccination coverage 
has been associated with employer requirements for vaccination 
and access to vaccination at the workplace at no cost for 
>1 day (17,30). Although less effective than workplace on-site 
vaccination, active employer promotion of influenza vaccine 
through such methods as incentives and personal reminders 
also has been associated with higher coverage compared with 
HCP whose employers did not implement any policies or 
activities related to influenza vaccination (17). These results 
indicate that a comprehensive strategy that includes easy 
access to vaccination at no cost on multiple days along with 
promotion of vaccination might increase HCP vaccination 
coverage. Employers and health care administrators can make 
use of the Guide to Community Preventive Services (24), 
which provides guidance on effective interventions to increase 
uptake of influenza vaccination among HCP
.
Pneumococcal Vaccination
In August 2014, ACIP recommended routine use of 
PCV13 among adults aged ≥65 years (31). PCV13 should be 
administered in series with PPSV23, the vaccine recommended 
for adults aged ≥65 years since 1983. PPSV23 contains 
12 serotypes in common with PCV13 and 11 additional 
serotypes. PCV13 vaccine reduces the risk for pneumococcal 
pneumonia and both PCV13 and PPSV23 have been 
demonstrated to reduce the risk for invasive pneumococcal 
infections (31,32). Because of the high proportion of invasive 
pneumococcal disease caused by serotypes unique to PPSV23, 
broader protection is expected to be provided through use 
of both PCV13 and PPSV23 in series. Adults who have 
already received PPSV23 and are recommended to receive 
PCV13 should receive PCV13 at least 1 year after PPSV23 
vaccine. The survey data from 2014 NHIS could not be used 
to estimate the proportion of pneumococcal vaccinations by 
type (PCV13 versus PPSV23). The overall pneumococcal 
vaccination estimates in this report include respondents who 
might have received PCV13 and/or PPSV23. Pneumococcal 
vaccination of persons aged 19–64 years at high risk increased 
during the 5 years covered in this report but was unchanged 
among those aged ≥65 years, and both were well below Healthy 
People 2020 targets of 60% for persons aged 18–64 years at high 
risk and 90% for adults aged ≥65 years. Among persons aged 
≥65 years, using PCV13 in series with PPSV23 could prevent 
an estimated 230 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease 
and approximately 12,000 cases of community-acquired 
pneumonia over the lifetime of a single cohort of persons aged 
65 years (31). Achieving higher pneumococcal vaccination 
levels could improve these benefits.

Tetanus Toxoid-Containing Vaccination
In 2012, ACIP updated the adult Tdap vaccination 
recommendation to include all adults aged ≥19 years who 
have not yet received a dose of Tdap, including those aged 
≥65 years (33). Tdap, when indicated, should be administered 
regardless of interval since the most recent Td. A single dose 
of Tdap is particularly important for adults who have or who 
anticipate having close contact with an infant aged <1 year 
(e.g., parents, grandparents, child care providers, and health 
care personnel) to reduce the risk for transmitting pertussis to 
infants too young to be vaccinated who are at greatest risk for 
severe pertussis, including hospitalization and death. Although 
there were modest increases in Tdap vaccination of adults from 
2010 to 2014, coverage has remained low for all age groups 
and among adults living with an infant aged <1 year.
In hospital settings, transmission of pertussis has occurred 
from hospital visitors to patients, from HCP to patients, and 
from patients to HCP (34–37). Vaccinating HCP with Tdap 
will help protect them against pertussis and might reduce 
transmission to patients, other HCP
, household members, 
and persons in the community (26,38). Health care providers 
should not miss an opportunity to vaccinate adults aged 
≥19 years who have not received Tdap previously.
Hepatitis A Vaccination
Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for any person 
seeking protection from hepatitis A virus infection, if some 
risk factor is present (e.g., on the basis of lifestyle, occupation, 
medical, or other indication), and for persons traveling to or 
working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity 
of hepatitis A (15). Comprehensive information on all risk and 
occupation indications for hepatitis A vaccination were not 
collected in the 2014 NHIS. Information was available only 
for those with foreign travel to areas of high or intermediate 
endemicity and those with chronic liver disease. Although 
hepatitis A vaccination of persons who had traveled outside the 
United States to a country in which hepatitis A is of high or 
intermediate endemicity was higher in 2014 and preceding years 
than among respondents who did not travel outside the United 
States or had traveled only to countries in which the disease is of 
low endemicity, overall hepatitis A vaccination among travelers 
and persons with chronic liver disease has remained low. Health 
care providers are encouraged to assess the needs of their clients 
for this vaccine and offer it whenever appropriate.
Hepatitis B Vaccination
In December 2011, ACIP recommended that all previously 
unvaccinated adults aged 19–59 years with diabetes mellitus 
(type 1 and type 2) be vaccinated against hepatitis B as soon 
as possible after receiving a diagnosis of diabetes and that 
unvaccinated adults aged ≥60 years with diabetes may be 
vaccinated at the discretion of the treating clinician after 
assessing their risk and the likelihood of an adequate immune 
response to vaccination (39). Hepatitis B vaccination coverage 
in 2014 among persons with diabetes showed no improvement 
over estimates obtained before this recommendation, which 
underscores the need to improve awareness of increased risk 
for contracting acute hepatitis B among persons with diabetes 
and to increase hepatitis B vaccination in this population.
During 1982, when hepatitis B vaccine was first recommended 
for HCP
, an estimated 10,000 infections occurred among persons 
employed in a medical or dental field. By 2004, the number of 
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections among HCP had decreased 
to an estimated 304 infections, largely resulting from the 
implementation of routine pre-exposure vaccination and improved 
infection-control precautions (40–42). The risk for acquiring 
HBV infection from occupational exposures is dependent on the 
frequency of percutaneous and mucosal exposures to blood or 
body fluids (e.g., semen, and wound exudates) containing HBV, 
particularly fluids containing hepatitis B e antigen, a marker for 
high HBV replication and viral load (26). The risk is higher during 
the professional training period and can vary throughout a person’s 
career (43). All unvaccinated persons whose work- and training-
related activities involve reasonably anticipated risk for exposure to 
blood or other infectious body fluids (e.g., HCP
, long-term–care 
facility staff, and public safety workers) should be vaccinated with 
the complete, ≥3-dose hepatitis B vaccine series and undergo 
postvaccination serological testing to demonstrate protective 
antibody levels (44). During 2010–2014, estimates of hepatitis 
vaccination among HCP have not improved, ranging from 
61%–65%, well below the Healthy People 2020 target of 90%. 
The Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee 
(HICPAC) has encouraged all facilities or organizations that 
provide direct patient care to formulate a comprehensive 
vaccination policy for all HCP (45). Implementation of HICPAC 
and CDC recommendations can assist hospital administrators, 
infection-control practitioners, employee health clinicians, and 
HCP in optimizing infection prevention and control programs.
Herpes Zoster Vaccination
ACIP recommends herpes zoster vaccination for adults aged 
≥60 years (46). Although herpes zoster vaccination coverage 
increased in 2014 compared with 2013, it was 2.1 percentage 
points below the Healthy People 2020 target of 30%. Shortages of 
herpes zoster vaccine and a resulting lack of vaccine promotion 
likely contributed to low uptake during the first years after 
licensure. These shortages now appear to be resolved; however, 
 Surveillance Summaries

MMWR / February 5, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 1
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
other barriers persist, particularly the high cost for providers to 
purchase a supply, challenges to stocking the vaccine (which 
requires freezer storage), coverage for the vaccine under Medicare 
Part D, which results in billing challenges for medical providers 
(except pharmacist vaccine providers), and out-of-pocket 
payments for some Medicare Part D beneficiaries depending 
on their specific plan (47,48). Providers often refer patients to 
pharmacies for herpes zoster vaccination because reimbursement 
for Medicare Part D benefits is less complex. For adults aged 
≥60 years with nongrandfathered private health insurance plans, 
herpes zoster vaccine is available with no out-of-pocket costs 
because of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (14,47,48).
HPV Vaccination
Although HPV vaccination increased significantly among 
age-eligible females during 2010–2014 (5,49,50), coverage 
has remained low. Since 2006, ACIP has recommended 
routine vaccination of adolescent girls and boys at ages 11 or 
12 years and vaccination for females aged 13–26 years who 
have not been vaccinated previously (51). Since 2011, ACIP 
has recommended vaccination for males aged 13–21 years 
who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not 
completed the 3-dose series; males aged 22–26 years may be 
vaccinated. Approximately 12% of females and 2% of males 
aged 19–26 years not vaccinated at age ≤18 years reported 
receiving the first dose of HPV vaccine as catch-up at age 
19–26 years. As more adolescents are vaccinated at the target 
age group and age into the group monitored in NHIS, vaccine 
coverage estimates are expected to increase.
Data on age at first dose of HPV vaccination of adults was 
collected for the first time in 2013. Most female and male 
respondents in the 2014 NHIS reported receiving the first dose 
of HPV vaccine at age ≥13 years, consistent with the fact that 
female respondents aged ≥21 years and all male respondents 
would have been aged >13 years at the time HPV vaccination 
was first recommended. Some respondents also indicated the 
first HPV vaccination dose was received before HPV vaccine 
was licensed for use in 2006, suggesting inaccurate recall.
In 2014, white women reported higher HPV coverage than 
Hispanic or Asian women. Black women and women reporting 
other race had coverage similar to that for whites. The findings 
for black, Hispanic, and Asian women contrast with data on 
HPV vaccination of adolescent girls aged 13–17 years reported 
in the 2014 National Immunization Survey–Teen (NIS-Teen) 
(52), which indicated that, among females, ≥1, ≥2, and ≥3 HPV 
dose coverage was higher among Hispanic adolescents and 
similar for Asian adolescents compared with white adolescents. 
Among black adolescents, ≥1 and ≥2 HPV dose coverage was 
also higher compared with estimates for white adolescents. HPV 
vaccination coverage for each HPV dose was higher for females 
living below poverty level compared with those at or above the 
poverty level. The higher coverage in NIS-Teen among black 
and Hispanic females and those living below the poverty level 
might be attributable in part to the continued effectiveness of the 
Vaccines for Children program, which provides recommended 
vaccines at no cost to eligible children through age 18 years 
(53). NIS-Teen estimates also are based on provider reports 
from medical records whereas NHIS vaccination data are self-
reported. Young adults might not be able to recall accurately 
which vaccines they received as adolescents.
Although vaccination coverage has increased since a licensed 
HPV vaccine has been available and recommended by ACIP
, 
many adolescent and young adult females remain unvaccinated 
and vulnerable to develop cancers that safe, effective HPV 
vaccines can prevent (51). Studies on the prevalence of genital 
HPV infection among women in the United States (54) and the 
seroprevalence of the nine HPV types in the 9-valent vaccine 
(55) indicated that many adult women have not been infected 
with high-risk HPV types, supporting implementation of ACIP-
recommended catch-up vaccination. Until HPV vaccination 
increases among adolescents, a high proportion of unprotected 
young women eligible for HPV vaccination will be expected. 
Results from modeling and studies of the cost-effectiveness of 
HPV vaccination of young women have suggested that catch-up 
vaccination could reduce the amount of time needed to achieve 
population level impacts of vaccination (56,57). Findings from 
initial studies of vaccine impact in settings in which catch-up 
vaccination programs were successful in achieving high coverage 
rates among young women are consistent with these models 
(56,57). Continued efforts are needed to improve coverage among 
members of the primary target group for HPV vaccine, girls and 
boys aged 11–12 years, and among all racial and ethnic groups. 
Efforts also are needed to improve catch-up vaccination among 
those who have not started or completed their vaccination.
Health Insurance Status and Usual Place 
for Health Care
The findings in this report are consistent with a previous 
report (12) indicating that having health insurance was 
generally associated with a greater likelihood of having received 
recommended vaccinations. Even after demographic and access-
to-care variables are controlled for, persons with health insurance 
were more likely to be vaccinated than those without insurance 
for several vaccines. The type of health insurance indicated 
by respondents had a significant association with vaccination 
coverage. Vaccination coverage was higher among adults with 
private health insurance compared with those reporting public 
health insurance for many of the vaccines, but this finding 
 Surveillance Summaries
MMWR / February 5, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 1 
15
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
was not consistent for all vaccines and age groups. The factors 
contributing to vaccination levels by type of health insurance are 
not well understood. In one study (58), the percentage of persons 
with private health insurance declined during 1999–2011, 
ranging from 67% to 74% during 1999–2008, and was 64% 
during 2009–2011. This downward shift in private insurance 
coverage might have had an impact on adult vaccination 
coverage. The Affordable Care Act also might have had an impact 
on vaccination coverage (48). A better understanding of factors 
influencing vaccination by type of health insurance is needed.
Health insurance coverage, although beneficial in improving 
access to health care services, might not be sufficient in itself 
to achieve optimal adult vaccination. In this report, even 
among those with health insurance and ≥10 contacts with 
physicians during the preceding year and no contraindications, 
vaccination was still not routine. Up to 88.8% of adults reported 
not receiving one or more recommended vaccines. Provider 
attitudes toward adult vaccination, practice patterns that do 
not routinely incorporate assessments for vaccines for adults, 
and other barriers to vaccination might determine whether 
patients are offered and receive vaccines (6,8–10,12,14,59).
In general, persons with a usual place for health care were 
more likely to report having received recommended vaccinations 
than those who did not have a usual place for health care, 
regardless of whether they had health insurance, and vaccination 
coverage generally increased as the number of physician contacts 
increased. This observation suggests that an increased number 
of physician contacts might have facilitated opportunities to 
be reminded of the need for vaccinations, discussions about 
indicated vaccinations, and a recommendation and decision to 
vaccinate. These findings are also consistent with previous reports 
indicating that persons who have a usual place for health care 
or medical home and who seek medical care one or more times 
during the year are more likely to be vaccinated and receive 
other preventive services than those without a usual place for 
health care (59,60). Having a usual place for health care and 
routine physician contact can provide important opportunities 
for providers to educate their patients about vaccine-preventable 
diseases and recommend and offer vaccination (61–65).
Nativity
Overall, vaccination coverage was generally lower among the 
foreign-born compared with U.S.-born persons. Vaccination 
coverage for the foreign born differed by time lived in the United 
States. In a previous report (65), vaccination also was associated 
with language used for interview, race/ethnicity, and birth country/
region. Among foreign born, vaccination coverage was generally 
lower among those who were not U.S. citizens, those interviewed 
in a language other than English, and non-Hispanic blacks or 
Hispanics compared with U.S. citizens, those interviewed in 
English, and non-Hispanic whites. The Hispanic foreign born had 
the lowest coverage for several vaccines. This finding is notable 
because foreign-born persons from Latin America account for 
more than half of all foreign-born adults in the United States 
(66–68). Vaccination coverage among the foreign born in the 
United States depends on the vaccinations they received as children 
or adults premigration, during migration, postmigration, or 
during return visits to their country of origin. Vaccination coverage 
and immunization schedules are different in many countries 
compared with the United States and vary by country and even 
by regions within countries (65,69–71). Although immigrant visa 
applicants and refugees destined for permanent resettlement in 
the United States are subject to ACIP-recommended vaccination 
requirements, the differences between the United States and 
other countries in the schedules of routine vaccinations among 
adults might contribute to differences in the coverage levels of 
the vaccines studied. In most countries, vaccination programs 
have focused historically on children (72–74). Depending on 
their origin, age at arrival, and year of arrival, foreign-born adults 
arriving in the United States might have differences in vaccination 
coverage compared with U.S.-born populations (75,76). After 
arrival in the United States, many foreign-born adults experience 
socioeconomic, cultural, linguistic, and other barriers to accessing 
health care and preventive services, including vaccination 
(66,67,77). The percentage of uninsured persons also is higher 
among non-U.S. citizens, recent immigrants, and those with poor/
fair English proficiency (68,78). These populations might also be 
less aware of U.S. adult immunization recommendations (79). As 
the size and race/ethnic diversity of the foreign born population 
in the United States continues to increase, the findings of this and 
previous studies indicate that this population will be increasingly 
important to elimination of national adult vaccination disparities 
(80). Public policy makers, vaccination programs, and healthcare 
providers should consider foreign-born populations in their public 
health assessment, evaluation, and outreach programs that target 
disadvantaged groups (80).
Improving Adult  
Vaccination Coverage
Racial/ethnic gaps in coverage persisted for all seven vaccines 
in this report with higher coverage generally for whites compared 
with most other groups. Previous research has indicated a 
variety of factors that contribute to racial/ethnic differences in 
adult vaccination rates, including patient, provider, and system 
factors (81–84). Standardized offering of vaccines reduces these 
differences (85,86). Using an intensive combination of patient 
tracking, vaccination reminders for providers and patients, 
 Surveillance Summaries
16 
MMWR / February 5, 2016 / Vol. 65 / No. 1
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and patient outreach and assistance also reduces racial/ethnic 
vaccination differences (87). Incorporating standards for 
adult vaccination practices, which include routinely assessing 
vaccination needs during clinical encounters, providing a strong 
recommendation for vaccination to patients with indications, 
and then offering vaccination at the visit, can have a substantial 
impact on reducing vaccination disparities (25).
Many factors contribute to low adult vaccination rates, 
including limited awareness among the public about adult 
vaccinations, vaccine needs assessment often not routinely 
included in adult patient care, lack of vaccine requirements for 
adults, complexities in how adult vaccinations are paid for by 
private and public insurers, the financial risks for providers to 
stock vaccines and provide vaccination services, limited funding 
for programs to vaccinate uninsured adults, and acute medical 
care taking precedence over preventive services (6–14).
The most successful strategies to improve adult immunizations 
involve organizational change, such as initiating standing orders 
or protocols to ensure immunization assessment is routinely 
done and needed vaccines administered when indicated. The 
Community Preventive Services Task Force has evaluated 
vaccination interventions and identified effective, evidence-based 
strategies to improve vaccine use which can be applied to the 
adult population, including systems interventions, such as the 
use of standing orders or protocols for vaccinations, provider 
reminders, and reminders for patients for vaccines that are 
due (6,24). Provider recommendation remains an important 
factor associated with receipt of vaccine (18). In addition, 
ensuring convenient access to vaccination also is important for 
adults (88,89). The expanded availability of vaccine services in 
pharmacies and other retail settings provides an opportunity for 
patients to receive vaccines not stocked by their medical provider 
and to obtain vaccines outside of typical office hours (88,89).
Challenges posed by increasing access to vaccines for adults 
among a range of providers include vaccine record keeping and 
ensuring good communication among providers about a patient’s 
vaccination history. Both are essential to ensuring patients 
receive needed vaccines at recommended intervals and do not 
receive unnecessary vaccinations. State-based immunization 
information systems (also known as vaccine registries) are 
available for entry of adult vaccinations in 47 states (http://www.
cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/about.html) and can serve as a 
central point of access for providers to check for vaccinations 
received by adult patients and to document vaccinations 
they provide (90). Providers should check with their health 
department to identify those immunization information systems 
that have the capacity to enroll adult providers as some systems 
might be limited in their capacity to substantially expand access 
to immunization information systems beyond pediatric vaccine 
providers. Information about and contact information regarding 
use of IIS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/
iis/contacts-registry-staff.html.
The use of clinical decision support systems in electronic 
medical records systems also can facilitate improved vaccination 
rates. For example, use of prompts in electronic medical records 
systems for adult vaccines by the Indian Health Service has 
resulted in substantially higher coverage rates compared to 
national estimates from the NHIS (6).
On the basis of the importance of the provider recommendation, 
evidence-based strategies for improving vaccine uptake in adults, 
the recognition that not all medical providers stock all ACIP-
recommended vaccines for adults, the need for improved 
communication among the different health care providers 
that adults might have and other factors, the National Vaccine 
Advisory Committee published updated standards for adult 
immunization practice in 2014 with the intent of improving 
adult vaccination coverage of ACIP recommended vaccines. 
This guidance calls on health care providers, including those 
who do not stock vaccines, to 1) assess the vaccination status 
of patients at every clinical encounter; 2) recommend needed 
vaccines for patients; 3) offer recommended vaccines or, for 
providers who do not stock a needed vaccine, refer patients to 
a vaccine provider; and 4) document vaccines administered, 
including in IIS when available for use among adult patients 
(25). Resources to assist providers with implementation of the 
standards for adult immunization practice are available at http://
www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/patient-ed/adults/for-practice/
standards/index.html. Additional resources are also available 
through the National Adult and Influenza Summit (NAIIS) 
(http://www.izsummitpartners.org) website resource library. 
NAIIS is a national coalition representing more than 130 public 
and private organizations interested in improving the use of 
ACIP-recommended vaccines for adults and influenza vaccine 
for persons of all ages.
Limitations
The findings in this report are subject to at least seven 
limitations. First, the NHIS sample excludes persons in the 
military and those residing in institutions, which might result 
in underestimation or overestimation of vaccination coverage 
levels. Second, the response rate was 58.9%. Nonresponse bias 
can result if respondents and nonrespondents differ in their 
vaccination rates. Third, the determination of vaccination status 
and identification of high-risk conditions in NHIS were not 
validated by medical records. Fourth, self-report of vaccination 
might be subject to recall bias. Young adults particularly might 
not be able to recall accurately vaccines received as infants or 
adolescents. However, adult self-reported vaccination status is

sensitive for all seven vaccines in this report and specific for all 
except tetanus vaccination (91). Fifth, demographic and other 
characteristics (e.g., insurance status, usual source, and frequency 
of health care) were self-reported and were not validated. Sixth, the 
Tdap estimate is subject to considerable uncertainty. Respondents 
who reported a tetanus vaccination but were unable to say 
whether Td or Tdap was used during 2005–2014 were excluded 
from estimations of Tdap coverage, creating a potential for bias. 
Sensitivity calculations were conducted to assess the magnitude 
of potential bias. Depending on what proportion of excluded 
respondents actually received Tdap, actual Tdap coverage could 
fall within the range of 14.5%–46.9% for adults aged 19–64 years 
and 9.5%–41.6% for adults aged ≥65 years. Comparisons of 
Tdap coverage across years within subgroups might be affected 
by bias resulting from excluding persons who did not report the 
type of tetanus vaccine they received. Finally, the prevalence of 
selected behavioral characteristics in populations, including the 
use of preventive health services, vaccine safety concerns, state laws 
and vaccination intervention programs, cultural, religious, and 
other factors might affect vaccination coverage. Although NHIS 
collects information on use of other preventive health services, 
this information was not included in this analysis. NHIS did not 
collect information on these other factors.
Conclusion
Vaccination coverage levels among U.S. adults are low. 
Improvement in adult vaccination is needed to reduce the 
health consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases among 
adults. Awareness of the need for vaccines for adults is low 
among the general population and adult patients rely on 
provider recommendations for vaccination (6–9,11). Successful 
vaccination programs combine 1) education of potential 
vaccine recipients and publicity to promote vaccination; 
2) increased access to vaccination services in health care 
settings; and 3) use of practices that improve vaccination 
coverage, including reminder-recall systems, efforts to remove 
administrative and financial barriers to vaccination, use of 
standing order programs for vaccination, and assessment 
of practice-level vaccination rates with feedback to staff 
members (24,25,92). Health care provider recommendations 
for vaccination are strongly associated with a patient’s receipt 
of vaccines (10,62–64). Incorporation of routine assessment 
of adult patient vaccination needs, recommendation, and 
offer of needed vaccinations for adults into routine clinical 
care of adults can help improve vaccination rates and narrow 
widening racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination coverage 
(24,25). The adult immunization schedule (15), updated 
annually, provides current recommendations for vaccinating 
adults and a ready resource for persons who provide health care 
services for adults in various settings. Assessing associations 
with vaccination is important for understanding factors 
that contribute to low coverage rates and to disparities in 
vaccination, and for implementing strategies to improve 
vaccination coverage.

** Respondents were asked if they had ever had a pneumonia shot.
 
†† Respondents were asked if they had received a tetanus shot in the past 
10 years. Vaccinated respondents included adults who received Td during 
the past 10 years or Tdap during 2005–2014. 
 
§§ Respondents who had received a tetanus shot in the past 10 years were asked 
if their most recent shot was given in 2005 or later. Respondents who had 
received a tetanus shot since 2005 were asked if they were told that their most 
recent tetanus shot included the pertussis or whooping cough vaccine. 
Among 36,324 respondents aged ≥19 yrs, those without a “yes” or “no” 
classification for tetanus vaccination status within the preceding 10 years 
(n = 1,977 [5.4%]), for tetanus vaccination status during 2005–2014 (n = 1,098 
[3.0%]), or those who reported tetanus vaccination during 2005–2014, but 
were not told vaccine type by the provider (n = 8,612 [23.7%]), did not know 
vaccine type (Td or Tdap) (n = 1,765 [4.9%]), or refused to answer or for whom 
data were not obtained (n=5 [0.01%]) were excluded, yielding a sample of 
22,867 respondents aged ≥19 years for whom Tdap vaccination status could 
be assessed. In February 2012, ACIP recommended Tdap vaccination for all 
adults aged ≥19 years, including adults aged ≥65 years.

* Adults were considered at high risk for pneumococcal disease if they had ever 
been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had diabetes, 
emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, 
angina, heart attack, or other heart condition; had a diagnosis of cancer during 
the previous 12 months (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer); had ever been 
told by a doctor or other health professional that they had lymphoma, leukemia, 
or blood cancer; had been told by a doctor or other health professional that 
they had chronic bronchitis or weak or failing kidneys during the preceding 12 
months; had an asthma episode or attack during the preceding 12 months; or 
were current smokers. For hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination, data were 
collected on selected respondent characteristics that increase the risk for 
infection (travel to countries where hepatitis A infections are endemic and 
having chronic liver disease; having diabetes, travel to countries where 
hepatitis B infections are endemic, and having chronic liver disease, respectively).
 
† Race/ethnicity was categorized as follows: Hispanic, black, white, Asian 
and “other.” In this report, persons identified as Hispanic might be of any 
race. Persons identified as black, white, Asian, or other race are non-
Hispanic. “Other” includes American Indian/Alaska Native and multiple 
race. The five racial/ethnic categories are mutually exclusive.
 
§ Respondents were asked if they had received an influenza shot or nasal spray 
in the past 12 months and if so, in which month and year. Missing month and 
year were imputed (3.1%) and interviews conducted during August 2013–June 
2014 were used to estimate vaccination coverage during July 2013–May 2014 
using Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. Differences were measured as the simple 
difference between the 2012–13 and 2013–14 influenza seasons.

TABLE 3. (Continued) Estimated proportion of health care personnel* 
with direct patient care responsibilities who received selected 
vaccinations, by race/ethnicity — National Health Interview Survey, 
United States, 2014
Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; HCP = health care personnel; Td = tetanus-
diphtheria toxoid; Tdap = tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine.
 * Adults were classified as HCP if they reported that they currently volunteer 
or work in a hospital, medical clinic, doctor’s office, dentist’s office, nursing 
home or some other health care facility including part-time and unpaid 
work in a health care facility as well as professional nursing care provided 
in the home.
 
† HCP were classified as having direct patient care responsibilities if they 
reported providing direct patient care (physical or hands-on contact with 
patients) as part of their routine work.
 
§ Race/ethnicity was categorized as follows: Hispanic, black, white, Asian and 
“other.” In this report, persons identified as Hispanic might be of any race. 
Persons identified as black, white, Asian, or other race are non-Hispanic. 
“Other” includes American Indian/Alaska Native and multiple race. The five 
racial/ethnic categories are mutually exclusive.
 
¶ Respondents were asked if they had received an influenza shot or nasal 
spray in the past 12 months and if so, in which month and year. Missing 
month and year were imputed (3.1%), and interviews conducted during 
August 2013–June 2014 were used to estimate vaccination coverage during 
July 2013–May 2014 using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Differences were 
measured as the simple difference between the 2012–13 and 2013–14 
influenza seasons.
 ** p<0.05 by T test for comparisons between 2014 and 2013 within each level 
of each characteristic.
 †† p<0.05 by T test for comparisons with non-Hispanic white as the reference.
 §§ Estimate is not reliable due to small sample size (n<30) or relative standard 
error (standard error/estimates) >0.3.
 ¶¶ Respondents who had received a tetanus shot in the past 10 years were 
asked if their most recent shot was given in 2005 or later. Respondents who 
had received a tetanus shot since 2005 were asked if they were told that 
their most recent tetanus shot included the pertussis or whooping cough 
vaccine. Among 2,933 HCP aged ≥19 years, those without a “yes” or “no” 
classification for tetanus vaccination status within the preceding 10 years 
(n = 68 [2.3%]), for tetanus vaccination status during 2005–2014 (n = 75 
[2.6%]), or those who reported tetanus vaccination during 2005–2014, but 
were not told vaccine type by the provider (n = 608 [20.7%]) or did not know 
vaccine type (Td or Tdap) (n = 120 [4.1%]) were excluded, yielding a sample 
of 2,062 respondents aged ≥19 years for whom Tdap vaccination status 
could be assessed. In February 2012, ACIP recommended Tdap vaccination 
for all adults aged ≥19 years, including adults aged ≥65 years.
 
*** p<0.05 by T test for comparisons between HCP with direct patient care 
responsibilities and HCP without direct patient care responsibilities.
 ††† Respondents were asked if they had ever received the hepatitis B vaccine, 
and if yes, if they had received at least 3 doses or less than 3 doses.

* Adults were considered at high risk for pneumococcal disease if they had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had diabetes, emphysema, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack, or other heart condition; had a diagnosis of cancer during the previous 
12 months (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer); had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had lymphoma, leukemia, or blood 
cancer; had been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had chronic bronchitis or weak or failing kidneys during the preceding 12 months; had 
an asthma episode or attack during the preceding 12 months; or were current smokers. For hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination, data were collected on selected 
respondent characteristics that increase the risk for infection (travel to countries where hepatitis A infections are endemic and having chronic liver disease; having 
diabetes, travel to countries where hepatitis B infections are endemic, and having chronic liver disease, respectively).
 
† Adults were considered insured if they reported having public health insurance coverage (Medicare, Medicaid, military health care (TRICARE/VA/CHAMP-VA), 
Indian Health Service, state-sponsored health plan, or other government program insurance) or private health insurance coverage.
 
§ Respondents were asked if they had received an influenza shot or nasal spray in the past 12 months and if so, in which month and year. Missing month and year 
were imputed (3.1%), and interviews conducted during August 2013–June 2014 were used to estimate vaccination coverage during July 2013–May 2014 using

§§ Respondents were asked if they had ever had a pneumonia shot.
 
¶¶ Respondents were asked if they had received a tetanus shot in the past 10 years. Vaccinated respondents included adults who received Td during the past 10 years 
or Tdap during 2005–2014.
 *** Respondents who had received a tetanus shot in the past 10 years were asked if their most recent shot was given in 2005 or later. Respondents who had received 
a tetanus shot since 2005 were asked if they were told that their most recent tetanus shot included the pertussis or whooping cough vaccine. Among 36,324 
respondents aged ≥19 years, those without a “yes” or “no” classification for tetanus vaccination status within the preceding 10 years (n = 1,977 [5.4%]), for tetanus 
vaccination status during 2005–2014 (n = 1,098 [3.0%]), or those who reported tetanus vaccination during 2005–2014, but were not told vaccine type by the 
provider (n = 8,612 [23.7%]), did not know vaccine type (Td or Tdap) (n = 1,765 [4.9%]), or refused to answer or for whom data were not obtained (n=5 [0.01%]) 
were excluded, yielding a sample of 22,867 respondents aged ≥19 years for whom Tdap vaccination status could be assessed. In February 2012, ACIP recommended 
Tdap vaccination for all adults aged ≥19 years, including adults aged ≥65 years.
 ††† Estimate is not reliable due to small sample size (n<30) or relative standard error (standard error/estimates) >0.3.
 §§§ Respondents were asked if they had ever received the hepatitis A vaccine, and if yes, were asked how many doses were received.
 ¶¶¶ Had traveled outside the United States to countries other than countries in Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, or Canada since 1995.

* Adults were considered at high risk for pneumococcal disease if they had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had diabetes, emphysema, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack, or other heart condition; had a diagnosis of cancer during the previous 
12 months (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer); had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had lymphoma, leukemia, or blood cancer; 
had been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had chronic bronchitis or weak or failing kidneys during the preceding 12 months; had an asthma 
episode or attack during the preceding 12 months; or were current smokers. For hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination, data were collected on selected respondent 
characteristics that increase the risk for infection (travel to countries where hepatitis A infections are endemic and having chronic liver disease; having diabetes, 
travel to countries where hepatitis B infections are endemic, and having chronic liver disease, respectively).
 
† Adults were considered insured if they reported having public health insurance coverage (Medicare, Medicaid, military health care [TRICARE/VA/CHAMP-VA], 
Indian Health Service, state-sponsored health plan, or other government program insurance) or private health insurance coverage.
 
§ Respondents were asked the number of times in the past 12 months that they saw a doctor other health care professional about their own health.
 
¶ Respondents were asked if they had received an influenza shot or nasal spray in the past 12 months and if so, in which month and year. Missing month and year 
were imputed (3.1%), and interviews conducted during August 2013–June 2014 were used to estimate vaccination coverage during July 2013–May 2014 using 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
 
** p<0.05 by T test for comparisons with no physician contacts in the past 12 months as the reference group.
 
†† p<0.05 by T test comparing persons aged 50–64 years and aged ≥65 years with persons aged 19–49 years for influenza; persons aged 19–64 years with high-risk 
conditions with persons aged ≥65 years for pneumococcal; persons aged 50–64 years and aged ≥65 years with persons aged 19–49 years for tetanus; persons 
aged 19–64 years with persons aged ≥65 years for Tdap; and persons aged 19–59 years with diabetes with persons aged ≥60 years with diabetes for hepatitis B.
 
§§ Estimate is not reliable due to small sample size (n<30) or relative standard error (standard error/estimates) >0.3.
 
¶¶ Respondents were asked if they had ever had a pneumonia shot.
 *** Respondents were asked if they had received a tetanus shot in the past 10 years. Vaccinated respondents included adults who received Td during the past 10 years 
or Tdap during 2005–2014.
 
††† Respondents who had received a tetanus shot in the past 10 years were asked if their most recent shot was given in 2005 or later. Respondents who had received 
a tetanus shot since 2005 were asked if they were told that their most recent tetanus shot included the pertussis or whooping cough vaccine. Among 36,324 
respondents aged ≥19 years, those without a “yes” or “no” classification for tetanus vaccination status within the preceding 10 years (n = 1,977 [5.4%]), for tetanus 
vaccination status during 2005–2014 (n = 1,098 [3.0%]), or those who reported tetanus vaccination during 2005–2014, but were not told vaccine type by the 
provider (n = 8,612 [23.7%]), did not know vaccine type (Td or Tdap) (n = 1,765 [4.9%]), or refused to answer or for whom data were not obtained (n=5 [0.01%]) 
were excluded, yielding a sample of 22,867 respondents aged ≥19 years for whom Tdap vaccination status could be assessed. In February 2012, ACIP recommended 
Tdap vaccination for all adults aged ≥19 years, including adults aged ≥65 years.
 §§§ Respondents were asked if they had ever received the hepatitis A vaccine, and if yes, were asked how many doses were received.
 ¶¶¶ Had traveled outside the United States to countries other than countries in Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, or Canada since 1995. 
 **** Respondents were asked if they had ever received the hepatitis B vaccine, and if yes, if they had received at least 3 doses or less than 3 doses.
 †††† Respondents were asked if they had ever received a shingles vaccine.
 §§§§ Respondents were asked if they had ever received the HPV shot or cervical cancer vaccine, and if yes, age at the first dose.
 ¶¶¶¶ The denominator includes persons aged 19–26 years without HPV vaccination prior to age 19 years, and the numerator includes those in the denominator who 
reported first HPV dose at age 19–26 years.
 
***** The confidence interval has not been generated because the estimate is zero.

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; HPV = human papillomavirus; HR = high risk; Td = tetanus-diphtheria toxoid; Tdap = tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine.
 
* Adults were considered at high risk for pneumococcal disease if they had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had diabetes, emphysema, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, angina, heart attack, or other heart condition; had a diagnosis of cancer during the previous 
12 months (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer); had ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had lymphoma, leukemia, or blood cancer; 
had been told by a doctor or other health professional that they had chronic bronchitis or weak or failing kidneys during the preceding 12 months; had an asthma 
episode or attack during the preceding 12 months; or were current smokers. For hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination, data were collected on selected respondent 
characteristics that increase the risk for infection (travel to countries where hepatitis A infections are endemic and having chronic liver disease; having diabetes, 
travel to countries where hepatitis B infections are endemic, and having chronic liver disease, respectively).
 
† Respondents were asked if they had received an influenza shot or nasal spray in the past 12 months and if so, in which month and year. Missing month and year 
were imputed (3.1%), and interviews from August 2013–June 2014 were used to estimate vaccination coverage during July 2013–May 2014 using Kaplan-Meier 
survival analysis.
 
§ p<0.05 by T test for comparisons between U.S. born and foreign born.
 
¶ p<0.05 by T test for comparisons between those living in the U.S. <10 years and those living in the United States ≥10 years.
 ** p<0.05 by T test comparing U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens.
 
†† p<0.05 by T test comparing persons aged 50–64 years and aged ≥65 years with persons 19–49 years for influenza; persons aged 19–64 years with high–risk 
conditions with persons aged ≥65 years for pneumococcal; persons aged 50–64 years and aged ≥65 years with persons aged 19–49 years for tetanus; persons 
aged 19–64 years with persons aged ≥65 years for Tdap; and persons aged 19–59 years with diabetes with persons aged ≥60 years with diabetes for hepatitis B. 
 
§§ Respondents were asked if they had ever had a pneumonia shot.
 
¶¶ Respondents were asked if they had received a tetanus shot in the past 10 years. Vaccinated respondents included adults who received Td during the past 10 years 
or Tdap during 2005–2014.
 *** Respondents who had received a tetanus shot in the past 10 years were asked if their most recent shot was given in 2005 or later. Respondents who had received 
a tetanus shot since 2005 were asked if they were told that their most recent tetanus shot included the pertussis or whooping cough vaccine. Among 36,324 
respondents aged ≥19 years, those without a “yes” or “no” classification for tetanus vaccination status within the preceding 10 years (n = 1,977 [5.4%]), for tetanus 
vaccination status during 2005–2014 (n = 1,098 [3.0%]), or those who reported tetanus vaccination during 2005–2014, but were not told vaccine type by the 
provider (n = 8,612 [23.7%]), did not know vaccine type (Td or Tdap) (n = 1,765 [4.9%]), or refused to answer or for whom data were not obtained (n=5 [0.01%]) 
were excluded, yielding a sample of 22,867 respondents aged ≥19 years for whom Tdap vaccination status could be assessed. In February 2012, ACIP recommended 
Tdap vaccination for all adults aged ≥19 years, including adults aged ≥65 years.
 ††† Estimate is not reliable due to small sample size (n<30) or relative standard error (standard error/estimates)>0.3.
 §§§ Respondents were asked if they had ever received the hepatitis A vaccine, and if yes, were asked how many doses were received.
 ¶¶¶ Had traveled outside the United States to countries other than countries in Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, or Canada since 1995. 
 
**** Respondents were asked if they had ever received the hepatitis B vaccine, and if yes, if they had received at least 3 doses or less than 3 doses.
 †††† Respondents were asked if they had ever received a shingles vaccine.
 
§§§§ Respondents were asked if they had ever received the HPV shot or cervical cancer vaccine, and if yes, age at the first dose.
 
¶¶¶¶ The denominator includes persons aged 19–26 years without HPV vaccination prior to age 19 years, and the numerator includes those in the denominator who 
reported first HPV dose at age 19–26 years.
