IMPORTANCE To date, factors associated with noise-induced hearing loss at music festivals
have not yet been analyzed in a single comprehensive data set. In addition, little is known
about the hearing loss–associated behavior of music festival attendees.
OBJECTIVES To assess which factors are associated with the occurrence of a temporary
threshold shift (TTS) after music exposure and to investigate the behavior of music festival
attendees.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective post hoc analysis gathered data from
a randomized, single-blind clinical trial conducted on September 5, 2015, at an outdoor music
festival in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Adult volunteers with normal hearing were recruited
via social media from August 26 through September 3, 2015. Intention to use earplugs was an
exclusion criterion. Of 86 volunteers assessed, 51 were included. This post hoc analysis was
performed from October 3, 2016, through February 27, 2017.
INTERVENTIONS Music festival visit for 4.5 hours.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was a TTS on a standard audiogram
for the frequencies 3.0- and 4.0-kHz. Multivariable linear regression was performed to
determine which factors are associated with a TTS. A questionnaire on behavior, hearing, and
tinnitus was distributed to the participants before and after the festival visit.
RESULTS A total of 51 participants were included (18 men [35%] and 33 women [65%]) with
a mean (SD) age of 27 (6) years. Mean (SD) threshold change across 3.0 and 4.0 kHz was 5.4
(5.7) dB for the right ear and 4.0 (6.1) dB for the left ear. Earplug use (absolute difference in
the left ear, −6.0 dB [95% CI, −8.7 to −3.2 dB]; in the right ear, −6.4 dB [95% CI, −8.8 to −4.1
dB]), quantity of alcohol use (absolute difference per unit in the left ear, 1.1 dB [95% CI, 0.5 to
1.7 dB]; in the right ear, 0.7 dB [95% CI, 0.1 to 1.4 dB]), drug use (absolute difference in the
right ear, 6.0 dB [95% CI, 0.9 to 11.1 dB]), and male sex (absolute difference in the right ear,
4.1 dB [95% CI, 0.3 to 5.9 dB]) were independently associated with hearing loss, with earplug
use being the most important factor. Unprotected participants reported significantly worse
subjective hearing performance and tinnitus after the festival visit than did participants using
earplugs (Cramer V, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.47-0.79] and 0.39 [95% CI, 0.16-0.62], respectively).
In the earplug group, the perceived loudness (r = −0.72; 95% CI, −1.00 to −0.43) and
appreciation (r = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.78) of music and speech perception (r = 0.21;
95% CI, 0.09 to 0.35) were correlated with the duration of earplug use.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The present study identified nonuse of earplugs, use of
alcohol and drugs, and male sex as associated with a TTS at an outdoor music festival.
Physicians should consider these factors to raise awareness about the combined risk of
attending music festivals without using earplugs while consuming alcohol and/or drugs.
The intention to use earplugs was correlated with the loudness and appreciation of music
with earplugs, which may advocate for the use of personalized earplugs.

uringthepast2decades,theprevalenceofhearingloss
amongyoungpeoplehasincreased,partlyowingtothe
increasing popularity of visiting music concerts, clubs,
and festivals.1,2 Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) due to rec-
reationalnoiseexposuremaybereducedbyusingearplugsthat
decrease the loudness of the noise.3 Recently, a randomized
clinical trial (RCT) on the effect of earplugs on recreational
NIHL4foundthatsignificantlyfewertemporarythresholdshifts
(TTSs) after a 4.5-hour festival visit were objectified in par-
ticipants who used earplugs compared with participants who
did not.
Development of NIHL due to recreational noise exposure
depends on factors concerning the noise, including the dura-
tion of exposure, the intensity and frequency of the noise and
how fast the sound pressure level increases.5,6 In addition, in-
ner ear vulnerability to noise after equivalent noise exposure
varies greatly, suggesting that additional factors are associ-
ated with individual susceptibility to noise.7,8 The first factor
that plays a significant role in the development of NIHL is in-
creasing age.9-12 This association is partly biased by the cu-
mulative noise exposure inherent to an increasing age. Sec-
ond, several studies on occupational NIHL9,10,12-14 have shown
that men are more likely to develop NIHL than are women. For
the same amount of occupational noise, Kovalova et al13 ob-
served significantly more NIHL in men than in women. Third,
alcohol intake is correlated with NIHL.15,16 As early as 1978, an
experiment was conducted that revealed that alcohol re-
duces the protective action of the acoustic reflex in persons
with normal hearing.15 In a controlled experiment in 2007, al-
cohol consumption correlated with a TTS in the lower fre-
quencies of normal-hearing participants.16 Other substances
are described to influence susceptibility to NIHL as well; 2.4-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine(MDMA)isapopularparty
drug in young adults and known for its hallucinatory, eu-
phoric, and stimulant effect.17 In 2001, Sharma18 described a
case of sensorineural hearing loss after the use of MDMA and
presented ototoxicity as an adverse effect of MDMA. MDMA
is known to exhaust brain neurotransmitters dopamine and
serotonin, which have a protective function against acoustic
trauma in the cochlea.19-22 Similar to MDMA, cocaine blocks
the reuptake of dopamine and serotonin at the presynaptic
membranes.23 A few cases of temporary severe sensorineural
hearing loss after the use of cocaine or a combination of drugs
are described in the literature.24-26 Finally, smoking com-
bined with noise exposure is hypothesized to correlate with
hearing thresholds and NIHL.27-30 A similar association be-
tween smoking cannabis and NIHL is suggested, but no cor-
roborating studies were found.
The association of these possible factors with recre-
ational NIHL has, to our knowledge, not been investigated in
a single comprehensive data set. The aim of this study was to
identify factors associated with a TTS after music exposure at
an outdoor music festival. To answer this research question,
data from the previous RCT on the effectiveness of earplugs
in preventing recreational NIHL4 were used.
Despite the significant increase in NIHL, the general will-
ingness to use earplugs, the reported use of earplugs, and
knowledge of the risks of developing NIHL are low in music
festivalattendees.31,32Asecondaryaimofthisstudywasthere-
fore to analyze self-reported outcomes that may influence ear-
plug use during a music festival. We intended to gain insights
in the behavior of music festival attendees during a festival
visit, including earplug use and the time spent near stages and
loudspeakers as well as alcohol and drug use.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This study contains prospectively gathered data from a single-
blind RCT (NTR5401) on the effect of earplugs on the
occurrence of TTS.4 This post hoc analysis of the RCT was
performed from October 3, 2016, through February 27, 2017.
ThemedicalethicscommitteeoftheUniversityMedicalCentre
Utrecht granted an exemption of full review. All participants
signed an informed consent before participating.
Location of the study was an outdoor music festival in Am-
sterdam, the Netherlands, on September 5, 2015. Partici-
pants of the study were recruited from August 26 through Sep-
tember 3, 2015, via social media advertisements and offered
afreetickettothefestival.Aftercompletingthestudytheywere
offered a €50 stipend. An important exclusion criterion was
the intention to use earplugs because randomizing volun-
teers with such an intention to the unprotected group would
beunethical.OtherexclusioncriteriaincludednoDutchorEng-
lish language proficiency, being younger than 18 years, past ear
surgery (except ventilation tubes), and present ear diseases or
hearing loss.
Festival Visit
The setup of the RCT is described in detail elsewhere.4 All par-
ticipants attended a music festival for 4.5 hours. Half of them
were instructed to use earplugs (MTV Soundkeepr; Standt BV).
Thetimewhenparticipantsleftthefestivalterrainandthetime
of hearing evaluations were registered. All participants were
advised to limit the use of alcohol and drugs in a way that they
would be able to complete hearing evaluations after the fes-
tival visit.4

Question What factors are associated with temporary
noise-induced hearing loss after music exposure during a music
festival?
Findings In this post hoc secondary analysis of 51 participants in a
randomized clinical trial, a temporary threshold shift across 3.0
and 4.0 kHz was associated with the following participant-related
factors: not using earplugs, use of alcohol and/or drugs, and
male sex.
Meaning Male attendees of music festivals who do not use
earplugs and simultaneously use alcohol and/or drugs are more
likely to develop temporary noise-induced hearing loss.

 the frequencies 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 kHz were
performed, and the presence of a TTS (≥10 dB) calculated as
a mean across 3.0 and 4.0 kHz was used as the primary out-
come measure for NIHL.3 The threshold shift was assumed
to be temporary; however, no follow-up audiometry was
performed to confirm this assumption. Audiometry was
completed, in compliance with international standards, by
the same audiologist or audiology assistant for both ears
before and after exposure in the same mobile audio cabin
(350 Series Maxi Audiology Booth; IAC Medical) using an
audiometer (AVANT A2D+; MedRx Inc) with a headphone
(HDA200; Sennheiser Electronic Corp). Background sound
level in the audio cabins was beneath maximum tolerated
levels.
After the outdoor festival visit, participants completed a
Dutch questionnaire concerning their behavior during the fes-
tival visit. The questionnaire included questions regarding al-
cohol and drug use, time spent near stages and loudspeakers,
loudness of music, subjective hearing loss, and tinnitus. Par-
ticipants allocated to the earplug group were asked to judge
their music appraisal, understanding of speech, earplug com-
fort, wearing time, and intention to use earplugs again.4 The
English translation of the questionnaire is found in the
eMethods in the Supplement.
Statistical Methods
To identify factors associated with a TTS after music expo-
sure, we performed a multivariable linear regression analysis
of the influence on TTS of the following 6 factors: use of ear-
plugs, use of alcohol, use of drugs, sex, age, and the interval
from the festival to the evaluation. The independent influ-
ence of each factor was expressed as the unstandardized
Pearson correlation coefficient (B), representing the influ-
ence of a 1-unit change in the factor on a 1-dB change in TTS
while controlling for the effect of other variables. Further-
more, the standardized correlation coefficient (β) was pro-
vided, in which the influence of a 1-U change in the factor
was standardized to range from −1 to 1 to compare the inde-
pendent influence of multiple factors. The 95% CIs around
the correlation coefficients are provided to describe the pre-
cision of the estimates and the plausible range for the true
effect. The data were normally distributed. A stepwise
design with manual backward selection procedure was cho-
sen. Owing to the post hoc design, investigators were not
blinded for the independent variables investigated.
To identify associations between outcomes on the ques-
tionnaire, we used the Spearman correlation coefficient test,
for which we reported r values (range, −1.00 to 1.00) for the
comparison of 2 ordinal variables and the Fisher exact test for

Results
Characteristics of Study Participants
and Festival Visit
Of 86 individuals assessed for eligibility, 51 were included in
the study.4 Twenty-five participants were assigned to use ear-
plugs.Eighteenparticipants(35%)weremaleand33(65%)were
female. Mean (SD) age of participants was 27 (6) years. Mean
(SD) alcohol consumption was 4 (2) U (1 U represents 1 glass
approximately 200-250 mL). Eleven participants used drugs
during the festival visit. The mean time-averaged, equivalent
A-weighted sound pressure level was 100 dBA, with outliers
as high as 145 dBA.4 The Figure shows the audiograms before
and after the festival for the earplug users and nonusers. The
mean threshold shift across 3.0 and 4.0 kHz was 5.4 (5.7) dB
for the right ear and 4.0 (6.1) dB for the left ear.
Missing Data
As a result of an audiology assistant's failure to follow study
protocol, the 3.0-kHz threshold baseline data were missing.
The missing 3.0-kHz threshold data were substituted by the
mean of 2.0- and 4.0-kHz thresholds at baseline.33 One par-
ticipant reported having consumed alcohol but did not re-
port the amount of units. This missing value was replaced with
the mean units of the other participants who consumed alco-
hol. Time of hearing evaluation was missing for 1 participant
and replaced with the mean time of the other participants.
Factors Associated With TTS at the Music Festival
As shown in Table 1, in univariable regression analysis, the use
of earplugs was negatively correlated with a TTS in both ears
(B = −5.78 [95% CI, −8.81 to −2.74] and −5.97 [95% CI, −8.69
to −3.24]), whereas units of alcohol (B = 1.03 [95% CI, 0.30 to
1.76] and 0.90 [95% CI, 0.20 to 1.58]) and male sex (B = 1.03
[95%CI,0.30to1.76]and4.00[95%CI,0.85to7.17])wereposi-
tively correlated with a TTS in both ears. As shown in Table 2,
using a multivariable regression analysis, use of earplugs was
negatively correlated (B = −5.97 [95% CI, −8.73 to −3.24] and
−6.44 [95% CI, −8.80 to −4.09]) and alcohol intake positively
correlated (B = 1.09 [95% CI, 0.46 to 1.72] and 5.98 [95% CI,
0.87 to 11.08]) with a TTS in both ears. Use of earplugs was as-
sociated with reduced TTS (absolute difference in the left ear,
−6.0 dB [95% CI, −8.7 to −3.2 dB]; in the right ear, −6.4 dB [95%
CI, −8.8 to −4.1 dB]), whereas alcohol use was associated with
increased TTS (absolute difference per unit in the left ear, 1.1
dB [95% CI, 0.5 to 1.7 dB]; in the right ear, 0.7 dB [95% CI, 0.1
to 1.4 dB]) in both ears. Male sex (absolute difference, 4.1 dB
[95% CI, 0.3 to 5.9 dB]) and use of MDMA (absolute differ-
ence, 6.0 dB [95% CI, 0.9 to 11.1 dB]) were positively corre-
lated with a TTS in the right ear only. The model explained 39%
of the variance for the left ear and 53% for the right ear.
Subjective Behavior and Attitude Outcomes
All Participants
Associations between questions answered by all study par-
ticipants regarding their behavior during the music festival
are reported in Table 3. A decrease in subjective hearing per-
formance was related to an increase in subjective tinnitus
(Cramer V, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20-0.66). In addition, subjective
hearing performance and tinnitus were correlated with ear-
plug use (Cramer V, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.47-0.79] and 0.39 [95%
CI, 0.16-0.62], respectively). Use of earplugs did not have a
strongassociationwiththereportedtimespentnearstagesand
loudspeakers or with drug use. However, earplug use was cor-
related with increased alcohol intake (Cramer V, 0.40; 95% CI,
0.35-0.70). In addition, increased alcohol intake was posi-
tively correlated with the amount of time spent near loud-
speakers (r = −0.41; 95% CI, −0.64 to −0.14]) and with drug use
(Cramer’s V, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.72).

 Earplug Users
The associations between questions answered by the partici-
pants allocated to the earplug group are reported in Table 4.
In this group, perceived loudness (r = −0.72; 95% CI, −1.00 to
−0.43) and appreciation (r = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.78) of mu-
sic and speech perception (r = 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.35) were
correlated with the duration of earplug use. The intention to
wear earplugs again moderately increased when speech per-
ception with earplugs increased (r = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.11-0.66).
The intention to use earplugs again increased when the dura-
tion of earplug use during the study increased (r = 0.44; 95%
CI, 0.16-0.68). Speech perception with earplugs and inten-
tion to use earplugs again was moderately correlated (r = 0.41;
95% CI, 0.11-0.66). The intention to wear earplugs again was
reduced when the music was perceived as too soft while wear-
ing earplugs (r = −0.38; 95% CI, −0.68 to −0.06). Loudness of
music and comfort of earplug use could be correlated, but the
CI was large (r = −0.40; −0.70 to −0.02).
Discussion
The present study identified nonuse of earplugs, use of alco-
hol and drugs, and male sex as associated with a TTS at an out-
door music festival. Not using earplugs was correlated with re-
ported subjective hearing loss and tinnitus. With increasing
intake of alcohol, the amount of time spent near loudspeak-
ersincreased.Theintentiontouseearplugswasassociatedwith
the loudness and appreciation of music and the speech per-
ception with earplugs.
Not using earplugs and consumption of alcohol were iden-
tified as associated with a TTS in both ears. Male sex and use
of MDMA were also identified as associated, although weaker
correlations were seen in the right ear. This discrepancy be-
tween ears can be explained by the right ear having been af-
fected more severely by the high sound pressure levels than
the left ear. Our results are in accordance with previous co-
hort studies and case reports10-30 on the influence of ear-
plugs, sex, and alcohol in NIHL. The effectiveness of earplugs
was examined in a systematic review3 in which 1 RCT was de-
scribed that also showed a positive effect of earplugs in reduc-
ing postconcert threshold shifts. The effect of sex on NIHL was
first observed in 1981, when male visitors of a pop music event
exhibited larger TTSs on all frequencies than did female
visitors.34Withregardtoalcoholconsumption,Upileetal16ob-
served a positive association between breath alcohol concen-
tration and the magnitude of hearing thresholds when ex-
posed to recreational noise. Apart from the previously
mentioned case report,18 the association between MDMA and
NIHLwasstudiedonlyinanimals;astudyinrats35showedthat
the combination of MDMA and noise enhances the effect of
noise on NIHL.
Alcohol and drug use are known to occur at music
festivals.36,37 Their influence on the development of TTSs and
permanent threshold shifts at a younger age enhance the ef-
fect of music on NIHL. Thus, music venue attendees are more
likely to develop NIHL at a noisy music venue when using al-
cohol and drugs than are attendees who do not simultane-

 ously use these substances. In the present study, 11 of 51 par-
ticipants (22%) reported the use of drugs and 49 of 51
participants (96%) reported to have consumed alcohol. Be-
cause participants were advised to limit the use of sub-
stances to be able to undergo audiometry and complete the
questionnaire after the festival visit, the accuracy of self-
reported alcohol and drug use may be questioned. In a study
on the accuracy of self-reported consumption of alcohol,38 an
underestimation of alcohol consumption occurred when the
intake increased beyond 6 U, whereas it was reasonably accu-
rate for light to moderate alcohol intake (<6 U). Considering
the mean amount reported by our participants (4 U), we ex-
pect this possible bias to be limited and the association be-
tween alcohol and TTSs to be a significant one. As physi-
cians, it is vital to inform patients of the combined risk of using
alcohol and/or drugs and not using earplugs at music venues
and strongly advise against such behavior.
Association Between Self-reported Behavior
and Attitude Outcomes
The secondary aim of this study was to investigate the behav-
ior of music festival attendees. In particular, we were inter-
ested to see whether participants who used earplugs would ex-
hibit dangerous behavior in reference to their location at a
festival, for example, near stages and loudspeakers, because
of a sense of protection against the high sound pressure lev-
els while using earplugs. We did not find an association based
on the questionnaire findings. Alcohol consumption, how-
ever, was positively correlated with wearing earplugs, the
amount of time spent near loudspeakers, and drug use. Thus,
when participants consumed more alcohol, they exhibited
more dangerous behavior. How well participants were able to
estimate their location at the festival in reference to stages and
loudspeakers may be questioned. In addition, earplug use was
related to subjective hearing performance. Furthermore, sub-
jective tinnitus was related to subjective hearing perfor-
mance; participants who experienced newly induced tinni-
tus also reported worse subjective hearing performance after
the festival visit. Thus, participants seem to rate hearing and
tinnitus complaints equivalently.
In the earplug group, loudness and appreciation of
music and speech perception while using earplugs were
associated with the duration of earplug use. In previous
studies,32,39 loud music, awareness of loud music, and the
appreciation of music were associated with use of earplugs.
These findings may advocate the use of personalized ear-
plugs. In addition, personal noise injury in the past was
associated with earplug use.32,39 In this study, eligible par-
ticipants who intended to use earplugs were excluded.
Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions on the effect of a
previous noise injury on the intention to use earplugs from
our study data. When assigned to the earplug group, partici-
pants were asked to use the earplugs for the entire visit. Only
3 participants who were assigned to the earplug group
admitted that they did not use them for the entire festival
visit but for most of the festival visit. We expect participants
to have given socially desirable answers to questions from
the questionnaire; therefore, this number is probably an
underestimation. Assuming more participants in the earplug
group did not use the earplugs for the entire festival visit,
the protective effect of earplugs might be even stronger than
the effect that we found in our study.
Limitations
One limitation of this study is that we used a self-designed
questionnaire that was not validated. Recent studies on ani-
malmodelshaveshownthatnoiseexposurenotleadingtoper-
manent threshold shifts cause cochlear synaptopathy.40 Coch-
lear synaptopathy has been described as hidden hearing loss
because it is not detectable using standard audiometry. Be-
causenostandardizedtestisavailabletomeasurehiddenhear-
ing loss,41 we used standard audiometry in our study to de-
tectaTTS.Therefore,wewerenotabletodetecthiddenhearing
loss in our study participants. Another limitation of this study
is that audiometric data at 3.0 kHz were missing in 12 partici-
pants.Usingthemeanof2.0-and4.0-kHzdatatoreplacethese
missing data might have reduced the possible bias that re-
sulted from these missing data.
ThesevariablesexplainonlypartofthevarianceoftheTTS
outcomes in our participants. No correlation between time un-
til evaluation and TTS was found, indicating that a (partial) re-
covery of the TTS before participants underwent evaluation
was unlikely. We presume that genetic susceptibility and en-
vironmental differences can explain the individual differ-

 ences in susceptibility to noise that are still unexplained by our
model.7,8,42,43 Furthermore, one might argue that the noise re-
duction rate of the earplugs may have differed per partici-
pant because these rates were not personalized. In addition,
the exact level of noise exposure per participant was un-
known because localization on the festival terrain was un-
known. This variability between participants would contrib-
ute to the unexplained variance in the model. Furthermore,
ourquestionnairedidnotincludeaquestionconcerningsmok-
ing habits. Previous studies have shown that cigarette smok-
ers are more likely to develop NIHL when exposed to high
sound pressure levels.27-30 In addition, race could not be ana-
lyzed in our study owing to too little variance in our data. Lit-
erature suggests that white persons are more susceptible to
noisethanareAfricanAmericanpersons.9-11,44Analysisofthese
factors in future research on predictors of recreational NIHL
would be of interest.
