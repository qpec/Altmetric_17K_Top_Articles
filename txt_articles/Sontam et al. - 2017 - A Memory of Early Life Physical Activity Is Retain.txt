Studies have reported opposing effects of high-fat (HF) diet and mechanical stimulation
on lineage commitment of the bone marrow stem cells. Yet, how bone marrow modulates
its gene expression in response to the combined effects of mechanical loading and a HF
diet has not been addressed. We investigated whether early-life (before onset of sexual
maturity at 6 weeks of age) voluntary physical activity can modulate the effects of a
HF diet on male Sprague Dawley rats. In the bone marrow, early-life HF diet resulted
in adipocyte hypertrophy and a pro-inflammatory and pro-adipogenic gene expression
profile. The bone marrow of the rats that undertook wheel exercise while on a HF diet
retained a memory of the early-life exercise. This memory lasted at least 60 days after the
cessation of the voluntary exercise. Our results are consistent with the marrow adipose
tissue having a unique response to HF feeding in the presence or absence of exercise.

INTRODUCTION
Childhood obesity has reached epidemic levels worldwide (WHO, 2016). The metabolic
dysfunction induced by obesity in childhood persists into adulthood (Mattsson et al., 2008; Juonala
et al., 2011; Schmidt et al., 2011; Lloyd et al., 2012). There is a genetic component to this complex
phenotype. However, environmental factors, including excess energy intake and reduced physical
activity, make a measurable contribution to the increasing obesity prevalence. As such, physical
activity has long been considered as a non-pharmacological strategy to combat obesity and its
associated co-morbidities (Tuomilehto et al., 2001; Misra et al., 2008).
Achieving optimal bone mass and strength during growth has biologically relevant effects
on skeletal competence in both early and later life (Baxter-Jones et al., 2011). Childhood and
adolescence are periods of rapid bone growth and attaining optimal bone mass during early life
reduces the prevalence of orthopedic diseases such as fracture during childhood, adolescence, and
later life (Ducher and Bass, 2007; Rizzoli et al., 2010). The opinion that obesity has a protective
effect on bone due to the increased mechanical demand imposed by the excessive body weight on
the skeleton has been challenged in recent times (Goulding et al., 2001, 2008; Skaggs et al., 2001;
Sabhaney et al., 2014). Evidence from animal studies heavily favors the hypothesis that obesity may
be detrimental to bone health during growth with several studies reporting an inverse relationship
between excess adiposity, and the mechanical and micro-structural properties of bone (Cao et al.,
2009; Woo et al., 2009; Lorincz et al., 2010; Ionova-Martin et al., 2011; Zhao, 2013; Yan et al., 2015).
Understanding the effects of excessive adiposity on the growing skeleton is essential given the rising
rates of childhood obesity.
 Sontam et al.
Exercise Memory in Obese Rats
Mechanical loading in the form of physical activity and/or
exercise has the ability to influence body composition and bone
properties. Physical activity not only suppresses the accumulation
of fat mass through increased energy expenditure, but also
promotes an anti-inflammatory environment, thereby helping
to reduce chronic low-grade inflammation associated with
excess adiposity (Gleeson et al., 2011). In the bone marrow,
the adipocytes and osteoblasts share a common mesenchymal
progenitor whose lineage commitment can be influenced by
environmental factors (Beresford et al., 1992; Parhami et al., 2001;
David et al., 2007). Studies have reported opposing effects of
high-fat (HF) diet and mechanical stimulation on the lineage
commitment of bone marrow stem cells. For example, an
atherogenic HF diet reduced the ability of marrow stromal cells to
differentiate into osteoblasts in a female mouse model (Parhami
et al., 1999). By contrast, the application of high frequency-
low magnitude mechanical stimuli in mice resulted in a marrow
environment that favored osteogenesis (Luu et al., 2009).
Skeletal loading causes changes in the expression of genes
involved in adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation and function
(David et al., 2007; Menuki et al., 2008). Early studies on
environmental impacts on bone and/or marrow gene expression
have addressed the effects of HF diet or exercise independently
(Xiao et al., 2010; Lange et al., 2013; Sontam et al., 2015a). Yet,
how mechanical loading in the presence of a HF diet modulates
bone marrow gene expression has not been addressed. As such, it
is unclear if the beneficial effects of physical activity are retained
or lost following cessation of an exercise program (Järvinen et al.,
2003; Yasari et al., 2007; Sertie et al., 2013). In the present study,
we determined the changes in bone marrow gene expression that
were associated with early-life (before onset of sexual maturity
at 6 weeks of age; Sengupta, 2013) HF diet accompanied by
voluntary physical activity. In male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats,
we measured the effects of HF diet (45% Kcal from fat) and
voluntary wheel running, before and after puberty, on body
composition, bone mass indices, and gene expression in marrow
isolated from the femur. We identified significant changes in
gene expression and physiological measures. The gene expression
changes were retained but did not prevent rebound obesity in
previously exercised animals. Our results are consistent with the
bone marrow having a unique and long-lasting response to HF
feeding, depending on the presence or absence of exercise.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This study was approved by and carried out in accordance with
the recommendations of the University of Auckland Animal
Ethics Committee (AEC001432). Eighty male weanling rats (aged
22 days) born from normal Sprague-Dawley (SD) dams were
allocated at weaning (controlling for body weight and litter of
origin) into either: (A) a chow-fed group (C-SED; n = 20) which
obtained 18% of total calories from fat (Diet 2018, Teklad Global
18% Protein Rodent Diet, Harlan Teklad, USA) and was allowed
spontaneous movement within standard cages; or (B) a HF-fed
group (n = 60) which obtained 45% of total energy intake from
fat (D12451, Research Diets, USA). The HF-fed group was further
divided into three sub-groups: (1) a HF sedentary (HF-SED, n
= 20) which had only spontaneous movement within the cage
for the duraticon of the experiment; (2) HF late exercise (HF-
LEX, n = 20) group which was allowed spontaneous cage activity
up to D67 and access to a running wheel from D67 to D120;
and (3) a HF early exercise group (HF-EEX, n = 20) which
had access to a running wheel from D22 to D60 (Model 80859,
Lafayette Instrument, Lafayette, IN, USA), and only spontaneous
movement for the remainder of the experiment. All rats were
housed as pairs throughout the study to avoid the stressors
associated with singleton housing (Lin and Scott, 2011). All
animals had ad libitum access to food and water and were housed
in a temperature controlled room (25◦C) with a 12 h light/dark
cycle. Food and water intake was recorded at regular intervals.
“Early-life” is regarded as the period before onset of sexual
maturity, which is around 6 weeks of age; sexual maturity is some
3 weeks before onset of early adulthood (end of the 8th week
of life; Sengupta, 2013). The EEX period was begun at weaning
as physical activity before puberty results in greater and more
persistent bone morphology responses than if exercise begins
after puberty. Finally, the exercise periods differed (i.e., EEX, 38
days; LEX—53 days) to ensure the period of lack of exercise after
cessation of EEX lasted firmly into adulthood in order to test for
a memory.
Wheel exercise data were recorded at 15 min intervals using
dedicated monitoring software (Model 86065). Previous studies
by our group (Sontam et al., 2015b) and others (Holy and Zérath,
2000) observed a distinct circadian pattern in the wheel activity
of young rats. Preliminary analyses of the exercise data confirmed
that the rats in the HF-EEX group used the wheel preferentially
during the dark period (18:00–6:00 h) with minimal activity
during the day. For this reason, only dark period wheel exercise
data were analyzed.
Animals were fasted overnight, anesthetized using sodium
pentobarbitone (60 mg/kg, IP) and culled by decapitation. Five
pairs of rats from each group were culled at either D60 or D120.
Body Composition
Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), using dedicated small
animal software (Lunar Hologic, GE, Waltham, MA, USA),
was performed on animals under light isofluorane anesthesia
to determine the body composition of animals in the week
preceding each cull.
Bone and Marrow Collection
A sterile saw was used to partially saw the left femur at the
junction of: (1) the distal and middle thirds; and (2) the middle
and proximal thirds. The femur was then snapped to obtain the
mid-diaphysis. Bone marrow was isolated from the diaphyseal
bone by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 4◦C, 30 s), and immediately
snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored (−80◦C) until analysis.
Calculation of Bone Marrow Adipocyte
Area
Measurements of adipocyte area were performed on femur
tissue that had been prepared for histology, to test for evidence
of between-group differences in marrow response. This was

not a primary objective or hypothesis of the study and the
post-hoc nature of the measurements meant that we were
unable to measure total adiposity as we did not have the
whole bone available to us. Thus, we were able to quantify
adipocytic size in the metaphysis just inferior (distal) to the
site of RNAseq sampling. Briefly, a Metasystems VSlide scanner
(MetaSystems, Version 2.1.124) running Metafer4 (version 3.9.2)
and coupled with MetaXpress (Molecular Devices, Version
5.3.0.4) was used to image toluidine blue-stained sections
already processed to study joint cartilages. After threshold-
based segmentation of the region immediately distal to the
metaphyseal trabecular bone, images (x20 magnification) were
stitched using the VSlide software, and viewed using Image
Viewer (VSViewer, MetaSystems, Version 2.0). “Snapshot”.tiff
images were processed in ImageJ calibrated to convert pixels into
distance (µm), thresholded (range 228–255), and binarised for
adipocyte identification. Using the “wand” tool within the ROI
manager, 10 adipocytes at random were selected, and the area of
each was measured.
Peripheral Quantitative Computed
Tomography (pQCT)
The length of the right femur was measured (sliding caliper)
from the most distal aspect of the lateral femoral condyle to the
proximal extent of the major trochanter. The bone was lodged
in a plastic tube filled with saline, taking care that no air bubbles
were present, and scanned (XCT Research SA+ pQCT machine,
StratecMedizinTechnik, Pforzheim, Germany). The reference
line was positioned at the distal aspect of the condyles in the
scout view before the machine made one scan at 50 and 19% of
the femoral length, at the diaphysis and metaphysis respectively,
voxel size 70 µm. Outcome measures were chosen to enable
determination of cortical bone density and bone architecture, as
previously described (Gasser, 2012).
RNA Extraction
Bone marrow total RNA was extracted using a modification
of Ayturk et al. (2013). Briefly, bone marrow was ground
into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle cooled in liquid
nitrogen. The frozen bone marrow powder was transferred to a
sterile microcentrifuge tube containing 1 mL TRIzol R
� (#15596-
026, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), mixed thoroughly
by shaking, homogenized by sonication (Bandelin Sonopuls
HD2070, Bandelin, Berlin Germany), and extracted using
TRIzol R
�-chloroform extraction. Total RNA was purified using
an RNeasy Mini Kit (#74104, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and
on-column DNA digestion was performed to remove traces of
genomic DNA (RNase-free DNase Set, #79254, Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). RNA quantity was measured using a QubitTM 3.0
fluorometer with the RNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit (#Q32855,
ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). RNA quality
was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyser (Model 2100; Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). RNA integrity numbers
(RIN) for the samples ranged from 6.1 to 8.0 (Supplementary
Table 3).
RNA-Sequencing
RNA samples were sequenced using an Illumina Hi-seq 4000
(Supplementary Table 3; 150 bp paired end; Novogene, Beijing,
China). For shipping, purified total RNA samples were mixed
with RNAstable R
� in a 96-well plate (#90220-001, Biomatrica,
San Diego, CA, USA) and dried according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
Sequence Read Processing, Alignment,
and Differential Gene Expression Analysis
Sequencing reads were trimmed (phred score < 30 discarded)
using
PRINSEQ
(http://prinseq.sourceforge.net/).
Processed
reads that were <50 bp in length were discarded before further
analyses.
Processed reads were aligned to the rat reference genome
(NCBI
version
Rnor_5.0)
using
TopHat
(version
2.1.0)
(Supplementary Table 1; Trapnell et al., 2009). Gene model
annotations were provided in a GTF file. Differential gene
expression was determined using Cuffdiff (Cufflinks version
2.2.1) (Trapnell et al., 2010). Ten biological replicates from
HF-SED, HF-EEX and HF-LEX conditions and seven biological
replicates from the C-SED condition were sequenced and used
for differential gene expression analysis.
Pathway Analysis
Pathway analysis was performed using the Ingenuity pathway
analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Systems Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA)
software package. Data was uploaded into IPA with the ingenuity
knowledge base as the reference set and a P < 0.05.
IPA was used to identify the biological functions, physiological
processes and diseases associated with the differentially expressed
genes. IPA downstream effects analysis was used to identify
biological functions that were predicted to be up- or down-
regulated based on the observed gene expression changes. An
“activation z-score” of ≥2 or ≤ −2 was taken as significant for
the biological functions that were predicted to be affected by the
treatment (Ingenuity Systems, 2011). A regulatory effects analysis
was performed to identify potential upstream regulators that
explain the observed gene expression changes in the dataset.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 13.0 (SysStat
Software Inc., CA, USA). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was used to identify statistically significant differences between
the groups. The Holm–Sidak method was used to correct for
multiple comparison testing. Where the data failed the equal
variance test, ANOVA on Ranks followed by the Tukey test for
multiple comparisons was used to determine the between-group
differences.

exercise (Supplementary Figure 1). Similarly, body weight gain
until day 60 was significantly increased in all HF-fed groups when
compared to chow-fed controls (Supplementary Figure 2).
The HF-SED and HF-LEX groups were significantly heavier
than C-SED, whereas the HF-EEX group was not different from
C-SED (Table 1). Similarly at day 60 both the total body fat (%)
(Figure 1A) and fat:lean ratio were higher in the HF-SED and
HF-LEX groups compared to C-SED (Table 1). The total body fat
and fat:lean ratio was not different between the C-SED and HF-
EEX groups. Lean mass (%) (Figure 1C) was lower in HF-SED
and HF-LEX groups than in C-SED and HF-EEX groups.
Effect of HF Diet and Early/Late Exercise
on Growth, Caloric Intake, and Body
Composition at Day 120
Both the HF-EEX and HF-LEX groups were fed a HF diet ad-
libitum from weaning until day 120. The HF-EEX group was
allowed running wheel activity from day 23, and there was
a gradual increase in distance completed until day 60 (from
988.59 ± 347.05 m cage−1 night−1 increasing to 9971.97 ±
1933.34 m cage−1 night−1), at which point the running wheels
were removed (Supplementary Figure 3). The HF-LEX group
had wheel access between days 67 and 120. Similar to the HF-
EEX animals, the HF-LEX animals exhibited a gradual increase in
distance covered (from 1377 ± 254 m cage−1 night−1 increasing
to a mean daily distance of 9907 ± 2550 m cage−1 night−1),
followed by a gradual decrease toward the end of the study period
(to 3254 ± 1169 m cage−1 night−1). As expected most activity
(∼98%) occurred during the dark phase of the light cycle.
Following the cessation of exercise, linear body growth in the
HF-EEX group returned to match that of the animals in the HF-
SED group (Supplementary Figure 2). Animals undergoing the
late voluntary exercise protocol exhibited a significant decrease
in body weights compared to animals in the HF-SED and HF-
EEX groups, such that the HF-LEX animals were not different
from those in the C-SED group by day 120. Accordingly, final
body weights at day 120 were significantly higher for animals
in the HF-SED and HF-EEX groups compared to those of the
C-SED and HF-LEX groups (Table 1). This was reflected in a
similar pattern of total body fat (%) (Figure 1B) and fat:lean
ratios (Table 1) which were significantly increased in animals
from the HF-SED and HF-EEX groups when compared to those
from the C-SED and HF-LEX groups. Conversely, relative lean
mass (%) was significantly decreased in HF-SED and HF-EEX
groups compared to C-SED and HF-LEX groups (Figure 1D).
Bone Marrow Adipocyte Area
At D120, animals in the HF-SED group had the largest adipocyte
area (965.76 ± 93.04 µm2). Animals in the C-SED group had
the smallest adipocyte area (782.86 ± 54.89 µm2), while the
adipocyte area for animals in the HF-EEX group (783.03 ±
60.07 µm2) was almost identical to that in the C-SED group. By
contrast, the adipocyte area in animals in the HF-LEX exercise
group (906.74 ± 34.01 µm2) was more similar to that in the
HF-SED animals (Figure 2). The difference in adipocyte area
between the HF-EEX and HF-SED groups approached statistical
significance (p = 0.054).
pQCT-Measured Bone Parameters
There were no differences in total area, periosteal circumference
or endosteal circumference within the mid-diaphysis from the
femurs of any of the groups (Table 2). By contrast, animals
from all of the HF-fed groups (i.e., HF-SED, HF-EEX, and HF-
LEX) had greater cortical thickness and volumetric bone mineral
density (vBMD) than animals from the C-SED group (Table 2).

Similarly, animals from the HF-SED and HF-EEX groups had
significantly higher cortical bone mineral content (BMC) than
animals from the C-SED group (Table 2). Only animals from the
HF-EEX group had significantly increased cortical bone area than
animals from the C-SED group.
In the metaphysis, there was no statistically significant
difference in total BMC between any of the groups (Table 2).
Total vBMD and trabecular vBMD of animals from all three
HF-fed groups (i.e., HF-SED, HF-EEX, and HF-LEX) was
significantly lower than that in animals from the C-SED
group (Table 2). The trabecular bone area in animals from
the HF-SED and HF-EEX groups was significantly larger
than that from animals in the C-SED group, which latter
was not different from those in the HF-LEX group. In
addition, the trabecular area of animals from the HF-EEX
group was greater than that in HF-LEX animals. In the HF-
EEX group total area and trabecular BMC were significantly
higher than observed for animals from the C-SED group,
and trabecular BMC was higher than that in the HF-SED
group also.
The Bone Marrow Gene Expression Profile
of the HF-SED Group Was Pro-Adipogenic
and Pro-Inflammatory
RNA-seq identified 328 genes that were up-regulated and 210
genes that were down-regulated in the HF-SED group when
compared to the C-SED group. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
revealed that genes involved in inflammation, metabolism, and
connective tissue disorders were significantly enriched within the
differentially expressed genes in bone marrow from animals in
the HF-SED group (Table 3). Downstream IPA effects analysis
found that “quantity of adipose tissue” function was positively
activated, based on the direction of changes of the genes in
the dataset (z-score: +1.815; Supplementary Table 1). Genes
belonging to the ontology category “morphology of bone” were
also identified as significantly over-represented in the set of
differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Table 1).
The expression of genes coding for actin alpha 1 (Acta1),
cell death inducing DFFA-like effector C (Cidec), perilipin 1
(Plin1), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1) was up-
regulated more than two-fold in the HF-SED group compared

Graphical representation of mean adipocyte area. There were no statistically significant differences between any of the experimental groups with respect to their bone

to the C-SED group. In contrast to previous reports of an
inverse relationship between adiposity and Adipoq mRNA levels,
we observed higher Adipoq gene expression in the HF-SED
group compared to the C-SED group (Supplementary Table 1).
Among the most significant regulatory networks we identified by
IPA, four were associated with inflammatory pathways (Table 3).
“Activation of T-lymphocytes,” “T cell homeostasis,” and “cell
movement of monocytes” were all predicted to be upregulated in
the bone marrow of HF-SED rats (Figure 3). In addition to their
roles in inflammation, LTB, IL-1β, and CCL5 all have been shown
to participate in bone metabolism (Garrett et al., 1987; Thomson
et al., 1987; Boyce et al., 1989; Yano et al., 2005; Wintges et al.,
2013).
Voluntary Physical Activity Later in Life
Promoted an Anti-Inflammatory
Environment in Bone Marrow
In the HF-LEX group, voluntary physical activity between D67
and D120 combined with lower food intake induced changes
in the D120 bone marrow gene expression. In the D120 bone
marrow samples 179 genes were differentially expressed from
HF-LEX animals when compared to those from HF-SED, with
76 genes upregulated due to the exercise, and 102 genes down-
regulated. Among the five most significantly affected biological
functions and diseases identified by IPA, three were related to
inflammation, and related ontologies (immunological disease,
inflammatory response and inflammatory disease; Table 4). As
observed in the HF-EEX group (Table 3), the most significantly
affected regulatory networks also belonged to the “inflammation”
category. Notably, most genes in the IL2, IL10 inflammatory
regulatory network were down-regulated in the HF-LEX group

promote the expression of RANKL (Ignatius et al., 2011). We
observed a down-regulation of C5aR1 and Oscar transcripts in
the HF-LEX group. Notably, neuropilin 1 (NRP1), which acts
with semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A) to inhibit RANKL-mediated
activation of osteoclasts, was up-regulated in the HF-LEX group
(Hayashi et al., 2012).
Bone Marrow Gene Expression Retained a
Memory of Early-Life Exercise
Compared to the HF-SED group, 128 genes were differentially
regulated (48 up- and 80 down-regulated) in the HF-EEX group,
of which 14 genes showed two-fold or greater up-regulation
while 16 genes showed two-fold or greater down-regulation
(Supplementary Table 2). Genes with roles in adipogenesis and
adipocyte function were down-regulated, and formed the only
regulatory network that was significantly differently expressed
between the HF-EEX and HF-SED conditions (Figure 5).
We also observed differential expression of genes with roles
in both adipocyte and bone metabolism. Crucially, we observed
significant down-regulation of Cdo1 (log ratio: −0.87) and Dlk1
(log ratio: −0.47) in the bone marrow of the HF-EEX compared
to HF-SED group. Our observations thus indicate that the
early-life exercise in the presence of a HF diet influenced gene
expression significantly such that at D120, the gene expression
profile remained different from that in animals only exposed to
a HF diet (HF-SED).
DISCUSSION
How bone marrow modulates gene expression in response to diet
and exercise is not known. In this study, the HF diet resulted in
an obese phenotype by D60 consistent with previous observations
(Zhao, 2013; Doucette et al., 2015; Reynolds et al., 2015).
Continued exposure to the HF diet, through until D120 of life,
was associated with changes in bone micro-architecture and bone
marrow gene expression, including up-regulation of adipocyte
and inflammatory genes, in adult male rats. Voluntary physical
activity early in life was sufficient to cause significant changes
in body composition in HF-fed rats at D60 such that the total
fat percentage, lean mass percentage and fat:lean ratio resembled
that of animals on the control diet. At D120, measures of bone
microarchitecture and gene expression identified a pattern of
gene transcription (i.e., a “transcriptional memory”) of the early-
life exercise that lasted at least 60 days after cessation of wheel

FIGURE 3 | A high-fat diet in early life upregulated genes that promote inflammation in the bone marrow. The regulatory network pictured consists of three tiers. The
top tier consists of predicted upstream regulators that might explain the gene expression changes observed in the experiment. NLRP3 and IRF1 are the upstream
regulators whose predicted activated state may explain the expression changes in LIG4, LTB, PARP1, IL1B, CCL5, and CTSS (middle tier). The observed upregulation
of LIG4, LTB, IL1B, CCL5, and CTSS and the downregulation of PARP1 leads to a predicted increase in T cell homeostasis, activation of T lymphocytes and cell
movement of monocytes (bottom tier).
running activity. However, the transcriptional memory of early-
life exercise did not prevent rebound to the obese phenotype,
by D120, in the absence of continuing voluntary wheel running
exercise.
Transcription levels for genes involved in mature adipocyte
function and lipid metabolism (Adipoq, Cidec, Pck1, and Plin1)
were increased in bone marrow of sedentary animals exposed to
a HF diet. Both Plin1 and Cidec encode proteins that are lipid
droplet-associated and predominantly expressed in adipose tissue
(Konige et al., 2014) control many aspects of lipid metabolism
including lipid droplet size, triglyceride storage, and lipolysis
(Sun et al., 2013; Konige et al., 2014). Up-regulation of Cidec gene
expression in response to a HF diet (60% of total energy from fat)
has been previously reported within epididymal adipose tissue of
wild-type C57B6 mice (Reynolds et al., 2015).
Bone marrow transcript levels from the Adipoq gene showed
up-regulation in response to the HF diet, in contrast to previous
reports of Adipoq gene expression decreasing in perigonadal
white adipose tissue and epididymal fat pads in mice fed HF
diets (Barnea et al., 2006; Bullen et al., 2006). This apparent
contradiction may be due to differences in morphology and
cellular composition of the different tissues (Trubowitz and
Bathija, 1977; Bathija et al., 1979; Griffith et al., 2009), consistent
with Adipoq mRNA and protein levels being significantly greater
in bone marrow adipose than white adipose tissue depots in mice
subjected to caloric restriction (Cawthorn et al., 2014). Therefore,
we conclude that there are bone marrow adipose tissue-specific
changes to Adipoq transcript levels in response to our HF diet.
Hypercaloric-induced obesity is associated with chronic
low-grade
inflammation,
characterized
by
increased
pro-
inflammatory cytokine production (Gregor and Hotamisligil,
2011). Consistent with this, we observed a pro-inflammatory
gene expression profile that included up-regulation of Il-1β,
Ltb, and Ccl5 transcript levels within bone marrow of rats
fed the HF diet. These inflammatory cytokines have roles in
bone metabolism, and IL-1β has been shown to stimulate bone
resorption (Nguyen et al., 1991; Pfeilschifter et al., 2009) in
response to a HF diet (Shu et al., 2015). Similarly, LTB acts
synergistically with TNF-α and IL-1β and is a potent stimulator
of bone resorption (Stashenko et al., 1987). The observed
increases in IL-1β, LTB and other pro-resorptive cytokines (e.g.,
TNF-α and RANKL) are consistent with the HF diet increasing
bone resorption in our animals. However, further confirmation
of this linkage requires empirical testing.
In response to the HF diet there were significant increases in
cortical BMC, cortical vBMD, and trabecular vBMD, consistent
with other reports that showed a positive association between HF
diet and bone mass indices (Ma et al., 2010; Lecka-Czernik et al.,

2015). These most likely resulted from increased mechanical
loading or androgenic factors, while other reports indicate
an inhibitory effect of HF diet associated with effects on the
differences in bone formation and resorption (Lorincz et al.,
2010; Cao and Picklo, 2015; Shu et al., 2015). There were no
exercise-associated between-group differences in cortical bone
mass parameters in the HF-fed animals. Critically, trabecular
bone mass was significantly higher in the HF-EEX group than in
either of the non-exercised groups.
Although, there were no significant phenotypic differences
in the bone micro-architecture as a result of this post-puberty
(D67−120) exercise in the HF animals, compared to the HF-
SED group, this physical activity combined with lower caloric
intake was associated with down-regulation of genes involved
in inflammation, and of genes that promote osteoclastogenesis
(i.e., Csf1r, Ccr1, and C5aR1). Transcript levels for Nrp1,
which is osteoprotective through its enhancing effect on
osteoblast differentiation, were upregulated. As such, post-
puberty voluntary wheel running and lower caloric intake led
to gene expression changes consistent with a reduction in the
production of osteoclasts, which resorb bone, and an increase in
osteoblasts, which produce it.
Voluntary pre-pubertal (D23−60) exercise affected the total fat
and lean mass percentages in animals on a HF diet such that they
were more similar to a control group on a standard chow diet.
However, within 60 days of ceasing voluntary exercise, there was
a return to an obese phenotype such that their total fat and lean
mass percentages were not significantly different from sedentary
animals fed a HF diet. This is consistent with the principle
of training reversibility whereby the physiological adaptations
induced by physical training are partially or completely lost when
the training is stopped or markedly reduced (Mujika and Padilla,
2000). Similar observations of training reversibility have been
observed previously in SD and Wistar rats on HF diets (Yasari
et al., 2007; Sertié et al., 2015).
Pre-pubertal
exercise
was
associated
with
significant
differential transcript levels for 128 genes when compared to
HF-fed sedentary animals. The difference is notable, as these two
groups of animals received identical diets and exercise regimes
between D67 and D120, and gene expression changes in responses
begin hours not days or weeks after novel physical activity
begins. This is consistent with a “programmed” and long-lived
memory of the early-life voluntary exercise.
The mechanism of the memory remains to be determined and
could be due to: (1) sustained changes to the cellular composition
of the bone marrow; or (2) epigenetic changes that are affecting
the program of gene expression. These mechanisms are not
mutually exclusive and it is likely that the memory of the physical
stimuli is retained through a combination of both compositional
and epigenetic changes (Ntanasis-Stathopoulos et al., 2013;
Mar˛
edziak et al., 2015). For example, reductions in bone marrow
fat and increased numbers of mesenchymal stem cells have been
identified in 4-week-old mice trained on a treadmill (Mar˛
edziak
et al., 2015). Moreover, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
undergo changes in their DNA methylation when stimulated by
mechanical signals (Arnsdorf et al., 2010). While the transcript
levels of the mouse Adipoq gene are linked to the obesity-
dependent methylation status of its promoter (Kim et al., 2015),
the ability of mechanical stimulation to influence the epigenetic
profile of Adipoq and subsequent changes in gene expression
has not been established. Future investigations should focus
on the mechanisms through which Aqp7, Gpd1, Plin1, Adipoq,
Fabp4, and Pck1 gene expression is modulated in response to
mechanical stimulation, and for how long after cessation such
modulation persists. Such studies will enable the elucidation of
the mechanism(s) that lead to a memory of early-life exercise,
which appears to offer possibilities to inhibit expression of some
undesirable effects of HF diets on homeostasis in the longer term.
Were such suppression preserved for even longer periods, it may
be possible to attenuate or prevent some aspects of the early life
programming that increase health risks in adulthood.
This study was designed to determine if early-life mild
voluntary activity, as opposed to imposed moderate to high
(and possibly aversive and/or stressful) physical activity, would
have lasting effects on tissues, cells and genes. We used only
male rats, because they are less active than females. Using both
sexes would have increased inter-group variance in at least
some outcome measures, due to sex-dependant differences in
development of bone (Wang et al., 2003) and many other normal
physiological processes ranging from neurodevelopment (Galea
et al., 2013) feeding behavior (Fukushima et al., 2004) voluntary
activity (Rosenfeld, 2017) to exercise-induced physiological
cardiac hypertrophy (Foryst-Ludwig and Kintscher, 2013).
Resource constraint is likely why especially initial studies
cannot be conducted in both sexes concurrently, despite this
obviously being desirable (Krizo and Mintz, 2015). Rats were
housed as pairs, to optimize animal well-being in conformance
with approval procedures, and this limited the correlation of
individual rats’ activity with other outcome measures. Also, we
assumed spontaneous cage activity was similar across the five
cages within a particular group at a particular age, since we lacked
facilities to measure such activity, and this also limited ability to

FIGURE 4 | Physical activity in high-fat fed rats downregulated genes involved in inflammation. The regulatory network that is illustrated consists of three tiers. The top
tier consists of predicted upstream regulators that might explain the gene expression changes observed in the experiment. IL2 and IL10 are the upstream regulators

“generation of cells,” “migration of phagocytes,” “activation,” and “differentiation of leukocytes” (bottom tier).

compare spontaneous cage activity with wheel activity. Now that
we have shown a significant wheel exercise effect, further work is
required to characterize the exercise undertaken in detail.
An unanticipated confounder in the current study was the
reduced caloric intake in the HF-diet fed group that had access
to voluntary exercise between D67 and D120. The combined
effect of the reduction in caloric intake and exercise could be
associated with the similarities in body weight, total fat, and
lean mass percentages of the HF-LEX and chow-fed groups.
However, the HF-fed late exercise group had greater whole body
BMC (Rosenfeld, 2017), cortical and trabecular vBMD, cortical
thickness and total metaphyseal vBMD than was observed in the
chow-fed animals.
The biological significance of the study lies in the significant
differences in gene expression patterns in regulatory pathways
important in the understanding of obesity and its many
effects. Gene expression of particular regulatory pathways was
influenced by the early-life mild voluntary exercise, which was
expected, but the persistence of their exercise-induced gene
expression pattern into adulthood was not. The phenomenon
indicates that some key aspects of the obese phenotype may
be suppressed and others not. For instance, the whole body
composition phenotype reverted to control values after exercise
ceased, redolent of recent reports of the metabolically healthy
obese phenotype (Roberson et al., 2014). This contrasts with the
generally poor success of activity strategies to combat existing
obesity (Marchesini et al., 2016). The nature of the world-wide
obesity epidemic demands exploration of alternative strategies to
reduce morbidity and soaring healthcare costs (Hammond and
Levine, 2010), and assurance of early life activity is likely to be one
with high chances of positive effects, even if limited to particular
aspects of phenotype.
The possible translational significance in terms of human
health is that our observations confirm previous data of early
exercise effects in some rodent studies. The exercise was

voluntary and of mild to moderate intensity. We avoided
imposition of more intensive exercise since this would hardly
be acceptable in strategies designed for encouraging musculo-
skeletal activity in infants and young children, especially those
born small for gestational age or from obese pregnancy, since
such groups are predisposed to obesity and/or less than optimal
bone development (Taylor and Poston, 2007; Chen et al., 2010).
The opportunity for altering gene expression through increased
musculoskeletal activity may be highly time (age)-sensitive
within infancy and childhood, because gene and phenotype
plasticity decline. Lack of detailed knowledge of when and how
various levels of physical activity at young ages may affect
regulation of gene expression is probably why results of exercise
studies in young rodents are conflicting. The translational
opportunity lies in determining which gene regulatory pathways
can be effected by early life physical activity, and the specification
of the physical activity regimens needed to elicit persistent
effects. We conclude that some regulatory pathways related to
preserving or restoring homeostasis in energy metabolism can be
retained, even though whole body phenotype changes induced
by such mild exercise were not retained after early-life exercise
ceased. Aspects of the observed memory of early life exercise are
supportive of both positive and negative consequences for later
life disorders. Therefore, while there is no impact on rebound
adiposity, we contend that the altered immune responses
we observed will impact on future risks of inflammation-
associated disease. Such impacts need to be empirically
confirmed.
