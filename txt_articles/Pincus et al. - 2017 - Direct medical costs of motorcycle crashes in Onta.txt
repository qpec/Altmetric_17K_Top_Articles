otor vehicle safety has improved substantially over the 
past 100 years.1 Between 2000 and 2010, for example, 
deaths related to motor vehicle crashes decreased by 
55.1% in 19 developed countries.1 In contrast, deaths and injuries 
among a subset of those injured in motor vehicle crashes — motor-
cycle crashes — remained stable during the same time period.2
Although medical costs may provide incentive to improve 
motorcycle safety,3–5 there is no reliable estimate of medical costs 
incurred by motorcycle crashes. Previous calculations of medical 
costs attributable to motorcycle crashes are limited to reviews of 
hospital charges at single centres.6 Estimates derived from these 
reviews are incomplete, neglecting costs incurred after a patient’s 
discharge, for example.6–8
It is now possible to calculate patient-level medical costs in 
Ontario, Canada (population 13.6 million in 2014) with methodology 
that links publicly funded health care use to individuals over time.9 
Using this methodology from the payer perspective, our objective 
was to calculate the direct costs of all publicly funded medical care 
provided to individuals who presented to hospital after motorcycle 
crashes compared with automobile crashes. We also examined the 
population incidence of injuries resulting from these crashes. Our 
hypothesis was that medical costs and injury rates attributable to 
motorcycle crashes, which can occur at high speeds and usually 
involve less personal protection, are significantly higher than those 
attributable to automobile crashes.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: There is no reliable esti-
mate of costs incurred by motorcycle 
crashes. Our objective was to calculate 
the direct costs of all publicly funded 
medical care provided to individuals after 
motorcycle crashes compared with 
automobile crashes.
METHODS: We conducted a population-
based, matched cohort study of adults 
in Ontario who presented to hospital 
because of a motorcycle or automobile 
crash from 2007 through 2013. For each 
case, we identified 1 control absent a 
motor vehicle crash during the study 
period. Direct costs for each case and 
control were estimated in 2013 Cana-
dian dollars from the payer perspective 
using methodology that links health 
care use to individuals over time. We 
calculated costs attributable to motor-
cycle and automobile crashes within 2 
years using a difference-in-differences 
approach.
RESULTS: We identified 26 831 patients 
injured in motorcycle crashes and 
281 826 injured in automobile crashes. 
Mean costs attributable to motorcycle 
and automobile crashes were $5825 and 
$2995, respectively (p < 0.001). The rate 
of injury was triple for motorcycle 
crashes compared with automobile 
crashes (2194 injured annually/100 000 
registered motorcycles v. 718 injured 
annually/100 000 registered automo-
biles; incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3.1, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 2.8 to 3.3, p < 
0.001). Severe injuries, defined as those 
with an Abbreviated Injury Scale ≥ 3, 
were 10 times greater (125 severe inju-
ries annually/100 000 registered motor-
cycles v. 12 severe injuries annu-
ally/100 000 registered automobiles; IRR 
10.4, 95% CI 8.3 to 13.1, p < 0.001).
INTERPRETATION: Considering both the 
attributable cost and higher rate of 
injury, we found that each registered 
motorcycle in Ontario costs the public 
health care system 6 times the amount 
of each registered automobile. Medical 
costs may provide an additional incen-
tive to improve motorcycle safety.

Medically necessary health care interactions, provider information 
and demographic characteristics of residents of Ontario are 
recorded in these databases. These data have previously been 
used to estimate medical costs10–15 and study traffic crashes.16–18 
Patients
The study design is shown in Figure 1. Ontario residents who 
presented to the emergency department or were admitted to 
hospital after a motorcycle or automobile crash between Apr. 1, 
2007 and Mar. 31, 2013 were eligible for inclusion. We used 
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) 
codes to identify injured occupants of motor vehicles [motorcy-
cle crash (V20–V29) and automobile crash (V40–V49, V50–V59, 
V70–V79), respectively].19 We excluded non-Ontario residents 
and those who had previously presented to a hospital for a 
motor vehicle–related injury of any type within 2 years before 
the index date (see Appendix 1, Supplementary Appendix B — 
“database codes”).
For each motorcycle or automobile crash case, we identified 1 
control from a representative subset of the Ontario population. 
The purpose of these controls was to determine baseline medical 
costs absent a motor vehicle crash and thus enable the calcula-
tion of incremental costs. Controls had health system contact but 
no documented motor vehicle–related injury during this time 
frame or dating back 2 years before the index date. Index dates 
for controls were randomly assigned based on the distribution of 
index dates for cases in the same fiscal year. Greedy matching 
occurred on age (± 90 d), sex and the logit of a propensity score 
with a caliper of 0.2 × standard deviation20–22 and was calculated 
based on patient comorbidity, income quintile and residential 
location (see “Covariates”).
Covariates
We measured several covariates that have been shown to influ-
ence utilization of health care in Ontario.13 We analyzed age and 
sex as continuous and categorical variables, respectively. 
Comorbidities listed on outpatient and hospital discharge 
abstracts in the 2 years before the index date were categorized 
according to collapsed aggregated diagnosis groups.23 Neigh-
bourhood income quintile was used as a validated surrogate 
measure for socioeconomic status and social deprivation, by 
dissemination area.24–26 Patient location of residence was classified 
according to the Local Health Integrated Network and the Rurality 
Index of Ontario.27
Outcomes
The primary outcome of this study was direct medical costs 
within 2 years that were attributable to motorcycle and auto-
mobile crashes, and paid by Ontario’s Ministry of Health and 
Long-Term Care. First, medical costs were calculated for each 
case and each control during each fiscal year of the study 
period using established patient-level costing methodology 
(see Appendix 1, Supplementary Appendix A).9 We then calcu-
lated costs attributable to motorcycle and automobile crashes 
within 2 years using a difference-in-differences approach: a 
baseline cost accrued the year before a crash was subtracted 
from costs in the first and second year after the crash (first dif-
ference) and then compared with the same difference among 
controls (second difference).28
We categorized costs as acute care hospital, including the 
emergency department, index admission, rehabilitation and any 
subsequent readmissions; physician; drugs and laboratory costs 
outside of hospitals; continuing care including residential long-
term care and home care; and assistive devices.18 We divided care 
episodes that spanned more than 1 fiscal year on a pro rata basis. 
All costs were expressed as 2013 Canadian dollars using the 
health care component of the Ontario Consumer Price Index 
(www.statscan.gc.ca).
We included clinical data in secondary outcomes. First, the 
annual rates of those injured and dying (within 30 d) from motor-
cycle and automobile crashes were reported, as long as the 
patient presented to hospital after the crash. We also compared 
more detailed clinical data between motorcycle and automobile 
crash cases. We identified the highest level of care required for

attributable to motorcycle crashes and automobile crashes were then calculated using a difference-in-differences approach: the baseline cost accrued 
the year before the motorcycle or automobile crash was subtracted from costs in the 1st and 2nd year following the collision (1st difference) and then 
compared with the same difference among controls (2nd difference).

each patient: emergency department visit only, or hospital 
admission, or admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The 
Injury Severity Score (ISS) and Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 
were used to assess injury severity. ISS and AIS were obtained 
from ICD-10 codes by means of a validated algorithm.29 Injury 
Severity Score was categorized as < 9, 9–15, 16–24 or ≥ 25. We 
defined “severe injuries” as those with an AIS ≥ 3 and we 
reported them overall and for each anatomic region. The algo-
rithm and operational definitions have been used previously in 
population-based research on administrative data in Ontario.30–32
Statistical analysis
We reported baseline characteristics of cases and controls as 
means and proportions and compared them using standardized 
differences (> 0.1 considered indicative of imbalance).33,34 We also 
compared characteristics between motorcycle crash cases and 
automobile crash cases using independent sample t tests for con-
tinuous variables and χ2 tests for categorical variables. We also 
compared longer-term costs (up to 5 yr) between matched cases 
and controls who were enrolled before the 2011 fiscal year and for 
whom longer-term follow-up (> 2 yr) was available. We expressed 
annual rates of injuries and deaths per 100 000 registered motorcy-
cles or automobiles in the province using publicly available data 
from the Ministry of Transportation (see Appendix 1, Supplemen-
tary Appendix C).2 Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) were then used to compare injury and death rates 
between motorcycle and automobile crash cases. We performed 
all analyses using SAS software (SAS version 9.3 and SAS Enter-
prise Guide version 6.1; SAS Institute) and set the type I error prob-
ability to 0.05.
Ethics approval
The research protocol was approved by the Research Ethics 
Board at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.
Results
Descriptive clinical data
We identified 26 831 people in Ontario who were injured dur-
ing the study period in motorcycle crashes and 281 826 who 
were injured in automobile crashes. The annual incidence of 
injured persons was triple for motorcycle compared with 
automobile crashes (2194 injured annually/100 000 registered 
motorcycles v. 718 injured annually/100 000 registered auto-
mobiles; IRR 3.1, 95% CI 2.8 to 3.3, p < 0.001; Table 1). Deaths 
(at 30 d) were about 5 times greater (14 deaths annu-
ally/100 000 registered motorcycles v. 3 deaths annu-
ally/100 000 registered automobiles; IRR 4.7, 95% CI 2.9 to 7.6, 
p < 0.001; Table 1).
In terms of the level of care required for each patient, those 
injured in motorcycle crashes were significantly more likely to 
require admission to hospital and the ICU than those injured in 
automobile crashes (11.93% v. 4.24%, p < 0.001 and 2.31% v. 
1.09%, p < 0.001, respectively). Patients injured in motorcycle 
crashes were also more likely to have an ISS greater than 16 
(3.67% v. 1.32%, p < 0.001) and have severe injuries (5.69% v. 
1.67% with AIS ≥ 3, p < 0.001). Expressed per registered vehicle, 
severe injuries were 10 times greater for motorcycle crashes than 
automobile crashes (125 severe injuries annually/100 000 regis-
tered motorcycles v. 12 severe injuries annually/100 000 regis-
tered automobiles; IRR 10.4, 95% CI 8.3 to 13.1, p < 0.001). Severe 
injuries to the head, thorax, abdomen and extremities were all 
more common among patients injured in motorcycle than in 
automobile crashes (Table 2).
Baseline characteristics after matching
There were 26 257 motorcycle crash cases and 276 760 automo-
bile crash cases (≅ 98%) matched to controls. Covariates were 
balanced between cases and controls, with the exception that 
patients who had been in motorcycle crashes were more likely 
to reside in rural areas than controls. Baseline utilization of 
health care, as measured by costs in the previous year, was simi-
lar between cases and controls, which also indicated that 
groups were comparable (mean standardized difference [MSD] 
previous-year costs for motorcycle crash cases and controls 
were $1779.76 [$7003.45] and $1664.34 [$8732.5], MSD 0.02; 
automobile crash cases and controls $2385.69 [$8223.62] and 
$2314.57 [$9420.75], MSD 0.01).

The mean age of people (mean age ± standard deviation 36.08 
± 16.34 yr) injured in motorcycle crashes was less than those 
injured in automobile crashes (mean age 38.53 ± 19.09 yr) (p < 
0.001). A greater proportion of patients who were in motorcycle 
crashes was also men (81% male) compared with patients who 
were in automobile crashes (43% male) (p < 0.001). Other base-
line characteristics and average costs among cases and controls 
after matching are presented in Appendix 1, Supplementary 
Appendix E.
Patient-level costs of health care
Mean costs for medical treatment attributable to motorcycle 
and automobile crashes within 2 years of the crash were 
$5825 and $2995 (p < 0.001), respectively. Hospital costs for 
acute care accounted for more than 75% of this amount for 
both motorcycle and automobile crashes (Table 3). Further-
more, most costs were accrued within 1 year of the injury 
date. Attributable costs declined thereafter for both motorcy-
cle and automobile crashes and remained stable and similar 
up to 5 years after the injury date (Appendix 1, Supplementary 
Appendix D).
Interpretation
In this population-based study of patients in the most populous 
Canadian province, we measured the cost of health care pro-
vided to patients who were injured in a motorcycle or automo-
bile crash and required treatment at hospital. Mean costs for 
medical treatment attributable to motorcycle and automobile 
crashes within 2 years were $5825 and $2995, respectively. 
Because the annual number of injured persons per registered 
vehicle was triple and costs per injury were double for motorcy-
cle crash victims versus automobile crash victims, we estimate 
the total cost to the universal health care system of injuries sus-
tained in motor vehicles to be about 6 times greater per regis-
tered motorcycle than per automobile. Because acute care 
accounted for more than 75% of the costs, severe injuries 
(AIS ≥ 3) that were 10 times greater for motorcycles than for 
automobiles likely accounted for the additional costs incurred 
by motorcycle crashes. All rates in our study could also be multi-
plied by 5 and expressed per kilometre travelled because the 
average automobile travels 5 times the distance of the average 
motorcycle (i.e., 15 times the injuries, 50 times the severe inju-

ries, 25 times the deaths, 30 times the costs per kilometre 
travelled).35
Limitations
Although our methodology captured most (an estimated 92%) 
publicly funded health care costs provided to Ontario residents 
who were injured in motorcycle and automobile crashes,18 the 
most important limitation of our cost calculations was our inabil-
ity to capture ongoing care costs for patients requiring outpa-
tient rehabilitation, such as those with acquired brain injury. 
Accordingly, our cost calculations were less comprehensive over 
time as patients, and their care, were moved from the hospital 
setting and into the community. Because those involved in 
motorcycle crashes are considerably more likely to sustain head 
trauma8,36,37 and severe injuries in general, this limitation under-
estimated only costs attributable to motorcycle crashes com-
pared with those costs incurred by automobile crashes (Table 2). 
Similarly, we also did not capture direct costs borne by private 
insurance, or indirect or opportunity costs incurred by individual 
patients and society. Indirect costs from missed workdays and 
permanent disability that precluded the ability to earn, for exam-
ple, may also have been greater after motorcycle than automo-
bile crashes, because motorcycle crash patients were younger 
and more severely injured.
Our data also do not include those injured or killed at the 
scene and who were not transported to hospital because we 
 
identified only patient encounters with health care providers. 
Because we identified only each patient’s first event, it is also 
important to point out that injury rates reported in this study do 
not include subsequent crashes, if a patient had more than one.
Implications
We found that motorcycle injuries cost the public health care 
system 6 times more than automobile injuries, per vehicle. 
Expressed in other terms, Ontario’s health care payer (the 
Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care) would expect to save 
$13.5 million per year if collision rates remained unchanged 
and the province’s registered motorcycles were replaced with 
automobiles. This estimate is likely conservative for several 
reasons mentioned previously (see “Limitations”).
Despite publicly available data indicating that the risk associated 
with driving a motorcycle is much greater than that associated with 
driving an automobile, this knowledge has not translated to 
improvements in motorcycle safety.2,35 Medical costs may provide a 
novel financial incentive to mitigate the risk of motorcycle crashes. 
Anecdotally, insurance companies that raise their rates in response 
to private medical costs have already acted as a deterrent to motor-
cycle use.38 Health care costs incurred by the Ministry of Health and 
Long-Term Care in Ontario in treating patients involved in motor 
vehicle crashes (including motorcycle crashes) may be recovered, at 
least in part, by the Government of Ontario under the province’s 
Insurance Act. This study provides an estimate of costs that may be 
recovered from motorcycle insurers under this legislation. The higher 
costs and greater incidence of severe injury and death we observed 
may also warrant other improvements to health prevention mea-
sures. For example, supplementary private health care insurance, an 
excise tax or another novel method of health coverage for motorcy-
clists may be justified with the goal of improving motorcycle safety.
We conducted our study at the level of a health care system that 
serves a population of about 13.6 million people. Although exact 
health care costs vary in other health care systems, the conclusions 
drawn from the relative comparison of motorcycle to automobile 
crashes we found in our study may be applicable beyond Canada to 
the rest of the developed world. For example, in a privately funded 
health care system, insurance companies and individual providers 
may accept a larger share of the direct health care costs than we 
have estimated in this study. We  captured all hospital and physician 
costs provided in Ontario’s publicly funded health care system.
Conclusion
We found that each motorcycle incurs 3 times the injuries, 6 times 
the medical costs and 5 times the deaths of each automobile. An 
understanding of these consequences may play a key role in public 
health strategy aimed at improving motorcycle safety. Future 
research is required to investigate indirect or opportunity costs 
incurred by motorcycle crashes.
