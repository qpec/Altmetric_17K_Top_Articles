The rapid spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with abnormal
brain development constitute a global health emergency. Congenital
ZIKV infection produces a range of mild to severe pathologies,
including microcephaly. To understand the pathophysiology of ZIKV
infection, we used models of the developing brain that faithfully
recapitulate the tissue architecture in early to midgestation. We
identify the brain cell populations that are most susceptible to ZIKV
infection in primary human tissue, provide evidence for a mechanism
of viral entry, and show that a commonly used antibiotic protects
cultured brain cells by reducing viral proliferation. In the brain, ZIKV
preferentially infected neural stem cells, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte
precursor cells, and microglia, whereas neurons were less susceptible
to infection. These findings suggest mechanisms for microcephaly and
other pathologic features of infants with congenital ZIKV infection
that are not explained by neural stem cell infection alone, such as
calcifications in the cortical plate. Furthermore, we find that blocking
the glia-enriched putative viral entry receptor AXL reduced ZIKV
infection of astrocytes in vitro, and genetic knockdown of AXL in a
glial cell line nearly abolished infection. Finally, we evaluate 2,177
compounds, focusing on drugs safe in pregnancy. We show that the
macrolide antibiotic azithromycin reduced viral proliferation and virus-
induced cytopathic effects in glial cell lines and human astrocytes. Our
characterization of infection in the developing human brain clarifies
the pathogenesis of congenital ZIKV infection and provides the basis
for investigating possible therapeutic strategies to safely alleviate
or prevent the most severe consequences of the epidemic.
Zika virus | cortical development | azithromycin | microcephaly
A
correlation between congenital exposure to the mosquito-
borne and sexually transmitted Zika flavivirus (ZIKV) and
the increased incidence of severe microcephaly suggests a causal
relationship between ZIKV infection and neurodevelopmental
abnormalities (1, 2). However, the mechanisms of infection and
specifically which cell populations are vulnerable to ZIKV during
the course of human brain development remain unclear. Major
insights have been drawn from in vitro models of human brain
development and primary mouse tissues. In the developing mouse
brain, ZIKV has been shown to infect radial glia and neurons (3),
whereas studies in human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived
neural cells have highlighted widespread infection and apoptosis
of neural progenitor cells (4, 5). Because these models do not fully
recapitulate the developmental events and cell types present
during human brain development, these results may not faithfully
represent ZIKV-induced pathology in vivo.
During human brain development, radial glial cells, the neural
stem cells, give rise to diverse types of neuronal and glial cells,
including neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, in a tempo-
rally controlled pattern. We reasoned that identifying cell types
that are especially vulnerable to viral infection would facilitate
studies of the viral life cycle, including entry mechanisms and host
cell requirements. Building on studies that suggested that enriched
expression of the candidate entry factor AXL could confer vul-
nerability to ZIKV entry (6–8), we used AXL expression levels to
predict that radial glia, astrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells
would be particularly vulnerable to infection (9). A recent study
highlighted the utility of ex vivo models using primary human tis-
sue samples to analyze the consequences of ZIKV infection in the
human prenatal brain (7). Here we further use primary tissue
samples from distinct stages of brain development corresponding
to periods of peak neurogenesis and early gliogenesis.
Determining the tropism of ZIKV for specific cell types will
help identify suitable cellular models for investigating potential
therapeutic interventions. Although development of a vaccine
could provide a long-term solution to the current ZIKV epidemic,
there remains an unmet clinical need to identify drugs that can
limit or prevent the consequences of congenital infection. A recent
screen of a subset of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved compounds against ZIKV in hepatic cells identified
several anticancer, antimicrobial, antiparasitic, and antifungal
drugs with anti-ZIKV activity (10). Another screen, based on hu-
man neural progenitor cells, identified an antifungal drug and
Significance
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has rapidly
spread through the Americas and has been associated with fetal
abnormalities, including microcephaly. To understand how micro-
cephaly develops, it is important to identify which cell types of
the developing brain are susceptible to infection. We use primary
human tissue to show that radial glia and astrocytes are more
susceptible to infection than neurons, a pattern that correlates with
expression of a putative viral entry receptor, AXL. We also perform
a screen of Food and Drug Administration-approved compounds,
with an emphasis on drugs known to be safe in pregnancy. We
identify an antibiotic, azithromycin, that reduces viral proliferation
in glial cells, and compare its activity with daptomycin and sofos-
buvir, two additional drugs with anti-ZIKV activity.

 several scaffold compounds for further development (11). How-
ever, the majority of compounds with anti-ZIKV activity from these
screens are contraindicated or of unknown safety during pregnancy.
Furthermore, two promising candidates that might be safe during
pregnancy, daptomycin and sofosbuvir, showed variable effective-
ness by cell type (7, 10, 12). Combining unbiased screens of ap-
proved compounds with comparisons of top candidates with known
antiviral activity may quickly narrow the search for drugs that could
mitigate the effects of congenital ZIKV infection.
Here we assessed ZIKV cell tropism in the developing human
brain and performed a drug screen on relevant cell types targeted by
the virus with an emphasis on drugs known to be safe in pregnancy.
We found that radial glia and, later in development, astrocytes were
especially vulnerable to ZIKV infection. By screening FDA-approved

 compounds for anti-ZIKV activity in a glial cell line with features of
both cell types, we also found that the common antibiotic azithromycin
prevented viral production and virus-mediated cell death, which we
further validated in human astrocytes.
Results
To determine the cell populations most susceptible to ZIKV in-
fection, we investigated the infectivity of ZIKV in the developing
human brain using organotypic cultures from primary human tis-
sue. We exposed human cortical tissue slices to three strains of
ZIKV: Cambodia 2010 (ZIKV-CAM), Brazil 2015 (ZIKV-BR),
and Puerto Rico 2015 (ZIKV-PR), cultured them for 72 h, and
detected infection by immunostaining for the flavivirus envelope
protein (ENV), an approach we validated in cultured cells (Fig.
S1). Infection in tissue was confirmed by immunostaining for the
viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nonstructural protein
5 (NS5), present only during viral replication. In samples from
midneurogenesis [13 to 16 postconception wk (pcw)], we observed
high rates of infection in the ventricular and subventricular zones
(Fig. 1 and Fig. S2). We found that the virus preferentially infected
both ventricular and outer radial glial cells (Fig. 1 A–F and Fig. S2).
Interestingly, we observed clusters of infected radial glia (Fig. S2B),
which may reflect local viral spread. A minor fraction of cells pos-
itive for ENV at these stages included postmitotic neurons (Fig. 1H)
and microglia (Fig. 1I). We observed similar patterns of infection
across ZIKV strains (Fig. S2). We also observed a small but sig-
nificant increase in cell death of ENV+ cells compared with ENV−
cells in ZIKV-infected or mock-infected tissue (Fig. S3).
At later stages of development (after 17 pcw), we observed in-
fection and viral replication throughout the developing cortex,
including the cortical plate and subplate, with production of in-
fectious virus by 48 h postinfection (hpi) (Fig. 2 and Fig. S4).
Among cortical plate cells, we observed a high rate of infection in
astrocytes, as distinguished by their location, morphology, and im-
munoreactivity with the glial markers GFAP and SOX2 (Fig. 2 A,
B, and D and Fig. S4 A–D). We also observed cells immunoreactive
for both ENV and the microglial marker IBA1, indicating micro-
glial infection or phagocytosis of other ZIKV-infected cells (Fig. 2F
and Fig. S4 G and H). This ENV+/IBA1+ microglial population was
quantified at 7 ± 1% of ENV+ cells, and represented 7 ± 2% of the
total IBA1+ population (n = 4, 15 to 22 pcw; SI Materials and
Methods). We further observed infection of oligodendrocyte pre-
cursor cells (Fig. 2G and Fig. S4I) but limited infection of neurons
(Fig. 2 B and D and Fig. S4 A and J). This pattern of infectivity was
consistent across ZIKV strains (Fig. S4), and matched viral tropism
predicted by AXL receptor expression (9).
To test the possible role of AXL in mediating ZIKV entry into
human astrocytes, we infected hPSC-derived astrocytes (13, 14) in
the presence of a nonactivating antibody specific for the extra-
cellular domain of AXL. Blocking the AXL receptor substantially
reduced infection (Fig. 2 I and J and Fig. S5A). To further test the
requirement of AXL for ZIKV infection of glial cells, we used the
U87 glioblastoma line that expresses high levels of astrocyte
marker genes and AXL (15). U87 cells were readily infected with
ZIKV, with strong virus production at 48 hpi (Fig. S1) and robust
cytopathic effect at 72 hpi (Fig. 3C and Fig. S6D). We then used
CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to knock down AXL in this cell
line (SI Materials and Methods; validated by Western blot in Fig.
S5B) and observed a substantial decrease in infection (Fig. 2K),
confirming the importance of this receptor for ZIKV infection in
this cell type. Given that AXL is a receptor tyrosine kinase with
signaling pathways that could be involved in innate immune re-
sponses (16), we tested whether the kinase activity of AXL was
relevant for the decrease in infection observed in the knockdown
line. After pretreatment with a small-molecule inhibitor, R428, we
observed no decrease in infection at up to 1 μM, which is >70-fold
the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) for AXL kinase
inhibition (Fig. S5C) (17). Although we did observe a decrease
in infection at 3 μM R428, this high concentration of >200-fold
the EC50 likely created off-target effects. Together, these results
suggest that AXL has an important role in glial cell infection that

Azithromycin treatment inhibits ZIKV infection in glial cells. (A) U87
cells were treated with increasing concentrations of AZ and infected with ZIKV-
PR at varying MOIs (0.01, 0.1, and 3, as indicated). The percentage of infected
cells at 48 hpi was determined by flow cytometry of cells immunostained for
ENV and normalized to untreated cells (for raw data, see Fig. S6A). EC50 values
for AZ-mediated reduction of ZIKV infection were 5.1 μM for an MOI of 3 (n =

 depends more on its extracellular domain than on its intracellular
kinase activity.
There is a pressing need to identify pharmacological com-
pounds that can diminish the effects of ZIKV infection in rel-
evant human cell types. We performed a screen of 2,177
clinically approved compounds (2,016 unique) by monitoring
inhibition of virus-dependent cell death at 72 hpi in Vero cells.
Although our screen revealed compounds that rescued cell vi-
ability, including antibiotics and inhibitors of nucleotide and
protein synthesis, many showed toxicity in Vero or U87 cells or
are contraindicated during pregnancy (Tables S1–S4). We fo-
cused on further characterization of the macrolide antibiotic
azithromycin (AZ), which rescued ZIKV-induced cytopathic
effect with low toxicity in our primary screens and is generally
safe during pregnancy (18). AZ dramatically reduced ZIKV
infection of U87 cells at an EC50 of 2 to 3 μM at multiplicities
of infection (MOIs) of 0.01 to 0.1, as evaluated by ENV staining
(Fig. 3 A and B and Fig. S6A). We further established a re-
lationship between EC50 and baseline infection rate (Fig. S6B)
and showed that even at >60% infection, AZ consistently re-
duced infection at concentrations 10- to 20-fold below the half-
maximal toxicity concentration (TC50) of 53 μM (Fig. S6 A and
C). AZ treatment also rescued cell viability (Fig. 3C and Fig.
S6D) and decreased viral production (Fig. 3D). Finally, we
found that AZ substantially reduced infection in hPSC-derived
astrocytes without toxicity at the effective concentration (EC50
15 μM at 72% baseline infection) (Fig. S6 E–G). To compare
AZ with compounds identified in previous screens, we evaluated
the anti-ZIKV activity of daptomycin and sofosbuvir in U87 cells
(EC50 2.2 and 12.4 μM, respectively) (Fig. S6H). We observed that
treatment with daptomycin was insufficient to lower the percent-
age of infected cells below 46% even at the highest dose in this
cell type (20 μM) (Fig. S6H), whereas AZ and sofosbuvir treat-
ment decreased ZIKV infection from 78 to below 5% infection
at 20 and 50 μM, respectively. These results highlight AZ as a
potential tool compound against ZIKV infection in glial cells.
Discussion
The rapid spread of ZIKV and its link to fetal abnormalities, including
microcephaly, have created a global health crisis. Understanding viral
tropism for specific cell types in the developing brain furthers our
understanding of the pathophysiology of ZIKV-associated micro-
cephaly and provides a basis for investigating antiviral drugs in a rel-
evant cell type. Our findings offer several novel aspects. In particular,
we show ZIKV tropism for astrocytes in addition to radial glia in the
primary developing human brain, demonstrate the importance of
AXL for ZIKV infection of glial cells, and identify a common anti-
biotic with anti-ZIKV activity, AZ, which we compare with two other
drugs with anti-ZIKV activity that may be safe in pregnancy.
Our finding that radial glia are preferentially infected during
early neurogenesis is consistent with experiments in cultured pri-
mary human brain cells (19), developing mouse cortex (3, 20), and
primary human organotypic brain slice culture (7). These studies
also reported overall survival of infected radial glia, in contrast to
in vitro derived neural stem cells that undergo apoptotic cell death
following infection (4, 5, 21). Cell lines derived from primary neural
progenitors have variably shown infection with substantial apoptosis
(7) or persistence (19). In our organotypic slice culture, we observe a
small increase in apoptosis of infected cells. The discrepancy in
levels of apoptosis in dissociated versus tissue cell culture may reflect
differences in gene expression, maturation, or experimental condi-
tions. Besides causing cell death, ZIKV infection could also affect
cell-cycle progression (3, 21), differentiation, or the migration and
survival of newborn neurons—mechanisms thought to underlie genetic
causes of microcephaly and lissencephaly (22). Tissue disorganization
in organotypic slice culture suggests these non–cell death-mediated
mechanisms may contribute to clinical phenotypes (7), but this re-
mains to be confirmed by directly analyzing cell behavior.
The high rate of infection in astrocytes at later developmental
ages, many of which contact microcapillaries, could link our un-
derstanding of initial infection with clinical findings of cortical
plate damage. For example, after prolonged infection, viral pro-
duction in astrocytes could lead to a higher viral load in the cor-
tical plate, causing infection of additional cortical cell types, and
astrocyte loss could lead to inflammation and further damage,
even in uninfected cells. Widespread cell death in vivo, which may
take days to weeks to occur and is therefore outside the time
frame of our experimental paradigm, is expected, given clinical
reports of band-like calcifications in the cortical plate, cortical
thinning, and hydrocephalus (2, 23). On the basis of their sus-
ceptibility to ZIKV infection and a central role in brain tissue
homeostasis, human astrocytes provide a good cellular model for
further investigation of mechanisms of viral entry and a platform
for testing the efficacy of candidate therapeutic compounds.
Our observation that blocking or knocking down the AXL re-
ceptor prevents infection of human astrocytes, but that blocking
intracellular kinase activity does not, suggests that the extracellular
domain of AXL contributes to ZIKV infection whereas AXL
signaling is dispensable. This extends comparable findings in en-
dothelial cells to a cell type relevant for understanding micro-
cephaly (6, 8) but does not address other viral receptors that may
be important for ZIKV infectivity in other cell types or rule out a
role for AXL signaling in the context of a full immune response
in vivo. Although AXL knockout mice can be readily infected with
ZIKV, disruption of the blood–brain barrier in these mice could
lead to atypical routes for infection of the brain (24).
In addition to characterizing brain cell tropism, we also sought to
identify possible therapeutic candidates with known safety profiles,
especially in pregnancy. Several compounds expected to inhibit
ZIKV were identified by our drug screen. These positive controls
include the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, nucleic acid
synthesis inhibitors such as mycophenolate derivatives, and inter-
calating compounds such as doxorubicin and homidium bromide.
We additionally identified compounds that are known to be safe in
pregnancy, including AZ. AZ is recommended for the treatment of
pregnant women with sexually transmitted infections or respiratory
infections due to AZ-susceptible bacteria (25, 26). Adverse events
have not been observed in animal reproduction studies, and studies
in pregnant women show no negative effects on pregnancy out-
come or fetal health associated with AZ (18, 27). Orally adminis-
tered AZ has been shown to reach concentrations of ∼2.8 μM in
the placenta, and is rapidly transported to amniotic fluid and
umbilical cord plasma in humans (28, 29). Moreover, AZ accu-
mulates in fetal tissue and in the adult human brain at concen-
trations from 4 to 21 μM (30, 31). Together, these pharmacokinetic
studies suggest that AZ could rapidly accumulate in fetal tissue,
including the placenta in vivo, at concentrations comparable to
those that inhibit ZIKV proliferation in culture. Nonetheless, it
remains unknown whether these in vitro results would be re-
capitulated in humans.
We further compared AZ with two promising drug candidates
that might be safe in pregnancy and have reported anti-ZIKV
activity in cell culture: daptomycin and sofosbuvir. Our dose–
response curves are in agreement with the documented activity of
sofosbuvir in human neuroepithelial stem cells (7), and extend the
activity of daptomycin previously seen in HuH-7 and HeLa cells
(10) to glial cells. We noted that daptomycin would not have been
highly ranked in our initial screen due to the limited maximum
effect of the drug as observed in dose–response curves. Unlike
sofosbuvir, which likely targets the ZIKV RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (NS5) based on its mechanism against hepatitis
C virus, daptomycin and AZ have unknown mechanisms of
action against ZIKV. Nonetheless, the difference in in vitro dose–
response between AZ and daptomycin is intriguing, and suggests
different mechanisms of inhibition. Another important factor for
a drug candidate for ZIKV treatment is accessibility. Access to

Retallack et al.
 sofosbuvir and its derivatives may be limited by its current price
whereas AZ and daptomycin are available as generic forms, al-
though daptomycin is not available in oral formulation due to poor
oral bioavailability. Our comparison adds new data to consider
alongside other antiviral activity data, safety, cost, and accessibility
in moving forward with further exploration of these and related
compounds. In parallel with direct comparisons in vitro, follow-up
studies in animal models can be useful for prioritizing candidates.
However, as with in vitro studies, there are caveats in interpreting
animal models, such as substantial differences between human
and mouse immune systems, placental structure, and fetal brain
development.
Together, our work identifies cell type-specific patterns of ZIKV
infection in second-trimester human developing brain, provides
experimental evidence that AXL is important for ZIKV infection
of relevant human brain cell types, and highlights a common
antibiotic with inhibitory activity against ZIKV in glial cells.
Ongoing studies will be required to determine whether AZ,
daptomycin, sofosbuvir, and other inhibitors or combinations
are capable of reducing ZIKV infection in the critical cell types
identified here in vivo. Although preventative measures such as
mosquito abatement and a ZIKV vaccine are imperative for
long-term control of this pathogen, the study of ZIKV infection
of primary human tissues and identification of inhibitors with
therapeutic potential remain important components of a global
response to this emerging threat.
Materials and Methods
Detailed materials and methods are available in SI Materials and Methods.
Cells and Viruses. Cell lines were Vero cells, U87 cells, and human astrocytes
derived from human pluripotent stem cells (13). ZIKV strains were SPH2015
(Brazil 2015; ZIKV-BR), PRVABC59 (Puerto Rico 2015; ZIKV-PR), and FSS13025
(Cambodia 2010; ZIKV-CAM).
Brain Samples. Deidentified primary tissue samples were collected with pre-
vious patient consent in strict observance of the legal and institutional ethical
regulations. Protocols were approved by the Human Gamete, Embryo and
Stem Cell Research Committee (institutional review board) at the University
of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Slices in organotypic culture were
inoculated with ZIKV or mock-infected, fixed at 72 hpi or 5 d postinfection,
and processed for immunohistochemistry. Quantification was performed on
13- to 22-pcw slices.
AXL. For 1 h before infection, cells were treated with AXL-blocking antibody or
goat IgG control at 100 μg/mL, or with 1 to 3 μM R428 or vehicle (<0.1%
DMSO). For AXL knockdown, U87 cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB (15) were
transduced with lentiviral particles expressing a pool of gRNAs targeting AXL
or a gRNA targeting GFP as a control.
Drug Screen. A collection of 2,177 FDA-approved compounds, provided by the
UCSF Small Molecule Discovery Center, was tested at 2 μM in Vero cells in-
fected with ZIKV-BR (MOIs of 1, 3, and 10) and in U87 cells (MOI of 3).
Toxicity screens in uninfected cells were performed in parallel. Cells were
pretreated for 2 h before addition of ZIKV-BR or media, and cell viability was
assessed at 72 hpi using the CellTiter-Glo 2.0 assay (Promega). Candidates
with cell viability >2.5-fold that of untreated cells in every Vero cell screen
were identified for follow-up.
Drug Validation. U87 cells or hPSC-derived astrocytes were treated with azi-
thromycin, daptomycin, sofosbuvir, or vehicle for >1 h, and then infected with
ZIKV-PR. Cell-viability assays were performed using CellTiter-Glo as above. To
assess viral envelope production, cells were fixed and stained at 48 hpi using
anti-flavivirus envelope protein, and then quantified by plate imaging with
automated cell counting or by flow cytometry.
