Effects of fluoxetine on functional outcomes after acute 
stroke (FOCUS): a pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, 
controlled trial
FOCUS Trial Collaboration*
Summary
Background Results of small trials indicate that fluoxetine might improve functional outcomes after stroke. The 
FOCUS trial aimed to provide a precise estimate of these effects.
Methods FOCUS was a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel group, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial 
done at 103 hospitals in the UK. Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had a clinical stroke diagnosis, 
were enrolled and randomly assigned between 2 days and 15 days after onset, and had focal neurological deficits. 
Patients were randomly allocated fluoxetine 20 mg or matching placebo orally once daily for 6 months via a web-based 
system by use of a minimisation algorithm. The primary outcome was functional status, measured with the modified 
Rankin Scale (mRS), at 6 months. Patients, carers, health-care staff, and the trial team were masked to treatment 
allocation. Functional status was assessed at 6 months and 12 months after randomisation. Patients were analysed 
according to their treatment allocation. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN83290762.
Findings Between Sept 10, 2012, and March 31, 2017, 3127 patients were recruited. 1564 patients were allocated fluoxetine 
and 1563 allocated placebo. mRS data at 6 months were available for 1553 (99∙3%) patients in each treatment group. The 
distribution across mRS categories at 6 months was similar in the fluoxetine and placebo groups (common odds ratio 
adjusted for minimisation variables 0∙951 [95% CI 0∙839–1∙079]; p=0∙439). Patients allocated fluoxetine were less likely 
than those allocated placebo to develop new depression by 6 months (210 [13∙43%] patients vs 269 [17·21%]; difference 
3∙78% [95% CI 1∙26–6∙30]; p=0∙0033), but they had more bone fractures (45 [2∙88%] vs 23 [1∙47%]; difference 1∙41% 
[95% CI 0∙38–2∙43]; p=0∙0070). There were no significant differences in any other event at 6 or 12 months.
Interpretation Fluoxetine 20 mg given daily for 6 months after acute stroke does not seem to improve functional 
outcomes. Although the treatment reduced the occurrence of depression, it increased the frequency of bone fractures. 
These results do not support the routine use of fluoxetine either for the prevention of post-stroke depression or to 
promote recovery of function.

Introduction
Each year, stroke affects around 9 million people worldwide 
for the first time and results in long-term disability for 
around 6·5 million people.1 Fluoxetine, a selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is used to treat 
depression and emotional lability after stroke. Many 
clinical and pre 
clinical studies have suggested that SSRIs 
might improve outcomes after stroke through a range of 
mechanisms, which include enhancing neuroplasticity 
and promoting neurogenesis. In 2011, the results of the 
FLAME (FLuoxetine for motor recovery After acute 
ischaeMic strokE) trial indicated that fluoxetine enhanced 
motor recovery.2 In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicentre trial, 118 patients with ischaemic stroke and 
unilateral motor weakness, and a median National 
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 13, were 
randomly allocated between 5 and 10 days after stroke 
onset to receive fluoxetine 20 mg daily or placebo for 
3 months. At day 90, the improvement from baseline in 
the Fugl-Meyer motor score was significantly greater in the 
fluoxetine group than in the placebo group. Additionally, 
the proportion of patients who were independent in daily 
living (with a modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 0–2) 
was significantly higher in the fluoxetine group than in the 
placebo group (26% vs 9%, p=0·015). More participants 
were free from depression at 3 months in the fluoxetine 
group than in the placebo group (93% vs 71%; p=0·002). 
A subsequent Cochrane systematic review3 of SSRIs for 
stroke recovery identified 52 randomised controlled trials 
of SSRIs versus controls (in 4060 patients), but no others 
tested the effect of fluoxetine on functional outcomes 
measured with the mRS. The findings of the Cochrane 
review suggested that SSRIs might reduce post-stroke 
disability, although this estimate was based on a meta-
analysis done across various measures of function and 
greater effects were seen if studies with increased risk of

bias were retained and patients with depression were 
included. Although promising, data from the FLAME trial 
and the Cochrane review were not sufficiently compelling 
to alter stroke treatment guidelines or to alleviate concerns 
that any possible benefits might be offset by serious 
adverse reactions.4
The primary aim of the Fluoxetine Or Control Under 
Supervision (FOCUS) trial was to ascertain whether 
patients with a clinical stroke diagnosis would have 
improved functional outcomes with a 6-month course of 
fluoxetine compared with placebo. Important secondary 
aims were to identify any other benefits or harms and to 
assess whether any benefits persisted from the end of the 
treatment period to 12 months after stroke.
Methods
Study design and patients
FOCUS was a pragmatic, multicentre, parallel group, 
double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done 
at 103 hospitals in the UK. The protocol and statistical 
analysis plan were published before completion of 
follow-up.5,6
Patients were eligible if they were aged 18 years or 
older; had a clinical diagnosis of acute stroke with brain 
imaging compatible with intracerebral haemorrhage or 
ischaemic stroke (including a normal brain scan); were 
randomly assigned between 2 days and 15 days after 
stroke onset; and had a persisting focal neurological 
deficit at the time of randomisation that was severe 
enough to warrant 6 months of treatment from the 
patient’s or carer’s perspective.
Patients were excluded if they had subarachnoid 
haemorrhage except where secondary to a primary 
intracerebral haemorrhage; they were unlikely to be 
available for follow-up for the following 12 months; they 
were unable to speak English and had no close family 
member available to help with follow-up; they had 
another life-threatening illness (eg, advanced cancer) 
that would make 12-month survival unlikely; they had a 
history of epileptic seizures; they had a history of allergy 
to fluoxetine; they had contraindications to fluoxetine, 
including hepatic impairment (alanine aminotransferase 
more than three times the upper normal limit) or renal 
impairment (creatinine >180 µmol/L); they were preg-
nant or breastfeeding, or women of childbearing age not 
taking contraception; they had a previous drug overdose 
or attempted suicide; they were already enrolled into a 
controlled trial of an investigational medicinal product; 
they had current or recent (within the last month) 
depression treated with an SSRI; or they were taking or 
had, in the past 5 weeks, taken medications that have a 
potentially serious interaction with fluoxetine.
Patients (or their carers or relatives if patients had 
mental incapacity) provided written informed consent.
We monitored the quality and integrity of the 
accumulating clinical data according to a protocol agreed 
with the study sponsors (the Academic and Clinical 
Central Office for Research and Development [ACCORD] 
representing the University of Edinburgh and NHS 
Lothian), which involved central statistical monitoring, 
supplemented by onsite monitoring and detailed source 
data verification in the coordinating centre and triggered 
visits when patterns in the data at a centre seemed 
anomalous. All FOCUS monitoring procedures were 
compliant with requirements of the study sponsors, the 
ethics committee and regulatory agencies, and they met 
all appropriate regulatory and good clinical practice 
requirements. All baseline data, inpatient data, and 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched the literature in July, 2018, using the same search 
strategy as that of a 2012 Cochrane review. In addition to the 
FLAME (FLuoxetine for motor recovery After acute ischaeMic 
strokE) trial we identified three other small, randomised, 
placebo-controlled trials of fluoxetine, which enrolled patients 
who did not have depression at recruitment and which reported 
the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) during follow-up. These 
three trials recruited a total of 154 patients and reported 
improvements in the mRS in those allocated fluoxetine, 
but two trials (n=122) did not publish their mRS data in a format 
that would facilitate a meta-analysis. The FLAME trial indicated 
that fluoxetine, when given to patients with a recent ischaemic 
stroke, a motor deficit, and a median National Institutes of 
Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 13, improved recovery in motor 
function as measured by the Fugl-Meyer motor score at about 
3 months. In a published post-hoc analysis, the proportion of 
patients who were independent in daily living (mRS 0–2) was 
significantly higher in the fluoxetine group than in the placebo 
group (26% vs 9%, p=0∙015). However, an ordinal analysis of the 
mRS data did not show a significant difference between groups 
(common odds ratio 1∙501 [95% CI 0∙757–2∙974]; p=0∙2446). 
Added value of this study
The results of the Fluoxetine Or Control Under Supervision 
(FOCUS) trial suggest that fluoxetine 20 mg given orally daily for 
6 months after acute stroke does not improve functional 
outcomes. Although the treatment might lead to a reduction in 
the occurrence of depression, it also seems to increase the 
frequency of bone fractures. These results do not support the 
routine use of fluoxetine either for prevention of post-stroke 
depression or to promote recovery of function.
Implications of all the available evidence
Ongoing trials might be able to confirm the external 
generalisability of these findings to different populations, and a 
planned individual patient data meta-analysis could clarify 
whether any subgroups might benefit from fluoxetine and 
provide more precise estimates of any harms.

6-month and 12-month outcome data were subject to 
verification checks built into the randomisation and data 
management system.
During recruitment, interim analyses of baseline and 
follow-up data were supplied, in strict confidence at least 
once every year, to the chairman of the data monitoring 
committee. In light of these analyses, the data monitor-
ing committee advised the chairman of the trial steering 
committee whether, in their view, the randomised 
comparisons provided “proof beyond reasonable doubt” 
that for all, or some, patients the treatment was clearly 
indicated or contraindicated, and evidence that might 
reasonably be expected to materially influence future 
patient management.
The protocol was approved by the Scotland A 
Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (Dec 21, 2011). 
The study was jointly sponsored by the University of 
Edinburgh and NHS Lothian. The full protocol is 
available in the appendix. 
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
fluoxetine or placebo, by use of a centralised random-
isation system. The clinician entered the patient’s 
baseline data into a secure web-based randomisation 
system hosted by the University of Edinburgh. After the 
data were checked for completeness and consistency, the 
system generated a unique study identification number 
and a treatment pack number, which corresponded to 
either fluoxetine or placebo. A minimisation algorithm7 
was used to achieve optimum balance between treatment 
groups for the following factors: delay since stroke onset 
(2–8 days vs 9–15 days), computer-generated prediction 
of 6-month outcome (probability of mRS8 0 to 2 was 
≤0∙15 vs >0∙15 based on the six simple variable [SSV] 
model9), and presence of a motor deficit or aphasia 
(according to the NIHSS).10 The SSV model includes 
the patient’s age; whether the patient is independent 
in activities of daily living before the stroke; whether 
they are living alone before the stroke; whether they 
are able to lift both arms off the bed; whether they are 
able to walk unassisted; whether they are able to talk, 
and whether they are not confused.9 The randomising 
clinicians in each centre had received training and 
certification in the application of the NIHSS. The system 
also incorporated an element of randomisation over and 
above the minimisation algorithm, so that it allocated 
patients to the treatment group that minimised the 
difference between groups with a probability of 0∙8 
rather than 1∙0.7
Patients, their families, and the health-care team 
including the pharmacist, staff in the coordinating 
centre, and anyone involved in outcome assessments 
were all masked to treatment allocation by use of a 
placebo capsule that was visually identical to the fluoxetine 
capsules even when broken open. An emergency un-
blinding system was available but was designed so that 
those in the coordinating centre and those doing 
follow-up remained masked to treatment allocation.
Procedures
Fluoxetine 20 mg or placebo were administered to 
patients orally once daily for 6 months. The study 
medication (active and placebo) was manufactured by 
Unichem (Goa, India), imported by Niche Generics Ltd 
(Hitchin, UK), purchased from Discovery Pharmaceuticals 
Ltd (Castle Donington, UK), and quality assured, 
packaged, labelled, and distributed by Sharp Clinical 
Services. Patients were supplied with 186 capsules and 
were prescribed the study medication (20 mg capsules of 
fluoxetine or placebo capsule) to be taken daily. If a patient 
was unable to swallow capsules and had an enteral 
feeding tube in place, the capsules were broken open and 
the contents put down the tube according to accepted 
methods.11 We measured adherence to the study 
medication by recording the date of the first and last dose 
taken, the number of missed doses while in hospital, 
capsule counts when unused capsules were returned, and 
estimated adherence at the 6-month follow-up. We 
recorded the reasons for stopping the study medication 
early. Our primary measure of adherence was the best 
estimate of the interval between the first and last dose 
based on all the information available. Therefore, for a 
particular patient a capsule count might lead us to modify 
the estimate of the timing of the last dose.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was functional status, measured 
with the mRS, at the 6-month follow-up. We used the 
simplified mRS questionnaire (smRSq) delivered by 
post.8,12,13 Among those without a complete postal 
question 
naire, a telephone interview was done for any 
further clarification, for completion of missing items, or 
for the whole questionnaire. Those doing telephone 
assessments (chief investigators or other staff at the 
coordinating centre) were trained in their use.
Secondary outcomes were survival at 6 and 12 months, 
functional status at 12 months (mRS), and health status 
with the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS; for each of nine 
domains on which the patient scores 0–100).14–18 Arm, 
hand, leg, and foot strength; hand function; mobility; 
communication and understanding; memory and think-
ing; mood and emotions; daily activities; and partici 
pation 
in work, leisure, and social activities were assessed by a 
Likert scale. Overall rating of recovery was assessed on a 
visual analogue scale. Mood was assessed with the Mental 
Health Inventory (MHI-5).19,20 Fatigue was measured on 
the Vitality subscale of SF36.21,22 Health-related quality of 
life was measured with the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 
Levels (EQ5D-5L) to generate utilities.23 The following 
adverse events and safety outcomes were systematically 
recorded: recurrent stroke including isch 
aemic and 
haemorrhagic strokes, acute coronary syn 
dromes, epi-
leptic seizures, hyponatraemia (<125 mmol/L), upper

gastro 
intestinal bleeding, other major bleeding (lower 
gastro 
intestinal, extracranial, subdural, extradural, and 
sub 
arachnoid), poorly controlled diabetes including 
hyper 
glycaemia (>22 mmol/L) and sympto 
matic hypo-
glycaemia, falls resulting in injury, bone fractures, 
new depression (including a diagnosis made by their 
treating clinician and initiation of a new antidepressant 
prescription), and self-harm.
The 
recruiting 
hospitals 
monitored 
adherence, 
identified adverse events in hospital, and completed the 
follow-up form at hospital discharge or death in hospital. 
National coordinating centre staff followed up patients 
at 6 months and 12 months to measure the primary 
and secondary outcomes. Data on adverse events and 
medications were also collected from patients’ general 
practitioners at 6 months and 12 months.
Our protocol stipulated that if patients developed 
depression that a clinician wished to treat with an 
anti 
depressant during the treatment period, then the 
clinician should continue the study medication and avoid 
the use of an SSRI if possible, and instead use either 
mirtazapine, trazadone, or a tricyclic antidepressant. 
We monitored the use of all antidepressants during 
follow-up.
Statistical analysis
We aimed to recruit at least 3000 patients. We estimated 
that this sample size would allow us to identify a 
treatment effect size of fluoxetine in the FOCUS trial that 
we thought would be important to patients and health 
and social care services. This effect size would also justify 
a 6-month course of treatment. FOCUS had 90% power 
to identify an increase in the proportion of patients with 
good outcomes (ie, mRS of 0–2) from 39∙6% to 44∙7% 
(ie, an absolute difference of 5∙1 percentage points), 
based on an ordinal analysis expressed as a common 
odds ratio (OR) of 1·23.
The unmasked trial statistician (C Graham) prepared 
analyses of the accumulating data, which the data 
monitoring committee reviewed in strict confidence at 
least once a year. No other members of the trial 
team, trial steering committee, or patients had access to 
these analyses. Before recruitment was completed, and 
without input from the unmasked trial statistician or 
reference to the unblinded data, the trial steering 
committee prepared a detailed statistical analysis plan 
that was then published.6 For all primary analyses, 
including our primary analyses of adverse events and 
safety outcomes, we retained patients in the treatment 
group to which they were randomly allocated irrespective 
of the treatment they had actually received. We did a 
secondary safety analysis according to the treatment 
patients actually received rather than what they were 
randomly allocated (com 
paring those who received 
some fluoxetine in the first 6 months and those who 
received no fluoxetine).
Inevitably, some patients withdrew from the trial and 
were lost to follow-up. Some did not return follow-up 
questionnaires or left items blank. We excluded patients 
who had no follow-up data from the analyses, and did 
sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of these exclusions 
on the results.
For our primary outcome we did an ordinal analysis 
expressing the result as a common OR and 95% CI, 
where a common OR in favour of placebo is less than 1·0, 
adjusted with logistic regression for the variables in 
the mini 
misation algorithm. We did Cox proportional 
hazards modelling to analyse the effect of treatment on 
survival up to 12 months, also adjusting for variables 
included in our minimisation algorithm. We compared 
the frequency of outcome events by calculating the 
differences in proportions between treatment groups 
with their 95% CIs and p values. We present the median 
scores on the SIS, MHI-5, and the Vitality subscale of the 
SF36, and EQ5D-5L with the IQRs and p value derived by 
non-parametric methods (Mann-Whitney test). For all 
these scales, higher values represent better outcomes.

Results
Between Sept 10, 2012, and March 31, 2017, 3152 patients 
consented and 3127 were enrolled. 25 patients were not 
enrolled; 15 were identified as ineligible between obtaining 
consent and randomisation and in nine cases the patients, 
their carer or family member, or their treating clinician 
changed their mind about participation in the trial 
(figure 1). Of the 3127 patients enrolled, 1564 were allocated 
fluoxetine and 1563 allocated placebo. 11 patients did not 
meet our eligibility criteria after randomisation: two in 
each group had a final diagnosis other than stroke, and 
seven others (three in the fluoxetine group and four in the 
placebo group) were identified as having exclusion criteria 
(eg, a history of epilepsy, self-harm, or some other contra-
indication to fluoxetine). Ineligible patients were retained 
in our intention-to-treat analyses. Baseline characteristics 
of the two treatment groups were well balanced (table 1) 
and were similar to those of unselected patients with 
stroke admitted to UK hospitals (appendix). 1393 (49%) of 
2847 6-month follow-up assessments were obtained by 
postal questionnaire (693 in the fluoxetine group and 
700 in the placebo group); the remainder required a 
telephone reminder or were completed by telephone 
interview (appendix). The emergency unblinding pro-
cedure was done in only three patients, all allocated 
fluoxetine (one at the request of a coroner, after the 
patient died, one for a suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reaction, and one because the responsible 
clinician felt that knowledge of the treatment would 
substantially alter their management of the patient).
The primary measure of adherence was the estimated 
duration of study medication (interval in days from first 
to last dose of study medication) based on all available 
data, including a capsule count, which was available in 
398 (25%) of 1564 patients allocated fluoxetine, and 
410 (26%) of 1563 allocated placebo. Patients returned a 
median of 32 capsules (IQR 10–135) in the fluoxetine 
group and 33 (11–139) in the placebo group. Our primary 
measure of adherence was available in 1417 (91%) patients 
in each group. The median duration of treatment was 
185 days (IQR 149–186) in the fluoxetine group, and 
183 days (136–186) in the placebo group. The median 
delay between randomisation and first dose was 0 days 
(IQR 0–1) in both treatment groups. 1519 (97%) patients 
in the fluoxetine group and 1494 (96%) in the placebo 
group received their first dose by day 2 after random-
isation. The number and proportion of patients meeting 
our eligibility criteria and with different levels of 
adherence to the study medication are shown in the 
appendix. 143 (9%) patients in the fluoxetine group 
stopped the trial medication because of perceived adverse 
effects within the first 90 days compared with 122 (8%) in 
the placebo group. Around two-thirds of patients took the 
study medication for at least 150 days.
The primary outcome, an ordinal comparison of the 
distribution of patients across the mRS categories at 
6 months, adjusted for variables included in the 
minimisation algorithm, was similar in the two groups 
(common OR 0∙951 [95% CI 0∙839–1∙079]; p=0∙439; 
figure 2). The unadjusted analysis provided similar 
results (common OR 0∙961 [95% CI 0∙848–1∙089]; 
p=0∙531). The ordinal analysis was done with the 
assumption of proportional odds, in the model of mRS 
by treatment. This assumption was found to hold in the 
score test for proportional odds assumption (p=0·9947).

p=0∙439; adjusted for baseline variables.

Comparison of the mRS dichotomised into 0–2 vs 3–6 
similarly showed no significant difference between the 
groups (adjusted OR 0∙955 [95% CI 0∙812–1∙123], 
p=0∙576; unadjusted OR 0∙957 [0∙827–1∙107], p=0∙352).
The results of our prespecified subgroup analyses are 
shown in the appendix. No significant interactions were 
observed between the prespecified subgroups and the 
effect of treatment on the primary outcome.
The appendix shows the effect of fluoxetine on our 
primary outcome in subgroups defined by the eligibility 
criteria and increasing degrees of adherence to the study 
medication; we did a series of prespecified per-protocol 
analyses, which sequentially excluded subgroups of 
patients who either did not meet our eligibility criteria or 
had incomplete adherence to the study medication.6 We 
did not observe greater benefit in patients with greater 
adherence.
Secondary outcomes at 6 months are shown in table 2 
and adverse events at 6 months shown in table 3. Patients 
allocated fluoxetine were less likely than those allocated 
placebo to be diagnosed with new depression at 6 months 
(210 [13∙43%] patients vs 269 [17·21%]; difference in 
proportions 3∙78% [95% CI 1∙26–6∙30]; p=0∙0033) and 
had better mood measured on MHI-5 at the 6-month 
follow-up (median 76 [IQR 60–88] vs 72 [56–88]; 
p=0∙0100). Those allocated fluoxetine had an increased 
risk of bone fractures compared with those allocated 
placebo (45 [2∙88%] patients vs 23 [1∙47%]; difference in 
proportions 1∙41% [95% CI 0∙38–2∙43]; p=0∙0070). 
There were no significant differences in any other 
secondary outcomes at 6 months, including any of the 
nine domains of the SIS, the Vitality subscale of SF36, 
and EQ5D-5L (table 2) or other recorded adverse reactions 
(table 3). The appendix shows the progress through the 
trial for patients who received any fluoxetine and those 
who received no fluoxetine by 6 months. Adverse events 
and safety outcomes in patients who received any 
fluoxetine within the first 6 months and those who 
received no fluoxetine, irrespective of the group to which 
they were allocated, are shown in the appendix.
The appendix shows secondary outcomes at 12 months. 
The difference in MHI-5 at 6 months was not sustained at 
12 months, and the difference between the two treatment 
groups in the cumulative number of patients diagnosed 
with new depression over 12 months was no longer 
significant. More patients had been started on anti-
depressants in the placebo group than in the fluoxetine 
group, but some were started on anti 
depressants 
for indications other than depression. There were no 
significant differences between treatment groups in any 
other secondary outcomes at 12 months, including 
survival (hazard ratio 0∙929 [95% CI 0∙756–1∙141]; 
p=0∙4819; appendix).
We assessed the effect of treatment among the subgroup 
with motor deficit at baseline (n=2702) but found no 
evidence of an effect on the mRS (common OR 0∙919 
[95% CI 0∙803–1∙051]; p=0∙2172) or on motor score based 
on the mean of SIS Strength, Hand, and Mobility domains 
(fluoxetine median 48∙43 [IQR 24∙98–78∙84] vs placebo 
52∙66 [25∙28–77∙22]; p=0∙4714). Additionally, in patients 
with aphasia at baseline and an SIS communication 
domain score available at 6 months (n=894) we found 
no  difference in median SIS communication domain

Discussion
The results of the FOCUS trial show that fluoxetine 
20 mg given daily for 6 months after an acute stroke does 
not significantly improve patients’ functional outcome or 
survival at 6 and 12 months. However, fluoxetine 
decreased the occurrence of depression and increased 
bone fractures at 6 months.
The strengths of the study, supporting the internal 
validity of the results, are that bias was minimised by 
central randomisation without any prospect of fore-
knowledge; patients, carers, and outcome assessment 
were masked (with only three episodes of unmasking); 
there were few losses to follow-up (<1%), and pre-
specified intention-to-treat analyses were done. The 
small difference in the numbers of patients stopping 
the trial medication for perceived adverse effects 
suggests that unmasking because of adverse effects was 
unlikely to have had a significant effect on our results. 
In any case, expectation bias would normally be expected 
to bias the result in favour of active treatment. Random 
error was also minimised by the large sample size and 
high rates of follow-up, which provided greater statistical 
power than in previous similar trials. The external 
validity of the results, at least for the UK stroke 
population, is supported by the large number of 
participating hospitals throughout the UK. Compared 
with unselected patients with stroke admitted to UK 
hospitals (appendix), there were few differences in the 
baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the 
FOCUS trial.27,28 Patients enrolled in FOCUS had slightly 
more severe strokes than unselected patients (NIHSS 6 
vs 4), which probably reflected inclusion criteria that 
required patients to have a neurological deficit persisting 
at the time of enrolment. Also, 60% of enrolled patients 
were men compared with a UK average of 50%—an 
unexplained but common observation in stroke trials.29 
Enrolled patients were slightly younger than the UK 
average (71 years vs 77 years), which might partly explain 
the male pre 
ponderance, with older women being 
under-represented. Many studies included in the 
previously published systematic review of randomised 
controlled trials of fluoxetine were from China, whereas 
non-white patients comprised less than 5% of those 
recruited in FOCUS. The ongoing AFFINITY trial is 
recruiting in Vietnam and will include a larger 
proportion of Asian patients.5
The validity of our results is also supported by the 
observed reduction in the occurrence of new post-stroke 
depression at 6 months with fluoxetine, which is 
consistent with its known antidepressant effects and the 
results of the FLAME trial. A previous systematic review 
of five randomised controlled trials (two of fluoxetine, 
two of sertraline, and one of escitalopram), including 
FLAME, in patients with stroke and no depression tested 
whether SSRIs prevented the development of post-
stroke depression.30 In a pooled analysis, 23 (9·3%) of 
248 patients treated with an SSRI developed post-stroke 
depression compared with 59 (24·4%) of 242 treated with 
a placebo (OR 0∙37 [95% CI 0∙22–0∙61]; p=0∙001). The 
rate of depression in the placebo groups of these 
trials was much higher than that in FOCUS, which 
might have reflected the characteristics of the patients 
(as they tended to have had more severe strokes than 
those enrolled in FOCUS) or the different methods 
of diagnosing depression. Although this observation is 
consistent with our findings in terms of the direction 
(but not the magnitude) of treatment effect, it does not 
take into account the possible excess risk of adverse 
effects (such as bone fractures), which might offset any 
benefits of reducing the frequency of post-stroke 
depression.
The observed 1∙4% absolute excess risk of bone 
fractures at 6 months with fluoxetine in FOCUS is also 
consistent with previous reports from large case-control 
and cohort studies.31 The magnitude of the increased 
risk in previous observational studies tended to be 
greater than in FOCUS, but this difference might be 
attributable to the inherent confounding by treatment 
indication in observational studies. The rates of serious 
adverse reactions to fluoxetine referred to in the 
summary of product characteristics, which we included 
as secondary outcomes in this trial (eg, epileptic seizures, 
falls, hyponatraemia, uncontrolled diabetes, and upper 
gastro 
intestinal bleeding), were higher in the fluoxetine 
group than in the placebo group, but the absolute 
differences were small and not significant. Despite 
concerns about the effects of fluoxetine on platelet 
function and interactions with antiplatelet and anti-
coagulant medications, we observed no effect on 
bleeding or thrombotic adverse events.
The main limitation of FOCUS was the moderate 
adherence to the trial medication, which might have led 
us to under-estimate any treatment effect. However, 
adherence measured in FOCUS was superior to that 
reported in routine clinical practice, and did not differ 
substantially between the treatment groups.32 Differences 
in adherence between the fluoxetine and placebo groups 
were more likely if reduced adherence resulted from 
possible adverse reactions or perceived change (or no 
change) in patients’ conditions. We repeated the analysis 
of our primary outcome after sequentially excluding 
patients with different reasons for, and different degrees 
of, adherence. Such per-protocol analyses can increase 
the risk of bias, usually in favour of the active treatment. 
However, our analyses (shown in the appendix) did not 
show any increased benefit from fluoxetine in patients 
with greater adherence.
Our use of the smRSq as the primary outcome measure 
could be perceived as a limitation. However, the smRSq is 
a valid, reliable, and patient-centred measure of functional 
outcome, thus ensuring our results are relevant to

patients and their families.8,12,13 Additionally, local, face-to-
face assessments of outcomes might be more prone to 
unmasking than those done through postal and telephone 
follow-up because of patients reporting adverse effects of 
trial medication. We used patient-reported outcomes, the 
Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2) at baseline and 
the smRSq, MHI-5, and SIS motor score at follow-up by 
postal and telephone questionnaires. Other limitations of 
FOCUS include the absence of a standardised psychiatric 
assessment at baseline or follow-up and absence of a 
structured neurological examination during follow-up, 
which were impractical to include in this large, pragmatic, 
multicentre trial.
We cannot definitively exclude an effect of fluoxetine 
on a directly measured neurological deficit—such as the 
Fugl-Meyer motor score, which was measured in the 
FLAME trial. However, we have shown that a resulting 
improvement in functional status measured with the 
mRS or SIS is unlikely.
Other trials of similar design to FOCUS, but with smaller 
recruitment targets, are ongoing.5,6 These studies should 
allow us to confirm the effects of fluoxetine on post-stroke 
depression and bone fractures, and provide more precise 
estimates of the benefits and harms of early fluoxetine, to 
guide its use in patients with stroke and perhaps other 
older people with comorbidities. These ongoing trials will 
also establish the external validity of the FOCUS trial in 
stroke populations with different ethnic groups and health-
care backgrounds—for example, with different intensities 
of physical rehabilitation.
In summary, the results of the FOCUS trial show that 
fluoxetine 20 mg given daily for 6 months after an acute 
stroke did not influence patients’ functional outcomes 
but did decrease the occurrence of depression and 
increase the occurrence of bone fractures. These results 
do not support the routine use of fluoxetine either for the 
prevention of post-stroke depression or to promote 
recovery of function. Ongoing trials and a planned 
individual patient data meta-analysis are needed to 
confirm or refute a more modest benefit, either overall or 
in particular subgroups, and to provide more precise 
estimates of any harms.
