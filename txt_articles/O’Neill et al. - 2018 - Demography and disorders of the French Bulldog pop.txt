Abstract
Background: Despite its Gallic name, the French Bulldog is a breed of both British and French origin that was first
recognised by The Kennel Club in 1906. The French Bulldog has demonstrated recent rapid rises in Kennel Club
registrations and is now (2017) the second most commonly registered pedigree breed in the UK. However, the
breed has been reported to be predisposed to several disorders including ocular, respiratory, neurological and
dermatological problems. The VetCompass™ Programme collates de-identified clinical data from primary-care
veterinary practices in the UK for epidemiological research. Using VetCompass™ clinical data, this study aimed to
characterise the demography and common disorders of the general population of French Bulldogs under veterinary
care in the UK.
Results: French Bulldogs comprised 2228 (0.49%) of 445,557 study dogs under veterinary care during 2013. Annual
proportional birth rates showed that the proportional ownership of French Bulldog puppies rose steeply from 0.
02% of the annual birth cohort attending VetCompass™ practices in 2003 to 1.46% in 2013. The median age of the
French Bulldogs overall was 1.3 years (IQR 0.6–2.5, range 0.0–13.0). The most common colours of French Bulldogs
were brindle (solid or main) (32.36%) and fawn (solid or main) (29.9%). Of the 2228 French Bulldogs under
veterinary care during 2013, 1612 (72.4%) had at least one disorder recorded. The most prevalent fine-level
precision disorders recorded were otitis externa (14.0%, 95% CI: 12.6–15.5), diarrhoea (7.5%, 95% CI: 6.4–8.7),
conjunctivitis (3.2%, 95% CI: 2.5–4.0), nails overlong (3.1%, 95% CI% 2.4–3.9) and skin fold dermatitis (3.0%, 95% CI%
2.3–3.8). The most prevalent disorder groups were cutaneous (17.9%, 95% CI: 16.3–19.6), enteropathy (16.7%, 95% CI:
15.2–18.3), aural (16.3%, 95% CI: 14.8–17.9), upper respiratory tract (12.7%, 95% CI: 11.3–14.1) and ophthalmological
(10.5%, 95% CI: 9.3–11.9).
Conclusions: Ownership of French Bulldogs in the UK is rising steeply. This means that the disorder profiles
reported in this study reflect a current young UK population and are likely to shift as this cohort ages. Otitis externa,
diarrhoea and conjunctivitis were the most common disorders in French Bulldogs. Identification of health priorities
based on VetCompass™ data can support evidence–based reforms to improve health and welfare within the breed.

 Plain English summary
The French Bulldog, despite its name, is a breed of both
British and French origin. The breed was first recognised
by The Kennel Club in 1906 and has three colourings
currently
allowed:
brindle,
fawn
and
pied.
French
Bulldogs are currently very popular in the UK and were
the second most commonly registered UK pedigree dog
breed in 2017. Owners of this breed are attracted to
their distinctive appearance, their size being suited to a
sedentary lifestyle, and the perception that they are a
good companion and children’s breed. However, despite
their popularity, the breed has some well-documented
health issues, especially in relation to eye, breathing, skin
and spinal problems. Collection of health information
on large numbers of French Bulldogs attending veterinary
practices in the UK would provide reliable data to assist
with reforms that aim to improve the health of the breed.
The
VetCompass™
Programme
collects
de-identified
clinical record data from veterinary practices in the UK
for research to improve animal welfare.
French Bulldogs made up 2228 (0.49%) of 445,557
study dogs under veterinary care during 2013. By calculat-
ing the French Bulldog proportion of dogs born each year
that attended VetCompass™ practices, the study showed
that French Bulldogs accounted for just 0.02% of puppies
born in 2003 but rose to comprise 1.46% of all puppies
born in 2013. The most common colours of the study
French Bulldogs were brindle (solid or main) (32.36%) and
fawn (solid or main) (29.9%). Of the 2228 French Bulldogs
under veterinary care during 2013, 1612 (72.4%) had at
least one disorder recorded. The most common disorders
recorded were ear infections (14.0%), diarrhoea (7.5%) and
conjunctivitis (3.2%). Skin problems were the most com-
monly reported group of disorders (17.9%). This study of
over two thousand French Bulldogs provides a framework
to identify the most important health priorities in French
Bulldogs in the UK and can assist with reforms to improve
health and welfare within the breed.
Background
The French Bulldog, despite its gallic name is a breed of
both British and French origin, with ancestral roots from
the Toy Bulldog of Britain in the 1850s [1]. Following
the introduction of the Toy Bulldog to Northern France
during the Industrial Revolution, crosses with other
brachycephalic (short-muzzled) breeds are thought to
have occurred, resulting in the French Bulldog breed as
known today. The French Bulldog returned to Britain at
the end of the nineteenth century and was first formally
recognised by The Kennel Club (KC) in 1906 with three
colourings currently allowed: brindle, fawn and pied [1].
The French
Bulldog
was
the UK’s second
most
commonly registered KC breed for 2017, exceeded only
by the Labrador Retriever in popularity. This followed a
dramatic rise to popularity, with annual registration data
from the UK Kennel Club highlighting an over thirty-
fold increase in registrations over the past decade, from
just 692 registrations in 2007 to 21,470 registrations in
2016 [2]. Current popularity trajectories suggest that the
French Bulldog will become the most registered breed in
the UK by the end of 2018, stealing a title that the
Labrador Retriever has held since 1990. It is worth not-
ing that a rising breed popularity with a consequently
young population means that current disorder profiles
will reflect the diseases of youth and are likely to shift
more towards diseases of aging as popularity increases
decline. Although national dog populations often remain
largely stable over long periods, individual breeds can
show substantial, and often culturally driven, surges and
decreases in popularity in sort periods (Herzog et al.
2004). Social influence (fashion) has a strong effect on
the popularity of dog breeds, and is often related to
media exposure, e.g. featuring in movies [3, 4]. Indeed,
celebrity ownership of French Bulldogs and subsequent
media exposure is often anecdotally cited as a driving
force behind their rise. The distinctive appearance of this
brachycephalic breed has been reported to be a key
factor influencing their popularity [5, 6]; but despite
their appearance-driven popularity, the French Bulldog
is reportedly affected by a number of health problems
associated with their conformation, including their short
muzzles and wide, prominent eyes [7, 8].
French Bulldogs are reported as predisposed to health
disorders including brachycephalic obstructive airway
syndrome (BOAS) [7, 9–11], dystocia [12], corneal ulcer-
ation [8, 13], patellar luxation [14] and a range of spinal
diseases including type I intervertebral disk herniation
[15], spinal disease associated with vertebral malforma-
tions [16, 17] and spinal arachnoid diverticulum [15]. It
is worth noting that many of these reported predisposi-
tions increase in prevalence as dogs age and therefore
analyses of younger populations may artifactually appear
to show reduced prevalence compared with more mature
populations. Indeed, French Bulldogs have been reported
with at least ten breed predispositions to disease [18]. In
recognition of these breed health challenges, the UK KC
originally listed the French Bulldog as a category 3 breed
(the highest category) in its ‘Breed Watch’ system which
aims to identify points of concern for individual breeds
‘where some dogs have visible conditions or exaggerations
that can cause pain or discomfort’. Since 2013, the French
Bulldog has been moved to category 2; however, a range
of points of concern remain that are highlighted for
special attention by show judges including ‘dogs showing
respiratory distress including difficulty in breathing or
labored breathing, exaggerated roach in the top line, ex-
cessively prominent eyes, hair loss or scarring from previ-
ous dermatitis, incomplete blink, incorrect bite, inverted

 tail, lack of tail, overly short neck, pinched nostrils, screw
tail, signs of dermatitis in skin folds and tight tail’ [1].
Using veterinary clinical data from the VetCompass™
Programme [19], this study aimed to characterise the
demography, longevity and common disorders of the
general population of French Bulldogs under veterinary
care in the UK, with an exploratory comparative focus
on differences between males and females. The results
from the current study could provide a reliable framework
to assist reforms in breeding practices and ultimately con-
tribute to improved health and welfare of French Bulldogs.
Methods
The study population included all dogs under primary
veterinary care at clinics participating in the VetCom-
pass™ Programme during 2013. Dogs under veterinary
care were defined as those with either a) at least one
electronic patient record (EPR) (VeNom diagnosis term,
free-text clinical note, treatment or bodyweight) re-
corded during 2013 or b) at least one EPR recorded both
before and after 2013. The VetCompass™ Programme
collates de-identified EPR data from primary-care veter-
inary practices in the UK for epidemiological research
[19]. Collaborating practices can record summary diag-
nosis terms during episodes of care from an embedded
VeNom Code list [20]. Data fields available to VetCom-
pass™ researchers for each dog include a unique animal
identifier along with species, breed, date of birth, colour,
sex, neuter status and bodyweight, and clinical informa-
tion from free-form text clinical notes, summary diagno-
sis terms (VeNom codes) and treatment with relevant
dates.
A prevalence study design derived from the cohort
clinical data of dogs registered at participating practices
was used to estimate the one-year period prevalence of
the most commonly diagnosed disorders [21]. Sample
size calculations estimated that 2136 dogs would be
needed to detect a sex effect for a disorder with 2.5%
expected prevalence in the protected sex at a 95% confi-
dence level with 80% power assuming a 1:1 ratio of
males to females [22]. Ethics approval was obtained from
the Royal Veterinary College Clinical Research Ethical
Review Board (CRERB) (reference number 2015/1369).
Dogs recorded as French Bulldog breed were cate-
gorised as French Bulldog and all remaining dogs were
categorised as non-French Bulldog. All-age Bodyweight
(Kg) described recorded all available bodyweight and
date combinations. Adult Bodyweight (Kg) described the
mean bodyweight recorded from all bodyweight data for
dogs aged over 18 months and was categorised into 6
groups (< 9.0, 9.0 to < 11.0, 11.0 to < 13.0, 13.0 to < 15.0,
15.0 to < 17.0, ≥ 17.0). Neuter described the status of the
dog (entire or neutered) at the final EPR. Age described
the age at the final date under veterinary care during
2013 (December 31st, 2013) and was categorised alter-
natively into 7 groups (< 1.0, 1.0 to < 2.0, 2.0 to < 3.0, 3.0
to < 6.0, 6.0 to < 9.0, 9.0 to < 12.0, ≥ 12.0) and also into a
binary age categorization (< 2.0 and ≥ 2.0).
The list of unique French Bulldog animal identification
numbers was randomly ordered and the clinical records
of all animals were reviewed manually in detail to extract
the most definitive diagnoses recorded for all disorders
that existed during 2013 [10]. Elective (e.g. neutering) or
prophylactic (e.g. vaccination) clinical events were not
included. No distinction was made between pre-existing
and incident disorder presentations. Disorders described
within the clinical notes using presenting sign terms
(e.g. ‘vomiting’ or ‘vomiting and diarrhoea’), but without
a formal clinical diagnostic term being recorded, were
included using the first sign listed (e.g. vomiting). Mor-
tality data (recorded cause, date and method of death)
were extracted on all deaths at any date during the
available EPR data.
The extracted diagnosis terms were mapped to a dual
hierarchy of diagnostic precision for analysis: fine-level
precision and grouped-level precision as previously de-
scribed [10]. Briefly, fine-level precision terms described
the original extracted terms at the maximal diagnostic
precision recorded within the clinical notes (e.g. inflam-
matory bowel disease would remain as inflammatory
bowel disease). Grouped-level precision terms mapped
the original diagnosis terms to a general level of diagnos-
tic precision (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease would
map to gastro-intestinal).
Following data checking for internal validity and clean-
ing in Excel (Microsoft Office Excel 2013, Microsoft
Corp.), analyses were conducted using Stata Version 13
(Stata Corporation). The sex, neuter status, age, colour
and adult bodyweight for French Bulldogs under veterin-
ary care during 2013 were described. Annual propor-
tional birth rates described the relative proportion of
French Bulldogs compared with all dogs that were born
in each year from 2003 to 2013 from the cohort that
were under veterinary care in 2013. All-age bodyweight
data with their associated dates were used to generate
individual bodyweight growth curves for male and
female French Bulldogs by plotting age-specific body-
weights and were overlaid with a cross medians line plot
using the Stata mband command.

reported along with 95% confidence intervals (CI)

from standard errors based on approximation to the
normal distribution for disorders with ten or more
events [23] or the Wilson approximation method for
disorders with fewer than ten events [24]. Prevalence
values were reported overall, separately for males and

The chi-square test was used to compare categorical vari-
ables and the Students t-test or Mann-Whitney U test to
compare continuous variables as appropriate [23]. Statis-
tical significance was set at the 5% level.
Results
Demography and mortality
The study population of 455,557 dogs from 304 clinics in
the VetCompass™ database under veterinary care during
2013 included 2228 (0.49%) French Bulldogs. Of these
French Bulldogs with information available, 1047 (48.5%)
were female and 461 (26.2%) were neutered. Males were
more likely to be neutered than females (30.7% versus 21.
8%, P < 0.001). The mean adult bodyweight overall was
12.7 kg (standard deviation [SD] 2.5 kg). The mean adult
bodyweight of males (13.7 kg, SD 2.4 kg) was heavier than
for females (11.5 kg, SD 2.1 kg) (P < 0.001). The median
age of the French Bulldogs overall was 1.3 years (IQR 0.6–
2.5, range 0.0–13.0). The most common recorded colours
were brindle (solid or main) (n = 671, 32.36%) and fawn
(solid or main) (621, 29.9%) (Table 1). Data completeness
varied across the variables assessed: age 98.71%, sex 99.5%,
neuter 79.0%, colour 93.4% and all-age bodyweight 66.1%.
Annual proportional birth rates showed that French
Bulldogs increased steeply from 0.02% of the annual Vet-
Compass™ birth cohort in 2003 to 1.46% in 2013 (Fig. 1).
The median bodyweight across all ages was higher for
males (12.3 kg, IQR: 9.5–14.3, range: 0.7–23.5) than for fe-
males (10.3 kg, IQR: 8.0–12.0, range: 0.8–22.3) (P < 0.
001). Bodyweight growth curves based on 3413 body-
weight values from 684 females and 5276 bodyweight
values from 783 males showed that French Bulldog
puppies grow rapidly during their first year but continue
to gain further weight up to three years (Fig. 2).
There were 98 deaths recorded during the study of
which 92 had a recorded sex and age at death. Longevity
and mortality described the distribution of ages and
causes of death within the current study of a young and
emerging population of French Bulldogs and reflect this
specific young population. The longevity and mortality
profiles of a stable population are likely to be quite
different and to reflect substantially greater longevity
with a shift towards mortality from diseases of aging.
The median longevity of French Bulldogs overall was 3.
6 years (IQR 1.8–6.1, range 0.0–12.2). The median lon-
gevity of females (4.0 years, IQR 2.1–6.1, range 0.0–12.2,
n = 38) did not differ to males (3.5 years, IQR 1.6–6.1,
range 0.0–11.5, n = 54) (P = 0.918). There were 14 (14.
3%) deaths that did not have a cause of death stated. Of
the remaining 84 deaths, the most common causes of
death described at a grouped-precision level were brain
disorder (n = 10, prevalence 11.9%) and spinal cord
disorder (8, 9.5%) (Table 2).
Disorder prevalence
The EPRs of all 2228 French Bulldogs were manually
examined to extract all recorded disorder data for 2013.
There were 1612 (72.4%) French Bulldogs with at least
one disorder recorded during 2013 while the remaining
27.6% had no disorder recorded and either presented for
prophylactic management only or did not present at all
during 2013. The median annual disorder count per
French Bulldog during 2013 was 1 disorder (IQR 0–2,
range 0–12). There was some evidence of higher

The study included 3380 unique disorder events
recorded during 2013 that encompassed 343 distinct
fine-level disorder terms. The most prevalent fine-
level precision disorders recorded were otitis externa
(n = 312, prevalence 14.0%, 95% CI: 12.6–15.5), diar-
rhoea (167, 7.5%, 95% CI: 6.4–8.7), conjunctivitis (71,
3.2%, 95% CI: 2.5–4.0), nails overlong (69, 3.1%, 95%
CI% 2.4–3.9) and skin fold dermatitis (66, 3.0%, 95%
CI% 2.3–3.8). Males had a higher probability of diag-
nosis than females for 8 of the 26 most common
fine-level precision disorders (conjunctivitis, prolapsed
nictitans gland, BOAS, aggression, vomiting, upper
respiratory
tract
(URT)
disorder,
claw
injury
and
stenotic nares) while females did not have higher
prevalence than males for any fine-level precision dis-
orders (Table 3). Age was significantly associated with
the prevalence of 10/26 (38.5%) the most common
fine-level precision disorders. The direction of associ-
ation was split equally across these 10 discordant
disorders with 5 disorders having higher prevalence in
dogs aged < 2 years (diarrhoea, prolapsed nictitans gland,
infectious canine tracheobronchitis, ear discharge, demo-
dicosis) and 5 disorders having higher prevalence in dogs

 aged ≥2 years (otitis externa, skin fold dermatitis pododer-
matitis, ulcerative keratitis, atopic dermatitis) (Table 4).
There were 59 distinct grouped-level precision dis-
order terms recorded. The most prevalent grouped-level
precision disorders were cutaneous (n = 399, prevalence:
17.9%, 95% CI: 16.3–19.6), enteropathy (372, 16.7%, 95%
CI: 15.2–18.3), aural (364, 16.3%, 95% CI: 14.8–17.9),
URT (282, 12.7%, 95% CI: 11.3–14.1) and ophthalmo-
logical (234, 10.5%, 95% CI: 9.3–11.9). Males were more
likely than females to be diagnosed with 6 of the 15 most
common grouped-level precision disorders (cutaneous,
enteropathy, URT, nail disorder, undesirable behavior
and lower respiratory tract) while females did not have
higher prevalence than males for any grouped-level
precision disorders (Table 5).
Discussion
This study of over two thousand animals is the largest
analysis of breed health in French Bulldogs based on
primary-care veterinary records to date. The results
highlight steeply rising French Bulldog ownership in the
UK, with French Bulldogs comprising over 1.46% of all
dogs
born
in
2013
attending
veterinary
practices,
although not all of these may have been born in the UK.
These findings are consistent with registration data from
The Kennel Club that highlights the French Bulldog
currently as the most rapidly rising pedigree breed in the
UK,
surpassing
other
popular
small
brachycephalic
breeds such as the Pug. This trend has also been
observed internationally, with shorter, smaller and flatter
faced dog breeds
also becoming more popular in
Australia between 1986 and 2013 [25].
Both in the United States of America (USA) and the
UK, breed popularity appears to lack direct associations
with functional traits (e.g. health, trainability) [3, 26]
whilst displaying a concerning tendency for more popu-
lar breeds to have greater numbers of inherited disorders
[26]. For owners of small brachycephalic breeds includ-
ing the French Bulldog, the breeds’ appearance, size be-
ing suited to the owners’ lifestyle and behavioural traits
(good dog breed for children and good companion
breed) have been reported as more highly influential to
breed choice by owners than either health or longevity
[5]. In addition, French Bulldog owners may represent
examples of ‘extrinsically motivated’ owners, who ac-
quire dogs as a means of obtaining status and attention
from other people, due to the distinctiveness or ‘cute-
ness’ of the dog, and may often perceive their dog as
helpless and in need of care and control [6]. With
several of the
most
common disorders in
French
Bulldogs linked to their physical conformation (e.g. URT
disease and ophthalmological conditions), the increasing
popularity of this breed is not necessarily a benign
phenomenon. Increased demand for dogs with extreme
conformational features is suggested to be detrimental
to these dogs’ welfare both because of directly linked
disorder risk and also because steeply increasing demand
may contribute to suboptimal breeding and welfare stan-
dards as breeders and suppliers rapidly attempt to fulfil
the heightened consumer demand [27]. With dogs born
in high-volume commercial breeding establishments ex-
periencing an increased incidence of behavioural and
emotional problems that cause distress in adulthood
compared with dogs from other sources, dramatic in-
creases in popularity are a welfare concern for any breed
[28]. Consequently, surveillance of the health of the
general population of French Bulldogs in the UK is of
increasing importance to provide evidence on both
breed and husbandry related welfare concerns.
The most common disorders identified in the current
study for French Bulldogs were otitis externa, diarrhoea,
conjunctivitis, overlong nails and skin fold dermatitis.
These results provide a framework to identify health pri-
orities from a prevalence perspective in French Bulldogs
that can contribute positively to reforms that aim to
improve health and welfare within the breed. Although
longevity did not differ between males and females,
marked sex differences in disorder prevalence were
observed, with males were more likely than females to
be diagnosed 8 of the 26 most common fine-level preci-
sion disorders, and 6 of the 15 most common grouped-
level precision disorders. These additional sex-based
prevalence data can highlight those disorders that would
benefit from special focus within specific sexes in order to
contribute to improved French Bulldog health and welfare
as well as assisting decision-making by veterinarians and

 owners on the most appropriate sex selection [10]. The
current study data do not provide a strong rationale to
explain the disorder prevalence differences between males
and females but these may be associated with differing
body sizes (13.7 kg in males versus 11.5 kg in females) or
hormonal profiles between the sexes [29]. Sex-associated
differences in dogs for disorder prevalence in multi-
disorder studies have also been reported for Rottweilers
[30], Border Terriers [31] and German Shepherd Dogs
[32] and may represent an under-explored area of research
that could enhance our understanding of disease causality.
URT disorders were the fourth most common grouped-
level disorder, reported in 12.7% of French Bulldogs. The
most commonly recorded fine level disorders within the
URT group included brachycephalic obstructive airway
syndrome (BOAS) (2.4%), URT disorder (2.1%), and sten-
otic nares (1.7%). BOAS encompasses a range of primary
or secondary disorders that may include stenotic nares,
enlarged tonsils, elongated soft palate, everted lateral
saccules of the larynx, narrowed rima glottides, collapse of
the larynx and tracheal hypoplasia [33, 34]. BOAS is
considered a major animal welfare concern, with the lives
of affected animals negatively impacted both while awake
and asleep by clinical signs including chronic breathless-
ness, exercise intolerance, eating difficulties and disrupted
sleeping including periods of apnoea [35]. The relatively
low prevalence of recorded diagnoses of BOAS and other
respiratory problems in the current primary-care popula-
tion using a retrospective observational study design is in
sharp
contrast
with the
findings
from some other
prospective clinical studies. A prospective study of BOAS
in the UK reported that 70% of French Bulldogs attending
a referral veterinary hospital and 75% of a general popula-
tion of French Bulldogs had BOAS based on clinical

 history, owner questionnaire and clinical examination [7].
A UK clinical study using whole-body barometric plethys-
mography reported that 89.9% of French Bulldogs tested
were affected by BOAS to some extent, with 53.9%
exhibiting clinically relevant disease [9]. These latter data
suggest that many truly BOAS-affected French Bulldogs
may be accepted as ‘normal for breed’ by owner and the
veterinary profession because the pervasively high true
prevalence of the disorder may conflate perceptions of
‘typically expected’ and ‘desirably expected’. The authors
would strongly encourage veterinarians, breeders and
owners to avoid the use of the word ‘normal’ with its in-
ference of acceptability in relation to breed-related health
features and move instead to alternative terms such as
‘typical’ or ‘commonplace’. Indeed, only 42% of owners of
dogs affected by BOAS perceive that their dog has a
breathing problem; as such, it is possible that only the
most severely affected cases may receive a formal BOAS
diagnosis in the primary-care setting [36]. Psychological
desensitisation in veterinarians to URT in brachycephalic
dogs may result from chronic exposure to common
clinical signs of BOAS (e.g. increased and/or abnormal
respiratory noise) in brachycephalic breeds such as the
French Bulldog that potentially leads to underreporting in
clinical notes. Unfortunately, this may also contribute to
the
sub-optimal
clinical
management
of
individual
affected dogs if the condition is under-recognised and not
discussed with clients. An earlier VetCompass™ study
reported that 20% of French Bulldogs had least one URT
disorder recorded over a 4.5 year study period, compared
to the one year period of the current study, so it is pos-
sible that more French Bulldogs in the current population
would go on to be diagnosed with URT disorders with a
longer study period [34]. The current study reports that

 older dogs are significantly more likely to have a diagnosis
of BOAs than younger dogs and suggests that the UK
population of French Bulldogs are likely to show substan-
tially higher levels of BOAS as the current cohort of dogs
ages.
Dermatological disorders were a commonly recorded
grouped-level event in French Bulldogs, with 17.9% of
the study population affected. At the fine-level of dis-
order reporting, skin fold dermatitis was the fifth most
common disorder (3.0%), followed by pyoderma (2.7%),
pododermatitis (2.5%) and atopic dermatitis (2.0%). Skin
disease is well-recognised as a breed-specific issue in
French Bulldogs, with both hair loss or scarring from
previous dermatitis and signs of dermatitis in skin folds
listed as points of concern in ‘Breed Watch’ for the
breed [1]. Skin fold dermatitis may occur at any site on
the body where excessive skin wrinkling causes skin-on-
skin contact, including the facial region of brachyceph-
alic dogs or in skin folds around absent, short or screw-
tails [37]. Skin fold dermatitis (intertrigo) was also a
common finding in a previous VetCompass™ study of
Pugs [38], another brachycephalic breed where skin folds
are common, particularly on the face (referred to as
‘over nose wrinkle’) [1]. Although an over nose wrinkle
is not explicitly encouraged, The Kennel Club (UK)
French Bulldog breed standard specifies that skin on the
skull and forehead “should be supple enough to allow
fine wrinkling” [1]; and the American Kennel Club breed
standard describes “heavy wrinkles forming a soft roll
over the extremely short nose” [39]. In addition to
conformation-related skin disorders, the French Bulldog
has also been reported as both predisposed to canine
atopic dermatitis [40] and also reported as developing
clinical signs of atopic dermatitis earlier than other
breeds, which may suggest a higher genetic predispos-
ition [41]. The median age of dogs affected with atopic
dermatitis in the current study was 3.8 years and the
condition was significantly more likely in dogs older
than 2 years (Table 4). In a breed such as the French
Bulldog where immune-mediated skin disease is com-
mon, ensuring their conformation does not exacerbate
existing skin disorders, or directly cause skin disease in
itself should be of priority for breed welfare. As pro-
posed in the Independent Inquiry into Dog Breeding,
“Where a problem within a breed already exists, the
Breed Standard should be amended specifically to en-
courage the selection for morphologies that will improve
the welfare status of the breed” [42]. Amending breed
standards and breeding away from skin folds may go
some way to encourage healthier skin conformation and
improve breed health.
Ophthalmological disorders (10.5%) were the fifth
most
common
grouped-level
disorder
for
French
Bulldogs, with conjunctivitis (3.2%), prolapsed nictitans
gland (2.6%) and ulcerative keratitis (2.1%) in the top 20
most common fine-level disorders for the breed. A pre-
vious VetCompass™ study of corneal ulceration reported
that French Bulldogs had the 8th highest breed preva-
lence for this disorder (prevalence: 1.87%) and had a
five-times increased odds of diagnosis with corneal
ulceration compared with crossbreeds [13]. The median
age at diagnosis of corneal ulceration across all breeds in

 the UK has been reported as 4.9 years [13]. This value is
higher than the median of 2.79 years reported in the
current study and may reflect the relative youth of the
French Bulldog population. A prospective clinical study
reported that 15.4% of French Bulldogs were affected by
corneal ulcers [8], with conformational risk factors for
corneal ulcers across dog breeds also identified in the
same study. These included the presence of a nasal fold,
brachycephalic skull shape and wide eyelid openings, all
of which are commonly observed in French Bulldogs [8].
The UK Kennel Club has taken efforts to redress these
associations, with ‘excessively prominent eyes’ and ‘in-
complete blink’ (lagophthalmos) identified as points of
concern for the French Bulldog in Breed Watch [1].
Given that the canine cornea is densely innervated by
nociceptive afferent axons and that in a previous study,
69.1% of canine corneal ulcers cases had either pain re-
corded in their notes and/or received pain management
[13], ensuring that skull, eyelid and eye conformation do
not predispose dogs to these welfare-relevant disorders
is of major welfare importance.
Aggression was the thirteenth most common fine-level
disorder recorded in French Bulldogs (2.3%). In contrast,
aggression did not feature among the 25 most common
fine-level disorders in Pugs in the UK [38]. The differing
age distributions of the two study populations (3.0 years
median age of Pug population versus 1.3 years median
age in the current French Bulldog study) are unlikely to
explain the differing aggression prevalence since the
current study identified that aggression was more com-
mon in dogs older than 2 years compared with dogs
younger than 2 years [43]. In addition, both studies had
similar ratios of males and females overall. This relatively
high level of aggression in the French Bulldog is somewhat
surprising in light of the finding that owners of French
Bulldogs were influenced to buy their breed by a percep-
tion that they were a ‘good companion breed’ and ‘good
with children’ [5], with their temperament described as a
‘deeply affectionate’ in their UK breed standard [1]. As
such, further data on the behaviour of French Bulldogs are
required to more precisely characterise the types of
aggression seen and explore the underlying motivation for
these behaviours. As in previous studies, a higher male
prevalence of aggression was observed in French Bulldogs
(males 3.7% vs. females 0.8%), which may be related to
androgens promoting competitive behaviour [44, 45].
During the one-year period of surveillance (2013) of
this study, 27.6% of French Bulldogs under veterinary
care did not have any disorders recorded and were in-
stead either presented for routine or prophylactic veter-
inary care or did not attend the veterinary clinic at all.
This value is comparable with the 24% of dogs without
any recorded disorders that was reported across a ran-
dom sample of all breeds in the VetCompass™ database
[46]. With well-documented health concerns in French
Bulldogs, it is perhaps surprising that the proportion of
French Bulldogs with at least one disorder recorded is
not higher than for the overall population. However, this
may be explained by the younger age of French Bulldogs
in the current study (median age: 1.3 years) compared
with the overall dog population in the previous study
(median age: 4.5 years). It has previously been docu-
mented that French bulldogs are very young when they
exhibit their first veterinary care event (less than two
years compared to around five years for all breeds [6]),
which may reflect that the health problems of the
breed are more related to congenital disorders instead
of acquired and age-related diseases [6]. The young
median age of 1.3 years in the current study may also
explain why periodontal disease, the second most
common disorder affecting dogs overall in the UK
[46] did not feature amongst the common disorders
of French Bulldogs. In addition, although spinal cord
disorders were a common cause of death in the
current study, and Hansen type I disc herniation
(IVDH) has been reported to be the most common
neurological disease in French Bulldogs [15], spinal
disorders did not feature amongst the most common
disorders in the present study. This is again likely
due to the young age of this study population, with
81% of French Bulldogs affected by IVDH aged 3 years
old or more [15]. The current study identified that
38% of the common disorders recorded in French
Bulldogs were associated with age with equal proportions
showing higher prevalence in older and younger dogs. It is
planned to repeat the current study in the future and this
may identify shifting disorder profiles towards diseases of
aging and away from disorders of youth assuming that
breed popularity wanes over time.
The study had some limitations that have been previ-
ously reported [46]. The study was unable to segregate
and compare between Kennel Club registered and un-
registered dogs but ongoing efforts underway within the
VetCompass™ Programme should enable such distinc-
tions in the future and could contribute to greater clarity
on the health comparisons between these two groups.
Studies based on reviews of medical records of animals
may under-estimate the true disease burden by pre-
dominantly including those more severely affected an-
imals that warrant veterinary management and there
may be reduced reporting of less severely affected
animals that may be less likely to be clinically pre-
sented [47]. Clinical variants of some diseases may be
recorded using distinct disorder terms and therefore
the overall prevalence for these diseases may be frag-
mented into separate prevalence values for each of
multiple
more-specific
diagnostic
term,
giving
the
illusion of lower prevalence [10].

 Conclusion
This study of over two thousand French Bulldogs
documented steeply rising ownership of French Bulldogs
in the UK and provides important disorder information
on the general population of French Bulldogs. The most
common
disorders
in
French
Bulldogs
were
otitis
externa, diarrhoea and conjunctivitis. The skin was the
most affected body region, with skin fold dermatitis,
pyoderma and pododermatitis in the top ten most com-
mon disorders of French Bulldogs. These results provide
a framework to identify health priorities in French
Bulldogs and can contribute positively to reforms to
improve health and welfare within the breed.
