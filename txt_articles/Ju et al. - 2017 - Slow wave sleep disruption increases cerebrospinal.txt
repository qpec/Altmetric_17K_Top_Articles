Sleep deprivation increases amyloid-b, suggesting that chronically disrupted sleep may promote amyloid plaques and other down-
stream Alzheimer’s disease pathologies including tauopathy or inflammation. To date, studies have not examined which aspect of
sleep modulates amyloid-b or other Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers. Seventeen healthy adults (age 35–65 years) without sleep
disorders underwent 5–14 days of actigraphy, followed by slow wave activity disruption during polysomnogram, and cerebrospinal
fluid collection the following morning for measurement of amyloid-b, tau, total protein, YKL-40, and hypocretin. Data were
compared to an identical protocol, with a sham condition during polysomnogram. Specific disruption of slow wave activity
correlated with an increase in amyloid-b40 (r = 0.610, P = 0.009). This effect was specific for slow wave activity, and not for
sleep duration or efficiency. This effect was also specific to amyloid-b, and not total protein, tau, YKL-40, or hypocretin.
Additionally, worse home sleep quality, as measured by sleep efficiency by actigraphy in the six nights preceding lumbar punctures,
was associated with higher tau (r = 0.543, P = 0.045). Slow wave activity disruption increases amyloid-b levels acutely, and poorer
sleep quality over several days increases tau. These effects are specific to neuronally-derived proteins, which suggests they are likely
driven by changes in neuronal activity during disrupted sleep.

 Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease pathology is associated with sleep dis-
ruption, even in the preclinical stages of disease (Ju et al.,
2013; Spira et al., 2013). Amyloid plaque formation, an
early necessary step in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis, is
associated with sleep disruption in a bi-directional manner
(Ju et al., 2014). Soluble amyloid-b varies diurnally in both
mouse and human (Kang et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2012),
where sleep is associated with decreased amyloid-b, and
wakefulness with increased amyloid-b. Sleep deprivation
acutely increases soluble amyloid-b and chronically in-
creases amyloid plaques in mouse (Kang et al., 2009;
Roh et al., 2014), and one night of total sleep deprivation
increases soluble amyloid-b in humans (Ooms et al., 2014).
However, it is unknown which aspect of sleep is respon-
sible for modulation of amyloid-b. Slow wave activity
(SWA), which occurs during deep non-REM sleep, is a
strong candidate for amyloid-b modulation. The EEG
slow waves that characterize SWA represent decreased syn-
aptic activity (Nir et al., 2011), and soluble amyloid-b is
released into the interstitial space during neuronal synaptic
activity (Cirrito et al., 2005). Furthermore, clearance of
solutes from the interstitial space, including exogenous
amyloid-b, accelerates during SWA-rich sleep (Xie et al.,
2013). These data lead to the hypothesis that disrupted
SWA would cause relatively increased neuronal activity,
increased amyloid-b release and decreased clearance, result-
ing in increased amyloid-b levels measurable in the CSF.
Indeed, in cross-sectional studies, SWA was negatively cor-
related with CSF amyloid-b in middle-aged (Ju et al., 2016)
and older (Varga et al., 2016) individuals. Furthermore,
chronic sleep disruption increases tau levels and tau phos-
phorylation in mice (Rothman et al., 2013; Qiu et al.,
2016). Tau is also released during neuronal activity, al-
though clearance from the brain is slower than for amyl-
oid-b (Yamada et al., 2014).
In this study, we used a novel SWA disruption protocol
to test
whether
specific disruption
of SWA
leads
to
increased amyloid-b and tau levels in CSF.
Materials and methods
Participants
We enrolled 22 participants aged 35–65 years from a commu-
nity-based
research
registry
at
Washington
University.
Participants had no comorbidities except controlled hyperten-
sion, took no neuro-active medications, had normal neuro-
logical exams, reported 414 alcoholic beverages weekly, had
body mass index 18–40 kg/m2, and were cognitively normal
based on history, neurological examination, and Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE) 527/30 (Folstein et al., 2004).
Participants had regular sleep schedules with bedtime 8 pm–
12 am and wake time 4 am–8 pm. Participants did not have
obstructive sleep apnoea or periodic limb movement disorder,
defined as apnoea-hypopnoea index 55 or periodic limb
movement index 515, during a screening polysomnogram.
All participants provided informed, written consent. All pro-
cedures were approved by the Washington University Human
Research Protection Office.
Experimental design
All participants underwent two sets of procedures, 528 days
apart. Each procedure set consisted of a daytime visit with
questionnaires, actigraphy for 5–14 days, overnight polysom-
nogram with experimental condition, and lumbar puncture the
following morning. An automated SWA disruption protocol
was applied for one polysomnogram, and a sham condition
was used for the other, in random order. SWA disruption was
performed with parameters and methods determined to be ef-
fective in this age group (Ooms et al., 2017). Briefly, every
10 s, EEG data were extracted from the live recording. If the
data were determined be non-artefactual, and 0.5–4 Hz spec-
tral power was 4100 mV2�s indicating SWA, a tone was de-
livered through earphones to the participant. The amplitude of
the tones would progressively increase, until delta power
decreased, indicating an arousal out of SWA. During sham
condition, participants wore earphones but no tones were de-
livered. The order of the two conditions was random, and
participants were blinded to the condition. All analyses were
conducted blinded to condition.
Sleep and EEG spectral analysis
Polysomnograms and sleep staging by a registered polysomno-
graphic technologist were performed according to standard
criteria (Iber, 2007). Lights out was at 10 pm, lights on at
6 am. SWA was quantified as spectral power in the delta
(0.5–4 Hz) band, or ‘delta power’, averaged over all non-
REM epochs, from bilateral frontal and central electrodes.
EEG collection and analysis parameters are detailed in the
Supplementary material.
Actigraphy data were collected using Actiwatch2
TM (Philips-
Respironics) and scored as previously described (Ju et al.,
2013; see Supplementary material). Participants were in-
structed to keep regular sleep schedules prior to polysomno-
grams. If actigraphy did not demonstrate 56 h in bed and
bedtime 8 pm–12 am on the night prior to either polysomno-
gram, the participant was excluded. This criterion excluded
four participants.
To assess home sleep, actigraphy data from six nights (poly-
somnogram night and five preceding nights) were scored using
polysomnographically-validated criteria (Kushida et al., 2001)
to derive total sleep time and sleep efficiency (total sleep time
divided by time in bed). Time in bed was calculated as minutes
between bedtime and wake time, mid-sleep as the halfway-
point between bedtime and wake time. Three participants
wore a defective actigraph that prevented determination of
total sleep time and sleep efficiency.
CSF analytes and APOE genotype
CSF was obtained by lumbar puncture at 9:30–10 am follow-
ing polysomnography. This time corresponds to the daily nadir
of CSF amyloid-b40 (Huang et al., 2012), and follows the sleep
mid-point by �6 h, the transit time of amyloid-b from CNS to

 CSF (Bateman et al., 2006). CSF was immediately placed on
ice, aliquoted, and frozen at �80�C. Amyloid-b40 was chosen
as the primary measure of amyloid-b since it is the most abun-
dant amyloid-b species and less subject to altered levels caused
by amyloid plaques. Amyloid-b40, amyloid-b42, and tau, were
assessed by INNOTEST
� ELISA (Fujirebio). Total protein was
assessed by Bradford assay (Thermo Pierce). YKL-40, a glial
marker of neuroinflammation, was assessed by MicroVue
ELISA (Quidel) (Sutphen et al., 2015). Hypocretin-1 was as-
sessed by radioimmunoassay as previously described (Mignot
et al., 2002). All CSF measurements were performed in dupli-
cate or triplicate with several internal control samples.
As existing amyloid plaques abolish the diurnal variation of
amyloid-b related to sleep, (Huang et al., 2012; Roh et al.,
2012), individuals with abnormally low amyloid-b42 levels
(5608 pg/ml) indicating amyloid plaques were excluded. Cut-
off level was determined by the Knight Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center Biomarker Core by comparison of amyloid-
b42 values and Pittsburgh compound B PET data from large
cohorts (Fagan et al., 2006; Schindler et al., 2016). Two par-
ticipants were excluded based on this criterion; one had already
been excluded for inadequate actigraphically-measured sleep.
Fasted blood (20 ml) was drawn following lumbar puncture,
and placed on ice until centrifugation and storage at �80�C.
The Hope Center DNA/RNA Purification Core performed
DNA extraction and APOE genotyping. Genotype was dichot-
omized as APOE "4 carrier or non-carrier.
Questionnaires
The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Johns, 1991) and Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index (Buysse et al., 1989) were completed
during the daytime visits 5–14 days prior to each polysomno-
gram to assess sleepiness and sleep quality, respectively.
Immediately following each polysomnogram, participants com-
pleted the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (Hoddes et al., 1973), a
measure of immediate subjective sleepiness. They also com-
pleted a written questionnaire which asked: ‘Do you recall
being woken during the night because of the noises through
the earphones?’; ‘If yes, how many times do you think you
woke up because of the noises?’; estimated sleep time in hours;
and Sleep quality on a scale of 1–10 (10 best).
Statistical analysis
All continuous variables were assessed for normal distribution
by inspection of histograms and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Levene’s
test
was
used
to
assess
equality
of
variances.
Differences between SWA disruption and sham conditions
for continuous variables were calculated using paired t-tests
for
normally-distributed
variables,
and
related-samples
Wilcoxon signed rank test for other variables. Correlations
were assessed with Spearman’s correlation coefficient. To com-
pare participants grouped by order of polysomnogram condi-
tion,
APOE
genotype,
or
response
to
SWA
disruption,
unpaired t-tests were used to compare continuous variables
and Fisher exact tests were used to compare dichotomous vari-
ables. Tests were two-tailed, and � was 0.05. Statistical ana-
lyses were performed with SPSS 24 (IBM). Figures were
generated in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc).
As interindividual amyloid-b variation (�30%) is much
greater
than intraindividual
amyloid-b
variation
(�10%),
and may be subject to APOE genotype (Osorio et al., 2014),
a repeated-measures design was selected. From preliminary
cross-sectional data, the effect size for variance in amyloid-
b40 explained by SWA was f = 0.25. Assuming a moderate
(0.7) correlation between repeated measures, � 0.05, and
power 0.8, a total sample size of 20 was calculated. We
stopped enrolment when 20 participants had completed the
study, and two others already enrolled were permitted to com-
plete the study, for a total of 22 participants.
Results
Twenty-two participants completed the study; five partici-
pants were excluded for predefined exclusion criteria, for a
sample size of 17. The study population was middle-aged
(54.1 � 6.7 years) with a slight majority Caucasian race
and female sex (65% each), and five (29%) were APOE
"4 carriers. Questionnaire-based sleep measures were in the
normal range and actigraphy showed normal home sleep
patterns (Table 1).
The SWA disruption protocol decreased SWA as mea-
sured by delta power by 23 (95% confidence interval 14–
32) mV2�s. As expected, there was decreased N3 sleep
with a compensatory increase in N1 sleep during the
SWA disruption night, and a decrease in REM sleep; other-
wise there was no difference in other polysomnographic
sleep variables (Table 1). The participants who underwent
SWA disruption first were similar to the participants who
underwent sham condition first (Supplementary Table 1).
Participants estimated sleep was of shorter duration and
worse quality with SWA disruption, although subjective
sleepiness was no different in the morning (Table 1).
SWA disruption was strongly and significantly correlated
with amyloid-b40, such that more SWA disruption was
associated with greater increases in amyloid-b40 (Fig. 1A).
This effect was specific for SWA disruption, and not for
total sleep time, non-REM time, REM time, or sleep effi-
ciency (Fig. 1B–E). While in the entire group there was no
significant difference in amyloid-b40 levels between condi-
tions, the subset with sufficient SWA disruption (greater
than median, or 520 mV2�s decrease) had a significant
increase in amyloid-b40 (Fig. 1F). These ‘responders’ to
the SWA disruption protocol essentially drove the correl-
ation between SWA disruption and amyloid-b40 change.
We then assessed whether the effect of SWA on amyloid-
b40 was specific to amyloid-b. There was no correlation
between SWA disruption and change in total protein (Fig.
2A). YKL-40 (an astrocyte-derived inflammatory protein)
and tau (a neuronally-derived protein), both biomarkers
increased in Alzheimer’s disease, were not correlated with
SWA disruption (Fig. 2B and C). Hypocretin, a wake-pro-
moting peptide that may modulate amyloid-b kinetics and
is increased after REM sleep deprivation (Pedrazzoli et al.,
2004; Roh et al., 2014), was not correlated with SWA
disruption (Fig. 2D). Supporting the relationship between
SWA and amyloid-b, in addition to the strong correlation
between SWA and amyloid-b40, SWA disruption was also

 strongly correlated with amyloid-b42 (Supplementary Fig. 1).
The
CSF
amyloid-b42:amyloid-b40
ratio
decreased
with
greater
SWA
disruption,
but
this
was
not
significant
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
Extracellular levels of tau in the brain, like amyloid-b, are
regulated by neuronal activity, but the half-life of tau is
longer, 11 days in the mouse brain (Yamada et al.,
2014). As SWA disruption did not lead to changes in tau
the following morning, we compared actigraphically-mea-
sured home sleep over six preceding nights to CSF tau
levels. There was a significant negative correlation between
home sleep quality and tau, such that worse sleep efficiency
was associated with higher tau (Fig. 3A). Sleep quantity
was not correlated with tau (Fig. 3B). A strong trend for
a correlation between home sleep quality and amyloid-b40
was apparent (Fig. 3C); however, this effect was likely di-
minished by SWA disruption immediately prior to the
lumbar punctures. There was no association between amyl-
oid-b40 and sleep quantity, or between total protein and
either sleep quantity or quality (Fig. 3D–F).

ruption

 following morning. We found a strong association between
SWA and amyloid-b, where greater SWA disruption was
associated with increased amyloid-b. This effect was spe-
cific for SWA and not sleep quantity or quality, and was
also specific for amyloid-b but not other CSF proteins.
Additionally, we found that worse home sleep quality
was associated with increased CSF tau, consistent with
sleep disruption affecting CNS tau, but with such changes
requiring a longer time to detect likely due to the longer
half-life of tau.
Both of these findings support the hypothetical cascade in
which decreased SWA leads to increased soluble amyloid-b
and tau levels, which eventually increase risk of amyloid
plaques (Bero et al., 2011) and tau tangle pathology, and
subsequent development of symptomatic Alzheimer’s dis-
ease. Furthermore, the specificity of our findings for neu-
ronally-derived proteins (amyloid-b and tau) and not for
the glial-derived YKL-40 nor for total CSF protein levels
suggests that SWA affects amyloid-b and tau by influencing
synaptic activity with decreased release of these proteins
into the interstitial space, rather than by affecting general
protein clearance mechanisms. That total protein levels in
CSF were unaffected suggests there were no global effects
of SWA disruption on bulk flow mechanisms by which al-
bumin and other abundant proteins enter and exit the
CNS.
While

Figure 1 Decreased slow wave activity is associated with increased CSF amyloid-b. (A) Suppression of slow wave activity, as
measured by the change in delta spectral power, was strongly correlated with increased amyloid-b40 (r = 0.610, P = 0.009). There was no
correlation between change in amyloid-b40 levels and (B) total sleep time (r = �0.075, P = 0.782), (C) time in non-REM sleep (r = �0.156,
P = 0.564), (D) time in REM sleep (r = �0.351 P = 0.168), or (E) sleep efficiency (r = �0.007, P = 0.978). (F) When participants are divided at the
median (20 mV2�s) amount of slow wave activity disruption, the ‘responders’ to SWA disruption (blue lines) had a significant increase in amyloid-
b40 (n = 9, 11562 � 2603 versus 10562 � 2868 pg/ml, 95% confidence interval difference 315 to 1686 pg/ml, P = 0.010) while ‘non-responders’
(red lines) did not. X-axes in A–E are more negative to the right, i.e. values to the right indicate more disruption of slow wave activity or less
sleep.

 tended to decrease with greater SWA disruption, this find-
ing was not significant and the study was not powered or
designed to assess relative clearance of amyloid-b isoforms.
It is possible that following amyloid deposition, the relative
clearance of amyloid-b42 from the brain’s interstitial fluid
space to the CSF would be retarded by sequestration of
monomeric amyloid-b42 into plaques (Potter et al., 2013),
which could influence the effect of SWA disruption on CSF
amyloid-b42.
A weakness of the study is the relatively small sample
size. However, the effect size was stronger than predicted
by cross-sectional preliminary data, with a high r of 0.610
for the association between SWA disruption and amyloid-
b40 change. In addition, intraindividual analyses strongly
increased statistical power. Nevertheless, our study was
not a priori powered to assess correlations between SWA
disruption and other CSF proteins, and larger studies are
necessary to definitively exclude a relationship between
SWA and other CSF proteins. Additionally, determining
the relative clearance rates of amyloid-b isoforms, and
any effect of amyloid plaques, will require larger studies
including amyloid-positive individuals. Similarly, due to
the small (n = 5) number of APOE "4 carriers, this study
was underpowered to assess the effect of APOE genotype
on
susceptibility
to
SWA
disruption
(Supplementary
Table 2). Another weakness is that SWA disruption did
not increase amyloid-b in some participants. There were
no differences between ‘responders’ and ‘non-responders’
(Supplementary Table 3) to the SWA disruption protocol
except that ‘non-responders’ had lower baseline SWA
during
the
sham
night
(delta
power
86
versus
147 mV2�s,
P = 0.009).
Since
the
same
delta
power
4100 mV2�s cut-off was used in all participants for deliv-
ery of tones during SWA disruption, low baseline SWA
made it difficult to reduce SWA further, and therefore
blunted any effect on amyloid-b. Another minor weakness
is that amyloid imaging was not used to exclude individuals
with amyloid deposition; however, low CSF amyloid-b42
levels correlate well with amyloid deposition detected by
PET (Fagan et al., 2006, 2009). Lastly, this experiment
tested only the effect of SWA disruption; we cannot infer
any
information
about
the
effect
of
increasing
SWA
on
synaptic
activity
or
protein
clearance
from
this
experiment.
Our study supports the hypothesis that SWA and sleep
quality modulate amyloid-b and tau levels, respectively.
Prospective studies will be required to test whether improv-
ing sleep quality and increasing SWA by treating underly-
ing sleep disorders, medications, behavioural interventions,
or acoustic enhancement of SWA can reduce amyloid-b
levels, long-term risk of amyloid deposition, and progres-
sion to Alzheimer’s disease.
Figure 2 Slow wave activity disruption is not correlated with change in other CSF proteins. SWA disruption, as measured by the
change in delta spectral power, was not correlated with change in (A) total protein (r = 0.098, P = 0.708), (B) YKL-40 (r = �0.199, P = 0.445),
(C) tau (r = 0.000, P = 1.000), or (D) hypocretin (r = �0.250, P = 0.333). X-axes are more negative to the right, i.e. values to the right indicate
more disruption of slow wave activity.

Figure 3 Worse home sleep quality over six nights is associated with increased CSF tau. Home sleep was quantified by actigra-
phically-measured sleep variables for the six nights prior to lumbar punctures. Valid actigraphy data were available for n = 14 participants. For
consistency with other figures, sleep variables are shown as the six nights that included SWA disruption protocol night minus the six nights that
included the sham condition night; however, the differences in total sleep time or sleep efficiency reflect variations in home sleep and are not
related to the protocol or sham condition. For consistency with other figures, x-axes are more negative to the right, i.e. values to the right
indicate less or worse sleep. (A) Worse sleep quality, as measured as the sleep efficiency, was associated with greater tau levels (r = 0.543,
P = 0.045). (C) There was a strong but non-significant trend for an association between worse home sleep quality and amyloid-b40 levels
(r = 0.481, P = 0.081), but (E) there was no correlation between sleep quality and total protein (r = �0.218, P = 0.455). Change in home sleep
quantity, as measured by actigraphically-determined total sleep time, had no correlation with (B) tau (r = 0.103, P = 0.725), (D) amyloid-b40
(r = 0.218, P = 0.455), or (F) total protein (r = �0.103, P = 0.725).
