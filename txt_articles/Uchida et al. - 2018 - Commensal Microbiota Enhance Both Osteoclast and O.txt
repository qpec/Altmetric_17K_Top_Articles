Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the commensal microbiota affects not only host energy
metabolism and development of immunity but also bone remodeling by positive regulation of
osteoclast activity. However, the mechanism of regulation of bone cells by the commensal microbiota
has not been elucidated. In this study, 8-week-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF)
mice were compared in terms of alveolar bones and primary osteoblasts isolated from calvarias.
Micro-CT analysis showed that SPF mice had larger body size associated with lower bone mineral
density and bone volume fraction in alveolar bones compared with GF mice. Greater numbers
of osteoclasts in alveolar bone and higher serum levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b
were observed in SPF mice.
Tissue extracts from SPF alveolar bone showed higher levels of
cathepsin K, indicating higher osteoclast activity.
SPF alveolar extracts also showed elevated
levels of γ-carboxylated glutamic acid–osteocalcin as a marker of mature osteoblasts compared
with GF mice. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array analysis of RNA directly isolated from
alveolar bone showed that in SPF mice, expression of mRNA of osteocalcin, which also acts as
an inhibitor of bone mineralization, was strongly enhanced compared with GF mice. Cultured
calvarial osteoblasts from SPF mice showed reduced mineralization but significantly enhanced
expression of mRNAs of osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, insulin-like growth factor-I/II, and decreased
ratio of osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand compared with GF mice.
Furthermore, PCR array analyses of transcription factors in cultured calvarial osteoblasts showed
strongly upregulated expression of Forkhead box g1. In contrast, Gata-binding protein 3 was strongly
downregulated in SPF osteoblasts. These results suggest that the commensal microbiota prevents
excessive mineralization possibly by stimulating osteocalcin expression in osteoblasts, and enhances
both osteoblast and osteoclast activity by regulating specific transcription factors.

1. Introduction
All mammals are exposed to environmental microorganisms, known as the commensal microbiota,
after birth, and these organisms play important roles in maintaining homeostasis, such as in energy
homeostasis [1] and innate immunity [2]. Recent studies suggest that the commensal microbiota can
also influence bone remodeling [3–6].
Germ-free (GF) animals provide an invaluable experimental tool for examining interactions
between a host and its microbiota. GF mice have hypoplastic Peyer’s patches, with reduced numbers
of IgA-producing plasma cells and lamina propria CD4+ T cells [7]. Furthermore, GF mice have
reduced adiposity and improved tolerance to glucose and insulin when compared to conventional
specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice [8].
The term “osteomicrobiology” has recently been proposed by Ohlsson et al. [9] and Jones et al. [10]
to refer to the role of the commensal microbiota in regulating postnatal skeletal development, bone
development, bone aging, and pathologic bone loss. Bone metabolism, which is regulated by a bone
turnover process that depends on the balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts [11], is controlled by
multiple systemic factors, including hormones, cytokines, and the immune system [12]. The effects
of the immune system on bone remodeling have been investigated in recent studies generally by
comparing SPF mice with GF mice [3,5,12]. GF mice established in the C57BL/6 strain have increased
bone mass and density compared with SPF mice [3]. Furthermore, another report showed that the
commensal microbiota exerts anti-anabolic effects (suppressing osteoblastogenesis) and pro-catabolic
effects (enhancing osteoclastogenesis) in C57BL/6 mice [12]. Our group reported that SPF mice in
the C3H/Orl strain exhibit increased numbers of osteoclasts per area of bone compared with GF
mice [13]. Furthermore, histomorphometric analysis revealed increased alveolar bone loss in SPF
mice compared with GF mice [13]. On the other hand, the SPF microbiota in the CB6F1 strain of mice
increased bone formation rates and growth plate thickness [5]. The gut microbiota has pro-anabolic
actions, enhancing liver insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1–mediated skeletal growth in BALB/c and
CB6F1 (mixed BALB/c and C57BL/6 background) mice [5,14]. The discrepancy in bone phenotype
among previous studies is thought to be due to the potential influence of different mouse backgrounds
on the osteoimmunoregulatory effects of the gut microbiota [3,5,12,14–16]. However, the details are
not well understood.
Osteocalcin, a marker of osteoblasts, plays roles in bone formation and bone homeostasis.
Osteocalcin can be carboxylated at glutamic acid residues (Glu) by vitamin K–dependent carboxylase
and converted into γ-carboxylated osteocalcin (Gla-osteocalcin). Although Gla-osteocalcin is embedded
in mineralized bone, osteocalcin knockout mice showed excessive mineralized bone formation.
Therefore, osteocalcin was considered to inhibit bone mineralization [17]. Recent studies revealed
that osteocalcin influences not only bones but also other organs [18,19]. Glu-osteocalcin regulates
blood glucose levels by increasing insulin secretion and β-cell proliferation in the pancreas and by
changing insulin sensitivity in adipose tissues, muscles, and liver [18]. Furthermore, osteocalcin
induces testosterone production in Leydig cells of the testes [19]. Therefore, osteocalcin is now
considered an important factor in the maintenance of whole-body homeostasis. Whereas Novince et al.
reported higher expression of osteocalcin in osteoblasts from the femur in GF mice [12], Yan et al.
reported higher expression of the runx2 gene in epiphyseal bone in SPF mice [5]. Due to discrepancies
in the literature, it is therefore unclear how the commensal microbiota affects osteoblast activity.
Based on the hypothesis that the commensal microbiota in SPF mice is involved in bone
remodeling, the aim of this study was to investigate osteoclast and osteoblast activity in alveolar
bones and cultured cells from 8-week-old GF and SPF mice (IQI/Jic). Here, we demonstrate that the
presence or absence of the commensal microbiota affects expression of osteoblast-specific genes and
transcription factors. These findings enhance our understanding of how the commensal microbiota
functions in maintaining bone homeostasis.

2.1. The Commensal Microbiota Increases Body Weight but Reduces Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in
Alveolar Bone
Body weight (Figure 1a) and size (data not shown) were significantly greater in 8-week-old SPF
mice than GF IQI/Jic mice (35.9 ± 0.655 g vs. 32.9 ± 1.097 g) (p < 0.05), in line with previous studies
involving CB6F1 [6] and BALB/c mice [15]. To investigate whether the commensal microbiota affect
microarchitectural changes in alveolar bone, we performed micro computed tomography (CT) analyses
of alveolar bone and measured the root furcation area of the first molar (Figure 1b). Surprisingly,
despite enhanced body weight, the BMD and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of SPF mice were lower
compared with GF mice (p < 0.05, Figure 1c), confirming results from Sjögren et al. [4] and our group [5]
when analyzing long bones. No differences were observed in other microstructural parameters between
GF and SPF mice (Figure 1c).

the commensal microbiota in SPF bone, total RNA was directly collected from SPF and GF alveolar

Changes in gene expression were confirmed by real-time PCR using total RNA from alveolar bones 
(Figure 3b). Protein extracts from alveolar bones of both SPF and GF mice were also collected and 
evaluated by ELISA. Levels of Gla- osteocalcin and cathepsin K were also significantly higher in SPF 
bones than GF bones (p < 0.05) (Figure 3c,d), suggesting that both osteoblastic and osteoclastic gene 
expression are higher in bones of SPF mice than GF mice.

Our data indicated that the commensal microbiota enhanced both osteoclastic and osteoblastic 
gene expression in alveolar bone, in line with several reports showing that the commensal microbiota 
enhances osteoclast activity [3,5,11], although osteoblast activity was not examined in those studies. 
To investigate changes in osteoblast activity in vitro, primary osteoblasts were isolated from SPF and 
GF calvariae and cultured in osteoblastic differentiation medium. Calcification of extracellular matrix 
was examined by alizarin red staining at 1, 3, and 5 weeks of culture. At 1 and 3 weeks of culture, no 
significant differences in alizarin red staining were observed between GF and SPF mice (p > 0.05) 
(Figure 4a,b). However, at 5 weeks of culture, the alizarin red–positive calcified matrix area in 
osteoblast culture was significantly smaller in SPF mice than GF mice (p < 0.05) (Figure 4b,c). These 
results are in line with our micro-CT data (Figure 1), suggesting that the commensal microbiota 
prevents excessive mineralization possibly by stimulating osteocalcin expression in cultured calvarial 
osteoblasts.

Osteoblasts 
To investigate whether changes in gene expression levels seen in SPF alveolar bones also occur 
in cultured osteoblasts, total RNA was isolated from 3- and 5-week cultured osteoblasts, and gene 
expression was analyzed by real-time PCR. The expression of osteoprotegerin (Opg) mRNA at 3 weeks 
in SPF osteoblasts was significantly higher than in GF mice, but not at 5 weeks of culture (p < 0.05) 
(Figure 5a). In contrast, the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (Rankl) mRNA 
was significantly higher in SPF than GF osteoblasts at both 3 and 5 weeks of culture (p < 0.05) (Figure 
5b), and the ratio of Opg/Rankl expression at 5 weeks was significantly lower in SPF than GF 
osteoblasts (p < 0.05) (Figure 5c). Furthermore, expression of Ocn and alkaline phosphatase (Alp) mRNA 
was significantly higher in SPF than GF osteoblasts (p < 0.05) (Figure 5d,e). However, no significant 
differences in the levels of Col1a1 and Col1a2 mRNAs between SPF mice and GF mice were observed 
(Figure 5f,g), but levels of Igf-I and Igf-II mRNAs were higher in SPF than GF osteoblasts cultured for 
5 weeks (p < 0.05) (Figure 5h,i). These data indicate that osteoblast activity, including expression of 
growth-stimulating factors (Igf-I and -II) was enhanced in SPF-derived osteoblasts cultured for 3 and 
5 weeks.

expression was analyzed by real-time PCR. The expression of osteoprotegerin (Opg) mRNA at 3 weeks
in SPF osteoblasts was significantly higher than in GF mice, but not at 5 weeks of culture (p < 0.05)

mRNA was significantly higher in SPF than GF osteoblasts at both 3 and 5 weeks of culture (p < 0.05)

osteoblasts (p < 0.05) (Figure 5c). Furthermore, expression of Ocn and alkaline phosphatase (Alp) mRNA
was significantly higher in SPF than GF osteoblasts (p < 0.05) (Figure 5d,e). However, no significant
differences in the levels of Col1a1 and Col1a2 mRNAs between SPF mice and GF mice were observed
(Figure 5f,g), but levels of Igf-I and Igf-II mRNAs were higher in SPF than GF osteoblasts cultured for

2.6. Gene Expression of Transcription Factors in Cultured Osteoblasts 
To investigate the mechanisms that drive enhanced osteogenic gene expression in SPF 
osteoblasts, expression of transcription factors was analyzed by PCR array using osteoblast RNA. 
Three of the 84 genes on the array exhibited significant differences between GF mice and SPF mice (p 
< 0.05) (Figure 6a). To confirm the data from microarray analyses, real-time PCR analysis was 
performed and confirmed a significant induction of forkhead box gene 1 (Foxg1) and androgen receptor 
(Ar) and a strong repression of Gata binding protein (Gata)-3 in SPF osteoblasts as compared with GF 
osteoblasts (p < 0.05) (Figure 6b–d).

differentiation medium. After culture for the indicated times, total RNA was isolated, and real-time
PCR analysis was performed to assess osteogenic gene expression. Significant differences in expression
of the osteoprotegerin (Opg) gene (a), receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (Rankl) (b) gene,
the Opg/Rankl ratio (c), osteocalcin (Ocn) (d) gene, and alkaline phosphatase (Alp) (e) gene were observed
between GF and SPF osteoblasts. At 5 weeks of culture, no significant differences were observed in
expression of the collagen type I alpha (Col1a) 1 (f) and Col1a2 (g) genes between GF and SPF osteoblasts.
Expression of the insulin-like growth factor (Igf-1 (h) and Igf-2 (i) genes was significantly higher in SPF
osteoblasts than GF osteoblasts at 5 weeks. * p < 0.05, t-test (n = 4/group).
2.6. Gene Expression of Transcription Factors in Cultured Osteoblasts
To investigate the mechanisms that drive enhanced osteogenic gene expression in SPF osteoblasts,
expression of transcription factors was analyzed by PCR array using osteoblast RNA. Three of the
84 genes on the array exhibited significant differences between GF mice and SPF mice (p < 0.05)
(Figure 6a). To confirm the data from microarray analyses, real-time PCR analysis was performed and
confirmed a significant induction of forkhead box gene 1 (Foxg1) and androgen receptor (Ar) and a strong
repression of Gata binding protein (Gata)-3 in SPF osteoblasts as compared with GF osteoblasts (p < 0.05)
(Figure 6b–d).

3. Discussion 
In this study, we focused on bone morphometric and histomorphometric parameters and the 
expression of genes associated with bone metabolism in SPF mice compared with GF mice in vivo 
and in vitro. Whereas several studies have investigated effects on cultured osteoclasts [3,5], only one 
study has reported direct effects of the commensal microbiota on cultured osteoblasts [13] and 
showed anti-anabolic suppression of osteoblastogenesis in SPF mice. However, transcriptional 
regulation of bone metabolism by the commensal microbiota has not been reported. 
First, we investigated the impact of the commensal microbiota on osteoclast activity. We 
detected significantly elevated serum levels of TRAP-5b and increased numbers of TRAP-positive 
osteoclasts in SPF mice. Alveolar bone from SPF mice showed enhanced expression of mRNAs for 
osteoclast markers such as Ctsk, Mmp2, and Mmp9. Furthermore, levels of cathepsin K protein, a 
marker of bone resorption that is highly expressed by osteoclasts [20,21], were significantly higher in 
SPF mice than GF mice. Our previous study also revealed that the number of TRAP-positive 
osteoclasts on the surface of alveolar bone was increased in SPF mice compared with GF mice [13]. 
Although we used a different mouse strain (IQI/Jic) here than in our previous study (C3H/Orl), 
the results of both were the same. Other studies using BALB/c, C57BL/6, and CB6F1 background mice 
described similar results regarding osteoclast activity in the presence or absence of the commensal 
microbiota [3,5,12]. Our results in all mouse strains examined strongly suggest that the presence of 
commensal microbiota is associated with accelerated activation of osteoclasts. 
We also performed comprehensive gene expression analysis to determine the effect on osteoblast 
activity. Microarray profiling of osteogenic expression in alveolar bone revealed that the expression

We also performed comprehensive gene expression analysis to determine the effect on osteoblast
activity. Microarray profiling of osteogenic expression in alveolar bone revealed that the expression
of osteoblast marker genes such as Osteocalcin and Col1a1 was significantly higher in SPF alveolar
bones compared with GF bones (p < 0.05, Figure 3). Osteocalcin is considered a specific marker
of mature osteoblasts. The level of Gla-osteocalcin was also significantly higher in SPF than GF
alveolar extracts. Osteoblasts isolated from SPF calvariae showed dramatically enhanced expression of
osteocalcin in comparison with GF osteoblasts. This is in contrast to another recent study reporting
that the commensal microbiota in C57BL/6 SPF mice suppressed osteocalcin mRNA expression in
calvariae [12]. The reason for this discrepancy between the present and previous studies is unclear,
but it may be related to differences in genetic background (IQI/Jic vs. C57BL/6), age (8 weeks vs.
11 weeks), experimental period (35 days vs. 21 days), and SPF condition (without fecal inoculum vs.
with fecal inoculum).
Furthermore, we demonstrated that cultured SPF osteoblasts exhibit a lower Opg/Rankl ratio and
enhanced expression of Alp related to differentiation of osteoblasts [22]. The present findings support
those of previous studies indicating the normal gut microbiota has significant effects on both anabolic
and catabolic activities in alveolar bone formation and physiologic skeletal growth [3,4].
Osteocalcin is an extracellular matrix protein in mature osteoblasts which is also important for
the regulation of bone mineralization. For example, osteocalcin-knockout mice showed enhanced
bone mineralization [17]. In this study, cultured osteoblasts showed significantly less mineralization in
SPF mice than GF mice, in line with the higher expression of Osteocalcin mRNA in SPF osteoblasts.
Accordingly, our Micro-CT analyses revealed that SPF alveolar bone had lower BMD and BV/TV
compared with that of GF mice, probably due to a lower rate of mineralization. Thus, these data
suggest that the commensal microbiota prevents excessive mineralization possibly by stimulating
osteocalcin expression, which in turn controls bone remodeling.
IGF-1 produced by osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes in an autocrine or paracrine manner
plays an important role in bone remodeling [23–27]. IGF-1 can promote both bone formation and
resorption through direct effects on osteoblasts [28–31]. In our cultured osteoblasts, the levels of Igf-1
and Igf-2 mRNAs were significantly higher in SPF mice than GF mice. The commensal microbiota
reportedly increases insulin/IGF-like peptide activity in Drosophila, and IGF-1 was shown to mediate
the microbiota’s effect on postnatal growth [32]. In BALB/c background mice, the gut microbiota was
shown to enhance skeletal growth via upregulation of liver-derived IGF [14]. Our results suggest
that the microbiota directly induces IGF-1 and -2 expression in osteoblasts, which supports postnatal
growth. However, another previous study showed the opposite result using bone marrow and calvariae
of C57BL/6 mice [12], indicating that expression of the Igf-1 gene in bone marrow and calvariae in GF
mice was higher than in SPF mice. Further studies are required to clarify this discrepancy.
The question arises as to how the presence of the commensal microbiota affects the expression
of osteoblast-specific genes. The results of PCR array analyses of transcription factors in cultured
osteoblasts of SPF mice showed substantial enhancement of the expression of Foxg1 and Ar mRNA
but strong repression of the expression of Gata-3 mRNA in SPF osteoblasts. Foxg1, a member of the
forkhead family of transcription factors, is essential for early brain development [33]. Foxg1 is also
downstream of Igf-1 signaling [34]. A recent study revealed decreased expression of osteocalcin and
Alp mRNAs in Foxg1-knockdown osteoblasts [35]. This is consistent with our finding that osteoblasts
isolated from SPF calvariae showed enhanced expression of osteocalcin and Alp mRNAs in comparison
to GF osteoblasts at 3 and 5 weeks, suggesting that the increase in Foxg1 mRNA may be linked to
upregulated expression of osteocalcin and Alp. Expression of FoxP3, a member of the Fox family
and marker of regulatory T cells, is enhanced by the microbiota [36]. In osteoblasts, the commensal
microbiota may effect expression of the Foxg1 gene via a mechanism similar to that controlling the
T-cell lineage.
The activation of Ar increases long bone growth and size [37]. In osteoblasts, it is critical
for the suppression of androgen activity in osteoclastogenesis [38], but the Ar does not seem to
 Molecules 2018, 23, 1517

suppress bone resorption through direct actions in osteoclasts [39]. Another study showed that the
production of testosterone was reduced in GF mice [40]. In our study, the commensal microbiota may
contribute to upregulation of androgen signaling by increasing Ar numbers in osteoblasts. Gata-3 is
expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells and functions as a master regulator of T helper 2 (Th2) cell
differentiation, regulating T-cell development, proliferation, and death [41]. Recent studies showed
enhanced Th2-mediated immunity in GF mice, and Gata-3–positive cells were more numerous in GF
mice than SPF mice [42]. Osteoblasts may be involved in directing T cell lineage toward Th1 and Th2
immune functions.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Mice
Male GF and SPF IQI/Jic mice were bred and maintained at the Central Institute of Experimental
Animals (Kanagawa, Japan). GF mice (8 weeks old, n = 6) were housed in a Trexler-type flexible film
isolator in a standard GF state and screened on a weekly basis for GF status by sterile feces sampling
and culturing on MRS agar plates under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. SPF mice (8 weeks old, n = 6)
were housed under SPF conditions. All mice were housed in an air-conditioned room (temperature
24 ± 1 ◦C) with a controlled light/dark cycle (lights on between 6:30 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.). Sterile
food and water were available ad libitum. The rearing of the mice was conducted according to the
institutional rules following approval from the Animal Experiment Committee of the Central Institute
for Experimental Animals in Japan (16050A).
4.2. Micro-CT analyses
The mandibular bone was scanned using a desktop non-computed tomography system
(Sky scan1174; Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). The computed tomography settings were
as follows: voltage, 50 mV; current, 800 kA; slice thickness, 7.4 µm. The images were reconstructed
using Nreconc software (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). The area of septal bone of the first molar was
measured using CTAn software (Bruker) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
4.3. Serum ELISA
Whole blood was collected from the cardiac atrium under isoflurane anesthesia, and the serum was
separated by centrifugation (4 ◦C, 10 min, 4000 g). The levels of TRAP-5b, a marker of bone resorption,
were determined using a mouse TRAP Assay kit (IDS, Tyne and Wear, UK). Serum levels of osteocalcin,
a marker of bone formation, were determined using a mouse Gla-osteocalcin high-sensitivity EIA kit
(TAKARA BIO Inc., Shiga, Japan). Absorbance was measured by microplate reader at 405 nm for the
TRAP Assay and at 450 nm for Gla-osteocalcin (SH-1000, Corona, Ibaragi, Japan). Both assays were
performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. All serum samples were assayed in duplicate.
4.4. TRAP Staining
The left alveolar arches of the maxillae were resected en bloc and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 24 h, followed by decalcification in 10% tetrasodium
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid aqueous solution (pH 7.4) for 2 weeks at 4 ◦C. The samples were
dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, then 4-µm-thick serial sections were obtained through the
mesial-distal width of the tooth. To detect TRAP-positive osteoclasts using azo dye methods, sections
were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin. Images were acquired using an IX70 microscope
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) [43,44]. The osteoclast surface/bone surface was measured in the range of
450 µm × 400 µm based on the alveolar crest using ImageJ computer software (NIH).

4.5. Alveolar Bone Homogenates
Alveolar bones from mandibles were manually homogenized using a frozen cell crusher (Microtec
Co., Chiba, Japan) in T-PER reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture
(Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany). Total protein concentration was determined by Bradford
assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Osteocalcin (TAKARA BIO Inc., Shiga, Japan) and cathepsin K
(Cathepsin K Activity Assay kit, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) levels were measured using commercial kits.
Concentrations were calculated using standard curves following the manufacturers’ protocols [45,46].
All bone samples were assayed in duplicate.
4.6. Calvarial Osteoblast Culture
After removal of sutures, calvariae were subjected to a series of collagenase digestions for 30 min
at 37 ◦C on a rocking platform. The first two digests were discarded. The third digest was collected,
and enzyme activity was stopped by addition of an equal volume of αMEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, SH30070.03), 100 U/mL of penicillin,
and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA). Cells were harvested at a density
of 3.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in a 3.5-cm dish in αMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS. At 3 days,
the medium was changed. After 1 week, the medium was changed to differentiation medium (αMEM
containing 10% FBS, 50 mg/mL of ascorbic acid, and 4 mol/mL of beta-glycerophosphate) [47–49].
The medium changes were performed every 3 days. The cells were collected and used for experiments
with 1-, 3- and 5-week cultures.
4.7. Alizarin Red Staining
Cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 100% ethanol for 5 min at room temperature. After
washing cells with PBS, alizarin red staining solution (pH 6.4 with 28% ammonium hydroxide) was
added to the wells and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were washed with PBS. Images
were acquired using an IX70 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) [44]. Mineralized nodules were
visualized, and the staining area was measured using a computerized imaging system (ZEN, ZEISS) at
1, 3, and 5 weeks of culture. Each measurement was repeated three times.
4.8. RNA Preparation and PCR Array
Total RNA was isolated from the alveolar bone and osteoblast cell samples using Trizol reagent
(Invitrogen), in accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions. Isolated RNA was quantified by
measuring the absorbance at 260 nm, and purity was determined by the 260/280 nm absorbance ratio.
Comprehensive gene expression assays were performed using the 96-well RT2 ProfilerTM PCR Array
system (SA Biosciences, Frederick, MD, USA) for the mouse osteogenesis (PAMM-026Z) and mouse
transcription factor (PAMM-072Z) arrays in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Thermal
cycling was performed using a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) with an initial denaturation at 95 ◦C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95 ◦C for 15 s, and 60 ◦C for
1 min. A signal was acquired at 60 ◦C during each cycle. Values of the cycle threshold (Ct) obtained
in quantification were used for calculations of fold changes in mRNA abundance using the 2−∆∆Ct
method [50].
4.9. Real-Time Quantitative PCR
Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a PrimeScript™ RT reagent kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga,
Japan) at 35 ◦C for 15 min and 87 ◦C for 1 min. Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green
Real-time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) in a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Primer sequences are shown in Table 1. The amplification conditions
were as follows: 40 cycles at 95 ◦C (10 s), 64 ◦C (10 s), and 72 ◦C (15 s). The mRNA levels were calculated
in terms of the relative copy number ratio of each mRNA to Gapdh for each sample [43,51].

4.10. Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as means ± standard deviation. Student’s two-tailed unpaired t-tests were
used for comparisons between GF and SPF mice to determine whether there were any significant
differences. All calculations were performed using the statistical software package SPSS 22.0 for
Windows (SPSS Japan, Tokyo, Japan); p < 0.05 was considered significant [51].
5. Conclusions
We demonstrated that the presence of the commensal microbiota prevents excessive mineralization
possibly by stimulating osteocalcin expression in osteoblasts, and enhances the activity of both
osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts may explain discrepancies
in bony phenotypes in different strains of SPF and GF mice. The commensal microbiota plays
an important role in directing the activity of osteoblasts and osteoclasts by regulating upstream
transcription factors.
