In Brief
The suspected link between Zika virus
(ZIKV) infection and microcephaly has
raised urgent global alarm. However,
there is so far no direct evidence for ZIKV
infection impacting brain development. In
this study, Li, Xu, and colleagues show
that ZIKV replicates efficiently in the
mouse embryonic brain by mainly
targeting neural progenitor cells. They
also show that infected brains are smaller
with enlarged ventricles and a thinner
cortex, consistent with a microcephalic
phenotype.

SUMMARY
The link between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and
microcephaly has raised urgent global alarm. The
historical African ZIKV MR766 was recently shown
to infect cultured human neural precursor cells
(NPCs), but unlike the contemporary ZIKV strains, it
is not believed to cause microcephaly. Here we
investigated whether the Asian ZIKV strain SZ01
could infect NPCs in vivo and affect brain develop-
ment. We found that SZ01 replicates efficiently in em-
bryonic mouse brain by directly targeting different
neuronal linages. ZIKV infection leads to cell-cycle
arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition of NPC differentia-
tion, resulting in cortical thinning and microcephaly.
Global gene expression analysis of infected brains
reveals upregulation of candidate flavirus entry re-
ceptors and dysregulation of genes associated with
immune response, apoptosis, and microcephaly.
Our model provides evidence for a direct link be-
tween Zika virus infection and microcephaly, with
potential for further exploration of the underlying
mechanisms and management of ZIKV-related path-
ological effects during brain development.
INTRODUCTION
Recent world attention has been drawn to a global Zika virus
(ZIKV) outbreak and its link with devastating cases of micro-
cephaly. ZIKV infection is spreading rapidly within the Americas
after originating from an outbreak in Brazil. So far 31 countries
and territories in South and Central America have reported the
circulation of this type of mosquito-borne flavivirus (Heukelbach
et al., 2016). There is mounting concern about the association
of ZIKV infection with approximately 5,000 fetal and newborn
microcephaly cases and with serious neurological complications
in adults, such as Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome. In November 2015,
the Brazilian Ministry of Health reported a 20-fold increase in
cases of neonatal microcephaly, which corresponds geograph-
ically and temporally to the ZIKV outbreak (Marrs et al., 2016).
Due to this global threat, WHO declared a public health emer-
gency of international concern on February 1 (Heymann et al.,
2016; Marrs et al., 2016).
Precise timing of proliferation/self-renewal of neural progeni-
tor cells (NPCs) and of their differentiation, neuronal migration,
and maturation are essential for normal mammalian brain devel-
opment. Disturbance of these processes leads to developmental
brain disorders including microcephaly (Kriegstein and Alvarez-
Buylla, 2009; Manzini and Walsh, 2011; Nowakowski et al.,
2016; Thornton and Woods, 2009).
A causal association between ZIKV infection and microcephaly
was proposed based on an increased incidence of microcephaly
coinciding with the ZIKV outbreak and the detection of ZIKV in
both microcephalic fetal brain tissues and the amniotic fluid of
pregnant women with microcephalic fetuses (Calvet et al., 2016;
Driggers et al., 2016; Marrs et al., 2016; Mlakar et al., 2016). In
addition, ZIKV strain MR766 has been shown to be capable of in-
fecting NPCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells
(hiPSCs) (Tang et al., 2016). ZIKV infection induces cell death and
deregulation of cell-cycle progression of hiPSCs, reducing their
viability and growth as neurospheres and brain organoids (Garcez
et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2016, Qian et al., 2016). However, there is
still an urgent demand for direct evidence from mammalian animal
modelsthatZIKVinfectioncancausemicrocephaly.Hereweused
an Asian ZIKV strain, SZ01, isolated from a patient infected in
Samoa (Deng et al., 2016) to investigate whether ZIKV infects
the embryonic mouse brain and affects brain development.
RESULTS
ZIKV Replicates Efficiently in Embryonic Mouse Brain
and Causes Microcephaly
To test whether the contemporary ZIKV strain can infect the em-
bryonic mouse brain, different titers of ZIKV SZ01 or culture me-
dium (mock) were injected into one side of the cerebroventricular
space/lateral ventricle (LV) of embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5)
120

 littermate brains and inspected 3 or 5 days later. Infection of the
embryonic brains was verified by real-time PCR and with immu-
nocytochemistry. The brains were readily infected since an
�300-fold increase of viral RNA copies was detected 3 days
after infection (Figure 1A). Convalescent serum from a ZIKV-in-
fected patient was used for immunocytochemistry staining and
co-stained well with ZIKV envelope antibody (Figure S1). The
numbers of ZIKV-infected cells corresponded to the amount of
virus applied, with most of the infected cells located in the ven-
tricular and subventricular zones (VZ and SVZ), where NPCs
are located (Figures 1B and 1C). There were far fewer infected
cells in the midbrain or the cortical plate (CP), where post-mitotic
neurons are located during the infection window. Together with
the random diffusion of virus injected in the LV, this may account
for the variability of the infection pattern in Figure 1B.
Importantly, brains of smaller sizes compared to those of their
mock infected littermates were detected 5 days after infection
(Figure 1D). In addition, we noticed enlarged LVs and a thinner
CP and VZ/SVZ in the infected brains (Figures 1D and 2A). We
also stained the cortex with different cortical layer markers at
E18.5, including Tbr1 and Foxp2, and found that ZIKV infection
led to a thinning of cortical layers without apparent disturbance
of the lamination (Figures 2A–2C). We were also interested
in examining postnatal stages to confirm that viral infection of
SZ01 leads to microcephalic brains. Unfortunately, we tried
twice to infect and mock-infect littermates at E13.5 and found
that the infected newborn pups were eaten by their lactating
mothers within 2 days. This prevents the analysis of postnatal
stages for the time being, and we therefore focused on analyzing
infected brains at embryonic stages in the present study.

ZIKV Infects NPCs and Causes Cell
Death
Increased cell death has been shown
as one of the causes of microcephaly (Xu
et al., 2014). In order to determine whether
cell death contributes to the smaller size
ofinfectedbrains,we infectedor mock-in-
fected littermate brains at E13.5 and in-
spected them 3 or 5 days later. Compared to mock-infected
brains, many cells in the intermediate zone (IZ) and CP were
strongly positive for the activated form of caspase3 3 days after
infection, although a weak signal was also detected in the SVZ
(Figure S2A). Interestingly, there were many more strongly posi-
tive cells 5 days after infection and these were mostly located in
the CP (Figures 2D). This suggests that ZIKV infection induces
cell death mainly in immature neurons and mature neurons.
To identify which cell types were infected by ZIKV in the em-
bryonic brain, we examined E16.5 brain slices with cell markers
including Sox2 and Pax6, markers for apical progenitor cells and
radial glial cells; Tbr2, a marker for intermediate or basal progen-
itor cells (IPCs/BPCs); and Tuj1 and Dcx, markers for immature
neurons. As shown in Figures 3A and S3, infected cells were pos-
itive for Sox2, Pax6, or Tbr2, suggesting that ZIKV mainly infects
NPCs or IPCs/BPCs. Some infected cells were also positive for
Tuj1 or Dcx in the IZ and CP, which had possibly differentiated
from NPCs infected earlier (Figures 3B and S3C). Together,
these results establish that NPCs in the developing brain are
the main direct targets of ZIKV. However, almost all cells in the
brain including those in the CP were also positive for ZIKV
5 days after infection (Figures 2B–2D and S2B), indicating that
post-mitotic neurons can also be the target of ZIKV.
ZIKV Infection Leads to Dysregulation of NPC Cell Cycle
and Differentiation
We went on to determine whether ZIKV infection would affect
NPC proliferation and differentiation. It was interesting to notice
that there were significantly fewer mitotic cells in the VZ of
the E16.5 brains infected at E13.5 (Figure S3E). This was

 accompanied by more centrosomes at the ventricular surface
that were facing away from the nuclei. We therefore examined
phosphorylated H3, a marker for cells in the M phase. As shown
in Figure 3C, there were substantially fewer cells positive for
phosphorylated H3 in the VZ/SVZ of ZIKV-infected brains, indi-
cating a decreased number of NPCs in M phase. In addition,
more Pax6+ cells were found in infected brains 1 hr after BrdU
injection, while significantly fewer Tbr2+ cells were found 24 hr
after BrdU injection (Figures 3D and S3D). Intriguingly, 24 hr after
BrdU labeling, the infected cells positive for Ki67 or BrdU were
more concentrated in the VZ (Figure 3E). Furthermore, most of
the infected cells in the VZ showed the morphology of S, G1,
or G2 phase cells with the somas away from the ventricular sur-
face but tethered there through elongated end-feet (Figure 1C).
Finally, the percentage of cells in the infected brains positive
for both Ki67 and BrdU was increased after 24 hr of BrdU label-
ing (Figure 3E), suggesting that ZIKV infection inhibits NPC cell-
cycle exit and differentiation. The above results indicate that
ZIKV infection suppresses NPC proliferation, the transition of
Pax6+ radial glial cells to Tbr2+ IPCs, and NPC differentiation.
They are in agreement with the finding that ZIKV infection leads
to S phase arrest of hiPSCs (Tang et al., 2016) and that prolifer-
ating NPCs exhibit a much longer S phase than those committed
to neuronal differentiation (Arai et al., 2011).
ZIKV Infection Induces Immune Response and
Deregulation of Microcephaly-Associated Genes
To investigate the global impact of ZIKV infection on the whole
developing brain at the molecular level, we carried out global tran-
scriptome analyses (RNA-seq). Genome-wide analyses identified
a large number of differentially expressed genes at 3 days after
viral infection (Table S2). Gene Ontology analyses revealed a

enrichment
of
upregulated
genes in immune-response-related and
apoptosis pathways (Figure 4A and Table
S2). Very notable were the genes related
to cytokine production and the response
to cytokines, suggesting that cytokines
play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ZIKV infection (Figure 4A
and Table S2). Many antiviral response genes were reported to be
induced by ZIKV in human skin fibroblasts (Hamel et al., 2015).
Although there is a much longer list of related genes in our dataset,
we have confirmed all of those reported by Hamel et al., including
Tlr3, Ddx58, Ifih1, Oas2, Isg15, and Mx1, in addition to Ccl5,
Cxcl10, and Ifnb1, which were not detected in controls but were
expressed in infected brains (Figure 4C and Table S2). Interest-
ingly, many candidate flavivirus entry receptors were also
induced, most notably AXL, which has been predicted as a ZIKV
receptor (Nowakowski et al., 2016) (Figure 4D and Table S2). In
contrast, many genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation,
migration,andorgandevelopmentweredownregulated(Figure4B
and Table S2). It was of interest that most of the microcephaly-
associated genes were significantly downregulated (Figure S4)
in the dataset of ZIKV-infected hNPCs (Tang et al., 2016). We
confirmed the significant downregulation of seven of them,
including ASPM, CASC5, CENPF, MCPH1, RBBP8, STIL, and
TBR2,inourdatasetorbyreal-timePCRofthevirus-injectedsides
of the brains (Figure 4E). The downregulation of microcephaly-
associated genes that we found largely overlaps with that found
in the hNPC dataset, although the downregulation of CEP152
and WDR62 was not very significant. Therefore, these global tran-
scriptome datasets not only support our cell biology findings but
also provide a useful resource for the exploration of the underlying
pathogenesis and for the potential treatment of ZIKV infection
when combined with a dataset from hiPSCs (Tang et al., 2016).
DISCUSSION
Our results demonstrate that ZIKV can directly infect different
lineages of NPCs and immature neurons in vivo in the beginning

 of infection and replicates in these cells with high efficiency. Due
to the dramatically higher level of ZIKV several days after infec-
tion, neurons are also targeted at E18.5, indicating that neurons
are infected at much lower efficiency than NPCs. Infection
of NPCs leads to attenuated NPC expansion through virally
induced apoptosis and cell-cycle dysregulation. Together with
ZIKV’s effects on NPC differentiation, these effects are likely to
account for microcephaly in human fetuses or newborn babies.
Our study also indicates that more attention should be focused
on NPCs and immature neurons regarding the roles of these cells
in ZIKV-associated neuropathology. It was unfortunate that our
infected pups did not survive for a long time after birth. It is
very likely that they were eaten by their lactating mothers

because they were very sick. Therefore,
in the future it will be desirable to lower
the titer of ZIKV infection to determine
whether the pups will survive longer,
because if they do, it will permit determi-
nation of the long-term consequences
of ZIKV infection. It will also be intriguing
to
investigate
whether
ZIKV
infects
adult neural stem cells and affects adult
neurogenesis.
In summary, our results show direct
effects of ZIKV on NPC development,
including
proliferation,
differentiation,
and cell death, which may link ZIKV with
the development of microcephaly. Our
study also provides insights into indirect
effect of ZIKV infection on induced im-
mune responses, including cytokine pro-
duction and the effects of these cytokines
on neural development. Moreover, the combination and compar-
ison of our global transcriptome datasets of infected brains with
that of hiPSCs (Tang et al., 2016) will provide valuable resources
for further investigation of the underlying cellular and molecular
mechanisms and management of ZIKV-related pathological
effects during neural development.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
ZIKV Preparation and Animal Infection
1 ml of ZIKV SZ01 (GenBank accession number: GEO: KU866423) virus stock
(6.5 3 105 PFU/ml) (Deng et al., 2016) or stock diluted 10-fold was injected into
one side of the cerebroventricular space/LV of the E13.5 ICR mouse brains and
inspected 3–5 days later or after birth. Diluted virus was used only in Figure 1A
124
Cell Stem Cell 19, 120–126, July 7, 2016
 while all others were undiluted. For each pregnant dam, around two-thirds of
littermates were injected with ZIKV while one-third were injected with culture
medium (mock) for proper controls. For BrdU labeling experiments, pregnant
dams were injected with 50 mg/kg (body weight) of BrdU in solution at
either 1 hr or 24 hr before scarification. All experimental procedures involved
were performed according to protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at Beijing Institute of Microbiology and
Epidemiology.
Immunohistochemistry and Antibodies
Forcryosections,tissueswerefixedin4%PFA,dehydratedin30%sucrose,and
frozen in TFM (tissue freezing medium). Sections (thickness: E16.5, 50 mm;
E18.5, 40 mm) were used for immunofluorescence staining as described previ-
ously (Xu et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014). The antibodies used for immunostain-
ing were Sox2 (Abcam, ab97959, 1:1000), Pax6 (Covance, PRB-278P, 1:1000),
Tbr2 (Millipore, ab15894, 1:1000), b-III Tubulin (Abcam, ab7751, 1:1000),
g-Tubulin (Abcam, ab11316, 1:1000), Phospho-Histone 3 (P-H3) (Abcam,
ab10543, 1:1000), Ki67 (Abcam, ab15580, 1:1000), BrdU (Abcam, ab6326,
1:500), Activated-caspase3 (CST, 9664s, 1:500), Dcx (CST, 4604s, 1:1000),
Tbr1 (Abcam, ab31940, 1:500), Foxp2 (Abcam, ab16046, 1:500), and ZIKV
serum from a patient (1:100). Control serum for ZIKV was from a healthy person
(1:100), and mouse serum immunized with recombinant ZIKV envelope (E) pro-
tein was from GenBank (GEO: JN860885) (1:500, used only in Figure S1B).
Nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). Sections stained for BrdU detection
were subject to10min1NHCloniceand30min2NHClat37�C prior toblocking.
Nissl Staining
Brian slices were stained with 0.1% toluidine blue for 20 min and dehydrated in
turn by 70%, 96%, and 99% ethanol (45 s, twice for each). Finally, slices were
hyalinized by Xylene for more than 30 min.
Confocal Imaging and Quantification
Slices were imaged on an LSM 700 (Carl Zeiss) confocal microscope, and the
images were analyzed with Imaris, ImageJ, and Photoshop as described
previously (Xu et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014). All data were analyzed using
Prism software (GraphPad) or Excel. Statistical evaluation was performed by
Student’s unpaired t test. Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
RNA-Seq Analyses
Whole E16.5 brains 3 days after ZIKV or mock infection (two for each group)
were used for global transcriptome analysis by Annoroad Co. Significantly
differentially expressed genes were identified when we compared Normalized
Reads Count between ZIKV and mock infection groups with p < 0.05 and
jLog2FoldChangej > 0.263. Significance of Gene Ontology term enrichment
was estimated with Fisher’s Exact Test (p value).
Real-Time PCR
For viral RNA copies: total RNA was extracted from whole embryo brains and
viral RNA copies were determined by real-time PCR (Johnson et al., 2005).
Primers and fluorogenic probes for ZIKV detection were shown in Table S1.
2 ml of RNA samples was mixed with each primer of a final concentration
of 0.2 mM to prepare the reaction mixtures in accordance with the One
Step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit instructions, and they were moved to a reverse
transcription reaction at 42�C for 5 min, followed by PCR amplification
using a 60�C annealing temperature for 40 cycles. The standard curve of
viral RNA copies was determined from 10-fold dilutions of ZIKV RNA
with known concentrations, and viral RNA copies in embryo brains were
calculated.
Determining expression of microcephaly-associated genes between viral
injection side of the brains and mock-infected control (E13.5–16.5) was per-
formed as described previously (Xu et al., 2014), and primers used are listed in
Table S1.
