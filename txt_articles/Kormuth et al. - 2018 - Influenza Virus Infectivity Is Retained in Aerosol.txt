Pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses can be transmitted through aerosols and droplets, in which viruses must remain stable and 
infectious across a wide range of environmental conditions. Using humidity-controlled chambers, we studied the impact of relative 
humidity on the stability of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus in suspended aerosols and stationary droplets. Contrary to the 
prevailing paradigm that humidity modulates the stability of respiratory viruses in aerosols, we found that viruses supplemented 
with material from the apical surface of differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells remained equally infectious for 1 hour at 
all relative humidities tested. This sustained infectivity was observed in both fine aerosols and stationary droplets. Our data suggest, 
for the first time, that influenza viruses remain highly stable and infectious in aerosols across a wide range of relative humidities. 
These results have significant implications for understanding the mechanisms of transmission of influenza and its seasonality.

Influenza viruses are highly successful pathogens that emerge 
every winter in temperate regions. Epidemiologically suc-
cessful influenza viruses must replicate efficiently in humans 
and transmit via the airborne route [1]. Coughing, talking, 
and exhaling can release aerosols and droplets of varying 
sizes containing respiratory fluid and viral particles [2–7]. 
The spread of influenza virus by either aerosol transmission 
(inhalation of infectious particles) or fomite transmission 
(self-inoculation from a contaminated surface) requires that 
influenza virus remain infectious in a variety of environmen-
tal conditions [8].
The risk of airborne disease transmission to a naive host is 
linked to a combination of environmental and biological factors, 
including ventilation in buildings, gravitational settling of respi-
ratory droplets out of the air and onto surfaces, and biological 
inactivation of virus [5, 9, 10]. The link between the environment 
and influenza virus transmission is evident in the seasonal cycles 
of influenza virus infections, particularly in temperate regions 
[11, 12], that coincide with seasonal variations in temperature 
and absolute humidity [13–16]. Relative humidity (RH) can affect 
airborne transmission of influenza virus, as shown in the guinea 
pig model with deficient transmission at mid-range and very high 
RHs [9]. A partial explanation for this observation may be bio-
logical inactivation of influenza virus in aerosols at mid-range 
RHs, as suggested by the results of studies performed primarily in 
the 1960s [17–22]. We and others have previously shown that the 
presence of exogenous proteins in the virus solution can alter the 
pattern of viral decay in large stationary droplets in response to 
RH [23] and can prolong the viability of viruses on surfaces [24, 
25]. However, these studies do not accurately represent the com-
position of droplets produced by the human respiratory system 
and fail to examine the impact of RH on the viability of circulat-
ing seasonal influenza virus in aerosols.
Human respiratory droplets contain a variety of proteins, 
including but not limited to mucins [26, 27], yet droplet compo-
sition is difficult to recapitulate in an experimental setting since 
the precise components and their concentrations are unknown. 
In some previous studies of influenza virus viability [17–23], 
proteins were present in the aerosolization medium, but they 
were not mucins. A source of mucus that may help recapitu-
late a biologically relevant system to explore virus viability in a 
controlled experimental setting is extracellular material (ECM) 
collected from the apical surface of human bronchial epithelial 
(HBE) cell cultures at an air-liquid interface.
In this work, we have studied the viability of 2009 pandemic 
influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) in suspended 
aerosols and stationary droplets over a wide range of RHs.

To mimic a physiologically relevant composition of the aerosols 
and droplets, we supplemented the suspension medium with 
HBE ECM. Aerosol experiments took place within a custom 
rotating drum, which is designed to minimize loss of aerosols 
due to gravitational settling (Figure 1), as first described by 
Goldberg et al [28]. Rotating drums have been widely used to 
study the viability of airborne bacteria and viruses under con-
trolled environmental conditions [17, 19], although not since 
1968 for influenza virus [29]. We hypothesized detection of 
RH-dependent decay of influenza virus in aerosols and were 
surprised to find sustained infectivity of influenza virus at all 
RHs. To determine whether this observation might extend to 
other viruses, we also investigated the survival of aerosolized 
φ6, a bacteriophage commonly used for studying pathogenic 
enveloped viruses in the environment [30, 31], with and with-
out the HBE ECM. Our studies suggest that HBE ECM protects 
influenza virus and φ6 from RH-dependent decay.
METHODS
Cells and Viruses
Primary HBE cells were differentiated from human lung tissue 
by following an institutional review board–approved protocol 
and were maintained at an air-liquid interface [32]. HBE ECM 
was generated by pooling washes (150 µL of phosphate-buffered 
saline for 10 minutes at 37°C) of the apical surface of uninfected 
HBE cells from multiple patients. The protein concentration in 
undiluted HBE ECM was found to be 100–500 μg/mL (BCA 
assay; Thermo Fisher). Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) 
cells (ATCC CCL-34) were maintained in Eagle’s minimal 
essential medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine 
serum and L-glutamine.
Influenza A virus, A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 
Antiviral Resistance (AVR) Reference Virus M2: S31N NA: 
wild type (wt) (item number FR-458) was obtained through 
the Influenza Reagent Resource, Influenza Division, World 
Health Organization Collaborating Center for Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza, Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA). Virus stocks were 
prepared in MDCK cells until the onset of cytopathic effect, 
clarified by low-speed centrifugation, and concentrated by ultra-
centrifugation through a 30% sucrose cushion. Virus pellets 
were resuspended in a 1:10 ratio of HBE ECM to L-15 medium. 
Virus collected from HBE cells was prepared by infecting each 
Transwell with 103 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) 
of A(H1N1)pdm09 per milliliter as described elsewhere [33] 
and was collected in phosphate-buffered saline 48–72 hours

after infection. Influenza virus samples were titered on MDCK 
cells as previously described [34].
Bacteriophage φ6 was propagated with its host Pseudomonas 
syringae according to established methods [30]. Virus was har-
vested in tryptic soy broth (TSB) and stored at 4°C. φ6 stocks 
were concentrated, and the pellets were resuspended in a 
1:10 ratio of HBE ECM to L-15 medium in the same manner 
as influenza virus. Samples collected from experiments were 
titered using plaque assays. Briefly, 50 µL of virus was mixed 
with 200 µL of P. syringae and 4.75 mL of TSB (Sigma) soft agar 
(0.75% w/v). The mixture was poured over a TSB plate and 
incubated at 25°C for 24 hours prior to determination of viral 
titer.
Rotating Drum Experiment for Aerosols
A 27-L aluminum drum, modified from previous studies to fit 
inside a biosafety cabinet [28], was built to investigate the stabil-
ity of aerosolized viruses at various RHs. Three inlet ports intro-
duced dry air, aerosols, and saturated air generated by a Collison 
nebulizer (MRE-3; BGI) and, during sampling, make-up air 
(Figure 1). House air passed through a high-efficiency particu-
late air filter (catalog number 12144; Pall) and hydrocarbon trap 
(BHT-4; Agilent) to provide purified air to the nebulizer and 
dry air line. Three other ports were dedicated to an RH probe 
(catalog number HC2-C04; Rotronic), collection of samples, 
and exhaust flow passing through a high-efficiency particulate 
air filter to prevent the release of viruses. The drum rotated at 
a speed of 2.5 rpm, optimized to minimize aerosol losses. All 
influenza virus aerosolization experiments were done inside a 
biosafety cabinet.
Seven RHs—23%, 33%, 43%, 55%, 75%, 85%, and 98%—
were investigated; they were selected to span environmentally 
relevant conditions and correspond to levels readily achieva-
ble in the droplet experiments described below. The 3 lowest 
conditions (23%, 33%, and 43% RHs) are representative of dry 
climates or heated indoor environments during winter. Two 
moderate conditions (55% and 75% RHs) are typical of indoor 
environments during warmer seasons. The 2 highest RHs (85% 
and 98%) occur during rainy periods everywhere and in tropi-
cal regions. The RH in the drum was controlled by adjusting the 
flow rate of dry air (which varied from 0 to 10 L/minute, depend-
ing on the targeted RH), and the targeted RH was maintained 
within ±3%. Temperature and RH were recorded prior to aero-
solization and after collection of the aged sample. Temperature 
was maintained at 25°C ± 1°C throughout all experiments. 
Representative RH data are provided in Supplementary Table 1.
Aerosolization experiments were conducted with influenza 
virus in a 1:10 ratio of HBE ECM to L-15 medium, with φ6 in 
a 1:10 ratio of HBE ECM to L-15 medium, and with φ6 in TSB. 
For each experiment, the corresponding virus-free medium was 
nebulized to condition the drum to the desired RH. The aerosol 
flow rate was maintained at 3.9 L/minute at all RHs except 23% 
because nearly all inflow was distributed to dry air to achieve 
the desired RH. During conditioning, air at the targeted RH was 
collected into a separate polyethylene bag (AtmosBag; Sigma) 
to use as make-up air during sample collection, to maintain a 
constant RH. After conditioning, virus was aerosolized at the 
same flow rate for 20 minutes to fill the drum. While aerosol-
ization proceeded, samples were collected onto 25-mm gelatin 
filters (catalog number 225−9551; SKC) installed in stainless 
steel holders (catalog number 304500; Advantec), at a flow rate 
of 2 L/minute for 15 minutes. These represented “unaged” sam-
ples. The drum was then sealed, and viral aerosols were aged 
for 1 hour, which was chosen to represent typical air-exchange 
rates in residences and some office buildings [35–39]. One 
hour is longer than prescribed by ASHRAE (formerly known 
as the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-
Conditioning Engineers). Aged aerosol samples were collected 
in the same way as unaged samples, and the gelatin filters were 
dissolved in 3 mL of warm medium and stored at −80°C prior 
to virus titration.
Correction for Physical Loss of Aerosols
A mass balance equation was used to correct for loss of aerosols 
via gravitational settling and dilution during aging, assuming 
first-order decay for both processes. Instantaneous measure-
ment of infectious virus titer was not possible, so this correction 
assumed that the measured virus titers represent time averages 
over the 15-minute sampling period. The particle physical loss 
coefficient (kp; units are minutes−1) and dilution coefficient 
(kd; units are minutes−1) were determined as described previ-
ously [40]. The equations for this correction are shown in the 
Supplementary Materials.
RH Chamber Experiment for Stationary Droplets
Stationary droplets were incubated in chambers with RH con-
trolled using saturated salt solutions (Supplementary Figure 3A 
and 3B) [23]. Chambers were maintained within a biosafety 
cabinet at approximately 22°C. RH and temperature data were 
collected for each experiment, using a HOBO UX100-011 
data logger (Onset; representative data are in Supplementary 
Figure 3C). After incubation for 1 hour to achieve the desired 
RH, 10 stationary 1-µL virus droplets were incubated for 1 or 2 
hours at each RH and then collected in 500 µL of L-15 medium. 
A total of 10 µL of enclosed virus samples were incubated out-
side the chamber during the experiment. Data are presented as 
log decay [23]. All data are available on request.
RESULTS
Aerosolized Influenza Virus Remains Infectious at All RHs
To study the impact of RH on the viability of airborne influenza 
virus, we aerosolized A(H1N1)pdm09 into a custom rotating 
drum (Figure 1), aged the aerosols for 1 hour, and then collected 
aerosols for analysis of infectivity by a TCID50 assay on MDCK

cells. The bulk virus solution was prepared in traditional tissue 
culture cells and supplemented with HBE ECM (Figure 2A) 
to simulate respiratory secretions that would be expelled from 
an infected person. We observed a <0.5-log reduction in the 
amount of infectious A(H1N1)pdm09 in the aged aerosols in 
the presence of HBE ECM at each RH tested, which is within 
the error of our assay (Figure 2B). There was no loss in virus via-
bility in the bulk virus solution during the aerosolization pro-
cess, which includes recirculation of larger aerosols that were 
trapped by the nebulizer, because the virus titer before and after 
each experiment was unchanged (Supplementary Figure 1).
Addition of Respiratory Extracellular Material Protects φ6 Viruses From 
Decay at All RHs
We found A(H1N1)pdm09 to be remarkably resistant to 
RH-induced decay at all RHs in our rotating drum. To fur-
ther explore this finding, we conducted additional studies 
with an enveloped virus, bacteriophage φ6, in the presence 
and absence of HBE ECM. We aerosolized φ6 in traditional 
laboratory growth medium into the rotating drum and found 
that φ6 decayed in aerosols in an RH-dependent manner after 
1 hour (Figure 3A). In contrast, φ6 in medium supplemented 
with HBE ECM showed little to no decay at all RHs tested, as 
with A(H1N1)pdm09 (Figure 3B). Taken together with the 
A(H1N1)pdm09 data, we provide strong evidence that HBE 
ECM can protect enveloped viruses from RH-dependent decay 
in aerosols for at least 1 hour.
Adjustment for Physical Loss of Aerosols in a Rotating Drum
The rotating drum reduced but did not eliminate physical losses 
of aerosols due to gravitational settling. Furthermore, the sam-
ple of aged aerosols collected at the end of the 1 hour aging 
period was subject to dilution by RH-conditioned make-up air.

 Humidity and Influenza Virus Infectivity in Aerosols • JID 2018:218 (1 September) • 743
Therefore, a mass balance equation specific to each aerosoliza-
tion medium was used to account for these processes, assum-
ing first-order decay for both gravitational settling and dilution 
(Supplementary Figure 2). As expected, physical loss of aerosols 
due to settling was greater at higher RHs because they evapo-
rated less and were larger. Application of this equation to the data 
allows measurement of the change in viral infectivity unbiased 
by physical loss of aerosols within the drum. Corrected log10 
decay values confirmed the lack of decay of A(H1N1)pdm09 
(Figure 4A) and φ6 (Figure 4B) in the presence of HBE ECM. 
φ6 experienced up to a 2 log10 decay at 75% and 85% RH with-
out HBE ECM (TSB in Figure 4B), confirming our observation 
that it protects aerosolized viruses from RH-dependent decay.
Influenza Virus in Stationary Droplets Remains Infectious at All RHs
To test whether HBE ECM also protected influenza virus from 
decay in stationary droplets, we performed a series of studies 
with A(H1N1)pdm09 in stationary, 1-µL droplets exposed to 
the same RH conditions used in the rotating drum. RH was 
maintained using saturated aqueous salt solutions within an 
enclosed chamber (Supplementary Figure 3A) and, along with 
temperature, was continuously monitored during each exper-
iment, to ensure stability of the specified RH (Supplementary 
Figure 3 B and 3C). Consistent with our analysis of φ6 and 
A(H1N1)pdm09 viability in aerosols, we observed that 
A(H1N1)pdm09 experienced very little decay in infectivity in 
stationary droplets containing HBE ECM at each RH tested 
(Figure 5A). In contrast, there was an RH-dependent decay of 
virus infectivity in droplets lacking exogenous HBE ECM, with 
peak loss at 55% RH. Decay in virus infectious titer exceeded 1 
log10 across all RHs, and the concentration decayed over 2 log10 
at 55% RH. Further, we found this protective effect at 55% RH 
to be dependent on the concentration of exogenous ECM. We 
supplemented A(H1N1)pdm09 with 1:5, 1:10, 1:50, and 1:100 
dilutions of HBE ECM, finding that the 1:50 and 1:100 samples 
decayed similarly to control virus without exogenous HBE 
ECM after 1 hour at 55% RH (Figure 5B). Similar droplet exper-
iments that compared the viability of virus collected from either 
infected transformed tissue culture or primary differentiated 
HBE cells also indicated a lack of RH-dependent decay in the 
HBE-propagated viruses (Supplementary Figure 4). This result 
indicates that the protection observed with HBE ECM collected 
from uninfected cells behaves similarly to ECM from infected 
cells that would be present in expelled aerosols in nature.
Influenza Virus Viability in Stationary Droplets Is Not Dependent on Virus 
Concentration
The φ6 and A(H1N1)pdm09 bulk virus solutions used for our 
rotating drum experiments had titers ranging from 108 to 109 
plaque-forming units/mL or TCID50/mL. Individuals infected 
with A(H1N1)pdm09 shed approximately 105 RNA copies/mL, 
as determined by quantitation of virus from nasopharyngeal 
specimens [41, 42]. To assess whether the sustained infectivity 
of influenza virus over a range of RHs was dependent on virus 
concentration, we determined the viability of 10-fold serial 
dilutions of A(H1N1)pdm09 (109–104 TCID50/mL) in station-
ary droplets (Supplementary Figure 5). We observed very lit-
tle decay of infectivity for all virus concentrations and all RHs 
tested.
DISCUSSION
Here we provide new insights into the interplay of humidity 
and respiratory virus viability in expelled aerosols and drop-
lets that has long been proposed to influence influenza virus 
transmission. We have previously demonstrated that release of 
submicron aerosols containing influenza virus correlated with 
efficient transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 in the ferret model 
[43]. In both humans and animal models, aerosol transmission 
of human influenza virus has been suggested to be equally or 
more efficient than fomite transmission [44–46].

RH has previously been shown to impact the viability of 
influenza virus in aerosols and stationary droplets [5, 17–22]. 
Contrary to prevailing wisdom, we found that aerosolized 
influenza virus lost little infectivity over a wide range of RHs, 
indicating that virus decay is not a barrier to efficient aerosol 
transmission of influenza virus. The infectivity of A(H1N1)
pdm09 was sustained in aerosols for up to 1 hour at all 7 RHs 
tested (Figures 2B and 4A). Based on these observations, we 
postulated that the lack of RH-dependent decay in aerosols 
results from protection conferred by supplementation of the 
viruses with HBE ECM. We confirmed this idea by evaluating 
bacteriophage φ6 in the absence and presence of HBE ECM 
(Figures 3 and 4B). Complementary studies of influenza virus in 
stationary droplets, both with exogenous HBE ECM and virus 
collected from infected HBE cells (Figure 5 and Supplementary 
Figure 4), similarly recapitulated the protective effect of HBE 
ECM against RH-dependent decay of viral infectivity.
The protective effect of HBE ECM was concentration depen-
dent (Figure 5B), raising the question of how well the media 
composition represented that of actual aerosols and droplets 
expelled by an infected host. The total protein concentration 
in the diluted aerosolization media fell at the lower end of the 
range reported in different types of respiratory fluid [47]; the 
exact origin of virus-laden aerosols within the respiratory sys-
tem and their chemical composition are not known. Although 
protein is an obvious candidate, it is possible that something 
other than protein in HBE ECM protects the virus from decay. 
Even though the concentration of virus in our experimental 
aerosols and droplets may have been higher than found in real 
ones, studies using a series of serially diluted A(H1N1)pdm09 
samples did not indicate a concentration-dependent response 
to RH, suggesting that viability of respiratory viruses in expelled 
droplets with much lower viral load is also maintained.
Our observations have substantial implications for under-
standing transmission of epidemiologically successful seasonal 
and pandemic influenza virus and other respiratory pathogens, 
and they reaffirm the importance of aerosolized respiratory 
droplets as vehicles for transmission. Studies in the guinea pig 
model have shown that airborne influenza virus transmission is 
deficient at 50% RH, perhaps due to biological inactivation of 
viruses in aerosols [9]. However, transmission of influenza virus 
in ferrets is routinely studied at RHs close to 50%, resulting in 
100% transmission efficiency of the A(H1N1)pdm09 [43, 48]. 
 
Our data indicate that exhaled viruses likely have not been 
inactivated at this RH, although whether guinea pig respira-
tory secretions offer protection to viruses similar that offered 
by HBE ECM is unknown. We have also shown that aerosol 
gravitational settling within our rotating drum increases as RH 
increases (Supplementary Figure 2), which is consistent with a 
reanalysis of the guinea pig study by Lowen et al that concluded 
that RH effects on aerosol size and transport can explain the 
results without invoking airborne virus viability [49]. At higher 
RHs, much less evaporation and shrinkage of aerosolized respi-
ratory droplets occurs, resulting in more of them settling out of 
the air and contaminating fomites [5]. Therefore, RH-dependent 
biological inactivation of influenza virus in aerosols and drop-
lets may not significantly affect the efficiency of airborne trans-
mission, suggesting a more substantial role for physical factors 
that act directly on the droplet vehicle.
Our novel use of HBE ECM to recapitulate physiologically 
relevant expelled aerosols and droplets has revealed that the 
classical paradigm regarding the decay of influenza virus at 
mid-range RHs may not accurately represent the processes that 
occur in nature. These data support the notion that influenza 
virus may have evolved to exploit host protective barriers to 
support efficient airborne transmission via creation of a stable 
microenvironment for the viruses released into the air. While

Figure 5. Exogenous primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell extracellular 
material (ECM) protects influenza virus from decay in stationary droplets. The via-
bility of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) was tested in sta-
tionary droplets at a range of different relative humidities (RHs) in a controlled RH 
chamber. Virus samples were compared with (circles) and without (squares) exog-
enous HBE ECM. A, RH-dependent decay of A(H1N1)pdm09 with (red) and without 
(black) exogenous HBE ECM after 1 hour. Data represent mean values ± standard 
deviations from 3 biological replicates. B, Protection from decay of A(H1N1)pdm09 
in droplets is dependent on the concentration of HBE ECM. Virus was prepared with 
(shaded circles) or without (open circles) HBE ECM dilutions in L-15 tissue culture 
medium. Droplets were incubated at 55% RH for 1 hour. Individual data points are 
shown, with error bars indicating standard deviations, and are representative of at 
least 2 biological replicates. TCID50, 50% tissue culture infective dose.

the ECM of the respiratory tract may change during influ-
enza virus infection, our observation that viruses propagated 
in HBE cells were also protected from RH-mediated decay 
(Supplementary Figure 4) suggests that uninfected HBE ECM 
acts as a reasonable surrogate to study this effect.
Our findings raise a host of questions for future investigation. 
Studies are required to identify the contribution of other factors, 
including temperature and virus strain background, that may 
also affect viability of influenza virus in aerosols and contribute 
to the seasonal emergence of influenza virus. Characterization 
of the composition of respiratory droplets emitted by infected 
hosts will identify the factors that confer protection of influ-
enza virus from environmental decay. Specifically, investigation 
into the structure and composition of respiratory secretions 
is needed. Rheological characterization of viscoelasticity and 
other physical properties of mucus has enhanced understanding 
of disease pathology at mucosal surfaces [50]. Similar studies of 
the HBE mucosal matrix will identify host factors affecting the 
stability of influenza virus released from the respiratory tract. 
Further investigation of the kinetics of virus decay in aerosols 
and droplets is also needed. Prior studies have shown that decay 
is most rapid within the first approximately 15 minutes after 
aerosolization [17, 20, 21]. The way we conducted our exper-
iments in the rotating drum, our “unaged” aerosols spanned a 
range of ages, from near zero to several minutes, during which 
some decay, possibly RH dependent, might have occurred.
The results of our studies have important implications for the 
control of airborne influenza virus transmission. Based on our 
observations, we recommend a combination of increased air 
exchange rates coupled with filtration or UV irradiation of recir-
culated air, as well as regular disinfection of high-touch surfaces 
to minimize transmission. Use of personal protective equipment 
that reduces inhalation exposure to infectious aerosols, such as 
N95 respirators, may be recommended to healthcare profession-
als in high-risk situations. The results of this study have substantial 
implications for understanding transmission of epidemiologi-
cally successful seasonal and pandemic influenza virus and other 
respiratory pathogens, and they reaffirm the importance of aero-
solized respiratory droplets as vehicles for transmission.
