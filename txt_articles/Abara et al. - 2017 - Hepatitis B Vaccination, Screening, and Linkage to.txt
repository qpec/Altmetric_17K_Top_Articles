Disease Control and Prevention
Winston E. Abara, MD, PhD; Amir Qaseem, MD, PhD, MHA; Sarah Schillie, MD, MPH, MBA; Brian J. McMahon, MD; and
Aaron M. Harris, MD, MPH*; for the High Value Care Task Force of the American College of Physicians and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention
Background: Vaccination, screening, and linkage to care can
reduce the burden of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.
However, recommendations vary among organizations, and
their implementation has been suboptimal. The American Col-
lege of Physicians'High Value Care Task Force and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention developed this article to
present best practice statements for hepatitis B vaccination,
screening, and linkage to care.
Methods: A narrative literature review of clinical guidelines, sys-
tematic reviews, randomized trials, and intervention studies on
hepatitis B vaccination, screening, and linkage to care published
between January 2005 and June 2017 was conducted.
Best Practice Advice 1: Clinicians should vaccinate against
hepatitis B virus (HBV) in all unvaccinated adults (including preg-
nant women) at risk for infection due to sexual, percutaneous, or
mucosal exposure; health care and public safety workers at risk
for blood exposure; adults with chronic liver disease, end-stage
renal disease (including hemodialysis patients), or HIV infection;
travelers to HBV-endemic regions; and adults seeking protection
from HBV infection.
Best Practice Advice 2: Clinicians should screen (hepatitis B
surface antigen, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, and anti-
body to hepatitis B surface antigen) for HBV in high-risk persons,
including persons born in countries with 2% or higher HBV prev-
alence, men who have sex with men, persons who inject drugs,
HIV-positive persons, household and sexual contacts of HBV-
infected persons, persons requiring immunosuppressive therapy,
persons with end-stage renal disease (including hemodialysis pa-
tients), blood and tissue donors, persons infected with hepatitis C
virus, persons with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (≥19
IU/L for women and ≥30 IU/L for men), incarcerated persons,
pregnant women, and infants born to HBV-infected mothers.
Best Practice Advice 3: Clinicians should provide or refer all
patients identified with HBV (HBsAg-positive) for posttest coun-
seling and hepatitis B–directed care.

n the United States, an estimated 847 000 persons
are living with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
(1), and approximately 14 000 deaths that are attribut-
able to it occur each year (2). About 2 of every 3 per-
sons with chronic HBV infection are unaware of their
infection, which contributes to ongoing transmission (3,
4). Approximately 70% of persons with chronic HBV in-
fection in the United States are foreign-born (2, 5), and
the prevalence among foreign-born persons is 3% to
5% (5) compared with 0.3% in the general population
(1). Most cases in foreign-born persons occur among
immigrants from Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands—
regions with intermediate (2% to 7% prevalence of hep-
atitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]) or high (>7% preva-
lence of HBsAg) endemicity (6). Other high-burden
populations include men who have sex with men
(MSM), injection drug users, incarcerated populations,
and sexual and household contacts of infected persons
(7).
Between 15% and 40% of persons with chronic
HBV infection develop cirrhosis, hepatocellular carci-
noma, or liver failure, and 25% die prematurely of these
complications (8–10). Complications result in increased
direct and indirect health care costs (4, 11) totaling ap-
proximately $1 billion (12). Vaccination and screening
are cost-effective interventions to reduce the burden of
chronic HBV infection, but their use remains low (7, 13).
Only 24.6% of U.S. adults have received a complete
hepatitis B vaccine series (13), and about 60% of HBV-

Summary of the American College of Physicians and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Best Practice
Advice on Hepatitis B Vaccination, Screening, and Linkage to Care for Adults With Chronic HBV Infection
Disease/Condition 
Chronic HBV infection
Target Audience 
All clinicians
Target Patient Population 
Adults who are at risk for or have HBV infection
Interventions Evaluated
Hepatitis B vaccination, hepatitis B screening tests (HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc), linkage to care, and treatment
Outcomes Evaluated
Vaccination coverage, HBV transmission, knowledge of HBV infection status, receipt of hepatitis B–directed care, complications
of chronic HBV infection (cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, death), and health care costs
Benefits
Decreases in risk for continuous transmission of HBV infection, HBV-associated morbidity and mortality, and health care costs
Increases in number of persons aware of their status, receiving hepatitis B–directed care, and receiving treatment and increases in
care and treatment of HBV-infected mothers in order to reduce risk for perinatal transmission
Harms
Vaccination: Rare but can include mild fever, soreness at the injection site, anaphylaxis (1 case per 1.1 million doses), and adverse
effects of treatment
Screening: Potential emotional trauma from a rare false-positive test result; feelings of shame and depression in some
HBV-infected persons
Linkage to care: None
Talking Points for Providers
HBV is a serious cause of morbidity and mortality associated with liver disease.
Vaccination of susceptible and unvaccinated adults is effective at preventing chronic HBV infection.
Screening can easily identify susceptible and unvaccinated adults.
Screening increases the number of persons who are aware that they have chronic HBV infection.
Effective treatment can reduce complications, reduce morbidity and mortality, and help meet the goals of the national elimination
strategy.
HBV screening and vaccination are cost-effective and cost-saving.
Best Practice Advice 
Best Practice Advice 1: Clinicians should vaccinate against chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) in all unvaccinated adults at risk
for infection, including:
   a. Adults at risk by sexual exposure (sex partners of hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]-positive persons, sexually active 
       persons who are not in a mutually monogamous relationship, persons seeking evaluation or treatment for a sexually 
       transmitted infection, and men who have sex with men).
   b. Adults at risk by percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood (adults who are recent or current users of injection drugs; 
       household contacts of HBsAg-positive persons; residents and staff of facilities for developmentally disabled persons; 
       incarcerated, health care, and public safety workers at risk for exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids).
   c. Adults with chronic liver disease, including but not limited to hepatitis C virus infection, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, 
       alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune hepatitis, and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase 
       (AST) level greater than twice the upper limit of normal.
   d. Adults with end-stage renal disease, including those receiving predialysis care, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and 
       home dialysis.
   e. Adults with HIV infection.
   f.  Pregnant women who are at risk for hepatitis B virus infection during pregnancy (e.g., having more than 1 sex partner
       during the previous 6 months, having been evaluated or treated for a sexually transmitted infection, recent or current
       injection drug use, or having an HBsAg-positive sex partner).
   g. International travelers to regions with high or intermediate levels of endemic hepatitis B virus infection.
   h. Any adult seeking protection from HBV infection.
Best Practice Advice 2: Clinicians should screen (hepatitis B surface antigen, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, and 
antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen) for HBV in high-risk persons, including persons born in countries with 2% or higher 
HBV prevalence, men who have sex with men, persons who inject drugs, HIV-positive persons, household and sexual 
contacts of HBV-infected persons, persons requiring immunosuppressive therapy, persons with end-stage renal disease 
(including hemodialysis patients), blood and tissue donors, persons infected with hepatitis C virus persons with elevated
alanine aminotransferase levels (≥19 IU/L for women and ≥30 IU/L for men), incarcerated persons, pregnant women, and
infants born to HBV-infected mothers.
Best Practice Advice 3: Clinicians should provide or refer all patients identified with HBV (HBsAg-positive) for posttest
counseling and hepatitis B–directed care.

 infected persons are unaware of their infection (4).
Screening among at-risk groups can mitigate the bur-
den of chronic HBV infection by promptly identifying
infected persons and linking them to care, but its im-
plementation is suboptimal (7). Approximately 10% to
15% of eligible persons in the United States receive
treatment (4). Linking HBV-infected patients to care fa-
cilitates timely treatment for eligible persons (14) and
periodic surveillance (every 6 to 12 months) for hepa-
tocellular carcinoma and monitoring of liver amino-
transferase and HBV DNA levels, which are important in
mitigating morbidity and mortality (8, 15).
Reducing the burden of chronic HBV infection by
increasing vaccination, screening at-risk adults, and
providing linkage to care is a public health priority (16,
17). Although clinical guidelines from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (7, 18), the U.S.
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) (19), the
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases
(AASLD) (8), and the Advisory Committee on Immuni-
zation Practices (ACIP) (20) have addressed these top-
ics, their recommendations vary and implementation
has been suboptimal (4, 7, 13). Most persons who are
at risk for, are susceptible to, or have HBV infection are
not screened, vaccinated, or linked to care (4, 7, 13).
Recent
studies
have
suggested
additional
at-risk
groups that should receive HBV screening, treatment,
or vaccination that were not in previously published
clinical guidelines (21–27). This article by the American
College of Physicians (ACP) and the CDC presents the
best available evidence on hepatitis B vaccination,
screening, and linkage to care. Using the ACP high-
value care framework, we highlight consensus across
guidelines and integrate this with current evidence for
hepatitis B vaccination, screening, and linkage to care
from the research literature to develop best practice
advice statements. This evidence-based synthesis of
current clinical guidelines and research findings is in-
tended to amplify existing guidelines and promote
high-value clinical practice. The target audience for this
article includes all clinicians, and the target patient
population is adults who are at risk for or have HBV
infection.
METHODS
Literature Review
A narrative literature review of evidence on hepati-
tis B vaccination, screening, and linkage to care was
conducted.
We
searched
the
published
English-
language literature from January 2005 (when highly
potent hepatitis B drug treatment with low resistance
rates became available) through June 2017 using the
following
Medical

atitis B linkage to care, hepatitis B continuum of care,

cost-
effectiveness. We selected current clinical guideline
recommendations from the CDC, the USPSTF, the
AASLD, and the ACIP and included systematic reviews,
meta-analyses, and randomized and nonrandomized
intervention studies from the research literature. Se-
lected articles were further screened to include those
that focused on the most recent guidelines on vaccina-
tion, screening, and treatment for chronic HBV infec-
tion; barriers to screening and linkage to care; adverse
events associated with vaccination; and strategies to in-
crease screening, vaccination, and linkage to an HBV-
experienced provider among adults. Selected articles
were reviewed by 2 persons to ensure that they met the
selection criteria.
Consensus Process and Approval
This article was reviewed and approved by the
CDC and the ACP High Value Care Task Force, whose
members are physicians trained in internal medicine
and its subspecialties and include experts in evidence
synthesis who are familiar with the hepatitis literature.
The CDC and the task force developed the best prac-
tice statements (summarized in the Figure) on the basis
of the narrative review and approved them by consen-
sus. All disclosures of interest were declared at each
conference call. No individuals were recused from dis-
cussion or voting due to conflicts of interest.
VACCINATION
Vaccination is the most effective measure to pre-
vent HBV infection and its complications (18). The vac-
cine confers protection in more than 90% of healthy
adults younger than 40 years who receive the complete
vaccine series (28, 29), and immunity lasts at least 3
decades (30–32). Recommendations for hepatitis B vac-
cination were introduced in 1982 and have since
evolved into a comprehensive immunization strategy,
although challenges remain (18). The ACIP recom-
mends vaccination for all unvaccinated adults at risk for
HBV infection, including sexual partners and household
contacts of HBsAg-positive persons; sexually active per-
sons who are not in a mutually monogamous relation-
ship; persons seeking evaluation for a sexually transmit-
ted infection; MSM; recent or current users of injection
drugs; residents and staff at facilities for developmen-
tally challenged persons; incarcerated persons; health
care workers and public safety employees at risk for
exposure to blood or blood-contaminated body fluids;
adults aged 19 to 59 years with diabetes mellitus; per-
sons with end-stage renal disease, including those re-
ceiving predialysis care, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialy-
sis, or home dialysis; persons with chronic liver disease,
including but not limited to hepatitis C virus infection,
cirrhosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver
disease, autoimmune liver disease, or an alanine ami-
notransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase level
greater than twice the upper limit of normal; pregnant

 women who are at risk during pregnancy (>1 sex part-
ner during the previous 6 months, previous evaluation
or treatment for a sexually transmitted infection, recent
or current injection drug use, or HBsAg-positive sex
partner); HIV-infected persons; international travelers
to regions with high or intermediate levels of endemic
HBV infection; and any adult seeking protection from
HBV infection (18, 20, 33). Adults in the following
settings are also assumed to be at risk: sexually trans-
mitted disease treatment facilities, HIV testing and
treatment facilities, facilities providing drug abuse
treatment and preventive services, health care settings
targeting injection drug users and MSM, correctional
facilities, hemodialysis facilities and end-stage renal
disease programs, and institutions and nonresidential
day care facilities for developmentally disabled persons
(18).
Hepatitis B vaccine is usually given as a 3- or
4-dose series, but higher dosages may be required for
immunocompromised persons and those with end-
stage renal disease (18, 34, 35). These persons should
receive postvaccination testing, and those with subop-
timal response (antibody to HBsAg level <10 mIU/mL)
should be revaccinated (18, 34, 35).
Since the implementation of universal hepatitis B
vaccination among infants and the ACIP'
s recommen-
dations, there has been a significant decrease in the
rate of acute HBV infection in adults (9.6 per 100 000
persons in 1982 vs. 1.1 per 100 000 persons in 2015)
(18, 36) and the proportion of noninstitutionalized per-
sons who have ever been infected with HBV (5.5% dur-
ing 1988 to 1994 vs. 3.7% during 2007 to 2012) (1).
Because of the low vaccination coverage and the risk
for HBV transmission (13), increasing coverage among
unvaccinated adults is essential.
Best Practice Advice 1
Clinicians should vaccinate against chronic hepatitis
B virus (HBV) in all unvaccinated adults at risk for infec-
tion, including:
a. Adults at risk by sexual exposure (sex partners of
hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]-positive persons,
sexually active persons who are not in a mutually mo-
nogamous relationship, persons seeking evaluation or
treatment for a sexually transmitted infection, and men
who have sex with men).
b. Adults at risk by percutaneous or mucosal expo-
sure to blood (adults who are recent or current users of
injection drugs; household contacts of HBsAg-positive
persons; residents and staff of facilities for developmen-
tally disabled persons; incarcerated, health care, and
public safety workers at risk for exposure to blood or
blood-contaminated body fluids).
c. Adults with chronic liver disease, including but
not limited to hepatitis C virus infection, cirrhosis, fatty
liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, autoimmune hepa-
titis, and an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) level greater than twice the up-
per limit of normal.

those receiving predialysis care, hemodialysis, perito-

e. Adults with HIV infection.
f. Pregnant women who are at risk for hepatitis B
virus infection during pregnancy (e.g., having more than
1 sex partner during the previous 6 months, having
been evaluated or treated for a sexually transmitted in-
fection, recent or current injection drug use, or having
an HBsAg-positive sex partner).
g. International travelers to regions with high or in-
termediate levels of endemic hepatitis B virus infection.
h. Any adult seeking protection from HBV infection.
SCREENING
Current guidelines from the CDC (7), the USPSTF
(19), and the AASLD (8) recommend screening for spe-
cific populations and persons at increased risk for
chronic HBV infection. Table 1 summarizes these pop-
ulations and at-risk groups, the prevalence of HBV in-
fection among them, and screening recommendations.
Although recommendations for some groups vary, all 3
organizations recommend screening for persons born
in regions with intermediate-to-high prevalence of HBV
infection (Table 2) or with other known HBV-related
risks. In addition, prevaccination testing is recom-
mended for health care personnel at increased risk for
HBV infection and those who perform exposure-prone
procedures
(47).
Despite
these
recommendations,
screening in these groups is suboptimal (4, 11, 48, 49).
Table 3 shows HBV screening seromarkers (HBsAg, an-
tibody to HBsAg, and antibody to hepatitis B core anti-
gen), associated clinical states, and recommended
clinical management. Screening for HBV with HBsAg
testing is only recommended for pregnant women.
Persons receiving chemotherapy or immunosup-
pressive therapy should be screened for HBV because
of the risk for virus reactivation (21, 22, 26). Cases of
HBV reactivation have also been reported among pa-
tients receiving direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C
virus infection (23–25). Reactivation can result in hepa-
tocellular injury, fulminant hepatitis, liver failure, and
death (21–26). Clinicians should therefore screen all pa-
tients
receiving
chemotherapy,
immunosuppressive
therapy, or direct-acting antivirals.
Best Practice Advice 2
Clinicians should screen (hepatitis B surface anti-
gen, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, and antibody
to hepatitis B surface antigen) for HBV in high-risk per-
sons, including persons born in countries with 2% or
higher HBV prevalence, men who have sex with men,
persons who inject drugs, HIV-positive persons, house-
hold and sexual contacts of HBV-infected persons, per-
sons requiring immunosuppressive therapy, persons
with end-stage renal disease (including hemodialysis
patients), blood and tissue donors, persons infected
with hepatitis C virus, persons with elevated alanine
aminotransferase levels (≥19 IU/L for women and ≥30
IU/L for men), incarcerated persons, pregnant women,
and infants born to HBV-infected mothers.
LINKAGE TO CARE
Linkage to care is the process of referring patients
with chronic HBV infection to medical care and ensur-
ing that they receive directed care and treatment. Al-
though not all patients with chronic HBV infection re-
quire treatment, they all should be routinely evaluated
for hepatocellular carcinoma and treatment eligibility
through history and physical examination (50, 51). Pa-
tients who are linked to care can achieve significant
reductions in HBV-associated morbidity and mortality
(4, 11, 52, 53). However, most persons with chronic
HBV infection are not linked to care because they are
unaware of their infection (4) or are not referred de-
spite their diagnosis (54). Between 20% and 40% of
persons with chronic HBV infection require treatment;
however, all require monitoring of liver aminotransfer-
ase and HBV DNA levels (4, 8). Only 10% to 15% of
eligible persons receive antiviral therapy, demonstrat-
ing that many who could benefit from therapy do not
receive it (4). Linkage to care ensures that patients with
chronic HBV infection receive treatment when they be-
come eligible (elevated HBV DNA and liver aminotrans-
ferase levels), hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance,
behavioral risk reduction counseling, and vaccination
of susceptible sexual and household contacts (8, 18,
55).
Best Practice Advice 3
Clinicians should provide or refer all patients iden-
tified with HBV (HBsAg-positive) for posttest counseling
and hepatitis B–directed care.
HARMS OF VACCINATION, SCREENING, AND
LINKAGE TO CARE
Adverse effects from hepatitis B vaccination are
rare and mild; the most common are soreness at the
injection site (3% to 29%) and mild fever (1% to 6%)
(18). Anaphylaxis after vaccine administration has been
reported (56) but is rare, occurring once per 1.1 million
doses (57). The vaccine is contraindicated in persons

 with yeast allergies because yeast is a component of
the vaccine (58). Other harms of HBV screening and
linkage to care include fear of a positive test result,
stigma associated with HBV screening, feelings of
shame and depression in infected persons, and treat-
ment costs (16, 50).
COSTS OF VACCINATION, SCREENING, AND
LINKAGE TO CARE
Hepatitis B vaccination, screening, and linkage to
care are cost-effective (59–65). A study examined the
cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination compared with
no vaccination at a sexually transmitted infection clinic
and showed that the incremental cost-effectiveness
ratio (ICER) associated with routine vaccination was
$3500 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained
(66). Another analysis showed that screening of immi-
grants from HBV-endemic countries was cost-effective
(<$50 000 per QALY gained) (63).
A study comparing the cost-effectiveness of 2 HBV
screening
strategies
(screening
and
treatment,
or
screening and treatment of the index case patient and
vaccination of their close contacts) versus voluntary
screening among Asian or Pacific Island–born persons
in the United States found ICERs of $36 088 per QALY
gained for the first strategy and $39 903 per QALY
gained for the second strategy (59). Similarly, a cost-
effectiveness analysis of screening and treatment pro-
grams among Asian-born persons in the United States
found that screening and treatment were cost-effective
($46 489 per QALY gained) compared with no screening
(62). Another study compared the cost-effectiveness of
early- versus late-stage treatment over a 20-year pe-
riod. The study found an ICER of $19 505 per QALY
gained at 10 years that progressively decreased to
$5184 per QALY gained at 20 years among persons in
the early-stage treatment group (61). More recent mod-
els have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of screen-
ing and treatment or vaccination among groups with
ICERs less than $18 009 (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Unpublished data).
Hepatitis B vaccination and screening are also cost-
saving (7, 67). The price per vaccine dose ($24 to $62)
is substantially lower than the medical costs associated
with treatment of chronic HBV infection ($4000 to
$26 000),
decompensated
cirrhosis
($38 932
to
$153 110),
and
liver
transplantation
($343 241
to
$514 862) in the first year (60, 66–68). Furthermore, the
cost of screening in populations with an HBsAg preva-
lence of at least 2% is $750 to $3752 per case of
chronic HBV infection identified (7), significantly lower
than the annual medical costs.
DISCUSSION
What Is the Current State of Practice in the
United States?
There are gaps in vaccination and screening of per-
sons at risk for HBV infection. Current estimates show
that vaccination coverage (≥3 doses) is 24.6% among
adults aged 19 years or older (13) and is lower for black
persons (29.4%) and Hispanic persons (22.5%) than
white
persons
(34.9%)
(13).
Vaccination
coverage
among high-risk adults (MSM, injection drug users, and
persons at risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted
infections) is approximately 45% (69). In addition, cov-
erage is approximately 20.7% among foreign-born
adults in the United States compared with 25.5%
among U.S.-born adults, 25.3% among adults with
health insurance compared with 19.4% among those
without, 27.4% among adults with chronic liver condi-
tions, and 64.7% among health care personnel (13).
Prevalence of HBV screening is 11% to 67% among
foreign-born persons (48, 70), 28% to 52% among
MSM (49, 71), and approximately 28% among patients
receiving
chemotherapy
(72).
The
prevalence
of
guideline-adherent treatment and care among persons
with chronic HBV infection is low (4, 73, 74). Between
10% and 15% of eligible persons in the United States
receive treatment (4), 40% to 78% of patients with
chronic HBV infection receive recommended ALT mon-
itoring (54, 73, 75), and fewer than 40% are monitored
for HBV DNA (54, 73). Periodic assessment of ALT and
HBV DNA levels is important to evaluate disease pro-
gression and treatment eligibility.
Why Does Practice Not Follow the Evidence?
Many barriers contribute to low rates of hepatitis B
vaccination, screening, and linkage to care, especially
in foreign-born populations (76–80). Patient-level bar-
riers include lack of knowledge about chronic HBV in-

 fection, ignorance about the hepatitis B vaccine and its
health benefits, misinformation about vaccines, low lev-
els of English language proficiency, cultural and lan-
guage differences, lack of health insurance or access to
health care resources, and difficulty navigating the
health care system (76, 77). In some communities,
stigma associated with chronic HBV infection and fear
of a positive test result can present challenges to
screening and care (80, 81).
Clinician-level barriers include a lack of awareness
about clinical care guidelines and the risk for chronic
HBV infection in certain populations (76, 82, 83), result-
ing in missed opportunities for vaccination or screening
(79). Failure to screen for HBV infection or monitor liver
aminotransferase and HBV DNA levels and lack of
awareness of current treatment guidelines among phy-
sicians are some reasons that many treatment-eligible
patients are missed (4, 79). The hepatitis B vaccine may
also not be routinely stored in some clinical practices,
and this can present challenges to vaccination in the
clinical setting (84).
System-level barriers include limited hepatitis B
funding for programs for uninsured adults (74) and the
complexities surrounding payments for adult vaccines
by insurers (85). The complex health care system, which
may require referral to a liver specialist or an HBV-
experienced health care provider, may present a bar-
rier to persons who lack knowledge about the way the
health care system works (77).
Evidence-Based Strategies to Increase Hepatitis
B Vaccination, Screening, and Linkage to Care
Various strategies have been implemented in clini-
cal and community settings to increase hepatitis B vac-
cination, screening, and linkage to care (86–92). Part-
nerships between community-based programs and
local health centers with culturally and linguistically
competent patient navigators have proved effective in
increasing patient awareness of chronic HBV infection,
identifying infected adults, vaccinating susceptible per-
sons, linking infected persons to care and complemen-
tary resources, and overcoming cultural and linguistic
barriers to high-quality care (87–90, 92). The provisions
of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act can
increase vaccination coverage because they enable un-
insured susceptible adults to receive the vaccine with-
out cost sharing (93).
Clinicians should routinely assess HBV risk and vac-
cine needs, discuss health benefits of vaccination and
screening during clinical encounters, and offer vaccina-
tion and screening when indicated (84). When a patient
is infected with HBV, household and sexual contacts
should be screened, susceptible contacts should be
vaccinated, and infected contacts should be linked to
care. Increasing clinicians'awareness of the importance
of HBV screening, monitoring liver aminotransferase
and HBV DNA levels, and adherence to treatment
guidelines can increase the number of eligible patients
receiving treatment (4, 79). Clinical practices that do
not stock the hepatitis B vaccine can coordinate with
local health departments or large practices that stock
the vaccine to refer susceptible patients and ensure
they are vaccinated (94).
The Community Preventive Services Task Force has
recommended clinician-based or health care system–
based interventions, including electronic medical re-
cord (EMR) prompts, provider education, vaccine rec-
ommendation
by
a
provider,
standing
orders
or
protocols for HBV screening and vaccination, and pa-
tient reminders and recall systems when vaccines are
due (91). In the Indian Health Service, EMR prompts

Monitor patients with chronic HBV infection periodically to determine
disease progression and initiate treatment when indicated.
Refer to a liver specialist or hepatitis B–experienced health care provider
when patients with chronic HBV infection become eligible for treatment.
Clinical practices that do not stock the hepatitis B vaccine can refer
susceptible patients to the local health department or to larger
clinical practices that do.
System
A complex health care system that may require referral to a liver
specialist can present challenges to persons who lack
knowledge about how the health care system works.
Use EMR prompts and reminders, standing orders, and patient reminder
systems to improve hepatitis B vaccination and screening.
Use culturally and linguistically competent peer navigators in health care
settings to increase the number of patients who receive hepatitis B–
directed care and to facilitate continuity of care.

 and standing orders resulted in substantially higher
vaccination coverage than national estimates (95). A
randomized study also showed that health care provid-
ers who received EMR prompts ordered significantly
more screening tests than those who did not (40.9% vs.
1.1% [P < 0.001]) (86).
Including hepatitis B vaccination as part of routine
preventive services to all unvaccinated adults in set-
tings with a high proportion of adults with risk factors
for HBV infection (sexually transmitted infection clinics,
health care facilities that serve injection drug users and
MSM, and correctional health care facilities) is another
useful strategy (66). Software algorithms have been
successfully used to identify names associated with for-
eign birth so that EMR reminders can prompt the pro-
vider to assess HBV screening and vaccination status
(96, 97). This system can complement existing strate-
gies to identify patients at risk for chronic HBV infec-
tion. Culturally competent peer navigators can also mit-
igate system-level barriers that a complex health care
system may present to patients with chronic HBV infec-
tion (98, 99). Table 4 summarizes barriers at the patient,
clinician, and system level and strategies to overcome
them.
The current low hepatitis B vaccination coverage
among adults necessitates reconsideration of the exist-
ing risk-based vaccination strategy. Because the admin-
istration schedule typically includes 3 vaccine doses
over 6 months, the vaccine series needs to be started
and completed before exposure to the risk factor to
protect persons at greatest risk. Furthermore, the mul-
titude of factors constituting an indication for adult hep-
atitis B vaccination can create implementation chal-
lenges for vaccine providers. An adult vaccination
strategy that is not based on risk may be the next step
toward achieving elimination.
The burden and costs associated with chronic HBV
infection in the United States are high. Vaccination of
susceptible adults is important to prevent infection and
reduce ongoing transmission. Screening in high-risk
populations is the first step in the care cascade to iden-
tify persons with chronic HBV infection, and vaccination
and linkage to care are effective at reducing HBV-
associated morbidity and mortality. The best practice
advice statements in this article amplify and comple-
ment existing clinical guidelines by reiterating the im-
portance of hepatitis B vaccination and screening in at-
risk persons and linking infected persons to care.
Evidence-based strategies that effectively implement
this advice are critical to accomplishing the goals of the
national hepatitis B elimination plan.
