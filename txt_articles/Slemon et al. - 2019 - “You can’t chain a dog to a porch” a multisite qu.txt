Abstract
Background: Reducing harms of youth substance use is a global priority, with parents identified as a key target for
efforts to mitigate these harms. Much of the research informing parental responses to youth substance use are
grounded in abstinence and critiqued as ineffective and unresponsive to youth contexts. Parental provision of
substances, particularly alcohol, is a widely used approach, which some parents adopt in an attempt to minimize
substance use harms; however, research indicates that this practice may actually increase harms. There is an
absence of research exploring youth perspectives on parental approaches to substance use or the approaches
youth find helpful in minimizing substance use-related harms.
Methods: This paper draws on interviews with youth aged 13–18 (N = 89) conducted within the Researching
Adolescent Distress and Resilience (RADAR) study in three communities in British Columbia, Canada. An
ethnographic approach was used to explore youth perspectives on mental health and substance use within
intersecting family, social, and community contexts. This analysis drew on interview data relating to youth
perspectives on parental approaches to substance use. A multisite qualitative analysis (MSQA) was conducted to
examine themes within each research site and between all three sites to understand how youth perceive and
respond to parental approaches to substance use in different risk environment contexts.
Results: Within each site, youths’ experiences of and perspectives on substance use were shaped by their parents’
approaches, which were in turn situated within local social, geographic, and economic community contexts. Youth
descriptions of parental approaches varied by site, though across all sites, youth articulated that the most effective
approaches were those that resonated with the realities of their lives. Zero-tolerance approaches were identified as
unhelpful and unresponsive, while approaches that were aligned with harm reduction principles were viewed as
relevant and supportive.
Conclusions: Youth perspectives illustrate that parental approaches to substance use that are grounded in harm
reduction principles resonate with young people’s actual experiences and can support the minimization of harms
associated with substance use. Evidence-based guidance is needed that supports parents and young people in
adopting more contextually responsive harm reduction approaches to youth substance use.

 Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified
youth as a priority population at risk for problematic
substance use [1]. Global statistics demonstrate that sub-
stance use is concentrated in youth populations [2], and
the WHO [1] identifies youth as particularly vulnerable
to substance-related harms. In response to these con-
cerns, the United Nations’ General Assembly convened
a special session in 2016 focusing on the world’s drug
problem, which included a roundtable discussion focusing
on the “significant health challenge” of child and youth sub-
stance use [3]. Further, this roundtable highlighted concerns
affecting this population including substance use stigma,
limited accessibility of treatment, and inadequate youth
programming utilizing principles of harm reduction.
Recognizing the key role that parents play in influen-
cing the amount and frequency of youth substance use
as well as resultant harms, there is a strong focus in re-
search and practice to develop and deliver public health
campaigns and family-based interventions aimed at sup-
porting parents in minimizing the harms of youth sub-
stance use [4–6]. To date, much of this work has been
in the area of drug use prevention, which has largely
reflected abstinence-based, zero-tolerance ideologies [7].
However, such approaches have been critiqued as unrespon-
sive to many youth contexts, and ineffective in reducing
harms associated with substance use, in part because they
deter youth from seeking help in instances of unsafe use,
such as intoxicated driving or over-consumption [7–10].
Youth voices have been absent from the development and
implementation of these approaches, which has contributed
to the lack of resonance of parental strategies with the actual
context of youths’ lives, and has limited opportunities for
parental responses to youth substance use that effectively
minimize harm [10].
Against this backdrop, parents may remain unsure
about how to address substance use with their children.
Resultantly, the approaches adopted by parents related
to youth substance use are frequently ad hoc [11, 12]
and not grounded in evidence. One example of this that
has been extensively studied is parental provision of
substances, specifically alcohol [13]. Parental provision
of alcohol is a widely utilized practice, often with the
intention of promoting moderation and minimizing
substance-related harms [13]. However, data from recent
systematic reviews and cohort studies concludes that
this practice is associated with greater levels of adoles-
cent alcohol use, heavy drinking, and alcohol-related
problems [13, 14]. Yet, there are limited qualitative stud-
ies, and particularly limited studies involving youth
voices, which could provide the nuance needed to more
fully understand the aspects of this practice that contrib-
ute to identified harms. Further, what we do know from
qualitative work in this area is that there are contextual
factors, including family context and place of consump-
tion, that play important roles in producing identified
harms [15]. As the abstinence-based campaigns and par-
ental provision literature help to demonstrate, there is a
paucity of resources available for families hoping to
adopt evidence-based harm reduction strategies [16].
Harm reduction is conceptualized as an approach that
focuses on reducing the health, social, and economic
harms of substance use without requiring abstinence.
Further, a harm reduction approach aims to enhance
knowledge of lower-risk use and to address the risk and
protective factors associated with harms [17]. In this
way, harm reduction can provide a pragmatic strategy
for addressing youth substance use, and one that holds
relevance across the spectrum of use practices, from
abstinence through to problematic use and substance
use disorder. Exploration into the impacts of harm
reduction-oriented youth substance use programming is
beginning to emerge. In the school setting, harm reduc-
tion programs have been demonstrated to increase youth
engagement and adoption of content, and reduce re-
ported substance-related harms [18–20]. However, harm
reduction approaches have yet to be widely applied to
parent-targeted youth substance use intervention [16],
an opportunity that requires attention.
In developing parent-targeted, harm reduction inter-
ventions for youth substance use, it is key to do so while
centering youth perspectives—a key element of a harm
reduction
approach.
Youth
perspectives
on
adult
approaches to substance use are frequently absent from
research and policy, and are crucial to informing strat-
egies that resonate with youths’ lived realities [20]. This
manuscript contributes to addressing identified gaps by
illuminating youth perspectives on parental approaches
to substance use, drawn from the Researching Adoles-
cent Distress and Resilience (RADAR) study. The lan-
guage of parent is used throughout this paper, but is
intended inclusively to refer to parents, guardians, or
other adult caregivers. This qualitative study engaged
youth from three communities in British Columbia,
Canada to explore youth experiences of mental health,
substance use, and resilience. Drawing on analysis of
youth narratives on their parents’ attitudes and behaviors
toward youth substance use, this study was guided by
the research question: How do youth variously perceive
parental approaches to youth substance use, and what
types of parental approaches do youth find helpful in
minimizing substance use-related harms?
Methods
The findings from this analysis of youth perspectives on
parent approaches to substance use are drawn from the
RADAR study. Conducted in British Columbia (BC),
Canada between 2012 and 2014, this multisite qualitative

 study drew on ethnographic approaches to understand
how youth experiences of mental health and substance
use are shaped by their family, social, and community
contexts [21]. To this end, methods included individual
interviews with youth in three communities in BC, as
well as participant observation and field notes that facili-
tated examination of how the context of each research
site shaped participants’ experiences [22]. Field notes
contributed to the development of researchers’ under-
standing of the three research sites and to the initial
broad coding of interviews; however, interview data is
used for this analysis to center youth narratives. This pa-
per’s analysis draws on data from 83 interviews con-
ducted with youth ages 13–18 across the 3 research
sites, which are described in detail below. Following, we
outline the theoretical framework informing this study,
our data collection processes, and our analytic strategy.
Research sites
The three sites selected for this study represent urban,
suburban, and rural geographies and are identified by
pseudonyms: The City, The Valley, and The North. In
describing the unique features of each site, we aim to il-
lustrate how socio-geographical context shapes the re-
sults of our analysis and how youth and their parents
perceive and respond to substance use. The City is a
major metropolitan center, with an approximate popula-
tion of 631,000 within the municipality, and over 2.5
million in the larger regional area [23]. The municipal
district in which this study was conducted is wealthier
overall compared to The City and the rest of the prov-
ince, and residents have double the rate of higher educa-
tion than within The City overall [23, 24]. The City is
culturally and ethnically diverse, with 48% of people
identifying as first-generation immigrants. Fifty percent
of the total population is of Asian origins [24].
The Valley is a suburban city, with an approximate
population of 140,000 [24]. The immigrant population in
The Valley is smaller than in The City, with 27% of the
total population having immigrated to Canada. Though
statistics regarding race are not measured directly, The
Valley is predominantly white, with 61% of the popula-
tion being of European descent. However, there is also a
large South Asian community, which constitutes 31% of
the population [24]. Within this community, Punjabi is
predominantly the language spoken at home [24]. The
Valley is a highly religious municipality overall, with only
27% of the population claiming no religious affiliation,
compared to 49% in The City [23]. The two primary reli-
gions in The Valley are Christianity (50% of the total
population) and Sikhism (20%).
The North is a rural community that encompasses a
small town and the surrounding area, as well as First
Nations reserve land. The total population of the area is
approximately 4800 [25]. The town has experienced a
population decline of 5.5% since 2011; in comparison,
The City and The Valley have had population growth of
5.9% and 4.6% respectively during this time [24]. In
addition to the population of people living on reserve
land, 29% of the in-town population identifies as Indi-
genous compared to 6% nationally [24]. The North, as
with many communities in Canada, has been shaped by
a long history of colonialism, which has significantly
impacted social and health outcomes for Indigenous
populations. Indigenous people in Canada continue to
experience systemic violence, including through neoco-
lonial policies and inaccessible health systems, and stig-
matizing health and social encounters [26]. As a result
of this historical and ongoing trauma, many Indigenous
people experience social inequity and health disparities
[27]. In The North, many people have experienced inter-
generational trauma and live in poverty without equal
access to social and health resources.
Theoretical framework
Given our focus on better understanding youth perspec-
tives on parental approaches to substance use, with the
broader aim of supporting improved parental strategies
to reduce the harms of youth substance use, our analysis
is informed by Rhodes’ [28] risk environment framework
for harm reduction. This framework critiques individual-
istic understandings of harm reduction, which position
harms resulting from substance use as an issue of indi-
vidual acceptance or avoidance of risk, and frame harm
reduction as primarily a strategy for supporting individ-
ual behavioral change [28]. The risk environment frame-
work shifts the positioning of risk from the individual or
the notion of a ‘high risk’ social group to the multiple
intersecting environments that contextualize a person’s
life and experiences of substance use [29]. Rhodes [28]
conceptualizes environment as the intersection of social/
political, economic, geographical, and policy environ-
ments at both the micro-level of immediate and prox-
imal influence on a person’s experiences, and the
macro-level of broader conditions that contextualize
substance use including inequities in health and social
systems. The risk environment framework therefore con-
tributes to this analysis a more holistic and nuanced un-
derstanding of factors that may shape young people’s
perspectives on substance use and the multitude of en-
vironmental factors that influence individuals and fam-
ilies in navigating social narratives of youth substance
use. In its focus on context, this framework supports our
analysis of youth perspectives on substance use as situ-
ated both within family experiences and within broader
geographical, social, and political contexts that shape
families’ beliefs, attitudes, and values.

 Data collection
This study received ethics approval from the University
of British Columbia Behavioral Research Ethics Board,
and was granted permission by each research site’s
school district to collect data from youth participants.
Youth were recruited through posters advertising the
study within schools, and with assistance from school
and community staff. Specifically, school counseling staff
assisted the research team in recruiting youth with di-
verse experiences and perspectives. Youth provided their
own consent to participate, and did not require parental
permission. Individual interviews were conducted in pri-
vate spaces within each school, and covered a wide range
of topics related to distress and resilience, including
mental health, substance use, family and peer relation-
ships, and school support. Aligned with ethical guide-
lines, the research team was prepared with information
and guidelines for referral to support services if a par-
ticipant expressed distress or identified risks to safety
during the interview. Researchers conducting the inter-
views all had training in mental health, substance use,
and in working with youth, and were all women. Inter-
views were between 30 and 120 min in length. Partici-
pants
each
received
a

honorarium
in
appreciation of their time. Each participant was offered
the opportunity to review their transcript for accuracy.
Additionally, a community report was developed for
each research site, which provided the opportunity for
youth to provide feedback on findings and analysis prior
to publication.
Data analysis
All interviews were transcribed and accuracy checked.
Thematic analysis was conducted to code interviews
[30], resulting in 15 broad codes that reflected the par-
ticipants’ experiences of distress and resilience, as well
as their family, peer, and community contexts. For ex-
ample, codes included Friends and Social Connections,
Family, Identity, Violence, Aspirations and Goals, and
Coping Strategies. Codes were not mutually exclusive, to
capture the ways in which youth experiences intersected
with a wide range of contextual factors. This analysis
primarily draws from the Substance Use code. Following
broad coding, Substance Use data were analyzed through
a multisite qualitative analysis (MSQA) approach [31].
MSQA is an analytical approach developed through our
previous analyses of RADAR data, and aims to elucidate
themes both within and between diverse study sites. While
many approaches to multisite analysis aggregate findings
from all sites, or analyze each site’s data as separate case
studies, MSQA facilitates the development of overarching
experiences across sites, while preserving contextualized
understandings of experiences at each site.
Drawing on the MSQA within-between-within process
of analyzing data, we first analyzed youth experiences of
substance use separately for each study site to gain
in-depth understandings of the contextual features of
each site and to generate within-site themes. In the next
(between-site) stage, we identified the overarching theme
of parents/caregivers shaping youth perspectives on and
experiences of substance use. Using this theme as a lens
for the third and final (within-site) stage of the process,
we returned to each site separately to further develop
site-specific findings and to ensure contextual relevancy.
In each stage of the MSQA process, analysis was con-
ducted first as an independent process, followed by team
discussion of emergent findings to enhance nuance our
analyses. In this analysis, we aimed to elucidate how the
context of youth’s lives at each site shaped how their
families perceived and talked about substance use, and
how youth responded to their parents’ approaches. Thus,
the MSQA approach facilitated analysis of how young
people’s experiences of and perspectives on substance
use are shaped by intersecting micro- and macro-levels
of Rhodes’ risk environment framework, including family
perspectives and the broader community’s social, eco-
nomic, and geographic contexts.
Results
A total of 83 youth participated in individual interviews,
including 29 in The City, 27 in The Valley, and 27 in The
North. Table 1 provides an overview of the demographics
of youth participants from each site. Demographic data on
ethnicity were determined by participants’ self-report and/
or gleaned from participant interviews. The study sample
was diverse in the types of substances used, including al-
cohol, cannabis, mushrooms, and cocaine. Findings from
our MSQA are presented by site to illustrate the unique
ways in which youth in each setting articulated their par-
ents’ approaches to substance use. For each site, we first
describe the predominant parental approach to substance
use as described by the young people in this study, then
discuss how youth perceived and responded to this ap-
proach in managing their own use.
The City: using within established limits
In The City, participants predominantly described a fam-
ily context in which their parents and caregivers ac-
cepted their substance use, but within defined limits. For
one participant, these limits related to both age and de-
gree of alcohol consumption: “My 19-year-old sister, so
with her it’s like they accept that she drinks. [If] she gets
drunk though, she’ll get in trouble like, they’re gonna
give her the talking-to … but she’s over-age” (19 is the
legal drinking age in BC). While in this family, drinking
was acceptable over the legal age limit, there was also an
understanding that alcohol should be consumed in

 moderation. Other participants described a similar ap-
proach of parents and caregivers permitting moderate al-
cohol consumption, such as serving one drink with
dinner, or allowing their child to get “a bit tipsy” at a
special family gathering. In one participant’s words:
I mean like my parents, they did a good job, they did
not say “okay, no alcohol for you at all” they kinda
like they started me off with it, like “you can have a
glass of wine with dinner”. So occasionally, after work
on the weekend, I would have like a long day in the
sun, in the sun, right? Kind of working outside, so
like, “here, sit down I’ll get you beer” right? So we
have a beer and watch the hockey game.
Similarly, another participant stated, “I usually drink
wine with my parents”; while small amounts of wine are
normalized within the family, she learned from her par-
ents that “we have limits.” Youth described this ap-
proach of permitting use while encouraging moderation
as “relaxed,” and articulated that families that acknowl-
edged that some substance use would occur had more
realistic and reasonable expectations of young people.
Participants whose families permitted use within limits
took up these limits in their own approaches to substance
use, endorsing small amounts of alcohol consumption and
often resisting consuming alcohol to a degree that would
result in becoming drunk, which was viewed as excessive.
One participant described, “I don’t really have the need to
go out and just get piss drunk … it’s not like ‘okay I just
wanna drink just for the purpose of getting wasted.’ I don’t
have that.” Having learned at home that small amounts of
alcohol could be enjoyable without negative conse-
quences, this young person adopted an approach of mod-
eration when socializing with peers. Similarly, another
participant stated, “when you’re a kid you drink a bit of
wine and, sure, you get drunk sometimes because you
have a family party, you drink the rest of the champagne,
like you’re sort of a bit tipsy, it’s kind of fun.” She con-
trasted this approach of moderation with “you go to a
party, you see girls that are smashed.” Extending from her
own family’s approach of encouraging moderation, she
viewed getting excessively drunk at parties with peers as
undesirable alcohol consumption, while getting “tipsy” in
a safe setting was enjoyable. For many young people in
The City, encouraging moderation was viewed as a more
effective family approach to substance use than permitting
use without limits. One participant noted that in the ab-
sence of parental limit-setting, youth may not develop
strategies for moderating their own use: “the parents don’t
care, the parents think it’s fine … and the kids just don’t
learn.” This form of leniency was viewed by participants
as ineffective for supporting youth in developing strategies
for self-management of substance use, while supporting
use within limits was consistently viewed by youth as an
effective parental strategy for encouraging moderation.
The Valley: responding to zero-tolerance
In the Valley, participants’ families predominantly ad-
dressed substance use through a zero-tolerance or
abstinence-based approach, with youth recounting expli-
cit expectations from their parents that their children
avoid all substance use. Messaging that substance use is
unacceptable under any circumstance or in any amount
was common within youth descriptions of their families.
For example, one participant stated that her mother
consistently told her and her siblings “that we better not
do any of that … we’ve been told this since we’re very
young, like grade 5 probably.” While for many families
zero-tolerance was an overt expectation, some youth
also described family contexts in which abstinence from
all substances was assumed but not discussed. One par-
ticipant recounted a period in her earlier teenage years
when she went “down the rough road” of drinking alco-
hol and using substances. She described the response of
her family as: “my mom didn’t really know what was
happening and neither did my dad, but my sister did
and she tried telling my mom—but mom’s like ‘oh no,
[name of participant] would never do that.’” This lack of
awareness about the possibility of youth substance use

 was also reflected in how some participants perceived
their peers’ families. As one participant speculated, some
parents “they’re kind of oblivious to the fact that ‘my kid’
could actually do something like that.” Zero-tolerance ap-
proaches were frequently described as a disconnect from
the realities of young people’s substance use.
For some youth, a zero-tolerance approach in their
families resulted in their taking up of abstinence from
substances. As one participant described, “I’ve been of-
fered a lot of times, I’ve been tempted to, but I always
think that you know, I can’t cause my parents don’t, and
they expect me not to.” The participant who received
early zero-tolerance messaging from her mother simi-
larly stated: “the time came when people started doing
these things around grade 8—we didn’t have to think
about it. We already knew that that’s not something that
we were going to do.” However, other participants whose
parents and caregivers adopted a zero-tolerance ap-
proach used substances despite their family’s expecta-
tions and experienced negative effects on their family
relationships and difficulties in managing their own use.
One participant who reported occasionally drinking al-
cohol in moderation described the impact on her rela-
tionship with her mother: “when she was a teenager she
never did any of that, she never drank, she never did any
drugs … she never did anything bad. So, to her, that’s
like, I’m going to hell.” Another participant who used
substances described that her grandfather “was starting
to like, disown me—he didn’t want to be around me” be-
fore she became abstinent. In addition to impacting fam-
ily relationships, a zero-tolerance approach was also
described as leaving youth without strategies for man-
aging their own use or talking to their peers about sub-
stances. One participant shared his distress about a
friend’s heavy cannabis use, which he perceived as prob-
lematic, and stated that his friend’s parents were aware
of and permitted his use. This participant’s own family
supported a zero-tolerance approach, which limited his
development of strategies for discussing his concerns
with his friend. He stated, “I just can’t help him now,
‘cause his parents won’t help him right?’ … I just can’t
help him if his dad’s not going to say anything.” For
youth in The Valley, zero-tolerance family contexts did
at times result in abstinence. However, for both youth
who used and did not use substances, a zero-tolerance
approach was described as negatively impacting relation-
ships, preventing open dialog about substances, and con-
veying the message that young people could not be
trusted by adults.
The North: navigating intergenerational substance use
In The North, youth described substance use as visibly com-
monplace in town and frequent among the adults in their
live. Reflective of Rhodes’ risk environment, participants
frequently spoke to how this community context shaped
both their families’ and their own perspectives on substance
use. While substance use was not universal, and the type
and frequency varied, participants’ descriptions of their com-
munity consistently highlighted the prevalence of substance
use. One participant stated, “there’s a lot more drinking and
everything here, just cause it’s so small”, while another char-
acterized the town as “pretty good … until you have some
people into drugs and that, trying to go, ‘hey, have some-
thing.’” In this community context, most participants de-
scribed having family members—including parents—who
used substances or drank heavily. One participant described
her mother as having been in treatment for substance use,
while another stated that her father’s “drinking a lot last
year” led to “problems” for the rest of the family. While
some of the youth discussed their experience with a parent
or caregiver who used substances, in other families, sub-
stance use and drinking were widespread. A young woman
in The North described a period of time when her mother
“got into drugs … it kind of got the best of her”, while an-
other stated, “my grandfather’s an alcoholic, my grand-
mother, my grandfather, my step-grandma, are alcoholics.”
Unique to The North, participants also described attending
parties that were intergenerational, whereas in the other re-
search sites substance use occurred within peer groups and
often without adults’ awareness. One participant described
these parties as “mixed” between youth and adults, with
“people drinking all over on weekends and a lot of noise.”
Many participants described their parents’ substance
use, previous or ongoing, as shaping the family context
for substance use and impacting their own opinions and
use. Some participants held the belief that parental sub-
stance use would inevitably lead to problematic use in
children—“if their parents are alcoholics or they do
drugs or anything, they don’t really have the strength to
say no.” However, other participants challenged this nar-
rative, describing how experiencing their parents’ use
contributed to their own negative view of substance use.
One participant whose father previously used substances
stated, “I don’t do that stuff because my dad told me
that he went to jail that one day when he did it once,
then he told me not to do it … told me not to drink or
anything.”
Another
participant
who
described
her
mother as “an alcoholic” stated that people “think I’ll
turn out like my mom and stuff. They think I’ll be like
her, drink and do drugs, and be a troublemaker too and
stuff, but I’m nothing like her.” While this individual
drank regularly at parties with friends, she differentiated
her use from her mother’s in that she is avoiding “addic-
tion” and pursuing life goals—“trying to finish school so
I won’t have to be like her.” Due to the ubiquitous na-
ture of substance use in the community, including
among some of the participants’ family members, many
families attempted to navigate their children’s use by

 encouraging open communication and responsible use,
demonstrating complex intersections between Rhodes’
micro- and macro-level risk environments. For example,
one participant stated that her mother will obtain alco-
hol for her “as long as I’m responsible.” Another partici-
pant described her father’s approach to her substance
use as:
“you can’t chain a dog to a porch”, so he’s saying that
it’s like a metaphor like, you cannot stop kids from
doing what they do when they are out with their
friends, like you have no idea what they could do. And
so many parents do not know anything about what
their children do, and with my dad, because we are so
close he knows what I do and he trusts me a lot.
In many families, parents acknowledged youth sub-
stance use, but encouraged moderation. One individual’s
mother “let me have a few sips out of her drink, or she’ll
mix me a really weak one”, and another participant’s
father “told me to drink only on special occasions.” Each
of these participants took seriously and maintained these
limits established by their parents in their own alcohol
consumption. For others, witnessing negative effects of
substance use in their families led to independently devel-
oping limits for their own use: for example, one partici-
pant described using cannabis exclusively and avoiding all
other substances, stating “I see what that stuff does.”
Between-site youth perspectives on substance use
Across all three sites, youth articulated that family ap-
proaches to substance use were most effective when they
resonated with the realities of young people’s lives. Many
of the youth described their parents as having a lack of
understanding or an inability to relate to the contexts of
substance use for youth, which they identified as not
helpful for supporting youth in managing their own use.
One participant from The North reflected,
Once they become an adult and have a family and stuff,
something switches and then they do not understand
this side. And they are kind of, like, parent view. They
do not quite understand things. They do not see it from
our point of view, and they kind of think of it as
nonsense or they just do not see the full perspective.
They just see you, but they do not see what’s happening
and what’s around you and what’s in you … Very
straightforward perspective of their kids, I guess.
As a result, many youth across the research sites avoided
discussing substance use with their parents out of a con-
cern of “worrying” them, and suggested that any conversa-
tion about substance use was taboo within the family. As
stated by one participant from The Valley: “my mom always
gets upset every time I talk to her about this right?”. Con-
versely, youth reflected that parents being too “lenient”
about substance use was also unhelpful, and did not sup-
port youth to use within limits. One participant from The
North who described drinking alcohol frequently stated she
was “sick of it” but found it difficult to reduce her con-
sumption, as her parents “don’t really care about what I do.
I could go home drunk and they won’t do anything.”
Participants between the three research sites articu-
lated that both unrestricted leniency and zero-tolerance
approaches to substance use are unhelpful and do not
resonate with actual contexts of substance use in youths’
lives. Rather, youth reflected that openly discussing sub-
stance use within the family and parental modeling of
use in moderation are responsive approaches to youths’
actual use and helpful in managing potential harms asso-
ciated with substance use. Many participants called for
open communication with their parents about drug and
alcohol use “without being afraid of the consequences”.
Across sites, participants articulated that they value hon-
esty and trust, and reflected that the most helpful family
approaches are those that seek to understand and re-
spond to youths’ existing perspectives on substance use.
Discussion
Parents are frequently held responsible in society for
shaping their children’s perspectives on substance use;
however, there is limited guidance for parents in effect-
ively communicating with their children, or promoting
substance use behaviors that minimize harm. Addition-
ally, current literature on parental approaches to youth
substance use limitedly draws on the lived experiences
of young people to inform understandings of what ap-
proaches may be helpful, and how youth respond to par-
ental
messaging
about
substance
use.
To
support
parents in more effectively engaging with their children
about substance use, evidence-based approaches are
needed that are responsive to the realities of youths’ lives
and support them in understanding and reducing harms
of substance use—without drawing on ineffectual “scare
tactics.” This paper draws on youth perspectives to fur-
ther develop nuanced understandings of youth substance
use as situated in complex risk environments [28],
encompassing both family approaches and broader geo-
graphical and socio-political contexts. Further, our find-
ings illustrate that parental zero-tolerance approaches do
not resonate with the realities of youths’ experiences of
navigating substance use, and that across different com-
munity contexts, harm reduction approaches are more
responsive to youth perspectives and needs. Within
harm reduction philosophy, lived experience is founda-
tional to understanding “what works” and informing
policy and programming; yet, youth perspectives are fre-
quently absent from discourses on parental approaches

 to youth substance use [20, 32]. This paper presents
qualitative insights into youth responses to parental atti-
tudes toward substance use, including the practice of
parental provision, which requires more nuance in the
current literature. Findings from this analysis focused
predominantly on parental provision predominantly re-
lated to alcohol. This may firstly reflect that alcohol is
the most likely substance for parents to be using—par-
ticularly openly, with their children’s knowledge. Add-
itionally, participants may have selected to highlight
these stories within the interview context given that, at
the time of interview, alcohol was the only legal substance
described. However, while narratives of parental provision
centered predominantly on alcohol, young people’s per-
spectives on parental approaches to substance use reflected
attitudes to a wide range of substances.
In social discourse, youth who use substances are often
positioned as deviant “bad kids” who reject all authority,
including that of their parents [33]. This framing has
been thoroughly criticized in the research literature,
which has increasingly sought to understand the context
for youth decision-making around substance use. How-
ever, in seeking underlying factors that contribute to
youth substance use, the locus of blame has shifted to-
ward parents. Research studies have frequently examined
the role of parents in contributing to their children’s
substance use, and cite factors such as the parent-child
relationship, parenting style, and poor role modeling as
having potentially negative impacts on youth substance
use [34, 35]. This study’s analysis challenges such narra-
tives of blame that position either youth or their parents
as “at fault” for youth substance use. Rather, our findings
support a “risk environment” understanding of both the
broad and local contextual factors that shape youth ex-
periences of substance use [36]. At the environmental
micro-level, participants’ family contexts and parental mes-
saging impacted their attitudes and behavior regarding sub-
stance use and management of potential substance-related
harms. Additionally, at the macro-level, broader societal,
political, economic, and geographical factors contextualize
families’ beliefs, values, and perspectives. For example, in
The North, historical and current colonization has produced
a community context in which substance use as a trauma
response is widespread, and many youth reported having
family members who experienced problematic substance
use [37, 38]. In The Valley, the prevalence of religion has
contributed to a more socially conservative population over-
all, perhaps explaining the predominantly zero-tolerance
parental response to youth substance use in the families of
participants we interviewed [39, 40]. This macro-level ana-
lysis of the context for youth substance use is frequently
missing from the research literature, which risks perpetuat-
ing narratives of blame surrounding parental approaches
and fails to capture key factors that shape youth perspectives
and experiences. Programming and policy that aim to ad-
dress youth substance use or parental messaging on sub-
stance use must be responsive to not only the micro-level
family context but also the broader macro-level factors that
families are variously situated in and impacted by. In this
way, a risk environment lens supports an understanding of
youth substance use as informed by parental messaging and
practices, without reproducing discourses of blame.
While harm reduction has emerged as a predominant
approach for addressing substance use in adult popula-
tions and is beginning to be used as a guiding philosophy
for school-based substance use programming, messages to
parents about addressing their children’s substance use re-
main largely grounded in zero-tolerance. Governmental
messaging campaigns and policy approaches to youth sub-
stance use frequently seek non-controversial approaches,
and therefore advance abstinence-based approaches as the
best or only condoned parental strategy [7]. For example,
the government-led National Institute on Drug Abuse
[41] in the USA centers its messaging for parents on “pre-
venting teen drug use” and reinforces the notion that
“positive parenting prevents drug use”. Similarly, the Gov-
ernment of Canada’s [42] advice to parents cautions that
young people “may be using drugs and might need help to
stop”. Our findings on youth perspectives on family ap-
proaches to substance use illustrate that across all three
geographical sites, prevention of all substance use was not
an effective message for youth. In The City and The
North, zero-tolerance was not representative of the reality
of parental attitudes, which tended toward supporting
moderation in use. In The Valley, where zero-tolerance
was a common parental approach, participants reflected
that parents’ lack of understanding of or communication
about substance use was unhelpful and their expectations
of abstinence unrealistic. Abstinence-centered messaging
for parents may resonate with the zero-tolerance approach
of some families, such as in the more religious and conser-
vative Valley. However, this approach fails to prepare or
provide direction for parents in supporting youth in learn-
ing to moderate their own substance use, and reduce asso-
ciated harms. In contrast, across all three sites, harm
reduction approaches consistently resonated with youth,
who described integrating their parents’ messaging of
using within defined limits and balancing use with harm
minimization.
A potential limitation of this study is that as recruit-
ment was conducted through schools at each research
site, youth with poor attendance (or who are not cur-
rently enrolled in school) may not be represented in the
study sample. Additionally, youth participants may have
experienced discomfort in talking to adults about sub-
stance use, though this may have been mitigated by re-
searchers’
experience
building
rapport
with
young
people. Overall, members of the research team found
Slemon et al. Harm Reduction Journal           (2019) 16:26 
Page 8 of 10
 youth participants to be candid and open in sharing
their experiences across many difficult topics, including
substance use, and experiences of racism and bullying
[43]. Despite these limitations, a strength of this study is
the presentation of findings from across a diverse set of
communities, each with unique contexts that shape
youth experiences of substance use and perspectives on
parental approaches to substance use. The MSQA ap-
proach of analyzing data within and between sites con-
tributes to findings with broader applicability across
diverse settings and populations. Findings from this
study illustrate that in talking to their children about
substance use, parents are drawing on approaches that
align with harm reduction messaging and that these
messages resonate with youth experiences and perspec-
tives across diverse communities. Programming, policy,
and media campaigns that advance zero-tolerance as the
only
acceptable
parental
approach
are
unlikely
to
resonate with all parents, and risk leaving parents and
their children with little guidance for minimizing harms
within the context of some use [44].
Conclusions
Zero-tolerance continues to be promoted as the most
socially acceptable strategy for parents in talking to their
children about substance use. However, our findings il-
lustrate that abstinence-only messages do not resonate
with the realities of youth experiences or perspectives on
using substances, and suggest that parental messages
that support youth in using within limits and in building
capacity to minimize harm may be more resonant and
impactful. In addition, while harm reduction messaging
may be more responsive to youth experiences across di-
verse geographical and social contexts, parents continue
to have limited guidance or support in drawing on harm
reduction principles in communicating with their chil-
dren. Despite a social and political climate in North
America and many other Western countries that up-
holds zero-tolerance as ideal, findings from this study
contribute to the body of literature illustrating that
evidence-based messaging, programming, and policy are
needed that support parents in developing the necessary
knowledge and capacity to integrate harm reduction
principles into family responses to youth substance use.
