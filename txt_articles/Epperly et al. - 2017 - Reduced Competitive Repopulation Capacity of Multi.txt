 Abstract. Background/Aim: The polycythemia form of
Friend leukemia virus (FVP) causes splenomegaly and
lethal erythroleukemia in Fv-2s-susceptible mouse strains.
We sought to determine whether the hematopoietic stem cell
(HSC) pool was expanded in Fv-2r-resistant mice.
Materials and Methods: The 120-day bone marrow
transplantation competitive repopulation assay was used to
determine whether FVP-infected Fv-2r C57BL/6 mice
demonstrated expansion of the HSC pool compared to the
pool of committed hematopoietic progenitor cells in the
same marrow assayed in vitro. Results: There was a
significant 
expansion 
of 
committed 
hematopoietic
progenitors observed in virus-infected Fv-2s FVB mice, but
not Fv-2r C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, Fv-2r mice showed
no detectable expansion of either committed hematopoietic
progenitor cells or the multipotential stem cell pool by
competitive repopulation assay. Conclusion: Friend virus
disease in Fv-2s mice is associated with expansion of
committed hematopoietic progenitors. Fv-2r mice show no
expansion of either committed progenitor or pluripotential
stem cell numbers.
Decades 
of 
research 
in 
the 
pathophysiology 
of
erythroleukemia caused by the Friend virus led to the
hypothesis that mouse strains susceptible to leukemia by
expression of the erythropoietin receptor-linked Fv-2 locus
(1), as well as those mice resistant to erythroleukemia 
(Fv-2r), demonstrated expansion of the hematopoietic stem
cell (HSC) pool (2). Production of erythroid leukemia by
Friend virus has been shown to be dependent upon
interaction of the Friend virus with the Fv-2 locus
hematopoietic stem cells in the mouse model (1). The Fv-
2 susceptibility locus has been shown to encode a
truncated form of the Stk receptor tyrosine kinase, which
interacts with the erythropoietin receptor and stimulates
expansion of the erythroleukemia progenitor cell
population (1). Mice susceptible to Friend virus-induced
erythroblastosis express both full-length Stk and the N-
terminally truncated, short form-Stk, whereas resistant
alleles lack the internal promoter necessary for Sf-Stk
expression (1). A product of the Friend spleen focus
forming virus (SFFV) env gene, glycoprotein gp55, forms
disulfide bonds with Sf-Stk to stabilize it at the membrane
and promote its constitutive activation in Fv-2s mice (23).
Though Fv2r mice fail to develop Friend virus-induced
polycythemia, gp55 remains capable of promoting
constitutive activation of Jak2 and Stat5 (24). Additionally,
SFFV infection of Fv2r mice has been demonstrated to
increase the self-renewal capacity of bone marrow
hematopoietic stem cells (2) and long-term marrow cultures
derived from these same mice produce hematopoietic
progenitor cells for significantly extended durations (3, 4).
The data suggested that gp55 or a different genetic
component of the Friend virus might facilitate expansion of
normal HSCs in Fv-2r mouse marrow.

 In the present study, we quantified the possible expansion
of Friend virus-infected Fv-2r bone marrow from C57BL/6
mice using the more rigorous 120-day competitive
repopulation assay (15). We mixed virus-infected marrow in
varying ratios with uninfected marrow of opposite gender
mice and transplanted these mixtures into lethally-irradiated
recipients to determine whether the Friend virus had
expanded the stem cell pool. We compared the results with
in vitro assays for numbers of committed hematopoietic
progenitors from Friend virus-infected Fv-2r C57BL/6 and
Fv-2s, erythroleukemic FVB mice. We further tested the
hypothesis that any Friend SFFV effect on the expansion
capacity of hematopoietic progenitor cells was mediated
through abrogation of the negative regulator transforming
growth 
factor-beta 
(TGF-β) 
signaling. The 
results
demonstrate no detectable expansion of committed
progenitors or HSCs in Friend virus-infected Fv-2r mice and
suggest that marrow stem cell expansion cannot be separated
from erythroleukemogenesis by Friend virus. 
Materials and Methods
Mice. The Friend virus, erythroleukemia-sensitive (Fv-2s) FVB and
Friend virus-resistant (Fv-2r) C57BL/6 mice were obtained from
Taconic Biosciences (Hudson, NY, USA) and housed four per cage,
fed standard laboratory chow and deionized water, according to
Institutional IACUC protocols. Both male and female mice were
obtained and colonies maintained under identical conditions.
Virus preparation. The polycythemic variant of Friend virus (FVP)
was generated form FP63 producer cells (a gift from A. Berstein,
University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada). Cells were cultured in
alpha-MEM, 10% FBS and 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin until 90%
confluent at which point medium was replaced. Viral supernatant
was collected after an additional 24 hours of culture, pooled and
prepared as single-use aliquots. BALB/c mice were injected retro-
orbitally with 100 μl FVP to verify viral infectivity by severe
splenomegaly two weeks after infection.
Virus injections. Adult 6- to 8-week-old male and female mice of
both mouse strains were injected intravenously with 100 μl FVP.
Fv-2s (FVB) male and female mice were observed for the
development of erythroleukemia at 6-8 weeks by examination of the
spleen. Mice with palpable splenomegaly were confirmed to have
the Friend erythroleukemia by analysis of bone marrow and
peripheral blood for leukemic erythroblasts. At this time point, bone
marrow from both FVB and C57BL/6 mice was harvested and
assayed for committed progenitors and multipotential hematopoietic
stem cells. 
In vitro colony-forming assays. Fv-2s mice were examined weekly
for enlarged spleens as indications of Friend disease and, at week 
4-5 when spleens were enlarged, mice of both strains were
sacrificed and bone marrow harvested for in vitro colony-forming
assays and for competitive repopulation assay. 
For in vitro assays, fresh bone marrow from FVB, FVB (Friend
virus-infected), C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 (Friend virus-infected) mice
was harvested and made into single cells suspension. The bone
marrow was harvested at 4-5 weeks after virus injection. This time
point was chosen to coincide with the pre-morbid splenomegaly in
Fv-2s (FVB) recipient mice. 
Single cell suspensions of marrow were plated in varying densities
ranging from 5.0x104 to 2.0x105 cells per 1 cm tissue culture plate in
0.8% methylcellulose-containing medium supplemented with
interleukin (IL)-3, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-6,
IL-11, stem cell factor (SCF) and erythropoietin (StemCell
Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada), according to published
methods. In addition, cultures were supplemented with TGF-β
ranging from 1 ng/ml up to 1 mg/ml. Cultures were incubated in 37˚C
in a high humidity incubator, 7% oxygen for 14 days. Colonies of
greater than or equal to 50 cells per colony were scored at day 7 and
again at day 14. Day-14 sub-populations were scored for burst
forming unit erythroid (BFUe) and multi-lineage colony-forming unit-
granulocyte/erythroid/megakaryocytes/macrophage (CFU-GEMM),
and colony forming unit-granulocyte, macrophage (CFU-GM)
according to published methods. All experiments were repeated three
times from three separate virus-infected groups of mice. 
In vitro assay for TGF-β inhibition of hematopoietic stem cell
colony formation. Bone marrow from adult mice was removed and
single cell suspensions prepared. Cells were plated in semisolid
medium containing IL-3, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-11 and
erythropoietin, according to published methods. Colony-forming at
days 7, 10 and 14 were scored separating for CFU-GM CFU-
GEMM and BFUe, according to published methods. Total colonies
were also scored at each time point. Plating densities ranged from
1×104 to 1×105 cells per 1 ml culture volume. For TGF-β inhibition
assay, concentrations of TGF-β ranging from 0.1 mg/ml to 1 μg/ml
were utilized. Results were plotted as percent inhibition of colony
formation by TGF-β. 
Assays for intact TGF-β signaling pathways in friend virus-
infected fresh Fv-2r and Fv-2s marrow. Assays for each of 5 TGF-
β signaling pathways were carried out, according to published
methods (23). Assays for the canonical signaling pathway
through: (i) SMAD3; (ii) the phospho-ERK pathway or non-
canonical pathways; (iii) PI3-Kinase pathway; (iv) p38, JNK-1
pathway; and (v) the RHO-Kinase pathway were carried out,
according to published methods for Western blots (12, 23).
Western blots were carried out three times on three sets of bone
marrow from the four treatment groups (virus-infected or -
uninfected FVB on C57BL/6 mice).
Competitive repopulation assay. Methods for the competitive
repopulation assay have been described in detail (15). Briefly, donor
marrow for transplant was harvested from virus-infected and control
uninfected male and female C57BL/6 mice and single cell
suspensions mixed in varying ratios of male to female comparing
virus-infected to uninfected. Experiments consisted of virus-infected
female with uninfected male, virus-infected male with uninfected
female in both directions and marrow was transplanted into lethally
irradiated (1,000 cGy split course) C57BL/6 female recipients. The
ratio of virus-infected to -uninfected varied from 10 to 1, 3 to 1, 1
to 1, 1 to 3, and 1 to 10. 
Female 
C57BL/6 
transplant 
recipients 
were 
injected
intravenously with each mixture of donor marrow cells and

 followed for 120 days, then sacrificed and the bone marrow
removed. Bone marrow was tested for the presence of the Y-
chromosome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
DNA isolation and quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. Mouse
bone marrow treated with ACK Lysing Buffer (Quality Biological,
Gaithersburgh, MD, USA, Cat. No: 118-156-101), then DNA was
isolated using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The
Netherlands, Cat. No: 69504). DNA quantitated using a
spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA, DU 530),
then diluted to 0.05 μg/μl.
For quantitative PCR, 4 μl of DNA, 10 μl of iTaq Universal
Probes Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA, Cat. #: 172-5134),
1 μl of primer and 4 μl of nuclease-free water were used. 
Primers for mouse Y chromosome Uty genes were used from
Applied Biosystems (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA,
USA, Cat. #: Mm00527273_cn). Primers for inner control Tfrc
genes were selected from Applied Biosystems (Cat. #: 4458370).
The thermocycler conditions were 95˚C for 2 min, 1 cycle then went
to 95˚C for 15 second, 59˚C for 30 sec for 45 cycles. QT-PCR
performed on a MastercyclerRealplex2 from Eppendrof (San Diego,
CA, USA). Triplicates were accepted in a 0.5 cycle threshold (CT)
range. Relative quantification was achieved using the ΔΔCt method.
Statistical analysis. In vitro colony assays for explanted whole bone
marrow cells in single cell suspension were scored at days 7 and 14
and statistical evaluations carried out according to published
methods (11).
For the competitive repopulation assay, the percent of mice
negative for reconstitution by FV-infected marrow at 120 days after
transplant was plotted against the number of injected male mouse
cells (C57BL/6 control marrow or C57BL/6 friend virus-infected
marrow) mixed with female uninfected C57BL/6 marrow in varying
ratios. A single-hit model was fitted for each donor cell type and
comparison between the two donor types was performed with the
likelihood ratio test using the asymptotic chi-square approximation
(15, 22). We performed this test with enhanced location dependent
addressing (elDA) function in statmod package of R software
(University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA).
Results
Friend virus-susceptible (Fv-2s) FvB mice demonstrate
significant expansion of committed hematopoietic progenitor
cells in bone marrow. We tested the bone marrow of both
C57BL/6 and FvB virus-infected compared to uninfected
mice at the time point when Fv-2s mice (FVB) demonstrated
significant splenomegaly and erythroleukemia. There was a
significant difference in the number of multilineage CFU-
GEMM hematopoietic colony-forming cells in freshly-
removed bone marrow from C57BL/6 compared to FVB
mice. Uninfected C57BL/6 mouse marrow showed higher
numbers of CFU-GEMM hematopoietic progenitor cells
compared to FVB mouse marrow. These results confirm and
extend mouse strain differences published previously (10).
As shown in Figure 1, marrow from virus-infected FVB
mice showed a significant expansion of day 7 and day 14
(Figure 1) committed multilineage colony-forming cells
compared to numbers detected in uninfected mice. In
contrast, virus-infected C57BL/6 mouse marrow showed
fewer multilineage colony-forming cells both in the day 7
and day 14 (Figure 1) assays. These results establish that
there was no detectable expansion of numbers of
multilineage hematopoietic progenitor colony-forming cells
above the baseline levels in Friend virus-infected C57BL/6
mice compared to the clear virus induced expansion detected
in FVB mouse marrow. Other results for separated subsets
of Burst Forming Unit erythroid (BFUe) from virus-infected
marrow reflected the same strain differences.
Absence of detectable expansion of true bone marrow stem
cells in friend virus-infected C57BL/6 mice measured by the
competitive repopulation assay. We next tested Friend virus-
infected C57BL/6 mouse marrow for expansion of true
multipotential hematopoietic stem cell numbers by the
competitive repopulation assay. C57BL/6 male and female
(donor) mice were injected with Friend virus as described
in the methods. Bone marrow was isolated from male
C57BL/6 donor male and female mice that had been
injected with Friend virus 4 weeks previously, and from
control uninfected donor male or female C57BL/6 mice.

Figure 1. CFU-GEMM increases in Friend virus-infected Fv-2s and Fv-
2s marrow. FVB (Fv-2s) Friend virus-infected mice have increased
numbers of committed bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells
forming CFU-GEMM colonies in vitro scored at days 7 and 14.
 The bone marrow from virus positive and virus negative
male mice was mixed in different ratios with sex-
mismatched C57BL/6 female marrow in different ratios to
create mixtures resulting in 1×106 cells injected. The Y
chromosome positive virus-infected cells were used in
mixtures where their component was between 1×105 (10%)
and 1×106 (100%) of the inoculum. The female recipient
C57BL/6 mice were irradiated to 10 Gy. Donor marrow was
then injected into irradiated recipient female mice. At 120
days after transplantation, the recipient mice were
sacrificed, bone marrow isolated, and DNA extracted. Real
time PCR was performed for the detection of Y
chromosome. As shown in Figure 2, Friend virus-infected
C57BL/6 bone marrow showed decreased competitive
repopulation capacity compared to uninfected marrow.
Varying the ratios of uninfected male to female marrow and
injection into uninfected C57BL/6 female mice, and marrow
harvested at 120 days after injection showed clearly better
competitive repopulation (Figure 2). The statistical
comparison of the two cell types are in Table I. The Friend
virus-infected C57BL/6 marrow sources had reduced
repopulation ability compared to the uninfected C57BL/6
marrow (p=0.0024) 
The results of the competitive repopulation assay data is
presented in Figure 2 as the percent of recipient mice at 120
days that show no detectable male origin Y-chromosome
genetic material in the bone marrow of female recipient mice
at 120 days. Therefore, the greater number of animals with
no detectable male origin marrow in Friend virus-infected
donor marrow injected recipients relative to uninfected
marrow demonstrates a clear absence of detectable expansion
of the hematopoietic stem cell pool in virus-infected
C57BL/6 mouse marrow. 
TGF-β suppression of in vitro colony formation by friend
virus-infected marrow. We tested whether TGF-β inhibited
colony formation in vitro by virus-infected Fv-2s compared
to Fv-2r marrow. There was inhibition of both day 7 and day
14 scored CFU-GEMM colony growth by increasing
concentrations of TGF-β in both control and Friend virus-
infected (Fv-2s) FVB mouse marrow (Figure 3A and 3B,
respectively). 
In contrast to virus-infected FVB mouse marrow, Fv-2r
C57BL/6 virus-infected mice demonstrated decreased
numbers of marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells compared
to uninfected C57BL/6 mouse marrow. This difference

Figure 2. Friend virus infection reduces the competitive repopulation

competitive repopulation capacity of marrow from Friend virus-infected
C57BL/6 (Fv-2r) mice was demonstrated. Results are for the day 120
harvest after marrow transplantation of varying ratios of FV-infected
compared to -uninfected C57BL/6 marrow. Results are presented as
described in the “Materials and Methods” section. FV-infected mice
had a significantly reduced competitive repopulation capacity
(p=0.0024).

 between mouse strain hematopoietic assays in vitro has been
reported (4, 8, 10). However, there was also TGF-β
inhibition of both day 7 (Figure 3C) and day 14 (Figure 3D)
scored CFU-GEMM in virus-infected and control C57BL/6
marrow. Thus, TGF-β inhibited formation of colonies by
committed hematopoietic colony-forming cells in the assays
for day 7 and day 14 CFU-GEMM with marrow from both
mouse strains.

Figure 3. TGF-β inhibition of CFU-GEMM from bone marrow isolated from Fv2s and Fv2r mice. Bone marrow was isolated from control as well
as Friend virus-infected Fv2s FvB and Fv2r C57BL/6 mice and analyzed for the production of day 7 and day 14 CFU-GEMM in the presence of
TGF-β. Bone marrow from Fv2s FvB mice had decreased CFU-GEMM in the presence of TGF-β for both Day 7 (Figure 3A) and Day 14 (Figure
3B). Similar TGF-β inhibition of CFU-GEMM was seen at Day 7 (Figure 3C) and Day 14 (Figure 3D) for Fv2r C57BL/6 bone marrow.
 Suppression of the Smad3-mediated TGF-β signaling
pathway in friend virus-infected marrow. We assayed the
protein markers for five different TGF-β signaling pathways
in Friend virus-infected mouse marrow of each strain (21).
The marrow of both FVB (Fv-2s) and C57BL/6 (Fv-2r),
Friend virus-infected mice showed reduced levels of Smad3
and the Smad3 dependent P-ERK pathway (Figure 4). In
contrast, there was an up-regulation of other TGF-β
signaling pathways, including those involving P-PAK, P-S6K
and P-JNK in virus-infected marrow.
Discussion
Erythroleukemia induction by Friend virus in susceptible
mouse strains is controlled by the Fv-2 locus (1). A previous
study suggested that erythroleukemogenesis could be
separated from the expanded self-renewal capacity of
hematopoietic stem cells by using Fv-2r mice that are virus-
infected, but do not develop fatal splenomegaly and
leukemia (2). The Friend virus is known to expand the pool
size of non-malignant multipotential and differentiated
colony-forming cells measured in vitro (3). The assay for
spleen focus formation by Friend virus (SFFV) in Fv-2s
marrow (3-9) was used to quantitate virus titer in prior
studies. The prior study of true stem cells in Fv-2r mice used
the serial transplantation method (2) rather than the
competitive repopulation assay (15). In the serial transfer
assay, C57BL/6 mice were injected with the Friend virus,
their marrow harvested at 12 days and injected intravenously
into a second generation of lethally irradiated syngeneic
C57BL/6 mice (2). Successive generations of marrow
transfer every 12 days led to an increased number of serial
transfers that significantly exceeded the number observed
when uninfected marrow was used (2). These experiments
suggested that the expansion of hematopoietic stem cell
numbers by Friend virus could be separated from
erythroleukemogenesis by using difference at the Fv-2 locus.
The serial transfer assay has been questioned as to its true
reflection of numbers of multilineage hematopoietic stem cells
in the bone marrow. In contrast, the competitive repopulation
assay (15) in which a single generation of lethally irradiated
recipient mice is injected with varying ratios of each of two
bone marrow sources use a difference in gender in the assay for
Y-chromosome in peripheral blood and marrow. At 120 days
after transplantation of these combined mixed marrow sources
into lethally irradiated recipient mice the data has been shown
to be more representative of a relative abundance of true
hematopoietic stem cells. The competitive repopulation assay is
commonly used to accurately quantitate expansion of true
hematopoietic stem cells. The logic of this technique is that 120
days is necessary to deplete lethally irradiated recipients of the
function of committed hematopoietic progenitor cells, including
those with capacity to differentiate to granulocyte-macrophage,
multilineage erythroid/ megakaryocyte/macrophage/neutrophil,
as well as lympho-hematopoietic progenitor cells, but not
primitive multipotential stem cells.

Figure 4. Intact TGF-β signaling pathways in (FVB) Fv-2s compared to (C57BL/6) Fv-2r Friend virus-infected marrow. Friend virus infection
suppresses SMAD3 levels in both FVB (Fv-2s) and C57BL/6 (Fv-2r) bone marrow. Western blot of TGF pathway signaling proteins shows decreased
SMAD3 and P-ERK but increased levels of expression of P-S6K, P-JNK (in FVB) and p-PAK in both virus-infected mouse marrow. 
 In the present studies, we tested whether competitive
repopulation assay supported a previous study using the
serial transfer assay, to confirm true hematopoietic stem cell
numbers had increased in Friend virus-infected Fv-2r
C57BL/6 mice. If the competitive repopulation assay had
confirmed the prior serial transfer assay (2), this result would
suggest that the Friend virus had expanded stem cell
numbers under conditions, in which the Friend virus
erythroleukemia did not occur. Such information might have
motivated us to carry out experiments to determine the gene
or genes in the Friend virus that had induced stem cell
expansion in the absence of erythroleukemogenesis.
The present studies did not provide evidence for
expansion of true multipotent hematopoietic stem cells in
Fv-2r C57BL/6 mice that were infected with Friend virus.
Therefore, these results suggest that the prior use of serial
transfer assay (3) may have been measuring committed
progenitor cell expansion rather than true stem cells. The
present data also suggest that the significant increase in
production of hematopoietic cells and increased longevity
of hematopoiesis in long-term bone marrow cultures
(LTBMCs) derived from Friend virus-infected C57BL/6
mice (4). The longevity of Friend virus-infected marrow in
LTBMCs from C57BL/6 mice may have reflected the in
vitro culture system in which high levels of added 17-
hydroxy corticosteroid and absence of immunoregulatory
cells represent artificial growth conditions for bone marrow
(3-8). Furthermore, the indirect effect on hematopoietic cells
of the hematopoietic microenvironment may be a critical
factor reported then and still of relevance now in
understanding marrow committed stem cells (8, 16-17).
Finally, the lack of use of a clonal Friend virus in prior
studies (3, 4, 8, 16-17) may have introduced confounding
variables, not testable in the present studies.
Like Friend virus infection of marrow in vitro (4),
inhibition of TGF-β signaling in Smad3-/- bone marrow also
shows a significantly increased duration of hematopoiesis in
long-term cultures (13) compared to the longevity of
hematopoiesis in wild-type mouse bone marrow stem cells,
which have intact TGF-β signaling (13). A recent publication
showed that TGF-β hyper-responsiveness of hematopoietic
stem cells from Fanconi anemia (Fancd2-/-) mice exhausts
the hematopoietic stem cell compartment, decreases
competitive repopulation capacity of stem cells and produces
marrow failure (12). Whether Friend virus acted by blocking
TGF-β signaling and resulted in expansion of marrow stem
cell self-renewal (2) has not been previously investigated.
We found that TGF-β suppressed CFU-GM formation in
vitro by both virus-infected and uninfected FvB and
C57BL/6 marrow in vitro. Furthermore, the suppression
occurred despite down-regulation of 2 of the 5 TGF-β
signaling pathways (Smad3 and P-ERK) in virus-infected
marrow of both mouse strains.
The present results establish that the erythroleukemogenic
Friend virus does not detectably expand true normal marrow
stem cells in Fv-2r mice using the competitive repopulation
assay.
