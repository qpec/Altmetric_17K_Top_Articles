Abstract
Background—Prior studies suggest associations between fetal exposure to antimicrobial and 
paraben compounds with adverse reproductive outcomes, mainly in animal models. We have 
previously reported elevated levels of these compounds for a cohort of mothers and neonates.
Objective—We examined the relationship between human exposure to parabens and 
antimicrobial compounds and birth outcomes including birth weight, body length and head size, 
and gestational age at birth.
Methods—Maternal third trimester urinary and umbilical cord blood plasma concentrations of 
methylparaben (MePB), ethylparaben (EtPB), propylparaben (PrPB), butylparaben (BuPB), 
benzylparaben (BePB), triclosan (2,4,4′-trichloro-2′-hydroxydiphenyl ether or TCS) and 
triclocarban (1-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl) urea or TCC), were measured in 185 
mothers and 34 paired singleton neonates in New York, 2007–2009.
Results—In regression models adjusting for confounders, adverse exposure-outcome 
associations observed included increased odds of PTB (BuPB), decreased gestational age at birth 
(BuPB and TCC) and birth weight (BuPB), decreased body length (PrPB) and protective effects on

 PTB (BePB) and LBW (3′-Cl-TCC) (p < 0.05). No associations were observed for MePB, EtPB, 
or TCS.
Conclusions—This study provides the first evidence of associations between antimicrobials and 
potential adverse birth outcomes in neonates. Findings are consistent with animal data suggesting 
endocrine-disrupting potential resulting in developmental and reproductive toxicity.

1. Introduction
Various classes of environmental phenols including parabens, triclosan (2,4,4′-trichloro-2′-
hydroxydiphenyl ether; TCS), and the (non-phenolic) carbanilide triclocarban (1-(4-
chlorophenyl)-3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)urea; TCC), have the propensity to cause hormonal 
disturbances in both in utero and ex utero development. Exposure to these compounds 
occurs primarily through use of cosmetics and antimicrobial consumer products in adults 
and, in neonates, ingestion of breast milk containing chemical residues. Numerous studies 
have been conducted that examined the presence of parabens [1], TCC [2] and TCS [3] in 
human blood at significant levels following the use of personal care products containing 
these compounds. Estrogenic effects from exposure to phenols have been documented [4], 
including decreases in body length [5] and effects on birth weight [6] in humans, and 
disruptions in the reproductive endocrine system in relevant animal models, as well as early 
onset of puberty in sheep [7]. In vitro assays have allowed for the identification of 
antagonistic activity of androgen receptors for compounds such as TCC [8]. These data 
provide sufficient grounds to investigate occurrence of adverse reproductive effects on 
humans at typical levels of exposure.
Parabens are a class of chemicals used in cosmetics and food-stuffs as preservatives and 
known to affect the endocrine system. Similar to other phenols, parabens and butyl paraben 
(BuPB) in particular have been found to exhibit estrogenic properties [9] in both human and 
murine studies, directly binding to estrogen receptors, albeit at an efficacy 10,000 weaker 
than 17β-estradiol and to a lower biological effect than phenols [10,12]. These compounds 
have been found to exhibit antiandrogenic properties in vitro with an androgen receptor-
mediated transcriptional activity assay [20]. Parabens have also been found to promote 
murine adipocyte differentiation in in vitro assays, which may explain the increased birth 
weight associated with their presence in human maternal urine samples [11]. Paraben 
exposure has been linked to the disruption of uterine blastocyst implantation in mice [12], 
and decreases in sperm count as a result of maternal exposure to butylparaben in the diet of 
rats [13], lending evidence to the reproductive toxic potential of parabens.
The antibacterial agents TCS and TCC, commonly used in numerous products from personal 
care to industrial cleaning, have also been shown to exhibit endocrine-disrupting potential. 
For example, in a recent cohort study, Philippat et al. [6] found an inverse correlation 
between increases in TCS levels in maternal urine and decreases in neonate head 
circumference (correlation coefficient = 0.5–0.6). Various studies have revealed several other

 associations, such as TCS exposure being associated with a reduction of thyroxine (T4) in 
female Long-Evans and Wistar rats [14,15], the sensitization of body tissue toward allergens 
in humans [16], and the inhibition of muscle function in mice [17]. Structural similarities 
between TCS and thyroid hormones may serve to explain this action [14]. In a study looking 
at exposure and birth outcomes, TCS was inversely associated with body length and birth 
weight, but this result was only seen in young males [18]. TCC is more often found as an 
antimicrobial in soaps and its associated metabolites have been discovered at quantifiable 
amounts in urine samples after exposure from soap use during even a single shower [19]. 
TCC is also a strong inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase [2], an enzyme involved in the process 
of cholesterol synthesis [20]. In rats, TCC has an effect of increasing the size of male sex 
accessory organs [21], likely through synergism with the androgen hormone receptor ligand 
[22]. Liver tumor formation has been associated with TCS exposure of mice following oral 
dosing [23]. In this paper, we explored the extent of human fetal exposure to the above 
endocrine-disrupting preservatives and antimicrobials with particularly focus on associations 
with a range of potential adverse birth outcomes identified previously mostly in animal 
models.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cohort and sampling procedure
Archived samples of third trimester maternal urine (6–9th month) and human cord blood 
plasma, collected at two different time points, were used in this work and originated from an 
urban immigrant population investigated previously for prenatal exposure to mercury [24] 
and to the antimicrobials triclosan and triclocarban [25]. This previous study details the 
sampling procedures and cohort descriptors. Pregnant women (aged 18–45 years) were 
recruited at the University Hospital of Brooklyn’sPrenatal Clinic between October 2007 and 
December 2009. From the original cohort of 191, the final cohort included 185 pregnant 
women and singleton infants after excluding non-singleton (n = 4) and improbable birth 
weight/gestational age at birth combinations (n = 2) [24,25]. Random “spot” urine 
specimens were provided once per participant during the 6–9th month of pregnancy. A 
convenience subset of participants were followed to delivery, at which time an umbilical 
cord blood specimen was collected from the neonate for plasma isolation and storage at 
−80 °C for subsequent lab analysis (n = 38). Maternal urinary concentrations were measured 
of each of the paraben compounds targeted, including methylparaben (MePB), ethylparaben 
(EtPB), propylparaben (PrPB), butylparaben (BuPB) and benzylparaben (BePB), as well as 
TCS and TCC (Table S1) (see Supplemental Material). Specimens from humans were 
collected in polypropylene vials. A random subset of umbilical blood plasma samples (n = 
21) was analyzed for both free and total concentrations of parabens, as the sample cups had 
not been pre-screened for the presence of target analytes. A previously developed 
questionnaire was used [24] to ascertain demographic data, including maternal age, nativity, 
race/ethnic origin, and education level, medical history, and to assess sources of 
environmental exposure (i.e., mercury). Neonate outcome data were collected from the 
patient’s chart. The study and protocol were approved by the Institutional Review Boards 
(IRBs) of the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, and of the New York 
Geer et al.

2.2. Chemical analysis
The samples were shipped on dry ice to Arizona State University and archived at −80 °C. 
Urine aliquots of 2 mL were measured for creatinine [24]. Specimens (1 mL of material 
urine or 100 µL of cord blood plasma) were thawed, spiked with a solution containing six 
isotope-labeled standards (10 µL) as well as a solution containing two hydrolysis standards 
(50 µL), and diluted with a solution containing hydrolysis enzymes (1 mL). A detailed 
description of the standards and reagents used can be found in our prior studies [25,26]. An 
additional 900 µL MS-grade water was added to the umbilical cord blood samples. Target 
analytes were extracted using 60 mg Oasis HLB (Waters, Milford, MA) solid-phase 
extraction cartridges.
Extraction Procedure for TCS and TCC. To perform isotope dilution and hydrolysis of 
phase-II metabolites of TCS and TCC [2] for total concentration determination of TCS, 
TCC, 2′-OH-TCC, 3′-OH-TCC, and 3′-Cl-TCC, the biological samples (1 mL of material 
urine or 100 µL of cord blood plasma) were thawed, spiked with a mixed solution of 
isotope-labeled standards (10 µL) and a hydrolysis standard solution (50 µL), and diluted 
with enzyme solution (1 mL). An additional 900 µL of MS-grade water was added to the 
cord blood samples. Analytes were extracted using a 24-port Visiprep vacuum manifold 
(Supelco, St. Louis, MO) and 60 mg of Oasis HLB (Waters, Milford, MA) solid-phase 
extraction cartridges.
Extraction Procedure for Parabens. For parabens analysis, methanolic extracts were diluted 1 
+ 1 with water. Aliquots of 100 µL were injected onto a liquid chromatography triple 
quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer (LC–MS/MS; API 4000, ABSciex, Framingham, 
MA). For antimicrobials analysis, individual stock solutions of the native and isotopically 
labeled compounds were prepared in methanol.
All analytes and their respective labeled standards were identified using their specific 
retention time and two multiple reaction monitoring transitions [25,26]. All extractions were 
performed along with solvent blanks, reagent blanks, and instrument performance standards 
as reported in Pycke et al. [25,26].
2.3. Statistical analyses
Due to their non-normal distribution, urinary biomarker concentrations were log-
transformed prior to analysis. Non-detect values were treated as the method detection limit 
(MDL) divided by the square root of two, and were imputed for all compounds except for 
TCS, PrPB and MePB, for which there were no non-detects. Maternal urinary biomarker 
levels were corrected for creatinine (micrograms per gram creatinine; µg/g) to normalize for 
urine dilution [18]. Covariates were selected for the final models if they achieved a p < 0.05 
in Spearman correlations or Chi-square tests in relation to biomarker levels or birth 
outcomes. Predictors of birth outcomes (i.e., body length, gestational age at birth, birth 
weight, head circumference) were analyzed using generalized linear models. We used 
multiple linear regression to evaluate pollutant-outcomes associations adjusted for the

 possible confounders. Model confounders considered included maternal age, nativity, 
neonate gender, alcohol and tobacco. We adjusted for confounders that were independently 
associated with the outcomes variable, or which changed the magnitude of the effects size by 
at least 5% when included in multiple linear regression models. Co-occurring pollutants that 
were not highly correlated (correlation coefficient = <0.6) were adjusted for in final multi-
pollutant models. The relationship between pollutant predictors and the dichotomous 
outcomes preterm birth (PTB), birth at <37 weeks, and low birth weight (LBW), birth 
weight <2,500 g, were analyzed using logistic regression. All statistical tests were evaluated 
at the significance level of p < 0.05, using SPSS v. 22 software (IBM, Armonk, NY).
3. Results
A subset of samples from the original maternal and neonate cohort were included in the 
antimicrobial and paraben analyses (n = 185 and n = 34, respectively) [24–26]. A number of 
respondents were missing data for creatinine (n = 20 observations) and for birth parameters 
(n = 20 observations). The prevalence of LBW was 17.2% and for PTB was 23.3% (n = 
163). Maternal urinary and cord blood plasma pollutant levels by demographic factor can be 
found in Tables 1 and 2. Pollutant levels by quartile are located in Table S2. We reported 
creatinine-corrected urinary pollutant levels for all analyses. All creatinine values fell 
between >20 and <275 mg/dL. In adjusted, linear regression models (significance level p < 
0.05), cord blood plasma PrPB was associated with decreased body length (β = −1.06 95% 
CI −2.06, −0.05), and plasma TCC and BuPB were associated with decreased gestational 
age at birth, in weeks (β = −2.15 95% CI −3.91, −0.40; β = −3.04 95% CI −5.09, −0.99, 
respectively; Tables 4). Cord blood plasma BuPB was associated with increased odds of 
preterm birth (PTB) with an odds ratio (OR) of (OR = 60.77, 95% CI 2.60, 1417.93) (Table 
5). Cord blood plasma BuPB was marginally associated with decreased birth weight (β = 
−480.40, 95% CI −976.68, 15.89) (p = 0.057). Urine BuPB was associated with decreased 
gestational age at birth (β = −0.36, 95% CI −0.72, −0.01 Table 3). We further explored these 
protective effects by summing urinary TCC and congeners into one parameter for the model. 
Results were no longer significant using the summed parameter.
In a sensitivity analysis, there was little change to parameter estimates when modeling 
creatinine-corrected versus for creatinine adjustment as a separate variable in the analyses. 
In the sensitivity analysis, urinary BuPB, PrPB and 2′-OH-TCC were marginally 
significantly associated with decreased body length. Cord blood plasma TCC was no longer 
associated with gestational age at delivery.
4. Discussion
This is the first time human fetal data for TCC and its metabolites have been assessed for 
prenatal exposure and potential adverse birth outcomes. In our study, pollutant levels were 
associated with increased odds of PTB (BuPB), decreased gestational age at birth (BuPB 
and TCC) and birth weight (BuPB), decreased body length (PrPB) and protective effects on 
PTB (BePB) and LBW (3′-Cl-TCC). No associations were observed for MePB, EtPB, or 
TCS. Decreases in these growth parameters could serve as a precursor to additional adverse 
outcomes in early childhood and throughout the life course. Findings, such as for BuPB,

 may be considered most robust for associations that were observed across both matrices (and 
in the same direction).
The ubiquitous nature of these endocrine-disrupting compounds in female-directed cosmetic 
and personal care products places neonates at high risk for exposure. A multitude of studies 
have been performed on the in utero effects of phenolic environmental compounds, many of 
which focus on bisphenol A (BPA). Research on such compounds often produced results 
similar to those found in this study. Tang et al. [5] found that increased exposure to BPA was 
associated with decreased gestational age at birth in boys, as was found with BuPB in the 
current study in both genders. BuPB was also associated with decreased birth weight. In 
contrast, BePB was protective for gestational age at birth, with similar effects seen in 
Philippat et al. [6] demonstrating a protective effect on weight. Parabens have been 
positively associated with subsequent infant weight throughout the first three years of life, 
suspected to by caused by the estrogenic action of these compounds [6].
In a prior study by Wolf et al. [18] TCS was associated with low birth weight and shorter 
body length in boys (n = 339), whereas in our study we found no association. In Philippat et 
al. [6], TCS was negatively associated with head circumference. Thus contrasting data on 
TSC calls for more study on the potential for adverse birth outcomes.
Various mechanisms have been proposed to account for the observed pollutant associations 
with birth outcomes. Watkins et al. [27] have proposed mechanisms including oxidative 
stress, and found associations between both levels of bisphenol A (BPA) and paraben 
compounds, and increased oxidative stress. Oxidative stress has been found to promote fetal 
growth restriction and low birth weight, along with several maternal pregnancy-related 
disorders, and additional adverse health effects for the child later in life [28]. Watkins et al. 
[27] also observed an association between TCS and elevated IL-6 levels. IL-6 is an 
inflammatory cytokine that has been linked to similar negative outcomes, primarily PTB 
[29]. Causal associations of these observations remain unproven. Various studies have 
explored groups of compounds known to elicit endocrine-disrupting effects in both parents 
and offspring. Schiffer et al. [30] examined the effects of 96 endocrine-disrupting chemicals 
(EDCs) on human sperm. One of the most notable EDC’sfrom this study, TCS, activates a 
specific CatSper channel of principal import for regulating calcium in mammalian sperm, 
responsible for motility. EDCs such as TCS compete with progesterone and prostaglandins 
to block CatSper activation, essentially desensitizing sperm. Such effects may negatively 
impact fertility, highlighting concerns with reproductive outcomes in these compounds. In a 
recent fertility study, Dodge et al. [31] found that paternal urinary phenol (namely, methyl 
paraben) was associated with decreased odds of live birth. Kennedy et al. [32] exposed rats 
to different concentrations of TCC during lactation and documented significant post-
parturition effects on offspring. These cases provide grounds for a thorough longitudinal 
study in which parent-child pairs would be followed from conception through early 
adolescence to more fully understand the effects of these compounds.
Our study has limitations. Maternal urine was used as a proxy for fetal exposure, except 
where neonate cord blood plasma was available as a measure of internal dose. The timing of 
sampling may have biased results, as product use contributing to exposure may differ over

 the course of the pregnancy, and contaminant levels may fluctuate with changing water 
retention profiles [18]. Though it can reasonably be assumed that levels found in our study 
for the third trimester were representative of exposure at other time points across the 
duration of pregnancy, as Mortensen et al. [33] found consistent levels of environmental 
phenols during different time points of pregnancy, several other studies demonstrate that 
multiple urine levels may be more appropriate to capture inter-individual variability and to 
adequately characterize longer-term exposure due to the short half-life of some of these 
compounds [1,3,34]. However, there is some degree of confidence in our findings of BuPB 
associations in both matrices (urine and cord blood plasma), indicating that similar doses 
were delivered to different tissue departments resulting in similar outcomes. This is less so 
for compounds without a matching cord blood plasma sample. Because the urine specimen 
collection predated the cord blood plamsa collection, it can also be posited that having two 
determinations of exposure to a relatively short-lived compound increases our confidence 
that we have characterized variability in exposure at these different time points. Because we 
performed multiple data comparisons, we cannot rule out findings due to chance. The 
sample size of this study limits the ability to identify significant associations. Likewise, the 
homogeneity of our participant population may affect study generalizability. Additionally, 
our co-pollutant models did not include other pollutant compounds such as BPA and flame 
retardants that have been previously associated with endocrine disruption [35,36]. Findings 
reported here for a rather limited study cohort on both adverse (BuPB) and protective 
outcomes (BePB, 3′-Cl-TCC) from human exposure to antimicrobial compounds should be 
verified with larger, additional studies.
5. Conclusions
In summary, our study in an urban immigrant sub-population identified potential adverse 
birth outcomes in humans, such as reductions in birth weight, gestational age at birth and 
body length, as well as LBW and PTB. Such effects on reproduction were observed 
previously only in animal models after considerable dosing. The Endocrine Society 
summarizes the impact of EDCs on developmental outcomes, with an emphasis on further 
need for focus on effects in human epidemiological studies [35]. Similarly, the International 
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics emphasizes the need for better understanding 
reproductive health impacts from exposure to toxic environmental chemicals, particularly 
EDCs [36]. Our study found in humans, adverse effect associations that are consistent with 
those observed previously in tissue and animal models and human studies. Results challenge 
a continuation of investigations into reproductive effects and birth outcomes associated with 
exposure to ingredients of common consumer products of endocrine-disrupting potential.

aModel covariates considered included: maternal nativity, age, alcohol use, tobacco use, and neonate gender. Final model covariates included: Birth 
weight = neonate gender, Gestational age at delivery=maternal age group, Length at birth = neonate gender, Head circumference = neonate gender.
bMulti-pollutant models included TCS, TCC and BuPB. TCC was not included when modeling for TCC metabolites. BuPB was not included when 
modeling for any of the other parabens.
