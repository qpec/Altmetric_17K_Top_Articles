In Brief
Employing high-throughput phenotypic
screening, Nie et al. identify a retinoid X
receptor agonist, bexarotene, as a hit
compound that reprograms myoblasts
into brown adipocytes. This
reprograming requires a transcription
coregulator, PRDM16, and the browning
capacity of bexarotene was verified in
mice. Overall, these insights point to the
role of RXRs as master regulators of
brown and beige fat development and
activation and open a potential strategy
for therapeutic manipulation of brown/
beige fat function.

SUMMARY
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has attracted consider-
able research interest because of its therapeutic
potential to treat obesity and associated metabolic
diseases. Augmentation of brown fat mass and/or
its function may represent an attractive strategy to
enhance energy expenditure. Using high-throughput
phenotypic screening to induce brown adipocyte
reprogramming in committed myoblasts, we identi-
fied a retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist, bexarotene
(Bex), that efficiently converted myoblasts into
brown adipocyte-like cells. Bex-treated mice ex-
hibited enlarged BAT mass, enhanced BAT function,
and a modest browning effect in subcutaneous white
adipose tissue (WAT). Expression analysis showed
that Bex initiated several ‘‘browning’’ pathways at
an early stage during brown adipocyte reprogram-
ming. Our findings suggest RXRs as new master reg-
ulators that control brown and beige fat development
and activation, unlike the common adipogenic regu-
lator PPARg. Moreover, we demonstrated that selec-
tive RXR activation may potentially offer a therapeu-
tic approach to manipulate brown/beige fat function
in vivo.
INTRODUCTION
Reprogramming of one cell type into another that does not fall
into the downstream differentiated lineages by defined genetic
factors has attracted enormous interest for biomedical research
and potential therapeutic applications. Although ex vivo reprog-
ramming could provide desired cells for cell-based therapy,
in vivo reprogramming of endogenous cells may represent an
alternative and perhaps desirable strategy for modifying dis-
eases. For example, functional b cells (Zhou et al., 2008), cardi-
omyocytes (Jayawardena et al., 2012; Qian et al., 2012), and
neurons (Torper et al., 2013) have been generated in situ via re-
programming of endogenous relevant cell types by ectopic
expression of transcription factors and microRNAs. In contrast,
in vivo reprogramming by small molecules would mitigate issues
associated with gene therapy.
We set out to investigate whether brown adipocyte-like cells
could be generated from the non-brown adipose tissue (BAT)
lineage via a small-molecule reprogramming strategy. White ad-
ipose tissue (WAT) and BAT exhibit opposite functions in whole-
body energy homeostasis. Although white adipocytes function
as energy storage depots, brown adipocytes are specialized in
dissipating energy in the form of heat through uncoupled respi-
ration (Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004). Brown adipocyte-like
cells can be induced under different conditions and originate
from different precursor cell types (Hanssen et al., 2016; Rosen
and Spiegelman, 2014; Sanchez-Gurmaches et al., 2012). The
classic interscapular BAT shares the same precursor with skel-
etal myoblasts based on transcription profile (Timmons et al.,
2007). It was subsequently revealed the transcription factor
PRDM16 is a master BAT regulator and could convert skeletal
myoblasts into BAT-like adipocytes (Seale et al., 2008). In
contrast, brown-like adipocytes in WAT induced by b-adrenergic
stimulation or cold exposure originate from a distinct lineage
similar to mesenchymal precursor cells, which are much closer
to white adipocytes and display a unique set of molecular signa-
tures (Guerra et al., 1998). More recently, this type of energy-
burning but genetically distinct fat cell—beige cell (or ‘‘brite’’ or
‘‘recruited’’ cell)—was characterized in mice and adult humans
(Cypess et al., 2013; Lidell et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2012). Interest-
ingly, it was reported that some beige adipocytes come from
smooth muscle-like precursor cells (Long et al., 2014).
The finding that adult humans have a significant amount
of BAT inversely correlated with body mass index has fueled

 considerable interest in the therapeutic potential of brown adipo-
cytes (Cypess et al., 2009; van Marken Lichtenbelt et al., 2009;
Virtanen et al., 2009). A small amount of BAT (i.e., 50 g) was esti-
mated to be sufficient to increase a person’s energy metabolism
by 20%, which would be equivalent to a reduction of body weight
by 4–20 kg over 1 year (Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014; Tseng
et al., 2010). Activation of BAT was reported to reduce elevated
triglyceride concentrations and alleviate obesity in humans (Bar-
telt et al., 2011). Furthermore, BAT transplantation efficiently
decreased body weight and improved glucose homeostasis
and insulin sensitivity in both chow- and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed
mice (Liu et al., 2013; Min et al., 2016; Stanford et al., 2013).
Consequently, a better understanding and improved ability to
pharmacologically control BAT identity and function may provide
a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obesity and
related disorders.
Unlike genetic manipulation, which may cause mutations, in-
duction of BAT mass/activity by small molecules likely repre-
sents a safer approach to benefit overall metabolism. To this
end, we carried out high-throughput phenotypic screening for
induced brown adipocyte reprogramming in committed myo-
blasts and identified bexarotene (hereafter referred to as Bex),
a specific retinoid X receptor (RXR) agonist (Boehm et al.,
1995), as a potent and specific small molecule for reprogram-
ming of myoblasts into brown adipocyte-like cells. Bex selec-
tively induced BAT identity/features in multiple cell types while
inhibiting WAT differentiation. Bex-treated mice had more BAT
mass, enhanced metabolic function, and constrained body
weight gain compared with control mice. Further mechanistic
studies established RXRa and RXRg as new master regulators
of BAT development that act upstream of PRDM16 and other
browning genes to instate BAT identity.
RESULTS
Bex Selectively Promotes Brown Adipogenesis but
Inhibits White Adipogenesis
Toidentifysmall molecules that mimic overexpressionof PRDM16
to induce brown adipocyte reprogramming in non-brown pre-
adipocyte cells, high-throughput phenotypic screening of 20,000
compounds was performed in committed skeletal myoblasts
(C2C12 cells) for brown adipogenic induction with oil red O stain-
ing as a readout (Figure 1A). Under basal conditions (BCs), no
adipocyte-like cells could be induced from C2C12 myoblasts. In
contrast, several hit compounds, including Bex, could induce adi-
pogenesis in C2C12 cells. Given the previous finding that RXR has
a role in UCP1 induction in brown adipocytes (Alvarez et al., 2000),
we focused our studies on examining whether and how Bex/RXR
could induce brown adipocyte reprogramming in non-brown pre-
adipocyte cells. Further experiments confirmed that treatment
with Bex (10 mM) for 2 days potently initiated adipogenic
reprogramming in C2C12 cells (Figure 1B). Interestingly, although
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor g (PPARg) agonists
(rosiglitazone/Rosig) typically exhibiting browning effects could
enhance brown adipocyte reprogramming induced by Bex, rosi-
glitazone itself could not induce any adipogenic phenotype in
C2C12 myoblasts (Figure S1A), suggesting that Bex is a more
powerful browning inducer.
Gene expression analysis showed that Bex also induced
Pparg
expression
and
brown
adipocyte-specific
genes,
including Prdm16, Pgc1a, and Ucp1 (Figure 1C). Immunofluo-
rescence staining confirmed that UCP1 protein was significantly
induced by Bex in reprogrammed adipocytes from C2C12 cells
(Figure 1D). To further establish the specificity of brown reprog-
ramming induced by Bex, we also examined the effects of Bex
and an RXR antagonist (HX531) on white pre-adipocytes and
brown pre-adipocytes. Remarkably, Bex inhibited white adipo-
genic differentiation in white pre-adipocytes (3T3-L1) and
mesenchymal precursor cells (C3H10T1/2) under strong adipo-
genic induction conditions; HX531 promoted white adipogenic
differentiation from both cell types (Figure S1B). In contrast,
Bex promoted brown adipogenic differentiation in pre-adipocyte
cells, and HX531 inhibited both basal and Bex-induced brown
adipogenic differentiation in pre-BAT cells (Figure S1B). These
results collectively suggest that Bex (and RXR agonism) exhibit
a specific brown adipocyte-like reprogramming effect.
Bex Induces Brown Adipogenic Reprogramming via
Activation of RXRa and RXRg
Bex was originally developed as a selective RXR agonist without
RXR subtype specificity (Boehm et al., 1995). To further charac-
terize the mechanism by which Bex induces brown adipogenic

 reprogramming, we first examined whether RXR and its sub-
types (Mangelsdorf et al., 1992) were required for Bex function.
It was found that selective RXR antagonist HX531 or knockdown
of Rxrs by specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting Rxra,
Rxrb and Rxrg individually could almost completely abolish
Bex-induced brown adipogenic reprogramming in C2C12 myo-
blasts (Figures 2A and 2B; Figure S2A). These results established
that the effect of Bex is dependent on RXR agonism.
To further characterize the role of RXR subtypes, Rxra, b, and
g were individually overexpressed in C2C12 cells. Rxra, b, or g
overexpression alone was not sufficient to induce adipogenic re-
programming in C2C12 cells. However, treatment with Bex for
2 days in conjunction with Rxra or Rxrg overexpression induced
nearly all cells into brown adipocyte-like cells with multilocular
lipid droplets (Figure 2C; Figure S2B), although Bex treatment
with Rxrb overexpression only slightly increased efficiency of
brown adipogenic reprogramming (Figure 2C). Gene expression
analysis demonstrated that these reprogrammed cells ex-
pressed typical BAT genes at levels comparable with those in
differentiated brown adipocytes, including the general adipo-
genic genes Pparg and adiponectin (Figure 2D), and BAT-spe-
cific genes, including Ucp1, Prdm16, Ppara, Ppard, Cox7a1,
and Cox8b (Figure 2E). Consistently, immunofluorescence stain-
ing against UCP1 confirmed its significant protein induction in
those reprogrammed cells (Figure 2F). On the other hand,
myogenic genes, including Myf5, MyoD, and MyoG, and the
late myogenic marker Mhcb were dramatically downregulated
in these cells (Figure S2C). Furthermore, similar brown adipo-
genic induction was observed in primary committed myoblasts
that were treated with Bex and Rxr overexpression (Figure 2G;
Figure S2D), indicating that the effect of Bex is not cell line-
dependent. We found that various types of WAT cells all express
much higher levels of Rxrb than Rxra and Rxrg. Interestingly, BAT
and skeletal muscle express a similar level of Rxrb as WAT but
much higher levels of Rxra and Rxrg than WATs (Figure 2H).
Moreover, robust brown adipogenic induction could also be
achieved in mesenchymal precursor cells that were treated
with Bex and RXR overexpression (Figure S2E). Consistently,
Bex/RXRa and Bex/RXRg suppressed WAT-specific genes,
such as resistin (Retn), resistin-like alpha (retnla), and phospho-
serine aminotransferase 1 (Psat1) (Figure S2F), in C3H10T1/2
cells undergoing adipogenic induction, whereas they induced
BAT-characteristic small multilocular lipid droplets (Figure S2E)
and BAT-specific genes, including Ucp1, Prdm16, Ppara,
Pgc1a, Cox7a1, and Cox8b (Figure S2G). Bex alone can induce
UCP1 protein in C3H10T1/2 cells (Figure S2H). Taken together,
these results suggest that Rxra/g activation is required and suf-
ficient for brown adipogenic induction in committed myoblasts
and mesenchymal precursor cells that normally do not commit
toward the brown adipogenic lineage.
Bex and RXR-Mediated Brown Adipogenic Induction Is
Partially Dependent on PRDM16
PRDM16 was previously shown to be a master brown adipo-
genic regulator, and its overexpression can induce browning in
C2C12 myoblasts. To delineate the RXR mechanism in relation
to PRDM16 in brown adipogenic induction, we first examined
the gene expression changes of Prdm16 during the Bex/RXR-
induced brown adipogenic reprogramming process. Interest-
ingly, Bex induced Prdm16 expression and dramatically induced
Ucp1 in RXRa-overexpressed C2C12 cells at an early stage
before exhibiting typical adipogenic phenotypes (Figure 3A).
Both Rxra and Rxrg significantly induced Prdm16 and Ucp1
expression after Bex stimulation for 2 days, but Rxrb only
increased Ucp1 expression. However, overexpression of Pparg2
itself or plus rosiglitazone did not induce Prdm16 and Ucp1
expression (Figure 3B). This result indicates that Bex-RXRa/g
may act upstream of Prdm16. Interestingly, knockdown of
Prdm16 by shRNA only partially decreased Bex and Bex/RXR-
induced brown adipogenic reprogramming of C2C12 cells (Fig-
ure 3C) (the efficiency of Prdm16 knockdown in pre-brown
adipocyte is approximately 70%; Figure S3A), suggesting that
additional RXR downstream effectors mediate brown adipo-
genic induction. Consistently, Bex was shown to potentiate
Prdm16 overexpression-induced Ucp1 expression 4-fold in pri-
mary committed myoblasts (Figure 3D). Furthermore, Bex treat-
ment of Prdm16-overexpressing myoblasts generated brown
adipocyte-like cells with much smaller lipid droplets (i.e., more
BAT-like) than those in cells with Prdm16 overexpression alone
(Figure 3D), suggesting that the downstream mechanism of
Bex/RXR is not solely dependent on PRDM16. It was previously
shown that neither Prdm16 overexpression in white pre-adipo-
cytes nor Prdm16 knockdown in brown pre-adipocytes under
adipogenic induction could affect the adipogenesis phenotype
(Seale et al., 2007). In contrast, RXR agonism acts upstream of
Prdm16 and clearly functions as a more powerful master regu-
lator on inducing brown adipogenic phenotypes.
To further confirm the role of Prdm16 in the Bex/RXR-induced
brown adipogenic process, we used clustered regularly inter-
spaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 gene-editing
technique to completely knock out Prdm16 in C3H10T1/2 cells
(Figure S3B). In Prdm16 knockout cells, Bex-induced Ucp1,
Cox7a1, and Ppara expression was significantly but incom-
pletely abolished (Figure 3E). Knockout of Prdm16 had no signif-
icant effect on the expression of Fabp4 (also known as aP2), sug-
gesting that it has no key role in adipogenesis. However, Pgc1a
was completely abolished by Prdm16 knockout (Figure 3E).
These results suggest that brown adipocyte reprogramming
induced by Bex/RXR is not completely dependent on Prdm16.
Bex Initiates ‘‘Browning’’ Pathways at an Early Stage of
Adipogenesis in C2C12 Cells
To further dissect the transcriptional mechanism downstream of
Bex/RXR, we performed transcriptome analysis of Bex treat-
ment at the early stage of brown adipogenic reprogramming in
C2C12 cells (i.e., 2 days of Bex treatment) using a microarray
(Figure 4A). Gene ontology (GO) functional analysis revealed
that the genes upregulated by Bex were significantly enriched
in lipid biogenesis and brown fat cell specification (Figure 4B;
cutoff of Benjamini value is < 0.01). Interestingly, there was no
significant GO function enrichment in genes downregulated
genes (Figure S4). To identify the minimal non-redundant set of
pathways involved in this process, these changed genes were
further analyzed by GO-Elite and visualized by Cytoscape (Shan-
non et al., 2003). Most pathways induced by Bex were implicated
in adipocyte development, including adipogenesis, the PPAR

 pathway, synthesis of triacylglyceride, the statin pathway, retinol
metabolism, fatty acid biogenesis pathways, cholesterol bio-
synthesis, and mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid b-oxidation
(Figure 4C).
By qPCR confirmation, Bex significantly increased expression
of the general adipogenesis genes, including Pparg, Fabp4,
and CD36, and some downstream targets of RXR/PPARg (e.g.,
Pex11a, Angptl4, and HK2) (Nielsen et al., 2008). In addition,
Bex treatment increased the expression of genes with a known
browning effect, such as Fgf21, Pgc1a, Acsl1, Tbx15, Ptgs2,
and G0S2 (Figure 4D). Fgf21 has a physiological role in thermo-
genesis of WATs. Fgf21 knockout mice displayed an impaired
ability to adapt to chronic cold exposure with diminished brown-
ing of WAT (Fisher et al., 2012). Pgc1a is a key regulator of mito-
chondrial biogenesis and function and is essential for BAT func-
tion (Lin et al., 2004; Ventura-Clapier et al., 2008). Acsl1 is
responsible for mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid b-oxidation
and required for cold thermogenesis (Ellis et al., 2010). Tbx15
is essential for brown and beige, but not white, adipocyte differ-
entiation (Gburcik et al., 2012). Moreover, white adipogenic dif-
ferentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes was impaired by Tbx15
overexpression (Gesta et al., 2011). Overexpression of Ptgs2
(also known as Cox-2) in WAT induced de novo browning
recruitment in WAT, increased systemic energy expenditure,
and protected mice against high-fat diet-induced obesity (Mad-
sen et al., 2010; Vegiopoulos et al., 2010). G0S2 (G0/G1 switch
gene 2) expression was also induced, and its expression nega-
tively correlates with the development of obesity (Yang et al.,
2010). On the other hand, Bex repressed some white adipogen-
esis-associated genes, such as Bmp4 and Egr2 (also known as

 krox20) (Figure 4D). Bmp4 specifically promotes white adipo-
genic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells and even lowers the
Ucp1 level in brown pre-adipocytes (Boehm et al., 1995; Tseng
et al., 2008). The transcription factor Egr2 was reported to be
essential for 3T3-L1 differentiation via activation of the transcrip-
tional activator of C/EBPb. Conversely, knockdown of Egr2 in-
hibited white adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells (Chen
et al., 2005). These data provide a map of the molecular pathway
for brown adipogenic induction in C2C12 cells, and support Bex/
RXR as a master regulator of BAT/beige specification by modu-
lating a spectrum of adipogenic pathways with a specificity of
inducing brown-selective genes while suppressing white-selec-
tive genes.
Bex Increases BAT Mass and Function In Vivo
Given the specific and remarkable brown adipogenic activity
of Bex in vitro and the existence of relevant cell types in vivo,
we next examined whether this reprogramming activity would
have any corresponding effect in mice. Bex at 50 mg/kg/day
was orally administered to mice for 4 weeks along with a high-
fat diet. Despite similar food intake (Figure S5A), Bex-treated
mice displayed less gain of body weight (Figure 5A) than control
mice, suggesting that Bex likely increases energy expenditure in
mice. To test this possibility, we carried out indirect calorimetry
with these mice. Bex-treated mice consumed more oxygen (Fig-
ure 5B) and expended significantly more total energy, as quanti-
fied by heat generation, than the saline-treated group (Figure 5C)

without change in physical activity (Fig-
ure S5B). Consistent with this result,
mice treated with Bex showed a higher
rectal
temperature
than
control
mice
when challenged with 6�C temperature
(Figure 5D), which suggests that Bex-
treated mice are more cold tolerant. In
addition, to examine whether Bex influ-
ences the sympathetic
drive, oxygen
consumption in response to CL316,243
(1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.] injection)
was
compared
between
control
and
Bex-treated
mice.
Bex-treated
mice
showed much higher O2 consumption
than control mice upon administration of CL316,243 (Figures
S5C and S5D). These data indicate that Bex boosts energy
expenditure in vivo. Furthermore, the Bex-treated mice showed
improved sensitivity to glucose and insulin challenge (Figure 5E).
Body composition analysis showed that Bex-treated mice
had less fat mass than control mice (Figure 5F). The masses
of various fat depots were also examined at the end of the
experiment. Interscapular BAT mass (in both the absolute tis-
sue weight and its proportion to body weight) was increased
significantly in Bex-treated mice compared with control mice
(Figures 5G and 5H). Furthermore, qPCR analysis showed a
striking augmentation of thermogenic gene expression in BAT
from Bex-treated mice compared with control mice, including
increased Ucp1, Pgc1a, Prdm16, Ppara, Pparg, and Ppard
levels (Figure 5I). A significant browning effect in subcutane-
ous/inguinal WAT (subWAT) was also demonstrated because
Ucp1, Pgc1a, Prdm16, Ppara, and Ppard were dramatically
induced, and Pparg was repressed. However, there was no sig-
nificant change in epididymal WAT (epiWAT) and retroperito-
neal WAT (periWAT) (Figure 5I). Consistent with microarray
data in vitro, some browning-related genes, such as Fgf21,
Tbx15, and Ptgs2, were increased, but Egr2 and Bmp4 were
repressed, by Bex in BAT. Only Fgf21 was significantly
increased, and Egr2 was repressed in subWAT (Figure 5I).
UCP1 immunostaining showed more UCP1 signal in BAT and
subWAT (Figure 5J). Furthermore, H&E staining showed much
smaller lipid droplets in BAT and subWAT from Bex-treated

 mice than from control mice, suggesting that the enlarged BAT
mass was due to increased brown adipocyte cell number (Fig-
ure S5E). H&E staining and gene expression showed that Bex
had no significant effect on skeletal muscle (Figure S5F) and
liver (Figure S5G). To check whether Bex had a direct thermo-
genic induction effect in mature adipocytes, we tested the ef-
fect of Bex in mature adipocytes differentiated from primary
precursors. Stimulation of Bex for 24 hr induced Ucp1 expres-
sion in mature BAT and subWAT but not in epiWAT (Figure S5H).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that Bex exhibits a
browning effect in BAT and subWAT against HFD-induced phe-
notypes in mice.
DISCUSSION
The rising prevalence of metabolic diseases such as obesity and
diabetes has become a major public health concern. Recently,
brown fat biology has been gaining interest because BAT medi-
ated thermogenesis was proposed as a mechanism to treat
obesity and insulin resistance. From high-throughput pheno-
typic screening, we identified that the specific RXR agonist
Bex has the capacity to induce reprogramming of committed
myoblasts into BAT-like adipocytes. Our studies revealed that
Bex/RXR have opposing roles in WAT versus BAT induction
in vitro. In a panel of cell types, including committed myoblast
cells, white pre-adipocytes, mesenchymal precursor cells, and
brown pre-adipocytes, Bex inhibited white adipogenesis and
induced brown adipogenic specification, suggesting that it spe-
cifically endows brown adipogenic phenotypes to relevant cells.
In vivo data also showed that Bex enhances metabolism by
increasing BAT mass/function and inducing a browning effect
in subWAT.
Interestingly, a recent study revealed that adipocyte-specific
Prdm16 knockout mice using an adiponectin-Cre do not exhibit
different interscapular BAT mass and function than wild-type
mice (Cohen et al., 2014), suggesting that PRDM16 plays a crit-
ical role during development to orchestrate BAT rather than to
execute BAT functionality. Indeed, PRDM16 was found to be
essential for beige cell induction, where new sets of browning ar-
senals need to be implemented. However, another report found
that PRDM16 is dispensable for embryonic BAT development
because lineage ablation of Prdm16 using a myf5-Cre leaves
BAT more or less intact, whereas it causes upregulation of white
fat cell-selective genes in adult mice (Harms et al., 2014). These
studies hint that other transcription factors, in addition to
PRDM16, may play a more deterministic role during classic
BAT development. This expression profile of RXRs appears to
correlate with the determinant role of Rxra and Rxrg rather
than Rxrb in BAT specification. This may also indicate that selec-
tive regulation of Rxr subtypes might provide specificity to target
specific cell types for modulating metabolism.
The nuclear receptor PPARg has been regarded as a ‘‘master’’
regulator of fat cell development and function. More recently,
it was revealed that certain PPARg agonists, such as rosiglita-
zone, have browning effects in WAT, possibly by stabilizing the
PRDM16 protein level (Ohno et al., 2012). Our expression anal-
ysis also demonstrated that PPAR pathways were induced by
Bex/RXR. Interestingly, in contrast to the ability of Bex to induce
brown adipogenic reprogramming of C2C12 cells, our data and
other published results show that rosiglitazone could not induce
adipogenic specification in myoblast cells (Seale et al., 2008).
Furthermore, although Pparg overexpression could drive adipo-
genesis, it does not induce the brown adipogenic gene program
in myoblast cells (Seale et al., 2008). This suggests that Bex/RXR
acts upstream of the PPAR pathway and that it has additional
downstream effectors to initiate the browning process. Indeed,
we found that PRDM16, the master regulator of BAT develop-
ment, is also induced by Bex/RXR. It has been shown that
PPARg and PRDM16 form a complex to regulate downstream
browning cascades (Seale et al., 2008). A recent study revealed
that EBF2 is another BAT determinant. In addition, RXRa poten-
tiates the binding of EBF2-PPARg on the Prdm16 promoter and,
thus, directly activates Prdm16 transcription (Rajakumari et al.,
2013). It is now recognized that PPARg has a common and
distinct binding pattern in different WATs and BAT to define
adipocyte types (Rajakumari et al., 2013; Siersbæk et al.,
2012). RXR might be a druggable target to change the PPARg
chromatin binding pattern to activate browning genes while re-
pressing WAT programs.
UCP1 plays a key role in the thermogenic regulation of
body weight. Increased content of UCP1 in adipose tissue
is strongly linked to protection against diet-induced obesity.
Our in vivo data demonstrated efficient induction of Ucp1
and other thermogenic genes by Bex, with higher metabolic
activity and less weight gain. More interestingly, Bex increased
BAT mass significantly, probably by promoting de novo BAT
induction from progenitor cells because the BAT mass was
not due to enlargement of brown adipocytes. These data re-
vealed a dual function of the RXR pathway: regulating BAT
function and controlling BAT mass. Furthermore, there is also
a significant increase in UCP1 in subWAT from Bex-treated
mice than from control mice but not in epiWAT. However,
it is difficult to quantify the thermogenesis contribution of
increased BAT mass and direct thermogenesis induction in
mature BAT and subWAT. In line with the augmented expres-
sion of Ucp1 in Bex-treated mice, these mice exhibited
enhanced cold tolerance in the cold challenge and higher O2
consumption upon acute CL316,243 stimulation. However, it
should be noted that, in a cold tolerance experiment, the meta-
bolic energy output is contributed from both non-shivering
thermogenesis of BAT and shivering thermogenesis of skeletal
muscles, whereas measuring the response to sympathetic ner-
vous system activation in awake animals tends to show higher
inter-animal variability (Cannon and Nedergaard, 2011). Thus,
norepinephrine injection in anesthetized mice warrants future
investigation to evaluate the effect of Bex on the thermogenic
capacity of BAT.
In conclusion, our data revealed that Bex/RXR functions as a
master regulator to control Pparg and Prdm16 expression and
other downstream pathways with a browning effect, including
Fgf21, Pgc1a, and Tbx15. Our studies shed new light on the
retinoid pathway in BAT/beige specification and function and
demonstrate that energy metabolism can be enhanced by a
small molecule via increasing BAT mass and function. Many
unanswered questions remain, relating to how RXRs precisely
control adipogenic subtype specification in development, tissue

 homeostasis, and disease, that would warrant subsequent
studies.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Culture
C2C12, 3T3-L1, and C3H10T1/2 cells were purchased from the ATCC.
Immortalized brown pre-adipocytes were kindly donated by Prof. C. Ronald
Kahn (Harvard University). Primary myoblasts were purified from mouse
limb muscles and cultured in growth medium (F10 + 20% fetal bovine serum
[FBS] + 5 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor [bFGF]) in Matrigel-coated
plates. Adipocyte differentiation was induced by treating cells for 2 days
under basal adipogenesis conditions (850 nM insulin, 1 nM T3, 0.5 mM iso-
buylmethylxanthine, 125 mM indomethacin, and 5 mM dexamethasone in
10% FBS DMEM) (Seale et al., 2008). Then cells were switched to 10%
FBS DMEM containing 850 nM insulin and 1 nM T3 only for another
4–6 days. To stimulate thermogenesis, cells were stimulated with 10 mM for-
skolin for 4 hr.
Adipogenesis Screening in C2C12 Cells
C2C12 cells were plated at 3,000 cells/well onto 384-well plates using a liquid
distributor (BioTek Instruments Elx405). When cells reached confluency, the
medium was changed to basal adipogenesis medium, and compounds were
delivered from a chemical library using the Biomek FXP 2000 machine (a lab-
oratory automation workstation). After 2 days of incubation, the medium was
changed to 10% FBS DMEM containing 850 nM insulin and 1 nM T3 only for
another 4 days, and then the cells were fixed and stained for oil red O. We
screened about 20,000 chemicals from the NIH library, Sigma LOPAC1280 li-
brary, ENZO fatty acid library (BML-2803), Bioactive lipid library (BML-2800),
and S.D. lab in-house libraries.
Preparation of Mouse Primary Myoblasts Derived from Satellite
Cells
Primary myoblasts were purified from 4-week-old C57BL/6J mice as
described previously (Xiao et al., 2011). The limb muscles were dissected
out and rinsed in ice-cold PBS. The muscles were cut into fine pieces using
scissors, and the minced tissue was vigorously mixed and spun at
1,300 rpm for 4 min. The minced tissue pellet was then resuspended in
10 mL DMEM and 1 mL of 1% pronase (to a final concentration of 0.1%)
and incubated at 37�C with continuous shaking for 1.5 hr before being spun
down at 1,300 rpm for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in 5�10 mL
DMEM and triturated 15-20 times to loosen cells before being filtered through
a 100-mm cell strainer. The flow-through was collected, spun down, and resus-
pended in 10 mL of growth medium (F10 + 20% FBS + 5 ng/mL bFGF) in non-
coated plates to allow fibroblasts to attach for 60 min. The floating cells were
transferred to a plate coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences), and the growth
medium was changed every 36 hr.
Constructs and Chemicals
The mouse RXRa and RXRg plasmids were from Dr. Ronald Evans (Salk Insti-
tute), and the mouse RXRb plasmid was purchased from OriGene. These three
RXR fragments were subcloned into the pMXs retrovirus construct (Yamanaka
lab, Gladstone Institutes) via the EcoRI site. All constructs were sequenced for
verification. Non-target shRNA(shNT), shRXRa, shRXRb, and shRXRg lenti-
virus constructs were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Retrovirus PRDM16
(plasmid 15504) and PRDM16 shRNA (plasmid 15505) constructs were pur-
chased from Addgene. Retrovirus and lentivirus constructs were packaged
in Plat E and 293T cells, respectively. Bexarotene, HX531, and rosiglitazone
were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Tocris Bioscience, and
Sigma-Aldrich, respectively.
Real-Time PCR
Total RNA from cell lines was purified using a QIAGEN kit, and total RNA from
mouse tissues was extracted using Trizol. RNA concentration and quality
were measured by a NanoDrop spectrometer. Complementary DNA was
prepared from total RNA with the iScriptIII DNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad).
Quantitative PCR reactions containing SYBR-Green fluorescent dye were
performed using the ABI7900HT (Applied Biosystems) following the manufac-
turer’s protocols. Relative mRNA expression was determined by the DD-Ct
method with Gapdh as an endogenous control. Primer sequences are shown
in Table S1.
Immunofluorescence
After induction of adipogenesis in C2C12 cells and C3H10T1/2 cells with or
without Bex, cells were fixed with formaldehyde for 10 min, then washed with
PBS and penetrated with 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were incubated in
blocking buffer containing 3% BSA for 1 hr at room temperature. Samples
were then incubated with ab23841 at a 1:200 dilution for 1 hr in BSA/Tris-
buffered saline (TBS). Cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 555 secondary
antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 hr at room temperature, and nuclei were stained
with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired by a Zeiss Axioimager Z1
equipped with an Apotome system and processed using Zeiss Axiovision
software.
Affymetrix Microarray Analysis
Total RNA samples were purified from C2C12 cells after 2-day basal adipo-
genesis medium treatment without or with Bex (control [Ctrl] and Bex) with
the RNeasy mini plus kit from QIAGEN. Microarray analyses were performed
in duplicate from independent biologic samples according to the standard
Affymetrix Genechip protocol. Purified RNA was analyzed for quality using
chip-based capillary electrophoresis (Bioanalyzer, Agilent), and quantity
and purity were determined with a NanoDrop spectrometer. NuGEN Pico
V2, based on Ribo single prime isothermal amplification (Ribo-SPIA) technol-
ogy, was used for amplification, fragmentation, and biotin labeling. The
labeled cDNA was hybridized to mouse Gene 1.0 sense target (ST) microar-
rays (Affymetrix). The signal intensity fluorescent images produced during Af-
fymetrix gene chip hybridizations were read using the Affymetrix Model 3000
scanner and converted into GeneChip probe results files (Command and
Expression Console software [CEL]) using Command and Expression Con-
sole software (Affymetrix). Data were normalized and analyzed using Affyme-
trix Expression Console and Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC) software.
Arrays were normalized for array-specific effects using Affymetrix Robust
Multi-Array (RMA) normalization. A gene was regarded as significantly
changed when the p value was <0.05 and fold was >1.5 or <�1.5. Results
were deposited in GEO: GSE52364.The differential expression gene list
was further analyzed in The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Inte-
grated Discovery (DAVID) GO functional annotation and GO-Elite (Zambon
et al., 2012).
CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing
We designed two pairs of guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting Exon3 of mouse
Prdm16:gRNA1:95-gcccagctctacgagggcctagg-118, gRNA2(RC):155-gctgcc
cacgccaaggccctcgg-132. We subcloned gRNA into the LentiCRISPR lentiviral
CRISPR/Cas9 construct (Addgene). Prdm16 gRNA F1: 50-CAC CGg ccc agc
tct acg agg gcct-30; Prdm16 gRNA R1: AAA Cag gcc ctc gta gag ctg ggcC-30;
Prdm16 gRNA F2: 50-CAC CGg ctg ccc acg cca agg ccct-30; Prdm16 gRNA
R2: 50-AAA Cag ggc ctt ggc gtg ggc agcC-30. We followed the Lenti CRISPR
Lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 and Single Guide RNA Guide. Virus particles were
packaged in 293T cells. C3H10T1/2 cells were infected with the virus from
gRNA1 or gRNA2 and then selected with 1 mg/mL puromycin for two passages
before single-cell dilution. Single cells were expanded enough for the following
experiments. We amplified the fragment using this pair of PCR primers: for-
ward, 50-GAA GGA AGC TGG TTA GGA GTA G-30; reverse, 30-GGA CCA
GGA CCT TTA TGG TAA G-50. The amplicon was checked by PCR, and the
candidates were subcloned into TA-clone and then sequenced to verify the
frameshift knockout cell line. Our data showed that only gRNA2 works that
can generate the Prdm16 frameshift mutation.
Animal Work
C57BL/6J mice were fed, ad libitum, a standard laboratory chow diet (LabDiet
5053, LabDiet). Animals were housed under 12-hr light-dark cycles with a
controlled temperature (23�C ± 1�C). The body weight of 8-week-old male
mice (n = 14) was measured and randomly divided into two groups (n = 7
632
Cell Reports 18, 624–635, January 17, 2017
 in each group). The mice were treated with Bex (50 mg/kg/day) or saline by
daily oral gavage for 4 weeks and fed with an HFD (21.9 kJ/g, 60% of energy
from fat, 20% of energy from protein, 20% of energy from carbohydrates;
D12492; Research Diet). The food intake and body weight were monitored.
Minispec time domain magnetic resonance equipment (TD-NMR) analyzers
(Bruker Instruments) were used to evaluate body composition on anesthe-
tized animals. One day prior to the cold challenge, the holding cages were
prechilled at 6�C overnight. The next day, the mice were acutely shifted
from 22�C to 6�C with two mice in each cage. The rectal temperature was
examined by 4610 Precision Thermometer (Measurement Specialty) at
various time points. Alternatively, the mice were acclimated in Comprehen-
sive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS) for 3 days before CL316,243
(1 mg/kg body weight) was intraperitoneally injected. The oxygen consump-
tion was recorded for 3 hr afterward. When all functional assays were
finished, the mice were sacrificed, fat tissues were collected, and tissue
mass was measured. All collected tissues were stored in a �80�C degree
freezer or liquid nitrogen for further experiments. All animal experiments
were conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines for humane
treatment of laboratory animals of the University of Hong Kong (HKU) Animal
Care and Use Committee and University of California, San Francisco’s Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Indirect Calorimetry
Whole-body O2 consumption, CO2 production, heat generation, food intake,
and physical activity were measured using an open circuit indirect calorimetry
system with automatic temperature and light controls (Columbus Instru-
ments). Mice had access ad libitum to chow and water in respiration cham-
bers, and data were recorded for a 48-hr period before acclimatization for
24 hr.
Isolation and Differentiation of Adipocytes and Stromal Vascular
Cells from Adipose Tissues
Brown, inguinal, or epididymal adipose tissues were dissected from C57BL/6J
mice, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, minced, and digested for 40 min at
37�C in 0.1% (w/v) type I collagenase solution (Sigma) in D-Hank’s buffer. The
digested tissue was filtered through a 250-mm nylon mesh and centrifuged at
800 3 g for 3 min. The sediment was resuspended in DMEM (Gibco) with 10%
fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Two days after reaching confluence (day 0),
the cells were induced to differentiate into adipocytes in medium containing
5 mg/ml insulin (Sigma), 1 mM dexamethasone (Sigma), 0.5 mM isobutylmethyl-
xanthine (Calbiochem), and 1 mM rosiglitazone (Sigma). Two days later, the
medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 5 mg/ml insulin, and 1 mM rosiglitazone, and the cells were cultured
for 6 days. The mature adipocytes were stimulated by Bex for 24 hr, and
then Ucp1 mRNA levels were examined by qPCR.
Histochemistry
Epididymal, inguinal, and retroperitoneal white and brown adipose tissues
were fixed in 4% formaldehyde overnight at room temperature immediately af-
ter sacrifice. Tissues were paraffinized and sectioned by microtome, and the
slides were stained with H&E (Sigma) following the standard protocol. Sections
were examined by light microscopy. Photomicrographs were scanned using
an Abaton Scan 300/Color scanner.
Statistical Analysis
Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as the mean ± SEM, and signifi-
cant differences were analyzed by two-tailed Student’s t tests. O2 consump-
tion, CO2 production, and heat generation data were analyzed by analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA), with body weight as covariant in accordance with a
recent publication (Himms-Hagen et al., 2000).
