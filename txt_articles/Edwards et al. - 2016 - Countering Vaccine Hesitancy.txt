abstract
Immunizations have led to a signifi
 cant decrease in rates of vaccine-
preventable diseases and have made a signifi
 cant impact on the health 
of children. However, some parents express concerns about vaccine 
safety and the necessity of vaccines. The concerns of parents range from 
hesitancy about some immunizations to refusal of all vaccines. This clinical 
report provides information about addressing parental concerns about 
vaccination.
CLINICAL REPORT
Guidance for the Clinician in Rendering Pediatric Care
INTRODUCTION
Immunizations have had an enormous impact on the health of children, 
and the prevention of disease by vaccination is one of the single greatest 
public health achievements of the last century. However, over the past 
decade acceptance of vaccines has been challenged by individuals and 
groups who question their benefit. 
1 Increasing numbers of people 
are requesting alternative vaccination schedules 
2, 
 
3 or postponing or 
declining vaccination. 
4 In a national telephone survey of 1500 parents of 
children 6 to 23 months of age conducted in 2010 with a response rate 
of 46%, approximately 3% of respondents had refused all vaccines and 
19.4% had refused or delayed at least 1 of the recommended childhood 
vaccines.5 A study conducted in a metropolitan area of Oregon reported 
that rates of alternative immunization schedule usage have increased 
nearly fourfold in recent years, 
 
3 and in some parts of the country the use 
of “personal belief exemptions” from vaccinations has grown to rates in 
excess of 5% of the school-aged population. 
6
The Periodic Survey of Fellows (PS#66) conducted by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2006 revealed that 75% of pediatricians 
surveyed had encountered parents who refused a vaccine, 
 
7 and a 
follow-up survey in 2013 (PS#84) revealed that this figure had increased 
to 87% of pediatricians. 
8 According to the survey, pediatricians stated 
that the proportion of parents who refused 1 or more vaccines increased 
from 9.1% to 16.7% during the 7-year interval between surveys. 
7, 
 
8 
Physicians stated that the most common reasons parents refused 
vaccines were that they believed that vaccines are unnecessary (which 
showed an increase over the 7-year span) and that they had concerns

about autism (which declined 
between survey years). In both 2006 
and 2013, pediatricians reported 
that they were able to convince 
approximately 30% of parents 
to vaccinate their children when 
they initially refused. Another 
observational study found that when 
physicians continued to engage 
parents, up to 47% of parents 
ultimately accepted vaccines after 
initially refusing them.9 Although the 
majority of parents accept vaccines, 
the increasing frequency of refusal 
and the requests for alternative 
vaccine schedules indicate that 
there are still significant barriers to 
overcome.

TERMINOLOGY
The term vaccine hesitancy has 
emerged to depolarize the “pro” 
versus “anti” vaccination alignment 
and to express the spectrum 
of parental attitudes toward 
vaccines. 
1 Vaccine hesitancy has 
been characterized recently by a 
committee at the World Health 
Organization as “a behavior, 
influenced by a number of factors 
including issues of confidence (do 
not trust a vaccine or a provider), 
complacency (do not perceive a need 
for a vaccine or do not value the 
vaccine), and convenience (access).” 
11 
Vaccine-hesitant individuals are 
a heterogeneous group who hold 
varying degrees of indecision 
about specific vaccines or about 
vaccinations in general. Vaccine-
hesitant individuals may accept 
all vaccines but remain concerned 
about them, they may refuse or delay 
some vaccines but accept others, or 
they may refuse all vaccines. The 
latter group refusing all vaccines is 
estimated at approximately 3% of 
parents, although the prevalence 
may vary geographically. 
4, 
 
12, 
13 
The concept that parental vaccine 
hesitancy is a spectrum has been 
confirmed in several studies 
4, 
 
14, 
 
15 and 
was well described in a recent review 
by Leask et al 
12 (Table 1). Some 
parents who totally refuse vaccines 
may be fixed and unswayable in their 
beliefs and may not respond to the 
pediatrician attempting to change 
their views. The AAP recommends 
that pediatricians continue to engage 
with vaccine-hesitant parents, 
provide other health care services to 
their children, and attempt to modify 
their opposition to vaccines. 
16 
– 
18 
Fortunately, most vaccine-hesitant 
parents are responsive to vaccine 
information, consider vaccinating 
their children, and are not opposed to 
all vaccines. Responding to vaccine-
hesitant parents is the focus of this 
clinical report.
VACCINES ARE TESTED THOROUGHLY
Vaccine development is a long 
and arduous process, often lasting 
many years and involving a 
combination of public and private 
partnerships. The current system for 
developing, testing, and regulating 
vaccines requires that the vaccines 
demonstrate both safety and efficacy 
before licensure and that long-term 
safety is monitored (http://

vaccine- 
development- 
testing- 
and- 
regulation;  
Fig 1). 
The first step in vaccine discovery 
involves the identification of a 
need for a vaccine and an 
understanding of the mechanism 
of protective immunity against 
that disease.

Immunization advocate
Parents agree that vaccines are necessary and safe. Parents have a strong relationship with their health care provider.
Go along to get along
Parents do not question vaccines, would like to vaccinate their children, but may lack a detailed knowledge of vaccines.
Cautious acceptor
Parents may have minor concerns about vaccines but ultimately vaccinate their children.
Fence-sitter
Parents have signifi
 cant concerns about vaccines and tend to be knowledgeable about vaccines. Parents may vaccinate 
their child or may refuse or delay vaccines. Parents may have signifi
 cant concerns about vaccines and may have a 
neutral relationship with their health care provider.
Refuser
Parents refuse all vaccines for their child. Their reasons for refusal may include distrust in the medical system, safety 
concerns, and religious beliefs.

If the vaccine appears promising 
in preclinical studies, the vaccine 
sponsor submits an application for 
an Investigational New Drug to the 
US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA). Law requires that the sponsor 
describe the manufacturing and 
testing processes, summarize the 
laboratory reports, and describe the 
proposed studies to evaluate the 
vaccine. As with therapeutic drugs, 
vaccine evaluation includes phase 
I through phase III testing. Phase 
I trials are intended to assess the 
safety of the candidate vaccine and 
to determine the type and extent of 
immune response that the vaccine 
provokes.
Phase II testing involves several 
hundred volunteers, some of whom 
belong to groups at risk for acquiring 
the disease. These trials generally 
are randomized and controlled and 
usually include a placebo group or 
a standard licensed vaccine when a 
new vaccine for that disease is being 
tested.
Phase III vaccine trials are designed 
to determine whether the vaccine 
will prevent the disease in question 
and to assess the vaccine’s safety 
when administered to a large 
number of subjects. These studies 
often involve thousands or tens of 
thousands of participants, depending 
on the incidence of disease and 
the rates of adverse events to be 
detected. If these studies show the 
vaccine to be effective and safe, it is 
then licensed.
VACCINE SAFETY IS ACTIVELY 
MONITORED AFTER LICENSURE
Once vaccines are licensed, a 
number of processes are in place to 
ensure that the safety of vaccines 
is monitored. In 1990, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) and FDA established the 
Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting 
System (VAERS), a voluntary passive 
reporting system that serves as a 
signal detection system for adverse 
events associated with vaccines 
(http:// 
vaers. 
hhs. 
gov/ 
index). 
Anyone who suspects an association 
between a vaccination and an 
adverse event can report the event 
to VAERS. The CDC and the FDA 
then investigate the event. 
19 VAERS 
has successfully identified several 
adverse events related to vaccination 
in the past, such as intussusception 
after administration of the RotaShield 
(Wyeth Laboratories Inc, Marietta, 
PA) rotavirus vaccine, which was 
identified in 1999, leading to the 
ultimate withdrawal of that vaccine 
from the market. 
20
In 1990, the CDC also established 
the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) 
to monitor vaccine safety. The VSD 
is composed of a number of large 
health provider groups with linked 
databases with comprehensive 
information about vaccines 
administered and health care 
encounters. 
21 Because the VSD 
involves millions of individuals, it 
can be used to detect rare events and 
was used to study the possible, but 
subsequently disproven, association 
between Guillain–Barré syndrome 
and meningococcal vaccination. 
22 
Another parallel system to the 
VSD is the Post-Licensure Rapid 
Immunization Safety Monitoring 
system. 
23 This system uses health 
insurance claims data from 107 
million individuals to actively 
monitor vaccine safety. In addition, 
the CDC has also established the 
Clinical Immunization Safety 
Assessment Project, a group of 
academic health care centers, to 
address specific questions about 
vaccine safety from individual health 
care providers (http:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
vaccinesafety/ 
activities/ 
cisa. 
html). 
24
In summary, vaccines are 
comprehensively evaluated before 
their licensure. They are developed 
and tested in large numbers of 
subjects, regulated by the FDA, and 
carefully monitored after licensure 
through a comprehensive safety 
surveillance system funded by the 
CDC and the FDA. In rare instances in 
which safety concerns are identified, 
regulatory or other actions to 
safeguard public health are taken.
HISTORICAL VACCINE OPPOSITION
Before discussing the recent increase 
in vaccine hesitancy, it is valuable to 
recall that opposition to vaccination 
is not a new occurrence. In the early 
1800s in Europe, Jenner promoted 
vaccination against smallpox by 
using material obtained from 
cowpox lesions. 
25 However, over 
the next several decades, increasing 
rates of opposition to smallpox 
vaccination were seen in the United 
Kingdom, requiring vaccination to be 
mandated by law. 
25 Similar obstacles 
to universal smallpox vaccination 
were also encountered in the United 
States. In the 1850s, a number of 
parents and physicians challenged 
mandatory smallpox vaccination, 
and in 1905 in the case Jacobson 
v Massachusetts, 
 the US Supreme 
Court supported the rights of states 
to pass laws mandating smallpox 
vaccine. 
6 However, although vaccine 
hesitancy is not a new phenomenon, 
it may have a greater effect on 
public health today. With the ease of 
global travel, vaccine-preventable 
diseases are spread more quickly and 
may unexpectedly appear in areas 
where health care professionals 
are unfamiliar with their clinical 
presentation.
CURRENT VACCINE EXEMPTIONS
Herd immunity is a fundamental 
concept that contributes to the 
success of many vaccination 
programs. Control of many vaccine-
preventable diseases is contingent 
on a significant proportion of 
the population in a community 
being immune. 
26 Depending on 
the disease, the percentage of 
individuals required to achieve herd 
immunity in a community ranges 
from 30% to 95%. 
27 Traditionally, 
e3

immunization rates have been 
maintained in the United States 
through mandatory vaccination 
requirements for entry into and 
advancement through licensed child 
care centers and schools. However, 
recent years have seen a marked 
increase in the availability and use 
of “philosophical” or “personal 
belief” exemptions from vaccination. 
Over the period from 2005 through 
2011, Omer et al 
28 reported that the 
unadjusted rates for nonmedical 
exemptions in states that allowed 
for philosophical exemptions were 
2.5 times higher than in states that 
allowed only religious exemptions. 
In Arkansas, rates of overall 
exemptions increased an average 
of 23% per year once philosophical 
exemptions were allowed. 
29 Studies 
have demonstrated that parents 
who refuse vaccines are more likely to 
be white and more highly educated 
than those who do not.4, 
 
6, 
 
30, 
 
31 In 
addition, the prevalence of vaccine-
hesitant parents seems to vary 
geographically. 
6, 
32 It is unclear 
whether requiring a mandatory 
physician visit or educational 
module for parents who apply for 
vaccine exemption in states with 
philosophical exemptions is effective 
in reducing refusals. 
32
Children who are philosophically 
exempted from vaccination not only 
are at greater risk of developing 
vaccine-preventable disease but 
also put vaccinated children and 
medically exempt children who 
live in the same area at risk. 
33 
– 
35 
Vaccine-preventable diseases 
occurring in vaccinated children may 
result from waning immunity after 
immunization or may be attributable 
to an ineffective immune response 
to vaccine initially. In January 2015, 
a measles outbreak occurred in 
California, where an estimated 3.1% 
of kindergartners had a nonmedical 
exemption from receiving the 
measles–mumps–rubella (MMR) 
vaccine. 
36 The majority of cases 
occurred in children who either had 
not received measles vaccine (45%) 
or had unknown vaccination status 
(38%).37 Of the cases in unvaccinated 
children, 43% of parents cited 
philosophical or religious objects 
to vaccine. An additional 40% of 
unvaccinated children could not 
receive the vaccine because they 
were too young. This outbreak, 
which spread to multiple states, has 
sparked intense debate about vaccine 
exemptions and the government’s 
role in limiting nonmedical 
exemptions. Whether the 2015 
outbreak and legislation resulting 
from this outbreak will have a long-
lasting effect on public policy and 
parental choices is not clear at this 
time. For these reasons, we believe 
the better approach is to work to 
eliminate all nonmedical exemptions 
for childhood vaccines, a position that 
is shared by the American Medical 
Association and the Infectious 
Diseases Society of America and 
is currently the basis of a policy 
statement being developed by the 
AAP. There has also been greater 
recognition among pediatricians that 
delayed or incomplete vaccination 
schedules are probably responsible, 
at least in part, for the spread of 
measles in that outbreak. 
38 
– 
40 As 
a result, more pediatricians are 
becoming concerned about the 
risk unimmunized children pose 
to other children in their practices, 
both immunized children and those 
too young or otherwise unable to 
be immunized. Some are electing to 
dismiss families who refuse vaccines 
from their practices. 
7 The ethical 
considerations of patient dismissal 
are complex and are discussed in a 
subsequent section of this statement 
as well as in a comprehensive review 
by Diekema.41
FACTORS INVOLVED IN VACCINE 
ACCEPTANCE
The evolution of vaccine confidence 
over the course of vaccine 
introduction is summarized in 
a figure that first appeared in a 
1994 article by Chen et al 
19 ( 
Fig 2), 
which succinctly outlines many 
of the pivotal factors that must be 
considered when discussing vaccine 
hesitancy. As shown in  
Fig 2, disease 
incidence is highest before the 
development and implementation of 
a vaccine program. At this time, the 
public generally is eager to accept 
a new vaccine, particularly if the 
morbidity and mortality associated 
with the disease are considerable. 
Then, after the vaccine is developed 
and proven efficacious, individuals 
are eager to be vaccinated, and 
coverage increases, with subsequent 
declines in disease incidence 
(“increasing coverage” phase). 
However, as vaccine uptake peaks, 
the disease incidence declines, and 
the total number of adverse events 
after vaccination increases. Whether 
the adverse events were causally 
related or only temporally associated 
with vaccine administration can 
be difficult to determine, but these 
adverse events may lead to loss 
of confidence in the vaccine as 
the public perceives the risk of 
vaccination to outweigh the risk 
of disease (“loss of confidence” 
phase). This, in turn, may increase 
vaccine refusal and ultimately lead 
to disease resurgence. Then, after 
disease resurgence or an outbreak, 
as the public again appreciates 
the increasing burden of disease, 
vaccine acceptance is restored 
and vaccination rates increase 
(“resumption of confidence” phase). 
Unfortunately, a recent study during 
an outbreak of pertussis in the 
state of Washington suggested that, 
despite an increase in pertussis cases, 
parents did not have a “resumption 
in vaccine confidence” and did not 
increase pertussis vaccine uptake. 
42 
In the rare incidents in which 
disease is eradicated by vaccine, as 
occurred with smallpox, vaccination 
can stop (“eradication” phase). 
This conceptual framework is more 
applicable to diseases for which the 
time between exposure and infection 
is short, such as measles, pertussis,

or polio, and less relevant to, for 
example, vaccines against human 
papillomavirus (HPV), for which 
the benefits of immunization in 
preventing cancer may take years or 
decades to become apparent. Figure 
2 clearly highlights the delicate 
balance between perceived risk and 
benefit for each vaccine and how this 
balance is linked integrally to vaccine 
acceptance.
PARENTS’ VARIED CONCERNS ABOUT 
VACCINES SHOULD BE ADDRESSED
A number of studies have attempted 
to define the reasons why parents are 
vaccine hesitant, and these factors 
are summarized in  
Table 2. 
1, 
 
4, 
 
5, 
15, 
 
43 
– 
45 
In 1 study, 44% of parents reported 
concern over pain associated with 
receiving multiple injections during 
a single visit, 34% expressed unease 
about receiving too many vaccines 
at a single visit, 26% worried about 
the development of autism or other 
potential learning difficulties after 
receiving vaccines, 13.5% expressed 
concern that vaccines could lead to 
chronic illnesses, and 13.2% stated 
that vaccines were not tested enough 
for safety before their use. 
45 Concerns 
about vaccine safety and questions 
about the necessity of vaccines are 
often cited as reasons for vaccine 
refusal.43, 
 
46 
– 
48 One survey found that 
parents who decide to not vaccinate 
their children have a greater distrust 
of health care professionals and the 
government and are more likely to 
use complementary and alternative 
medicine, compared with parents 
who vaccinate their children. 
47 
Freed et al43 also conducted an 
online survey of several thousand 
parents to identify vaccine concerns. 
Most of the surveyed parents 
agreed that vaccines protected their 
children from diseases; however, 
more than half expressed concerns 
regarding serious adverse effects of 
vaccines. Overall, 11.5% of parents 
in that study had refused at least 1 
recommended vaccine, and the fear 
that vaccines could cause autism was 
often cited as a reason for refusal. 
43
Parental concerns must be addressed, 
and concerns will vary among 
parents. For example, vaccine safety 
and triggering early sexual activity 
are often cited as parental concerns 
about the HPV vaccine. 
49 Reassuring 
parents that the vaccine is safe and 
that there is no evidence that HPV 
vaccine increases sexual activity 
may dispel their concerns. 
50 Some 
parents are concerned primarily 
about the pain associated with 
immunizations. Strategies to reduce 
pain include administering vaccines 
quickly without aspirating, holding 
the child upright, administering 
the most painful vaccine last, and

providing tactile stimulation. 
51 
Breastfeeding, feeding sweet-tasting 
solutions, and topical anesthetics are 
other tools that can be used before 
vaccine administration to decrease 
pain. Distraction strategies, including 
pinwheels, deep breathing exercises, 
and toys, can be used in older 
children to decrease anxiety and 
pain. Although rigorously controlled 
studies of these techniques have not 
been performed, studies of other 
painful procedures lend support to 
their use in vaccination. 
51, 
52
Providers should address specific 
parental questions about the 
production and composition of the 
vaccines by directly providing the 
information requested. For example, 
for concerns about the presence of 
mercury (thimerosal) in vaccines, 
parents can be reassured that 
currently, none of the single-dose 
vaccine preparations given to infants 
contain any mercury. The opposition 
to the presence of aluminum as an 
adjuvant in some vaccines can be 
addressed by providing evidence for 
both the necessity of the aluminum 
for a vigorous immune response and 
the lack of evidence for its toxicity. 
The religious argument that vaccines 
contain cells derived from aborted 
human fetuses can be answered in 
statements from major religious 
denominations either acknowledging 
that the vaccines do not contain such 
cells or that the earlier use of fetal 
cell lines in vaccine production does 
not prohibit the use of these vaccines 
many years after the fetal cells were 
obtained. 
53
A specific response to the parental 
concern of “too many vaccines” and 
the potential for “overwhelming the 
immune system” was provided by 
Offit et al. 
54 As shown in  
Table 3, the 
number of immunogenic proteins 
and polysaccharides contained 
in currently licensed vaccines is 
significantly smaller than the number 
of antigens contained in earlier 
vaccines and in naturally circulating 
organisms that infected children 
before universal vaccination. Sharing 
a copy of  
Table 3 could provide the 
necessary reassurance to parents 
who have concerns regarding “too 
many vaccines.”
COUNTERING VACCINE HESITANCY CAN 
BE CHALLENGING
Even the use of targeted discussion 
strategies may not be adequate to 
counter vaccine hesitancy. A recent 
study reported by Nyhan et al 
55 
recruited a nationally representative 
sample of parents through random 
digit dialing and address-based 
sampling and randomly assigned 
them to 1 of 5 groups: providing 
textual information explaining the 
lack of evidence that MMR vaccine 
causes autism, supplying textual 
information about the dangers of 
the diseases prevented by MMR 
vaccine, showing visual images 
of children who have diseases 
prevented by MMR vaccine, 
providing a dramatic audio narrative 
about an infant who almost died 
of measles, and no intervention. 
None of the interventions increased 
parental intent to vaccinate a 
future child. Thus, the authors 
concluded that current public health 
communications about vaccines 
may not be effective, and for some 
vaccine-hesitant parents, they may 
actually increase misperceptions 
and reduce vaccination intention. 
However, a limitation of this study 
was that it was Web based and did 
not examine the effect of direct one-
to-one personal communication 
between the pediatrician and the 
parent.
Providing vaccine information is 
time consuming. Kempe et al 
56 found 
that 53% of physicians spend 10 
to 19 minutes discussing vaccines 
with concerned parents, and 8% 
of physicians spend 20 minutes 
or more with these parents. They 
also reported that pediatricians 
experienced decreased job 
satisfaction because of time spent 
with parents with significant vaccine 
concerns. Physicians have several 
options to deal with this problem, 
ranging from scheduling longer 
well-care visits, with some loss of 
overall efficiency; simply not having

the discussion and acceding to a 
parent’s request to defer, delay, or 
skip a vaccination; or dismissing 
such families from their practice. 
Permitting alternative vaccine 
schedules reduces vaccine timeliness 
and complicates an already complex 
vaccine schedule. 
57 A study by 
Robison et al 
3 demonstrated that 
children whose parents chose to limit 
vaccinations had more total visits 
for immunizations and by both 9 and 
19 months of age were substantially 
less likely to be caught up on their 
immunization series. The additional 
time and costs associated with longer 
and more frequent well-child and 
immunization visits for parents with 
vaccine concerns are substantial, 
and by decreasing the efficiency of 
primary care providers, they may 
have a significant effect on access to 
health care services for all children.
PEDIATRICIANS PLAY AN IMPORTANT 
ROLE
With all the challenges acknowledged, 
the single most important factor in 
getting parents to accept vaccines 
remains the one-on-one contact with 
an informed, caring, and concerned 
pediatrician. 
58 In a study reported 
in Pediatrics, 
 parents of more than 
7000 children 19 to 35 months of age 
were surveyed to determine whether 
they believed vaccines were safe and 
what influence their primary care 
providers had on their decisions to 
vaccinate. 
45 Nearly 80% of parents 
stated that their decision to vaccinate 
was positively influenced by their 
primary care provider. The study 
concluded, “Health care providers 
have a positive influence on parents 
to vaccinate their children, including 
parents who believe that vaccinations 
are unsafe. Physicians, nurses, and 
other health care professionals 
should increase their efforts to build 
honest and respectful relationships 
with parents, especially when parents 
express concerns about vaccine safety 
or have misconceptions about the 
benefits and risks of vaccinations.” In 
another study, Smith et al 
59 clearly 
demonstrated that parents whose 
children were vaccinated listed their 
pediatrician as a strong influence on 
their decision to vaccinate. A well-
informed pediatrician who effectively 
addresses parental concerns and 
strongly supports the benefits of 
vaccination has enormous influence 
on parental vaccine acceptance.
ATTENTIVENESS TO PARENTS’ 
CONCERNS IS IMPORTANT WHILE 
CORRECTING MISCONCEPTIONS
After acknowledging the varied 
concerns of vaccine-hesitant 
parents, the pediatrician needs to 
communicate with the parents about 
the development and safety testing of 
vaccines, the reasons for immunizing, 
and the risks of not doing so. An 
important aspect of communication 
with vaccine-hesitant parents is to 
clearly articulate the message that 
vaccines are safe and effective, and 
serious disease can occur if your child 
and family are not immunized. The 
safety of the currently recommended 
vaccines administered according 
to their established schedules was 
strongly affirmed by the Institute of 
Medicine in 2013. 
60 A recent report 
commissioned by the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality, 
on behalf of the National Vaccine 
Program Office, and an accompanying 
editorial also affirmed the safety of 
vaccines recommended for routine 
immunization of children. 
61, 
 
62 It 
is important to present this safety 
information in a nonconfrontational 
dialogue with the parents while 
listening to and acknowledging their 
concerns. Misconceptions should be 
corrected, because both parents and 
pediatricians are in agreement in 
wanting the best for the children’s 
health and well-being. 
63
THE CURRENT VACCINE SCHEDULE IS 
THE ONLY RECOMMENDED SCHEDULE
It is extremely important that the 
pediatrician remain up to date on 
the current recommended vaccine 
schedule and support it as the 
only evidence-based schedule that 
has been tested and approved by 
multiple authoritative experts for 
safety and efficacy. 
60 No alternative 
vaccine schedules have been 
evaluated and found to provide 
better safety or efficacy than the 
recommended schedule, supported 
by the Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices of 
the CDC and the Committee on 
Infectious Diseases of the AAP (the 
committee that produces the Red 
Book). Pediatricians who routinely 
recommend limiting the numbers of 
vaccines administered at a single visit 
such that vaccines are administered 
late are providing care that deviates 
from the standard evidence-based 
schedule recommended by these 
bodies. Situational deviation from 
these recommendations may be 
considered a last resort if, after 
reasonable attempts to convince 
hesitant parents, it is the only 
way to achieve the ultimate goal 
of immunizing a child. All who 
provide vaccines must be capable of 
articulating the safety and efficacy 
of the standard schedule and refrain 
from suggesting that delaying or 
deferring vaccines may be safer or 
more effective, because there is no 
evidence to support this viewpoint.
Pediatricians should not 
overestimate parental vaccine 
hesitancy or mistake a simple lack 
of knowledge for hesitancy or 
opposition. 
64 Opel et al 
9 reported that 
only 55% of practitioners routinely 
provide parents with the rationale for 
why vaccines are administered and 
their potential adverse effects. They 
reported that nearly half of parents 
who were initially vaccine hesitant 
ultimately accepted vaccines after 
practitioners provided a rationale 
for vaccine administration. Parental 
education can be provided through 
Vaccine Information Statements 
(VISs) given to parents before 
vaccine administration, through 
e7

Downloaded from 
 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
an online review of the VIS before 
the routine immunization visit, or 
through referral to authoritative Web 
sites, such as that of the CDC (http:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
vaccines/ 
vpd- 
vac/ 
default. 
htm). One study reported that 
the majority of mothers preferred 
receiving vaccine information before 
the initial immunization visit. 
65 
The provision of a VIS is required 
at each immunization encounter 
for each vaccine, and counseling 
about vaccine-preventable diseases 
and vaccine adverse effects is 
required to correctly bill for vaccine 
administration. If parents refuse 
vaccination, a vaccine refusal 
waiver, used by many pediatricians 
in the event of deviations from the 
recommended vaccine schedule, 
can be obtained from the AAP Web 
site (https://

aspx), and 
parents may be asked to sign it.
PRESUMPTIVE DELIVERY STRATEGY
Another effective communication 
approach is the presumptive 
delivery strategy. Opel et al 
9 
demonstrated that the majority of 
parents accepted the provider’s 
vaccine recommendations when 
they were presented as required 
immunizations to maintain optimal 
disease prevention. This approach 
may not work well with some 
parents, however, and pediatricians 
may use it selectively based on their 
experience. In addition, pediatricians 
who began practicing medicine 
before the introduction of many of 
today’s routinely recommended 
vaccines have first-hand knowledge 
of these preventable diseases 
and often use that experience to 
effectively communicate the need 
for vaccines and the rationale for 
their administration according to 
established recommendations. One 
study conducted among 542 primary 
care providers in the United States 
demonstrated that recent graduates 
were less likely to believe that 
vaccines were safe and efficacious 
than their older colleagues 
66; 
whether this is attributable to lack of 
first-hand experience with vaccine-
preventable diseases or lack of 
comprehensive vaccine education 
is unclear. Educational efforts 
during residency training programs 
should provide trainees with a 
comprehensive understanding of the 
effect of vaccines on disease burden 
and the knowledge to evaluate 
the safety of vaccines as well as 
effective communication strategies. 
Only 48.5% of 303 US pediatric 
residents surveyed reported training 
in communication strategies for 
vaccine-hesitant patients during 
residency, and nearly 80% requested 
more education about the adverse 
effects of vaccines. 
67 One study 
found that a brief single educational 
intervention may not be sufficient 
to provide physicians with the skills 
to counteract vaccine hesitancy 
and suggested that more research 
is needed to determine the most 
effective educational interventions. 
68
PERSONALIZING THE MESSAGE THAT 
VACCINES ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE 
CAN BE POWERFUL
The presentation of basic medical 
information may not be sufficient to 
reassure parents about the safety and 
necessity of vaccines. Developing a 
trusting relationship with parents 
is key to influencing parental 
decision-making around vaccines. 
69 
Parents often are more likely to be 
persuaded by stories and anecdotes 
about the successes of vaccines. 
Personal examples of children who 
were sick with vaccine-preventable 
illnesses can be much more effective 
than simply reading the numbers of 
children infected with a disease each 
year in the VIS. The Web site www. 
immunize. 
org/ 
reports is an excellent 
source of such cases. A recent study 
by Kempe et al 
56 demonstrated that 
physicians reported the greatest 
success convincing skeptical parents 
using messages that relied on their 
personal choices and experiences. 
Physicians relating that they have 
immunized all of their children, 
their grandchildren, or themselves 
provide a compelling message that 
they are confident in the safety of the 
vaccines.
Other techniques, such as the use 
of parent-centered motivational 
interviewing, have been suggested 
as an effective way to personalize 
communication. Having parents 
verbalize their questions and 
concerns, followed by a focused 
response to their concerns, may 
be an effective communication 
strategy. However, the effect of 
motivational interviewing and other 
communication techniques requires 
careful assessment. It is encouraging 
that both AAP Periodic Surveys 
of Fellows from 2006 and 2013 
indicated that one-third of parents 
who initially refused ≥1 vaccines 
ultimately changed their minds and 
gave permission for vaccination. 
Although these conversations may 
be difficult and frustrating, they 
clearly represent time well spent. 
A summary of points that may be 
useful in these conversations is found 
in  
Table 4.
DISMISSAL OF PATIENTS WHO REFUSE 
VACCINATION
Some families still will not be 
persuaded to vaccinate. 
56 After 
multiple attempts to convince 
families to vaccinate have failed, 
some pediatricians have chosen to 
dismiss families as a last resort. 
7, 
 
8, 
 
70 
Arguments have been made 
that these families should not 
be dismissed on the basis of 
public health principles, because 
nonvaccinating families might cluster 
in certain practices, making them the 
focal point for outbreaks.71 Ethical 
arguments against dismissal have 
also been made. 
41, 
 
72, 
 
73 In addition, 
there are dilemmas for the many 
e8

pediatricians who continue to 
care for these families, including 
potentially exposing other patients 
to vaccine-preventable diseases 
from those who are unimmunized. 
Finally, many pediatricians may 
feel obligated to continue to care 
for children in families who refuse 
immunizations.
There are no published data 
regarding the eventual outcome of 
strict “vaccinate or be dismissed” 
policies on the eventual acceptance of 
vaccines, and additional studies are 
needed. However, there is anecdotal 
evidence that when pediatricians 
give parents the choice between 
immunizing their child or being 
dismissed, some parents accept 
vaccination, even when other efforts 
at persuasion have failed.
It should be noted that the same 
legal and ethical constraints exist 
to dismissal for any permissible 
reason, including failure to vaccinate. 
Dismissal must be conducted in a 
manner consistent with applicable 
state laws prohibiting abandonment 
of patients. Although these laws 
vary from state to state, official 
notification of the parents or legal 
guardian is required, along with the 
provision of information for finding 
a new physician. Furthermore, the 
dismissing physician is obligated 
to continue current treatment 
and provide emergency care for a 
reasonable period of time, usually 30 
days. 
74, 
 
75
Certain practice settings may also 
limit the ability to dismiss a patient. 
Employees of hospitals and large 
health care organizations are often 
unable to dismiss patients by official 
organizational policy. In areas of 
the country where there may be 
limited access to pediatric care, the 
pediatrician should carefully evaluate 
the availability of other qualified 
providers for the family. If there 
are no other qualified physicians in 
the area, the pediatrician is faced 
with the problem of leaving a family 
without adequate health care. In 
these situations, the pediatrician 
should continue to provide care to 
the patient and family.
The decision to dismiss a family who 
continues to refuse immunization is 
not one that should be made lightly, 
nor should it be made without 
considering and respecting the 
reasons for the parents’ point of 
view. 
44 Nevertheless, the individual 
pediatrician may consider dismissal 
of families who refuse vaccination as 
an acceptable option. In all practice 
settings, consistency, transparency, 
and openness regarding the 
practice’s policy on vaccines is 
important.
CONCLUSIONS
Vaccine discussions continue to 
occupy the media and Internet, and 
every parent of a child for whom 
vaccination is recommended is 
exposed to these messages on a 
regular basis. Data have shown 
that participation in social media 
reinforces one’s beliefs about 
vaccination, no matter what those 
beliefs are. 
76 The pediatrician is often 
the only medically trained person 
available to discuss vaccine matters 
with parents, and it is incumbent on 
him or her to provide scientifically 
based and balanced information 
when these questions are asked. 
 
Table 5 provides a summary of some 
of the available resources to aid the 
pediatrician.
The pediatrician should also 
appreciate that vaccine-hesitant 
parents are a heterogeneous group 
and that specific parental vaccine 
concerns should be individually 
identified and addressed. Although 
many techniques for working with 
vaccine-hesitant parents have been 
suggested, scant data are available 
to determine the efficacy of these 
methods. 
77 Additional research 
on communication techniques is 
needed. The clear message parents 
should hear is that vaccines are safe 
and effective, and serious disease 
can occur if your child and family 
are not immunized. Pediatricians 
should keep in mind that many, if 
not most, vaccine-hesitant parents 
are not opposed to vaccinating their 
children; rather, they are seeking 
guidance about the issues involved, 
beginning with the complexity of the 
schedule and the number of vaccines 
proposed. Parents may be unsure of 
the need for vaccines, because most 
have never experienced the diseases 
vaccines are designed to prevent, and 
they have concerns about possible 
adverse effects of these vaccines.
Pediatricians facing concerned 
parents on a regular basis should 
be prepared to discuss the science 
behind the current vaccine schedule 
and the extensive testing of each 
e9
TABLE 4  
Communication Highlights
Vaccines are safe and effective, and serious disease can occur if your child and family are not 
immunized.
Vaccine-hesitant individuals are a heterogeneous group, and their individual concerns should be 
respected and addressed.
Vaccine are tested thoroughly before licensure, and vaccine safety assessment networks exist to 
monitor vaccine safety after licensure.
Nonmedical vaccine exemptions increase rates of unvaccinated children.
Unvaccinated children put vaccinated children and medically exempt children who live in that same area 
at risk.
Pediatricians and other health care providers play a major role in educating parents about the safety 
and effectiveness of vaccines. Strong provider commitment to vaccination can infl
 uence hesitant or 
resistant parents.
Personalizing vaccine acceptance is often an effective approach.
The majority of parents accepted the provider’s vaccine recommendations when they were presented as 
required immunizations to maintain optimal disease prevention.
The current vaccine schedule is the only one recommended by the CDC and the AAP. Alternative 
schedules have not been evaluated.

vaccine before and after licensure, 
remind the parents of the severity 
of the diseases being prevented, 
address the questions that are 
causing parental concerns and, 
most importantly, emphasize that 
infants and children are the ones at 
greatest risk of disease. The on-time 
administration of vaccines is the most 
effective way to prevent what have 
in the past been severe and often 
fatal childhood illnesses. Delaying 
any vaccine past the recommended 
administration date greatly increases 
the period of time that a child 
remains susceptible to disease 
and also exposes even vaccinated 
children to additional risk. 
35, 
 
78
Countering vaccine hesitancy can 
best be accomplished in the course 
of clinical practice through open 
communication and discussion 
between the pediatrician and the 
parents. Because most parents 
agree to vaccinate their children, 
this dialogue, which can be started 
as early as the prenatal interview 
visit 
79 if possible, should be an 
ongoing process. Continued research 
is needed on the best methods 
to communicate the safety and 
effectiveness of vaccines. Providing 
vaccine-related information before 
the first immunization visit may 
permit parents to clearly formulate 
their concerns so that they can be fully 
addressed by the pediatrician. Most 
parents need and want education 
about the best way to provide care for 
their children, including vaccinations. 
Dealing with vaccine hesitancy is a 
wonderful opportunity to continue 
to provide this information and 
education to families.
