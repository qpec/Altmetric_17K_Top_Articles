Abstract
Objective
Higher prevalence of suicide notes could signify more conservatism in accounting and
greater proneness to undercounting of suicide by method. We tested two hypotheses: (1)
an evidentiary suicide note is more likely to accompany suicides by drug-intoxication and by
other poisoning, as less violent and less forensically overt methods, than suicides by firearm
and hanging/suffocation; and (2) performance of a forensic autopsy attenuates any
observed association between overtness of method and the reported presence of a note.
Methods
This multilevel (individual/county), multivariable analysis employed a generalized linear
mixed model (GLMM). Representing the 17 states participating in the United States National
Violent Death Reporting System throughout 2011–2013, the study population comprised
registered suicides, aged 15 years and older. Decedents totaled 32,151. The outcome mea-
sure was relative odds of an authenticated suicide note.

 Results
An authenticated suicide note was documented in 31% of the suicide cases. Inspection of
the full multivariable model showed a suicide note was more likely to manifest among drug
intoxication (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.56, 1.85) and other poisoning sui-
cides (OR, 2.12; 1.85, 2.42) than firearm suicides, the referent. Respective excesses were
larger when there was no autopsy or autopsy status was unknown (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.61,
2.14) and (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.86, 2.72) relative to the comparisons with a forensic autopsy
(OR, 1.62, 95% CI, 1.45, 1.82 and OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.66, 2.43). Hanging/suffocation sui-
cides did not differ from the firearm referent given an autopsy.
Conclusions
Suicide requires substantial affirmative evidence to establish manner of death, and affirma-
tion of drug intoxication suicides appears to demand an especially high burden of proof.
Findings and their implications argue for more stringent investigative standards, better train-
ing, and more resources to support comprehensive and accurate case ascertainment, as
the foundation for developing evidence-based suicide prevention initiatives.
Introduction
Emerging as the leading cause of injury mortality in the United States (US) by 2009 [1], suicide
is not a default manner-of-death determination for medical examiners and coroners [2–4]. A
socially condemned and stigmatized phenomenon, suicides are undercounted [5], with false
negativity posing a far greater threat than false positivity to valid certification [6,7]. National
and international research indicates that undercounting is nonrandom across suicide methods
[8,9]. The three leading methods of suicide in the US are firearm, hanging, and poisoning. Col-
lectively, these methods accounted for 92% of total suicides in 2015 [10]. Suicides by poisoning
are likely far more challenging for medical examiners and coroners to ascertain than those by
shooting and hanging [4,11–14]. Gross discrepancies among these major methods in account-
ing for suicide would inhibit, or even preclude, accurate risk group delineation and risk factor
identification, and hence impede the design, targeting, and implementation of effective clinical
and population interventions.
Availability of a suicide note or an equivalent—whether written, typed, digital, or audio
[15]—can serve as a pivotal piece of external forensic and psychological evidence for determin-
ing suicide as the manner of death [16]. Some countries even require a suicide note to record a
death as suicide [17], as was true of some US coroners in the 1970s [18]. Thus, lack of an evi-
dentiary note may induce suicide misclassification in the US [19]. Echoing its pivotal nature, a
US study found that a suicide manner of death was associated with a far higher prevalence of
notes than was undetermined intent, 32% versus 1.5% [20]. Two English studies also revealed
large prevalence gaps [21,22]. Undetermined is the manner of death category most susceptible
to obscuring suicides [21,23–25], in relative terms, with poisoning its predominant underlying
cause-of-death sub-category in the US [14,26].
Two earlier American studies found an excess of note-leaving among suicides by poisoning
relative to other methods [27,28], whereas a later one found an excess among hanging suicides
[29]. A subsequent individual-level, multivariable analysis of National Violent Death Report-
ing System (NVDRS) data, for the period 2003–2006, showed excess note-leaving among

 suicides by poisoning, firearm, and hanging versus all other methods except jumping from a
height and drowning, two other less forensically overt methods [30]. That study also showed
note leaving was nonrandom across demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race/ethnic-
ity, marital status, and urban residence. Finally, an Austrian study found no difference in the
prevalence of note-leaving across methods of suicide or age, sex, family status, psychiatric care
or motive [31]. Unlike the US, Austria is among rare countries whose suicide certification
appears very accurate [32,33].
In this multilevel, multivariable study of NVDRS data for 2011–2013, we posited that a
higher proportion of suicide notes in manner of death determinations involving fatal drug
introxication, as compared to those involving a firearm or hanging, reflected their use as key
evidence in the differential process of establishing suicide as the manner of death. This could
signify stricter (i.e., more conservative) evidentiary standards when making these determina-
tions, leading in turn to a greater potential for undercounting suicides.
We addressed two questions in our examination of the differential determination of suicide,
with a view to informing and improving surveillance, etiologic understanding, and prevention
of suicide and related injury mortality. Was an evidentiary note more common among suicide
cases involving drug intoxication and other poisoning, less self-evident causes and manner of
death, as compared to the violent methods of firearm and hanging, where apparent motivation
is more overt? Did the performance of a forensic autopsy serve to mediate the association
between the reporting of a note and the overtness of the suicide method? Although a forensic
autopsy is not a personal window into decedent intent [34], together with toxicology it gener-
ates evidence that helps medical examiners and coroners identify injury mechanisms (i.e.,
causes of death) and decedent intent in suspicious or uncertain cases [35–37].
Salient to our study, forensic autopsy and toxicological testing rates vary greatly across
states [38,39]. Since suicides are local events, and often socially stigmatized [40,41], we
adjusted our analyses for both county-level and individual-level factors. They comprised char-
acteristics of the medicolegal death investigations and the state-county investigation systems,
decedent and areal demographics, and documented mental health antecedents and other
death circumstances.
Data and methods
Individual-level data source and variables
The source for our individual-level variables was the Restricted Access Database from the
NVDRS, which is administered by the Centers for Disease Control, and Prevention (CDC).
This state, territory, and incident-based surveillance system employs public health informatics
for making data linkages, primarily among death certificates, law enforcement records, and
medical examiner and coroner records. Also variably incorporating such optional supplements
as laboratory reports and hospital records, the NVDRS provides de-identified information
about suicide and other violent deaths, including their geographic location, circumstances,
and personal sociodemographics, in addition to investigation specifics [42–44]. Disaggregata-
ble to county of death, the data analyzed in this study represented the 17 states that partici-
pated in the NVDRS throughout the 2011–2013 observation period. They were Alaska,
Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, North
Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, and Wis-
consin. Enhancing study generalizability, these states mirrored the nation in their age and sex
composition, manner-of-death distribution, and crude and age-adjusted all-cause, suicide, and
undetermined intent death rates [20]. They overrepresented non-Hispanic Blacks and Whites
and underrepresented Hispanics.

 Our study population comprised registered suicides (ICD-10: U03, X60-X84, Y87.0), whose
method and state and county of death were specified, and was further confined to decedents
aged 15 years and older, since fewer than 1% of known suicides were younger. The number of
decedents in our multivariable analyses totaled 32,151. As further background, our first table
provides comparative data on suicide methods for the 17 NVDRS states and the US. These
comparisons were based on separate counts for the selected demographic variables, not study
population and corresponding national population counts. Similarity between the states and
the nation would fortify the generalizability of the results. The data source was CDC WIS-
QARS™ (Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System) [10].
The outcome variable in this study was suicide note (yes versus no or unknown). Our pre-
dictor distinguished suicide methods as follows: drug intoxication, other poisoning, jumping
and drowning (combined owing to small sample size and similar corroborative challenges),
hanging/suffocation, firearm (referent), and all other methods specified in the NVDRS suicide
cases. Additional individual-level covariates were prior suicide attempt; primary mental diag-
nosis; current mental health treatment; blood alcohol concentration; number of other specified
drug positives; physical health problem; number of intimate partner or legal or job or financial
or school problems; crisis in past two weeks; emergency medical services at scene; region of
death; age; sex; race/ethnicity; marital status; education; and military veteran status. The medi-
ator was autopsy status (yes versus no or unknown).
County-level data sources and covariates
Linked to the individual-level data in this study, our county-level death investigation system
covariates were mode of selection of the chief medical examiner or coroner for a given system
(elected versus appointed) and accreditation status and type (accredited coroner, accredited
medical examiner, unaccredited coroner, unaccredited medical examiner). Selection mode
was identified through a CDC website [45], and accreditation status and system type through
the respective websites of the relevant accrediting agencies, the National Association of Medi-
cal Examiners (NAME) [46] and the International Association of Coroners and Medical
Examiners (IACME) [47]. We resolved outstanding questions by email or telephone commu-
nication with state, district, or county offices. County-level demographic covariates were urba-
nicity (5 categories representing the 12 ordinal categories of the 2013 Urban Influence Codes:
large metropolitan/small metropolitan/metropolitan adjacent/micropolitan or adjacent/rural)
and percent population below poverty as the measure of the local poverty burden. These two
covariates served as proxies for external forces that potentially could inhibit or support medi-
colegal death investigations [48]. Their source was the County Area Health Resource File for
2014–2015 [49].
Hypotheses and statistical approach
We used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to test the following two hypotheses: (1)
an evidentiary suicide note is more likely to accompany suicides by drug-intoxication and by
other poisoning than suicides by firearm and hanging/suffocation; and (2) performance of a
forensic autopsy attenuates the observed association between overtness of method and the
reported presence of a note. In testing the first hypothesis, we progressively applied four mod-
els, beginning with a univariable analysis, confined to suicide method, followed by multivari-
able analyses that cumulatively incorporated medicolegal system and investigation
characteristics, mental health antecedents and precipitating circumstances, and decedent and
areal demographics. Providing for a fifth multivariable model, we then tested our second
hypothesis. The GLMM is a two-level model that is logistic at the individual level and linear at

 the county level. We also included a state-level random effect to incorporate the data structure
of counties nested in a state and individuals nested in a county. The statistical software was
SAS (Copyright(c) 2002–2010, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Table 1 describes the frequency of suicide by method across age, sex, and race/ethnicity for the
NVDRS states and nationally during the observation period. Firearm, hanging, and drug
intoxication were the leading methods of suicide. Generally, the states and nation showed very
similar percentage distributions across age and sex, except at ages 14 years and under. The
small numbers of the latter induced data instability; this age group was eliminated from our
study population.
Bivariable frequency data on suicide notes for the study population are presented in
Table 2. An authenticated suicide note was documented in 31% of the suicide cases. Consistent
with our principal hypothesis, an excess prevalence of notes manifested for suicides by drug
intoxication and by other poisoning, at 42% and 48%, versus 29% and 31% for firearm and
hanging/suffocation suicides, respectively. Pertinent to statistical adjustments in the multivari-
able analyses, note prevalence reflected some marked variability by selection mode of the chief
medical examiner/coroner, blood alcohol concentration, region of death, and within the socio-
demographic characteristics of sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, and education.
Partially affirming the principal hypothesis, the univariable analysis showed drug intoxica-
tion suicides and suicides by other poisoning were respectively 71% and 122% more likely
than their referent, firearm suicides, to be associated with a note (Table 3). Neither hanging
suicides, as consistent with our hypothesis, nor combined jumping and drowning suicides
deviated from the referent. Findings remained robust as grouped death investigation variables
(Model 2), precipitating circumstances (Model 3), and decedent and county-level demograph-
ics (Model 4) were cumulatively incorporated into the multivariable analyses. For drug

 intoxication suicides, percent increase in odds of a note relative to the firearm referent rose
from 71% in the univariable analysis to 80% and 88%, respectively, in the multivariable analy-
sis with application of Models 2 and 3, and diminution to 66% following addition of the demo-
graphics in Model 4. Corresponding changes were more modest for the other poisoning
suicide category. However, under Models 1 and 4, percent increase in odds of a note relative to
firearms was larger for other poisoning suicides than for drug intoxication suicides at 122%
and 113%, respectively.
The stratified analysis supported our second hypothesis as performance of a forensic
autopsy attenuated the association between suicide method and suicide note outcome
(Table 4). Percent increase in odds of an evidentiary note for drug intoxication suicides, rela-
tive to firearm suicides, was 86% with no autopsy or unknown autopsy status versus 62% with
autopsy. Corresponding figures for other poisoning suicides were 125% and 101%. With no
autopsy or unknown autopsy status, hanging/suffocation suicides were less likely than firearm

 Discussion
Our findings caution users against uncritically taking suicide and other official data at face
value. Under-ascertainment means suicide undercounting. Indicative of differential under-
counting by method, increased odds of a suicide note manifested both for cases of suicides by
drug intoxication and by other poisoning relative to their referent, firearm cases, as consonant
with the first hypothesis concerning the relative violence and forensic overtness of methods.
Hanging suicides did not deviate from the referent, nor did the combined category of jumping
and drowning suicides. The observed note excess for both drug-intoxication and other poison-
ing suicides persisted through application of each of the multivariable models, including the
full multilevel, multivariable model that incorporated autopsy status.
The study implication of growing suicide misclassification and suicide undercounting
among drug intoxication deaths assumes added importance as an impediment to prevention
in the face of the burgeoning opioid mortality epidemic [50] and severely under-resourced
and overburdened emergency healthcare [51,52] and death investigation systems [53,54].
Although plausibly a gross underestimate, at 1.62 per 100,000 population, the drug intoxica-
tion suicide rate was 41% higher in 2015 than in 2000 [10]. However, suicides involving such
poisons as gases, vapors, metals, pesticides, and household cleaners have remained relatively
less common. At 0.50 per 100,000, the rate of non-drug poisoning suicides in 2015 was 12%
lower than the rate in 2000. Moreover, determination of intent in the non-drug poisoning
cases often rests on the unmistakable actions required to use these suicide methods (e.g., car-
bon monoxide poisoning where the decedent was found in a car with a hose from the tailpipe
to the passenger compartment, windows sealed with duct tape, ignition key in the on position,
and the gas tank empty), which diminishes the potential ambiguity they pose for medical
examiners and coroners. On the other hand, the literature provides no evidence drug intoxica-
tion suicides are more planned and less impulsive than suicides by more overtly violent
methods.
As hypothesized, performance of a forensic autopsy attenuated the observed associations
between overtness of suicide method and odds of an evidentiary suicide note. Although an
autopsy can help investigators identify the mechanism or cause of an injury death, it does not
invariably enlighten decedent intentionality [55]. Indeed, performance of an autopsy dimin-
ished but did eliminate the note-effect we found when comparing mechanisms of deaths in the
manner of death determination. Presence of a suicide note, similar to the effect of an overt sui-
cide method, may even reduce autopsy occurrence [56]. During 2007, 97% of US homicides
were autopsied compared with 60% of suicides, 81% of undetermined intent deaths, and 79%
of unintentional (accidental) poisoning deaths, pointing to a less rigorous approach to suicide
versus homicide determination and accounting [57].
The US National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME) Forensic Autopsy Performance
Standards require an autopsy when “the death is by apparent intoxication by alcohol, drugs, or
poison, unless a significant interval has passed, and the medical findings and absence of
trauma are well documented” [58]. NAME does not require autopsy in other suicidal deaths
where the cause is externally manifest (e.g., gunshot wound or hanging) and instead leaves
autopsy performance to the discretion of the pathologist, if it is “necessary to determine cause
or manner of death, or document injuries/disease, or collect evidence.” While this standard is
expected for medical examiners, who work in some states, it does not apply to elected coro-
ners–the norm for many states. Other jurisdictions have both coroners and medical examiners,
varying by counties [39].
By comparison with the US, Finnish medicolegal authorities conducted forensic autopsies
in 99% of suicides, 98% of homicides, 98% of unintentional poisoning deaths, and 97% of

 undetermined deaths in the period 2000–2003 [59]. Researchers viewed a lower autopsy rate
and greater use of ill-defined and unknown cause-of-death codes as especially problematic for
the quality of Danish suicide and other manner-of-death statistics relative to those of Finland
[60,61]. During the period 1998–2007, Finland and Denmark had annualized suicide rates of
20 and 12 per 100,000 population, respectively [62]. Corresponding combined clinical and
forensic autopsy rates for total deaths were 31% and 8%. This gap—as a plausible indicator of
different standards of thoroughness in medicolegal death investigations [63]—may mean there
is an artifactual component in the differential in suicide rates between these two Scandinavian
countries. However, substantive factors contributing to a higher rate in Finland might include
variable alcohol consumption and firearm ownership between Finland and Denmark.
More generally implicating an artifactual component in suicide rates and rate variation, an
ecological or correlational study of 35 Eurasian countries reported spatial and temporal associ-
ations between the respective magnitudes of the combined clinical and forensic autopsy rate
and the suicide rate [62]. Spatially or cross-sectionally, a 1% difference in autopsy rates was
associated with a suicide rate difference of 0.49 per 100,000 population, and temporally or lon-
gitudinally a 1% decrease in the autopsy rate with a suicide rate decrease of 0.42 per 100,000.
Our research, examining registered or known suicides, complements another multilevel
(individual/county), multivariable study which used NVDRS data from the same observation
period to predict differential odds that suicides pooled with deaths of undetermined intent,
included as possible suicides, would be classified by medical examiners and coroners as suicide
if there was documentation of a suicide note and mental health antecedents [20]. One hypothe-
sis in the complementary study addressed the association between an evidentiary suicide note
and suicide classification. Underscoring a pivotal role an authenticated note can play in sepa-
rating suicide from undetermined cases, presence was associated with 34-fold increased odds
of a suicide classification. In addition, combined firearm and hanging/suffocation deaths
showed 42-fold increased odds of a suicide classification relative to drug intoxication deaths
or, alternatively expressed, 98% lower odds of an undetermined classification. Drug intoxica-
tion cases with an evidentiary note were 45 times more likely to be classified as suicide com-
pared to corresponding cases with no note or unknown note status, and eight times more
likely in firearm and hanging cases. A relative strength of the current multilevel study, since it
focused on suicides rather than suicides and undetermined deaths, was greater granularity and
specificity of suicide methods or injury causes/mechanisms than in the comparative NVDRS
study.
Based on medicolegal and police investigations, which often involve family and friends of
the decedent, NVDRS data are vulnerable to reporter bias, especially among persons who are
ashamed or embarrassed by what transpired. This deficiency also may reflect a lack of willing-
ness of investigators to collect data about decedent background and circumstances when sui-
cide is readily apparent as the manner of death, or when as an elected local official, coroners
are reluctant to probe potentially sensitive personal issues. Our study and the complementary
NVDRS investigation jointly reveal a need for qualitative as well as quantitative research on
whether family and friends of the decedents variably destroy or otherwise conceal suicide
notes, and withhold other potential corroborative evidence from authorities. The field now
would benefit from mixed methods investigations that integrate psychological autopsies, focus
groups, surveys, sociocultural autopsies, content analysis, and thematic analysis to examine
values and attitudes towards suicide that may continue to influence its reporting. Although
high quality data regarding suicides are essential for planning, implementing, and evaluating
suicide prevention programs, few resources have been devoted to improving fundamental data
quality. Without such rigor, it will be difficult to accept the validity of future efforts to reduce
suicide rates.

 The enriched Restricted Access Database of the NVDRS provides the only population-
based data in the US appropriate for evaluating our research questions about the relationship
between suicide methods, a forensic autopsy, and an evidentiary suicide note. Besides reporter
bias, a limitation of this study was restriction of the geographic domain to the 17 states that
contributed data to the NVDRS throughout the observation period, 2011–2013. Nevertheless,
high demographic concordance between these states and the nation [20] tempers our concern
about reduced generalizability of study findings, which additionally is a by-product of system
protocols that emphasize uniform definitions of manner of death and consistent data collec-
tion, entry, review, and coding [44]. Moreover, the similarity in the distribution of suicides by
method across age, sex, and race/ethnicity, between the NVDRS states and the nation,
enhanced our confidence in study generalizability. Since our observation period, the NVDRS
has expanded to 40 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, with a goal to cover all 50
states and the territories [64]. Further study limitations included the indirect nature of our
assessment of differential suicide data quality by method, confinement of our study population
to suicides whose death circumstances were captured by the NVDRS and whose methods were
specified, and our inability to factor in medicolegal use of a computerized tomography scan in
lieu of a forensic autopsy. Other limitations and strengths of the NVDRS have been reported
[20,44,65–67].
Conclusions
Suicide requires substantial affirmative evidence to establish manner of death, and affirmation
of drug intoxication suicides appears to demand an especially high burden of proof. Findings
and their implications argue for more stringent investigative standards, better training, and
more resources to support accurate and comprehensive case ascertainment, as the foundation
for developing evidence-based suicide prevention initiatives.
