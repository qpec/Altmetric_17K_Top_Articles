Objective. Arhalofenate is a novel antiinflamma-
tory uricosuric agent. The objective of this study was to
evaluate its antiflare activity in patients with gout.
Methods. This was a 12-week, randomized, double-
blind, controlled phase IIb study. Eligible patients had had
‡3 flares of gout during the previous year, had discontin-
ued urate-lowering therapy and colchicine, and had a
serum uric acid (UA) level of 7.5–12 mg/dl. Patients were
randomly assigned at a 2:2:2:2:1 ratio to receive 600 mg
arhalofenate, 800 mg arhalofenate, 300 mg allopurinol,
300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine, or placebo once
a day. The primary outcome measure was the flare inci-
dence (number of flares divided by time of exposure). The
serum UA level was a secondary outcome measure.
Results. A total of 239 gout patients were random-
ized and took at least 1 dose of study medication. The pri-
mary outcome measure comparing flare incidence between
800 mg arhalofenate and 300 mg allopurinol was achieved,
with a 46% decrease in the 800 mg arhalofenate group
(0.66 versus 1.24; P 5 0.0056). Treatment with 800 mg
arhalofenate was also significantly better than placebo
(P5 0.049) and not significantly different from treatment
with 300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine (P5 0.091).
Mean changes in serum UA level were 212.5% with 600 mg
arhalofenate and 216.5% with 800 mg arhalofenate
(P5 0.001 and P5 0.0001, respectively, versus 20.9% with
placebo). There were no meaningful differences in adverse
events (AEs) between groups, and there were no serious
AEs related to arhalofenate. Urinary calculus occurred in
1 patient receiving 300 mg allopurinol. No abnormal serum
creatinine values >1.5-fold the baseline value were
observed in the arhalofenate-treated groups.
Conclusion. Arhalofenate at a dosage of 800 mg
decreased gout flares significantly compared to allopu-
rinol at a dosage of 300 mg. Arhalofenate was well toler-
ated and appeared safe. Arhalofenate is the first urate-
lowering antiflare therapy.
Gout is the most common cause of inflammatory
arthritis (1). It is manifested by extremely painful joint
attacks, also called flares, which have a major impact on
quality of life (1,2). Gout results from the deposition of
urate crystals in joints. Chronic hyperuricemia, the bio-
chemical signature of the disease, leads to the deposition of
urate crystals in articular structures, and the disruption of
these crystals is believed to trigger flares (3). Beyond its
articular consequences, the hyperuricemia of gout is inde-
pendently associated with multiple morbidities, including
hypertension, increased cardiovascular risks, and progres-
sive kidney disease (4,5). Currently available urate-
lowering therapies, while effective for decreasing serum
uric acid (UA) levels, dramatically increase the chance of
experiencing a flare attack, probably by disrupting intra-
articular urate crystals (6–8). This paradoxical effect may

 be associated with gout patients’ difficulty in understanding
and adhering to their treatment.
Gout treatment guidelines recommend colchicine
and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for
the prevention of flares, notably when initiating urate-
lowering therapy (9). However, colchicine is poorly toler-
ated, and its prescription is limited in time because of
associated toxicities such as azoospermia, bone marrow
suppression, neuropathy, and myopathy (10). Colchicine
is also associated with numerous potential drug–drug
interactions (10), a significant concern in polymedicated
gout patients (11). Therefore, a new treatment that both
prevents gout flares and lowers serum UA levels would
address a major unmet need of gout patients.
Arhalofenate is a uricosuric drug which lowers
serum UA by blocking its reabsorption by the proximal
tubules of the kidney (12). Arhalofenate activity is medi-
ated by inhibition of URAT1. Additionally, arhalofenate
has been suggested to exert potent antiinflammatory
activity. In a mouse model of urate crystal–induced in-
flammation, arhalofenate suppressed the local release of
proinflammatory cytokines and, most notably, the release
of interleukin-1b (IL-1b), a key inducer of gout flare (13).
In this model, arhalofenate also prevented the influx of
neutrophils at the site of inflammation (13). In vitro studies
in isolated murine macrophages have also documented that
this cell, which plays a key role in the pathophysiology of a
gout attack, is the site of action of arhalofenate (13).
In previous phase II studies in gout patients, it
was suggested that in addition to decreasing serum UA lev-
els, arhalofenate could suppress gout flares (14). These
phase II studies, however, were conducted on a background
of colchicine prophylaxis (14), and arhalofenate antiflare
activity could not be definitively proven. Thus, the primary
objective of the current study was to demonstrate the anti-
flare activity of arhalofenate in gout patients in the absence
of colchicine prophylaxis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
The study was conducted in accordance with the Dec-
laration of Helsinki and the Principles of Good Clinical Prac-
tice. The study protocol was approved by relevant health
authorities in the US, Canada, and the Republic of Georgia
and by institutional review boards/ethics committees at each
study center. All patients provided written informed consent.
A list of participating investigators in the Arhalofenate Flare
Study is provided in Appendix A.
Study design. This was a 12-week, multicenter, random-
ized, double-blind, active- and placebo-controlled, parallel-
group phase IIb study. Patients underwent a screening visit
within 3 weeks of randomization. Randomization was stratified
by serum UA level (,9.5 mg/dl or $9.5 mg/dl) and the pres-
ence or absence of tophi. Randomized patients entered a
double-blind treatment phase and began receiving treatment
on study day 1 with subsequent study visits at the end of weeks
2, 4, 8, and 12. There was a safety follow-up visit 2 weeks after
the last dose of study drugs.
Patient selection. Patients ages 18–75 years diagnosed
as having gout according to the American College of Rheuma-
tology criteria (15) and who had experienced $3 flares during
the 12 months before screening were eligible. At screening,
patients had a serum UA level of 7.5–12 mg/dl and had not
received any urate-lowering therapy or colchicine for at least
2 weeks. Patients with an estimated creatinine clearance of
,60 ml/minute/1.73 m2, a fractional excretion of urate .10%,
or a history of kidney stones were excluded. Liver function test
results and creatine kinase levels had to be #33 the upper
limit of normal (ULN). Patients with secondary hyperuricemia
or xanthinuria were excluded. Blood pressure had to be con-
trolled, and findings of electrocardiography (EKG) had to be
within normal limits. Patients with a body mass index of
.42 kg/m2 or with a medical condition that could interfere
with the conduct of the study were excluded.
Patients receiving medication known to affect serum
UA levels were required to be receiving a stable dose for at
least 2 weeks and to continue to receive the same dose during
the study. Concomitant use of potent cytochrome 3A4 inhib-
itors, cytotoxic drugs, or anticoagulants was prohibited, as was
long-term treatment with NSAIDs or systemic corticosteroids.
Women of reproductive potential had to use accepted forms
of contraception.
Study treatments and treatment assignment. Study
drugs were administered once daily for 12 weeks. There were
5 treatment groups: 600 mg arhalofenate, 800 mg arhalofen-
ate, 300 mg allopurinol, 300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchi-
cine, and placebo. Eligible patients were randomly assigned at
a 2:2:2:2:1 ratio to the 5 treatment groups; the placebo group
had half the number of patients in the other groups.
Study assessments. Each patient was provided with a
handheld electronic diary to be used once a day to report flare
episodes. Patients were trained during screening by certified
study site personnel. The diary first asked patients if they had
a joint pain, if this pain was typical of a flare, and whether it
was present at rest. If pain was present, the patient was asked
additional questions about the nature of this potential gout
attack and its treatment. Beginning with the first dose of study
drug and for the 12 weeks of the study, the patient reported
flare(s) via the electronic diary. Electronic diary data were
reviewed with site personnel at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Site per-
sonnel also checked patients’ compliance with the electronic
diary in an ongoing manner. The electronic diary was also
used to fill out a patient’s quality-of-life questionnaire (the
Health Assessment Questionnaire II) (16).
Safety assessments included a complete physical exam-
ination, 12-lead EKG, evaluation of vital signs, and height and
weight. Laboratory tests included standard chemistry and
hematology panels, estimated creatinine clearance, and the
fractional excretion of UA (UA clearance divided by creati-
nine clearance). During study treatment, investigators, study
staff, monitoring personnel, and the sponsor were blinded
with regard to the results of testing for serum UA level and
fractional excretion of UA.
Study outcome measures. The primary outcome mea-
sure of efficacy was the flare incidence from baseline to week
12. The flare incidence was calculated as the number of flares
in a treatment arm divided by the total period of time with
available electronic diary data. A flare was defined as an epi-
2028

 sode of patient-reported acute articular or bursal pain that
occurred at rest and was typical of past gout attacks. In addi-
tion, both of the following criteria had to be met: the intensity
of pain at rest had to be $4 on an 11-point numerical rating
scale, and the pain had to be determined by the patient and/or
the investigator to require antiinflammatory/analgesic treat-
ment. Finally, at least 2 of 3 possible joint symptoms (swelling,
warmth, or tenderness) had to be present, and at least 1 of the
following had to be present: rapid onset of pain, decreased
range of joint motion, or joint redness. All these were reported
by the patient in response to simple questions appearing in the
electronic diary (e.g., “was the pain of rapid onset?”). Patients
had the opportunity to assess their understanding of each ques-
tion during the training session.
Secondary efficacy outcome measures included the
percent reduction in serum UA level and the proportion of
patients with a serum UA level of ,6 mg/dl. Other efficacy
outcome measures such as quality of life were considered
exploratory.
Safety outcome measures were serious adverse events
(SAEs), discontinuation from the study for reasons of safety,
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and changes in
laboratory parameter values. Arhalofenate acid trough levels
were determined.
Statistical analysis. A sample size of 50 patients per
treatment group provided 80% power to detect a treatment
group difference in flare incidence of ;50% between the
800 mg arhalofenate group and the 300 mg allopurinol group,
based on a 2-sided, 2-sample test at the 5% level of signifi-
cance. A placebo group of 25 patients also provided 80% pow-
er to detect a 50% difference in serum UA level between the
800 mg arhalofenate group and the placebo group, based on a
2-sided, 2-sample test at the 5% level of significance.
The primary efficacy analysis included all randomized
patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1
postbaseline day recorded with the electronic diary (modified
intent-to-treat [ITT] group). Missing electronic diary data were
not imputed.
A Poisson regression model was used to analyze flare
incidence between treatment groups (17). The model included
treatment groups and the randomization stratification criteria
as factors. Incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals
(95% CIs) and P values for treatment group differences were
calculated. Quantitative outcome measures were assessed with
analysis of covariance models with the same factors and with
the baseline value of the corresponding end point included as
covariate. The least squares mean (LSM) 6 SEM, 95% CI,
and P value were calculated. The time to onset of first flare
was estimated using a Kaplan-Meier method, and treatment
groups were compared using the log rank test. For serum UA
level, any data available were used with a last observation car-
ried forward imputation. The safety analysis included all ran-
domized patients who took at least 1 dose of study drug.
Summary statistics were used.
RESULTS
Overall, 248 patients were randomized for the
study. A total of 239 took at least 1 dose of study medi-
cation and were included in the modified ITT and safety
populations. Thirty-two patients (13.4%) were withdrawn
from the study. The most common reason was a TEAE (8
patients, 3.3%) (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics were
comparable among treatment groups (Table 1). The
mean 6 SD age of the patients was 52.0 6 10.2 years; most
patients were men (95.8%), and 70.7% were white. The
mean6 SD serum UA level at baseline was 9.16 1.5 mg/dl,
and 20.1% of the patients had tophi.
Efficacy. The primary outcome measure of the
study was achieved. The flare incidence was 0.66 in the
800 mg arhalofenate group and 1.24 in the 300 mg allopu-
rinol group, a decrease of 46% (P 5 0.0056) (Figure 2).
The 800 mg arhalofenate treatment group also
had a 41% decrease in flare incidence compared to the
placebo group (0.66 versus 1.13; P 5 0.049). The flare
incidence in the 300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchi-
cine group was 0.40, significantly lower than that in the
300 mg allopurinol group (P , 0.0001) but not signifi-
cantly different from that in the 800 mg arhalofenate
group (P 5 0.091). There was a 16% decrease in flare

 incidence in the 600 mg arhalofenate group compared
to the 300 mg allopurinol group (P 5 0.37) (Figure 2).
For patients who experienced a flare, the median
duration of flare was 2.0 days (range 1.0–6.0 days) in the
800 mg arhalofenate group and 1.5 days (range 1.0–18.0
days) in the 300 mg allopurinol group (P not signifi-
cant). The median duration of flares was 2.4 days (range
1.0–7.0 days) in the placebo group, 2.4 days (range 1.0–
28.0 days) in the 600 mg arhalofenate group, and 2.0
days (range 1.0–3.5 days) in the 300 mg allopurinol plus
0.6 mg colchicine group. The median time to onset of
first flare in patients experiencing flares was 13 days in
the 800 mg arhalofenate group and 10 days in the
300 mg allopurinol group (P 5 0.033) (see Supplemen-
tary Figure 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology
web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.
39684/abstract). It was 31 days in the placebo group, 14
days in the 600 mg arhalofenate group, and 5 days in the
300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine group. No
patients experienced a new flare after 2 months of treat-
ment in either the 800 mg arhalofenate group or the
300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine group (Supple-
mentary Figure 1). Sixty-five percent of patients in the
800 mg arhalofenate group experienced no flares during
treatment, compared with 39% of patients in the 300 mg
allopurinol group (Figure 3). Also, patients in the 800 mg
arhalofenate group tended to have fewer flares than did
patients in the 300 mg allopurinol group (Figure 3).
The mean change in serum UA level from base-
line to week 12 was 212.5% in the 600 mg arhalofenate
group and 216.5% in the 800 mg arhalofenate group, com-
pared with 20.9% in the placebo group (LSM differences
P5 0.001 and P5 0.0001, respectively) (Table 2). The
mean change in serum UA level from baseline to week 12
was 228.8% in the 300 mg allopurinol group and 224.9%
in the 300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine group.
Compared with patients who received placebo, greater pro-
portions of patients treated with 600 mg arhalofenate and
800 mg arhalofenate achieved serum UA levels of ,6 mg/dl
at week 12 (13.2% and 11.8%, respectively, versus none in
the placebo group; both P, 0.001).
Safety and tolerability. No patients died during
the study. Five patients had an SAE: 3 in the 300 mg
allopurinol group (procedural pain after hernia repair,
increase in blood creatinine concentration, urinary cal-
culus), 1 in the 300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchi-
cine group (peripheral neuropathy), and 1 in the 600 mg
arhalofenate group (angioedema). The urinary calculus
was considered possibly related to the study drug. The
angioedema was considered possibly related to the con-
comitant use of lisinopril and probably not related to

 arhalofenate. The angioedema resolved despite continu-
ation of arhalofenate. The other SAEs were considered
unrelated to the study drugs.
Nine patients were withdrawn from the study
because of TEAEs (Table 3). One patient in the placebo
group discontinued because of blurred vision, fatigue,
headache, nausea, and vomiting. One patient in the
800 mg arhalofenate group discontinued because of
abdominal pain, headache, and a rash. Four patients in
the 300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine group dis-
continued: 1 because of an abnormal liver function test
result, 1 because of a drug hypersensitivity, 1 because of
both abdominal pain and hypersomnia, and 1 because
of a peripheral neuropathy. Three patients in the
300 mg allopurinol group discontinued: 1 because of
eosinophilia of up to 2.4 3 103/ml (20% of white blood
cells) and elevated gamma glutamyl transferase, 1
because of diarrhea and vomiting, and 1 because of uri-
nary calculus. No patients in the 600 mg arhalofenate
group discontinued because of a TEAE. Of the TEAEs
that led to study discontinuation, 1 was considered both
serious and severe (urinary calculus in a patient in the
300 mg allopurinol group) and 1 was considered serious
(peripheral neuropathy in a patient in the 300 mg allo-
purinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine group).
Overall, 108 of 239 patients (45.2%) experienced
a TEAE (Table 3). The incidence of TEAEs was similar
among active treatment groups. The most common TEAE
was increased creatine kinase in 11 patients (4.6%), with no
differences between active treatment groups. Most TEAEs
were of mild or moderate intensity. Three severe TEAEs
were also serious: angioedema, peripheral neuropathy, and
urinary calculus.
Elevated liver function test results $33 the ULN
included 1 elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the 800 mg arhalofen-
ate group, 1 elevation of ALT in the 300 mg allopurinol
plus 0.6 mg colchicine group, and 1 elevation of AST/ALT
in the 300 mg allopurinol group. Overall, the mean estimat-
ed creatinine clearance at baseline was 97.3 ml/minute/
1.73 m2, with no imbalance between groups. At week 12
overall, the mean estimated creatinine clearance was
100.3 ml/minute/1.73 m2, with no relevant differences with-
in or between groups. Estimated creatinine clearance did
not decrease in either arhalofenate group. No renal TEAEs

 baseline value were observed in the arhalofenate-treated
groups. Overall, the mean6 SD fractional excretion of UA
at baseline was 4.06 1.8%, with no imbalance between
groups. At week 12, the increases from baseline were 1% in
the 600 mg arhalofenate group and 0.9% in the 800 mg
arhalofenate group. No patients receiving arhalofenate had
a fractional excretion of urate greater than normal. At
week 12, the fractional excretion of UA decreased in the
300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine group and in
the 300 mg allopurinol group (both 20.4%). No clinically
meaningful changes in urinary pH were observed.
DISCUSSION
This 12-week, double-blind, randomized, active-
and placebo-controlled study was primarily designed to
demonstrate and evaluate the antiflare activity of arha-
lofenate, a new uricosuric agent (12). Arhalofenate has
also been suggested to exert a unique antiinflammatory
activity by inhibiting the local intraarticular production
of IL-1b triggered by monosodium urate monohydrate
crystals (13) that is responsible for gout flare attacks.
Previous phase II studies, conducted on a background
of colchicine prophylaxis, indicated that arhalofenate
could have antiflare activities (14). The present study
was the first to test the hypothesis that arhalofenate
could have antiflare activity in the absence of back-
ground colchicine.
In this study, gout patients recorded signs, symp-
toms, and treatment of painful joint episodes using an
electronic diary. An accepted definition of gout flares,
consistent with experts’ recommendations (18), was
used to collect and analyze flare data. This technology
allowed a precise evaluation of each flare episode and
avoided the recall biases that occur when flares are
recorded only at predefined intervals or through other
means, such as telephone interviews, which could be
open to subjectivity.
Two hundred thirty-nine gout patients who had
had at least 3 flare episodes during the previous year
were randomized and treated in this study. The primary
efficacy outcome measure was met, as demonstrated by
the finding that arhalofenate at a daily dose of 800 mg
reduced the incidence of flare compared to allopurinol
at a daily dose of 300 mg, in both a statistically and clini-
cally significant manner (a 46% incidence reduction).
Also, more patients in the 800 mg arhalofenate group
experienced no flares during treatment than did patients
in the 300 mg allopurinol group, and patients in the
800 mg arhalofenate group tended to have fewer flares
than did patients in the 300 mg allopurinol group.
In this study, the known antiflare activity of col-
chicine (19) was confirmed, further validating the elec-
tronic diary technology and the definition of flare that
was used. The flare incidence was also both clinically
and statistically decreased in the 300 mg allopurinol
plus 0.6 mg colchicine group compared with the 300 mg
allopurinol group. There was also no significant differ-
ence in flare incidence between the 800 mg arhalofenate
group and the 300 mg allopurinol plus 0.6 mg colchicine
group, although the study was not powered to test this
comparison. Thus, the clinical utility of 800 mg arha-
lofenate to prevent gout attacks will have to be judged
in the context of the respective risk:benefit ratio of each
flare treatment. While colchicine is an effective antiflare
therapy (19), it does not reduce serum UA, it can be
poorly tolerated with diarrhea or abdominal cramps,
and it can potentially induce rare yet severe reactions
such as myelosuppression and neuromuscular toxicity
(10). In addition, colchicine has multiple potential inter-
actions with commonly prescribed drugs, and the dose

 needs to be adjusted in patients with renal impairment
(10).
The present study also confirmed that arhalofenate
decreases serum UA levels through its uricosuric activity
(12). However, compared to the arhalofenate-treated
groups, both allopurinol-treated groups achieved greater
reductions in serum UA levels. Thus, both the antiflare and
uricosuric activities of arhalofenate will be better suited for
a combination regimen with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.
Overall, the incidence of TEAEs was similar
across active treatment groups. The increased incidence
of creatine kinase elevation in gout patients, irrespective
of treatment received, has been recognized (20). The docu-
mented SAEs, such as drug hypersensitivity reactions and a
peripheral neuropathy, were already known to be associat-
ed with allopurinol and colchicine (6,8,10,19). However,
arhalofenate was well tolerated and appeared safe. Notably,
no significant impacts on hepatic or renal functions were
associated with arhalofenate.
Clinical studies completed in patients with gout
thus far indicate that arhalofenate, when used in combi-
nation with febuxostat, demonstrates potent serum UA–
lowering activities. In a recent study (14), all patients
receiving the combination of arhalofenate and febuxo-
stat achieved a serum UA level below the recommended
target goal of 6 mg/dl (8), and most achieved a serum UA
level of ,5 mg/dl, a target goal recommended for gout
patients with tophi (8). Furthermore, and consistent with
these results, the absence of pharmacodynamic interaction
between arhalofenate and febuxostat has been demonstrat-
ed in a preliminary study (21).
Multiple studies have shown that a minority of
gout patients receive effective treatment, and many of
them continue to experience recurrent flare attacks and
further joint damage (22,23). Available urate-lowering
therapies have not improved the problem of the mis-
management of gout. One of the key issues associated
with urate-lowering therapies is that they make flares
worse when treatment is initiated (6,7,24,25), and this
paradox is difficult for patients to understand. Conse-
quently, gout treatment guidelines recommend the use
of colchicine, systemic corticosteroids, or NSAIDs for
prevention and treatment of acute gout flares (9). While
colchicine and NSAIDs are effective for treating gout
flares, they are poorly tolerated or contraindicated in
the majority of patients (4,11). In one analysis of the
safety of gout therapy, .90% of patients had at least 1
contraindication to NSAIDs and systemic steroids, and
.30% had at least 1 strong contraindication to colchi-
cine (11). Using the antiflare activity and serum UA–
lowering properties of arhalofenate in combination with
febuxostat could potentially help more gout patients to
reach their serum UA target goal without triggering
urate-lowering therapy–induced flares.
One limitation of this phase II study is that it
covered only a 12-week treatment period and enrolled a
limited number of patients. The results will have to be
confirmed in a larger group of patients for a longer peri-
od of time using a gout treatment regimen that com-
bines arhalofenate with febuxostat. This will be the
objective of the arhalofenate phase III program.
In conclusion, this phase II study demonstrated
that in gout patients the antiinflammatory properties of
arhalofenate, a uricosuric agent, can be translated in the
clinic to prevent acute gout flare attacks. Arhalofenate
was well tolerated and appeared safe. Further studies
will evaluate the antiflare and serum UA–lowering
activities of arhalofenate when combined with the xan-
thine oxidase inhibitor febuxostat.
