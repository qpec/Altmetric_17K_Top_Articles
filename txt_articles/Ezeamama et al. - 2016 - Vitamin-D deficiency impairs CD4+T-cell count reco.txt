Summary
Background & aims—We implemented a prospective study among human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV)-positive adults to examine the association between vitamin-D deficiency (VDD) and 
insufficiency (VDI) vs sufficiency (VDS) and CD4+T-cell improvement over 18 months of highly 
active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
Methods—We used data from a randomized placebo-controlled micronutrient trial with 25-
hydroxy vitamin-D (25(OH)D) measured at enrollment in 398 adults. CD4+T-cell count was 
measured repeatedly at months 0, 3, 6, 12 and 18. Linear mixed models quantified the vitamin-D-
related differences in CD4+T-cell count and associated 99% confidence intervals at baseline and 
respective follow-up intervals.
Results—At baseline 23%, 60% and 17% of participants were VDS, VDI and VDD, 
respectively. Absolute CD4+T- cell counts recovered during follow-up were persistently lower for 
baseline VDD and VDI relative to VDS participants. The greatest deficit in absolute CD4+T-cells 
recovered occurred in VDD vs VDS participants with estimates ranging from a minimum deficit 
of 26 cells/μl (99% CI: −77, 26) to a maximum deficit of 65 cells/μl (99% CI: −125, −5.5) during 
follow-up. This VDD-associated lower absolute CD4+T-cell gain was strongest among patients 35 
years old or younger and among participants with a baseline body mass index of less than 25 
kg/m2.

 Conclusions—VDD is associated with lower absolute CD4+T-cell count recovery in HIV-
positive patients on HAART. Vitamin-D supplementation may improve CD4+T-cell recovery 
during HAART. However, future intervention studies are needed to definitively evaluate the 
effectiveness of this vitamin as an adjunct therapy during HAART.

1. Introduction
The prevalence of hypovitaminosis-D including vitamin-D deficiency (VDD) and 
insufficiency (VDI), varies from 35% to 75% in epidemiologic studies of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected African adults [1–5]. Vitamin-D status in HIV-
positive adults maybe dysregulated by HIV-specific pathogenesis and by antiretroviral 
therapy with implications for the long-term health status of HIV-infected persons [6]. 
Epidemiologic studies suggest that certain highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) 
drugs (e.g., efavirenz, protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitors) may further lower vitamin-D levels independent of HIV-specific pathogenesis due 
to interactions in the cytochrome P450 pathway resulting in preferential hydroxylation of 
vitamin-D to biologically inactive forms [7,8]. In addition, vitamin-D modulates T-cells, 
cytokines and dendritic cells [9]. Thus, VDD in HIV-infected HAART-naive and HAART-
experienced adults may adversely affect adaptive immune response. If confirmed, this 
deficiency may predict a range of adverse outcomes in HIV-infected patients on HAART and 
adds further urgency to the importance of understanding the role of this micronutrient and its 
deficiency in HIV-infected persons.
VDD has been associated with higher risk of wasting [6], increased risk of anemia, 
incidence of AIDS-defining conditions [10] and elevated risk of mortality [11] in HIV-
infected adults. Among HIV-positive children from Cleveland, Ohio, higher levels of 
vitamin-D were associated with higher CD4+T-cell counts post-antiretroviral therapy 
(HAART) initiation [12]. Only one clinical trial of vitamin-D supplementation in HIV-
infected persons has been implemented with immune restoration as the primary endpoint 
among 54 immune-competent HIV-infected children stable on HAART. The trial found no 
impact on CD4 cell count despite treatment-related improvements in vitamin-D levels [13].
A secondary analysis of HAART-naive patients from eight developing countries and the 
United States found elevated risk of HIV disease progression and mortality in relation to 
VDD/VDI post-HAART initiation in a random sub-sample of 250 patients originally 
recruited for an intervention study of once- vs twice-daily dosing of three HAART regimens 
[14]. More information is needed regarding the role of vitamin-D on HIV disease 
progression, particularly among HIV-infected adults from sub-Saharan Africa where micro-
nutrient deficiencies are more common. To inform these gaps, we quantified the association 
between baseline vitamin-D status and absolute changes in CD4+T-cell counts from 
enrollment through 18 months in HIV-positive adults on HAART for less than 6 months at 
enrollment. Secondarily, we determined whether the type of HAART regimen, age at

 enrollment, nutritional status and multivitamin use modified any association between 
vitamin-D status and CD4+T-cell count recovery. We hypothesize that absolute CD4+T-cell 
gain will be higher among baseline VDS in comparison with VDD/VDI patients.
2. Methods
This is a longitudinal analysis of the effects of vitamin-D status-related differences on 
CD4+T-cell recovery among adult HIV-positive patients undergoing treatment at the 
Infectious Disease Institute (IDI) in Kampala, Uganda. The parent study was a randomized 
double-blind placebo-controlled trial of daily micro-nutrient supplementation including 
vitamins B-complex, C, and E vs placebo. Participants (N = 400) were HIV-positive men 
and non-pregnant women at least 18 years old starting HAART at enrollment or had been on 
HAART for no longer than 6 months. Each participant provided written informed consent, 
and resided within 20 km of IDI. Excluded from the trial at enrollment were pregnant 
women and the seriously ill (i.e. bed-ridden or in too critical a health condition to 
comprehend the study protocol), unable or unwilling to provide written informed consent 
and all HAART-ineligible (i.e. free of AIDS-defining conditions and had CD4 cell counts 
>350 cells/μl) HIV-positive adults. The parent trial was implemented between April 2010 
and December 2012. Each patient was followed for 18 months, until loss to follow-up or 
death—whichever occurred first. Details of the design and methods used in the parent trial 
have been described elsewhere [15]. The present analysis includes 398 patients for whom 
baseline vitamin-D status was determined.
Ethical Approval for the trial was provided by the Scientific Review Committee of IDI; the 
Institutional Review Boards of Harvard School of Public Health and that of Makerere 
University School of Public Health. The sponsors of the parent study were not involved in 
the design, implementation and interpretation of results for this analysis.
2.1. Measurements & variable definitions
2.1.1. CD4+T-cell count—CD4+T-cell count was evaluated at months 0, 3, 6, 12 and 18 
in all participants as the primary indicator of immune recovery using a FACS Calibur flow 
cytometer (Becton–Dickinson, San Jose, CA). For the purpose of this investigation, CD4+T-
cell counts (in cells/μl) were evaluated as a linear response variable.
2.1.2. Vitamin-D status—Levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin-D (25(OH)D) were measured at 
baseline by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-
MS/MS) using an API-5000 (AB Sciex, Foster City, CA) at the Children's Hospital, Boston 
[18]. Serum samples were first extracted and ‘cleaned up’ using the Aria-TLX-2 (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) after which 50 μl was mixed with acetonitrile containing 
internal standard of 25(OH)D3. Samples were then centrifuged and 50 μl of the supernatant 
was injected into the Aria-TLX-2, passed through a Cyclone-P column (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific), and then eluted through a Kinetex C column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). The 
eluate was injected into the API-5000 for atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and 
passed through the triple quadruple mass spectrometer for detection and quantified 
measurements. The assay is linear up to 100 ng/ml, and sensitive to 1 ng/ml. For analytic 
purposes, three vitamin-D thresholds were defined in light of prior studies [19,20] and a

 level of 25(OH)D was considered optimal for calcium homeostasis [21] as follows: VDD if 
25(OH)D ≤ 20 ng/ml, VDI if 25(OH)D > 20 but < 32 ng/ml, and vitamin-D sufficient (VDS) 
if 25(OH)D ≥ 32 ng/ml with VDS as the reference group for all analyses.
2.1.3. Other covariates—Time was categorically defined based on timing of repeated 
CD4 assessment in months as: 0, 3, 6, 12 and 18. CD4+T-cell change was operationally 
defined as increases relative to month 0. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect 
socio-demographic, clinical and health data at enrollment and months 3, 6, 12 and 18.
2.2. Statistical analyses
We implemented multivariable random effects linear mixed regression models to quantify 
associations between vitamin-D status and changes in CD4+T-cell count over 18 months. 
Baseline CD4+T-cell was included in the outcome matrix; no assumption was made 
regarding the relationship between vitamin-D status and CD4+T-cell count at baseline given 
our observational study design [23]. An unstructured covariance matrix was assumed to 
account for non-independence of repeated CD4+T-cell counts within individuals. A random 
intercept was specified to allow within-subject differences in the trajectory of CD4+T-cell 
recovery for each participant. Empirical standard errors were used to derive robust estimates 
of effect and mitigate potential misspecification of the covariance matrix. We tested a global 
hypothesis of no vitamin-D-related difference in absolute CD4 over time at α = 0.05. In 
addition, we estimated VDD- and VDI-associated differences in absolute CD4 compared to 
VDS status at months 3, 6, 12 and 18 using a more conservative threshold of α = 0.01 to 
minimize the likelihood of obtaining spurious statistical significance in respective intervals 
by vitamin-D status.
To address confounders in estimating the relationship between baseline vitamin-D status and 
change in CD4 cell count, we adjusted for the following factors measured at baseline: 
baseline body mass index (BMI) in four categories (≤0.5,18.5 < BMI ≤ 25, 25 < BMI < 30, 
and BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), anemia (defined as < 12 g/dl for women and <13 g/dl for men) [16], 
behavioral factors (smoking, drinking, self-reported multivitamin and bed-net use at 
enrollment), socio-demographic characteristics (age at enrollment, sex, income, marital 
status, and self-reported smoking and drinking), allocation to supplementation with vitamins 
B, C and E vs placebo in the parent study, and time. We examined heterogeneity in the 
association between vitamin-D status and change in CD4+T-cell count by the following 
baseline factors: micronutrient intervention status, sex, age, BMI, and baseline ART status 
using differences in likelihood ratio tests between nested models to evaluate heterogeneity. 
When the P-value associated with difference in likelihood ratio test between nested models 
was <0.05, we stratified by levels of the effect modifier. All analyses were implemented in 
Statistical Analyses Software (SAS) version 9.3.
3. Results
Our sample included 398 patients with baseline vitamin-D data and repeated CD4+T-cell 
assessments. Half of the participants were antiretroviral treatment naïve at enrollment. Of 
the 50% on HAART at enrollment, the median duration on ART was 0.2 (interquartile range: 
0–1.9) months with most on nevirapine (62.8%) or efavirenz (35.7%) containing HAART

 regimen. The majority of enrollees were female (73%), had elementary or lower level of 
education (54%) and were VDI or VDD at enrollment (77%). Most participants were of 
normal weight and there was no difference by vitamin-D status with respect to CD4, BMI or 
hemoglobin at baseline. Self-reported multivitamin use was higher, whereas prevalent ART 
exposure was lower, in VDS patients at enrollment. Further details of the study population 
are provided in Table 1.
Patients were followed-up for a median of 18 months with no difference in follow-up 
duration by vitamin-D status. CD4+T-cell count rose steadily from a baseline average of 
150.5 cells/μl (standard deviation (SD) = 99.9 cells/μl) to the 18th-month cohort-wide 
average of 296.8 cells/μl (SD = 158.4). However, absolute CD4+T-cell values were 
persistently lower for patients that were VDD/VDI relative to HIV+ patients that were VDS 
at study entry (P-value = 0.010, Fig. 1). Specifically, the overall absolute increase in CD4+T-
cell count from enrollment to 18 months was 109.1 cells/μl (SD = 17.5), 143.8 cells/μl (SD = 
15.5) and 178 cells/μl (SD = 20.7), respectively, for participants who were VDD, VDI and 
VDS at enrollment. The mean and standard errors of absolute CD4 T-cell count by vitamin-
D status at baseline and each follow-up interval is presented in Table S1. The difference in 
CD4+T-cell recovery at each follow-up interval for patients with VDD/VDI compared to 
those who were VDS at enrollment is shown in Table 2. In general, the absolute CD4+T-
cells recovered declined dose-dependently and significantly, in all follow-up periods as 
baseline vitamin-D levels worsened (vitamin-D*time, P-value < 0.001) (Table 2).
The VDD/VDI-associated difference in absolute CD4+T-cells recovered varied significantly 
by age (age*vitamin-D*Time: P-value = 0.009) and BMI category (BMI*vitamin-D*time, P 
= 0.044) but not by randomization to multi-vitamins B,C and E vs placebo 
(supplementation*vitamin-D*time, P = 0.382; Table 3 and Figs. 2 and 3). The VDD/VDI-
associated slower absolute CD4+T-cell recovery was similar for men and women 
(sex*vitamin-D*time, P = 0.522), persons with any vs no HAART experience at enrollment 
(ART status*vitamin-D*time, P = 0.949) and for persons that reported any vs no 
multivitamin use at enrollment (baseline multivitamin use*vitamin*time, P = 0.841; data not 
shown).
In age-stratified analyses, the VDI/VDD-associated lower absolute CD4+T-cell recovery 
was strongest for participants 35 years old or younger among whom VDS patients had 
nearly 100 cells/ml CD4+T-cell advantage compared to VDD patients by month 18 (Fig. 
2A). Among patients 36 years or older, the absolute number of CD4+T-cells recovered (Fig. 
2B) did not differ by baseline vitamin-D status. However, the trend of lower CD4+T-cell 
recovery for VDD vs VDS patients was maintained and attained statistical significance in 
one of five follow-up intervals (Table 3, Fig. 2B).
Among vitamins B, C and E supplemented patients, those VDS vs VDD continued to have 
relative advantage with respect to increase in CD4+T-cells. However, the baseline VDD-
associated absolute change in CD4+T-cell was muted and the overall vitamin-D-associated 
change in CD4 was statistically insignificant (vitamin-D*time, P-value = 0.065). Among 
patients randomized to placebo on the other hand, the impact of baseline VDD on change in 
CD4+T-cell count over 18 months was strong (vitamin-D*time, P-value = 0.005). The

 magnitude of CD4+T-cells recovered for VDS vs deficient patients in the placebo group is at 
least 2.5-times higher in comparison to the same contrast at comparable follow-up periods 
for patients randomized to micronutrient supplementation with vitamins B, C and E (Table 
3).
The overall trend of VDD-related deficits in CD4+T-cell recovery is maintained among 
participants with BMI <25 kg/m2 at enrollment (vitamin-D*time, P-value = 0.003) with 
statistical significance attained in three of four follow-up intervals (Table 3). Among patients 
who were obese or overweight at enrollment, baseline vitamin-D-dependent change in CD4 
cell count during follow-up was also evident (vitamin-D*time, P-value = 0.050). Within 
respective follow-up intervals, statistical significance was not attained for any contrast. Of 
note, the magnitude of CD4 recovery at months 3 and 6 were lower for patients who were 
VDD vs VDS at enrollment. Between months 12 and 18, however, average CD4 T-cell count 
was higher for VDD vs VDS; VDI participants on the other hand maintained higher mean 
CD4 cell counts in all intervals relative to VDS patients (Table 3). This trend of superior 
CD4+T-cell gain for baseline VDS compared to VDD patients was maintained among 
patients of baseline BMI < 25 kg/m2 with the absolute advantage in number of CD4+T-cells 
gained ranging from a minimum of 38 cells/μl at month 12 to a maximum of 82 cells/μl at 
month 18 (Fig. 3A). In patients overweight or obese at study entry, an early non-significant 
CD4+T-cell recovery advantage for VDS vs VDD enrollees was evident until month 6 with a 
reversal in absolute CD4 recovered evident by months 12 and 18 for overweight or obese 
VDS vs VDD patients (Fig. 3B).
4. Discussion
In this sample of HIV-positive adults, nearly eight out of 10 participants began HAART 
either VDD or VDI. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis-D observed in this study is 
comparable to the 72–75% previously reported prevalence in HIV-infected samples from 
South Africa and Malawi [1,2] but is considerably higher than the 37–57% prevalence 
previously reported for Uganda and other African settings [3–5]. In this study, the average 
CD4+T-cell values were comparable by vitamin-D status at enrollment. By Month 18, 
average CD4+T-cell counts doubled from a baseline average of 150 cells/μl to 300 cells/μl as 
patients either continued or were initiated on HAART from enrollment. In line with our 
study hypothesis, the absolute magnitude of CD4+T-cells recovered was persistently lower 
for baseline VDD and VDI in comparison with baseline VDS patients. This VDD-associated 
lower absolute CD4+T-cell recovery varied by age and nutritional status with the absolute 
difference in CD4+T-cell recovery most pronounced among patients 35 years or younger and 
those with BMI less than 25 kg/m2 at enrollment. Among patients overweight or obese at 
enrollment, baseline VDD status was variably associated with absolute CD4+T-cell gain 
during follow-up in comparison with HIV+ overweight or obese patients VDS at enrollment. 
Randomization to concurrent supplementation to vitamins B, C and E vs placebo did not 
independently predict CD4+T-cell recovery. However, the receipt of these micronutrients 
moderated, but did not eliminate, VDD-associated slower absolute CD4+T-cell recovery rate 
during follow-up.

 Only a few epidemiologic studies (all observational with equivocal and inconsistent results), 
have evaluated associations between vitamin-D levels and CD4+T-cell count in HIV-infected 
adults [5,12,17–21]. Our finding of VDD-associated slower CD4+T-cell recovery is 
inconsistent with a previously reported lack of association between vitamin-D and CD4+T-
cell recovery among HIV-infected African adults [5,17], and with a longitudinal study of an 
ethnically diverse sample of HIV-positive patients from The Netherlands [21]. Similarly, our 
study findings do not support the results from one longitudinal study [21] and two cross-
sectional studies that found no association between VDD and CD4+T-cell levels in HIV-
infected adults from Uganda [17] and the United States [19]. The exact reason for this 
divergence in results—particularly for the prospective studies including African HIV-
positive results—is unclear. We speculate that sample variation by CD4 in baseline vitamin-
D levels, HIV disease stage, local dietary patterns and ability to rigorously control for 
important confounders could partially contribute to these differences.
However, our finding of VDD-associated lower absolute CD4 recovery is similar to cross-
sectional reports of VDD-associated severe immune deficiency among French HIV-infected 
adults [18] and directly corroborates findings from one longitudinal multinational [14] study 
and two prospective studies in HIV-infected adults from the United States [12,20]. In the 
multi-national study, VDD/VDI was associated with incidence of AIDS-defining events, 
virologic failure and death over 96 weeks of follow-up. They found associations-albeit not-
statistically significant, between VDI/VDD and elevated risk of immunologic failure. 
Among 204 women in the Interagency HIV study, VDI was associated with 80% lower 
likelihood of high CD4+T-cell recovery after 2 years on ART [20] and higher baseline 
vitamin-D levels were associated with greater absolute increases in CD4+T-cell values 
during follow-up of 156 adults stable on HAART for at least 24 weeks at enrollment in 
another study [12]. Our larger sample size, comparable baseline CD4 values across vitamin-
D categories, prospective follow-up design, the stability and dose-dependence of CD4 T-cell 
recovery according to the severity of hypovitaminosis-D, and the fact that our associations 
were robust to adjustment for multiple confounders are important strengths suggestive of 
VDD as a component cause of impaired CD4T + cell recovery in this sample. In spite of 
these strengths, we are unable to exclude the possibility of residual confounding by 
unmeasured factors given our observational design. Of note, vitamin-D status was assessed 
at baseline only and may evolve significantly once HIV-positive patients are started on 
HAART. The extra-skeletal impacts of vitamin-D including its role in maintaining immune 
system homeostasis through enhancement of innate immune responses, regulation of 
inflammatory cascade, direct impact on T-cell activation, and its capacity to modify the 
phenotype and function of antigen-presenting cells have been noted in the context of 
infectious and chronic morbidities [22]. In spite of the existing biologically plausible 
mechanisms described, whether vitamin-D deficiency further impinges on the general state 
of immune vulnerability in HIV, is predominantly a manifestation of HIV-related 
pathogenesis or both are important but yet unresolved questions. Therefore, specifically 
designed longitudinal and intervention studies in well-characterized populations with 
repeated vitamin-D assessment are needed to clarify the impact of vitamin-D status and its 
variation during HAART on CD4+T-cell recovery.

 Our study provides new information regarding age and nutritional status as potential 
modifiers of any adverse VDD-related impact on immune recovery. The observations that 
VDD was associated with more dysregulation of absolute CD4+T-cell recovery in younger 
patients, and that the absolute amount and speed of improvement differed by pre-treatment 
nutritional status are similar to prior reports of age and BMI-related differences in immune 
recovery among HIV and tuberculosis co-infected Ugandan adults [23]. These age and 
nutritional status interactions in VDD-/VDI-associated lower CD4+T-cell recovery suggests 
that previously reported age-related immune recovery advantage in younger HIV-infected 
adults [24] maybe compromised by malnutrition [25,26]. The observation that the VDD-/
VDI-associated slower rate of immune recovery was particularly strong in the absence of 
vitamins B, C and E supplementation suggests that the adverse impact of vitamin-D 
deficiency on absolute CD4 recovery could be partly moderated by repletion with these 
micronutrients as previously reported [27–30]. Overall, the presence of these age- and 
nutritional-status-related heterogeneities in VDD vs VDS association with immune recovery 
suggests that any future interventions to mitigate potentially adverse effects of 
hypovitaminosis-D could be enhanced by targeting participants who are 35 years old or 
younger and those who are normal or underweight at enrollment.
In summary, we report for the first time, a strong VDD-associated deficit in the absolute 
number of CD4+T-cells recovered over 18 months' follow-up in HIV-infected African adults 
on HAART. This relationship was strongest among participants 35 years old or younger and 
those who were underweight or normal weight at enrollment. Supplementation with 
vitamins B, C and E partially mitigated but did not eliminate these VDD-associated 
disadvantages in immune recovery. Supplementation with vitamin-D may improve immune 
recovery in HIV-infected adults on HAART. Multi-micronutrient cocktails including 
vitamins D, B, C and E may provide additive benefits. The safety and efficacy of such 
interventions should be evaluated in future randomized placebo controlled trials.
