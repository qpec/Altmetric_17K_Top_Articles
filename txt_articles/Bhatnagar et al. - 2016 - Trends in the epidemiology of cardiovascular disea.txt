ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the UK is
declining; however, CVD burden comes not only from
deaths, but also from those living with the disease. This
review uses national datasets with multiple years of data
to present secular trends in mortality, morbidity, and
treatment for all CVD and specific subtypes within the
UK. We produced all-ages and premature age-
standardised mortality rates by gender, standardised to
the 2013 European Standard Population, using data
from the national statistics agencies of the UK. We
obtained data on hospital admissions from the National
Health Service records, using the main diagnosis.
Prevalence data come from the Quality and Outcome
Framework and national surveys. Total CVD mortality
declined by 68% between 1980 and 2013 in the UK.
Similar decreases were seen for coronary heart disease
and stroke. Coronary heart disease prevalence has
remained constant at around 3% in England and 4% in
Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Hospital
admissions for all CVD increased by over 46 000
between 2010/2011 and 2013/2014, with more than
36 500 of these increased admissions for men. Hospital
admission trends vary by country and CVD condition.
CVD prescriptions and operations have increased over
the last decade. CVD mortality has declined notably for
both men and women while hospital admissions have
increased. CVD prevalence shows little evidence of
change. This review highlights that improvements in the
burden of CVD have not occurred equally between the
four constituent countries of the UK, or between men
and women.
INTRODUCTION
In 2014, cardiovascular disease (CVD) was the
second main cause of death in the UK.1 The Global
Burden of Disease (GBD) study has shown that the
burden of CVD is declining in the UK;2 between
1990 and 2013 CVD death rates in England
declined by 52%, coronary heart disease (CHD) by
60%, and stroke by 46%. The GBD study com-
pares mortality, disability adjusted life-years, years
of life lost, and years lived with disability between
1990 and 2013 for England and its regions, but the
GBD visualisation tool also provides this informa-
tion for W
ales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. To
further understand the burden of CVD in the UK,
we aim to report trends in age-standardised mortal-
ity, prevalence, and treatment rates for CVD, CHD,
and stroke for England, W
ales, Scotland, and
Northern Ireland over a number of years.
Previous studies have reported changes in CVD
incidence,
prevalence,
and
treatment.
A
study
linking hospital admissions and mortality data
showed that within England, a 50% decline in
age-standardised mortality from myocardial infarc-
tion was due to both a reduction in incidence and
case fatality.3 These changes in mortality and inci-
dence are likely to have affected treatment and the
prevalence
of
CVD,
especially
its
two
most
common subtypes, CHD and stroke. A study using
the General Practice Research Database (GPRD)
compared prevalence of CHD in 1999 and 2007 in
England in those aged over 25 years4 and found a
decrease in the prevalence of CHD, from 1.74
million CHD patients in 1999 to 1.53 million
CHD patients in 2007. The British Regional Heart
Study (BRHS) reports that in men aged 40–59
years there was no clear trend between 1979 and
1996 in the diagnosis of CHD.5
This review is based on the 2015 Cardiovascular
Disease Statistics report published for the British
Heart
Foundation;
although
there
are
more
detailed and online supplementary data presented
in this review, we use national datasets that are col-
lected annually to allow patterns in trends over
time to be observed, rather than comparing two
separate years as has been done previously. When
possible, we have presented this trend data by
gender, for the UK as a whole and for England,
Scotland, W
ales, and Northern Ireland separately,
resulting in a more detailed observation of secular
trends in the burden of CVD in the UK than has
been previously presented. W
e present mortality
trends
that
are
age-standardised
to
the
2013
European Standard Population (ESP) for the first
time, an update from the 1976 ESP
. W
e also
present trends in different measures of prevalence,
hospital admissions, and treatment for CVD, CHD,
and stroke.
METHODS
W
e present trends in mortality from the introduc-
tion of ICD 9, the ninth International Classification
of Diseases (1979), through to the latest year avail-
able at the time of writing. Trends in hospital
admissions, prevalence, and treatment data are
reported from the earliest year available.
W
e obtained mortality and population data by
5 year age group and sex on total CVD, CHD, and
stroke from the national statistics agencies of the
UK. Using this, we produced all ages and under 75
age-standardised mortality rates by gender, directly
age-standardised to the 2013 ESP
. Stata V
.13 was
used to age-standardise the mortality data.
W
e present prevalence data from three sources
on which no extra analyses were performed. The
Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) is col-
lected annually through general practice records.
The QOF rewards general practices for keeping
records on the number of patients on their registers

 who have been diagnosed with particular conditions. The
Health Surveys of England and Scotland ask specific questions
about the prevalence of CVD, CHD, and stroke, although these
questions are not asked annually. The General Lifestyle Survey
(GLS) ended in 2011 and was an annual cross-sectional survey
for Great Britain that included questions on whether people had
certain conditions. All three of these surveys are sampled so
they are nationally representative and all collect self-reported
measures
on
the
prevalence
of
CVD
through
household
interviews.
W
e obtained data on hospital admissions from National
Health Service records using the main diagnosis attributed to a
patient on being discharged from hospital; in the main paper
we report finished consultant episodes (FCEs), which include
both ordinary admissions and day cases. W
e refer to FCEs as
‘admissions’ in this review, but it is important to note that FCEs
are distinct from ordinary admissions. The online supplemen-
tary files contain more detailed FCEs for England only and do
not include day cases. Community pharmacist prescriptions data
are from Prescriptions Cost Analyses, published by the UK
national statistics agencies and health services. Operations data
come from the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society and
the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgery in Great Britain &
Ireland.
TRENDS IN MORTALITY
Figures 1–3 show that age-standardised CVD, CHD, and stroke
death rates declined notably between 1979 and 2013 in the UK,
and that there were persistent differences in the absolute rates
between the four countries of the UK. For the UK, total CVD
mortality declined by 70% between 1979 and 2013, CHD mor-
tality decreased by 72%, and mortality from stroke decreased by
71% between 1979 and 2013 (data available in online supple-
mentary files). Trends in age-standardised premature mortality
(aged under 75 years) from CVD, CHD, and stroke mortality
are presented in the online supplementary tables and show that
there were large decreases in premature mortality from these
conditions between 1979 and 2013. There was a 78% reduction
in premature CVD mortality, 81% decrease in premature CHD
mortality, and an 80% decline in premature stroke mortality.
Between 1979 and 2013, total CVD mortality decreased by
70% in England and 69% in W
ales and Scotland. Northern
Ireland had the largest decline with a 75% decrease in CVD
mortality between these years; in 1979 Northern Ireland had
the highest CVD death rate in the UK, but by 2013 only
England had a lower CVD death rate. CVD mortality in those
under 75 years of age follows a similar pattern, with the largest
reduction occurring in Northern Ireland at 83%.
CHD mortality at all ages decreased by 72% in England,
70% in W
ales, 71% in Scotland, and 76% in Northern Ireland
between 1979 and 2013. Premature CHD mortality followed a
similar pattern, with the largest declines in Northern Ireland
(84%) and the smallest in W
ales (79%). The largest decrease
was in women in Northern Ireland, with a reduction of 87%
for premature CHD mortality between 1979 and 2013.
As with CVD and CHD, there were large declines in total
and premature mortality from stroke between 1979 and 2013
for all UK nations. England saw a 71% decrease, W
ales 72%,
Scotland 70%, and Northern Ireland 74%. The largest decline
was for men in Northern Ireland who had a decrease in stroke
mortality of 77%. This pattern is mirrored for stroke mortality
under 75 with the largest declines in Northern Ireland (84%)
and the smallest in Scotland (79%).
TRENDS IN PREVALENCE
QOF data show that the prevalence of CHD remained constant
at around 3% in England and 4% in Scotland, W
ales, and
Northern Ireland between 2004/2005 and 2014/2015. The
prevalence of stroke has also changed little, remaining at around
2%, although there is an indication of a small increase for
England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland (table 1). Figure 4 pre-
sents prevalence data from the health surveys for England and
Scotland from 2003 to 2013; although the pattern of Scotland
having a higher prevalence than England remains, overall the
surveys show a higher prevalence than that reported by QOF
data.
As with QOF data, CHD prevalence as measured by health
surveys has remained stable with a slight decline since 2003 for
both England and Scotland. In the health surveys, stroke preva-
lence has not increased in England. In Scotland, however, there
has been a larger increase than as measured by QOF data.
Online supplementary data show trends by gender within
England and Scotland. These show that men in England have
had a slightly higher increase in stroke prevalence as compared
to women. The Scottish Health Survey indicates that CVD
prevalence dropped for women in 2008, but not for men.
However, CVD prevalence climbed again for women so that
2013 prevalence rates were similar between the two genders.
The GLS has data on CVD prevalence from 1988 to 2011 for
Great Britain (figure 5). Although the prevalence is higher than
that reported in the health surveys, the GLS provides trends by
age and sex. These data suggest that there has been an increase
in CVD prevalence for both men and women aged over 75 and
for men aged 65–74. CVD prevalence for men aged 16–64 has
remained constant, but for women aged 45–64 there was a
small decrease from 10.8% to 8.4%.
TRENDS IN TREATMENT
Table 2 shows that numbers of admissions (finished consultant
episodes which include ordinary admissions and day cases) for
all CVD increased by over 46 000 between 2010/2011 and
2013/2014 in the UK; however, over 36 500 of these increased
admissions were in men (presented in online supplementary
tables).
Between
these
years,
male
admissions
for
CHD
increased by almost 3000, but decreased by around 5000 in
women. Stroke admissions remained steady for men and
decreased by around 4500 in women.
Between 2005/2006 and 2013/2014, both England and W
ales
experienced an increase in the total number of CVD admissions
by 11% and 15%, respectively, but patterns differ for CHD and
stroke. W
ales experienced a 4% increase in admissions for CHD
over this period; however, this was driven entirely by an
increase in male admissions, with a 6% decrease in CHD admis-
sions for women. In England, admissions for CHD decreased by
6% overall, with a 4% decrease for men but an 11% decrease
for women. Stroke admissions increased in England by 13% in
men and by 6% in women. In W
ales increases in stroke admis-
sions also differed by gender, with a 7% increase for women
but a 17% increase for men.
Data for Scotland are available from 2009/2010 and show a
3% increase in CHD admissions and a 14% decrease in admis-
sions for stroke during this period. Northern Ireland hospital
admission data are available between 2010/2011 and 2013/
2014 and show a 6% increase in CHD admissions; this was
largely driven by an increase in male admissions, with an 8%
increase during this period for men, but a 2% increase for
women. Stroke admissions in Northern Ireland decreased by

 31%, which equates to around 1500 fewer admissions during
this period, split fairly evenly between men and women.
Trends in prescriptions for CVD are presented in the online
supplementary tables. Between 1991 and 2014 in England the
number of prescriptions for diseases of the circulatory system
increased by around 243 million or 78%. Between 2005 and
2014, CVD prescriptions in W
ales increased by around 5.5
million (23%), by 2.3 million (9%) in Scotland, and by 2.5
million (28%) in Northern Ireland.
The number of surgical interventions for CVD increased
between 1980 and 2013 (figure 6). In 2013 there were more
than seven times the number of percutaneous coronary interven-
tions (PCI) as compared to two decades earlier (1993). The
number of coronary artery bypass grafts reached a peak in the
late 1990s but have since decreased by 33%, having been over-
taken by PCI as the major coronary surgery.
DISCUSSION
Age-standardised mortality from CVD, CHD, and stroke has
declined by around 70% over the last 30 years, with even larger
declines in premature mortality. Northern Ireland has seen the
largest decreases of all UK countries. CVD prevalence appears
to have increased slightly in England and Scotland, and data for
Great Britain shows the largest increases were in men and
women aged over 65. CHD prevalence shows evidence of a
small decline over the past decade, while stroke prevalence
increased slightly in all UK countries. Hospital admissions for
CVD increased over the last decade, although patterns differed
for CHD and stroke, with increases seen for some UK countries.
The numbers of prescriptions and operations for CVD have
increased over the last 20–30 years.
The GBD study compared mortality rates in 1990 to those in
2013, and standardised to the GBD 2013 standard population.2
When standardised to the 2013 ESP
, between the same years
our data showed greater decreases in CVD, CHD, and stroke
mortality than the GBD; however, the use of a different stand-
ard population and slightly different methods may explain the
differences. These large declines in CVD, CHD, and stroke
mortality are consistent with other countries in both Europe6
and the USA.7
The BRHS and a GPRD study have both compared CHD
prevalence between 2 years to give an estimate of time trends
(1979 to 1996 and 1999 to 2007, respectively). The findings
from the BRHS are in line with the trends reported here which
indicated little evidence of a change in CHD prevalence over
the last decade.5 The GPRD study reported a decrease in abso-
lute numbers of patients living in the community with CHD.4
These two studies use different data sources, age ranges, and
time periods, therefore the discrepancy in their findings may be
due to these differences. The GPRD study used a sample of
general practice records for those aged over 25, whereas the
BRHS asked men from 24 British towns in a longitudinal
cohort who were aged 40–59 at recruitment to recall if they
have ever had a diagnosis of CHD. The age-specific trends pre-
sented in figure 2 indicate an increase in CVD prevalence in
only the older age groups over the past 20 years, but it is feas-
ible that this trend is driven more by stroke prevalence than
CHD prevalence.
A study using the GPRD to assess changes in stroke incidence
and prevalence reported a 12.5% increase in stroke prevalence
between 1999 and 2008.8 These findings are in line with the
trends we report in this review, which found an increase in

W
e do not report directly on incidence trends in this review,
although FCEs can be used as a proxy for incidence. For
England, Smolina et al3 report a 33% and 31% decline in the
incidence of myocardial infarction in men and women, respect-
ively, between 2002 and 2010, using hospital episodes linked to
mortality data. Although we report on CHD rather than myo-
cardial infarction, trends in FCEs alone also showed a decrease
between 2005/2006 and 2013/2014 for men and women in
England. Pearson-Stuttard et al4 compared trends in hospital
admissions for acute myocardial infarction between 1999 and
2007 in England and reported a decrease of around 8000
admissions for both men and women. The decreases we report
for CHD demonstrate the same pattern in England, with a
decrease in FCEs for CHD over the last decade.
Trends in the incidence of stroke have been reported on using
the GPRD and an Oxfordshire based primary care dataset.
GPRD data compared 1998 and 2008 and showed a 30%
decrease in stroke incidence for the UK during this period.8 The
Oxford
Vascular
Study
reported
on
stroke
incidence
in
Oxfordshire by comparing rates between 1981 and 1984 with
those between 2001 and 2004.9 During this 20 year period they
report a 29% reduction in stroke incidence (first stroke only),
which corroborates the GPRD study findings. The data we
present here are for a later time period but also indicate that
there was an overall decline in UK stroke admissions.
There were differential trends in stroke admissions between
the countries of the UK. England and W
ales admissions data are
for a longer time period (2005/2006 to 2013/2014), whereas
Scotland and Northern Ireland data are from 2009/2010 and
2010/2011, respectively. Using the period between 2010/2011
and 2013/2014 only, stroke admissions in England do show a
decline, particularly for women, but a small increase in admis-
sions is still evident for W
ales. A 2010 systematic review of
stroke incidence in the UK reported that there is limited infor-
mation on how stroke incidence varies by region of the UK, but
that from the five studies included in the review, patterns of inci-
dence rates largely mirror patterns of stroke mortality rates
around the UK.10 Data in our review demonstrate that stroke
mortality rates have decreased. Although 2011 to 2013 only
includes 3 years of data, the decrease in stroke mortality
between these years was 2% in W
ales, compared to 8% in
England, 5% in Scotland, and 7% in Northern Ireland, suggest-
ing that a different trend of stroke incidence in W
ales may
indeed be present for the most recent years.
Despite large decreases in mortality, increases in CVD, CHD,
and stroke prevalence were small, with the exception of men
over 75 who saw a 10 percentage point increase. Mortality
from myocardial infarction has reduced over the last decade;
50% of this decrease is attributed to decreases in incidence and
50% is due to improved case fatality.3 Therefore it is possible
that the decreased incidence has offset the increases in survival,
which would lead to increased prevalence.
There were persistent differences between countries in the
overall burden of CVD, with Scotland having a consistently
higher burden. Scotland has higher levels of deprivation than
the other UK countries, which are a potential explanation for
the higher mortality and prevalence levels. The England GBD

 study showed that different measures of disease burden mir-
rored deprivation rates.2 A pooled analysis of 18 cohort studies
found that for excess mortality in Scotland, as compared to
England, only 25% was explicable by socioeconomic, behav-
ioural, anthropological or biological risk factors;11 therefore
higher mortality rates in Scotland may also be due to differences
in hospital access, ambulance services or case-fatality rates.
The National Service Framework for CHD outlined prior-
ities to be achieved between 2000 and 2010, which included
identifying and treating people at high risk, increasing the use
of effective medicines for people following a cardiac event,
and increasing the number of revascularisations. The increases
seen in prescriptions and revascularisation operations in this
review indicate that the implementation of this framework was

 successful. However, it is important to note that these data do
not account for increases in population, which are also likely
to be a significant contributing factor. This review on trends in
the burden of CVD, CHD, and stroke aimed to include the
best
available
data;
there
are,
however,
a
number
of
weaknesses. QOF data may be subject to changes in clinical
case finding by general practitioners or differences in clinical
coding practices.12 Other sources of prevalence data such as
the Clinical Practice Research Database may have similar issues,
although this dataset only samples 7% of the UK population.13
Prevalence reports from surveys face problems of accurately
recalling both the type and date of diagnoses. Ideally we
would have reported sex-specific trends in prevalence for all
data but QOF data are not available by sex. Finished consult-
ant episodes (both ordinary admissions and day cases) are a
proxy for incidence as they do not count people who died
before
reaching
hospital
and
do
not
distinguish
between
people with a first event or a recurring event. W
e were also
unable to provide age-standardised hospital admission rates as
these data were not available by age group. Consequently, both
hospital admissions and all treatment trends do not take
account of the increase in population over time. Prescriptions
data include prescriptions that may have been provided as sec-
ondary prevention for people identified as being at high risk
for a CVD event; therefore this should be noted when using
the data as a measure of existing burden.
The strengths of this review are that we present the first long-
term age-standardised trends in CVD, CHD, and stroke using
the 2013 ESP
. Despite its limitations, the trend data we present
use routinely collected national data and include a number of
years, rather than just comparing 2 years, therefore allowing for
measurement of changes in trends over time.
CONCLUSION
Despite large reductions in mortality from CVD, CHD, and
stroke, these conditions have remained a substantial burden to
the UK, with rises in treatment and hospital admissions for all
CVD. There is some evidence that improvements have not
occurred equally for men and women or between the countries
of the UK. Although these are promising trends for mortality
and stroke admissions in women, prevalence and treatment are
increasing over time for all CVD and stroke. Better monitoring
of trends in the prevalence and incidence of CVD, CHD, and
stroke over time is needed. This review highlights that improve-
ments in the burden of CVD have not occurred equally.
Understanding why trends have differed among subpopulations
will be valuable for continuing the reduction in the incidence of
and mortality from CVD, CHD, and stroke.

What is already known about this subject?
Cardiovascular disease mortality declined during the 20th
century, changing from being the main cause of death to being
the second main cause of death in the UK. Coronary heart
disease by itself is still the single biggest cause of death in
the UK. Overall, cardiovascular disease is still a large burden
in the UK.
What does this study add?
We present updated trends in cardiovascular mortality for the
UK, standardised to the 2013 European Standard Population.
We compare the trends in mortality to trends in prevalence,
hospital admissions, and treatments to give an overall view of
how the burden of cardiovascular disease has changed over
time in the UK.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
It is important for clinicians to understand how the overall
burden of cardiovascular disease in the UK is changing over
time between men and women, and between England,
Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
