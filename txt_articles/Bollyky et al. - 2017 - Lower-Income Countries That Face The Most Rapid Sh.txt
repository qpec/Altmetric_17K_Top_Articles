Lower-Income Countries That
Face The Most Rapid Shift In
Noncommunicable Disease Burden
Are Also The Least Prepared
ABSTRACT Demographic and epidemiological changes are shifting the
disease burden from communicable to noncommunicable diseases in
lower-income countries. Within a generation, the share of disease burden
attributed to noncommunicable diseases in some poor countries will
exceed 80 percent, rivaling that of rich countries, but this burden is
likely to affect much younger people in poorer countries. The health
systems of lower-income countries are unprepared for this change.
We examined the shift to noncommunicable diseases and estimated
preparedness for the shift by ranking 172 nations using a health system
capacity index for noncommunicable disease. We project that the
countries with the greatest increases in the share of disease burden
attributable to noncommunicable disease over the next twenty-five years
will also be the least prepared for the change, as they ranked low on our
capacity index and are expected to have the smallest increases in national
health spending. National governments and donors must invest more in
preparing the health systems of lower-income countries for the dramatic
shift to noncommunicable diseases and in reducing modifiable
noncommunicable disease risks.
T
he combination of demographic
and
epidemiological changes is
producing rapid shifts in the dis-
ease profile of many low-income
nations. Cancers, diabetes, cardio-
vascular diseases, chronic respiratory illnesses,
and other noncommunicable diseases are on the
rise in low-income countries because of the in-
creased prevalence of key modifiable behavioral
risks, such as unhealthy diets and tobacco use,
and reductions in the infectious diseases that
disproportionately kill children and adolescents.
At the same time, population aging and growth
are amplifying the speed of the shift from com-
municable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional
diseases to noncommunicable diseases.1 Many
poorer
countries
such
as
Bangladesh
and
Botswana are experiencing major reductions
in fertility. As a consequence, between 1980
and 2015 the median age in these countries
increased from seventeen to twenty-six years
and from seventeen to twenty-four years, respec-
tively.2 As the number and share of adults
continue to grow in poor countries, so will the
burden of the noncommunicable diseases that
disproportionately affect them.
The expected pace and scale of the shift in
disease profile to noncommunicable diseases
will present significant challenges to the health
care systems of many lower-income nations.3
Many of these countries have historically fo-
cused on acute care for patients with infectious,
maternal, and neonatal diseases, rather than on
the preventive or chronic care that many non-
communicable diseases require.4,5 Government
health spending remains low in poor nations.

 The average government of a low-income coun-
try spends $23 per person annually on health
(purchasing power parity adjusted).6 In compar-
ison, the US government spends $3,860 per per-
son on health, while the UK government spends
$2,695.7 In many low- and lower-middle-income
countries, most health services and medicines
are still purchased out of pocket or by donors.
In 2014, 29.1 percent of health spending was
financed out of pocket, while 35.7 percent was
financed by donors.6 When prepaid financing is
not available through insurance or via donors,
many important health care services may be too
expensive for poor households.8
With little access to preventive and primary
care,
working-age
people
in
lower-income
nations are more likely to develop and receive
late diagnoses for breast and cervical cancer,
hypertension, and other noncommunicable dis-
eases.9,10 Without access to chronic care and with
limited resources to pay for medical treatment
out of pocket, working-agepeople in theselower-
income countries are more likely to become dis-
abled or die young.
It has long been observed that lower-income
nations are experiencing an epidemiological
transition toward noncommunicable diseases
and that the health systems of many of these
countries are not adequately prepared for that
shift.11–16 Understanding the expected speed and
scale of the shift to noncommunicable diseases
at the country level and using externally validat-
ed data to estimate the preparedness of each
country’s health system for that shift is impor-
tant for the health planning, budgeting, and
policy formulation of national governments. It
is also important for mobilizing more interna-
tional donor support for noncommunicable dis-
eases, which receive only 2 percent of overseas
development assistance for health worldwide.17
We measured the expected speed and scale of
the epidemiological shift to noncommunicable
diseases for 172 countries and the relative pre-
paredness of their national health systems for
that change.We focused on three interconnected
pieces of evidence. First, we calculated the shift
to noncommunicable diseases that occurred in
each country from 1990 to 2015 and projected
the additional shift that can be expected to occur
by 2040.Second, weconnectedthese projections
to expected per capita increases in health spend-
ing for each country. Finally, we constructed the
first health system capacity index for noncom-
municable diseases, adapted from health system
building blocks of the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO), and we compared noncommunica-
ble disease preparedness and expected rates of
health burden.
Study Data And Methods
Population And Aging Data And Projections
Demographic data were extracted from the UN
World Population Prospects database.2 These
data track and predict age-specific populations
for each country in the world through 2100. For
the population forecast, we used the medium
variant, which assumes that nations will under-
go a demographic transition—with child mortal-
ity and total fertility declining and population
growth and aging increasing—at rates similar
to the average country that has undergone such
a transition in the past.
Health Burden Data And Projections Epi-
demiological data were collected from the Global
Burden of Disease 2015 study.1,18 We extracted
age-, sex-, and cause-specific disability-adjusted
life-year (health burden) estimates for 315
causes of disease and disability for 195 countries
in the period 1990–2015. We aggregated these
data
into
three
categories:
communicable,
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases;
noncommunicable diseases; and injuries. For a
list of the noncommunicable diseases included
in these data, see Table 3.3 in the online Ap-
pendix.19
To create simple and transparent mortality
and health burden projections, we calculated
the annualized rate of change from 2005 to
2015 of health burden for the three disease cate-
gories listed above for each country, and for each
sex-specific five-year age group.We used the ob-
served annualized rate of change calculated from
the data for 2005–15 to project health burden
rates for each country and age and sex group
through 2040.We estimated total health burden
by multiplying the World Population Prospects’
projected populations by the projected health
burden rates.
To confirm the robustness of these projec-
tions, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using
an alternative model that forecast all causes of
health burdenexcept HIV/AIDS usingall yearsof
data. In addition, we assessed two other alterna-
tive scenarios, one in which population charac-
teristics remained constant and one in which
noncommunicable disease death rates remained
constant. The results of these additional analyses
are in Figures 2.2.1–13 in the Appendix.19
To illustrate the relative impact of changes in
population size, population aging, and changes
in prevalence of noncommunicable diseases,
we split the increases in disability-adjusted
life-years using demographic decomposition.20
This algebraic method calculated the differences
in standardized rates over time to measure the
relative impact of each of the three factors.

Financing Global Health 2016 database.6,7 Data
and projections are available for 184 countries
for the period 1995–2040.
Noncommunicable Disease Health System
Capacity Index The WHO has specified six
health system building blocks:21 health service
delivery, health workforce, health information
systems, access to essential medicines, health
financing, and leadership and governance. We
constructed a health system capacity index for
noncommunicable disease based on the four
building blocks for which there are externally
validated data, as explained below. Previous
studies have also constructed indices reflecting
the WHO building blocks, but we found none
that
specifically
target
noncommunicable
diseases.22,23
Indicators included in our index are hospital
beds per 1,000 population and number of sur-
geries per 100,000 population (WHO building
block: health service delivery), physicians per
1,000 population and the percentage of births
with skilled attendants (WHO building block:
health workforce), total health expenditure as
a percentage of gross domestic product (WHO
building block: health financing), and a variable
identifying the degree to which each country
has
implemented
tobacco
control
policies
(WHO building block: leadership and gover-
nance). The remaining two building blocks
(health information systems and access to essen-
tial medicines) were not included because exter-
nally validated data for a sufficient number of
countries were not available. The WHO has done
some work to collect information on noncom-
municable disease preparedness indicators for
these two categories, but external validation of
these data has not yet been completed.24–26
The indicators in our index correspond to de-
mands that noncommunicable diseases impose
on national health systems. Most such diseases
are chronic, require health delivery infrastruc-
ture and skilled workforces, and are costly to
treat.27 For example, a recent study in Tanzania
revealed that noncommunicable diseases were
responsible for only 27 percent of the country’s
health burden but for nearly half of its hospital
admissions and hospitalization days.28 Studies
conducted in the United States and New Zealand
showed higher rates of inpatient surgical proce-
dures for the treatment of noncommunicable
diseases than for that of communicable, mater-
nal, and neonatal diseases (34 percent versus
24 percent in the United States and 32 percent
versus 16 percent in New Zealand).29,30 Late di-
agnosis of many cases of cancer, diabetes, and
cardiovascular disease in low-income nations in-
creases the demand for inpatient surgical proce-
dures. Our index includes indicators for the
numbers of hospital beds, surgeries, and physi-
cians, as well as the use of birth attendants, as a
rough proxy for the overall availability of skilled
health workers. The health care financing re-
quired to prevent, diagnose, and treat noncom-
municable diseases is shown in the indicator for
health expenditure, measured by its percentage
of gross domestic product.
We used principal components analysis of the
available data to generate a health system capac-
ity index for 172 countries in 2014. As a sensitiv-
ity analysis, we completed the principal compo-
nents analysis of a subset of countries, using the

 nonvalidated indicator of whether the country
had reported to the WHO that it had a multi-
sectoral, national, and integrated strategy to
manage and prevent noncommunicable diseases
and risk factors. Results of this sensitivity analy-
sis, which are reported in part 2.1 of the Appen-
dix,19 were qualitatively the same as those using
all 172 countries and show that this additional
variable has little impact on the index. A further
exploration of the index’s characteristics is in
Table 1.2.1 in the Appendix.19
All analyses were completed using Stata, ver-
sion 14.1, and R, version 3.3.2.
Limitations Our study had several limita-
tions. First, all data considered for this analysis
are national averages, which potentially mask
inequalities and subnational spatial patterns
within a country.31–33 Although many policy de-
cisions are made at the national level and com-
parisons at this level are quite common, using
national averages hides the variation within
countries and may incorrectly characterize some
individuals.
Second,
forecasting
population
change,
health burden, and health care spending is based
on past trends and assumptions about the future,
which are not certain to be accurate. Even popu-
lation projections, which are the easiest of the
three to undertake, are still methodologically
challenging, require some assumptions, and
can be based on a diverse set of methods that
can lead to a diverse set of forecasts.34–36 We used
changes from 2005 to 2015 in age-specific health
burden to project burden rates to 2040. Using all
available Global Burden of Disease data (for
1990–2015) instead would have inappropriately
exaggerated the expected future HIV burden,
which peaked in 2004–05.37 These methods were
tested using an alternative time period, with
results presented in Appendix Part 2.2.19 The
modeling technique accounted for population
growth, aging, and other expected demographic
changes in each country, but otherwise it made
predictions on the basis of limited information.
We believe that this methodology produced
reliable country-level estimates of future non-
communicable disease burden based on recent
trends, but its use should be replicated as more
detailed and sophisticated forecasts of future
health burden become available.
Third, high-quality data on disease burden in
the poorest countries are limited, especially with
regard to noncommunicable diseases. To miti-
gatethis limitation, the Global Burden of Disease
Study draws upon data and expertise from more
than 2,500 collaborators in 133 countries and

 uses statistical methods to correct for bias and
missing data.
Finally, there is a dearth of comparable and
validated data that focus specifically on national
health systems’ capacity to prevent and treat
noncommunicable diseases. Our methodology
and resulting index assumed that countries with
relatively greater financial investment in health,
hospital infrastructure, tobacco control, physi-
cians, and skilled health workers were better
equipped to deal noncommunicable diseases,
compared to other countries. We believe that
the reasoning behind this assumption is sound,
but future assessments of national health system
capacity would be improved with the use of more
regularly reported and validated data on access
to essential medicines for noncommunicable
diseases, the provision of noncommunicable
disease–specific health services, and control of
important modifiable health risks other than to-
bacco use.
Study Results
Our study had four main results. First, our anal-
ysis showed that low- and lower-middle-income
nations are expected to see dramatic increases in
the burden of premature death and disability
from noncommunicable diseases by 2040 (Ex-
hibit 1). In most geographic regions, these in-
creases will result from large demographic
changes (population aging and growth) that will
not be sufficiently offset by the much more mod-
est improvement in the rates of morbidity and
mortality of noncommunicable diseases (Exhib-
it 2).38 In lower-middle-income nations, most of
the increase in noncommunicable diseases will
be experienced in populations ages thirty-five
and older (Exhibit 1). In low-income nations,
the surge in disability-adjusted life-years (health
burden) lost to noncommunicable diseases will
be experienced across all age groups, but partic-
ularly in working-age adults (people ages 25–64)
and infants. In contrast, increases in the toll of
noncommunicable diseases in upper-middle-
and high-income nations will be in older popu-
lations, with declines occurring in many youn-
ger-age cohorts (Appendix Figure 1.2.1).19
Second, our analysis showed that the share of
health burden that arises from noncommunica-
ble diseases will increase significantly in many
low- and lower-middle-income nations by 2040
(Exhibit 3). In particular, countries such as Ban-
gladesh, Myanmar, Iran, the Philippines, and
Vietnam will have gone from having a health
burden dominated by communicable, maternal,
neonatal, and nutritional diseases to having
noncommunicable diseases represent more than
four-fifths of their health burden within a gener-
ation or two. At that point, the noncommunica-
ble disease burden in these lower-income coun-
tries will be roughly the same as in the United
States and other wealthy nations (Exhibit 3), but
the burden will occur in much younger people in
the poorer countries (Appendix Figure 1.2.1).19
Third, our analysis showed that the countries
that will experience the greatest increases in
death and disability from noncommunicable
diseases over the next twenty-five years are also
projected to have the smallest increases in health
spending (Exhibit 4). Here, too, there is a signif-
icant difference across income groups. High-
income countries are projected to have relatively
modest increases in the percentages of health
burden due to noncommunicable diseases and
significant increases in their resources to ad-
dress those health needs. The one exception is
China, which is not yet a high-income nation but
which has slowed its increase in the percentage
of health burden due to noncommunicable dis-
eases and is expected to significantly expand its
total health spending.
Fourth, our analysis showed that countries
that are projected to have the greatest increase
in their noncommunicable disease burden as a

million or more in 2015. The vertical line indicates that 50 percent of the disability-adjusted life-
years are due to noncommunicable diseases. Countries with the lowest noncommunicable disease
burden in 1990 are expected to see the largest increases in that burden in the future. However,
countries with smaller increases, such as the United Kingdom, may have 1990 and 2040 noncom-
municable disease percentages larger than those of countries with larger increases. DRC is Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo.

 share of health burden are also ranked lowest
(least prepared) in our health system capacity
index for noncommunicable diseases (Exhib-
it 5). African nations do particularly poorly on
this measure, but the health systems of a handful
of countries (such as Bangladesh and India)
from other regions are also shown to be unpre-
pared for the shift in their disease profiles to
noncommunicable diseases.
Discussion
This research shows that the burden of prema-
ture noncommunicable diseases is growing
quickly in lower-income countries. This growth
is fastest in countries with little forecasted
change in health spending and with health sys-
tems that are not well equipped to manage and
treat noncommunicable diseases.We draw three
conclusions from our analysis.
First, there is a clear need for increased invest-
ment in reducing key modifiable risk factors to
reduce the speed and scale of the shift to non-
communicable diseases in lower-income na-
tions. In a previous study published in Health
Affairs, we showed that countries that have
achieved significant reductions in their prema-
ture noncommunicable disease burden have also
reducedthe prevalence of tobacco use and house-
hold air pollution.39 There are also significant
links between reductions in premature noncom-
municable disease mortality and rates of obesity,
air pollution, and binge drinking, but few of the
countries that have achieved reductions in pre-
mature
noncommunicable
disease
mortality
managed to lower those risks.39 Even with reduc-
tions in the risks, a robust and cost-effective
health system will remain important for re-
sponding to the staggeringly fast rise in prema-
ture death and disability from noncommunica-
ble diseases in poorer nations.
Second, more investment is needed in lower-
cost ways to elevate primary care as the main
platform for responding to noncommunicable
diseases in the health systems of low-income
nations.40 The World Health Organization and
the World Economic Forum have recommended
packages of cost-effective “best buy” clinical ser-
vices that can be provided in primary care.41
These interventions include educating patients
about the risks of unhealthy diets and physical
inactivity and about low-cost primary and sec-
ondary prevention measures for heart attacks
and strokes. However, primary care in most
low- and lower-middle-income countries is fo-
cused on episodic care and is poorly situated
to deliver the access to affordable prevention,
diagnosis, and treatment services that many
noncommunicable diseases require. There is ev-
idence that increased use of lower-cost commu-
nity health workers can increase the coverage
and quality of care provided by overburdened
health systems, especially in rural settings.5,42,43
In the HIV/AIDS context, the practice of shifting
care to lower-skilled nurses and health workers,
known as task shifting, has been used effectively
to compensate for a severely limited work-
force.44–46 These strategies may prove useful in
the noncommunicable disease context as well.47
Third,lower-income nations must increase the
resources that they devote to their health sys-
tems. Even with innovative and cost-effective ap-
proaches to service delivery, the health systems
of these lower-income nations will require more
resources to adapt to the expected speed and
scale of the transition to noncommunicable dis-
eases. Many of these nations that will experience

 the greatest increase in death and disability from
noncommunicable diseases spend less on health
than one would expect based on their income
and historical trends. Ghana, Indonesia, Laos,
and Nigeria are examples of countries that are
expected to have large increases in noncommu-
nicable disease health burden as a percentage of
total burden, but they spend less than would be
expected, even after including support in the
form of aid from external donors.48
Countries’ failure to increase health spending
can have consequences that extend well beyond
the higher rates of unnecessary death and dis-
ability. At the household level, premature death
and disability from noncommunicable diseases
oftenresultin lessincome and morecatastrophic
health
expenditures.22,49–51
Adults
who
have
grown up amid widespread poverty and depriva-
tion may be more prone to functional declines
from noncommunicable diseases at younger
ages.52 Given the scale of the rise of noncommu-
nicable diseases, failing to respond to this
shift in the disease profile will mean higher
health and welfare expenditures for countries
and may reduce national productivity and com-
petitiveness.53,54
Policy Implications
Donor-funded global health programs must
evaluate how to spur improved access to critical
noncommunicable disease prevention and treat-
ment
in
lower-income
nations
that
are
experiencing rapid demographic and epidemio-
logical shifts. In these countries, the median age
of the population is increasing, and much of the
health burden is already attributable to noncom-
municable diseases.55 However, development
assistance for health in these nations continues
to be earmarked for HIV/AIDS (25 percent) and
maternal and childhood health (29 percent).3,48
Lower-income countries such as Bangladesh,
Ethiopia, and Indonesia are expected to contin-
ue to make major reductions in mortality from
infectious and childhood diseases, with the sup-
port of international donors. As people with
HIV/AIDS live longer as a result of greater access
to antiretroviral treatment, they are more likely

 to develop noncommunicable diseases due to
aging and HIV-related comorbidities.56 Donor
investments in HIV/AIDS and other infectious
diseases should continue, and the many contri-
butions they have made to reducing the inci-
dence and mortality of HIV/AIDS should be cel-
ebrated. However, it is not sustainable to devote
significant resources to fighting treatable and
preventable communicable diseases only to
watch the same patient populations prematurely
succumb to equally treatable and preventable
noncommunicable diseases. The greater integra-
tion of primary and secondary prevention pro-
grams into global heath platforms to address
HIV/AIDS has worked in other contexts and
should be expanded in the context of noncom-
municable diseases.57–59
More research is needed to assess how to le-
verage other global health platforms to imple-
ment low-cost prevention and control strategies
for noncommunicable diseases as well. Shifting
donor programs from disease-focused goals to
more outcome-oriented measures and investing
in the collection of data to monitor those mea-
sures would increase the accountability and effi-
ciency of global health investments and help
transition important health programs to local
country ownership.60 Recent reports from the
Council on Foreign Relations and the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medi-
cine (US) likewise urge adopting cardiovascular
health and cancer prevention as top priorities for
future US investment in global health.3,61
Conclusion
The recent launch of Resolve to Save Lives, a
philanthropy-funded $225 million initiative that
will seek to improve hypertension control in low-
er-income countries, provides hope for more do-
nor interest in the rising tide of noncommuni-
cable disease in these nations.62 This research
shows that the time for donors and lower-income
country governments to increase their invest-
ment in preventing and treating noncommuni-
cable diseases is now. ▪
