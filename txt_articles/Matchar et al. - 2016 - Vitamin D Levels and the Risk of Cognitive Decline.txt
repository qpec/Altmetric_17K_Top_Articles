Abstract
Background: Vitamin D has a neuroprotective function, potentially important for the prevention of cognitive decline. Prospective studies from 
Western countries support an association between lower vitamin D level and future cognitive decline in elderly people. No prospective study 
has examined this association in Asia.
Methods: This community-based cohort study of elderly people in China follows 1,202 cognitively intact adults aged ≥60 years for a mean 
duration of 2 years. Plasma vitamin D level was measured at the baseline. Cognitive state of participants was assessed using the Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE). Cognitive impairment was defined as an MMSE score <18. Cognitive decline was defined as ≥3 points decline 
from baseline. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between quartiles of vitamin D levels with 
cognitive decline and incidence of cognitive impairment.
Results: Participants with low vitamin D level had an increased risk of cognitive decline. Compared with the highest quartile of vitamin D 
levels, the multivariable odds ratios (ORs; 95% confidence interval) for cognitive decline were 2.1 (1.3–3.4) for the second highest quartile, 2.2 
(1.4–3.6) for the third highest quartile, and 2.0 (1.2–3.3) for the lowest quartile. The multivariable ORs of incident cognitive impairment for 
the second highest, third highest, and lowest versus highest quartiles of vitamin D levels were 1.9 (0.9–4.1), 2.6 (1.2–5.6), and 3.2 (1.5–6.6), 
respectively.
Conclusions: This first follow-up study of elderly people, including the oldest-old, in Asia shows that low vitamin D levels were associated 
with increased risk of subsequent cognitive decline and impairment.
Keywords: Chinese elderly people—Cognitive decline—Cognitive impairment—Follow-up study—Vitamin D
Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone necessary for maintaining good 
musculoskeletal health; its deficiency is associated with increased 
risks of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases (1,2). 
Vitamin D is primarily synthesized in the skin upon exposure to sun-
light; smaller amounts are obtained through dietary intake. More 
recently, enzymes responsible for the synthesis of its active form have 
been found to be distributed throughout the human brain (3). These 
enzymes facilitate on-site calcium homeostasis, immunomodulation, 
antioxidative mechanisms, and beta-amyloid clearance by vitamin 
D, thereby conferring a protective effect on the central nervous 
 system (4,5). This growing body of evidence suggests that vitamin D 
has a neuroprotective function that is potentially important for the 
prevention of cognitive decline. Although the importance of vitamin 
D cannot be disregarded, there is still no consensus on its optimal 
level. This is especially pertinent in the elderly people, the oldest-old 
in particular, as cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D decreases with age 
(6). Moreover, their impaired mobility and limited outdoor activi-
ties can further exacerbate vitamin D deficiency. As the oldest-old 
are the most rapidly growing segment of the elderly population (7), 
vitamin D’s association with cognitive decline in the oldest-old may 
have important public health implications for long-term care facility 
planning and health care expenditures.
Cross-sectional studies have generally found a positive associa-
tion between vitamin D status and cognitive performance in older 
adults (8,9). Recent prospective studies from United States and 
Europe support an association between diminished vitamin D status 
and future cognitive decline (10–13). Since cutaneous synthesis is 
the main source of vitamin D, there exists great variability in vitamin 
D levels across populations due to differences in latitude, seasons, 
and race/ethnicity, such as level of skin pigmentation (14). Yet no 
prospective study has been conducted in elderly Asian populations.
Therefore, we conducted, to the best of our knowledge, the first 
large, longitudinal, community-based study of Chinese elderly adults 
in longevity areas of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity 
Survey to investigate the association between vitamin D level and 
cognitive decline in elderly adults. These longevity areas with excep-
tionally high densities of centenarians provide an opportunity to 
explore this association in the oldest-old. Given the evidence of vita-
min D’s neuroprotective effect, we hypothesized that low levels of 
its major circulating form, 25(OH)D3, is associated with subsequent 
cognitive decline and cognitive impairment in the oldest-old.
Methods
Subjects
Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey is an ongoing lon-
gitudinal survey established in 1998. Baseline and follow-up surveys 
were conducted in half of the counties and cities in the selected 22 
provinces in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2008–2009, 2011–2012, and 
2014. Details of this survey have been described elsewhere (15). 
In 2012, a biomarker substudy was conducted in eight longevity 
areas: Laizhou City of Shandong Province, Xiayi County of Henan 
Province, Zhongxiang City of Hubei Province, Mayang County of 
Hunan Province, Yongfu County of Guangxi Autonomous Area, 
Sanshui District of Guangdong Province, Chengmai County of 
Hainan Province, and Rudong County of Jiangsu Province. A total 
of 2,378 subjects aged ≥60 years participated in the baseline study. 
Follow-up assessments were conducted in 2014 (mean follow-
up = 2.0 
± 
0.2 years). For the purposes of the present study, sub-
jects with missing baseline vitamin D levels (n = 134), Mini-Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) score (n = 211), or cholesterol levels 
(n = 4), or baseline MMSE score <18 (n = 296), or self-reported 
dementia (n = 9) were excluded. Of the remaining 1,724 subjects, 
216 died during follow-up and 281 were lost to follow-up. Twenty-
five subjects without MMSE scores at follow-up were also excluded. 
The final sample consisted of 1,202 subjects. Compared with the 
final sample, excluded subjects (n = 1,176) were older (mean age ± 
standard deviation [SD] 91.1 
± 
12.0 vs. 80.3 
± 
11.3 years), had lower 
MMSE scores (16.7 
± 
11.7 vs. 27.9 
± 
2.8), and lower plasma 25(OH)
D3 levels (38.8 
± 
18.9 vs. 45.1 
± 
19.5; p < .0001 for all comparisons; 
see Supplementary Table 1).
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants 
or their proxies. The Ethics Committees of Peking University and 
National University of Singapore approved this study.
Cognitive function
Cognitive function was measured using the Chinese version of 
the MMSE (16), which is widely used to assess cognitive status. 
It consists of 30 items, with scores ranging from 0 to 30. Higher 
scores indicate better cognition. The MMSE assesses participants’ 
orientation, memory, attention, calculation, language, and writ-
ten and visual construction. Cognitive decline was defined as a 
decline of MMSE score ≥3 points at follow-up (10). As previously 
described, we used a cutoff of <18 to categorize subjects as cogni-
tively impaired (17).
Plasma 25(OH)D3 concentration
Fasting venous blood was collected in heparin anticoagulant vacuum 
tubes and centrifuged at 20°C, 2500 
rpm for 10 
min. The plasma was 
isolated and frozen at −20°C, shipped on wet ice to the central labo-
ratory at Capital Medical University in Beijing, then stored at −80°C 
until analysis.
Plasma 25(OH)D3 was measured using an enzyme-linked immu-
noassay by Immunodiagnostic Systems Limited (IDS Ltd, Boldon, 
UK) The inter-assay and intra-assay coefficients of variation were 
<10% and <8%, respectively.
Determination of independent covariates (see Supplementary 
Material, for details)
Statistical analysis
Means and percentages were calculated by quartiles of 25(OH)D3 
levels for continuous variables and categorical variables, respectively. 
Differences in baseline characteristics across quartiles of 25(OH)D3 
levels were compared using χ2 test for categorical variables, analysis 
of variance for continuous variables with normal distribution, and 
the Kruskal–Wallis test for variables with skewed distribution.
We used general linear models to examine the changes in MMSE 
score over the follow-up in each 25(OH)D3 quartile. Adjusted mean 
changes in MMSE score were obtained for each 25(OH)D3 quartile.
The odds ratios (ORs), along with their 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs), for reduction of ≥3 MMSE points from baseline and transition to 
an MMSE score <18 were estimated according to quartiles of plasma 
25(OH)D3 levels and 1 SD decrement of plasma 25(OH)D3 levels 
(19.5 nmol/L) with logistic regression models. Adjustments were made 
for age, gender, education (yes or no), abdominal obesity (yes or no), 
baseline MMSE score, hypertension (yes or no), type 2 diabetes (yes 
or no), estimated glomerular filtration rate, total cholesterol (mmol/L), 
current smoker (yes or no), current drinker (yes or no), blood collec-
tion season (March–May, June–August, and September–November) 
(18), activities of daily living (at least one activity of daily living limi-
tation), depression (yes, no, or not able to answer/no response), and 
rural (yes or no) (18). A test for linear trend across plasma 25(OH)D3 
levels was conducted by assigning median values of plasma 25(OH)D3 
for each quartile. We used multivariable-adjusted penalized smooth-
ing spline plots to examine possible 25(OH)D3 threshold levels for 
cognitive decline and cognitive impairment.
All statistical tests were two-tailed, and values of p < 0.05 were 
regarded as statistically significant. The SAS statistical package ver-
sion 9.3 (Statistical Analysis System Inc., Cary, NC) was used for 
analysis except for the spline plots, which were fitted in R version 
3.1.1 (19).

 Results
The majority of the participants (82.4%) in this study resided 
in rural areas. The mean age of the total study population was 
80.3 
± 
11.3 years and 47.1% were female participants.
Subjects’ basic characteristics by quartiles of 25(OH)D3 levels are 
shown in Table 1. Participants with lower plasma 25(OH)D3 levels 
were more likely to be older, female participants, have abdominal 
obesity, hypertension and less education than those with higher 
levels. Smoking and alcohol use were more common in those with 
higher 25(OH)D3 levels. The mean MMSE score was significantly 
lower, whereas mean eGFR was significantly higher in those with 
lower 25(OH)D3 levels. Prevalence of at least one activity of daily 
living limitation was higher in participants with lower 25(OH)D3 
levels compared with those with higher levels.
The decline in adjusted mean MMSE score between survey waves 
was greater in participants in the lowest (−3.05), third (−2.73), and 
second (−2.37) quartiles of 25(OH)D3 levels than the highest quar-
tiles (−1.44; see Supplementary Figure 1).
Table 2 shows the ORs and 95% CI of cognitive decline by quar-
tiles of baseline 25(OH)D3 levels and to baseline 25(OH)D3 levels 
1 SD below the mean. Participants with lower 25(OH)D3 levels 
had a higher risk of a decrease of ≥3 MMSE points over the 2-year 
follow-up compared with those with higher levels. The multivari-
able ORs (95% CI) of cognitive decline were 2.02 (1.24–3.28), 2.07 
(1.26–3.41), and 1.83 (1.10–3.05) for the second, third, and lowest 
quartiles, respectively. The multivariable OR associated with 1 SD 
decrement of 25(OH)D3 levels was 1.35 (1.10–1.66) for cognitive 
decline.
The odds of developing cognitive impairment increased with 
lower baseline 25(OH)D3 levels; this relationship remained statis-
tically significant after adjustment for age, sex, education, baseline 
MMSE score, depression, outdoor activities, activities of daily living 
limitations, and other potential confounders (Table 2). The multi-
variable ORs of transitioning from a baseline MMSE score ≥18 to 
<18 was statistically significantly higher for the third and lowest 
versus the highest quartiles of 25(OH)D3 levels: 2.41 (1.12–5.19) 
and 2.89 (1.36–6.14), respectively. The multivariable OR associated 
with 1 SD decrement of 25(OH)D3 levels was 1.59 (1.17–2.17) for 
cognitive impairment. The association between 25(OH)D3 levels 
and incidence of cognitive impairment did not vary between men 
and women (p for interaction = 0.96) and between groups aged 
60–79 years and ≥80 years (p = 0.64; data not shown).
In the multivariable-adjusted spline smoothing plots, the risk 
of cognitive decline reduced when the vitamin D level is above the 
threshold of 50 nmol/L. The risk of cognitive impairment increased 
with decreasing 25(OH)D3 levels, however no threshold effect was 
observed (Figure 1).
Discussion
We observed that low 25(OH)D3 levels, reflective of vitamin D 
status, were associated with subsequent cognitive decline and cog-
nitive impairment in a large elderly population including the oldest-
old. This represents the first longitudinal study of the relationship 
between vitamin D status and cognition in Asian men and women, 
and this temporal association strengthens the hypothesis of a causal 
association.
Our findings were consistent with previous cohort studies show-
ing that vitamin D status predicts cognitive decline. A meta-analysis 
of eight studies found a significant association between vitamin D 
status and cognition using the MMSE assessment (20). Another 
meta-analysis of five cross-sectional and two longitudinal studies 
also found that low levels of vitamin D were significantly associated 
with a higher risk of cognitive impairment (21). A recent study of 
2,777 community-dwelling elderly people in the United States found

 an association between low vitamin D status and worse global cogni-
tive function over a mean follow-up period of 4 years (13). Another 
study in Germany also found a significant association between 
vitamin D status and cognitive decline in nondemented elderly 
population aged 70 years and older using the Cognitive Telephone 
Screening Instrument for a mean follow-up period of 4.6 years (11). 
In a longitudinal multiethnic cohort study of older adults, rates of 
cognitive decline over a mean follow-up of 4.8 years were greater in 
vitamin D insufficient/deficient individuals than those with vitamin 
D adequate status for episodic memory and executive function (12).
A notable observation in the present study is that the asso-
ciation of vitamin D status and cognitive decline were similar in 
both oldest-old and less elderly people. In this study, there was 
a clear association between lower 25(OH)D3 level and cognitive 
impairment in subjects aged ≥80, which remained statistically 
significant even after adjusting for covariates (lowest quartiles, 
OR 3.48 (95% CI 1.27–9.55), p = 0.0154; data not shown). This 
contrasted with the prospective Newcastle 85+ Study (22) that 
failed to demonstrate statistically significant associations between 
baseline vitamins D status with incident cognitive impairment in 
the very old subjects. This finding may be attributed to differences 
in ethnicity, lower 25(OH)D3 levels in the current population, and 
the mode of cognitive assessment (the Newcastle 85+ study used 
standardized MMSE test (SMMSE) with a cutoff score ≤25 in the 
very old subjects).
An additional difference from previous studies is that the 
current study indicates that the association between vitamin 
D and cognitive impairment is not gender specific. Single gen-
der studies reported an inverse association between vitamin D 
adequacy and cognitive impairment in women (23,24), and little 
evidence of independent association in men (25,26). However, 
evidence from studies involving both genders has been inconsist-
ent (8,27).
The observation of temporal association between 25(OH)D3 
levels and subsequent cognitive function supports the notion that 
vitamin D has a clinically important neuroprotective effect. A wide 
variety of mechanisms for this effect has been proposed and is sup-
ported by animal studies. Vitamin D has been found to modulate 
neuronal calcium homeostasis, cerebral process of detoxification, 
immunomodulation, and beta-amyloid clearance. Calcitriol (1,25-
(OH)2D3), the active metabolite form of vitamin D3 downregulates 
L-type sensitive calcium channel in the hippocampus, which can 
protect neurons against excitotoxic insults (28). It can also stimu-
late the expression of calcium binding proteins such as parvalbumin, 
calbindin-D9k, and calbindin-D28k (29,30). Moreover, calcitriol 
attenuates the production of nitric oxide through inhibiting the 
expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in the spinal cord and 
brain (31). High nitric oxide levels are thought to play a role in 
inflammatory disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, and neurotox-
icity (32). Calcitriol can control brain detoxification processes by 
upregulating γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity and exerting a neu-
roprotective effect during brain damage (33). It is also an immuno-
suppressor and may be neuroprotective by inhibiting autoimmune 
damage to nervous system (4,33). Vitamin D may reduce the accu-
mulation of Aβ42 peptide in stimulating the innate immune system, 
specifically the phagocytosis and clearance of beta-amyloid peptide 
by macrophages (34).
Despite animal and epidemiological evidence, the notion that vita-
min D is both causally related and clinically important in cognitive

 function is not established. Although we identified a temporal associ-
ation and adjusted for characteristics that induced both low 25(OH)
D3 levels and were associated with cognitive impairment (e.g., out-
door exposure), there may have been unmeasured confounders. One 
promising epidemiological approach to the problem of confounding, 
Mendelian randomization, has not resolved this potential problem. 
A recent study indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms related 
to serum vitamin D status did not predict cognitive function (35). 
However, single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with the vita-
min D receptor gene (Apal, rs7975232) was found to be significantly 
associated with word recall and digit–symbol coding tests (35), which 
strengthen the findings that vitamin D receptor polymorphisms are 
associated with Alzheimer’s disease (36).
Compelling evidence for a causal association from randomized 
trials has yet to resolve this clinically important issue. In the Women’s 
Health Initiative Calcium and Vitamin D Trial, 4,143 women aged 
≥65 years were randomized to either receive calcium 1,000 
mg 
and vitamin D3 400 IU or placebo. During the mean follow-up of 
7.8 years, no association was found between treatment and the inci-
dence of probable dementia, incidence of mild cognitive impairment, 
or cognitive function (37). One explanation for lack of an effect was 
the joint administration of vitamin D with calcium; increased serum 
calcium has been associated with increased risk of cognitive decline 
in elderly people and increased intake of calcium may mask the neu-
roprotective effect of vitamin D (38). A randomized trial of high-dose 
versus low-dose vitamin D2 in Alzheimer’s disease patients found no 
benefit (additional 6,000 IU per day to ongoing low-dose vitamin D2, 
1,000 IU daily for 8 weeks) on cognitive function. Although serum 
25(OH)D3 levels increased in the intervention group, the increase may 
not have been sufficient to benefit cognitive function (39). Another 
clinical trial that examined the effect of vitamin D levels (50,000 IU 
vitamin D2 3 times per week over 4 weeks) in nursing home residents 
with low vitamin D status observed no effect of vitamin D supple-
mentation on cognitive function. This may be attributed to shorter 
treatment duration and smaller sample size (40).
In the current study, “we found that there may be a threshold 
effect for risk of cognitive decline but not for risk of cognitive impair-
ment. Lack of evidence of threshold effect for cognitive impairment 
is at variance with a previous study” (18) where the risk of develop-
ing all-cause dementia and Alzheimer’s disease increased markedly 
below concentrations of 25(OH)D3 levels around 50 nmol/L. The 
lack of evidence of threshold in the current study may be due to 
the relatively shorter follow-up time (2.0 years vs. to 5.6 years) and 
smaller sample size (1,202 subjects vs. 1,658 subjects) compared 
with the previous study.
As noted, one limitation of our study is that some confound-
ing factors related to cognitive decline and vitamin D intake such 
as apolipoprotein E genotype, diet, direct sun exposure, and sup-
plements intake were unadjusted for. Thus, we could not examine 
an effect modification by apolipoprotein E allele. However, a recent 
prospective study reported that the association between low vita-
min D levels and decline of cognitive function domains remained 
significant even after controlling for apolipoprotein E allele and 
other potential confounders (12). Further studies are required to 
confirm the potential effect of vitamin D status on cognitive decline 
in the presence and absence of apolipoprotein E allele. We report 
our findings based on cohort specific vitamin D quartiles in order 
to maximize the power to identify categorical effects. To facilitate 
comparisons with studies based on common clinical cut points, we 
include Supplementary Table 2, which uses cut points comparable to 
previous research for both cognitive decline and CI.
Our included subjects were younger, had better functional abili-
ties and healthier lifestyle behaviors compared with those excluded 
from the analysis. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of this 
participation bias attenuating our results, it would unlikely lead to 
a bias in favor of an association between vitamin D and cognitive 
decline, as these subjects also had higher 25(OH)D3 level and MMSE 
scores at baseline. Further, it was unlikely that vitamin D supplemen-
tation would explain the association in this study, as 87% of the par-
ticipants reported no use of vitamin supplements. Moreover, Chinese 
Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey oversampled the oldest-old 
in China, and 25(OH)D3 level in the present study is relatively lower 
among younger or Western populations (17). Our findings must be 
interpreted in this light.
The strengths of the present study were its prospective design, 
large numbers of participants were followed up, and the collection 
of plasma blood samples during the surveys. These allowed us to 
investigate the association between vitamin D status and risk of 
cognitive decline in cognitively intact participants over time and to 
adjust for important potential confounding variables. Furthermore, 
we assessed the cognitive function of studied subjects at baseline 
and adjusted for baseline MMSE score in our model, reducing the 
possible influence of low baseline 25(OH)D3 levels on cognitive 
decline.
In conclusion, our longitudinal study indicates that low 25(OH)
D3 levels are associated with subsequent cognitive decline and 
cognitive impairment. Despite the lack of conclusive results from 
intervention studies, the weight of this and other epidemiological 
studies reinforce the importance of more intensive investigation on 
the effects of vitamin D supplements on cognitive decline. Further, it 
points to the need to fully explain the association between vitamin D 
and cognitive function so that we may identify an effective interven-
tion to stem the rapidly increasing prevalence of cognitive decline 
associated with an aging population.
