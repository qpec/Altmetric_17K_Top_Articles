Abstract
There is accumulating evidence that youths with antisocial behavior or psychopathic traits show deficits in facial emotion
recognition, but little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying these impairments. A number of neuroimaging
studies have investigated brain activity during facial emotion processing in youths with Conduct Disorder (CD) and adults
with psychopathy, but few of these studies tested for group differences in effective connectivity—i.e. changes in connectivity
during emotion processing. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and psycho-physiological interaction methods, we
investigated the impact of CD and psychopathic traits on amygdala activity and effective connectivity in 46 male youths with
CD and 25 typically-developing controls when processing emotional faces. All participants were aged 16–21years. Relative to
controls, youths with CD showed reduced amygdala activity when processing angry or sad faces relative to neutral faces, but
the groups did not significantly differ in amygdala-related effective connectivity. In contrast, psychopathic traits were nega-
tively correlated with amygdala–ventral anterior cingulate cortex connectivity for angry vs neutral faces, but were unrelated to
amygdala responses to angry or sad faces. These findings suggest that CD and psychopathic traits have differential effects on
amygdala activation and functional interactions between limbic regions during facial emotion processing.

Introduction
There are now a large number of studies showing impairments
in facial emotion recognition in antisocial populations, with
studies of children, adolescents and adults all providing evi-
dence that antisocial behavior and psychopathic traits are asso-
ciated with emotion recognition difficulties (Dolan and Fullam,
2006; Marsh and Blair, 2008; Fairchild et al., 2009; Fairchild et al.,
2010; Dawel et al., 2012). However, despite the consistency of
these findings and their potential clinical significance, relatively
little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying these
deficits. Dysfunction of the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC),
anterior
insula
and
ventromedial
prefrontal
cortex
(vmPFC)/orbitofrontal

(OFC)

considered

 plausible candidates (Blair, 2013). In line with this hypothesis,
neuroimaging studies have revealed altered amygdala, insula
and OFC activity during facial emotion processing in adoles-
cents with Conduct Disorder (CD) or Oppositional Defiant
Disorder (ODD) (Marsh et al., 2008; Passamonti et al., 2010;
Fairchild et al., 2014), and children with conduct problems and
elevated psychopathic traits (Jones et al., 2009; Viding et al.,
2012). Atypical ACC deactivation during the processing of emo-
tional images has also been reported in adolescents with CD
(Sterzer et al., 2005). However, it is still unclear whether functional
interactions between these components of the limbic system are
abnormal in youths with CD or psychopathic traits. Studying
functional connectivity in these populations is important as this
has the potential to shift our understanding of brain function
from a modular view toward one of integrated circuits, as well as
deepening our understanding of the brain mechanisms underly-
ing CD and psychopathy. Connectivity analyses may also be
informative in interpreting previous findings obtained in antiso-
cial populations, such as differences in amygdala activity when
viewing emotional faces, which could be driven by reduced or
increased regulation of the amygdala by linked brain regions.
Despite these potential advantages of connectivity methods,
relatively few studies have investigated functional connectivity
between the amygdala and associated limbic regions involved
in regulating emotional responses, such as the ACC or the OFC,
in antisocial populations. Using a facial emotion processing
task, Marsh et al. (2008) found a negative correlation between
psychopathic traits and amygdala–vmPFC functional connectiv-
ity in a small group of adolescents with disruptive behavior dis-
orders (DBDs; n ¼ 9). Marsh et al. (2011) subsequently reported
reduced amygdala–OFC functional connectivity in adolescents
with DBDs and psychopathic traits, relative to controls, during a
moral decision-making task. A more recent study used resting-
state fMRI to characterize the intrinsic functional connectivity
of the basolateral (BLA) and centromedial (CMA) nuclei of the
amygdala in youths with CD and callous–unemotional (CU)
traits, relative to youths with CD without CU traits, and age-
matched healthy controls (HCs) (Aghajani et al., 2017). Relative
to the other groups, youths with CD and CU traits showed
increased connectivity between the BLA and ventral ACC
(vACC), but lower connectivity between the CMA and vmPFC.
However, the connectivity analysis method used in the stud-
ies by Marsh et al. only tests for correlations between the fMRI
time series of the respective regions and, as such, could reflect
group differences in baseline or intrinsic connectivity rather than
being specifically related to connectivity during task performance.
The latter study by Aghajani et al. (2017) supports this idea, by
showing altered functional connectivity in youths with CD and
CU traits under resting state conditions. In contrast, effective con-
nectivity methods, such as psycho-physiological interaction (PPI)
analyses, enable researchers to study how the connectivity
between brain regions is modulated or altered by specific task
demands
or
stimulus
characteristics
(e.g.
processing
angry
compared to neutral faces) (O’Reilly et al., 2012). Consequently,
these methods have the potential to detect differences in
effective connectivity specifically during emotion processing.
Coccaro et al. (2007) used PPI methods to study adults with
intermittent explosive disorder (IED), a psychiatric condition char-
acterized by impulsive aggression. Relative to HCs, participants
with IED showed reduced amygdala–vmPFC effective connectiv-
ity, and increased amygdala responses, when viewing angry faces
(Coccaro et al., 2007). Thus, the higher amygdala responses
observed during anger processing may have been driven by
weaker top-down regulation of the amygdala in the IED group.
Another study investigated connectivity changes between
the amygdala and the face processing network in adult psycho-
paths
using
a
matching
task
involving
emotional
faces
(Contreras-Rodriguez et al., 2014). The psychopathic group
showed reduced effective connectivity between the amygdala
and the primary visual cortex, fusiform gyrus, parietal cortex,
and
dorsolateral
prefrontal
cortex,
relative
to
controls.
However, these connectivity changes were unrelated to psy-
chopathy scores, so this effect may have been explained by
group differences in aggressive behavior (as the psychopaths
were all violent offenders), rather than psychopathic traits.
Likewise, in the studies by Marsh et al. (2008, 2011), all of the
youths with psychopathic traits also had DBDs, so group differ-
ences in functional connectivity may have been driven by psy-
chopathic traits or antisocial behavior.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to use effective con-
nectivity methods to investigate connectivity in young people
with CD and examine whether there are dimensional relation-
ships between CD symptoms or variations in overall psycho-
pathic traits and effective connectivity. To achieve these aims,
we recruited additional subjects to add to an existing sample of
adolescents with CD. While our previous study with an overlap-
ping sample showed reduced amygdala responses to angry rela-
tive to neutral faces in adolescents with CD compared to HCs
(Passamonti et al., 2010), connectivity between the amygdala
and other brain regions was not investigated.
Given previous work using the same task showing that con-
nectivity between the amygdala and vACC is less negative in
healthy adults who are high in reward drive (Passamonti et al.,
2008), a personality trait related to externalizing behavior, and
evidence of dense anatomical connections between the vACC
and amygdala (Ghashghaei et al., 2007), we predicted that nega-
tive changes in amygdala–vACC effective connectivity during
the processing of emotional vs neutral faces would be attenu-
ated in adolescents with CD relative to HCs. We also tested for
group differences in effective connectivity between the amyg-
dala and the rest of the brain using an unbiased, whole-brain
approach. As previous theoretical and empirical work suggests
that
there
may
be
qualitative
or
quantitative
differences
between childhood-onset and adolescence-onset forms of CD
(Moffitt, 1993; Fairchild et al., 2013), we investigated whether
these subgroups differed in terms of effective connectivity.
We also assessed the impact of psychopathic traits and CU
traits more specifically on effective connectivity. We predicted
that the negative changes in amygdala-vACC connectivity typi-
cally observed in healthy individuals in response to emotional
vs neutral faces would be attenuated (i.e. closer to 0) in those
with elevated psychopathic or CU traits. Finally, as previous
studies have reported significant correlations between CD
symptoms and brain structure (Fairchild et al., 2011) or activity
(Passamonti et al., 2010), we tested for correlations between CD
symptoms and amygdala–vACC effective connectivity, predicting
that negative changes in connectivity would be attenuated in par-
ticipants with more, compared to those with fewer, CD symptoms.

 pervasive developmental disorder (e.g. autism) or chronic phys-
ical illness. An HC group (no history of CD/ODD and no current
psychiatric illness) of 25 male adolescents were recruited
from schools and colleges. All subjects were aged 16–21 years.
To equate groups in terms of estimated IQ, controls with esti-
mated full-scale IQs > 115 were excluded. Fourteen CD subjects
were excluded due to excessive head movement (>2 mm) in
the scanner, three due to signal dropout in the medial tempo-
ral/OFC regions and a further two due to poor behavioral per-
formance (<60% accuracy). This left us with 46 CD and 25 HC
participants with usable data (Table 1), 60 of whom overlapped
with the sample described in Passamonti et al. (2010). The study
was approved by the Suffolk National Health Service Research
Ethics Committee and all participants gave written informed
consent.
Participants were assessed for CD, ODD, ADHD, Major
Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive
Compulsive
Disorder,
Post-Traumatic
Stress
Disorder
and
Substance Dependence using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective
Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-age Children-Present
and
Lifetime
Version
(K-SADS-PL;
Kaufman
et
al.,
1997).
Separate diagnostic interviews were performed with the partici-
pants and their caregivers and research diagnoses were made
by combining information from both informants. Participants
were classified as having CO–CD if they or their caregivers
reported that at least one CD symptom and functional impair-
ment was
present
prior
to age
10
(American
Psychiatric
Association, 1994). If no symptoms were reported by either
informant within the first 10 years of life, but they developed CD
in adolescence, an AO–CD diagnosis was given. According to
these criteria, 24 participants had CO–CD and 22 had AO–CD.
Callous-unemotional
and
overall
psychopathic
traits
were
assessed using the Callous-Unemotional dimension subscale
and the total score on the Youth Psychopathic traits Inventory
(YPI), respectively (Andershed et al., 2002; see Supplementary
Material for further information and example items from this
measure). Current and lifetime ADHD symptoms were assessed
using the K-SADS-PL.
fMRI task
Participants were asked to categorize the gender of grayscale
photographs of angry, sad and neutral faces (half female) posed
by 30 different identities (Supplementary Figure S1). The faces
were selected from two stimulus sets (Lundqvist et al., 1998;
Tottenham et al., 2009) on the basis of emotional ratings from
an independent sample (Ewbank et al., 2009). The stimuli were
presented in 17.5 s epochs containing five faces from the same
category (angry, sad or neutral) intermixed with five null events
(fixation cross). Each face trial comprised a 1000-ms presenta-
tion of a face followed by a fixation cross (750 ms). Null events
constituted a 1750-ms presentation of the same fixation cross.
The stimuli presented during each epoch were pseudorandom-
ized with respect to trial type (faces or null events), gender and
identity; no more than three consecutive trials were of the same
trial type. This pseudo-randomization enhanced design effi-
ciency while preserving the unpredictability of stimulus onsets
in naı
¨ve participants (Passamonti et al., 2008). Twelve epochs of
each category were presented overall (60 angry, 60 sad, 60 neu-
tral faces; 10 min and 30 s duration in total). Reaction times (RT)
and accuracy were recorded during the task.
Image acquisition and pre-processing
MRI scanning was performed on a Siemens Tim Trio 3-Tesla
magnetic resonance imaging scanner with a 16-channel head
coil at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. Whole-brain
data were acquired with echo-planar T2*-weighted imaging
(EPI), sensitive to the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent
(BOLD) signal contrast (32 axial slices, 3 mm thickness; repeti-
tion time ¼ 2000 ms; echo time ¼ 30 ms; voxel size: 3�3�3 mm3).
Data were analyzed using SPM5 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/).
The first three volumes were discarded to allow for the effects
of
magnetic
saturation.
A
high-resolution
structural
magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) scan
was also acquired at a resolution of 1�1�1 mm3. EPIs were sinc
interpolated in time to correct for slice time differences and

 realigned to the first scan by rigid body transformations to cor-
rect for head movements. The mean EPI was computed for each
subject and inspected to ensure that no subjects showed exces-
sive signal dropout in medial temporal and OFC regions. EPIs
were coregistered and normalized to the T1 standard template
in MNI space (Montreal Neurological Institute) using linear and
non-linear transformations, and smoothed with a full-width-
half-maximum Gaussian kernel of 8 mm.
fMRI analyses
For each participant, a General Linear Model (GLM) assessed
regionally specific effects of task parameters on BOLD indices of
activation (Friston et al., 1994). The model included experimen-
tal factors (angry, sad, neutral face trials and null/fixation
events) and six realignment parameters as effects of no interest,
to account for residual motion-related variance. Low-frequency
signal drift was removed using a high-pass filter (cut-off 128 s)
and an autoregressive [AR(1)] correction for serial correlations
was applied.
Contrast images for the comparison angry vs neutral face tri-
als were generated and entered into a second-level GLM ANOVA
to produce a SPM-F map that investigated main effects of condi-
tion and group (CO–CD, AO–CD, controls); a similar ANOVA
tested main effects of condition and group for the sad vs neutral
comparison.
Finally,
we
assessed
whether
individual
differences
in
callous-unemotional traits, overall psychopathic traits, and CD
symptoms (i.e. lifetime or current symptoms) were correlated
with the neural response for the angry vs neutral and sad vs
neutral contrasts. This was examined in each group independ-
ently and in all 71 participants together (separate regressions
were run for each personality trait and clinical symptom varia-
ble). Of note, we repeated these analyses including lifetime/ever
and current ADHD symptoms as separate covariates of no inter-
est to remove any potential confounding influence of ADHD
symptoms on the results.
Two approaches for thresholding second level maps were
applied. First, for a priori regions of interest (ROIs), the threshold
used was P < 0.05, Family-Wise Error (FWE) correction for multi-
ple comparisons in small volumes (i.e. small volume correction,
svc) (Worsley et al., 1996; Friston, 1997). The amygdala ROI was
defined using the Talairach Daemon atlas within the Wake
Forest
University
(WFU)
PickAtlas
(Lancaster
et
al.,
2000;
Maldjian et al., 2003). The vACC ROI was defined as a 10-mm
sphere, using as a center the local maxima derived from our
previous study of HCs (x ¼ �8, y ¼ 44, z ¼ 4; Passamonti et al.,
2008). Brain regions that were not predicted a priori but which
met a threshold of P < 0.001 uncorrected, k�10 are reported in
Supplementary Tables S1–6 for completeness.
PPI analysis. Variation in physiological connectivity as a func-
tion of psychological context constitutes a PPI (Friston et al.,
1997). PPI analysis can be used to identify regions that have dif-
ferential connectivity with the source region (amygdala) accord-
ing to the context (e.g. angry vs neutral or sad vs neutral faces).
This was achieved using a moderator variable, derived from the
product of source activation and context. In this way, regions
are identified not because they are correlated with amygdala
activation or the presence/absence of angry or sad faces, but
because of the interaction between these factors. An increased
amygdala response to angry vs neutral faces was found in both
hemispheres (see Results); therefore, both left and right amyg-
dalae were used as source regions. For each participant, a 6-mm
sphere was constructed around the voxel corresponding to the
anatomical center of the amygdala (left: x ¼�24, y ¼ �2, z ¼ �18;
right: x ¼ 28, y ¼ �1, z ¼ �19), and the time-series for each par-
ticipant was computed using the first eigenvariate from all vox-
els’ time series in this sphere.
The BOLD time series for each participant was deconvolved
to estimate a ‘neuronal time series’ for the amygdala region
(Gitelman et al., 2003). The PPI term (PPI regressor) was calcu-
lated as the element-by-element product of the amygdala neu-
ronal time series and a vector coding for the main effect of task
(1 for angry/sad faces, �1 for neutral faces and 0 for null events).
This product was re-convolved by the canonical hemodynamic
response function (hrf). The model also included the main
effects of condition convolved by the hrf, and movement regres-
sors were included as covariates of no interest. For each partici-
pant, PPI models were run and contrast images generated for
positive and negative PPIs (i.e. regions showing positive or nega-
tive changes in connectivity with the source region according
to
context).
Contrast
images
for
each
participant
were
then entered into a second level ANOVA with Condition
(Anger > Neutral)
as
a
within-subjects
factor
and
Group
(Controls, CO–CD, AO–CD) as a between-subjects factor. To iden-
tify the direction of the change in amygdala–vACC connectivity
(i.e. negative or positive), a one-sample t-test was run across the
whole sample. As well as testing for condition and group effects
on amygdala–vACC effective connectivity, using a threshold of
P < 0.05, FWE svc in line with previous work, we also investi-
gated for condition and group effects on connectivity between
the amygdala and the rest of the brain, using a whole-brain
approach. In the latter case, we applied a voxel-wise threshold
of P < 0.05, FWE whole-brain correction. Separate regression
analyses were used to identify regions in which the changes in
connectivity with the amygdala were correlated with psycho-
pathic or CU traits, and current or lifetime CD symptoms. In all
cases, a threshold of P < 0.05, FWE svc was used within the
vACC, whereas P < 0.05, FWE whole-brain correction was used
for areas outside the vACC. The same procedure was performed
for the sad vs neutral contrast.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics
Table 1 provides information about the sample’s demographic
and clinical characteristics. The groups were matched in age,
IQ, and ethnicity, but differed in socioeconomic status, with
CO–CD participants being more likely to come from lower socio-
economic
status
backgrounds
than
controls
(P ¼ 0.02).
As
expected, both of the CD subgroups scored higher than controls
in overall psychopathic and CU traits, and current and lifetime
CD symptoms. Post-hoc tests revealed that youths with CO–CD
endorsed more lifetime CD symptoms than AO–CD youths
(P ¼ 0.03), but there were no other differences between the CD
subgroups.

 svc). Across the whole brain, no regions showed group differen-
ces at a threshold of P < 0.05, FWE whole-brain correction.
Group comparisons using t-tests revealed that CD subjects
(collapsing across subgroups) showed a significantly lower
response to Angry > Neutral compared to controls in the right
amygdala [t(68) ¼ 3.65, P < 0.01, svc, k ¼ 19; Figure 1]. Considered
separately, both the CO–CD and AO–CD subgroups showed a
lower right amygdala response to Angry > Neutral relative to
HCs [t(68) ¼�3.38, P < 0.02, svc, k ¼ 93 and t(68) ¼ �3.19, P < 0.03,
svc, k ¼ 38, respectively]. However, the CO–CD and AO–CD
groups did not differ from each other in right amygdala activa-
tion (all Ps > 0.24).
Influence of ADHD symptoms, and psychopathic and CU traits. An
additional regression analysis, covarying out ADHD symptoms,
revealed there was still a main effect of group in the right amyg-
dala [F(2, 62) ¼ 9.47, P < 0.01, svc, k ¼ 97; n.b. ADHD symptom
data were unavailable for six participants]. Again, relative to
controls, participants with CD showed lower responses to
Angry > Neutral in right amygdala [t(62) ¼ 4.33, P < 0.005, svc,
k ¼ 210), and each of the CD subgroups showed lower right
amygdala activity compared with the control group (Ps < 0.05,
svc). A further regression analysis revealed that after covarying
out psychopathic traits, the group effect in the right amygdala
was no longer significant (P > 0.33).
Correlations between clinical symptoms, personality
measures and amygdala responses
CD subjects only. Current CD symptoms were positively corre-
lated with right [t(44) ¼ 2.67, P < 0.05, svc, k ¼ 40], but not left
amygdala activity (P ¼ 0.09, svc). There was also a trend-level
positive correlation between lifetime CD symptoms and right
[t(44) ¼ 2.52, P ¼ 0.08, svc], but not left amygdala activity
(P ¼ 0.16, svc). There were no significant correlations between
overall psychopathic traits or CU traits and amygdala responses
in either hemisphere (all Ps > 0.20, svc). Separate correlations in
each of the CD subgroups are reported in Supplementary
Material—in brief, only current CD symptoms were significantly
related to amygdala activity.
fMRI comparisons for sad vs neutral faces
ANOVA—main effects of condition and group (HC, CO–CD, AO–CD).
Across all subjects, the main effect of condition (Sad > Neutral)
was of trend-level significance in left amygdala [F(1, 68) ¼ 7.96,
P ¼ 0.08, svc], but not significant in right amygdala (P ¼ 0.31, svc).
There was a main effect of group in both the left [F(2, 68) ¼ 7.25,
P < 0.03, svc, k ¼ 50] and right amygdala [F(2, 68) ¼ 7.79, P < 0.02,
svc, k ¼ 49; Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S2).
Group comparisons using t tests revealed that, compared to
HCs, the combined CD group showed lower responses to
Sad > Neutral in right [t(68) ¼ 2.88, P < 0.04, svc, k ¼ 70] and left
amygdala [t(68) ¼ 3.11, P ¼ 0.03, svc, k ¼ 53]. CO–CD participants
showed a reduced bilateral amygdala response to Sad> Neutral

t(68) ¼ 3.23, P < 0.02, svc, k ¼ 24; left: t(68) ¼ 3.01, P < 0.03, svc,
k ¼ 12). There were no significant differences between controls
and AO–CD subjects for this contrast (Ps > 0.23, svc).
Influence of ADHD symptoms, and psychopathic and CU traits. After
covarying out ADHD symptoms, there were still main effects of

dala [F(2, 62) ¼ 6.95, P < 0.04, svc, k ¼ 91]. An independent-
samples t test revealed that the combined CD group showed
lower responses to Sad > Neutral in right [t(62) ¼ 2.97, P < 0.03,
svc, k ¼ 127] and left amygdala [t(62) ¼ 3.05, P < 0.02, svc, k ¼ 150]
relative to controls. CO–CD participants showed lower amygdala
responses to Sad > Neutral compared to HCs [right: t(62) ¼ 3.67,
P < 0.005, svc, k ¼ 205; left: t(62) ¼ 3.41, P < 0.01, svc, k ¼ 272) and

t(62) ¼ 2.60, P ¼ 0.05, svc, k ¼ 46). Again, there were no significant
differences between HCs and AO–CD participants (Ps > 0.10,
svc).
All results described above remained significant when con-
trolling for psychopathic or CU traits, except for the difference

amygdala, which was reduced to trend-level significance when
covarying out CU traits (P ¼ 0.08, svc).
Correlations between clinical symptoms, personality
measures and amygdala responses
CD subjects only. There were no significant correlations between
current or lifetime CD symptoms and right or left amygdala
responses to Sad > Neutral (Ps > 0.20, svc). There were also no
significant correlations between psychopathic or CU traits and
amygdala responses for this contrast (Ps > 0.14, svc).
Connectivity between the amygdala and ventral anterior
cingulate cortex (vACC)—effects of condition and group
for angry vs neutral faces
Across all 71 subjects, irrespective of group, a one-sample t-test
revealed a negative change in connectivity between vACC and
left amygdala [t(70) ¼ 3.72, P < 0.01, svc, k ¼ 63; Supplementary
Table S3], and also right amygdala [t(70) ¼ 3.08, P < 0.05, svc,
k ¼ 77; see Figure 3A and Supplementary Table S4] during the
processing of angry compared to neutral faces. There was also a
marginally significant negative change in left amygdala–vACC
connectivity for Anger > Neutral in the HCs alone (P ¼ 0.07, svc;
see Figure 3B), but not in the CD subgroups considered sepa-
rately. Of interest, the negative changes in amygdala–vACC con-
nectivity observed across all subjects were no longer significant
when controlling for overall psychopathic traits (Ps > 0.68).
An ANOVA revealed that there was no main effect of group
on connectivity between vACC and either the left (P ¼ 0.72, svc)
or right amygdala (P ¼ 0.79, svc). No regions were significant at
P < 0.05, FWE whole-brain correction. There were still no signifi-
cant main effects of group on connectivity when covarying for
ADHD symptoms, psychopathic traits, or CU traits (Ps > 0.68).
Correlations between clinical symptoms, personality
measures and amygdala–vACC connectivity
Across all 71 subjects, irrespective of group, there was no signif-
icant correlation between psychopathic traits and connectivity
between vACC and left (P ¼ 0.14, svc) or right amygdala (P ¼ 0.18
svc). Callous–unemotional traits were also not correlated with
amygdala–vACC connectivity in either hemisphere (Ps > 0.24).

connectivity
when
collapsing

the

subgroups
[t(44) ¼ 3.21, P < 0.04, svc, k ¼ 235; Figure 4]. Although in the
same direction, this correlation did not reach significance when
using the right amygdala as a seed (P ¼ 0.12, svc).
When considering the CO–CD and AO–CD groups separately,
we found that psychopathic traits were significantly correlated
with left amygdala–vACC connectivity in the AO–CD group
alone (P ¼ 0.002, svc, k ¼ 470; Figure 4B). As psychopathic traits
increased, the change in connectivity between the amygdala
and vACC when processing angry faces became more negative
(i.e. closer to the average change observed in HCs). This correla-
tion was not significant in the CO–CD group alone (P ¼ 0.29, svc),
possibly because the range of YPI scores was more restricted in
this subgroup (Figure 4B). In addition, there was no significant
correlation between CU traits and connectivity between vACC
and either left (P ¼ 0.25, svc) or right amygdala (P ¼ 0.29, svc).

were
positively

(r ¼ 0.37, P < 0.05). Lastly, there were no significant correlations

Connectivity between the amygdala and vACC—effects
of condition and group for sad vs neutral faces
Across all subjects, a one sample t-test revealed a negative
change in connectivity between
vACC and left amygdala
[t(70) ¼ 3.12, P < 0.04, svc, k ¼ 117; Supplementary Table S5], but
not right amygdala (P ¼ 0.16, svc; Supplementary Table S6).
These changes in connectivity were not significant when con-
sidering the HCs alone (Ps > 0.36, svc).
An ANOVA revealed that there was no main effect of group
on either left or right amygdala connectivity with the vACC
(Ps > 0.91, svc), and no regions showed significant differences in
amygdala connectivity between groups at P < 0.05, FWE whole-
brain correction. No main effects of group on amygdala–vACC
connectivity emerged when covarying out ADHD symptoms,
psychopathic traits, or CU traits (Ps > 0.51, svc).
Correlations between clinical symptoms, personality
measures and amygdala–vACC connectivity
There were no significant correlations between left or right
amygdala–vACC connectivity and either psychopathic traits, CU
traits, ADHD symptoms or current or lifetime CD symptoms
(Ps > 0.14, svc). This was the case when considering either the
total sample (N ¼ 71 or n ¼ 65 for correlations with ADHD symp-
toms), or the CD group alone.
Discussion
The aims of this study were to investigate changes in effective
connectivity between the amygdala and the rest of the brain
(with a particular focus on the vACC) during facial emotion
processing in youths with CD, and to evaluate the impact of
overall psychopathic traits, CU traits and CD symptom severity
on effective connectivity. We also tested for group differences
in neural responses to angry or sad vs neutral faces, and the
effects of psychopathic traits, CU traits and CD symptom
severity on neural activity. Contrary to our first hypothesis, we
found that adolescents with CD did not differ from controls in

 terms of effective connectivity from the amygdala seed region
to the vACC or the rest of the brain, and this was true when con-
sidering either angry vs neutral or sad vs neutral faces. Instead,
we found a negative correlation between psychopathic traits
and amygdala–vACC effective connectivity for angry vs neutral
faces in the CD group (i.e. connectivity was more negative in
those with higher levels of psychopathic traits). This finding
was not in the direction we predicted—instead, it was the par-
ticipants with CD and lower levels of psychopathic traits who
showed the most atypical pattern of amygdala–vACC effective
connectivity, whereas those with elevated psychopathic traits
resembled typically developing controls (they also showed a
negative change in connectivity when processing angry vs neu-
tral faces). This relationship between psychopathic traits and
effective connectivity was observed in the CD group as a whole
(regardless of age-of-onset), but was particularly marked in the
adolescence–onset CD group. This may reflect the fact that this
group showed greater variation in psychopathic traits relative
to the CO–CD group (Figure 4B). In contrast to the findings
obtained for angry faces, psychopathic (or CU) traits were not
significantly correlated with amygdala–vACC connectivity for
sad vs neutral faces. Importantly, the correlations between psy-
chopathic traits and effective connectivity for angry vs neutral
remained significant when covarying out either current or life-
time CD symptoms (or ADHD symptoms), whereas there were
no
significant
correlations
between
CD
symptoms
and
amygdala–vACC connectivity. These results suggest that the
association between psychopathic traits and amygdala–vACC
functional connectivity during the processing of angry faces is
partly independent of CD or ADHD symptoms. We also found
no significant relationships between CU traits and amygdala–
vACC connectivity, suggesting that the effects of psychopathic
traits on effective connectivity were not solely driven by the
affective/interpersonal aspects of psychopathy.
Consistent with our earlier findings obtained with an over-
lapping sample (Passamonti et al., 2010), we observed group
differences in amygdala activation, with CD participants show-
ing reduced amygdala responses to angry or sad vs neutral
faces. We also confirmed our earlier finding that the amygdala
response to angry faces was lower in both of the CD subgroups,
whereas these groups did not differ from each other. However,
group differences in amygdala activity did not appear to be
explained by group differences in amygdala–vACC connectivity.
Interestingly, we did not find any significant effects of psycho-
pathic or CU traits on amygdala responses to angry or sad faces.
These findings diverge from those of previous studies showing
reduced amygdala responses to fearful facial expressions in
adolescents with DBDs and psychopathic traits (Marsh et al.,
2008) or conduct problems and CU traits (Jones et al., 2009). This
may be related to the use of different emotional stimuli (fearful
vs angry expressions) or sample characteristics.
The present results suggest that the negative changes typi-
cally seen in amygdala–vACC effective connectivity during the
processing of angry vs neutral faces are attenuated (or even
shifted in the opposite direction) in adolescents with CD and
low levels of psychopathic traits. This is consistent with the
idea that emotion dysregulation plays an important role in the
etiology of antisocial behavior which occurs in the absence of
psychopathic traits—deficits in the regulation of emotional
responses, possibly due to impairments in top-down control
mechanisms, are argued to lead to excessive reactions to provo-
cation and reactive aggression (Frick and Viding, 2009). Over
time, this may lead to an increased risk for disorders related to
emotion dysregulation, such as anxiety or depression, amongst
this group (Frick and White, 2008). It is interesting that the asso-
ciation between psychopathic traits and aberrant effective con-
nectivity was specific to angry faces, which are typically
considered threat cues—one possibility is that regulatory con-
trol mechanisms are more strongly engaged when processing
angry faces, and therefore the difficulties found in those with
CD and lower levels of psychopathic traits are more apparent
under
such
conditions.

 relatively unambiguous distress cues. Previous behavioral stud-
ies have shown more pronounced anger recognition deficits in
youth with antisocial behavior without psychopathic traits than
their psychopathic counterparts (Dadds et al., 2006). This study
also demonstrates that healthy adolescents show a significant
(negative) change in effective connectivity between the amyg-
dala and vACC during the processing of angry vs neutral faces,
replicating findings in healthy adults (Passamonti et al., 2008).
This study had several strengths. It included one of the larg-
est CD samples in the fMRI literature (Alegria et al., 2016;
although see Aghajani et al., 2017). The participants were also
well-characterized in terms of comorbid disorders, psycho-
pathic traits and CU traits and the CD and control groups were
matched in age and IQ. We note that the study was restricted to
male participants, which limits the generalizability of the find-
ings, but also ensures the results are easier to interpret, given
that sex differences in brain activity during face processing
have been reported (Fusar-Poli et al., 2009; Schneider et al., 2011).
In terms of limitations, the cross-sectional design means that
we cannot infer a causal relationship between (low) psycho-
pathic traits and changes in amygdala–vACC connectivity. We
note that our CD group was a selected sample of young people
who had either been arrested or excluded from school, thus it is
possible that a weaker relationship between psychopathic traits
and effective connectivity would be observed in a more repre-
sentative sample. We also performed a large number of compar-
isons between groups and across multiple behavioural and
personality measures, correcting the results at the single analy-
sis level. Nevertheless, we had specific hypotheses regarding
amygdala–vACC connectivity, and many of the subsidiary anal-
yses were performed to test the impact of potential confound-
ing variables, such as ADHD comorbidity. Finally, although the
YPI is a widely-used measure of juvenile psychopathic traits,
relying solely on self-report measures of psychopathic traits is
not optimal as young people with CD may lie or lack insight into
their own personality characteristics. Future studies should
therefore collect multiple measures of psychopathic traits, and
use both self-report and parent-report questionnaires.
Conclusions
We found that changes in effective connectivity between the
amygdala and vACC during the processing of angry faces were
negatively correlated with psychopathic traits, such that func-
tional coupling between these regions was less negative in the
CD participants with lower levels of psychopathic traits than in
those with elevated psychopathic traits. However, there were
no significant correlations between psychopathic or CU traits
and amygdala activation to angry (or sad) faces. In contrast, par-
ticipants with CD (regardless of age-of-onset) showed reduced
bilateral amygdala responses to angry vs neutral faces, but did
not differ from controls in effective connectivity between the
amygdala and associated brain regions. These results provide
some of the most convincing evidence available to date that the
effects of CD and psychopathic traits on neural activity and
functional interactions between brain regions are at least partly
dissociable. These findings also emphasize the importance of
using effective connectivity methods to characterize the neural
mechanisms underlying CD and psychopathic traits.
