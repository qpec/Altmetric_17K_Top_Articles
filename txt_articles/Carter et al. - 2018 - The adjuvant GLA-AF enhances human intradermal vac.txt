Adjuvants are key to shaping the immune response to vaccination, but to date, no adjuvant suitable for human 
use has been developed for intradermal vaccines. These vaccines could be self-administered and sent through the 
mail as they do not require long needles or technical expertise in immunization. In the event of a pandemic out-
break, this approach could alleviate the congregation of patients in health centers and thus reduce the potential of 
these centers to enhance the spread of lethal infection. A reliable and potent vaccine system for self-administration 
would provide an effective countermeasure for delivery through existing product distribution infrastructure. We 
report results from preclinical and clinical trials that demonstrate the feasibility of an adjuvanted, intradermal vac-
cine that induced single shot protection in ferrets and seroprotection in humans against one of the more lethal 
strains of pandemic flu, Indonesia H5N1. In the human trial, the vaccine was safe and clinical responses were 
above approvable endpoints for a protective flu vaccine. Inclusion of a modern TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) agonist– 
based adjuvant was critical to the development of the response in the intradermal groups. In humans, this is the 
first report of a safe and effective intradermal adjuvant, GLA-AF (aqueous formulation of glucopyranosyl lipid ad-
juvant), and provides a future path for developing a vaccine-device combination for distribution by mail and self- 
administration in case of a pandemic.
INTRODUCTION
An effective response to an emerging pandemic on a global scale will 
require a combination of technologies to enable sufficient vaccine 
supply, distribution, and effectiveness. Modern manufacturing ap-
proaches rely on producing defined antigens in recombinant systems 
including mammalian cells (1, 2), Escherichia coli (3), baculovirus (4), 
and plants (5, 6).
Influenza virus–like particles (VLPs)—noninfectious particles re-
sembling the influenza virus—represent a promising alternative to 
inactivated and split-influenza virions as antigens. These VLPs are 
expressed using the exact hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of the rec-
ommended wild-type influenza viruses. The multi-array arrangement 
of HA antigens in particle-based vaccines allows for better antigen 
presentation and uptake by antigen-presenting cells. These antigens 
can thus induce a more potent immune response through both hu-
moral and cellular components of the immune system (7).
Medicago has developed a plant-based transient influenza VLP 
manufacturing platform capable of producing VLPs with unprece-
dented speed, with the ability to deliver the first vaccine doses 19 days 
after a new strain sequence is identified (8). This platform thus has 
the potential to respond to strain mismatch. Immune responses gen-
erated by influenza VLP vaccines can also provide cross-protection 
against strains different from those included in the vaccine, another 
advantage of the product for both seasonal and pandemic flu (9, 10).
Moreover, adding to the challenges of rapid production and distri-
bution in the general population, vaccines against influenza strains 
with pandemic potential, such as those from avian origin, generally 
elicit poor antibody responses compared to vaccines against strains 
that cause seasonal flu. To compensate for this limitation, the inclu-
sion of adjuvants and alternative delivery routes are being investi-
gated to reduce the required dose of vaccine, broaden the immune 
response, and increase vaccine effectiveness (11–14).
Intradermal (ID) vaccination has been at the forefront of vaccine im-
provement (15). It has primarily been explored for its ability to gen-
erate equivalent antibody responses at lower doses (“dose-sparing”) 
(16), which is especially important in addressing high-surge situa-
tions, such as flu pandemics, and in global health problems, such as 
polio, where antigen prices limit population-wide coverage (17, 18). 
ID vaccination holds promise to trigger enhanced immune responses 
compared to other routes of immunization when the same dose is 
given—as has been demonstrated in influenza and other viruses 
(11, 19). Using microneedles to harness skin immunity will allow 
the development of self-administration devices. Since these devices 
are deemed painless and could not penetrate deep tissue or blood 
vessels, user error is eliminated or reduced. In addition, microneedle 
patches can be made with dried antigen and adjuvant, providing fur-
ther stability benefits (20).
Adjuvants provide signals to innate immune cells to generate an 
appropriate milieu for the rapid maturation of an adaptive response 
capable of protecting the host organism from disease (21). Inflam-
matory signals induced by the inclusion of the widely used alum salts 
(22, 23) and the more modern squalene-based emulsions can boost 
the magnitude of the response (24), and their combination with spe-
cific stimulators of the innate immune system such as Toll-like re-
ceptor (TLR) agonists has been used to enhance adaptive antibody 
maturation and diversification (14, 25, 26), but certain formulations 
may not be suitable for ID vaccination because of potential reacto-
genicity (27). Because some TLRs are highly expressed by dermal 
dendritic cells and because of their responsiveness to TLR4 agonists

(28), we decided to explore the synergy of combining a novel TLR4 
agonist–based adjuvant with ID delivery.
In our research, we evaluated the synergies of combining three 
technologies to demonstrate proof of concept for a system that could 
be rapidly deployed and profoundly affect the death toll in the case 
of a pandemic outbreak: (i) a hollow microneedle that can deliver 
vaccine to the immunologically rich dermis, resulting in the potential 
ability to self-administer and spare doses of antigen (15); (ii) recom-
binant flu VLPs that are being manufactured by Medicago, enabling 
rapid response to newly identified antigen sequences in drifted flu 
strains (10); and (iii) a platform adjuvant technology based on a syn-
thetic TLR4 ligand that stimulates the immune system and boosts 
the effectiveness of recombinant vaccines, enabling dose-sparing and 
overcoming immune senescence (29, 30). In these preclinical and 
clinical studies, our aim was to produce a vaccine candidate with the 
potential for dose-sparing and self-administration; thus, we focused on 
combining the VLP with adjuvant formulations suitable for ID use.
Previous studies had demonstrated that the Medicago plant-based 
production technology can produce a safe and effective VLP vaccine 
antigen (10, 31) and that glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA)–based 
adjuvants can provide powerful immune-stimulating effects in hu-
mans (32, 33). Medicago produced the H5-VLP pandemic influenza 
vaccine antigen by transient expression of a recombinant protein in 
nontransgenic plants, using an agrobacterial expression vector. The 
A/Indonesia/5/05 strain was selected because it was recommended 
by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a candidate vaccine, 
in addition to it being one of the most virulent H5N1 strains, having 
a mortality rate of 80% with 141 confirmed cases in 2008 (34).

RESULTS
Murine immunogenicity studies
Initial studies using the Medicago H5-VLP formulated in GLA-based 
adjuvants injected subcutaneously demonstrated potent immune 
responses in mice. Overall, antibody titers in the adjuvanted groups 
were markedly higher than those in the groups immunized in the 
absence of these agonists with almost three orders of magnitude 
enhancement of IgG2C titers, consistent with the T helper cell 1 
(TH1) biasing effect of these adjuvants (Fig. 1A). The agonists also 
enabled a durable immune response as bone marrow– 
derived plas-
ma cells were only detected in the TLR4- 
containing vaccine groups 
(Fig. 1B). Finally, in terms of functional antibody, hemagglutina-
tion inhibition (HAI) titers were detected in the adjuvanted groups 
against the homologous virus and in the GLA-AF (aqueous formu-
lation of GLA)–adjuvanted group not only against the homolo-
gous virus but also against a drifted strain (Fig. 1C).
Safety studies in guinea pigs
All H5-VLP vaccines were considered safe, as measured by skin re-
actions, temperatures, and weights. The skin reactogenicity was ob-
served primarily with the H5-VLP vaccines combined with GLA-AF, 
SE (stable emulsion), or GLA-SE formulations; no adverse tem-
perature spikes or decreases in weight were observed in any of the 
vaccine groups. GLA-SE had significantly higher erythema and 
edema scores than any of the other formulations (fig. S1); it was 
therefore decided to proceed with GLA-AF intradermally as the lead 
candidate.
Ferret challenge studies
Next, we tested protective efficacy in the ferret challenge model. 
Since the pandemic vaccine is intended for rapid response to a pan-
demic threat, efficacy was tested after a single administration of the 
vaccine, the desired scenario for the self-administered pandemic re-
sponse. Groups of ferrets were given the H5-VLP intradermally or 
intramuscularly with and without GLA-AF, a formulation suitable 
for ID delivery, or an alum adjuvanted control formulation given 
intramuscularly. There were no adverse responses observed with any 
of the vaccines at the site of injection. Similarly, there was no in-
crease in body temperature with any of the vaccines tested. In these 
studies, a single ID administration of the H5-VLP antigen formulated in 
GLA-AF completely protected ferrets against lethality after heterolo-
gous challenge with pandemic influenza (Fig. 2A). Notably, this level 
of protection was seen after a single vaccination with antigen de-
rived from sequences of the A/Indonesia/5/05 virus strain and chal-
lenged with an A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5N1 virus—that is, a clade 
2.1.3.2 immunization showing protection against a virus from clade 1. 
Other parameters were measured following challenge, including clini-
cal scores and viral titers in nasal lavages (Fig. 2, B and C). While

challenge. All the ferrets succumbed to infection in the saline-treated group and in the group that received an intramuscular (IM) immunization with the unadjuvanted 
H5-VLP, whereas one ferret survived in the intradermally immunized group that received unadjuvanted H5-VLP. (B) Viral titers. Nasal swabs were performed to measure 
virus in the upper airways on the days indicated. Paralleling the survival data, the adjuvanted groups appeared to control the infection and rapidly demonstrated lower 
viral titers than those found in all the unadjuvanted groups. (C) Clinical scores. Clinical signs of morbidity including lethargy, body temperature, anorexia, and dyspnea 
were monitored daily. PFU, plaque-forming units.

all adjuvanted vaccine groups demonstrated at least 80% survival, the 
adjuvanted ID group had 100% survival and was not inferior to the IM 
groups. On the basis of these observations, it was determined that 
an intradermally administered, adjuvanted pandemic flu vaccine was 
feasible for human use and the H5-VLP + GLA-AF was selected for in-
clusion in a GLP (Good Laboratory Practices)  rabbit toxicity study 
and for human clinical trials.
Human clinical study
A first-in-man, phase 1, multicenter, randomized, open-label trial 
of the pandemic influenza vaccine H5-VLP and GLA-AF was com-
pleted in more than 100 volunteers to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
and immunogenicity of the adjuvanted H5-VLP vaccine following 
IM or ID administration in healthy adult subjects. The licensed H5N1 
vaccine from the Strategic National Stockpile [influenza virus vaccine, 
H5N1 (Sanofi Pasteur)] was included as a control group (see Table 1 
for groups and treatment assignments).
Safety
The vaccines were safe and well tolerated in this study, with the main 
notable difference—as expected—being the fact that transient ery-
thema was seen in the ID groups. No serious adverse events (AEs) 
or AEs of special interest were reported. All study injection–related 
AEs occurred during period I and were of grade 1 or grade 2 severity. 
The most frequent study injection–related AEs were injection site 
tenderness, injection site pain, fatigue, headache, and injection site 
erythema/redness (tables S2 and S3).
Immunogenicity
HAI titers are a commonly used efficacy surrogate accepted by both 
U.S. and European regulatory bodies for influenza vaccines. High 
HAI titers have been observed to correlate with clinical protection. 
Individual subjects’ HAI geometric mean titers (GMTs) were calcu-
lated from assay replicates and are summarized in Fig. 3. Serocon-
version, seroprotection, and GMT fold increases were defined on 
the basis of CHMP (Committee for Medicinal Products for Human 
Use) criteria for seasonal flu re-licensure (35). While there were no 
statistically significant differences in seroprotection and seroconver-
sion rates (Table 2), statistically significant differences were observed 
in GMTs. The group receiving H5-VLP + GLA-AF by the ID route 
had the highest HAI titers; the increased immunogenicity compared 
to the group receiving H5-VLP alone demonstrated the utility of the 
GLA-AF adjuvant when given intradermally. No statistically signif-
icant differences were observed when comparing the adjuvanted ID 
vaccine to the GLA or alum adjuvanted IM groups. Both groups 
demonstrated comparable HAI responses after one immunization 
with good rates of seroprotection at day 21 and were similar to the 
other control groups with a trend of higher responses in the ID group. 
To examine the breadth of vaccine responses, we tested HAI against

responses were compared between days 0 and 42 to calculate geometric mean increases (GMI, top row), and the percentage of subjects seroconverting was plotted

differences were found among the treatment groups at day 42 (P = 0.036 for seroconversion and P = 0.014 for seroprotection), but pairwise comparisons with 
multiplicity adjustments failed to reach significance.

different strains: a clade 1 virus (Vietnam), a clade 2.1 virus (Indone-
sia), and a clade 2.3.4 virus (Anhui). The Indonesia A/Indonesia/ 
5/05 strain is homologous to the Medicago H5-VLP antigen. This 
strain shares 98.9% similarity with the in-clade Anhui strain and has 
97.9% similarity to the clade 1 Vietnam strain. The Vietnam and 
Anhui strains are 97.7% similar to each other. When looking at an-
tibody responses that could recognize drifted strains, the adjuvanted 
ID groups looked more potent at providing human immune re-
sponses to strains not present in the vaccine preparation (Fig. 4). In 
the GLA ID groups, more than 40% (the approvable endpoint for 
flu vaccines) of subjects seroconverted to the more Indonesia H5–
related Anhui virus, and this group also had a significant portion of 
subjects who also recognized an even further drifted Vietnam H5 
virus, demonstrating the ability of the adjuvanted vaccine to provide 
broadened protection when given intradermally.
DISCUSSION
Various strategies have been developed to date to bolster and broaden 
immunogenicity, including increasing the dose, adjuvantation with 
alum or modern adjuvants, and applying the vaccine intradermally, 
although there has been no report in humans of a successful combi-
nation of these approaches. The lack of success to date may be due 
to the lack of adjuvants suitable for ID administration that could en-
able defined vaccine antigens to elicit a potent immune response 
when given intradermally. We present here GLA-AF as an adjuvant 
that safely enhances human immune responses to ID vaccination.
Developing an effective vaccine for an emerging pandemic pre-
sents numerous challenges: The protein sequence of the antigen is not 
known a priori; thus, stockpiling vaccine is an issue since the time 
between identification of the antigen and deployment of the vaccine 
is more limited than in any other setting. Attempts to switch from 
the current egg-based systems to a recombinant system where a rapid 
production response could be feasible have been made. However, the 
antigens produced in these systems have not been highly immuno-
genic and still require syringe/needle administration. Implementing 
a population-wide program at the peak of a pandemic will be prob-
lematic owing to the burden on health care workers who themselves 
may become infected. In addition, subjects congregating to receive 
vaccines could infect each other, accelerating the spread of the dis-
ease. An overburdened health care system could result in a devastating 
death toll if a highly contagious and lethal pathogen were to emerge.
Here, three technologies that complement each other enable a 
pandemic countermeasure that could be deployed using existing in-
frastructure. The first is a plant-based expression system, not reliant 
on genetically engineered plants, and that can initiate vaccine manufac-
turing in less than 3 weeks after identification of the pandemic 
strain and match its exact HA sequence. The second is an adjuvant 
system that has been specifically formulated to be administered in-
tradermally and, as we show here, that boosts responses to a point 
where they are as good as or better than those achieved by IM 
administration. The third is a commercially registered hollow micro-
needle device for efficient and consistent ID injections. This noninfe-
riority of the ID route is an important finding in that it would allow 
the development of a device for pandemic response that could be dis-
tributed by existing postal infrastructure and be self-administered.
Another important finding of the research presented is the abil-
ity of appropriately stimulated dermal cells to generate an immune 
response that has the ability to neutralize drifted viral strains, as was 
seen in the studies here with single shot protection in the ferret het-
erologous challenge. A difficult problem with pandemic prepared-
ness is the inability to predict exactly which strain of pathogen may 
cause a pandemic outbreak. Notably, the influenza H5 stockpile con-
sists of a flu vaccine based on the Vietnam H5 virus, but if a drifted 
viral strain were to emerge, then it would be difficult to predict 
whether the stockpile would be able to provide satisfactory protection 
against the emerging pathogen. Each of the platform technologies 
combined herein has demonstrated some ability to broaden protec-
tion, and we believe that combining these together would be a promi-
nent step toward a much broader protection of pandemic strains. The 
ability of the adjuvanted ID vaccine to provide both noninferior pro-
tection to the IM injection and broader protection against other strains 
of virus makes this route particularly interesting as a pandemic counter-
measure. The ability of dermal cell populations like Langerhans cells 
to present to CD4+ T cells and induce T follicular helper cells has 
been recently investigated, and these interactions are probably criti-
cal for efficient germinal cell formation and hypermutation, leading 
to the broadening of protection (36, 37).
We have developed a prototype approach that combines ID admin-
istration, an adjuvant for ID use, and plant-produced, recombinant 
VLPs. The study presented here shows the feasibility of ID immuni-
zation, and while the technology will need further optimization to 
protect against pandemic flu, future studies can move this platform 
toward human implementation. The technologies will synergize to 
produce a potent immune response in humans with protection against 
drifted pathogens in an embodiment that allows self-administration. 
The GLA-AF adjuvant powers this approach by enhancing intrader-
mally administered vaccines and may enable government counter-
measures that are delivered to users to eliminate congregation at 
clinical sites in case of a pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All murine and guinea pig experiments and protocols used in this 
study were approved by the Infectious Disease Research Institute’s 
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). The ferret 
experimental protocols used in this study were approved by the 
Colorado State University IACUC.
Murine experiments
Female C57BL/6 mice (purchased from Charles River Laboratories) 
were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and in accord-
ance with animal procedures approved by the Infectious Disease 
Research Institute’s IACUC. Mice entered experiments at 6 to 8 weeks 
of age and were immunized by subcutaneous injection at the base of 
the tail. Mice were injected a total of two times in a 3-week interval. 
Prebleed samples were taken at day −6, with immunization occur-
ring at day 0. At days 14 and 40, sera were collected for HAI and 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bone marrow was harvested 
for detection of long-lived plasma cells. Antigen-specific mouse bone 
marrow plasma cells were quantified by ELISPOT as previously de-
scribed, 3 weeks after the second immunization (38). A purified rH5 
antigen (Indonesia strain) purchased from Protein Sciences was used 
in the ELISPOT. HAIs were performed by MRIGlobal.
Guinea pig studies
The objective of this experiment was to test dose-sparing and reacto-
genicity of the formulations using ID delivery. Five female Hartley

guinea pigs (purchased from Charles River Laboratories) were used 
per group. ID delivery was achieved using NanoPass MicronJet micro-
needles, as described below. Guinea pigs were immunized two times, 
3 weeks apart (day 0 and day 21), and injection sites were scored for 
erythema and edema at 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours after injection. Body 
weights and temperatures were also monitored during the study. All 
experimental procedures were carried out using approved anesthesia 
protocols.
Ferret studies
Ferrets were immunized once on day 0 (either intradermally or in-
tramuscularly, as indicated) and bled on days 0, 14, and 21 before 
challenge. HAI titers were performed on the serum timepoints. 
QuantiGene assays were performed at prebleed and at 4 and 24 hours 
after injection on whole blood for innate cytokine message analysis. 
Draize scoring was performed to determine reactogenicity at 0, 4, 
24, 48, 72 hours after injection. Ferrets were challenged 3 weeks after 
immunization (day 21) with A/Vietnam/1203/04 H5N1. Clinical signs 
of morbidity, including weight loss, lethargy, temperature elevation 
using temperature chips (Bio Medic Data Systems), anorexia, and 
dyspnea, were collected daily. Nasal swabs were taken to measure 
virus in the upper airways on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. Ferrets were 
euthanized 14 days after challenge, and lungs, heart, brain, kidneys, 
and spleen were harvested for viral titers. Histology was performed 
on lungs, heart, brain, kidneys, and spleen.
Clinical trial
This study was conducted at Covance Clinical Research Unit centers 
in Madison, WI, Dallas, TX, and Daytona Beach, FL (ClinicalTrials.
gov identifier: NCT01657929). H5-VLP, GLA-AF, and the stockpiled 
vaccine (Vietnam strain) were administered at 20, 2.5, and 90 g, 
respectively. Males and females between 18 and ≤49 years of age 
were included in the study and immunized in groups, as shown in 
Table 1. The flowchart and table in fig. S2 and table S1 provide de-
tails on assessments and timing of immunizations. Subjects had to 
be in good general health as confirmed by a medical history and 
physical exam, vital signs, and screening laboratories conducted no 
more than 30 days before study injection administration and had to 
have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening. A further de-
scription of the study population is provided in the Supplementary 
Materials.
Vaccine preparation
The H5-VLP pandemic influenza vaccine antigen was produced by 
Medicago by transient expression of a recombinant protein, the HA 
from the A/Indonesia/5/05, clade 2.1, H5N1 strain, in nontransgenic 
plants, using an agrobacterial expression vector. The A/Indonesia/5/05 
strain was selected because it was recommended by the WHO as a 
candidate vaccine, in addition to it being one of the most virulent 
H5N1 strains, having a mortality rate of 80% with 141 confirmed cases 
in 2008 (34). Previous studies had demonstrated that the Medicago 
plant-based production technology can produce a safe and effective 
vaccine antigen (10, 31) and that GLA-based adjuvants can provide 
powerful immune-stimulating effects in humans (32, 33).
GLA-based adjuvants
GLA is a synthetic TLR4 agonist that was synthesized at Corden 
Pharma. 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) was 
purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. GLA-AF was manufactured by 
mixing DPPC and the TLR4 ligand at a 2:1 DPPC/GLA molar ratio 
in chloroform, which was then evaporated. Ultrapure water was 
added to the resulting dried film, and the mixture was sonicated in 
a VWR 75D or Crest Powersonic CP230D sonicating water bath at 
~60°C until the formulation was translucent.
ID delivery
ID injection was done using the NanoPass MicronJet600 device 
(NanoPass), which is a disposable three-pronged, 0.6-mm hollow 
microneedle device that attaches to any standard Luer lock or Luer 
tip syringe.
Immunogenicity analyses
Blood samples were obtained from subjects for HAI, which was per-
formed as described in (10) with determinations on days 0, 21, and 
42. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected on days 0, 10, 
and 31 (10 days after vaccination).
Statistical/bioinformatic analyses
Statistically significant differences between groups in the animal experi-
ments were determined by pairwise analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
comparisons with Tukey’s multicomparison test in GraphPad Prism 
version 7.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software (www.graphpad.com). 
Bioinformatic sequence alignments were performed at the EMBL 
(European Molecular Biology Laboratory) website using the EMBOSS 
(European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite) needle algorithm (39).
