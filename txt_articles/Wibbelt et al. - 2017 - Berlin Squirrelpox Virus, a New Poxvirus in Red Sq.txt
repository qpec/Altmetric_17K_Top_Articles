Near Berlin, Germany, several juvenile red squirrels (Sci-
urus vulgaris) were found with moist, crusty skin lesions. 
Histology, electron microscopy, and cell culture isolation 
revealed an orthopoxvirus-like infection. Subsequent PCR 
and genome analysis identified a new poxvirus (Berlin 
squirrelpox virus) that could not be assigned to any known 
poxvirus genera.
T
he Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is the only 
species of tree squirrels endemic throughout most of 
Europe. Although they are usually abundant, red squirrels 
are endangered or extinct in some regions in Great Britain 
and Ireland that are co-inhabited by invasive eastern gray 
squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis), which were introduced from 
North America in the late 19th century. One major threat is 
the transmission of squirrelpox virus (SQPV) from the gray 
squirrel reservoir host to red squirrels, which succumb to le-
thal infections (1). SQPV had been assigned to the parapox-
viruses due to morphological similarities (2), but the latest 
viral genome data placed it in a separate clade within the 
poxvirus family (3). Recently, different poxviruses have 
been associated with similar lesions in American red squir-
rels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) from Canada (4), but except 
for a single case report from Spain (5), no poxvirus infec-
tions in squirrels have been reported in continental Europe.
The Study
In 2015 and 2016, at least 10 abandoned weak juvenile red 
squirrels were submitted to a sanctuary near Berlin, Ger-
many. The animals had exudative and erosive-to-ulcerative 
dermatitis with serocellular crusts at auricles, noses, digits, 
tails, and genital/perianal regions. Skin specimens from af-
fected animals were investigated by electron microscopy 
(EM) and PCR. Three animals that died under care were 
submitted for necropsy. We obtained samples of all organs 
for histological and PCR examination. We used 1 sample 
of a skin lesion for virus propagation in cell culture.
EM-negative staining of skin lesions from all animals 
led to the discovery of brick-shaped poxvirus particles with 
irregular threadlike surface fibers and an average size of 
294 nm × 221 nm (Figure 1). Pathological findings of corre-
sponding skin lesions were consistent with poxvirus infec-
tion (ballooning degeneration of epidermal keratinocytes, 
numerous intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, epidermal 
ulceration with suppurative inflammation, and secondary 
bacterial infection). All inner organs had either no patho-
logical changes or lesions unrelated to poxvirus infection.
To confirm the morphologic diagnosis, we extracted 
DNA from skin lesions and performed various PCRs. An 
orthopoxvirus (OPV)–specific PCR showed negative results 
(6); a parapoxvirus (PPV)–specific PCR (6), a leporipoxvirus-
specific PCR (A. Nitsche and L. Schrick, unpub. data), and a 
poxvirus-screening PCR (7) were positive for some samples. 
Obtained sequence fragments indicated poxviral relatedness 
but did not allow for the assignment to a poxvirus genus. Thus, 
we performed massively parallel sequencing. We directly sub-
jected DNA extracted from a skin lesion on the foot of a dead 
animal to Nextera XT Library preparation and sequenced it 
on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, 
CA, USA), yielding 7,242,301 paired-end reads (150 + 150 
bases, rapid run mode). Mapping (8) the obtained reads to all 
poxvirus reference sequences available in GenBank in high-
sensitivity mode provided no notable results, which pointed 
to a virus with a highly deviant genome. Therefore, we sepa-
rated poxviral reads from background data using RAMBO-K 
version 1.2 (9) and assembled the resulting 1,520,811 reads 
(10), yielding 1 single contig of 142,974 bp with ≈460-fold 
coverage after manual iterative mapping and scaffolding. We 
confirmed the genomic sequence by resequencing (Illumina 
MiSeq) of a Vero E6 cell-culture isolate obtained from a dif-
ferent skin specimen of the same animal. We named the new 
virus Berlin SQPV (BerSQPV), and uploaded the combined 
sequence information to GenBank (accession no. MF503315). 
Direct sequencing of DNA from skin samples of 3 other ani-
mals from the same origin yielded sequences with >99.9% 
identity to BerSQPV.
We compared characteristics of BerSQPV to related 
viruses and found that the EM structure shows features 
typical for OPV but the genome size of ≈143 kb is more 
consistent with PPV or SQPV from the United Kingdom 
(11) than with the large genome of OPV, whereas the gua-
nine-cytosine (GC) content of 38.5% is more consistent

with OPV and leporipoxvirus than with PPV and SQPV 
from the United Kingdom. Therefore, we explored the 
genomic relationship of BerSQPV to other chordopoxvi-
ruses. Pairwise alignments of each of the chordopoxvirus 
genomes available in GenBank with the BerSQPV genome 
resulted in a pairwise identity of at most 47% to tanapox 
virus isolate TPV-Kenya (accession no. EF420156.1). The 
retrieved phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) demonstrates that 
BerSQPV cannot be assigned to any of the known pox-
virus genera; moreover, it does not cluster with the only 
other squirrel poxvirus with a published genome sequence 
(11). Further phylogenetic analyses based on conserved 
single genes frequently used for poxvirus tree calculations 
(A3L, F10L+F12L, F13L, E13L, E9L [VACV Copenha-
gen nomenclature]) showed similar results (A56R was not 
used for tree calculations because this open reading frame 
is too divergent among the Chordopoxvirinae), with Ber-
SQPV forming a unique branch (data not shown). In addi-
tion, any partial sequences of SQPV available in GenBank 
were aligned to BerSQPV, showing a maximal sequence 
identity of 64.3% to gene E9L (GenBank accession

Figure 2. Phylogenetic position of BerSQPV (bold) from a red squirrel in Berlin, Germany, within the Chordopoxvirinae. We used MAFFT 
(12) to perform multiple alignments of all complete genome sequences within a species of the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily available in 
GenBank. The minimum pairwise identity found within any of these intraspecies alignments was 79.1%; the maximum pairwise identity 
of BerSQPV with any chordopoxvirus genome available was 47%. Because of this extreme difference in minimum pairwise identities, 
we selected individual prototype genomes for each species and the viruses with highest identity to BerSQPV for phylogenetic analysis 
(as indicated in figure). We performed a multiple alignment of these representative sequences with the BerSQPV genome and removed 
low-quality regions from the alignment using Gblocks version 0.91(13), yielding a stripped alignment of 52,563 gap-free positions. The 
maximum-likelihood tree was then calculated using PhyML(14) (general time reversible plus gamma, 4 substitution rate categories,

gans from 3 affected squirrels necropsied in 2015 (Table). 
Organ tissues yielded high BerSQPV DNA loads in the af-
fected skin but low viral DNA loads for inner organs, find-
ings in concordance with pathological findings, indicating 
the detection of viral DNA in the blood homogenously dis-
tributed throughout the organs with specific tropism for the 
skin. Low virus loads in inner organs are usually observed 
in poxvirus infections that do not generalize. PCR results 
indicate that this virus has been circulating in the Berlin 
area over the past 10 years.
Conclusions
We describe a new poxvirus, BerSQPV, isolated from 
red squirrels in Berlin, Germany, that causes pathological 
changes consistent with other epidermal poxvirus infections. 
Genome analysis revealed a unique sequence within the 
poxvirus family, as BerSQPV is not clustering to other pox-
virus genera, including UK SQPV from red squirrels from 
Great Britain. In contrast to UK SQPV, which resembles 
PPV ultrastructurally (2), the ultrastructure of BerSQPV is 
comparable to that of OPV. Two other poxviruses from tree 
squirrels with ultrastructural appearance similar to BerSQPV 
have been reported: a Eurasian red squirrel from Spain with 
epidermal poxvirus lesions (5) and American red squir-
rels from Canada (15). Although no sequence information 
is available for the SQPV from Spain, the partial sequence 
analysis of SQPV from Canada showed the virus to also be 
distinct from all known mammalian poxviruses but most 
closely related to PPV, followed by UK SQPV (15). 
BerSQPV is suspected to have been circulating for sev-
eral years among Eurasian red squirrels in the greater Ber-
lin area. Although diseased animals in care were handled 
in close contact, caretakers have remained asymptomatic, 
suggesting a negligible risk for human infection. Further 
detailed characterization of the isolated virus is ongoing.
