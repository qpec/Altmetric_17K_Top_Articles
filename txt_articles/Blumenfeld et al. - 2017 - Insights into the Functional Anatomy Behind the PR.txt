Objective.—To provide clinically relevant insights on the identification of the muscles and techniques involved in the
safe and effective use of onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine prophylaxis.
Background.—Although guidance on the use of onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine is available, based on the
Phase III Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Therapy (PREEMPT) clinical program, clinical experience has shown
that insufficient understanding of the anatomy and function of the head and neck muscles may lead to undesirable out-
comes and suboptimal efficacy.
Design/Methods.—Each muscle involved in the standardized PREEMPT injection paradigm is reviewed with a thor-
ough description of each muscle’s anatomy (ie, muscle description and location, innervation, vascular supply) and function.
Key insights based on clinical experience are also provided to help improve outcomes.
Results.—The identification of the muscles in the PREEMPT injection paradigm should be based on each patient’s
unique anatomy and injections should be administered using the advised techniques. A thorough examination of the
patient prior to treatment is also critical to determine if any preexisting conditions may increase the risk for unwanted out-
comes and appropriate expectations should be communicated.
Conclusions.—Thorough knowledge of the functional anatomy of the muscles involved in the standardized PREEMPT
injection paradigm is critical to achieve the efficacy and safety observed in clinical trials. In addition, it is important to
assess a patient’s baseline condition to anticipate the risk for unwanted outcomes that may result from treatment.

 INTRODUCTION
OnabotulinumtoxinA
is
the
only
treatment
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
for the prevention of headaches in patients with
chronic migraine (CM).1 The mechanism of action
of onabotulinumtoxinA in treating pain is most like-
ly related to the inhibition of nociceptive mediator
release from afferent neurons, thereby attenuating
peripheral pain signaling to the brain.2,3 The efficacy
of onabotulinumtoxinA as a prophylactic treatment
for CM may be attributed to the notion that extra-
cranial administration decreases the release of noci-
ceptive mediators and decreases the sensitivity of
meningeal receptors through downregulation of their
activity.2,4 The safety and efficacy of onabotulinum-
toxinA for CM has been demonstrated in the Phase
III Research Evaluating Migraine Prophylaxis Ther-
apy (PREEMPT) clinical program,5-8 which used a
fixed-site, fixed-dose injection paradigm that was
established based on data from earlier clinical trial
experience.9-11 In the United States, the standardized
PREEMPT injection paradigm specifies the usage of
a total dose of 155 Units of onabotulinumtoxinA to
be delivered to 7 specific muscle groups;12 however,
a total dose of up to 195 Units is approved in select
countries allowing for additional injections into the
temporalis, occipitalis and/or trapezius muscles using
a follow-the-pain method.13,14 The 7 specific muscle
groups of the standard paradigm align with the
peripheral
nerve
distribution
of
the
trigeminal,
occipital, and cervical sensory nerves (Fig. 1). The
indicated injection sites were found to be effective
for CM headache prophylaxis.5,6,11
Data from the double-blind phases of the PRE-
EMPT clinical trial program showed neck pain
(6.7%) and muscular weakness (5.5%) as the most
commonly
reported
injection-related
adverse
events; eyelid ptosis was also reported (3.3%).15
Ptosis can be due to different causes (Fig. 2). Pre-
existing eyelid ptosis can be due either to dehis-
cence or weakness of the levator palpebral muscle
with aging. Alternatively it can be associated with
lesions of Cranial Nerve III, also causing weakness
of the levator palpebral superioris, or in cases where
Mueller’s muscle is weakened (ie, Horner’s syn-
drome, where sympathetic innervation is affected).16
Brow ptosis is naturally caused by aging, associated
with a “non-prominent” orbital bone structure (ie,
eye brow ptosis is seldom seen in those patients who
have prominent or deep orbital bone structure).
Weakening of the frontalis muscle both laterally and
medially will also cause eyebrow ptosis. Usually a
medial weakening of the lower one third of the fron-
talis muscle is more symptomatic than associated lat-
eral weakening of the frontalis muscle. In the case
of “pseudo ptosis,” characterized by excessive upper
eyelid skin or blepharochalasis, which is corrected
by surgical blepharoplasty, there is often associated

 compensatory activity in the frontalis muscle to ele-
vate the eyelid.
Based on clinical experience, it has been recog-
nized that an incomplete understanding of the
anatomy and muscle function of the head and neck
can produce adverse events such as lid or brow
ptosis or neck pain and weakness. The appearance
of unwanted outcomes and adverse events may
cause injectors to lower the onabotulinumtoxinA
dose to decrease the likelihood of these events.
Alternately, injectors may also completely omit
treatment of certain muscles or areas of the head

 and neck where pain is present as patients may
request avoidance of those areas impacted by the
injection sites to reduce unwanted outcomes and
adverse events. For optimal efficacy of onabotuli-
numtoxinA,
injections
should
be
administered
every 12 weeks; however, if patients experience
unwanted events, they may delay treatments wait-
ing for these events to resolve. It must be cau-
tioned that lowering doses, avoiding muscles, or
delaying repeat treatments may lead to suboptimal
efficacy.
Thus, there is a need for further guidance in
identifying the correct muscle sites for injection
and in applying optimal techniques to achieve the
efficacy and safety observed in clinical trials. To
do so, it is important to recognize that each
patient’s head and neck anatomy varies and that
treatment should be administered considering an
individual’s unique muscle locations. It is also
imperative to keep in mind that the point of injec-
tion differs from the actual point of delivery at
the tip of the needle. In addition, a thorough and
thoughtful assessment of any preexisting condi-
tions,
which
may
indicate
a
greater
risk
for
unwanted outcomes or adverse events, is needed
at each treatment. Furthermore, it is important to
follow up with a patient to understand their out-
comes and to adjust treatment approaches to
muscle(s) accordingly rather than acting to avoid
or delay injections.
The objective of this manuscript is to review
the relevant anatomical features to help guide the
injection of the mandatory muscles involved in the
fixed-dose,
fixed-site
PREEMPT
injection
para-
digm. A thorough understanding of these factors
will help physicians to strengthen their injection
technique and minimize potential adverse outcomes
for their patients.

of

Units
of
onabotulinumtoxinA to be administered to 31 injec-
tion sites distributed across the corrugator, proce-
rus,

 Corrugator.—Ascending from the bone at the
medial end of the superciliary arch is the corrugator
muscle.16
The
muscle
fibers
pass
laterally
and
slightly upwards and insert into the skin in the mid-
dle of the supraorbital margin and superciliary
arch.17 The corrugator muscle is partially blended
with the orbicularis oculi and occipitofrontalis.17
The temporal branches of the facial nerves inner-
vate
the
corrugator.17
Branches
from
adjacent
arteries, mainly from the superficial temporal and
ophthalmic arteries, provide the vascular supply.17
The supraorbital and supratrochlear nerves pass
through the corrugator muscle.17 The corrugator
muscle acts to pull the eyebrows down and medial-
ly, which mainly causes vertical wrinkle lines to
occur in the skin between the brows.16,17
According
to
the
standardized
PREEMPT
injection paradigm, a total of 5 Units of onabotuli-
numtoxinA is injected into each corrugator muscle
(Fig. 3a).11 The corrugator muscle is situated at the
medial aspect of the orbital rim (bony landmark).
To confirm the location, the patient is asked to fur-
row their brow to activate the corrugator and cause
medial and inferior movement of the brow. Once
the muscle has been located, the muscle should be
palpated and pinched by holding it between the
thumb and index finger. Five Units of onabotuli-
numtoxinA is injected at an approximate 908 angle,
with the bevel of the needle pointing upward into
the medial belly of the muscle. As the needle is
inserted, there is skin resistance, which lessens
when the muscle is penetrated. This decrease in
resistance is termed a “muscle pop” and is the
method used to determine the site of injection.
Once the muscle pop occurs, inject into the superfi-
cial muscle; the needle is then in the deep portion
of the medial corrugator, which is anatomically just
over the supratrochlear foramen. However, the
actual location of this muscle for injection should
be based on the patient’s individual anatomy. To
avoid post-injection headache, the injection should
be administered while remaining just above the
periosteum. If the injection is too far superior or
above the corrugator muscle, brow ptosis can occur
due to depression of the medial brow as the fronta-
lis elevating function is lost and the corrugator
depressing function remains unopposed. Weakening
the corrugator muscle can cause mild elevation of
the medial eyebrow.
Procerus.—The
procerus
is
a
small
inverted
pyramidal-shaped muscle that lies close to and
often intermingles with the medial side of the ante-
rior belly of the frontalis muscle as well as the cor-
rugator.17
The
muscle
runs
from
the
fascia
aponeurosis covering the nasal bones and lateral
nasal cartilages and inserts into the skin at the infe-
rior forehead between the eyebrows.16 The proce-
rus
is
innervated
by
the
temporal
and
lower
zygomatic branches of the facial nerve; the supra-
trochlear nerve passes through this muscle and
medial corrugator.17 This muscle mainly receives its
vascular
supply
by
the
branches
of
the
facial
artery.17 The medial portion of the eyebrow and
the skin of the lower forehead are drawn down by
the procerus muscle, producing transverse ridges or
dynamic lines or wrinkling over the bridge of the
nose and is also co-activated by the corrugator
muscle.16,17
The PREEMPT injection paradigm indicates 1
injection of 5 Units of onabotulinumtoxinA to be
administered to 1 site in the procerus muscle (Fig.
3a).11 The procerus injection will be based approxi-
mately midway between the 2 corrugator injections.
To confirm the location of the procerus muscle, the
patient is asked to furrow their brow, which will
activate the belly of the muscle causing the medial
furrowing to occur. Once identified, 5 Units of ona-
botulinumtoxinA should be injected superficially
into the belly of the muscle at a 908 angle to ensure
the injection is administered into the procerus rath-
er than a nearby muscle. Injections placed too
superiorly may inadvertently lead to penetration of
the frontalis muscle. If injected too deep, hitting
the periosteum, post-injection headache can be
triggered.
Frontalis.—The frontalis muscle is adherent to
the superficial fascia of the lower forehead, in par-
ticular the eyebrows, with no bony attachments.17
The muscle fibers blend with those of adjacent
muscles (ie, procerus) and ascend to join the epi-
cranial fronto-occipital aponeurosis. Innervation of
the frontalis occurs via the temporal branches of
Headache
771
 the facial nerve.17 Anatomically, there is usually
found a bifurcation between the right and left sides
of the frontalis muscle, leaving a fascial v-shaped
area over the central portion of the forehead that
varies from patient to patient. The supratrochlear
and supraorbital nerves pass through this muscle at
the nerve exit points through the supratrochlear
and supraorbital foramen; it then branches diffusely
in a location that is superficial to the frontalis mus-
cle, within the investing fascia, providing sensation
to the forehead.16,17 The frontalis muscle receives
its vascular supply from branches of the superficial
temporal and ophthalmic arteries.17 The action of
the frontalis muscle involves elevation of the eye-
brows to produce expressions such as surprise, and
can cause deep transverse wrinkles on the fore-
head.16,17 The antagonists for brow depression are
the
corrugators,
procerus,
and
orbicularis
oculi
muscles.17
One injection of 5 Units of onabotulinumtox-
inA into 4 sites (total 20 Units) is specified in the
PREEMPT injection paradigm for the frontalis
muscle (Fig. 3a).11 The injection points can be iden-
tified by first visually drawing a line up from the
medial edge of the supraorbital rim. Patients will
be injected into the muscle in the upper third of
the forehead at least one to two fingerbreadths
above the corrugator injection site. The lateral mus-
cle injection areas are parallel and approximately 1
fingerbreadth lateral to the medial injection site,
which is roughly in line with either the mid-
pupillary line or the lateral edge of the cornea,
which is the limbus line. However, individual anato-
my must be considered to avoid lower than desired
injections since all forehead shapes and sizes differ.
Since the frontalis is an elevator muscle, weak-
ening can cause brow ptosis or exacerbate preexist-
ing
brow
ptosis. To
reduce
the
risk
of
these
unwanted effects, injections should be administered
in the upper third of the forehead only and not too
far laterally. In addition, the needle should be
inserted at a 458 angle superiorly and in the superfi-
cial aspect to avoid reaching the periosteum, which
may trigger post-injection headache/migraine, since
the frontalis muscle is thin. Injectors should always
keep in mind that the injection point within the
subcutaneous plane differs from the actual medica-
tion delivery point.
In the scenario that lateral brow elevation does
occur, it is usually compensatory due to weakness
of the medial frontalis muscle and is typically indic-
ative of suboptimal positioning of frontalis and/or
corrugator injections. Lateral brow elevation may
be avoided by injecting the frontalis optimally into
the upper third of the forehead as described above,
and ensuring that the corrugator injection site is
correctly positioned. If there is preexisting frontalis
compensation as a result of lid ptosis or pseudo-
ptosis, conditions that should be sought during the
pre-injection examination, particular care is needed
in identifying the injection site for the frontalis
injections
to
avoid
compensatory
lateral
brow
elevation.
Temporalis.—The temporalis muscle is a large,
flat, triangular muscle that attaches proximally to
the floor of the temporal fossa and deep surface of
the temporal fascia.17 There is a narrow, distal
attachment to the tip and medial surface of the
coronoid process and anterior border of the ramus
of the mandible.17 The temporalis is innervated by
the motor division of the trigeminal nerve; the
auriculotemporal and zygomatico-temporal cutane-
ous nerve branches of the trigeminal nerve pass
through this muscle.16,17 The superficial temporal
arteries, which
arise from the external carotid
artery, provide the vascular supply.17 After protru-
sion, the posterior, horizontal fibers of the tempora-
lis retract the mandible, while the anterior, vertical
fibers elevate the mandible and close the mouth
and are involved in clenching the teeth.16,17
Based on the PREEMPT injection paradigm, 1
injection of 5 Units are to be administered to each
of 4 sites on either side for a total of 40 Units
divided across 8 sites (Fig. 3b).11 The first injection
site is identified by first locating the tragus of the
ear and imagining a vertical line extending up the
side of the head; the first injection is on this vertical
line (Tragus line) and at least 2 fingerbreadths
above the tragus. The second site can be located by
moving approximately 1-2 fingerbreadths up from
the first injection site, while still keeping in line
with the tragus. The third site is approximately 1
772
May 2017
 fingerbreadth anterior and in between the first 2
injections, still within the hairline. The fourth site is
approximately 1 fingerbreadth back from the sec-
ond injection site and in line with the mid-portion
(helix) of the ear. A finger can be placed on the
middle of the helix of the ear to guide the injection.
To confirm the locations, the patient may be asked
to clench their teeth while palpating to identify
muscle impulse of the temporalis contraction. All
injections are administered at a 458 angle.
This set of injections is prone to bleeding due
to the many blood vessels (veins) that ascend ante-
rior to the tragus and end in the scalp in this
region. The superficial temporal artery runs anteri-
or to the tragus but is not as easily penetrated with
the needle due to the thick perivascular sheath that
covers it, providing resistance. To minimize bleed-
ing, draw back on the needle to assess for a blood
flush and inspect the patient to ensure any bleeding
is managed post-injection. Due to the risk of bleed-
ing events, safety should be discussed with patients
taking Coumadin or other anticoagulants. Patients
may report hearing a crinkling/crackling sound dur-
ing the injection as a result of the needle penetrat-
ing the fibrous fascia that covers this muscle. In
addition, it is important to be aware that repeated
injections may lead to temporalis muscle atrophy
with the development of an hour-glass appearance
of the head.18 If this occurs, the injections are per-
formed sufficiently behind the hairline.
Occipitalis.—Arising by tendinous fibers from the
lateral two-thirds of the highest nuchal line of the
occipital bone and adjacent region of the mastoid
part of the temporal bone is the occipitalis mus-
cle.17 The occipitalis muscle extends upwards and
laterally to join the aponeurotic fascia and is inner-
vated by the posterior auricular branch of the facial
nerve.17 The greater occipital nerve lies medial to
this muscle, and the lesser occipital nerve lies on its
lateral aspect.17 The occipitalis is a small muscle
that receives its vascular supply from branches of
the
posterior
auricular
and
occipital
arteries.17
Working together with the frontalis muscle, the
occipitalis acts to pull the scalp backwards.16,17 The
frontalis and occipitalis muscles should be consid-
ered a functional muscle complex linked by fascia.
The occipitalis is part of the fronto-occipital apo-
neurotic fascial system and is activated when frown-
ing or elevating the eyebrows.16,17
The occipitalis muscle region receives 5 Units
of onabotulinumtoxinA to 3 sites on each side of
the head for a total of 30 Units divided across 6
sites, as stated by the PREEMPT injection para-
digm (Fig. 3c).11 To identify the first site, the occip-
ital protuberance is palpated and the most posterior
point in the midline (ie, inion) is located. The
nuchal ridge is then palpated and the tip of the
mastoid process behind the ear is located. With the
location of these two points, the thumb should be
placed on the midpoint of the occipital protuber-
ance (ie, inion) and index finger on the tip of the
mastoid process. The space between the thumb and
the index finger should then be divided in half. The
injection should be administered just above the
nuchal ridge at this midpoint. The second injection
site is located approximately a diagonal finger-
breadth up and out toward the helix of the ear for
injection at the 10 o’clock position on the left (2
o’clock on the right). The third site can be located
by
measuring
approximately
a
diagonal
finger-
breadth up and medial for injection at the 2 o’clock
position on the left (10 o’clock on the right). The
injections should be administered at a 458 angle to
the superficial aspect of the muscle (ie, just below
the dermis). The needle should be angled upward
away from the neck and the injection should be
administered above the nuchal ridge.
Patients
may
experience
neck
pain
and/or
weakness if injections are administered too low (ie,
below the nuchal ridge); the injector must ensure
that these injections do not involve the suboccipital
region. Since the injection sites are in close proxim-
ity
to
the
greater
and
lesser
occipital
nerves,
patients should be made aware that the injections
may cause some pain.
Cervical Paraspinal Muscle Group.—The cervical
paraspinal muscle group is made up of multiple
muscles including the trapezius, splenius capitis and
cervicis, and semispinalis capitis. The splenius capi-
tis ascends from the inferior half of the nuchal liga-
ment and spinous processes of the superior six
thoracic
vertebrae.17
The
inferior,
anterior
Headache
773
 attachment of the splenius capitis occurs at the lat-
eral aspect of the mastoid process and lateral third
of the superior nuchal line.16,17 The semispinalis
arises from approximately half of the vertebral col-
umn and is divided into three parts according to
their superior attachments (ie, semispinalis capitis,
semispinalis thoracis, and semispinalis cervicis).16,17
The
semispinalis
capitis
forms
the
longitudinal
bulge in the back of the neck near the median
plane and originates from the transverse processes
of the C4-T12 vertebrae.16,17 The cervical paraspi-
nal muscle group is innervated by the posterior
rami of the spinal nerves; the third occipital nerve
traverses this group of muscles near the mid-
line.16,17 Laterally the greater and lesser occipital
nerves emerge through these muscles.16 This muscle
group receives its vascular supply from branches of
the occipital artery.16,17 This group of muscles helps
the support and stabilization of the neck in addition
to the rotation and/or extension of the head.16,17
According to the PREEMPT injection para-
digm, 5 Units of onabotulinumtoxinA is to be
administered to 2 sites on each side for a total dose
of 20 Units across 4 sites in the cervical paraspinal
muscle group near the midline (Fig. 3c).11 The first
injection site is approximately 1 cm left of the mid-
line of the cervical spine and approximately 3 cm
(2 fingerbreadths) inferior to the occipital protuber-
ance. The second site is measured approximately 1
fingerbreadth diagonally up at a 458 angle toward
the helix of the ear from the first injection. The
injections
should
be
administered
in
the
most
superficial aspect of the muscle, angling the needle
458 and superiorly. To aid in the placement of the
injections, the patient should be positioned upright
with the head in a neutral position. If the neck is
flexed too far forward, injections may be too deep.
Penetrating the fascia, which is variable, should be
sufficient to avoid an injection that is too deep.
Injections that are too low or too deep in this mus-
cle group can lead to muscle weakness and neck
pain. Injectors can consider the cervical paraspinals
as suboccipital muscles to ensure that the injection
sites are not too low. In addition, a horizontal line
can be visualized across the neck, approximately 2
fingerbreadths
down
from
the
occipital
protuberance, to make certain the injections remain
above the line and are not administered too low in
the neck. In general, injections should occur higher
and just inferior to the nuchal ridge, where there is
a thick fascial condensation and which will mini-
mize the potential for exacerbated neck weakness,
keeping in mind that these injections occur in the
hairline.
It is important to be aware that some CM
patients may have preexisting neck pain and/or
weakness; therefore, patients should be assessed at
baseline to properly set expectations of possible
adverse events.
Trapezius.—The trapezius muscle is a large, flat,
triangular, superficial muscle.17 It attaches proxi-
mally in the medial third of the superior nuchal
line, external occipital protuberance, nuchal liga-
ment, and spinous processes of the C7-T12 verte-
brae.16,17 Distal attachment of the trapezius occurs
at the lateral third of the clavicle and acromion and
spine of the scapula.16,17 The trapezius is innervated
by the spinal accessory nerve (ie, CN XI, motor
fibers) and C3 and C4 spinal nerves (ie, pain and
proprioceptive fibers); the sensory rami of C2, C3
and C4 run across this muscle.16,17 The muscle is
supplied by the transverse cervical artery.17 The
action of the muscle includes stabilization and
movement of the scapula and support for the
arm.16,17
One injection of 5 Units of onabotulinumtox-
inA to each of 3 sites on either side of the trapezi-
us, for a total of 30 Units divided across 6 sites, is
denoted in the PREEMPT injection paradigm (Fig.
3c).11 The first injection site can be identified by
visually dividing the upper portion of the trapezius
muscle in half, from the inflection point of the neck
(ie, necklace line) to the acromion (acromio-clavic-
ular joint); the midpoint of this location is where
the injection should be administered. The second
injection is located at the midpoint of the first injec-
tion site and the acromion. The third injection
should be administered at the midpoint between
the first injection site and the necklace line. Injec-
tions should occur in the supraclavicular portion of
the muscle, lateral to the neckline, and medial to
the deltoid and the acromio-clavicular joint. The
774
May 2017
 injections into the trapezius should be administered
horizontally and superficially to avoid injecting too
deep. However, in select situations where the skin
or subcutaneous tissue is thick, a deeper penetra-
tion may be required to be in the superficial tissue.
Injecting too high or too deep may lead to neck
and/or shoulder weakness, as well as neck pain due
to compensatory muscle activity. Injections that are
administered too far laterally will be in the deltoid
muscle, resulting in shoulder weakness.
Prior to treatment administration, each patient
should be assessed for possible preexisting neck
and/or shoulder weakness. In particular, patients
with small frames may be predisposed to weakness
following injection in this muscle area. These initial
observations will help to set expectations for possi-
ble adverse events.
Follow-the-Pain Injection Sites.—The PREEMPT
studies used a fixed-site, fixed-dose injection para-
digm where intramuscular injections of 155 Units of
onabotulinumtoxinA
were
administered
across
7
head and neck muscles and allowed physician discre-
tion to inject an additional 40 Units of onabotuli-
numtoxinA across 3 muscle groups (the follow-the-
pain approach).5-8 Therefore, in the PREEMPT
studies, a total of 195 Units of onabotulinumtoxinA
across 39 sites using the follow-the-pain approach
was permitted.11 The fixed-dose, fixed-site injection
paradigm of the PREEMPT clinical trial program
was used as the basis for US regulatory approval of
onabotulinumtoxinA for chronic migraine. In other
countries, a total dose of onabotulinumtoxinA of up
to 195 Units is approved allowing for additional
injections into the temporalis, occipitalis, and/or tra-
pezius muscles using the follow-the-pain method.13,14
Any additional injections administered under
the follow-the-pain strategy should follow the gen-
eral guidance outlined in this paper. If additional
onabotulinumtoxinA is required into the temporalis
muscle, it is suggested that the additional drug is
administered into up to 2 additional sites into the
temporalis muscle on each side, as required, but
not into the standard injection sites. Similarly,
should it be determined that additional injections
into the occipitalis muscle are beneficial, the addi-
tional onabotulinumtoxinA may be administered as
2 injections into either the right or left side or 1
injection into the occipitalis muscle on each side,
depending on the area identified as having maximal
tenderness. In our experience, neck weakness and
neck pain are associated with high doses of onabo-
tulinumtoxinA into the trapezius muscle. Therefore,
additional
injections
into
the
trapezius
muscle
should generally be avoided where possible, even
under a follow-the-pain strategy.
DISCUSSION
The PREEMPT injection paradigm has been pub-
lished and is available.11 This manuscript emphasizes
the
importance
of
understanding
the
anatomy
behind each injection site to optimize efficacy and
minimize unwanted outcomes and adverse events.
Based on the PREEMPT clinical trial program data,
the most commonly reported injection-related AEs
were neck pain, muscular weakness, ptosis and head-
ache.5-8,11,15 These may be minimized not only by
identifying the correct injection sites and implement-
ing the advised injection techniques but also by thor-
oughly assessing the patient before treatment.
Prior to the first injection of onabotulinumtox-
inA, it is critical to first assess the patient’s head
and neck anatomy, since variation in anatomy will
lead to variations in target muscle locations. The
standard PREEMPT fingerbreadth measurements
should be used as a general guidance only, while
actual injection sites should be located based on
the patient’s unique anatomy. Considerable vari-
ability exists between patients with regard to mus-
cle mass, brow width and height, and preexisting
weakness. These factors will impact the location of
the injection sites. Therefore, it is essential to be
familiar with anatomical landmarks to aid in identi-
fying the location of the PREEMPT injection sites.
Determination of a patient’s preexisting condi-
tions at baseline is also essential prior to treatment
administration, as it will help to set appropriate
expectations. In particular, each patient should be
examined for preexisting eyelid or eyebrow ptosis,
pseudoptosis of the eyelids, neck pain, and neck
weakness. Patients with CM may have preexisting
eyelid ptosis with frontalis compensatory activity
(ie,
a
Babinski-2
or
Reverse
Babinski
sign

 associated with hemifacial spasm).19-21 This involves
an up-going eyebrow due to compensation of the
frontalis muscle for eyelid closure. The presence of
any soft tissue under the orbital ridge and resting
on the eyelid may contribute to pseudoptosis. Pseu-
doptosis requires frontalis compensatory activity to
raise the redundant tissue off the eyelid by elevat-
ing the brow. If the brow is weakened by placing
onabotulinumtoxinA injections into the mid-section
of the frontalis, only the lateral frontalis remains to
provide this compensatory activity, resulting in lat-
eral eyebrow elevation. Injections that weaken the
lateral frontalis may worsen the pseudoptosis. In
addition, the patient’s neck stability, posture, tor-
sion, symmetry, or other possible abnormalities
should be assessed to determine whether they may
be at increased risk for adverse events.
The physician can often predict the side effects
that may be more likely to appear based on exami-
nation of the patient prior to injection. For exam-
ple,
a
patient
with
ptosis
or
pseudoptosis
at
baseline
may
experience
exacerbation
of
these
unwanted outcomes upon injection of the frontalis
muscles. In these cases, particular care in placement
of the injection into the lateral frontalis and corru-
gator muscles is required.
On the other hand, a patient with preexisting
neck pain and/or weakness may be at higher risk for
exacerbation of their condition upon injection of the
areas associated with the occipitalis, cervical paraspi-
nal, or trapezius muscle groups. Further, patients
with smaller frames may be at higher risk for neck
weakness.
Indicated
injection
sites
can
still
be
injected with minimal side effects and unwanted out-
comes as long as correct injection sites are targeted
and treatments are administered using the advised
techniques. Treatment expectations, including risk of
unwanted and/or adverse events, should be discussed
with the patient prior to treatment. This will help to
avoid omission of injection sites based on concerns.
CONCLUSIONS
OnabotulinumtoxinA is a safe and effective
prophylactic treatment option for patients with CM.
Accurate target muscle localization and injection
angles and depths are required to achieve optimal
outcomes and to minimize adverse events. Firm
knowledge of the functional anatomy of the head
and neck muscles is critical for identification of the
standardized PREEMPT injection site locations.
This, combined with a thorough assessment of a
patient’s baseline condition, should help to achieve
the outcomes observed in clinical trials.
