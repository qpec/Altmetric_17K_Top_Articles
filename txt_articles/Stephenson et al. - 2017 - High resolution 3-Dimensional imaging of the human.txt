Cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disturbances are accompanied by structural remodelling of the 
specialised cardiomyocytes known collectively as the cardiac conduction system. Here, using contrast 
enhanced micro-computed tomography, we present, in attitudinally appropriate fashion, the first 
3-dimensional representations of the cardiac conduction system within the intact human heart. We 
show that cardiomyocyte orientation can be extracted from these datasets at spatial resolutions 
approaching the single cell. These data show that commonly accepted anatomical representations 
are oversimplified. We have incorporated the high-resolution anatomical data into mathematical 
simulations of cardiac electrical depolarisation. The data presented should have multidisciplinary 
impact. Since the rate of depolarisation is dictated by cardiac microstructure, and the precise 
orientation of the cardiomyocytes, our data should improve the fidelity of mathematical models. 
By showing the precise 3-dimensional relationships between the cardiac conduction system and 
surrounding structures, we provide new insights relevant to valvar replacement surgery and ablation 
therapies. We also offer a practical method for investigation of remodelling in disease, and thus, 
virtual pathology and archiving. Such data presented as 3D images or 3D printed models, will inform 
discussions between medical teams and their patients, and aid the education of medical and surgical 
trainees.
The specialised cardiomyocytes, known as the cardiac conduction system, are anatomically discrete from the 
working myocardium, and cannot be visualised using traditional non-invasive techniques. They have the ability 
spontaneously to generate electrical impulses and to function as pacemakers1, 2. They act also to conduct impulses 
throughout the heart, in a rapid and coordinated fashion1. The main components of the cardiac conduction 
system are the sinus node of the right atrium, which is the primary pacemaker; the atrioventricular conduction 
axis, which normally forms the only pathway allowing excitation to pass between the atria and ventricles; and the 
Purkinje network, which allows fast and coordinated conduction within the ventricles3, 4.

Cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disturbances affect 0.1% of adults younger than 55 years old, increasing 
to 9% in those older than 80 years5–8. They also occur in almost 40% of patients attending cardiology outpa-
tient clinics7. The onset of such conditions may be attributed to age, genetic predisposition, lifestyle, myocardial 
remodelling, fibrosis of tissues, and history of surgical procedures. We have shown previously the 3D distri-
bution of the cardiac conduction system in animal hearts9–12, along with the link between its molecular and 
micro-anatomical remodelling in disease13. Knowledge of the 3D micro-anatomy of the human cardiac conduc-
tion system, therefore, is crucial. Up to now, this information has been absent from the literature.
Biophysically-detailed mathematical models are powerful tools with which to investigate normal and patho-
logical cardiac conduction. Efforts have been made to produce detailed electrophysiological data to inform such 
models14–17. The fidelity of the current models, however, is compromised by the use of simplified geometric data 
sets from disparate species16, 18–20. In order to produce simulations with the highest possible structural fidelity, 
models must include; (1) accurate morphological representations of the human cardiac conduction system and 
its interface with the working myocardium, and (2) the 3D orientation of the cardiomyocytes within these tissues. 
Individual cardiomyocytes are of the order of a few tens of microns in dimension, and the path and velocity of 
conduction is known to be dictated by their orientation21. Depiction of 3D cellular alignment, therefore, should 
ideally be generated from image data as close as possible to this order of spatial resolution.
Our present understanding of sinus node and atrioventricular node morphology owes much to painstaking 
reconstruction of 2D serial histology22–27. Any such technique is limited in 3D resolution by the distance between 
successive sections, typically 60–340 µm23, 25. Such destructive analysis is further limited by the requirement to 
use preparations of an isolated part of a given heart, small enough for routine fixation and sectioning. This makes 
the placement of the analysed volumes back into the context of the whole heart difficult, and prone to error. As 
a result, the conduction system is rarely presented in the attitudinally correct position28. Despite these caveats, 
we have shown previously that histology and immunohistochemistry remain crucial techniques to validate 3D 
imaging2, 12, 13.
Current histological depictions of the orientation of cardiomyocytes commonly suffer from poor z-plane res-
olution and inaccurate registrations. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging has become the gold standard 
for investigation of the relative orientation of cardiomyocytes29–32. However, because of its somewhat gross spatial 
resolution, namely ~600–3,000 um3, it produces a representation of mean cellular orientation. Such a technique 
cannot, therefore, show the complex 3D arrangement of the individual chains of cardiomyocytes.
The scientific literature and medical textbooks provide, therefore, mixed, and often inaccurate, descriptions 
of both the cardiac conduction system and the arrangement of cardiomyocytes. For instance, the structure and 
function of the paranodal region is still contested14, 22, 33–35, there is a common misconception that the Purkinje 
network runs exclusively subendocardially, and many believe the chains of cardiomyocytes can be unravelled as 
a continuous and ordered helical myocardial band2, 36. In order to provide definitive answers to these existing 
controversies, there is the need to present the micro-structure of the whole heart in 3-dimensions at cellular 
resolution. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) can now provide such a dataset from an intact heart using 
scan times below 1 hour12, 37.
Here, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first 3D representation of the cardiac conduction system 
within an ex-vivo intact human heart, and place them in the attitudinally correct position. Data was obtained 
by means of the non-invasive, non-destructive imaging technique known as contrast enhanced micro-CT. We 
have resolved the relative extent of the sinus node, its projections, and the associated paranodal area. We have 
shown that cellular orientation can be extracted from a high-resolution whole heart data set, demonstrating the 
myocardium to be a complex mesh-work of cardiomyocyte chains. This technique will facilitate an improved 
understanding of the altered morphology of the cardiac conduction system in congenital malformations, heart 
disease, and ageing. This new level of geometric detail will also improve the fidelity of mathematical models, pro-
viding new insights into the links between morphological remodelling and the manifestation of arrhythmias and 
conduction disturbances in humans.
Results
We present accurate 3D representations of the location of the cardiac conduction system in the intact human 
heart using the non-destructive imaging technique of contrast enhanced micro-CT. Contrast enhancement per-
mits us to distinguish the relevant tissue types based on their differential attenuation of the x-ray beam. As a result 
of iodine infusion; fat, working myocardium, specialised nodal tissue, paranodal tissue, and connective tissue 
exhibit decreasing levels of attenuation respectively, and thus decreasing voxel values in the tomographic data. We 
have discussed previously the possible mechanism behind the observed differential uptake of iodine by biological 
tissues12, 38. The spatial resolution obtained was also sufficient to demonstrate cardiomyocyte orientation, thus 
permitting us to produce an anatomically and biophysically detailed mathematical model of cardiac electrical 
activation.
The sinus node and its paranodal area. 
The serial short-axis 2D tomograms, along with their 3D vol-
ume renderings, show the primary pacemaker of the heart, the sinus node, to have a complex 3D shape with 
many radiating projections (Figs 1 and 2, Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). The node narrows at the superior 
cavoatrial junction, and tapers caudally as it extends towards the inferior caval vein (Fig. 1 and Supplementary 
Fig. S1). In some places the node is enclosed by the surrounding myocardium and epicardial fat. In other regions 
it extends close to the epicardial and endocardial surfaces (Figs 1 and 2, Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). Using 
automatic segmentation (see data supplement), we were able to reconstruct the node in fine detail (Fig. 2). The 
main body of the node (Fig. 2 length = 14.8mm, width = 4.3mm) was housed within the intercaval region, but 
islands and projections of nodal tissue were also observed within the terminal crest (also referred to as the crista 
terminalis), extending towards the epicardial terminal groove, the pectinate muscles, and towards the interatrial

septum (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). These regions, previously described as paranodal, could also 
be differentiated from the working myocardium in the micro-CT data, appearing as lower attenuating regions. 
Their voxel values, however, were higher than those found in the main body of the sinus node. In Fig. 2e and f we 
show a 3D segmentation of the sinus node produced by automatic segmentation. The blue colour indicates voxels 
selected using automatic segmentation, with the sinus node body as the seed point. Turquoise indicates automatic 
segmentation of adjacent projections and islands, which have pixel values higher than those of the sinus node, 
but lower than the working myocardium. Serial tomograms representing the data shown in Fig. 2 are presented 
in supplementary Fig. S2, along with an epicardial volume rendering showing the interaction of these projections 
with the terminal crest and adjoining pectinate muscles (Supplementary Fig. S1).
The atrioventricular conduction axis. 
Analysis showed the atrioventricular conduction axis, comprising 
the compact node, penetrating bundle, branching bundle, and the ventricular bundle branches, to have pixel 
values between those of the high-attenuating working myocardium and those of the low-attenuating connective 
tissue (Fig. 3 and supplementary Fig. S3). It also proved possible to differentiate the inferior nodal extension of the 
compact node, and to show the continuation of the axis distally as the dead-end tract (Fig. 3 and supplementary 
Fig. S3). We validated the micro-CT images by performing Masson’s trichrome staining on a block of conduc-
tion axis tissue (Fig. 3a,b). In Fig. 3e, we show a short axis volume rendering viewed in the attitudinally correct 
position, after virtual removal of the atrial myocardium. In Figs 4d and 5d we show 3D representations as viewed 
from the right and left lateral aspects. For the majority of their course, the penetrating and branching aspects of 
the axis could be objectively segmented using automatic techniques. At the inferior nodal extension, where the 
specialised tissue becomes a fine streak of cells surrounded by transitional tissue, semi-automatic segmentation 
was used. In these regions, existing histo-anatomical descriptions of the inferior nodal extension, and landmarks 
such as the nodal artery were necessary to guide segmentation. We have not shown the membranous septum in 
any of the volume renderings. This structure has very low attenuating properties, and is therefore removed from 
view by the windowing process. In supplementary Fig. S3, we show serial micro-CT sections without outlines.
The bundle branches and Purkinje network. 
The conduction axis, via the right and left bundle 
branches, continues as the Purkinje fibres of the right and left ventricles. We identified the bundle branches as fine 
low attenuating ribbon-like structures running down the endocardial surface of the ventricular septum (Figs 4 
and 5). The right bundle branch was predominantly traced in the long-axis micro-CT sections (Fig. 4a,b), while 
the left bundle branch was predominantly traced in short-axis micro-CT sections (Fig. 5a,b).

Proximally, the right bundle branch was seen to project anteriorly onto the interventricular septum as a super-
ficial narrow ribbon (Fig. 4a,d), which then descended the septum running on the superficial and deep surfaces 
of a major free-running trabeculation (Fig. 4b,d). Following the longitudinal axis of the trabeculation, distally the 
bundle became continuous with the Purkinje network, giving branches to the papillary muscles and supplying 
the apical region (Figs 4, 6 and 7). The right bundle branch could not be traced continuously for its entire length. 
This is probably due to insufficient spatial resolution.
The left bundle branch was identified proximally as a broad sheet-like structure draped over and down the 
left basal surface of the muscular ventricular septum. When traced distally, the left bundle branch took on a 
tri-fasicular appearance, permitting identification of the anterior, septal and posterior fascicles (Fig. 5). These 
wide ribbon-like structures running on the endocardial surface, then gave rise distally to the Purkinje fibres, 
which extend to supply the papillary muscles and the apical region (Figs 5, 6 and 7a,b). A macro photograph of 
the region in the same heart is shown in Fig. 5c. The specialised conducting tissue cannot be recognised as distinct 
from the surrounding trabecular structures in such a photograph, but when using the segmented micro-CT data 
as a guide, the positions of the conducting fascicles and corresponding Purkinje fibres can be indicated. Voxels 
belonging to the bundle branches and Purkinje networks were selected using semi-automatic segmentation. The 
Purkinje fibres in this region of the human heart run on the endocardial surface and have many free-running 
elements (Figs 6 and 7a,b).
The position of the atrioventricular conduction axis in the intact human heart. 
Figure 6 shows 
the 3-dimensional spatial relationship of the conduction axis with the aortic valve. The same data is presented as 
a rotating 3D video in Supplementary Video S1. In Fig. 6a and b the segmented cardiac conduction system has 
been integrated with the working myocardium. The renderings have then been sliced longitudinally to expose the 
internal features of the right and left chambers. The complete segmented datasets without the myocardium are 
presented in Fig. 6c and d. In this heart, the non-branching bundle extends to within 6.2 mm of the non-coronary 
leaflet of the aortic valve, while the branching bundle is 6.5 mm away from the nadir of the right coronary leaf-
let. The dead-end tract approaches to within 15.1 mm of the hinge of the left coronary aortic valvar leaflet. The 
Purkinje networks run on the endocardial surface with free-running elements within the ventricular lumen. 
The size and shape of the networks are influenced by the shape and dimensions of the corresponding ventricular 
cavities. The right ventricular network appears relatively sparse, and the elements span large distances. The left 
ventricular network is denser, has shorter free-running elements, and takes on a cone-like appearance. We recog-
nise, nonetheless, that this is not a complete representation of the Purkinje networks.

Computer modelling of electrical depolarisation in the human heart. 
To confirm the suitabil-
ity of high resolution micro-CT data for the generation of mathematical models of electrical depolarisation; 
all major elements of the human cardiac conduction system, along with the surrounding working myocardium 
from the same heart, were converted into a finite element mesh (Fig. 7a,b). This mesh was then incorporated into 
an electro-physiologically accurate mathematical computer model of electrical activation (Fig. 7d). The model 
showed physiological activation of the atria, with the electrical stimulus originating from the sinus node and 
propagating towards the left atrium and atrioventricular node respectively (supplementary Fig. S4). Preliminary 
studies of the ventricular activation pattern have highlighted the influence of the extensive and complex Purkinje 
networks showcased in the anatomical dataset. Further work is now required to incorporate the additional mor-
phological detail of the Purkinje fibre network available in this dataset into an accurate cellular model of the 
Purkinje system.
The micro-CT dataset, nonetheless, contains additional important information that will improve the pre-
diction of the wave of cardiac depolarisation by computer models. Using Eigen-analysis of the 3D structure 
tensor (see methods), cardiomyocyte orientation was extracted in the whole human heart (Heart 1) (Figs 7C 
and 8). The results presented in Fig. 7c show a helical angle colour map in the 4 chamber view: the map is 
formed from a z-stack of 15 individual tomograms. In the atrial walls, myocytes are aligned along the longitu-
dinal axis of major muscle bundles. A more heterogeneous pattern of myocyte orientation appears within the 
atrial septum. In the ventricular walls, the myocytes appear as a complex meshwork of myocyte chains (Fig. 8). 
A clear transmural helical pattern, with a central circumferential zone, was observed across the septum, while 
a weaker helical pattern, although still prominent, was seen across the left ventricular free wall (Figs 7c and 8). 
The papillary muscles within the right and left and ventricular cavities, in contrast, contain myocytes running 
parallel with their long axes. To our knowledge this is the first time the orientation of cardiomyocytes has been 
extracted from the whole intact human heart at spatial resolution approaching that of the single cell. Virtual 
models of human cardiac depolarisation will need to take this new quality of information into account in 
future development.

slightly rostrally to become the branching bundle (e). The plane of section in c and d is shown on the 3D

Discussion
In this study, we show that contrast enhanced micro-CT provides a non-destructive method with which to pro-
duce high-resolution maps of the 3D disposition of the cardiac conduction system in the human heart. Such a 
technique for imaging the 3D morphology of the human heart will have several important benefits. It has the 
potential to improve our understanding of the morphological variation between healthy, ageing, diseased, and 
congenitally malformed hearts. It will facilitate the creation of anatomically and biophysically-detailed mathe-
matical models of the heart. These models will permit creation of 4D simulations of conduction in normal and 
abnormal electrocardiograms, and allow exploration of micro-structural substrates for arrhythmias, and identi-
fication of ablation targets. Such models can also be implemented in drug discovery. The models can be manip-
ulated at the algorithm level to mimic the effects of drugs: for example, the effects of specific pharmaceuticals on 
ion channel activity.
Over and above this, the knowledge provided can help in refining techniques for implantation of prosthetic 
valves. It is relatively common for patients undergoing aortic valve replacement to develop arrhythmogenic com-
plications, requiring additional treatment such as the implantation of a pacemaker39. The precise 3D positioning 
of the valvar prosthesis is, therefore, a crucial factor. When the implant is positioned below the native valve, an 
increase in the frequency of cardiac conduction defects is observed40. This observation is not unexpected when 
the 3D model and Supplementary Video S1 is examined. If subsequently proven to be of comparable value in 
congenitally malformed hearts, the technique could guide the planning of reconstructive surgery. This would be 
an important advance, particularly in those complex lesions such as hearts with isomeric atrial appendages, where 
uncertainty still exists regarding the location of the conduction tissues.
We recognise that, in many respects, the data we present is confirmation of previous studies22, 41, 42. It is the 
first, however, to show 3D representations of the relationships between the conducting tissues and the surround-
ing cardiac anatomy, and the first to show the three major components of the conduction system in a single intact 
human heart. This data therefore offers a step change in 3D visualisation of human cardiac anatomy.
In this regard, the findings are comparable with previous studies in the human heart22, 43, 44. As is known 
from investigation of animal hearts12, 23, the sinus node extends along a considerable portion of the intercaval 
region. Significant variation in sinus node length has been observed in the human heart. Sanchez-Quintana et

al. recorded lengths ranging from 8 mm to 21.5 mm, and showed that the sinus node was not proportional to 
heart size, nor to the length of the terminal crest. This is consistent with the present study, but contrary to many 
traditional descriptions and textbook depictions, in which the node is described as a concentrated nodule of cells. 
In this study, we were also able to trace, segment, and show the 3D extent of a region believed to correspond to 
the paranodal area. This region may act similarly to the transitional tissue observed in the region of the compact 
node, facilitating the spread of depolarisation between different tissue types22, 44.
We have revealed multiple myocyte projections that emerge from the sinus node to enter the atrial working 
myocardium (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). These projections had similar voxel values to the par-
anodal areas, and could be potential exit pathways from the sinus node. The presence of such pathways has been 
debated for many years33, 34, 44. Optical mapping in the region suggests that there are distinct sites of breakthrough 
for activation of the atrial myocardium34, 35, 45. In a histological study by Sanchez-Quintana et al. (2005) extensions 
were found to project from the head, body and tail regions of the sinus node. Consistent with those findings, we 
resolved projections running towards the endocardial region of the terminal crest, and also towards the epicardial 
surface. Our high-resolution data suggest that direct connections towards the pectinate muscles may also exist 
(Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). The paranodal area has the potential to act as a pacemaker, and many tachy-
cardias in man have been observed to originate from the region of the terminal crest14, 22. In this regard, our data 
has potential use in computer modelling studies investigating the function of the paranodal area, and the role of 
these apparent exit pathways, previously shown only in 2D histological sections44, 45.
Consistent with Tawara’s original histological description of the atrioventricular conduction axis26, our 3D 
representation confirms that the conduction axis originates at the apex of the triangle of Koch. When traced 
distally, the axis follows around the circumference of the virtual basal ring of the aortic valve, also known as the 
‘echographic annulus’46, to the region of the so-called dead-end tract47. The presented longitudinal micro-CT 
tomograms, therefore, correspond well with the seminal histological studies of Tawara26, Davies48 and Truex49. 
The 3D rendering in our study, however, is superior in that it shows the connections to the bundle branches. 
Although we can identify all its components, our technique does not differentiate the various sub-compartments 
in terms of function. Functional distinction requires appropriate staining and immunolabelling of marker 
proteins42.
Our current findings are also in keeping with previous studies of the bovine heart made using immunohis-
tochemistry50 and India ink injection4. Virtual re-slicing in multiple directions to aid the accurate segmentation

of the bundle branches and Purkinje network, as used in the present study, is easily achieved in our 3D isomet-
ric micro-CT data. Such re-slicing is not possible by standard sectional histology. The shortcomings of tradi-
tional techniques explain the disparity between previous anatomical descriptions of the region as described by 
Demoulin et al.51.
The 2D and destructive nature of traditional techniques (histology and dissection) leads to an underestima-
tion of the free-running elements of the Purkinje network. Although the free-running elements are resolved 
using micro-CT12, the depiction presented in the current study is not complete. Based on previous depictions in 
rabbit10, made at even higher resolution, we suggest that although all ‘connecting branches’ are resolved, this is 
not the case for the ‘terminal branches’
. Distally, Purkinje fibres lose their fibrous sheaths4, and this finding could 
explain the reduced differential attenuation observed in some areas of the network. Contrary to many text-book 
depictions, but consistent with previous immunohistochemical studies50, we found no evidence of intramural 
Purkinje fibres in the human heart.
Although experimental data exist on the remodelling of the conduction system in disease at a cellular and 
protein level52, little is known on how the 3D morphology is affected. This is well illustrated by current mathe-
matical models of electrical depolarisation. Multi-cell models incorporate highly detailed functional information, 
but model fidelity is confounded by simplified morphological data with gross resolutions16, 18–20. Such models 
often integrate morphological data derived from histology18, and in some cases from disparate species19, 20. This 
highlights the importance of the whole heart high-resolution data presented in the current study. Our initial

correct position for the human, that is, in the upright posture. This 3D dataset is available in the supplementary

modelling studies show that the large file size, and fine structural complexities, however, makes the incorpora-
tion of high-resolution micro-CT data, both computationally and theoretically challenging. This highlights a 
new research challenge for the modelling community. While providing new challenges, such high resolution 3D 
data provides a stepwise improvement in the structural geometries available to groups working on mathematical 
models of cardiac depolarisation.
It has long been accepted that conduction velocity is faster along the longitudinal axis of a cardiomyocyte 
chain than across its short axis21. The path and velocity of the electrical impulse is therefore strongly influenced 
by cellular orientation. The ability to extract 3D cardiomyocyte orientation at spatial resolutions approaching 
the single cell, therefore, promises to improve further the fidelity of cardiac modelling. Cellular orientation in 
specific regions has been described previously22, 23, 53, 54. Given its finer resolution, however, micro-CT data is 
inevitably more complex than the equivalent data from diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. Our data 
shows the ventricular myocardium to constitute a complex meshwork of cardiomyocyte chains (Fig. 8). The pre-
sented method provides a technique to resolve the controversies regarding the arrangement of the cardiomyo-
cytes within the ventricular cone2, 36.
Micro-CT has already shown its potential use in virtual archiving of explanted cardiac tissue, in particu-
lar congenital malformations55. The present study offers a technique to provide the first high resolution 3D 
anatomical descriptions of the conduction system in such malformations. When the data is presented as 3D

images or 3D printed models, it will inform discussions between medical teams and their patients, and aid the 
education of medical and surgical trainees. The benefit of access to anatomically accurate printed models is 
already the subject of a clinical trial in the planning of paediatric cardiac surgery (http://www.chop.edu/news/
childrens-hospital-takes-part-3dheart-clinical-study)56. This technique promises to have considerable impact on 
the understanding, and strategies, associated with ablation and reconstructive surgery in diseased and congeni-
tally malformed hearts. It should reduce the incidence of conduction abnormalities post-intervention, and, thus, 
reduce patient morbidity and the need for expensive pacemaker implantation.
Methods
Human sample details and ethical approval. 
Human hearts were obtained post mortem from 4 individ-
uals. The first two hearts were obtained and prepared at the University of Minnesota, USA. They were recovered 
from organ donors whose hearts were deemed unsuitable for transplantation. Each heart was stopped using cardi-
oplegia, recovered, and transported to the University of Minnesota within 12 hours via LifeSource (Minneapolis, 
MN). All appropriate consents were obtained for donation for these hearts for research (HH074 and HH059 http://
www.vhlab.umn.edu/atlas/histories/ for additional information relating to these specimens). The blocks containing 
the sinus node and the atrioventricular conduction axis were prepared by Dr. Filip Perde and supplied as frozen 
samples. Ethical approval was obtained from the National Institute of Legal Medicine, Bucharest, Romania. All 
subsequent handling and analysis was carried out in accordance with the UK Human Tissue Act (2004).
Whole heart tissue preparation. 
The first two hearts, considered to be anatomically normal, were initially 
flushed with saline solution to remove any residing clotted blood. Next, they were perfusion-fixed with 10% 
formalin for at least 48 hours to maintain an end-diastolic state, as previously described12, 57, and transported to 
the University of Manchester: a Materials Transfer Agreement was executed and shipping methods followed the 
guidelines of the Environmental Health & Safety Department of the University of Manchester. The first heart was 
stained with 7.5% I2KI for 14 days, prior to micro-CT scanning12, 57. The contrast agent was replaced at day 7. To 
maintain the chambers in an inflated state for scanning, the heart chambers were filled with warm agarose solu-
tion, which becomes a stable gel at the room temperature used during scanning. The second heart was scanned 
without iodine contrast enhancement and then processed for histological serial sectioning.

Preparation of blocks containing the Sinus node and atrioventricular conduction axis. 
The 
frozen tissue blocks containing the samples were thawed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (pH 7.4; 
Sigma Aldrich) at room temperature for two weeks. The sinus node sample was then submerged in 7.5% aqueous 
iodine-potassium iodide (I2KI) contrast medium for 1 week, prior to micro-CT scanning (see below). In prepa-
ration for histology, iodine was leached from the tissue and parts of both samples were snap frozen in isopentane 
cooled in liquid nitrogen. The samples were then stored at −
80 °C. Samples were sectioned at a thickness of 25 
to 50 µm, sections of interest were stained with Masson’s trichrome. Full descriptions can be found in the data 
supplement.
Micro-Computed Tomography. 
Micro-CT scanning was carried out using the Nikon Metris XTEK 320 kV 
Custom Bay and Nikon XTEK XTH 225 kV systems at the Manchester X-Ray Imaging Facility, University of 
Manchester, as previously described by Stephenson et al., (2012). The samples were cleared of fixative and excess 
contrast medium by washing in distilled water, and then immobilized in a plastic holder to prevent movement 
during the imaging process. Scans were acquired with X-ray energies ranging from 85–160 kV. 360° scans were 
performed and data was collected from between 2000 and 3142 projections with two frame averaging. A tung-
sten target was used for all scans, with a 1 mm and 0.25 mm aluminium filter for the whole heart and sinus 
node prep respectively. Total scan times were approximately 50 minutes. Data was reconstructed using filtered 
back-projection, resulting in tomographic image data with an isotropic voxel size of 73 ×
 73 ×
 73 µm3 for the 
whole heart data and 28 ×
 28 ×
 28 µm3 for the sinus node sample.
3D anatomical reconstruction based on micro-computed Tomography. 
Data sets were initially 
viewed, cropped, and manipulated using ImageJ 1.45i (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). Regions of interest were iden-
tified using known landmarks, as used in dissection and histological studies of the cardiac conduction system. 
3D reconstructions of the regions of interest were then created in Amira 5.33 using the volume rendering and 
segmentation techniques previously described12, 13, 57. Full descriptions can be found in the data supplement.
Volume rendering and segmentation techniques can be combined. In this study we present volume renderings 
of the intact human heart and the right atrium (sinus node sample), in which segmentations of the major regions 
of the cardiac conduction system are overlaid. Although histologically validated, the 3D digital reconstructions 
represent our hypothesis of the relevant anatomical features of the cardiac conduction system.
Extraction of 3D cardiomyocyte orientation from micro-computed tomography data. 
The 
original 2D micro-CT image series was imported into MatLab Release 2011b (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, 
Massachusetts, USA 2011) for processing. The micro-CT images had excellent attenuation contrast allowing dis-
crimination between the cardiomyocyces and extracellular spaces. The structure tensor approach is a mathemat-
ical approach developed to estimate the orientations of the long axis of the myocytes by utilizing eigen-analysis, 
and has been demonstrated as a comparable approach with diffusion tensor imaging58, 59.
Mathematical modelling of electrical activation. 
The computational model was developed by using 
the segmentation dataset created from the micro-computed tomography reconstruction. The segmentation labels 
were arranged in a 3-dimensional grid and formed the basis of this virtual human heart. The ten Tusscher60 and 
Countermanche61 mathematical models for the human ventricular and atrial tissue were used to simulate the cell 
electrophysiology for the respective regions. Electrical excitation was manually initiated at the centre of the body 
of the sinus node and propagated through the tissue. A full description can be found in the data supplement.
