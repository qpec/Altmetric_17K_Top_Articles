STUDY QUESTION: Do the chemotherapeutic regimens of ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) or OEPA-
COPDAC (combined vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, doxorubicin (OEPA) and cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, dacarbazine
(COPDAC)) used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), affect the density, morphology and in vitro developmental potential of human ovarian
follicles?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Ovarian tissue from women treated with ABVD contained a higher density of non-growing follicles (NGFs) per
cubic millimetre and increased numbers of multiovular follicles but showed reduced in vitro growth compared with patients with lymphoma
who had not received chemotherapy, patients treated with OEPA-COPDAC, age-matched healthy women and age-related model-predicted
values.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Chemotherapy regimens can cause a loss of follicles within the ovary, which depends on the drugs given.
Early stage HL is commonly treated by ABVD, a non-alkylating regimen that apparently has ovarian sparing qualities; thus it is important to
investigate the histological appearance and distribution of follicles within ABVD-treated ovarian tissue.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Thirteen ovarian biopsies were obtained from HL patients (six adolescents and seven adults) and
one biopsy from a non-HL patient. Two HL patients and the non-HL patient had received no treatment prior to biopsy collection. The
remaining 11 HL patients received one of two regimens: ABVD or OEPA-COPDAC. Tissue was analysed histologically and compared to
biopsies from healthy women, and in a subgroup of patients, tissue was cultured for 6 days in vitro.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Ovarian biopsies were obtained from patients undergoing ovarian cryo-
preservation for fertility preservation and from healthy women at the time of Caesarian section (‘obstetric tissue’). Follicle number and matur-
ity were evaluated in sections of ovarian cortical tissue, and compared to an age-related model of mean follicle density and to age-matched
contemporaneous biopsies. The developmental potential of follicles was investigated after 6 days of tissue culture.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 6877 follicles were analysed. ABVD-treated tissue contained a higher dens-
ity of NGFs per cubic millimetre (230 ± 17) (mean ± SEM) than untreated (110 ± 54), OEPA-COPDAC–treated (50 ± 27) and obstetric
(20 ± 4) tissue (P < 0.01), with follicle density 9–21 SD higher than predicted by an age-related model. Biovular and binucleated NGFs occurred
frequently in ABVD-treated and in adolescent-untreated tissue but were not observed in OEPA-COPDAC–treated or obstetric tissue,
although OEPA-COPDAC–treated tissue contained a high proportion of morphologically abnormal oocytes (52% versus 23% in untreated,
22% in ABVD-treated and 25% in obstetric tissue; P < 0.001). Activation of follicle growth in vitro occurred in all groups, but in ABVD-treated

 samples there was very limited development to the secondary stage, whereas in untreated samples from lymphoma patients growth was simi-
lar to that observed in obstetric tissue (untreated; P < 0.01 versus ABVD-treated, NS versus obstetric).
LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although a large number of follicles were analysed, these data were derived from a small
number of biopsies. The mechanisms underpinning these observations have yet to be determined and it is unclear how they relate to future
fertility.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study confirms that the number of NGFs is not depleted following ABVD treatment,
consistent with clinical data that female fertility is preserved. Our findings demonstrate that immature follicle density can increase as well as
decrease following at least one chemotherapy treatment. This is the first report of morphological and follicle developmental similarities
between ABVD-treated tissue and the immature human ovary. Further experiments will investigate the basis for the marked increase in fol-
licle density in ABVD-treated tissue.

Introduction
The number of follicles in the ovary decreases progressively with age.
Treatments such as some chemotherapy agents can accelerate this
loss leading to premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) with loss of fertil-
ity and estrogen deficiency in female survivors of cancer (Morgan et al.,
2012). The likely range of mechanisms of drug-induced ovarian dam-
age has yet to be fully characterized but includes direct damage to
growing and non-growing follicles (NGFs), and loss of growing follicles
may lead to the recruitment of dormant follicles to the growing phase,
which in turn are lost, thus accelerating the depletion of the non-
growing pool, i.e. the ovarian reserve (Meirow et al., 2010; Morgan
et al., 2012; Kalich-Philosoph et al., 2013).
Since the mid-1970s the standard first-line treatment for early stage
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in many countries has been adriamycin, bleo-
mycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) (Bonadonna and Santoro,
1982; Meirow and Nugent, 2001; Meyer et al., 2012). Early stage HL
patients receiving ABVD-based treatment where involved field radio-
therapy does not include that the ovaries have a good reproductive
prognosis for both fertility and risk of POI (Hodgson et al., 2007,
Swerdlow et al., 2014). In contrast, advanced stage HL patients treated
with a drug regimen containing one or more alkylating agents and
involved field radiotherapy have a higher prevalence of POI (Behringer
et al., 2005) and should therefore be considered for fertility preserva-
tion strategies before commencing treatment (Anderson et al., 2015).
The purpose of this study was to examine microscopically, ovarian
tissue from patients with lymphoma exposed to ABVD chemotherapy
and compare this with samples exposed to the combined alkylating
chemotherapeutic regime (OEPA-COPDAC) (combined vincristine,
etoposide, prednisone, doxorubicin (OEPA) and cyclophosphamide,
vincristine, prednisone, dacarbazine (COPDAC)), with samples not
previously exposed to chemotherapy and with further samples from
healthy women to determine whether follicle density, morphology and
in vitro developmental potential were affected by these chemothera-
peutic interventions. Comparing follicle densities across treatments
requires identification of changes to NGF cortical densities in comparison
with those predicted by age-related models (Kelsey and Wallace, 2012;
Kelsey et al., 2013). In this study, we used a recently reported validated
age-related model of mean follicle density (MFD) in the ovarian cortex
(McLaughlin et al., 2015), to compare observations of MFD in tissue
obtained after different chemotherapy regimens.
Materials and Methods
Patient selection
Diagnosis, patient age, chemotherapeutic regimen, anti-Müllerian hormone
(AMH) concentrations and time between completion of treatment and
biopsy collection are detailed in Table I.
Ovarian cortical tissue
Ovarian biopsies were obtained laparoscopically from six adolescents and
seven adults diagnosed with HL and one adult diagnosed with non-HL. All
patients were undergoing removal of ovarian cortex for fertility cryopreser-
vation either prior to chemotherapy or following relapse of previously trea-
ted illness. Protocols for tissue donation for research had Ethical
Committee approval from South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee
(ref 06/S1103/26), and all patients gave informed consent in writing. The
mean patient age was 20.2 ± 1.5 years (mean ± SEM) with a range of
12.0–30.0 years. For analyses, patients were divided into 3 groups: those
treated with ABVD (aged 16–29 years, n = 8), those treated with
OEPA-COPDAC (aged 14 – 16 years, n = 3) and untreated patients or con-
trols (aged 12–30 years, n = 3). Data were compared with results obtained
from contemporaneous ovarian biopsies obtained from adult women
undergoing elective Caesarean section (age range 23–39 years, n = 12)
prepared and processed in an identical manner, also obtained with written
informed consent and ethical committee approval (ref 10/S1101/24).
Tissue preparation and processing
Fresh ovarian biopsies (ranging in size from 8 x 5 mm and 6 x 4 mm all with
variable thickness) were transported to the laboratory in holding medium
(Leibovitz medium, Gibco; Life Technologies, Paisley, Renfrewshire, UK,
supplemented with 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 3 mg/ml
human serum albumin, 75 mg/ml penicillin G and 50 mg/ml streptomycin;
all chemicals from Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK). The tissue was transferred
166

 into fresh pre-warmed (37oC) holding medium and examined under a dis-
secting light microscope. A scalpel and fine forceps were used to remove
any damaged or haemorrhagic areas as well as any tissue adhering to the
underside of the biopsies to leave only intact cortex in place. Using a scal-
pel the tissue was divided into fragments of ~4 x 2 x 0.5 mm; the number
of fragments varied between biopsies. Fragments were fixed in 10% neutral
buffered formalin (NBF) for 48 h, then processed and prepared for staining
and microscopic evaluation as previously described (McLaughlin et al.,
2014).
Thawing of cryopreserved tissue
Two of the biopsies were cryopreserved by slow freezing (Gosden et al.,
1994) and were donated for research at the patients’ request. Tissue was
thawed as described previously (Anderson et al., 2014), inspected, divided
into fragments, fixed and processed for staining and analysis as described
above.
Assessment of MFD in ovarian biopsies
Each histological section of every tissue fragment was examined under light
microscopy. Follicles were categorized according to their stage of develop-
ment as previously described (Telfer et al., 2008; McLaughlin et al., 2014).
To avoid over-counting, only follicles containing the nucleolus were
assessed. The volume of tissue analysed per patient was calculated as
described previously (Lass et al., 1997; Anderson et al., 2014). Briefly, tis-
sue volume was calculated as the sum of the area in square millimetre of all
tissue sections analysed per patient, multiplied by 0.006 mm (the thickness
of the sections) to give a value in cubic millimetre. The area of each section
was measured, and MFD was determined by dividing the total number of
follicles per patient by the volume of tissue analysed in cubic millimetre
(Anderson et al., 2014).
Evaluation of histology
Evaluation of the tissue sections was performed blinded to the treatment
groups. Follicles in freshly fixed and cultured tissue pieces were categorized
by developmental stage based on morphology as previously described
(McLaughlin et al., 2014). Follicle morphological normality was determined
by an assessment of the appearance of the oocyte and surrounding cells
using the cross-section containing the nucleolus as described previously
(McLaughlin and Telfer, 2010, McLaughlin et al., 2014). The presence of
biovular and binucleate follicles was also noted.
The spatial relationship between follicles was also assessed and classified
as (i) single, i.e. no follicles within 15 µm of the follicle being evaluated, (ii)
in close proximity, i.e. at least one other follicle occurring within 15 µm of
the follicle being evaluated or (iii) direct contact, i.e. where two or more
follicles appeared to share the same basal lamina or the basal laminae of
two or more follicles abutted. Follicles were classified as occurring in clus-
ters if five or more follicles were found in direct contact or close proximity.
The presence of naked oocytes with few or no surrounding cells was also
noted.
Fragment culture
Prior to fixation, a number of tissue fragments were selected at random
from a subsection of the ABVD-treated patients (n = 4; age range 23–29
years), one OEPA-COPDAC–treated patient (16 years), two untreated
controls (15 years and 30 years) and from obstetric patients (n = 10; age
range 23–36 years). Between two and six fragments were obtained for
each patient, prepared for culture and incubated for 6 days, then pro-
cessed for histological evaluation as previously described (McLaughlin
et al., 2014).
Immunohistochemistry
A number of ABVD-treated, OEPA-COPDAC–treated and control tissue
fragments fixed in NBF and embedded in paraffin as described previously
(McLaughlin et al., 2014) were selected at random and cut in 6 µm sections
and mounted on charged slides to investigate the expression of the germ-
line marker protein DEAD box polypeptide 4 (DDX4). Antigen retrieval
was performed using 0.01 M sodium citrate and endogenous peroxidase
activity quenched by 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. Tissue sections
were incubated in anti-DDX4/MVH ab13840 polyclonal primary antibody
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK) overnight at 4oC. Negative controls were estab-
lished by replacing the primary antibody with goat serum. On completion
of incubation, sections were washed and probed with anti-rabbit second-
ary antibody labelled with horseradish peroxidase for 30 min (ABC-Elite
Rabbit IgG, Vectastain Elite Kit, PK-6101; Vector Laboratories Ltd,
Peterborough, UK). DDX4 was detected using 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine
peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories Ltd). Structures were posi-
tively identified as germ cells when brown staining was observed within a
cell.
Statistical analysis
Observed mean follicle densities were compared to predicted mean follicle
densities using an age-related model of MFD in the cortex of the human
ovary (McLaughlin et al., 2015). Chi-square Goodness-of-Fit analysis was
used to test the null hypotheses that the observations matched predicted
MFD. Pearson’s product–moment correlation coefficients were also calcu-
lated to compare data to the line of identity where predictions exactly
match observations. Due to the need for high confidence in the significance
of any observed differences between predicted and observed densities,

 statistical significance was set at the 99% level throughout. Bland–Altman
analysis was used to estimate the number of SD away from agreement
between observations and predictions using the limits of agreement
reported in McLaughlin et al. (2015).
Results
Follicle density
The number of follicles and their developmental stage were deter-
mined by examining fresh and post-thawed fixed ovarian tissue from
14 previously treated and untreated lymphoma patients and an age-
matched group of 12 obstetric patients; a total of 6877 follicles were
examined. The total number of follicles counted in each group and the
volume of tissue analysed are shown in Table II. Ages and MFDs for
the three groups of lymphoma patients are shown in Fig. 1A, together
with age-related predictions taken from McLaughlin et al., (2015). For
the three patients who received no chemotherapy, we have insuffi-
cient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the observed values
for MFD are a perfect fit with predicted values taken from the age-
related model derived from data from other subjects receiving no
chemotherapy: Chi-square P-value = 0.07; Pearson’s product–
moment correlation coefficient = 0.999 (P < 0.01, Fig. 1B) with the
observations within 1.25 SD of agreement between observed and pre-
dicted values (Fig. 1C). The three patients who received OEPA-
COPDAC chemotherapy had significantly lower observed MFD than
predicted: Chi-square P-value < 0.01; Pearson’s product–moment
correlation coefficient = −0.399 (P = 0.74, Fig. 1B) with the observa-
tions between 0 and 11 SD lower than the predictions (Fig. 1C).
However, the eight patients who had received ABVD chemotherapy
had higher numbers of NGFs (160–303/mm3) compared with samples
from healthy women (8–46/mm3) (Table II). The ABVD group had
significantly higher value observed than predicted MFD: Chi-square
P-value < 0.001; Pearson’s product–moment correlation coefficient =
1.57 (P = 0.71, Fig. 1B) with observations between 9 and 21 SD higher
than the predictions (Fig.1C).
Time elapsed between completion of chemotherapy regimen and
biopsy ranged from 1 to 36 months, with six of the eight ABVD-treated

 patients having tissue collected within 6 weeks and all OEPA-
COPDAC patients undergoing biopsy within 9 months of treatment.
No correlation was found between the time interval and the MDF
observed in tissue treated with either regimen: the marked increase in
MFD in ABVD-treated tissues was observed in biopsies taken within
4 weeks of chemotherapy completion and was also present in samples
taken up to 36 months after treatment, although the small sample size
at the later treatment times does not allow for time after treatment to
be robustly tested. The OEPA-COPDAC tissue from two out of three
patients showed follicle numbers below that predicted at 6–9 months
post-treatment. Biopsy tissue was only available from each patient at
one time point; therefore, it was not possible to investigate by histo-
logical means whether deterioration or recovery of NGF density
occurred over time.
Follicle categorization
The majority of all follicles observed in fixed tissue were non-growing irre-
spective of illness, treatment or age (Fig. 2A). However ABVD-treated tis-
sue contained a significantly smaller percentage of growing follicles (3.0%)
compared to untreated, OEPA-COPDAC–treated and obstetric patients
(15.6%, 21.4% and 18.0% respectively; P < 0.001) (Fig. 2A).
Analysis of oocyte appearance showed that in biopsies collected
from untreated, ABVD-treated and obstetric patients, morphological
normality was high with >74% of oocytes appearing normal. In con-
trast, less than half of the oocytes in follicles observed in OEPA-
COPDAC–treated tissue met the criteria for normality (41.9% in
OEPA-COPDAC compared to 76.8% in untreated; 78.4% in ABVD-
treated and 74.2% in obstetric samples; P < 0.001) (Fig. 2C and D).

 Follicle development in cultured tissue
To investigate the in vitro developmental potential of chemotherapy-
exposed follicles, tissue fragments from a subset of patients represent-
ing each group were cultured for 6 days. It was not possible to culture
fragments from every patient due to the limited amount available. A
total of 89, 614 and 274 follicles were analysed in cultured tissue
obtained from untreated (n = 2), ABVD-treated (n = 4) and obstetric
patients (n = 10), respectively. Analysis of cultured tissue fragments
from two patients treated with OEPA-COPDAC has been omitted
due to extreme follicle degeneration in both patients. Initiation of fol-
licle growth was observed in all of the three remaining groups.
Post-culture, the proportion of growing follicles was 19.9% in ABVD-
treated tissue, 41.6% in untreated tissue and 46.3% in obstetric sam-
ples (all P < 0.001 versus uncultured) (Fig. 3A). Development to the
secondary stage occurred in both untreated and obstetric groups with
18% and 18.2% of follicles observed reaching this stage, respectively,
whereas very few follicles progressed in the ABVD-treated tissue,com-
prising only 1.2% of follicles at the secondary stage after culture
(Fig. 3B and C).
Immunohistochemical localization of DDX4
Due to the high density of NGFs observed in ABVD-treated tissue and
the presence of clusters, biovular and binucleate follicles, immunohis-
tochemistry was performed to examine whether the germline marker
DDX4 could be localized in these structures. Uncultured tissues sec-
tions from nine patients representing all groups were studied; the
number of sections per patient was variable due to tissue availability,
and the number of follicles per section was also highly variable.
Discrete positive DDX4 staining was observed in oocytes of follicles at
all stages of development in all groups. DDX4 was also localized to the
biovular and binucleate oocytes and clusters of naked oocytes with
adjacent or shared oolemma observed in ABVD-treated tissue. No
positive staining was observed in any tissue sections where the primary
antibody had been omitted (Fig. 3D).
Spatial distribution of follicles
In all groups, individual follicles and groups of follicles were distributed
unevenly throughout the cortex; however, the pattern of distribution
varied between groups with the majority of follicles occurring dis-
cretely (single follicles ≥ 15 µm apart) in obstetric tissue (Fig. 4A and
B). ABVD-treated and untreated adolescent tissues appeared mark-
edly different from the others examined, with significantly fewer dis-
crete follicles seen and clusters of closely packed follicles (five or more
NGF ≤ 15 µm apart) observed in these groups (P < 0.05; ABVD-
treated and untreated versus OEPA-COPDAC–treated and obstetric
patients) (Fig.4A and C). Biovular and binucleate follicles were
observed in ABVD-treated tissues and also in the 12-year-old
untreated patient’s tissue comprising between 8% and 18% of the
NGF population. These structures were not observed in the other

oocytes, which otherwise appeared morphologically normal (Fig 4C).
Discussion
Ovarian dysfunction and reduced fertility potential can be a conse-
quence of cytotoxic therapy particularly where alkylating agents have
been used, with resultant loss of the ovarian reserve (Meirow et al.,
2010). In contrast, women diagnosed with lymphoma and treated with
the gonad-sparing regimen ABVD have a low risk of significant impair-
ment of fertility (Hodgson et al., 2007) or of POI (Swerdlow et al.,
2014), and no reduction in follicle numbers have been observed
(Seshadri et al., 2006). The impact of chemotherapy on the ovarian
reserve is evaluated indirectly by clinical parameters including amenor-
rhoea, AMH and FSH levels (Meirow, 2000; Oktay et al., 2006;
Anderson and Cameron, 2011). Post-treatment AMH levels in lymph-
oma patients clearly show the differential impact of ABVD and alkylat-
ing agent-based regimens (Decanter et al., 2010), and AMH levels may
also be reduced at the time of diagnosis (Lawrenz et al., 2012).
Although early studies showed that chemotherapy reduced the num-
ber of antral follicles in the ovary in girls treated for leukaemia
(Himelstein-Braw et al., 1978); this is the most detailed quantitative
analysis of the direct effect of chemotherapy treatment on density of
the ovarian reserve in lymphoma patients and the impact of the differ-
ent chemotherapy regimens on morphology and in vitro developmental
potential of follicles. In this study, we have identified and quantified dif-
ferences in the NGF population of treated and untreated lymphoma
patients. The observed MFD of untreated lymphoma patients were
close to the densities predicted by an age-related model indicating that
the disease itself is not implicated in the variations of the ovarian
reserve observed in the chemotherapy-treated groups.
Treatment regimens containing alkylating agents such as cyclophos-
phamide are known to lead to POI via a direct or indirect reduction in
the NGF population (Meirow, 2000; Oktem and Oktay, 2007; Meirow
et al., 2010). Our finding that patients treated with the OEPA-
COPDAC regimen had lower than predicted MFDs confirms and
quantifies this, although the MFD in this small group varied from very
low to close-to-average for age. Further analysis of the degree of loss
is not possible without knowing pretreatment values. In this study,
patients treated with OEPA-COPDAC were all teenagers (14, 15 and
16 years) at the time of tissue collection, which was 6–9 months after
completion of chemotherapy. Of the three patients included in this
study treated with OEPA-COPDAC, one was diagnosed with reduced
ovarian reserve based on having regular menstrual cycles but undetect-
able AMH levels 1 year after completion of treatment and another
was diagnosed with POI 6 years post-chemotherapy.
Surprisingly, we found a striking and statistically highly significant
increase in follicle number and MFD after ABVD chemotherapy. All
eight ABVD patients had higher follicle counts (Table II) and a mark-
edly higher follicle density than predicted (Fig. 2C). Despite the well

 reported variation of follicle density between and within human cor-
tical biopsies follicles (Kohl et al., 2000; Qu et al., 2000; Poirot et al.,
2002; Schmidt et al., 2003; McLaughlin et al., 2015), all ABVD-treated
samples consistently showed an increase in the NGF population,
whereas this was not seen for any of the other groups or individual
biopsies. We initially considered that this increase might be attributed
to a reduction in ovarian volume during treatment as all treatments
would result in an initial reduction in ovarian volume because of the
loss of large follicles. However, MFD is based on volume of ovarian
cortex, not whole ovary and there is no evidence to support a differ-
ential effect on ovarian cortex volume by any treatment. Additionally,
these samples were collected 4 weeks to 36 months after the comple-
tion of treatment with resumption of follicular growth (indicated by
regular menses) in those with longer intervals, and there was no
apparent relationship between increased follicle number/MFD and
interval since treatment. The observed differences between ABVD
MFD and control data is between 9 and 21 SD (Figure 1C), and so a
reduction in cortical volume would need to be of that order of magni-
tude. There are no clinical data/observations to support such a degree
of shrinkage.
The underlying mechanism for an increase in MFD after ABVD treat-
ment remains to be established. An alternative explanation may be
that this treatment has resulted in new oocytes/follicles being formed.
Putative germline stem cells or oogonial stem cells, which may be cap-
able of regenerating the NGF population under perturbed conditions
have been identified within the adult human ovary (White et al.,2012;
Dunlop et al., 2013; Hanna and Hennebold, 2014). It is possible that
the ABVD combination or specific components activate these cells to
form oocytes or oocyte like structures. Recent studies have shown
that mesenchymal stem cells are sensitive to bleomycin treatment
(Nicolay et al., 2016), but nothing is known about how these drugs
affect putative germline stem cells and other ovarian cells.
We also observed that post-ABVD tissue contains follicle clusters,
many containing biovular and binucleate follicles, a feature more com-
monly associated with the prepubertal ovary (Anderson et al., 2014).
Follicles with more than one oocyte are reported during foetal devel-
opment and in early life in many mammalian species (Papadaki, 1978;
Telfer and Gosden 1987; Silva-Santos and Seneda, 2011) but are much
rarer in adults (Turkalj et al., 2013) and may be preferentially lost with
abnormal follicles during childhood (Anderson et al., 2014). No biovu-
lar or binucleate follicles were observed in tissue from healthy women
or following OEPA-COPDAC treatment highlighting that this differ-
ence in NGF patterning in the cortex of tissue is a result of the specific
chemotherapy treatment. Furthermore, the in vitro developmental
potential of ABVD-treated tissue showed differences compared to
control tissue, with limited follicle development, comparable to that
from prepubertal girls (Anderson et al., 2014). We suggest that the
lack of development in ABVD-treated tissue may be attributed to the
inhibitory effect exerted by the high density of primordial follicles pre-
sent (Da Silva-Buttkus et al., 2009). Initiation of follicle growth was
observed in the obstetric patient cohort supporting the findings of pre-
vious studies (Anderson et al., 2014, McLaughlin et al., 2014).
In summary, this study demonstrates that ABVD treatment does not
diminish the ovarian reserve and may paradoxically increase it. Other
significant features such as the presence of biovular and binucleate
oocytes and clustering are increased. In this respect, ABVD-exposed

 tissue is similar to that from prepubertal girls, and this similarity is also
reflected in its reduced capacity for follicle development in vitro. The
number of patients analysed is small, and so interpretation should be
cautious. However, the data presented here have highlighted a phe-
nomenon that has not been previously reported. Further investigation
is required to elucidate the mechanism by which the ovarian reserve is
affected by ABVD treatment, and the consequences for later fertility
and reproductive lifespan.
