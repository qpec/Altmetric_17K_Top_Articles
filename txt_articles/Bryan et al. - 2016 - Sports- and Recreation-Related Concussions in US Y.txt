abstract
OBJECTIVE: The incidence of sports- and recreation-related concussions (SRRCs) in the 
United States is unknown. More than 44 million youth participate in sports annually, thus 
understanding the frequency of SRRCs in children is important on a population level. Our 
objective was to determine the number of SRRCs occurring annually among US youth ≤18 
years old.
METHODS: We identified SRRCs using 3 national databases: MarketScan, National Electronic 
Injury Surveillance System, and National High School Sports Related Injury Surveillance 
System, Reporting Injury Online. We determined the number of SRRCs seen in health care 
settings (outpatient, inpatient, and emergency department) and SRRCs reported to certified 
high school athletic trainers (ATCs). We used these data and findings in recently published 
literature to generate a national estimate of SRRCs.
RESULTS: We estimate that between 1.1 and 1.9 million SRRCs occur annually in US children 
aged ≤18 years. Most children with SRRCs, 511 590 to 1 240 972, were not seen in health 
care settings. Of children with SRRCs seen in health care settings, most were seen as 
outpatients with 377 978 visits, compared with between 115 479 and 166 929 ED visits, and 
between 2886 and 4936 hospitalizations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the most accurate and precise estimate to date of the 
number of concussions among US children annually. SRRCs are a common injury in children. 
Providers in all health care settings need to be trained in concussion care. There is a need 
for better surveillance to enhance our understanding of the epidemiology of concussions in 
youth.

Sports- and Recreation-Related Concussions in US Youth. 
Pediatrics. 2016;138(1):e20154635
WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Sports- and 
recreation-related concussions (SRRCs) are a 
common source of morbidity in children. Many of 
these injuries are not treated within health care 
settings. It is unknown how many SRRCs occur 
annually in the US.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: We estimate between 1.1 
and 1.9 million SRRCs occur annually in US children 
≤18 years old. The magnitude of this number 
emphasizes the need for better national injury 
surveillance of the incidence of SRRCs.

Concussions, a form of traumatic 
brain injury (TBI), are common 
in children, with sports and 
recreation as a leading cause in 
this age group.1, 
2 The incidence 
of sports- and recreation-related 
concussions (SRRCs) in the United 
States is unknown; however, most 
epidemiologic studies indicate that 
a large number of SRRCs occur each 
year.3–7 More than 44 million youth 
participate in sports annually, and 
thus understanding the frequency of 
SRRCs in children and adolescents is 
important on a population level.1, 
8
One challenge in calculating the 
incidence of SRRCs is that injured 
youth may not receive treatment, or 
may receive care from a variety of 
providers including certified athletic 
trainers (ATCs), primary care, and 
emergency medicine physicians. 
Few studies have examined SRRCs 
across multiple care settings.5, 
8 
Population-based studies on the 
incidence of SRRCs often focus 
only on sport-specific injuries in 
high school and college athletes. 
These estimates frequently omit 
recreational activities, a major source 
of SRRCs in younger children. Thus, 
existing estimates do not provide 
comprehensive assessments of SRRC 
prevalence.6, 
9
The most commonly cited estimate 
is that between 1.6 and 3.8 million 
sports- and recreation-related 
TBIs occur annually in the United 
States.5 This estimate was based 
on the Injury Supplement to the 
1991 National Health Interview 
Survey, which defined TBI as a head 
injury with loss of consciousness, 
then inflated the number using the 
estimated proportion of concussions 
without loss of consciousness.3, 
10 
In addition to being based on self-
reported data from assessments 
>2 decades ago, the range is wide. 
Despite these profound methodologic 
limitations, this estimate is widely 
cited by numerous authors. We 
sought to generate an updated and 
more accurate national estimate of 
SRRCs in children ≤18 years old from 
available population-based data.
METHODS
Data Sources
Multiple data sources were used 
to generate a national estimate 
for 2013, the year for which most 
recent data were available. Because 
only anonymized data were used, 
the study was exempt from human 
subjects committee review.
We used the conceptual framework 
in Fig 1 to comprehensively identify 
all children ≤18 years old with 
SRRCs. The National Electronic 
Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) 
and MarketScan databases contain 
information on all emergency 
department (ED) visits and inpatient 
hospitalizations for SRRCs (cells 
A–F in Fig 1). Office visits for both 
primary and subspecialty care are 
contained within MarketScan (cells 
A–C in Fig 1). For treatment locations 
with data from multiple sources, such 
as the ED, the estimates from each 
source were included separately, 
which created a range for the final 
estimate but prevented double 
counting of cases.
From the narrative review of NEISS, 
concussions were considered sports-
related if there was any mention of a 
sport, regardless of injury mechanism 
(eg, hit by player, fell while playing); 
concussions were determined 
to be recreation-related if the 
narrative reported any recreational 
activities such as bicycling or if the 
injury occurred in a recreational 
setting, such as playgrounds. 
The Supplemental Information 
contains a comprehensive list of 
the sports, recreational activities 
and locations included. Our method 
of determining SRRCs was more 
inclusive than many previous studies, 
which excluded specific causes or 
required sports- and recreation-
related E-codes for inclusion.4, 
11, 
12 
Because MarketScan is dependent on 
International Classification of Disease, 
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM) codes and the presence 
of E-codes for injuries is variable, 
we used an exclusion method for 
classification of SRRCs in MarketScan. 
Sports and recreation, motor vehicle 
collisions, and falls account for 
∼80% of concussions in children.11, 
13 
We excluded concussions due to 
motor vehicle collisions (ICD-9-CM 
codes E810-E819) and falls (ICD-
9-CM codes E880.×, E881.×, E882, 
E883.×, E884.×, E885.9, E888.×) 
to count only SRRCs. However, by 
excluding all concussions coded due 
to falls, we may have underestimated 
the true number of SRRCs by not 
counting concussions from falls

during sports and recreational 
activities. Conversely, we may have 
overestimated the number of SRRCs 
by misclassifying concussions as 
SRRCs that were from “other causes, 
” 
such as falling objects, assault, or 
unknown circumstances. To adjust 
for this potential misclassification, 
we excluded an additional 15% from 
the original number of concussion 
visits based on previous studies that 
have identified ∼15% of concussion 
being due to other causes.11, 
14
MarketScan
To identify SRRCs that resulted 
in health care encounters, we 
queried the Truven Health Analytics 
MarketScan Research Database for 
2013. This database contains health 
care claims of individuals who 
have commercial health insurance, 
covering ∼30 million individuals 
in the United States annually.15 It 
contains information on outpatient, 
ED, and inpatient claims. We used 
ICD-9-CM codes for concussion 
(850.xx and 854.09). Because we 
aimed to identify visits for incident 
concussions, we excluded claims if 
there had been a previous claim for 
concussion within the preceding 1 
month to minimize the likelihood 
of including follow-up visits from 
the same injury. This time period 
was chosen because symptoms 
resolve within 1 month in 70% to 
90% of youth with SRRCs.6, 
16–19 
We conducted a sensitivity analysis 
using alternate exclusion periods of 
2 weeks and 3 months to determine 
how different time periods affected 
the estimate. We used 2 weeks as 
the shortest period based on typical 
symptom resolution. The 3-month 
period was based on the definition 
of postconcussive syndrome (PCS) in 
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, 
which differs from the ICD-9-CM 
definition of 1 month.
Incidence rates were calculated on 
the basis of the number of claims 
divided by the number of enrollees 
(11 533 618 children ≤18 years 
during 2013). Age was categorized 
in years: 0 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 13, 
and 14 to 18 to reflect preschool, 
elementary, middle school, and high 
school ages. We multiplied incidence 
rates by population estimates from 
the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention Web-based Injury 
Statistic Query and Reporting System 
to determine concussion counts by 
age category. We constructed 95% 
confidence intervals using a Poisson 
distribution. These calculations 
are based on the assumption that 
MarketScan is representative of the 
US population. We believe this is 
reasonable as MarketScan contains 
a substantial sample of the US 
population (15%).
NEISS
To estimate the number of ED visits 
and hospitalizations from SRRCs, 
we analyzed data from NEISS.20 
NEISS, a database operated by 
the US Consumer Product Safety 
Commission, consists of data on all 
ED visits including a brief description 
of the event and disposition 
for a probability sample of 100 
hospitals. The number of inpatient 
hospitalizations was determined by 
the number of patients who were 
admitted from the ED. We conducted 
a narrative review of all concussion 
cases to determine the proportion 
of concussions that were SRRCs. We 
classified SRRCs as occurring during 
school sports using binary yes/no, 
and whether it was 1 of the 9 sports 
included in the National High School 
Sports Related Injury Surveillance 
System (High School Reporting 
Injury Online [RIO]), described 
subsequently.
Estimates of the annual number 
of SRRCs nationally treated in the 
ED and admitted from the ED were 
generated using weights based 
on the probability sampling of 
hospitals in NEISS. We constructed 
95% confidence intervals using 
the coefficient of variation by age 
category provided in NEISS.
National High School Sports-Related 
Injury Surveillance System, High School 
RIO
Certified ATCs are qualified health 
professionals for diagnosis and 
treatment of concussions.21 Previous 
studies have demonstrated that 
student athletes often report 
SRRCs to ATCs. Many of these SRRCs 
do not result in an encounter with 
additional health care providers 
and would not be included in the 
previously described databases.16, 
22, 
23 
To determine the number of high 
school athletes who receive care 
exclusively from ATCs, we used data 
from High School RIO.24 High School 
RIO is an Internet-based sports injury 
surveillance system that records 
sports-related injuries reported 
by high school ATCs for a random 
sample of 100 US high schools. 
These 100 schools with a National 
Athletic Trainers’ Association–
affiliated ATC are randomly selected 
based on school population and 
geographic location to create a 
nationally representative sample. 
Data are reported for 9 sports: boys’ 
football, boys’ and girls’ soccer, girls’ 
volleyball, boys’ and girls’ basketball, 
boys’ wrestling, boys’ baseball, and 
girls’ softball.
We examined all concussions 
included in High School RIO for 
2013. Data collected in RIO included 
types of health care providers 
seen by concussed athletes: ATCs, 
physicians, and other providers 
(nurse practitioners, physician 
assistants, etc). To eliminate overlap 
between SRRCs from High School RIO 
and those in MarketScan and NEISS, 
we only included students seen 
exclusively by ATCs; we believed this 
represented SRRCs in high school 
athletes that were not captured by 
our other data sources. Using weight-
based probability sampling provided 
by High School RIO, we generated a 
national estimate of the number of 
3

SRRCs in high school students who 
participated in the sports in High 
School RIO and were treated by ATCs 
exclusively.
SRRCs Not Captured by Previous 
Databases
The most challenging number 
to determine was the number of 
children with concussions who were 
not seen in health care settings 
captured by our databases, namely, 
children who sought care from 
ATCs or did not receive care. From 
High School RIO, we determined the 
number of SRRCs from the 9 high 
school sports covered by RIO and 
the proportion of these that were 
reported only to ATCs. To create 
an estimate that included all high 
school SRRCs seen exclusively by 
ATCs, we used NEISS to determine 
the proportion of high school sports 
injuries from sports covered by High 
School RIO because NEISS was the 
only other data source that included 
data on the activity that resulted 
in injury. We inversely weighted 
the High School RIO data by this 
proportion to estimate the number 
of SRRCs from all high school sports 
that were treated exclusively by ATCs 
(cell G in Fig 1).
Estimates in the literature of the 
proportion of untreated SRRCs in 
high school athletes range between 
22.5% and 52.7%.22, 
23, 
25 To generate 
an estimated number of untreated 
SRRCs from high school sports (cell 
H), we applied this range (22.5%–
52.7%) to the number of concussions 
from High School RIO (Figs 2 and 3).
There are major gaps in the literature 
regarding treatment of children 
who experience concussions during 
nonschool sports and recreation. In 
1 ED-based study of concussions, 
53% of SRRCs in adolescents aged 
between 14 and 19 years were not 
school sport–related.27 To determine 
the number of untreated SRRCs that 
occurred in nonschool (cell I) and 
recreation settings (cell J) for high 
school age youth, we applied that 
53% to the estimated number of 
SRRCs in high school sports (cell H; 
Fig 3).
There are limited data on untreated 
SRRCs occurring in children <14 
years for all sports- and recreation-
related activities (cells H–J). A 
prospective cohort study of middle 
school female soccer players 
found that 55.9% of players with 
symptoms of concussion were 
never evaluated.26 We applied this 
proportion (55.9%) to the number 
of concussions from MarketScan 
and NEISS data to estimate the 
number of SRRCs that go untreated 
in children <14 years of age (Figs 2 
and 3). Because there have been so 
few studies in young children, we 
conducted a sensitivity analysis to 
vary the percentage of untreated 
SRRCs for children <14 years. For 
this analysis, we used the range 
of percentages of unreported 
concussions in high school athletes 
(22.5%–52.7%) applied to younger 
children.22, 
23, 
25
RESULTS
Treated by Health Care Providers 
(Cells A–G)
Outpatient visits accounted for 
68.7% of MarketScan claims 
and an incidence of 485 SRRCs 
per 100 000 children per year. 
Inpatient hospitalizations and ED 
visits represented 0.9% and 30.4% 
of MarketScan claims for SRRCs, 
respectively (Table 1). On the basis 
of data from NEISS and MarketScan, 
we estimated a population incidence 
between 4 and 6 hospitalizations and 
between 148 and 214 ED visits for 
SRRCs per 100 000 US children per 
year.
Using alternate exclusion periods of 2 
weeks and 3 months for MarketScan 
claims, we identified 11.6% more 
SRRCs and 6.6% fewer SRRCs, 
respectively (Table 2).
From High School RIO, we estimated 
335 342 SRRCs annually from 
the 9 included high school sports 
(95% confidence interval 321 628–
349 056). Of these, 21.8% were 
seen exclusively by ATCs (Table 
1). On the basis of review of NEISS 
cases, 85% of SRRCs from school 
sports in adolescents 14 to 18 years 
old occurred during sports in High 
School RIO. Thus, we estimated 
394 520 SRRCs occurred in all high 
school athletes, of which 85 885 were 
treated only by ATCs (Cell G for ages 
14–18; Fig 3). The remaining 308 636 
concussions are captured in cells A 
and D. Because information for youth 
<14 years is not captured in RIO, 
there are no contributions to cell G 
from younger children.
We estimated between 582 228 and 
635 728 SRRCs are treated annually 
by health care providers in the United 
States for an incidence between 
748 and 816 SRRCs per 100 000 US 
children per year.
Not Treated by Any Health Care 
Provider (Cells H, I, and J)
Between 22.5% and 52.7% of SRRCs 
from high school sports are not 
reported to any provider. Applying 
this range to the 394 520 concussions

estimated from High School RIO, we 
estimated an additional 114 538 to

high school athletes (cell H; Fig 3). 
On the basis of an estimated 53% 
of concussions in this age group 
not related to school sports, we 
estimated an additional 129 160 to 
495 674 untreated SRRCs occurring 
in nonschool sport and recreational 
settings (cells I and J). In children <14 
years, we estimated between 267 892 
and 305 738 untreated SRRCs based 
on the estimate of 55.9% of SRRCs 
in this age group that were not

untreated SRRCs in children <14 
years estimate between 59 772 and 
216 483 untreated SRRCs.
In children ≤18 years old, we 
estimated between 511 590 and 
1 240 972 SRRCs are untreated each 
year. (Fig 3)
In total, we estimated between 
1 093 818 and 1 876 700 SRRCs occur 
annually in US children ≤18 years 
old, for an incidence between 1405 
and 2410 per 100 000 children in 
2013.
DISCUSSION
Our estimate of 1.1 to 1.9 million 
SRRCs annually in US children 
≤18 years old includes population 
estimates for SRRCs diagnosed by 
health care providers and those who 
are undiagnosed. We estimate more 
than half a million children use health 
care services annually for treatment 
of SRRCs. This number emphasizes 
the need to improve primary 
prevention efforts aimed at children, 
parents, and coaches.
Our estimate is substantially lower 
than the previous estimate of 1.6 
to 3.8 million TBIs annually.5 This 
difference is expected because we 
focused on children ≤18 years old. 
A previous population-based study 
found ∼61% of SRRCs occur in 
youth 0 to 18 years.4 Applying this 
percentage to the Langlois estimate, 
we would expect between 980 800 
and 2.3 million SRRCs annually, 
which is in reasonable accordance 
with our estimate.
The difference in the ED estimates 
from the NEISS and MarketScan 
databases likely stems from 2 
sources. Our query of MarketScan 
was more inclusive with ICD-9-CM 
codes for both concussion (850) 
and unspecified intracranial injury 
(854), whereas we queried NEISS 
exclusively based on concussion 
diagnosis because NEISS does 
not use ICD codes. We conducted 
a narrative review of NEISS 
concussions to determine SRRCs. 
Because MarketScan does not 
contain narrative information, 
we used an exclusion method to 
eliminate other common causes. 
The true estimate of ED visits from 
SRRCs likely lies between these 2 
values. The NEISS data may be an 
underestimate because of nonspecific 
coding and narrative information, 
whereas the MarketScan data may 
be overly inclusive by counting some 
concussions from non-SRRC causes 
as SRRCs.
Many previous population-based 
studies of concussion have focused 
on reporting concussion rates by 
athletic exposure, which are difficult 
to compare with our results of the 
count and incidence of SRRCs across 
the population.7, 
9, 
28–32 The number 
of athletic exposures per individual 
is variable by age and challenging 
to quantify for recreational 
activities. Many studies examining 
underreporting of concussions are 
sport-specific and focus only on 
older youth. Despite this limitation, 
we sought to include children of all 
ages with untreated SRRCs because 
previous studies have consistently 
identified that youth commonly do 
not receive care for concussions. For 
our estimate, we included studies 
from the literature with the goal 
of identifying the possible range 
of untreated SRRCs. As a result, 
there is variability in our estimate 
that is reflected in its range and the 
sensitivity analyses. The lack of a 
national surveillance system for this 
common injury has been identified 
as a major issue by the Institute 
of Medicine (IOM).33, 
34 The large 
number of unreported concussions 
identified in our study, between 
511 590 and 1 240 972, indicates 
a need for a cultural shift in the 
recognition of SRRCs. Surveillance 
for SRRCs must focus on recognizing 
and treating concussions across all 
age groups and include recreational 
activities.
There are numerous studies 
demonstrating that many children 
and adolescents do not report 
concussion symptoms to any 
health care providers, but it is 
unclear how many people who 
experience symptoms have a true 
concussion diagnosis.17, 
22, 
23, 
25, 
35, 
36 
We applied rates from studies of 
middle and high school students 
underreporting concussions across 
younger age groups because 
there is little information on SRRC 
reporting in younger children. 
There are no studies to date that 
examine unreported concussions for 
nonschool sports and recreational 
activities; because of this, we used 
reporting from school sports applied 
to nonschool sports and recreational 
activities. Our estimate is vulnerable 
given these assumptions and the 
use of reporting percentages from 
past literature, some of which are 
sport-specific, because larger more 
comprehensive studies have not 
yet been done. The MarketScan 
data used pertained to private 
insurance companies and did not 
include public insurance. There 
have been no studies evaluating 
differences in outpatient visits for 
SRRCs by insurance status, although 
1 study found differences in TBI 
admissions.37 The data sources

the final estimate.
CONCLUSIONS
Our national estimate of the number 
of SRRC occurring to youth indicates 
the magnitude of these injuries in the 
United States. As a result of the IOM 
initiative, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention is currently 
developing a surveillance system 
for SRRCs. It is critical this system 
includes recreational sources of 
concussion. The imprecision of our 
current estimate underscores the 
clinical and public health importance 
of the IOM’s recommendation for 
the establishment of an accurate 
surveillance program.
