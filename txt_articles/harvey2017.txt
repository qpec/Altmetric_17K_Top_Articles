Introduction
9
Contractures are common for people with many types of
10
injuries and disabilities. For example, they are common in people
11
with neurological conditions such as brain injury, stroke or spinal
12
cord injuries.1,2 They are also common in people with non-
13
neurological conditions such as burns, fractures, shoulder capsu-
14
litis and Dupuytren’s Disease.3 Contractures are undesirable
15
because they are unsightly and have deleterious implications on
16
function and quality of life. For instance, ankle plantarflexion
17
contractures in people with brain injuries impede gait, and finger
18
flexion contractures in people with crush injuries interfere with
19
hand function.
20
Stretch is the main intervention used by physiotherapists for
21
the treatment and prevention of contractures. Stretch is applied in
22
many different ways, including plaster casts, splints or through the
23
hands of therapists (see www.physiotherapyexercises.com for
24
examples of stretches typically prescribed by physiotherapists). In
25
addition, physiotherapists widely recommend that people with all
26
types of injuries and disabilities routinely stretch at home in an
27
effort to either treat or prevent contractures. For example, those
28
with spinal cord injuries are often instructed to devote up to 1 hour
29
per day for the rest of their lives to stretch, in an effort to treat and
30
prevent contractures.
There is animal evidence to indicate a reduction in the number of
31
serial sarcomeres of muscles immobilised in a shortened position,4
32
while regular and prolonged stretch causes morphological changes
33
with a resultant lasting increase in extensibility.4,5 These studies give
34
credence to the belief that stretch is effective for the treatment and
35
prevention of contractures. These beliefs are further supported by
36
strong anecdotal evidence along with the promising results of case
37
studies and uncontrolled trials. However, the effects observed in case
38
studies and uncontrolled trials may reflect bias or the effects of
39
natural recovery or other co-interventions. It is therefore imperative

Systematic review

Question: Is stretch effective for the treatment and prevention of contractures in people with
neurological and non-neurological conditions? Design: A Cochrane Systematic Review with meta-
analyses of randomised trials. Participants: People with or at risk of contractures. Intervention: Trials
were considered for inclusion if they compared stretch to no stretch, or stretch plus co-intervention to
co-intervention only. The stretch could be administered in any way. Outcome measures: The outcome of
interest was joint mobility. Two sets of meta-analyses were conducted with a random-effects model: one
for people with neurological conditions and the other for people with non-neurological conditions. The
quality of evidence supporting the results of the two sets of meta-analyses was assessed using GRADE.
Results: Eighteen studies involving 549 participants examined the effectiveness of stretch in people with
neurological conditions, and provided useable data. The pooled mean difference was 2 deg (95% CI 0 to 3)
favouring stretch. This was equivalent to a relative change of 2% (95% CI 0 to 3). Eighteen studies involving
865 participants examined the effectiveness of stretch in people with non-neurological conditions, and
provided useable data. The pooled standardised mean difference was 0.2 SD (95% CI 0 to 0.3) favouring
stretch. This translated to an absolute mean increase of 1 deg (95% CI 0 to 2) and a relative change of 1%
(95% CI 0 to 2). The GRADE level of evidence was high for both sets of meta-analyses. Conclusion: Stretch
does not have clinically important effects on joint mobility. [Harvey LA, Katalinic OM, Herbert RD,

to focus on randomised, controlled trials if a reliable answer is to be
41
found as to whether stretch is effective for the treatment and
42
prevention of contractures. This question was examined in a
43
Cochrane Systematic Review in 20106 and in an updated review in
44
2017.7 The present paper provides an abridged republication of the
45
2017 version of this Cochrane Systematic Review. It focuses on the
46
short-term effects of stretch on joint mobility (effects present for
< 1 weekafterthe laststretch intervention), but includes the two key
47
meta-analyses involving people with neurological and non-neuro-
48
logical conditions. The full review includes other outcomes and
49
examines the long-term effects (effects present > 1 week after the
50
last stretch intervention) as well as various sub-group analyses.
51
Therefore, the main research question for this systematic
52
review was:
53
Does stretching improve joint mobility in the short term in
54
people with neurological or non-neurological conditions?
55
Methods
56
All databases were searched up until November 2015 (see
57
Cochrane Systematic Review7 for full details) and potentially
58
eligible trials screened for inclusion by two review authors.
59
Disagreements between the two review authors were resolved by
60
discussion and, when necessary, arbitrated by a third author. The
61
following inclusion criteria were used to identify trials.
Participants: People of any age, including children, provided
62
they either had or were deemed susceptible to contracture. This
63
included conditions such as burns, arthritis, spinal cord injury,
64
stroke and frailty.
Type of intervention: Any intervention that involved adminis-
65
tering a stretch to maintain or increase the mobility of any synovial
66
joint. The stretch needed to be administered on more than one
67
occasion and for > 20 seconds. This included stretch administered
68
through positioning programs, splints, serial casting or as part of
69
manual therapy.
Comparisons: The stretch intervention needed to be compared
70
to no stretch, placebo stretch or sham stretch. The stretch could
71
also be compared to another intervention or usual care, provided
72
the other intervention or usual care was also administered to the
73
group receiving the stretch.
Outcomes: 
There 
were 
seven 
outcomes, 
including: 
joint
74
mobility, quality of life, pain, activity limitation, participation
75
restriction, adverse events and spasticity. However, for this
76
publication we only report results for joint mobility. Joint mobility
77
could be measured in many ways; the most common were: active
78
range of motion (deg), passive range of motion (deg), passive joint
79
stiffness (deg per unit torque) or linear distance between two
80
points (eg, finger-tip to floor distance in mm).
81
Two review authors extracted joint mobility data for two time
82
points: short term and long term. However, only the short-term
83
effects are presented in this paper. This referred to effects present
84
up to 1 week after the last stretch intervention. ANCOVA-adjusted

between-group means and standard deviations were extracted in
103
preference to change scores. However, if neither were provided,
104
post-intervention scores were used. Two meta-analyses were
105
conducted by pooling studies involving people with neurological
106
conditions and non-neurological conditions using a random-
107
effects model. The data were only pooled if there was no evidence
108
of clinical or statistical heterogeneity (I2 > 50%). In both meta-
109
analyses the results were divided and also analysed by diagnosis.
110
The pooled treatment effect was expressed as a mean difference if
111
the outcomes in all the studies were the same and a standardized
112
mean difference if they differed. Further sub-group analyses were
113
conducted to explore the possibilities that the effectiveness of
114
stretch depends on different factors, including the size of the joint
115
or muscle that is stretched and whether stretch is administered for
116
the treatment or prevention of contractures (see Cochrane
117
Systematic Review for full details). Here we just report the results
118
of the sub-group analyses exploring the possibility that the
119
effectiveness of stretch depends on the dosage of stretch and the
120
way in which the stretch is administered. All data were analysed
121
using Review Manager 5.a
122
Trials were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of
123
Bias Tool. Each trial was rated as high risk, unclear risk or low risk
124
on the following eight domains: sequence generation, conceal
125
allocation, blinding of participants and therapists, blinding of
126
outcome assessors for objective outcomes, blinding of outcome
127
assessors for subjective outcomes, incomplete outcome data,
128
selective outcome reporting and other potential threats of bias. The
129
GRADE approach was used to evaluate the quality of evidence in
130
each meta-analysis as high, medium, low or very low. This
131
approach takes into account: susceptibility to bias; directness of
132
evidence; heterogeneity or inconsistencies in the results; impre-
133
cision; and probability of publication bias.
134
Results
135
A total of 5048 papers were screened for inclusion and
136
135 were potentially eligible. Ultimately, 49 studies involving
137
2135 participants met the inclusion criteria, with 28 studies
138
involving 898 participants with neurological conditions and
139
21 studies involving 1237 participants with non-neurological
140
conditions. All studies measured joint mobility, but some did not
141
provide useable data and others did not measure joint mobility
142
within 1 week of the last intervention.
143
The risk of bias in the 49 studies was variable (see Figure 1).
144
Approximately half of the studies were rated as low risk of bias for
145
each of the eight domains. No study blinded participants or
146
therapists, as this is not possible in trials involving stretch. All
147
studies compared stretch and a co-intervention to a co-interven-
148
tion only. The co-interventions included usual care, botulinum
149
toxin, passive stretches, exercise and therapy. Joint mobility was
150
measured in degrees in all but four studies involving non-
151
neurological conditions (see Table 1).

The effects of stretch in people with neurological conditions
153
Twenty-six studies with a total of 699 participants investigated
154
the short-term effects on joint mobility following stretch in people
155
with neurological conditions.8–33 Two additional studies only
156
measured the long-term effects of stretch and are not included
157
here.34,35 Eighteen studies with a total of 549 participants provided
158
sufficient 
data, 
and 
all 
studies 
measured 
joint 
mobility.8–
159
11,13,15,16,18–20,22,25–27,29–31,33 The participants included people with
160
stroke, Charcot-Marie Tooth disease, acquired brain injury and
161
spinal cord injury. The mean difference was 2 deg (95% CI 0 to 3,
162
I2 = 37%, p = 0.009) (see Figure 2, see Figure 3 on the eAddenda for a
163
detailed forest plot). This is equivalent to a relative change of 2%
164
(95% CI 0 to 3). The GRADE quality of evidence for this result was
165
high.
166
The effects of stretch in people with non-neurological conditions
167
Nineteen studies with a total of 925 participants investigated
168
the short-term effects on joint mobility following stretch in people
169
with non-neurological conditions.36–54 Two additional studies
170
only measured the long-term effects of stretch and are not
171
included here.55,56 All 19 studies provided sufficient data and all
172
but two studies measured joint mobility in degrees.37,40 There was
173
substantial statistical heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 67%) and
174
the standardised mean difference was 0.3 SD (95% CI 0.1 to 0.6). The
175
main reason for this heterogeneity was one study,43 in which the
176
results for two of the three outcomes were between 5 and 30 times
177
greater than the results for any other study. There was no obvious
178
explanation for this but the extreme results all favouring the
179
experimental condition seemed implausible. Therefore, 18 studies
180
with a total of 865 participants were included in the present
181
analyses.36–42,44–54 The participants included frail elderly and
182
people with ankle fracture, anklylosing spondylitis, oral submu-
183
cous fibrosis, post radiation therapy to the breast, post-radiation
184
therapy to the jaw, progressive systemic sclerosis, total knee
185
replacement, arthritis, Dupuytren’s contractures, shoulder adhe-
186
sive capsulitis/frozen shoulder, hallux limitus, wrist fracture and
187
burns. The standardised mean difference was 0.2 SD (95% CI 0.0 to
188
0.3, I2 = 27%, p = 0.06) (see Figure 4, see Figure 5 on the eAddenda
189
for a detailed forest plot). This translates to an absolute mean
190
increase of 1 deg (95% CI 0 to 2) when the results are back
191
converted using the largest, least biased and most representative
192
study of those included in the analysis.51 This is equivalent to a
193
relative change of 1% (95% CI 0 to 2). The GRADE quality of evidence
194
for this result was high.
195
Sub-group analyses
196
The dosage of stretch
197
Thirty seven studies with a total of 1519 participants measured
198
joint mobility in degrees, and provided sufficient data to estimate
199
the effect of mean total stretch time on joint mobility. 8–11,13,15,16,18–
200
20,22,25–27,29,30,33–36,38,39,41–54,56 As mean time data were skewed,
201
they were transformed by taking the natural logarithm of time.
202
Total stretch time was adjusted for the length of time between
203
randomisation and measurement, as well as the length of time
204
between the last stretch and measurement using multiple meta-
205
regression. The mean difference was 0 deg for each log hour
206
increase in total stretch time (95% CI –1 to 1, I2 = 31%, p = 0.119).
207
The way the stretch is administered
208
Thirty seven studies with a total of 1530 participants measured
209
joint mobility in degrees, and provided sufficient data to estimate
210
the effect of different stretch interventions on joint mobility. 8–
211
11,13,15,16,18–20,22,25–27,29,30,33–36,38,39,41–54,56 The overall effect of
212
administering stretch in five different ways was examined. This
213
included stretch administered with serial casting, positioning,
214
splinting, self-administration and other ways. The effect of stretch
215
on joint mobility was not influenced by the way stretch was
216
administered (test for subgroup differences; p = 0.33), although
217
these results need to be interpreted with caution because some
218
subgroups only included two studies.
219
Discussion
220
There is high-quality evidence that stretch does not have
221
clinically important effects on joint mobility. The pooled mean
222
treatment effect for neurological and non-neurological conditions
223
is 2 deg and 1 deg, respectively. These estimates are very precise,
224
with the upper end of the 95% CI spanning to 3 deg and 2 deg,
225
respectively. So unless readers consider a maximal possible
226
treatment effect of 3 deg to be clinically worthwhile, these results
227
conclusively indicate that stretch does not change joint mobility.
228
These findings are robust in most sensitivity and sub-group
229
analyses, and are based on the results of 36 studies involving
230
1414 participants. The participants included people with a range of
231
different diagnoses, including spinal cord injury, acquired brain
232
injury, stroke, ankylosing spondylitis, oral submucous fibrosis,
233
systemic sclerosis, ankle fracture and arthritis. The studies were
234
categorised and analysed on the basis of whether the underlying

 235
condition was neurological or non-neurological, to guard against
236
the possibility that the effectiveness of stretch differs depending
237
on the involvement of the nervous system. However, there was no
238
indication that this was the case. Nor was there any evidence that
239
the 
effects 
of 
stretch 
differed 
between 
different 
types 
of
240
neurological or non-neurological conditions. The only exception
241
was acquired brain injury. The point estimates for people with
242
acquired brain injury was very imprecise, failing to rule in or rule
243
out a clinically important treatment effect. These results therefore
244
need to be interpreted with caution.
245
There are two important caveats to our findings. Firstly, no
246
study administered stretch for > 7 months, with most studies
247
applying stretch for between 4 and 12 weeks. It is possible that the
248
effects of stretch accumulate over time. If this is the case, regular
249
stretching applied for many years as part of a home maintenance
250
program for people with spinal cord injury, stroke and other
251
similar conditions, may ultimately yield clinically important
252
effects on joint mobility. It is unfortunate that studies looking at
253
the effects of stretch administered for such periods of time are
254
unlikely to ever be conducted. For this reason, uncertainty will
255
remain about the worth of these sorts of stretching programs. The
256
second important caveat is that no study compared stretch, as
257
typically incorporated into routine nursing care, with nursing care
258
that did not incorporate stretch. The results of our review are
259
therefore potentially harmful if people extrapolate the findings to
260
mean that it is acceptable for semi-comatosed or paralysed
261
patients to lie flexed in bed with no attention to the position of
262
their limbs. We do not advocate this and do not believe that this is a
263
valid interpretation of our results.
264
This republication of the updated 2017 Cochrane Systematic
265
Review7 does not include the results of the other outcomes that
266
were investigated. These include quality of life, pain, activity
267
limitation, participation restriction, adverse events and spasticity.
268
However, in the updated 2017 Cochrane Systematic Review7 it was
269
concluded that it is uncertain whether stretch has clinically
270
important short-term effects on pain (standardised mean differ-
271
ence 0.2, 95% CI –0.1 to 0.5, five studies with 174 participants) or
272
activity limitations (standardised mean difference 0.2, 95% CI –0.1
273
to 0.5, eight studies with 247 participants) in people with
274
neurological conditions, and the effects of stretch on quality of
275
life or participation restrictions are unknown. The effects of stretch
276
in people with non-neurological conditions are somewhat clearer.
277
For example, there is high-quality evidence that stretch does not
278
have clinically important effects on pain (standardised mean
279
difference –0.2, 95% CI –0.4 to 0.1, seven studies with 422 parti-
280
cipants) and moderate quality evidence that stretch does not have
281
clinically important effects on quality of life (standardised mean
282
difference 0.3, 95% CI –0.1 to 0.7, two studies with 97 participants).
283
However, the effects of stretch on activity limitations and
284
participation restrictions in people with non-neurological condi-
285
tions are also uncertain. The long-term effects are either more
286
ambiguous or have not been investigated. There are some reports
287
of adverse events predominantly from studies that applied stretch
288
through splints or plaster casts. The adverse events included
289
numbness, pain, swelling, skin breakdown, bruising and blisters.
290
It is unlikely that further studies will change the results of this
291
review. There may, however, be value in examining the effects of
292
stretch administered with other interventions. For example,
293
stretch administered with motor training or botulinum toxin in
294
people with neurological conditions. There may also be worth in
295
specifically investigating the effectiveness of stretch administered
296
for extended periods of time (eg, years). In addition, there may be
297
value in further exploring the effectiveness of stretch for the
298
prevention of contracture, particularly in those at very high risk of
299
developing severe contracture (eg, people with traumatic brain
300
injury). For example, there is no way of knowing whether the
301
studies included in this review that claimed to include people at
302
risk of contracture included people who subsequently went on to
303
develop contracture. If those who are likely to develop severe
304
contracture could accurately be predicted, these individuals could
305
be selectively recruited to studies. However, it is proving more
306
difficult than commonly assumed to accurately predict those likely
307
to develop severe contractures.1,2
308
The results of this Cochrane Systematic Review are challenging
309
for the physiotherapy profession because they contradict a
310
fundamental assumption that physiotherapists have made for a
311
long time. Namely, that stretch is effective for the treatment and
312
prevention of contracture. However, the evidence is now compel-
313
ling that stretch does not have clinically meaningful effects on joint
314
mobility and that these results are robust to many different sub-
