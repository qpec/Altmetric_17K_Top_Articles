ABSTRACT
Background Previous research has estimated that wasted food in the United States
contains between 1,249 and 1,400 kcal per capita per day, but little is known about
amounts of other nutrients embedded in the 31% to 40% of food that is wasted.
Objective This research aimed to calculate the nutritional value of food wasted at the
retail and consumer levels in the US food supply, and contextualize the amount of
nutrient loss in terms of gaps between current and recommended intakes and esti-
mated food recovery potential.
Design Data from the National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference were used to
calculate the nutritional value of retail- and consumer-level waste of 213 commodities
in the US Department of Agriculture Loss-Adjusted Food Availability data series for 27
nutrients in 2012.
Results Food wasted at the retail and consumer levels of the US food supply in 2012
contained 1,217 kcal, 33 g protein, 5.9 g dietary fiber, 1.7 mg vitamin D, 286 mg calcium,
and 880 mg potassium per capita per day. Using dietary fiber as an example, 5.9 g di-
etary fiber is 23% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance for women. This is equivalent
to the fiber Recommended Dietary Allowance for 74 million adult women. Adult women
in 2012 underconsumed dietary fiber by 8.9 g/day, and the amount of wasted fiber is
equivalent to this gap for 206.6 million adult women.
Conclusions This was the first study to document the loss of nutrients from wasted
food in the US food supply, to our knowledge. Although only a portion of discarded food
can realistically be made available for human consumption, efforts to redistribute sur-
plus foods where appropriate and prevent food waste in the first place could increase
the availability of nutrients for Americans, while saving money and natural resources.

N THE UNITED STATES, BETWEEN 31% AND 40% OF THE
food supply is wasted before it reaches consumers.1,2
Policies and interventions to reduce waste and redirect
surplus food can reduce food costs, benefit the envi-
ronment, and improve food security.3-6 As described in a
recent report from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics,
nutrition and dietetics practitioners have an important role to
play in addressing this waste while advancing nutrition, such
as promoting consumer behavior change through nutrition
education.7 In this article, “nutrient loss” refers to the
nutrient content embedded within food loss and waste.
Although the terms “food loss,” “food waste” and “wasted
food” are sometimes used interchangeably, in this article
“wasted food” is primarily used.*
Tracking Caloric and Nutrient Losses
Most research efforts to quantify wasted food have focused
on food weight or economic value, or on waste as a propor-
tion of available food by supply chain level.8-11 The few
studies examining nutritional value have focused primarily
on calories. For example, Buzby and colleagues1 linked US
Department of Agriculture (USDA) data with underlying loss
assumptions, estimating that retail- and consumer-level food
loss in 2010 was equivalent to 1,249 kcal per capita per day.
Hall and colleagues2 estimated that food loss and waste
across the US supply chain accounted for approximately
1,400 kcal per person per day in 2003. This estimate repre-
sented the difference between food available to the US pop-
ulation (according to Food and Agriculture Organization food
balance sheets) and average caloric intake, using a mathe-
matical
model
incorporating
energy
requirements,
de-
mographic distribution, and dietary intake data from the
National
Health
and
Nutrition
Examination
Survey
(NHANES). Kummu and colleagues4 also used Food and
Agriculture Organization food balance sheet data, together
*In this article, “wasted food” (verb-noun) is used pri-
marily because it emphasizes that an action, waste, is being
done to a product, food. By contrast, “food waste” (adjective-
noun) treats food as a type of waste, which is an unappe-
tizing frame when food recovery is part of the goal.

 with other country-level data, to estimate 1,334 kcal per
person per day embedded in food loss and waste in North
America and Oceania.
Focusing on only the caloric value of wasted food may
overrepresent the influence of calorie-dense foods, losing
sight of other nutrients that are wasted.12 Nutrient-dense
foods such as vegetables, fruits, seafood, and dairy products
are wasted at disproportionately high rates,1,13 suggesting
that wasted food may have a substantial influence on the
supply of micronutrients.14 To our knowledge, only two
published studies have examined the nutrient content of
wasted food beyond calories. Love and colleagues15 estimated
the calorie, protein, and eicosapentaenoic and docosahexae-
noic acid content in the 40% to 47% of seafood that is lost in
the United States. A project funded by the European Com-
mission Framework Programme examined waste of nine in-
dicator food products (apples, tomatoes, potatoes, bread,
milk, beef, pork, chicken, and whitefish) in European Union
member countries, reporting substantial losses of vitamin A,
beta carotene, vitamin C, fiber, iron, zinc, n-3 fatty acids,
lysine, and methionine.16 Still absent from the literature is a
broad quantification of nutrient losses across the US food
supply.
Such an examination is feasible through publicly available
data sources. The USDA Food Availability data series tracks
more than 200 commodities, taking into account quantities
produced and imported, and subtracting food used for
nonfood purposes (eg, exports and farm inputs).17 The Loss-
Adjusted Food Availability (LAFA) data series further refines
the amount of food available for human consumption by
excluding nonedible food portions and food losses occurring
at the primary (ie, farm or producer), retail, and consumer
levels.18 These losses include cooking loss, spoilage, food
discarded due to aesthetic standards, and consumer plate
waste. The USDA also maintains the Nutrient Availability data
series, which includes data on the availability of 27 nutrients
and food components based on the Food Availability data
series.19 No such nutrient data exist for the LAFA data series,
so current figures overestimate nutrient availability in the
food supply because they include the nutrient content of 133
billion pounds of food loss unavailable for human consump-
tion.1 This study aimed to estimate the nutrient content of
those discarded foods, thereby providing the first quantifi-
cation of a comprehensive set of nutrients wasted at the retail
and consumer levels of the US food supply.
Gaps in Dietary Intake and Potential for Food
Recovery
Wasted
food
coexists
with
widespread
need.
Fourteen
percent of US households were food insecure in 2014,
meaning they struggled to provide food at some point in the
year, whereas 5.6% had very low food security, meaning lack
of resources led to disrupted eating patterns such as skipped
meals or reduced overall intake.20 In addition to food quan-
tity, nutritional quality is also important, and certain micro-
nutrients are consumed at levels below the Estimated
Average Requirement (EAR) or Adequate Intake (AI) levels at
a population level. The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans (DGA) reported that these underconsumed nutri-
ents include dietary fiber; calcium; choline; magnesium;
potassium; and vitamins A, C, D, and E for all population
groups and iron for adolescent girls and women of repro-
ductive age.21 The DGA identified a subset—dietary fiber,
calcium, potassium, and vitamin D—as “nutrients of public
health concern” due to the health consequences that can
result from underconsumption.21
It is neither practical nor desirable to divert all wasted food
to anti-hunger efforts or to helping Americans obtain needed
nutrients. The US Environmental Protection Agency describes
a food recovery hierarchy in which the top priority is waste
prevention, followed by feeding the food to those who are
hungry (food recovery), feeding it to animals, diverting food
toward industrial uses, and composting, with discarding food
in a landfill as a last resort.22 A report by Rethink Food Waste
Through Economics and Data (ReFED), a collaboration of
business, nonprofit, philanthropic, and government leaders,
estimated that annually in the United States, 1.7 million tons
of food are recovered for distribution to those in need, but
still 52.4 million tons are discarded in landfills and 10.1
million tons are left in farm fields, totaling 62.5 million
tons.23 ReFED estimated that 20% of this discarded food could
be diverted from landfills by implementing a set of cost-
effective activities with three goals: food recovery, com-
posting, and waste prevention. These activities can contribute
to the goal set by the USDA and the Environmental Protection
Agency to halve US food loss and waste by 2030.24
Purpose and Research Questions
This study aimed to estimate the amount of nutrient loss, on
a per capita per day basis, in the US food supply during 2012.
To provide context, the nutrient loss is expressed relative to
recommended intakes, gaps between recommended and
mean current intakes, and estimates of the amount of food
that could be recovered. The resultant nutrient loss estimates
illustrate how waste of food represents a loss to food security,
nutrition, and the broader society. They can thus help justify
investments in food recovery and prevention, and support
the case for engagement by registered dietitian nutritionists
in these efforts. These estimates can also serve as a baseline
to measure progress toward waste reduction and recovery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources
Two USDA data sources were used for the primary analysis:
the LAFA data series18 was used for estimates of food avail-
ability and loss, and the National Nutrient Database For
Standard Reference, Release 28 (US Department of Agricul-
ture, Agricultural Research Service Nutrient Data Laboratory)
(SR-28) was used to obtain nutrient composition data for
each commodity in the LAFA data series. The LAFA data series
provides estimates for the availability of 213 commodities
(pounds per capita per year) and percentages of food loss at
the primary, retail, and consumer levels annually from 1974
to 2012. Estimates from 2012 were used except for nine foods
(primarily fats and oils) for which data were unavailable; for
those, the most recent estimates were used. Although the
data series does not include every food available for con-
sumption in the United States—for example, it includes kale
and collard greens, but not Swiss chard—it forms the most
comprehensive representation of the US food supply for
which data on food loss are currently available. Consistent
with the methods presented by Buzby and colleagues,1 this

 analysis excluded nonedible portions of food and focused
only on the retail and consumer levels due to inconsistent
data availability at the primary level.
Additional
data
sources,
described
below,
included
NHANES What We Eat in America,25 the Dietary Reference
Intakes,26 and US Census Bureau estimates of population size
for the 2012 midpoint (ie, July 1).27
Calculations of Nutrient Loss
For each commodity in the LAFA data series, a representative
food or an average of representative foods was matched from
the SR-28 database, resulting in 290 SR-28 food codes.1,28 For
example, butter was represented by the average of: “01001:
butter, salted” and “01145: butter, without salt.”1,28 The
choice of codes was based on previous USDA research efforts
described in Table 1 (available online at www.andjrnl.org),
which also contains the full codebook and detailed rationale.
For each selection, nutrient composition was obtained from
SR-28 for a standardized 100-g unit of food.
A detailed explanation of all calculations appears in Table 2
(available online at www.andjrnl.org). Because the analysis
was restricted to the retail and consumer levels due to the
unavailability of consistent data at the primary level, calcu-
lations were performed to isolate annual per capita waste at
the retail and consumer levels for each of the commodities,
thereby excluding waste at the primary level or from
nonedible
portions.
Subsequently,
the
amount
of
each
nutrient present in this amount of waste was calculated, and
amounts were summed by nutrient to estimate nutrient loss
per capita per year resulting from the waste of all 213 com-
modities. To estimate losses on a per capita per day basis,
nutrient loss per capita per year was divided by 365. To es-
timate losses on a per population per day basis, nutrient loss
per capita per day was multiplied by the 2012 total popula-
tion size (313,914,040) as specified by the US Census Bu-
reau.27 In some calculations, the 2012 adult population size
(226,456,000) was used to relate the amount of nutrient loss
per population per day to the amount of nutrients that would
be recommended for adults in the population.
Calculations to Compare Nutrient Loss to
Dietary Intake
To contextualize nutrient loss, gaps between current and
recommended dietary intakes were calculated. Mean current
nutrient intakes were obtained from What We Eat in America,
the dietary interview component of the NHANES 2011-2012
survey, on usual dietary intakes for adults aged 20 years and
older.29 NHANES data are gathered from 24-hour dietary re-
calls and are a useful indicator of consumption, given that the
USDA Food Availability and LAFA data series reflect food
availability and losses but not dietary consumption. Recom-
mended intakes are also presented, based on the Recom-
mended Dietary Allowance (RDA) or the AI. The RDA is the
level of daily nutrient intake that will meet the needs of 97.5%
of healthy individuals, and it is set at two standard deviations
above the EAR, the intake level that will meet the needs of 50%
of healthy individuals.26 The AI is an observed or experi-
mentally derived analog of the RDA used for nutrients for
which it is not feasible to determine the EAR. All values pre-
sented for the RDA and AI are the most recent estimates from
the Dietary Reference Intakes from the Institute of Medicine.30
For recommended intakes, “adult” refers to the RDA or AI for
the age group 19 to 30 years; for many nutrients, the recom-
mendations for this age group are equivalent to the recom-
mendations for the 31 to 50 years and 51 to 70 years age
groups. For energy, 2,000 kcal/day was used as the recom-
mended intake for both men and women, although actual
needs depend on height, weight, and physical activity.26
For underconsumed nutrients, gaps in dietary consumption
were calculated, defined as the difference between mean
current intakes and recommended intakes. Although the DGA
defines underconsumed nutrients in relation to the EAR,21
this analysis used the RDA because the RDA is intended for
recommendations at the individual level. In addition, given
that the RDA is higher than the EAR by two standard de-
viations,26 the RDA provides a more conservative estimate of
the potential influence of food loss on nutrient availability (ie,
a given amount of nutrients can provide more people with
the EAR than it can the RDA).
Calculations were also performed to estimate the nutritional
value that could be recovered if the US were to achieve the
potential for food recovery suggested by ReFED’s analysis.
ReFED aggregated multiple primary and secondary data
sources including expert interviews, estimating that currently
only 1.7 million tons (2.7%) of wasted food are recovered.23
ReFED projected that a maximum of 5.8 million additional
tons of food per year (9.2% of the estimated amount currently
wasted) could feasibly be made available for human con-
sumption through recovery efforts over the next 10 years, and
that 1.1 million additional tons of food per year (1.75% of the
estimated amount wasted) could be recovered over the next 10
years by scaling up only the top seven most cost-effective food
recovery activities. As such, 1.75% and 9.21% were used as the
boundaries for this set of calculations.
Data Management and Ethical Approval
The above-described methods are depicted graphically in
Figure 1. Data from the LAFA data series and SR-28 were
downloaded and compiled into spreadsheets in Microsoft
Excel (Microsoft Corp) for calculations. Nutrient composition
data for each food were stored in a separate file, and a
MATLAB script31 was developed to compile data from all 290
SR-28 food codes in a single Excel spreadsheet. For all data
that were transferred from one file to another, a 5% sub-
sample was double checked by a second author, and dis-
crepancies were resolved by referring to the original data
sets. This research was reviewed and classified as exempt by
the institutional review board at the Johns Hopkins Bloom-
berg School of Public Health because all data were derived
from existing, publicly available sources and no original
research involving human subjects was conducted.
RESULTS
Magnitude of Nutrient Loss in the US Food Supply
Table 3 shows the nutritional value embedded in the retail
and consumer level waste of 213 commodities in the US food
supply during 2012. Wasted food at the retail and consumer
levels contained an average of 1,217 kcal, 146 g carbohydrates,
33 g protein, 57 g total fat, 5.9 g dietary fiber, 1.7 mg vitamin D,
286 mg calcium, and 880 mg potassium per capita per day.
Quantities for additional wasted nutrients are shown in

 Table 3. Nutrients such as trans fats, for which data were not
consistently available for all commodities, are not reported.
Table 4 (available online at www.andjrnl.org) presents the
percentage contribution from the retail and the consumerlevels.
For all nutrients presented except polyunsaturated fat and
vitamin K, the majority of loss occurred at the consumer level.
Tables 5, 6, and 7 (all available online at www.andjrnl.org)
show the percentage contribution of nutrient loss from
various food groups, illustrating that some food groups
contributed an especially large proportion of wasted nutri-
ents. For example, retail- and consumer-level waste of meat,
poultry, and fish accounted for a substantial portion of the
loss of vitamin B-12 (50% of the total loss), zinc (47%), protein
(46%), niacin (42%), vitamin B-6 (42%), and cholesterol (40%).
Added fats and oils accounted for 63% of the loss of vitamin E
across the food supply. Looking to nutrients of public health
concern, loss of dietary fiber was due primarily to waste of
grains (39%), vegetables (34%), and fruits (22%). Loss of cal-
cium was due primarily to waste of dairy (72%) and, to a
lesser extent, vegetables (10%). Loss of vitamin D was
accounted for primarily by waste of dairy (53%); meat,
poultry, and fish (27%); and eggs (15%).
Comparison of Nutrient Loss to Gaps in
Dietary Intake
For macronutrients, underconsumed nutrients, and nutrients
of public health concern, the amount of nutrient loss from
Table 3 is contextualized in Table 8 as the equivalent number
of adult women and men for whom the gap between actual
and recommended intakes could be filled and the recom-
mended intakes (eg, RDA or AI) could be provided. Similar
estimates are provided for an additional 14 nutrients in Table 9
(available online at www.andjrnl.org). These estimates are
provided for context, recognizing that not all wasted food can
feasibly be recovered for human consumption. To use dietary
fiber as an example, on an average day in 2012, waste of 213
commodities at the retail and consumer levels contained 5.9 g
dietary fiber per capita, equivalent to upward of 1.8 billion g
dietary fiber across the 2012 US population (not shown in
Table 8). Adult women and men in 2012 consumed an average
of 8.9 and 17.7 g less than the recommended intake of dietary
fiber per day, respectively; 1.8 billion g dietary fiber equals the
gap between actual and recommended intakes for upward of
206.6 million adult women or 103.9 million adult men.
Alternatively, 1.8 billion g dietary fiber is equivalent to the full
RDA for dietary fiber for 73.6 million adult women or 48.4
adult men each day, equivalent to 27% of the US adult popu-
lation, taking the average of the proportions for women and
men, as shown in Figure 2. Table 10 (available online at www.
andjrnl.org) provides supporting information for Figure 2,
including additional nutrients, the proportions for women
and men separately, and the contributions from the retail and
consumer levels separately.
For underconsumed nutrients, Figure 3 depicts the amount
of loss in terms of the percentage of recommended intake.

 For example, waste of 213 commodities at the retail and
consumer levels in 2012 contained dietary fiber (5.9 g per
capita per day) equivalent to 23% of the RDA for women or
15% of the RDA for men, averaging to 19%. Table 11 (available
online at www.andjrnl.org) provides supporting information
for Figure 3, including additional nutrients, the proportions
for women and men separately, and the contributions from
the retail and consumer levels separately.
Table 12 (available online at www.andjrnl.org) shows the
results of the calculations to estimate the nutritional value
that could be recovered if the United States were to achieve
the potential for food recovery suggested by ReFED’s analysis.
If food were recovered in the same proportions as it were
wasted, scaling up the top seven most cost-effective food
recovery activities over the next 10 years (resulting in
recovering 1.75% of food currently wasted), this would
translate into 2,000 kcal per day for 3.3 million adults.
Looking to nutrients of public health concern, at this rate the
recovered food would be equivalent to the calcium RDA for
1.6 million adult women or men, the potassium RDA for 1.0
million adult women or men, the dietary fiber RDA for 1.3
million adult women or 0.8 million adult men, and the
vitamin D RDA for 0.6 million adult women or men. If some
food recovery interventions were included that were not
highly cost-effective, the estimated maximum recoverable
amount of food (9.21% of food currently wasted) would
translate into 2,000 kcal per day for 17.6 million adults.
DISCUSSION
US landfills represent vast repositories of lost nutrition. In
2012, enough food was discarded at the retail and consumer
levels alone to provide 2,000 kcal per day to 84% of the US
adult population. Reducing waste of food may be particularly
beneficial for the availability of nutrients currently under-
consumed in the United States. Although only a portion of
this nutritional value can be recovered for human con-
sumption, the magnitude of loss and the associated lost
money and resources mean there is great opportunity in
focusing on that effort. Quantifying the loss can motivate
related investments and support the case for engagement by
registered dietitian nutritionists with these efforts. The esti-
mates can also serve as a baseline for tracking the influence
of interventions.
The DGA emphasize the benefit of a whole-diet perspective
for promoting good eating patterns, rather than focusing too
heavily
on
component
nutrients.21
Yet,
underlying
the
desirability of some dietary patterns over others is the ability
to obtain a variety of nutrients in sufficient quantities. By
breaking down wasted foods into their nutritional compo-
nents, findings can be better compared to specific nutrient
requirements. Losses of underconsumed nutrients were
striking. For example, at the retail and consumer levels alone,
discarded food contained enough dietary fiber to fill the gap
between actual and recommended intake for 206.6 million
women or 103.9 million men. Adequate fiber intake is
inversely associated with chronic disease, and the Academy
of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends consuming fiber in its
food form (as opposed to dietary supplements),32 which re-
inforces the importance of preventing waste of the food
sources of nutrients.
Perishable foods such as fruits and vegetables are lost at
particularly high rates, leading to exceptional losses of
underconsumed nutrients. More broadly, there was consid-
erable variation in the food groups contributing to losses for
each nutrient. For example, for vitamin D, dairy was the
greatest contributor, whereas for fiber it was grains, vegeta-
bles, and fruit, and for vitamin E it was fats and oils.
For all nutrients presented except polyunsaturated fat and
vitamin K, losses were estimated to be higher at the con-
sumer level than the retail level, potentially reflecting food

 perishability over time, among other factors. The substantial
amount of nutrient loss at the consumer level points to the
need for interventions targeted toward consumers. ReFED
highlighted two consumer oriented interventions— stan-
dardized date labeling and consumer education—as being
particularly cost effective.23 In the United Kingdom, a broad
suite of interventions including policy, retailers, and con-
sumer behavior change communication contributed to a 21%
reduction in household food waste between 2007 and 2012.13
Specific strategies to reduce food waste in the household
have been described elsewhere.33
These findings should not be interpreted as implying that
all lost nutrient content could be recovered and fed to people,
nor that the food that could be feasibly recovered would
necessarily result in a palatable or nutritious diet. Some food
will inevitably be discarded. Food safety concerns are para-
mount, and protecting food safety can mean setting stringent
standards that err on the discard side. In addition, some
logistical challenges of perishability, transportation, storage,
and timing cannot be addressed in a cost-effective manner.
Only a portion of waste can be prevented through retail and
restaurant strategies such as improved prediction of con-
sumer demand, or food packages and portion sizes targeted
to consumption patterns and nutrition needs. Cultural shifts
are also needed, although they cannot eliminate all waste.
These include changing consumer preferences for aestheti-
cally perfect produce, and making it acceptable for stores,
restaurants, and homes to occasionally run out of items
rather than always providing food in abundance. In addition,
food that reaches the consumer level generally cannot be
recovered unless it is nonperishable and remains in sealed
packaging. Finally, not all food meets standards of quality or
social acceptability for human consumption. The Environ-
mental Protection Agency Food Recovery Hierarchy indicates
three uses for such food that are superior to landfilling:
feeding
animals,
industrial
uses,
and
composting.22
Regarding food items that may be perceived as lesser
value—such as misshapen or damaged produce, socially un-
desirable food products, food in damaged packaging, and
food that is older but still safe—consuming these foods and
purchasing them at discount prices may become more
normalized as food waste interventions spread, thereby
reducing stigma and increasing use of such foods across the
population. Efforts to enhance food recovery should incor-
porate ethical considerations regarding cultural preferences
and foodways, measures of perceived and objective quality,
and product diversity.
These findings demonstrate that even if only an additional
1.75% of wasted food were recovered for human consumption
(based on ReFED’s estimate), substantial nutritional value
would be made available. According to ReFED, the three most
cost-effective measures for increasing food recovery are
donation tax incentives, standardized donation regulations
(eg, local and state food safety laws), and improved donation
matching software.23 The nature of these measures suggests
that improved recovery requires multifaceted efforts from
government and industry stakeholders.

each day in 2012 contained an amount of calcium equivalent
to 29% of the calcium RDA for adult women and men (age 19

between the equivalent percentage of the adult women’s

bThe RDA for iron differs greatly between men and women;
daily per capita iron loss in the US food supply is equivalent to
30% of the adult women’s RDA and 66% of the adult men’s
RDA, which averages to 48%. For other nutrients shown, dif-
ferences between the RDA for men and women were not as
large.

 Although recovering surplus food plays an
essential
mitigation role by filling nutrition gaps while diverting food
from landfills, it does not address the root causes of food
insecurity, malnutrition, or wasted food. To address food
insecurity, it would be preferable to reduce the need for food
donations in the first place. To address underconsumption of
key nutrients, food recovery may improve affordability, but
demand creation remains a critical gap. From a food waste
perspective, a more preferable way of reducing the resource
loss inherent in waste is to work toward matching produc-
tion to consumer demand and minimizing surplus and
waste in the first place, rather than finding alternate uses for
wasted food.
Comparison to Similar Studies
The estimate of 1,217 kcal wasted per capita per day in 2012
from this analysis differed by only 3% from the estimate by
Buzby and colleagues1 of 1,249 kcal per capita per day in
2010. This discrepancy is likely due to food supply changes
and minor methodologic differences; for example, Buzby and
colleagues1 calculated caloric value by using food pattern
equivalents (previously known as servings), whereas this
analysis used weight. A side-by-side comparison of caloric
value by food group from both studies is presented in
Table 13 (available online at www.andjrnl.org).
Two additional studies did not limit their analyses to the
retail and consumer levels, but included the entire food
supply chain. The estimate of calories wasted per capita
per day from this analysis was 15% lower than the estimate
from Hall and colleagues2 (1,400 kcal), which is to be ex-
pected due to this different scope plus major methodologic
differences. Love and colleagues15 provided low and high
estimates of the per capita per day caloric value of wasted
seafood (9.6 to 11.2 kcal [calculation by the authors]),
which is 37% to 60% higher than the estimate of 7 kcal from
the seafood group from this analysis. Love and colleagues15
also estimated protein losses in seafood waste at 1.8 to 1.9
g per capita per day (calculation by the authors), which is
31% to 37% higher than the estimate of 1.4 g per capita per
day from the seafood group from our analysis. The differ-
ence may be because Love and colleagues15 included the
full seafood supply chain and used multiple data sources
specifically intended to avoid underestimation of seafood
loss.
Limitations and Strengths
This analysis is subject to the limitations of its primary data
sources. Limitations in the LAFA data series include under-
lying loss assumptions that may not be sensitive to changes
across time (eg, changes in food processing methods may
change the amount of food discarded).18 In addition, the LAFA
data from 2012 do not include more recent estimates of
wholesale and retail loss indicating that fresh fruit and
vegetable losses may be 4.3% and 1% higher, respectively.34
In addition to limitations in the underlying food loss data,
there are challenges specific to estimating nutrient loss.
Nutrient composition varies within and across food cate-
gories, and across cultivars; this analysis was based on 290
SR-28 food codes representing 213 commodity food groups,
and was thus unable to capture all foods and cultivars. The
selected SR-28 codes generally corresponded to raw foods
(eg, raw beans instead of cooked beans), although the actual
nutritional value of wasted food may differ according to its
state at the time of discard. Another challenge is that food
may lose nutritional value as it deteriorates.35 Some food
waste recovery efforts may involve collecting food that has
become less fresh, particularly when the intent is to process
the food. That said, food that is wasted is not necessarily
inferior; for example, apples with scabs—which may be more
likely to be discarded due to aesthetic standards, or to not be
harvested at all—may have higher levels of phenolic com-
pounds.36 In addition, this analysis did not differentiate be-
tween nutrition content of food recovered directly from
farms (likely to consist primarily of fruits and vegetables) and
food recovered from nonfarm donations (likely to consist of
additional food groups). For context, it has been estimated
that 27% of recovered food comes from farms.23
A limitation of the calculations based on the ReFED analysis
is that the ReFED estimates of food recovery potential were
based on the entire supply chain, which poses a challenge for
comparing the results to estimates of nutrient loss at the
retail and consumer levels only. It should be emphasized that
these estimates are for illustrative purposes and are not exact
projections of the potential for food recovery and its influ-
ence on nutrition.
A key strength of this research is that it presents the first
estimate of the loss of a comprehensive set of nutrients
across commodities that represent the US food supply. This
analysis allows for a nuanced view of nutrient loss, including
proportions of loss by food group and by supply chain level.
In addition, the research is built on the USDA’s most current
estimates of food losses at the retail and consumer levels,
which allow for the exclusion of inedible components of food.
The codebook was developed based on similar research ef-
forts, for improved comparability to previous studies.1,28 The
findings demonstrate consistency with similar studies, with
an estimate of caloric waste within 3% of the estimate Buzby
and colleagues1 reached using similar methods. This study
also placed nutrient loss within the context of under-
consumed nutrients and nutrients of public health concern.
Researchers have called for better national-level metrics of
nutrient quality as a dimension of food security, and this
study has broad significance as a demonstration of how the
magnitude of nutrient loss can be calculated at a national
level.37
CONCLUSIONS
This study is the first to demonstrate the substantial
amount of nutrients, including many underconsumed nu-
trients, wasted due to food discarded at the retail and
consumer levels of the US food supply. Although only a
portion of discarded food can realistically be made available
for human consumption, efforts to redistribute surplus
foods where appropriate and prevent food waste in the first
place could increase the availability of nutrients for Amer-
icans while saving money and natural resources. The United
States has established a target of halving food loss and
waste by 2030. This research supports the case for action
and for registered dietitian nutritionists bringing their
expertise to the effort.

PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS
What Is the Current Knowledge on this Topic?
Although previous research has shown that that 31% to
40% of food in the United States is wasted before it reaches
consumers and that this waste contains between 1,249
and 1,400 kcal per capita per day, little is known about the
composition of other nutrients embedded in wasted food.
How Does the Current Research Add to
Knowledge on this Topic?
Food wasted at the retail and consumer levels in the US
food supply in 2012 contained 1,217 kcal, 33 g protein, 5.9
g dietary fiber, 1.7 mg vitamin D, 286 mg calcium, and 880
mg potassium per capita per day. Many nutrients that are
currently
consumed
below
recommended
levels
are
wasted in substantial amounts.
How Might this Knowledge Influence Current
Dietetics Practice?
Educational messages about shopping, food preparation,
food storage, and portion sizes can incorporate strategies
to reduce food waste. For example, recommendations to
consume fruits and vegetables can include frozen and
canned foods, which are less perishable than fresh pro-
duce.
Reducing
food
waste
benefits
consumers
by
reducing food costs and minimizing the loss of important
nutrients.

aThe table contains the codebook that matches the commodities identified in the LAFA data series to food items in SR-28. The LAFA data series contains estimates of retail and consumer
level loss for 213 commodities The LAFA data series contains 215 commodities. This study uses the data from 213 commodities, because two of the commodities (1. white and whole wheat
flour and 2. durum flour) duplicate the values contained in the commodity “wheat flour.”
bThis column identifies the following methods of selecting codes:
1.
This SR-28 code matches the code used by Kantor.28
2.
This SR-28 code matches the code used by Buzby and colleagues1 because Kantor28 did not contain a code for this commodity, or contained a code that was not the closest match to
the LAFA commodity, or contained a code that was no longer available in SR-28.
3.
This SR-28 code was selected by the authors as the closest match to the LAFA commodity because Kantor28 and Buzby and colleagues1 did not contain a code for this commodity.
4.
This SR-28 code was selected by the authors as the closest match to the LAFA commodity, even though Kantor28 or Buzby and colleagues1 used a different code for this commodity.
Reasons for selecting a code that differed from Kantor28 or Buzby and colleagues1 included preferences for certain characteristics such as raw or cooked commodities, or the availability
of codes with more comprehensive information on nutrient composition.
When calculations from Kantor28 or Buzby and colleagues1 did not contain a code for a commodity, or when that code was not the closest match to the LAFA commodity, the authors used the
following general preferences:
�
Vegetables: Raw options were selected whenever possible, under the assumption that most discarded food at the retail and consumer levels (more so at the retail level) is likely to be
raw.
�
Fruit: Unsweetened options were selected whenever possible. As such, the nutrient totals are likely to underestimate the loss of sugar and carbohydrates.
�
Fish: Kantor28 and Buzby and colleagues1 used SR-28 codes for cooked fish. In this study, SR-28 codes for cooked fish were used, except when the codes for cooked fish did not contain
comprehensive information on nutrient composition; in these cases, when the codes for raw fish contained more comprehensive information, the codes for raw fish were used.
cThe most recent data were from before 2012. In most of these cases, the most recent data were from 2010.

 Table 2. Example calculation of nutrient loss for estimating the amount of per capita per day nutrient loss of 213 commodities at the retail and consumer levels of the US
food supply in 2012
An example calculation for one nutrient (in this case, protein) for one food (in this case, eggs):
Step 1: How much protein is contained in a standardized unit of egg?
According to the National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference e Release 28 (SR-28; US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service Nutrient Data
Laboratory), for the code 01129 (which refers to “Egg, whole, cooked, hard-boiled”), 100 g egg contains 12.58 g protein.
Step 2: How much egg is lost at the retail and consumer levels?

The above table provides the percentage of weight that is lost from one stage to the next, but it does not isolate the amount that is lost at any particular stage. In other
words, the table shows how much weight is lost from the primary to the retail level, but it does not show how much of the total loss is due to loss at the retail level only.
The stages that are of interest to this study are:
�
The loss that occurs from the retail to the consumer level, and
�
The loss that occurs at the consumer level from cooking loss and uneaten food, referred to here as “edible consumer loss.”
When combined, the loss at these two stages comprises the “retail- and consumer-level loss” that is the subject of the study’s main research question.
The stages that do not need to be included for this study are:
�
The loss that occurs from the primary to the retail level. This data was not used in the analysis by Buzby and colleagues1 because the data were not consistently
available for all 213 commodities, and
�
The loss that occurs at the consumer level from the non-edible portion. This loss does not reflect preventable food waste and is therefore not relevant to the
research question. Note that the US Department of Agriculture conceptualizes all loss from nonedible portions as occurring at the consumer level.
Using the information from the LAFA data series, the following calculations were used to isolate the loss from the retail to the consumer level and the loss at the edible
consumer level. In the following example calculations, all numbers that come directly from the LAFA data series are in boldface type; all other numbers are the result of
calculations performed by the authors.
According to the 2012 LAFA data series, the primary weight per capita of egg was 32.65 lb/y, before accounting for any food loss.

Of the 10.45 lb lost at the consumer level only, we separated the proportions of loss from the nonedible portion and edible portion, as shown below:

¼ 6:87 lb lost as the edible portion of the consumer level
The above calculations demonstrate that for every 32.65 lb eggs available per capita per year in the US food supply in 2012, there was a total of 10.45 lb of loss from all
levels of the supply chain, leaving 19.02 pounds available. A summary of these calculations is shown in the table below.

food supply in 2012 (continued)
Step 3: How much protein is contained in the amount of egg lost at the retail- and consumer-levels?
The 9.62 lb egg loss per capita per year calculated in Step 2 was first converted into grams:
Grams of egg loss at the retail and consumer ðedibleÞ levels; per capita per year ¼ Pounds of egg loss at the retail and consumer ðedibleÞ levels � 453:592 g=lb
¼ 9:62 lb � 453:592 g=lb
¼ 4365:69 g egg loss per capita per year
We then converted the number of grams of egg loss per capita per year into the number of 100-g units, so that it would be comparable to Step 1 (in which we calculated
the number of grams of protein in a standardized 100-g unit of eggs):
Number of 100�g units of egg loss at the retail and consumer ðedibleÞ levels; per capita per year ¼ Grams of egg loss at the retail and consumer ðedibleÞ levels O100
¼ 4365:69 gO100
¼ 43:66 100�g units of egg loss per capita per year
If 43.66 100-g units of egg are lost at the retail- and consumer-levels per capita per year, and if a 100-gunit of egg contains 12.58 g protein, then there are 549.24 g protein
embedded in the amount of egg lost at the retail and consumer levels, per capita per year:
Grams of protein embedded in the amount of egg loss at the retail and consumer ðedibleÞ levels; per capita per year ¼ 100 � g units of egg loss per capita per year �
grams of protein per 100 g egg
¼ 43:66 100g units � 12:58 g protein per 100 g egg
¼ 549:24 g protein
Flow of work
Steps 1, 2, and 3 were performed for each of 213 commodities and for each of 27 nutrients. Amounts of loss were summed by nutrient to produce estimates of the
amount of nutrients lost across all 213 commodities at the retail- and consumer-levels (edible portion only), per capita per year. Per capita per year estimates were
divided by 365 to produce the per capita per day estimates that appear in Table 1 (available online at www.andjrnl.org).

aColumn percentages may not add to 100%, due to rounding.
bThe numerical values are per capita per day amounts of nutrients embedded in the waste of commodities at the retail and consumer levels in the US food supply in 2012.
cThe percentage values represent the proportion of all loss for each nutrient that can be attributed to each food group.
dExample interpretation: of the 35.4 mg vitamin C per capita per day embedded in food loss in the US food supply, 51% of those milligrams come from fruit and 48% come from vegetables.
eAdded sweeteners is used here as a category for classification, and may not match other definitions for added sweeteners such as that used in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.

aThis Table expresses the results from Table 3 in relation to the gap between current and recommended intakes.
bRDA¼Recommended Dietary Allowance.
cAI¼Adequate Intake.
dGap in dietary intake¼recommended intake e mean current intake.
eMillions of adults equivalent to the gap in dietary intake was calculated as the daily loss per population divided by the gap in dietary intake. The daily loss per population was calculated as
the daily loss per capita (from Table 3) multiplied by the size of total US population on July 1, 2012 (313,914,040).
fMillions of adults equivalent to the recommended intake was calculated as the daily loss per population divided by the recommended intake.
gCells with no values indicate either that there was no RDA for this nutrient, or that the the gap between current and recommended intakes was not calculated because mean current
intake exceeded recommended intakes.

 Table 12. Nutrient loss adjusted for the proportions of food that could be recovered, as estimated by the Rethink Food Waste through Economics and Data (ReFED)
collaboration
Step 1: Extracting proportions from ReFED report23
The maximum feasible amount of recovery: ReFED estimated the maximum feasible amount of recovery as 5.8 million tons of food per year, which is 9.21% of the 63 million tons of
food currently wasted each year. (5.8 million/63 million¼9.2%)
The amount of recovery possible by scaling up seven cost-effective activities: ReFED estimated that scaling up seven cost-effective strategies for food recovery could result in an
additional 1.1 million tons of food recovered per year, which is 1.75% of the 63 million tons of food currently wasted each year. (1.1 million/63 million¼1.75%)
