ABSTRACT
Background Cadence (steps/min) may be a reasonable 
proxy-indicator of ambulatory intensity. A summary of 
current evidence is needed for cadence-based metrics 
supporting benchmark (standard or point of reference) 
and threshold (minimums associated with desired 
outcomes) values that are informed by a systematic 
process.
Objective To review how fast, in terms of cadence, 
is enough, with reference to crafting public health 
recommendations in adults.
Methods A comprehensive search strategy was 
conducted to identify relevant studies focused on 
walking cadence and intensity for adults. Identified 
studies (n=38) included controlled (n=11), free-living 
observational (n=18) and intervention (n=9) designs.
Results There was a strong relationship between 
cadence (as measured by direct observation and 
objective assessments) and intensity (indirect 
calorimetry). Despite acknowledged interindividual 
variability, ≥100 steps/min is a consistent heuristic 
(e.g, evidence-based, rounded) value associated with 
absolutely defined moderate intensity (3 metabolic 
equivalents (METs)). Epidemiological studies report 
notably low mean daily cadences (ie, 7.7 steps/
min), shaped primarily by the very large proportion 
of time (13.5 hours/day) spent between zero and 
purposeful cadences (<60 steps/min) at the population 
level. Published values for peak 1-min and 30-min 
cadences in healthy free-living adults are >100 and 
>70 steps/min, respectively. Peak cadence indicators 
are negatively associated with increased age and 
body mass index. Identified intervention studies used 
cadence to either prescribe and/or quantify ambulatory 
intensity but the evidence is best described as 
preliminary.
Conclusions A cadence value of ≥100 steps/min 
in adults appears to be a consistent and reasonable 
heuristic answer to ’How fast is fast enough?’ during 
sustained and rhythmic ambulatory behaviour.

InTROduCTIOn
Despite the training advantages associated with 
more vigorous intensities of physical activity, 
walking remains the most commonly reported 
form of exercise.2 Furthermore, ambulatory 
activity (most apparently walking, including any 
other bipedal locomotion) is integral to activities 
performed in the course of transportation, occu-
pation, leisure time and domestic duties for most 
able-bodied individuals.3 The fundamental unit of 
human locomotor movement underlying all forms 
and purposes of ambulation is a step, which can be 
objectively captured and summarised as steps/day 
using most contemporary wearable technologies.
A total daily accounting of accumulated steps 
is a volume indicator of physical activity,4 with 
no consideration for the variable intensities of 
effort associated with execution. Advances in 
many research-grade and commercial-grade wear-
able technologies have enabled the time-stamped 
tracking of step accumulation patterns over shorter 
time frames. Cadence (steps/min) has been strongly 
linked to objectively measured speed (r=0.97) 
and intensity (r=0.94) under controlled labora-
tory conditions (eg, treadmill speeds from 1.8 to 
12.1 
km/hour).5
We have previously described the potential for 
moving the study of cadence out of the laboratory 
and into the study of free-living human step accu-
mulation patterns.3 In the free-living context, step 
accumulation patterns observed over a minute (ie, 
cadence) can effectively communicate free-living 
differences between incidental or sporadic move-
ments and more purposeful movements leading 
up to the more persistent patterns indicative of 
walking and running.3 6 Extrapolating from labo-
ratory-based studies of steady state cadence,5 we 
have described that the intensity of effort will be 
quite low at zero cadence (no ambulation) and rela-
tively lower values (eg, 1–19 steps/min or incidental 
stepping; 20–39 steps/min or sporadic stepping; 
40–59 steps/min or purposeful stepping).6 As bout 
length increases, the step accumulation patterns of 
free-living shift more and more towards one that 
approximates a rhythmic, continuous, forward-ad-
vancing movement pattern more easily recognised 
as ‘walking’ and associated with increasingly higher 
intensities.
These walking patterns can be described more 
appropriately as a rate (slow or 60–79 steps/min, 
medium or 80–99 steps/min, brisk or 100–119 
steps/min and all faster forms of locomotion or 
120+ steps/min).6 It is important to emphasise that 
the lowest cadence bands reflect a step accumu-
lation pattern that is not ‘comically slow motion’ 
purposeful stepping, but one that is indicative of 
a naturally incidental or sporadic stepping pattern 
accumulated in real life.
In 2012, we published a narrative review 
describing the potential for cadence to represent 
behavioural patterns of ambulatory activity in

Review
free-living contexts.3 The topics covered included: 1) measure-
ment of cadence under controlled conditions, 2) measuring free-
living cadence, 3) the relationship between cadence measured 
under controlled and free-living conditions, 4) measuring 
change in cadence under controlled and free-living conditions, 
5) instrumentation capable of capturing free-living cadence 
and 6) targeting cadence in physical activity intervention.3 
The purpose of this current review is to present the state of 
evidence supporting benchmark (standard or reference) and 
threshold (minimums associated with desired outcomes) values 
for cadence-based metrics as an initial step in addressing ‘How 
fast is fast enough?’ in terms of clinical and public health recom-
mendations for adults.
This line of inquiry builds on the literature that established 
‘How many steps/day are enough?’ for adults5 7 8 and ‘How many 
steps/day are too few?'.9 We anticipate that the benchmark and 
threshold values reported herein will be useful for communi-
cating and interpreting cadence-based metrics. This information 
has potential value and utility across a wide range of audiences, 
including researchers, clinicians, device manufacturers and the 
general community. For example, walking cadence can be used 
to prescribe physical activity (eg, in public health guidelines), 
shape behaviour (eg, in physical activity interventions and 
clinical therapeutic programme) and/or analyse behaviour (eg, 
making sense of data from research-grade and consumer-grade 
physical activity monitors).
MeThOdS
Search strategy
This is a narrative review informed by a systematic search 
strategy. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement10 11 was used to guide 
our overall approach and writing structure, but not all of the 
PRISMA items were applicable to our review question ‘How fast 
is fast enough?’ under controlled or free-living conditions.
In July 2017, we systematically searched CINAHL, ERIC, 
PsycINFO, PubMed, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science search 
engines using Boolean keyword strings of ‘walk AND (pedom-
eter OR accelerometer) AND ((cadence OR (‘steps per minute’ 
OR steps/min) OR stride)) to identify relevant studies published 
in English language since 2000.
eligibility criteria and study selection
We chose to focus on adults, as cadence-based research in chil-
dren and adolescents is currently less developed. Review arti-
cles, abstracts not linked to any published article and duplicates 
were initial exclusions. Subsequently, two authors (HH and 
EJA) independently screened all records by title and abstract. 
Any discrepancies were resolved by further discussion before 
proceeding to the full-text screening stage. Inclusion criteria for 
original research studies of adults were: 1) controlled studies 
of the relationship between cadence and intensity, or 2) obser-
vational studies reporting cadence-based metrics in free-living 
conditions or 3) intervention studies that had used cadence to 
prescribe and/or analyse ambulatory behaviour. All coauthors 
reviewed the list of selected articles and reference sections were 
scanned to identify any studies that may have been missed on the 
electronic database search.
data collection process
Data items extracted and tabulated by HH and EJA were: 
study design; authors; sample characteristics; measurement 
methods; protocol; analytical strategy and cadence-related study 
outcomes. Several authors (EJA, DAR, MK and TVB) shared 
auditing of this information for quality control. Discrepancies 
were resolved by consensus. If studies reported cadence-based 
metrics in terms of stride frequency, we converted these to steps/
min (eg, measures in stride were multiplied by 2). Any apparent 
inconsistencies in contents summarised within and across tables 
(eg, manners of reporting instrument brand, models, number of 
decimal points, ages, etc) reflect inconsistent conventions tied to 
the original articles. Values are generally presented as mean±SD, 
unless otherwise indicated.
Synthesis of results: categorising and collating benchmark 
values and heuristic thresholds
After studies were identified, we began synthesising their infor-
mation by categorising the study designs (controlled, free-living 
observational, intervention) and the various ways that cadence-
based metrics have been defined, captured and reported in the 
literature. Based on our collective extensive experience and 
expertise in the field collecting step-based data, we focused on 
the cadence-based metrics that were most relevant to public 
health and clinical utility.
We initially approached ‘How fast is fast enough?’ in terms of 
our current ability to set threshold (ie, minimum) values asso-
ciated with moderate intensity (ie, the intensity advocated in 
most public health physical activity recommendations). This can 
inform tracking real-time intensity relative to enacted cadence 
and analysis of recorded time spent above objectively moni-
tored cadences. This tactic also echoes accelerometry-based 
approaches in recent decades that have calibrated time-stamped 
activity counts in a similar manner; the difference is that activity 
counts are unit-less summarisations of an acceleration signal, 
whereas cadence is a more direct interpretation of the acceler-
ometer’s signal in terms that are more congruent with the orig-
inating, underlying and observable human ambulatory pattern. 
Our group consensus process was focused on identifying consis-
tency in heuristic (ie, reasonable, not necessarily precise) values 
associated with absolutely defined moderate and vigorous inten-
sity as assessed by indirect calorimetry.
We collated free-living observational estimates of time above 
a range of cadences as initial benchmark values, and catego-
rised published peak cadence indicators (generally the average 
cadence representing the highest, not necessarily consecutive, 1, 
30 or 60 
min accumulated in a day) assessed during free-living 
and related to different health-related outcome variables. This 
approach provides important benchmark values for these novel 
metrics and is an initial step in exploring the potential for setting 
thresholds of ‘best natural effort’. We also catalogued emerging 
intervention research to identify how cadence-based metrics 
have been employed to shape and/or evaluate change in daily 
ambulatory activity accumulation patterns.
Assessment of internal validity and risk of bias
EJA and HH independently evaluated the risk of bias of the nine 
identified intervention studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 
Tool12 (as suggested by the PRISMA statement).10 11 Any discrep-
ancies in the determination of risk of bias for each study across 
the individual items of the tool were resolved by discussion until 
a consensus was reached.

and intervention studies (n=9) reporting cadence as an explicit or 
implicit indicator of intensity. Cadence-based metrics and the defi-
nitions used in the identified studies are presented in table 1.
Controlled studies of cadence
Table 2 presents 11 controlled studies (sample size ranged from 
17 to 226 participants) conducted with adult samples that 
have focused on determining cadence associated with moder-
ate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), typically defined abso-
lutely in terms of metabolic equivalents (METs; 1 MET=3.5 
mL/
kg/min of O2 consumption), with 3 METs generally held to be 
the threshold for moderate intensity.13 One exception14 used 
40% of VO2reserve as an indicator of relative intensity associated 
with cardiorespiratory benefits. Although there is a published 
study that estimated exercise intensity from monitored heart rate

Review
response to increasing cadences,15 table 2 only includes those 
studies that estimated intensity from indirect calorimetry. Eight 
studies reported measuring observed steps using a hand tally 
counter, the other three relied on a record of technology-de-
tected steps taken. Nine studies reported cadences (measured in 
ostensibly healthy samples) associated with absolutely defined 
moderate intensity congruent with a heuristic value (ie, 
reasonably acceptable guiding value) of >100 
steps/min. A 
single study of unilateral transtibial amputees reported that a 
cadence >85 
steps/min was associated with absolutely defined 
moderate intensity.16
Most samples were relatively young with average ages <40 
years. The two studies14 17 focused expressly on older adults 
presented conflicting findings. Peacock et al17 reported 
that ~100 steps/min (exactly, 99 steps/min according to 
personal communication with Dr David Rowe, a coauthor on 
the study) was generally associated with absolutely defined 
moderate intensity at 3 METs (a conventional public health 
intensity marker) but was moderated by age and height (lower 
cadences with older ages and increased height). In contrast to 
the Peacock et al17 conclusion that advanced age moderated 
a lower cadence requirement for absolutely defined intensity 
at 3 METs, Serrano et al14 concluded that a higher cadence 
(ie, 115 steps/min) was associated with relatively defined 
moderate intensity measured at 40% of VO2reserve, a cardio-
respiratory fitness-based marker established from a prior 
maximum fitness test. The three studies that included esti-
mates of absolutely defined vigorous intensity reported values 
congruent with a heuristic value of >130 steps/min associated 
with 6 METs in ostensibly healthy samples.18–20
Free-living observational study of cadence
Technology monitored cadence-based data were measured in 
terms of 1) mean steps/min for the whole day,4 21 22 2) time 
accumulated in different cadence bands6 23–25 (ie, time spent at 
zero, 1–19, 20–39, 40–59 steps/min, etc) and/or above a specific 
cadence threshold indicative of at least moderate intensity (eg, 
100 steps/min)18 26 27 and 3) peak cadence indicators (indices of 
‘best natural effort’).3 Peak cadence indicator metrics include 
peak 1 
min cadence (the highest single recorded minute of steps 
in a day),24 28 peak 30 
min cadence (an average of the highest, not 
necessarily consecutive, 30 
min of a day)24 28 and peak 60 
min 
cadence (an average of the highest, not necessarily consecutive, 
60 
min of a day).24 29
Detailed information of studies that have reported peak 
1 min and 30 min cadences are presented in table 3. Those 
studies presented data from approximately 7500 partici-
pants/patients. A variety of chronically ill populations as 
well as healthy participants were represented in these studies 
and included those adults aged up to ≥90 years. Ostensibly 
healthy adults aged <60 years had peak 1 min cadences of 
typically >100 steps/min. Relatively older and/or unhealthy 
individuals had lower peak 1 min cadences, sometimes in the 
70 steps/min range. Smaller studies noted differences between 
men and women in peak 1 min cadence while studies with 
more participants did not. Peak 1 min cadence was higher on 
weekdays compared with weekends.28
Figure 2 is supplemental to table 3 and graphically depicts 
peak 30 min cadences reported by age, sex, body mass index 
(BMI)-defined weight status, weekday versus weekend, day 
or by specified chronic illness or disability. Where multiple 
studies reported values based on the same data set, for example, 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 
only a single study’s data are presented. Across studies, peak 
30 
min cadence was negatively associated with age. Peak 30 
min 
cadence was negatively associated with BMI, although individ-
uals in the underweight BMI category had similar peak 30 
min 
cadences to those classified as obese. Individuals with one or 
more diseases had lower peak 30 
min cadences than ostensibly 
healthy individuals. Natural breaks in the data for peak 30 
min 
cadence are unclear. Relatively younger and/or healthy adults 
had peak 30 
min cadence values >70 
steps/min (sometimes >80

steps/min), whereas relatively older and/or unhealthy individuals 
had peak 30 
min cadence values <70 
steps/min.
Intervention studies
Nine studies (table 4) either provided cadence-based recom-
mendations as part of an intervention (n=5) or used cadence-
based metrics to analyse accelerometer data (n=4). At this early 
stage in intervention research, cadence-based metrics appear to 
be readily sensitive to physical activity intervention. An addi-
tional focus on manipulating cadence in step-based interventions 
appears to increase speed of walking and engagement in contin-
uous bouts, but does not seem to lead to more daily steps or 
consistently to more total time in MVPA. Most studies were at 
high risk of selection, performance, detection and attrition bias 
(table 5), indicating an overall high risk of bias (poor internal 
validity) (table 5).
dISCuSSIOn
The surge of availability of commercial wearable technolo-
gies capable of detecting minute-by-minute step accumulation 
patterns presents an opportunity to provide cadence-based 
values to guide and monitor healthful ambulatory activity. 
Because people wear these devices increasingly frequently, 
there is a need for guidance on how to monitor and interpret 
these data. However, such devices are not absolutely neces-
sary to track cadence as it can be simply determined by manu-
ally counting the number of steps accumulated during a 1 min 
period (or 15 s multiplied by 4, or 10 s multiplied by 6) or more 
crudely by dividing the total number of steps accumulated 
during a bout of exercise by the duration of the bout (eg, 3000 
steps/30 min=100 steps/min). Cadence may also be shaped 
using rhythmic auditory cues (eg, a metronome) or music.30 31 
Therefore, the use of cadence as a marker of physical activity 
intensity may have clinical and practical value. Furthermore, 
there is potential for it to be effectively combined with steps/
day (an indicator of ambulatory volume) and time spent at 
zero cadence (an indicator of non-ambulatory or sedentary 
time) to provide an integrated snapshot of different aspects of 
human movement/non-movement behaviour.32
Controlled studies of cadence
Perhaps the most compelling observation that can be made is 
that, despite acknowledged interindividual variability, there is 
remarkable consistency supporting ≈100 steps/min as a heuristic 
value associated with the threshold for absolutely defined 
moderate intensity in ostensibly healthy individuals without 
movement impairments. This overall consistent finding for a 
broad heuristic moderate-intensity benchmark value is in stark 
contrast to the prevailing situation of ‘cut-point wars’ associated 
with waist and wrist worn accelerometer-determined activity 
counts, where consensus regarding values associated with inten-
sity markers have proven elusive.
T
wo studies (Peacock et al17 and Serrano et al14 examined 
the influence of age on the relationship between cadence 
and intensity, and reported conflicting findings. The discrep-
ancy is most apparently due to a combination of differences 
in sample ages and employed definitions of moderate inten-
sity; the need for a maximum fitness test to establish a rela-
tive intensity index makes the Serrano approach less practical 
for non-research purposes (ie, public health applications). A 
higher cadence might be required for older adults to achieve 
moderate intensity,33 however, our findings do not support this 
suggestion, at least in terms of absolutely defined moderate

Review
intensity. While older adults have the capacity to walk above 
100 steps/min in both laboratory and free-living setting, this 
does not imply that older adults require a higher cadence to 
achieve moderate intensity.17 23 Instead, older adults (espe-
cially those of advanced age) might require a relatively lower 
cadence to achieve moderate intensity, although it may be 
premature to make any firm conclusions due to the limited 
data available. The CADENCE-Adults study ( 
ClinicalTrials. 
gov: NCT02650258; in progress) will provide more informa-
tion to guide specific benchmark values.
Initial evidence suggests that >130 steps/min may be simi-
larly useful as a threshold value indicative of vigorous inten-
sity (ie, ≥6 METs) ambulatory activity. To clarify, achieving 
100 or 130 steps/min are both achievable targets for osten-
sibly healthy adults. The Compendium of Physical Activities34 
indicates that walking at 2.5 mph (4.0 km/hour) is a moderate 
(3 MET)-intensity activity (code 17170). Using the metabolic 
equations provided for walking energy expenditure provided 
by the American College of Sports Medicine,35 3 METs corre-
sponds to a walking speed of 2.6 mph (4.2 km/hour). From a 
controlled treadmill trial of walking at 3.0 and 4.0 mph (4.8 
and 5.4 km/hour) in 50 young adults,18 3 METs was the energy 
expenditure predicted for a speed of 2.7 mph (4.3 km/hour). 
From a controlled study of overground walking at speeds 
between 2.0 and 4.0 mph (3.2 and 6.4 km/hour), 3 METs was 
the predicted energy expenditure when walking at 2.7 mph 
(4.3 km/hour).36 These data suggest that moderate-intensity 
walking reliably occurs at a speed of 2.6–2.7 mph (4.2–4.3 km/
hour). In addition, slow to fast walking speeds (~2.0–4.0 mph 
or 3.2–6.4 km/hour, respectively) correspond to a cadence 
range of 96–134 steps/min,5 further emphasising the practical 
relevance of 100 steps/min but also 130 steps/min as heuristic 
cadence-intensity threshold values useful for communicating, 
prescribing and/or evaluating ambulatory intensity. Although 
further research is needed to more firmly establish a consistent 
threshold value for vigorous intensity.
Free-living observational study of cadence
Mean steps/min represents a daily average value that is shaped 
by the naturally large amount of time spent at zero cadence 
(both individually and on a population level). As a result, it is 
very low in absolute magnitude (US adults >20 years of age 
accumulate an average of 7.7 daily steps/min4). Expressed in 
terms of average time spent in different cadence bands during 
daily wearing time, the US adults also accumulate ≅ 4.8 hours 
at zero cadence, ≅ 8.7 hours at 1–59 steps/min, ≅ 16 min at 
cadences of 60–79 steps/min, ≅ 8 min at 80–99 steps/min, ≅ 
5 min at 100–119 steps/min and ≅ 2 min at 120+ steps/min.6 
Although the US adults average approximately 30 min daily 
at cadences >60 steps/min, time spent at cadences >100 steps/
min are low at the population level (3.6% prevalence of aver-
aging at least 30 min/day ≥100 steps/min). Relative to the 
approximately 1000 waking minutes available in a day,37 it 
is apparent that for most people, daily continuous, rhythmic 
walking of at least moderate intensity is quite rare. With so 
many zero scores for time at this cadence level, analysts will 
be tempted to simply categorise monitored samples according 
to whether or not an individual accumulates any time 
at >100 steps/min. The problem is that this approach misses 
the opportunity to explore the greater range of individual 
cadence-based behaviour. Furthermore, although ambulating 
at a cadence >100 steps/min appears to be a heuristic value 
congruent with moderate-intensity activity, it remains possible 
that various health benefits can be realised with lower step 
accumulation patterns and thus intensities captured as time 
spent above lower cadence values (eg, >60 steps/min and/or 
patterns of interrupting zero cadence sequences). This requires 
further evaluation. However, this approach to setting lower

Review
time-based cadence thresholds does not alleviate the problem 
inherent in studying time accumulated above any set cadence 
threshold in these strongly positively skewed data.
To better address the issue of skewed data, we suggest 
using peak cadence indicators to study group/population-level 
patterns of intensity-related ambulatory behaviour. We 
describe these as indices of ‘best natural effort,’ shaped by 
1) the highest daily personal cadence values accumulated, 2) 
the relative ‘persistence’ of this behaviour on that day and 3) 
the habitual regularity of that same behaviour pattern across 
averaged days.28 As an index value, a peak cadence indicator’s 
distribution is more likely to approximate normality than 
conventional time-above-threshold metrics (ie, time spent at 
or above 100 steps/min), because everyone has a score above 
zero. We recently reported strong inverse relationships (linear 
trends; all P<0.001) between quintiles of peak 30 min cadence 
and numerous cardiometabolic risk factors (eg, weight, BMI, 
waist circumference, insulin) in an analysis of NHANES 
2005–2006 data.32 While only the fifth quintile achieved a 
peak 30 min cadence (~96 steps for men and women) similar 
to the heuristic value of >100 steps/min, clinically favourable 
cardiometabolic risk factor values were also apparent at the 
third (~70 steps/min) and fourth (~80 steps/min) quintiles 
compared with the lowest quintiles. This opens up the possi-
bility, assuming corroboration from prospective/intervention 
study designs, that lower cadences than that associated with 
absolutely defined moderate intensity may be appropriately 
prescribed to elicit specific health outcomes.
Intervention studies
One clear application of cadence-based benchmarks and 
thresholds is for prescription and/or analysis of ambulatory 
physical activity. However, this has not been extensively 
studied—we only identified nine intervention studies with 
our systematic search. These initial findings convey the poten-
tial utility of using cadence-based metrics to either shape or 
identify nuanced changes in patterns of free-living ambulatory 
behaviour. However, based on the relatively small number of 
studies identified, and the generally high risk of bias, further 
high-quality research is needed to better understand the utility 
of cadence-based physical activity prescription and/or data 
analysis approaches. While it is premature to synthesise the 
evidence across studies (eg, using meta-analytic approaches) 
to specifically quantify the expected change in these novel 
cadence-based metrics and their potential associations with 
health-related outcomes, we anticipate high-quality evidence 
is likely to build on this nascent foundation.
limitations
We acknowledge the interindividual variability inherent to the 
cadence and intensity relationship. One possible source of vari-
ability is that individuals are likely to adopt different patterns 
of cadence and step length (based on height/leg length) to 
modulate increases in walking speed and intensity. A logical 
question, then, would be to consider the role of step length 
in determining walking speed and intensity. In a study of gait 
variability during free-living ambulatory behaviour, cadence 
was the primary strategy for increasing ambulatory speed up 
to self-selected preferred speed, and cadence and step length 
contributed equally beyond this point to achieve faster walking 
speeds.38 Furthermore, cadence is strongly and consistently 
related to ambulatory speed and intensity,5 supporting our 
focus on cadence as a suitable and practical proxy indicator of

Review
ambulatory intensity. To reconcile these seemingly conflicting 
tensions, we assert that both these statements are true: 1) 
evidence-based heuristic cadence values (eg, ~100 steps/min 
indicative of absolutely defined moderate intensity intended to 
communicate public health recommendations) are reasonable 
and 2) a degree of individualised precision may be achieved 
by considering stature-related characteristics, and that the 
usefulness of such individualisation is greater for people who 
are further from the population average for stature. Either 
approach (ie, generalised vs individualised) can be rationally 
defended depending on expressed research, clinical, perfor-
mance training or public health need.
The minimal amount of time spent at >100 steps/min on a 
population level is readily acknowledged; a large proportion of 
any representative population accumulate zero minutes above 
this threshold. Furthermore, time spent above relatively lower 
cadences is also associated with various health markers. Time 
spent above any set value, however, will likely exhibit similar 
floor (or ceiling, if set too low) effects in terms of measure-
ment characteristics. Peak cadence indicators are derived 
variables indicative of an individual’s ‘best natural effort’ and 
their approximately normal distribution in a population is 
appealing, at least from a data analytic perspective. However, 
they are not widely familiar. Therefore, it is too early to judge 
their intervention utility (eg, in terms of acceptability to the 
general public and practitioners) or to establish firm threshold 
values for surveillance or screening purposes, public health or 
clinical messages or programme evaluation.
It is methodologically possible to capture the instantaneous 
rate of just a few steps taken over smaller time intervals than a 
minute. However, we believe that consistently using the term 
cadence (and the unit steps/min) to describe the spectrum of 
step accumulation patterns up to and including the transition 
to rates of increasingly faster (and thus more intense) loco-
motion is reasonable. This amalgamated approach facilitates 
efficient measurement and communication that transcends 
the gaps between science, clinical practice and real life. As we 
have previously argued, the standardised use of a minute as 
the base unit of time for capturing and describing free-living 
cadence patterns is also reasonable.3 The step accumulation 
pattern observed over a minute can effectively communicate 
free-living differences between incidental or sporadic move-
ments and more purposeful movements leading up to the 
more persistent patterns indicative of walking and running.3 6 
Although shorter time intervals can reveal the abruptness and 
transience of such movements, the meaningfulness of such 
reductionist approaches to compartmentalising human free-
living movement outside of the laboratory is not our intent.
We predicted3 that some would argue that a shorter time interval 
would be necessary to capture the speed of brief movement 
patterns,39 and this may be appropriate for some specific research 
questions. Of interest, Stanfield et al40 objectively monitored free-
living behaviour of individuals with intermittent claudication and a 
general unlimited sample and clearly demonstrated that differences 
in time spent in all rate-specific stepping patterns were obscured 
when cadence was represented as an instantaneous rate but effec-
tively discriminatory when expressed as steps accumulated in a 
minute. We again assert that 'the purpose of studying free-living 
minute-by-minute step accumulation patterns is to relay the execu-
tion and relative persistence of naturally occurring ambulatory 
behaviour'3 against an obvious human-scaled unit of time. There-
fore, we feel it is appropriate to continue to use the term cadence 
and its unit of steps/min to efficiently and effectively capture the 
What is already known?
 
► Step counting is widely accepted as a valid approach to 
assessing physical activity.
 
► Cadence (steps/min) is a known temporal gait parameter.
 
► Contemporary wearable technologies are capable of tracking 
cadence.
What are the new findings?
 
► The heuristic cadence estimate of >100 steps/min is a 
threshold value of absolutely defined moderate-intensity 
ambulatory activity in ostensibly healthy adults.
 
► The prescription and/or evaluation of cadence-based metrics 
in interventions is preliminary.

the pace of life.3
COnCluSIOn
Step-counting is now widely accepted in physical activity interven-
tions. Advances in contemporary wearable technologies allow us to 
also track cadence as a reasonable indicator of ambulatory inten-
sity. Evidence consistently supports a cadence of >100 
steps/min as 
a heuristic threshold value indicative of absolutely defined moder-
ate-intensity ambulatory activity in ostensibly healthy adults. Peak 
cadence indicators may prove useful for capturing ‘best natural 
effort’, but the evidence supporting benchmark and threshold 
values is immature at this time. The prescription and/or evaluation 
of cadence-based metrics in interventions is preliminary.
