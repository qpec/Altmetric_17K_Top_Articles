Abstract
Background: This pilot study evaluated the effect of short- and long-term ivacaftor treatment on hyperpolarized 3He-magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI)–defined ventilation defects in patients with cystic fibrosis aged ≥12 years with a G551D-CFTR mutation.
Methods: Part A (single-blind) comprised 4 weeks of ivacaftor treatment; Part B (open-label) comprised 48 weeks of treatment. The primary
outcome was change from baseline in total ventilation defect (TVD; total defect volume:total lung volume ratio).
Results: Mean change in TVD ranged from −8.2% (p = 0.0547) to −12.8% (p = 0.0078) in Part A (n = 8) and −6.3% (p = 0.1953) to −9.0%
(p = 0.0547) in Part B (n = 8) as assessed by human reader and computer algorithm, respectively.
Conclusions: TVD responded to ivacaftor therapy. 3He-MRI provides an individual quantification of disease burden that may be able to detect
aspects of the disease missed by population-based spirometry metrics. Assessments by human reader and computer algorithm exhibit similar
trends, but the latter appears more sensitive.

 1. Introduction
Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) is the primary measure
used for characterizing lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis
(CF). However, FEV1 and other pulmonary function tests have
limitations [1,2]. For example, FEV1 reflects total airway
resistance and is relatively insensitive to obstruction in small
airways, which contributes to ≈10% of overall resistance in
healthy adults [3]. Additionally, spirometry is a population-based
metric by means of which the disease burden in an individual
cannot be determined in absolute terms; it can only be estimated by
evaluating the standing of the patient's spirometric results in a
Gaussian distribution. Therefore, in patients with high percent
predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) values, it can be difficult to determine
whether damage exists and if further improvements in lung
function are possible with treatment. Furthermore, reliable
spirometry results are difficult to obtain in patients younger than
6 years of age because it requires concentration, cooperation with
the spirometry technician, and control of breathing, tasks that may
be difficult for young children [4]. Therefore, more sensitive
techniques for assessing lung function, which can be performed by
patients of all ages, are needed for assessing disease status and
response to treatment in patients with CF.
Hyperpolarized helium-3 (3He), an inhaled contrast agent
for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), helps to distinguish
well ventilated from poorly ventilated regions of the lung
(termed “ventilation defects”) by means of images that have
high temporal and spatial resolution [5]. It does not expose
patients
to
ionizing
radiation,
in
contrast
to
computed
tomography (CT) [5]. In prior studies,
3He-MRI revealed
ventilation defects in patients with CF [5–13], including those
with normal spirometry [5,8], as well as children younger than
6 years [9,10,12,14]. In one study, the ventilation abnormalities
seen using 3He-MRI correlated well with structural abnormal-
ities on CT [11]. These data suggest that 3He-MRI may be a
sensitive test for depicting lung disease in CF.
In patients with CF, ventilation defects identified by
3He-MRI have responded to conventional treatments, including
bronchodilator and mechanical airway clearance [5,7–9]. We
hypothesized that 3He-MRI would be appropriate for evaluat-
ing response to ivacaftor (Kalydeco; Vertex Pharmaceuticals
Incorporated, Boston, MA), a CF transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR) potentiator in patients with the gating
mutation G551D [15]. In clinical studies, ivacaftor has been
shown to improve lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, and
symptoms of CF in eligible patients [15–19]. In these studies,
pulmonary outcomes were assessed using traditional spirome-
try (ie, FEV1); thus, it is possible that the full extent of the
deficit in lung function or response to treatment was not
captured.
The objectives of this pilot study were to determine whether
3He-MRI is a reliable indicator of lung function in patients aged
12 years and older who have CF and a G551D mutation, and
who are treated with ivacaftor, and to investigate the effects of
ivacaftor therapy on lung function, as measured by 3He-MRI.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design
This single-center, Phase 2 study was conducted in 2 parts.
Part A was a single-blind (patients were blinded to the identity of
treatment they were receiving), single-arm feasibility phase
comprising 4 weeks of ivacaftor treatment (one 150 mg ivacaftor
tablet every 12 h), with placebo run-in and placebo washout
periods (Fig. 1). This design was selected to avoid study effect
bias, as patients with CF commonly adhere more closely to
maintenance therapies during clinical trials and consequently
experience disease improvement. Part B, which commenced
approximately 3 months after Part A concluded, was a 48-week,
open-label, single-arm phase evaluating the long-term effect of
ivacaftor treatment (Fig. 1). Patients in Part B were either newly
enrolled or had participated in Part A. Study assessments were
conducted approximately every 12 weeks and at study follow-up
at week 50.

 2.2. Patients
Patients aged 12 years or older with CF ([1] sweat chloride
≥60 mmol/L or 2 CF-causing mutations and [2] chronic
sinopulmonary disease or gastrointestinal/nutritional abnormal-
ities) were eligible for study inclusion. Patients were required to
have at least 1 G551D mutation and ppFEV1 of at least 40 at
screening. In Part B, no more than 3 patients with ppFEV1
greater than 90 could be enrolled.
Key exclusion criteria included abnormal liver function (liver
function tests indicating values ≥3 times the upper limit of
normal), documented sputum colonization with selected organ-
isms (eg, Burkholderia cenocepacia, Mycobacterium abscessus),
and any potential contraindications to an MRI. Patient treatment
regimens must have been stable for at least 14 days before
screening and were required to be maintained throughout the
study, although patients on cycling inhaled antibiotics were
allowed to switch the type of inhaled antibiotic. In Part A, the use
of inhaled hypertonic saline was not permitted.
The
study
protocol
(www.clinicaltrials.gov
identifier:
NCT01161537) was approved by the local institutional review
board. Patients or parents/guardians provided written informed
consent, and patients younger than 18 years provided assent.
2.3. Study assessments
At each study visit, patients performed spirometry according
to American Thoracic Society guidelines (Koko and Koko
Legend
Spirometers;
nSpire,
Longmont,
CO),
underwent
3He-MRI and a sweat chloride test, and completed the Cystic
Fibrosis Questionnaire–Revised (CFQ-R) [20,21]. Three CFQ-R
versions were used: Child, Adult/Adolescent, and Parent/
Caregiver (of patients aged 12 or 13 years). Clinical chemistry
and hematology testing and urinalysis were performed at all visits
except day 1. Height and weight were assessed at the screening
visit in Part A and at every visit in Part B.
2.3.1. MRI acquisition and analysis
3He-MRI
was
administered
under
an
FDA-approved
investigational new drug treatment protocol # 57,866. 3He
was polarized to between 20% and 40% using a prototype
commercial system (Magnetic Imaging Technologies Inc.;
Durham, NC). MRIs were analyzed using both a human reader
(C.L-S.) and an automated method to quantify poorly ventilated
lung volume. See online supplementary material for additional
details regarding the MR image acquisition and analysis.
2.4. Outcome measures
The primary efficacy variable was change in total ventilation
defect (TVD) from baseline (Part A, day 15; Part B, day 1) to
the end of ivacaftor treatment (Part A, day 43; Part B, week 48).
TVD was manually scored and analyzed by the automated
Ventilation Segmentation algorithm [22,23].
Secondary efficacy variables were absolute change from
baseline to end of ivacaftor treatment in ppFEV1, sweat chloride,
and CFQ-R respiratory domain score. Safety evaluations
included adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory assessments
(serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation studies, and urinal-
ysis), clinical evaluation of vital signs and physical examinations,
and electrocardiographs. AEs were collected after consent or
assent was obtained from all patients enrolled and continued
through the follow-up telephone call in Part A or the follow-up
visit in Part B.
3. Results
3.1. Study population
Eight patients were enrolled in Part A and completed dosing.
Four of these also participated in Part B, which enrolled a total of
9 patients. Eight patients completed dosing in Part B (1 patient
refused further dosing), 7 of whom completed Part B through the
safety follow-up visit (Supplemental Fig. 1). Patient characteris-
tics for both Parts A and B are summarized in Table 1.
3.2. Primary outcome
3.2.1. Part A
Volume of lung tissue showing ventilation defect as judged by
human reader (TVDH) was reduced by 8.2% from baseline (day
15) after short-term ivacaftor treatment (day 43; p = 0.0547)
(Fig. 2A). When calculated by computer algorithm (TVDC), a
12.8% reduction was observed (p = 0.0078; Fig. 2B). TVD

a Out of the 9 patients who consented in Part B, 2 with G551D/F508del-
CFTR mutations withdrew. One of these patients withdrew after completing the
day 15 visit because the drug was approved and the patient could receive it
outside of the clinical trial. The other patient withdrew after completing the
week 48 visit; this patient was unwilling to stop ivacaftor treatment for the
washout period of the study. Neither withdrawal was attributed to a perceived
lack of efficacy.

 values returned to baseline levels during the washout period
(TVDC increase was 8.5%; p = 0.0078).
3.2.2. Part B
The reduction in TVD from baseline (day 1) at the end of
ivacaftor treatment (week 48) was 6.3% (TVDH; p = 0.1953)
and 9.0% (TVDC; p = 0.0547), respectively (Fig. 3A and B).
By the week 50 safety follow-up visit, mean (SD) TVD values
returned to near baseline levels (43.7% [11.93] at baseline vs.
44.8% [8.23] at follow-up TVDH; 33.1% [10.87] at baseline vs.
34.7% [6.71] at follow-up TVDC).
3.3. Secondary outcomes
3.3.1. Part A
At the end of short-term ivacaftor treatment (day 43), mean
ppFEV1 increased by 12.8 percentage points (minimum,
maximum: 2.8, 30.5; p = 0.0078; Fig. 2C) and sweat chloride
values decreased by 42.3 mmol/L (p = 0.0078; Fig. 2D) from
baseline (day 15). Percent predicted FEV1 and sweat chloride
values returned to near-baseline levels at the follow-up
evaluation
(day
57).
The
7.6-point
change
in
CFQ-R
respiratory health domain score was not statistically significant
(p = 0.8125) although a greater than 4 point change in CFQ-R
score is commonly considered clinically significant [21]
(Fig. 2E).
3.3.2. Part B
At the end of ivacaftor treatment (week 48), the increase in
ppFEV1 from baseline (day 1) was 5.2 percentage points (minimum,
maximum: −7.1, 18.1; Fig. 3C) and was not significant. Sweat
chloride decreased by 48.9 mmol/L (p = 0.0078; Fig. 3D), and
CFQ-R respiratory health domain score increased by 15.1 points
(p = 0.0156; Fig. 3E). By week 50, all variables measured had
returned to baseline levels.

 3.4. Correlation analyses
Improvement in TVDH (reduction) and in ppFEV1 (increase)
showed moderate correlation (Spearman correlation for Part A,
day 15 through day 43: −0.5238; Part B, day 1 through
48 weeks: −0.6679). Correlations between change in TVDH and
change in sweat chloride and CFQ-R respiratory domain scores
were weak. The Spearman correlations were the following: Part
A: change in TVDH and sweat: 0.0240; TVD and CFQ-R score:
0.0976; Part B: TVD and sweat: 0.2293; TVD and CFQ-R score:
−0.2048. The strongest correlation seen in post-hoc analysis was
that between the absolute change in MRI measured ventilated
lung volume (by computer algorithm) and the absolute change in
FEV1 (both expressed in liters) measured at every visit compared
with the prior visit in Part A. Decreases in TVD matched closely
with increases in FEV1 (Spearman −0.85, p b 0.0001).
3.5. Images
To illustrate the finding, the imaging results of two represen-
tative patients from Part A are shown in Fig. 4 and Supplemental
Fig. 2. During Part A, 1 patient (patient 002) had a marked
reduction in TVD from baseline to the end of short-term ivacaftor
treatment (−24.6 [TVDH] and −31.0 [TVDC] percentage points,
Fig. 4). This patient also had a marked improvement in ppFEV1,
from 62 at baseline to 83 at the end of treatment. After a 2-week
placebo washout period, ppFEV1 worsened and ventilation
defects returned on imaging. Another patient from Part A (patient
005) had normal spirometry at baseline (day 15; ppFEV1, 113) but
had substantial ventilation defects on imaging (TVDH, 29.0%).
Following 4 weeks of ivacaftor treatment (day 43), this patient
had only a small increase in FEV1 to 116 but clear improvement in
lung ventilation on imaging (TVDH, 16.0%; Supplemental Fig. 2).

 The longer duration of Part B provided additional information
about the time course and durability of the changes in lung
ventilation. One representative patient from Part B (patient 910)
had sustained improvement in ventilation defects from baseline
(ie, day 1; ppFEV1, 64; TVDH, 48.0%) through week 24
(ppFEV1, 77; TVD, 17.1%) (Supplemental Fig. 3). At week 36,
ppFEV1 (77) was stable; however, a worsening in lung
ventilation defects was apparent on imaging (TVD, 28.0%).
Shortly after the week 36 study visit, this patient was treated for a
mild pulmonary exacerbation. At week 48, the patient had
recovered, and ventilation was improved on imaging (TVD
22.0%) and ppFEV1 was again stable (76). At the week 50 visit
following the 2-week washout, lung ventilation worsened (TVD
35.0%) and ppFEV1 declined (65) to near-baseline values.
3.6. Safety and tolerability
The incidence of AEs in Parts A and B is summarized in
Supplemental Table 1. During the placebo run-in and washout
phases of Part A, 2 patients (25.0%) reported 3 AEs of mild
severity: dry throat, oropharyngeal pain, and generalized pain.
During the ivacaftor treatment phase, 3 patients (37.5%)
reported 3 AEs: mild pulmonary exacerbation that required
treatment, headache of mild severity, and abdominal distention
of moderate severity. These findings are consistent with clinical
events observed in patients with CF and with the established
safety profile for ivacaftor [16,17].
In Part B, 6 patients (66.7%) had a total of 32 AEs, most
commonly (≥3 patients) upper respiratory tract infection (n = 4;
44.4%) and pulmonary exacerbation of CF (n = 3, 33.3%).
Eighteen AEs were moderately severe: pulmonary exacerbation
of CF (n = 2), pyrexia (n = 2), and 1 each of upper respiratory
infection, bronchitis, cellulitis, labyrinthitis, nasopharyngitis,
pharyngitis streptococcal, vulvovaginal mycotic infection, posi-
tive bacterial test, nausea, cerumen impaction, stress fracture,
tendonitis, cough, and rash. One patient experienced a severe,
serious AE of pulmonary exacerbation and required hospitaliza-
tion and intravenous antibiotics; the AE resolved by the end of the
study. These findings are also consistent with clinical events
observed in patients with CF and with the established safety
profile for ivacaftor.
No clinically significant safety signals were related to the
use of 3He-MRI.
4. Discussion
Part A of this pilot, exploratory study evaluated the feasibility
of using 3He-MRI to evaluate short-term (4-week) responses to
ivacaftor in patients with CF who had a G551D-CFTR mutation
on at least 1 allele. In Part B, examination of ventilation defects
using 3He-MRI assessed the efficacy of long-term ivacaftor
administered up to 48 weeks [16,17]. TVD, ppFEV1, sweat
chloride levels, and CFQ-R scores returned to near-baseline
values after treatment with ivacaftor was stopped in both parts of
the study. No new safety signals were identified for ivacaftor, and
no safety concerns were associated with the use of 3He-MRI.
Confirming previous studies [6,10], TVD and ppFEV1 were
only moderately correlated, as exemplified by patient 005
Fig. 4. Coronal hyperpolarized 3He-MRI images of patient 002 in Part A. Typical images are shown (expanded image sets of the same case are given in Supplemental
Fig. 4). Following inhalation of the hyperpolarized gas, well-ventilated lung regions appear bright white, and poorly ventilated regions (termed “ventilation defects”)
appear dark gray/black. A) Baseline (day 15): ppFEV1: 62.2; TVDH: 51.7%; TVDC: 48.4%. B) End of 4 weeks of ivacaftor treatment (day 43): ppFEV1: 83.0; TVDH:
27.1%; TVDC: 17.4%. C) End of 2 weeks of placebo washout (day 57): ppFEV1: 71.6; TVDH: 57.4%; TVDC: 40.9%.

 (images in Supplemental Fig. 2), who had normal spirometry at
baseline (ppFEV1, 113) but had ventilation defects on imaging.
It is notable that all patients began Parts A and B of the study
with obvious ventilation defects as assessed by 3He-MRI, even
though some had spirometry measures within the normal range.
Furthermore,
improvement
in
lung
ventilation
following
ivacaftor treatment was apparent on 3He-MRI, even in some
patients with only small improvements in FEV1. In previous
studies of healthy children and young adults,
3He-MRI
depicted few, if any, ventilation defects that might predict
underlying lung disease [24,25]. The combination of the
finding in the current study and prior studies in healthy
children suggest that 3He-MRI may be useful in understanding
disease progression at the individual patient level. This further
provides a complementary approach to population-based
spirometry metrics in gauging treatment of CF early in disease.
An advantage of 3He-MRI is that, by identifying areas of poor
ventilation, it allows physicians to determine whether subclinical
abnormalities exist and whether therefore improvement may be
possible. This is especially critical for young, asymptomatic
children.
3He-MRI may prove to be an important tool for
following the evolution of CF lung disease by detecting earlier
declines in lung health that traditional spirometry may not
capture. In addition, changes in the 3He ventilation are revealed
within the lungs of young children in whom spirometry is not
reliable. A second possible advantage of this technique is a fuller
assessment of response to treatment. An improvement in
spirometry cannot reveal if further improvement is attainable
with additional treatment, as the best spirometric values possible
for any individual patient cannot be known. 3He-MRI assessment
of ventilation defects is quantitative in absolute units, however,
and the degree of possible remaining improvement is determined
in every case. For example, patient 2 in Part A responded to
ivacaftor therapy with resolution of approximately 70.0% of lung
ventilation defects. Thirty percent remained however, suggesting
that some additional improvement might still be possible. Patient
3, by contrast, responded with a reduction in defect volume
(TVD) of only approximately 15.0%, with 85.0% of the defect
volume remaining, showing that much further improvement
would be possible for this patient with additional therapies. The
combination of 3He-MRI and spirometry can also be comple-
mentary. For example, the strong correlation between absolute
change in TVD and absolute change in FEV1 (in liters) argues
that the change in FEV1 with ivacaftor treatment comes primarily
from the ventilation of additional lung volume, rather than
changes in compliance, airway dilation, or other factors that
could influence FEV1.
In this study, 3He-MRI images were analyzed by a human
reader and by computer algorithm. Both methods showed
similar trends, but the computer algorithm detected statistically
significant differences at more time points. The computer
algorithm may vary less in judgment than a human reader with
regard to the position of the boundary between well- and
poorly-ventilated regions of the lung. Within-reader variability
of scores was not determined in this study.
The results of this study should be interpreted in the context
of certain limitations. The apparent greater effect of ivacaftor
treatment in Part A than Part B may be due to the shorter
observation
period
in
Part
A.
Exacerbations
and
other
respiratory illnesses were more likely to occur during the
longer treatment period in Part B. The small number of subjects
in this proof-of-concept study limits the ability to perform
subgroup analyses such as comparing patients with mild to
moderate disease and may explain the lack of statistically
significant improvement in FEV1 after 48 weeks of treatment in
Part B. Furthermore, the number of CF treatment centers
currently equipped to perform 3He-MRI is small; additional
experience in larger, multicenter studies is needed. A study
with a larger sample size may better determine the correlation
between lung function based on 3He-MRI and other measures
such as FEV1 or perhaps small airway flow rates. In addition,
improved image analysis methods may be needed and may
improve the sensitivity of the 3He MRI technique which in this
study matched the statistical power of spirometry.
3He is
currently an investigational contrast agent, which may limit its
use in clinical trials until it is approved and recognized as an
agent that can help with assessing clinical outcome. Indeed, the
need for alternative outcome measures that can detect early
lung disease and assess disease progression from childhood
into adulthood has been widely recognized [26–28].
In conclusion, this study demonstrated the feasibility of using
3He-MRI as an efficacy measure in clinical trials of emerging
treatments for CF. 3He-MRI may be useful for assessing the
regional lung ventilation, something that cannot be done using
spirometry. Further, the technique allows for assessing the
disease at the local level within the lung and can provide a
quantification of the disease burden within the individual patient.
Ventilation defects observed in patients are not uniform, and
regionalizing the analysis (eg, lobar analysis) would be a way of
personalizing monitoring and represents a significant advance
beyond current tools. Although not yet mature, such tools are
under development and permit both the visualization of the 3D
treatment response and the regional quantification of the
treatment response [23]. The study also confirmed that the local
response to ivacaftor within the lung can be determined by means
of 3He MRI and showed that the agent was effective in improving
the local and overall lung ventilation in patients with CF who
have at least 1 copy of the G551D-CFTR mutation.
