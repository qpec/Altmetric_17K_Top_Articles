Abstract
Immune-checkpoint blocking antibodies have demonstrated objective antitumor responses in multiple tumor types
including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell cancer (RCC). In melanoma, an increase in
overall survival has been demonstrated with anti-CTLA-4 and PD-1 inhibition. However, a plethora of immune-
mediated adverse events has been reported with these agents. Immune-mediated cardiotoxicity induced by
checkpoint inhibitors has been reported in single cases with variable presentation, including myocarditis and
pericarditis.
Among six clinical cancer centers with substantial experience in the administration of immune-checkpoint blocking
antibodies, eight cases of immune-related cardiotoxicity after ipilimumab and/or nivolumab/pembrolizumab were
identified. Diagnostic findings, treatment and follow-up are reported. A large variety of cardiotoxic events with
manifestations such as heart failure, cardiomyopathy, heart block, myocardial fibrosis and myocarditis was
documented.
This is the largest case series to date describing cardiotoxicity of immune-checkpoint blocking antibodies.
Awareness, monitoring of patients with pre-existing cardiac disorders and prompt evaluation by the treatment
team is essential. Treatment including application of steroids is critical for patient safety.

Introduction
Immune-checkpoint blocking antibodies including anti-
CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 can induce tumor responses in vari-
ous tumor types including melanoma, non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), renal cell cancer (RCC), and Hodgkin
disease. The anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ipilimu-
mab and the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies nivolumab
and pembrolizumab have been approved by regulatory
agencies in several countries for the treatment of meta-
static melanoma and are associated with response rates
ranging from 10–15 % [1, 2], 31–44 % [3, 4] and 33–38 %
[5, 6], respectively. These data have been generated pre-
dominantly in cutaneous melanoma however responses
have also been observed in rarer melanoma subtypes like
uveal [7, 8] or mucosal melanoma [9, 10]. Many of these
tumor responses are durable over years [3, 5, 11, 12]. Fur-
thermore, since anti-PD1 antibodies have shown efficacy in
other tumor types, leading to approval in NSCLC and
RCC, they will increasingly be applied.
Despite
immune-checkpoint
modulating
antibodies
revolutionizing clinical immunotherapy, their application
is also associated with a spectrum of immune-related ad-
verse events (irAEs) including colitis, endocrinopathies,
hepatitis and pneumonitis. The frequency of irAEs varies
with any grade toxicity by Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of 64–80 % of patients (23 %
Grade 3/4) treated with ipilimumab [1, 13], up to 79 %
(13 % Grade 3/4) in patients treated with pembrolizumab
[5] and up to 96 % (55 % Grade 3/4) in patients treated
with the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab [4].
Most organ systems have been observed to be potential
targets of immune-related toxicity induced by immune-
checkpoint blocking antibodies [5, 14]. Frequent irAEs

and
endocrinopathies.
Other, less frequent events have also been reported for
anti-CTLA-4 antibodies [15–20] as well as anti-PD1
antibodies [10, 21–23]. Particularly, within a retrospect-
ive study among 752 patients, one case of ipilimumab-
induced myocardial fibrosis [24] has previously been
reported. Additionally, selected cases have been re-
ported in the literature including pericarditis [25] and
cardiomyopathy with takotsubo-like syndrome [26] in-
duced by ipilimumab and acute heart failure [27] under
therapy with pembrolizumab.
To gain a more robust understanding of immune-
related cardiotoxicity associated with immune-checkpoint
blocking antibodies, we reviewed the experience of several
institutions in the United States and Germany with high
patient volume treated with these agents. Suspected cases
of cardiotoxicity were vetted for alternative explanations
and a case series is presented here.
Methods
Treating physicians in the melanoma community were
queried for submission of case reports and institutional
databases (with appropriate local Institutional Review
Board approval) were reviewed to identify patients who
likely experienced immune-related cardiologic adverse
events from immune-checkpoint antibody treatment. We
identified and assessed in detail a total of twelve patients
with cardiac side effects in association with checkpoint in-
hibitor treatment. In a total of eight patients adverse
events were judged to be likely treatment-associated after
thorough evaluation of findings (Table 1).
This retrospective study was approved by the institu-
tional review board of the Friedrich-Alexander-University
Erlangen-Nürnberg. In addition, all clinical protocols were
reviewed and approved by the local institutional review
boards of each participating center and were performed
according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and the
Helsinki Declaration. The approving bodies at the centers
were Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Institutional
Review Board, the ethical committee St. Gallen, the
institutional review board of the Friedrich-Alexander-
University Erlangen-Nürnberg, the institutional review
board of the University of Chicago, and the University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center IRB.
Case series
Case 1 – Myocarditis and cardiomyopathy responding
well to steroids
A 72-year-old man with past medical history of myocardial
infarction, diabetes mellitus type II, arterial hypertension,
peripheral arterial disease stage IIb and hyperuricemia was
diagnosed with metastatic BRAF wild-type melanoma and
treated with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg, 4 infusions) and
nivolumab on a clinical trial (1 mg/kg, 4 infusions followed
by 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks; CA209067; NCT01927419).
After 3 infusions of the combination the patient pre-
sented with dyspnea, peripheral edema and anasarca in-
cluding weight gain of 10 kg. Subsequent diagnostic
testing including echocardiography, stress magnetic res-
onance
imaging
(MRI)
and
cardiac
catheterization
showed a reduction of ejection fraction (EF) from 50 %
to 15 % and no suggestion of ischemia. Diuretic medica-
tion (furosemide) was started and a life vest fitted. In
addition, the patient received an ACE-inhibitor (ramipril
2 × 5 mg/d), metoprolol (2 × 47.5 mg/d) and spironolac-
tone (25 mg/d). Cardiac biopsy revealed interstitial in-
flammation mainly with lymphocytes and interstitial
fibrosis (Fig. 1) with no signs of viral infection. A diag-
nosis of immune-induced myocarditis was made and
corticosteroids were initiated at 1 mg/kg orally. Viral se-
rologies from peripheral blood were investigated with a
viral panel being non-reactive for coxsackie virus, adeno-
and enteroviruses, EBV and CMV. The patient was pre-
viously tested for hepatitis B, C and HIV and found to
be non-reactive. Clinical symptoms improved within the
first week and ejection fraction increased to 30 % at
10 days of follow up and stabilized two months later at
40 %. Steroids were tapered during this period with fre-
quent clinical follow up and echocardiography. Thus,
the initial dose of 80 mg was decreased to 60 mg after
two weeks and then reduced by 5 mg every 3–4 weeks
depending on improvement of ejection fraction. Other
immune-related toxicity experienced by this patient in-
cluded an autoimmune-thyroiditis with development of
thyroid-peroxidase (TPO) antibodies treated with carbi-
mazol, hypothyroidism substituted by 50 μg levothyrox-
ine and hypophysitis managed with physiologic steroid
replacement.
The patient had a mixed response to immunotherapy
at the first follow-up staging which evolved into a partial
response which remained stable over 9 months before
the development of progressive disease.
Case 2 – Cardiomyopathy
A 68-year-old man with a past medical history of clinic-
ally asymptomatic dilated cardiomyopathy and alcohol
abuse was diagnosed with metastatic BRAF wild-type
melanoma metastatic to lymph nodes and small bowel
in June of 2011 and subsequently treated with 4 doses of
ipilimumab between July and September of 2011.
Approximately one month after the last dose of ipilimu-
mab the patient developed dyspnea upon exertion in
addition to upper and lower extremity edema, leading to
hospitalization for heart failure exacerbation in November
of 2011. An initial echocardiogram revealed enlargement
of the left ventricle with an EF of 46 %, thickening of the
mitral valve, and severe mitral regurgitation, mild to

 moderate tricuspid regurgitation with severe pulmonary
hypertension. Coronary artery disease was ruled out by
nuclear cardiac stress test. He was treated with diuretics,
beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor with symptomatic im-
provement and normalization of the volume overload.
The etiology was initially attributed to ethanol (ETOH)
abuse, however a repeat echocardiogram in December of
2011 performed after strict abstinence from ETOH
showed worsened EF (25–30 %), which prompted a right
and left heart and coronary catheterization as well as car-
diac biopsy. Coronary artery disease was definitively ruled
out and measurements of right heart pressures suggested
elevated right atrial, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery
pressure. A cardiac biopsy was nonspecific but ruled out
acute myocarditis. Corticosteroids were not administered
and the patient’s performance status only slowly improved
over months.
Restaging imaging following completion of ipilimumab
treatment demonstrated clear progressive disease. Subse-
quent oncologic treatment was complicated by multiple
hospitalizations due to recurrent cellulitis however the pa-
tient was eventually treated with temozolomide chemo-
therapy. Over the course of 18 months, the patient
developed long-term disease stabilization. The patient is
alive more than five years following diagnosis of metastatic
melanoma. While an association of heart failure exacerba-
tion and treatment with ipilimumab was not definitively
established, the close temporal relation, absence of clear
other exacerbating etiologies and long-term survival of the
patient suggest an immune-mediated etiology triggered by
ipilimumab as the most likely culprit of the heart failure.
Case 3 – Myocardial fibrosis
A 71-year-old man with no significant past medical his-
tory other than metastatic melanoma developed steroid-
refractory hepatitis shortly after the second infusion of
ipilimumab. It was not possible to determine other
causes of fibrosis. Ejection fraction had been 65 % before
start of therapy. He subsequently developed multi-organ
failure with capillary leak, renal insufficiency, and neuro-
logical symptoms without brain metastases or haemor-
rhage. The patient died of multi-organ failure despite
immediate induction of high dose steroids and support-
ive measures in the intensive care unit. Though there
were no obvious cardiac symptoms beyond multi-organ
failure, autopsy revealed myocardial fibrosis surrounded
by structural changes of cardiomyocytes.
Case 4 – Heart failure
An 81-year-old man with past medical history including
atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease s/p myocardial
infarction and ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrilla-
tion s/p automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
placement was diagnosed with metastatic BRAF wild-type
melanoma. Ipilimumab was initiated however two weeks
after the third dose, the patient developed diarrhea
deemed immune-related (confirmed by colonoscopy and
muscosal biopsy). An 8 week course of steroids and two
doses of infliximab eventually lead to resolution of the col-
itis. In addition, the patient experienced immune-related
hypophysitis with secondary adrenal insufficiency and
hypothyroidism. Management of colitis was complicated
by bacterial pneumonia requiring two hospitalizations but
eventually resolved.
Eleven weeks following the third and last dose of ipilimu-
mab the patient developed progressive subacute shortness
of breath. An extensive work-up including a computed
tomography (CT) of the chest, bronchoscopy, transbron-
chial biopsy, and bacterial/fungal cultures ruled out a re-
current infectious etiology, other respiratory etiologies, and
metastatic disease. Echocardiography showed a left ven-
tricular EF moderately-to-severely reduced at 35 % from a
baseline of 47 % as measured by myocardial perfusion
single-photon emission computed tomography 14 months
prior. The left ventricle was mildly dilated with normal left
ventricular wall thickness. On physical examination the pa-
tient had an irregularly irregular heart rhythm, mild pitting
edema, and bilateral basilar crackles in the lungs. He did
not exhibit anginal symptoms. Cardiac enzymes and tropo-
nins were negative. He was treated with diuretics resulting
in complete resolution of his respiratory symptoms.
Though the patient clinically improved over time with di-
uretics, cardiac function did not return to normal with
subsequent echocardiography documenting persistently re-
duced ejection fraction. Treatment with corticosteroids
was not given due to the patient’s clinical improvement
with diuretics and previous toxicity from a prolonged ster-
oid course for his immune-related colitis.
Restaging revealed initial tumor shrinkage however
subsequent slow progression over an extended period of

 time. The patient went without treatment for over a year
before initiating anti-PD1 antibody treatment with pem-
brolizumab. No further cardiac events were observed
while receiving pembrolizumab.
Case 5 – Myocarditis/heart failure
A 23-year-old man with BRAFV600E mutant melanoma
received four doses of ipilimumab. The patient had an
initial response to treatment however by approximately
month 5 after starting ipilimumab, he developed disease
progression. Thereafter, the patient initiated vemurafe-
nib. The dose of vemurafenib was reduced from 960 mg
daily to 720 mg daily secondary to multiple episodes of
uveitis (treated with relief by intraocular steroids).
At approximately month 7 after initiating ipilimumab
and 2 months after initiating vemurafenib, the patient
developed severe chest pain and cough. Diagnosis of car-
diogenic shock was made based on vital sign changes as
well as electrocardiogram showing ST segment elevation
and elevated cardiac enzymes including creatine kinase
and troponin-T. The patient was started on both cardiac
inotropic and vasopressor agents and anti-coagulated in
the setting of intermittent atrial fibrillation. Transtho-
racic echocardiogram was performed revealing normal
left ventricular size but severe global hypokinesis, left
ventricular EF of 20 %, and right ventricular systolic
pressure of 33 mm Hg. Diuresis was attempted with
intravenous furosemide and cardiac rate and pressure
control were obtained. Cardiac MRI was performed and
deemed suggestive of myocarditis.
After stabilization, right heart catheterization to assess
hemodynamics and right ventricular endomyocardial bi-
opsy were performed. Pathology revealed lymphocytic myo-
carditis manifesting with lymphohistiocytic infiltrates and
cardiomyocyte damage without identification of eosinophils
(Fig. 2). Electron microscopy confirmed ultrastructural
findings consistent with lymphohistiocytic myocarditis. A
diagnosis of immune-mediated myocarditis was made and
high dose intravenous corticosteroids were initiated until
vasopressive agents could be withdrawn. Oral steroids were
then tapered over approximately six weeks.
Vemurafenib had been held since admission however
this was restarted five days after admission to the hos-
pital. Repeat echocardiograms were performed through-
out the steroid taper and the patient was noted to have
recovery of EF to baseline with resolution of cardiac wall
akinesis within one month of the event. The patient con-
tinued on vemurafenib without other significant toxicity
until the development of diffuse and multifocal brain
metastases approximately one year later. At that time he
was treated with whole brain radiation followed by vemur-
afenib with temozolomide. Despite additional stereotactic
radiosurgery to multiple lesions, disease control in the
brain could not be obtained and the patient eventually
passed away due to progressive melanoma.
Case 6 – Myocarditis
A 64-year-old man with metastatic melanoma and a past
medical history including peripheral vascular disease devel-
oped cardiopulmonary failure two weeks following the sec-
ond dose of ipilimumab. He had no prior cardiac history.
Work-up during admission revealed a slightly dimin-
ished creatinine clearance of 86 ml/min (reference
range > 90 ml/min), an elevated creatinine of 135 μmol/l
(reference range 59–104 μmol/l) and elevated coagula-
tion factor values. However, troponin was normal and
coronary angiography unremarkable. Resuscitation was
initially performed using dopamine. No corticosteroids
were given and the patient passed away five days follow-
ing initiation of these symptoms. Autopsy revealed car-
diac changes consistent with a myocarditis including
evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy with fibrosis and
microscopic findings including several scattered foci of
lymphocytes and eosinophilic granulocytes.
Case 7 – Cardiac arrest
An 88-year-old man with coronary artery disease was di-
agnosed with metastatic melanoma. Pembrolizumab was
initiated and induced a partial response. The patient de-
veloped myalgia and pain in the shoulder after the 8th
infusion that was responsive to 5 mg of prednisolone.
Four days after the 9th infusion he collapsed while shop-
ping and was immediately resuscitated. He had to be
defibrillated four times, intubated and was put on a res-
pirator in an intensive care unit. Diagnostics including
echocardiogram and coronary angiography showed akin-
esis of the apex, coronary artery disease with no culprit
stenosis and a reduced left ventricular function of 45 %
similar to takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Troponin was ini-
tially increased to 0.454 ng/ml, peaked at 2.86 ng/ml and
was at 0.697 ng/ml two weeks after the incident (normal
range <0.014 ng/ml). CK was 303 U/l upon admittance,
maxed at 1198 U/l (normal range 0–170 U/l) and nor-
malized by day 14. He was treated with high dose sys-
temic corticosteroids (125 mg i.v. for 4 days) and
subsequently recovered. He is currently taking care of
his wife who has dementia in their home and has no
progression of melanoma. Anti-PD1 therapy was not re-
initiated and staging 3 months after the cardiac arrest
without any further tumor therapy showed stabilization
of disease.
Case 8 – Fatal myocarditis
An 80-year-old patient with a previous excision of a pri-
mary melanoma was diagnosed with low-grade non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma. He was followed without treatment
for 2 years before being treated with 4 doses of rituximab

 for splenomegaly and minimal FDG avidity in the bilateral
axillae without lymphadenopathy. One year later, biopsy
of a lung nodule confirmed metastatic melanoma with left
hilar and perihilar masses, as well as paratracheal and sub-
carinal lymphadenopathy and lesions in the rectus muscle
wild-type for BRAF, NRAS, and KIT. At that time he had
no congestive heart failure and hypertension was mild and
well-controlled with one anti-hypertensive. The patient re-
ceived 2 doses of ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg and presented
2 weeks later with congestive heart failure and auto-
immune hepatitis with elevated transaminases and a nega-
tive viral hepatitis panel. He was started on intravenous
methylprednisolone at 1 mg/kg. His left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction was 40 % - 45 % and stage III diastolic dys-
function with restrictive pattern. Congestive heart failure
and hepatotoxicity were attributed to ipilimumab treat-
ment. He was discharged to complete levofloxacin therapy
for possible left lower lobe pneumonia and to continue
prednisone 60 mg by mouth daily.
He was admitted 2–3 days later with shortness of
breath. Chest CT revealed a partial response with de-
crease of pulmonary and mediastinal metastases, but a
new small left pleural effusion. He had atrial fibrillation,
right bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular
block, non-ST elevated myocardial infarction, and ques-
tionable myocarditis. Nuclear stress test showed a fixed
perfusion defect in the anterior wall on both stress and
rest images consistent with prior myocardial infarction
with no reversibility to suggest stress-induced ischemia.
There was hypokinesis of the anterior wall and ejection
fraction was 31 %. He was initiated on carvedilol
3.125 mg twice daily, and to continue clopidogrel, as-
pirin, and lisinopril. Additionally, he received metoprolol
as needed. The significant bilateral lower extremity
edema was treated with furosemide. The patient’s car-
diac enzymes reached a troponin of 11.96, CK-MB of
59.9, and CK of 97. He appeared more dyspneic. EKG
showed atrial fibrillation and a right bundle-branch block
with anterior fascicular block and extensive infarction or
myocarditis. Therefore, dexamethasone 10 mg intravenous
followed by 4 mg every 6 h was administered. The patient
did not tolerate a cardiac MRI. He began decompensating
quickly and his blood pressure dropped precipitously. He
started experiencing ventricular arrhythmias starting with
ventricular tachycardia. He was started on vasopressors
and upon arrival to the intensive care unit, his rhythm
degenerated into ventricular fibrillation and subsequent
asystole and the patient expired.
A post-mortem examination revealed diffuse mottling
of the myocardium most prominent in the left ventricle.
Microscopic examination revealed diffuse myocarditis
with multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, and eosin-
ophils, most prominent in the left ventricle and inter-
ventricular septum.
Discussion
The case series presented here reports on the induction of
cardiotoxicity by ipilimumab and/or anti-PD1 antibodies.
Though such toxicity is rare, multiple manifestations of
immune-related cardiac syndromes can be observed.

 Cardiac fibrosis induced by ipilimumab had been previ-
ously examined by one of our groups [24] and thus
prompted us to screen for cardiac side effects in check-
point inhibitor therapy in six large cancer centers. We
documented cases of autoimmune myocarditis, cardiomy-
opathy, heart failure, cardiac fibrosis and cardiac arrest.
Pre-existent cardiac pathology or peripheral arterial dis-
ease was present in the majority of the patients (5 out of
8). Thus, possibly these cases present a worsening of pre-
vious cardiac disorders. However, all of the patients were
free of symptoms when starting checkpoint inhibitor ther-
apy. Some of the pre-existent conditions had been stable
for decades, i.e. a patient with myocardial infarction
20 years prior to initiating treatment. Corticosteroids im-
proved symptoms when applied. Upon administration of
corticosteroids, one patient experienced rapid improvement
of ejection fraction that was severely reduced to 15 % due
to autoimmune myocarditis. In 5 of the 8 patients (63 %)
other organ systems were also affected by immune-related
side effects including autoimmune thyroiditis, uveitis, col-
itis, hepatitis and hypophysitis. It has previously been re-
ported that two or more organ systems were affected in
7 % of patients treated with ipilimumab and in 31 % treated
with the combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab (Hodi
et al. ASCO 2015; Abstract 9004). Thus, special attention
needs to be focused on patients who have already experi-
enced one immune-related adverse event. There have been
reports with increased response rates and median survival
times in patients with irAE [24]. In this case series, mean
survival was 21 months with the patients surviving the se-
vere side effects showing long-term survival.
This study reports on cardiotoxic effects in patients
that were treated either with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies or
anti-PD1 antibodies. PD-1 is known to protect against
tissue inflammation and myocyte damage. A preclinical
study in two models of myocarditis showed enhanced
disease with increased inflammation and cytotoxic activ-
ity in mice with PD1−/− CD8+ T cells compared to mice
with PD1+/+ CD8+ T cells [28]. PD-1 deficiency has been
described to predispose for spontaneous myocarditis in
mice [29, 30] as well as spontaneous dilated cardiomyop-
athy caused by antibodies to cardiac troponin [31, 32].
CTLA-4 deficient mice are known to rapidly develop
multi-organ lymphocytic infiltration with severe myocar-
ditis [33] and in another murine myocarditis model
CTLA-4−/− cytotoxic T lymphocytes were more patho-
genic than CTLA-4+/+ in inducing myocarditis [34]. Thus,
the cardiotoxic effects induced by checkpoint inhibitors
could be explained by lowering the threshold for activa-
tion of T cells specific for self-antigens in the heart.
Cardiotoxicity has been described with other immuno-
therapies: Cellular based therapies such as autologous
anti-MAGE-A3 T lymphocytes have been associated with
fatalities due to immune reactions towards myocytes. In
these instances, the hypothesized mechanism included
cross-reactivity of high affinity-enhanced T lymphocytes
with unrelated antigens leading to cardiogenic shock and
subsequent death within a few days of infusion of the
engineered T cells [35].
The mechanisms of immune-related adverse events
resulting from checkpoint inhibitor therapy have not
been fully elucidated. For instance, hypophysitis due to
ipilimumab could possibly be explained by the expres-
sion of CTLA-4 in normal pituitary gland as shown in
murine studies [36]. Immune-related adverse events are
typically associated with lymphocyte infiltration of the
affected organ, for example colon or liver. However, pre-
dictive biomarkers that would help to identify which
patients and what organ system is at risk for immune-
related toxicity are lacking.
Checkpoint inhibitor therapy can induce a spectrum
of cardiac side effects. These are rare events – however,
physicians treating patients with checkpoint inhibitors
should be aware of their potentially cardiotoxic effects.
Patients with preexisting cardiac conditions should be
closely monitored for deterioration of heart function.
The prompt and adequate management of cardiac side
effects including application of steroids is critical to
avoid a potentially fatal outcome.
