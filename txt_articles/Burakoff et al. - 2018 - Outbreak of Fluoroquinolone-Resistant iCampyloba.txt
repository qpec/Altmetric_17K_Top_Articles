Outbreak of Fluoroquinolone-Resistant Campylobacter jejuni Infections 
Associated with Raw Milk Consumption from a Herdshare Dairy — Colorado, 2016

In August 2016, a local public health agency (LPHA) notified 
the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment 
(CDPHE) of two culture-confirmed cases of Campylobacter 
infection among persons who consumed raw (unpasteurized) 
milk from the same herdshare dairy. In Colorado, the sale of 
raw milk is illegal; however, herdshare programs, in which a 
member can purchase a share of a herd of cows or goats, are 
legal and are not regulated by state or local authorities. In 
coordination with LPHAs, CDPHE conducted an outbreak 
investigation that identified 12 confirmed and five probable 
cases of Campylobacter jejuni infection. Pulsed-field gel elec-
trophoresis (PFGE) patterns for the 10 cases with available 
isolates were identical using the enzyme Sma. In addition, 
two milk samples (one from the dairy and one obtained from 
an ill shareholder) also tested positive for the outbreak strain. 
Five C. jejuni isolates sent to CDC for antimicrobial suscepti-
bility testing were resistant to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and 
nalidixic acid (1). Although shareholders were notified of the 
outbreak and cautioned against drinking the milk on multiple 
occasions, milk distribution was not discontinued. Although 
its distribution is legal through herdshare programs, drinking 
raw milk is inherently risky (2). The role of public health in 
implementing control measures associated with a product that 
is known to be unsafe remains undefined.
Investigation and Results
On August 23, 2016, El Paso County Public Health notified 
CDPHE of two culture-confirmed cases of C. jejuni infection; 
campylobacteriosis is a reportable disease in Colorado. Both 
patients reported drinking unpasteurized milk from the same 
herdshare dairy in Pueblo County. Since 2005, obtaining 
raw milk by joining a herdshare program has been legal for 
Colorado residents, but selling raw milk is illegal. By purchas-
ing a share of a herd (cows or goats), shareholders are entitled 
to a portion of the raw milk.
Because the prevalence of consuming unpasteurized milk 
is low (2.4% in Colorado, 2006–2007 FoodNet Population 
Survey; 3.1%, 2009 Colorado Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System), two cases of enteric illness with a com-
mon exposure to raw milk are unlikely to occur by chance 
(3,4). In this outbreak, a confirmed case was defined as 
diarrheal illness with onset on or after August 1, 2016, in a 
person with known consumption of unpasteurized milk from 
the same herdshare dairy and culture-confirmed C. jejuni 
infection. A probable case was defined as diarrhea onset on or 
after August 1, lasting 1 or more days, in a person with either 
known consumption of milk from the same herdshare dairy 
or with an epidemiologic link to a confirmed case.
Cases were identified through routine passive reporting 
with follow-up interviews, a Health Alert Network broadcast 
to area providers, and attempts to contact all shareholders. A 
public health order was issued to obtain a list of shareholders 
with their contact information after it was not provided by the 
dairy within 5 days of the initial request. CDPHE attempted 
to contact shareholders to inform them about the outbreak 
and assess possible illness. Up to three calls were made to each 
shareholder household. Epidemiologists contacted laboratories 
to request that isolates from potential outbreak-associated cases 
be forwarded to the state public health laboratory.
Among 91 (53%) of 171 shareholder households that 
responded to requests for follow-up interviews, representing 
207 persons in five or more Colorado counties, 12 confirmed 
and five probable cases were identified (Figure). Among 
confirmed cases, patients ranged in age from 12 to 68 years 
(median = 58 years); nine were male. Duration of illness 
ranged from 3 to >10 days. One hospitalization occurred; 
there were no deaths. In addition to diarrhea, among the 12 
confirmed cases, the majority of patients also experienced fever 
(10), abdominal pain or cramps (eight), headache (eight), and 
myalgia (seven); vomiting and bloody diarrhea were reported 
less frequently (in five and four persons, respectively).
Four milk samples were tested for C. jejuni; pathogen iden-
tification and PFGE were performed on available isolates from 
persons epidemiologically linked to the outbreak. C. jejuni with 
one of two outbreak PFGE patterns (PulseNet DBRS16.0008 
using the enzyme Sma and PulseNet DBRK02.1272 or 
DBRK02.0028 using the enzyme Kpn) was confirmed in 10 
isolates that were available at the public health laboratory and 
two of the four raw milk samples. The National Antimicrobial 
Resistance Monitoring System performed antimicrobial sus-
ceptibility tests on five representative isolates; all were resistant 
to ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid (1).
Public Health Response
Public health responses to this outbreak consisted of notify-
ing shareholders about the outbreak on three occasions (Figure) 
and requiring the dairy to provide additional written notifica-
tion about the outbreak at milk distribution points. A press

release was issued by two LPHAs (Figure) in response to detect-
ing at least one infection in a person who was not a shareholder 
but was given milk by shareholders. In addition, a number 
of shareholders reported sharing milk with nonshareholders 
who might have been unaware of the outbreak. Although milk 
sample results were positive for C. jejuni, CDPHE did not 
close the dairy or stop distribution of its milk because without 
pasteurization CDPHE could not create standards for safely 
reopening the dairy (5). Shareholders were, however, urged to 
discard raw milk distributed since August 1 and were reminded 
that Colorado statute prohibits redistribution of raw milk.
Discussion
Raw milk from a herdshare dairy was the source of this 
outbreak of C. jejuni infections, and the investigation high-
lighted the difficulties inherent in addressing an outbreak 
related to unpasteurized milk from a herdshare dairy. During 
three previous herdshare-associated outbreaks in Colorado, 
public health authorities temporarily took action to stop milk 
distribution until a series of negative tests were obtained from 
the milk (Alicia Cronquist, CDPHE, personal communica-
tion, December 2017). However, because CDPHE could not 
ensure that unpasteurized milk would be safe in the future, the 
decision was made not to close the dairy during this outbreak. 
In addition, CDPHE’s Division of Environmental Health and 
Sustainability chose not to make formal recommendations on 
the dairy’s processes because no protocol improvements short 
of pasteurization could ensure the product’s safety, even with 
improved sanitation (5).
All tested isolates’ resistance to three antibiotics was concern-
ing, particularly as fluoroquinolones are frequently used to 
treat Campylobacter infections in those cases where treatment 
is indicated. Treatment of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter 
infections might be more difficult, of longer duration, and 
possibly lead to more severe illness than treatment of nonre-
sistant Campylobacter infections (6–8). In 2015, approximately 
25.3% of U.S. C. jejuni isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 
an increase from 21.6% a decade earlier (1).
In collaboration with LPHAs, CDPHE is creating guidelines 
to address future outbreaks related to raw milk from herdshares. 
As more states legalize the sale or other distribution of unpas-
teurized milk, the number of associated outbreaks will likely 
increase (9,10). The role of public health in responding to raw 
milk–related outbreaks should be further defined. State-level 
guidelines might assist with this process.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Raw (unpasteurized) milk has been linked to many foodborne 
illnesses, including Campylobacter infections. In some states, 
including Colorado, it is legal to distribute unpasteurized milk 
through herdshare programs. Studies indicate that legalizing the 
sale of raw milk leads to more raw milk–associated outbreaks.
What is added by this report?
Although sale of raw milk is not legal in Colorado, herdshare 
programs, in which members may purchase a share of a herd of 
cows or goats, are legal and are not regulated by state or local 
authorities. During August–October 2016, 12 confirmed and five 
probable cases of Campylobacter jejuni infections were identified 
in persons who consumed raw milk from a herdshare dairy in 
Colorado. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis identified the outbreak 
pattern in patients’ stools and two milk samples. Shareholders 
were notified about the outbreak, but the dairy was not ordered 
to close. This report highlights the public health challenges of 
addressing a high-risk product that is not regulated.
What are the implications for public health practice?
In states where distribution of raw milk from herdshares is legal, 
outbreaks associated with raw milk will likely continue to be a 
problem. The role of public health in implementing control 
measures associated with a product that is known to be unsafe 
should be further defined. State level guidelines might assist 
with this process.
