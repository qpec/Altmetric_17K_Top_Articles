ABSTRACT
Myocardial injury is common in patients without acute
coronary syndrome, and international guidelines
recommend patients with myocardial infarction are
classified by aetiology. The universal definition
differentiates patients with myocardial infarction due to
plaque rupture (type 1) from those due to myocardial
oxygen supply-demand imbalance (type 2) secondary to
other acute illnesses. Patients with myocardial necrosis,
but no symptoms or signs of myocardial ischaemia, are
classified as acute or chronic myocardial injury. This
classification has not been widely adopted in practice,
because the diagnostic criteria for type 2 myocardial
infarction encompass a wide range of presentations, and
the implications of the diagnosis are uncertain. However,
both myocardial injury and type 2 myocardial infarction
are common, occurring in more than one-third of all
hospitalised patients. These patients have poor short-
term and long-term outcomes with two-thirds dead in
5 years. The classification of patients with myocardial
infarction continues to evolve, and future guidelines are
likely to recognise the importance of identifying coronary
artery disease in type 2 myocardial infarction. Clinicians
should consider whether coronary artery disease has
contributed to myocardial injury, as selected patients are
likely to benefit from further investigation and in these
patients targeted secondary prevention has the potential
to improve outcomes.
INTRODUCTION
The definition of acute myocardial infarction has
evolved
to
accommodate
increasingly
sensitive
markers
of
myocardial
necrosis
and
imaging
methods that allow greater understanding of the
pathogenic mechanisms of acute coronary syn-
drome. As such, the universal definition of myocar-
dial infarction proposes that we classify patients
with myocardial infarction based on aetiology.1
While this classification has been used in clinical
trials to refine primary and secondary endpoints,2–4
it has not been widely adopted in clinical practice,
and the frequency and implications of subtypes of
acute myocardial infarction are uncertain.
W
e now recognise a spectrum of acute and
chronic myocardial injury due to a variety of
cardiac and non-cardiac causes in clinical practice.
The most contentious diagnosis is that of type 2
myocardial infarction, which is defined as myocar-
dial necrosis with evidence of ischaemia due to
myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance in
the context of another acute illness. Differentiating
between patients with type 2 myocardial infarction
and those patients with myocardial necrosis in the
absence of ischaemia, in whom the recommended
classification is myocardial injury, is challenging, as
there is considerable overlap between these two
clinical entities.5 Outcomes for both groups of
patients are poor, and investigation and manage-
ment are inconsistent in practice.6 It is likely that
this
is
at
least
in
part
due
to variability
in
interpretation of the guidelines.
Here, we summarise the available literature on
the prevalence and outcomes of subtypes of myo-
cardial injury and infarction, and aim to provide
practical guidance for the clinician to aid the assess-
ment and investigation of patients with undifferen-
tiated myocardial injury.
BIOCHEMICAL QUANTIFICATION OF
MYOCARDIAL INJURY
Cardiac troponin is the only recommended bio-
marker for the detection of myocardial necrosis,
and it is integral to the diagnostic criteria for myo-
cardial
infarction.1
Our
ability
to
accurately
measure cardiac troponin has improved through
the development of more sensitive assays, with the
latest generation high-sensitivity assays capable of
detecting cardiac troponin concentrations in the
majority of healthy individuals. This has allowed
accurate identification of the normal reference
range and the 99th centile upper reference limit.7–9
The universal definition has recommended the
99th centile as the diagnostic threshold for acute
myocardial infarction since 2007, with a rise or fall
in cardiac troponin concentrations necessary to
confirm the diagnosis1 Improvements in assay pre-
cision have identified differences in cardiac tropo-
nin concentrations between men and women, with
the 99th centile twofold lower in women than men
across a range of assays.7 The use of high-sensitivity
cardiac
troponin
and
sex-specific
99th
centile
upper reference limits increases the diagnosis of
myocardial injury and infarction, particularly in
women, and identifies a high-risk group of patients
with poor outcomes.8
There is now widespread adoption of cardiac
troponin assays in clinical practice across Europe,
with >95% of laboratories using cardiac troponin
as the preferred marker for the diagnosis of myo-
cardial infarction.10 Over 50% of European labora-
tories use the 99th centile upper reference limit as
the diagnostic threshold; however, as it is 3 years
since this survey was undertaken, the proportion
today is likely to be higher, given the widespread
availability
of
high-sensitivity
cardiac
troponin
assays and their prominence in national guidelines.
Recent studies have demonstrated that cardiac
troponin concentrations below the 99th centile can
help in the risk stratification of patients with sus-
pected acute coronary syndrome.1 8 11–14 As such,

 guidelines include additional pathways incorporating lower
thresholds of cardiac troponin for risk stratification and earlier
testing.15 W
e recently demonstrate in consecutive patients with
suspected
acute
coronary syndrome
that
a
high-sensitivity
cardiac troponin I concentration <5 ng/L at presentation had a
negative predictive value of 99.6% (95% CI 99.3 to 99.8) for
myocardial infarction during the index presentation, or myocar-
dial infarction or cardiac death in 30 days.16 Furthermore,
patients with troponin concentrations <5 ng/L at presentation
had very low rates of adverse cardiac events in 1 year, compared
with those with ≥5 ng/L but <99th centile.16 These observa-
tions now form the basis of our clinical pathway for the assess-
ment of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.17
The use of cardiac troponin testing in clinical practice is evolv-
ing rapidly with cardiac troponin concentrations increasingly
used as a continuous measure of cardiovascular risk, rather than
simply a binary test to identify those patients with and without
myocardial infarction.16
CLASSIFICATION OF MYOCARDIAL INJURY AND
INFARCTION
The introduction of more sensitive cardiac troponin assays and
lower diagnostic thresholds led to a major revision of the guide-
lines introducing a classification by aetiology to acknowledge
that myocardial injury occurs in a wide range of clinical presen-
tations (figure 1). The third universal definition of myocardial
infarction provided an international consensus on the classifica-
tion of myocardial injury and infarction.1 The diagnosis of myo-
cardial infarction requires evidence of myocardial necrosis in a
clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischaemia.
These criteria require detection of a rise and/or fall in cardiac
biomarker levels (preferably cardiac troponin) with at least one
value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, with at
least one
of
the
following:
(1)
symptoms
of myocardial
ischaemia, (2) new or presumed new significant ST-segment
T-wave changes or new left bundle branch block, (3) develop-
ment of pathological Q-waves on the electrocardiogram, (4)
imaging evidence of loss of viable myocardium or new regional
wall motion abnormality or (5) identification of intracoronary
thrombus by angiography or autopsy.
The classification distinguishes between type 1 myocardial
infarction due to thrombosis of an atherosclerotic plaque and
type 2 myocardial infarction due to myocardial oxygen supply-
demand imbalance in the context of another acute illness.1
Myocardial infarctions presenting as sudden death (type 3), or
after percutaneous coronary intervention (type 4) and coronary
artery bypass grafting (type 5) are also defined. Acute myocar-
dial injury is classified where troponin concentrations are ele-
vated with evidence of dynamic change in the absence of overt
myocardial ischaemia, whereas in chronic myocardial injury
troponin concentrations remain unchanged on serial testing.
This is an important distinction, as the underlying pathological
mechanisms in acute and chronic myocardial injury are likely to
differ.
This classification is contentious and was based on expert
consensus rather than evidence from prospective clinical trials.
While it has been adopted in research studies, implementation
in clinical practice has been less consistent. The most conten-
tious diagnosis is that of type 2 myocardial infarction; a concept
based on clinical hypothesis and observation without prospect-
ive mechanistic evaluation. Patients classified with type 2 myocar-
dial infarction are heterogeneous and have myocardial ischaemia
secondary to a variety of acute medical or surgical conditions.
Based on the current criteria, a diagnosis of type 2 myocardial
infarction could be applied to patients without coronary artery
disease. At present, there is no guidance or consensus on the
optimal cardiac investigation, management or treatment strategy
for patients with type 2 myocardial infarction.

 The global task force is reviewing the universal definition of
myocardial infarction and recognises the need to provide clearer
diagnostic criteria and guidance.18 Based on the current guide-
lines, differentiating between patients with type 2 myocardial
infarction and acute myocardial injury is challenging as there
remains overlap between these two clinical entities, and classifi-
cation is therefore inconsistent in clinical practice.19 20 Similarly,
in the absence of an accepted definition, it is difficult to
perform standardised evaluations across different healthcare set-
tings, or to conduct randomised trials to determine the effect-
iveness of investigative strategies or preventative treatments for
these patients.
MECHANISMS OF MYOCARDIAL INJURY
The majority of cardiac troponin is intracellular, with >90% of
troponin isoforms located within the sarcomere, and the
remainder
unbound
within
the
cytoplasmic
pool.21
The
mechanisms of cardiac troponin release into the circulation are
thought to include myocyte necrosis, apoptosis, formation and
release of membranous blebs, increased membrane permeability
and release of proteolytic troponin degradation products.21
It is now recognised that cardiac troponin may be released
out with the context of myocardial ischaemia and necrosis, with
several purported mechanisms. Cardiomyocytes undergo mech-
anical stretch in response to pressure or volume overload, and
this may trigger activation of intracellular proteases associated
with intracellular degradation of troponin.22 Furthermore, there
is evidence that tachycardia may stimulate stress-responsive
integrins within the cardiomyocyte, triggering release of intact
cardiac troponin I from viable cardiomyocytes in the absence of
necrosis.23 Troponin release has also been demonstrated in vivo
in patients who develop reversible ischaemia during nuclear per-
fusion imaging with stress testing. Using an ultrasensitive cardiac
troponin I assay with single-molecule counting technology,
change in cardiac troponin concentration following stress testing
was associated with the extent of myocardial ischaemia.24
The universal definition makes a distinction between type 2
myocardial infarction and myocardial injury based on the pres-
ence or absence of symptoms and signs of myocardial ischaemia;
however, there remains considerable overlap and to date there
have been no prospective mechanistic studies to evaluate the
range of underlying pathophysiology in these patients. Acute
myocardial injury may occur in a variety of cardiac and
non-cardiac illnesses (table 1) as a consequence of myocardial
oxygen supply-demand mismatch (hypotension, tachycardia or
hypoxaemia), or due to direct injury in sepsis or viral myocardi-
tis, or as part of the pathophysiological process in acute left ven-
tricular failure. However, in some cases the presenting illness
may be associated with a proinflammatory and prothrombotic
state with myocardial injury due to embolisation of platelet
aggregates and thrombus from an otherwise silent vulnerable
plaque. Furthermore, myocardial injury can occur due to myo-
cardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch in the presence of
prognostically important, but unrecognised stable coronary
artery disease. It is not, therefore, appropriate to dismiss epi-
sodes of acute myocardial injury as a mere bystander phenom-
enon of no clinical consequence.
Chronic myocardial injury may occur in structural heart
disease (hypertensive heart disease, ischaemic or dilated cardio-
myopathy) or secondary to other non-cardiac illnesses such as
chronic renal failure. As an example, the detection of chronic
myocardial injury may be clinically useful in valvular heart
disease, with serum cardiac troponin I concentrations associated
with cardiac mass, replacement fibrosis and prognosis in patients
with aortic stenosis.25 The presence of chronic elevations in
cardiac troponin associated with these conditions may contrib-
ute to diagnostic uncertainty in patients with suspected acute
coronary syndrome. In recognition of this European guidelines
for patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarc-
tion only recommends invasive management where a relative
change in cardiac troponin concentration of at least 20% can be
demonstrated, or where there is at least a fivefold elevation in
cardiac troponin concentrations above the 99th centile on
presentation.15 26
INCIDENCE OF MYOCARDIAL INJURY AND TYPE 2
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
The introduction of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays and
lower diagnostic thresholds into clinical practice is likely to
result in a disproportionate increase in the number of patients
with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury com-
pared with type 1 myocardial infarction,8 26 and may lead to
diagnostic uncertainty with the potential for over treatment in
patients who do not have acute coronary syndrome.27–29
The majority of studies have not used high-sensitivity cardiac
troponin assays and therefore may underrecognise the incidence

 of myocardial injury and type 2 myocardial infarction. The
largest reported registry to date was published by Baron et al,30
who assessed all patients with acute myocardial infarction
admitted to hospital in Sweden during 2011 (n=20,138).
All diagnoses were classified by the attending clinician, with
88.5% of patients classified as type 1 myocardial infarction and
7.1% as type 2 myocardial infarction. Of note, the frequency of
diagnosis of type 2 myocardial infarction varied markedly
between centres (0–13%), perhaps illustrating the challenge of
consistently applying the current diagnostic classification. In
studies which classified all patients with elevated cardiac tropo-
nin concentrations, the reported incidence of type 2 myocardial
infarction varies between 2% and 37% in unselected hospita-
lised patients, and from 5% to 71% in patients attending the
Emergency Department (table 2).2 4 31–40
Differences
in
the
reported
incidence
may
in
part
be
explained by the inconsistent approach to distinguishing type 2
myocardial infarction from acute and chronic myocardial injury
across studies. It is perhaps unsurprising that the diagnosis of
type 2 myocardial infarction is less frequent in selected popula-
tions with acute coronary syndrome.
A previous study at our centre evaluated all patients with
elevated plasma cardiac troponin concentrations irrespective
of presenting complaint (n=2165), admitted during the valid-
ation and implementation of a contemporary sensitive cardiac
troponin I assay.6 The frequency of type 1 myocardial infarc-
tion, type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury was
54%, 20% and 24%, respectively. W
e demonstrated type 2 myo-
cardial infarction and myocardial injury were as common as
type 1 myocardial infarction in clinical practice, and indeed
more common than type 1 myocardial infarction in patients
≥75 years of age (figure 2). Lowering the diagnostic threshold
with a more sensitive cardiac troponin assay reduced recurrent
myocardial infarction or death in patients redefined as having
type 1 myocardial infarction, but more than doubled the
number of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myo-
cardial injury. Despite undergoing additional cardiac investiga-
tions, this did not result in changes in treatment, and there was
no improvement in clinical outcomes.6
Whether adoption of high-sensitivity troponin assays and the
99th centile for diagnosis of myocardial infarction translates
into improvements in clinical outcomes for patients with sus-
pected acute coronary syndrome is being evaluated in a stepped
wedge cluster randomised trial across Scotland (High-STEACS,
NCT: 01852123). If increased sensitivity does not impinge on
specificity for the diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction,
then these assays will improve patient outcomes through better
targeting of therapies for coronary artery disease. However, if
increased sensitivity leads to poor specificity, then patients may
be misdiagnosed and given inappropriate cardiac medications
with potentially detrimental outcomes. This trial will establish
whether the introduction of high-sensitivity assays into routine
clinical practice is detrimental or beneficial to patient manage-
ment and outcomes; a fundamental and critical assessment for
the modern definition of acute myocardial infarction.
OUTCOMES OF MYOCARDIAL INJURY AND TYPE 2
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION
Patients with type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury
have poor clinical outcomes, worse than those patients with
type 1 myocardial infarction, with one in three patients dead at
1 year.6 In a prospective study of patients with acute coronary
syndrome (n=2818), Stein et al found an increased risk of
death in those with an adjudicated diagnosis of type 2 versus
type 1 myocardial infarction at 30 days (13.6% vs 4.9%,
p<0.0001) and at 1 year (23.9% vs 8.6%, p<0.0001).31
Another single-centre study by El-Haddad reported mortality
rates 6.9 times greater in type 2 versus type 1 myocardial infarc-
tion at 1 year.32
Sarkisian et al reviewed 3762 patients who underwent cardiac
troponin testing on clinical indication. Patients with acute myo-
cardial injury were at significantly greater risk of all-cause mor-
tality than those with myocardial infarction at a median
follow-up of 3.2 years (59% vs 39%, p<0.0001 by log-rank
test). In a subgroup analysis, they demonstrate no difference in
risk for all-cause mortality between patients with type 2 myocar-
dial infarction or myocardial injury (adjusted hazard ratio (HR)
1.28, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.65).41 More recently, we extended
follow-up in our cohort of consecutive unselected hospital inpa-
tients,6 demonstrating 60% of patients with type 2 myocardial
infarction and 75% of patients with myocardial injury were
dead at 5 years.42 Whether it is possible to improve outcomes in
these patients through therapeutic intervention is currently
unknown.
The distinction between type 2 myocardial infarction and
myocardial injury may, however, be clinically important, as it
has been demonstrated that patients classified as having a type 2
myocardial infarction are twice as likely as those with myocar-
dial injury to be readmitted with a type 1 myocardial infarction
in 1 year.6 This potentially important observation suggests that a
proportion of patients with type 2 myocardial infarction may
benefit from further investigation and treatment for coronary
artery disease. Selection of patients for further investigation
requires a greater understanding of the clinical features that
identify those patients at increased risk of future acute coronary
events and a better understanding of the mechanisms of myocar-
dial injury in this setting.
PRAGMATIC CLASSIFICATION OF PATIENTS WITH
MYOCARDIAL INJURY AND INFARCTION
W
e believe there remains scope for clarification of the diagnostic
criteria for type 2 myocardial infarction and myocardial injury
and that this is necessary to encourage clinicians to adopt the
classification proposed in the universal definition. This clinical
classification acknowledges the central role of coronary artery
disease in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction.
‘Acute myocardial injury’ is a term that clinicians are likely to
accept, analogous to ‘acute kidney injury’ or ‘acute liver injury’,
and does not predicate the mechanism of injury. This term
should embrace all patients with acute myocardial injury identi-
fied in the context of an alternative acute illness, including those
patients with chest pain or evidence of myocardial ischemia. The
mechanism of myocardial injury will determine whether any
cardiac or coronary investigations or therapies are indicated.
For example, while a patient with a submassive pulmonary
embolism and an elevation in cardiac troponin may have both
chest pain and an abnormal electrocardiogram, a diagnosis of
type 2 myocardial infarction is unhelpful. The diagnosis is pul-
monary embolism and acute myocardial injury due to hypoxia
or right ventricular strain; coronary investigations and second-
ary prevention are not indicated.
The term type 2 myocardial infarction should, in our
opinion, be used exclusively in patients with acute myocardial
injury where coronary artery disease has contributed and where
there may be opportunities to improve outcomes through coron-
ary revascularisation or medical therapy. Selection of patients
with acute myocardial injury for further investigation will

ently elevated cardiac troponin concentrations. The subsequent
development of chest pain and ischaemic changes on the elec-
trocardiogram with a temporal rise in serum cardiac troponin
concentrations may be due to hypoxia, tachycardia or hypoten-
sion, with the acute illness representing a ‘physiological stress
test’ identifying otherwise quiescent stable coronary artery
disease. The initial diagnosis is ‘acute myocardial injury’, and
the need for further investigation for coronary artery disease
should be guided by an assessment of cardiovascular risk. In
patients with a low probability of coronary artery disease,
further cardiac investigations may not be necessary. In patients
with an intermediate or high probability, imaging to identify
those with coronary artery disease should be considered. Should
these investigations confirm the presence of coronary artery
disease without evidence of plaque rupture, the diagnosis of
type 2 myocardial infarction would be appropriate and second-
ary prevention should be considered.
Until prospective studies have been performed that define the
mechanism of myocardial injury in consecutive patients present-
ing with an alternative acute illness, clinicians will need to rely
on clinical judgement to evaluate the likelihood of coronary
artery disease.
ALGORITHM FOR THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION OF
PATIENTS WITH ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INJURY
W
e propose a simple decision framework for the initial investi-
gation strategy to determine the aetiology of myocardial injury
and identify those with coronary artery disease who may benefit
from secondary prevention (figure 3).
Patients presenting with isolated symptoms or signs of myo-
cardial ischaemia should be assessed using established pathways
for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (figure 4).

 Appropriate diagnostic and risk stratification thresholds will
differ depending on the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assay
in use.
Those who develop symptoms and signs of myocardial ischae-
mia in the context of another acute illness should undergo serial
high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing. Patients should be clas-
sified with either acute or chronic myocardial injury based on
a change in cardiac troponin concentration, ideally using
assay-specific absolute delta criteria. In the absence of these cri-
teria, those with troponin concentrations ≤99th centile at pres-
entation with an increase of >50% of the 99th centile upper
reference limit on serial testing (and at least one value >99th
centile) are considered to have acute myocardial injury. Where
troponin concentrations are >99th centile at presentation, a
relative change of >20% is consistent with acute injury.26 In
patients who meet these criteria, careful clinical assessment is
required to determine the likelihood of coronary artery disease.
There are no dedicated risk assessment tools for use in this
setting, and therefore this assessment relies on clinical judge-
ment, review of the presenting symptoms, medical history, car-
diovascular risk factors and serial 12-lead electrocardiographic
findings. There is an unmet need for novel risk prediction
scores or validation of existing tools, such as the GRACE score,
to guide clinicians when assessing patients with acute myocar-
dial injury.
Those patients known to have coronary artery disease may
not require further investigation if the mechanism of acute myo-
cardial injury is secondary to oxygen supply-demand mismatch.
This may occur in a wide range of conditions where there has
been a sustained period of hypotension, tachycardia or hypox-
aemia. However, where there is no evidence of oxygen supply-
demand mismatch, invasive coronary angiography should be
considered to determine whether acute myocardial injury is a
consequence of plaque rupture or thrombosis. Where type 1
myocardial infarction is confirmed, application of the GRACE
score
confers
important
prognostic
information.15
Those
without known coronary artery disease should be considered
for invasive or CT coronary angiography. Where obstructive cor-
onary artery disease is identified and oxygen supply-demand
imbalance has been documented, the diagnosis of type 2 myo-
cardial infarction may be helpful and patients should be consid-
ered
for
secondary
prevention.
Those
patients
without
obstructive coronary artery disease have acute myocardial injury
as a consequence of their presenting illness.
Patients with persistently elevated cardiac troponin concentra-
tions without a rise and/or fall on serial sampling are likely to
have chronic myocardial injury, which may be due to both
cardiac and non-cardiac pathologies. In patients not known to
have structural heart disease or a condition known to cause
myocardial injury, clinical review should consider whether struc-
tural heart disease is likely and guide the need for further
cardiac imaging such as echocardiography or cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging.
CONCLUSIONS
The implementation of more sensitive troponin assays in clinical
practice has increased our awareness of the spectrum of both
acute and chronic myocardial injury. While the universal defin-
ition classifies myocardial infarction by aetiology, inconsistency
in the interpretation and application of these guidelines may be
impacting on patient care and outcomes. Identifying patients
with acute or chronic myocardial injury, and defining the mech-
anism of injury is a necessary first step. Careful clinical assess-
ment is necessary to guide the need for further investigations
and to identify those patients with coronary artery disease and
type 2 myocardial infarction who may benefit from preventative
therapies.
