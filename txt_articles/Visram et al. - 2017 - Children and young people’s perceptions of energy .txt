Abstract
Background
Consumption of soft drinks is declining in many countries, yet energy drink sales continue to
increase, particularly amongst young consumers. Little is currently known about the drivers
behind these trends. Energy drinks are high in sugar and caffeine, and evidence indicates
that regular or heavy use by under 18s is likely to be detrimental to health. This study aimed
to explore children and young people’s attitudes and perceptions in relation to energy drinks
in a UK context.
Methods
Eight focus groups were conducted with pupils aged 10–11 years (n = 20) and 13–14 years
(n = 17) from four schools in northern England. A sub-sample also took part in a mapping
exercise to generate further insights. Data were analysed using the constant comparative
approach.
Results
Energy drinks were reportedly consumed in a variety of public and private places, generally
linked to social activities, sports and computer gaming (particularly amongst boys). Partici-
pants demonstrated strong brand awareness and preferences that were linked to taste and
perceived value for money. The relatively low price of energy drinks and their widespread
availability were identified as key factors, along with gendered branding and marketing.
Some participants demonstrated a critical approach to manufacturers’ claims and many
were keen to become better informed, often through school- or peer-based interventions.
Other potential interventions included age restrictions, voluntary schemes involving retailers
and improved labelling.
Conclusions
The lack of a single dominant factor in participants’ consumption choices suggests that
there is unlikely to be a ‘silver bullet’ in attempting to address this issue. However, the

manufacturers and retailers as well as consumers, and actively involve children and young
people where possible.
Introduction
Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) by children and young people (C&YP) is a
growing public health concern. This is due to the long-term implications associated with
excessive sugar intake, which include dental erosion, weight gain and the development of obe-
sity and type 2 diabetes [1]. Evidence from the UK indicates that consumption of SSBs is high-
est amongst those aged 13 to 18 years, both in relative and absolute terms (548 KJ or 41% of
energy intake), in comparison with adults and younger children [2]. Consumption of SSBs
increased throughout the 20th century in high income countries such as the UK, USA and Aus-
tralia, but is now declining due to consumer concerns over added sugars [3]. Energy drinks
(EDs), which are characterised by their high caffeine content (>150mg per litre), represent
one category of SSB that has not followed this trend. Sales of EDs in the UK increased by 185%
between 2006 and 2015, equating to 672 million litres consumed in 2015 and a total market
value of over £2 billion [4]. The global EDs market, worth $50 billion, is projected to grow at
an annual rate of 3.5% until at least 2020 [5]. Several low- and no-sugar ED varieties have been
launched but their caffeine content remains high. Furthermore, high-sugar varieties still
remain popular and represent one of the main sectors driving growth for the soft drinks indus-
try as a whole [3].
Evidence suggests that regular or heavy ED use is likely to be detrimental to C&YP in the
short- and long-term [6, 7]. Correlational studies have identified links with common health
complaints such as headaches, stomach aches and sleeping problems, which increase in preva-
lence with greater ED use [8, 9]. There is also strong evidence that youth ED consumption
clusters with other health-damaging behaviours, including binge drinking, smoking, illicit
drug use, screen time and poor dietary behaviours [10–13]. There have been calls to restrict
the sale of EDs in recognition that childhood and adolescence are periods of rapid growth and
brain development, when adequate sleep and good nutrition are especially important [6].
However, these drinks are increasingly popular amongst young consumers. A 2011 survey
conducted across 16 European Union (EU) countries found that prevalence of ED consump-
tion was highest amongst 10 to 18-year-olds (68%, compared with 30% of adults and 18% of
younger children) [14]. Furthermore, this age group in the UK consumed more EDs on aver-
age than their counterparts in other EU countries (3.1 litres per month, compared with 2
litres). Recent analysis of international sales data indicated that sales of EDs rose sharply
between 2010 and 2015, and that the UK had the second highest rate of ED sales per head glob-
ally [15]. Little is currently known about the drivers behind these trends.
Quantitative, survey-based research suggests that C&YP tend not to differentiate between
energy and isotonic/sports drinks, and that they consume both for reasons that include taste,
to quench their thirst, and to improve sports performance [16–18]. Many of these studies have
been conducted in North America or the Middle East, highlighting a need for further research
to explore potential differences in motivations, experiences and expectations amongst C&YP
from different geographies. The aforementioned European survey found that C&YP consume
EDs at home, during sport and exercise, and at parties [14]. However, less is known about
where and how they obtain these drinks. A separate body of literature exists in relation to

 consumption of EDs by young adults, often examining the experiences of university or college
students [19–21]. Much of this literature focuses on co-consumption with alcohol (AmED)
and generally finds that this behaviour is associated with a range of negative outcomes, which
in many cases are worse than those associated with ED or alcohol consumption alone [22–24].
AmED consumption amongst young adults appears to be motivated by hedonistic tendencies,
as well as being linked to societal norms of masculinity [25, 26].
Qualitative research on this topic is limited. Four published studies–all conducted in Aus-
tralia or New Zealand–have examined ED consumption by C&YP [27–30]. Of these, one also
involved over 18s, one explored use of EDs pre-mixed with alcohol, and another examined use
of various nutritional supplements (of which EDs were one category). Further in-depth
research is needed to understand the motivations of C&YP in the UK (without the emphasis
on co-consumption with alcohol) given that, on average, they consume EDs more often and in
higher quantities than those in many other countries [14]. The aims of this study were to
explore the attitudes and perceptions of C&YP in relation to EDs, and to seek their views on
possible intervention options. The study had the following research questions:
1. Why, when and how do some C&YP choose to consume EDs, and why do others choose to
abstain?
2. Where, from whom and at what cost do C&YP obtain EDs?
3. What are the implications of these findings for policy and practice?
Material and methods
Procedure
A data-driven qualitative study design was chosen to meet the study aims and research ques-
tions. The study involved C&YP and researchers working in partnership to combine knowl-
edge and action on EDs, thereby drawing on the principles of co-production and community-
based participatory research (CBPR) [31]. The design was informed by guidelines for ethical
research with C&YP [32]. The study received ethical approval from the School of Medicine,
Pharmacy and Health Research Ethics Sub-Committee at Durham University (ref. ESC2/2014/
08).
Participants
A pragmatic approach was taken in drawing the study population from localities suggested by
the project advisory group, which comprised local health, education and community engage-
ment practitioners as well as the research team. Eight schools in County Durham, northern
England, were approached and four (two primary and two secondary) agreed to take part in
the study. All were situated in areas characterised by relatively high levels of socio-economic
deprivation. Students from Year 6 (aged 10–11 years) and Year 9 (aged 13–14 years) were
recruited to the study via their class teachers or form tutors. These age groups were chosen
based on team members’ experience of conducting similar studies with school-age C&YP, cou-
pled with advice from the project advisory group. Year 6 is a key transition year between pri-
mary and secondary school in the UK, whereas Year 9 is arguably the final year before the
pressures and workload of significant exams begin (and when fewer students are likely to have
begun experimenting with alcohol). Preliminary discussions with school staff and a local par-
ent group also indicated that ED consumption was perceived to be a growing problem
amongst both age groups.

 Teachers were encouraged either to randomly select potential participants or, if they felt
this was not appropriate, to select diverse groups of students (i.e. with different levels of educa-
tional attainment). Up to five boys and five girls from each class were chosen and provided
with age-appropriate study information packs to consider before deciding whether or not to
take part. All participants gave their written informed consent to take part in the study.
Parents/carers were provided with separate information and invited to opt-out of the study by
reply. A non-response was taken as indication of assent for their child to take part, in an effort
to reduce potential biases associated with an opt-in approach.
Data collection
The primary mode of data collection involved semi-structured focus groups, conducted (by
SJC and MC) using a topic guide developed to address the research questions (Box 1). The
benefits of this method included the explicit use of group interaction to produce additional
data and insights [33, 34]. Potential risks included participants seeking to impress their peers
or the researchers by either exaggerating or understating their level of ED use; therefore, they
were asked to talk generally about ED consumption amongst their classmates rather than their
own experiences. Single-sex groups were conducted, based on guidance from the literature
[35] and team members’ experience of research involving similar age groups. The format was
kept flexible and informal to enhance comfort and foster openness. The focus groups began
with a sorting exercise (using empty cans and bottles of EDs, isotonic/sports drinks and soft
drinks) to generate discussion on the participants’ understandings of the differences between
these drinks. The groups lasted between 20 and 45 minutes and were held on school premises,
during school hours, without school staff present. All discussions were audio-recorded with
participants’ consent.
The study also involved a mapping exercise conducted by a sub-sample of participants (2–4
from each school). Three of the four schools permitted their students to take part in this

 exercise, which involved spending up to one hour walking around the local area (accompanied
by at least one researcher and a member of school staff) to identify outlets where EDs could be
purchased. The purpose was to involve C&YP in the process of generating data, enabling them
to gain basic research skills and allowing the research team to gain greater insight into the
availability and accessibility of EDs. A template was designed to record the location, brands,
prices and sizes of the drinks available, as well as the price and availability of other beverages
(isotonic/sports drinks, soft drinks and water), based on earlier food environment work [36].
Photographs were taken, inside or outside shops, where appropriate. See Fig 1 for an example.
Data analysis
The focus group recordings were transcribed verbatim, anonymised and analysed using the
constant comparative approach, which meant that themes were generated inductively using a
data-driven approach as opposed to applying an a priori coding framework informed by previ-
ous research or driven by existing theory [37]. NVivo qualitative analysis software v.10 was

 used to systematically organise and index materials. Initial analysis of four focus groups was
undertaken (SJC and MC) to identify emerging themes from the data; primary codes were
identified and then discussed with the wider research team. Themes were checked and further
codes identified following subsequent analysis. Preliminary findings were discussed with the
advisory group, to obtain feedback on the researchers’ interpretations and to generate further
discussion on the implications for policy and practice.
Marketing rapidly emerged as a key theme and therefore the marketing mix was applied
towards the end of the analytical process as a framework to better understand drivers for con-
suming EDs [38]. Often referred to as ‘the four Ps’–product, price, place and promotion–the
marketing mix is central to the planning and implementation of integrated marketing strategies.
This framework has been adapted from the commercial sector in planning social marketing
programmes that seek to achieve behavioural goals for social good [39, 40]. In the present study,
three additional Ps–peers, parents/carers and policy–emerged through the analytical process,
and the data were subsequently categorised according to this conceptual framework (Table 1).
Results
A total of 37 C&YP consented to participate in the study (19 males and 18 females; 20 aged 10–
11 years and 17 aged 13–14 years). Findings relating to each element of our enhanced marketing
mix are reported in turn below, illustrated using direct quotations from the participants.
Product
Participants in both age groups appeared to have a good level of knowledge about certain
aspects of EDs, including brand names, key ingredients and some of the potential risks associ-
ated with consumption. However, there were areas where confusion and uncertainty were evi-
dent. The high caffeine content was often highlighted as a defining characteristic of EDs, but
there appeared to be less understanding of what constituted high levels of caffeine or sugar:

 There’s more sugar in them [points to ED] than what’s in them [points to sports drink],
because there’s about 10 spoons of sugar I think in them. (Girl, 13–14 years)
Some younger kids they read [the label] but say they don’t know what. . . 4.8 sugars mean.
They don’t know what it means–like, is that a lot or is it not a lot? (Girl, 10–11 years)
It was suggested that information about sugar and caffeine content could be presented on
EDs in ways that are easier for C&YP to understand; for example, in spoonfuls of sugar. Other
suggestions included using plain English on packaging (instead of unfamiliar terms like
insomnia), featuring a ‘Think before you drink’ sign, or making the text about potential health
risks more visible:
Girl 1: I think they should just make it bigger writing.
Girl 2: Make it more in your face. . . Like eye-catching. (Exchange between two girls, 13–14
years)
The sweet and distinctive flavour of EDs reportedly made them particularly appealing to
C&YP. Taste was identified as one of the main influences in the decision to consume these
products, although others also spoke about using them when they felt tired and needed a phys-
ical or mental ‘boost’ (often linked to consuming EDs in order to stay up late, creating a cycli-
cal effect):
Everybody only drinks them for their taste. They don’t really want them for the hyper; they just
want them for the taste. (Boy, 13–14 years)
If you want to be woken up you drink the big ones. (Girl, 13–14 years)
A preference for particular brands and packaging sizes was highlighted as an important fac-
tor in determining the quantities consumed. Most participants who consumed EDs reported a
preference for cheaper varieties in smaller cans as opposed to some of the better-known pre-
mium brands. For others, the larger cans or bottles were preferred because “you get more for
your money".
Price
The relatively low cost of some ED varieties, particularly in relation to other beverages, was
identified as a key factor in C&YP’s decisions to purchase these drinks:
Because they’re only cheap and plenty of people get money. So instead of looking for one of
them [points to sports drink], that’s 95p at that shop down there, they look at the energy drinks,
that’s only 35p. (Girl, 10–11 years)
I think it’s because like a normal can of Coke is like 70p, and [EDs] are like 35p. (Girl, 13–14
years)
The mapping exercise confirmed that ‘own brand’ EDs available from local convenience
stores were amongst the cheapest drinks on sale (“cheaper than water and pop”). It also
revealed that these drinks were often included in multi-purchase offers, where buying more
than one product results in a discount. Some C&YP reported pooling their money and sharing
EDs with friends to take advantage of special offers or the proportionately lower price for large
cans or bottles:
Children and energy drinks

 You know them little cans, like the Emerge? You can get, like, four for £1. (Girl, 13–14 years)
We get a big bottle of Emerge and share it. (Boy, 13–14 years)
A minority of participants suggested that increasing the cost of EDs could help to reduce
consumption, although there was some disagreement around the most appropriate price level:
Girl 1: They could step up the prices without them knowing. Because one day it could be 45p
and then the other day it can be £4 or £5 or something, and it could like stop them. . .
Girl 2: They should be about £1.50. Like, kids our ages doesn’t get about that much.
Girl 3: They should stay the price they are. (Exchange between three girls, 10–11 years)
Place
EDs appeared to be easily accessible to C&YP, with one participant reporting that, “every shop
apart from the pet shop and the furniture shop sells energy drinks”. The mapping exercise con-
firmed their widespread accessibility and availability, with most convenience stores offering
numerous brands, flavours and packaging sizes. They tended to be positioned near or opposite
the entrance and were often given greater shelf or fridge space than other drinks. Some partici-
pants suggested that the positioning of EDs within stores could be changed in order to restrict
access by C&YP:
I think they should go in their own aisle where children are not allowed, like cigarettes, and
they should all be together. And we’re not allowed. . . we shouldn’t go in that aisle. (Girl, 10–
11 years)
C&YP reported consuming EDs in a wide variety of places, including public spaces such as
on the street, in parks or at leisure facilities, including football pitches, BMX tracks and skate
parks. Much of the discussion focused on the journey to and from school. However, some par-
ticipants described consuming EDs at home, often linked to computer gaming and, less often,
to sleepovers:
Girl 1: Most kids drink them on the morning on the way to school. . . Or on the night walking
home.
Girl 2: Or when you’re out with your mates on the night. (Exchange between two girls, 13–14
years)
Sometimes it’s sleepover day when your mates come round. So you go to the shop, you get loads
of, you get energy drinks and you go in your house and you just play on your X-Box and stuff
like that. (Boy, 10–11 years)
Promotion
In addition to seeing EDs for sale in local shops, participants identified a range of different
media through which they were targeted with promotional messages about ED products.
These included: the internet (in the form of ‘pop-ups’ or banners at the side of webpages); tele-
vision (including ED consumption or product placement during popular shows); computer
games; bus-stop adverts; supermarket promotions; and sponsorship of sports or other events:
Children and energy drinks

8 / 17
 If you’re playing on your tablet or something and you’re playing a game, an advert pops up for
like Relentless. (Girl, 10–11 years)
It sponsors like big BMX games and stuff like that. . . Yeah, like extreme sports generally and
stuff, it like sponsors all of them and that. (Boy, 13–14 years)
As a consequence, participants in both age groups displayed a strong awareness of the
major ED brands, and many were familiar with particular advertising slogans and strategies.
They perceived that the branding and packaging of these drinks made them attractive to
C&YP. Some were identified as targeting boys in particular, through the brand names, packag-
ing colours and sizes, and the association with extreme sports:
I think that the drinks are a little bit sexist because they have all these boyish kind of patterns,
but you never see any girly ones. (Girl, 10–11 years)
C&YP reported that certain EDs have links with particular computer games, for example,
via codes under the ring-pull which could be used to boost the stamina of characters. All of the
games mentioned carried age restrictions and were marketed as being suitable for players 18
years and over, yet many of the boys in our focus groups were familiar with them:
There’s a game called Dead Island where you sometimes get them to fill your health up. (Boy,
10–11 years)
[In the game Saint’s Row] you own this energy drink company and you start selling them to
gangs and everything. (Boy, 10–11 years)
It was suggested that ED companies have an important role to play in marketing these
products in age-appropriate ways, although there was little discussion about stronger forms of
regulation or restrictions on advertising. Some participants were sceptical of the promotional
claims made by ED companies in adverts and on packaging. Many were aware that these tac-
tics were used to encourage people to buy products, thereby generating additional profit for
manufacturers:
Once I was playing on this game and the Monster advert popped up, and it said ‘Sugar-free,
fat-free, caffeine-free, and good for you’. And I was like, “No". (Girl, 10–11 years)
They put [promotional codes] on so that Monster can make more money. (Boy, 13–14 years)
Peers
There was a general perception amongst participants in both age groups that ED usage was
widespread within their peer groups. Some made a distinction between regular consumers and
those who had tried EDs once or not at all:
About everyone’s tried one, but I don’t think they keep on trying it. About five or four people
haven’t tried them or had a drink of them. (Boy, 10–11 years)
Consumption appeared to be highly gendered, in that boys were perceived as being more
likely to drink EDs, and in greater quantities, than girls. This was often associated with boys
reportedly being more active and more likely to take part in sports-related activities:
Girl 1: Boys are most likely to drink them. . . Yeah, because they’re playing football and things.
Children and energy drinks

 Girl 2: They like sporty things in the school.
Girl 3: They run out of energy so they think that when they drink them they get more, but actu-
ally they lose energy. (Exchange between three girls, 10–11 years)
Boys’ use of EDs was often described as linked to wanting to appear tough or attractive to
girls, whereas girls expressed a preference for ‘expensive-looking’ brands in smaller cans which
they associated with being sophisticated:
If you have a girlfriend or something, like, boys like to drink them then, because they think. . .
Sometimes the boys think that they look proper rock-hard when they have them in front of
girls and stuff. And then when they go out, you buy like three. (Boy, 10–11 years)
A number of participants believed that their peers drank EDs in order to enhance their
image or identity. These influences were generally described as affecting other C&YP, rather
than being reported as important factors in their own consumption decisions. However,
there was some evidence of boys and girls choosing to consume EDs as part of desire to ‘fit
in’:
Say your friend, he has something that looks really, really nice–an energy drink, like a Mon-
ster–but you only have a bottle of water. You’re tempted to get that because it looks cooler and
what your friends have you want, so you don’t want to be left behind. (Girl, 10–11 years)
C&YP also reported positive instances where friendships groups had collectively decided to
abstain or cut back on ED usage, as illustrated by the quote below. This highlighted the poten-
tial for peer-led interventions, for example, training C&YP as champions to provide informa-
tion and advice on EDs to their peers. The involvement of C&YP in designing and developing
interventions was a theme which ran through the focus group discussions.
Boy 1: Every morning we used to get them and we used to down them.
Boy 2: Then we stopped because then we knew what the effects were.
Boy 1: So we just got the 35p ones. We didn’t get the big ones. (Exchange between two boys,
10–11 years)
Parents and carers
Parents, carers and other adults played a role in C&YP’s decisions to consume EDs, either by
facilitating or limiting their access or by modelling this behaviour. Participants gave examples
of family members who drank EDs and were ambivalent about C&YP also drinking them,
while others were more firmly ‘against’ these products. Some reported that parents had pro-
vided EDs to rehydrate after sports activities or as a treat for doing chores:
Sometimes [dad] says to me, “Go down the shop, go to [name of shop] and get us, I don’t
know, some washing up liquid”. And he says, “There’s a can of Red Bull in there with your
name on it”. (Boy, 10–11 years)
Others mentioned relatives refusing to allow them to consume EDs, generally because of
concerns about possible negative health and behaviour-related effects. Examples were given of
other adult role models, such as sports coaches, influencing this behaviour:
Children and energy drinks

 [Coach says] “Don’t drink them before football, just bring some water”. [. . .] The coach just
cares for you and he wants to look out for you. And he doesn’t want your heart full of junk.
(Boy, 10–11 years)
Most participants reported purchasing EDs themselves, often using lunch money or ‘pocket
money’. Given that EDs tended to be consumed in a range of settings outside of the home,
family members were not always aware of this behaviour. As a consequence, parents and carers
were not generally identified by C&YP as important actors in discussions about possible inter-
vention options.
Some parents don’t allow people to drink energy drinks, so they just drink them when they’re
out. (Girl, 13–14 years)

Many participants suggested that there should be age restrictions on EDs, similar to those in
place for cigarettes and alcohol. However, there was little agreement on what would be an
appropriate age limit, with suggestions ranging from eight to 18 years (linked to the age of the
participants, i.e. generally suggesting that consumption should be limited for children younger
than themselves). Furthermore, most believed that this type of intervention could be easily
overcome by asking older friends, siblings or parents to purchase EDs on their behalf. Regard-
less, participants generally acknowledged that an age limit would help to send a clear message
that these products are not recommended for C&YP:
[The packaging] doesn’t exactly say, ‘Don’t give it to someone under age 16’ [. . .] They should
be banned for children. . . Like under 16, 15. (Girl, 10–11 years)
I think you maybe should make a certain age for certain ones, such as Monster maybe. No,
Relentless– 16. Maybe Monster. (Boy, 13–14 years)
In the absence of legislation regarding sale of EDs to C&YP, several participants suggested
voluntary schemes involving local retailers. They identified local shops or, more commonly,
individual employees who voluntarily restricted sales to C&YP:
There’s this old woman that works in [name of shop] and she doesn’t sell, she reads all the cans
before she sells you any drink. But then it depends who’s serving you. (Girl, 10–11 years)
This approach was believed by some to be unworkable because of the challenges of implemen-
tation with large national retailers and the importance of ED-related income to smaller retailers.
Instead, school-based interventions were suggested as a potential way of raising awareness of the
potential effects of EDs and prompting voluntary behaviour changes. Some C&YP were confused
about precisely how their health could be affected, offering opportunities to discuss EDs during
assemblies, biology lessons, or personal, health, social and economic (PHSE) education:
Yeah, because if you have a lesson on them, you might get to understand them more and you
know that they’re bad for you. And so you just shouldn’t drink them. (Girl, 10–11 years)
Existing school food policies appeared to inhibit ED consumption for the majority of
C&YP during school hours, particularly in primary schools. However, examples were given of

 pupils finding ways around these rules and also of school staff lacking knowledge of EDs,
highlighting the importance of education for adults as well as C&YP:
I don’t think that some teachers understand what the energy drinks are. Like, sometimes we
bring [sports drinks] into school and the teachers say they’re energy drinks when they’re not,
like the isotonics [sports drinks]. And sometimes we’ll be drinking energy drinks but they won’t
notice. (Boy, 13–14 years)
Discussion
Summary of key findings
This qualitative study explored attitudes and perceptions of C&YP in relation to EDs, with a
view to informing potential interventions. The findings are reported here around themes
derived from an enhanced version of the traditional marketing mix (or 4 Ps)–product, price,
place, promotion, peers, parents/carers and policy. Participants in both the younger and older
groups demonstrated strong brand awareness and preferences that were linked to taste and
perceived value for money. The relatively low price of many EDs and their widespread avail-
ability were identified as key factors in C&YP’s purchasing decisions. The accessibility of these
drinks was confirmed through the mapping exercise, which highlighted the wide range of
products available, the low cost of some brands, and the promotional offers available in many
shops. Parents, carers and other significant adults had a role to play in facilitating or limiting
access to EDs, or by helping to normalise their use. Gendered branding and marketing also
emerged as influential factors. Some participants demonstrated a critical approach to the mar-
keting tactics and nutritional claims made by ED manufacturers, and were keen to become
better informed.
C&YP reported consuming EDs in a variety of public and private places, generally linked to
social activities, sports and computer gaming (particularly amongst boys). There was some evi-
dence of C&YP choosing EDs as part of a desire to ‘fit in’ or ‘look tough’. But, on the whole,
our discussions appeared to suggest autonomous, rational decision-making; for example,
friendship groups ‘clubbing together’ to make purchases more affordable or choosing to cut
back or abstain from EDs as a group. This complexity in C&YP’s ED use has implications for
the design and implementation of future interventions, which participants advised should
involve C&YP as far as possible. Suggestions included age restrictions, voluntary schemes
involving retailers, and improved labelling and marketing of EDs. School food polices and
restrictions imposed by individual shopkeepers appeared to inhibit ED consumption for many
C&YP, but no single policy or practice intervention was felt to represent a ‘silver bullet’ to
address this complex issue.
Comparison with existing literature
The study complements findings from previous research on use of EDs by C&YP, but also
highlights complexities that may be more pronounced in countries with high levels of ED con-
sumption like the UK. Several studies have identified taste as a key motivating factor, with the
perceived stimulant properties and performance enhancing effects of EDs representing sec-
ondary motivators [17, 27–29, 41–43]. Advertising and brand loyalty were also identified as
important influences [44]. Similarities between the marketing tactics of major carbonated
drinks manufacturers and the tobacco companies of previous decades have already been
highlighted [45, 46]. There are also obvious parallels with alcohol marketing [47]. The youth-
oriented marketing and branding activities of ED companies would benefit from further

 scrutiny, particularly in terms of links to sport, gaming, sexuality and gender, and wider
risk-taking behaviours. In a focus group study involving three age groups (16–21, 22–28,
29–35 years), industry marketing was perceived as targeting specific drinks at males or
females, using sexualised imagery and humour [27]. Brand loyalty emerged as a common
theme across all groups, but the youngest age group appeared to be most conscious of the
social image they were portraying in their choices. In the present study, both age groups
and genders demonstrated awareness of major brands and popular advertising slogans. To
our knowledge, this is the first study to explore in-depth the views of children as young as
10 years in relation to EDs.
Previous studies highlight a perception of EDs as costly; in one case being described as
‘twice as expensive as traditional soft drinks’ [48]. An Australian focus group study involv-
ing students aged 11–18 years found that some reported using EDs as soft drink substitutes,
but only when they could afford them [30]. A recent blog identified that the cheapest EDs
on sale in Australian convenience stores start from $3.50, which equates to around £2.00
[49]. This contrasts with the findings of the present study, where C&YP perceived EDs to be
cheaper than many other beverages and the mapping exercise identified that they could be
purchased for as little as 35p. Price and value for money were clearly of high importance to
these age groups. Similar results in terms of C&YP being price conscious have been found
in relation to food purchasing, where participants reported ‘shopping around’ to get what
they considered to be value for money [36]. A key difference between the findings of the
present study and previous research relates to awareness of potential negative consequences
associated with ED consumption. Qualitative studies highlight limited understanding of
possible risks, particularly amongst younger age groups [27, 29, 30]. Participants in a 2003
study talked enthusiastically about the perceived beneficial effects on their bodies and their
sports performance, but made no mention of any harmful effects [30]. In the present study,
school food policies and educational interventions appeared to have increased awareness of
ED contents and potential risks associated with their consumption. However, this did not
appear to prevent participants from purchasing a cheap, readily available drink that was
perceived to taste good and was heavily marketed towards them, suggesting a need to move
beyond individual health education approaches to addressing wider structural influences
on this behaviour.
The social meanings and social context of ED consumption emerged as important influ-
ences on participants’ choices about where, when and what they consumed. Research on
C&YP’s relationships with food brands shows that consumption choices may be used to
support the image they choose to project and to express affinity with particular social or
peer groups [50]. Peer influences are often assumed to be negative, but research shows that
C&YP can also influence one another’s health-related behaviours in positive ways [51].
Rather than reducing their choices to ‘peer pressure’ or a simple desire to look ‘cool’, partic-
ipants in this study articulated a far more nuanced picture in discussing their perceptions,
preferences and practices in relation to EDs. They supported policy-level interventions and
had realistic expectations about what might be feasible in attempting to reduce ED con-
sumption. This research contributes to our understanding of the complex influences on
health-related decision making by C&YP, and highlights the relevance of critical perspec-
tives informed by C&YP’s views gathered in qualitative research. Further research involving
other stakeholders (i.e. teachers, parents, manufacturers and retailers) and conducted in dif-
ferent contexts would help to shed further light on this type of complex behaviour. Compar-
ative studies in particular are needed to answer the question of why ED consumption in the
UK is so high.

 Strengths and limitations
This study had several limitations. Participants were located in one geographical area within
northern England and the findings may not be generalizable to other areas, particularly given
the lack of area-level prevalence data and dearth of studies on ED use conducted in a UK con-
text. Furthermore, data were collected in and around schools and provide insights from partic-
ipants at a particular time and place. This research does not tell us about patterns of ED
consumption amongst C&YP more widely. While the design included efforts to reduce bias,
there remains the possibility of selection bias in the convenience sample of schools who agreed
to take part in the study and also in the recruitment of students by teachers. Two parents opted
out of allowing their children to participate in the study; we have no means of ascertaining the
reasons for their decision. None of the C&YP opted out.
There existed a risk of social acceptability bias, in that participants may have felt they were
going to be judged for reporting high ED use or, conversely, may have exaggerated their intake
and associated risky behaviours. Participants were asked to talk about EDs in general, or the
perceived behaviours of their friends and classmates, in an effort to reduce this risk. Although
many also shared their own experiences, we did not gather data specifically on levels of ED
consumption. Single gender focus groups were chosen to maximise opportunities for partici-
pation and informal feedback indicated that girls in particular liked this approach. However, it
may have informed the data in ways we did not anticipate. The combination of practical sort-
ing exercises and discussion-based activities appeared to work well, with the empty cans and
bottles often acting as prompts for further discussions on branding and content. Including a
participatory mapping exercise also enriched the study findings. C&YP engaged enthusiasti-
cally with the research process and feedback indicated that they found the discussions enjoy-
able. Overall, we believe that our approach was successful in generating valuable insights on
awareness and consumption of EDs by C&YP.
Conclusions
This is one of the first studies to explore C&YP’s perceptions of EDs in a UK context, where
prevalence of ED consumption is particularly high and the cost of many ED products is rela-
tively low. Taste, price, promotion, ease of access and peer influences were all identified as key
factors in C&YP’s consumption choices. The lack of a single dominant factor suggests that
there is unlikely to be a ‘silver bullet’ in attempting to address this issue. However, the impor-
tance of value for money to C&YP and the strong influence of the marketing activities of ED
companies should not be underestimated. These findings provide support for policy-level
interventions that seek to change the behaviours of manufacturers and retailers as well as con-
sumers, and actively involve C&YP as far as possible.
