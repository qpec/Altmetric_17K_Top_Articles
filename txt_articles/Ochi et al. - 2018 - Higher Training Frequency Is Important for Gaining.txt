Background: This study investigated the effect of volume-matched strength training
programs with different frequency and subsequent detraining on muscle size and
strength.
Methods:
During
a
training
period
of
11
weeks,
untrained
subjects
(age:
22.3 ± 0.9 years, height: 173.1 ± 4.8 cm and body mass: 66.8 ± 8.4 kg) performed
knee-extension exercise at 67% of their estimated one-repetition maximum either one
session per week (T1 group: 6 sets of 12 repetitions per session; n = 10) or three
sessions per week (T3 group: 2 sets of 12 repetitions per session; n = 10). Rating of
perceived exertion (RPE) and muscle stiffness were measured as an index of muscle
fatigue and muscle damage, respectively. The magnitude of muscle hypertrophy was
assessed with thigh circumference and the quadriceps muscle thickness. The changes
in muscle strength were measured with isometric maximum voluntary contraction torque
(MVC).
Results: During the training period, RPE was significantly higher in the T1 than in the T3
(p < 0.001). After 11 weeks of training, both groups exhibited significant improvements
in thigh circumference, muscle thickness, and MVC compared with baseline values.
However, there was a significant group difference in MVC improvement at week 11 (T1:
43.5 ± 15.5%, T3: 65.2 ± 23.2%, p < 0.05). After 6 weeks of detraining, both groups
showed the significant decreases in thigh circumference and muscle thickness from
those at the end of training period, while no significant effect of detraining was observed
in MVC.
Conclusion: These results suggest that three training sessions per week with two sets
are recommended for untrained subjects to improve muscle strength while minimizing
fatigue compared to one session per week with six sets.

Training Frequency on Muscle Adaptations
INTRODUCTION
Strength training being a safe and effective way to increase
muscle size and strength, is supported by the American
College of Sports Medicine (2009). While it is well established
that the optimal strength training loading zone for gaining
muscle size and strength corresponds to 8–
12 repetitions
maximum (RM) and 3–
5 RM, respectively (American College
of Sports Medicine, 2009), the effect of training frequency
on subsequent neuromuscular adaptation is relatively under-
researched.
In regards to training frequency, recent review papers have
proposed that reducing the training volume and increasing the
training frequency may be beneficial for muscle hypertrophy
(Schoenfeld et al., 2016; Dankel et al., 2017). As earlier studies
(McLester et al., 2000; Schoenfeld et al., 2015; Brigatto et al.,
2018) have shown that training either once or three times
a week in trained subjects elicited similar improvements in
muscular strength and hypertrophy, these results suggest that the
training frequency might not be of great importance in trained
individuals. However, a meta-analysis by Schoenfeld et al. (2016)
concluded that training twice a week resulted in superior muscle
hypertrophy compared with training once a week in untrained
subjects. As they also mentioned that “
Due to an absence of
data, it is not clear whether training muscle groups more than
3 days per week might enhance the hypertrophic response”
(Schoenfeld et al., 2016), the importance of higher training
frequency for muscular hypertrophy in untrained subjects is
still unknown. A recent meta-analysis by Grgic et al. (2018)
suggested that there is a dose-response relationship between
training frequency and muscular strength gain. However, when
the training volume was identical, they found no significant
effect. Thus, it remains unclear whether training frequency has
an effect on muscular strength gain under volume-matched
conditions.
When strength training is stopped (i.e., detraining), muscle
size and strength gradually decrease (Colliander and Tesch,
1992; Kubo et al., 2010). Some studies have investigated
the effect of training intensity on the decrease in muscle
size (Häkkinen et al., 1985; Jespersen et al., 2009; Kubo
et
al.,
2010)
and
strength
(Häkkinen
and
Komi,
1982;
Häkkinen et al., 1985) during detraining, the results of
which are inconsistent. As per our knowledge, no study has
investigated the effect of strength training frequency on the
maintenance of muscle size and strength during detraining, while
controlling the total training volume. We assumed that a higher
training frequency would maintain muscular strength under
volume-matched training conditions because of greater motor
learning.
In this study, therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects
of two knee-extension training programs, which differed in
training frequency but not in total training volume, on the
changes in muscle size and strength during an 11-week training
and a subsequent 6-week detraining period. We hypothesized
that the two programs would result in different RPE during
exercise, but similar adaptations to strength training and
detraining.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Twenty healthy male college students (age: 22.3 ± 0.9 years,
height: 173.1 ± 4.8 cm, body mass: 66.8 ± 8.4 kg) participated
in the study. The sample size was determined by a power
analysis (G∗power, version 3.0.10, Heinrich-Heine University,
Dusseldorf, Germany) by setting the effect size as 0.25, α level
of 0.05 and power (1-β) of 0.80 for the comparison between
groups, which showed that at least ten participants were necessary
(Fink et al., 2017). They had not participated in any regular
resistance training for at least 1 year prior to recruitment. Before
participation, the subjects were given a detailed explanation
of the study protocol, and each of them signed an informed
consent form. The subjects were requested to avoid interventions
such as massage, stretching, strenuous exercise, and excessive
consumption of food and alcohol during the study period. Food
and fluid intakes were not restricted. The study was conducted
in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
and was approved by the local ethics committee for human
experiments at Juntendo University (ID: 24–
39).
Experimental Protocols
This study investigated the effect of two exercise training
programs with different frequencies but same volume per week
on muscle size and strength over an 11-week training followed
by a 6-week detraining period. Twenty subjects were divided
into a T1 group (n = 10), who trained once a week and
a T3 group (n = 10), who trained three times a week. The
subjects were randomly assigned to two groups using a table of
random numbers in such a manner as to minimize the inter-
group differences in age, body fat, body mass index. The total
training volume per week was the same in both groups, with
the number of sets in each training session being different
(see section “
Training Programs” for details). The following
outcomes were measured before and after 3, 6, 9, and 11 weeks
of training and after 3 and 6 weeks of detraining (denoted as
weeks 14 and 17, respectively, in the ‘
Figures’
and ‘
Tables’
): body
composition, thigh circumference, muscle thickness, muscle
stiffness, and maximum voluntary contraction torque (MVC).
The measurements were made by a single investigator who was
well-trained and blinded to the groups. During the training
period, each measurement session was scheduled 72 h after
the corresponding last training session, while the baseline
measurement was performed 1 week before the first training
session. Measurements were taken before each training session,
with only RPE measured during each training session.
Training Programs
Knee-extension exercise training with both legs was conducted
using a leg extension machine (CYBEX, United States). The T1
group performed one training session (comprising 6 sets of 12
leg extensions at 67% of their estimated 1RM) per week, whereas
the T3 group performed three sessions (each comprising 2 sets
of 12 repetitions at 67% of estimated their 1RM) per week. This
intensity was set according to the guideline of American College

Training Frequency on Muscle Adaptations
of Sports Medicine (2009). Both groups of subjects rested for
2 min between each set. The movement velocity was controlled
using a metronome so that each 1 s knee-extension (concentric)
and 1 s knee-flexion (eccentric) was followed by a 1 s rest period.
The range of motion of the knee joint was from 90 to 0◦ (full
extension). The machine’
s backrest was set to an angle of 100◦
and the subject was secured with a belt at the waist to prevent
sliding of the buttocks. If the subjects could not complete the
prescribed repetitions because of fatigue, they were allowed a 2-
min rest after which the remaining repetitions were performed
to ensure a total of 72 repetitions (6 sets of 12 repetitions) per
week.
To determine training intensity, each subject’
s 1RM was
estimated using the same machine as for training. If the subjects
were able to smoothly perform five repetitions with a given
weight load, the load was increased by 5 kg. Such trials were
repeated with a 2-min rest between trials, until the subject
could complete 4 but not 5 repetitions. We calculated estimated
1RM using the following formula: 1RM = 4 RM × 100/90.
The 1RM was re-estimated before training sessions at 2, 4,
6, 8, and 10 weeks of training and after 2 and 5 weeks of
detraining.
Measurements
Rating of Perceived Exertion
Rating of perceived exertion was measured immediately after the
knee-extension exercise in both groups using a psychophysical
category scale (Noble et al., 1983) with the subject rating the
strength of his perception from 0 (“
no exertion at all”
) to 10
(“
extremely strong”
) (Loenneke et al., 2011). The RPE test–
retest reliability based on the coefficient of variation (CV)
was 5.9%.
Muscle Stiffness
Using ultrasound shear-wave elastography, we measured the
stiffness of the three heads of the left quadriceps muscles (Vastus
Lateralis: VL, Rectus Femoris: RF, and Vastus Medialis: VM) with
the subject standing upright. An ultrasonic scanner (Aixplorer
version 4.2, Supersonic Imagine, France) was used in shear-wave
elastography mode with musculoskeletal preset. An electronic
linear-array probe (SL 15-4, Supersonic Imagine) coated with
water-soluble transmission gel was placed longitudinally on each
muscle head. Muscle shear modulus (µ), a measure of normalized
muscle stiffness, was calculated using the following equation:
µ = ρVs2, where ρ is the density of muscle (assumed to be
1,000 kg/m3) and Vs is the velocity of shear-wave propagation
caused by a focused ultrasound beam from the scanner. A 10 mm
square map of the muscle shear modulus with a spatial resolution
of 1 mm × 1 mm was obtained with each ultrasound image.
A representative value of the shear modulus for each muscle
head was then determined by the spatial averaging over a
5 mm diameter circle. The shear modulus of each muscle head
was measured at 30, 50, and 70% of the distance between
the greater trochanter and the lateral condyle, as marked for
thigh circumference measurements, and the mean value of the
three sites was calculated (Akagi et al., 2015). The test–
retest
reliability of the muscle stiffness measures based on the CV
was 2.0%.
Thigh Circumference
The left thigh circumference was measured using a tape measure
at 30, 50, and 70% of the distance from the greater trochanter
point to the lateral condyle while the subject was standing
upright. Measurement sites were marked with semi-permanent
ink pen and maintained throughout the experimental period. The
test–
retest reliability of the circumference measures based on the
CV was 2.3%.
Maximum Voluntary Contraction Torque
After a warm-up exercise consisting of 3–
5 knee extensions,
maximal voluntary isometric concentric contraction torque
of the non-dominant (left) leg was measured by a custom-
made knee-extension dynamometer, at a knee joint angle of
90◦ and hip joint angle of 70◦ flexion. Following sufficient
familiarization and warm-up, subjects performed three 3 s
MVC trials with a 60 s rest between trials. We calculated
MVC as an average knee-extension torque over a 0.25 s
epoch at the middle of contraction. The average MVC from
the three trials was used for further analysis. The test–
retest reliability of the MVC measures based on the CV
was 3.8%.
Muscle Thickness
We measured the thickness of the four heads of the left
quadriceps muscles (VL, RF, VM, and Vastus Intermedius:
VI) with the same setup as used in the measurement of
muscle stiffness (Akagi et al., 2015). Muscle thickness was
measured at 30, 50, and 70% of the distance from the
greater trochanter to the lateral condyle of the left thigh.
We took precautions to keep the probe perpendicular to the
skin and to apply minimal compression on the tissues during
image acquisition. Measurement sites were marked at the
first measurement, using a semi-permanent ink pen, which
was then maintained throughout the experimental period by
writing over each mark again on each training day. Three
images for each site were obtained and the average recorded.
We calculated the muscle thickness from each image as the
distance from the bone to the subcutaneous fat. The test–
retest
reliability of the muscle thickness measures based on the CV
was 1.7%.
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics software
version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, United States). Data are
expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). All parameters
were expressed as absolute values, and MVC was expressed as
both an absolute value and a value relative to the pre-training
MVC (as a percentage). For each of the measurement items, two-
way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used
to test main effects of time and group as well as their interaction.
When a significant main effect or interaction was found, Student’
s
t-test with Bonferroni correction was performed. A p-value of
<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The magnitudes

of the differences were calculated using standardized differences
based on Cohen’
s D units by means of effect sizes (ES) (Hopkins
et al., 2009). Effect size (ES) was calculated as the pretest–
post-
test change, divided by the pooled pretest SD. The Cohen’
s
D results were qualitatively interpreted using the following
thresholds: <0.2, trivial; 0.2–
0.6, small; 0.6–
1.2, moderate; 1.2–
2.0, large; 2.0–
4.0, very large; and >4.0, nearly perfect (Cohen,
1988).
RESULTS
One-Repetition Maximum
Compared with the baseline (pre), both groups showed
significant improvements in estimated 1RM after 2, 4, 6, 8,
and 10 weeks of training and even after the subsequent 6-week
detraining (T1: 12–
53% T3: 15–
53%, p < 0.01 for both groups,
Table 1). No significant difference was observed between the
groups at any time point (pre; ES = 0.55, 95% confidence interval
(CI): −1.42 to 0.36, week 2; ES = 0.65, 95% CI: −0.55 to 0.25,
week 4; ES = 0.72, 95% CI: −1.63 to 0.18, week 6; ES = 0.81,
95% CI: −1.68 to 0.14, week 8; ES = 0.54, 95% CI: −1.40 to 0.38,
week 10; ES = 0.59, 95% CI: −1.45 to 0.33, week 14; ES = 0.53,
95% CI: −1.40 to 0.38, week 17; ES = 0.47, 95% CI: −1.33
to 0.44).
Rating of Perceived Exertion
The T1 group reported a higher RPE than the T3 group at all time
points (p < 0.01, Figure 1, week 2; ES = 2.62, 95% CI: 1.33 to 3.67,
week 4; ES = 2.04, 95% CI: 0.89 to 3.02, week 6; ES = 1.56, 95%
CI: 0.50 to 2.48, week 8; ES = 2.44, 95% CI: 1.20 to 3.47, week 10;
ES = 2.89, 95% CI: 1.54 to 3.99, week 11; ES = 4.27, 95% CI: 2.54 to
5.62). No significant change in RPE was observed in either group
throughout the training period.
Muscle Stiffness
There was no significant change in muscle stiffness (shear
modulus) in either group and thus no significant difference
between the groups at any time point (Table 2).
Thigh Circumference
Compared with the baseline (pre), both groups showed
significant increases in thigh circumference after 9 and 11 weeks
of training measured at 30 and 50% (T1: 2.6–
6.7% T3: 2.8–
3.8%,
p < 0.01 for both groups, Table 3) but not at 70% of the thigh
length. No significant difference was found between the groups at
any time point.
Maximum Voluntary Contraction Torque
Compared with the baseline (pre), both groups showed
significant improvements in MVC after 3, 6, 9, and 11 weeks
of training (p < 0.01) and even after the subsequent 6-week
detraining (p < 0.01–
0.05 at weeks 14 and 17, Figure 2 and
Table 3). A significant interaction effect was observed, and
the improvement in MVC was significantly greater in the T3
group than in the T1 group at week 11 (T1: 43.5 ± 15.5%, T3:
65.2 ± 23.2%, p < 0.05, pre; ES = −0.02, 95% CI: −1.28 to 0.49,
week 3; ES = 0.45, 95% CI: −1.31 to 0.46, week 6; ES = 0.55,
95% CI: −1.41 to 0.37, week 9; ES = 0.69, 95% CI: −1.55 to 0.25,
week 11; ES = 0.94, 95% CI: −1.82 to −0.02, week 14; ES = 0.99,
95% CI: −1.87 to 0.02, week 17; ES = 0.72, 95% CI: −1.59
to 0.22).
Muscle Thickness
Compared with the baseline (pre), both groups showed
significant increase in thickness of all the quadriceps muscles
after 6, 9, and 11 weeks of training and even after the subsequent
3-week detraining (p < 0.01–
0.05 at week 14, Table 4).
Compared with the end of training (at week 11), however,
muscle thickness significantly decreased during detraining in

DISCUSSION
In this study, we investigated the effects of two volume-
matched
knee-extension
strength
training
programs
with
different frequencies (once vs. three times a week), on
the changes in muscle size and strength. After 11 weeks
of training, both groups showed significant increases in

thickness,

1RM,
and MVC compared with baseline (pre), while RPE during
exercise was significantly higher in the T1 group than in
the T3 group. Moreover, the improvement in MVC was
significantly greater in the T3 group than in the T1 group at
week 11 (i.e., the end of training period). After 6 weeks of
detraining, muscle thickness significantly decreased from the
value at week 11 in both groups, with no significant group
difference.
Both the T1 and T3 groups showed significant increase in
thickness of all the quadriceps muscles after 6 weeks of training.
Recently, Damas et al. (2016) have provided evidence that an
increase in muscle cross-sectional area could be due to swelling.
Since we had to set a relatively short interval (3 days) from
the last training session to the measurement because of the
training schedule, the increase in muscle thickness observed in
this study could overestimate the actual magnitude of muscle
hypertrophy. However, we believe that such an overestimation
does

exercise-induced muscle damage (Lacourpaille et al., 2014),
did not change significantly in either group throughout the
experimental period. In fact, we also confirmed that the value
of muscle stiffness 3 days after the last training session was
consistently similar between the groups despite the differences in
the number of sets in each session (Table 3).
There was no significant difference in muscle thickness
between groups. This is consistent with the results of previous
studies (Candow and Burke, 2007; Arazi and Asadi, 2011; Gentil
et al., 2015), which showed no significant differences in muscle
mass for untrained subjects. Since Schoenfeld et al. (2016)
suggested the importance of conducting research involving
training muscle groups more than 3 days per week, our
finding that the magnitude of muscle hypertrophy is primarily
determined by total training volume (not by frequency) is
valuable. However, RPE, the perceptual response to exercise,
was significantly higher in the T1 group than that in the T3
group at all time points (Figure 1). The mean RPE values
were 7.3–
8.3 and 4.3–
5.3 in the T1 and T3 groups, respectively.
Using the same 0–
10 category scale as in the present study,
a previous study showed that RPEs immediately after three
sets of eight repetitions of knee-extension exercise were 5.1–
6.2
(Martín-Hernández et al., 2017). Therefore, we can reasonably
assume that the difference in RPE between the T3 (two sets)
and T1 (six sets) groups reflects the difference in the number
of sets per training session and the magnitude of muscle
fatigue.
In both groups, MVC increased to a greater extent (T1:
40% and T3: 55%) than did muscle thickness (T1: 10.9–
15.6% and T3: 9.8–
16.9%) after 11 weeks of strength training.
This observation is in good agreement with those of the
previous studies (Moritani and deVries, 1979; Narici et al.,
1996; Ferri et al., 2003). Interestingly, we found that the
change in MVC was significantly greater in the T3 group
than in the T1 group at the end of the training period.
This difference cannot be explained by the difference in
training-induced muscle hypertrophy, because of the similar
change in muscle thickness as mentioned above. We speculate
that the T1 group may have had a greater expression of
extra-cellular matrix proteins (such as type I collagen) in
the trained muscle, which may have resulted in a decrease
in the muscle specific tension (strength per unit cross-
sectional area). Interestingly, the muscle strength of the human
quadriceps muscles has been shown to negatively correlate with

Ochi et al.
Training Frequency on Muscle Adaptations
ultrasound echo intensity, an index of the amount of non-
contractile tissue within the muscle (Rech et al., 2014; Wilhelm
et al., 2014). In addition, it can be speculated that the superior
strength results for the T3 group could be due to a greater motor
learning effect following the extra weekly “
practice.”However,
this would be contrary to the recent meta-analysis by Grgic et al.
(2018), wherein it was found that frequency was not a factor
in strength development when training programs were matched
for volume. We believe that the experimental conditions in the
present study, including the single joint exercise and non-failure
among young untrained males, could explain the results. Further
studies are warranted to verify these suggestions.
As far as we know, this is the first study to investigate the effect
of volume-matched strength training frequency on the changes
in muscle size and strength during subsequent detraining. The
results showed that during detraining, the muscle thickness
decreased from the value at the end of training period in both
groups. On the other hand, the isometric strength did not
change significantly during the 6-week detraining period in either
group. These results are generally consistent with those of the
previous studies showing that the rate of strength loss during
detraining was much lower than that of strength gain during the
preceding training period (Colliander and Tesch, 1992; Staron
et al., 1994; Ivey et al., 2000). Although not statistically significant,
the group difference in MVC improvement observed at the
end of the training period tended to be maintained during
the detraining period (Table 3). As the MVC in this study
was isometric, we suggest that isokinetic (or isotonic) MVC
testing may clarify the results. This finding suggests that for a
given total training volume, increasing frequency would be more
advantageous for developing and maintaining muscle strength in
untrained subjects than increasing the volume (number of sets)
per session.
This study has several limitations. First, we did not have
a control group and did not determine the nutritional status.
Thus the true effectiveness of the training programs cannot be
evaluated properly. This is particularly relevant to the changes
in MVC following strength training and detraining, as a motor
learning effect associated with repeated measurements could
contribute in part to the strength improvement. Second, as our
findings are specific to young untrained men, they cannot be
applied to other populations such as trained individuals, female
individuals, or elderly subjects. Third, although we observed an
increase in muscle strength and thickness in both groups, the
training intensity (67% 1RM) was relatively low in this study.
Therefore, we believe that the subjects did not train to failure.
Since we think that the subjects did not reach to failure, we
suggest that they could have resulted in different adaptations
when they have trained to failure. Forth, because 1RM was
estimated from 4RM, it is difficult to understand actual 1RM
and compare the changes with those of the other parameters
such as MVC. Finally, the detraining period (6 weeks) was short
compared to that in previous studies (Colliander and Tesch, 1992;
Staron et al., 1994; Ivey et al., 2000), and we failed to observe a
significant decrease in muscle strength. Further studies need to
be conducted to investigate these limitations.
In summary, this study demonstrated that 2 sets of 12
repetitions (at 67% 1RM), performed three times a week were
less strenuous and equally or more effective for gaining muscle
size and strength in untrained subjects than were 6 sets of 12
repetitions performed once a week. Although we acknowledge
that our findings have the potential to change with the use of
a different percentage of 1RM and the number of repetitions
and sets, we suggest that high-frequency training is preferable to
low-frequency training in untrained subjects, as long as the total
training volume is constant. We propose that training frequency
should be prioritized when designing strength-training programs
for untrained subjects, such that a target amount of exercise
(load × repetitions × sets) per week is divided into three sessions.
