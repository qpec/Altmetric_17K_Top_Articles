ABSTRACT: Pet cats may be used as a biomarker for assessing
exposures to organohalogen compounds (OHCs) adsorbed to
household dust in home environments. This study explores two
exposure routes of OHCs, ingestion of OHCs (i) via house dust
and (ii) via cat food. House dust from 17 Swedish homes and
serum from the participating families’ pet cats were collected,
and cat food was purchased matching the diet reported. Paired
samples of cat serum, house dust, and cat food were analyzed
for brominated flame retardants/natural products (polybromi-
nated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), decabromobiphenyl (BB-209),
decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), 2,4,6-tribromophenol
(2,4,6-TBP), OH-PBDEs) and organochlorines (polychlori-
nated biphenyls (PCBs), 1,1-bis(4,4′-dichlorodiphenyl)-2,2,2-
trichloroethane (4,4′-DDT), 1,1-bis(4,4′-dichlorodiphenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (4,4′-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB),
pentachlorophenol (PCP)). Significant correlations were found between serum and dust samples from the living rooms for
BDE-47 (p < 0.035), BDE-99 (p < 0.035), and BDE-153 (p < 0.039), from the adult’s bedroom for BDE-99 (p < 0.019) and
from all rooms for BDE-99 (p < 0.020) and BB-209 (p < 0.048). This is the first time a correlation between cat serum levels and
household dust has been established, a finding that supports the hypothesis that dust is a significant exposure route for cats.
Serum levels were also significantly correlated with concentrations found in cat food for 6-OH-BDE47 (p < 0.002), 2,4,6-TBP (p
< 0.035), and BB-209 (p < 0.007). DBDPE was found in high concentrations in all dust (median 154 pmol/g) and food samples
(median 0.7 pmol/g lw) but was below detection in serum samples, suggesting low or no bioavailability for DBDPE in cats.
1. INTRODUCTION
Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are industrial chemicals
produced to fire-protect construction materials, indoor
decorations, furniture, textiles, electronics, and electrical
appliances.1−3 One of the major classes of BFRs are the
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs).4 PBDEs are not
chemically bound to the product material, so they are prone to
migrate into the environment and adsorb to particles such as
household dust.5 Unlike the legacy POPs, where dietary intake
is an important route of exposure, BFRs also have indoor dust
as a significant source of exposure via inhalation and hand-to-
mouth activities, a special concern for small children6−8 and
cats.9−11 An exposure assessment study on PBDE burdens in
Americans found that the food intake of PBDEs explained less
than 20% of the total body burden and that 82% of the body
burden of PBDEs could be accounted for through house dust
exposure.12 This large contribution from indoor dust is
proposed as an explanation for the elevated levels of PBDEs
in serum observed in North Americans.12,13 In adults, the lower
brominated PBDE congeners are generally considered to be
from dietary sources, whereas the higher brominated PBDEs,
such as the BDE-209, are mainly associated with dust as an
exposure source.8 However, for small children, dust has been
shown to also be an exposure route for the lower brominated
PBDEs.7,8,14 The exposure route of both low and high
brominated PBDEs from dust in small children are also seen
in pet cats, which is a likely explanation for the overall higher
PBDE concentrations found in pet cats compared to adults
from the same region/country.9,10,15 Another possibility of the
elevated levels in pet cats could be the reduced activity in phase
1 metabolic reactions, which would facilitate a higher
accumulation of these lipophilic compounds in cats compared
to humans.16
Other BFRs addressed here are decabromobiphenyl (BB-
209), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), hexabromoben-

 zene (HBB), and a brominated intermediate currently used in
the BFR production and natural product (i.e., 2,4,6-
tribromophenol; 2,4,6-TBP) all of which are reviewed and
assessed by EFSA 2010-2012.3,17,18 In 1976, the US stopped
production of BB-209, but BB-209 continued to be produced in
Europe (France) until 2000.19 DBDPE was introduced as a
replacement for decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) and has
been on the market for more than 20 years.20 HBB is an
alternative flame retardant used to replace PentaBDE
formulations. The flame retardant is used in paper, textiles,
plastics, and electronics; it has also been detected in various
matrices in the environment.21
Due to the extensive application of BFRs in products,
materials, and everyday goods (contributing up to 30% of the
mass of these products, materials, and goods), many of the
BFRs are now ubiquitous environmental contaminants.2,22−24
The scientific community is concerned that their reported
persistence, bioaccumulation, long-range transport, and the lack
of better understanding of their toxicity is troublesome.2,25
PBDEs, among others, are of concern since they may target the
endocrine system.26 In humans, PBDEs are metabolized via
phase I and II enzymes to form hydroxylated PBDEs.27 This
metabolic pathway implies formation of monohydroxylated
OH-PBDEs, where oxidation can result in a 1,2-bromine shift.
Hydroxylated metabolites of BDE-47 (i.e., 5-OH-BDE47, 6-
OH-BDE47, and 2,4-dibromophenol) have been demonstrated
in in vitro incubations of human hepatic microsomes, where
CYP2B6 was identified as the major enzyme involved in the
biotransformation.28,29 Furthermore, PBDEs may also undergo
debromination, which is the major route for the higher
brominated PBDEs, such as BDE-209, leading to the formation
of PBDE congeners that possess higher bioavailability
potencies.27,30 Another proposed phase I metabolism pathway
for PBDEs is cleavage of the ether bond (i.e., hydrolysis) to
form a simple polybrominated phenol and a brominated
catechol.31 In contrast to the anthropogenic formed OH-
PBDEs and brominated phenols, there are naturally occurring
OH-PBDEs (i.e., 2′-OH-BDE68, 6-OH-BDE47, and bromi-
nated phenols (2,4-DBP and 2,4,6-TBP)) that are well-known
natural products produced by, for example, algae and sponges
in marine environments.32 Of particular concern is the
abundant 6-OH-BDE47 as it has endocrine-disrupting proper-
ties and can disrupt oxidative phosphorylation in the electron
transport chain.33,34
One major concern regarding the toxicity of OH-PBDEs
involves their capacity to mimic the structure of the native
hormone thyroxin (T4) and by that competitively bind to
important T4-transport proteins such as transthyretin (TTR).22
Thyroid hormone disrupting compounds (THDCs) with a
binding potency to TTR has recently been reviewed.35 The
majority of the TTR binding chemicals were aromatic,
halogenated, and hydroxylated compounds. These compounds
are typical metabolites of BFRs as well as products of
organochlorines regulated under Stockholm Convention:
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesti-
cides such as 1,1-bis(4,4′-dichlorodiphenyl)-2,2,2-trichloro-
ethane (4,4′-DDT), 1,1-bis(4,4′-dichlorodiphenyl)-2,2-dichlor-
oethene (4,4′-DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and penta-
chlorophenol (PCP). A review article of organic contaminants
in settled house dust reported 485 chemicals, including a wide
range of compound groups such as PBDEs, PCBs, organo-
phosphate esters, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chlorinated phenols,
and pesticides.36,37
In this study, correlation between cats’ internal and external
exposure by paired analyses of serum, cat food (matched after
each cat’s food requirements according to the cat owners), and
settled house dust was investigated. Several previous studies
have analyzed cat blood for BFRs,9−11,15,38−41 PCBs,15,38−42
and pesticides.38−40 Cats are renowned for developing feline
hyperthyroidism, an endocrine disorder tentatively linked to
environmental factors. A recently published study reports that
higher serum concentrations for BDE-99, BDE-153, and BDE-
183 in pet cats may be associated with hyperthyroidism in
cats.15 The study also reported BB-209 to be present in all cat
serum samples, at levels similar to BDE-209, which is intriguing
as the production and application of this flame retardant ceased
in Europe in 2000.1
The long reaching goal of the project (www.aces.su.se/
misse/) is to identify mixtures of THDCs in indoor
environments that may lead to hormone-related diseases and
disorders. Cats’ exposure to house dust is assumed to be more
similar to small children than to adults, so the internal exposure
in cats is assumed to mirror that of small children assuming
similar bioavailability for chemicals accumulated in dust.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1. Samples. 2.1.1. Cat Serum. Seventeen families in the
Stockholm/Uppsala region participated in the study. Samples
were collected between August 2013 and March 2014. The
requirements of the participating families included having a
healthy adult pet cat (>1 year of age) and at least one child
(<10 years of age) living at home. The constellation of the
participating families and the description of their cats are listed
in Table S1. On average, the families had two children living at
home and more than one cat. The majority of the cats were
domestic (shorthair) cats (57%) and most of the families lived
in free-standing houses (53%). The majority of the cats (86%)
spent more than 50% of their time indoors. The cat’s health
was checked by a simple clinical examination before the blood
was sampled, and their thyroid status was evaluated by
measuring the levels of total serum T4 and thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH). All the cats were clinically healthy, and none
of the cats were on medication.
In total, blood was drawn from 28 unsedated pet cats in their
home environment. Blood was taken from the cephalic vein in
the right foreleg using a 0.8 mm (21 G) needle connected to a
plain evacuated tube with a clotting activator (BD Vacutainer,
BD, Plymouth, UK). Serum was obtained by letting whole
blood coagulate at ambient temperature for at least 30 min.
Next, the sample was centrifuged for 5 min (3000g), and the
supernatant (i.e., the blood serum) was collected and stored at
−20 °C before analysis. The study was performed after
obtaining permission from the Swedish Board of Agriculture
and Uppsala Ethical Committee on Animal Studies (No. 31-
10466/12).
Mean density of cat serum was experimentally determined to
be 1.042 g/mL (n = 20, SD = 0.008, and CV = 0.77%). If the
cats were siblings, were living in the same household, and were
feed the same diet, their serum samples were pooled to increase
the sample volumes. In total, 10 individual and 9 pooled serum
samples were analyzed and reported here.
2.1.2. House Dust. Dust samples were vacuumed from three
different rooms, i.e., the living rooms and children’s and
parents’ bedrooms of the participating families to separate point

 sources which can differ between the rooms. The dust sampling
was performed at the same occasions as when the blood
samples were collected from the cats. Dust was collected using
a Dustream dust collector (Indoor Biotechnologies Ltd.,
Wiltshire, United Kingdom) containing a disposable filter
(mesh size 40 μm) and attached to a household vacuum cleaner
tube. The collected dust samples were so-called still standing
dust, from surfaces that were least disturbed by daily activity
(e.g., outdoor activities and/or containing food crumbs).
Typical sampling areas were book shelves, TV furniture,
electronics, window benches, on top of hanging and standing
lamps, wall strips, on top of sofas and armchairs, and around
beds. Sampling of human and cat hair as well as large gravel or
other nondust particles was avoided. The sampling volume
varied greatly between houses and rooms, from 40 mg up to
almost 800 mg, depending on the family’s lifestyle, house
conditions, and the last time the room was cleaned. The
participants were instructed not to clean the room for at least 3
days before sampling. All but three dust samples (D12, D14,
and D16) were sampled from one room. For these three
samples, pooled dust (living room and children’s and parents’
bedrooms) was used to extract enough material for analysis.
The samples were sieved through a 1 mm metallic strainer,
stored in aluminum foil, and kept at −20 °C until analysis.
2.1.3. Cat Food. Cat food, dry (n = 16) and wet (n = 12),
was selected and purchased based on what the cat owners
reported in the questionnaire. The major cat food brands were
covered, with most samples coming from Mjau, Royal Canin,
and Pussi (Table S2).
2.2. Chemicals and Analysis. Experimental details
regarding clinical analysis (i.e., determination of thyroid
hormone levels (T4, TSH) and blood lipids (cholesterol and
triglycerides)) and the chemical analysis (i.e., extraction and
cleanup procedures of serum, cat food, and house dust,
instrumental analysis, and quantification) are given in the
Supporting Information.
2.3. QA/QC. Two solvent blanks (1% KCl (w/v), 5 mL)
were run in parallel with the 19 serum samples to control any
potential background contamination. Cat serum and cat food
analysis were carried out in a cleanroom to keep contributions
from dust to a minimum, whereas the dust sample analyses
were performed in a common laboratory. Along with each
batch of cat serum samples (n = 19), two human plasma
samples (bought from Karolinska University Hospital in Solna,
Sweden in 2006) (5 mL) were analyzed in parallel as quality
control (QC). For dust analysis, five standard reference
material (SRM) samples from NIST (Organic contaminants
in house dust, SRM 2585) and 10 solvent blanks were analyzed
along with the dust samples. For cat food analysis, a pool of cat
food homogenate (Whiskas in gravy with Salmon in pouch)
was used as QC sample. One QC sample (10 g) and one
solvent blank were extracted along with each batch of cat food
(n = 6).
The extraction and cleanup method used here43 has
previously been fully evaluated regarding the analysis of
polybromophenols and OH-PBDEs in cat serum,44 and the
accuracy regarding PBDE analysis was evaluated by the analysis
of standard reference material (Organic contaminants in
nonfortified human serum, SRM 1957) from NIST and is
reported elsewhere.15 The quality of the dust analysis was
evaluated with SRM material, Organic contaminants in house
dust (SRM 2585). The in-house measured values (n = 5) for
the ten PBDEs ranged between 81% and 106% of the certified
NIST values (Figure S1), except for BDE-206 which was 58%
of the certified NIST value. Both BDE-206 and BDE-209 are
challenging to determine, which is for example reflected in the
elevated relative standard deviation for BDE-209 (33%).
In general, LOQ was determined as the smallest quantifiable
peak for the batch of samples analyzed and sample LOD was
then set to LOQ/3. However, if the compound to be analyzed
was present in the blank, LOD was set to the average amount
determined in the blanks and LOQ was set to three times the
value of LOD. The average amount of the blanks (if present)
was subtracted from the quantified amount in the sample. For
the statistical calculations, if a peak was >LOD and <LOQ, it
was given the value LOQ/√2, and levels <LOD were
considered to be zero.
2.4. Statistics. Due to heteroskedasticity of the data,
possibly containing outliers potentially exerting a strong
leverage effect on the regression line, the nonparametric
Mann-Kendall trend test45 based on the Kendall’s tau
coefficient (τ) was used to measure the association between
serum concentrations in cats and matched for dust and food
samples. As a robust alternative to ordinary regression lines, the
Kendall-Theil Robust line (i.e., the median slope among all
lines through pairs of two-dimensional sample points) is shown
in the figures. For comparison, the determination coefficient
(r2), a parametric regression test, was added in the correlation
plots. Since Kendall’s tau coefficient (τ) is more robust and
gives more reliable results than the determination coefficient
(r2), a significant correlation was only considered if both of
these tests were significant (p < 0.05). In addition, only positive
correlations between serum and dust/food concentrations were
assumed; therefore, one-tailed tests were applied. A significance
level of 5% was applied in the statistical analysis (α = 0.05).
Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the
four most abundant compounds in dust (BDE-47, BDE-99,
BDE-209, and DBDPE) to study a potential difference in
concentration and congener pattern between the living room
and children’s and parents’ bedrooms. Before the PCA-scores
were plotted, they were scaled to 100% and centered as follows:
the percentage of each compound (log-transformed concen-
tration relative to the sum) in each serum sample was calculated
and then centered by log-ratio transformation46,47 before the
PCA analysis to avoid a possible bias due to the compositional
nature of the data. The eigenvector loadings were added to the
PCA plot as vectors showing the magnitude of the relative
concentrations for each compound. The Hotelling’s 95%
confidence ellipses for the center of gravity for each group
were also calculated and plotted (i.e., the ellipse in which 95%
of all equally sized samples from the same populations is
expected to fall within). A Hotelling’s T squared test,48
including the individual compounds, was used to check for
significant differences in compound composition between the
two groups. The significant level was set to 5% (α = 0.05).

3.1. Brominated and Chlorinated Contaminants in Cat
Serum. The concentrations of the brominated analytes (pmol/
g lipid weight [lw]) and quantification frequency (%) in 19 cat
serum samples are reported in Table S3A, and the chlorinated
compounds are reported in Table S3B. All results are reported
on a molar basis to promote correct comparisons on
concentrations of contaminants independent of molecular
mass of the analyte.

 Among the neutral compounds, five PBDEs (BDE-47, -99,
-153, -183, and -209), BB-209, two PCBs (CB-138 and CB-
153), 4,4′-DDT, and 4,4′-DDE could be quantified. 4,4′-DDE
was found at the highest median concentration (42 pmol/g lw),
followed by BDE-209 (32 pmol/g lw), 4,4′-DDT (30 pmol/g
lw), CB-153 (28 pmol/g lw), and BB-209 (24 pmol/g lw). 2′-
MeO-BDE68 was the only methoxylated PBDE detected in cat
serum, and it was only found in two of the samples (2.6 and 3.2
pmol/g lw).
Three brominated phenols (2,4,6-TBP, 2′-OH-BDE68, and
6-OH-BDE47) and one chlorinated phenol (PCP) were
determined in the cat serum. Highest median concentration
was reported for 2,4,6-TBP (73 pmol/g lw) and was quantified
in 37% of the samples, and PCP (68 pmol/g lw) and 6-OH-
BDE47 (58 pmol/g lw) were found in 7% and 100% of the
samples, respectively.
Only BDE-183, BDE-209, and 6-OH-BDE47 were found in
100% of the samples. BB-209 was found in 89% and 4,4′-DDE
was found in 84% of the samples. 6-OH-BDE47 was the
dominating phenol, and for comparison to other studies, we
give the median concentration on a weight basis: 125 pg/g
serum (min 42 pg/g serum, max 1206 pg/g serum). Although
the conventional way of reporting phenolic compounds, not
associated with the blood lipids, is on a fresh weight basis, we
report all levels on a lipid weight basis to compare the exposure
profile from cat food and house dust.
Nine of 19 cat serum samples were pooled which made it
irrelevant to correlate the levels versus gender; only 4 individual
cats were females. The age could be tested though, as the
pooled cat serum samples came from siblings of the same age.
Only serum lipid content (p < 0.05), CB-138 (p < 0.02), CB-
153 (p < 0.02), and DDE (p < 0.004) increased significantly
with age of the cats.
3.2. Brominated Contaminants in House Dust. Eight-
een PBDE congeners (BDE-28, -47, -66, -99, -100, -153, -154,
-183, -194, -196, -197, -198, -201, -202, -206, -207, -208, and
BDE-209), BB-209, HBB, and DBDPE were detected in dust
samples from the cat owner’s homes. Dust samples were taken
from the living room and the children’s and parents’ bedrooms,
and the concentrations (pmol/g dw) are given in Table S4A,B.
The quantification frequency was 100% for the majority of the
PBDEs, but BDE-154, -183, -194, -196, -197, -198, -201, and
-202 had detection frequencies ranging between 56% and 98%.
Median concentrations of BB-209 were > LOD and only
quantified (>LOQ) in 27% of the dust samples. The highest
median concentrations were found in BDE-209 and DBDPE
(262 and 154 pmol/g dw) followed by BDE-47 and BDE-99
(32 and 27 pmol/g dw, respectively).
The relative distribution pattern and concentration differ-
ences among the different rooms for the four most abundant
flame retardants are visualized by principal component analysis
(PCA) in Figures 1 and S2. The PCA-plot in Figure S2 shows
equal distribution of the compounds among the various
investigated rooms within a household. Looking at concen-
tration differences, there was a tendency toward higher levels of
brominated flame retardants in the dust from the living rooms
compared to the dust from the children’s and parents’
bedrooms. However, this difference was not significant since
the Hotelling’s confidence ellipses (showing the 95%
confidence interval) for the living rooms and the two bedrooms
were not fully separated (Figure 1). This result could possibly
be due to a few extreme values, occasionally measured for the
bedrooms, disturbing the disparity. All data points were
included in the statistical analysis, so no extreme values were
considered outliers and excluded. The indicated higher levels
found are reasonable as many of these compounds are
associated with electronics which are found at a higher extent
in the living rooms.
3.3. Brominated and Chlorinated Contaminants in Cat
Food. The concentrations of the brominated analytes (pmol/g
lw) and quantification frequency (%) in dry and wet cat food
samples are reported in Table S5A, and the chlorinated
compounds are reported in Table S5B. Among the neutral
compounds, five PBDEs (BDE-47, -99, -153, -183, and -209),
BB-209, DBDPE, two MeO-PBDEs (2′-MeO-BDE68 and 6-
MeO-BDE47), two PCBs (CB-138 and CB-153), HCB, 4,4′-
DDT, and 4,4′-DDE were quantified in the dry and wet cat
food samples. 4,4′-DDE was present in the highest median
concentration (4.2 pmol/g lw), quantified in 96% of the cat
food samples. The second highest median concentrations were
measured for CB-138 (2.2 pmol/g lw), followed by BDE-209
(1.9 pmol/g lw), CB-153 (1.3 pmol/g lw), and 6-MeO-BDE47
(1.0 pmol/g lw). BB-209 was quantified in 43% of the samples
in a median concentration of 0.05 pmol/g lw, ranging from
<LOD to 2.4 pmol/g lw. DBDPE was found in 100% of the
analyzed cat food samples in a median concentration of 0.7
pmol/g lw. The quantification frequencies of 2′-MeO-BDE68
and 6-MeO-BDE47 were 78% and 89%, respectively, and the
median concentrations were 0.4 and 1.0 pmol/g lw,
respectively.
Three brominated phenols (i.e., 2,4,6-TBP, 2′-OH-BDE68,
6-OH-BDE47, and PCP) were determined in both dry and wet
cat foods. The quantification rates of 2,4,6-TBP, 2′-OH-
BDE68, and 6-OH-BDE47 were 81%, 24%, and 76%,
respectively. The highest median concentration was present
in 2,4,6-TBP (2.9 pmol/g lw), followed by PCP (1.5 pmol/g
lw) quantified in 70% of the samples and the two hydroxylated
PBDEs (6-OH-BDE47 (0.03 pmol/g lw) and 2′-OH-BDE68
(<LOD pmol/g lw)).
Interestingly, 4,4′-DDT was mainly detected in the dry cat
food as well as the higher brominated BDE-138, BDE-209, and
BB-209. In contrast, the phenolic compounds were found in a
higher quantification frequency and at higher concentrations in
the wet cat food.

 3.4. Correlation between Cat Serum and External
Exposure. The serum, dust, and food samples were matched
as described in Table S6, and a summary of mean and median
concentrations of some brominated compounds was analyzed
in cat serum, house dust, and cat food (Table 1).
Five PBDE congeners (BDE-47, -99, -153, -183, and -209)
and BB-209 were present in both cat serum and house dust for
comparison. The serum concentrations were age adjusted for
the persistent neutral compounds to ensure equal comparison
among cats of different ages. Cat serum concentrations were
compared to dust concentrations from the living room, the
children’s and parents’ bedrooms, and the sum of all rooms. A
significant correlation was found between cat serum and dust
from the living rooms (p < 0.035), parents’ bedrooms (p <
0.019), and compared to all rooms (p < 0.020) for BDE-99
(Figure 2) and the living rooms for BDE-47 (p < 0.035) and
BDE-153 (p < 0.039) (Figures S3 and S4, respectively).
However, BDE-47 had a detection frequency of 26% in serum,
so care should be taken when expressing the correlation as
significant for this congener
For BB-209, no significant correlation was found between
serum concentrations and the living room nor any other rooms,
but when combining all the rooms, a significant correlation (p <

S5). Three PBDE congeners (BDE-47, -99, and -209), BB-209,
two PCBs (CB-138 and CB-153), 4,4′-DDT, 4,4′-DDE, PCP,
2,4,6-TBP, 2′-OH-BDE68, and 6-OH-BDE47 were present in
the cat serum and cat food that were compared. A significant
correlation between serum levels and cat food was found for
(A) BB-209 (p < 0.007), (B) 2,4,6-TBP (p < 0.035), and (C) 6-
OH-BDE47 (p < 0.002) (Figure 3).
4. DISCUSSION
4.1. Cats’ Exposure to BFRs via Dust. This study
investigates cats’ exposure sources to BFRs and organo-
chlorines. The levels of PBDEs in dust quantified here are in
agreement with levels reported in dust from Stockholm houses
and apartments.49 Cats have been used as models for indoor
exposure of BFRs and organochlorines to look for possible
correlations between house dust concentrations9,11,39,40 and the
health status of cats.9−11,15,39,40 However, this is the first time a
correlation can be statistically confirmed between cat serum
and house dust, a result likely dependent on this study’s use of
paired samples. This study also explored differences in
concentrations between different rooms within a household.
Interestingly, most of the correlations were found between
serum and the living rooms, but serum concentrations showed
poor correlation with dust from the bedrooms. This can be due
to a higher concentration found in the living rooms as indicated
in Figure 1 or to the possibility that these cats spend more time
in the living rooms. Furthermore, when adding the dust
concentration from all rooms, the correlation between serum

 and dust for BDE-47 and BDE-153 was lost, possibly due to
dilution effects.
The concentrations of lower PBDE congeners in pet cats in
Sweden are within the same range as pet cats in the UK,39 1
order of magnitude lower than pet cats in Australia,9 and 200−
400 times lower than in pet cats in the US.40 The concentration
of BDE-209 has only been determined in pet cats from the
US40 and in stray cats in Japan,41 with reported median level of
290 and 60 pmol/g lw, respectively, compared to 32 pmol/g lw
determined in this study. The concentration range most
probably reflects the different standards for protection against
flammability in the different countries.22 The observation of no
correlation between serum concentrations of BDE-209 and
dust or food is likely explained by the short half-life of BDE-209
which has been observed in, for example, humans.50 BDE-209
dominated the dust levels; it was almost ten times higher than
BDE-47 and -99 concentrations.
When comparing serum from human adults and cat serum
from the same country/region, the PBDE concentrations are
typically higher in the cats.9,10,15,39 Serum concentrations of
BDE-47, BDE-99, and BDE-209 in pet cats presented in this
study are higher compared to the general Swedish human
population.15,51 Reported Swedish human serum concentra-
tions of BDE-209 are most likely linked to occasional exposures
to BDE-209.50 Also, the BDE-99 and BDE-209 congener profile
is significantly different between humans and cats, indicating
different exposure sources for these compounds. The BDE-47/-
99 ratio has frequently been used to demonstrate an exposure
to PentaBDE, which is around 1 in DE-71 and Bromkal 70-
5DE.52 The ratio of BDE-47/-99 in dust reported from this
study (1.1) is within the range of what was reported in indoor
dust from Australia, US, Canada, and the UK, which typically
was <1 (range 0.4−1).9 The ratio in humans is around 3−
10,39,51,53 whereas in cat serum it is <1 (range 0.3−0.9), results
also confirmed in this study (0.5).9,10,15,38−40 Only in serum
levels in Japanese stray cats was a higher ratio reported (2.1).41
This observation confirms the hypothesis that pet cats are
exposed to indoor dust, whereas stray cats do not have the
same exposure, spending no time in regular houses. The BDE-
47/-99 ratio extracted from analyzed and reported meat and
fish products used for human consumption are 1.5 and 6.5,
respectively,53 reflecting the ratio found in humans and stray
cats. Because all flavors from the same brand of cat food were
pooled in this study, no information on the ratio of BDE-47/
BDE-99 in the meat or fish was available.
4.2. Cats’ Exposure to BFRs and Halogenated
Phenolic Compounds via Food. In manufacturing cat
food, it is mandatory that the raw material of the flavor must
constitute at least 4% by weight. Commonly, a batch of cat food
consists mainly of abattoir offal (e.g., lung, heart, liver, kidney,
and throat) from mainly chicken (which is neutral in taste) but
also from pig and cattle. Flavor is added during the final step of
production. Hence 92−96% of the cat food from the same
producer is very similar across the various flavors. Dry food is
prepared in similar ways with a common batch boiled and then
dried. Despite similar content, differences could be seen
between dry and wet cat food. The higher brominated
compounds, BDE-183 and BDE-209, could only be found in
dry food, a finding also observed in another study.10 BB-209
was mainly found in dry food, although at low concentrations.
Phenolic compounds, on the other hand, were mainly found in
wet food and at a higher concentration than in dry food. The
highest concentrations of the phenolic compounds found in cat
food relates to 2,4,6-TBP followed by PCP. Both compounds
have a potency to bind to the transport protein for thyroxin and
thereby disrupt the thyroid hormone balance, implicating a
possible health effect on the cats.35 PCP has been reported at
high concentrations in pet cat samples from Japan, Pakistan,
and UK,38,39,42 but in this study, the concentrations are only
one-fifth of these concentrations. In the past, PCP was used to
preserve wood, but it may also be formed through the
metabolism of HCB.54
In cat serum, 6-OH-BDE47 (58 pmol/g lw) is the most
common analyte with its presence in all samples. Only one
more OH-PBDE (i.e., 2′-OH-BDE68) was detected in cat
serum but only in 21% of the samples. High concentrations of
6-OH-BDE47 have previously been reported in Japanese stray
cats (213 pmol/g lw), Swedish pet cats (135 pmol/g lw), and
UK cats (4.0 pmol/g lw).15,39,41 The origin of 6-OH-BDE47
and 2′-OH-BDE68 found in the cat serum is most likely
explained by food as a source rather than formed through
PBDE metabolism. In a recent publication, it was demonstrated
that cat liver microsomes have a very low capacity to oxidatively
transform BDE-47 to hydroxylated metabolites.16,55 5-OH-
BDE-47, which was the major metabolite followed by 3-OH-
BDE47, constituted 0.27% and 0.055% of total transformed
BDE-47. 6-OH-BDE-47 was only formed in trace amounts, i.e.,
0,005% of total BDE-47. These findings demonstrate differ-
ences in metabolic capacity between cats and humans.
Incubation of BDE-47 in human liver microsomes has
previously shown 6-OH-BDE47 and 5-OH-BDE47 to be the
major metabolites of human CYP-450 induced metabolism.16,28
The natural occurrence of OH-PBDEs is well-known.32,56 OH-
PBDEs and simple polybrominated phenols are produced
naturally in the marine environment by marine plants and may
enter the food chain by seafood.57,58 This is a possible route for
naturally produced compounds to end up in cat food. The
significant correlation between serum and food concentrations
that was found for 6-OH-BDE-47 further supports this
hypothesis. In another study, biotransformation of 6-MeO-
BDE47 and 2′-MeO-BDE68 found in cat foods to correspond-
ing hydroxylated analogues, i.e., 6-OH-BDE47 and 2′-OH-
BDE68, was demonstrated by in vitro incubation of cat liver
microsomes. This finding further strengthens the hypothesis of
food as a source for 6-OH-BDE47.55 In fact, the data from the
Japanese stray cats with low serum levels of BDE-47 further

 supports the evidence for this hypothesis since their food is
likely influenced by fish from the Pacific Ocean, where 6-OH-
BDE47 was first identified.32
6-OH-BDE47 could be detected in 76% of the cat food in
this present study, although at low levels. 6-MeO-BDE47 could
be detected in 89% of the cat food samples but not in any cat
serum samples. An earlier study of pooled cat serum indicated
quantitative levels of 2′-MeO-BDE68 in cat serum.59
BB-209 was quantified in almost all cat serum samples (89%)
and at levels (median 24 pmol/g lw) similar to BDE-209
(median 32 pmol/g lw) and the highly persistent CB-153 (28
pmol/g lw). BB-209 was reported in cat serum from two earlier
studies15,59 and in settled dust from a Swedish smelter facility
that recycles electronic scrap.60 It is evident that the flame
retardant is being circulated even though its commercial
production stopped in 2000.1,22 However, BB-209 may still be
migrating out of products from before the 1990s.61 A significant
correlation was found between serum concentrations of BB-209
and both house dust and cat food. The median concentrations
were 20 times and ∼500 times higher in serum than in house
dust and cat food, and the flame retardant was only detected
(>LOQ) in 27% of the dust samples and in 43% of the food
samples, indicating some additional exposure source(s). This
conclusion is supported by the fact that serum from five cats
from different households with median serum concentrations
(>LOQ) had no BB-209 detected in dust samples from their
homes nor in their food.
DBDPEs are present at relatively high levels and in all dust
and cat food samples but not detected in the cat serum. This
intriguing result could be interpreted as DBDPE having low
bioavailability in cats and/or rapid metabolism. A low uptake
following oral uptake is an observation recently reported in
rats.62 DBDPE has been reported in serum and milk from
nursing women in Canada, although only in 5.9% and 8.6% of
the samples63 and not at all in Norwegian women.64 Elevated
levels of DBDPE were reported in chicken eggs and chicken
from a recycling site in China.65 DBDPE was reported in 90%
of shellfish sampled along the French coastlines66 and at similar
concentrations to PBDEs in fish from several rivers in Spain.67
Considering the extensive application of DBDPE and reports
regarding its occurrence in the environment,68,69 it is crucial to
further investigate the properties of DBDPE and to identify
possible transformation products.
PCB concentrations measured in pet and stray cats from
different countries were within the same order of magnitude as
reported here, which demonstrates the worldwide distribution
of PCBs.15,38−41 The exposure pathway of PCBs indicate food
as the major route.70 Despite this assumption, no correlation
between cat serum concentrations of CB-153 in cat food and
cat serum levels was identified. In general, low levels of PCBs
are detected in house dust, and as PCBs are not applied to
indoor products, it is mainly the outdoor environment that
influences the levels found in house dust.37,71
The detection frequency and concentrations of 4,4′-DDT in
cat serum and cat food were low, and median concentrations
were < LOD and 0.57 pmol/g fat, respectively. 4,4′-DDE, on
the other hand, which is a metabolite of 4,4′-DDT, was present
at the highest concentrations in the cat serum (84% of the
samples) and cat food (96% of the samples) among the neutral
organochlorines. The concentrations of 4,4′-DDE in cat serum
were ten times higher than those found in cat food but lower
than those in cats from other countries where the highest
median levels were reported in cats from California, followed
by cats in Pakistan.38,40 Food is the major source of 4,4′-DDE,
but it is difficult to detect a correlation between matrices when
the sample concentration range is small, as in cat food. The
relative standard deviation (RSD) for 4,4′-DDE concentrations
in cat food was 64%, which could be compared to all other
analytes where the RSDs were >100%.
In conclusion, although the sample size analyzed here is
limited and the results should be viewed with caution, the
findings of a statistical valuable correlation between cat serum
concentrations and dust levels and the noncorrelation between
serum and cat food levels for BDE-47, BDE-99, and BDE-153
support the hypothesis that cats are exposed to PBDEs via dust.
This is also supported by similar ratios of BDE-47/-99 found in
cat serum and house dust. The higher ratio found in meat and
fish samples for human consumption is more similar to the
ratio generally found in humans, indicating adult human
exposure to BDE-47 and BDE-99 to be a food source.
The correlation of 6-OH-BDE47 between cat serum and cat
food supports the hypotheses of food as an exposure source of
the natural produced 6-OH-BDE47. Metabolic capacity for
BDE-47 in cats as demonstrated by cat liver microsomes is very
low, and 6-OH-BDE47 is formed in negligible amounts
(0.005% of BDE-47).
Both house dust and cat food have been linked as a source of
BB-209, although other sources need to be identified. About
35% of the cats had detectable levels of the flame retardant in
their blood although not in their food or in the dust samples
from the homes.
DBDPE was found in all dust and cat food samples, reflecting
the extensive application of this BFR, even though DBDPE was
not found in cat serum. Transformation of DBDPE should be
further investigated. 4,4′-DDE is still the major organohalogen
compound (OHC) found in the environment due to its high
persistence and ubiquitous contamination worldwide. All cat
serums contained BDE-209, whereas PCBs (CB-138 and CB-
153 used as a marker) were only quantified in 63% of the cat
samples. The concentrations of PBDE and PCB congeners
were within the same order of magnitude and did not differ
significantly. This study has confirmed the feasibility of using
cats as models for indoor exposure to BFRs via dust, an
exposure pathway especially important for children at a
sensitive stage of development.
