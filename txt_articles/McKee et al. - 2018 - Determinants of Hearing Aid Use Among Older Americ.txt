Abstract
Background and Objectives: Hearing loss (HL) is common among older adults and is associated with significant psycho-
social, cognitive, and physical sequelae. Hearing aids (HA) can help, but not all individuals with HL use them. This study 
examines how social determinants may impact HA use.
Research Design and Methods: We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed methods study involving a secondary ana-
lysis of a nationally representative data set, the Health and Retirement Study (HRS; n = 35,572). This was followed up with 
1:1 qualitative interviews (n = 21) with community participants to clarify our findings. Both samples included individuals 
aged 55 and older with a self-reported HL, with or without HA. The main outcome measure was the proportion of partici-
pants with a self-reported HL who use HA.
Results and Discussion: Analysis of HRS data indicated that younger, nonwhite, non-Hispanic, lower income, and less-
educated individuals were significantly less likely to use HA than their referent groups (all p values < .001). Area of resi-
dence (e.g., urban) were not significantly associated with HA use. Qualitative findings revealed barriers to HA included 
cost, stigma, vanity, and a general low priority placed on addressing HL by health care providers. Facilitators to obtaining 
and using HA included family/friend support, knowledge, and adequate insurance coverage for HA.
Implications: Many socioeconomic factors hinder individuals’ ability to obtain and use HA, but these obstacles appeared 
to be mitigated in part when insurance plans provided adequate HA coverage, or when their family/friends provided 
encouragement to use HA.

Hearing loss (HL), the second most common disability, 
affects 17% of Americans (Agrawal, Platz, & Niparko, 
2008; Cruickshanks et al., 1998; Ries, 1994) and occurs 
predominantly in older persons: 29% of people 50–59, 45% 
of those 60–69, 68% of those 70–79, and 89% of those 
≥80 years of age (Lin, Niparko, & Ferrucci, 2011). The 
adverse effects of HL are well-documented and include both 
reduced ability to perform independent activities of daily 
living and reduced quality of life (Gopinath et al., 2012). 
 
These individuals struggle with social isolation, lower 
income (Agrawal et al., 2008), reduced cognitive function 
(Wallhagen, Strawbridge, & Shema, 2008), poorer physical 
and psychological health (McKee, Stransky, & Reichard, 
2018; Solheim, Kværner, & Falkenberg, 2011), increased 
risk of falls and hospitalization (Danermark & Gellerstedt, 
2004; Genther, Frick, Chen, Betz, & Lin, 2013; Lin, Thorpe,

 Gordon-Salant, & Ferrucci, 2011), and worse patient–
physician communication (Mick, Foley, & Lin, 2014). 
 
HL remains underdiagnosed and untreated. Multiple stud-
ies show that at least 75% of persons with HL do not 
receive treatment despite the fact that hearing aid (HA) use 
has been shown to reduce communication barriers, as well 
as disability-related effects of HL (Cacciatore et al., 1999; 
Metselaar et al., 2009). There remain substantial barriers to 
HA acquisition, most notably financial. Medicare and most 
health insurance plans do not provide coverage for HA, 
which are largely expected to be an out-of-pocket expense 
(Cohen-Mansfield & Taylor, 2004; Whitson & Lin, 2014). 
Considering the average cost of a pair of fitted HA in 2014 
was between $2,200 and $7,000, this is a substantial bar-
rier for many individuals (Whitson & Lin, 2014).
It is not as well understood how other social determi-
nants, including area of residence and health literacy, may 
affect whether individuals use HA. The primary objective 
of this mixed methods study was twofold: (a) to examine 
the effect of socioeconomic determinants and area of resi-
dence, on HA use among individuals aged 55 and older 
with HL using a nationally representative sample; and (b) 
further explore any relevant findings through qualitative 
interviews with community participants with HL. A sec-
ondary objective looked at effect of health literacy on HA 
use using a subset of the HRS sample in which the data 
were available.
Methods
First, we conducted a secondary data analysis using data 
from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We then 
conducted qualitative interviews with a small group of 
community participants with HL, unrelated to the HRS 
sample, to understand more in depth both the dynamics 
underlying the quantitative results as well as the role of 
other factors, such as stigma, that HRS does not currently 
attempt to measure. This explanatory sequential mixed 
methods design allowed us to understand more fully the 
determinants of HA use than either qualitative or quantita-
tive approaches alone would allow.
Quantitative Data Analysis
Procedures
We used publicly available data from the HRS, a nationally 
representative longitudinal study of older Americans. The 
design and history of the study are described in detail else-
where (Sonnega et al., 2014); for our purposes, the HRS has 
two key questions which asked the participant to self-assess 
their hearing and whether they have HA. Respondents are 
first asked whether they ever wear a HA. This was used to 
determine the study (have HA) versus control samples (no 
HA) within a group of persons reporting HL. Respondents 
are then asked to assess their hearing as excellent, very 
good, good, fair, or poor; if they have reported use of 
a HA, they are asked to assess their hearing with a HA. 
Respondents who report fair or poor hearing or report ever 
wearing a HA were included in our sample of interest (e.g., 
individuals with self-assessed HL). A random subset of the 
HRS respondents also participated in the 2011 Health Care 
Mail Study, which contained health literacy data. The HRS 
includes detailed information on health, demographic back-
ground, and socioeconomic status (SES) of respondents.
HRS Sample
HL is more common among older adults, especially those 
aged 55 and older (Nash et al., 2011; National Institute 
on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, 2016). 
Thus, we selected only subjects aged 55 and older who 
self-reported having difficulty hearing in the HRS. We used 
HRS for 1998–2012 because HRS became representative of 
older adults in 1998, and it continues to be representative 
of this population since then with refreshed samples. Our 
baseline sample included 35,572 individual-year observa-
tions who reported having HL (with HA = 13,248; without 
HA = 22,317; missing info on HA = 7).
Dependent and Explanatory Variables
Our outcome measure is a dichotomized variable which is 
indicative of the respondent using HA. Our explanatory 
variables of interest were urban–rural status of respondent’s 
county, SES, and health literacy. The urban–rural measure is 
based on the National Center of Health Statistics (NCHS) 
classification which includes six categories ranging from 
the most urban areas (large central metropolitan) to the 
most rural areas (noncore): (a) large central metro; (b) large 
fringe metro (suburb); (c) medium metro; (d) small metro; 
(e) micropolitan; and (f) noncore. Respondents’ demo-
graphic and socioeconomic status includes education, total 
income (including spouse’s), total household wealth, age, 
race, ethnicity, and health insurance type. Respondents’ 
health literacy is assessed using the Rapid Estimate of 
Adult Literacy in Medicine-Revised (REALM), although 
this measure is available only for a small subset of respond-
ents. Insurance status is stratified by age groups: uninsured, 
private insurance, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration 
(VA) insurance for age group 55–64; and Medicare only, 
Medicare with private insurance, Medicare with Medicaid, 
and Medicare with VA insurance for age 65 and older.
Statistical Analyses
We conducted a pooled cross-sectional analysis in which 
the unit of observation was the person-year. To assess dif-
ferences in HA use by demographic and socioeconomic 
characteristics, we adjusted for measures of gender, age, 
race/ethnicity, and survey year in the multivariable logis-
tic regression analyses. To examine differences in HA use 
by the urban/rural status of residential area and health lit-
eracy, we adjusted for gender, age, race/ethnicity, education, 
income, wealth, and survey year. To examine differences

 in HA use depending on insurance status, we conducted 
multivariable logistic regressions that were stratified by 
age groups, 55–64 and 65+. We adjusted for demographic 
measures and socioeconomic measures sequentially in the 
multivariable logistic regressions. All analyses accounted 
for the complex designs of the surveys, including cross-sec-
tional sample weights, sampling units, and strata.
Qualitative Data Collection and Analysis
To better interpret the findings from the quantitative data 
analysis, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a 
community sample of individuals with HL. Findings from 
the quantitative phase were used to build the interview 
protocol.
Participants and Recruitment
We recruited a purposive sample of individuals with HL to 
ensure that community participants were diverse and aged 
55 years and older. Recruitment for the interviews was done 
through community flyers posted at local libraries, laun-
dromats, University of Michigan family medicine clinics, 
and Craigslist online. Interested participants were screened 
initially by our research staff member for their eligibility 
(i.e., aged 55 or older, presence of HL, and ability to speak 
English). There were five additional screening questions 
that asked about educational attainment, race, ethnicity, 
income, and HA use. These additional screening questions 
helped ensure a diverse sample required to further explain 
the findings from the HRS analyses. Initially, a total of 23 
participants were scheduled for interviews but two partici-
pants were later disqualified. The disqualification was due 
to participants later admitting that they had normal hear-
ing. The final qualitative sample is based on interviews with 
21 participants aged 55 years and older who took part in 
1:1 semi-structured interviews between the Fall of 2016 and 
the Spring of 2017 at various locations around Southeast 
Michigan. Participants were reimbursed $30 for their time.
Procedures
All volunteering participants provided written informed 
consent to participate. Participants completed a short demo-
graphic survey before the interview. Based on the results of 
our HRS analysis, we developed a semi-structured inter-
view guide designed to learn more about the individuals’ 
HL background (e.g., how diagnosed), potential barriers 
and facilitators on HA use, and how HL may have affected 
them socially and physically. The interview questions were 
designed to probe potential explanations for why a subject 
may or may not use a HA. This included potential probes 
on social support, personal perspectives, health care inter-
actions, and sources of HL and HA information that were 
missing from the HRS analyses.
Interviews were conducted by research staff trained 
in qualitative data collection. Interviews were conducted 
in community settings, were audio-recorded, and lasted 
approximately 40 min. The interviewer recorded field 
notes during each interview, including relevant emotional 
responses to any particular question or interview portion.
Qualitative Data Analysis
Audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed. We used 
an iterative process for thematic analysis of the inter-
view transcripts and field notes: (a) familiarized ourselves 
with the data; (b) generated initial codes; (c) discussed 
and reached consensus for codes; (d) searched for themes 
and patterns among participants; (e) reviewed themes; (f) 
defined and named themes; and (g) produced a codebook 
to be used with any subsequent transcript. Each transcript 
was coded independently by the PI and by two research 
assistants with the use of Dedoose software. Each tran-
script was compared to the emerging themes and themes 
were adapted to best represent the data. We created a table 
listing qualitative themes of the specific domains of HA use 
determinants. The frequency means of reported barriers 
and facilitators for each theme expressed by each applica-
ble participant is displayed along with highlighted quotes. 
The qualitative data were used to help interpret the quan-
titative findings as part of an explanatory sequential mixed 
methods design (Guetterman, Fetters, & Creswell, 2015).
Results
In our HRS data sample of 35,572 adults aged 55 and older 
with self-reported HL, those using HA were more likely 
to be older, non-Hispanic white, educated, and wealthier 
 
(p < .001; Table 1); these effects persisted in multivaria-
ble models that include all of the demographic covariates 
(Table 1). Gender, area of residence, and health literacy 
were not significant predictors of HA use in the multivari-
able models (Table 1). Non-Hispanic black and those with 
<HS degree were the least likely to use HA (odds ratio 
[OR] = 0.36 and 0.43, respectively; p value < .001 for 
both). In supplemental analyses splitting the sample into 
<65 and ≥65 age groups, those with the VA provided health 
insurance were more likely to use HA even after controlling 
for demographic and socioeconomic variables (OR = 2.25; 
p < .001 and 1.26; p = .009, respectively for <65 and ≥65 
age groups). For all other health insurance types, we found 
that insurance was not associated with having HA after 
controlling for demographic and socioeconomic covariates 
(Table 2). Although individuals with inadequate health lit-
eracy were less likely to use HA, this result was not statisti-
cally significant (OR = 0.82; p = .56).
The 21 participants interviewed for the qualitative aim of 
this study were mostly female, white, and had at least some 
college education (refer to Table 3 for participant demo-
graphics). Qualitative analysis revealed more barriers to 
using HA than facilitators. Commonly mentioned barriers 
included cost, inadequate or unclear insurance coverage for

 HA, vanity/ego, and a general low priority placed by health 
care providers to address potential HL in their patients 
(Table 4). Facilitators to using HA included family/friend 
support, knowledge, and adequate insurance coverage for 
HA. The following sections detail findings from the quanti-
tative and qualitative mixed methods data sets.
Out of Pocket Costs
In our quantitative analyses (HRS), wealth was found to be 
an important driver of HA ownership and use. After adjust-
ing for controls, subjects in the lowest wealth category 
were half as likely to use HA when compared to the high-
est wealth group (Table 1). This was explored in depth in 
our 1:1 interviews with community respondents. Those 
revealed that cost was the most commonly mentioned bar-
rier, along with inadequate or absent insurance coverage 
for HA. For lower income interview participants (<$25,000 
annual household income), there were frequent discussions 
about the need to prioritize income and resources to cover 
essentials such as rent and food before HA.
Participant 14: My income is such that that doesn’t 
leave me—by the time I get through the medical, there’s 
no food money, gas money or anything else money. So,

 you know, there’s just nothing else (for me to get hearing 
aids). (lines 164–166)
For participants reporting <$25,000 annual household 
income, HA ownership facilitators were resources that 
are available for low-income groups or those looking for 
employment opportunities. For example, vocational reha-
bilitation provided individuals with HA.
Participant 12: [vocational rehab service] ended up pay-
ing for [hearing aids]. It was according to my income, 
but at the time I was not working at all, so therefore 
they paid for it. (lines 425–445)
Several participants commented on the lack of HA cov-
erage with their public insurance, notably Medicaid and 
Medicare. Private insurance coverage for HA was critical 
for many of the interviewees’ ability to acquire HA regard-
less of their income classification. Most participants in the 
1:1 interviews commented on the limitations of their insur-
ance coverage related to HA. Medicare does not cover HA, 
Medicaid does in only a few states (but not in Michigan), 
and private plans may or may not cover HA. Participants 
with private coverage for HA reported that it was critical 
for their ability to obtain HA that they might not have been 
able to afford otherwise.
Participant 15 (in response what was most helpful to 
you in obtaining the hearing aids): Finding out that 
my insurance would cover ‘em, because of the expense. 
I know a lot of people with hearing difficulties; Medicare 
will not pay for hearing aids. And uh I just happened 
to be lucky that I retired from [xxx] and have private 
insurance... (lines 197–207)
Stigma of HL
Non-Hispanic blacks reported the lowest HA use of any 
race and ethnic groups (AOR = 0.35, p value < .001). In 
subsequent interviews with black participants, the stigma 
of HL was especially palpable, much more so than with 
other participants reporting other racial backgrounds. 
One black male added he declined hearing testing and 
HA fitting since he felt it would affect “his ego, identity,

Vanity
I stopped wearing them for a couple years, ‘cause I was 
in church one Sunday, and this young man said, “Oh 
Ms. XXX!” real loud, “You got hearing aids!” And then 
it embarrassed me so it just kind of blew my mind and 
I stopped wearing them for a couple years, like I said, and

Stigma
I know that eventually I’ll get the hearing checked to the 
point that if I do need a hearing aid, I can get one. I’m 
not- I’m not against getting one, I just turned 60 so I’m just 
kind of like mmmm (shrugs and laughs). I’m not mentally 
ready for one, but I know I have a problem with hearing.

Medical costs vs other expenses
I receive social security. I don’t get any other government 
subsidies. So I get no help with food. I pay for my own 
Medicare. I uh pay Ann Arbor rent. I don’t have a subsidy. So 
you know, my funds are very limited. Like after I pay all my 
bills and everything, I have $200 a month. I have to live off 
that. (Participant 20)
Complex/other chronic diseases, 
medical needs
My income is such that that doesn’t leave me- by the time 
I get through the medical, there’s no food money, gas money 
or anything else money. So, you know, there’s just nothing 
else. ... My credit card’s maxed out from five years of other 
medical issues (laughs), hospital things. (Participant 14)
Cost
I couldn’t afford $5,000 for hearing aids. Period. (Participant 
15)
Navigating health insurance 
plan
I’m not sure if hearing aids are covered on my insurance 
or not ... I’m on disability and so after like 2 years, they 
automatically switch you to Medicare, so I believe that, I still 
have the Medicaid, and I think that kicks in second, but I’m 
still trying to navigate. (Participant 17)

Insurance covers HA
I have good insurance, you know, there’s money there to 
cover it. (Participant 5)
I got new insurance. And that allowed me to uh get another 
set of hearing aids. I wasn’t really ready for them … but 
I didn’t have a back-up set. (Participant 7)

 self-worth, [attributes] of a man” (participant 22). Even 
for the one black participant who was able to obtain a 
HA, there was a strong sense of embarrassment that pre-
vented her from using her HA for a number of years (refer 
to below).
Participant 23: …I stopped wearing them for a couple of 
years, cause I was in church one Sunday, and this young 
man said, “Oh Ms. XXX!” real loud, “You got hearing 
aids!” And then it embarrassed me so it just kind of blew 
my mind and I stopped wearing them for a couple years, 
like I said, and that caused my hearing to get worse.
Unlike the HRS findings, qualitative analyses also suggested 
some differences between individuals by gender. For exam-
ple, female participants described vanity as a barrier to HA 
use, while male participants were more likely to minimize 
their HL or state that they could manage without HA.
Participant 5 (female): I was only in my 50s then, so 
I didn’t want to do anything about it, but now I hit 60 
this year, maybe it’s time I do something so I can hear. . . 
. But think mostly it’s just that mentality of, just not- the 
hearing aid means I’m really old. I’m not ready to be 
really old. (lines 110–111 and 129–130)
Participant 4 (male): The largest issue is communicating 
with my wife. I- I’m not too proud to admit that I have 
some hearing loss, but I don’t think I have as much as 
she thinks I have. That’s why I went to get the [hearing] 
tests last year. (lines 29–31) . . . they [audiologist] said 
it was mild loss and they thought it would be consist-
ent with- they also told me I had tinnitus, which I know 
I have. . . They said it was consistent with aging, that 
uh, so I asked them, “Do I need hearing aids?” And they 
said, “You might benefit from them” but they didn’t say 
you would [definitely] benefit from them. So based on 
that, I didn’t get ‘em. (lines 93–98)
Health Care Providers
Primary care providers (PCP) facilitated the process of 
acquiring HA for several of the participants who reported 
higher income. Participants reported that helpful actions by 
their PCPs included asking or talking about the HL, includ-
ing its impact on the individual’s life, setting up a referral 
to audiology, and/or providing additional resources such as 
the Hearing Loss Association of America.
Participant 15: Finding an audiologist is probably the 
primary thing. You know, who do you trust. Who do 
you, you know, wanna go see. And I had nowhere, I had 
no idea where to start. (lines 234–236)
Participant 12: Dr. [xxx] initially referred me over to 
[xxx] way back in the 80s. I’ve been her patient for a 
long time. A [referral] came about through our conver-
sation [on hearing loss]. (lines 493–504)
For some participants, if the PCP did not initiate this dis-
cussion, no action was taken to address the HL, thereby 
affecting their ability to acquire HA.
Participant 19: (Interviewer—Have you ever talked with 
your primary care provider hearing concerns?)—No. It’s 
embarrassing . . . it’s like I’m getting old.
This contrasted with more negative PCP feedback among 
participants with lower income. These participants reported 
that PCPs not only failed to screen, but were dismissive or 
not helpful explaining about the importance of addressing 
HL. This posed a substantial barrier for subjects who did 
not get tested and acquire HA.
Participant 5: I think the thing the doctor could of done 
is at a certain age, give me information about, [hearing 
loss], what to do or what to look for, that type of thing 
. . . The only for it is that audiology test, and unless you 
think you have a problem with it, there’s no reason to 
get it. To my knowledge, um, and I’ve worked in the 
doctor’s office, the PCP’s office for 12 years, and I . . .  
I don’t know if anybody, check the hearing, but it’s rare. 
Nothing like the eyes or the feet or you know, other 
things. (lines 577–582)
Participant 22. (in response to if the subject has ever 
talked with the provider about hearing concerns): Yes. 
Interviewer: Okay, what have you talked about? P: Well 
if [hearing loss] gets worse, we’ll sound you out and 
all of that kind of stuff. We’ll deal with it then. (lines 
279–284)
Participant 3: (in response if the primary care provider 
responded to the patient’s complaint of hearing loss) 
No, the primary physician had no [helpful] comment. 
They said, “Go see a hearing aid [specialist]” or some-
thing like that- very low key compared to what we’re 
talking about. (lines 309–322)
Participants valued health care providers’ recommendations 
and when the providers failed to give specific hearing centers 
and/or audiologists to see, the subjects appeared less inclined 
to complete the referral. There appeared to be an ongoing 
stigma attached to audiologists as salespeople trying to sell 
more HA rather than addressing the HL appropriately.
Participant 2: I think deciding who to go trust a- to do 
the exam and so on. I mean people who are businesses 
that do audiology testing and sell hearing aids, I think 
have um, they might be really good at it, but they might 
also wanna push you toward spending money. Now if 
I were doing [obtaining hearing aids], I would ask my 
doctor first for a recommendation, and then I would 
probably ask my friends [next]. (lines 269–274)
Audiology and hearing health professionals were men-
tioned some of the times as facilitators among those who 
obtained a HA. Multiple participants remarked on these 
professionals’ efforts to research community, government,

 and/or health insurance resources to get the HA discounted 
or subsidized. Participants commented that they were 
linked to vocational rehabilitation to obtain HA coverage 
(Participant 12), provided additional discounts to increase 
HA affordability, and that hearing health professionals 
even explored additional insurance coverage on behalf of 
the patient (Participant 7).
Significant Others
Participants indicated that their family members were 
important drivers of whether individuals underwent hear-
ing testing and/or obtained HA. Participants reported that 
this often reflected desperation or frustration in response 
to the impact that HL had on their relationships and their 
ability to communicate with each other.
Participant 7: It was just through frustration of family 
members and friends saying you know let’s, let’s, we we 
gotta, we gotta get on top of this. They took me back 
and went through a battery of tests to find out why 
I have this hearing problem. (lines 123–125)
Participant 3: (Interviewer: So how did you end up 
then—so didn’t you do anything at the last appoint-
ment. How did you end up at the um hearing aid center, 
actually purchasing a hearing aid?) My wife bugged me 
enough, I decided it was easier to go get a hearing check- 
or discuss getting hearing aids than it was to um, argue 
with her. (lines 247–251)
Friends, especially peers who also had HL, were consid-
ered good resources to better understand how they can get 
appropriately tested and, more importantly, find out how 
they can get their HA covered to some extent. There were 
also comments in which friends steered subjects with HL 
away from obtaining HA.
Participant 9: I have a couple friends who um wear 
hearing aids and umm . . . my one friend has a cou-
ple of pairs, and like she has to- had to add ‘em to her 
renters insurance because she couldn’t afford to replace 
them if something happened. And the other guy I know, 
he’s constantly like trying to put more batteries. I think 
he needs new batteries, because he can’t hear even with 
them in, and um he’s always like trying to change the 
batteries, because he thinks the batteries are the problem 
. . . I don’t know if it’s covered by insurance and um 
I think it should be, because that probably keeps a lot of 
people from looking into it too because like my friend 
told me, hers are $5,000 each. And she told me it’s not 
covered insurance. (lines 81–202)
Discussion
Despite evidence demonstrating the benefits of HA use 
in improving psychosocial and communication abili-
ties among individuals with HL (Cacciatore et al., 1999; 
Metselaar et al., 2009), our findings confirm that there 
remain substantial barriers to obtaining HA. The primary 
barriers identified in our study are financial inability, lack 
of insurance coverage for HA, vanity or stigma related to 
the HL or HA ownership, and lack of support and/or prior-
itizing by health care providers to address the HL.
HL represents a significant economic burden for indi-
viduals (Cassel, Penhoet, & Saunders, 2016), with the 
average expense of a single HA costing several thousands 
of dollars (Bainbridge & Wallhagen, 2014; Knudsen, 
Öberg, Nielsen, Naylor, & Kramer, 2010). The medi-
cal related costs associated with HL among older adults 
in the United States totaled about $3.1 billion in 2010 
(Bainbridge & Ramachandran, 2014). When financial bar-
riers were minimized, either through insurance coverage 
for HA or from other resources (e.g., vocational rehabilita-
tion), HA use improved among our community respond-
ents. Unfortunately, outside of VA health insurance, which 
provides full HA coverage, insurance was not associated 
with HA use in our supplemental HRS analyses. Medicaid, 
viewed as a stopgap for millions of Americans to ensure 
they have health care coverage, fails to provide HA cover-
age in most states (Hearing Loss Association of America, 
2015). Medicare, the main health insurance for people 
65 years of age and older, does not cover the cost of HA 
(Whitson & Lin, 2014) at all, despite recommendations by 
the National Academies of Medicine to do so (National 
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2016). 
Many participants in our qualitative interviews mentioned 
the lack of coverage as a major barrier to obtaining HA. 
This echoes the findings of the National Committee to 
Preserve Social Security and Medicare, who found that “70 
percent of Americans between age 65 and 84 with HL are 
not using HA because Medicare does not cover them, and 
paying for the devices out-of-pocket is expensive” (Warren, 
2017). There is a recent push for over-the-counter HA, as a 
strategy for reducing cost, but it is unclear to what extent 
this will be successful in overcoming many of the barri-
ers listed above (Healthy Hearing, 2017). For example, an 
international study on HA use discovered barriers (e.g., HL 
stigma) remained even in countries that provide full HA 
coverage (Hougaard, Ruf, & Egger, 2013).
We also found that HL stigma continues to be a signifi-
cant issue, especially among our black participants. Female 
respondents, regardless of their racial background, were 
frequently concerned about the potential negative effect of 
using HA on their appearance. One strategy that should be 
explored to address these barriers would be public service 
announcements or ad campaigns highlighting celebrities 
who use HA to address their HL. Despite the frequency 
in which HL occurs among older patients, many PCPs put 
lower priority in addressing HL (Zazove, McKee, et al., 
2017; Zazove, Plegue, et al., 2017). Additionally, most 
PCPs are not comfortable with diagnosing and discussing 
HL as well (Zazove, McKee, et al., 2017; Zazove, Plegue, 
et al., 2017). Several participants brought this up during 
their interviews, describing the lack of engagement of their

 PCP regarding HL. This is largely reflective of the PCP’s 
lack of training on this topic, as well as the perception that 
this will unlikely be covered by insurance (Zazove, McKee, 
et al., 2017; Zazove, Plegue, et al., 2017).
A number of participants in our interviews also 
expressed concerns that audiologists and hearing health 
centers were focused on sales rather than hearing health. 
These negative experiences should be a clear reminder that 
hearing health providers should ensure that patients are 
given opportunities to express hearing complaints. For 
example, audiology centers need to be clear that HA, while 
helpful, do not completely compensate for HL or prevent 
its sequelae. Also, many consumers are not aware of their 
HA purchase rights to be able to test and return HA for 
a full refund or to switch to a different HA. The incon-
sistent HA coverage under insurance may be discouraging 
patients from even checking if HA are a covered benefit 
or not.
There are several steps that can be taken to improve HA 
uptake. First, the out-of-pocket cost for HA purchases is 
a significant issue that warrants action by policy makers, 
especially the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
These policy makers should consider the potential benefits 
of covering HA especially in regards to their psychosocial, 
cognitive, and even physical long-term health. In addi-
tion, the association of HL with poorer health outcomes 
is another factor that potentially could be ameliorated if 
CMS provided coverage for HA. Another potentially help-
ful step would be to include training programs to inform 
PCPs on the importance of addressing HL and how best to 
do this. This could include more teaching in medical school 
or residencies, or the use of innovative online education 
materials. The quality of HA have improved dramatically 
over the past few years, offsetting much of the sequela of 
HL. Health care providers and organizations can help des-
tigmatize HL by educating patients about the importance 
of addressing their HL through the use of HA. Public ser-
vice announcements or ad campaigns can be tailored to tar-
get specific subgroups, including racial minorities, to help 
improve HA acceptance. This will also help patients who 
struggle with vanity and negative perceptions of agism and 
disability (Wallhagen, 2010).
Limitations
This study had some limitations. First, because HL in the 
HRS is self-reported, we have no objective measure of an 
individual’s degree, type, and laterality of HL. Individuals’ 
perceptions of HL severity may vary from individual to indi-
vidual. However, self-reported HL has been shown in the 
literature to correlate well with objective measures of HL 
(Chou, Dana, Bougatsos, Fleming, & Beil, 2011; Croswell 
& Webber, 2013). A small subsample of participants also 
received pure tone hearing assessments through a survey 
wave called the ADAMS. The pure tone audiometry was 
assessed for both ears by HRS research staff (not audiolo-
gists) at the following frequencies: 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000 
Hz at 40 decibels. Each frequency was scored as passed or 
not passed. There was a 64.2% agreement between self-
reported HL and pure tone audiometry suggesting a HL 
(kappa = 0.31; p < .001).
Second, for the qualitative phase of this study we were 
unable to interview the same participants who had partici-
pated in the HRS. Instead, we used a community sample 
that mirrored the age restriction of the quantitative sample 
(55 years and older) and included both men and women 
with diverse educational attainment, income, and race. To 
ensure qualitative validity, we had an external review of the 
data by team members not involved in research design or 
data collection (Creswell & Miller, 2000). To ensure mixed 
methods validity (Creswell, 2009), we used the quantita-
tive findings to identify the interesting and unexpected 
results that was subsequently explored qualitatively. Future 
research could expand upon our findings to integrate quan-
titative and qualitative data from the same sample.
Third, despite efforts to recruit a Hispanic participant 
with a HL in our qualitative interviews, we were unsuccess-
ful; we also had relatively few other types of under-repre-
sented minority ethnic groups. Further studies are needed 
to explain why Hispanics in HRS are less likely than non-
Hispanics to have HA, and to more fully understand how 
other ethnic minority populations perceived HL and HAs. 
Finally, we had no way to determine from the HRS survey 
how much participants used their HA.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our study identified a variety of potential 
barriers and facilitators regarding HA use. The most prom-
inent were cost, lack of insurance coverage, stigma, vanity, 
and poor understanding and support of getting HL care 
by PCPs. In addition, under-represented minorities were 
less likely to have HA; we found a strong stigma of HA 
among African Americans. It appears that certain sociode-
mographic characteristics also predisposed respondents to 
HA use, including higher income, nonminority racial/ethnic 
status, and higher education. Further research is needed to 
better understand how to improve the hearing health care 
of persons with HL.
