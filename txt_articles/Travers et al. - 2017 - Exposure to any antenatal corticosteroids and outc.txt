ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To determine whether exposure to any antenatal 
corticosteroids is associated with a lower rate of death 
at each gestational age at which administration is 
currently recommended.
Design
Prospective cohort study.
settings
300 participating neonatal intensive care units of the 
Pediatrix Medical Group in the United States.
PartiCiPants
117 941 infants 23 0/7 to 34 6/7 weeks’ gestational age 
born between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2013.
exPOsure
Any antenatal corticosteroids.
Main OutCOMes Measures
Death or major hospital morbidities analyzed by 
gestational age and exposure to antenatal 
corticosteroids with models adjusted for birth weight, 
sex, mode of delivery, and multiple births.
results
Infants exposed to antenatal corticosteroids (n=81 832) 
had a significantly lower rate of death before discharge 
at each gestation 29 weeks or less, 31 weeks, and 
33-34 weeks compared with infants without exposure 
(range of adjusted odds ratios 0.32 to 0.55). The 
number needed to treat with antenatal corticosteroids 
to prevent one death before discharge increased from 
six at 23 and 24 weeks’ gestation to 798 at 34 weeks’ 
gestation. The rate of survival without major hospital 
morbidity was higher among infants exposed to 
antenatal corticosteroids at the lowest gestations. 
Infants exposed to antenatal corticosteroids had lower 
rates of severe intracranial hemorrhage or death, 
necrotizing enterocolitis stage 2 or above or death, 
and severe retinopathy of prematurity or death 
compared with infants without exposure at all 
gestations less than 30 weeks and most gestations for 
infants born at 30 weeks’ gestation or later.
COnClusiOn
Among infants born from 23 to 34 weeks’ gestation, 
antenatal exposure to corticosteroids compared with 
no exposure was associated with lower mortality and 
morbidity at most gestations. The effect size of 
exposure to antenatal corticosteroids on mortality 
seems to be larger in infants born at the lowest 
gestations.
Introduction
In meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of 
antenatal corticosteroids analyzed by gestational age at 
birth, death was decreased in the subgroup of preterm 
infants born at 30-34 weeks’ gestation but not in the 
subgroup born before 30 weeks’ gestation, in part 
because of the small sample size.1 2  These same 
meta-analyses also analyzed by gestational age at trial 
entry and found a lower rate of death among infants 
from 26 weeks’ gestation and higher. As current guide-
lines recommend the administration of antenatal corti-
costeroids to women at risk of preterm delivery from 24 
0/7 to 34 6/7 weeks’ gestation and agree on considering 
administration from 23 0/7 to 23 6/7
,3-5  further random-
ized controlled trials are unlikely to be conducted in 
this population. The current recommendations for 
infants at the lowest gestations are based on limited evi-
dence from randomized controlled trials, but the exten-
sion of the recommendation to consider administration 
below 24 weeks is based on consensus and recent 
observational studies in selected populations.3-10
As some of the benefits of antenatal corticosteroids 
differ by gestational age,1 2 the objective of this study 
was to determine the presence and magnitude of the 
association between antenatal corticosteroids and out-
comes at each gestational age for which this treatment 
is currently recommended. We hypothesized that in 
preterm infants with a gestational age of 23 0/7 to 34 6/7 
weeks, exposure to antenatal corticosteroids compared 
with no exposure to antenatal corticosteroids would be 
associated with a lower rate of hospital mortality (pri-
mary outcome) and major morbidities at each gesta-
tional age.
Methods
This study analyzed data collected prospectively at 300 
participating neonatal intensive care units in the 
United States for the database of the Pediatrix Clinical 
Data Warehouse. This database includes clinical data 
acquired electronically from medical records of all 
WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Guidelines recommend administration of antenatal corticosteroids to infants from 
24 to 34 weeks’ gestation and consideration of administration at 23 weeks’ gestation
The extension to consider administration at 23 weeks is based on limited data from 
observational studies and consensus
Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of antenatal corticosteroids have 
shown no difference in mortality in the subgroup analysis of infants delivered at 
24-30 weeks’ gestation
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
This study highlights for the first time that infants at the lowest gestations seem to 
benefit the most from exposure to antenatal corticosteroids
Exposure to antenatal corticosteroids was associated with a comparably lower 
mortality at 23 weeks’ gestation than at 24 weeks

infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units of the 
Pediatrix Medical Group. The Pediatrix Medical Group 
includes a range of both large and small neonatal inten-
sive care units, academic and non-academic centers, 
and several children’s hospital centers in the US. This 
database has been previously well described and has 
been used to answer major research questions and for 
large collaborative quality improvement initiatives.11-13 
We included infants from 23 0/7 to 34 6/7 weeks’ gesta-
tion born between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 
2013. We prioritized best obstetric estimate of gesta-
tional age based on the mother’s last menstrual period 
and fetal ultrasonography over best neonatal estimates 
as determined on the basis of physical examination cri-
teria, including the Ballard or Dubowitz examination. 
We excluded infants who were not delivered at one of 
the study hospitals, infants with major anomalies, and 
those who were transferred to another hospital, to 
ensure that all outcome data for infants in this study 
were complete. We did not impute missing data.
Definitions
We considered infants whose mothers had received one 
or more doses of either betamethasone or dexametha-
sone to be exposed to any antenatal corticosteroids.14 
 
Data on partial or complete courses and data on repeat 
courses of antenatal corticosteroids were not col-
lected.15  We abstracted all outcomes prospectively from 
medical records by using standardized definitions. Data 
were collected until death or discharge, whichever 
occurred first. We defined severe intracranial hemor-
rhage (grade 3-4) by using Papile’s grading system and 
medical or surgical necrotizing enterocolitis (stage ≥2) 
by using the modified Bell’s criteria. Infants diagnosed 
as having suspected necrotizing enterocolitis (stage 1) 
were not included. We defined severe retinopathy of 
prematurity (stage ≥3 or treated with ablation/antivas-
cular endothelial growth factor) by using the Interna-
tional Classification of Retinopathy of Prematurity and 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia by using the traditional 
definition of treatment with supplemental oxygen or 
respiratory support at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age.16 
We classified infants with one of more of the above con-
ditions as having major hospital morbidity.
Outcome measures
Many of the major outcomes in neonatology compete 
with death and can be assessed only in infants who sur-
vive the initial hospital course. Therefore, we reported 
these outcome measures with death as a competing 
composite outcome as well as independently of death 
as a non-composite outcome.
statistical analysis
We explored the association between antenatal cortico-
steroids and outcomes separately within each gesta-
tional age group. The primary outcome measure was 
death before discharge from hospital. All secondary 
outcome measures were pre-specified and included 
both composite outcomes combined with death and 
non-composite outcomes. We used Fisher’s exact test to 
describe differences in categorical variables. We used 
analysis of variance for normally distributed continu-
ous variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous 
skewed variables. We did logistic regression analyses 
adjusted for factors present at birth previously associ-
ated with differences in mortality, including birth 
weight, sex, mode of delivery, and multiple births.17-19 
We calculated the number needed to treat to prevent 
one death by using the standard method of unadjusted 
absolute risk reduction at each gestational age.
We also did forward stepwise logistic regressions for 
other factors present at birth associated with neonatal 
outcomes, including race/ethnicity, small for gesta-
tional age birth (<10th centile), maternal age, diabetes, 
pre-eclampsia, hypertension, prenatal care, rupture of 
membranes more than 24 hours before birth, and pla-
cental abruption. We defined a probability significance 
level to enter the model as 0.15 and a probability signif-
icance level to leave the model as 0.1. Within each ges-
tational age, the factors listed above that were retained 
were different but the adjusted odds ratio was not 
changed significantly, so none of these factors was 
retained in the final model. We used SAS software ver-
sion 9.2 for all statistical analyses. We estimated odds 
ratios and 95% confidence intervals for binary out-
comes, with a two sided P value of less than 0.05 indi-
cating statistical significance.
Patient involvement
Patients/parents and advocacy groups were not 
involved in the development of the study hypothesis, 
recruitment, outcome measures, study design, or 
implementation. Patients/parents and advocacy groups 
were not involved in the interpretation of the results or 
in the preparation of the manuscript, and there are no 
plans to disseminate the results of the research directly 
to study participants, advocacy groups, or parent 
groups.
Results
We included 117 941 infants, of whom 81 832 (69.4%) 
were exposed to antenatal corticosteroids (table 1 ). 
Rates of exposure to antenatal corticosteroids were 
lower among infants at the higher and the lower ends of 
the recommended gestational age range (fig 1 ). Mothers 
of infants who were exposed to antenatal corticoste-
roids were more likely to be white, to be delivered by 
cesarean section, and to have had prenatal care, rup-
ture of membranes more than 24 hours before birth, 
pre-eclampsia, and hypertension. Infants who were 
exposed to antenatal corticosteroids were more likely to 
be small for gestational age and the product of multiple 
births (table 1).
Among infants exposed to antenatal corticosteroids, 
the mortality rate was lower than among those without 
exposure at each gestational age from 23 to 29 weeks 
and at 31, 33, and 34 weeks, an association that per-
sisted after adjustment for covariates (table 2 ). The 
unadjusted number needed to treat to prevent one 
infant death increased exponentially with increasing 
gestational age, rising from six infants at 23 and 
 on 2 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

24 weeks’ gestation to 798 infants at 34 weeks’ gestation 
(fig 2). The adjusted odds ratios calculated using gesta-
tional age specific forward stepwise regression models 
did not differ in a meaningful way from the results of 
the gestational age specific models calculated using 
previously identified risk factors for mortality, and they 
are therefore not presented.
Exposure to antenatal corticosteroids was associated 
with lower rates of the composite outcome of death with 
other common morbidities of prematurity. Infants 
exposed to antenatal corticosteroids had a lower rate of 
severe intracranial hemorrhage or death compared with 
infants without exposure at each gestational age from 23 
to 31 weeks (table 2). Infants exposed to antenatal corti-
costeroids had a lower rate of stage 2 or above necrotiz-
ing enterocolitis or death compared with infants without 
exposure at each gestational age from 23 to 30 weeks. 
Infants exposed to antenatal corticosteroids also had a 
lower rate of severe retinopathy of prematurity or death 
than did infants without exposure at each gestational 
age from 23 to 29 weeks. The rate of bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia or death was lower in infants exposed to ante-
natal corticosteroids than in infants without exposure 
only among infants at 23 and 24 weeks’  
gestation.
We also did similar analyses of non-composite sec-
ondary outcomes (table 3 ). Infants exposed to antena-
tal corticosteroids had a lower rate of severe intracranial 
hemorrhage compared with infants without exposure at 
each gestational age from 23 to 30 weeks. Rates of stage 
2 or above necrotizing enterocolitis and severe retinop-
athy of prematurity were higher in infants exposed to 
antenatal corticosteroids than in infants without expo-
sure at 23 weeks’ gestation and did not differ among 
infants at other gestations. Rates of bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia were higher among infants exposed to ante-
natal corticosteroids compared with infants without 
exposure at 23 and 24 weeks’ gestation and did not dif-
fer among infants at other gestations. Rates of survival 
without major hospital morbidity were higher among 
infants exposed to antenatal corticosteroids compared 
with those without exposure at 23, 24, 26, and 27 weeks’ 
gestation and did not differ among infants at other ges-
tations. Infants exposed to antenatal corticosteroids 
had a lower rate of mechanical ventilation on day 0, 1, 
and/or 2 after birth compared with infants who were not 
exposed at each gestational age from 25 to 34 weeks’ 
gestation and did not differ among infants at other ges-
tations (table 3).
discussion
This large multicenter prospective cohort study illus-
trates that exposure to antenatal corticosteroids is asso-
ciated with lower mortality in infants at most gestational 
ages from 23 to 34 weeks, even after adjustment for mul-
tiple significant confounders. Importantly, this study 
reports for the first time that the number needed to treat 
associated with a lower mortality increases exponen-
tially at the higher gestational ages above 24 weeks. 
Although the adjusted odds ratios were similar at differ-
ent gestational ages, the number needed to treat 
decreased among infants at the lowest gestations as the 
absolute risk reductions were larger among infants at 
lower gestations. We also found that exposure to antena-
tal corticosteroids was associated with lower rates of 
important composite outcomes including severe intra-
cranial hemorrhage or death, stage 2 or above necrotiz-
ing enterocolitis or death, and severe retinopathy of 
prematurity or death at most gestations. We noted that 
survival without major hospital morbidities was higher 
among infants at the lowest gestational ages who were 
exposed to antenatal corticosteroids. Thus, the benefits 
of antenatal corticosteroids seem to be larger in infants 
born at lower gestations for which data are most limited.
strengths and limitations of study
Although the data used in this study are not population 
based, this is the largest observational study on 
 
antenatal corticosteroid exposure to date and the only 
one that assessed exposure at all gestational ages at

which antenatal corticosteroids are recommended. A 
large proportion of infants at 23 weeks’ gestation did 
not receive antenatal corticosteroids compared with 
most other gestational age groups, and this study may 
provide a good mimic of the experimental situation at 
this gestational age in particular. In addition, the large 
sample size in this study would have improved the pre-
cision of the estimated effect size. Data came from both 
academic and non-academic, as well as large and 
small, neonatal intensive care units across the US, but 
some limitations should be noted. An inception cohort 
of fetuses who were either exposed or not exposed to 
antenatal corticosteroids was not available. The timing 
of antenatal corticosteroid administration in relation to 
gestational age at administration, time from adminis-
tration to delivery, and whether the course of antenatal 
corticosteroids was partial, complete, or repeated were 
not available. However, inclusion of infants who 
received antenatal corticosteroids outside the optimal 
window for administration,20  from more than 24 hours 
to seven days, would be expected to skew the results 
toward the null. Inclusion of infants who received 
repeated doses of corticosteroids would not be expected 
to change the rate of hospital mortality or any of the 
individual major hospital morbidities included in the 
study significantly compared with a single dose.14 
21
Furthermore, data were not collected on whether 
fetal monitoring was undertaken or the length of mater-
nal hospital admission before delivery.22 
23  The indica-
tion for preterm delivery was not available and may 
differ between groups. Women admitted in advanced 
labor most likely would be over-represented in the 
group that did not receive antenatal corticosteroids, 
and adjustment for this potential bias was not possible. 
The results of this study are unlikely to be due only to 
confounding, but some residual unmeasured bias in 
the results due to baseline differences may exist 
between the study groups that was not accounted for in 
the regression models. Multiple testing was used in this 
study with a 5% significance level, and this may have 
resulted in a few results being significant purely by 
chance, although this is unlikely as the benefits seemed 
to be consistent across different gestations. In addition, 
there is a possibility of postnatal bias in which infants

Comparison with other studies
This study shows a survival benefit associated with 
exposure to antenatal corticosteroids at most gesta-
tional ages from 23 to 34 weeks. In the Cochrane review 
of randomized controlled trials of administration of 
antenatal corticosteroids, subgroup analysis of infants 
delivered at less than 30 weeks’ gestation showed that 
rates of neonatal death were not significantly decreased 
by the intervention (relative risk 0.82, 95% confidence 
interval 0.60 to 1.11; one study, 150 infants).1 When 
examined by gestational age at trial entry rather than 
gestational age at birth, the mortality rate was lower 
among infants from 26 weeks and later in this 
meta-analysis. Only 49 extremely preterm infants less 
than 26 weeks’ gestation were included in that 
meta-analysis, and no infants less than 24 weeks’ gesta-
tion were included. The benefits among infants at 
higher gestations in our study were less consistent than 
the benefits described in the meta-analysis, possibly 
because these infants have low rates of major adverse 
outcomes in the current era. We did not consider the 
effect of antenatal corticosteroid administration among 
infants beyond 34 weeks’ gestation in our study, which 
focused on death and major hospital morbidities.
This study supports and extends the results of the aca-
demic center based NICHD Neonatal Research Network 
study of 10 541 infants delivered between 22 and 25 
weeks’ gestation, which found that infants exposed to 
antenatal corticosteroids had a lower rate of death, a 
lower rate of death or severe intracranial hemorrhage/
periventricular leukomalacia, and a lower rate of death 
or necrotizing enterocolitis at each gestation from 23 to 
25 weeks.7  Our study adds to the results from an obser-
vational study of 11 607 infants from 22 to 33 weeks’ ges-
tation that found a lower mortality rate among infants 
exposed to antenatal corticosteroids only at 22-27 weeks’ 
gestation; this was in part a result of the smaller sample 
size at each gestational age in that study, as the adjusted 
hazard ratios were substantially less than 1.0 at most 
gestational ages.8  Our study is consistent with and 
extends the results from a cohort study that included 
13 406 infants born between 23 and 32 weeks’ gestation, 
which showed a lower mortality only in infants born 
between 24 and 29 weeks gestation exposed to antenatal 
corticosteroids compared with unexposed infants, but 
again the sample size was smaller.9
In the Cochrane review of randomized controlled tri-
als of administration of antenatal corticosteroids, the 
subgroup analysis of infants less than 28 weeks’ gesta-
tion showed a significant reduction in the rates of intra-
cranial hemorrhage (relative risk 0.34, 0.14 to 0.86; one 
study, 62 infants).1 A further randomized controlled 
trial also found a lower rate of severe intracranial hem-
orrhage in infants less than 28 weeks’ gestation exposed 
to antenatal corticosteroids compared with unexposed 
infants (1/33 v 9/38; P=0.01).27  In our study, infants 
exposed to antenatal corticosteroids similarly had a 
lower rate of severe intracranial hemorrhage.

The Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials 
did not do subgroup analyses by gestational age for 
necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, or 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia.1
Our study showed that antenatal corticosteroids were 
associated with lower rates of death and important 
composite outcomes among infants at most gestational 
ages, including all gestations less than 30 weeks. This 
finding was primarily due to a lower rate of death in 
infants exposed to antenatal corticosteroids, which was 
only partially offset by a higher rate of non-composite 
outcomes for necrotizing enterocolitis, severe retinopa-
thy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
among infants at the lowest gestations. These 
 
differences are likely explained by competing outcomes 
whereby the rate of death was higher in infants without 
exposure to antenatal corticosteroids who did not sur-
vive long enough to either develop or be diagnosed as 
having the morbidity. The higher rate of death in infants 
without antenatal corticosteroids exposure may also 
explain much of the differences in reported outcomes in 
other observational studies of antenatal corticosteroids 
to date. The higher rate of survival without major hospi-
tal morbidities among infants at the lowest gestations 
exposed to antenatal corticosteroids compared with 
those without exposure in our study is an important 
observation that may be due to the clustering of more 
than one morbidity in the same infant.28
Studies on the effect of antenatal corticosteroids on 
the rates of bronchopulmonary dysplasia have had con-
flicting results. The traditional definition of broncho-
pulmonary dysplasia used in this study probably 
overestimates the incidence of bronchopulmonary dys-
plasia compared with the physiologic definition used in 
studies by the NICHD Neonatal Research Network.7 29 
 
The aforementioned NICHD Neonatal Research Net-
work study found that infants exposed to antenatal cor-
ticosteroids had a lower rate of death or 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia only at 23 weeks’ gesta-
tion. Two other observational studies of antenatal corti-
costeroid exposure found that infants exposed to 
antenatal corticosteroids did not have a lower rate of 
traditional bronchopulmonary dysplasia by gestational 
age, but these two studies did not control for mortality 
in their analyses of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.8 9 
Infants can be diagnosed as having bronchopulmonary 
dysplasia only if they survive to 36 weeks’ postmen-
strual age, and the higher survival rate in this study 
among infants at the lowest gestations exposed to ante-
natal corticosteroids may have resulted in more infants 
being diagnosed as having bronchopulmonary  
dysplasia.
This study differs from the study by the Neonatal 
Research Network of Japan, in which results were 
reported for two week periods rather than single weeks’ of 
gestation.8  That study found no difference in the rate of 
necrotizing enterocolitis in any gestational age group and 
found no difference in rates of intracranial hemorrhage in 
infants from 22 to 23 weeks’ gestation. Our study also dif-
fers from the study by the Neonatal Intensive Care Units, 
which found a higher rate of bronchopulmonary dyspla-
sia in infants delivered at 24 and 26 weeks’ gestation and 
a higher rate of intracranial hemorrhage in infants at 23 
weeks’ gestation exposed to a complete course of antena-
tal corticosteroids.10  The results of the gestational age 
subgroup analysis in that study may have been affected 
by the inclusion of infants with partial exposure to ante-
natal corticosteroids and infants without exposure to 
antenatal corticosteroids in the same group.1
The Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials 
of administration of antenatal corticosteroids found a 
decreased rate of respiratory distress syndrome in 
infants born before 34 weeks’ gestation (relative risk 
0.58, 0.47 to 0.72; five studies, 1177 infants) but not 
before 28 weeks’ gestation (0.79, 0.53 to 1.18; four stud-
ies, 102 infants).1  Our study analyzed data on whether 
infants were ventilated on day 0, 1, and/or 2 as a surro-
gate marker for severe respiratory distress syndrome, as 
infants with less severe respiratory distress syndrome 
may be more likely to be managed with less invasive 
respiratory support.30 
31  The lower rate of early mechan-
ical ventilation at each gestational age from 25 to 34 
weeks indicates amelioration of the severity of respira-
tory distress syndrome in these infants. Decisions to 
provide or withhold active treatment may affect out-
comes particularly among infants at the lowest gesta-
tions from 23 to 24 weeks.25 However, our data indicate 
that no difference existed in the number of infants at 
the lowest gestations that died without delivery room 
resuscitation after birth, as there was no difference in 
the rate of mechanical ventilation on day 0, 1, or 2 
among infants at 23 and 24 weeks’ gestation.
This study supports and extends the findings of a 
recent systematic review and meta-analysis of previ-
ously published data from observational studies of 
antenatal corticosteroid use, which found a lower rate 
of mortality among infants at 23 weeks’ gestation who 
received active treatment.32 However, our study adds 
the seminal finding that the number needed to treat 
with antenatal corticosteroids to prevent one death 
before discharge increased from six at 23 and 24 weeks’ 
gestation to 798 at 34 weeks’ gestation.
Conclusion and policy implications
The effect on mortality and survival without major mor-
bidities of exposure to antenatal corticosteroids seems 
to be largest in infants at the lowest gestations, includ-
ing infants at 23 weeks’ gestation who were not included 
in randomized controlled trials. The study also found 
that antenatal exposure to corticosteroids was associ-
ated with lower rates of mortality and major hospital 
morbidities at most gestations for which steroids are 
currently recommended. This study supports the admin-
istration of antenatal corticosteroids in women with 
threatened preterm labor from 23 to 34 weeks’ gestation.
