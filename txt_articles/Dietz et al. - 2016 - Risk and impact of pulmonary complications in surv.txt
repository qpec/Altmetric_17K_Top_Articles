Abstract
Background—Pulmonary complications after cancer therapy are varied. We describe pulmonary 
outcomes among childhood cancer survivors and evaluate their impact on daily activities.
Methods—The incidence of pulmonary outcomes (asthma, chronic cough, emphysema, lung 
fibrosis, oxygen need, recurrent pneumonia) reported among 5-year cancer survivors (n=14,316) 
and death from pulmonary causes among all eligible survivors (n=20,690) in the Childhood 
Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) were compared to sibling controls (n=4,027) using cumulative 
incidence, standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and piecewise exponential models. Logistic 
regression with random effects was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) of activity limitations with pulmonary complications.

 Results—By age 45 years the cumulative incidence of any pulmonary condition was 29.6% (CI 
29.1–30.0) among cancer survivors and 26.5% (CI 24.9–28.0) for siblings. Fewer survivors 
reported ever smoking (23.6 vs. 36.4%, p<0.001), but survivors were more likely to report chronic 
cough (rate ratio [RR] 1.6 CI 1.4–1.9), oxygen need (RR 1.8 CI 1.5–2.2), lung fibrosis (RR 3.5 CI 
2.3–5.4), and recurrent pneumonia (RR 2.0 CI 1.4–3.0). The SMR for death from pulmonary 
causes was 5.9 (CI 4.2–8.1) and associated with platinum exposure and lung radiation (p<0.01). 
Impact of chronic cough on daily activities for survivors (OR 2.7 relative to survivors without 
chronic cough) was greater than for siblings (OR 2.0, p=0.04).
Conclusion—Pulmonary complications are substantial among adult survivors of childhood 
cancer and can impact daily activities.

Introduction
Cooperative group trials, multi-modal and risk-based therapies, and pharmacologic advances 
have contributed to consistent survival improvements for children diagnosed with a 
malignancy. Overall 5-year survival rates now exceed 80%, and it is estimated there are 
more than 420,000 survivors of childhood cancer alive in the United States.1 With these 
improvements, research efforts have increasingly focused on late sequelae of cancer therapy 
in an effort to better characterize and understand risks to long-term health and need for 
appropriate screening and counseling.
Despite improved survival rates, late mortality for childhood cancer survivors exceeds the 
expected rate estimated from the age-, sex-matched United States population.2 Leading 
causes of death are subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN) (standardized mortality ratio 
[SMR] 15.2) followed by pulmonary (SMR 8.8), and cardiovascular (SMR 7.0) events. Late 
pulmonary toxicity following chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy has been reported by 
many investigators and appears highest among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, 
rhabdomyosarcoma, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).3–6 Perhaps more 
important is the continued increase in adverse pulmonary outcomes with time. Cumulative 
incidence for lung fibrosis, chronic cough, and exercise-induced dyspnea continues to 
increase up to 25 years from diagnosis among survivors treated with chemotherapy or 
radiation,7 while the combination is associated with the highest risk.8, 9 Lack of any plateau 
suggests the need for follow-up with advancing age and time from diagnosis.
Understanding specific long-term risks to pulmonary health for survivors of childhood 
cancer will help refine guidelines for appropriate screening and surveillance, promote health 
counseling, and, hopefully, contribute to design and testing of targeted interventions to 
decrease pulmonary morbidity and mortality for future cancer survivors. This study seeks to

 expand upon our understanding of the occurrence of and risk factors for adverse pulmonary 
outcomes among aging survivors of childhood cancer, as well as assess associations with 
daily physical activity.
Methods
Population
The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), a multi-institutional retrospective cohort 
study, has longitudinal follow-up of individuals who survived at least 5 years after diagnosis 
of leukemia, central nervous system (CNS) malignancy, Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma, kidney tumor, neuroblastoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, or bone tumors, diagnosed 
before age 21 years at one of 26 collaborating institutions between January 1, 1970 and 
December 31, 1986. Participants completed a baseline survey between 1994–98 that 
included demographic information and medical, family, and social histories. A surrogate 
(parent, spouse, or next of kin) completed the baseline survey for survivors who died more 
than 5 years after diagnosis, were under age 18 years, or unable to complete the survey. 
Questions concerning pulmonary conditions were asked on the baseline and two subsequent 
follow-up surveys, follow-up 2 (FU2) and follow-up 4 (FU4) (conducted in 2000 and 2007, 
respectively), but not on follow-up 1 or follow-up 3. Participants must have completed at 
least one relevant survey to be included in this analysis. Treatment data were abstracted from 
medical records for survivors who authorized release. The dose for lung radiation was an 
average absorbed dose calculated to 400 points in each lung.10 The dose used for analysis 
was the greater of the right or the left lung. The CCSS study has been previously 
described,11 approved by the human subjects review committees at each institution, and all 
participants and/or guardians provided informed consent. Surveys can be viewed at http://
ccss.stjude.org.
We identified 20,690 five-year cancer survivors, of whom 14,359 (69%) completed baseline, 
FU2, and/or FU 4 questionnaires. Survivors reporting a second cancer prior to cohort entry 
(n=43) were excluded, leaving 14,316 in this analysis (Supplemental Figure 1). A random 
sample of survivors were asked to nominate their nearest aged sibling for participation in a 
comparison group, resulting in 4,027 siblings who completed baseline, FU2, and/or FU4 
questionnaires.
Pulmonary Outcomes
Participants completed multi-item questionnaires, which included earliest onset age of a 
pulmonary health condition: asthma, chronic cough, emphysema, lung fibrosis, oxygen 
need, and recurrent pneumonia (3 or more episodes in the past 2 years). Second malignant 
neoplasms (SMN) were confirmed by central review of pathology reports. Congestive heart 
failure (CHF) was assessed in surveys and graded per Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (version 4.03) with grades 3–4 considered positive for CHF.12 All patients 
eligible for participation (n=20,690) were included in a search for matching death records 
using the National Death Index through 2007. Underlying and multiple causes of death for 
deceased subjects, using the International Classification of Disease – 9th and 10th Revisions,

 were provided and pulmonary deaths as the underlying cause (ICD 9: 460–519, ICD 10: 
J00-J99) identified.
Physical activity limitations were scored as previously described13 from baseline and FU4 
surveys. A series of six questions asked about how long current health status limited 
performance of particular activities during the past 2 years. Activities included vigorous 
ones such as lifting heavy objects or running, moderate activities such as carrying groceries 
or climbing a few flights of stairs, and light activities such as stooping, walking 1 block, or 
bathing. Scores were assigned based on duration of limitation, creating a continuous 
variable. Subjects were classified as having physical activity limitations if their scores were 
at or below the 10th percentile of the sibling group’s overall score.
Statistical Analysis
Characteristics of survivors and siblings were tabulated and compared between them through 
bootstrapping of families to account for potential within-family correlation.14 The SMR was 
calculated using age-, sex-, and calendar year-specific U.S. mortality rates among all eligible 
survivors (n=20,690). Cumulative incidence of pulmonary conditions were calculated for 
survivors and siblings with SMN, late recurrence, HSCT, or death for survivors and death for 
siblings as competing risk events. Multivariable piecewise exponential models were used to 
compare incidence rates of each pulmonary outcome between survivors and siblings, 
adjusting for sex, race, and time-dependent variables of attained age, smoking status, body 
mass index (BMI), and incidence of CHF. Survivors were considered to be at risk for 
developing each pulmonary condition starting from CCSS cohort entry (i.e. 5 years after 
cancer diagnosis); the siblings’ at-risk period started on the date when his/her index case 
(survivor) became a five-year survivor. The at-risk period ended at the earliest of: developing 
the pulmonary condition of interest, SMN, late recurrence, receiving HSCT, death, or 
completion date of the last questionnaire. Modification of models by Generalized Estimating 
Equation (GEE) was used to account for potential correlation of developing each pulmonary 
condition of interest within family (between a survivor and his/her sibling).15 Absolute 
excess risk (AER) per 10,000 person years was calculated by subtracting siblings adjusted 
incidence rates from survivors adjusted incidence rates.
Associations between treatment exposures and pulmonary conditions were assessed by 
multivariable piecewise exponential regression analysis, adjusting for sex, race, cancer 
diagnosis, attained age, years since cancer diagnosis, smoking status, BMI, and incidence of 
CHF. A variable selection for treatment exposures was performed retaining variables with a 
p-value ≤ 0.2 on univariate analysis in final models.
Associations of having developed pulmonary conditions with physical activity limitations 
were evaluated longitudinally and compared between survivors and siblings. CNS tumor 
survivors were excluded from this analysis because of their previously described physical 
activity limitations.16 To compare differences between survivors and siblings, logistic 
regression analysis with random effects17 was performed, adjusting for sex, race, attained 
age, smoking, HSCT, amputation, paralysis, and CHF. Two sources of correlation across 
multiple physical limitation measures at different survey times were accounted for by two

 random effects: one for within-family correlation between a survivor and his/her sibling and 
the other for within-person across-survey repeated measurements.
A multiple imputation method18 was used for those who reported a condition without onset 
age. Multiple possible ages were imputed for each missing age for survivors and siblings 
separately, using all variables from the analyses above (Supplemental Table 1). Ten 
multiply-imputed datasets were generated. By applying the same analysis to each of these 
datasets, 10 sets of results were summarized by the standard method for multiple-
imputation-based inference.19
Results
Population
Characteristics of survivors and siblings are shown in Table 1. Median age at diagnosis was 
7 years (range: 0–21) and 32 years (6–59) at evaluation, with median time from diagnosis of 
25 years (5–39). Compared with siblings, survivors were more likely to be male, black, and 
Hispanic. Survivors were slightly younger and more likely to report a history of CHF, but 
less likely to be overweight/obese or have ever smoked at baseline survey.
Pulmonary Conditions
The frequency of pulmonary conditions, incidence rates, cumulative incidence, and AER are 
shown in Table 2. Incidence rates for survivors ranged from 0.2 for emphysema to 4.9 for 
chronic cough per 1,000 person-years. At age 45 years the cumulative incidence for 
reporting any pulmonary condition was 29.6% (95% CI 29.1%–30.0%) in survivors and 
26.5% (95% CI 24.9%–28.0%) in siblings (Figure 1a–g). Compared to siblings, AERs were 
elevated for chronic cough, oxygen need, lung fibrosis, and recurrent pneumonia among 
survivors.
Compared to siblings, survivors had higher rate ratios (RR) for developing new onset 
chronic cough (RR 1.6 95% CI 1.4–1.9), oxygen need (RR 1.8 95% CI 1.5–2.2), lung 
fibrosis (RR 3.5 95% CI 2.3–5.4), and recurrent pneumonia (RR 2.0 95% CI 1.4–3.0) (Table 
2). Rate ratios for chronic cough, oxygen need, and lung fibrosis remained elevated up to 25 
years post diagnosis but declined for recurrent pneumonia with longer follow-up 
(Supplemental Table 2).
Exposures Associated with Pulmonary Outcomes
Associations between treatment exposures and adverse pulmonary outcomes are shown in 
Table 3. The risk of asthma was increased among survivors exposed to asparaginase. 
Chronic cough was significantly associated with chest wall or lung surgery, anthracyclines, 
hydroxyurea, and lung radiation ≥15 Gy. Emphysema was associated with lomustine 
(CCNU). HSCT, chest wall or lung surgery, and lung radiation ≥10 Gy were associated with 
oxygen need. Lung fibrosis was associated with previous chest wall or lung surgery, 
asparaginase, platinum-based agents, and lung radiation ≥10 Gy. The risk of recurrent 
pneumonia was increased by lung radiation ≥15 Gy. No significant interactions were 
identified between chemotherapy and radiation exposures.

 Limitations in Daily Activities
Table 4 shows the effect of each pulmonary condition on daily activities for survivors and 
siblings. Survivors with each pulmonary condition were more likely to have activity 
limitations than survivors without these conditions. With the exception of recurrent 
pneumonia, siblings also reported activity limitations across all pulmonary conditions 
compared to those siblings without these conditions. However, the frequency of limitations 
was higher among survivors with chronic cough compared to siblings with chronic cough 
(p=0.04). While not statistically significant, the frequency also tended to be higher for 
survivors needing oxygen (p=0.09) and those with recurrent pneumonia (p=0.08), compared 
to siblings with these conditions.
Pulmonary Mortality
Cumulative incidence of death due to a pulmonary cause rises steadily with increasing time 
from diagnosis, exceeding 0.5% by 35 years after diagnosis (Figure 2). There were 138 
reported pulmonary deaths (SMR 5.9, 95% CI 4.2–8.1). Significant associations were 
identified with exposure to platinum-based agents (RR 6.9 95% CI 1.8–27.3), and higher 
lung radiation doses (RR 4.4 95% CI 1.0–18.5, for ≥10 to <15; RR 7.7 95% CI 2.0–29.1, for 
≥15 to <20 Gy; RR 5.2 95% CI 1.2–22.3, for ≥20 to <25 Gy; RR 15.7 95% CI 3.7–65.5, for 
≥25 Gy; ptrend<0.01).
Discussion
Late complications of cancer therapy affecting the pulmonary system are heterogeneous and 
range from self-limited events to more severe conditions impacting daily activity, 
contributing to late morbidity, and increasing the risk of death. Following the largest cohort 
of adult survivors of childhood cancer for a median of 25 years, we identified a variety of 
pulmonary outcomes. The rate of chronic cough, oxygen need, lung fibrosis, and recurrent 
pneumonia remained elevated many years from diagnosis. Additionally, we investigated the 
impact these complications have upon activities of daily living. Survivors with chronic 
cough, and potentially oxygen need and recurrent pneumonia, were more likely to report 
activity limitations than siblings with these same conditions.
Some respiratory outcomes such as asthma are particularly common, and, therefore, highly 
prevalent among survivors and siblings. These findings are consistent with the initial report 
of pulmonary outcomes in the CCSS cohort.7 However, using data from across three 
surveys, we found the rate of newly diagnosed chronic cough, oxygen need, lung fibrosis, 
and recurrent pneumonia continued to occur many years following diagnosis. Chronic 
cough, one of the most common respiratory complaints in the general population, accounts 
for 38% of outpatient pulmonary clinic visits, and can lead to feelings of self-consciousness, 
social isolation, musculoskeletal pain, and chronic hoarseness.20 Lung fibrosis can range 
from an asymptomatic finding to a progressive, irreversible, fatal process, with median 
survival of 2–5 years following diagnosis.21 Recurrent pneumonia, one of the most common 
reasons for physician visits and hospitalizations, occurs in 9–12% of the general population 
and has been associated with 4–10% mortality.22 Impaired functional status and 
immunosuppression have been significantly associated with recurrent pneumonia,

 particularly among aging adults. However, many of these same co-morbidities have also 
been identified among younger adult survivors of childhood cancer and the contribution to 
adverse pulmonary outcomes has yet to be fully investigated.16, 23
Pulmonary tissue is particularly sensitive to cancer treatment both acutely and long-term. 
Radiation and chemotherapy-induced pneumonitis can progress to lung fibrosis, while 
thoracic surgery can leave long-term anatomical abnormalities effecting respiratory 
physiology.8, 9 Our study confirms many of these associations, however, associations with 
chemotherapy appeared less prominent. On multivariable analysis, many of the classic 
alkylating agents, such as bleomycin, busulfan, and BCNU, showed no association with the 
pulmonary outcomes studied. This is not unlike recent studies that performed pulmonary 
function testing on childhood cancer survivors. Among 220 survivors treated with 
bleomycin, pulmonary radiation, or pulmonary surgery, Mulder et al. identified restrictive 
lung disease in those treated with radiation only (OR 6.99 95% CI 2.27–21.54), bleomycin 
and radiation (OR 9.41 95% CI 1.71–51.86), and radiation with surgery (OR 33.44 95% CI 
7.81–143.09) compared to those treated with bleomycin only.8 Similarly, Armenian and 
colleagues in a series of 155 survivors found restrictive physiology associated with chest 
radiation >20 Gy (OR 5.6, 95% CI 1.5–21.0) but no significant associations with 
chemotherapy exposures.24 Lung radiation and surgery appear to have the most significant 
impact upon the lung.
A number of unique associations with chemotherapy were identified. A newer finding was 
the association of asparaginase with asthma and lung fibrosis. Hypersensitivity reactions to 
asparaginase are common, usually acute, IgE mediated, and range from localized irritation to 
severe anaphylaxis.25 Potentially immune-mediated pulmonary injury may occur following 
exposure initiating a chronic inflammatory state. Platinum agents were also associated with 
lung fibrosis. While a mechanism is not immediately clear, this association was also 
identified by Mertens et al.7 Inhaled heavy metals are known to be pulmonary toxic and, 
interestingly, these agents are associated with hypersensitivity reactions. A chance finding 
cannot be ruled out, but the persistence of this association raises important questions for 
future investigation. Anthracyclines and hydroxyurea were associated with chronic cough, 
independent of CHF. Rare cases of hydroxyurea-induced pneumonitis have been reported26, 
but these associations, also, need further investigation.
Studies examining activity among childhood cancer survivors have largely focused on 
physical exercise and less on accomplishing routine daily tasks.27 Ness and colleagues were 
among the first to report limitations in daily function in childhood cancer survivors (19.6% 
of the CCSS cohort, RR 1.8 95% CI 1.7–2.0).13 Our analysis is the first time associations 
have been made between specific adverse pulmonary outcomes and daily function. 
Pulmonary conditions were associated with reporting activity limitations for both cancer 
survivors and siblings. However, the impact of chronic cough was more significant among 
childhood cancer survivors than siblings, suggesting a greater influence and limitation on 
daily function among cancer survivors.
Using the CCSS cohort, we were able to assess a large population of childhood cancer 
survivors followed for late pulmonary outcomes. While the size of the cohort permits

 investigation into an array of exposures not possible in smaller, single disease studies, the 
results should be interpreted within the limitations of the study design. Outcomes are self-
reported and not formally validated. Validation of outcomes in the CCSS has been 
attempted, and while some are easier (e.g. birth of a child) than others, confirmation is 
challenging in the current health care environment.28 Respiratory conditions, such as lung 
fibrosis or emphysema, can be particularly complex requiring specialized providers and a 
variey of diagnostic studies. Lacking verification, we chose to retain what individual 
survivors directly reported. While informative, caution is advised when interpreting the 
results and applying them to particular clinical scenarios. Another limitation is overlap 
among outcomes, such as chronic cough or oxygen need in patients with emphysema and/or 
lung fibrosis. Future prospective studies that follow self-reported pulmonary events, measure 
changes in lung function, and examine potential biomarkers could aid in earlier detection of 
these outcomes.
Survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk for late pulmonary-related complications 
and mortality with increasing incidence over time. Often considered asymptomatic, late 
pulmonary toxicity may limit activities of daily living with potential impact on overall 
quality of life.
