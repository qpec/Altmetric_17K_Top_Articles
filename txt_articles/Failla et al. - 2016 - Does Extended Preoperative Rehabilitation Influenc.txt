Abstract
Background—Rehabilitation before anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) is 
effective at improving postoperative outcomes at least in the short term. Less is known about the 
effects of preoperative rehabilitation on functional outcomes and return-to-sport (RTS) rates 2 
years after reconstruction.
Purpose/Hypothesis—The purpose of this study was to compare functional outcomes 2 years 
after ACLR in a cohort that underwent additional preoperative rehabilitation, including progressive

 strengthening and neuromuscular training after impairments were resolved, compared with a 
nonexperimental cohort. We hypothesized that the cohort treated with extended preoperative 
rehabilitation would have superior functional outcomes 2 years after ACLR.
Study Design—Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
Methods—This study compared outcomes after an ACL rupture in an international cohort 
(Delaware-Oslo ACL Cohort [DOC]) treated with extended preoperative rehabilitation, including 
neuromuscular training, to data from the Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) 
cohort, which did not undergo extended preoperative rehabilitation. Inclusion and exclusion 
criteria from the DOC were applied to the MOON database to extract a homogeneous sample for 
comparison. Patients achieved knee impairment resolution before ACLR, and postoperative 
rehabilitation followed each cohort's respective criterion-based protocol. Patients completed the 
International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee form and Knee injury and 
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at enrollment and again 2 years after ACLR. RTS rates 
were calculated for each cohort at 2 years.
Results—After adjusting for baseline IKDC and KOOS scores, the DOC patients showed 
significant and clinically meaningful differences in IKDC and KOOS scores 2 years after ACLR. 
There was a significantly higher (P < .001) percentage of DOC patients returning to preinjury 
sports (72%) compared with those in the MOON cohort (63%).
Conclusion—The cohort treated with additional preoperative rehabilitation consisting of 
progressive strengthening and neuromuscular training, followed by a criterion-based postoperative 
rehabilitation program, had greater functional outcomes and RTS rates 2 years after ACLR. 
Preoperative rehabilitation should be considered as an addition to the standard of care to maximize 
functional outcomes after ACLR.

Early anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) remains the gold standard of 
treatment for active patients with ACL ruptures in the United States,20,22 with up to 175,000 
reconstructions being performed annually.28 The goals for ACLR include restoring primary 
passive restraint, returning to preinjury activities and previous levels of function, and 
preserving long-term knee joint health.20,22 Reconstruction, however, does not guarantee a 
return to previous activities or functional levels or the prevention of posttraumatic knee 
osteoarthritis.10,11,20
Large, multicenter orthopaedic registries have been developed and implemented to track 
outcomes after ACLR in the United States and abroad. The Multicenter Orthopaedic 
Outcomes Network (MOON) registry pools data together from 7 orthopaedic centers across 
the United States.27 These centers are all highly active in orthopaedic and sports clinical 
treatment and research, with unified pre-operative milestones to undergo ACLR and a single 
criterion-based postoperative protocol with objective return-to-sport (RTS) criteria.27,30 The 
MOON cohort can serve as the benchmark or usual care for comparative effectiveness 
studies to compare ACLR outcomes.27

 Rehabilitation before surgery, termed “preoperative rehabilitation” or “prehabilitation,” is 
physical preparation for a period of immobility and reduced activity due to surgery. Few 
studies have explored the effects of preoperative rehabilitation on outcomes after ACLR.13 
Shaarani and colleagues,25 in a randomized controlled trial, found that a 6-week 
preoperative rehabilitation program led to improved functional performance and self-
reported function up to 12 weeks after reconstruction. The addition of neuromuscular 
training to preoperative rehabilitation is another attempt to improve outcomes after an ACL 
injury.6,7,14,15 Specifically, perturbation training has been studied in conjunction with a 
preoperative rehabilitation program9 and is currently under investigation for its use after 
surgery.29 Grindem and colleagues12 compared functional outcome measures 2 years after 
ACLR in the Norwegian half of our cohort to usual care as benchmarked by the Norwegian 
Knee Ligament Registry (NKLR). There were statistically significant and clinically 
meaningfully better outcomes in the Delaware-Oslo ACL Cohort (DOC) as evidenced by 
higher Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) results. The limitation of this 
study, however, is that rehabilitation in the NKLR was not standardized. The question 
remains how progressive preoperative rehabilitation that includes neuromuscular training 
affects outcomes after ACLR when both cohorts receive otherwise similar care.
The purpose of this study was to assess functional outcomes 2 years after ACLR in a cohort 
that underwent additional preoperative rehabilitation, including progressive strengthening 
and neuromuscular training after impairments were resolved, compared with a 
nonexperimental reference group (MOON cohort). We hypothesized that the cohort treated 
with extended preoperative rehabilitation would have superior functional outcomes 2 years 
after ACLR. The implications of this research could lead to changes in the standard of care 
before undergoing reconstruction after an ACL injury.
Methods
This was a cohort study comparing outcomes in an international cohort (DOC) treated with 
extended preoperative rehabilitation, including neuromuscular training, with data from a 
nonexperimental cohort (MOON consortium). The outcomes of interest included 
preoperative and postoperative International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) 
subjective knee form2 scores as well as KOOS24 results and RTS rates. Eighty-four patients 
from the Norwegian arm of the DOC were previously included in the comparison to the 
NKLR by Grindem and colleagues12 described above.
Patients
The DOC is an ongoing, international prospective collaboration evaluating the effects of 
neuromuscular training after an ACL injury and reconstruction. This collaboration includes 
150 patients from the University of Delaware in the United States and 150 patients from the 
Norwegian Research Center for Active Rehabilitation, Norwegian School of Sport Sciences 
in Oslo, Norway. Patients were enrolled at both centers between 2007 and 2012. Patients 
were included if they had a unilateral primary ACL rupture within 7 months of enrollment 
and participated in level 1 or 2 sports (IKDC activity classification) for more than 50 hours 
per year before the injury.4 Patients were excluded if they had a concomitant grade 3

 ligamentous injury, a full-thickness articular cartilage lesion larger than 1 cm2, a 
symptomatic meniscal tear, a potentially repairable meniscal tear, or a previous injury or 
surgery of the uninvolved knee. All patients underwent initial impairment resolution (little to 
no swelling or pain, full range of motion [ROM], 70% quadriceps strength index), followed 
by progressive strengthening and neuromuscular training called perturbation training, as 
previously described by Eitzen and Moksnes.9 After completion of these additional training 
sessions, patients selected to undergo ACLR or remain nonoperatively managed. While all 
patients were followed, only those who underwent ACLR were included in this analysis. 
Those from the DOC who did not immediately undergo reconstruction after training 
continued on a home exercise program, if needed, for maintenance until reconstruction was 
performed (see Appendix 1, available online at http://ajsm.sagepub.com/supplemental). All 
patients after ACLR underwent a criterion-based postoperative rehabilitation protocol with 
strict RTS criteria.1 The University of Delaware Institutional Review Board and the Region 
Ethics Committee for South East Norway approved all aspects of this study, and written 
informed consent was obtained for all patients before enrollment.
The MOON cohort consists of patients enrolled between 2002 and 2008 from 7 orthopaedic/
sports medicine centers around the United States. Patients were included if they were 
scheduled to undergo unilateral ACLR and were between the ages of 10 and 85 years. 
Patients were enrolled at the time of presentation to the orthopaedic surgeon and were 
observed prospectively after surgery. This cohort was intended to be community based, with 
all ages, activity levels, injury history, and concomitant injuries included.27 All patients after 
ACLR underwent a criterion-based postoperative rehabilitation protocol with strict RTS 
criteria (see Appendix 2, available online).30 Institutional review board approval was 
obtained from all participating centers, and written informed consent was obtained for all 
patients before enrollment.
For this study, inclusion and exclusion criteria from the DOC were applied to the MOON 
cohort, and only those who met the criteria for the DOC described above were included. 
MOON data were extracted based on these criteria, and deidentified data were provided for 
analysis. Patients whose imaging revealed a potentially repairable meniscal injury were 
excluded from enrollment in the DOC. During reconstruction, however, 11% of the DOC 
patients underwent concomitant meniscal repair, despite initial presentation on imaging, and 
we therefore included those who underwent concomitant meniscal repair from the MOON 
dataset. Surgical variables recorded included graft type, concomitant meniscal procedures, 
and articular cartilage condition (Figure 1).
Criteria for Reconstruction
Both cohorts used guidelines to determine when athletes were ready to undergo ACLR. The 
recommendations for the DOC patients to undergo ACLR were little to no knee joint 
effusion, symmetrical knee ROM, no obvious gait impairments, and a minimum of 70% 
quadriceps strength index (“quiet knee”). The MOON preoperative guidelines included no 
obvious gait impairments, knee ROM from 0° to 120°, minimal knee joint effusion, and the 
ability to complete 20 straight-leg raises without a lag.

 Rehabilitation
Postoperative rehabilitation for the DOC patients followed a rigorous criterion-based 
protocol. Objective clinical criteria, such as pain, ROM, quadriceps strength and activation, 
and changes in knee joint effusion, were used to monitor and determine progression through 
the different phases of postoperative rehabilitation. These criteria, in addition to functional 
performance testing and patient-reported outcomes, were utilized to determine RTS 
readiness for athletes. Patients were observed for repeated testing at 6, 12, and 24 months 
after reconstruction. If patients were not maintaining strength or functional levels required to 
return to sport, counseling was provided. The respective rehabilitation protocols can be 
found in Appendices 1 and 2.
The MOON cohort patients followed a unified postoperative protocol regardless of the 
location at which their surgery or rehabilitation was performed. This protocol was criterion 
based, utilizing measures of pain, ROM, functional strength, and movement quality to 
progress patients through the phases of rehabilitation. RTS readiness was determined by a 
combination of objective measures (functional performance testing, patient-reported 
outcomes) and subjective measures (movement quality and confidence). Beyond those RTS 
criteria, the MOON protocol also recommended isokinetic strength testing, vertical jumps, 
and deceleration testing.
Outcome Measures
Patients completed the IKDC and KOOS preoperatively and again 2 years after ACLR. The 
IKDC is a valid and reliable measure commonly used in the ACL population.2,16 The 
minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the IKDC is 11.5 points.16 The KOOS is 
a valid and reliable outcome measure commonly used in the ACL-injured population to 
assess outcomes in knee pain, knee symptoms, knee function in daily activity, knee function 
in sporting activity, and knee-related quality of life.23,24 The proposed MCID for each 
subscale is 10 points.23
At enrollment, each patient was asked to report his or her primary sporting activity before 
the injury. At 2-year follow-up, patients were asked to name their primary sport currently 
(MOON) or if they had returned to their preinjury sport (DOC). Patients were considered to 
have returned to sport if they were participating in their preinjury sport 2 years after ACLR.
Statistical Analysis
Group differences were analyzed using chi-square tests for nominal variables and t tests for 
continuous variables. To account for differences in baseline IKDC scores, a 1-way analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare 2-year IKDC scores between groups with 
baseline IKDC scores as a covariate. To account for differences in baseline KOOS values, a 
1-way ANCOVA was used to compare 2-year KOOS values between groups with baseline 
KOOS values as a covariate for each subscale. Because differences were found between 
groups in the proportion of concomitant meniscal surgery, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
was used to assess the interaction of group and meniscal surgery on 2-year IKDC scores.

 ACLR, an ANOVA was used to assess the interaction of group and graft type on 2-year 
IKDC scores. All statistical analyses were performed using PASW version 23 (SPSS Inc).
Results
Patients who underwent ACLR from the DOC (n = 192) as well as 1995 MOON patients 
who met the DOC inclusion criteria were included in this study. There were no differences 
between groups in age, sex, or body mass index (Table 1). Baseline Marx scores were 
available in the MOON cohort (12.78 ± 4) but not the DOC. Surgical demographics revealed 
a higher proportion of patellar tendon autografts (P = .001) in the MOON cohort patients 
and a higher proportion of hamstring autografts (P = .006) in the DOC patients. There was 
also a significantly higher proportion of concomitant meniscal surgery performed (P = .029) 
in the MOON cohort (Table 2). There were no significant group × meniscal procedure (P = .
345) or group 3 graft type (P = .073) interactions on 2-year IKDC scores.
DOC patients had significantly higher baseline IKDC scores compared with the MOON 
cohort patients (70 ± 13 vs 50 ± 17, respectively; P < .001), which also exceeded the MCID 
(Figure 2). The IKDC score in DOC patients significantly improved from baseline to 
posttraining (after preoperative rehabilitation) (from 70 ± 13 to 77 ± 13; P < .001). Two 
years after reconstruction, 148 patients from the DOC and 1994 patients from the MOON 
cohort completed the IKDC. After controlling for baseline IKDC scores, DOC patients 
continued to have significantly higher IKDC scores than MOON cohort patients at 2 years 
after ACLR (84 ± 25 vs 71 ± 32, respectively; P < .001), again exceeding the MCID (Figure 
3). Post hoc power analysis revealed the ability to detect a difference of 2 points on the 
IKDC between groups.
Baseline KOOS values were available for 1991 patients in the MOON cohort and 58 patients 
in the DOC. DOC patients had significantly higher baseline KOOS values than MOON 
cohort patients across all subscales: pain (84 ± 11 vs 73 ± 17, respectively), symptoms (75 
± 14 vs 67 ± 18, respectively), activities of daily living (93 ± 7 vs 82 ± 17, respectively), 
sports/recreation (66 ± 19 vs 48 ± 29, respectively), and quality of life (51 ± 19 vs 37 ± 20, 
respectively) (all P < .001). After controlling for baseline KOOS values, DOC patients 
continued to have higher and clinically meaningful differences in KOOS subscale scores at 2 
years compared with MOON cohort patients: pain (94 ± 10 vs 78 ± 33, respectively; P = .
004), symptoms (89 ± 12 vs 72 ± 32, respectively; P < .001), activities of daily living (98 ± 5 
vs 82 ± 34, respectively; P = .006), sports/recreation (85 6 18 vs 70 6 33, respectively; P < .
001), and quality of life (76 ± 20 vs 64 ± 32, respectively; P = .072) (Figure 4). RTS rates 
were significantly higher in the DOC (72%) compared with the MOON cohort (63%) (P < .
001).
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to compare functional outcomes 2 years after ACLR in DOC 
patients who underwent additional progressive preoperative rehabilitation, including 
neuromuscular training, compared with the MOON cohort. The primary findings of this 
study are that the DOC patients had significantly higher and clinically meaningful patient-

 reported function and higher RTS rates 2 years after ACLR. Grindem and colleagues12 
found that preoperative rehabilitation led to higher KOOS values 2 years after reconstruction 
compared with the patients in the NKLR; however, the NKLR's postoperative rehabilitation 
was not standardized. Conversely, the patients in the MOON cohort received specified 
postoperative care at facilities that were part of large orthopaedic and sports medicine 
research centers, which allowed for a more homogeneous comparison between cohorts. This 
study did not determine what the optimal preoperative rehabilitation program is, and it did 
not differentiate which aspect of a program is most important (ie, progressive strengthening, 
neuromuscular training), but it does suggest that giving patients additional rehabilitation 
beyond a quiet knee (full ROM and quadriceps activation, little to no pain, or joint effusion) 
before surgery may lead to meaningful improved outcomes 2 years after ACLR.
Preoperative IKDC scores were higher in the DOC and may have been related to differences 
in the timing of baseline testing between cohorts. Baseline testing may have occurred before 
impairment resolution in the MOON cohort; however, the MOON protocol called for 
impairments to be resolved before undergoing reconstruction.30 Both cohorts had to achieve 
minimum criteria before surgery, ensuring that neither cohort had substantial impairments 
going into reconstruction. Several studies have shown preoperative muscle performance 
maximization and ROM deficit minimization related to optimized postoperative 
outcomes.5,8,18,21 This is also consistent with previously published findings that 
preoperative outcome scores significantly predict postoperative outcome scores.26 Eitzen 
and Moksnes9 found that a 5-week preoperative program can lead to improved functional 
outcomes after ACLR. Our overall findings are consistent with both Eitzen et al8 and 
Grindem et al12 in that progressive preoperative rehabilitation is an important factor to 
maximize postoperative outcomes.
While each cohort used a different rehabilitation protocol for preoperative and postoperative 
rehabilitation, both protocols utilized a criterion-based approach. Criterion-based 
rehabilitation protocols utilizing tissue-healing time frames, factors associated with 
outcomes, and expert opinion are considered the most evidence-based protocols to our 
current knowledge. Both of the protocols used have been published and are considered 
standard of care after an ACL injury.1,30 The primary difference between the postoperative 
protocols is that the DOC protocol used primarily objective criteria and the MOON cohort 
used a mixture of objective and subjective criteria for program advancement. Patients in the 
DOC also underwent structured follow-up testing at 6 months and 1 year after ACLR, which 
may have benefited them in terms of progressing home exercise programs or providing 
counseling and/or consultation on current functional status. While differences between graft 
type and meniscal procedure proportions between cohorts also have the potential to 
influence outcome scores at 2 years, our analysis of graft type and meniscal procedure on 
IKDC scores suggests that differences in proportions of surgical variables between cohorts 
did not have an effect on the outcome scores.
The DOC patients had a significantly higher RTS rate 2 years after ACLR compared with 
the MOON cohort patients. The MOON cohort's RTS rate of 63% is consistent with the 
Ardern et al3 meta-analysis that reported that 65% returned to preinjury sports. The DOC's 
RTS rate of 72% exceeded both that of the MOON cohort and that reported by Ardern et al.3 
Failla et al.

 Objective RTS criteria were used in both cohorts to determine individual readiness to return 
to sport among patients. There is currently no consensus on specific RTS criteria; however, 
the use of clinical, functional performance, and patient-reported outcome measures has been 
suggested as the current standards after ACLR.17 The DOC criteria used higher cutoff scores 
than the MOON criteria, which ensured higher symmetry between limbs before clearance 
for RTS. Functional performance symmetry restoration is needed to maximize patient-
reported functional recovery19 and may also explain some of the variation in 2-year outcome 
scores between cohorts.
A limitation of our study is that comparing 2 separate cohorts does not allow for a true cause 
and effect evaluation of extended preoperative rehabilitation to postoperative outcomes. 
There were also some differences in the postoperative rehabilitation programs, graft types, 
and RTS criteria that may have affected the outcomes. The strengths of this study are the 
large sizes of the cohorts, the application of similar inclusion and exclusion criteria to both 
cohorts for a homogeneous comparison, and the use of criterion-based postoperative 
protocols. Future studies should use the randomized controlled trial study design to better 
assess the value of preoperative rehabilitation after an ACL rupture.
Conclusion
The cohort treated with preoperative rehabilitation consisting of progressive strengthening 
and neuromuscular training had higher functional outcomes and RTS rates compared with 
the benchmark cohort that also used a criterion-based postoperative rehabilitation program 2 
years after ACLR. The standard of care in the United States is to achieve a quiet knee before 
undergoing reconstruction. While achieving a quiet knee before surgery may thwart surgical 
complications such as arthrofibrosis, it may not be enough to maximize functional outcomes 
even with rigorous postoperative rehabilitation. Progressive preoperative rehabilitation 
before ACLR should be considered as an addition to the standard of care to maximize 
functional outcomes after ACLR.
