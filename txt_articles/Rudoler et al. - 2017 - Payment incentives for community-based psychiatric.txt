P
ay for performance has been employed by many jurisdic-
tions to improve the delivery of evidence-based care, to 
expand access and to improve health outcomes.1 In Can-
ada, some provinces have implemented pay-for-performance 
incentives, particularly for primary care phys 
icians,2–6 despite the 
equivocal and limited nature of the evidence supporting them. In 
September 2011, the government of Ontario introduced bonus 
payments to encourage psychiatrists to provide rapid access to 
patients within 30 days of discharge after a psychiatric hospital 
admission and for 6 months after a suicide attempt. These are 
both high-risk periods for adverse events, and there is evidence 
that access to timely follow-up care may reduce the risk.7 By 
encouraging the delivery of follow-up care, the objective of these 
incentives was to help reduce the risk of deterioration, early 
re 
admission to hospital and possibly further suicide attempts. Imple-
mentation of these incentives followed similar attempts by pro-
vincial governments to improve the supply of services to high-risk 
patients in primary care settings.2,3,5,6 In particular, the govern-
ment of Ontario has introduced incentives to encourage primary 
care physicians to roster patients with severe mental illness. In 
British Columbia, incentives have been implemented to encour-
age primary care phys 
icians to create mental health care plans in 
collaboration with patients with a diagnosed mental illness.4 
In this study, we investigated whether psychiatrists changed 
their practice patterns in response to the September 2011 incen-
tives, and whether patients at high risk had better access to 
psych 
iatrists. Our research questions were as follows: What is 
the effect of financial incentives on psychiatrist supply of 
community-based mental health and addiction care after dis-
charge from hospital or after a suicide attempt? Can financial 
incentives increase access to community-based psychiatric care 
for patients after discharge or after a suicide attempt?

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: In September 2011, the 
government of Ontario implemented pay-
ment incentives to encourage the delivery 
of community-based psychiatric care to 
patients after discharge from a psychiatric 
hospital admission and to those with a 
recent suicide attempt. We evaluated 
whether these incentives affected supply 
of psychiatric services and access to care.  
METHODS: We used administrative data 
to capture monthly observations for all 
psychiatrists who practised in Ontario 
between September 2009 and August 
2014. We conducted interrupted time-
series analyses of psychiatrist-level and 
patient-level data to evaluate whether 
the incentives affected the quantity of 
eligible outpatient services delivered 
and the likelihood of receiving follow-up 
care.
RESULTS: Among 1921 psychiatrists 
evaluated, implementation of the incen-
tive payments was not associated with 
increased provision of follow-up visits 
after discharge from a psychiatric hospi-
tal admission (mean change in visits per 
month per psychiatrist 0.0099, 95% con-
fidence interval [CI] –0.0989 to 0.1206; 
change in trend 0.0032, 95% CI –0.0035 
to 0.0095) or after a suicide attempt 
(mean change –0.0910, 95% CI –0.1885 
to 0.0026; change in trend 0.0102, 95% 
CI 0.0045 to 0.0159). There was also no 
change in the probability that patients 
received follow-up care after discharge 
(change in level –0.0079, 95% CI –0.0223 
to 0.0061; change in trend 0.0007, 95% 
CI –0.0003 to 0.0016) or after a suicide 
attempt (change in level 0.0074, 95% CI 
–0.0094 to 0.0366; change in trend 
0.0006, 95% CI –0.0007 to 0.0022).
INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest 
that implementation of the incentives 
did not increase access to follow-up care 
for patients after discharge from a psych-
iatric hospital admission or after a sui-
cide attempt, and the incentives had no 
effect on supply of psychiatric services. 
Further research to guide design and 
implementation of more effective incen-
tives is warranted.

Methods
Setting
This longitudinal study was conducted in Ontario, where, in Sep-
tember 2011, the provincial government introduced 3 incentive 
payments to encourage the delivery of community-based psychi-
atric care. The first payment incentive (billing code K187) pays 
psychiatrists a 15% premium on specified service codes for pro-
viding outpatient care within 30 days after discharge from a 
psych 
iatric hospital admission. The second incentive (billing 
code K188) pays psychiatrists a 15% premium for specified ser-
vices delivered during the 180 days after a suicide attempt. The 
third incentive (billing code K189) pays psychiatrists an annual 
$200 fee for each patient for whom they provide follow-up within 
the community in the 4-week period after discharge from a psy-
chiatric hospital admission. 
Data sources
We used administrative data collected by the Ontario Ministry of 
Health and Long-Term Care and shared, via contractual agreement, 
with the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). These data 
included information on physician and practice characteristics, 
physician claims, patient characteristics, admissions to designated 
psychiatric hospital beds, emergency department visits and suicide 
attempts. We also used census data to obtain geographic (e.g., 
rurality measured using the Rurality Index of Ontario8) and socio-
economic variables. These data sets were linked using unique 
encoded identifiers and analyzed at ICES. Further details on the 
databases can be found in Appendix 1 (available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160816/-/DC1). 
The study period was September 2009 to August 2014. We 
captured monthly observations on 3 distinct cohorts over this 
period. The first cohort consisted of all practising psychiatrists in 
Ontario, except for those who did not appear both before and 
after implementation of the incentives. The second and third 
cohorts captured all patients with discharge from a psychiatric 
hospital admission and all patients with an emergency depart-
ment visit for a suicide attempt during the study period, respec-
tively. We excluded patients under 16 years of age (because few 
cases of severe mental illness are diagnosed before this age), 
those who were not eligible for public health care insurance, 
those who were not Ontario residents and those who had miss-
ing information on key variables. We treated observations on the 
same patient within a 30-day period as a single event, and used 
only the final observation during that period.
Outcomes
For our analysis, we considered 2 outcomes, at the levels of 
psych 
iatrists and patients, respectively. At the psychiatrist level, 
we estimated whether implementation of the incentives resulted 
in a change in the monthly rates of incentive-eligible services 
provided after hospital discharge or after a suicide attempt. At 
the patient level, we estimated whether implementation of the 
incentives resulted in a change in the likelihood of receiving an 
incentive-eligible service from a psychiatrist after discharge or 
after a suicide attempt. An incentive-eligible service was defined 
as having been provided within 30 days after hospital discharge 
or within 180 days after a suicide attempt, where billing codes 
eligible for an incentive payment were applied by the physician.
Covariables
Our main covariables of interest were the level change in the 
mean monthly number of visits following implementation of the 
incentives and the change in the slope (rate of change) in the 
monthly trend following implementation of the incentives.9 We 
also estimated the slope of the monthly trend before implemen-
tation of the incentives.
Statistical analysis
Because the incentives were implemented simultaneously for 
all psychiatrists in Ontario, and because no suitable compari-
son group could be generated with provincial data, we used an 
interrupted time-series design. For both the psychiatrist- and 
patient-level analyses, we aggregated the outcomes by gener-
ating monthly averages, and estimated the outcomes using a 
linear time-series model (further details are provided in 
Appendix 1). We used a Portmanteau (Q) test for stationarity of 
the trend to validate the model.10 For both levels of analysis, 
we calculated confidence intervals (CIs) using bootstrapped 
standard errors.
At the psychiatrist level, we stratified psychiatrists into quin-
tiles according to the quantity of incentive-eligible services pro-
vided in the pre-incentive period. This allowed us to determine 
whether the incentives had differential effects on psychiatrists 
who supplied higher quantities of eligible services in the pre-
incentive period. We also estimated the psychiatrist-level out-
comes using individual-level data and an estimator for a count 
outcome with overdispersion. This allowed us to control for a 
number of time-varying covariables and unobserved psychiatrist 
characteristics (Appendix 1).11,12 This alternative specification did 
produce material changes to our results. Thus, our main findings 
report the results of the linear model.
Ethics approval
The study was approved by the institutional review board at Sun-
nybrook Health Sciences Centre.
Results
Our sample included 1921 psychiatrists (Figure 1), who were fol-
lowed over a 60-month period (for a total of 111 924 monthly 
observations). Compared with the general psychiatrist popula-
tion, the providers of the highest quantities of eligible visits in 
the pre-incentive period were less likely to be women (28.7% v. 
38.7%), less likely to be trained in Canada (51.7% v. 61.9%) and 
more likely to be practising in rural areas (Rurality Index of 
Ontario > 0, 38.5% v. 21.9%) (Table 1). 
At the patient level, our sample included 304 574 patients who 
had been discharged after a psychiatric hospital admission and 
78 375 patients with a previous suicide attempt. In the pre-incentive 
period, patients with at least 1 visit to a psychiatrist in the 30 days 
after discharge tended to be women (54% v. 48%), tended to be

younger (41 yr v. 48 yr), and received greater annual primary care 
mental health billings (16.6 v. 12.7) and greater annual psychiatrist 
billings (51.0 v. 13.7) relative to those without a visit (Appendix 2, 
available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj 
.160816/-/DC1). Also in the pre-incentive period, patients with at 
least 1 visit to a psychiatrist in the 180 days after a suicide attempt 
tended to be women (62% v. 52%) and received greater annual pri-
mary care mental health billings (14.9 v. 5.2) and greater annual 
psychiatrist billings (27.6 v. 1.9) (Appendix 3, available at www.
cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.160816/-/DC1). 
We found that the average quantity of monthly visits per 
psych 
iatrist provided after discharge decreased after the intro-
duction of the payment incentives (from 1.50 to 1.43), as did the 
quantity of monthly visits provided after a suicide attempt (from 
1.35 to 1.23) (Table 2).
The results of our interrupted time-series analysis (Table 2) 
suggest that there was no immediate effect of the incentives on 
the quantity of visits supplied to patients after hospital discharge 
(mean change in visits per month per psychiatrist 0.0099, 95% CI 
–0.0989 to 0.1206) or after a suicide attempt (mean change 
–0.0910, 95% CI –0.1885 to 0.0026). There was also no change in 
the slope of the monthly trend for visits after hospital discharge 
(0.0032, 95% CI –0.0035 to 0.0095). There was a small increase in 
the monthly trend for visits provided after a suicide attempt 
(0.0102, 95% CI 0.0045 to 0.0159), which translated into a post-
incentive monthly trend of 0.003 more visits per month. These 
findings are presented graphically in Figure 2.
We also analyzed these data by quintiles, according to the 
number of eligible visits in the pre-incentive period (Table 2). For 
psychiatrists who provided the least number of eligible visits in 
the pre-incentive period (i.e., first to third quintiles), we observed 
a statistically significant immediate increase in the monthly 
quantity of visits provided after discharge (0.0862, 95% CI 0.0506 
to 0.1209) and after a suicide attempt (0.0697, 95% CI 0.0391 to 
0.1244) . However, the magnitude of these effects was small (less 
than 0.1 visits per month per psychiatrist). There was also a small 
change in the slope of the monthly trend following implementa-
tion of the incentives for postdischarge visits (0.0030, 95% CI 
0.0006 to 0.0054) and for visits provided after a suicide attempt 
(0.0056, 95% CI 0.0027 to 0.0086).
For psychiatrists who provided the most eligible visits in the 
pre-incentive period (i.e., fourth and fifth quintiles), we did not 
observe a statistically significant change in the monthly quantity 
of visits provided after hospital discharge (–0.0952, 95% CI 
–0.3211 to 0.1440), but did observe a statistically significant 
immediate decrease in the monthly quantity of visits provided 
after a suicide attempt (–0.3075, 95% CI –0.5212 to –0.1210). 
There was also no change in the slope of the monthly trend for 
postdischarge visits, and a small significant change in trend for 
visits provided after a suicide attempt (0.0143, 95% CI 0.0015 to 
0.0259). However, postdischarge visits displayed a slightly 
decreasing monthly trend overall after implementation of the 
incentives. 
The findings from our patient-level analysis (Table 3) suggest 
that the likelihood of receiving an eligible visit after hospital dis-
charge or after a suicide attempt remained static over the study 
period. Implementation of the incentives had no immediate 
effect on the probability of a patient seeing a psychiatrist 30 days

days after a suicide attempt (change in level 0.0074, 95% CI 
–0.0094 to 0.0366; change in trend 0.0006, 95% CI –0.0007 to 
0.0022). There was also no change in the slope of the monthly 
trend of the probability of a postdischarge visit (0.0007, 95% CI 
–0.0003 to 0.0016) or the probability of a visit after a suicide 
attempt (0.0006, 95% CI –0.0007 to 0.0022). These findings are 
presented graphically in Figure 3. 
To further explore the psychiatrist-level results, we calculated 
the proportion of psychiatrists who billed the payment incen-
tives, and the proportion of eligible services provided where the 
incentive payment was used (Table 4). The proportion of psych-
iatrists who billed the various incentive codes ranged from 8.5% 
for K189 to 23.7% for K187. The proportion of eligible services to 
which an incentive code was applied ranged from 1.35% (95% CI 
1.26% to 1.44%) for K189 to 5.50% (95% CI 5.33% to 5.67%) for 
K187 for all psychiatrists. However, among psychiatrists who 
billed at least 1 incentive code, these proportions ranged from 
95.77% (95% CI 95.20% to 96.34%) for K188 to 99.96% (95% CI 
99.91% to 100.00%) for K189. These results suggest that a small 
proportion of psychiatrists billed the incentives, and that those 
who used the incentive codes did so for a majority of their eli-
gible visits.
Interpretation
The 3 incentives implemented in Ontario did not have a mean-
ingful effect on psychiatrist behaviour or on the likelihood that 
patients would receive psychiatric care after discharge from hos-
pital or after a suicide attempt. The rates of follow-up care and 
the quantity of follow-up services provided remained static over 
the study period.
We propose 2 explanations for these findings. The first con-
cerns the design and implementation of the incentives. Using the 
average fee for eligible services, the incentive payment per eli-
gible service was about $30, which may not have been large 
enough to alter psychiatrist behaviour or to encourage psychia-
trists to incorporate the incentive codes into their usual billing 
routines. A similar study of Ontario’s diabetes incentive payment 
for primary care physicians also showed minimal improvements 
in care,2 and, like us, that study’s authors suggested that the 
result may have been due to the size of the incentive payment.2 
There is some evidence that the size of the incentive must be 
large enough to achieve behaviour response.13–19 One study sur-
veyed managers of health management organizations in the 
United States about how primary care physicians responded to 
financial incentives, and showed that bonuses of at least 5% of 
income would be sufficient to achieve behaviour change.15 Other 
research has identified several factors influencing the impact of 
pay for performance, including incentive size, duration, group 
versus individual incentives and case-mix risk-adjustment tech-
niques.1,13,17,18 The literature also suggests that communication 
and consultation can be key factors in the success of pay-for-
performance interventions, in particular, the involvement of pro-
viders in the design of performance measures and incentives.13,18 
It is possible that many Ontario psychiatrists simply did not know 
that the incentive payments were available.
The second explanation concerns the context in which the 
incentives were implemented. Kurdyak and colleagues20 
described great variation in the way psychiatric services are 
delivered in Ontario. Psychiatrists practising in urban areas, 
such as Toronto, were more likely to see fewer patients, but 
provided those patients with higher quantities of services. In 
the current study, we found that psychiatrists practising in 
urban areas were less likely to provide follow-up care and were 
less likely to take on newly discharged patients. The effective-
ness of financial incentives may be limited for these psychia-
trists, particularly if they are satisfied with the level of income 
they receive from their current practice. There is evidence that 
once phys 
icians reach a target income, the availability of addi-
tional payments will not lead to significant behaviour 
change.13,21 Unfortunately, we do not have access to informa-
tion on psychiatrists’ preferences; further exploration of these

preferences and views concerning payment could be the topic 
of future research.
Our results are in line with existing research. Using similar 
data, previous evaluations of pay for performance for primary 
care physicians in Canada have yielded mixed results2,6 or shown 
no effects.3,4 The proportion of physicians billing the incentives 
was lower in our case than in other similar studies2,3,6 but was 
similar to the proportion of primary care physicians billing cer-
tain of the incentives in the study by Li and colleagues.6 
Although pay for performance has been widely implemented, 
there is equivocal and limited evidence regarding its effective-
ness.19,22–27 A systematic review of the effect of financial incen-
tives for primary care physicians found modest or no effects.23 
Lavergne and colleagues4 evaluated pay-for-performance pay-
ments for primary care physicians in BC and found that incen-
tives had no effect on visits or continuity of care, but were associ-
ated with increased rates of hospital admission. Several studies 
of primary care pay for performance for cancer screening and 
diabetes management have been conducted in Ontario,2,3,6 with 
similarly equivocal results. For instance, Kiran and colleagues3 
evaluated incentives for cancer screening for primary care phys-
icians in Ontario and found no effect on cancer screening rates, 
which were already increasing before implementation of the 
incentives. Li and colleagues,6 in an evaluation of a series of pre-
ventive care pay-for-performance incentives for primary care 
physicians in Ontario, found that a small proportion of eligible 
physicians billed these claims (between 2% and 47% in most 
periods) and that the introduction of the incentives had modest 
effects on preventive care.
Most work thus far has been on primary care incentives, 
whereas little work has investigated pay for performance for 
mental health and addiction services in general or on psychia-
trist behaviour specifically. Gutacker and colleagues28 evalu-
ated whether incentives in the Quality for Outcomes Frame-
work in the United Kingdom led to reductions in hospital 
admission for individuals with severe mental illness. Using 
data on a sample of 8234 primary care physician practices,

they found that the achievement of quality indicators for men-
tal health and addiction care was associated with higher rates 
of psychiatric admission. In the US, Unützer and colleagues29 
evaluated a pay-for-performance incentive that was part of a 
larger quality improvement intervention for a state-funded 
community health plan for low-income adults with physical or 
mental health conditions (n = 1673 patients before and n = 
6304 patients after implementation of the incentive). These 
authors found that the pay-for-performance payment was 
associated with improvements in timely follow-up and in time 
to depression improvement. Two US studies30,31 found that 
incentives for psychiatrists had positive effects on quality mea-
sures and access. Using a cluster randomized trial design 
(including 105 therapists and 986 patients), the authors found 
that a pay-for-performance intervention to improve treatment 
for adolescents with substance use disorders had a positive 
effect on the use of evidence-based treatment, but no effect on 
patient outcomes.31
Limitations
This study had some limitations. First, we did not have a compar-
ison group and relied on time-series variation to assess the effect 
of the payment incentives. It is possible that in the absence of 
these incentive payments, there would have been a discontinuity 
in the trends; however, we believe this is unlikely, given the sta-
bility of the observed trends. Second, our study suffered from 
censoring. Psychiatrists drop out of practice for unknown rea-
sons (e.g., parental leave, leaving the province), and we were 
unable to control for this factor with the available data.
Conclusion
We found that incentives to encourage community-based psychi-
atric follow-up care were not associated with improvements in 
access to care or changes in physician behaviour. Although we 
focused on the situation in Ontario, our findings will be impor-
tant for policy-makers in all high-income countries where the use 
of payment incentives to improve health care delivery is an 
important concern. Our results do not necessarily suggest that 
financial incentives should be abandoned as a tool to improve 
the delivery of health care services, but they do indicate that 
careful thought should be given to the design of such incentives 
and the context in which they are implemented. For instance, 
further research using a mixed-methods design could explore 
why psychiatrists were not responsive to these particular incen-
tives, and whether specific features of the Ontario context were 
contributing factors. As it stands, the provincial investment in 
these incentive payments has not produced any discernible 
value, and psychiatrists are not responding.
