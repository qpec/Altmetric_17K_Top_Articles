SUMMARY
Sex hormones regulate many autoimmune and in-
flammatory diseases, including asthma. As adults,
asthma prevalence is 2-fold greater in women
compared to men. The number of group 2 innate
lymphoid cells (ILC2) is increased in patients with
asthma, and we investigate how testosterone atten-
uates ILC2 function. In patients with moderate to se-
vere asthma, we determine that women have an
increased number of circulating ILC2 compared to
men. ILC2 from adult female mice have increased
IL-2-mediated ILC2 proliferation versus ILC2 from
adult male mice, as well as pre-pubescent females
and males. Further, 5a-dihydrotestosterone, a hor-
mone downstream of testosterone, decreases lung
ILC2 numbers and IL-5 and IL-13 expression from
ILC2. In vivo, testosterone attenuated Alternaria-
extract-induced IL-5+ and IL-13+ ILC2 numbers
and lung eosinophils by intrinsically decreasing
lung ILC2 numbers, as well as by decreasing expres-
sion of IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin
(TSLP),
ILC2-stimulating
cytokines.
Collectively,
these findings provide a foundational understanding
of sexual dimorphism in ILC2 function.
INTRODUCTION
Gender disparities in immune-mediated responses are driven by
differences in sex hormone concentrations, anatomy, and/or X-
or Y-linked genes (Fish, 2008). Female dominance exists in
many autoimmune diseases, including lupus, multiple sclerosis,
and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as in inflammatory diseases,
such as asthma (Carey et al., 2007a; Fish, 2008). During child-
hood, asthma is most prevalent in boys compared to girls
(ALA, 2012; Carey et al., 2007a; Fitzpatrick et al., 2011). How-
ever, around puberty, there is a shift in asthma prevalence, and
at mid-life, women are about twice as likely as men to have
asthma (ALA, 2012; Carey et al., 2007a). Changes in asthma
prevalence that coincide with changes in sex hormones strongly
suggest a role for sex hormones in asthma pathogenesis. While
sex hormone regulation of inflammation in asthma has been
described (Fuseini and Newcomb, 2017), the role of sex hor-
mones in modulating lung innate lymphoid cell (ILC)-mediated
responses is less clear.
ILCs are a rare population of lymphocytes that are important
for the initiation of inflammatory responses (Serafini et al.,
2015) that express the surface markers CD25 and CD127, com-
ponents of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor (R) and the IL-7R,
respectively. Once stimulated, ILCs rapidly produce cytokines
in an antigen independent manner (Barlow et al., 2012; Halim
et al., 2012a; Klein Wolterink et al., 2012), and ILCs are classified
into groups, ILC1, 2, or 3, that broadly mimic the transcriptional
programming, cytokine production, and effector function of
adaptive CD4+ Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, respectively (Serafini
et al., 2015).
ILC2 play a central role in the propagation of allergic
responses and asthma. ILC2 are activated by the cytokines
IL-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and/or IL-25 leading
to increased Gata3 and Rora expression and the production of
predominantly IL-5 and IL-13, as well as IL-4, IL-9, and amphir-
egulin (Hoyler et al., 2012; Mjo
¨ sberg et al., 2012). IL-5 production
is imperative for infiltration of eosinophils into the airway, a key
pathologic feature of allergy, and IL-13 is important for increased
airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus production (Halim et al.,
2012a). ILC2 secrete more IL-5 and IL-13 compared to CD4+
T cells and are also important for establishing a memory Th2
allergic response in the lung and skin, underscoring the substan-
tial pathophysiologic potential of ILC2 (Halim et al., 2014; Klein
Wolterink et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2016).
ILC2 were increased in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) of patients with allergic asthma compared to healthy
controls (Bartemes et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015). Further, ILC2
were increased in the induced sputum and PBMCs of patients
with severe, eosinophilic asthma compared to milder forms of
asthma (Smith et al., 2016). Mouse in vivo experiments revealed
that lung ILC2 have a critical role in rapid Th2-type inflammation
in response to protease aeroallergens such as Alternaria alter-
nata, which is associated with severe exacerbations of asthma

 (Agarwal, 2011; Dales et al., 2000; Neukirch et al., 1999; Zureik
et al., 2002). Collectively, these data highlight the significance
of ILC2 in allergic inflammation and emphasize the need to better
understand the mechanisms that regulate ILC2, particularly in
the context of asthma where a gender disparity is prominent.
Recently, androgen receptor (AR) signaling decreased ILC2
progenitor cell numbers in the bone marrow as well as IL-33-
induced ILC2-mediated airway inflammation (Laffont et al.,
2017). However, it remained unknown if women with asthma
have increased circulating ILC2 compared to men with
asthma.
Further,
the
mechanisms
by
which
androgen
receptor signaling mediated ILC2 functions had not been fully
elucidated. We hypothesized that testosterone and its deriva-
tive, 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), signaling through AR,
negatively regulates ILC2 cytokine expression and ILC2-
mediated airway inflammation. Our data show that women
with asthma have increased numbers of circulating ILC2
compared to men with asthma, while testosterone and
5a-DHT negatively regulates ILC2 proliferation and cytokine
expression, as well as ILC2-mediated Alt-Ext induced allergic
airway inflammation.
RESULTS
Women with Asthma Have an Increased Number of ILC2
in Peripheral Blood Compared to Men with Asthma
ILC2 are important for allergic airway inflammation associated
with asthma (Halim et al., 2012a; Neill et al., 2010), and patients
with asthma have increased circulating ILC2 compared to
healthy controls (Bartemes et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015). To deter-
mine if there was a gender difference in circulating ILC2, we re-
cruited women and men of reproductive age (18–45 years old)
with moderate to severe asthma as well as healthy control.
Participants were excluded for infections within 2 weeks, and
women were excluded if pregnant, breastfeeding, or taking hor-
monal birth control medications. Demographic information
about participants with asthma and healthy controls can be
seen in Table S1. Clinical characteristics of participants with
asthma can be seen in Table S2. No differences in inhaled corti-
costeroid use, percentage of forced expired volume in one sec-
ond (%FEV1) predicted, or serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE)
concentrations were determined in women and men with
asthma. PBMCs and total blood volume were quantified from
each patient, and the number of ILC2, defined as lineage nega-
tive (Lin�) CD45+ CD127+ CD161+ CD25+ CRTH2+ cells (Fig-
ure 1A), was assessed by flow cytometry. Women and men
with asthma had increased numbers of circulating ILC2, defined
as a percentage of PBMCs per milliliter of blood, as well as
increased percentage of Gata3+ ILC2 compared to healthy
women and men, respectively, (Figures 1B–1D). In comparing
participants with asthma based on gender, women with asthma
had increased ILC2 percentage compared to men with asthma.
No gender difference was seen in ILC2 of healthy women
compared to healthy men (0.012 ± 0.006% versus 0.009 ±
0.001% ILC2, respectively). Women with asthma also had an
increased percentage of Gata3+ ILC2 and increased Gata3
mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) compared to men with asthma
(Figures 1C–1E). To ensure the increased circulating ILC2 in
women compared to men with asthma were not due to differen-
tial surface expression of CD161 or CRTH2, we quantified the
number of Lin� CD45+ CD127+ Gata3+ cells. Using this gating
strategy, we saw similar results with women with asthma having
increased ILC2 compared to men with asthma (Figures S1A and
S1B).
We also measured IL-5 production in ILC2 from healthy and
asthmatic women and men. Enriched Lin� cells were restimu-
lated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), ionomycin,
and GolgiStop to induce cytokine production. After restimula-
tion, IL-5+ ILC2 were increased in participants with asthma
compared to healthy controls, and women with asthma had
increased IL-5+ ILC2 compared to men with asthma (Figures
1F–1H). Combined, these data show that women with asthma
have
increased circulating
ILC2
compared to
men
with
asthma.
Sex Hormones Regulate IL-2-Dependent ILC2
Proliferation
To determine if sex hormones regulated ILC2, we isolated ILCs
from the lungs of male and female adult mice or pre-pubescent
mice (< 4 weeks of age). Total lung numbers were similar be-
tween all groups of mice (Figure S2A). Lung ILCs, defined as
viable, Lin� CD45+ CD90+ CD25+ CD127+ cells (Figure S2B),
were sorted for in vitro stimulation, but surprisingly, the number
of sorted lung ILCs were increased in adult female mice
compared to adult male mice and pre-pubescent female and
male mice (Figures 2A and 2B). No differences in lung ILCs
were detected in pre-pubescent female and male mice. To
determine why decreased ILCs were sorted from the lungs of
adult male mice compared to adult female mice, we quanti-
tated the percentage of CD25+ and CD127+ cells as well as
the MFI of CD25 and CD127. The percentage of CD25+ ILCs
as well as the CD25 MFI was decreased on lung ILCs from
naive adult male mice compared to naive adult female mice
(Figures 2C–2E). However, no differences in CD127+ ILCs or
CD127 MFI were determined in adult male and female ILCs.
Pre-pubescent male and female mice had similar percentages
of CD25+ and CD127+ ILCs and no change in CD25 or
CD127 MFI (Figures 2C–2E). The IL-2R is comprised of CD25,
IL-2RB, and the common gamma chain (common g chain).
The IL-7R is comprised of CD127 and the common g chain.
Since we detected decreased CD25 MFI in ILCs from adult
male mice compared to female mice, we quantitated IL-2RB
MFI and common g chain MFI in ILCs. IL-2RB MFI was slightly,
but significantly, decreased in ILCs from adult male compared
to female mice, but no differences were detected in common
gamma chain MFI (Figure S3). These results suggested that
sex hormones were important for lung ILC numbers by regu-
lating IL-2R signaling.
To activate ILC2, sorted ILCs from adult male and female mice
were stimulated with IL-2 and IL-33 for 6 days and IL-5 and IL-13
protein expression and transcription factor mRNA expression
was determined. We did not include pre-pubescent mice, since
no differences in CD25 and CD127 expression was determined
in these mice. IL-5 and IL-13 protein expression was decreased
in ILC2 from male mice compared to ILC2 from female mice
(Figures 2F–2G). Further, Gata3 and Rora expression was
2488
Cell Reports 21, 2487–2499, November 28, 2017
 significantly decreased in lung ILC2 from male mice compared to
female mice (Figures 2H and 2I).
IL-2R signaling and RORa are important for ILC proliferation
(Halim et al., 2012b; Serafini et al., 2015; Wong et al., 2012),
and we next determined the proliferative capacity of lung ILCs
from adult male and female mice following IL-2 plus IL-33 stim-
ulation. ILC2 from male mice had decreased proliferation
compared to ILC2 from female mice (Figure 3A). To determine
if the gender difference in ILC2 proliferation was mediated by
IL-2R signaling, and not IL-7R signaling, we stimulated ILC2
from adult female and male mice with IL-2, IL-7, IL-33, IL-2
plus IL-33, or IL-7 plus IL-33 for 3 days and quantified ILC2 pro-
liferation with Ki67+ staining (Figures 3 and S4). Very few Ki67+
ILC2 were quantified when cells were stimulated with IL-2 alone
or IL-7 alone. Stimulation with only IL-33 resulted in Ki67+ ILC2,
with males having decreased Ki67+ ILC2 compared to females.
IL-2 plus IL-33-stimulated ILC2 from female mice had increased
Ki67+ staining compared to IL-33 alone or IL-7 plus IL-33 stimu-
lation. IL-2 plus IL-33-stimulated ILC2 male mice had decreased
Ki67+ ILC2 compared to ILC2 from female mice, but there were
no gender differences in Ki67+ ILC2 in IL-7 plus IL-33-stimulated
cells (Figure 3B). Based on these data, we performed additional
experiments using IL-2 plus IL-33 or IL-7 plus IL-33 stimulation
conditions.

 IL-2 signaling through the IL-2R or IL-7 signaling through the
IL-7R increases STAT5 phosphorylation and regulates ILC2 pro-
liferation. Therefore, we next measured phosphorylation of
STAT5 by flow cytometry in IL-2 plus IL-33 or IL-7 plus IL-33-
stimulated ILC2 from male and female mice. ILC2 from male
mice stimulated with IL-2 plus IL-33 had decreased STAT5 phos-
phorylation compared to female ILC2, but no difference in STAT5
phosphorylation was determined in male and female ILC2 stim-
ulated with IL-7 plus IL-33 (Figure 3C). Combined, these data
show gender differences in ILC2 proliferation with IL-2 plus
IL-33, but not IL-7 plus IL-33, stimulation.
To determine cytokine expression from male and female ILC2,
we cultured ILC2 in varying conditions for 6 days and then re-
stimulated ILC2 with PMA, ionomycin, and GolgiStop to mea-
sure IL-5 and IL-13 production by flow cytometry. Male lung
ILC2 stimulated with IL-2 plus IL-33 had decreased IL-5+ and
IL-13+ ILC2 compared to female lung ILC2. No difference in
IL-5+ and IL-13+ ILC2 was observed with IL-7 plus IL-33 stimu-
lation (Figures 3D and 3E). However, the percentage of IL-5+ and
IL-13+ ILC2 was similar in male and female ILC2 stimulated with
either IL-2 plus IL-33 or IL-7 plus IL-33. Collectively, these data
show that male mice had decreased ILC2 proliferation that re-
sulted in decreased IL-5+ and IL-13+ ILC2, compared to female
mice. However, it remained unclear which sex hormone(s) were
responsible for the observed changes.
5a-DHT Inhibited IL-5 and IL-13 Protein Expression from
Lung ILC2
Since lung ILCs were decreased in male mice compared to fe-
male mice, we hypothesized that endogenous sex hormones
were important in regulating ILC2 proliferation and cytokine
expression. Previously we showed that prolonged administra-
tion of 17b-estradiol (17b-E2) and progesterone (P4) signifi-
cantly increased Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17A protein
expression (Newcomb et al., 2015). Therefore, we administered
slow-release pellets containing 5a-DHT, 17b-E2, P4, the com-
bination of 17b-E2 and P4, or vehicle for 21 days to gonadec-
tomized male mice, which lack testosterone. Vehicle pellets
were also administered to sham-operated male and female
mice, with normal levels of testosterone and ovarian hormones,
respectively. CD25+ CD127+ ILCs were then sorted from the
lungs of sham-operated and gonadectomized mice. Sham-
operated
male
mice
administered
vehicle
pellets
had
decreased sorted lung ILCs compared to sham-operated fe-
male mice and gonadectomized male mice administered
vehicle pellets (Figure 4A). Gonadectomized male mice admin-
istered 5a-DHT pellets also had decreased sorted lung ILC
numbers compared to gonadectomized male mice adminis-
tered vehicle pellets. No significant differences in sorted lung
ILC numbers were detected in gonadectomized male mice
administered 17b-E2, P4, or the combination of 17b-E2 and

 P4 pellets compared to gonadectomized male mice adminis-
tered vehicle. These results showed that 5a-DHT, and not
17b-E2 or P4, modulated the number of sorted lung ILCs.
Therefore, we focused on 5a-DHT regulation of ILC2. Sham-
operated male mice administered vehicle and gonadectomized
male mice administered 5a-DHT pellets had decreased per-
centage of CD25+ ILC2 and CD25 MFI compared to sham-
operated
female
mice
and
gonadectomized
male
mice
administered vehicle pellets (Figures 4B–4D). No difference in
CD127 MFI was detected between any groups (Figures 4B–4D).
Next, we determined if administration of 5a-DHT negatively
regulated cytokine expression from ILC2. IL-5 and IL-13 protein
expression as well as Rora expression were significantly
decreased in ILC2 from sham-operated male mice administered
vehicle and gonadectomized male mice administered 5a-DHT
compared to ILC2 from sham-operated female mice and gonad-
ectomized male mice administered vehicle (Figures 4E, 4F,
and 4H). While ILC2 from sham-operated male mice had
decreased Gata3 expression compared to ILC2 from sham-
operated female mice, no differences in Gata3 expression
were detected in ILC2 from sham-operated or gonadectomized
male mice (Figure 4G). Similar to our results in Figure 4A, admin-
istration of 17b-E2, P4, or the combination of 17b-E2 and P4 to
gonadectomized male mice had no effect on IL-5 and IL-13 pro-
tein expression or on Rora expression from ILC2 compared to
gonadectomized male mice administered vehicle (Figure S5).
However, ILC2 from mice administered 17b-E2 and P4 had
increased Gata3 expression compared to ILC2 from mice
administered vehicle.
While long-term administration of 5a-DHT to mice negatively
regulated IL-5 and IL-13 production from ILC2 ex vivo, it was un-
known whether 5a-DHT would rapidly inhibit ILC2 cytokine
expression in culture. AR has been reported to be expressed
on ILC2 progenitor cells (Laffont et al., 2017), and we determined
that AR mRNA expression was similar in lung ILC2 from females
and males (Figure 4I). Therefore, female ILC2 were stimulated
with IL-2 and IL-33 in the presence of 5a-DHT (0.1–3 nM) or
vehicle (methanol). ILC2 from female mice were used because
these cells developed in a low testosterone environment. IL-5
and IL-13 were significantly decreased in 5a-DHT-treated ILC2
compared to vehicle treated ILC2 (Figures 4J and 4K). 5a-DHT
also decreased Rora expression but had no effect on Gata3
expression
(Figures
4L
and
4M).
Combined,
these
data
suggested that 5a-DHT negatively regulated Rora expression
and IL-5 and IL-13 protein expression in ILC2, but that Gata3
expression was regulated by 17b-E2 and P4.

 Male Mice Have Less Alt-Ext-Induced Airway
Inflammation Compared to Female Mice
Our in vitro data demonstrate that 5a-DHT negatively regulated
IL-5 and IL-13+ ILC2, but the role of sex hormones in an innate
immune-mediated model of airway inflammation remained un-
known. Previous studies had examined ILC2 function in models
that have both ILC2 and CD4+ T cell-mediated inflammation
(Laffont et al., 2017; Warren et al., 2017). Alternaria alternata
caused allergic airway inflammation and asthma exacerbations
in persons sensitized to this fungus (Agarwal, 2011). We have pre-
viously shown that 4 day exposure to Alternaria extract (Alt Ext)
increased ILC2 cytokine expression and eosinophil infiltration
(Toki et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016). Therefore, to determine if
sex hormones regulated Alt-Ext-induced airway inflammation,
male and female wild-type (WT) mice were challenged with Alt
Ext or PBS for 4 consecutive days, and lungs were collected
24 hr after the final Alt Ext challenge and analyzed for IL-5 and
IL-13 production (Figures 5A–5C). Alt-Ext-challenged male and

 female mice had increased lung IL-5 and IL-13 protein expression
compared to PBS control mice (Figures 5B and 5C). However,
Alt-Ext-challenged male mice had a significantly less IL-5 and
IL-13 production compared to Alt-Ext-challenged female mice.
To ensure the responses we were seeing were independent of
adaptive lymphocytes, we repeated the experiment in Alt-Ext-
challenged male and female recombination-activating gene
(Rag)1�/� mice, which lack T and B lymphocytes. Alt-Ext-chal-
lenged male Rag1�/� mice had decreased lung IL-5 and IL-13
protein expression compared to Alt-Ext-challenged female
Rag1�/� mice (Figures S6A and S6B). Combined, these data sug-
gest that the innate immune-mediated response to Alt Ext is
diminished in male mice compared to female mice.
Testosterone Decreases Alt-Ext-Induced Airway
Inflammation in Mice
We next elucidated the hormone(s) responsible for the altered
innate immune responses in male and female mice. Sham-oper-
ated male and female mice as well as gonadectomized male and
female mice were challenged with Alt Ext. The number of lung
ILC2, defined as Lin� CD45+ CD127+ ST2+ cells, were deter-
mined in Alt-Ext-challenged mice, and lung ILC2 were signifi-
cantly decreased in sham male mice compared to sham and
gonadectomized female mice and gonadectomized male mice
(Figure 5D). Surprisingly, no differences were determined in the
number of lung ILC2 in sham-operated and gonadectomized fe-
male mice. CD25+ ILC2 were also decreased in sham-operated
male mice compared to sham-operated female, gonadecto-
mized female, and gonadectomized male mice, but no differ-
ences in CD25 MFI were detected (Figure 5F). Next, we
determined the number of IL-5 and IL-13 producing ILC2. Cells
were pre-gated on Lin�, CD45+, CD127+ and then gated on
CD45+ ST2+ (left panel) followed by gating on IL-5 and IL-13
(right panel). Isotype controls for IL-5 and IL-13 staining are
shown in Figure S7. The number of Alt-Ext-induced ST2+ ILC2
was significantly decreased in sham-operated male compared
to sham-operated female and gonadectomized male mice (Fig-
ures 5G and 5H). Further, the total number of Alt-Ext-induced
IL-5+ ILC2 was significantly decreased in gonadectomized
female, sham-operated male, and gonadectomized male mice
compared to sham-operated female mice (Figures 5G and 5I)
but increased in gonadectomized male mice compared to
sham-operated male mice. As shown previously, Alt Ext induced
less IL-13 compared to IL-5 in ILC2 (Zhou et al., 2016). Never-
theless, IL-13+ ILC2 were also significantly decreased in
sham-operated male mice compared to gonadectomized male
mice and sham-operated female mice (Figures 5G and 5I). Taken
together, these data suggested that testosterone negatively
regulated ILC2 in the lung, ST2+ ILC2, ILC2-derived IL-5 and
IL-13 production, whereas ovarian hormones enhanced IL-5
production from lung ILC2.
IL-5 is important for the development and maturation of eosin-
ophils, and our Alt Ext challenge protocol increased eosinophil
infiltration into the airway compared to vehicle (Zhou et al.,
2016). Alt-Ext-challenged sham-operated male mice had a sig-
nificant decrease in BAL eosinophils compared to Alt-Ext-chal-
lenged sham-operated female and gonadectomized male mice
(Figure 5J).
Alt-Ext-challenged gonadectomized
male and
gonadectomized female mice had a significant decrease in
BAL eosinophils compared to Alt-Ext-challenged sham-oper-
ated female mice, suggesting that testosterone decreased and
ovarian hormones increased eosinophil infiltration into the lung,
consistent with IL-5 expression in the ILC2 compartment (Fig-
ure 5I). No significant changes were detected in the percentages
or numbers of lymphocytes or neutrophils in the BAL fluid be-
tween groups after Alt Ext challenge (data not shown). Mucus
production after Alt Ext challenge was also determined in the
lung. Sham-operated and gonadectomized male mice as well
as gonadectomized female mice had decreased mucus produc-
tion compared to sham-operated female mice (Figure 5K). These
results showed that testosterone decreased and ovarian hor-
mones increased eosinophilic inflammation after Alt Ext chal-
lenge, but it remained unclear if testosterone directly or indirectly
affected ILC2 cytokine expression in vivo.
We also quantified IL-33 protein expression in the BAL fluid
and TSLP protein expression in whole lung homogenates at
1 hr or 6 hr, respectively, following the last Alt Ext-challenge to
determine whether testosterone affected the release of these
cytokines. IL-33 and TSLP protein expression was significantly
increased in the BAL fluid of Alt-Ext-challenged mice compared
to vehicle (PBS) challenged mice (data not shown). Sham-
operated male mice had decreased IL-33 and TSLP protein
expression compared to sham-operated female mice and
gonadectomized male and female mice (Figure 5L). IL-33 and
TSLP protein expression was similar in Alt-Ext-challenged
sham-operated and gonadectomized female mice. These data
show that testosterone negatively regulated Alt-Ext-induced
IL-33 and TSLP, but that ovarian hormones had no effect on
IL-33 and TSLP secretion.
To determine the sufficiency of IL-33 alone to induce gender-
mediated differences in ILC2 cytokine production, mice were
intranasally challenged with 350ng of rmIL-33 daily for 4 consec-
utive days and then BAL fluid was collected and lungs were
analyzed for IL-5+ and IL-13+ ILC2 by flow cytometry. Similar
to Alt-Ext-induced airway inflammation, the number of rmIL-
33-induced ST2+ ILC2 cells was significantly decreased in

 sham-operated male compared to sham-operated female and
gonadectomized male mice (Figures S8A and S8B). IL-33-
induced IL-5+ ILC2 were decreased in gonadectomized female,
sham-operated male, and gonadectomized male mice compared
to sham-operated female mice and increased in gonadectomized
male mice compared to sham-operated male mice. IL-13+ ILC2
were minimal with rmIL-33 administration and were not quanti-
fied. We also determined IL-33 in whole lung homogenates. After
rmIL-33 administration, sham-operated male mice and gonadec-
tomized female mice had decreased whole lung IL-33 compared
to sham-operated female mice and gonadectomized male mice
(Figure S8C). These results suggest that sex hormones are impor-
tant in regulating IL-33 production, degradation, and/or oxidation
as well as cytokine-producing ILC2.
Testosterone Negatively Regulated ILC2 via a Cell-
Intrinsic Mechanism
To determine if testosterone directly attenuated ILC2 cytokine
expression, we utilized a mixed bone marrow chimera model
whereby lethally irradiated WT CD90.1+ CD90.2+ male mice
were reconstituted with a 1:1 mixture of CD90.1+ WT and
CD90.2+ androgen receptortfm (ARtfm) bone marrow. ARtfm
mice have a mutation in the AR and are unresponsive to andro-
gens, including testosterone and testosterone derivatives. ARtfm
mice are on a C57BL/6 background, and we determined that WT
C57BL/6 male mice have significantly decreased lung ILC2
(3,133 ± 1,362 lung ILC2, n = 4, p < 0.05) compared to WT
C57BL/6 female mice (12,140 ± 3181 lung ILC2, n = 4). Six weeks
after transplant, recipient mice were challenged with 4 intranasal
daily doses of Alt Ext. 24 hr after the final challenge, lungs from
the recipient mice were harvested and the number of WT
and ARtfm IL-5+ and/or IL-13+ ILC2 were determined. The num-
ber of IL-5+ and/or IL-13+ ILC2 from the ARtfm lineage was
significantly increased in both the PBS and Alt Ext treated groups
compared to the number of ILC2 from the WT lineage (Figures 6B
and 6C). Further, CD25+ ILC2 were significantly increased in the
Alt Ext-treated ARtfm ILC2 compared to Alt Ext-treated WT ILC2,
but CD25 MFI was similar between groups (Figures 6D–6F).

 Combined, these data show that androgen receptor signaling
decrease ILC2 numbers in the lung at baseline and that upon
allergen challenge with Alt Ext that androgen receptor signaling
further represses ILC2 numbers and decreases CD25 express-
ing cells.
DISCUSSION
Sex hormones mediate cellular and humoral immune pathways
and may partially explain the increased prevalence of autoim-
mune diseases and inflammation in women compared to men
(Fish, 2008). Asthma prevalence increases in females at the
time of puberty, and epidemiological studies have associated
puberty, measured by increasing Tanner stages, with decreased
asthma symptoms in boys and increased asthma symptoms in
girls (Fu et al., 2014). Several studies in women showed changes
in hormone levels, either during the menstrual cycle or in taking
oral contraceptives, modulated asthma symptoms (Fuseini and
Newcomb, 2017). However, the mechanisms by which sex hor-
mones regulate asthma are not fully elucidated.
Mouse studies showed that ILC2 are important for establish-
ing and maintaining allergic responses, including allergic airway
inflammation associated with asthma. Previously, ex vivo IL-33-
stimulated ILC2 from OVA-challenged male mice had decreased
IL-5 and IL-13 production compared to ILC2 from OVA-chal-
lenged female mice (Warren et al., 2017). Further, androgen
signaling has also shown to negatively regulate ILC2 cytokine
production and ILC2 numbers in the lung after IL-33 administra-
tion (Laffont et al., 2017). In this study, we expand upon these
findings and determined that ILC2 circulating cells in men with
asthma are decreased compared to women with asthma,
despite having similar baseline characteristics. Further, testos-
terone and androgen signaling attenuated IL-2R-mediated ILC
proliferation, ILC2 numbers in the lung, and ILC2-mediated
airway inflammation. Combined, these studies provide a foun-
dational understanding in the sexual dimorphism in ILC2 func-
tion, and one potential explanation for increased prevalence of
asthma in women compared to men.
IL-2 signaling through the IL-2R is important for ILC prolifera-
tion and T cell activation and proliferation (Serafini et al., 2015).
It has previously been reported that soluble CD25 and IL-2 are
increased in the BAL fluid of patients with asthma compared to
healthy controls (Park et al., 1994). A randomized, double-
blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on dacli-
zumab, a CD25 monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate
to severe asthma that do not respond to inhaled corticosteroids.
Patients administered daclizumab had increased %FEV1 and
decreased daytime asthma symptoms with no significant differ-
ences in adverse side effect compared to placebo (Busse et al.,
2008). Our data show that testosterone and androgen signaling
negatively regulated CD25 expression on ILC2 in vitro and that
Alt Ext challenge decreased the number of CD25+ ILC2, but
had no effect on CD25 MFI, in lungs of mice with intact testos-
terone and androgen receptor signaling. CD25 MFI was
decreased on sorted ILCs from male mice compared to female
mice (Figure 2). The discordant findings between in vitro and
in vivo CD25 MFI expression are likely due to culturing and/or
kinetic differences. Nevertheless, testosterone and androgen
signaling decreased CD25+ ILC2, both in vitro and after Alt Ext
challenge, as well as regulated IL-2R mediated proliferation,
suggesting that targeting IL-2R signaling may particularly benefit
women with moderate to severe allergic asthma (Busse et al.,
2008; Laffont et al., 2017).
The roles of estrogen signaling and 5a-DHT in allergic airway
inflammation have been conducted in mouse models with both
CD4+ Th2-mediated and ILC2-mediated inflammation (Card
et al., 2006; Carey et al., 2007b; Laffont et al., 2017). Our study
is unique in using a 4 day allergic airway inflammation model to
specifically study the role of innate immune cells on airway
inflammation. Our data show that 5a-DHT decreased ILC2 cyto-
kine expression and Rora mRNA expression in mice, but had no
effect on Gata3 mRNA expression. It is currently unclear if
androgen receptor signaling transcriptionally or post-transcrip-
tionally regulates ILC2 proliferation and cytokine production.
Since Rora mRNA expression was decreased with the addition
of 5a-DHT, these data suggest a transcriptional regulation of
testosterone on ILC2 function. However, additional studies are
needed to determine if AR signaling is transcriptionally or post-
transcriptionally regulating ILC2function.
While 5a-DHT had no effect on Gata3 mRNA expression in
ILC2 from mice, ILC2 from men with asthma as well as IL-2
plus IL-33-stimulated ILC2 from male mice had decreased
Gata3 expression compared to ILC2 from women with asthma
or female mice. Further, Gata3 expression was decreased in
ILC2 from male mice compared to female mice. ILC2 from
gonadectomized male mice administered 17b-E2 and P4 admin-
istration increased Gata3 expression compared to ILC2 from
gonadectomized male mice administered vehicle, suggesting
that estrogen and P4 are important in upregulating Gata3
expression in ILC2. These results show that 5a-DHT is important
in regulating proliferation and cytokine expression, but that
estrogen and P4 are important in regulating Gata3 expression.
We confirmed our in vitro findings in a physiologically relevant
Alt Ext challenge in vivo model of innate-immune mediated
allergic airway inflammation. Testosterone negatively regulated
allergic airway inflammation by intrinsically decreasing ILC2
numbers and IL-5+ or IL-13+ ILC2 cells, as shown in the mixed
bone marrow chimera experiments. Further, testosterone extrin-
sically regulated IL-5+ ILC2 and IL-13+ ILC2 by decreasing IL-33
and TSLP expression in the BAL fluid (Figures 5 and S6). IL-33
signaling through ST2 and TSLP signaling through the TSLP
receptor stimulate Alt-Ext-induced ILC2 airway inflammation.
Therefore, combined these results show that testosterone has
a dual mechanisms for regulating ILC2 production of IL-5 and
IL-13, by acting directly on the ILC2 as well as reducing the
release of IL-33 and TSLP.
Despite testosterone negatively regulating Alt-Ext-induced
IL-13+ ILC2, testosterone did not decrease mucus production.
Surprisingly,
ovarian
hormones
increased
Alt-Ext-induced
mucus production even though ovarian hormones did not
increase IL-13+ ILC2. Previous reports have shown that
estrogen, signaling through estrogen receptor-b, increased
MUC5AC expression and mucus production in cultured airway
epithelial cells (Tam et al., 2014), suggesting that sex hormones
may regulate mucus production through multiple pathways.
Our studies did not determine the mechanisms by which
2496
Cell Reports 21, 2487–2499, November 28, 2017
 ovarian hormones regulated ILC2-induced airway inflammation
nor take into account other cell types, including T cells, macro-
phages, and dendritic cells that sex hormones are known to
regulate (Fuseini and Newcomb, 2017). However, our results
did show that ovarian hormones increased Alt-Ext-induced
IL-5+ ILC2, eosinophils in the BAL, and mucus production.
Combined, these findings show that ovarian hormones and
testosterone have differential pathways of regulation and that
further analysis of how ovarian hormones regulate cytokine-
producing ILC2 in vivo is warranted.
ILC2 produce approximately 10-fold more IL-5 and IL-13
compared to CD4+ Th2 cells, and ILCs are critical for Th2 mem-
ory responses in the lung (Halim et al., 2014). ILC2 therapeutic
targets are actively being developed or ongoing in clinical trials
(Gauvreau et al., 2014). Therefore, defining the role of sex
hormones on ILC2-mediated airway inflammation is imperative
to effectively design future clinical trials and develop new thera-
peutic strategies for asthma and other ILC-mediated diseases.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Analysis of Circulating ILC2 in Men and in Women with Asthma and
in Healthy Controls
Healthy women and men as well as patients with moderate to severe asthma
(ages 18–45), as defined by the Severe Asthma Research Program and the
NHLBI guidelines, were recruited from the Vanderbilt University Medical Cen-
ter. Participants were excluded for any viral or bacterial symptoms 2 weeks
prior to blood draw. Women were also excluded if pregnant, breastfeeding,
taking hormonal contraceptive medications, taking estrogen replacement
therapy, menopausal, or if they had undergone an oophorectomy or a hyster-
ectomy. All participants were consented in accordance with Vanderbilt Univer-
sity’s Institutional Review Board policies. PBMCs were isolated from the
blood. The total volume of blood and the total number of PBMCs were re-
corded for each patient. Lin� cells were enriched using StemCell Technolo-
gies Human ILC2 Enrichment Kit. Fifty percent of the Lin� cells were surface
stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) anti-human Lineage cocktail
(Biolegend), FITC anti-CD123 (clone 7G3), FITC anti-FcεRI (clone AER-37
(CRA1), red Fluor 710 anti-CD45 (clone HI30), phycoerythrin (PE)-Cy7 anti-
CD127 (clone A019D5), PerCP-Cy5.5 anti-CD161 (clone HP-3G10), BV421
anti-CD25 (clone M-A251), and Alexa Fluor 647 anti-CD294 (clone BM16) an-
tibodies. Cells were fixed and permeabolized using the Foxp3/Transcription
Factor Staining Buffer Kit (Tonbo) and then intracellularly stained with PE
anti-Gata3 (clone TWAJ). The remaining 50% of cells were restimulated with
50 ng/mL PMA (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mg/mL ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and
0.07% GolgiStop (BD Biosciences) for 4 hr at 37�C in RPMI + 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). Restimulated Lin� cells were then surface stained, fixed, and
permeabolized as described above. Cells were then intracellularly stained
for PE-anti-IL-5 (clone JES1-39D10). Flow cytometry was conducted, and
ILC2 were defined as Lin� CD45+ CD127+ CD161+ CD25+ CRTH2+
Gata3+ or IL-5+ cells. All data were analyzed via FlowJo software.
Mice
WT BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories or bred
in-house. Veterinary staff at Charles River Laboratories operated on 3- to
4-week-old mice (sham surgery or gonadectomy). ARtfm (B6.Cg-Aw-J
EdaTa-6J +/+ ArTfm/J), congenic CD90.1+ B6 Thy1.1 (B6.PL-Thy1a/CyJ),
and WT C57BL/6 mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. Heterozy-
gous CD90.1+ CD90.2+ C57BL/6 mice were generated from breeding C57BL/6
mice with B6.PL-Thy1a/CyJ mice. For experiments, adult mice were greater
than 8 weeks old and pre-pubescent mice were 4 weeks old. Experiments
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Vander-
bilt University and conducted in accordance with the Care and Use of Labora-
tory Animals guidelines.
Sorting and Stimulation of Lung ILC2 from Mice
Lungs were extracted, homogenized, and digested into a single-cell suspen-
sion and counted. Lin� cells were enriched by negative selection as previously
described (Zhou et al., 2016). Lin� cocktail contained biotinylated antibodies
against CD3, CD5, CD11b, CD45R, 7-4, Gr-1, and Ter-119. Enriched Lin�
cells were blocked with an anti-FcR antibody (clone 2.4G2) and surface
stained with a lineage cell detection cocktail (Miltenyi), biotin-labeled anti-
CD3 (clone 17A2), APC anti-CD90 (clone 53-2.1), Alexa Fluor 700 anti-CD45
(clone 30-F11), APC anti-CD25 (clone PC61), and PE-Cy7 anti-CD127 (clone
A7R34) antibodies. FITC conjugated to streptavidin (1:1500 dilution) was
added following surface staining. ILCs, defined as Lin� CD45+ CD90+
CD127+ and CD25+ cells, were sorted by flow cytometry. All antibodies
were purchased from BD Biosciences, Biolegend, or eBiosciences unless
otherwise stated. Sorted lung ILCs from mice were plated at 2,000 cells/well
in 96-well round-bottom plates and stimulated with rmIL-2 (10 ng/mL) and
rmIL-33 (10 ng/mL) or rmIL-7 (10 ng/mL) and rmIL-33 (10 ng/mL) for
1–6 days. All recombinant proteins were purchased from Peprotech. In select
experiments, vehicle (methanol) or 5a-DHT (0.1–3 nM, Sigma-Aldrich) was
added at the time of stimulation.
Measuring ILC2 Proliferation and STAT5 Phosphorylation
A CellTrace Violet Cell Proliferation Kit was added to ILC2 at the time of stim-
ulation in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technolo-
gies). After 3 days in culture, ILC2 were stained with a viability dye (Tonbo),
blocked with an anti-FcR antibody (clone 2.4G2), and then surface stained
with biotinylated lineage cell detection cocktail, biotinylated anti-CD3 (clone
17A2), Alexa Fluor 488 anti-CD25 (clone PC61), PE-Cy5 anti-CD127 (clone
A7R34) antibodies, PerCp efluor 710 anti-ST2 (clone RMST2-2), and
PE-Cy7 anti-ICOS (clone C98.4A), followed by APC-Cy7 strepavidin staining.
CellTrace Violet was measured in ILC2, defined as Lin�, CD127+, CD25+,
ST2+, and ICOS+ cells. For Ki67 staining, ILC2 were harvested after
2 days of stimulation, surface stained as described above, fixed and perme-
abolized using a Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Kit (Tonbo), and
intracellularly stained with PE anti-Gata3 (clone TWAJ) and eFluor 450 anti-
Ki67 (clone SolA15). For STAT5 phosphorylation studies, ILC2 were stimu-
lated for 1 day, harvested, and stained for surface markers as described
above. ILC2 were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at
room temperature, permeabolized with methanol overnight at 4�C, and intra-
cellularly stained with PE anti-STAT5 (clone 47/Stat5[pY694]). STAT5 phos-
phorylation was then measured in ILC2 by flow cytometry. Just prior to
flow cytometry analysis, count beads (Invitrogen) were added in accordance
with the manufacturer’s protocol to determine total ILC2 number. Flow anal-
ysis was conducted on LSRII flow cytometer, and all data were processed
using FlowJo software.
Quantification of IL-5+ and IL-13+ ILC2 by Flow Cytometry
After 6 days in culture, ILC2 were collected and restimulated with 50 ng/mL
PMA (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mg/mL ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.07%
GolgiStop (BD Biosciences) for 4 hr at 37�C. ILC2 were then surface
stained, fixed, and permeabolized using the methods described in the
above section. ILC2 were then intracellularly stained with PE anti-gata3
(clone TWAJ), APC anti-IL-5 (clone TRFK5), and eFluor 450 anti-IL-13 (clone
eBio13A). Just prior to flow cytometry analysis, count beads (Invitrogen)
were added in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol to determine
total ILC2 number.
Cytokine Measurements
Cytokine levels were determined from BAL fluid or whole-lung homogenates
using the Duoset and the Quantikine ELISA Kits (R&D Systems) and following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Any value below the lower limit of detection
was assigned half the value of the lowest detectable standard.
qPCR
Total RNA was extracted from ILC2 using the RNeasy Micro Kit, and cDNA was
generated using 100 ng of total RNA. qPCR was conducted using TaqMan
primers purchased from Applied Biosystems. Data were reported as relative
expression normalized to the housekeeping gene Gapdh.

 Administration of Hormone Pellets to Mice
At 6–7 weeks of age, gonadectomized male BALB/c mice were subcutane-
ously implanted with 60-day slow-release pellets from Innovative Research
of America containing 5a-DHT(15 mg), 17b-E2 (0.1 mg), P4 (25 mg), or a
combination of 17b-E2 and P4 (25.1 mg) (Newcomb et al., 2015). As a con-
trol, vehicle pellets were surgically placed into sham-operated male, sham-
operated female, or gonadectomized male mice. Three weeks (21 days)
after pellets were implanted, ILCs were harvested from the lungs of mice,
sorted by flow cytometry, and stimulated with IL-33 and IL-2 as described
above.
In Vivo Alt Ext Challenge
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and challenged intranasally with 5 mg in
100 mL of Alt Ext or vehicle (PBS) for 4 consecutive days (Toki et al., 2016; Zhou
et al., 2016). At various time points after the last challenge, mice were
sacrificed.
Analysis of IL-5+ and IL-13+ ILC2 after Alt Ext Challenge Protocol
Lungs were harvested, digested, and single-cell suspensions were restimu-
lated with 50 ng/mL PMA, 1 mg/mL ionomycin, and 0.07% GolgiStop for 6 hr
at 37�C in RPMI + 10% FBS. Following restimulation, lung cells were stained
with the viability dye (Tonbo), blocked with an anti-FcR antibody (clone
2.4G2), and surface stained with biotin-labeled lineage cell detection antibody
cocktail (Miltenyi), biotin-labeled anti-CD3 (clone 17A2), BV786 anti-CD90.2
(clone 53-2.1), Alexa Fluor 700 CD45 (clone 30-F11), Alexa Fluor 488 anti-
CD25 (clone PC61), PE-Cy5 anti-CD127 (clone A7R34), PerCp efluor 710
anti-ST2 (clone RMST2-2), and PE-Cy7 anti-ICOS (clone C98.4A) antibodies,
followed by APC-Cy7 strepavidin staining (1:1500). Cells were then fixed
and permeabolized as described above and intracellularly stained with APC
anti-IL-5 (clone TRFK5) and eFluor 450 anti-IL-13 (clone eBio13A). Flow anal-
ysis was conducted on LSRII flow cytometer, and all data were processed
using FlowJo software.
Bronchoalveolar Lavage
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed by instilling 800 mL of saline
through a tracheostomy tube and then withdrawing the fluid with gentle suc-
tion through a syringe. Cells in the BAL fluid were fixed to a slide, stained,
and categorized as neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, or monocytes by
using standard morphologic criteria, as previously described (Newcomb
et al., 2012). Supernatants from BAL were used for analysis of cytokine
production.
Histopathology of Lungs
Lungs were perfused, inflated, and fixed in 10% buffered formalin overnight.
The lungs were transferred to 70% ethanol and then embedded in paraffin
blocks. Tissue sections (5 mm) were stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)
to assess mucous cell metaplasia as a measure of mucin expression. Slides
were examined and scored according to the following scale by a pathologist
who was blinded to the experimental groups: 0, no PAS-positive cells;
1, <5% PAS-positive cells; 2, 5% to 10% PAS-positive cells; 3, 10% to 25%
PAS-positive cells; and 4, >25% PAS-positive cells.
Bone Marrow Chimeras
6- to 10-week-old heterozygous CD90.1+ CD90.2+ C57BL/6 male recipient
mice were lethally irradiated (11 Gy) using a cesium irradiator. 2–3 hr following
irradiation, a 1:1 mixture of whole-bone marrow from age matched 6- to
10-week-old WT (CD90.1+) C57BL/6 male mice or ARtfm male mice
(CD90.2+) was transplanted into male CD90.1+ CD90.2+ C57BL/6 recipient
mice via retro-orbital injection. After 6 weeks of bone marrow engraftment,
recipient mice were challenged intranasally with 5 mg in 100 mL of Alt Ext or
vehicle (PBS) for 4 consecutive days. 24 hr after the last intranasal challenge,
lungs were harvested and restimulated as described above section. Following
restimulation, lung cells were stained with the viability dye (Tonbo), blocked
with an anti-FcR antibody (clone 2.4G2), and surface stained with biotin-
labeled lineage cell detection antibody cocktail (Miltenyi), biotin-labeled anti-
CD3 (clone 17A2), BV786 anti-CD90.2, BV510 anti-CD90.1, Alexa Fluor 488
anti-CD25, PE-Cy5 anti-CD127, PerCp efluor 710 anti-ST2, and PE-Cy7
anti-ICOS, followed by APC-Cy7 strepavidin staining (1:1,500). Cells were
then fixed and permeabolized as described above and intracellularly stained
with APC anti-IL-5 and eFluor 450 anti-IL-13. Flow analysis was conducted
on LSRII flow cytometer, and ARtfm (CD90.2) and WT (CD90.1) cytokine-pro-
ducing ILC2 were gated as Lin�, CD45+, CD127+, CD25+, ST2+, ICOS+, IL-5,
and/or IL-13+ cells. All data were processed using FlowJo software. Residual
cells remaining from the recipient mice (CD90.1+ CD90.2+) were excluded from
analysis.
Statistical Analysis
The p values were calculated using an unpaired Kruskall-Wallis test, the Mann-
Whitney U test, the Student’s t test, or a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post
hoc test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.
