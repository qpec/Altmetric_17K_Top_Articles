ABSTRACT 
 
Entrectinib, a potent oral inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases TRKA/B/C, ROS1, and 
ALK, was evaluated in two phase I studies in patients with advanced or metastatic 
solid tumors, including patients with active central nervous system (CNS) disease. Here, we summarize 
the overall safety and report the antitumor activity of entrectinib in a cohort of patients with tumors 
harboring  
NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 
, or  
ALK 
 gene fusions, naïve to prior TKI treatment targeting the specifi
 c 
gene, and who were treated at doses that achieved therapeutic exposures consistent with the recom-
mended phase II dose. Entrectinib was well tolerated, with predominantly Grades 1/2 adverse events 
that were reversible with dose modifi
 cation. Responses were observed in non–small cell lung cancer, 
colorectal cancer, mammary analogue secretory carcinoma, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma, as 
early as 4 weeks after starting treatment and lasting as long as >2 years. Notably, a complete CNS 
response was achieved in a patient with  
SQSTM1–NTRK1- 
rearranged lung cancer. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE: Gene fusions of  
NTRK1/2/3, ROS1, 
 and  
ALK 
 (encoding TRKA/B/C, ROS1, and ALK, 
respectively) lead to constitutive activation of oncogenic pathways. Entrectinib was shown to be well 
tolerated and active against those gene fusions in solid tumors, including in patients with primary or 
secondary CNS disease.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Recurrent gene fusions are oncogenic drivers of tumor 
growth and survival across a variety of malignancies ( 
1 
). 
Structurally, many of these fusions retain an intact tyro-
sine kinase domain fused to an upstream gene partner that 
promotes ligand-independent dimerization. The resultant 
chimeric oncoprotein initiates and sustains downstream 
signaling, resulting in tumor growth and proliferation ( 
2 
). As 
molecular profi
 ling of tumors continues to migrate toward 
more comprehensive platforms, such as DNA-based next-
generation sequencing and RNA-based anchored multiplex 
PCR, the number of these fusion events that are detectable in 
the clinic continues to rise substantially ( 
3, 4 
). 
 
Most importantly, a signifi
 cant proportion of recurrent 
gene rearrangements are clinically actionable. In patients 
with advanced  
ALK 
- and  
ROS1 
-rearranged non–small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC), three targeted therapies [crizotinib 
(Xalkori), ceritinib (Zykadia), and alectinib (Alecensa)] have 
been approved based on dramatic improvements in response 
rate and progression-free survival ( 
5–9 
). Beyond NSCLC,  
ALK
rearrangements have also been identifi
 ed in a variety of malig-
nancies, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma and renal 
cell, breast, esophageal, and colorectal cancers, as have  
ROS1
rearrangements in colorectal, gastric, and ovarian cancers, 
glioblastoma multiforme, and cholangiocarcinomas ( 
2 
). 
 
Similar to  
ALK and  
ROS1 
 rearrangements, recurrent gene 
fusions involving the genes  
NTRK1, NTRK2 
, and  
NTRK3 
 are 
actionable drivers of tumor growth ( 
10, 11 
). These genes 
encode the proteins TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, respectively, and 
play roles in neuronal development, cell survival, and cellular 
proliferation ( 
12 
). In the rearranged state, the activated fusion 
kinases signal through the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK, PI3K–AKT–
mTOR, and PLCγ–PKC pathways, driving the initiation and 
progression of malignancy. These fusions have been detected 
in a variety of tumors, including lung ( 
13 
), gastrointestinal 
( 
14–16 
), head and neck ( 
1 
), thyroid ( 
17–19 
), and spitzoid can-
cers ( 
20, 21 
), sarcomas ( 
22–24 
), primary brain tumors ( 
25–27 
), 
and acute myeloid leukemia ( 
28, 29 
). Although many of these 
events are found at a lower incidence in tumors such as lung 
and gastrointestinal cancers, they are found in the majority 
of rare tumors such as secretory breast carcinoma ( 
30 
), mam-
mary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC; refs.  
31, 32 
), 
and congenital infantile fi
 brosarcoma ( 
33 
), where the identi-
fi
 cation of an  
NTRK 
 fusion is a defi
 ning factor for diagnosis. 
 
The presence of recurrent gene fusions involving  
NTRK1, 
NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1 
, and  
ALK across different tumor 
histologies and the growing number of events that are 
detected in patient samples underscore the ongoing need 
for routine diagnostic testing to identify gene fusions.

Equally critical is the need for clinical trials that afford 
access to effective targeted agents regardless of histol-
ogy, in what is commonly referred to as a “basket” trial 
design. Phase I trials have rapidly evolved to meet this 
challenge, not only establishing the recommended phase 
II dose (RP2D) of a promising agent, but also providing 
meaningful effi
 cacy data in molecularly defi
 ned subsets 
of patients ( 
34 
). Here, we present the combined results of 
two phase I trials of entrectinib ( 
16 
), a highly potent, orally 
available, ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor with 
low- to sub-nanomolar enzymatic effi
 cacy against TRKA, 
TRKB, TRKC, ROS1, and ALK (IC 
50 
 values of 1.7, 0.1, 0.1, 
0.2, and 1.6 nmol/L, respectively; ref.  
35 
). Furthermore, the 
drug was specifi
 cally designed to cross the blood–brain bar-
rier in an effort to address both primary brain tumors and 
brain metastases in patients with  
NTRK1-, NTRK2-, NTRK3-, 
ROS1- 
, and  
ALK 
-rearranged cancers ( 
36 
). 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
Demographics 
 
Between October 2012 and March 2016, a total of 119 
patients with advanced solid tumors were treated with entrec-
tinib: 54 on ALKA-372-001 and 65 on STARTRK-1. The demo-
graphic features of these patients are summarized in  
Table 1 
. 
The median age was 55 years (range, 18–80 years). The majority of 
patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group perfor-
mance status (ECOG PS) of 0 to 1 (96%;  
n 
 = 114/119) and 
had received 3 or more prior treatments for their cancer (83%; 
 
n 
 = 98/119), including prior ALK/ROS1 inhibitors (27%;  
n 
 = 
32/119) and checkpoint inhibitors (3%;  
n 
 = 4/119). Patients 
with a wide range of solid tumors, including primary brain, 
head and neck, sarcoma, breast, melanoma, renal cell, and 
ovarian tumors, were treated. The most predominant tumor 
type was NSCLC (60%;  
n 
 = 71/119), followed by tumors of the 
gastrointestinal tract (15%;  
n 
 = 18/119). 
 
 
The 54 patients on ALKA-372-001 were treated on the 
following dosing schedules: 19 on Schedule A (fasted, 4 days 
on entrectinib and 3 days off entrectinib for 21 of 28 days), 29 
on Schedule B (fed, continuous daily dosing for 28 days), and 6 
on Schedule C (fed, 4 days on entrectinib and 3 days off entrec-
tinib for 28 days). All 65 patients on STARTRK-1 received 
continuous daily dosing with entrectinib (daily for 28 days). 
 
 
Safety Profi
 le 
 
The most common treatment-related adverse events of any 
grade were fatigue/asthenia (46%;  
n 
 = 55/119), dysgeusia (42%; 
 
n 
 = 50/119), paresthesias, (29%;  
n 
 = 34/119), nausea (28%;  
n 
 = 
33/119), and myalgias (23%;  
n 
 = 27/119;  
Table 2 
). The majority 
of treatment-related adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 in sever-
ity; all related adverse events were reversible with dose modifi
 ca-
tions. Dose reduction occurred in 15% ( 
n 
 = 18/119) of patients.

 Entrectinib in NTRK-, ROS1-, or ALK-Rearranged Cancers
RESEARCH ARTICLE
 
APRIL  2017�CANCER DISCOVERY | 403 
No dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were observed on ALKA-372-
001; two DLTs occurred on STARTRK-1 at a daily dose of 
800 mg: Grade 3 cognitive disturbance and Grade 3 fatigue, 
both resolved with dose interruption. At the 800 mg dose level, 
one additional patient experienced Grade 4 eosinophilic myo-
carditis, which was the only Grade 4 treatment-related adverse 
event reported on either study. This event occurred after two 
doses of entrectinib; the patient was subsequently discontin-
ued from the study and fully recovered from the event. No 
Grade 5 treatment-related adverse events were reported. 
 
 
There were no signifi
 cant differences in toxicity between 
patients who received intermittent dosing (Schedules A and 
C on ALKA-372-001) and continuous dosing (Schedule B on 
ALKA-372-001 and STARTRK-1) despite numerical differ-
ences between these two groups, such as a higher incidence 
of dysgeusia, increased blood creatinine, and weight increase 
in patients on continuous dosing. These are detailed in Sup-
plementary Table S1. 
 
The number of patients and treatment-related adverse events 
observed at each dose level on either trial are summarized 
in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3. A continuous dose of 
400 mg/m 
2 
 was designated as the body surface area (BSA)–
based RP2D based upon a review of safety and pharmacokinet-
ics (PK). Per protocol, the next dose tested was 800 mg (fi
 xed 
dosing), which resulted in two DLTs as described above; a 
continuous dose of 600 mg daily was then tested and identifi
 ed 
as the fi
 xed-dose MTD and RP2D in adults. The treatment-
related adverse events in patients who received entrectinib at 
the RP2D are summarized in Supplementary Table S4. 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
 
In the ALKA-372-001 study, Schedule A, when entrectinib 
was administered in the fasted state, exposure (C 
max 
 and AUC) 
appeared to increase in a dose-proportional manner across the 
dose range of 100 to 800 mg/m 
2 
 with no appreciable increase in 
exposure observed at higher doses of 1,200 or 1,600 mg/m 
2 
. In 
Schedules B and C, entrectinib exposure increased in a less than 
dose-proportional manner when it was coadministered with 
food. In the STARTRK-1 study, entrectinib was administered 
with food and exposure increased in a linear manner from 100 
to 400 mg/m 
2 
, and from 600 to 800 mg fl
 at dosing ( 
Fig. 1 
). 
Steady state was reached within 2 weeks of continuous dosing, 
with average accumulation of approximately 2-fold. The plasma 
half-life of entrectinib was estimated to be between 20 and 
22 hours and compatible with a once-daily, continuous dosing 
regimen (Supplementary Table S5). At the RP2D, the mean 
steady-state C 
trough 
 of 1,590 nmol/L was greater than 4-fold 
higher than that of trough concentrations observed in animal 
tumor models with complete tumor inhibition (corrected for 
plasma protein binding differences across species; refs.  
36, 37 
). 
 
 
 
Antitumor Activity 
 
Of the 119 patients treated on either trial, 60 had a gene rear-
rangement involving  
NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 
, or  
ALK 
. Of the remain-
ing 59 patients, 53 had other molecular alterations, broadly 
categorized as point mutations, amplifi
 cations, copy-number 
variants, or insertions/deletions, and 6 patients were enrolled 
without a known alteration of  
NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 
, or  
ALK 
 (Sup-
plementary Table S6). No objective responses (per RECIST 
v1.1; ref.  
38 
) were observed in patients whose tumors did not 
harbor gene fusions involving  
NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 
, or  
ALK 
, with 
the exception of 1 patient with an  
ALK 
F1245V  
 mutant neuro-
blastoma for whom a durable, confi
 rmed partial response (PR) 
lasted 8.3 months; this patient remained on study treatment 
for more than 3.5 years due to clinical benefi
 t. Furthermore, no 
responses were observed in the 25 patients with recurrent gene 
rearrangements involving  
ROS1 
 ( 
n 
 = 6) or  
ALK 
 ( 
n 
 = 19) who 
had previously received a ROS1 inhibitor (crizotinib) or ALK 
inhibitors (crizotinib, ceritinib, or alectinib), respectively, prior 
to entrectinib. Thirteen of the 19  
ALK 
 patients had received

more than one prior ALK inhibitor, including 2 patients who 
had received more than two prior ALK inhibitors. 
 
 
“Phase II–Eligible Population” 
 
Given that responses were observed only in TKI treatment–
naïve patients with a fusion involving  
NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 
, or 
 
ALK 
, the population that would serve as the focus of later-
phase development of entrectinib, an analysis was performed 
of patients treated on either phase I trial who met criteria for 
what was defi
 ned as a “Phase II–eligible population.” This 
included patients whose tumors harbored a recurrent gene 
fusion involving any of the 5 genes of interest, with a history 
of no prior TKI treatment targeting the fusion of interest, 
and who were treated on ALKA-372-001 or STARTRK-1 at 
doses that achieved therapeutic exposures consistent with the 
RP2D of 600 mg of entrectinib daily (Supplementary Fig. S1). 
 
Of the 60 patients with gene rearrangements, 5 patients 
were treated with doses that were below those which achieved 
therapeutic exposures consistent with the RP2D. Of the 
remaining 55 patients, 25 were previously treated with a TKI 
targeted to one of the fusions of interest (45%;  
n 
 = 25/55). For 
the purposes of this analysis, crizotinib was not considered 
a signifi
 cant inhibitor of TRKA/B/C (IC 
50 
 values of 580 and 
399 nmol/L toward TRKA and TRKB, respectively; ref.  
39 
), 
and 1 patient with an  
NTRK3 
 fusion who had received this 
drug in the past was classifi
 ed as “Phase II–eligible.” 
 
Of the resulting 30 patients comprising the “Phase II–eli-
gible” patient population as defi
 ned above, 25 patients were 
evaluable ( 
Table 3 
), of whom 24 patients had extracranial 
solid tumors and 1 patient had a glioneuronal tumor. The 
waterfall plot for the 24 patients with extracranial solid 
tumors is shown in  
Fig. 2 
. In three  
NTRK1/2/3 
-rearranged 
advanced solid tumors with RECIST-measurable disease, the 
objective response rate (ORR) was 100% [95% confi
 dence 
interval (CI): 44–100]. These included patients with NSCLC 
( 
SQSTM1–NTRK1 
; ref.  
40 
), MASC ( 
ETV6–NTRK3 
; ref.  
31 
), 
and colorectal cancer ( 
LMNA–NTRK1 
; ref.  
16 
). An additional 
patient with a  
BCAN–NTRK1 
-rearranged glioneuronal tumor 
experienced stable disease by RECIST, but further analysis 
via three-dimensional volumetric assessment demonstrated a 
60% reduction in total tumor burden ( 
41 
). This radiographic 
response was accompanied by a clinical response to therapy 
with diminished ataxia and diplopia. 
 
 
 
In 14  
ROS1 
-rearranged solid tumors, the ORR was 86% 
(95% CI: 60–96). These confi
 rmed responses included 2 complete 
responses (CR). With the exception of 1 patient with a  
GOPC–
ROS1 
-rearranged melanoma, all other patients who responded 
had  
ROS1 
-rearranged NSCLC. In seven  
ALK 
-rearranged solid 
tumors, the ORR was 57% (95% CI: 25–84), and responses 
were observed in  
ALK 
-rearranged NSCLC, renal cell carci-
noma, and colorectal cancer. 
 
Initial responses to entrectinib were demonstrated within 
Cycle 1 (scans performed at 4 weeks) or Cycle 2 (scans per-
formed at 8 weeks). Responses to entrectinib therapy were also 
durable, with the longest duration of clinical benefi
 t observed 
in a patient with  
ROS1 
-rearranged lung cancer who remains on 
therapy at 32 months as of the data cutoff date ( 
Fig. 3 
). Recog-
nizing that different tumor types were treated, the median dur-
ation of response for  
ROS1 
- and  
ALK 
-rearranged cancers was 
17.4 months (95% CI: 12.7–not reached) and 7.4 months 
(95% CI: 3.7–not reached), respectively. For the 3 respond-
ing patients with  
NTRK 
-rearranged cancers, the durations 
of response were 2.6 months, 4.6 months, and 15.1 months 
(patient ongoing as of data cutoff date), respectively. 
 
 
With a median duration of follow-up of 15 months, a number 
of exploratory secondary endpoints were analyzed. Considering 
the variety of tumor types evaluated in this study, each with a 
different natural history, the median progression-free survival 
for patients harboring  
NTRK1/2/3- 
 ( 
n 
 = 4),  
ROS1 
- ( 
n 
 = 14), and 
 
ALK 
- ( 
n 
 = 7) rearranged malignancies was not reached (95% 
CI: 3.6–not reached), 19.0 months (95% CI: 6.5–not reached), 
and 8.3 months (95% CI: 4.6–12), respectively. Among all 25 
patients, the median overall survival has not been reached (95% 
CI: 19 months–not reached). The proportion of patients surviv-
ing at 12 months was 89.4% (95% CI: 75.5%–100%). 
 
 
Intracranial Activity 
 
Among the 25 evaluable “Phase II–eligible population,” 32% 
( 
n 
 = 8/25) of patients had known primary or metastatic disease 
involving the brain prior to treatment with entrectinib. Res-
ponses were noted in 5 of the 8 (63%) patients: 4 patients 
with  
NTRK1 
- ( 
n 
 = 1),  
ROS1 
- ( 
n 
 = 2), and  
ALK 
- ( 
n 
 = 1) rear-
ranged NSCLC and 1 additional patient with  
ALK 
-rearranged 
colorectal cancer; among the responders, 4 patients have had 
prior radiotherapy to the brain. Of note, the patient with 
 
SQSTM1–NTRK1 
-rearranged NSCLC had 15 to 20 brain metas-
tases identifi
 ed at baseline not previously irradiated; a complete 
intracranial response was achieved with entrectinib therapy 
that is ongoing at 15 months as of the data cutoff date (

DISCUSSION 
 
Here, we present a large multicenter safety experience in 119 
patients treated with the pan-TRK, ROS1, and ALK inhibitor 
entrectinib on two phase I trials. We demonstrated that the 
drug is safe and well tolerated. No responding patients discon-
tinued the study due to adverse events. The majority of treat-
ment-related adverse events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, and 
all were reversible with dose interruption and/or modifi
 cation. 
Dose reduction was required in only 15% of patients. Specifi
 c 
adverse events, such as dysgeusia, sensory neuropathy, cognitive 
changes, and weight gain, are thought to be on-target toxicities 
of entrectinib mediated by TRK receptor inhibition ( 
42 
). Forty-
fi
 ve patients were treated at the identifi
 ed RP2D of 600 mg daily 
with continuous dosing. Given that no signifi
 cant differences 
in toxicity were observed between continuous daily dosing and 
intermittent dosing schedules, continuous dosing was chosen 
due to its ability to enable 24-hour continuous exposures above 
those required for complete tumor inhibition in animal tumor 
models, resulting in sustained target inhibition. 
 
Entrectinib demonstrated robust antitumor activity in TKI-
naïve patients harboring gene rearrangements involving  
NTRK, 
ROS1 
, or  
ALK 
. Responses were fast and durable, and clinical 
benefi
 t was observed across a broad range of solid tumors 
regardless of histology, including NSCLC, MASC, melanoma, 
glioneuronal tumor, colorectal cancer, and renal cell carci-
noma. The majority of responses were observed within Cycle 1 
or 2, and several patients continued treatment beyond a year, 
with the longest response approaching 2.5 years as of the time 
of the data cutoff. Intriguingly, the responses in patients with 
 
NTRK 
-rearranged tumors are particularly notable, as these 
provide proof-of-principle that  
NTRK 
 rearrangements are clini-
cally actionable drivers of tumor growth. We thus strongly 
encourage that clinicians continue to test for these alterations

 Entrectinib in NTRK-, ROS1-, or ALK-Rearranged Cancers
RESEARCH ARTICLE

using comprehensive molecular profi
 ling platforms that are 
poised to identify these alterations, preferably with a strategy 
that combines testing at both the DNA level and, potentially, 
the RNA level, when feasible ( 
13 
). Although no responses were 
observed in patients with recurrent gene rearrangements who 
had previously received ROS1 or ALK inhibitors, further inves-
tigation will be required to determine the activity of this drug 
in TKI-pretreated patients, considering that the drug is active 
preclinically against potential resistance mutations, such as the 
 
ALK 
L1196M  
 mutation, that can emerge after crizotinib therapy in 
 
ALK 
-rearranged lung cancers. 
 
Of note, entrectinib showed promising antitumor activity in 
the central nervous system (CNS). This becomes particularly 
important when we consider that cancers that can harbor 
 
NTRK, ROS1, 
 or  
ALK 
 rearrangements such as lung cancers and 
melanomas have a proclivity for CNS metastasis. Moreover, 
many primary adult and pediatric brain tumors, such as astro-
cytoma, glioblastoma, and pediatric gliomas, harbor  
NTRK1, 
NTRK2, NTRK3 
, or  
ROS1 fusions ( 
10 
). On STARTRK-1, a CR 
was achieved in the brain in a patient with  
SQSTM1–NTRK1 
-
rearranged lung cancer with an ongoing response at 15 months 
at the time of the data cutoff ( 
40 
). Substantial reduction in 
disease burden was likewise noted by volumetric analysis in 
a  
BCAN–NTRK1 
-rearranged glioneuronal tumor ( 
41 
). These 
cases highlight the intracranial activity of entrectinib against 
both metastatic disease and primary brain tumors that can 
otherwise result in substantial morbidity and mortality. As 
has been observed in  
ALK 
-rearranged lung cancers, the use of 
a CNS-penetrant drug like entrectinib in the fi
 rst-line setting 
in patients with  
ROS1 
-rearranged lung cancers may potentially 
improve outcomes for patients compared with treatment with 
crizotinib, which is thought to be less CNS-penetrant. 
 
Lastly, these studies emphasize the utility of clinical trial 
strategies that focus on molecular enrichment independent of 
tumor histology as a model for the development of promising 
targeted therapies, especially in patients with rare genomic 
aberrations. Over the last decade, expansion cohorts on phase I 
trials have driven the accelerated approval of targeted therapies 
such as crizotinib for  
ALK 
- and  
ROS1 
-rearranged lung cancers 
( 
6, 34 
). The same model can potentially be applied to establish 
preliminary effi
 cacy across a variety of cancer types, especially 
as actionable drivers of interest such as  
NTRK 
 rearrangements 
are detected at a lower frequency across multiple histologies, 
precluding the ability to easily accrue histology-specifi
 c cohorts 
on ongoing trials. Later-phase clinical trials, so called “basket 
studies,” provide a complementary approach that utilizes this 
paradigm. For entrectinib, a global, multicenter, phase II bas-
ket study (STARTRK-2, NCT02568267) is currently accruing 
patients with  
NTRK-, ROS1-, and  
ALK- 
rearranged cancers with 
the intent of confi
 rming the results generated by STARTRK-1 
and ALKA. 
 
 
METHODS 
 
Patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring 
 
NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 
, or  
ALK 
 molecular alterations were enrolled in one 
of two phase I studies aimed at determining the MTD or RP2D of 
entrectinib: Study ALKA-372-001 (“ALKA”; EudraCT 2012-000148-88; 
2 sites, Italy) and Study RXDX-101-01 (“STARTRK-1”; NCT02097810; 
10 sites, United States, Korea, and Spain). Patients were enrolled in the 
ALKA study between October 2012 and November 2015, and in the 
STARTRK-1 study between July 2014 and February 2016, respectively. 
 
Study Design 
 
Patients were assigned sequentially to escalating dose levels of entrec-
tinib following a standard 3+3 design. All patients received entrectinib 
orally and remained on study treatment until disease progression (with 
allowance to remain on study if the treating physician deemed the 
patient as continuing to derive clinical benefi
 t), development of unac-
ceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Fasted and fed, BSA-based 
and fl
 at dosing, as well as intermittent and continuous daily dosing 
regimens were evaluated. Entrectinib was initially dosed by BSA (doses 
ranging from 100 mg/m 
2 
 to 1,600 mg/m 
2 
) and later transitioned to 
fl
 at dosing (doses ranging from 600 mg to 800 mg). In addition, inter-
mittent dosing regimens were evaluated in addition to once-daily, 
continuous dosing. In the ALKA study, patients were enrolled across 
three dosing regimens: Schedule A (fasted, 4 days on/3 days off for 3 of 
4 weeks), Schedule B (fed, continuous daily dosing), and Schedule 
C (fed, 4 days on/3 days off). In the STARTRK-1 study, all patients 
received entrectinib on a fed, continuous daily dosing regimen (Sup-
plementary Fig. S2). Patients were enrolled into STARTRK-1 and ALKA 
Schedules B and C simultaneously after Schedule A was completed. 
 
On both studies, the starting dose was 100 mg/m 
2 
. At least 
3 patients at each dose level were monitored for DLTs through Cycle 
1 (day 28 for ALKA and day 42 for STARTRK-1). DLTs were defi
 ned 
as any Grade ≥2 CNS, Grade ≥3 nonhematologic, Grade ≥3 and/or 
lasting >7 days hematologic (as well as febrile neutropenia) toxicities 
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE; v4.03). Failure to recover 
(except alopecia) to Grade ≤1 or baseline after delaying the initiation 
of next cycle by a maximum of 14 (ALKA) or 28 (STARTRK-1) days 
was also considered a DLT. Patients were eligible for DLT evaluation 
if they experienced a DLT after at least one dose of study drug or did 
not experience a DLT having taken a minimum of 75% (ALKA) or 
80% (STARTRK-1) of doses expected during Cycle 1. Patients who did 
not fulfi
 ll these requirements or who discontinued the study prior to 
completing the DLT evaluation period were to be replaced. The MTD 
was defi
 ned as the highest dose associated with fi
 rst-cycle DLT in 
<33% of patients. If an MTD was not reached, RP2D was to be 
selected based on available safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacody-
namics data from different dose levels and dosing regimens tested. 
 
 
Study Population 
 
All patients had a histologically or cytologically confi
 rmed diagnosis 
of relapsed or refractory advanced/metastatic solid tumor for which 
no alternative effective standard therapy was available or for which 
standard therapy was considered unsuitable or intolerable, ECOG PS 
≤2, a life expectancy of ≥3 months, and adequate organ function. 
Patients with stable asymptomatic CNS involvement were eligible. 
 
TRKA/B/C, ROS1, or ALK molecular alterations were detected via 
immunohistochemistry, FISH, or RNA/DNA-based methods [e.g., 
next-generation sequencing (NGS), NanoString] performed at the 
various local institutions or through third-party commercial diag-
nostic providers. 
 
Institutional Review Boards and/or ethics committees of all partici-
pating institutions approved the study, which was conducted accord-
ing to the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on 
Harmonisation, and the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Data 
were anonymized to protect the identities of subjects involved in the 
research. All patients provided written informed consent. 
 
 
Safety Assessments 
 
Safety was assessed from the fi
 rst dose until 30 days after the last 
dose of entrectinib or until the resolution or stability of any drug-
related toxicity. Clinical and laboratory assessments were performed 
on June 3, 2019. © 2017 American Association for Cancer Research.

at least once weekly during the fi
 rst two cycles of treatment: 
weekly and biweekly after ≥1 year of treatment (ALKA) or biweekly 
(STARTRK-1), at the end of treatment visit, and approximately 28 
to 30 days after discontinuing study drug. Laboratory assessments 
included routine hematology and chemistry panels, coagulation 
parameters, and urinalysis. Twelve-lead single ECGs 
 (triplicate in 
STARTRK-1) were obtained at baseline and around the anticipated 
maximal and steady-state entrectinib plasma concentrations (e.g., 
between 3 and 6 hours after dose) with time-matched PK samples 
(various time points on Cycles 1 through 4), at the end of treatment 
visit, as well as whenever clinically indicated, to assess for potential 
QTc changes as a result of treatment with entrectinib. 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
 
Depending on dosing regimens, serial blood samples for PK analy-
ses were obtained at various time points throughout Cycle 1. Samples 
were shipped frozen to Accelera (ALKA) and InVentiv (STARTRK-1) 
for analysis of entrectinib (and its metabolites) using a validated 
liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry assay. PK analy-
sis for all parameters was performed using Phoenix WinNonlin 
software (version 6.4.0.768; Pharsight Corporation). Parameters ana-
lyzed included maximum observed plasma concentration (C 
max 
) and 
minimum observed plasma concentration (C 
24h 
), time of maximum 
observed plasma concentration (T 
max 
), effective half-life (t 
1/2 
), and 
area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC). 
 
Pharmacodynamics 
 
For all patients who provided consent, archival tumor tissue, if 
available, was submitted for retrospective and/or additional explora-
tory genomic profi
 ling. Tissue (if clinically feasible) and blood at 
the time of progression in addition to monthly blood samples were 
collected to gain insights into potential mechanisms of resistance. 
Molecular alteration status of the  
NTRK1/2/3, ROS1 
, and  
ALK 
 genes, 
among others, was collected in nucleic acids isolated from plasma 
using NGS for future analyses. 
 
Tumor Assessments 
 
CT/MRI of the brain, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as clinically indi-
cated, were initially performed at the end of Cycle 2 and every 8 weeks 
thereafter. For both studies, a protocol amendment later modifi
 ed 
the fi
 rst assessment time point to the end of Cycle 1 and every 8 weeks 
thereafter. All scans were read locally and tumor response evaluated 
according to RECIST v1.1 ( 
38 
). 
 
 
Statistical Analysis 
 
Patients who received at least one dose of entrectinib were 
included in the effi
 cacy and safety analyses, irrespective of molecu-
lar alteration. In addition, patients with evidence of a gene fusion 
were analyzed as a subset. Demographics, baseline characteris-
tics, adverse events, vital signs, and clinical laboratory evaluations 
were summarized with descriptive statistics. Objective response was 
defi
 ned as confi
 rmed CR or PR that persisted on repeat imaging ≥4 
weeks after initial documentation of response. ORR was calculated 
as the proportion of responders out of the population of patients 
with measurable disease at baseline. The Kaplan–Meier method was 
used to estimate the median, 25th, and 75th percentiles for time-
to-event endpoints (duration of response, progression-free survival, 
and overall survival), with corresponding 95% CIs. The data cutoff 
date for safety and effi
 cacy analyses for both studies was September 
20, 2016.
