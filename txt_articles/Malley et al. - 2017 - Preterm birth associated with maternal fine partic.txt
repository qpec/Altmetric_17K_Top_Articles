Reduction of preterm births (b37 completed weeks of gestation) would substantially reduce neonatal and infant
mortality, and deleterious health effects in survivors. Maternal fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure has been
identified as a possible risk factor contributing to preterm birth. The aim of this study was to produce the first es-
timates of ambient PM2.5-associated preterm births for 183 individual countries and globally. To do this, national,
population-weighted, annual average ambient PM2.5 concentration, preterm birth rate and number of livebirths
were combined to calculate the number of PM2.5-associated preterm births in 2010 for 183 countries. Uncertainty
was quantified using Monte-Carlo simulations, and analyses were undertaken to investigate the sensitivity of
PM2.5-associated preterm birth estimates to assumptions about the shape of the concentration-response function
at low and high PM2.5 exposures, inclusion of provider-initiated preterm births, and exposure to indoor air
pollution.
Globally, in 2010, the number of PM2.5-associated preterm births was estimated as 2.7 million (1.8–3.5 million,
18% (12–24%) of total preterm births globally) with a low concentration cut-off (LCC) set at 10 μg m−3, and
3.4 million (2.4–4.2 million, 23% (16–28%)) with a LCC of 4.3 μg m−3. South and East Asia, North Africa/Middle
East and West sub-Saharan Africa had the largest contribution to the global total, and the largest percentage of
preterm births associated with PM2.5. Sensitivity analyses showed that PM2.5-associated preterm birth estimates
were 24% lower when provider-initiated preterm births were excluded, 38–51% lower when risk was confined to
the PM2.5 exposure range in the studies used to derive the effect estimate, and 56% lower when mothers who live
in households that cook with solid fuels (and whose personal PM2.5 exposure is likely dominated by indoor air
pollution) were excluded. The concentration-response function applied here derives from a meta-analysis of
studies, most of which were conducted in the US and Europe, and its application to the areas of the world
where we estimate the greatest effects on preterm births remains uncertain. Nevertheless, the substantial per-
centage of preterm births estimated to be associated with anthropogenic PM2.5 (18% (13%–24%) of total preterm
births globally) indicates that reduction of maternal PM2.5 exposure through emission reduction strategies
should be considered alongside mitigation of other risk factors associated with preterm births.

1. Introduction
Preterm birth (at b37 completed weeks of gestation) is a ‘major
cause of [postnatal] death and a significant cause of long-term loss of
human potential’ (Howson et al., 2012). There is a substantial long-
term health impact from preterm birth due to increased risk both of
death and of developing a wide range of chronic physical and neurolog-
ical disabilities compared to full term births (Blencowe et al., 2013b;
Calkins and Devaskar, 2011; Howson et al., 2012; Loftin et al., 2010;
Rogers and Velten, 2011). Liu et al. (2015) calculated that there were
965,000 deaths due to preterm birth complications globally in 2013, ac-
counting for 35% of all neonatal deaths (b27 days after birth) and 15% of
all deaths of children under 5. High preterm birth rates have been calcu-
lated for both high and low-income countries (Blencowe et al., 2012).
Behrman and Butler (2007) estimated that preterm birth had an eco-
nomic impact of $26.2 billion in the US in 2005 ($51, 600 per preterm
birth).
It is estimated that in 2010, 11.1% of the 135 million livebirths glob-
ally (14.9 million babies) were preterm, including both spontaneous
and provider-initiated preterm births; preterm birth rates in countries
vary between 4 and 5% in some European countries and 15–18% in

 some countries in Africa and South Asia (Blencowe et al., 2012). Sponta-
neous preterm birth is associated with multiple risk factors, including
maternal age (young and old), multiple pregnancy (twins etc.), infec-
tion, previous preterm births, psychological health (e.g. depression)
and social and personal/lifestyle factors such as poverty, maternal edu-
cation, prenatal care, physical activity, diet, and alcohol and drug con-
sumption (Behrman and Butler, 2007; Blencowe et al., 2013a; Gravett
et al., 2010).
Maternal exposure to ambient concentrations of fine particulate
matter (total mass of particles with an aerodynamic diameter
b2.5 μm, PM2.5) has also been identified as a risk factor for preterm
birth (as reviewed in Shah et al., 2011), as well as for other related out-
comes, such as low birth weight (e.g. Holstius et al., 2012; Rich et al.,
2015). For example, significant associations between PM2.5 exposure
and preterm birth were detected in prospective cohort studies in Cana-
da (Brauer et al., 2008) and China (Qian et al., 2016), in retrospective
studies conducted in the US (Ha et al., 2014; Huynh et al., 2006) and
China (Fleischer et al., 2014), and in a ‘natural experiment’ in the US
(Parker et al., 2008). Proposed mechanisms for the effect of PM2.5 on
the risk of preterm birth include oxidative stress, pulmonary and pla-
cental inflammation, coagulopathy, endothelial dysfunction and hemo-
dynamic responses (Kannan et al., 2006; Shah et al., 2011), and recently
Nachman et al. (2016) showed a significant relationship between PM2.5
exposure and intrauterine inflammation (IUI), that has been shown to
increase the risk of preterm birth (Kemp, 2014). Exposure to PM2.5 is
spatially heterogeneous, with annual average PM2.5 concentrations
varying by an order of magnitude between rural areas of e.g. Europe,
and urban areas in India and China (Kamyotra et al., 2012; Putaud et
al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015). However, to date, no study has either
assessed the implications of these differences in PM2.5 exposure for
the frequency of preterm births, or calculated the total number of pre-
term births that are associated with maternal exposure to elevated am-
bient PM2.5 exposure globally.
Here, we present the first global estimates of ambient PM2.5-associ-
ated preterm births, calculated using data for 183 countries. We used
the relationship between PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy and fre-
quency of preterm births from the meta-analysis of Sun et al. (2015),
because it was derived through the integration of studies conducted in
Latin America, Asia and Africa, as well as North America and Europe.
The odds ratio (OR) was combined with country-level population-
weighted ambient PM2.5 concentration estimates developed for the
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2013 study (Brauer et al., 2016), in
order to provide an estimate of exposure consistent with the GBD anal-
ysis, which calculated that 2.9 million premature deaths, primarily in
older people, were associated with ambient PM2.5 exposure globally
(Forouzanfar et al., 2015). Finally, the number of preterm births in 183
countries was taken from a global analysis for 2010 (Blencowe et al.,
2012). Uncertainty in these estimates was quantified using Monte-
Carlo simulations. We also assess the contributions of anthropogenic
versus natural fractions of ambient PM2.5 to quantify the extent to
which reductions in anthropogenic PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursor emis-
sions could reduce the PM2.5 risk factor associated with preterm birth.
The impact of PM2.5 on the frequency of preterm birth is further
assessed in the context of spontaneous versus provider-initiated pre-
term births, and the contribution of household air pollution and
smoking as other sources of maternal PM2.5 exposure.
2. Methods
Calculation of the country, regional (GBD regional groupings shown
in Fig. S1) and global cumulative incidence of preterm birth associated
with PM2.5 exposure (i.e. PM2.5-associated preterm births) requires a re-
lationship linking PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy to preterm birth
frequency, as well as the number of livebirths, the preterm birth rate,
and maternal PM2.5 exposure for each country (estimated here using
annual mean population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations as a proxy).
The most recent year for which all these variables were available was
2010. The change in cumulative incidence of preterm birth associated
with PM2.5 exposure (i.e. PM2.5-associated preterm births) using the
input variables was calculated using Eq. (1), which is based on a logistic
model, and was selected because the coefficient (β) can be calculated
directly from the OR using Eq. (2) (RTI International, 2015).

The odds ratio (OR) used (OR: 1.13 (95% confidence intervals (CI):
1.03–1.24) for a 10 μg m−3 change in PM2.5 exposure) was derived in
Sun et al. (2015) by meta-analysis of 13 studies. The majority of studies
included in the Sun et al. (2015) meta-analysis adjusted for potential
confounders that have previously been identified as risk factors for the
incidence of preterm birth, including socioeconomic status/poverty,
maternal smoking, race/ethnicity (Goldenberg et al., 2008; Muglia and
Katz, 2010). However, the number of confounders adjusted for varied
between studies. Table S1 summarises, for each of the studies included
in the Sun et al. (2015) meta-analysis, the potential co-varying risk fac-
tors that were adjusted for. This relationship is similar (within confi-
dence intervals) to the relationship derived in three other meta-
analyses (Lamichhane et al., 2015; Sapkota et al., 2012; Zhu et al.,
2015), see Table S2.
National, population-weighted annual average ambient PM2.5 con-
centrations were those derived by Brauer et al. (2016), who adjusted
the average of satellite and modelled gridded PM2.5 concentrations
using a global calibration model to optimise the fit to measurements
at over 4000 surface monitoring sites. Brauer et al. (2016) then associat-
ed gridded PM2.5 concentrations with population data to derive popula-
tion-weighted PM2.5 concentrations for each country in addition to
confidence intervals accounting for uncertainty in the grid cell PM2.5 es-
timates and calibration methods. Population-weighted PM2.5 concen-
trations derived in Brauer et al. (2016) are shown in Fig. S2.
The number of livebirths (LB) and preterm births estimated by
Blencowe et al. (2012) were used for the 183 countries. Blencowe et
al. (2012) compiled data on preterm births from national registries, na-
tional surveys and peer-reviewed literature and then estimated the
number of preterm births based on the prevalence of different predictor
variables in that country, with confidence intervals estimated using
bootstrap methods. For each country, the baseline frequency of preterm
birth (y0) was the ratio of preterm births to livebirths calculated in
Blencowe et al. (2012). Fig. S3 shows the preterm birth rate estimated
by Blencowe et al. (2012) for the 183 countries.
For each country, the number of PM2.5-associated preterm births
was calculated using Eq. (1). This value was also expressed as the per-
centage of all preterm births (as reported in Blencowe et al. (2012)).
These calculations were repeated assuming different low concentration
cut-off (LCC) ‘counterfactual’ ambient PM2.5 exposures below which the
excess risk of preterm birth was assumed to be zero. ΔX in Eq. (1) was
the change in PM2.5 concentration relative to a LCC (i.e. the difference
between national population-weighted PM2.5 concentration and the
LCC). The LCC was set at 10 μg m−3 (the WHO air quality guideline
(AQG) for PM2.5 (WHO, 2006)), and 4.3 μg m−3 (the lowest popula-
tion-weighted PM2.5 concentration of any country). The number of
PM2.5-associated preterm births estimated using different LCCs reflect
the uncertainty in the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and
174

 preterm births at low concentrations, due to the relatively fewer people
exposed to lower PM2.5 concentrations in those studies used to derive
the Sun et al. (2015) OR (25th percentile PM2.5 exposure varied be-
tween 6.3 and 19.7 μg m−3 for those studies included in Sun et al.
(2015) that reported this statistic). We also used an LCC set at
0 μg m−3 as a sensitivity analysis to provide an upper bound to PM2.5-
associated preterm birth estimates assuming that the relationship be-
tween PM2.5 and the frequency of preterm birth extends to zero. Further
work is required to determine the shape of the concentration-response
function at low PM2.5 concentrations, including the existence and level
of a threshold for effect.
Monte Carlo simulations were used to derive uncertainty estimates
associated with each PM2.5-associated preterm birth value. Normal dis-
tributions for each of the input variables to Eq. (1) were constructed
using the confidence intervals reported in Brauer et al. (2016) for pop-
ulation-weighted PM2.5 concentrations, in Blencowe et al. (2012) for
the preterm birth rate and in Sun et al. (2015) for the OR and hence co-
efficient β. One thousand values of each input variable were randomly
sampled from these distributions, and used to derive 1000 estimates
of PM2.5-associated preterm births in each country, from which 95%
confidence intervals were calculated. Confidence intervals in regional
and global estimates of PM2.5-associated preterm births were calculated
through 1000 random samples from the normal distribution of PM2.5-
associated preterm births in each country in the region. The contribu-
tion from uncertainty in each input variable to the total uncertainty in
PM2.5-associated preterm births was investigated by repeating the cal-
culations three times, setting to zero the uncertainty in two of preterm
birth rate, population-weighted PM2.5 concentration and OR. To evalu-
ate the sensitivity of PM2.5-associated preterm births to the PM2.5 con-
centration estimate, the calculation was also repeated with a different
estimate of population-weighted PM2.5 in each country (derived from
gridded PM2.5 concentrations reported in van Donkelaar et al. (2015),
see Supplemental Information).
National, annual average, population-weighted PM2.5 concentra-
tions due to natural sources were calculated by associating gridded nat-
ural PM2.5 concentrations, derived from GEOS-Chem chemical transport
model (CTM) simulations (Bey et al., 2001) with zero anthropogenic
emissions, with the Gridded Population of the World v3 dataset (Bey
et al., 2001; CIESIN, 2005). Natural PM2.5 was mainly composed of desert
dust, but also included contributions from sea-salt, biogenic organic
aerosol, natural sources of secondary inorganic aerosol (sulphate, ni-
trate and ammonium), as well as biomass burning. The anthropogenic
PM2.5 fraction was calculated using Eq. (3), and the anthropogenic
PM2.5 concentration (calculated by multiplying the population-weight-
ed total PM2.5 from Brauer et al. (2016) by the anthropogenic PM2.5 frac-
tion), was used as ΔX in Eq. (1). The population-weighted natural PM2.5
fraction in each country was used as the LCC, in order to estimate the
number of preterm births associated with only anthropogenic PM2.5.

The calculation of national, regional and global PM2.5-associated pre-
term births was then repeated to assess the sensitivity of these esti-
mates to key assumptions. In the first sensitivity analysis, PM2.5-
associated preterm births were estimated for spontaneous preterm
births only, with the number of spontaneous preterm births for each
country estimated from the average proportion calculated for each
Human Development Index (HDI) category of countries to which each
country was assigned (Morisaki et al., 2014). In the second sensitivity
analysis, PM2.5-associated preterm births were estimated for only
those livebirths to mothers who lived in households which do not use
solid fuels for cooking (to exclude those mothers whose exposure to in-
door air pollution is likely high). Hence the number of livebirths in each
country was multiplied by the proportion of the population in each
country not using solid fuels for cooking (estimated in Bonjour et al.
(2013)), and only these livebirths were included in the application of
Eq. (1). Finally, we applied Eq. (1) assuming no increase in the risk to
the cumulative incidence of preterm birth for PM2.5 concentrations
above 22.2 μg m−3, i.e. βΔX in Eq. (1) was fixed at the 22.2 μg m−3
value for PM2.5 concentrations above 22.2 μg m−3. This provided an as-
sessment of the effect of PM2.5 concentrations on the cumulative inci-
dence of preterm birth within the range of PM2.5 concentrations
participants included in the studies used to derive the Sun et al.
(2015) meta-analysis were exposed to, reflecting the uncertainty
about the shape of the concentration-response functions at exposures
above this value. The level of 22.2 μg m−3 was the maximum PM2.5 ex-
posure estimated in a large (N500,000 participants) cohort study in the
US (Krewski et al., 2009), in which the most consistent evidence for the
effect of PM2.5 on preterm birth has been derived. This PM2.5 concentra-
tion is consistent with maximum exposures reported in the US studies
included in the Sun et al. (2015) meta-analysis (Chang et al., 2015; Ha
et al., 2014; Huynh et al., 2006).
3. Results

3.1.1. Global and spatial distribution
In 2010, the global ambient PM2.5-associated preterm birth esti-
mates ranged from 2.7 million (95% CIs: 1.8–3.5 million) with a low con-
centration cut-off (LCC) of 10 μg m−3 to 3.4 million (2.4–4.2 million, 26%
higher) with a 4.3 μg m−3 LCC (Table 1). Regardless of the LCC, the larg-
est contribution to global PM2.5-associated preterm births was from
South Asia and East Asia, which together contributed 75%, and 65% of
the global total with 10 μg m−3 and 4.3 μg m−3 LCCs, respectively.
The West sub-Saharan Africa, and North Africa/Middle East regions
also contributed N5% of the global total regardless of LCC. The large con-
tribution of South and East Asia to global PM2.5-associated preterm
births was mainly due to PM2.5-associated preterm births in India and
China (1.1 million (0.3–1.8 million) and 0.5 million (0.1–0.7 million)

 respectively for the 10 μg m−3 LCC case) (Fig. S4, Table S3). In India, the
large number of PM2.5-associated preterm births resulted from elevated
values of all input variables (the range of values for each input variable
is shown in Table 2). For China, the preterm birth rate was relatively low
(in the bottom quartile), but the large number of livebirths and a popu-
lation-weighted PM2.5 concentration above the 98th percentile resulted
in the second largest contribution.
For the 10 μg m−3 LCC case, countries in the top 10% of national
PM2.5-associated preterm births accounted for 86% of the global total
(Table S3). These countries were in South, East and South East Asia,
sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East. There was substantial variation
in population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations between the top decile
countries. For some countries, maternal exposure was to relatively
moderate ambient PM2.5 concentrations (e.g. population-weighted
PM2.5 b 20 μg m−3: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia),
while in others the PM2.5 concentrations were among the highest calcu-
lated for any country (N30 μg m−3: Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Egypt,
Yemen, Nepal, Niger, Mali, Iraq, India and China), and there were
some intermediate cases (20–30 μg m−3: Nigeria, Sudan, Vietnam, Af-
ghanistan). Hence, the global number of ambient PM2.5-associated pre-
term births was not just dominated by countries with the highest
population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations, but countries with relative-
ly moderate annual average PM2.5 concentrations also contributed.
When the LCC was decreased, other countries with moderate PM2.5 con-
centrations, but large numbers of livebirths and relatively high preterm
birth rates (e.g. Indonesia, US, Brazil, Uganda) were included in the top
10% of countries, and made substantial contributions to the global total.
3.1.2. Percentage of total preterm births
Globally, 18% (12–24%) of all preterm births were associated with
PM2.5 for a LCC of 10 μg m−3. The countries with the largest percentage
of PM2.5-associated preterm births (i.e. above the 90th percentile of 30%
(Table 2)) were located in the South and East Asia, North Africa/Middle
East and West sub-Saharan Africa regions (Fig. 1a). Most of the coun-
tries with a larger proportion of PM2.5-associated preterm births had
relatively high population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations. For example,
5 of the 7 countries making up the East Asia and South Asia regions were
above the 90th percentile of 33 μg m−3 (Table 2), as were 8 of the 18
countries in North Africa/Middle East.
Decreasing the LCC to 4.3 μg m−3 increased the global percentage of
PM2.5-associated preterm births to 23% (16–28%). The percentage of
PM2.5-associated preterm births calculated for those countries with rel-
atively high population-weighted PM2.5 exposures were substantially
less sensitive to changes in the LCC (Fig. 1b and c). For example, in
India and China, population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations were 43.4
and 54.1 μg m−3, respectively, and decreasing the LCC to 4.3 μg m−3 in-
creased the percentage of PM2.5-associated preterm births by 14% in
India and 10% in China. In contrast, the percentage of PM2.5-associated
preterm births in those countries with moderate PM2.5 exposure
(b20 μg m−3, listed above) were on average 91% higher for the
4.3 μg m−3 LCC case compared to the 10 μg m−3 LCC case.
3.2. Anthropogenic PM2.5-associated preterm births
The anthropogenic fraction of national population-weighted ambi-
ent PM2.5, based on GEOS-Chem simulations, is shown in Fig. S5. For
South and East Asia, the majority of PM2.5 was anthropogenic (81 and
86% respectively). However, the value was smaller in other regions
with elevated total PM2.5-associated preterm births, e.g. in West sub-Sa-
haran Africa, and North Africa/Middle East, the median anthropogenic
fractions were both 21%.
Globally, 2.7 million (1.9–3.6 million) PM2.5-associated preterm
births were calculated when maternal exposure to only anthropogenic
ambient PM2.5 was considered (18% (13%–24%) of total preterm births
globally), which is 81% of the total PM2.5-associated preterm births
with 4.3 μg m−3 LCC, and comparable to that with 10 μg m−3 LCC
(Table 3). The contribution to this global total from West sub-Saharan
Africa and North Africa/Middle East was substantially lower compared
to total PM2.5-associated preterm births (4.3% and 2.1% of anthropogen-
ic PM2.5-associated preterm births, respectively, compared to 10.6% and
6.4% of total PM2.5-associated preterm births).
The median percentage of anthropogenic PM2.5-associated preterm
births (of all preterm births) was 5.1% for West sub-Saharan Africa,
and 6.2% for North Africa/Middle East, compared to 18.1–26.7% and
20.7–29.1% (range across different LCCs) respectively for total PM2.5-as-
sociated preterm births (Fig. 2 c.f. Fig. 1). In regions with high anthropo-
genic contributions to PM2.5 exposures, the spatial distribution of
anthropogenic PM2.5-associated preterm births was similar to total
PM2.5-associated preterm births. For example, countries in South and
East Asia had the highest anthropogenic PM2.5-associated preterm
births (Fig. 2), as well as the largest contributions to the global total
(Table S4).
3.3. Uncertainty
The uncertainty in the relationship between maternal PM2.5 expo-
sure and preterm births, as derived in Sun et al. (2015), contributed
the greatest uncertainty in the PM2.5-associated preterm birth esti-
mates. When the only uncertainty was in the OR, the uncertainty
range (2.5–97.5th percentiles) in the resulting global PM2.5-associated
preterm births decreased by 14% and 5% for the 10 μg m−3, and
4.3 μg m−3 LCC cases, respectively. In comparison, with uncertainty
only in the number of preterm births, the uncertainty range in global
PM2.5-associated preterm births decreased by between 61% and 64% de-
pending on the LCC. Finally, with uncertainty only in the Brauer et al.
(2016) population-weighted PM2.5 estimates included, the uncertainty
range for global PM2.5-associated preterm births decreased by between
93% and 94%. Using the alternative estimates of PM2.5 exposure (derived
from gridded PM2.5 concentrations from van Donkelaar et al. (2015)),
the global and regional estimates of PM2.5-associated preterm births,
were within the uncertainty range of the estimates derived using the
Brauer et al. (2016) population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations (see
Supplementary Information Table S8).

 4. Discussion
4.1. Spontaneous vs provider-initiated preterm births
The ambient PM2.5-associated preterm birth estimates (Table 1)
were calculated based on total national preterm births, including spon-
taneous and provider-initiated. The number of preterm births
calculated by Blencowe et al. (2012) were combined estimates due to
a lack of data on the proportion of each type of preterm birth in individ-
ual countries, which has recently been re-emphasised (Smid et al.,
2016). The majority of studies used to derive the Sun et al. (2015) OR
did not exclude provider-initiated preterm births. The inclusion in our
calculations of those provider-initiated preterm births for which PM2.5
exposure is not a risk factor may have resulted in higher estimates of
Fig. 1. Percentage of total preterm births which were associated with ambient PM2.5 in 2010 using a low concentration cut-off of a) 4.3 μg m−3, and b) 10 μg m−3.

 PM2.5-associated preterm births. However, the impact of their inclusion
may be limited as provider-initiated and spontaneous preterm births
are not independent, and the risk factors for each type increasingly
overlap (Joseph et al., 2002). Provider-initiated preterm births are also
linked to pregnancy complications, both maternal and fetal, including
severe pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, uterine rupture, cholestasis,
fetal distress and fetal growth restriction (Blencowe et al., 2013a).
Hence the increasing ability to detect these conditions has meant that
in settings with strong, well-resourced health systems, including good
diagnostics, providers now monitor these babies closely and initiate de-
livery of a compromised baby at the point when the risk of remaining
in-utero outweighs the risk of preterm delivery. In many cases, without
intervention, the fetal or maternal conditions would have resulted in a
stillbirth or spontaneous preterm birth at a later, but still preterm, ges-
tational age (Joseph et al., 2002).
Nevertheless, we assessed the sensitivity of PM2.5-associated pre-
term births estimates to exclusion of provider-initiated preterm births.
An analysis of almost 300,000 preterm births across 29 countries pro-
duced estimates of the average proportion of preterm births that were
provider-initiated in countries belonging to each Human Development
Index (HDI) group (Morisaki et al., 2014; UNDP, 2015). The average pro-
portions of provider-initiated preterm births were 40% in the Very High
HDI group, 38% for High, 22% for Medium, and 20% for Low, but there
was substantial variation between countries within the same HDI
group (Morisaki et al. 2014). An indication of the impact of exclusion
of provider-initiated preterm births on PM2.5-asssociated preterm
birth estimates was obtained by adjusting the Blencowe et al. (2012)
total preterm births in each country by the relevant HDI-average initiat-
ed preterm birth proportion. Globally, PM2.5-associated preterm births
decreased by 24% (Table 3), with these reductions varying by a factor
of 2 between regions (Table S5). The most conservative calculation of
PM2.5-associated preterm births, using a low concentration cut-off of
10 μg m−3 and excluding provider-initiated preterm births, resulted in
an estimated 2.0 million (1.4–2.6 million) PM2.5-associated preterm
births in 2010, equivalent to 13% (9.4–17.4%) of all preterm births
(Table S5).
4.2. Sources of PM2.5 exposure
WHO REVIHAAP (2013) recommend quantification of long-term
health-relevant PM as the total mass concentration (annual average),
and the GBD studies report mortality associated with total PM2.5, includ-
ing both anthropogenic and naturally-derived PM2.5 (Brauer et al.,
2016). However, emission reduction strategies aimed at reducing ambi-
ent PM2.5 concentrations (e.g. to attain the WHO air quality guideline of
10 μg m−3) are largely limited to the anthropogenic sources of PM2.5
and precursor emissions (Viana et al., 2008). Additionally, reduction in
PM2.5 concentrations through reduction in anthropogenic emissions
during ‘natural experiments’ has been associated with reduction in ad-
verse pregnancy outcomes, including the frequency of preterm birth,
for example during the 2008 Beijing Olympics (Rich et al., 2015), and
following the closure of a steel mill in Utah, US (Parker et al., 2008).
Hence the number of PM2.5-associated preterm births calculated using
anthropogenic population-weighted PM2.5 represents an estimate of
the reduction in the PM2.5 risk factor for preterm birth that could be
achieved from implementing PM2.5 and PM2.5-precursor emission strat-
egies. In the majority of regions, including those with the largest esti-
mates of PM2.5-associated preterm births, i.e. South and East Asia, the
anthropogenic PM2.5 fraction dominated, indicating that the majority
of the PM2.5 preterm birth risk factor could be mitigated from
implementing emission control strategies in these regions. The excep-
tions were countries in North Africa/Middle East, and west Sub-Saharan
Africa, for which the dominant PM2.5 fraction was the natural compo-
nent. The substantial percentage of preterm births that we calculate
are associated with anthropogenic PM2.5 indicates that reduction of ma-
ternal PM2.5 exposure should be considered alongside mitigation of
other risk factors associated with preterm births.
Additionally, the majority of studies (including most of those used to
derive the Sun et al. (2015) OR) which have calculated significant asso-
ciations between maternal PM2.5 exposure and preterm birth have been
conducted in regions where the anthropogenic PM2.5 fraction domi-
nates (i.e. North America, Europe, China, Fig. S5). Evidence that the nat-
ural PM2.5 fraction contributes to the PM2.5 preterm birth risk factor
remains more limited. The number of PM2.5-associated preterm births
calculated using total population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations
(0 μg m−3 LCC) and anthropogenic population-weighted PM2.5 there-
fore represent estimates for scenarios where all PM2.5 is a risk factor as-
sociated with preterm birth, and only the anthropogenic component is a
risk factor, respectively. The sensitivity of PM2.5-associated preterm
birth estimates to exclusion of natural PM2.5 was relatively low for
those regions where the anthropogenic PM2.5 fraction dominates, but
much higher for North Africa/Middle East, and west Sub-Saharan Africa
(N70% reduction in estimated PM2.5-associated preterm births for these
regions when only the anthropogenic fraction was included). Further
study of the association between preterm birth and PM2.5 exposure in
regions with dominant natural PM2.5 fractions is required to assess the
Fig. 2. Percentage of total preterm births which were associated with anthropogenic ambient PM2.5 only in 2010.
178

 similarity of the effect to that in those regions where the anthropogenic
PM2.5 fraction dominates.
In addition to ambient PM2.5, household air pollution (quantified as
e.g. solid fuel use or PM2.5 concentration) has been identified as an addi-
tional risk factor associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, includ-
ing preterm birth (Amegah et al., 2014; Patelarou and Kelly, 2014).
The studies used to derive the Sun et al. (2015) OR did not adjust for
household PM2.5 exposure. The majority of these studies were conduct-
ed in North America, Europe and Australia where the confounding effect
of household air pollution is likely to be low due to the small fraction of
the populations using solid fuels (b5% in 2010 (Bonjour et al., 2013)).
However, in Fleischer et al. (2014), data from countries in Latin America,
Africa and Asia were integrated to calculate the association between
preterm birth and PM2.5 exposure. In these regions a substantially larger
fraction of the populations use solid fuels (77% and 61% in Africa and
South East Asia in 2010 (Bonjour et al., 2013)). Household air pollution
is therefore a potential additional contributor to maternal PM2.5 expo-
sure not accounted for here, and in those countries with substantial
populations using solid fuels, it may be a significant, additional risk fac-
tor for preterm birth. In these regions, indoor air pollution sources may
dominate overall personal PM2.5 exposure for those mothers living in
households where there are substantial indoor PM2.5 emissions. There-
fore, the sensitivity of the global ambient PM2.5-associated preterm
birth estimates to the inclusion of livebirths to mothers living in house-
holds that cook with solid fuels was evaluated by calculating ambient
PM2.5-associated preterm births including only those mothers living in
households that do not cook with solid fuels in each country (i.e. by
multiplying total livebirths in each country by the proportion of the na-
tional population not using solid fuels for cooking, as estimated by
Bonjour et al. (2013)). Ambient PM2.5-associated preterm birth esti-
mates for only mothers living in non-solid fuel burning households
was 43–45% of the total PM2.5-associated preterm birth estimates de-
scribed in Section 3 (Table 3). As expected, the greatest reduction in pre-
dicted PM2.5-associated preterm births was in sub-Saharan Africa and,
to a lesser extent, in South East Asia, where use of solid fuels for cooking
is greatest. However, even assuming that only mothers in households
that do not burn solid fuels are affected by ambient PM2.5, these results
still indicate that ambient PM2.5 is a substantial global risk factor for pre-
term birth (i.e. estimates of PM2.5-associated preterm births to mothers
in non-solid fuel burning households were 7.5–10.1% of total preterm
births globally, depending on the LCC).
Similarly, maternal smoking is an additional source of PM2.5 expo-
sure which has also been linked to preterm birth, and between 11 and
13% of women in a subset of high-income countries were estimated to
smoke during pregnancy (Ion and Bernal, 2014). However, the majority
of studies used to derive the Sun et al. (2015) OR (7 out of 10) did adjust
for maternal smoking. In addition, in middle and low-income countries
the prevalence of smoking for women in general is substantially lower,
and on average 4% and 3% of women in middle and low-income coun-
tries, respectively, were estimated to smoke (WHO, 2015). Hence in
those regions where the largest number of preterm births associated
with ambient PM2.5 exposure was estimated, the confounding effect of
PM2.5 exposure from maternal smoking is likely to be small.
4.3. Application of Sun et al. (2015) odds ratio
In this work, the Sun et al. (2015) OR was applied globally to esti-
mate PM2.5-associated preterm births, assuming transferability to all re-
gions and across the range of population-weighted annual average
PM2.5 concentrations. The Sun et al. (2015) OR was mainly derived
from studies in North America (7 of 13 studies) and Europe (2 studies),
but it also included studies conducted in other regions (an Australian
study and a study covering 22 countries in Latin America, Africa and
Asia (Fleischer et al. (2014)). However, the OR for preterm birth derived
in Fleischer et al. (2014) across the 22 countries was not statistically sig-
nificant (OR: 0.96 (0.90–1.02) for a 10 μg m−3 increase in PM2.5).
Sun et al. (2015) identified significant heterogeneity in the studies
used to derive the OR applied here. By conducting additional meta-anal-
yses using only a subset of the 13 studies, Sun et al. (2015) identified
sources of this heterogeneity to include the method of exposure assess-
ment, the study location (US and non-US studies), and the type of study
(retrospective or prospective). However, significant heterogeneity
remained in the majority of these additional meta-analyses that
combined a subset of the studies, indicating that there were addi-
tional, unidentified sources of heterogeneity that require additional
epidemiological studies to investigate.
One of the tests of heterogeneity conducted by Sun et al. (2015) split
studies conducted in the US from those outside the US; the resulting OR
for the latter showed no significant effect of ambient PM2.5 exposure on
the cumulative incidence of preterm birth (OR: 0.95 (0.95–1.01) for a
10 μg m−3 increase in PM2.5 based on 5 non-US studies). Sun et al.
(2015) note that this result may be due to the small number of studies
(5) included in this meta-analysis, and emphasise the need for addition-
al studies in other regions to assess the consistency of effect in other re-
gions compared to US studies. There was also no qualitative difference
in studies conducted in and outside the US in the confounders that
were considered (Table S1).
Since the cut-off date for inclusion in Sun et al. (2015) (December
2014), we have identified 10 studies that have quantified the effect of
ambient total PM2.5 exposure on preterm birth (Table S7). Six of these
studies showed a significant effect of entire pregnancy PM2.5 on preterm
birth risk, while 8 showed a significant effect over some gestational win-
dow. The three studies conducted outside of North America (two retro-
spective analyses in Madrid, Spain, and a prospective study in Wuhan,
China) showed significant relationships between PM2.5 exposure and
preterm birth (Arroyo et al., 2016a, 2016b; Qian et al., 2016). Despite
the significant relationships detected in these three studies conducted
outside the US, the small number of studies conducted outside the US
limits assessment of the transferability of the Sun et al. (2015) OR to
other regions of the world. We therefore reemphasise the conclusion
of Sun et al. (2015) on the need for additional studies in other regions,
especially China, where only one study has been published since Sun
et al. (2015), and India, and Asia and Africa generally, where the largest
burdens have been estimated. Additional studies in these regions would
allow for a substantially more comprehensive assessment of the global
applicability of the OR derived in Sun et al. (2015) than is currently pos-
sible with the suite of studies published to date.
We also identified 25 studies that have assessed the effect of PM10
(PM2.5 plus coarse particulate matter) on the cumulative incidence of
preterm birth. Of these, 15 detected a significant relationship, including
3 studies in the US (Ritz et al., 2000; Sagiv et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2011),
and 12 studies outside the US in China (Jiang et al., 2007; Qian et al.,
2016; Zhao et al., 2015), South Korea (Leem et al., 2006; Suh et al.,
2009; Yi et al., 2010), Australia (Hansen et al., 2006), Uruguay (Balsa
et al., 2016), and Europe (Candela et al., 2013; Schifano et al., 2016,
2013; van den Hooven et al., 2012). However, other studies in the US
(Le et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2013; Pereira et al., 2016; Salihu et al., 2012;
Wilhelm and Ritz, 2005), Europe (Capobussi et al., 2016; Dibben and
Clemens, 2015; Hannam et al., 2014), and China (Huang et al., 2015)
did not detect a significant association.
Evidence of transferability of the Sun et al. (2015) meta-analysis to
other regions is provided by comparison with ORs calculated using
data from China in Fleischer et al. (2014) (OR: 1.11 (1.04–1.17) for a
10 μg m−3 increase in PM2.5 exposure), and Qian et al. (2016) (OR:
1.06 (1.04–1.10)), in which annual average PM2.5 exposures were up
to approximately 100 μg m−3. Fleischer et al. (2014) also estimated
the effect of PM2.5 exposure on preterm birth in India, where the expo-
sure range was greater than in other countries, but the effect here was
non-significant (OR: 0.96 (0.91–1.03) for a 10 μg m−3 increase in
PM2.5). However, for China, the ORs calculated in these studies were
within the uncertainty bounds of the Sun et al. (2015) OR (1.03–1.24).
Table S6 also shows that the confidence intervals of PM2.5-associated
179
C.S. Malley et al. / Environment International 101 (2017) 173–182
 preterm births estimated using the Sun et al. (2015) OR span the num-
ber of PM2.5-associated preterm births estimated using the Fleischer et
al. (2014), and Qian et al. (2016) ORs. This indicates that the Sun et al.
(2015) OR is transferable to China, and also relevant to PM2.5 exposures
up to the maximum Brauer et al. (2016) national population-weighted
annual average PM2.5 concentration of 66 μg m−3, including other coun-
tries in South and East Asia where the percentage of PM2.5-associated
preterm births was estimated to be high.
We also applied the Sun et al. (2015) OR varying linearly across the
range of national population-weighted PM2.5 exposures estimated by
Brauer et al. (2016). As outlined above, locally derived ORs for China, de-
rived across substantially higher PM2.5 exposures, provided estimates of
PM2.5-associated preterm births that are consistent with those derived
using the Sun et al. (2015) ORs applied in this way. However, there is ev-
idence for some health outcomes (e.g. premature mortality due to is-
chemic heart disease and stroke) that the relationship with PM2.5
exposure is steeper at lower PM2.5 concentrations, and tends to level
off at higher concentrations (Burnett et al., 2014; Pope et al., 2015). A
lower increase in risk at higher concentrations would reduce estimates
of PM2.5-associated preterm births in those regions with highest PM2.5
exposure. We assessed the sensitivity of our PM2.5-associated preterm
birth estimates to this assumption by repeating the calculations assum-
ing no additional risk above 22.2 μg m−3 (the highest concentrations es-
timated for the US where most consistent evidence for an effect of PM2.5
on preterm birth is available). The change in global PM2.5-associated
preterm birth estimates under this assumption was a 38–51% reduction,
depending on LCC. The greatest reduction in PM2.5-associated preterm
births was in East and South Asia (57–67%, and 49–59% reduction, re-
spectively), followed by North Africa/Middle East (30–40% reduction),
where highest ambient PM2.5 exposures were estimated. Conversely
there was almost no change in PM2.5-associated preterm birth estimates
in Europe, North America and Latin America. This sensitivity analysis is
conservative as significant levelling off of risk estimates for other health
outcomes occurs at much higher PM2.5 concentrations (Burnett et al.,
2014). However, even when the effect of PM2.5 on preterm birth is
only quantified within the range of exposures experienced by mothers
in the studies used to derive the OR, the resulting global PM2.5-associat-
ed preterm birth estimates indicate it to be a substantial risk factor for
preterm birth (9–14% of total preterm births globally) that should be
considered alongside other risk factors when considering effective strat-
egies to reduce the incidence of preterm birth.
Finally, there is also uncertainty in the shape of the concentration-
response function at low PM2.5 exposures, as substantially fewer
mothers were exposed to low concentrations (below ~5 μg m−3) com-
pared to more moderate concentrations in the studies used to derive the
Sun et al. (2015) OR. To reflect this uncertainty, we therefore estimated
PM2.5-associated preterm births with two LCCs, set at 4.3 and
10 μg m−3. However, to provide an upper bound to estimates of
PM2.5-associated preterm births, we repeated the analysis with a LCC
set at 0 μg m−3, i.e. assuming the entire range of PM2.5 concentrations
contributes to the overall burden of ambient PM2.5 on preterm birth.
Globally, PM2.5-associated preterm birth estimates were 34% higher
than for the 10 μg m−3 case (Table 3) (3.9 million (2.9–4.9 million)),
equivalent to 26% (19–33%) of total preterm births. The relative increase
in PM2.5-associated preterm births for the 0 μg m−3 LCC case was
greatest in those regions with relatively low PM2.5 concentrations, in-
cluding Latin America and the Caribbean, and North America.
5. Conclusions
The estimated 14.9 million annual preterm births globally have been
identified as a major global health issue due to their substantial contri-
bution to neonatal and infant mortality, and the long-lasting health ef-
fects in survivors. An identified potential risk factor associated with
preterm birth is maternal exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy. Esti-
mates of global PM2.5-associated preterm births varied, ranging
between 2.7 million (1.8–3.5 million) when the low PM2.5 concentra-
tion cut-off was set at 10 μg m−3 (18% (12–24%) of global preterm
births), to 3.4 million (2.4–4.2 million) with a 4.3 μg m−3 cut-off (23%
(17–19%)). The majority of the PM2.5-associated preterm births oc-
curred in South and East Asia, as well as North Africa/Middle East and
West sub-Saharan Africa, due to above average PM2.5 exposures,
livebirths and preterm birth rates. Despite the uncertainties in our esti-
mates, they clearly show that maternal PM2.5 exposure is a potentially
substantial global risk factor associated with preterm birth. Global Bur-
den of Disease studies have identified the global significance of PM2.5
exposure for premature mortality, but our analysis emphasises the im-
portance of also considering its contribution to effects in utero that
lead to increased postnatal mortality and lifetime morbidity. Efforts
aimed at reducing the frequency of preterm births should therefore con-
sider reduction of maternal exposure to PM2.5 alongside mitigation of
other identified preterm birth risk factors.
