A comprehensive feline health survey was conducted to reveal breed-specific inheritable 
diseases in Finnish pedigree cats for genetic research. Prevalence of 19 disease catego-
ries and 227 feline diseases were defined in a study population of 8175 cats belonging 
to 30 breeds. Dental and oral diseases, with a prevalence of 28%, and dental calculus 
and gingivitis (21 and 8%, respectively) were the most prevalent disease category and 
diseases among all cats and in most of the breeds. An exception was Korats, which were 
more often affected by the diseases of the respiratory tract (23%) and asthma (19%). 
Other prevalent disease categories affected various organ systems, such as the skin 
(12%), the urinary system (12%), the digestive tract (11%), eyes (10%), the musculoskel-
etal system (10%), and genitals of female cats (17%). Prevalent health or developmental 
issues included repetitive vomiting (4%), tail kink (4%), feline odontoclastic resorption 
lesion (4%), urinary tract infections (4%), as well as cesarean section (6%) and stillborn 
kittens (6%) among female cats. We found 57 breed-specific conditions by Fisher’s
exact tests and logistic regression analyses, including 32 previously described and 19 
new breed-specific diseases. The genetic defect has already been found in six of them: 
polycystic kidney disease, progressive retinal atrophy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 
three types of tail malformations. Behavioral profiling revealed breed-specific traits, such 
as an increased human avoidance in British Short and Longhairs and a higher level of 
aggression in Turkish vans. Our epidemiological study reveals the overall health profile in 
Finnish pure and mixed breed cats and identifies many breed-specific conditions without 
molecular identity for genetic research.

The annotation of the cat genome, in 2007, has facilitated genetic research with novel genomic 
resources (1, 2). Pedigree cats form appropriate populations for genetic studies, since each breed 
represent a group of genetically similar animals that descended from few ancestors (3). It has been 
estimated that 85% of all current breeds have arisen only in the past 75 years, largely due to inten-
tional breeding to influence esthetic qualities (4). There are over 40 officially approved cat breeds 
according to The Cat Fanciers’ Association1 (CFA), whereas The International Cat Association2

(TICA) accepts about 60, and the Finnish Cat Association3 
(Suomen Kissaliittory) – 44 registered breeds.
The cat is the most common pet in Europe, with an estimated 
100 million domesticated cats (5). In Finland, there is a cat in 
every seventh household, comprising almost 600,000 cats in 
360,000 households (6). The non-pedigree domestic cat forms 
the most common group, while Ragdolls lead the pedigree group, 
according to the Finnish Cat Association registry.
Over 300 genetic diseases have been described in cats, of which 
~70% are potential models for human diseases (7). Currently, over 
55 genes have been found in various traits (7). A commercial DNA 
test is available for >10 inherited feline diseases (2). Examples 
of these are the test for polycystic kidney disease (PKD1) (8), 
which is common in Persian and Exotic breeds, and the tests for 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) (9, 10). In addition, over 
20 mutations associated with uncommon feline diseases have 
been localized (2). However, the molecular background of many 
conditions remains unsolved.
A growing biobank of cats with over 4000 samples has been 
established in our laboratory at the University of Helsinki to 
facilitate feline genetic research and to identify genetic causes of 
breed-specific inherited diseases and behavioral traits. Toward 
this aim, a comprehensive owner-completed health survey was 
developed to explore the overall health profiles in pedigree and 
non-pedigree cats. Besides general information of the cat and their 
living environments, the health survey comprises questionnaire 
data, covering altogether 227 feline diseases as well as data on 
behavioral traits, vaccination, clinical examinations, and possible 
gene tests.
The present study analyzes the survey-based health profiles 
in 8175 Finnish cats to identify common and breed-specific 
conditions. Traits that are enriched in a particular breed or 
phylogenetic group suggest genetic susceptibility and could be 
prioritized for sample recruitment. The comprehensive health 
profiling provides useful data not only for genetic research but 
also for feline breeding programs and veterinary epidemiology. 
The survey data inform key health issues in different breeds to 
guide future research focus and feline biobanking activities.

study Design and Questionnaire
A cross-sectional online feline health survey (Presentation S1 in 
Supplementary Material) was established to collect information 
about Finnish cats. Besides data on various disorders, breed-
specific behavior, living habits (including diet, outdoor activity, 
contacts with other animals, and hunting), and reproductive fit-
ness were collected in the questionnaire. The survey was targeted 
at all Finnish cats, including pedigree and non-pedigree domestic 
cats. Owners were allowed to also report deceased cats.
The cat breeders and owners were informed about the survey 
in several ways, including advertisements by the Finnish Cat 
breed Association, social media such as Facebook, and by sharing 
information bulletins in different cat shows and meetings of the 
3 http://www.kissaliitto.fi/
breed clubs. Numbers with the set breed target numbers of sub-
mitted responses were published regularly in the research group’s 
website4 and Facebook site to encourage participation.
The minimum sample size required for each breed to estimate 
disease prevalence was calculated using Epitools calculator (11) 
and taking into account the annual registration numbers over 
the past 10 years (2001–2011) by the Finnish Cat Association. To 
maximize the required sample size for significance, we assumed 
50% disease prevalence, which is the most difficult to detect (12). 
Closely related breeds were grouped together, if there were not 
enough cats within a breed to reach the minimum sample size 
requirement.
The questionnaire was divided into 25 sections, which covered 
basic information about the cat, its owner, possible offspring, 
living environment, feeding manners, personality and personal 
habits, and possible genetic and clinical tests, such as ultrasound, 
vaccination records, and health status, with respect to each 
disease category. The sections used in this study are described in 
more detail. The basic information of the cat included the breed, 
registration number (registered in the Finnish Cat Association, 
TICA, or CFA), date of birth, and possible death, gender, and birth 
control status (castration, hormone implant, or contraceptive pill 
combined). There were 19 disease categories (1) behavioral traits, 
(2) congenital developmental disorders, (3) dermatological/
glandular diseases, (4) ocular diseases, (5) otic diseases, (6) dental 
and oral diseases, (7) diseases of the urinary system, (8) disorders 
of the cardiac and circulatory system, (9) blood disorders, (10) 
diseases of the musculoskeletal system, (11) diseases of the diges-
tive tract, (12) diseases of the respiratory tract, (13) diseases of the 
nervous system, (14) genital diseases, (15) endocrine and meta-
bolic diseases, (16) autoimmune diseases, (17) tumors (including 
benign tumors and cancers), (18) parasites and protozoans, and 
(19) diseases not mentioned in the previous categories. In all these 
categories, the participant was asked to report whether a given 
diagnosis was (1) made by a veterinarian, (2) made by the owner, 
(3) no such diagnosis was made, or (4) this was unknown. There 
were altogether 227 different diagnoses in the disease categories, 
varying from 3 to 27 per category.
The questions concerning the cat’s personality covered general 
activity, contact with people, aggressiveness toward strangers, 
family members, or other cats, sensitivity toward new situations 
or unfamiliar people, and possible compulsions, such as licking.
Multiple and incomplete responses were removed from the 
survey data. If the cat had been reported to belong to a certain 
breed, but the registration number was not given, the registra-
tion number was requested from the owner, the Finnish Cat 
Association, or searched on the internet. If the registration num-
ber was not available, the pedigree cat was moved into a special 
group, “Others,” as a separation from the verified pedigree and 
non-pedigree cats. The same procedure was used to investigate 
the dates of birth, which were missing or apparently wrong (the 
given date of birth was after the date of response or after date of 
death). If the date could not be verified, it was left missing.

The ages of the living cats were counted as a difference between 
the date of response and the date of birth converted to years. 
For deceased cats, the age of death was similarly counted as a 
difference between the date of death and the date of birth. Five 
age groups were created: (1) <1 year, (2) 1 to <3 years, (3) 3 to 
<7 years, (4) 7 to <11 years, and (5) ≥11 years. The variable “Age” 
was determined as either the age of the living or the age of the cat 
at death. Also, a new variable “
Alive/dead,” representing whether 
the cat was alive or dead, was created. Distributions of age, sex, 
alive/dead cats, and neutered/non-neutered cats were computed 
for all cats and in each breed. Before commissioning the final 
health survey, a pilot study was performed on Norwegian Forest 
cats (N = 604) (13) to test the content, usability, and advertise-
ment strategies of the questionnaire.
Prevalence estimates
Prevalence with 95% confidence intervals were used to express: 
(a) the number of cats having had disease/diseases belonging to a 
disease category (n = 19), and (b) the number of cats having had a 
separate disease (n = 227). In addition to the entire study popula-
tion, prevalence were also determined for each breed and for sub-
groups of age, sex, neutered/non-neutered cats, and alive/dead 
cats. Prevalence of genital diseases were counted in subgroups 
of female or male cats depending on the disease. Phylogenetic 
grouping was used in tabulating disease prevalence (4, 14). In 
the prevalence tables, coloring (green = low, yellow = moderate 
and red = high prevalence) was used to point out the differences 
between breeds and categories. Prevalence in disease categories 
were counted in three ways: (1) combining diagnoses by vet-
erinarian and owner, (2) diagnoses by veterinarian solely and (3) 
diagnoses by owner solely. Prevalence in separate diseases were 
also tabulated by breed to find the most common diseases in the 
breed.
Breed specificity
The breed-specific diseases were tentatively deducted from the 
prevalence of the diseases. The disease was considered breed-
specific, if the prevalence of the disease (according to coloring 
mentioned above and prevalence remainder) distinctly differed 
(upwards) in one or a few breeds from other breeds among all 
cats and in subgroups of sex, age, alive/dead cats, and neutered/
non-neutered cats. If the disease was found to be breed-specific, 
according to prevalence, it was tested using the Fisher’s exact 
test to verify the breed specificity compared with other pedigree 
cats (combined) and non-pedigree cats. The p-values < 0.05 of 
the Fisher’s exact test were considered to indicate statistically 
significant difference, and, thus, potential breed specificity of the 
disease. No correction for the error rate α for false significance in 
multiple testing (15) was performed, as breed specificity analyses 
were aimed for preliminary information, which were later con-
trolled in a logistic regression analysis.
In addition, for each tentative breed-specific disease, a logistic 
regression analysis with random intercept variable “Breed” 
was performed to observe the effect of the breed in acquiring 
the disease (Model 1). The model also included variables “Age” 
(reference group “3 to <7 years”), “Sex,” and “
Alive/dead” as fixed 
(level 1) independent explanatory variables to control the effect 
of these variables. The effect of “Breed” was measured by the 
median odds ratio (MOR) (16), which was counted from variance 
δ2 of the random variable “Breed.” MOR expressed (in this study) 
the MOR between a cat of a higher prevalence and a cat with a 
lower prevalence, when the cats with the same covariates were 
randomly chosen from two different breeds.
A logistic regression analysis was also performed without 
the random variable “Breed” (Model 2) in order to compare the 
goodness of fit between models 1 and 2. An evidence ratio (17) 
was used in the comparison. Furthermore, logistic regression 
analysis was performed with “Breed” included as a fixed variable 
(Model 3). In this model, each breed, which was suspected to be 
overrepresented compared with other breeds (as determined by 
the intercept of the breed in Model 2), formed a separate category. 
Non-pedigree cats formed their own category, and the rest of the 
breeds were combined to one category and set to a reference 
group. The purpose of Model 3 was to display the effects of the 
overrepresented breeds in acquiring the disease by odds ratios 
(OR). OR indicated how much higher the odds were in the breed/
breeds that were suspected to be prone to disease than in the other 
breeds.
The models were basically built from the entire study popula-
tion included, but, to assess the effect of the non-pedigree cats 
in heterogeneity of breeds (MOR), they were also built from a 
population of which non-pedigree cats were excluded. In some 
diseases, separate age groups or non-pedigree cats had to be 
excluded because of too few or no cases in the group. In such 
cases, the exclusion was executed in all three models to retain the 
goodness of fit comparability with Akaike Information criterion 
(AIC), which requires equal data sets (17). In genital diseases, the 
models were built from subgroups of female or male cats, and, 
for female cats, non-pedigree cats were excluded. The models 
were tested for interactions. If an interaction was detected, the 
MOR, evidence ratio, and OR of overrepresented breeds yielded 
from Models 1–3 with the interaction added were compared with 
corresponding values yielded from models without interactions 
included, to find out whether the interaction had any effect on 
these measures.
Median odds ratio and evidence ratios were used to evaluate 
the breed specificity of the disease. MOR always has values greater 
or equal to one. The closer to one the MOR was, the less hetero-
geneity there was between the breeds. The evidence ratio, in turn, 
indicated how many times more likely Model 1 was to be the best 
model as compared with Model 2, according to AIC values (18). 
Since the smaller value of AIC indicated better goodness of fit in 
terms of Kullback–Leibler discrepancy (19), the evidence ratio 
was counted only in cases when the AIC value of Model 1 was 
smaller. Otherwise, Model 2 was considered the better model, 
and the breed was interpreted not to improve the model.
Neither MOR nor the evidence ratio has any distinct cut point 
(threshold), which would designate that variable “Breed” had had 
a significant effect in acquiring the modeled disease (16, 17). In 
case of low value of the evidence ratio (<10) and a high value of 
MOR, the deduction of breed specificity was based on the whole 
entity of the data concerning the disease. In this deduction, in 
addition to MOR and the evidence ratio, the number of diseased 
cats, the distribution of the disease among all breeds, and the effect

of non-pedigree cats in the model were used. According to the 
results of the logistic regression analysis and previous studies, the 
suspected breed-specific disease were divided into four groups: 
diseases with (1) established heredity, (2) known breed-specific 
conditions, (3) breed specificity suspected by our study for the 
first time, and (4) breed specificity not verified in our study.
In Turkish Vans and breed groups of Cymric–Manx and 
Persian–Exotic, there were several cats of which the date of death 
was before 2005 (indicating a low possibility of these cats having 
lived at the same time as the alive cats of our study). To eliminate 
potential bias caused by deceased cats far in the past, the main 
results of logistic regression analyses concerning these breeds 
were verified in a subgroup in which cats died before January 
1st, 2005 were excluded as well. Furthermore, in Cornish Rexes, 
Korats, Sphynxes, Bengals, Turkish Vans, and Europeans, more 
than 15% of the cats were associated with the same breeder. In 
potential breed-specific diseases, the prevalence were also counted 
excluding these breeders to check the effect of the breeder.
Behavioral Traits
Owners were asked to rate behavior at five levels in the ques-
tionnaire (“not at all,” “a little,” “quite a bit,” “often,” and “very 
often”), and a binary variable was created using, in case of vari-
ables concerning aggressiveness and licking, combined levels 
“often” and “very often,” and in case of variables concerning 
sensitivity, level “often” to form the first category, while the 
rest of the levels together formed the reference category. In 
the case of variables “activity” and “takes contact with people,” 
combined levels “not at all” and “a little” were used as the 
extreme features, forming the first category. Prevalence with 
95% confidence intervals were computed and tabulated in a 
similar way to the diseases and Fisher’s exact tests and logistic 
regression were used in the analysis to verify behavioral dif-
ferences between breeds.
statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed by SAS version 9.3, SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC, USA. Proc Freq statement with chisq and 
fisher options was used in testing differences and association in 
categorical data. Proc Npar1way statement with Wilcoxon option 
(producing Kruskal–Wallis test) was used in (not normally 
distributed) continuous data. Proc Logistic and Proc Glimmix 
statements were used in logistic regression analysis in testing 
breed specificity of the diseases.

Demographics of the survey Data
A total of 8873 survey responses were collected, of which 8175 
responses were accepted for statistical analyses after quality 
control (Figure 1). The data were accumulated from 29 different 
breeds and non-pedigree cats. When the small phylogenetically 
related breeds with few cats were grouped together, the study 
included 13 breeds, 6 breed groups (16 breeds), and non-pedigree 
cats. The largest populations were non-pedigree cats (N = 1545), 
Abyssinian–Ocicat–Somali group (N = 539), Siamese–Balinese–
Oriental–Seychellois group (N = 468), and the Cornish Rex breed 
(N = 437). The sample size for the Cymric–Manx breed remained 
incomplete with 15 missing responses from the set breed target, 
and the results should, therefore, be considered only directional 
in this breed (Table 1).
The overall study population included more female (53%) 
than male cats (47%) (chi square p < 0.0001) (Data Sheet S1 in 
Supplementary Material). Also, there were more neutered (72%) 
than non-neutered cats (27%), and more alive (86%) than dead 
cats (12%) (p < 0.0001 between both subgroups). The mean age 
of the cats was 5.4 years. The ages of alive and dead cats (mean 
4.9 and 9.3 years, respectively), female and male cats (mean 5.6 
and 5.2 years, respectively), and neutered and non-neutered 
cats (mean 6.5 and 2.4 years, respectively) differed significantly 
(p < 0.0001 of Kruskal–Wallis test between each group). The 
proportions of alive and dead cats did not differ significantly 
in subgroups of male and female cats, but significantly more in 
male cats (78%) than female cats (67%), and living cats (77%) 
than dead cats (71%) were neutered (p < 0.001 between both 
subgroups) (data not shown).
There was significant variation in the age distribution in differ-
ent breeds (p < 0.0001 in both Kruskal–Wallis test for continuous 
ages and chi square test for age groups) (Figure 2 and Data Sheet 
S1 in Supplementary Material). For example, 30% of the Turkish 
vans, but less than 1% of the Sphynxes, belonged to the oldest 
age group of ≥11 years. The distributions of sex, alive/dead, and 
neutered/non-neutered cats varied considerably between breeds 
(p < 0.0001 for each). However, there was no significant differ-
ence in sex distributions (p = 0.1024), when Europeans and breed 
group of Burmese–Burmilla–Singapura were excluded, indicat-
ing that most of the variation originated from these two breeds. 
The largest proportion of deceased cats was among Turkish vans 
(28%), and the smallest – in the Siberians–Neva Masquerades 
group (2%). The highest proportion of neutered cats was found 
in non-pedigree cats (92%), and the lowest in the Persian–Exotic 
group (54%).
There were altogether 227 responses, of which either the age or 
the sex (or both) of the cat was missing. The neutering status was 
missing from 51 cats. In disease categories, in all other categories, 
3–9 were missing values, except in “Other diseases,” where the 
number was 20. When the missing values of sex, age, and disease 
category (variables used in logistic regression models) were 
summed, the sample size requirements were still accomplished 
for all other breeds, except Cymric–Manxes. The same was true 
when excluding cats that had died prior to January 1st, 2005 
(n = 146).
In the behavioral part, information concerning “activity” was 
missing from 112, “contact with people” from 167, “aggressive-
ness toward family” from 108, “aggressiveness toward strange 
people” from 119, “aggressiveness toward other cats” from 207, 
“sensitivity toward new things” from 115, “sensitivity toward 
new people” from 113, and “licking” from 154 cats. The effect 
of missing values on the final results was not investigated, as the 
behavioral characterization was only preliminary and needs a 
more comprehensive study in the future.

Prevalence of Disease categories and 
separate Diseases
Prevalence of Disease Categories
Altogether, 5415 cats (66%) were reported to have had a disease/
diseases belonging to at least one of the 19 disease categories, 
including behavioral traits. The disease categories included 
diagnoses made either by the veterinarians or the owners (see 
Questionnaire in Presentation S1 in Supplementary Material). 
Diagnoses in the categories of “behavioral problems” and 
“parasites and protozoan” had mainly been made by the owner, 
while the diagnoses in all other disease categories had been 
mainly made by veterinarians (Figure 3). In the categories of 
“diseases of the urinary system,” “disorders of the cardiac and 
circulatory system,” “blood disorders,” “autoimmune diseases,” 
and “tumors,” almost all of the diagnoses had been made by the 
veterinarian.
A total of 63% of pedigree cats had been diagnosed with a 
disease/diseases in at least one of the categories (diagnosed 
either by the veterinarian or the owner), whereas the percentage 
among non-pedigree cats was 78%. Among male and female cats, 
the percentages were 67 and 66%, respectively. The difference 
between pedigree and non-pedigree cats was significant (chi 
square p < 0.0001). However, when only veterinary diagnoses 
were considered, and diagnoses in the category of “parasites and 
protozoans” were excluded, the difference was non-significant 
(p = 0.0745), despite a modest overrepresentation of the non-
pedigree cats (55%) compared with pedigree cats (52%). The 
difference between male and female cats was not significant 
(p = 0.3706); however, when diagnoses in the category of “Genital 
diseases” were excluded, significantly higher prevalence was 
found in male (66%) than female cats (59%) (p < 0.0001).
The main prevalence results in disease categories diagnosed 
either by veterinarian or owner are presented below, and in the 
Data Sheet S2 in Supplementary Material, separately for diag-
noses made only by veterinarian or owner (as well as for other 
subgroups).
The most prevalent disease category among all cats was 
“Dental and oral diseases” (28%, Figure 4). It was the most com-
mon category in breeds and subgroups as well (Data Sheet S2 
in Supplementary Material). Other prevalent categories included 
skin disorders (12%), the urinary system (12%), the digestive 
tract (11%), eyes, (10%), and the musculoskeletal system (10%). 
Genital diseases were also common in female pedigree cats 
(19%), but not as frequent in non-pedigree cats (5%) (chi square 
p < 0.0001).
Age
Prevalence increased by age in many disease categories. This 
was particularly apparent in the category of “dental and oral 
diseases,” but also distinctively in the urinary tract, the digestive

tract, the skin, and tumors categories. In contrast, the prevalence 
of “congenital developmental disorders,” “blood disorders,” and 
“autoimmune diseases” was not affected by age, while some 
decrease was observed in the category of “other diseases.” The 
difference in the prevalence between the age groups of <1 year 
and ≥11 years was significant in all disease categories, except in 
“congenital developmental disorders” and “male genital diseases.”
Sex, Alive/Dead, and Neutering
In almost all the disease categories, male cats were overrepre-
sented, as compared to female cats, deceased as compared to 
living cats, and neutered as compared to non-neutered cats. 
Between male and female, the differences were significant in the 
categories of “dental and oral diseases,” “genital diseases,” “diseases 
of the digestive tract,” “diseases of the urinary system,” “diseases 
of the respiratory tract,” “tumors,” “parasites and protozoans,” and 
“cardiac and circulatory system.” Of these categories, female cats 
were overrepresented only in the categories of “genital diseases” 
and “tumors.” Between alive and deceased cats, the differences 
were significant in all other categories, except in “female and 
male genital diseases,” “behavioral problems,” and “parasites and 
protozoans,” and between neutered and non-neutered cats, in all 
other categories, except in “other diseases” and “blood disorders.” 
In categories with significant difference, deceased cats had higher 
prevalence than living cats, and neutered cats – higher than non-
neutered cats.
Pedigree and Non-Pedigree
Non-pedigree cats were overrepresented as compared to pedi-
gree cats in most of the disease categories (Figure 5). They had 
significantly higher prevalence in “dermatological/glandular 
diseases,” “diseases of the digestive tract,” “diseases of the urinary 
system,” “behavioral problems,” “diseases of the respiratory 
tract,” “parasites and protozoans,” “otic diseases,” and “dental and 
oral diseases” as compared to pedigree cats. Pedigree cats had 
significantly higher prevalence only in the “genital diseases” and 
“disorders of the cardiac and circulatory system” categories.
Individual Breeds
In separate breeds, like stated above, the most prevalent disease 
category in most breeds was “dental and oral diseases” with a 
minimum prevalence of 16% in Sphynxes and maximum – 40% 
in the breed group of Siamese–Balinese–Oriental–Somali. 
Non-pedigree cats had the highest prevalence in the category of 
“parasites and protozoans” (36%) (Figure 4).
The most prominent breed-specific exceptions included 
high prevalence in “ocular diseases” (24%) and “female genital 
diseases” (32%) in Persian–Exotics, “respiratory tract diseases” 
in Korats (23%), “tumors” in Turkish vans (13%), and “parasites 
and protozoans” in Cornish Rexes and non-pedigree cats (12 
and 36%, respectively). In addition, there was a relatively high 
prevalence of cardiac issues in Sphynxes (8%), urinary system 
disease in Abyssinian–Ocicat–Somali (21%), and musculoskeletal 
condition in Korats (16%), as well as a low prevalence of female 
genital diseases in non-pedigree cats (5%) compared with all the 
pedigree breeds (19%) (Figures 4 and 5).

breed group of Cymric–Manxes and the breed of Korats (Figure 6 
and Data Sheet S3 in Supplementary Material). The prevalence 
between breeds varied from 12% in Devon Rexes to 28% in 
the breed group of Siamese–Balinese–Oriental–Seychellois. 
Common diseases for all cats and in the majority of the breeds, 
such as gingivitis (all cats 8%), repetitive vomiting (4%), tail kink 
(4%), feline odontoclastic resorption lesion (FORL) (4%), and 
urinary tract infection (4%), were also included. Among pedigree 
female cats, cesarean section (7% female) and stillborn kittens 
(6% female) belonged to the most prevalent issues throughout the 
breeds, whereas among the non-pedigree cats, the prevalence of 
genital disorders was comparably low.
Age
Examples of increasing prevalence from the youngest to the 
oldest age group were found in dental calculus (<1 year: 0%; 
≥11 years: 43%), gingivitis (<1 year: 0%; ≥11 years: 13%), FORL 
(<1 year: 0%; ≥11 years: 11%), renal/kidney failure (<1 year: 0%; 
≥11 years: 16%), urinary tract infection (<1 year: 1%; ≥11 years: 
9%), urinary stones (<1 year: 0%; ≥11 years: 7%), and mammary 
tumor (<1 year: 0%; ≥11 years: 6%). Also, the same tendency 
was distinct in asthma (<1 year: 1%; ≥11 years: 6%). In all these 
diseases, the difference between the youngest and the oldest age 
groups was significant (chi square p < 0.0001).
Alive and Dead
In most diseases, the prevalence of deceased cats was higher than 
in alive cats, with the most prominent differences in FIP (alive 0% 
and dead 11%, chi square p < 0.0001) and renal/kidney failure 
(alive 1% and dead 14%, chi square p < 0.0001). Tumors were also 
overrepresented among deceased cats, particularly in the groups 
of other (unidentified) tumors (alive 0% and dead 9%, chi square 
p < 0.0001) and the mammary tumor (alive 0% and dead 7%, 
chi square p < 0.0001). Some tumors were represented among 
deceased cats only, such as the digestive tract tumor (dead 4% and 
alive n = 0) and liver tumor (dead 1% and alive n = 0).
As noted above, higher prevalence of FIP was found in deceased 
than alive cats, but it was also overrepresented in non-neutered 
than neutered cats (3 vs. 1%, respectively), whereas in most of 
the other diseases, the order of prevalence between the alive and 
deceased cats as well as the neutered and the non-neutered cats 
was reversed. FIP was also the most prevalent disease among cats 
aged <1 year (5%).
Disease Categories
When separate disease categories were considered, the most 
prevalent diseases were moderate seborrhea (3%) in “dermato-
logical/glandular diseases,” dental calculus and gingivitis (21 and 
8%, respectively) in “dental and oral diseases,” renal failure and

urinary system,” tail kink (4%) in “diseases of the musculoskeletal 
system,” repetitive vomiting (4%) in “diseases of the digestive 
tract,” asthma and respiratory infection (3% each) in “diseases of 
the respiratory tract,” cesarean section and stillborn kittens (6 and 
5%, respectively) in the “female genital diseases,” undescended 
testis (2%) in the “male genital diseases,” and food allergy (3%) in 
the “endocrine and metabolic diseases.”
Individual Breeds
The most prevalent disorder among all breeds, except Korats and 
the breed group of Cymric–Manxes, was dental calculus (preva-
lence 21% for all cats). In turn, among Korats, the most prevalent 
disease was asthma (19%), and in breed group of Cymric–Manxes, 
variations in the length of the tail (entirely tailless 34%, stumpy 
21%). Among the exceptionally high prevalence compared with 
other breeds, to mention some, were gingivitis in the breed group 
of Siamese–Balinese–Oriental–Seychellois (18%), sequester of 
cornea (5%) in the breed group of Persian–Exotic, renal failure 
(8%) in Korats, protozoans (11%) and HCM (6%) in Sphynxes, 
stillborn kittens (female 16%) in the breed group Burmese–
Burmilla–Singapura, cesarean section (female 15%) in Birmans, 
different tumors in Turkish vans, and endo- and ectoparasites (23 
and 18%, respectively) in non-pedigree cats.
Phylogenetic Conditions
Distinct phylogenetic connections of the breeds concerning asso-
ciation to the same disease were detected in the anal sac problem 
(Birman, Korat) (Data Sheet S4 in Supplementary Material), 
strabismus (Birman, Siamese–Balinese–Oriental–Seychellois), 
cesarean 
section 
(Birman, 
Burmese–Burmilla–Singapura, 
Siamese–Balinese–Oriental–Seychellois), and asthma (Korat, 
Siamese–Balinese–Oriental–Seychellois) (Figure 7). The preva-
lence of the diseases were higher in these breeds compared with 
other breeds (non-pedigree cats excluded). Also, the logistic 
regression analysis verified these breeds associated with the 
diseases.
Breed-specific Diseases
Altogether, 78 diseases were considered tentatively breed-specific, 
according to disease prevalence and the number of diseased cats 
(Data Sheets S4 and S5 in Supplementary Material). Fisher’s exact 
tests’ p-values < 0.05 (Data Sheet S6 in Supplementary Material) 
indicated that in all 78 diseases, there were cat breeds, which were 
overrepresented compared with other pedigree cats, and in most 
of the diseases, also compared with non-pedigree cats.
Reflux nephropathy (RN) was proven to be associated with 
Ragdolls in grounds of Fisher’s exact test p value < 0.001, and the 
fact that Ragdolls were the only breed which had been reported 
to have had the disease (Data Sheet S4G in Supplementary 
Material). Of the remaining 77 diseases, altogether 57 diseases 
were verified to be breed-specific by logistic regression analysis 
with variables “
Age,” “Sex,” and “Alive/dead” included (Data Sheet 
S7A in Supplementary Material). Also, the variable “Neutered/
non-neutered” was considered in the model, but omitted because 
of a modifying effect with the variable “Age,” and because the

exact timing of the neutering with respect to the occurrence of 
the diseases was not known. Genetic mutation had been already 
revealed in 6 of the 57 diseases (Data Sheet S7B in Supplementary 
Material), 32 diseases were suggested as breed-specific conditions 
(Data Sheet S7C in Supplementary Material), 18 diseases were 
newly identified as likely breed-specific conditions (Data Sheet 
S7D in Supplementary Material), and for 21 diseases, breed speci-
ficity could not be verified, even though some of them had been 
proposed to be breed-specific in previous studies (Data Sheet S7E 
in Supplementary Material).
The diseases with known mutations included polycystic 
kidney disease (PKD), progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), 
HCM, and three types of malformations of tail (Table S7B in 
Supplementary Material). In all these diseases, the high values 
of MOR and evidence ratio indicated a distinct association of 
the breed to the disease. For example, in PKD, both the MOR 
(13.8 when non-pedigree cat excluded) and the evidence ratio 
(>103) were very high. From the diseases with known mutations, 
we found the following disease–breed associations in our study: 
Persian to PKD, Siamese–Balinese–Oriental–Seychellois and 
Abyssinian–Ocicat–Somal to PRA, Sphynx and British to HCM, 
and Cymric–Manx to malformations of the tail. The breeds asso-
ciated with these diseases in our study were the same as in which 
the gene mutation was found in all other diseases except in HCM.
In 18 of the 32 diseases with previously suggested breed-
specific conditions, at least one of the breeds found prone in 
our study was also proven prone in previous studies, but in 14 
diseases, breeds in our study and in previous studies differed. The 
strongest breed-specific associations, according to the MOR and 
evidence ratios, were found in entropion, sequester of the cornea 
(Figure 8), hip dysplasia, feline eosinophilic granuloma complex, 
strabismus (alignment problem of eyes), fungal skin disease, 
asthma, and malocclusion (teeth alignment problem). All these 
diseases had MOR over 2.5 and the evidence ratio of over 103. 
Despite the low value of six of the evidence ratios, restrictive 
cardiomyopathy (RCM) was considered breed-specific on the 
grounds of high values of MOR (5.9 non-pedigree cats excluded 
and 3.9 non-pedigree cats included) and prevalence (Data Sheet 
S4H in Supplementary Material), which inevitably associated 
RCM to Cornish Rexes. The low value of the evidence ratio was 
due to only few cases (n = 9) of the disease altogether.
Of the diseases, we found breed-specific for the first time in this 
study, the best evidence was found for hooked sternum, oligodon-
tia, periodontitis, traumas to the skin, and repetitive constipation 
with MOR > 2 and the evidence ratio of over 103. Also twisted legs, 
feline herpesvirus infection (FHV), and ovarian cysts (female) 
were considered strongly breed-specific, according to high values 
of MOR (5.4, 3.6, and 2.5, respectively, when non-pedigree cats 
excluded) and the prevalence, which associated twisted legs to 
the breed group of Abyssinian–Ocicat–Somali, FHV to Sphynxes 
and Cornish Rexes, and the breed group of Persian–Exotic to 
ovarian cysts (Data Sheets S4J,T,N in Supplementary Material, 
respectively).
We found, altogether, 20 diseases without evidence for breed 
specificity due to the low values of evidence ratios, indicating that 
the variable “Breed” did not bring any additional information into 
 12

the logistic regression models. According to MOR values, some 
heterogeneity between breeds was observed, but the variation was 
not large enough to conclude breed specificity.
The OR of breeds proven overrepresented in our study and 
the references to the previous studies are summarized in Data 
Sheet S7 in Supplementary Material. Models 1–3 are presented 
without interactions included, as the interactions did not have 
a prominent effect on the critical values of our study (MOR, 
evidence ratio, OR of the breeds) in any of the diseases. Omitting 
the interactions was also found reasonable because the interac-
tion should have been added in all three models, even in those 
in which it was not significant, to keep the comparability in 
counting the evidence ratio (17). Further checking, concerning 
breeds containing several cats that died before January 1st, 2005 
or in which the responses were associated (>15%) with the one 
breeder, revealed that in fungal skin diseases, most of the cats in 
the breed group of Cymric–Manx were both associated with the 
same breeder and had died before January 1st, 2005. No other 
notable effects caused by cats that died before January 1st, 2005 
were found, but other diseases in which one breeder had had an 
effect to the disease prevalence were detected (see Data Sheet S7A 
in Supplementary Material).
Behavioral abnormalities
We found considerable variation in the behavioral traits between 
the breeds (Data Sheet S4F in Supplementary Material). For 
example, 10% of British, Ragdolls, and non-pedigree cats were 
reported with low activity (not at all or little), whereas the cor-
responding percentage among all pedigree cats was 5%, and in 
Bengals – 1%. The British were also reported to have less contact 
(9% not at all or a little) with people than all cats on average (4%). 
Turkish vans and Bengals, in turn, were more aggressive toward 
other cats (15 and 9% aggressive often or very often, respectively) 
than cats on average (5%). Turkish vans were also reported to 
have more aggressiveness toward unfamiliar people (6% aggres-
sive often or very often) than cats in all the other breeds (<3% in 
each). Turkish vans, Russian blues, Bengals, Siamese–Balinese–
Oriental–Seychellois, and non-pedigree cats indicated high 
proportions in sensitivity toward new things (>3% sensitive very 
often in each breed) as well as toward new people (>4% sensitive 
very often in each breed). In all pedigree cats, the corresponding 
proportion was 2% in both traits. Licking was common in many 
breeds with the highest proportions in non-pedigree cats and in 
the breed group of Burmese–Burmilla–Singapura (often or very 
often 8% in both).
In the logistic regression models, breed was an essential 
variable in the models in terms of evidence ratio (>103) (Data 
Sheet S7F in Supplementary Material) in all other behavioral 
traits, except in “aggressiveness toward family” and “contact with 
people.” In “contact with people” the value of evidence ratio (60) 
indicated a still relatively important role for breed in the model, 
but in “aggressiveness toward family,” a lower value of AIC in the 
model without the breed indicated that the model without a vari-
able breed was better than with the breed included. The highest 
MOR was in “aggressiveness toward strangers” with the Turkish 
van as being the most aggressive breed.
DiscUssiOn
The implementation of genetic research requires knowledge 
of breed-specific health issues to decide the best strategies for 
patient recruitment. Our feline health survey in a population of 
over 8000 cats in Finland provides a comprehensive overview of 
the health profiles and not only forms a strong foundation for 
genetic research but also gives useful information to breeders, 
cat fanciers, and veterinarians. This study covered 31 breeds and 
a large non-pedigree cat population as an appropriate reference 
group to pedigree cats. The living conditions of non-pedigree cats, 
such as environment, outdoor activities, and treatment, closely 
resembled those of pedigree cats (data not shown). In addition, 
the high percentage of non-neutered cats suggests that the owners 
are equally conscious as the owners of pedigree cats. The study 
explored the prevalence in altogether 227 separate diseases iden-
tifying the common health issues in cats and 57 breed-specific 
conditions as well, that can be targeted for genetic research.
Disease Prevalence and 
common Diseases
The most common disease categories and individual diseases 
found in our study have also been described in earlier studies. 
Dental diseases were the most prevalent category in the UK study 
(20), and dental calculus and gingivitis the most prevalent dis-
eases in a US study (21). Dermatological diseases were among the 
most prevalent disease categories in UK, Japanese, and Swedish 
studies (20, 22, 23). Furthermore, diseases of the urinary system 
and digestive tract (22, 23) and ophthalmological diseases (22) 
are common categories.
The list of common individual diseases include dental calculus 
and gingivitis, parasites (21), vomiting (20, 21, 23), urinary tract 
infection (20), kidney disorders (20, 21), urinary stones (23), 
diarrhea (20, 21), and cystitis (21, 23). Although many of these 
were found in our study, there are also differences that can be 
explained by the study design (population vs. veterinary data) and 
size, geographical region, disease definitions, and data source. For 
example, the data in the US (n = 14 270) (21) and UK (n = 3584) 
(20) studies were based on veterinary clinical data, while the data 
from Sweden (n = 301 485) (23) and Japan (n = 49 450) (22) 
comes from an insurance database; ours is population data.
Higher morbidity of male cats to common diseases (in early 
age) has been found in Sweden (23). The higher morbidity of male 
cats was rationalized by anatomical (urinary system) and behav-
ioral (causing traumas) differences between male and female cats. 
The prevalence in the category of “diseases of the urinary system” 
was also higher for male cats in our study. Traumas were not 
treated like a disease category in our study, as in Swedish study, but 
male cats had significantly more traumas to the skin (chi square 
p = 0.0066) than female cats. However, omitting the diagnoses 
of urinary tract diseases and skin traumas, we found a higher 
morbidity rate in males. This is due to the fact that male cats were 
also overrepresented in a majority of the other disease categories. 
In the Japanese and Swedish studies (22, 23), domestic and cross-
bred cats had been stated to be more prone to accidents, and the 
assumed cause was different access to outdoors. In our study, the 
 13

Feline Health Survey

August 2016 | Volume 3 | Article 70
most overrepresented breed in skin traumas was non-pedigree 
cats, which roamed outside more than pedigree cats (data not 
shown), but also, breed groups of Siamese–Balinese–Oriental–
Seychellois and Abyssinian–Ocicat–Somali and Norwegian 
Forest cats were overrepresented, as well. The different outdoor 
activities did not explain their higher prevalence of traumas. The 
more frequent outside roaming was, instead, the most probable 
cause of higher prevalence of parasites among non-pedigree cats 
compared to pedigree cats.
Our results suggest that non-pedigree cats have more diseases 
than pedigree cats with a higher percentage of non-pedigree cats 
having diseases at least in one of the disease categories (chi square 
p < 0.0001). However, when only veterinary diagnoses were con-
sidered, and the disease category of “Parasites” was omitted, the 
difference was not significant anymore (p = 0.0745), even though 
non-pedigreed cats were still overrepresented compared with 
pedigree cats. A potential explanation could relate to the differ-
ences in the selection of the reported cats between the owners of 
pedigree and non-pedigree cats (see limitation below). UK and 
Japan studies also found equal prevalence of disease in pedigree 
and non-pedigree populations (20, 22).
In many diseases and disease categories, disease prevalence 
increased with age up to ≥11 years. The increase was especially 
strong in disease categories of “dental and oral diseases,” “diseases 
of the urinary system,” and “tumors.” A similar increase in these 
same disease categories was reported previously in Japan and 
Sweden (22, 23), although our study found more age-related 
disease categories. This is because we asked to report the health 
history to cover the earlier stages of life and not only at the time 
of reporting. For the same reason, the peak in the youngest age 
group, which was found in many disease categories in the Japan 
and Sweden studies (22, 23), remained uncovered in our study. 
For example, we found that the prevalence of the disease category 
of “parasites and protozoans” increased cumulatively throughout 
the age groups, due to inclusion of cured infestations from the 
earlier years of age (as confirmed from the additional information 
of the questionnaire), whereas in Japan and Sweden (22, 23), the 
prevalence of the “parasites and protozoans” category was high 
only in the first age group.
The disease prevalence in most of the disease categories 
and diseases were higher in deceased than living cats, and 
neutered than non-neutered cats. An interesting exception was 
the prevalence of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which was 
higher among living and non-neutered cats. FIP was also the 
most prevalent disease in age group of <1 year. The reason why 
FIP was prevalent in young and deceased cats results from the 
clinical picture of FIP as an infectious disease of young cats with 
high mortality (24). The high prevalence among non-neutered 
cats was due to the age distribution of non-neutered cats with 73% 
of them being aged <3 years.
Phylogenetic association to a disease, which was detected in 
the anal sac problem, strabismus, HCM, cesarean section, and 
asthma, may imply inheritance of the genetic predisposition via 
a common ancestor of the phylogenetic group of cats. Previous 
studies suggest the same to strabismus (25) and cesarean section 
(26). In both diseases, the phylogenetically associated breeds in our 
study, i.e., Birman and Siamese–Balinese–Oriental–Seychellois 
group, were also found to be associated in the previous studies. 
Instead, the anal sac problem lacks associations to any breed. 
Only Anal sac gland carcinoma (ASGC) was found associated 
with the Siamese breed (27), whereas the breeds found associated 
with the anal sac problems in our study were Birman and Korat. 
However, Siamese, Birman, and Korat breeds belong to the same 
eastern-derived population (14), which might indicate an inher-
ited common predisposition to problems in anal sacs. Asthma was 
found phylogenetically associated with Korats and the Siamese–
Balinese–Oriental–Seychellois group in our study. It has been 
associated with the Siamese breed in many previous studies also 
(28–30). No study was found, in which asthma would have been 
connected to Korats, but association was found to Birmans (31). A 
common predisposition to asthma by the breeds belonging to the 
same eastern-derived population could be considered.
Breed-specific Disorders
One of our key objectives was to identify potential breed-specific 
diseases for genetic studies. Breed specificity in diseases often 
implies heredity (3), and, thus, breed-specific diseases are 
appropriate candidates to be considered taking into genetic 
research. We found 58 such diseases, including RN, sequester of 
cornea, entropion, feline eosinophilic granuloma complex, peri-
odontitis, oligodontia, urinary tract infection, HCM (Sphynxes 
and British), RCM, hip dysplasia, hooked sternum, asthma, and 
stillborn kittens. HCM mutation has been found in Ragdolls and 
Maine Coons (9, 10), but the Sphynxes and British’
, which were 
found overrepresented in our study, have also been associated 
with HCM in previous studies (32–34). RN was found only in 
Ragdolls. Of the other diseases mentioned, at least one of the 
breeds found overrepresented in our study had also been found 
overrepresented in previous studies, including sequester of cornea 
(35, 36), entropion (37, 38), asthma (28–30), strabismus (39, 40), 
and hip dysplasia (41). RCM had been found overrepresented in 
non-pedigree shorthairs. As potential new breed-specific condi-
tions, we found feline eosinophilic granuloma complex, peri-
odontitis, oligodontia, urinary tract infection, hooked sternum, 
and stillborn kittens.
However, further studies concerning diseases suggested to be 
breed-specific in our study must be conducted before proceeding 
in genetic research. It is essential to also map other contributing 
factors concerning lifestyle of the cat, such as environment, diet, 
and outdoor activities, as well as the differences between the 
breeders and possible cross effects between different diseases. 
For example, entropion and herpes virus in the eye have been 
proposed as contributing factors in sequester of cornea (42). Also, 
our data confirmed the association between sequester and both 
of these diseases (Fishers’ exact test p < 0.001 for both when cats 
aged <1 year excluded), but the major part of the sequester cases 
did not have either of these associations, also allowing other pos-
sible triggers for sequester as well as for entropion. Also, nystag-
mus and malocclusion, which were found to be breed-specific in 
our study, have been proposed to be symptoms of other diseases 
or physical features rather than independent disorders (35, 38, 
43). Ongoing studies will investigate the possible associations of 
above-mentioned factors to common and breed-specific disease 
predisposition.

In diseases in which no breed specificity was detected in our 
study, digestive tract tumor (44), birthing complications (26, 45), 
FIP (46–48), and pyometra (49) were found to be breed-specific 
in previous studies. The reason for this was the low variation of 
prevalence between the breeds, which might be due to under-
reporting in certain breeds, diagnostic problems, or different 
environmental factors compared with the other studies.
Behavioral Variation
In the preliminary analysis of behavioral traits, most divergent 
behavior was found in British, Ragdolls, Turkish Vans, Korats, 
and Bengals. Both British and Ragdolls (along with non-pedigree 
cats) were the most inactive breeds, and, in addition, British had 
less contact with people than cats on average (Data Sheets S4 and 
S7 in Supplementary Material). Ragdolls have been described as 
less active earlier (50). Turkish Vans were distinctively the most 
aggressive breed toward strangers and other cats. Korats also 
showed aggression toward family members and unfamiliar peo-
ple, and Bengals – toward other cats. This finding in Bengals has 
been observed before (50). We also found variation in sensitivity 
and licking in few breeds. Overall, these results encourage a more 
comprehensive future behavioral study in cats to establish proper 
genetic study cohorts and to identify environmental contributors.
limitations
Health surveys targeted to pet breeders and owners have 
limitations. One of the key concerns is related to the responder 
distribution in the population since the cat owners were reached 
by information channels which might have favored breeders and 
other cat fanciers over owners who own cats as pets but are not 
really cat fanciers. This may have resulted in non-response error 
by some cat owners not participating in the study and in measure-
ment error by some responders giving inaccurate or incomplete 
information (51). Suspicions like these have been also expressed 
in meetings with the cat breeders and owners during the study to 
encourage reports from both healthy and affected cats. Inaccurate 
and incomplete information may have been caused by misun-
derstandings or missing some diagnoses leading to under- or 
overestimates of prevalence, especially if the owner had made the 
diagnosis. Therefore, we have reported prevalence data in various 
diagnostic groups to allow comparisons.
The third limitation may relate to the scarcity of Finnish breed-
ers or the large proportion of breeders not participating in some 
breeds, which may have resulted in a concentration of responses 
only from a few breeders. This might have led to bias, especially 
in infectious diseases, making a local epidemic seem like a high 
prevalence in the whole breed. These kinds of effects were sought 
during the study, and if signs of such concentration were detected, 
they were marked in the Table S7 in Supplementary Material. It is 
important to also keep in mind that Finnish cat breeds may differ 
genetically from breeds in other countries because of differences 
in breeding practices, which can create distinct lines within a 
single breed (4). This may have caused genetic concentration or 
dilatation in Finnish breeds, yielding deviant prevalence.
Also, the design of our study, with disease occurrences includ-
ing earlier states of life in addition to the time of submitting the 
questionnaire, gives ground to presume prevalence in our study 
to be higher than in prevalence studies in which only occurrences 
of a certain point of time are accepted. In addition, it is appropri-
ate to point out that logistic regression yields overestimates of 
OR when the prevalence of the disease is greater than 5% (15). 
However, in our study, logistic regression was targeted to desig-
nate the effect of the whole variable “Breed” by means of MOR, 
and the yielded OT in case of prevalence >5% in Model 3 may be 
considered suggestive of the approximate magnitude of the effects 
of separate breeds, not the exact value of odds ratio.
We also recognize that “food allergies” was suboptimally 
placed in the category of “endocrine and metabolic diseases” 
instead of the categories of digestive tract diseases. This may 
have caused overestimates in the prevalence of the category of 
endocrine and metabolic diseases. However, it is more important 
to pay attention to the prevalence of specific conditions rather 
than broader categories.
Despite all suggested reasons causing possible bias, prevalence 
in our study match well with the results stated in earlier stud-
ies and are underestimates rather than overestimates in case of 
disparity giving conservative inferences (20, 21). It is more likely 
that some breed-specific diseases have been missed rather than 
breed specificity has been suspected in vain.
cOnclUsiOn
This unique study gives valuable prevalence information of 227 
feline diseases in Finnish cats and identifies nearly 60 breed-spe-
cific disorders that can be targeted for genetic characterization. 
Compared to previous studies, we provide the broadest country-
wide health survey available so far with designed breed-specific 
sample size requirements. The study established a health survey 
platform and database, which has value not only for genetic 
research programs but also provides for veterinary medicine and 
breeding programs.
