SUMMARY
Drugs that recapitulate aspects of the exercise
adaptive response have the potential to provide
better treatment for diseases associated with phys-
ical inactivity. We previously observed reduced
skeletal muscle class IIa HDAC (histone deacety-
lase) transcriptional repressive activity during exer-
cise. Here, we find that exercise-like adaptations
are induced by skeletal muscle expression of class
IIa HDAC mutants that cannot form a corepressor
complex. Adaptations include increased metabolic
gene expression, mitochondrial capacity, and lipid
oxidation. An existing HDAC inhibitor, Scriptaid,
had similar phenotypic effects through disruption
of
the
class
IIa
HDAC
corepressor
complex.
Acute Scriptaid administration to mice increased
the expression of metabolic genes, which required
an intact class IIa HDAC corepressor complex.
Chronic Scriptaid administration increased exercise
capacity, whole-body energy expenditure and lipid
oxidation, and reduced fasting blood lipids and
glucose. Therefore, compounds that disrupt class
IIa HDAC function could be used to enhance meta-
bolic health in chronic diseases driven by physical
inactivity.
INTRODUCTION
Physical inactivity, which is related to energy imbalance and a
loss of functional capacity (Booth et al., 2012), is recognized as
a major cause of chronic disease and mortality (Mokdad et al.,
2004). However, many patients and at-risk individuals do not,
or cannot, engage in physical activity. Identification of the mech-
anisms mediating exercise adaptations could provide new mo-
lecular targets for therapeutic intervention.
Adaptations to exercise involve repeated transient changes in
gene expression that alter protein levels and, ultimately, pheno-
type (Egan and Zierath, 2013). A number of studies implicate the
class IIa histone deacetylase (HDAC) myocyte enhancer factor 2
(MEF2) axis in this process. The class IIa HDACs, which include
isoforms 4, 5, 7, and 9, repress gene expression by interacting
with the MEF2 transcription factors (McKinsey et al., 2001).
Although the catalytic domain of the class IIa HDACs is structur-
ally similar to the highly active class I HDACs, they have low
intrinsic HDAC activity against acetyl-lysine substrates due to
a single amino acid substitution within their active site (Lahm
et al., 2007), and their repressive activity requires a corepressor
complex that contains SMRT/N-Cor and HDAC3 (Fischle et al.,
2002; Kao et al., 2000), a class I HDAC. We have found that
this class IIa HDAC corepressor complex is disrupted by exer-
cise in human skeletal muscle through phosphorylation-depen-
dent nuclear export of HDAC4 and HDAC5 (McGee et al.,
2009), which reduced their association with MEF2 (McGee and
Hargreaves, 2004), increased MEF2 DNA binding (McGee

 et al., 2006), and increased expression of MEF2-dependent
genes (McGee and Hargreaves, 2004). However, the role of
MEF2 in muscle post-development is unclear. Similarly, the
gene networks that the class IIa HDACs regulate in adult muscle
are unknown. Further understanding of this signaling axis could
reveal the class IIa HDACs as targets for pharmacological induc-
tion of exercise adaptions.
Most HDAC inhibitors lack isoform selectivity and generally
consist of a chelating moiety that interacts with the active-site
zinc atom, a narrow linker region that spans the catalytic groove
and a capping group (Sternson et al., 2001). It has emerged that
some HDAC inhibitors can disrupt the class IIa HDAC core-
pressor complex by changing the conformation of the class
IIa HDAC active site, which mediates physical association with
N-Cor/SMRT (Hudson et al., 2015; Lahm et al., 2007). Therefore,
HDAC inhibitors that were thought to only inhibit class I HDAC
catalytic activity may have efficacy against class IIa HDAC tran-
scriptional repression. Here, we found that expression of class
IIa HDAC active-site mutants that disrupt their corepressor
complex in skeletal muscle induced metabolic adaptations and
identified a HDAC inhibitor, Scriptaid, which had similar pheno-
typic effects. Moreover, chronic administration of Scriptaid to
mice induced skeletal muscle and systemic metabolic adaptive
responses.
RESULTS
Active-Site Mutant HDAC4 and HDAC5 Increase MEF2
Transcriptional Activity, the Expression of Metabolic
Genes, and Oxidative Metabolism
Mutation of key residues within the active site of class IIa HDACs
disrupts the class IIa HDAC corepressor complex in vitro (Fischle
et al., 2002; Hudson et al., 2015); however, the effect on MEF2
activity is unknown. In a MEF2 reporter assay that was sensitive
to HDAC repression (Figures S1A and S1B), expression of
HDAC4 and HDAC5 active-site mutants (D840N HDAC4 and
D870N HDAC5 in human; D832N HDAC4 and D861N HDAC5
in mouse) increased MEF2-dependent transcription (Figure 1A),
which required mutation of both HDAC4 and HDAC5 (data
not shown). This shows that the D832N HDAC4 and D861N
HDAC5 mutants (referred to hereinafter as DN HDAC4 and 5)
act in a dominant-negative manner on MEF2-dependent tran-
scription. To determine whether these mutants dissociated the
class IIa corepressor complex in vivo, rAAV6 vectors expressing
DN HDAC4 and 5 were administered to one hindlimb of C57BL6
mice via multiple intramuscular injections. The contralateral hin-
dlimb musculature was administered with empty rAAV6 vector
as a control (Figure 1B). Class IIa HDAC transcriptional repres-
sion is mediated, in part, through their association with SMRT
(Hudson et al., 2015). Coimmunoprecipitation showed that
MEF2-associated SMRT was reduced in extensor digitorum
longus (EDL) muscles expressing DN HDAC4 and 5 (Figures
1B and 1C). To examine the capacity for MEF2 to bind DNA, a
biotinylated oligonucleotide pull-down assay with probes con-
taining either a MEF2 consensus binding sequence or a scram-
bled sequence was validated (Figure S1C). Oligonucleotide
binding by MEF2 was increased by DN HDAC4 and 5 expression
(Figure 1D). To determine the transcriptional response to DN
HDAC4 and 5 expression, microarray analyses were performed.
The expression of �60% of genes with a putative MEF2 bind-
ing sequence (CTAAAAATAG) in their promoter region was
increased (Figure 1E), and 1,412 genes, primarily involved in
metabolic processes (Figure S1D), were differentially expressed
by DN HDAC4 and 5 expression. Gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) of metabolic pathways using the entire microarray data-
set revealed that oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid meta-
bolism, glutathione metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism,
and fatty acid elongation pathways were significantly increased
by DN HDAC4 and 5 expression (Figure 1F). This was further
examined by qRT-PCR. Exercise-responsive genes involved
in glucose (HKII and GLUT4), lipid (PDK4, CPT-1b, and HSL),
mitochondrial (CS and ATP5b), and transcriptional (PGC-1a
and PPARd) regulation of metabolism were increased by DN
HDAC4 and 5 expression, in addition to genes involved in muscle
fiber type determination (MHCI and II, MYOG; Figure 1G). To test
whether oxidative capacity was enhanced, respiration was as-
sessed in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of mice administered
rAAV6 vectors expressing DN HDAC4 and 5 or control rAAV6.
State 3 respiration was higher in muscles expressing DN
HDAC4 and 5 (Figure 1H), and components of mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation complexes were increased (Figure 1I;
complex IV subunits could not be reliably detected in these sam-
ples and were not quantified). To dissect oxidative metabolism
further, DN HDAC4 and 5 were expressed in C2C12 myotubes
(Figure S1F), which increased basal oxygen consumption rate
(OCR; Figure S1F). Analysis of mitochondrial function revealed
that this was due to an increase in ATP turnover and not due to
alterations in uncoupled respiration (Figure S1G), indicating an
increase in cell-autonomous energy expenditure through pro-
cesses that consume ATP. Analysis of basal glucose and lipid
oxidation showed that DN HDAC4 and 5 expression increased
oxidation of the fatty acid palmitate but not glucose (Figure 1J).
The expression of DN HDAC4 and 5 in the EDL also increased
the protein levels of PGC-1a and HSL (Figure 1K), key regulatory
(C–F) MEF2-associated SMRT (C); MEF2 binding to an oligonucleotide probe with a consensus MEF2 binding site or a Scrambled (Scrm) sequence (D);

 proteins involved in skeletal muscle lipid metabolism. Together,
these data show that expression of class IIa HDAC active-site
mutants that disrupt their corepressor complex enhanced the
expression of metabolic genes and increased cell-autonomous
energy expenditure that was supported by the oxidation of fatty
acids.
Scriptaid Increases MEF2 Transcriptional Activity,
Metabolic Gene Expression, and Oxidative Metabolism
In Vitro
We sought to identify an HDAC inhibitor that could induce similar
phenotypic adaptations. We reasoned that these effects could
be obtained through three different mechanisms: (1) inhibition
of HDAC3, which is part of the class IIa HDAC corepressor com-
plex; (2) direct inhibition of the class IIa HDACs; and/or (3) class
IIa HDAC corepressor complex disruption. Three compounds—
TSA (trichostatin A), Scriptaid, and MC1568—with different
physicochemical properties were examined. TSA has high selec-
tivity against class I HDACs (Bradner et al., 2010), while MC1568
is reportedly a class IIa-specific inhibitor (Mai et al., 2005).
In contrast, Scriptaid shows weak inhibitory activity against
class I HDACs (Bradner et al., 2010) but has a large capping re-
gion, the size of which has been linked to the capacity to disrupt
the class IIa HDAC corepressor complex (Hudson et al., 2015).
When administered to C2C12 myotubes, TSA and Scriptaid at
0.1 and 1 mM increased histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac;
Figure 2A). As some HDAC inhibitors have reported context-
dependent cytotoxicity (Zhang et al., 2013), lactate dehydroge-
nase (LDH) release from myotubes in response to a therapeuti-
cally relevant dose (1 mM) of TSA, Scriptaid, and MC1568 was
assessed. TSA increased LDH release, indicating reduced cell
viability (Figure 2B), and was excluded from further analyses.
Time-dependent expression profiling of candidate exercise-
responsive metabolic genes in myotubes treated with Scriptaid
or MC1568 for 60 min revealed that Scriptaid increased the
expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial
biogenesis, and mitochondrial function (Figure 2C). Unexpect-
edly, MC1568 reduced the expression of all genes examined
(Figure 2C). In addition to our recent structural reassignment
of this compound (Fleming et al., 2014), we also found that
MC1568 did not elicit inhibitory activity toward HDAC4 and
HDAC5 against the class IIa HDAC-specific trifluoroacetyl-lysine
substrate in cell-free assays (Figure S2A). Therefore, MC1568
was
excluded
from
further
analyses.
Scriptaid
increased
MEF2-dependent transcriptional activity (Figure 2D) and basal
OCR (Figure 2E). This was due to accelerated ATP turnover,
and maximal respiratory capacity was also increased (Figure 2F).
Scriptaid also increased palmitate oxidation (Figure 2G). These
data show that Scriptaid enhanced metabolic gene expression,
energy expenditure, and lipid oxidation and was selected for
further mechanism of action and in vivo efficacy studies.
Scriptaid Alters Class IIa HDAC/Corepressor
Interactions
Scriptaid action on class IIa HDAC function was assessed. To
our knowledge, no studies have examined the inhibitory activity
of Scriptaid against the class IIa HDACs for the non-physiolog-
ical synthetic trifluoroacetyl-lysine substrate. In cell-free assays
with recombinant HDAC isoforms, Scriptaid had only very
weak inhibitory activity against HDAC3 (IC50 [half maximal inhib-
itory concentration], 0.5 mM; Figure S3), HDAC4, and HDAC5
(IC50 20 mM and 0.5 mM, respectively; Figure S2B). In addition
to the fact that no physiological trifluroacetyl-lysine substrates
have been identified, this suggests that the action of Scriptaid
on metabolic adaptation in muscle cells occurs independently
of direct inhibition of class I and IIa HDACs. Some HDAC inhibi-
tors can impair class IIa HDAC corepressor associations, which
appear dependent on the compound’s capping group (Hudson
et al., 2015). As Scriptaid possesses a larger capping region
than most hydroxamate-zinc-chelating HDAC inhibitors, we hy-
pothesized that Scriptaid impairs class IIa HDAC corepressor
interactions. Indeed, in high-throughput proteomics analyses,
Scriptaid has been observed to dissociate a number of coregu-
lator complex proteins from HDAC enzymes (Bantscheff et al.,
2011). Docking of Scripatid to HDAC4 revealed a binding pose
consistent with that of HDAC inhibitors (Figure 3A). The hydroxa-
mic acid exhibits a bidentate interaction with the active-site zinc,
while the aliphatic chain occupies the cleft. The large tricyclic
capping region is exposed outside of the active site in close
proximity to F812 and F871, which comprise the binding tunnel.
This optimal binding orientation is consistent with reports that
Scriptaid has a higher binding affinity (�4- to 5-fold) with the
class IIa HDACs, compared with other HDAC classes (Bant-
scheff et al., 2011). To determine whether Scriptaid disrupts
the class IIa corepressor complex, HDAC4 interaction with the
corepressor SMRT was assessed by anisotropy assays using
a fluorescence-labeled peptide corresponding to amino acids
1,450–1,469 of SMRT, which contains a class IIa HDAC-interact-
ing domain (Hudson et al., 2015). Scriptaid reduced the maximal
interaction polarization between wild-type (WT) HDAC4 and the
SMRT peptide (Figure 3B), suggesting that Scriptaid binding
influences the mobility of the fluorophore on the SMRT peptide,
implying proximity of binding. Furthermore, Scriptaid reduced
the binding affinity (higher dissociation constant, KD) between
the SMRT peptide and a gain-of-function (GOF) HDAC4 mutant
(H976Y) that enhances its association with SMRT (Figure 3B).
This was further analyzed in vivo, where Scriptaid was acutely
administered to mice via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. A time
and dose-response analysis of tissue H3K9ac was used to
estimate Scriptaid pharmacokinetics. Scriptaid at 1 mg/kg was
sufficient to increase H3K9ac in the EDL (Figure 3C), with less
obvious alterations in H3K9ac in the pancreas and brain (Fig-
ure S3A). Modest increases in H3K9ac were also observed in
the heart, while H3K9ac appeared to be reduced in the liver (Fig-
ure S3A). Scriptaid at 3 and 10 mg/kg body weight did not
appear to have additional effects on H3K9ac in skeletal muscle
(data not shown). Therefore, Scriptaid at 1 mg/kg body weight,
which is an acceptable effective therapeutic dose, was used
for all future experiments. Scriptaid reduced MEF2-associated
SMRT in EDL muscle 60 min after its administration (Figure 3D),
while MEF2 DNA binding capacity was increased (Figure 3E).
Scriptaid had no effect on the phosphorylation of the class
IIa HDACs (Figure S3B), which regulates class IIa HDAC core-
pressor interactions and the nuclear export of class IIa HDACs.
Together, these data suggest that Scriptaid disrupts the class
IIa HDAC corepressor complex.

 Scriptaid Administration Induces Metabolic Adaptive
Responses In Vivo
To examine the transcriptional response to Scriptaid and its
requirement for an intact class IIa HDAC corepressor complex,
one EDL muscle of C57BL6 mice was administered with rAAV6
vectors expressing DN HDAC4 and 5, while the contralateral
EDL muscle was administered with empty rAAV6 vector (control)
via intramuscular injection. Two weeks later, mice were adminis-
tered vehicle (5% DMSO in 13 PBS) or Scriptaid, and skeletal
muscles were collected 4 hr later. In control EDL muscles, Scrip-
taid increased the expression of �70% of genes with a putative
MEF2 binding sequence in their promoter region (Figure 4A) and
altered the expression of 1410 genes involved in a variety of bio-
logical processes, including metabolism (Figure S3C). GSEA of
metabolic pathways showed that, similar to DN HDAC4 and 5,
Scriptaid significantly increased fatty acid metabolism and
oxidative phosphorylation pathways (Figure 4B). Indeed, these
two interventions showed remarkably similar metabolic pathway

 gene expression alterations (Figure S3D), suggesting that Scrip-
taid exerts many of its effects on skeletal muscle transcription
through HDAC4 and 5. This was assessed directly by comparing
the effects of Scriptaid on the expression of a selection of meta-
bolic genes in control and EDL muscles expressing DN HDAC4
and 5. Scriptaid tended to increase all genes examined in control
muscles and significantly increased SDHb, ATP5d, CPT-1b, and
PPARd (Figure 4C). In contrast, Scriptaid either did not alter or
decreased these same genes in muscles in which DN HDAC4
and 5 were expressed (Figure 4C). Together, these data provide
evidence that Scriptaid regulates a network of metabolic genes
in vivo, which is dependent on normal class IIa HDAC function.
To assess whether chronic Scriptaid administration enhances
functional capacity and metabolism in vivo, mice were treated
with 1 mg/kg Scriptaid via daily i.p. injection for 4 weeks.
Scriptaid treatment did not alter body weight (Figure S4A) or
composition (Figures S4B and S4C) but did increase food intake
(Figure S4D). Consistent with Scriptaid-mimicking aspects of
the exercise-adaptive response, Scriptaid-treated mice had a
greater time to fatigue than vehicle-treated mice in a treadmill-
based incremental exercise test (Figure 4D). Consistent with
in vitro observations, Scriptaid invoked a small but significant
increase in whole-body energy expenditure (Figure 4E) and
lipid oxidation (Figure 4F). There was no effect on carbohy-
drate oxidation (Figure 4G) or voluntary activity (Figure S4E).
Respiration analyses were performed to determine the tissues
contributing to these effects. Scriptaid administration increased
ADP-stimulated respiration in EDL muscle (Figure 4H), which
was associated with greater respiration linked to ATP produc-
tion, but not uncoupled respiration (Figure 4I). Scriptaid adminis-
tration had no effect on respiration in liver (Figure S4F) or white
adipose tissue (Figure S4G), although a role for brown fat
could not be excluded, which tended to be higher in Scriptaid-
treated animals, but was not significantly different (Figure S4H).
Together with enhanced exercise capacity, these data suggest
that skeletal muscle is the major tissue for Scriptaid action.
Scriptaid had limited effects on skeletal muscle expression of
metabolic genes when assessed 24 hr after the last administra-
tion (Figure S4I), but it did increase PGC-1a, HSL (Figure S4J),
and mitochondrial complex protein abundance (Figure 4J).
Scriptaid reduced a number of plasma lipids, including specific
species of dihydroceramides, ceramides, sphingomyelins, and

 diacylglycerides (Figure 4K), in addition to total ceramides and
total dihydroceramides (Figures S4N and S4O). Scriptaid also
reduced fasting blood glucose levels (Figure 4L) in the absence
of changes in circulating insulin (Figure S4P). Importantly, there
were no adverse effects on cardiac morphology in Scriptaid-
treated mice (Figure S4Q). These data show that chronic
Scriptaid administration induces metabolic adaptations in vivo,
including enhanced whole-body energy expenditure and lipid
oxidation and reduced plasma lipids and glucose.
DISCUSSION
This study has used previous observations on the molecular
responses to exercise to validate the class IIa HDACs as
effective targets to pharmacologically manipulate aspects of
the exercise adaptive response. Disruption of the class IIa
HDAC corepressor complex through genetic or pharmacological
strategies increased the expression of exercise-responsive
genes in skeletal muscle, enhanced exercise performance,
increased whole-body energy expenditure and fatty acid oxida-
tion, and reduced blood lipids and glucose. Although an increase
in energy expenditure was observed in mice treated with Scrip-
taid, no alterations in body composition were observed, due to a
small increase in food intake. Nonetheless, Scriptaid treatment
reduced the levels of a number of plasma lipids that have been
linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes (Meikle et al., 2013), cardio-
vascular diseases (Fernandez et al., 2013), and non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (Gorden et al., 2015). The broad-spectrum
inhibitory profile of this compound toward a number of HDAC
isoforms would likely preclude its use in chronic disease states.
Nonetheless, these studies provide the impetus for the develop-
ment of compounds to specifically target the class IIa HDACs
and/or its corepressor complex in metabolic diseases.
In conclusion, this study has validated the class IIa HDACs
as targets to pharmacologically enhance skeletal muscle
metabolic adaptations, including enhanced functional capacity,
energy expenditure, and lipid oxidation. This approach could
be a useful prevention strategy to enhance metabolic health in
chronic diseases.

Mouse HDAC4 and HDAC5 cDNA were sub-cloned into an AAV expression

promoter (Gregorevic et al., 2004) were packaged, purified, and titered as pre-
viously described (Winbanks et al., 2013). MC1568 was synthesized using pre-
viously described procedures (Fleming et al., 2014). Scriptaid and TSA were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively.
All animal experiments were approved by the Deakin University Animal Welfare
Committee, which is subject to the Australian Code for the Responsible
Conduct of Research. Male, 8-week-old C57BL6 mice were obtained from
the Animal Resource Centre in Western Australia. For AAV experiments,
mice were anesthetized with isoflurane before intramuscular injection of
rAAV6 vectors expressing D832N HDAC4 and D861N HDAC5 into the anterior
and posterior compartments of the hindlimb targeting the soleus, TA, and EDL
muscles. Each 30-ml injection contained 2.5 3 1010 vector genomes of each
mutant HDAC vector diluted in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS). Control
injections of the contralateral limb included 5.0 3 1010 vector genomes of
empty rAAV6 vector in 30 ml of HBSS. Scriptaid and vehicle (5% DMSO in
13 PBS) were administered via i.p. injection. For chronic drug administration
studies, mice received single daily i.p. injections of Scriptaid (1 mg/kg body
weight) or vehicle (5% DMSO in 13 PBS) in the afternoon (n = 10 per group)
for 28 days until they were humanely killed. In the final 14 days of treatment,
24 hr of indirect calorimetry, an incremental exercise test, and body composi-
tion analysis by EchoMRI were performed. Mice were fasted overnight prior to
cervical dislocation and tissue collection. Bioenergetic and mitochondrial
function assays were performed as previously described (Martin et al., 2014;
Selathurai et al., 2015). Detailed materials and methods for all other proced-
ures can be found in the Supplemental Information. All data are expressed
as means ± SEM. Data normality was assessed using SPSS statistical
software. For normally distributed data, differences between groups were
assessed with a t test or one-way ANOVA as appropriate, using Minitab
statistical software. Specific differences between groups were identified using
Tukey post hoc tests. For non-normally distributed data, we performed non-
parametric tests using SPSS statistical software. Differences were considered
statistically significant where p < 0.05.
