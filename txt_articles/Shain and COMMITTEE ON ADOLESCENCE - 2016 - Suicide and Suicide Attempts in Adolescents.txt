abstract
Suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents 15 to 19 years 
old. This report updates the previous statement of the American Academy 
of Pediatrics and is intended to assist pediatricians, in collaboration with 
other child and adolescent health care professionals, in the identifi
 cation 
and management of the adolescent at risk for suicide. Suicide risk can 
only be reduced, not eliminated, and risk factors provide no more than 
guidance. Nonetheless, care for suicidal adolescents may be improved 
with the pediatrician’s knowledge, skill, and comfort with the topic, as well 
as ready access to appropriate community resources and mental health 
professionals.
CLINICAL REPORT
Guidance for the Clinician in Rendering Pediatric Care
INTRODUCTION
The number of adolescent deaths that result from suicide in the United 
States had been increasing dramatically during recent decades until 
1990, when it began to decrease modestly. From 1950 to 1990, the 
suicide rate for adolescents 15 to 19 years old increased by 300%, 
1 but 
from 1990 to 2013, the rate in this age group decreased by 28%.2 In 
2013, there were 1748 suicides among people 15 to 19 years old.2 The 
true number of deaths from suicide actually may be higher, because some 
of these deaths may have been recorded as “accidental.”3 Adolescent boys 
15 to 19 years old had a completed suicide rate that was 3 times greater 
than that of their female counterparts, 
2 whereas the rate of suicide 
attempts was twice as high among girls than among boys, correlating 
to girls tending to choose less lethal methods.4 The ratio of attempted 
suicides to completed suicides among adolescents is estimated to be 50:1 
to 100:1.5
Suicide affects young people from all races and socioeconomic groups, 
although some groups have higher rates than others. American Indian/
Alaska Native males have the highest suicide rate, and black females 
have the lowest rate of suicide. Sexual minority youth (ie, lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, or questioning) have more than twice the rate of 
suicidal ideation.6 The 2013 Youth Risk Behavior Survey of students in

grades 9 through 12 in the United 
States indicated that during the 12 
months before the survey, 39.1% of 
girls and 20.8% of boys felt sad or 
hopeless almost every day for at least 
2 weeks in a row, 16.9% of girls and 
10.3% of boys had planned a suicide 
attempt, 10.6% of girls and 5.4% 
of boys had attempted suicide, and 
3.6% of girls and 1.8% of boys had 
made a suicide attempt that required 
medical attention.7
The leading methods of suicide for 
the 15- to 19-year age group in 2013 
were suffocation (43%), discharge of 
firearms (42%), poisoning (6%), and 
falling (3%).2 Particular attention 
should be given to access to firearms, 
because reducing firearm access may 
prevent suicides. Firearms in the 
home, regardless of whether they 
are kept unloaded or stored locked, 
are associated with a higher risk 
of completed adolescent suicide.8, 
9 
However, in another study examining 
firearm security, each of the practices 
of securing the firearm (keeping it 
locked and unloaded) and securing 
the ammunition (keeping it locked 
and stored away from the firearm) 
were associated with reduced risk 
of youth shootings that resulted in 
unintentional or self-inflicted injury 
or death.10
Youth seem to be at much greater 
risk from media exposure than adults 
and may imitate suicidal behavior 
seen on television.11 Media coverage 
of an adolescent’s suicide may lead to 
cluster suicides, with the magnitude 
of additional deaths proportional 
to the amount, duration, and 
prominence of the media coverage.11 
A prospective study found increased 
suicidality with exposure to the 
suicide of a schoolmate.12 Newspaper 
reports about suicide were associated 
with an increase in adolescent suicide 
clustering, with greater clustering 
associated with article front-page 
placement, mention of suicide or 
the method of suicide in the article 
title, and detailed description in 
the article text about the individual 
or the suicide act.13 More research 
is needed to determine the 
psychological mechanisms behind 
suicide clustering.14, 
15 The National 
Institute of Mental Health suggests 
best practices for media and online 
reporting of deaths by suicide.16
ADOLESCENTS AT INCREASED RISK
Although no specific tests are capable 
of identifying a suicidal person, 
specific risk factors exist.11, 
17 
The health care professional 
should use care in interpreting 
risk factors, however, because 
risk factors are common, whereas 
suicide is infrequent. Of importance, 
the lack of most risk factors does 
not make an adolescent safe from 
suicide. Fixed risk factors include: 
family history of suicide or suicide 
attempts; history of adoption18, 
19; 
male gender; parental mental health 
problems; lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
or questioning sexual orientation; 
transgender identification; a history 
of physical or sexual abuse; and a 
previous suicide attempt. Personal 
mental health problems that 
predispose to suicide include sleep 
disturbances, 
20 depression, bipolar 
disorder, substance intoxication and 
substance use disorders, psychosis, 
posttraumatic stress disorder, panic 
attacks, a history of aggression, 
impulsivity, severe anger, and 
pathologic Internet use (see Internet 
Use section). In particular, interview 
studies showed a marked higher 
rate of suicidal behavior with the 
presence of psychotic symptoms.21 
A prospective study found a 70-fold 
increase of acute suicidal behavior 
in adolescents with psychopathology 
that included psychosis.22 By 
definition, nonsuicidal self-injury 
(NSSI) does not include intent to 
die, and risk of death is deliberately 
low. Nonetheless, NSSI is a risk 
factor for suicide attempts23, 
24 and 
suicidal ideation.25 More than 90% 
of adolescent suicide victims met 
criteria for a psychiatric disorder 
before their death. Immediate risk 
factors include agitation, intoxication, 
and a recent stressful life event. 
More information is available from 
the American Academy of Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatry26 and Gould 
et al.11
Social and environmental risk 
factors include bullying, impaired 
parent–child relationship, living 
outside of the home (homeless or in 
a corrections facility or group home), 
difficulties in school, neither working 
nor attending school, social isolation, 
and presence of stressful life events, 
such as legal or romantic difficulties 
or an argument with a parent. An 
unsupported social environment 
for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and 
transgender adolescents, for 
example, increases risk of suicide 
attempts.27 Protective factors include 
religious involvement and connection 
between the adolescent and parents, 
school, and peers.26
Bullying
Bullying has been defined as 
having 3 elements: aggressive or 
deliberately harmful behavior (1) 
between peers that is (2) repeated 
and over time and (3) involves an 
imbalance of power, for example, 
related to physical strength or 
popularity, making it difficult for the 
victim to defend himself or herself.28 
Behavior falls into 4 categories: 
direct-physical (eg, assault, theft), 
direct-verbal (eg, threats, insults, 
name-calling), indirect-relational (eg, 
social exclusion, spreading rumors), 
and cyberbullying.29 The 2013 Youth 
Risk Behavior Survey of students in 
grades 9 through 12 in the United 
States indicated that during the 12 
months before the survey, 23.7% of 
girls and 15.6% of boys were bullied 
on school property, 21.0% of girls 
and 8.5% of boys were electronically 
bullied, and 8.7% of girls and 5.4% 
of boys did not go to school 1 day in 
the past 30 because they felt unsafe 
at or to or from school.7 Studies have 
focused on 3 groups: those who were

victims, those who were bullies, and 
those who were both victims and 
bullies (bully/victims).30
Reviewing 31 studies, Klomek 
et al29 found a clear relationship 
between both bullying victimization 
and perpetration and suicidal 
ideation and behavior in children 
and adolescents. Females were 
at risk regardless of frequency, 
whereas males were at higher risk 
only with frequent bullying. 
A review by Arseneault et al31 cited 
evidence that bullying victimization 
is associated with severe baseline 
psychopathology, as well as 
individual characteristics and family 
factors, and that the psychopathology 
is made significantly worse by the 
victimization. Being the victim of 
school bullying or cyberbullying 
is associated with substantial 
distress, resulting in lower 
school performance and school 
attachment.32 Suicidal ideation 
and behavior were greater in 
those bullied with controlling 
for age, gender, race/ethnicity, 
and depressive symptomology.33 
Suicidal ideation and behavior were 
increased in victims and bullies and 
were highest in bully/victims.34 
Similar increases in suicide attempts 
were found comparing face-to-face 
bullying with cyberbullying, both for 
victims and bullies.35
Bullying predicts future mental 
health problems. Bullying behavior 
at 8 years of age was associated 
with later suicide attempts and 
completed suicides, 
36 although 
among boys, frequent perpetration 
and victimization was not associated 
with attempts and completions 
after controlling for conduct and 
depressive symptoms. Among 
girls, frequent victimization was 
associated with later suicide 
attempts and completions even 
after controlling for conduct and 
depressive symptoms. High school 
students with the highest psychiatric 
impairment 4 years later were those 
who had been identified as at-risk for 
suicide and experiencing frequent 
bullying behavior. Copeland et al30 
found that children and adolescents 
involved in bullying behavior had 
the worst outcomes when they were 
both bullies and victims, leading to 
depression, anxiety, and suicidality 
(suicidality only among males) as 
adults. Assessment for adolescents 
with psychopathology, other signs 
of emotional distress, or unusual 
chronic complaints should include 
screening for participation in bullying 
as victims or bullies.
Internet Use
Pathologic Internet use correlates 
with suicidal ideation and NSSI.37 
Self-reported daily use of video 
games and Internet exceeding 5 
hours was strongly associated with 
higher levels of depression and 
suicidality (ideation and attempts) 
in adolescents.38 A more specific 
problem is that adolescents with 
suicidal ideation may be at particular 
risk for searching the Internet for 
information about suicide-related 
topics.39 Suicide-related searches 
were found to be associated with 
completed suicides among young 
adults.40 Prosuicide Web sites and 
online suicide pacts facilitate suicidal 
behavior, with adolescents and young 
adults at particular risk.37
A number of factors diminish the 
exposure of prosuicide Web sites. 
Web site results from the search 
term, “suicide, 
” are predominantly 
of institutional origin, with content 
largely related to research and 
prevention. Although there are a 
substantial number of sites from 
private senders (these sites are often 
antimedical, antitreatment, and 
pro-suicide, 
41 including sites that 
advocate suicide or describe methods 
in detail42), suicide research and 
prevention sites tend to come up in 
searches more commonly. Clicking 
on links within each site keeps the 
reader in the site, strengthening 
the site’s position. Methods sites 
and overtly prosuicide sites are 
more isolated, decentralized, and 
unfocused; these are less prevalent 
among the first 100 search results, 
perhaps related to a recent and 
deliberate strategy by the internet 
search engines (eg, search engine 
optimization).41
Learning of another's suicide 
online may be another risk factor 
for youth.43 Exposure to such 
information is through online news 
sites (44%), social networking 
sites (25%), online discussion 
forums (15%), and video Web sites 
(15%). Social networking sites have 
particular importance, because these 
may afford information on suicidal 
behavior of social contacts that 
would not otherwise be available. 
Fortunately, exposure to information 
from social networking sites does 
not appear related to changes in 
suicidal ideation, with increased 
exposure mitigated by greater social 
support. Participation in online 
forums, however, was associated 
with increases in suicidal ideation, 
possibly related to anonymous 
discussions about mental health 
problems. For example, suicide 
attempts by susceptible individuals 
appear to have been encouraged by 
such conversations.44, 
45
INTERVIEWING THE ADOLESCENT
Primary care pediatricians should 
be comfortable screening patients 
for suicide, mood disorders, and 
substance abuse and dependence. 
Ask about emotional difficulties and 
use of drugs and alcohol, identify 
lack of developmental progress, and 
estimate level of distress, impairment 
of functioning, and level of danger to 
self and others. Depression screening 
instruments shown to be valid in 
adolescents include the Patient 
Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 and 
PHQ-2.46 If needed, a referral should 
be made for appropriate mental 
health evaluation and treatment. In 
areas where the resources necessary 
to make a timely mental health 
e3

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
referral are lacking, pediatricians are 
encouraged to obtain extra training 
and become competent in providing a 
more in-depth assessment.
Suicidal ideation may be assessed 
by directly asking or screening via 
self-report. Self-administered scales 
can be useful for screening, because 
adolescents may disclose information 
about suicidality on self-report 
that they deny in person. Scales, 
however, tend to be oversensitive 
and underspecific and lack predictive 
value. Adolescents who endorse 
suicidality on a scale should be 
assessed clinically. Screening tools 
useable in a primary care setting 
have not been shown to have more 
than limited ability to detect suicide 
risk in adolescents, 
47 consistent with 
the findings of an earlier review.48 
Instruments studied in adolescent 
groups with high prevalence of 
suicidal ideation and behavior 
showed sensitivity of 52% to 87% 
and specificity of 60% to 85%; 
the results are only generalizable 
to high-risk populations.49, 
50 
Suicide screening, at least in the 
school setting, does not appear to 
cause thoughts of suicide or other 
psychiatric symptoms in 
students.51, 
52
One approach to initiate a 
confidential inquiry into suicidal 
thoughts or concerns is to ask a 
general question, such as, “Have you 
ever thought about killing yourself or 
wished you were dead?” The question 
is best placed in the middle or toward 
the end of a list of questions about 
depressive symptoms. Regardless of 
the answer, the next question should 
be, “Have you ever done anything 
on purpose to hurt or kill yourself?” 
If the response to either question 
is positive, the pediatrician should 
obtain more detail (eg, nature of past 
and present thoughts and behaviors, 
time frame, intent, who knows and 
how they found out). Inquiry should 
include suicide plans (“If you were to 
kill yourself, how would you do it?”), 
whether there are firearms in the 
home, and the response of the family. 
No data indicate that inquiry about 
suicide precipitates the behavior, 
even in high-risk students.51
The adolescent should be 
interviewed separately from the 
parent, because the patient may be 
more likely to withhold important 
information in the parent’s presence. 
Information should also be sought 
from parents and others as 
appropriate. Although confidentiality 
is important in adolescent health 
care, for adolescents at risk to 
themselves or others, safety takes 
precedence over confidentiality; 
the adolescent should have this 
explained by the pediatrician so 
that he or she understands that at 
the onset. Pediatricians need to 
inform appropriate people, such 
as parent(s) and other providers, 
when they believe an adolescent is 
at risk for suicide and to share with 
the adolescent that there is a need 
to break confidentiality because of 
the risk of harm to the adolescent. 
As much as is possible, the sequence 
of events that preceded the threat 
should be determined, current 
problems and conflicts should 
be identified, and the degree of 
suicidal intent should be assessed. 
In addition, pediatricians should 
assess individual coping resources, 
accessible support systems, and 
attitudes of the adolescent and family 
toward intervention and follow-up.53 
Questions should also be asked to 
elicit known risk factors. Note that 
it is acceptable and, in some cases, 
more appropriate for the patient 
to be referred to a mental health 
specialist to access the degree of 
suicide intent and relevant factors 
such as coping mechanisms and 
support systems.
Care in interviewing needs to be 
taken, because abrupt, intrusive 
questions could result in a reduction 
of rapport and a lower likelihood 
of the adolescent sharing mental 
health concerns. This is especially 
true during a brief encounter for an 
unrelated concern. Initial questions 
should be open-ended and relatively 
nonthreatening. Examples include 
“Aside from [already stated non–
mental health concern], how have 
you been doing?” “I know that a lot of 
people your age have a lot going on. 
What kinds of things have been on 
your mind or stressing you lately?” 
“How have things been going with 
[school, friends, parents, sports]?” 
When possible, more detailed 
questions should then follow, 
particularly during routine care visits 
or when a mental health concern is 
stated or suspected.
Suicidal thoughts or comments 
should never be dismissed as 
unimportant. Statements such as, 
“You’ve come really close to killing 
yourself, 
” may, if true, acknowledge 
the deep despair of the youth and 
communicate to the adolescent that 
the interviewer understands how 
serious he or she has felt about dying. 
Such disclosures should be met with 
reassurance that the patient’s pleas 
for assistance have been heard and 
that help will be sought.
Serious mood disorders, such 
as major depressive disorder or 
bipolar disorder, may present in 
adolescents in several ways.54 Some 
adolescents may come to the office 
with complaints similar to those of 
depressed adults, having symptoms, 
such as sad or down feelings most 
of the time, crying spells, guilty 
or worthless feelings, markedly 
diminished interest or pleasure in 
most activities, significant weight 
loss or weight gain or increase or 
decrease in appetite, insomnia or 
hypersomnia, fatigue or loss of 
energy, diminished ability to think or 
concentrate, and thoughts of death 
or suicide. The pediatrician should 
also look for adolescent behaviors 
that are characteristic of symptoms 
(Table 1).54 Some adolescents may 
present with irritability rather 
than depressed mood as the main 
manifestation. Other adolescents 
present for an acute care visit

with somatic symptoms, such as 
abdominal pain, chest pain, headache, 
lethargy, weight loss, dizziness 
and syncope, or other nonspecific 
symptoms55 Others present with 
behavioral problems, such as 
truancy, deterioration in academic 
performance, running away from 
home, defiance of authorities, self-
destructive behavior, vandalism, 
substance use disorder, sexual acting 
out, and delinquency.56 Typically, 
symptoms of depression, mania, or a 
mixed state (depression and mania 
coexisting or rapidly alternating) can 
be elicited with careful questioning 
but may not be immediately obvious. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) provides more information 
about adolescent bipolar disorder 
and the role of the pediatrician 
in screening, diagnosis, and 
management.57
At well-adolescent visits, adolescents 
who show any evidence of 
psychosocial or adaptive difficulties 
should be assessed regularly for 
mental health concerns and also 
asked about suicidal ideation, 
physical and sexual abuse, 
bullying, substance use, and sexual 
orientation. Depression screening 
is now recommended for all 
adolescents between the ages of 
11 and 21 years of age in the third 
edition of Bright Futures.58 The AAP 
developed a resource, “Addressing 
Mental Health Concerns in Primary 
Care: A Clinician’s Toolkit, 
” which 
is available for a fee.59 The AAP 
also developed a Web site that 
provides resources and materials 
free of charge.60 Identification and 
screening at acute care visits, when 
possible, is desirable, because mental 
health problems may manifest more 
strongly at these times.
MANAGEMENT OF THE SUICIDAL 
ADOLESCENT
Management depends on the degree 
of acute risk. Unfortunately, no one 
can accurately predict suicide, so 
even experts can only determine 
who is at higher risk. Intent is a 
key issue in the determination of 
risk. Examples of adolescents at 
high risk include: those with a plan 
or recent suicide attempt with a 
high probability of lethality; stated 
current intent to kill themselves; 
recent suicidal ideation or behavior 
accompanied by current agitation or 
severe hopelessness; and impulsivity 
and profoundly dysphoric mood 
associated with bipolar disorder, 
major depression, psychosis, or a 
substance use disorder. An absence 
of factors that indicate high risk, 
especially in the presence of a desire 
to receive help and a supportive 
family, suggests a lower risk but not 
necessarily a low risk. Low risk is 
difficult to determine. For example, 
an adolescent who has taken 8 
ibuprofen tablets may have thought 
that it was a lethal dose and may 
do something more lethal the next 
time. Alternatively, the adolescent 
may have known that 8 ibuprofen 
tablets is not lethal and took the pills 
as a rehearsal for a lethal attempt. 
In the presence of a recent suicide 
attempt, the lack of current suicidal 
ideation may also be misleading if 
none of the factors that led to the 
attempt have changed or the reasons 
for the attempt are not understood. 
The benefit of the doubt is generally 
on safety in the management of the 
suicidal adolescent.
The term “suicide gesture” should 
not be used, because it implies a 
low risk of suicide that may not 
be warranted. “Suicide attempt” is 
a more appropriate term for any 
deliberately self-harmful behavior 
or action that could reasonably be 
expected to produce self-harm and 
is accompanied by some degree of 
intent or desire for death as well as 
thinking by the patient at the time of 
the behavior that the behavior had 
even a small possibility of resulting 
in death. In a less-than-forthcoming 
patient, intent may be inferred by 
the lethality of the behavior, such 
as ingesting a large number of pills, 
or by an affirmative answer to a 
question such as, “At the time of your 
action, would you have thought it 
okay if you had died?”
Adolescents who initially may seem 
at low risk, joke about suicide, or 
seek treatment of repeated somatic 
complaints may be asking for help 
the only way they can. Their concerns 
should be assessed thoroughly. 
Adolescents who are judged to be at 
low risk of suicide should still receive 
close follow-up, referral for a timely 
mental health evaluation, or both 
if they should have any significant 
degree of dysfunction or distress 
from emotional or behavioral 
symptoms.

For adolescents who seem to 
be at moderate or high risk of 
suicide or have attempted suicide, 
arrangements for immediate mental 
health professional evaluation should 
be made during the office visit. 
Options for immediate evaluation 
include hospitalization, transfer 
to an emergency department, or a 
same-day appointment with a mental 
health professional.
Intervention should be tailored to 
the adolescent’s needs. Adolescents 
with a responsive and supportive 
family, little likelihood of acting 
on suicidal impulses (eg, thought 
of dying with no intent or plan for 
suicide), and someone who can take 
action if there is mood or behavior 
deterioration may require only 
outpatient treatment.17 In contrast, 
adolescents who have made previous 
attempts, exhibit a high degree 
of intent to commit suicide, show 
evidence of serious depression or 
other psychiatric illness, engage 
in substance use or have an active 
substance use disorder, have low 
impulse control, or have families who 
are unwilling to commit to counseling 
are at high risk and may require 
psychiatric hospitalization.
Although no controlled studies 
have been conducted to prove that 
admitting adolescents at high risk 
to a psychiatric unit saves lives, 
17 
likely the safest course of action is 
hospitalization, thereby placing the 
adolescent in a safe and protected 
environment. An inpatient stay will 
allow time for a complete medical 
and psychiatric evaluation with 
initiation of therapy in a controlled 
setting as well as arrangement of 
appropriate mental health follow-up 
care.
Pediatricians can enhance continuity 
of care and adherence to treatment 
recommendations by maintaining 
contact with suicidal adolescents 
even after referrals are made. 
Collaborative care is encouraged, 
because it has been shown to result 
in greater reduction of depressive 
symptoms in a primary care setting.61 
Recommendations should include 
that all firearms are removed from 
the home, because adolescents 
may still find access to locked guns 
stored in their home, and that 
medications, both prescription and 
over-the-counter, are locked up. 
Vigorous treatment of the underlying 
psychiatric disorder is important in 
decreasing short-term and long-term 
risk of suicide. Although asking the 
adolescent to agree to a contract 
against suicide has not been proven 
effective in preventing suicidal 
behavior, 
17 the technique may still 
be helpful in assessing risk in that 
refusal to agree either not to harm 
oneself or to tell a specified person 
about intent to harm oneself is 
ominous. In addition, safety planning 
may help guide a patient and his 
or her family in what steps to take 
in moments of distress to ensure 
patient safety.
Working with a suicidal adolescent 
can be very difficult for those who 
are providing treatment. Suicide 
risk can only be reduced, not 
eliminated, and risk factors provide 
no more than guidance. Much of the 
information regarding risk factors 
is subjective and must be elicited 
from the adolescent, who may 
have his or her own agenda. Just as 
importantly, pediatricians need to be 
aware of their personal reactions to 
prevent interference in evaluation 
and treatment and overreaction or 
underreaction.
ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS AND 
SUICIDE
The Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) directive of October 2004 
and heavy media coverage changed 
perceptions of antidepressant 
medications, and not favorably. 
The FDA directed pharmaceutical 
companies to label all antidepressant 
medications distributed in the United 
States with a “black-box warning” 
to alert health care providers to 
an increased risk of suicidality 
(suicidal thinking and behavior) 
in children and adolescents being 
treated with these agents. The FDA 
did not prohibit the use of these 
medications in youth but called 
on clinicians to balance increased 
risk of suicidality with clinical need 
and to monitor closely “for clinical 
worsening, suicidality, or unusual 
changes in behavior.”62 The warning 
particularly stressed the need for 
close monitoring during the first few 
months of treatment and after dose 
changes.
The warning by the FDA was 
prompted by a finding that in 24 
clinical trials that involved more than 
4400 child and adolescent patients 
and 9 different antidepressant 
medications, spontaneously reported 
suicidal ideation or behavior was 
present in 4% of subjects who were 
receiving medication and in just 
half that (2%) of subjects who were 
receiving a placebo. No completed 
suicides occurred during any of the 
studies. In the same studies, however, 
only a slight reduction of suicidality 
was found when subjects were asked 
directly at each visit about suicidal 
ideation and behavior, which was 
considered a contradictory finding. 
The method of asking directly does 
not rely on spontaneous reports and 
is considered to be more reliable 
than the spontaneous events report 
method used by the FDA to support 
the black-box warning.63 In addition, 
a reanalysis of the data including 
7 additional studies and using a 
more conservative model showed 
only a trivial 0.7% increase in the 
risk of suicidal ideation or behavior 
in those receiving antidepressant 
medications.64
Subsequent studies have addressed 
the validity of the black-box warning 
and suggest that, for appropriate 
youth, the risk of not prescribing 
antidepressant medication is 
significantly higher than the risk of 
prescribing. Gibbons et al65 conducted 
a reanalysis of all sponsor-conducted

randomized controlled trials of 
fluoxetine and venlafaxine, which 
included 12 adult, 4 geriatric, and 
4 youth studies of fluoxetine and 
21 adult trials of venlafaxine. Adult 
and geriatric patients treated with 
both medications showed decreased 
suicidal thoughts and behaviors, an 
effect mediated by the decreases of 
depressive symptoms with treatment. 
No significant treatment effect on 
suicidal thoughts and behaviors 
was found with youth treated with 
fluoxetine, although depressive 
symptoms in fluoxetine-treated 
patients decreased more quickly 
than symptoms in patients receiving 
placebo. There was no overall 
greater rate of suicidal thoughts and 
behaviors in the treatment groups 
versus the placebo groups. The finding 
of increased suicidal ideation and 
behavior in the treatment groups 
that formed the basis of the FDA 
black-box warning on antidepressant 
use in children and adolescents was 
not found in this reanalysis of the 
fluoxetine studies. More importantly, 
these reanalyses demonstrated the 
efficacy of fluoxetine in the treatment 
of depression in youth. Patients in all 
age and drug groups had significantly 
greater improvement relative to 
patients in placebo groups, with youth 
having the largest differential rate of 
remission over 6 weeks—46.6% of 
patients receiving fluoxetine versus 
16.5% of those receiving placebo.66
Suicidal ideation and behavior are 
common, and suicides are vastly less 
common, which makes it difficult to 
relate a change in one to a change in 
the other.63 Examining all available 
observational studies, Dudley et al67 
found that recent exposure to 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor 
medications was rare (1.6%) for 
young people who died by suicide, 
supporting the conclusion that most 
of the suicide victims did not have the 
potential benefit of antidepressants 
at the time of their deaths. The 
study suggests that whether 
antidepressants increase suicidal 
thoughts or behaviors in adolescents, 
few actual suicides are related to 
current use of the medications.
Several studies showed a negative 
correlation between antidepressant 
prescribing and completed adolescent 
suicide. The 28% decrease in 
completed suicides in the 10- to 
19-year-old age group from 1990 to 
2000 may have been at least partly 
a result of the increase in youth 
antidepressant prescribing over 
the same time period. Analyzing US 
data by examining prescribing and 
suicide in each of 588 2-digit zip 
code zones showed a significant 
(P < .001) 0.23-per-100 000 annual 
decrease in adolescent suicide with 
every 1% increase in antidepressant 
prescribing.68 A second study 
analyzed county-level data during 
the period from1996 to1998 and 
found that higher selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor prescription rates 
significantly correlated with lower 
suicide rates among children and 
adolescents 5 to 14 years of age.69 
Using a decision analysis model, 
Cougnard et al70 calculated that 
antidepressant treatment of children 
and adolescents would prevent 31.9% 
of suicides of depressed subjects, 
similar to findings in the adult (32.2%) 
and geriatric (32.3%) age groups.
The FDA advisory panel was aware 
that the black-box warning could 
have the unintended effect of limiting 
access to necessary and effective 
treatment63 and reported that 
prescriptions of antidepressants for 
children and adolescents decreased 
by 19% in the third quarter of 2004 
and 16% in the fourth quarter 
compared with the year before.71 
Claims data for Tennessee Medicaid 
showed a 33% reduction of new 
users of antidepressants 21 months 
after the black-box warning.72 US 
national managed care data showed 
reduced diagnosing of pediatric 
depression and a 58% reduction of 
antidepressant prescribing compared 
with what was predicted by the 
preadvisory trend.73 Decreased 
antidepressant prescribing was 
also seen with chart review.74 Most 
of the reductions in diagnosing 
and prescribing were related to 
substantial reductions by primary 
care providers, with these reductions 
persisting through 2007.75 Studies 
differed as to whether there was76 or 
was not73, 
74 a compensatory increase 
of psychotherapy treatment during 
the same time period.
Concern was expressed that 
the reduction of antidepressant 
prescribing may be related to the 
increase in US youth suicides from 
2003 to 2004 after a decade of steady 
declines.77 Gibbons et al78 found 
that antidepressant prescribing for 
youth decreased by 22% in both the 
United States and the Netherlands 
the year after the black-box warnings 
in both countries and a reduction 
in prescribing was observed across 
all ages. From 2003 to 2004, the 
youth suicide rate in the United 
States increased by 14%; from 2003 
to 2005, the youth suicide rate in 
the Netherlands increased by 49%. 
Across age groups, data showed 
a significant inverse correlation 
between prescribing and change in 
suicide rate. The authors suggested 
that the warnings could have had the 
unintended effect of increasing the 
rate of youth suicide.78 Examining 
health insurance claims data for 
1.1 million adolescents, 1.4 million 
young adults, and 5 million adults, 
the rate of psychotropic medication 
poisonings, a validate proxy for 
suicide attempts, was found to have 
increased significantly in adolescents 
(21.7%) and young adults (33.7%), 
but not in adults (5.2%), in the second 
year after the FDA black-box warning, 
corresponding with decreases 
in antidepressant prescribing 
(adolescents, –31.0%; young adults, 
–24.3%; adults, –14.5%).79
Regardless of whether the use of 
antidepressant medications changes 
the risk of suicide, depression is an

important suicide risk factor, and 
careful monitoring of adolescents’ 
mental health and behavioral status 
is critically important, particularly 
when initiating or changing 
treatment. Furthermore, despite the 
aforementioned new information, the 
FDA has not removed or changed the 
black-box warning; the warning should 
be discussed with parents or guardians 
and appropriately documented. The 
American Psychiatric Association and 
the American Academy of Child and 
Adolescent Psychiatry recommended 
a monitoring approach63 that enlists 
the parents or guardians in the 
responsibility for monitoring and 
individualizing the frequency and 
nature of monitoring to the needs 
of the patient and the family. This 
approach potentially increases the 
effectiveness of monitoring and 
provides greater flexibility, thus 
reducing a barrier to prescribing. 
Warning signs for family members to 
contact the prescribing physician are 
listed in Table 2.63
SUMMARY
1. Adolescent suicide is an important 
public health problem.
2. Knowledge of risk factors, 
particularly mood disorders, 
psychosis, and bullying 
victimization and perpetration, 
may assist in the identification 
of adolescents who are at higher 
risk.
3. It is important to know and 
use appropriate techniques for 
interviewing potentially suicidal 
adolescents.
4. Mood disorders predisposing 
adolescents to suicide have a 
variety of presentations.
5. Management options depend on 
the degree of suicide risk.
6. Treatment with antidepressant 
medication is important when 
indicated.
ADVICE FOR PEDIATRICIANS
1. Ask questions about mood 
disorders, use of drugs and 
alcohol, suicidal thoughts, 
bullying, sexual orientation, and 
other risk factors associated 
with suicide in routine history 
taking throughout adolescence. 
Know the risk factors (eg, signs 
and symptoms of depression) 
associated with adolescent 
suicide and screen routinely for 
depression. Consider using a 
depression screening instrument, 
such as the PHQ-9 or PHQ-2, at 
health maintenance visits from 11 
to 21 years of age and as needed at 
acute care visits.46
2. Educate yourself and your 
patients about the benefits 
and risks of antidepressant 
medications. Patients with 
depression should be carefully 
monitored, with appropriately 
frequent appointments and 
education of the family 
regarding warning signs for 
when to call you, especially after 
the initiation of antidepressant 
medication treatment and 
with dose changes. Recent 
studies suggest that, for 
appropriate youth, the benefits 
of antidepressant medications 
outweigh the risks.
3. Recognize the medical and 
psychiatric needs of the suicidal 
adolescent and work closely 
with families and health care 
professionals involved in the 
management and follow-up of 
youth who are at risk or have 
attempted suicide. Develop 
working relationships with 
emergency departments 
and colleagues in child and 
adolescent psychiatry, clinical 
psychology, and other mental 
health professions to optimally 
evaluate and manage the care 
of adolescents who are at risk 
for suicide. Because mental and 
physical health services are 
often provided through different 
systems of care, extra effort 
is necessary to ensure good 
communication, continuity, and 
follow-up through the medical 
home.
4. Because resources for 
adolescents and physicians vary 
by community, become familiar 
with local, state, and national 
resources that are concerned with 
treatment of psychopathology 
and suicide prevention in youth, 
including local hospitals with 
psychiatric units, mental health 
agencies, family and children’s 
services, crisis hotlines, and crisis 
intervention centers. Compile the 
names and contact information 
of local mental health resources 
and providers and make that 
information available to patients/
families when needed.
5. Because there is great variation 
among general pediatricians 
in training and comfort with 
assessing and treating patients 
with mental health problems, as 
well as in access to appropriate 
mental health resources, consider 
additional training and ongoing 
education in diagnosing and 
managing adolescent mood 
disorders, especially if practicing 
in an underserved area.

Pediatricians with fewer resources 
still have an important role in 
screening, comanaging with 
mental health professionals, and 
referring patients when necessary 
(as recommended in Bright 
Futures, Fourth Edition).
6. During routine evaluations and 
where consistent with state 
law, ask whether firearms are 
kept in the home and discuss 
with parents the increased risk 
of adolescent suicide with the 
presence of firearms. Specifically 
for adolescents at risk for 
suicide, advise parents to remove 
guns and ammunition from 
the house and secure supplies 
of prescription and over-the-
counter medications.
