Osteoporosis is characterised by trabecular bone loss resulting from increased osteoclast activation 
and unbalanced coupling between resorption and formation, which induces a thinning of trabeculae 
and trabecular perforations. Bisphosphonates are the frontline therapy for osteoporosis, which act 
by reducing bone remodelling, and are thought to prevent perforations and maintain microstructure. 
However, bisphosphonates may oversuppress remodelling resulting in accumulation of microcracks. 
This paper aims to investigate the effect of bisphosphonate treatment on microstructure and 
mechanical strength. Assessment of microdamage within the trabecular bone core was performed 
using synchrotron X-ray micro-CT linked to image analysis software. Bone from bisphosphonate-
treated fracture patients exhibited fewer perforations but more numerous and larger microcracks than 
both fracture and non-fracture controls. Furthermore, bisphosphonate-treated bone demonstrated 
reduced tensile strength and Young’s Modulus. These findings suggest that bisphosphonate therapy 
is effective at reducing perforations but may also cause microcrack accumulation, leading to a loss of 
microstructural integrity and consequently, reduced mechanical strength.
Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disorder affecting 200 million people worldwide, with a high prevalence in the 
ageing population1. Osteoporosis increases the risk of fragility fracture2–6, and is estimated to contribute to 8.9 mil-
lion fractures annually7. Fractures, which commonly occur at the hip and spine8,9 result in disability, mortality and 
high healthcare costs, thereby placing a huge strain on the healthcare system10. The treatment of osteoporosis costs 
nearly $17 billion per year in the United States11 and €37 billion per year in the European Union12. With the rise 
in life expectancy, the incidence and cost of fragility fractures are projected to increase even further in the future.
Osteoporosis is characterised by a loss of bone mass and can be defined clinically using dual X-ray absorp-
tiometry (DXA) as a T-score less than 2.5 standard deviations below the mean bone mineral density (BMD) in 
young adults13,14. Although osteoporosis causes bone to become fragile, studies have shown a poor correlation 
between osteoporosis, as defined by DXA, and the occurrence of fractures in the ageing population15,16. It is 
evident that more than half of these individuals who suffer from fractures do not meet the clinical diagnosis of 
osteoporosis17. These findings have led to the emergence of the concept of bone quality, which is now widely 
accepted as a key element in understanding bone fragility, in addition to bone mass18,19. Bone quality refers to 
the material and structural properties of bone that make it resistant to fracture including bone turnover, collagen 
and mineral matrix, microarchitecture and accumulated microdamage6. These factors are all thought to play a 
significant role in the development of fragility fractures20–23 and are therefore relevant for understanding the 
efficacy of treatment.

Bisphosphonates such as alendronate, risedronate and zoledronate are potent antiresorptive agents that form 
the first-line pharmacotherapy for the treatment of osteoporosis, with over 190 million prescriptions issued each 
year24,25. In osteoporosis, there is increased osteoclast activity leading to excessive thinning of trabeculae and the 
formation of perforations, which contributes to increased bone fragility26. Trabecular perforation is caused by 
osteoclasts resorbing a cavity so deep that it cannot be refilled by osteoblasts27. Consequently, there is loss of tra-
becular connectivity which is one of the key determinants of the mechanical strength of bone28. Bisphosphonates 
are known to inhibit osteoclasts and increase BMD, thereby conferring a reduction in fracture risk29–32. It has also 
been suggested that bisphosphonate-inhibition of osteoclasts will restrict the formation of perforations33. Studies 
have shown bisphosphonates to be capable of reducing bone turnover by up to 90%, which persists throughout 
the duration of treatment and may reduce the risk of hip fractures by between 30–50%34–36.
Over the past decade, concerns have been raised by clinicians and researchers regarding the oversuppresion 
of remodelling caused by long-term bisphosphonate therapy, which may predispose the patient to fractures37–42. 
Indeed, there have been reports of spontaneous non-vertebral fractures associated with a substantial reduction 
in bone turnover in patients on long-term bisphosphonate therapy43. It has been suggested that bisphosphonate 
treatment causes an oversuppression of remodeling, resulting in the accumulation of microdamage, which com-
promises the mechanical properties of bone43,44. This is evident in both animal and human studies, where concur-
rent bisphosphonate therapy is associated with microdamage45–47. Research on the micro- and nano-structure of 
bone have reported an inverse relationship between the amount of microdamage and the mechanical strength48–50. 
Recently, Zimmermann et al. found bisphosphonate-treated bone to have reduced tissue strength compared to 
healthy bone6. However, no studies in humans have directly correlated the microstructural changes following 
bisphosphonate therapy with the mechanical properties. Thus, the present study aims to investigate the effect of 
bisphosphonate therapy on trabecular microstructure, including perforations and microcracks, and correlate this 
with the mechanical strength of bone.
Materials and Methods
Sample preparation. 
Trabecular bone samples were harvested from the femoral heads of three individ-
ual cohorts: a bisphosphonate-treated fracture group, an untreated fracture control group and a healthy ageing 
non-fracture control group. The fracture group samples were obtained from patients who underwent hip arthro-
plasty surgery for femoral neck fractures at Imperial College Healthcare National Health Service Trust in London, 
United Kingdom, while the non-fracture group samples were acquired from cadavers. All individuals with a his-
tory of primary bone disease or an underlying disorder such as cancer, which could lead to secondary bone dis-
ease were excluded from this study. The Imperial College Tissue Bank (R13004) granted ethical approval for the 
study and patients consented to the use of their tissue for research. All procedures performed in studies involving 
human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research 
committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. A 
total of 21 samples were attained; eight from bisphosphonate-treated fracture patients (seven females; one male) 
(Table 1), eight from untreated fracture patients (seven females; one male) and five from cadavers of healthy 
ageing non-fracture individuals (four females; one male). The mean age of individuals was 79.3 ± 6.4 years in the 
bisphosphonate-treated group, 77.8 ± 
 3.4 years in the untreated fracture group and 77.8 ± 
 4.9 years in the healthy 
ageing non-fracture group. There was no significant difference present between the groups (One-Way ANOVA 
F = 
 0.5236, p = 
 0.644). Twenty-one cylindrical cores, 10 mm in height and 7 mm in diameter were taken from the 
region directly superior to the trabecular chiasma in the primary compressive trabecular arcade of the femoral 
heads. The cores were stored at − 
80 °C and only removed from storage for testing.
Synchrotron X-ray micro-CT Experiment. 
Due to the limited experiment time with the synchro-
tron, imaging was carried out on only 16 of the cylindrical cores (Fig. 1a). This was done with synchrotron 
X-ray micro-CT using Beamline I1251 at Diamond Light Source, United Kingdom. Six cores were from 
the bisphosphonate-treated group, five from the untreated fracture group and five from the healthy ageing 
non-fracture group. The key setting parameters used were: X-ray beam 53 KeV, image volume 23.3 mm3, voxel 
size 1.3 μ 
m/voxel, 6400 projections, 180° rotation. Tomographic images were reconstructed using the in-house 
software, DAWN52,53 (Fig. 1b), which were linked to the image analysis software packages ImageJ (National 
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, United States of America) and VGStudio MAX (Heidelberg, Germany) for quan-
tification of the trabecular microstructure (Fig. 1c,d).

Mechanical Uni-Axial Tensile Experiment. 
Twenty-one rectangular-shaped standard tensile testing 
samples were obtained from the region immediately adjacent to the harvest region of the aforementioned cylin-
drical cores. The specimens were 11 mm in height, 2.8 mm in width, and 1 mm depth. The ends of each sample 
were potted in bone cement, which served as clamps and stored at −80° C till testing. During tensile testing, 
the samples were kept hydrated in the fluid chamber built into the micromechanical device54. All 21 specimens 
underwent load-controlled tensile testing with a fixed strain rate at 0.001 s−1 using a custom-built micromechan-
ical test rig, which was designed as part of earlier work54. The tests were conducted at room temperature. After 
loading, the stress-strain curves were examined to identify the Young’s Modulus and ultimate tensile strength, 
which were normalised according to trabecular bone volume. Tensile testing was considered more effective for 
assessing microcracks.
Microdamage Definition. 
The features of microdamage visualised on synchrotron X-ray micro-CT scans 
were classified as either perforations27 or microcracks55,56. Perforations27 are regions of complete breakage in the 
bone trabeculae, which are due to osteoclastic activity (Fig. 2a,b). In contrast, microcracks55 are microscopic frac-
tures with a typical linear shape and sharp edges ranging between 30–100 μ 
m in length (Fig. 2c,d).
Microdamage Assessment. 
The volume analysed was 3.28 mm in diameter and 2.76 mm in height. This 
was done to avoid artefactual damage caused by the drilling process57. The region of interest was identified with 
an automated segmentation technique using a global threshold as described by Larrue et al.18. The scans were 
inspected to qualify and quantify the microdamage present in both 2D and 3D. In total, 1000 continuous slices 
were individually examined in three planes (Fig. 1c). Regions of microdamage were then segmented manually 
with localised threshold values for 3D assessment of volume as determined by the assessors who were blinded to 
the groups. To account for interindividual error when assessing microdamage, two independent assessors exam-
ined the CT slices (E.L.G. and B.P.). There was very high reproducibility, with an r2 value of 0.920 for the corre-
lation between both assessors (Pearson’s correlation coefficient p = 
 0.010). Assessment of the scans was repeated 
three times by both assessors to minimise intraindividual error and data from the final assessment was used. In 
case of disagreement, a consensual decision between the two assessors was reached, with involvement of a third 
independent assessor (S.M.).
Assessment Parameters. 
Trabecular bone volume fraction, microdamage density, microdamage volume, 
microdamage volume fraction, Young’s Modulus and ultimate tensile strength of the samples were calculated. 
Microdamage density and microdamage volume fraction were calculated as the frequency of microdamage and 
the volume of microdamage divided by the trabecular bone volume respectively. Microdamage density was used 
to compare the amount of microcracks and perforations across the non-fracture control, fracture control and 
bisphosphonate-treated groups. Meanwhile, microdamage volume was used to compare the size of microcracks 
and perforations across the three groups. The apparent mechanical data were divided by trabecular bone volume 
fraction to normalise the Young’s Modulus and ultimate tensile strength, which was to ensure a fair and valid 
comparison.

Statistics. 
There were no relevant assumptions to construct a hypothesis for the effect size of long-term bis-
phosphonate treatment on microdamage accumulation in the femoral head trabecular bone cores in this study. 
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 23 (Armonk, New York) and the graphs were gen-
erated with GraphPad Prism 7 (San Diego, California). The data were assessed for normality using a Q-Q plot 
and Shapiro-Wilk test, and were found to follow a non-Gaussian distribution. Consequently, the results were 
presented as median and interquartile range. Non-parametric descriptive statistics and tests used included the 
Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests.
Results
The fracture control group had the highest density of perforations across all groups (p = 
 0.040). This was sig-
nificantly higher than the non-fracture group but was not significant compared to the bisphosphonate-treated 
group (Fig. 3a). Similarly, the fracture control group displayed the largest volume of perforations, followed by the 
bisphosphonate-treated and the non-fracture control group (p = 
 0.030). These differences were all statistically 
significant (Fig. 3c). The fracture group also had the highest perforation volume fraction, which was statistically 
significant compared to the other two groups (p = 0.0150) (Fig. 3e).
The bisphosphonate-treated group had the highest density of microcracks compared to the fracture and 
non-fracture control groups, which was statistically significant (p = 
 0.010) (Fig. 3b). Both the fracture and 
non-fracture control groups had a comparable density of microcracks. Moreover, the bisphosphonate-treated 
group had the largest volume of microcracks, followed by the fracture and non-fracture control groups 
(p = 0.001). This difference was significant compared to the non-fracture control group but not the fracture con-
trol group. The volume of microcracks in the bisphosphonate-treated group was also significantly greater com-
pared to the non-fracture control group (p = 0.004) (Fig. 3d). Meanwhile, the bisphosphonate-treated group had 
the highest microcrack volume fraction compared to the fracture and non-fracture groups (p = 0.020) (Fig. 3f).
The trabecular bone volume fraction in the healthy aging non-fracture group was 0.344 ± 
 0.030. This was 
significantly higher than the untreated fracture group at 0.241 ± 
 0.025 (p = 
 0.001) but not compared to the 
bisphosphonate-treated fracture group at 0.288 ± 
 0.069. The overall stress-strain curves with the 95% confi-
dence intervals across the three groups were generated (Fig. 4). Data for the apparent (Fig. 5a,b) and normal-
ised (Fig. 5c,d) ultimate tensile strength and Young’s Modulus displayed a similar trend. The bone volume 
normalised ultimate tensile strength was the highest in the non-fracture group, followed by the fracture and 
bisphosphonate-treated groups. Statistically significant differences were present between all the groups 
(p = 
 0.001) (Fig. 5c). Additionally, the bisphosphonate therapy group showed a significantly lower normalised 
Young’s Modulus compared to the fracture and non-fracture groups (p = 0.030) (Fig. 5d).

Discussion
This is the first study to investigate and compare the morphology of microdamage in healthy, osteoporotic and 
bisphosphonate-treated bone using synchrotron X-ray micro-CT and image segmentation technology. Trabecular 
microdamage and mechanical strength were compared across the three groups. Bone from the fracture con-
trol group exhibited the highest density of perforations across the three groups. Meanwhile, bone from the 
bisphosphonate-treated group demonstrated the highest density of microcracks. Microcracks were typically larger 
in bone from the bisphosphonate-treated group, while perforations were larger in bone from the fracture control 
group. Accordingly, the bisphosphonate-treated and fracture control groups had the highest microcrack and 
perforation volume fractions, respectively. Bone from the non-fracture control group had the highest normalised 
Young’s Modulus and tensile strength, followed by bone from the fracture control and bisphosphonate-treated 
groups.
A limitation of the study was the small sample size: 16 trabecular bone cores and 21 rectangular tensile sam-
ples were investigated. In addition, synchrotron X-ray micro-CT has the potential to cause radiation damage,

perforations and microcracks in the non-fracture control (n = 5), fracture control (n = 5) and bisphosphonate 
therapy groups (n = 6). (a) The fracture group had the highest density of perforations at 3.92/mm3 across all 
groups but this was only significant compared to the non-fracture group (p = 0.005). (b) The bisphosphonate 
therapy group had a significantly higher microcrack density at 7.38/mm3 compared to the other two groups 
(fracture p = 0.007, non-fracture p = 0.012). (c) The fracture group had a significantly larger volume of 
perforations at 24863 μ 
m3 compared to other two groups (bisphosphonate therapy p = 0.011, non-fracture 
p = 0.012). The bisphosphonate therapy group also showed a significantly higher volume of perforations at 
15893 μ 
m3 compared to the non-fracture group at 4220 μ 
m3 (p = 0.019). (d) The bisphosphonate therapy group 
had the highest microcrack volume at 7173 μ 
m3, which was significant compared to the non-fracture group 
(p = 0.001). The microcrack volume was also significantly lower in the non-fracture group than the fracture 
group (p = 0.004). (e) The fracture group had the greatest perforation volume fraction at 15.39 × 10−3%, which 
was significantly greater than both the bisphosphonate-treated group, which was 3.02 × 10−3% and non-
fracture group, which was 0.50 × 10−3% (bisphosphonate therapy p = 0.013, non-fracture p = 0.001). (f) The 
bisphosphonate therapy group had the highest microcrack volume fraction at 11.03 × 10−3 % (fracture p = 0.017, 
non-fracture p = 0.005). Statistically, microdamage data were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-
Whitney U test. Asterisks denote significant pairwise differences at *p < 0.050, **p < 0.010 and ***p < 0.001.

which may lead to artefacts in the scans. To account for this, the energy settings were calibrated to be lower 
than 30–35 kGy (safe level) and the exposure time of the scan was kept under 30 seconds per frame58. Another 
limitation of the study was that the bones cores in the bisphosphonate-treated and fracture-control groups were 
harvested from femoral heads following hip fracture, which should be kept in mind when generalising the results. 
To do so, further studies of bone from patients treated with bisphosphonates without fracturing should be per-
formed. Finally, the duration of bisphosphonate treatment was not controlled in this study. However, all samples 
were obtained from patients receiving treatment for a minimum of one year59.

In the present study, bone from the fracture control group exhibited the highest density and volume of per-
forations across all groups. Bone from healthy ageing individuals demonstrated a comparable density of microc-
racks with bone from fracture controls, although the volume of microcracks was significantly larger in the latter 
group. In healthy bone, sustained loading and fatigue caused by normal physical activity leads to microdamage 
formation, which results in a loss of mechanical integrity47. In order to maintain the mechanical integrity of 
bone, the remodelling process is targeted at sites of microdamage to initiate repair55,60. In osteoporosis, osteoclast 
activity is markedly elevated, which explains the high density and volume of perforations observed in this study61. 
Thus, the reduction in the normalised Young’s Modulus and ultimate tensile strength of untreated fracture bone 
compared to healthy bone can be attributed to a loss of structural integrity caused by perforations. Given that 
more than half of patients suffering from fragility fractures do not fit a DXA-based clinical diagnosis of osteopo-
rosis15,16, these findings suggest that osteoporosis may not solely be a disorder characterised by loss of bone mass, 
but also the disruption of bone microstructure17 due to perforations.
Bisphosphonate-treated bone from fracture patients had the highest density and volume of microcracks 
compared to bone from the untreated fracture patients and healthy ageing individuals. Correspondingly, 
bisphosphonate-treated samples also had reduced ultimate tensile strength and Young’s Modulus compared to 
the control groups. Our results, therefore, suggest that the reduced bone strength in the bisphosphonate group 
is due to the accumulation of microcracks. In this subgroup of bisphosphonate-treated patients that suffered a 
fracture, the accumulation of microcracks following treatment with bisphosphonates may have compromised the 
trabecular microstructure. As a result, there may have been weakening of the bone and consequently, an increased 
risk of fracture. Bisphosphonate-treated bone also demonstrated a lower density and volume of perforations com-
pared to osteoporotic bone, which may be reflective of the protective effects of bisphosphonates in limiting the 
development of perforations through osteoclastic inhibition27. However, it is the oversuppression of remodelling 
that has detrimental effects, as this predisposes to microcrack accumulation and propagation43.
Bone from healthy ageing individuals demonstrated a comparable density of microcracks with bone from frac-
ture patients although the volume was substantially lower. The accumulation of microcracks can potentially weaken 
bone and reduce tensile strength but microcracks are a part of normal physiological toughening mechanisms2,49,62. 
Bone is a hierarchical structure with energy-dissipating mechanisms at each level63. At the microstructural level, 
the formation of small microcracks can be an effective strategy for dissipating energy. Healthy bone has mech-
anisms to sustain microcrack accumulation, by limiting propagation and inducing an appropriate remodelling 
response to initiate repair. The toughness of bone is therefore maintained through the balance between the pro-
tective effects conferred by the fracture toughening mechanisms in bone and the formation of microcracks64. 
Disruption of this balance leads to a loss of heterogeneity of the trabecular composition, which is strongly corre-
lated with a reduction in fracture toughness35,65,66. Thus, the dysregulation of the remodelling process that occurs 
in osteoporosis and with bisphosphonate therapy predisposes to the formation and propagation of microcracks, 
which may occur through cracking of bone mineral crystallites, debonding at the mineral organic interface or 
shear between and within collagen fibrils67.
Consistent with the findings of the present study, Zimmermann et al. noted that cortical bone samples from 
osteoporotic and bisphosphonate-treated individuals displayed reduced bending modulus, yield stress and max-
imum bending stress compared to healthy adults6. Similarly, Lambers et al. reported an inverse relationship 
between bone microdamage volume fraction and Young’s Modulus caused by fatigue loading. Additionally, the 
authors observed that samples with microdamage were able to withstand 92% fewer cycles before failure com-
pared to the same tissue without microdamage in their study49. These findings suggest that even small quantities 
of microdamage can have a significant effect on the biomechanical performance of bone. Using nanoindentation 
techniques, Wang et al. noted a reduction in bone stiffness and elasticity following the formation of microdamage, 
which was maintained even after repair had occurred68. Our findings corroborate and build on previous analyses 
by establishing the differences in microdamage in healthy ageing, diseased and treated bone and correlating these 
with the mechanical properties.
In humans, there is limited evidence regarding the effects of long-term (> 
5 years) bisphosphonate therapy 
and microcrack accumulation. Clinical trials report a reduction in fracture risk but data available is limited to the 
duration of the trials, which typically last between 3–4 years29,30,69,70. This is very important clinically, as patients 
with osteoporosis are usually placed on treatment lasting more than five years. A recent nested case-control study 
by Erviti et al., who followed a cohort of 12054 individuals, reported patients on bisphosphonate therapy for 
longer than 3 years to be at significantly elevated risk of hip fracture compared to the control group. Furthermore, 
fracture risk was found to be independently associated with the duration of treatment71. Thus, the occurrence 
of hip fractures in bisphosphonate-treated patients may not be due to the inefficacy of the drug but rather a 
consequence of its effectiveness. Pooled analysis of three long-term extension trials on alendronate, risedronate 
and zoledronate revealed marginally lower hip fracture rates in patients switching to the placebo compared to 
those persisting with treatment72. The BMD in the femoral neck of patients who persisted with treatment was 
maintained but declined in those that had switched to the placebo. Given these findings, it is unlikely that these 
differences in risk can be reliably attributed to BMD. The increased incidence of fractures noted in these studies 
may be due to the accumulation of microcracks in the femoral neck, which can impair the mechanical proper-
ties of the bone, thereby predisposing to fracture. Moving forwards, our findings will form the groundwork for 
studies investigating the structure of bone at a micro- and nanostructural level, which will provide us with a more 
complete picture.
Conclusion
In this study, bone from bisphosphonate-treated fracture patients exhibited fewer perforated trabeculae com-
pared to bone from untreated fracture patients, which suggests successful suppression of the remodelling pro-
cess. However, more microcracks were present, which were larger in volume compared to untreated fracture and

healthy ageing non-fracture controls. Given the reduced mechanical strength noted in the bone samples from the 
bisphosphonate-treated group, these microstructural changes may explain the mechanism by which fractures 
occur in patients treated with bisphosphonates. Thus, it is plausible that there may be a population of patients 
in whom bisphosphonate therapy does not confer protective effects in resisting fractures, but is associated with 
microstructural damage and increased bone fragility instead. For patients on long-term therapy, if this microc-
rack accumulation critical time-point could be predicted, bisphosphonate treatment duration could be optimised. 
Bisphosphonates could be prescribed for long enough to increase bone volume and reduce perforations, whilst 
stopping the medication before a critical accumulation of microcracks. Whilst it may be premature to rethink 
current fracture prevention strategy, caution should be exercised when prescribing bisphosphonates to all patients 
deemed at risk of fracture and the duration of treatment should be carefully considered.
