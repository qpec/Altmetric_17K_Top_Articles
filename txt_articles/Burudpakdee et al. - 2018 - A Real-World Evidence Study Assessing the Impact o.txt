ABSTRACT
Introduction: The aim of this real-world study
was to measure the benefit of the Aerobika
oscillating positive expiratory pressure (OPEP)
device when added to standard of care (defined
as incentive spirometry [IS]) for post-operative
patients.
Methods: Adults
aged C 18 years
who
were
hospitalized
for
cardiac,
thoracic
or
upper
abdominal surgery between 1 September 2013
and 30 April 2017 were identified from IQVIA’s
Hospital Charge Detail Master (CDM) database;
the index date was the date of the first hospi-
talization for surgery. The control cohort (IS)
included patients who had C 1 CDM record
within 12 months prior to the index date and
C 1 record after discharge, evidence of IS use
during index hospitalization and no evidence of
use of a PEP or OPEP device at any time during
the study period. The Aerobika OPEP cohort was
selected
in
a
similar
manner,
except
that
patients were required to have evidence of
Aerobika OPEP use during the index hospital-
ization. Aerobika OPEP patients were 1:1 mat-
ched to IS patients using propensity score (PS)
matching. Hospital readmissions and costs were
measured at 30 days post-discharge from the
index hospitalization.
Results: After PS matching, 144 patients were
included in each cohort. At 30 days post-dis-
charge, compared to the control (IS) cohort
there were significantly fewer patients in the
Aerobika OPEP cohort with C 1 all-cause re-
hospitalizations (13.9 vs. 22.9%;
p = 0.042).
The patients in the Aerobika OPEP cohort also
had a shorter mean length of stay (± standard
deviation) (1.25 ± 4.04 vs. 2.60 ± 8.24 days;
p = 0.047) and lower total unadjusted mean all-
cause cost per patient ($3670 ± $13,894 vs.
$13,775 ± $84,238; p = 0.057). Adjusted analy-
ses suggested that hospitalization costs were
80% lower for the Aerobika OPEP cohort versus
the IS cohort (p = 0.001).
Conclusion: Our results suggest that the addi-
tion of the Aerobika OPEP device to standard of
care (IS) is beneficial in the post-operative
setting.

INTRODUCTION
Post-operative pulmonary complications (PPCs)
are a variety of conditions adversely affecting
the respiratory system of the patient after
anesthesia and surgery [1]. Examples of PPCs
include
atelectasis,
pneumonia,
pulmonary
infiltrate, aspiration pneumonitis, pulmonary
infection, exacerbation of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory
distress syndrome, acute respiratory failure and
prolonged mechanical ventilation (longer than
48 h) [1]. The estimated incidence of PPCs varies
greatly, ranging from as low as 5% to as high as
70%, depending on the type of surgery, which
PPCs are included in the estimate and the study
population [2]. PPCs are particularly common
among patients who have undergone cardiac
[3], thoracic [4] or upper abdominal surgery [5],
and the patient’s underlying pulmonary status
and comorbidities are just a few of the many
factors which contribute to the individual’s risk
of PPC after surgery [2].
PPCs are associated with a substantial clini-
cal and economic burden to post-operative
patients. They are associated with increased
mortality in both the short and long term, with
mortality in 30 and 90 days estimated to be 7- to
10-fold and 20-fold higher, respectively, among
patients with a PPC compared to those without
[1]. Similarly, PPCs are associated with increased
healthcare resource use and costs. In particular,
length of hospital stay has been shown to be
prolonged by 13–17 days with the occurrence of
a PPC [6]. This observed longer length of stay
appears to be the largest driver of higher
healthcare costs [7]. One retrospective study
reported that the attributable cost of a PPC was
over $52,000 per patient [8], and another study
reported that PPCs were projected to add $3.43
billion in cost to the U.S. healthcare system [9].
These data highlight the economic burden of
avoidable PPCs.
Strategies to prevent and treat PPCs include
techniques of lung re-expansion using incentive
spirometry (IS), which is the current standard of
care [10]. Early research demonstrated that the
use of IS decreases respiratory complications
following major abdominal surgery [11]. How-
ever, the conclusions drawn by authors of
recent systematic reviews are that there is a lack
of evidence regarding the effectiveness of IS for
the prevention of PPCs in patients who have
undergone cardiac, thoracic or upper abdomi-
nal surgery [2, 12]. Specifically, one of the sys-
tematic reviews found that most studies showed
no difference in patient outcomes (e.g. PPC,
lung function) for patients using IS compared to
controls [2].
Another commonly used intervention to
prevent and treat PPCs is positive expiratory
pressure (PEP) therapy, which involves breath-
ing against expiratory resistance; PEP therapy
can increase lung volume, reduce hyperinfla-
tion and improve airway clearance [13]. Oscil-
lating
positive
expiratory
pressure
(OPEP)
therapy is a variation of PEP that combines PEP
with high-frequency vibrations or oscillations.
It can thin and dislodge mucous by vibrating
the airways during breathing, which assists in
moving mucous up the airways [14]. In one
clinical trial, the use of an OPEP device resulted
in fewer cases of fever and shorter hospital stays
among adults undergoing thoracic and upper
abdominal surgery [15].
A variety of OPEP devices are currently
available, including Aerobika (TMI, London,
ON, Canada), which entered the U.S. market in
September
2013.
Clinical
trial
results
have
demonstrated that use of the Aerobika OPEP
device significantly improves dyspnea, quality
of life, exercise capacity and ease in bringing up
sputum in patients with COPD and bronchiec-
tasis [16]. In another clinical trial, the Aerobika
OPEP device was further shown to significantly
improve ventilation in patients with COPD
[17]. In addition, real-world evidence suggests
that the use of the Aerobika OPEP device among
COPD patients significantly reduces exacerba-
tions by nearly 30% [18]. These data suggest
that the use of the Aerobika OPEP device in the
post-operative setting may help lower the inci-
dence of PPCs, thereby reducing the risk of re-
hospitalization
and
lowering
the
economic
burden
of
PPCs
in
the
post-operative
population.

 The aim of this retrospective real-world
study was to measure the benefit of the Aero-
bika OPEP device when added to standard of
care
(IS)
for
cardiac,
thoracic
and
upper
abdominal surgery patients.
METHODS
This
retrospective
database
study
utilized
patient
data
stored
in
IQVIA’s
proprietary
Hospital Charge Detail Master (CDM) database
pertaining to the period between 1 September
2012 and 31 May 2017. The CDM database
manages daily transactional patient charges
from over 650 hospitals from 46 states in the
USA, covering 7 million annual inpatient stays
and 60 million annual outpatient visits. Patient-
level data include healthcare services from
hospital
departments
(inpatient,
outpatient
clinic, emergency department, pharmacy) and
encounters associated with ICD-9-CM/ICD-10
diagnosis codes and Current Procedural Termi-
nology codes. Information on drugs and devices
dispensed are available and reported in text
fields in the database. Detailed charges associ-
ated with each visit are also available, as well as
patient demographics and admission/discharge
characteristics.
In
this
database
study,
all
patient-level data were anonymized and de-
identified
in
compliance
with
the
Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA). As a retrospective cohort analysis of
HIPAA-compliant de-identified patient data, no
Institutional Review Board (IRB) review or clin-
ical trial registration was required for this study.
Patients with a hospitalization related to a
cardiac, thoracic or upper abdominal surgical
procedure between 1 September 2013 and 30
April 2017 (i.e. the selection window) were
selected into the study; the index date was
defined as the first date of hospitalization with
surgery. Patients were required to be at least
18 years of age and to have at least one record in
the CDM database within 12 months prior to
the index date (i.e. the baseline) and at least one
record after the discharge date of the index
hospitalization. All patients were required to
have evidence of IS use during the index hos-
pitalization. Patients were excluded if they had
a prior cardiac, thoracic or upper abdominal
surgery within 30 days of the index date, had
more than one type of surgery during the index
hospitalization or had incomplete demographic
data (i.e. missing age, gender, payer type or
geographic region).
Two patient cohorts were then developed.
The first included patients for whom there was
evidence of the use of the Aerobika OPEP device
during the index hospitalization. These patients
were also required to have no evidence of use of
the Aerobika OPEP device at any time before the
index date and no evidence of use of any other
PEP or OPEP device at any time during the study
period. An IS (control) group was also selected
that consisted of patients for whom there was
no evidence of the use of any PEP or OPEP
device at any time during the study period.
Once the selection of the Aerobika OPEP
cohort
was
complete,
these
patients
were
propensity score (PS) matched at a 1:1 ratio to IS
patients, using the greedy nearest neighbor
matching technique. PS matching used a logit
regression constructed from patient character-
istics measured during the 12-month period
before the index date and during the index
hospitalization.
This
methodology
is
com-
monly used in observational studies since it
mimics the selection process of randomized
clinical trials and decreases bias in the estima-
tion of treatment effects between comparison
groups. The following variables were included
in the PS model: age category, gender, region,
payer type, positive airway pressure device use
during index hospitalization, surgical proce-
dure, index year, Charlson Comorbidity Index
(CCI) category, comorbid conditions (acute
respiratory tract infections, asthma, atrial fib-
rillation, bronchiectasis, cardiovascular disease,
COPD, congestive heart failure, malignancy,
obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, pulmonary
hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, peripheral
artery disease), medication history and medi-
cation use during index hospitalization (an-
tibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, long-acting
b2-agonist
[LABA],
long-acting
muscarinic
antagonist
[LAMA],
short-acting
b2-agonist
[SABA],

[SAMA], inhaled corticosteroids [ICS], oral cor-
ticosteroids,
ICS/LABA
combination,

 SAMA combination). In addition, preliminary
analyses
suggested
significant
heterogeneity
between the Aerobika OPEP group and the IS
group in terms of frequency of PPCs during the
index hospitalization and the cost and length of
stay of the index hospitalization. This is reflec-
tive of how the Aerobika OPEP device is cur-
rently used in clinical practice as a reactive
intervention when a complication develops
after surgery. Therefore, as well as the length of
stay and cost of index hospitalization, the
presence of each of the following PPCs during
the index hospitalization (yes/no) was included
in the PS model: respiratory failure, atelectasis,
hypoxemia,
pulmonary
edema,
pulmonary
embolism,
pleural
effusion,
pneumothorax,
pulmonary
eosinophilia,
pneumonia,
other
pulmonary infection and tracheobronchitis.
Outcomes occurring within 30 days post-
discharge of the index hospitalization were
evaluated. These outcomes included the num-
ber and proportion of patients with at least one
all-cause hospital readmission, total length of
stay (days) of the rehospitalization, time to first
hospital readmission (days) among patients
who had at least one hospital readmission
(conditional mean), number and proportion of
patients with at least one hospital readmission
with the procedure code indicating chest X-ray
(proxy for respiratory complication) and total
all-cause costs of hospital-related events. CDM
data consists of charges for healthcare services;
therefore, a cost-to-charge ratio of 0.4770 was
used to convert charges reported in the CDM
database to estimated costs. The ratio was cal-
culated based on the average cost-to-charge
ratios published by the Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project for the 2014 National Inpa-
tient Sample. Costs were inflation-adjusted to
2017 U.S. dollars using the Medical Care com-
ponent of the U.S. Consumer Price Index for All
Urban Consumers [19].
Baseline patient characteristics were reported
using descriptive statistics. The p value was
assessed
to
evaluate
balance
of
variables
between Aerobika OPEP patients and matched
IS patients after PS matching. For study out-
comes,
pair-wise
comparisons
were
made
between the Aerobika OPEP group and the IS
group
for
each
study
measure.
The
nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test was
used to compare continuous variables, and the
nonparametric McNemar/Bowker test was used
to compare categorical variables. A p value
of \ 0.05 was considered to be statistically sig-
nificant for all study measures.
The additional effect of Aerobika OPEP (vs. IS
alone) on total all-cause hospital costs post-
discharge was evaluated using a multivariate
generalized linear model (GLM) with a gamma
distribution and a log link in the matched
population.
The
following
covariates
were
adjusted to control for remaining imbalance
after PS matching: comorbid conditions (atrial
fibrillation, diabetes, hypothyroidism, obesity,
stroke or transient ischemic attack) and the log
of total healthcare costs during index hospital-
ization. If two variables were highly correlated,
the most clinically relevant variable was inclu-
ded in the model (e.g. oxygen use was excluded
since CCI and PPC during the index hospital-
ization were included). All analyses were con-
ducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC, USA).
RESULTS
A
total
of
887
cardiac,
thoracic
or
upper
abdominal
surgery
patients
hospitalized
between 1 September 2013 and 30 April 2017
were identified to have used the Aerobika OPEP
device. After the selection criteria were applied,
the study sample comprised 152 Aerobika OPEP
patients and 3922 IS patients (Fig. 1). After PS
matching, a total of 144 Aerobika OPEP users
and 144 matched controls were identified; the
matched cohorts were well balanced on all
baseline characteristics (all p values [ 0.05),
except for evidence of chest X-ray during the
12-month pre-index period (p = 0.039; 59.0%
Aerobika OPEP vs. 45.8% IS). The mean age of
matched cohorts was around 65 years, with
more than one-third of the patients in both
cohorts aged 65–74 years (Table 1). A higher
proportion of males (
[ 60%) was observed in
both cohorts, and more than one-half of the
patients were insured by Medicare Risk. The
mean CCI score was 3.13–3.60, with more than
one-third of the patients in both cohorts having
90

 a CCI score of C 4. The most prevalent comor-
bid
conditions
were
cardiovascular
diseases
(C 49.3%), COPD (C 40.3%), obesity (C 34.0%),
anxiety/depression
(C 33.3%),
diabetes
(C 33.3%) and malignancy (C 30.6%).
The most common type of surgery during
the index hospitalization was thoracic surgery
(C 43.8%),
followed
by
cardiac
surgery
(C 41.7%)
and
upper
abdominal
surgery
(C 14.6%). More than one-half of the patient

 population had index hospitalizations in 2014
and over 30% in 2015, with a few patients
selected
from
later
years.
Aerobika
OPEP
patients and matched controls were balanced in
terms of medication history and use during the
index hospitalization for antibiotics, anticoag-
ulants other than warfarin (warfarin use was
low), proton pump inhibitors and respiratory
medications (Table 2). There was no evidence of
the use of medications for either pulmonary
hypertension or pulmonary fibrosis in this
study population. The most commonly used
medications in both groups appeared to be
antibiotics
(C 94.4%)
and
anticoagulants
(C 83.3%). The most commonly used medica-
tion for respiratory disease was SABA (C 45.1%)
followed
by
a
SABA/SAMA
combination
(C 40.3%).
Aerobika OPEP patients and matched controls
were balanced in terms of presence of PPCs dur-
ing the index hospitalization (all p values [0.05)
(Table 3). Respiratory failure was the most com-
mon PPC (C 31.3%), followed by pneumonia
(C 25.0%),
pleural
effusion
(C 17.4%)
and
atelectasis (C 14.6%). The majority of patients
had evidence of a chest X-ray (proxy for respira-
tory complication) during the index hospitaliza-
tion (95.5%), and approximately one-half of these
patients
received
mechanical
ventilation
(C 47.2%). Use of oxygen therapy during the
index hospitalization remained imbalanced after
matching (81.9% for Aerobika OPEP cohort vs.
39.6% for IS cohort; p\0.001). Length of stay
and cost of the index hospitalization were bal-
anced between Aerobika OPEP device users and
matched controls (p C 0.109).
At 30 days post-discharge, there were signif-
icantly fewer patients in the Aerobika OPEP
cohort with at least one all-cause hospital
readmission than in the IS cohort (13.9 vs.
22.9%; p = 0.042). Similarly, comparison of the
distribution of the number of all-cause read-
missions suggested more IS patients than Aero-
bika OPEP patients had one (17.4 vs. 11.1%) or
two
(5.6
vs.
2.8%)
hospitalizations
(both
p = 0.061) (Table 4). Approximately 20% of IS
patients had a readmission during which time
at least one chest X-ray was performed (sug-
gesting respiratory complication) compared to
11.1% of Aerobika OPEP patients (p = 0.037).
On average, the mean length of stay (± standard
deviation) during the post-discharge period was
shorter for Aerobika OPEP device users than for
IS
users
(1.25 ± 4.04
vs.
2.60 ± 8.24 days;
p = 0.047). Time to first all-cause readmission
was similar between the two cohorts.

 The total unadjusted mean all-cause cost per
patient within 30 days post-discharge was lower
for the Aerobika OPEP cohort than for the IS

After
controlling
for
comorbidities and cost of the index hospital-

tion), hospitalization costs within 30 days post-
discharge were shown to be 80% lower for the

hospital readmissions, had a shorter length of stay
during readmissions and, overall, had signifi-
cantly lower, adjusted all-cause inpatient costs
during the 30 days post-discharge. The mean
length of stay for readmissions within the post-
discharge window was 1.35 days shorter for the
Aerobika OPEP group compared to the IS group,
which is consistent with earlier clinical trial
findings that post-operative use of an OPEP device
resulted in significantly shorter hospital stays
among patients undergoing thoracic and upper
abdominal surgery [15]. Total unadjusted mean
all-cause inpatient costs over the 30-day post-
discharge period per patient was about $10,000
lower for the Aerobika OPEP group than for the IS
group, although this result did not reach statisti-
cal significance. After adjusting for additional
cofounders, our regression model further con-
firmed this observed trend towards lower costs
and
reached statistical significance. Costs

 30 days are particularly relevant as providers and
insurers continue to seek ways to reduce early re-
hospitalizations in their patient population, and
the Aerobika OPEP device is an inexpensive drug-
free intervention that can prevent PPCs and
reduce associated hospital costs.
Although not in the post-operative care set-
ting, other real-world studies on the use of the
Aerobika OPEP device in COPD patients suggest
that the device improves outcomes by helping
to open airways, mobilize and clear mucus and
enhance drug deposition. One study by Burud-
pakdee et al. on patients with COPD found that
the Aerobika OPEP device was associated with
reduced visits to the emergency department,
reduced number of hospital readmissions and
reduced costs [18]. Another study found that
the Aerobika OPEP device resulted in a direct
medical cost savings of $553 per patient [20].
These
data
suggest
that
the
reductions
in
healthcare resource use and costs associated
with the Aerobika OPEP device among post-
operative patients in our study may result from
the beneficial effects of this device on improv-
ing airway structure and function [16, 17], thus
reducing the risk of developing a PPC that
warrants rehospitalization.
The results of this study suggest that the
Aerobika OPEP device can improve patient
outcomes, reduce early rehospitalizations and
lower inpatient costs when used reactively in a
post-operative population after the develop-
ment of a complication. Based on our findings
and taking into consideration both the low
acquisition cost and clean safety profile of the
Aerobika OPEP device, we suggest that the Aer-
obika OPEP device may be beneficial when used
as standard of care in all post-operative patients.
However, future studies are warranted to mea-
sure the benefits of Aerobika OPEP device use in
all patients who undergo a surgical procedure to
prevent PPCs.
This study has several limitations inherent to
retrospective studies. First, our results can only
establish
associations
and
cannot
identify
cause-and-effect
relationships.
Second,
the
CDM data are primarily used for billing pur-
poses and therefore are subject to potential
coding errors. Moreover, they cannot provide as
much clinical detail and accuracy as medical
records. Relevant laboratory values and patient
vitals are not available in the database; there-
fore, the severity of the condition was inferred
using diagnosis codes as markers of disease
severity, such as medication history, comor-
bidities and CCI score. Furthermore, these data
comprise hospital records and study measures
only reflective of care received in the hospital
setting. Medications dispensed in community
and retail pharmacies are underreported in this
study. Office visits and care provided by primary
care physicians and other physicians outside of
the hospital setting are not captured in CDM
and, therefore, our findings reflect the hospital
setting only. Additionally, because CDM is an
open database covering hospitals from 46 states

 in the USA, it is possible that not all inpatient
events are captured in cases where a patient
visits a hospital that does not contribute to the
CDM
database.
However,
the
potential
for
underreporting inpatient events was minimized
by requiring at least one CDM record both
before and after the index date to ensure that
patients were seeking care within the healthcare
network captured in the CDM. Lastly, in this
study, it is the addition of the Aerobika OPEP
device to standard treatment (IS) that may be
responsible for the improvements observed.
These results may not be generalizable to a
hospital where the treatment protocol does not
require the use of IS as the standard of care, as
clinical guidelines suggest IS is only recom-
mended in certain cases [21].
Despite these limitations, the CDM hospital
database is well-suited for this analysis of the
use of the Aerobika OPEP device in the post-
operative care setting. Treatment of severe
post-surgery complications requires a visit to
the emergency department or hospitalization,
and the CDM database captures these types of
events well since data are derived from the
hospital setting. More importantly, a database
study of Aerobika OPEP patients is only possi-
ble in the CDM dataset (as opposed to standard
adjudicated claims) due to the lack of specific
code for the Aerobika OPEP device and the
need to identify patients using the device
named in the billing description. Additionally,
our study utilized a PS-matched cohort study
design to minimize bias and regression analy-
ses to control for potential confounders. The
trend in lower all-cause inpatient costs was
confirmed in our regression analysis, further
strengthening
the
internal
validity
of
our
findings.
CONCLUSIONS
This is the first real-world study to measure the
benefit of the Aerobika OPEP device when
added to the standard of care (IS) in the post-
operative care setting. These findings suggest
that the Aerobika OPEP device is associated with
significantly fewer re-hospitalizations within
30 days post-discharge, shorter length of stay
and lower costs associated with inpatient events
compared to the standard of care (IS alone).
Patients who utilized the Aerobika OPEP device
incurred lower healthcare costs as a result of
fewer complications warranting returns to the
hospital and, therefore, it can be concluded that
the Aerobika OPEP device may be an effective
treatment for the management of post-surgery
patients.
