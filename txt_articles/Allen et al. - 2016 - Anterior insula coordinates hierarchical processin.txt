The body underlies our sense of self, emotion, and agency. Signals arising from the skin convey warmth, social
touch, and the physical characteristics of external stimuli. Surprising or unexpected tactile sensations can herald
events of motivational salience, including imminent threats (e.g., an insect bite) and hedonic rewards (e.g.,
a caressing touch). Awareness of such events is thought to depend upon the hierarchical integration of body-
related mismatch responses by the anterior insula. To investigate this possibility, we measured brain activity
using functional magnetic resonance imaging, while healthy participants performed a roving tactile oddball
task. Mass-univariate analysis demonstrated robust activations in limbic, somatosensory, and prefrontal cortical
areas previously implicated in tactile deviancy, body awareness, and cognitive control. Dynamic Causal Modelling
revealed that unexpected stimuli increased the strength of forward connections along a caudal to rostral
hierarchy—projecting from thalamic and somatosensory regions towards insula, cingulate and prefrontal corti-
ces. Within this ascending flow of sensory information, the AIC was the only region to show increased backwards
connectivity to the somatosensory cortex, augmenting a reciprocal exchange of neuronal signals. Further, partic-
ipants who rated stimulus changes as easier to detect showed stronger modulation of descending PFC to AIC
connections by deviance. These results suggest that the AIC coordinates hierarchical processing of tactile predic-
tion error. They are interpreted in support of an embodied predictive coding model where AIC mediated body
awareness is involved in anchoring a global neuronal workspace.

Introduction
The body is our first point of contact with the world, forming the
backdrop of all perceptual and emotional experiences. As the body's larg-
est organ, the skin delineates an agent's boundaries, controls thermoreg-
ulation, and encodes information about the shape, intensity, and texture
of bodily impressions. In general surprising tactile changes herald events
of high motivational importance, including imminent threats (e.g., an in-
sect bite) and pleasing social rewards (e.g., a caressing touch). Likewise,
expectations and prior experiences colour our subjective perception, en-
hancing task-relevant features and suppressing others (Clark, 2013).
Here we used Dynamic Causal Modelling of fMRI signals associated
with unpredictable changes in the intensity of tactile stimuli. The ensu-
ing changes in effective connectivity show how feed-forward and feed-
back processes are integrated by the insula to support body awareness.
One framework for understanding how prior beliefs and tactile
changes are integrated in the brain is found in recent theoretical pro-
posals describing a union of embodied perception and predictive coding
(Seth, 2013). Here a general theoretical consensus suggests that the
integration of bodily changes with prior beliefs underlies the generation
of affective awareness (Apps and Tsakiris, 2014; Barrett and Simmons,
2015; Seth et al., 2012). In particular, the anterior insula is thought to
be crucial for the hierarchical processing of bodily information, integrat-
ing afferent thalamic and sensory inputs with top-down control signals
arising in the prefrontal and cingulate cortex (Seth, 2013; Seth et al.,
2012). This theory is supported by the unique structural and functional
characteristics of the insular cortex as a core neuronal hub that causally
regulates the interaction of sensory, attentional, and default mode
networks (van den Heuvel et al., 2012; Menon and Uddin, 2010;
Sridharan et al., 2008). This high centrality equips the region with the

 unique ability to integrate diverse cortical and subcortical inputs, as sup-
ported by both a variety of multi-sensory and thalamic posterior inputs
and anterior projections to cingulate, prefrontal, and brain-stem nuclei
(Craig, 2003, 2005; Ullsperger et al., 2010). The right AIC in particular
is richly interconnected with primary visceral and somatosensory
areas such as posterior insula and somatosensory cortex (Cerliani
et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2013), anticipates the sensory and affective
consequences of touch (Lovero et al., 2009), and has been described as
a central node in a right-lateralized body-related network (Craig, 2005).
This unique anatomical and functional profile suggests that the right
anterior insula supports bodily and affective awareness by integrating as-
cending information from thalamic and sensory sources with descending
predictions from the prefrontal and cingulate cortex (Seth, 2013; Seth
et al., 2012). Neurobiological theories inspired by predictive coding gen-
erally ascribe functional asymmetry to ascending and descending con-
nections (Bastos et al., 2012). Evidence for this distinction is found for
example in a recent study demonstrating that whereas ascending predic-
tion errors are communicated by increases in fast gamma oscillations, de-
scending predictions are instead carried by slower theta and alpha
oscillations (Bastos et al., 2015). In general under active inference, per-
ceptual awareness is argued to depend upon the inversion of a generative
model that encodes error-minimizing expectations, which then constrain
activity in lower-order regions via top-down cortical feedback (Friston,
2010; Friston et al., 2012; Rao and Ballard, 1999).
With respect to oddball tasks, mismatch responses elicited by the
comparison of standard stimuli to unexpected deviants are computa-
tionally well fit by prediction error minimization schemes (Garrido
et al., 2007, 2008; Lieder et al., 2013a,b), and are mediated by asymmet-
rical changes in intrinsic and extrinsic effective connectivity within a
hierarchical network (Dietz et al., 2014; Garrido et al., 2008, 2009).
Recently, tactile awareness been shown to rely on the existence of recip-
rocal effective connectivity within the somatosensory hierarchy
(Auksztulewicz et al., 2012). Tactile mismatch specifically depends on
hierarchical Bayesian inference in somatosensory and limbic areas
(Ostwald et al., 2012): EEG responses elicited in a roving tactile oddball
paradigm were modelled to demonstrate that somatosensory and
cingulate mismatch responses encode Bayesian Surprise, a measure of
the amount of prediction error (Baldi and Itti, 2010; Ostwald et al.,
2012). It is currently unknown how tactile deviants regulate effective
connectivity within the right-lateralized body awareness network
(Craig, 2005). This study therefore aimed to investigate how attending
to bodily changes modulates anterior insula effective connectivity with-
in the tactile hierarchy.
To do so, we modelled BOLD mismatch responses in a roving oddball
paradigm using Dynamic Casual Modelling for fMRI. In particular, we de-
rived three connectivity hypotheses from the above. First, if tactile
information is processed hierarchically, one should expect a general pat-
tern of increased forward connections in response to unpredicted tactile
stimuli, reflecting their role in conveying prediction error. Second, and
most crucially for the present experiment, we expected increases in
both forwards and backwards insular connections; such a result would
demonstrate that the AIC regulates the activity of both cingulo-
prefrontal and somatosensory responses (Seth, 2013; Seth et al., 2012).
Finally, if top-down modulation of anterior insula responses underlies
our ability to attend to and perceive bodily changes, we expected subjec-
tive ratings about stimulus changes to correlate with modulation of de-
scending connections to the anterior insula during oddball responses.
Here, we provide evidence for each of these hypotheses using the roving
tactile oddball paradigm and Dynamic Causal Modelling for fMRI.
Methods
Participants
Thirty-eight healthy participants (16 males) were recruited from
Aarhus University and the surrounding community. Inclusion criteria
required that all participants were between the ages of 21 and 45
years, right handed, free from medications that could affect the BOLD
signal (psychiatric, blood pressure or heart medication, etc.), physically
and mentally healthy, and meeting standard MRI safety inclusion
criteria (lack of claustrophobia, metallic implants, etc.). All participants
gave verbal consent and visited the MRI laboratory at Aarhus University
Hospital for approximately 2 h in total, and received a 300 DKK (approx.
€40) reimbursement for their participation. All experimental proce-
dures were conducted with approval from the local ethics committee
(De Videnskabsetiske Komitéer for Region Midtjylland) in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. 8 participants in total were excluded
from preliminary data analysis—one for excessive motion during
scanning, 6 for poorer than chance behavioural performance (see
Roving Somatosensory Oddball Task for further details), and one for
failure to acquire pulse regressors. The final sample for the fMRI analysis
included 30 participants (14 males) with a mean age of 24.5 years
(SD = 3.2).
Roving Somatosensory Oddball Task
To manipulate tactile probability while controlling for stimulus
intensity and attention, we utilized a Roving Somatosensory Oddball
Task (RSOT) in which trains of stimuli randomly switch between high
and low intensity after a variable number of repetitions (Garrido et al.,
2008; Ostwald et al., 2012). In the present study, stimuli were delivered
in trains of varying from 3 to 7 repetitions. Stimuli consisted of single
electrical pulses of 50 μs duration and 2000 ms interstimulus interval.
Following each repetitive train, the stimuli switched between low or
high intensity, where low intensity trials corresponded to a single
pulse at twice the perceptual threshold, and high intensity trials
consisted of two pulses identical to the single delivered in rapid succes-
sion (100 ms inter-stimulus interval).
This stimulation protocol resulted in a sensation of a mild tickle or
vibration that was not reported as painful by any participant. The first
stimulus of each new train was modelled as the “Deviant” (D), and the
third repetition in a train as the “standard” (S). Standards were repeated
between 3 and 7 times by sampling at random from a uniform multino-
mial distribution with outcomes {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, generating an unpredict-
able stimulus sequence. Participants received a total of 158 deviant and
640 repeated stimuli (of which 158 stimuli were selected as standards).
All stimuli were delivered to the median nerve of the left forearm using
two MR-safe ECG electrodes placed approximately 2.5 cm apart and a
constant current stimulator (DeMeTec, Langgoens, Germany). See
Fig. 1 for an overview of the experimental set-up and sample stimulus
train.
After placement in the scanner, participants' individual perceptual
thresholds were determined using an adaptive staircase procedure
prior to scanning. The staircase consisted of a one-up/three-down
procedure, where step size was reduced every two reversals until
reaching a total of 8 reversals. The sensory threshold was thus calculat-
ed by averaging the stimulus intensities at the 8 reversals. Stimuli for
the subsequent oddball task were then delivered at twice this sensory
threshold, eliciting a mild tactile sensation. After thresholding, partici-
pants completed a short practice version of the oddball task, and contin-
ued to the main experiment after indicating that the task instructions
were fully understood. All participants completed approximately
28 min of the RSOT during fMRI acquisition.
Pilot studies with this stimulation protocol revealed that – as
intended – the double stimulation was perceived as slightly more
intense than single trials. To control attention, participants were
instructed to silently count all stimuli switches throughout the entire
task duration, in a standard ‘active’ counting task (Garrido et al.,
2009). This manipulation encourages participants to exert equivalent
attentional effort to both deviant and standard trials (as the occurrence
of deviants is unpredictable). Participant switch counts were then
recorded at the end of the imaging session to ensure compliance. Six
35

 participants reporting switch counts 60% above or below the true total
(i.e., poorer than chance performance) were excluded from further
analysis. Overall switch count accuracy of the remaining participants
was extremely high (mean accuracy 99%), suggesting successful
attentional control and task participation.
Following the scan, participants completed a debriefing inquiring
about the nature of the perceived stimuli (e.g., painful or non-painful).
Participants also rated “the felt intensity” of each stimulus type
(i.e., low and high), and “the difficulty detecting stimulus changes
from low to high” or “from high to low”, on visual analogue scales
with 0 marked as ‘not at all intense/difficult’ and 100 labelled as ‘very
difficult/intense’. The adaptive staircase procedure, the RSOT and the
post-scan ratings were implemented in Psychopy (v1.76.00) (Peirce,
2007).
Data acquisition and pre-processing
fMRI data were collected in a single continuous session of approxi-
mately 28 min, totalling 1109 volumes. All brain measurements were
acquired on a Siemens Trio 3 T scanner, using a 32-channel head coil.
For fMRI, 31 slices were acquired in ascending order using a gradient
echo planar sequence with echo time 30 ms, voxel size 3 × 3 × 3 mm
in a 64 × 64 mm field of view, repetition time = 1.54 s. Slices were
manually positioned to ensure full coverage of somatosensory cortex,
anterior insula, prefrontal cortex, and thalamus, flip angle = 90°. A
T1-weighted MPRAGE structural image (0.98 × 0.98 × 1.00 mm resolu-
tion, FoV = 256 × 256 × 176, TR = 1.9 s) was collected after the EPI se-
quence. B0 field maps (2.19 × 2.19 × 2.50 mm resolution, 96 × 96 × 60
FoV, TR = 1.43 s) were collected using a gradient echo sequence. To
control for physiological BOLD-signal confounds, cardiac cycles were
recorded in synchrony with EPI acquisition using an infrared pulse
oximeter on the participant's right index finger.
fMRI analysis
MRI data were analysed using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8
for GLM analysis and SPM12b for DCM, http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/
spm). Each participant's 1109 EPI images were corrected for geometric
distortions caused by susceptibility-induced field inhomogeneity. This
was done using a combined correction for both static distortions and
changes in those distortions caused by head motion (Andersson et al.,
2001; Hutton et al., 2002). Static distortions were calculated using
the FieldMap toolbox to process each participant's B0 field map
(Hutton et al., 2004). EPI images were then realigned, unwarped, and
co-registered to the participant's anatomical scan. The anatomical im-
ages were processed using the unified segmentation procedure
implementing tissue segmentation, bias correction, and spatial normal-
ization (Ashburner and Friston, 2005); derived normalization parame-
ters were then applied to the EPI images. Finally, the images were
smoothed using a 6 mm full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel,
and resampled to 3 × 3 × 3 mm voxels.
To control for head motion and physiological BOLD signal confounds,
serial correlations were modelled using a nuisance variable regression
instead of the AR(1) SPM default, which has been shown to outperform
the auto-regressive technique at faster TRs (Lund et al., 2006). In addi-
tion to the SPM8 standard discrete cosine set high pass filter (128 s
cut off), this approach included 10 RETROICOR-derived regressors
based on cardiac oscillations (Glover et al., 2000). We also included
the full 12 parameter Volterra expansion of motion and motion history
parameters to capture rigid body head movement related to subject
motion and respiration (Friston et al., 1996).
To identify BOLD responses to somatosensory deviance, we applied a
standard summary statistic approach (Worsley et al., 2002). This
involved first identifying subject-level responses in a fixed-effects gen-
eral linear model (GLM) for each participant's EPI time-series, and then
passing the resultant contrast images to one-sample t-tests at the group
(random-effects) level. To do so, at the first level we modelled Deviants
(the first trial of a new stimulus intensity) and Standards (the third
repetition following each Deviant) as separate event-related regressors
convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. The
remaining repetition trials (S2–S7) were not modelled, and thus served
as an implicit baseline. The resulting contrast images were then passed
to a random-effects one sample t-test over all participants, testing for a
positive mean response. The resulting SPM was peak-corrected for mul-
tiple comparisons at a family-wise error rate PFWE b 0.05 using Gaussian
random field theory (Worsley et al., 1996).
Dynamic causal modelling
To address our connectivity hypotheses, we investigated the overall
impact of surprising tactile changes on effective connectivity within the
right lateralized network identified by our mass-univariate analysis. To
do so, we used a Bayesian model reduction approach to model selection
that searches large model spaces in an unbiased way (Friston and
Penny, 2011; Rosa et al., 2012). This allowed us to search within a
“full” or “parent” model – which contained all free parameters – for
the best of all reduced models, with one or more parameters removed.
Using the parameter estimates from the best model, we applied classical
statistical tests to summarize changes in the strength of specific connec-
tions at the group level. We were thus able to make quantitative infer-
ences about the strength and directionality of connections within an
Fig. 1. Schematic depicting experimental setup and example stimulus train. Participants received mild somatosensory electrical stimulation (50 μs pulse) at twice sensory threshold on the
median nerve of the left forearm. Subjective intensity was manipulated by switching between single pulse (bottom-row) and double pulse (top-row) trials. Double pulses were identical to
single pulses, with a 100 ms interstimulus interval. Repetitions varied randomly from 3 to 7 standard stimuli before switching to the alternate stimulus type, with repetition counts
randomly sampled from uniform multinomial distribution. The first stimulus of each train corresponded to a deviant (D), whereas the following repetitions were defined as standards
(S1, S2, …, S6). For our fMRI analysis, we modelled the deviant trials and the third repetition as standard (see Methods for more details).

 inclusive model space, while circumventing limitations regarding the
combinatorial explosion of models (Lohmann et al., 2012).
In order to model the impact of oddball stimuli (D N S trials) on
connectivity, we remodelled our first level (within-subject) design ma-
trix into a single “all conditions” regressor encoding all trials (both devi-
ants and 3rd standards) as “1”s. This condition was then parametrically
modulated as a “1” for every deviant and a “−1” for every standard trial.
Note that this reformulation is simply a matter of convenience (i.e., to
allow a contrast rather than a particular trial type to act as an input to
DCM) and is statistically equivalent to our original within-subject
model.
We then extracted BOLD timeseries from volumes of interest (VOI),
based on the peak activations induced by oddballs (D N S at the group
level). To this end we defined VOIs in the dorsal–posterior thalamus
(TH) [MNIxyz = 12, −16, 10], somatosensory area 2 [MNIxyz = 48,
−34, 49] (S1), anterior insula cortex (AIC) [MNIxyz = 36, 20, 1], anterior
mid-cingulate cortex (MCC) [MNIxyz = 3, 23, 43], and middle frontal
gyrus (MFG) [MNIxyz = 36, 50, 22]. All anatomical labels at the extrac-
tion coordinates were confirmed using the SPM Probabilistic Anatomy
Toolbox (Eickhoff et al., 2005).
VOI timeseries were then summarized in terms of the principal
eigenvariate within a 6 mm spherical VOI centred on each participant's
local maxima within 12 mm of the group maximum. Peak coordinates
were plotted on a standard brain and inspected to ensure that all
extracted timeseries were from the appropriate anatomical region of
interest. For extraction, participant-level SPMs were thresholded at
p b 0.05 uncorrected, voxel extent threshold k N 5 contiguous voxels.
All timeseries were adjusted for confounding effects (i.e., nuisance
covariates in the GLM). Given our interest in the right-lateralized body
network and left-sided median nerve stimulation (Craig, 2005), all
VOIs were taken from the right hemisphere. In five participants, region-
al VOIs from one or more regions could not be obtained, leaving 25 total
participants for DCM analyses.
We chose a somewhat conservative approach to modelling the
oddball effect by using the difference between deviants and standards
as both a driving and modulatory input. This choice was based on the
observation that, from the point of view of fMRI, the repeated presenta-
tion of stimuli every 2 s is effectively a steady state stimulus; in which
haemodynamic responses are evoked by occasional deviants (relative
to an arbitrary standard). This approach is conservative because
condition-specific effects have two opportunities to express themselves
(either as driving effects or by changing connectivity). This means that
when we test for a modulatory effect (by removing it from the
model), the driving effect could compensate for its absence (and vice
versa). Heuristically, this is like including the driving effect as confound
when testing for modulatory effects in general linear models (and vice
versa), and ensures that any observed experimental modulations are
not explained solely by driving input. The full model thus included the
impact of deviants as a driving input to the thalamus, and additional
modulatory deviance effects on all extrinsic (between node) and intrin-
sic (self) connections. The full model with extrinsic (fixed) connections
between all nodes and deviant vs. standard modulations of all connec-
tions was then estimated in each participant using the variational
Bayesian scheme implemented in SPM12. The neuronal dynamics
were modelled with the following differential equation:
δx
δt ¼ Ax þ

x þ Cu:
The full model thus allowed changes in all A (condition in-
dependent) and B (modulatory or condition-dependent) parameters
(with C mediating subcortical input at the thalamus). Bayesian model
reduction (a.k.a. post hoc optimisation or network discovery) was
used to compare all combinations of average (A) and condition-
specific (B) connections (Friston and Penny, 2011; Rosa et al., 2012).
Effectively, this removes (combinations of) redundant parameters or
connections until model evidence stops increasing. Connections are
‘removed’ by setting their prior expectation to zero (with a prior uncer-
tainty or variance of zero). This creates reduced models from the full or
parent model. This furnishes posterior model probabilities (i.e., the
probability that a model is the best explanation for the data) for all re-
duced models (including a null-model with no connections). Bayesian
model reduction operates at the group level by pooling the evidence
for each model over subjects (under fixed effect model assumptions).
This simply entails summing the log evidence over subjects. The best
model is then whichever has the highest evidence as determined by
the Bayes factor; i.e., the ratio of evidence for the best vs. second best
model (Penny et al., 2004). The parameter estimates under the winning
model were then taken for each subject as summary statistics for classi-
cal random effect analysis at the group level. This involved performing
one sample t-tests (with FDR correction for multiple comparisons).
Here, we focused on two connectivity hypotheses. First, we ad-
dressed our principal question about the pattern of insula connectivity
by characterizing the deviant-dependent connectivity modulations.
This was accomplished using one-sample t-tests over the 25 modulato-
ry (B-matrix) parameters, PFDR b 0.05. Second, we separately assessed
the relationship between individual differences in participants'
perceived difficulty detecting sensory changes (i.e., the averaged post-
scan difficulty ratings) and deviant-dependent modulation of each
extrinsic connection (i.e., the 20 between-region B-matrix parameters).
To do so, we conducted robust regression analyses using Tukey's
Biweight with connectivity estimates predicting mean difficulty rating.
This method was chosen over a least squares approach to protect
against outlier values, which are a frequent issue in neuroimaging
individual differences analyses (Poldrack, 2012). Regression p-values
for each analysis were adjusted for multiple comparisons to a
PFDR b 0.05. All ANOVA and one-sample t-test analyses were conducted
in SPSS version 20 (IBM), and all FDR thresholds and robust regression
analysis were calculated using MATLAB R2012b (Mathworks, Inc) and
the FDR toolbox.
Results
Sample characteristics and nuisance regression
Excluding the 6 participants removed for poorer than chance perfor-
mance, the average number of counted deviants was 156 (SD = 17) out
of 158 total, corresponding to an average count accuracy of 99%. This
result indicates that the majority of participants were able to comply
with the task instructions, precluding major differences in attentional
effort between standard and deviant trials. In the post scan debriefing,
all participants reported that the stimuli were perceived as a non-
painful mild touch or ‘tickle’ sensation. The average sensory threshold
across participants was 12.22 mA (SD = 2.86). As a face-validation of
our stimuli, we compared participant's intensity and difficulty ratings
for low vs. high stimuli via paired-sample t-tests. Double stimuli
(mean intensity rating = 57, SD = 21) were rated as significantly
more intense than single stimuli (mean intensity rating = 46, SD =
16, mean difference = 11, SD = 19, t29 = 3.4, p = 0.002). As no signif-
icant difference was found for the self-rated difficulty of discriminating
single-to-double (mean difficulty rating = 34, SD = 26) or double-to-
single trials
(mean difficulty
rating = 36, SD
= 23, mean
difference = −1.5, SD = 17.5, t29 = −0.5, p = .64), we averaged the
two ratings from each participant to derive an index of the perceived
difficulty detecting sensory changes. This measure was then used as
an explanatory variable in our regression analyses with DCM modulato-
ry parameters.

 somatosensory and parietal cortex. Within the right hemisphere, so-
matosensory activations covered 27.8% of area 2 and extended into
areas of the intra-parietal cortex (IPC). The largest proportion of this ac-
tivation was within area 2 (7.8% of cluster) followed by the IPC (6.1%).
Consistent with previous oddball fMRI studies, we additionally ob-
served significant bilateral activations in the dorsal mid-cingulate, ante-
rior insula, and middle frontal gyrus extending into dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (BA 45). In the midbrain, we observed bilateral activa-
tions in dorsal-posterior somatosensory thalamus, and caudate nucleus.
All anatomical labels and percent activations were determined using the
SPM probabilistic anatomy toolbox. See Table 1 and Fig. 2 for a complete
overview of these results.
DCM results
Post-hoc model optimization found that the full model (M255,
shown in Fig. 4B), with all extrinsic connections and modulations, had
the highest posterior probability (pP = 0.79). The next most probable
model was M128 with a posterior probability of 0.06; the Bayes factor
discriminating these two models (pPM255/pPM128) was 13.17, corre-
sponding to strong evidence for model 255 being the best explanation
for the data (Penny et al., 2004). See Fig. 3 for an overview of the
model selection results and plots illustrating connectivity strengths
and their condition specific changes under the winning model.
One sample t-tests over all 25 modulatory parameters (at the
between-subject level) revealed a general pattern of deviant-
dependent increases in a forward (caudal to rostral) hierarchy, with
significant increases in connectivity from TH to AIC and S1, from S1 to
AIC, MCC, and MFG, from AIC to MCC and MFG, and from MCC to MFG
(Fig. 4). In line with the hypothesis that AIC acts as a body-state compar-
ator, the AIC exhibited both increased backward connectivity towards
S1 and forward connectivity to the MCC and MFG. The AIC and S1
were the only regions to show reciprocal increases in connectivity. Ad-
ditionally, significant modulations of the TH, AIC, and S1 self-
connections were found, suggesting that somatosensory oddballs
induce strong dis-inhibition of these regions.
Our robust regression analyses found three condition-specific effects
significantly predicted deviance-detection ratings (Fig. 5B); interesting-
ly, all involved backwards connections (MFG to TH, MFG to MCC, and
MFG to AIC). Only the MFG to AIC correlation survived FDR correction,
with the Deviant N Standard modulation predicting 38% of the variance
in subjective difficulty; t(1, 25) = −3.47, pFDR = 0.002, R2 = 38.04
(Fig. 5A). Finally, in a control analysis, we calculated the average differ-
ence of self-reported intensity for high intensity–low intensity trials and
repeated the above analysis using this measure of average stimulus
differentiation. Only the MCC to AIC connection was significant at an
uncorrected level (p = 0.0379), and did not survive multiple compari-
sons correction.
Discussion
This study demonstrates that BOLD responses to surprising tactile
stimuli are produced by increases in effective connectivity within a
caudal-to-rostral ascending hierarchy of somatosensory, limbic, and
prefrontal areas. In accordance with our hypothesis, anterior insula
BOLD responses to deviants were explained by increases in the strength
of both ascending influences on prefrontal and cingulate cortex and
descending connectivity to the primary somatosensory area. Interest-
ingly, individual differences in the modulation of descending connectiv-
ity predicted participant's subjective ratings of how easy it was to detect
stimulus changes. Collectively these findings are consistent with the
proposal that the anterior insula compares ascending body related
sensations with top-down predictions to support tactile awareness.
Here we consider the implications of these findings from the perspec-
tive of predictive coding and embodied active inference.
Previous fMRI studies of oddball responses in the visual, auditory,
and tactile modalities report bilateral increases in BOLD activity in the
thalamus (TH), primary sensory areas (e.g., S1/V1/A1), anterior insula
(AIC), dorso-medial cingulate (MCC), and inferior and middle frontal
gyrus (IFG, MFG), all of which are implicated in the present study
(Downar et al., 2002; Garrido et al., 2009). Our mass-univariate results
are thus highly consistent with a canonical oddball response in the
tactile domain, confirming that unexpected touch is processed in the
brain by a hierarchy of both modality-specific areas (posterior thala-
mus, S1) and a more cross-modal network of regions likely involved
in orienting to salient events (AIC, MCC) and coordinating attention
and cognitive control (IFG, MFG).
Deviance responses have been extensively studied using electrophys-
iological measures (e.g. M/EEG), which capture the well-characterized
mismatch negativity (Garrido et al., 2009). Studies in the tactile domain
have previously demonstrated mismatch negativity responses to
sudden changes in stimulus location (Huang et al., 2005), intensity
(Chen et al., 2008), and frequency (Kekoni et al., 1997). Crucially, a pre-
vious study using the RSOT modelled the tactile mismatch negativity as
encoding Bayesian surprise, a computational measure of unsigned
prediction error (Ostwald et al., 2012). Interestingly that study found
that primary and secondary somatosensory cortices encoded an early
(140 ms) stimulus-locked rise in Bayesian surprise whereas fronto-
insular and cingulate sources showed a later response more associated
with the representation of stimulus changes; i.e., salience.
Here, we observed strong activation of both S1 and AIC to tactile
deviants, which was mediated by an increase in thalamic afference to
both areas. These areas were in turn found to directly influence cingu-
late and prefrontal cortex. A plausible interpretation of both Ostwald's

 and our own results is that the AIC and MCC jointly monitor the
precision (or reliability) of S1 responses. Precision has been linked to
both perceptual salience and attention (Feldman and Friston, 2010),
and – in predictive coding – enhances the influence of ascending predic-
tion errors via the neuromodulatory regulation of post-synaptic cortical
gain (Moran et al., 2013). Indeed, the AIC and MCC have been shown to
encode expected precision or volatility (Iglesias et al., 2013;
Schwartenbeck et al., 2014). More generally, the AIC and MCC are
thought to form part of a ‘salience network’ that facilitates rapid
orienting to important stimuli. Under predictive coding, salience (i.e.
the selection of behaviourally relevant stimuli to attend to) can be
operationalized as the precision-weighting of prediction errors by
post-synaptic modulatory gain (Feldman and Friston, 2010; Friston
et al., 2012). This formulation of hierarchical message passing is also
consistent with our observation that deviancy decreased (inhibitory)
intrinsic connectivity in lower regions of the tactile hierarchy. Physio-
logically, this corresponds to an increase in gain or excitability induced
by unpredicted stimuli. This sort of effect is thought to underlie the
mismatch negativity in the auditory domain, in which oddball stimuli
increase precision at the sensory levels of the auditory hierarchy, rela-
tive to higher levels encoding prior expectations. This increased gain ac-
counts for the larger evoked responses to tactile oddball stimuli
observed here.
Consistent with the interpretation that the anterior insula monitors
and regulates precision (i.e. reliability), we also found that deviancy sig-
nals bypassed S1 to directly modulate the AIC via thalamic afferents, in
addition to an indirect route via S1. Interestingly, one previous study
found that surprising painful stimuli bypass S1 to directly modulate
the AIC (Liang et al., 2013). Thalamic cells are capable of firing in both
tonic and ‘burst’ modes with the latter being important for the process-
ing of salient events (Sherman, 2005, 2007). Our finding that deviancy
directly modulated the AIC, which in turn regulated down-stream S1
responses, suggests that the region may monitor the precision of tha-
lamic outputs directly to enable fast awareness of and responding to
critical events (e.g., pain, unexpected touch). This recurrent thalamic–
insular–somatosensory loop is likely to be important for conscious
awareness of tactile changes.
Indeed, recurrent neural activity in the somatosensory hierarchy has
previously been shown to be important for somatosensory awareness
(Auksztulewicz et al., 2012); in general such cortical-subcortical loops
are thought to underlie conscious awareness (Dehaene et al., 2014).
Here we found that strong recurrent connectivity between the AIC
and somatosensory cortex supports the processing of tactile oddballs,
and that individual differences in the strength of backwards influences
from the PFC to AIC predicted the self-rated ease of detecting subtle
stimulus changes. These findings together suggest that the AIC coordi-
nates the global cortical processing of surprising bodily stimuli by
linking lower-level sensory regions to more attention and salience-
related areas in the prefrontal and cingulate cortex. In terms of predic-
tive coding, this linking is likely to be mediated by modulating the
precision of ascending prediction errors so that they exert greater influ-
ence on higher-level processing. As discussed above, an interesting
possible interpretation is that the AIC supports the emergence of a
deep hierarchical (c.f., global) workspace by monitoring and modulat-
ing the precision of ascending inputs (Bastos et al., 2012; Friston and
Kiebel, 2009). Future studies will benefit from directly manipulating
tactile precision, deviancy, and awareness in conjunction with compu-
tational modelling to address this possibility.
Finally, we observed a significant relationship between changes in
backwards connectivity and difficulty ratings, wherein participants
whose AIC was most strongly influenced by the PFC (during deviant
processing) also reported easier detection of stimulus changes. This
result links top-down effective connectivity to perceptual awareness,
consistent with predictive coding simulations of attention in the visual
domain (Feldman and Friston, 2010). This result thus establishes an in-
triguing link between the anterior insula and embodied active infer-
ence, providing criterion validity for our dynamic causal modelling
results (Pennington, 2003). Interestingly, in participants reporting the
lowest difficulty discriminating stimulus changes, the increases in
PFC to AIC connectivity effectively completed a cortical–subcortical

 recurrent loop between somatosensory and prefrontal cortex (compare
Figs. 4 and 5), in line with a role for the AIC in coordinating a global
neuronal workspace (Dehaene et al., 2014), and it may suggest an
inherently embodied aspect to this workspace, mediated by connec-
tions through the AIC.
Limitations and future directions
Although we interpret our results from the perspective of embodied
active inference, interpretive caution is called for when relating effective
connectivity results to computational schemes. Here, we used a bio-
physical model to capture directed neural influences between cortical
and subcortical areas, which are not “computational” in the sense of di-
rectly modelling cognitive–functional mechanisms (Friston and Dolan,
2010). Our interpretation of these results is based on growing evidence
that asymmetrical connections relate to specific computational vari-
ables (e.g. predictions, prediction errors and precision), and of repeated
demonstrations that mismatch responses are better described by Bayes-
ian prediction error minimization than other alternatives (Bastos et al.,
2015; Garrido et al., 2007, 2008; Lieder et al., 2013a). However, the pos-
sibility remains that another computational or functional theory may
explain our results. For example, Lamme and others emphasize the ne-
cessity of feedback connections for attention and conscious perception
(Bullier, 2001; Lamme et al., 1998). Here we also consider global
workspace interpretations as complementary to our interpretation of
recurrent S1-AIC activity underlying deviance perception. An important
issue for future research will be to fit various computational models to
the perception of bodily fluctuations, in order to evaluate how these
models explain changes in effective connectivity and conscious percep-
tion (see for example Vossel et al., 2015).
Finally, although here we tentatively interpret subjective ratings
of “how difficult was it to detect” stimulus changes as evidence for
a role of top-down AIC modulation in perception, this finding must
be treated with caution. Offline post-scan ratings can be subject to
a variety of biases. An alternative interpretation of these results is
that participants rated factors unrelated to level of sensory aware-
ness, such as general cognitive effort. We find this particular inter-
pretation unlikely however, because overall switch counts were
extremely accurate (mean accuracy = 99%) and participants did
not rate either condition as significantly more difficult to detect. In
general participants rated an average detection difficulty of 35%, sug-
gesting that it was generally easy to detect stimulus alternations.
These observations make it unlikely that the subjective ratings are
confounded by effort or vigilance, although previous studies do
show that counting versus passive oddball tasks elicit differential
prefrontal activity (Clark et al., 2001).
To further evaluate this finding, we explored whether a similar
pattern of modulation would be observed for the overall difference

probability among all models examined. The top middle panel (B) shows the posterior probability for all tested models. Model 255 had the highest probability of 0.79. Model 128 was the
next most probable with a posterior probability of 0.06, resulting in a Bayes factor of 13.17 for the full versus reduced model, corresponding to strong evidence that the full model was the
best explanation for the measured data within the tested model space. (C) Depiction of the winning full model (Model 255, far right peak in Fig. 3B), grey circles indicate modulation by the

 in felt intensity rating for both stimulus conditions (see DCM Re-
sults). This analysis failed to find any effect of intensity ratings, sug-
gesting that the top-down effect is specific to deviants themselves
and not to the overall perception of (standard and deviant) stimulus
intensity. To conclusively disambiguate this finding future research
is needed; here our primary focus was on the pattern of insula con-
nectivity evoked by oddballs, and our design was optimized accord-
ingly. An effective future approach to address this question would be
to modulate tactile expectations in a cued stimulus detection task
coupled with subjective confidence ratings, potentially while also
manipulating attention. Such an approach would better elucidate
the role of attentional control and/or metacognitive report bias in
modulating top-down connections and perceptual awareness of tac-
tile changes (Fleming and Lau, 2014).
Conclusion
This study demonstrates that attending to surprising tactile changes
recruits a hierarchic ensemble of sensory, salience, and attention-
related cortical areas. Our results illuminate the role of the insula in
coordinating hierarchical processing of surprising tactile stimuli. If the
AIC does coordinate dynamic interactions between these disparate
neural processes, for example via monitoring and modulating precision,
this would nuance the understanding of the “global neuronal
workspace” theory of consciousness (Dehaene et al., 2014) by anchoring
it in a fundamentally embodied network of sensory predictions.
Embodied inference may thus provide a framework for understanding
how particular predictive codes integrating bodily states and external
sensory inputs give rise to self-awareness. Understanding how the insula

from thalamus (TH), and primary somatosensory cortex (S1), to anterior insula (AIC) and mid-cingulate (MCC), before reaching prefrontal cortex (middle frontal gyrus, MFG). In contrast
to this feed-forward flow of modulatory influences, the AIC shows significant increases in both ‘forwards’ connections to cingulate and prefrontal cortex and ‘backwards’ connections with
S1, indicative of error comparison. Interestingly, TH, AIC, and S1 self-connections are strongly disinhibited by tactile deviants. All p-values false discovery rate corrected for multiple com-

 coordinates this complex interaction, how various sensory channels are
integrated and precision-weighted by contextual factors (Feldman and
Friston, 2010), and how these processes relate to subjective experience
and attention are critical areas for future research.
