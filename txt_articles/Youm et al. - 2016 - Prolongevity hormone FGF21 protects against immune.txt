Age-related thymic degeneration is associated with loss of naïve T
cells, restriction of peripheral T-cell diversity, and reduced health-
span due to lower immune competence. The mechanistic basis of
age-related thymic demise is unclear, but prior evidence suggests
that caloric restriction (CR) can slow thymic aging by maintaining
thymic epithelial cell integrity and reducing the generation of
intrathymic lipid. Here we show that the prolongevity ketogenic
hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a member of the
endocrine FGF subfamily, is expressed in thymic stromal cells along
with FGF receptors and its obligate coreceptor, βKlotho. We found
that FGF21 expression in thymus declines with age and is induced
by CR. Genetic gain of FGF21 function in mice protects against age-
related thymic involution with an increase in earliest thymocyte
progenitors and cortical thymic epithelial cells. Importantly, FGF21
overexpression reduced intrathymic lipid, increased perithymic brown
adipose tissue, and elevated thymic T-cell export and naïve T-cell fre-
quencies in old mice. Conversely, loss of FGF21 function in middle-aged
mice accelerated thymic aging, increased lethality, and delayed T-cell
reconstitution postirradiation and hematopoietic stem cell transplan-
tation (HSCT). Collectively, FGF21 integrates metabolic and immune
systems to prevent thymic injury and may aid in the reestablishment
of a diverse T-cell repertoire in cancer patients following HSCT.

T
he degenerative changes in thymus precede age-related loss
of function in other organs (1–4). As human lifespan con-
tinues to increase, it has been hypothesized that the ability to
retain a functional level of thymic lymphopoiesis beyond the time
limit set by evolutionary pressures may be an important strategy
to extend healthspan (3, 4). Therefore, the ability to enhance
thymic lymphopoiesis is thought to be central to the rejuvenation
of T-cell–mediated immune surveillance in the elderly (1–7).
Aging is associated with marked perturbations in the stromal cell
microenvironment of the thymus (8, 9). This includes a reduction
in thymopoiesis-supporting thymic epithelial cells (TECs) (10),
an increase in fibroblasts (11, 12), and emergence of adipocytes
(4, 13) of unknown origin and function. Accordingly, recent ef-
forts have focused on targeting TECs for the rejuvenation of the
aging thymus (12, 14). Emerging evidence indicates that immune–
metabolic interactions control several aspects of the thymic in-
volution process and age-related inflammation (13). We have
shown that byproducts of thymic fatty acids and lipids result in
accumulation of “lipotoxic DAMPs” (damage-associated mo-
lecular patterns), which triggers innate immune-sensing mecha-
nisms such as inflammasome activation that link aging to thymic
demise (15). Immune–metabolic interactions within the aging
thymus produce a local proinflammatory state that directly com-
promises the thymic stromal microenvironment, thymic lympho-
poiesis, and serves as a precursor of systemic immune dysregulation
in the elderly (5, 8). Despite progress in the field, the thymic growth
factors that regulate thymic involution are incompletely understood.
The fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) constitute a family of 22
proteins that regulate diverse biological processes such as growth,
development, differentiation, and wound repair (16). Prior studies
showed that FGF7/keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) adminis-
tration in aged mice partially reversed thymic involution (17–19).
Notably, unlike most FGFs, FGF21 lacks affinity for heparan
sulfate in the extracellular matrix and thus can be secreted to act
in an endocrine fashion (20). FGF21 is predominantly secreted
from liver but is also expressed in thymus (21). FGF21 is a pro-
longevity hormone that elicits it biological effects by binding to
βKlotho in complex with FGF receptor (FGFR) 1c, 2c, or 3c, but
not FGFR4 (16, 22, 23). FGF21 supports host survival during
states of energy deficit by increasing ketogenesis and fuel utiliza-
tion through mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (16, 23, 24). In-
terestingly, energy deficit induced by the prolongevity intervention
of caloric restriction (CR) reduces ectopic thymic lipid and
maintains thymopoiesis in aged mice (13). This raises the ques-
tion of whether signals that stimulate mobilization of ectopic
lipid mediate the salutary effects of CR on immune function.
Here we present evidence that FGF21 and βKlotho are coex-
pressed in TECs and maintain T-cell diversity in models of aging
and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) by enhancing
thymic function.
Results
FGF21 and βKlotho Are Expressed in Thymic Stromal Cells. Our initial
microarray profiling studies revealed that thymic Fgf21 expres-
sion declines with age. To confirm these findings, real-time PCR
analysis showed that aging is associated with a reduction in thymic
FGF21 mRNA expression, whereas CR significantly protected
against loss of Fgf21 expression in thymus (Fig. 1A). Consistent
with prior studies (17, 21), Fgf21 and FGF receptors are expressed
in thymus along with βKlotho (Klb) (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, al-
though thymic FGF21 is reduced with age (Fig. 1C), Klb and Fgfr1
Significance
Liver-derived metabolic hormone fibroblast growth factor 21
(FGF21) improves insulin sensitivity and extends lifespan in
mice. Aging also compromises the adaptive immune system by
reducing T-cell production from the thymus. In this paper, we
describe a new immunological function of FGF21 as a regulator
of T-cell production from thymus in aging. The overexpression
of FGF21 prevents thymic lipoatrophy, which protects the mice
from age-induced loss of naïve T cells. FGF21 expression in
thymic epithelial cells and signaling in thymic stromal cells
support thymic function in aging. Loss of FGF21 in mice in-
creases lethality postirradiation and delays the reconstitution
of thymus. Hence, we highlight FGF21 as an immunometabolic
regulator that can be harnessed to delay immune senescence.

 showed a reciprocal increase in expression (Fig. 1 D and E),
whereas no age-dependent regulation of Fgfr2, Fgfr3, or Fgfr4
was found (Fig. 1 F–H). In analyses of hematopoietic and stro-
mal cells from young and old mice, we found that Fgf21, Klb, and
Fgfr1 mRNA are predominantly expressed in thymic stromal
cells (TSCs) and regulated with aging (Fig. 1 I–K).
To further characterize FGF21 expression in thymus, we sor-
ted TECs (CD45−Epcam+) and fibroblasts (CD45−PDGFRα+)
from young mice. FGF21 mRNA expression was highest in TECs
(Fig. 1L), where it was present at greater than threefold higher
levels than in liver, the primary source of circulating FGF21.
Immunostaining of thymic cryosections revealed that βKlotho is
expressed in a subpopulation of Keratin8+ cortical TECs (Fig.
1M), some of which seem to be thymic nurse cells (25). In
complementary studies, we also examined whether βKlotho is
expressed in TECs expressing FoxN1, a transcription factor that
is critical for thymopoiesis (26). To do this, we used transgenic
mice harboring a fluorescent membrane dTomato/membrane
EGFP (mT/mG) Cre reporter construct (27) that marks FoxN1
Cre excision by a heritable switch from membrane-targeted
tdTomato expression to membrane-targeted EGFP expression.
Examination of Foxn1-Cre:mT/mG mice thymi revealed that
βKlotho is colocalized with Foxn1+ TECs (Fig. 1N). In addition,
βKlotho was expressed in endothelial cells of double-walled
postcapillary venules (PCVs) in the corticomedullary junction of
the thymus (Fig. 1O). PCVs are critical for import of hemato-
poietic stem cells into thymus and export of mature CD4 and
CD8 cells. These data suggest that FGF21 may regulate thymic
function by acting on both TECs and PCVs.
FGF21 Overexpression Prevents Age-Related Thymic Involution.
Given that Fgf21 expression in thymus decreases with aging, we
next investigated thymic status in a line of Fgf21-transgenic (tg)
mice that compared with WT animals show 50–100 times higher
circulating FGF21 concentrations (28). Therefore, the Fgf21tg
and WT littermates were aged up to 18 mo to examine the im-
pact of FGF21 overexpression on age-related thymic involution.
Consistent with an overall reduction in body weight and size (29),
the thymi and spleens of middle-aged Fgf21tg mice were signif-
icantly smaller than those of WT littermates (Fig. 2 A and B).
When normalized for total body weight, the thymic size as well as
cellularity of Fgf21tg mice were significantly higher than those of
the control littermates (Fig. 2 A and B). The male and female
Fgf21Tg mice do not display a difference in body weight (see Fig.
S2C). Overexpression of FGF21 did not alter the T-cell devel-
opment stages (Fig. S1 A and B), but when normalized to body
weight, FGF21 gain of function significantly (P < 0.05) increased
the total CD4 single-positive (CDSP), CD8 single-positive (CD8SP),
CD4+CD8+ double-positive (DP), and CD4−CD8− double-neg-
ative (DN) thymocyte subpopulations (Fig. 2C). In addition,
compared with WT controls, the middle-aged Fgf21tg mice dis-
played a significant reduction in Lin−Sca1+Kit+ (LSK) in bone
marrow (Fig. S1 C and D). However, the reduction in LSKs in
Fgf21tg mice was not associated with thymic involution and could
represent increased exit of these progenitors from bone marrow.
Hallmark features of thymic aging include loss of cortico-
medullary junctions and emergence of ectopic adipocytes (1–4).
Examination of thymic architecture revealed that in comparison
with age-matched WT littermates, 14-mo-old Fgf21tg mice dis-
played preservation of cortical and medullary cellularity (Fig. 2D
and Fig. S2A). Interestingly, overexpression of FGF21 was as-
sociated with a reduction in ectopic adipocytes in the subcapsular
zone of thymus (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, instead of the typical
accumulation of white adipocytes in the perithymic region of
middle-aged WT animals, the Fgf21tg mice had an increase in
brown adipose tissue adjacent to thymus (Fig. 2 D and E and Fig.
S2 A and B). These data agree with the prior finding that FGF21
causes browning of white adipose tissue (30).
The channelling of ectopic lipid into nonoxidative pathways
can lead to the generation of ceramides, which causes NLRP3
inflammasome-dependent thymic macrophage activation and
inflammation (3, 15). Interestingly, electron microscopy analysis
revealed that macrophages in the aging WT thymi contained
spiculate crystalline material reminiscent of Charcot–Leyden
crystals (Fig. 2 F and G) (31, 32), phagocytosed lipid droplets,
and large protein aggregates, suggesting defective autophagy.
There were also enlarged lysosomes with electrodense material
(Fig. 2F and Fig. S2 D and E), which are associated with NLRP3
inflammasome activation and thymic involution (15). Although
βKlotho is not expressed in macrophages (Fig. 1J), consistent
with reduced thymic damage, thymi from Fgf21tg mice had sig-
nificantly reduced macrophages with large crystals (Fig. S2D).

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 These data suggest that enhanced FGF21 signaling in TSCs re-
duces the overall burden of DAMP clearance by macrophages,
which may indirectly participate in lowering age-related thymic
inflammation.
Stromal cells in thymus, including cortical (c) and medullary
(m)TECs, are essential for T-cell development (10–12, 25).
Aging is associated with reduced proliferation and survival of
TECs (8, 9, 11). We found an increase in the number of cTECs
(Fig. 2H) without any change in mTECs in Fgf21tg mice (Fig.
S2F). Although mTECs predominate in thymus, the relative in-
crease in the cTEC:mTEC ratio in middle-aged mice is consis-
tent with prior studies (11). Aging is also associated with changes
in the composition of TSCs, with a typical increase in thymic
fibroblasts (8, 9, 11). The overexpression of FGF21 prevented
the age-related increase in thymic fibroblasts (Fig. 2I) and main-
tained the cTEC architecture (Fig. 2J). To determine the mech-
anism of FGF21’s effects on thymic function, we evaluated
whether FGF21 can act on thymic stroma. Consistent with our
finding that βKlotho and FGFRs are expressed in TSCs, FGF21
treatment induced the phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 2K), sug-
gesting that FGF21 acts directly on TSCs. Furthermore, the
preservation of cTEC function was reflected by increased ex-
pression of TEC-specific genes, early V antigen (Eva), and
growth factors such as Il7 and Fgf7 (Fig. 2L). No significant
changes in the expression of Aire, Beta5t, Dll4, or Rank were
observed between the thymi of 14-mo-old WT and Fgf21tg mice
(Fig. S2G). Together, these data suggest that FGF21 maintains
the thymic microenvironment during aging by lowering thymic
lipotoxicity and promoting TEC function.
T-cell development is dependent on lympho-stromal interactions
that control progression of the earliest thymocyte progenitors
(ETPs) into mature T cells (5–7). Age-related thymic involution
is also linked to reduction in frequency of ETPs (6). Interestingly,
overexpression of FGF21 significantly increased the frequency of
ETPs (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3A). Given that decline in T-cell di-
versity is one of the major mechanisms that contributes to im-
mune senescence and reduced immune surveillance in aging (33,
34), we next investigated the impact of FGF21 on peripheral
T-cell diversity in middle-aged mice. Interestingly, compared with
14-mo-old WT mice, age-matched Fgf21tg mice had a significant
increase in frequency of CD4 and CD8 naïve (CD62L+CD44lo)
cells and a reduction in age-induced expansion of effector
memory (E/M) cells (CD62L−CD44hi) (Fig. 3 B and C and Fig.
S3 F and G). Furthermore, examination of an additional cohort
of 18-mo-old Fgf21tg mice confirmed that FGF21 overexpression
protects against age-related loss of naïve and E/M T-cell ex-
pansion (Fig. 3 D and E and Fig. S3 H and I). Given that spleen
size and total splenocyte counts are lower (Fig. S3J) and pro-
portional to lower body weight in Fgf21tg mice, the total naïve
and E/M T-cell counts were normalized to body weight to rep-
resent the impact of FGF21 on T-cell diversity (Fig. S3 G and I).
Together, data from two cohorts (14 and 18 mo) aged in-
dependently in two separate mouse facilities (University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center and Yale School of Medicine)
demonstrate robust protective effects of FGF21 on T-cell senes-
cence that are not influenced by husbandry conditions that may
influence microbiota.
It is known that preexisting naïve T cells in the periphery can
also undergo proliferation to compensate for age-related re-
duction in thymic T-cell export (35, 36). Importantly, Klb is not
expressed in T cells, suggesting that FGF21 does not act directly
on peripheral T cells. To further evaluate thymic function, we
also quantified signal-joint T-cell receptor (TCR) excision circles
(sjTRECs) as a surrogate marker for recent thymic emigrants
(37, 38). Consistent with an increase in naïve T-cell frequency in
middle-aged Fgf21tg mice, the sjTREC content in splenic T cells
was also significantly higher than in control WT littermates (Fig.
3F), suggesting increased thymopoiesis. TCR diversity is con-
ferred by VJ and VDJ recombinations in complementarity de-
termining region 3 (CDR3) of newly generated T cells in thymus
(33, 39). Hence, each Vβ–Jβ combination is represented as a
Gaussian distribution of 6–10 CDR3 lengths with consecutive
addition of 3 bp representing in-frame rearrangement (40). The
CDR3 polymorphism analysis through TCR spectratyping revealed
that 14-mo-old Fgf21tg mice do not display significant perturbations
of TCR repertoire (Fig. S4A). Given that these mice are middle-
aged, no perturbations in other Vβ subtypes were observed (Fig.
S4B). Taken together, these data show that FGF21 prevents age-

 related deterioration of peripheral T-cell diversity indirectly by
increasing thymic T-cell production.
Loss of FGF21 Compromises Thymic Reconstitution. We next in-
vestigated whether loss of FGF21 function affects thymic aging.
The global FGF21-deficient mice do not display any changes in
total thymic cellularity or T-cell development and ETPs at
2–3 mo of age (Fig. 4A and Figs. S3 B–E and S5 A and B) in young
Fgf21−/− mice, suggesting that FGF21 is not required for thymic
development. Interestingly, by 1 y age of age, ablation of FGF21
was manifested in greater loss of total thymic cellularity (Fig.
4A). Compared with 12-mo-old littermate controls, Fgf21−/−
mice displayed a trend toward reduction in cTECs and mTECs
that did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 4B and Fig. S5E).
The middle-aged Fgf21−/− animals displayed significantly higher
loss of naïve T cells and greater frequencies and numbers of E/M
cells compared with age-matched littermate control animals (Fig.
4C and Fig. S5D). No changes in CD4 naïve and E/M subsets were
observed in young Fgf21−/− mice (Fig. S5C). These data suggest
that FGF21 deficiency with age accelerates thymic involution
and loss of naïve T cells.
Age-related thymic degeneration is a significant impediment
in cancer patients undergoing HSCT because the conditioning
regimens damage already reduced stromal cell niches in re-
cipient thymi (41–44). In elderly patients, the impaired T-cell
reconstitution due to thymic damage after HSCT results in
prolonged posttransplant T-cell deficiency and significant mor-
tality and morbidity (43). We found that compared with WT
mice there was increased mortality in Fgf21−/− mice that
underwent lethal irradiation and HSCT (Fig. 4D). This was not
due to reduced chimerism in bone marrow (Fig. S5F). Consistent
with an important role for FGF21 in thymic function, we found
that compared with WT mice the ablation of FGF21 significantly
reduced thymic reconstitution (Fig. 4E and Fig. S5G). Lack of
FGF21 in the host stromal compartment was associated with a
significant reduction in donor DPs without changes in the CD4SP
and CD8SPs (Fig. 4E and Fig. S5 H and I). These data suggest
that loss of FGF21-mediated immune–metabolic interactions im-
pairs thymic reconstitution following HSCT.
Discussion
Thymic involution likely occurs as a consequence of both in-
trinsic defects in thymocyte progenitors and a failure to maintain
a functional TEC compartment (5–7, 41). Aging reduces the
number of TECs with a concomitant increase in lipid-laden cells,
fibroblasts, and adipocytes (8, 9, 11). Among the FGF family,
FGF7/KGF promotes thymic lymphopoiesis by acting on TECs
(18, 19, 45). Unlike FGF7, FGF21 lacks the conventional FGF
heparin-binding domain and hence can diffuse away from its
cellular source of production to act in a paracrine or endocrine
manner (20). FGF21 requires βKlotho for its action and is known
to increase energy expenditure and exert antidiabetic and pro-
longevity effects (16, 22). Consistent with prior studies (29) and
similar to CR mice (13), overexpression of FGF21 increases brown
adipose tissue in the perithymic region and reduces ectopic lipid
within the thymic space, suggesting a reduction in thymic lipotoxicity.
Our data demonstrate a previously unidentified function of FGF21
as a prothymic molecule that is highly expressed in TECs and may

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 diffuse in thymus to signal via discrete subpopulations of βKlotho-
expressing Ker8+ cTECs, FoxN1+ TECs, and PCVs.
In addition, given that FGF21 increases lipid utilization, in-
cluding enhanced adipose tissue browning, it is likely that FGF21
reduces overall lipid-derived DAMPs in aging thymus. Crystals
are seldom formed spontaneously in mammalian tissues. Crystal-
storing histiocytosis is a rare disease associated with the accu-
mulation of crystalline material in macrophages and excessive
inflammation (31). Surprisingly, in thymi of aged mice, spiculate
crystal-containing macrophages were located in thymic medulla.
The crystalline material is reminiscent of Ym1-like Charcot–
Leyden crystals, which are linked to higher IL-1β secretion and
exuberant innate immune response (31, 32). Importantly, the
FGF21 coreceptor βKlotho is not expressed in macrophages
(Fig. 1J), suggesting that the reduction in ectopic lipid and crystals
in macrophages from Fgf21tg mice is secondary to an overall re-
duction in thymic involution rather than a direct effect on mac-
rophage NLRP3. Understanding precisely how aging and FGF21
overexpression regulates the generation of crystalline material in
thymic macrophages will require additional studies.
Prior studies showed that overexpression of FGF21 in mice
increases serum adiponectin levels, improves insulin sensitivity,
and extends lifespan by ∼40% (16). Given that aging of thymus
precedes the development of systemic metabolic abnormalities,
our data suggest that FGF21 acts directly on thymus. We have
previously published that Fgf21tg mice eat the same or more than
WT mice (16, 24). Thus, the effects on thymic biology observed
in Fgf21tg mice are not due to caloric restriction. Despite FGF21’s
robust effects on longevity and metabolism, Fgf21−/− mice do not
display overt changes in metabolism or lifespan, suggesting alter-
nate compensatory mechanisms.
With regard to thymic biology, the FGF21 gain and loss of
function studies revealed that FGF21 plays a role on maintaining
thymic microenvironment during aging, when the thymus un-
dergoes lipoatrophy. In addition, the increased lethality of FGF21-
deficient mice during the conditioning regimen of radiation
suggests that FGF21 is required for immune–metabolic interac-
tions that maintain homeostasis and protect against tissue
damage. Loss of FGF21 was accordingly associated with reduced
T-cell reconstitution in a clinical model of HSCT. However,
global deletion of Fgf21 in a knockout mouse model may not
mimic the much more discrete and gradual loss of thymic Fgf21
expression over time in aging. Thus, future studies using TEC
specific and inducible down-regulation of FGF21 signaling may
provide definitive insights on role of this pathway in thymic aging
and reconstitution.
FGF21 is currently being pursued for the treatment of obesity
and type 2 diabetes (46); our findings suggest that FGF21 also
exerts positive immunoregulatory effects. Taken together, our
data demonstrate that FGF21 links metabolic and immune sys-
tems and regulates peripheral T-cell homeostasis by preventing
age-related thymic degeneration.
Materials and Methods
Mice and Animal Care. The C57BL/6-Tg(Apoe-Fgf21)1Sakl/J mice C57BL/6J
Fgf21−/− and control littermates on C57BL6 background were obtained from
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Mice were housed in a
pathogen-free facility with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with free access to
food and water. All mice were fed a standard chow diet consisting of 4.5%
fat (5002; LabDiet). The WT and 40% caloric-restricted mice were obtained
from the National Institute on Aging Rodent Colony.
The lethal irradiation to ablate hematopoietic cells was performed using
an X-Rad300, X-ray small animal irradiator. One week before irradiation, the
recipient mice were be given acidified, antibiotic water. The lineage-depleted
bone marrow cells from CD45.1+ (B6.SJLPtprca Pep3b/BoyJ) were transplanted to
irradiated (750 cGy) syngeneic WT, Fgf21tg, and Fgf21−/− mice via tail vein
injection. The mice were killed 2 wk after the HSCT for analysis of T-cell
reconstitution. All experiments were in compliance with ref. 47 and were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Penning-
ton Biomedical Research Center and Yale University.
Flow Cytometry. To identify ETPs, thymocytes were labeled for lineage-pos-
itive cell by using PE-conjugated anti-CD11b, Gr-1, CD45R, CD3, CD8, αβTCR,
γδTCR, pan-NK, NK1.1, CD11c, CD19, Ter119, and CD127 antibodies but no
CD4 (eBioscience), followed by staining with APC-conjugated anti-CD25 and
FITC-conjugated anti–c-kit (eBioscience). The PE-labeled lineage-negative
cells lacking CD25 and expressing c-kit were designated as ETPs, as previously
described. For lymphocytes analysis after bone marrow transplantation,
thymocytes are stained for CD4, CD8, CD45.1, and CD45.2 cells followed by
staining with FITC-, PE-, PerCP-, and APC-conjugated antibodies (eBio-
science). To identify naïve and effecter or memory T cells, splenocytes were
incubated with PerCP-conjugated anti-CD4, APC-conjugated anti-CD8, PE-
conjugated anti-CD62L, and FITC-conjugated anti-CD44 antibodies. Anti-
MTS15 antibody for fibroblast analyses was a generous gift from Richard
Boyd, Monash University, Melbourne. All of the FACS data were analyzed by
postcollection compensation using FlowJo (Tree Star, Inc.) software.
Western Blot Analysis. We conducted the immunoblot analysis for phosphor-
ERK1, 2 in CD45- and TSCs as described previously (48). The protein immune
complexes were detected using specific fluorescent secondary antibodies
conjugated with IRDye 800CW (Rockland) and membranes were imaged
using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR).
Immunohistochemistry and Electron Microscopy. The thymi were collected from
mice and fixed in 4% (vol/vol) buffered paraformaldehyde and embedded in par-
affin and optimal cutting temperature compound then cut into 5- to 7-μm-thick
sections. Tissue sections were stained with H&E, UEA1/Troma1, KLB/keratin 8, and
KLB/MECA32. The images were acquired using Axiovert 40 microscope and Leica SP5
confocal microscope. The animals were perfused with paraformaldehyde fixative
and ultrathin thymus sections were cut on a Leica ultramicrotome into 70-nm-thick
sections, collected on Formvar-coated single-slot grids, analyzed with Tecnai 12
Biotwin EM (FEI), and evaluated and photographed in a JEM 1010 electron micro-
scope (JEOL) equipped with a Multiscan 792 digital camera (Gatan).
Real-Time RT-PCR. The total RNA from thymus tissue in different age time
point was extracted using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA
was digested by DNase (Invitrogen). The cDNA synthesis and real-time RT-PCR
was performed as described previously (Bio-Rad). Quantitative real-time RT-
PCR analyses were done in duplicate on the ABI PRISM 7900 Sequence
