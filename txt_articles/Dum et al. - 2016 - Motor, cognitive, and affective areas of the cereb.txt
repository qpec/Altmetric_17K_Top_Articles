Modern medicine has generally viewed the concept of “psychoso-
matic” disease with suspicion. This view arose partly because no
neural networks were known for the mind, conceptually associ-
ated with the cerebral cortex, to influence autonomic and endo-
crine systems that control internal organs. Here, we used
transneuronal transport of rabies virus to identify the areas of
the primate cerebral cortex that communicate through multisyn-
aptic connections with a major sympathetic effector, the adrenal
medulla. We demonstrate that two broad networks in the cerebral
cortex have access to the adrenal medulla. The larger network
includes all of the cortical motor areas in the frontal lobe and
portions of somatosensory cortex. A major component of this net-
work originates from the supplementary motor area and the cin-
gulate motor areas on the medial wall of the hemisphere. These
cortical areas are involved in all aspects of skeletomotor control
from response selection to motor preparation and movement ex-
ecution. The second, smaller network originates in regions of medial
prefrontal cortex, including a major contribution from pregenual
and subgenual regions of anterior cingulate cortex. These cortical
areas are involved in higher-order aspects of cognition and affect.
These results indicate that specific multisynaptic circuits exist to link
movement, cognition, and affect to the function of the adrenal me-
dulla. This circuitry may mediate the effects of internal states like
chronic stress and depression on organ function and, thus, provide a
concrete neural substrate for some psychosomatic illness.

veryone has experienced an “adrenaline rush,” an acute re-
sponse to stress. Cannon (1) showed a century ago that this
psychological experience and its physiological correlates (e.g.,
increased heart rate, sweating, pupillary dilation) involve secre-
tion from the adrenal medulla triggered by sympathetic neurons
in the thoracic spinal cord. He noted that these responses are
anticipatory, preparing the body for “fight or flight.”
Sympathetic activation is equally essential for precise, organ-
specific responses during exercise, exposure to heat or cold, and
hypoglycemia, and activation can occur during cognitive delib-
erations and stressful social situations (2, 3). For example, we all
have our own “hot buttons”—issues or events that can trigger an
immediate intense reaction. Commonly, the event can be a critical
remark from a supervisor, parent, or spouse. The most effective
behavior in these circumstances is neither fight nor flight, but
rather a more nuanced response that is adjusted to the context of
the situation. Clearly, the response to stress is subject to extensive
“top-down” or cognitive control (2, 4–6). Here, we used trans-
neuronal transport of rabies virus (RV) to identify the areas of the
cerebral cortex that are responsible for the top-down control of the
adrenal medulla in a nonhuman primate.
RV is transported exclusively in the retrograde direction and
moves transneuronally in a time-dependent manner (7). By varying
the survival time, it is possible to trace synaptically linked circuits
of up to six neurons in length. In the past, we have used the
transneuronal transport of RV to define the location of cortical
neurons that control specific muscles (8, 9) (Fig. 1, Left). Here,
we injected RV (N2c strain) into the adrenal medulla and set the
survival time in different animals to allow transport through
chains of 2–4 synaptically linked neurons (second-order animal:
n = 1; third-order animal: n = 1; fourth-order animals: n = 4)
(Fig. 1, Right, and Fig. S1). Infected neurons were distributed
throughout the brainstem and diencephalon in second- to fourth-
order animals in patterns comparable to those described for ro-
dents when similar studies were performed by using pseudorabies
virus (10). This report will focus on the distribution of infected
neurons in the cerebral cortex.
We first observed substantial numbers of infected neurons
(mean = 5,232) in the cerebral cortex in fourth-order animals.
Most of these infected neurons were located in layer V, the main
source of descending outputs from the cerebral cortex (Fig. S2).
Retrograde transneuronal transport of RV from an injection site
in the adrenal medulla infected neurons largely (87%) in two
nonoverlapping sets of cortical areas: a “motor” network (11–13)
and a “medial prefrontal” network (14) (Fig. 2). Small numbers
of infected neurons also were located in areas within the lateral
sulcus (∼7%) and orbitofrontal cortex (∼3%).
The motor network was the major source of descending in-
fluence over the adrenal medulla (63% of all labeled neurons)
(Fig. 2F). This network included all seven of the cortical motor
areas in the frontal lobe and specific regions of somatosensory
cortex (areas 3a, 1, 2) and posterior parietal cortex (area 5) (Figs.
2 and 3). All of the motor areas projected primarily to the
contralateral adrenal medulla (contralateral to ipsilateral ratio
∼85:15) except for the rostral cingulate motor area (CMAr),
Significance
How does the “mind” (brain) influence the “body” (internal
organs)? We identified key areas in the primate cerebral cortex
that are linked through multisynaptic connections to the ad-
renal medulla. The most substantial influence originates from a
broad network of motor areas that are involved in all aspects
of skeletomotor control from response selection to motor prep-
aration and movement execution. A smaller influence originates
from a network in medial prefrontal cortex that is involved in the
regulation of cognition and emotion. Thus, cortical areas in-
volved in the control of movement, cognition, and affect are
potential sources of central commands to influence sympathetic
arousal. These results provide an anatomical basis for psycho-
somatic illness where mental states can alter organ function.

 which projected bilaterally. The strongest projections originated
from the “trunk” representation of the primary motor cortex
(M1), from the dorsal premotor area (PMd) on the lateral sur-
face of the hemisphere, and from the four motor areas on the
medial wall of the hemisphere [the supplementary motor area
(SMA), and the rostral, dorsal, and ventral cingulate motor areas
(CMAr, CMAd, and CMAv)]. Each of the cortical motor areas
has a human equivalent. On the medial wall, the CMAr and
CMAv of the monkey are considered to be the rostral cingulate
zone (RCZ) in humans and the CMAd is the caudal cingulate
zone (CCZ) in humans (15, 16) (Fig. 4 A–C).
The cortical areas that form the motor network are richly
interconnected (12, 13). Furthermore, all of these cortical motor
areas project directly to the spinal cord (11, 13) and to regions of
the reticular formation (17). Thus, descending cortico-spinal and
corticobulbo-spinal pathways may mediate some or all of the
influence of the motor network on the adrenal medulla (Fig. 5
and Fig. S1). This conclusion is supported by classic studies that
demonstrated that surface stimulation in restricted regions of
M1 and the PMd evoked changes in blood pressure (18). These
changes survived lesions of the fifth nerve and hypothalamus, but
were abolished by lesions of the pyramidal tract (18, 19).
The medial prefrontal network represented nearly 25% of the
descending cortical output to the adrenal medulla (Fig. 2F). This
network originated from multiple, distinct regions of medial
prefrontal cortex on the medial wall of the hemisphere and on
the lateral surface of the hemisphere (Figs. 2 and 3). Ipsilateral
projections from the medial prefrontal network to the adrenal
medulla were approximately twice as numerous as the contra-
lateral projections. The core of this network originated from two
regions of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)—a “pregenual” re-
gion including portions of areas 32 and 24 and a “subgenual”
region consisting mainly of area 25 (Figs. 2 and 3). Comparable
pregenual and subgenual regions of the ACC have been identi-
fied in humans (Fig. 4 A–C) (20–22).
The pregenual and subgenual regions of the anterior cingulate
cortex are densely interconnected (14). These cortical areas in
nonhuman primates do not project directly to the spinal cord.
Instead, neurons in these regions were probably infected through
their reported projections to the medullary reticular formation,
hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray (14, 17, 23), which, in
turn, project to brainstem sympathetic nuclei and to the spinal
cord (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1) (24–26).
To identify cortical areas that may be less directly connected
to the adrenal medulla, we extended the survival time to allow
transport through chains of 5–6 synaptically linked neurons
(fifth-order animals: n = 2; and sixth-order animals: n = 2).
Prolonging the survival time resulted in a dramatic increase (20- to
100-fold) in the numbers of labeled neurons in the cerebral cortex
(fifth order, mean = ∼104,000; sixth order, mean = ∼480,000).
Large numbers of labeled neurons were located not only in layer
V, but also in supra- and infragranular layers of cortex. However,
the cortical areas with dense labeling (i.e., local peak density, top
15% of bins) in sixth-order animals remained the same as those
that were densely labeled in fourth-order animals (Figs. 2 and 3).
As with the shorter survival times, smaller concentrations of in-
fected neurons also were located in cortical areas in the lateral
sulcus (<11%) and in regions of orbitofrontal cortex (<6%). No
other cortical regions contained more than 2% of the labeled
neurons. Thus, independent of the survival time, the motor and
prefrontal networks are the major sources of descending influ-
ence over the adrenal medulla.
Discussion
Our results have a number of important functional implications.
First, they emphasize the importance of the cortical motor areas

Mind–body circuits. (Left) Cortical pathways to muscles (8, 9). Cortical areas on the lateral surface and the medial wall of the hemisphere are the
source of neurons that project to the spinal cord and influence motoneurons that innervate muscles. Inset (cortico-motor circuits) is a schematic diagram of
the circuits that connect neurons in motor areas of the cerebral cortex to single muscles. When RV is injected into a muscle, it is transported transneuronally in

 in the top-down influence over the adrenal medulla. Normal
limb and body movements are accompanied by coordinated
changes in sympathetic output that are proportional to the
metabolic demands of the task. An important component of this
sympathetic activity is thought to be due to a “central command”
that can precede any change in muscle activity (4–6). This
command is a “predictive” response because it prepares the body
to meet the anticipated metabolic needs of activities like exer-
cise, emotional states, and fight or flight. Our results suggest that
the central commands to prepare for and generate visceromotor

 output originate from the same cortical areas that are involved in
the preparation and generation of skeletomotor output. The
colocalization of visceromotor and skeletomotor function may
provide a mechanism to facilitate the coordination of these two
motor systems (Fig. 5).
Second, we found that the top-down influence over the adrenal
medulla by M1 originates largely from its trunk representation.
This region of M1 projects to thoracic segments of the spinal cord
(27). These spinal segments also contain the sympathetic pre-
ganglionic neurons that form the final common pathway to the
adrenal medulla (10). These observations suggest that there is a
link between the descending control of “core muscles” and the
regulation of sympathetic output. This link could provide a neural
substrate for the control of stress through “core” exercises, such as
yoga and pilates (28).
Third, our results indicate that a major component of the
cortical influence over the adrenal medulla arises from multiple
motor and nonmotor areas on the medial wall of the hemisphere
(Figs. 2, 3, and 5B). This finding differs from the view that
autonomic outflow from the cingulate cortex originates from a
single region, the subgenual ACC (22). Our perspective is sup-
ported by functional imaging data from human studies that show
clusters of activations associated with sympathetic arousal in
multiple areas of the cingulate cortex including the RCZ, CCZ,
and pregenual ACC (Fig. 4C).
The human counterparts of the CMAr, CMAv, CMAd, and
pregenual and subgenual ACC (Fig. 4 A and B) all display ac-
tivation in tasks that are associated with negative affect (Fig.
4D). The RCZ of humans and the CMAr of monkeys are con-
sistently activated in tasks requiring “cognitive control” such as
response selection, conflict, and error awareness (Fig. 4E) (22,
29–32). In essence, our results provide the neural circuitry that
links negative affect (e.g., sadness) and cognitive control pro-
cesses (e.g., awareness of errors) to stress responses. The same
substrate may mediate comparable stress responses when a sad
situation or an error is recalled. Furthermore, abnormal activa-
tion of this circuitry may be fundamental to conditions like
posttraumatic stress disorder.
The cortical areas we have identified as regulating the adrenal
medulla overlap substantially with those included in “depression
networks” (20, 21). One node in this network, subgenual ACC,
displays histological changes in subjects with bipolar familial
depression (21), and deep brain stimulation near subgenual ACC
mitigates some symptoms of depression (20, 33) (Fig. 4F). Another
node in the network, the pregenual ACC, is a site of activation
during mindful meditation (Fig. 4F), a behavioral technique for
reducing anxiety. Similarly, the pregenual ACC in monkeys ap-
pears to be uniquely linked with reward-related systems in the
basal ganglia (34) and to be involved in regulating anxiety and
emotional valence while deciding on a course of action (22, 35–
37). Taken together, these findings raise the possibility that the
areas of the cerebral cortex that influence the adrenal medulla
(Fig. 5) also are key cortical nodes of a “stress and depression
connectome.” Perhaps some of these nodes represent additional
targets for therapeutic intervention in affective disorders.
In summary, the control of the adrenal medulla is embedded
in cortical areas that are involved in the control of movement,
cognition and affect (Fig. 5). This means that mental operations
like the preparation to move, the appreciation of conflict and
feelings of sadness may be linked to the regulation of adrenal
function. The cerebral cortex is a site of neural plasticity and
information storage. As a consequence, aberrant plasticity could
be a cause of or contribute to psychosomatic illnesses, just as the
engagement of cortical plasticity through moving, thinking and
feeling may help to cure or ameliorate them.

 Materials and Methods
This report is based on observations from Cebus monkeys (1.4–3.7 kg; 3 male,
6 female), which received injections of RV (CVS-N2c; 5.0 × 108 pfu/mL) into
the adrenal medulla. RV was especially useful for these experiments because
current evidence indicates that RV is transported transneuronally in all types
of systems and across all types of synapses (38–40). In addition, there is no
evidence that the N2c strain is transported more efficiently in some path-
ways than others.
All procedures were in accordance with the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and the National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The experimental protocol
was approved by both the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and
the Biosafety Committee at the University of Pittsburgh. Biosafety practices
conformed to Biosafety Level 2 regulations outlined in Biosafety in Micro-
biological and Biomedical Laboratories (41). Procedural details for handling
virus and virus-infected animals have been published (38).
Adrenal Medulla Injections. Surgeries were performed under general anes-
thesia [15 mg/kg Ketamine IM for sedation and 1–3% (vol/vol) isoflurane in
1–3 liters/min O2 for general anesthesia] and aseptic conditions. Analgesics
(buprenorphine 0.01–0.03 mg/kg s.c.) were given perioperatively. The left ad-
renal medulla was accessed via a paralumbar incision. We placed multiple RV
injections (total of 80–100 μL) throughout the central regions of the adrenal
gland by using a Hamilton microsyringe with a 30-gauge needle. The in-
jection syringe was held in place for 30 s. After removal of the injection
needle, the site was blotted with a sterile cotton swab to prevent any
leakage through the injection tract. Following the injections, the wound was
sutured, and the animal was returned to a cage designed for housing virus-
infected animals.
Survival Period. We varied the survival times from 97 to 136 h. The mean
survival times were 120.2 h (fourth-order labeling, n = 4), 126.8 h (fifth-order
labeling, n = 2), and 131.5 h (sixth-order labeling, n = 2). At the end of the
survival period, each animal was sedated with ketamine (25 mg/kg), deeply
anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg IP), and perfused trans-
cardially with three solutions: (i) 0.1 M phosphate buffer, (ii) formalin
(3.7 gm formaldehyde gas/100 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer), and (iii) 10%
(vol/vol) glycerol. Two to three liters of each solution was delivered over a
period of 7–10 min per solution. After perfusion, the brains and spinal cords
were removed and stored at 4 °C in 10% (vol/vol) phosphate-buffered for-
malin with 20% (vol/vol) glycerol.
Histological Procedures. We cut serial frozen sections (50 μm) in the coronal
plane of a brain block including the cerebral cortex from its rostral pole to
the parietal-occipital sulcus. The cerebellum and brainstem were cut sepa-
rately. We also cut serial frozen sections (50 μm) of a spinal cord block
containing the fourth thoracic segment (T4) to the first lumbar segment (L1)
in the transverse plane. We stained every 10th section of the brain and every
20th of the spinal cord with cresyl violet to enable analysis of cytoarchi-
tecture. To identify virus-infected neurons, we performed immunohisto-
chemical reactions on free-floating sections according to the avidin-biotin
peroxidase method (Vectastain; Vector Laboratories). The reactions used a
mouse monoclonal antibody (M957, diluted 1:300; supplied by A. Wandeler,
Animal Disease Research Institute, Nepean, ON, Canada) that is specific for
the P antigen expressed by RV (42). All reacted sections were mounted on
gelatin-coated glass slides, air-dried, and coverslipped with Cytoseal.
Analytic Procedures. Sections through the entire brain (every fourth or eighth)
and spinal cord (every 10th) were examined under the microscope for re-
action product by using brightfield and/or polarized light illumination. An-
other series of sections (every 10th) was stained and examined for
cytoarchitecture. We plotted section outlines, labeled neurons, gray-white
matter boundaries, cytoarchitectonic borders, and other anatomic features
by using a computer-based charting system (MD2 or MD3; Accustage). Then,
we used these plots along with software written in the laboratory to create
unfolded cortical maps that displayed the distribution of labeled neurons,
cortical sulci, and cytoarchitectonic borders on a 2D surface. The procedures
used to unfold the cortex and generate maps of the lateral surface and medial
wall of the hemisphere have been described (11). The criteria we used to
define cytoarchitectonic borders in the cebus monkey have been presented
in prior studies (refs. 12 and 43; see also ref. 44). To create the composite
maps (Fig. 2 C and D), we overlaid the unfolded maps from four of the
fourth-order animals. Then, the unfolded maps of the lateral surface were
aligned on the central and arcuate sulci and the medial edge of the hemi-
sphere. The maps of the medial wall were aligned on the anterior posterior
extent of the corpus callosum and the medial edge of the hemisphere. The
maps of individual animals required only small shifts (<1 mm) in the ante-
rior-posterior and medio-lateral directions to achieve a best fit.
Determining Order of Transport. Survival time, in and of itself, is not sufficient
to define the number of synapses mediating transneuronal transport (i.e.,
order of transport) in any experiment. Instead, we use the distribution of
infected neurons within well-established pathways as internal controls (Fig. 1,
Right). Specifically, after injections of rabies into the adrenal medulla, we
determined the order of transport based on the following patterns of la-
beling: third-order transport, infected neurons are first seen in layer V of the
cerebral cortex; fourth-order transport, infected neurons are first seen in
cortical layers outside of layer V and in the deep cerebellar nuclei; fifth-order
transport, infected neurons are first seen in cerebellar cortex (i.e., Purkinje
cells); and sixth-order transport, infected neurons are first seen in the
inferior olive.
