Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction and accumulation of damaged mito-
chondria are considered major contributors to aging. However, the
molecular mechanisms responsible for these mitochondrial alter-
ations remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mitofusin 2
(Mfn2) plays a key role in the control of muscle mitochondrial
damage. We show that aging is characterized by a progressive
reduction in Mfn2 in mouse skeletal muscle and that skeletal
muscle Mfn2 ablation in mice generates a gene signature linked to
aging.
Furthermore,
analysis
of
muscle
Mfn2-deficient
mice
revealed that aging-induced Mfn2 decrease underlies the age-
related alterations in metabolic homeostasis and sarcopenia. Mfn2
deficiency reduced autophagy and impaired mitochondrial quality,
which contributed to an exacerbated age-related mitochondrial
dysfunction. Interestingly, aging-induced Mfn2 deficiency triggers
a ROS-dependent adaptive signaling pathway through induction of
HIF1a transcription factor and BNIP3. This pathway compensates
for the loss of mitochondrial autophagy and minimizes mitochon-
drial damage. Our findings reveal that Mfn2 repression in muscle
during aging is a determinant for the inhibition of mitophagy and
accumulation of damaged mitochondria and triggers the induction
of a mitochondrial quality control pathway.

Introduction
Aging is a process characterized by a progressive accumulation of
damage that leads to tissue dysfunction and failure. Skeletal muscle
is one of the tissues most affected by aging. During aging, there is a
gradual loss of muscle mass and function (sarcopenia), which are
associated with frailty and a reduction in quality of life in the elderly
(Cesari et al, 2014). In addition, skeletal muscle alterations play a
central role in aging-associated metabolic dysregulation (Dela &
Kjaer, 2006). Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms
causing
aging-induced
skeletal
muscle
alterations
is
of
great
importance for healthy aging (de Cabo et al, 2014).
A hallmark of aging is the presence of a decline in mitochondrial
function in skeletal muscle associated with accumulation of mito-
chondrial damage, abundant morphological alterations in mitochon-
dria (e.g., rounded and giant mitochondria), reduced mitochondrial
respiration, and increased oxidative stress (Shigenaga et al, 1994;
Preston et al, 2008; Artal-Sanz & Tavernarakis, 2009; Bratic &
Larsson, 2013). Recent data indicate that aging is characterized by
impaired mitophagy in C. elegans, which may explain the accumu-
lation of damaged mitochondria (Palikaras et al, 2015). However,
there is still debate about whether mitochondrial deficiency could
be driving some of the age-related alterations or on the contrary,
age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction might be secondary to
aging itself (Bratic & Larsson, 2013).
Mitochondrial dynamics is a crucial process not only for
mitochondrial morphology but also in the control of mitochondrial
function, response to apoptotic stimuli, and mitochondrial quality
control (Twig et al, 2008; Liesa et al, 2009). Mitochondrial dynam-
ics is controlled by fusion and fission proteins. Mitofusin 1 and 2

 involved in fusion of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Fission of
mitochondria is controlled by Fis1, Drp1, and Mff proteins. A
correct balance between fusion and fission is essential for mito-
chondrial function and cellular homeostasis (Liesa & Shirihai,
2013).
Besides its role in mitochondrial fusion, Mfn2 has been described
to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, oxidative meta-
bolism, autophagy, mitophagy, mitochondrial antiviral signaling,
and unfolded protein response (Bach et al, 2003; Chen et al, 2004;
Yasukawa et al, 2009; Hailey et al, 2010; Ngoh et al, 2012; Zhao
et al, 2012; Chen & Dorn, 2013; Munoz et al, 2013). Recently, we
have elucidated the role of Mfn2 in skeletal muscle in vivo. Defi-
ciency of Mfn2 in skeletal muscle leads to reduced mitochondrial
respiration and increased oxidative stress leading to inhibition of
insulin signaling. As a result, high-fat-fed Mfn2-deficient mice show
glucose intolerance and greater insulin resistance, which highlights
the importance of Mfn2 in the maintenance of normal muscle
metabolism (Sebastian et al, 2012).
Here, we analyzed the role of Mfn2 during aging. We show that
Mfn2
protein
expression
decreases
during
aging
in
skeletal
muscle and deficiency of Mfn2 in young mice aggravates the age-
associated
whole-body
metabolic
alterations
and
sarcopenia,
mainly as a result of impaired autophagy and mitochondrial qual-
ity. Furthermore, aging and reduction in Mfn2 trigger an adaptive
signaling pathway involving HIF1a in order to minimize the accu-
mulation of damaged mitochondria. Overall, the data presented
here describe a new role for Mfn2 connecting mitochondrial
function and quality to the maintenance of metabolism and muscle
fitness during aging.
Results
Mfn2 expression in skeletal muscle decreases during aging and
generates a gene signature characteristic of aged muscle
It has not been evaluated in mammals whether mitochondrial
dynamics has an impact on aging. Based on the functional relevance
of mitochondrial fusion and fission factors, we decided to analyze
whether the mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) plays
a role in aging. We show that Mfn2 protein expression is markedly
reduced in skeletal muscles in old mice (Figs 1A and EV1A), to a
lesser extent in heart and no changes were detectable in liver
(Fig EV1B). Mfn2 downregulation occurred in the absence of
changes in the expression of other mitochondrial proteins such as
Porin or ATP5a (Fig 1A). Moreover, analysis of Mfn2 expression in
young adult (6-month-old), middle aged (12-month-old), and old
(22-month-old) mice revealed that the decrease of Mfn2 protein
expression was progressive during aging (Fig EV1C). Reduction in
Mfn2 was not a consequence of reduced gene expression (Fig EV1D)
or lower availability of Mfn2 mRNA for translation, as indicated by
the lack of changes of Mfn2 mRNA levels in polysomal fractions,
containing
actively
translated
mRNAs
bound
to
ribosomes
(Fig EV1E). These results suggest that reduced Mfn2 expression in
aged muscle may be a consequence of changes in protein turnover.
In addition to Mfn2, the expression of other mitochondrial dynamics
proteins, such as Mfn1, OPA1, and Fis1 but not Drp1, was reduced
during aging in skeletal muscle (Fig EV1F).
To gain insight into the consequences of Mfn2 repression in
muscle during aging, and the identification of the mechanisms
involved,
we
used
Mef2C-Cre+/�Mfn2LoxP/LoxP
mice
(Mfn2KO
mice) as reported previously (Sebastian et al, 2012). Mfn2KO mice
showed an 80% reduction in Mfn2 expression in muscle and heart,
and a 50% reduction in other tissues such as WAT, kidney, or
liver (Sebastian et al, 2012). We performed transcriptomic analysis
in
muscle
from
6-month-old
control
and
Mfn2KO
mice
and
22-month-old control and Mfn2KO mice. Deficiency of Mfn2 in
skeletal muscle caused a deregulation of 186 genes in young mice
and of 53 genes in old mice (Fig 1B). Aging caused a change in
expression of 2,550 genes in control mice (Fig 1C). Interestingly,
62% of genes deregulated in Mfn2KO young mice were also
altered during aging in control mice (Fig 1B and C, Table EV1).
Moreover, these genes were further deregulated in Mfn2KO old
mice compared with control old mice (Fig 1C). GSEA analysis of
transcriptomic data further revealed that genes deregulated by
Mfn2 deficiency were significantly enriched during normal aging in
control mice (Fig 1D). These alterations occurred in the absence of
changes
in
the
expression
of
other
mitochondrial
dynamics
proteins in Mfn2KO mice (Fig EV1F). Analysis of life span revealed
no changes in Mfn2KO mice compared to control mice (Fig EV1G).
Therefore, all these results indicate that Mfn2 decreases with aging
in mouse skeletal muscle, which participates in the generation of
an aging gene signature.
Mfn2 deficiency in skeletal muscle enhances age-induced
mitochondrial dysfunction
Mfn2 controls mitochondrial respiration (Bach et al, 2003; Sebastian
et al, 2012; Segales et al, 2013). Therefore, we analyzed mitochon-
drial oxygen consumption in isolated muscle fibers from young and
old control and Mfn2KO mice. Mitochondrial respiration was
reduced during aging in control mice and further decreased in old
Mfn2KO mice (Fig 2A). These alterations were restricted to skeletal
muscle, and other tissues such as liver, heart, and WAT did not
show any changes in mitochondrial respiration in Mfn2KO mice
(Appendix Figs S1A and S2B and C). Alterations in muscle oxygen
consumption were independent of major changes in protein expres-
sion
of
subunits
of
respiratory
electron
transport
chain
(Appendix Fig S1D), mitochondrial mass (Fig 2B), and ATP content
in skeletal muscle (Appendix Fig S1E). Glucose oxidation in soleus
muscles was also decreased during aging or in Mfn2KO mice
(Appendix Fig S1F). NADH-TR and SDH staining were decreased in
young Mfn2KO mice and during aging in control mice, and further
reduced in old Mfn2KO mice, confirming a decreased oxidative
capacity during aging and Mfn2-deficiency conditions (Fig 2C and D).
Mfn2 deficiency was also characterized by higher levels of hydro-
gen peroxide and enhanced protein carbonylation indicating an
enhanced oxidative stress (Fig 2E and F). Activity of antioxidant
enzymes was modified by aging, but no changes were detected
between genotypes, except for glutathione peroxidase, which is
increased in young Mfn2KO mice (Appendix Fig S1G–J). Mfn2
reduction was not associated with an increase in mtDNA mutations
as evidenced by the lack of changes in the number of COX
negative/SDH-positive fibers (Appendix Fig S1K). Ultrastructural
morphometric analysis of muscle sections revealed the presence of
abnormalities in mitochondria from aged mice such as increased

 mitochondrial area and decreased mitochondrial density (Fig 2G
and Appendix Fig S1L). These alterations were more extreme in
Mfn2KO old mice (Fig 2G and Appendix Fig S1L). Moreover,
Mfn2KO old mice showed a greater abundance of aberrant mito-
chondria, swollen mitochondria, or organelles with
disrupted
cristae (Fig 2H). In all, our data indicate that Mfn2 deficiency in
skeletal muscle causes the development of age-related alterations
in mitochondrial function and are coherent with the view that
Mfn2 repression that occurs with aging plays a role in the develop-
ment of mitochondrial dysfunction in this condition.
Decrease of Mfn2 during aging is a contributing factor for age-
related metabolic disorders
Skeletal muscle plays an important role in the maintenance of meta-
bolic homeostasis in vivo (Rolfe & Brown, 1997). On the basis of the
impact of Mfn2 deficiency on mitochondrial function and oxidative
capacity in skeletal muscle, we tested whether these alterations
could have a role in the metabolic alterations that are common to
aging, such as glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and lower
energy expenditure (Niccoli & Partridge, 2012). Body weight was

 increased in Mfn2KO old mice compared to controls (Fig 3A) as a
result of an increase in adiposity (Fig 3B), with no changes in the
weight of liver, heart, or brain (Appendix Fig S2A) and without
changes in food intake (Appendix Fig S2B). Moreover, by using
indirect calorimetry, we showed that during aging there is a
decrease in whole-body oxygen consumption in control mice which
is further decreased in Mfn2KO old animals (Fig 3C and D). Activity
was also reduced in Mfn2KO old mice in the night-active period
(Fig 3E). Glucose oxidation fluxes also decreased during aging in
both diurnal and nocturnal phases, and a greater reduction was
detected in Mfn2KO mice (Fig 3F). Lipid oxidation in the diurnal
phase were equally reduced by aging in both genotypes (Fig 3G).
However, lipid oxidation was higher in Mfn2KO animals during the
night irrespective of age, indicating a lower suppression of lipid
oxidation during the night-feeding period (Fig 3G). This pattern is
consistent with the presence of metabolic inflexibility in Mfn2KO
mice.
Previously, we reported that 12-month-old Mfn2KO mice showed
enhanced susceptibility to develop insulin resistance compared to
control animals (Sebastian et al, 2012). However, no changes in

 22-month-old mice and we found that at this age, Mfn2KO mice
were glucose intolerant (Fig 3H), showed greater insulin levels
during the glucose tolerance test (Fig 3I) and were profoundly
insulin resistant (Fig 3J). Metabolic analysis of 6-, 12-, and 22-
month-old mice showed that the impaired metabolic homeostasis
(basal insulinemia, insulin levels during the glucose tolerance test,
and insulin tolerance test) was gradual during aging, but in
Mfn2KO, this process was accelerated (alterations normally seen at
22 months in control mice were already detectable in 12-month-old
Mfn2KO mice) (Appendix Fig S2C–E). Basal levels of Akt phospho-
rylation were reduced in old mice, indicating a lower basal insulin
signaling, and AMPK phosphorylation was increased only in old
Mfn2KO mice, probably as a result of alterations in the energy status
(Appendix Fig S2F). Overall, our results documented that Mfn2
downregulation during aging plays a relevant role in the triggering
of age-related metabolic alterations.
Mfn2 deficiency induces muscle atrophy and
increases sarcopenia
During aging, there is a gradual loss of muscle mass and function
(sarcopenia) (Cesari et al, 2014). It has been postulated that
mitochondrial dysfunction is a contributing factor, although the
mechanisms involved have not yet been elucidated (Marzetti et al,
2013). Based on the effects of Mfn2 deficiency on other age-related
abnormalities, we analyzed whether Mfn2 could have a role in this
process. Muscles from young Mfn2KO showed a moderate reduc-
tion in mass (Fig 4A) and a greater reduction in muscle fiber size
as assessed by cross-sectional area (CSA) (Fig 4B and C). During
aging, there is a reduction in muscle mass in both genotypes, but
CSA was lower in old Mfn2KO mice compared to age-matched
controls (Fig 4A–C). Analysis of fiber size distribution confirmed
these results, showing that aging or Mfn2 deficiency led to an
increased number of small fibers and a reduced number of larger
fibers (Fig 4C). Further analyses revealed that muscle atrophy in
Mfn2-deficient mice and during normal aging was due to the speci-
fic atrophy of type IIb glycolytic fibers (Fig 4F). Type IIb repre-
sents the majority of fibers
in gastrocnemius,
and
although
oxidative
fibers
are
usually
smaller
than
glycolytic
fibers
(Hamalainen & Pette, 1993), only minor changes in the proportion
of fiber types were detected by Mfn2 deficiency in young mice,
corresponding to slight increases of type I and IIx fibers (Fig 4D
and E).
The increased muscle atrophy in Mfn2KO mice together with the
reduced ambulation detected in indirect calorimetry studies (Fig 3E)
suggests an impaired muscle function in Mfn2KO old mice. To
investigate muscle performance, we performed treadmill and grip
strength test in control and Mfn2KO mice. Old Mfn2KO mice
showed lower physical capacity, as revealed by a decrease in the
total time and distance ran on the treadmill (Fig 4G), which corre-
lated with reduced grip strength (Fig 4H). We next assessed muscle
mechanical properties on isolated muscles ex vivo. Muscles from old
Mfn2KO mice showed a decreased capacity to increase their force
after tetanic stimulation compared to the old control group (Fig 4I).
Detailed
graphical
analyses
of
muscle
contraction
parameters
showed an increase in the twitch to tetanus ratio, half relaxation
time and in contraction time in muscles from old Mfn2KO mice
(Fig 4J–L). Of note, these parameters have been reported to be
altered with aging in both rodents and humans (Campbell et al,
1973; Fitts et al, 1984; Brooks & Faulkner, 1988). Taken together,
our results indicate that Mfn2 deficiency promotes sarcopenia and
impairs muscle function during aging.
To further confirm that the muscle alterations were a conse-
quence of a primary deficiency of Mfn2 in skeletal muscle, we
generated a new mouse model with a specific ablation of Mfn2 in
skeletal muscle (MLC1-Mfn2KO mice or SkM-KO mice). SkM-KO

 mice showed a drastic reduction in Mfn2 expression in different
muscles whereas no alterations were detected in other tissues
(Appendix Fig S3A). As it has been shown for young Mfn2KO mice
(Sebastian et al, 2012), young SkM-KO mice displayed no alter-
ations in glucose homeostasis (Appendix Fig S3B and C). However,
muscle-specific ablation of Mfn2 caused a reduced whole-body
oxygen consumption (Appendix Fig S3D). Importantly, young
SkM-KO mice also developed muscle atrophy as shown in Mfn2KO
mice (Appendix Fig S3E). In all, SkM-KO mice recapitulate the main
phenotypic features shown in Mfn2KO mice.
Muscle Mfn2 deficiency during aging causes a reduced
mitochondrial autophagy
In order to study the mechanisms by which Mfn2 deficiency devel-
ops muscle atrophy and sarcopenia, we evaluated the involvement
of relevant pathways. An increased proteasomal protein degradation
does not seem to be the cause of muscle atrophy in Mfn2KO mice,
as evidenced by the lack of differences between genotypes on the
expression of the atrogenes FbxO32 (atrogin-1), Murf1, SMART,
FbxO31, and MUSA1, in the levels of K48-linked ubiquitinated
proteins or in proteasome activity (Fig EV2A–E). Analysis of the
mTOR signaling pathway revealed a reduction in phosphorylation of
S6 during aging and in Mfn2KO mice with no changes in phosphory-
lation of 4EBP (Fig EV2F). Consistent with lower S6 phosphoryla-
tion, in vivo protein synthesis using SUnSET method was clearly
reduced in skeletal muscle from Mfn2KO (Fig EV2G).
Macroautophagy (hereafter autophagy) is a key process in the
maintenance of tissue quality by removing damaged structures or
organelles and protein aggregates. Moreover, an inhibition of auto-
phagy has been shown to be associated with muscle atrophy
(Masiero & Sandri, 2010; Carnio et al, 2014) and aging (Kroemer,
2015). Mfn2 depletion in cells in culture and heart has been shown
to block autophagy (Zhao et al, 2012; Munoz et al, 2013; Ding et al,
2015). Therefore, we analyzed autophagy in control and Mfn2KO
mice and we found that aging leads to an increase in mRNA expres-
sion of several autophagy markers, such as LC3b, Bnip3, Bnip3L but
not p62, with no changes between genotypes (Fig EV3A). However,
protein expression of LC3II, p62, and BNIP3 was increased during
aging and in Mfn2KO mice (Fig 5A–C), suggesting that autophagy
was reduced in aged animals but also in Mfn2KO young mice
compared
to
controls.
To
further
confirm
the
inhibition
of
autophagy in Mfn2KO mice, we performed autophagy flux analysis
by treating mice for 5 days with chloroquine. Indeed, autophagy
flux was inhibited in skeletal muscle from Mfn2KO mice (Fig 5D).
In order to show that this effect was cell autonomous, we also
performed autophagy flux analysis in control and Mfn2KD C2C12
muscle cells. Although no changes were detected for LC3II, auto-
phagy flux was inhibited for p62, NBR1, and BNIP3, indicating a
more
compromised
flux
of
selective
autophagy
upon
Mfn2
deficiency in muscle cells (Fig EV3B).
By using transmission electron microscopy, we detected the
accumulation of autophagosomes in Mfn2KO young mice and
control aged animals compared to control young mice, which was
again consistent with reduced autophagy (Fig 5E). In Mfn2KO old
animals, there was a much greater accumulation of autophagosomes
and mitophagosomes (Fig 5E), probably due to the reduced auto-
phagy since early life. Similar alterations were also observed in
Mfn2KD C2C12 myotubes by electron microscopy (Fig 5F). The
accumulation of mitochondria inside autophagosomes and the
increased expression of BNIP3 suggest that mitochondrial auto-
phagy could be also affected by Mfn2 deficiency. Moreover, Mfn2
has been shown to participate in mitophagy in cardiomyocytes
(Chen & Dorn, 2013; Song et al, 2015). To evaluate this possibility,
we obtained mitochondrial fractions from control and Mfn2KD
C2C12 myotubes and measured the presence of proteins involved in
mitochondrial autophagy. Mfn2KD cells showed increased levels of
BNIP3, LC3II, and Parkin in mitochondria (Fig 5G). These data,
together with the accumulation of mitophagosomes, suggest that
autophagic degradation of mitochondria is impaired in Mfn2KD
cells. Treatment of control cells with mitophagy inducer CCCP
produced a time-dependent increase in the recruitment of BNIP3,
LC3II, and Parkin into mitochondria (Fig 5G). However, in Mfn2KD
cells, this recruitment was blocked or decreased. Mitophagic flux
was also inhibited in vivo in skeletal muscle, as suggested by the
lower accumulation of LC3II, p62 and BNIP3 in mitochondrial frac-
tions after treatment with chloroquine (Fig EV3C). Furthermore,
despite increased accumulation of mitophagic proteins in mitochon-
dria, mitochondrial mass in Mfn2KD cells (Fig EV3D) and skeletal
muscle (Fig 2B) was not decreased.
In all, these data indicate that deficiency of Mfn2 impairs auto-
phagic degradation of mitochondria leading to muscle atrophy. To
confirm that inhibition of autophagy is the driver of the muscle
atrophy observed in conditions of Mfn2 deficiency, we blocked

 autophagy in mouse in vivo by injecting chloroquine for 5 days.
Administration of chloroquine in mice reduced CSA of gastrocne-
mius muscle, indicating muscle atrophy (Fig EV3E). However,
treatment of Mfn2KO mice with chloroquine did not further reduce
CSA compared to control mice (Fig EV3E). In order to stablish a
specific role of Mfn2 in reduction in autophagy and muscle atrophy,
we performed rescue studies by adenovirus-mediated overexpres-
sion
of
Mfn2
in
gastrocnemius
muscle
from
Mfn2KO
mice.
Re-expression of Mfn2 for 2 weeks led to the restoration of Mfn2
protein levels in skeletal muscle from Mfn2KO mice (Fig EV3F),
caused a decrease in the accumulation of autophagy markers and
increased CSA values (Fig EV3G and H). These results indicate that
reduction in Mfn2 is the underlying mechanism leading to inhibition
of autophagy and muscle atrophy.
Mfn2 deficiency triggers a mitochondrial retrograde signaling
pathway through the HIF1a transcription factor to induce
mitochondrial autophagy
Further GSEA analysis of transcriptomics data from Mfn2KO mice
was performed using the curated list of genesets included in the
Broad Institute Molecular Signature Database (MsigDB-C2) to find
molecular pathways coordinately altered in both Mfn2 deficiency
and in normal aging. The use of this approach revealed an enrich-
ment of genesets related with “response to hypoxia” (Fig 6A). In
keeping with this, we found that HIF1a, the main regulator of
hypoxia response, was upregulated during normal aging and in
Mfn2KO mice (Fig 6B). Moreover, we measured the expression of
HIF1a target genes, such as Pdk1, Pdk4, and Vegfa, and all of them
were upregulated in skeletal muscle of old control and young
Mfn2KO
mice
(Fig EV4A),
confirming
that
HIF1a
activity
is
increased. Similar results were obtained after Mfn2 knockdown in
C2C12 myotubes (Figs 6C and EV4B). HIF1a has been described to
be involved in the activation of mitochondrial autophagy by upregu-
lating BNIP3 (Zhang et al, 2008; Bellot et al, 2009). In order to
understand the precise role of HIF1a upon Mfn2 deficiency, we eval-
uated the impact of its increase on BNIP3 expression. To this end,
control and Mfn2KD C2C12 myotubes were incubated with the
specific HIF1a inhibitor NSC-134754 (Chau et al, 2005). As shown in
Fig 6C, the increase in HIF1a seen in Mfn2KD myotubes was mark-
edly reduced upon treatment with NSC-134754, which also led to the
reduction in BNIP3. We next evaluated whether inhibition of HIF1a
and reduction in BNIP3 could affect mitochondrial quality. Analysis
of oxidative stress revealed that treatment with HIF1a inhibitor
increased the levels of hydrogen peroxide, in both control and
Mfn2KD cells (Fig 6D). Moreover, coupled mitochondrial respiration
and leak were markedly impaired after treatment with NSC-134754
in Mfn2KD cells (Fig 6E and F). Moreover, mitochondria from Mfn2-
deficient cells showed an enhanced abundance of BNIP3, LC3 II, and
Parkin, consistent with an adaptive process aimed to mitigate mito-
chondrial autophagy disruption (Fig 6G). After treatment with HIF1a
inhibitor, Mfn2-deficient cells no longer showed an increase in mito-
chondrial BNIP3 whereas LC3II and Parkin accumulated in mito-
chondria from control and Mfn2KD myotubes. Our data are coherent
with the existence of a further inhibition of mitochondrial autophagy
upon HIF1a inhibition. In keeping with this, electron microscopy
analysis of control and Mfn2KD cells treated with NSC-134754
showed an increase in the presence of autophagosomes and altered
mitochondria, which was much more evident in Mfn2KD cells
(Fig 6H and I). These data suggest that Mfn2-induced HIF1a activa-
tion constitutes an adaptive mechanism in order to increase BNIP3
expression and removal of damaged mitochondria.
In order to assess whether the decrease in autophagy is a driver of
Mfn2 deficiency effects, we used autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A.
Treatment of C2C12 myotubes with bafilomycin A caused a substan-
tial accumulation of BNIP3, LC3II, and Parkin in mitochondrial
fractions, as an expected consequence of mitochondrial autophagy
inhibition (Fig EV4D). In addition, mitochondrial respiration was
profoundly impaired and ROS levels were highly increased, suggest-
ing the accumulation of damaged mitochondria (Fig EV4E–G). Under
these conditions, the HIF1a-BNIP3 pathway was also induced
(Fig EV4H). Altogether, our results indicate that aging and Mfn2
deficiency and the concomitant reduced mitochondrial autophagy,
trigger a mitochondrial retrograde signaling through HIF1a in order
to increase the BNIP3-dependent degradation of mitochondria and
minimize the accumulation of damaged mitochondria.
The HIF1a-BNIP3 pathway induced by Mfn2 deficiency
is ROS-dependent
Next, we analyzed the mechanisms by which aging and Mfn2 defi-
ciency lead to activation of HIF1a. We focused our attention on
oxidative stress since ROS has been shown to activate HIF1a in
several cell models (Patten et al, 2010) and we have shown an
enhanced oxidative stress in old control and Mfn2KO mice (Fig 2E).
To assess whether ROS has a role in the activation of HIF1a, we
treated Mfn2KO and control mice with the antioxidant compound
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for three weeks. NAC treatment of Mfn2KO
mice reduced H2O2 levels in skeletal muscle (Fig EV5A) and blocked
the activation of HIF1a and the increase in BNIP3 (Fig 7A), demon-
strating that the increase in the HIF1a-BNIP3 pathway is ROS-
dependent. NAC treatment also blocked the increase in ROS and
the HIF1a-BNIP3 pathway in C2C12 Mfn2KD myotubes (Fig EV5B
and C). These results suggest a beneficial role of ROS as signaling
molecules under Mfn2 deficiency conditions. If this was the case,
blocking the increase in ROS should exacerbate mitochondrial alter-
ations. In keeping with this, NAC treatment of control and Mfn2 KD
C2C12 myotubes increased mitochondrial dysfunction, as demon-
strated by a reduced coupled respiration in Mfn2 KD cells (Fig 7B),
despite increasing the presence of LC3II and Parkin in mitochondrial
fractions in both mice and cells, which is consistent with a further
inhibition of mitochondrial autophagy (Fig 7C and D). Autophagic
flux was also inhibited by NAC both in control and Mfn2KD cells,
suggesting that some ROS is necessary for the maintenance of basal
autophagy (Fig EV5D). Accordingly, electron microscopy analysis
revealed an increase in autophagosome/mitophagosome accumula-
tion and mitochondrial alterations upon treatment with NAC, which
were much more evident in Mfn2 KD cells (Fig 7E). NAC treatment
led to a reduction in muscle CSA in control mice (Fig EV5E), in
keeping with reduced autophagy. The reduction in muscle fiber size
was greater in Mfn2KO mice, highlighting the importance of the
ROS-dependent adaptive increase in BNIP3-driven mitochondrial
autophagy under Mfn2-deficient conditions (Fig EV5E). Overall,
these results indicate that aging and Mfn2 deficiency induce a retro-
grade signaling pathway through a ROS-dependent activation of
HIF1a in order to mitigate the defective mitochondrial autophagy.

 Discussion
In the present study, we have demonstrated the involvement of
the mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 in the aging process.
Mfn2 repression in muscle during aging is a determinant for the
inhibition
of
autophagy
and
accumulation
of
damaged
mitochondria, and contributes to age-associated metabolic alter-
ations and sarcopenia. In addition, Mfn2 deficiency triggers an
adaptive pathway in order to mitigate mitochondrial damage.
These conclusions are based on a number of outstanding observa-
tions, namely: (i) normal aging is characterized by a progressive
reduction in Mfn2 expression in skeletal muscle; (ii) skeletal

 muscle Mfn2 deficiency in mice generates a genetic signature
common to normal aging, indicating that both conditions show
common regulators; (iii) muscle Mfn2 deficiency is characterized
by further impairment in age-related alterations; (iv) muscle Mfn2
ablation caused impaired mitochondrial quality control, leading to
the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria; and (v) accumu-
lation of damaged mitochondria induced by Mfn2 deficiency trig-
gered a ROS-dependent increase in HIF1a and BNIP3 which
promoted mitochondrial autophagy. These alterations caused by
Mfn2 ablation occurred without affecting life span. Overall, our

Mfn2 deficiency causes sarcopenia and accelerated aging

 aging in mammals. In addition, our data are consistent with data
indicating that aging is linked to defective mitophagy in C. elegans
(Artal-Sanz & Tavernarakis, 2009; Palikaras et al, 2015).
We report that aging is characterized by a marked repression of
Mfn2 protein in mouse muscle, probably as a consequence of either
a lower rate of Mfn2 mRNA translation or a reduced protein stabil-
ity. This occurs under conditions in which other mitochondrial
dynamics proteins are also decreased but other mitochondrial
proteins such as porin or OXPHOS subunits are not altered, indicat-
ing a specific dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics during
aging. Reduction in Mfn2 found in our study is consistent with
other reports in humans or rats in which Mfn2 was found to be
downregulated during aging in skeletal muscle (Crane et al, 2010;
Zhao et al, 2014). It has also been reported that Mfn2 expression is
not altered in the white portion of gastrocnemius muscles in aged
mice (Leduc-Gaudet et al, 2015). In this context, the expression of
Mfn2 is greater in oxidative than glycolytic muscles (F.X. Soriano
and A. Zorzano, unpublished observations). Based on all these
data, we claim that most likely Mfn2 is mostly repressed in highly
oxidative muscle fibers during aging, as shown by a higher repres-
sion in soleus than in tibialis anterior muscle (Fig EV1A). In keep-
ing with a reduced Mfn2 expression in aged muscle, by means of
transcriptomics analysis, we have identified a muscle gene signa-
ture that is common in normal aging as well as in Mfn2 deficiency.
Thus, Mfn2-deficient muscle showed a pattern of deregulated genes
also noted in muscles from aged mice. These data support the view
that Mfn2 repression during aging potently influences muscle
biology.
Skeletal muscle tissue is highly affected during aging, and this
has relevant consequences on muscle mass (sarcopenia), capacity to
perform work, and on energy homeostasis (Dela & Kjaer, 2006;
Cesari et al, 2014). The mechanisms leading to age-induced muscle
alterations are not known, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been
suggested to be a possible cause (Lanza & Nair, 2010; Marzetti et al,
2013). Here, we show that normal aging in mice is characterized by
mitochondrial dysfunction, reduction in mitochondrial density, and
accumulation of altered mitochondria, as evidenced in previous
reports (Shigenaga et al, 1994; Ojaimi et al, 1999; Short et al, 2005).
Aging also caused glucose intolerance, reduced energy expenditure,
and reduced muscle fiber size. Importantly, muscle Mfn2 ablation
aggravated all these age-related disorders. Based on these observa-
tions, we suggest that age-induced decay in Mfn2 in skeletal muscle
could be a contributing factor for the mitochondrial and metabolic
alterations linked to aging. In addition, we suggest that an exagger-
ated Mfn2 repression in muscle with aging may be linked to
unhealthy aging, and it may favor the development of the frailty
syndrome.
Autophagy is reduced during aging (Salminen & Kaarniranta,
2009; Carnio et al, 2014), and its involvement in the accumulation
of tissue damage occurring with age has been suggested (Kroemer,
2015). Autophagy is also essential for the maintenance of skeletal
muscle
mass
and
function
as
well
as
whole-body
energy
homeostasis (Masiero et al, 2009; Masiero & Sandri, 2010). In keep-
ing with this, we showed that aging in control mice is associated
with a decrease in autophagy and with an increased abundance of
abnormal mitochondria. Mfn2 deficiency also reduced autophagy in
skeletal muscle and muscle cells in culture, demonstrating a cell
autonomous effect of Mfn2 repression. Analysis of autophagy flux
in muscle cells suggests that selective autophagy (which requires
the adaptor proteins p62, BNIP3, and NBR1) is more affected by
Mfn2 deficiency than general non-selective autophagy. Furthermore,
Mfn2 repression also inhibited autophagic degradation of mitochon-
dria in skeletal muscle and muscle cells in culture, leading to an
extended presence of abnormal mitochondria, which correlated with
an enhanced oxidative stress. These data indicate a role for Mfn2
downregulation as the cause underlying the decrease of mitochon-
drial autophagy occurring with age in skeletal muscle. These results
are consistent with previous studies demonstrating a role of Mfn2 in
autophagy and mitophagy (Hailey et al, 2010; Zhao et al, 2012;
Chen & Dorn, 2013; Munoz et al, 2013; Song et al, 2015) and a role
of mitochondrial dynamics in mitochondrial quality control (Twig
et al, 2008). Moreover, disruption of mitochondrial dynamics has
also been shown to be associated with muscle atrophy (Romanello
et al, 2010). Therefore, we suggest that Mfn2 repression during
aging leads to alterations in autophagy and to an inhibition of mito-
chondrial quality control, contributing to the accumulation of
damaged mitochondria and muscle atrophy. In keeping with this,
re-expression of Mfn2 in skeletal muscle from Mfn2KO mice
restored autophagy and reversed muscle atrophy.
It is likely that inhibition of autophagy actively participates in
many of the alterations detected under muscle Mfn2 deficiency
conditions. In this context, treatment of mice with autophagy inhi-
bitor chloroquine caused muscle atrophy as noted by reduced
muscle fiber size. Similarly, treatment of muscle cells with auto-
phagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 caused enhanced ROS production
and mitochondrial dysfunction. All these data are coherent with the
model that muscle Mfn2 repression driven by aging reduces
mitochondrial autophagy, which in turn leads to mitochondrial
dysfunction and other downstream events such as muscle atrophy
or alterations in nutrient handling.
Surprisingly, we have documented that both normal aging and
Mfn2 deficiency cause a mitochondrial retrograde signaling through
induction of HIF-1a in skeletal muscle. This is a cell autonomous
response also detectable in cultured muscle cells upon Mfn2 defi-
ciency. HIF1a has been shown to have a role in the activation of
mitochondrial autophagy by upregulating BNIP3 (Zhang et al, 2008;
Bellot et al, 2009). Activation of this pathway involves the induction
of BNIP3 and the potentiation of autophagic degradation of
mitochondria, thereby minimizing accumulation of damaged mito-
chondria. Blocking this pathway by a specific HIF1a inhibitor leads
to increased mitochondrial damage and metabolic collapse. More-
over, we found that the increase in HIF1a was ROS-dependent, as
treatment of mice or muscle cells with the antioxidant NAC blocked
the increase in HIF1a and BNIP3, leading to an increased abundance
of damaged mitochondria and reduced mitochondrial metabolism,
revealing the importance of the HIF1a retrograde signaling in cell
homeostasis. In addition, NAC treatment worsened muscle atrophy
in Mfn2KO mice, highlighting the importance of this adaptive
pathway in minimizing muscle damage. Blockage of mitochondrial
autophagy induced with bafilomycin A1 also led to accumulation of
damaged mitochondria, an increase in ROS production, and activa-
tion of the HIF1a-BNIP3 pathway. These data strongly suggest that
inhibition of mitochondrial quality control and accumulation of
damaged mitochondria is the driver of the activation of the HIF-1a
adaptive retrograde signaling. In keeping with this, a similar
adaptive pathway involving ROS-induced increase in NRF2 and

 BNIP3 has been recently shown to be activated by accumulation of
damaged mitochondria during aging in C. elegans (Palikaras et al,
2015), although the mechanisms by which aging leads to accumula-
tion of mitochondrial damage have not been analyzed. Here, we
propose that the decrease of Mfn2 could be the link between aging
and accumulation of damaged mitochondria. Although HIF1a
has been shown to increase during aging affecting nuclear–
mitochondrial communication (Gomes et al, 2013), here we discov-
ered a different and previously unknown retrograde signaling
pathway triggered by aging-induced Mfn2 downregulation, which is
formed by HIF1a-BNIP3 in order to minimize mitochondrial damage
and muscle atrophy during aging.
In summary, we propose a model (Fig 7F) in which Mfn2
controls the optimal biological properties of skeletal muscle through
the maintenance of mitochondrial quality control and efficient mito-
chondrial metabolism. During normal aging, skeletal muscle under-
goes Mfn2 repression, which causes a reduction in mitochondrial
autophagy and therefore a reduction in mitochondrial metabolism
resulting in an increase of damaged mitochondria, which leads to an
increase in ROS production. Ablation of Mfn2 reproduces those
alterations in young mice and aggravates them in old mice, strongly
supporting a role for muscle Mfn2 in aging. Surprisingly, the alter-
ations in mitochondrial function induce a mitochondrial retrograde
signaling through HIF-1a, enhanced BNIP3, contributing to the
maintenance of mitochondrial autophagy. We also suggest that
conditions characterized by extremely reduced muscle Mfn2 are
bound to unhealthy aging. Under these conditions, mitochondrial
autophagy undergoes a further impairment and leads to the occur-
rence of more extensive mitochondrial damage. This situation,
taken as a whole, causes metabolic alterations linked to an impair-
ment of metabolic homeostasis and low energy expenditure,
sarcopenia, and reduced muscle performance. Overall, the data
presented here strongly support the view that Mfn2 constitutes a
novel target for the treatment of age-related alterations in skeletal
muscle.
Materials and Methods
Refer to Appendix Supplementary Methods for a detailed description
of all methods used.
Animal care and generation of Mfn2KO mice
All animal work was conducted according to guidelines established
by the Parc Cientı
´fic de Barcelona and the University of Barcelona
Committees on Animal Care. For aging studies, wild-type mice were
used at 6, 12, and 22 months of age. Mef2C-Cre+/�Mfn2LoxP/LoxP
mice (Mfn2KO mice) were obtained as described (Sebastian et al,
2012) by crossing Mfn2flox/flox mice, provided by Dr. David Chan
(Mfn2tm3Dcc/Mmcd) (Chen et al, 2007) through MMRRC and a
mouse strain expressing Cre recombinase under the control of skele-
tal muscle-specific promoter from MEF2C (mef2-73k-Cre) (Heidt &
Black, 2005). MLC1-Cre+/�Mfn2LoxP/LoxP mice (SkM-KO mice) were
obtaining by crossing Mfn2flox/flox mice and a mouse strain express-
ing Cre recombinase under the control of MLC1 promoter/enhancer
(Sala et al, 2014). Non-expressing Cre littermates were used as
control mice.
Cell culture and treatments and adenoviral transduction
C2C12 myoblasts were used in this study. C2C12 myoblasts were
grown and led to differentiate into myotubes as previously described
(Canto et al, 2007). C2C12 myotubes were transduced with Ad-
miRCt (encoding for a control microRNA) and Ad-miR2 (encoding
for five different microRNAs against Mfn2) adenovirus (Sebastian
et al, 2012) for 48 h at day 4 of differentiation at multiplicity of
infection of 200 pfu/cell. All the experiments were performed 48 h
after infection. C2C12 myotubes were incubated with NSC-134754
(10 lM) or N-acetylcysteine (5 mM) for 16 h. CCCP was used at
30 lM for 0.5, 1, and 4 h and bafilomycin A at 200 nM for 3 or 16 h.
In vivo metabolic measurements
Serum samples were taken between 10 and 12 am after an overnight
fast, or at the same time in fed conditions. Blood glucose was
assayed with an Accu-Chek glucose monitor (Roche Diagnostics
Corp.). Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed. Insulin
concentration was also measured.
Evaluation of muscle force and performance
Maximal muscle strength of forelimbs was measured using a grip
strength meter (Bioseb). Muscle mechanical properties ex vivo as
described previously (Pessina et al, 2014) were quantified with the
commercially available 1200 A isolated muscle test system (Aurora
Scientific Inc., ON, Canada). Muscle performance was evaluated by
an exhaustion protocol using a treadmill.
Assessment of oxygen consumption in mouse by
indirect calorimetry
Measurements of oxygen consumption (VO2) and CO2 production
(VCO2) were performed using an indirect calorimetry system (Oxy-
max, Columbus Instruments).
Respiration measurements in permeabilized muscle fibers,
isolated mitochondria, and muscle cells
Respiration of permeabilized muscle fibers, mitochondria, and
cultured cells was measured as described in Sebastian et al (2012).
Histological sample preparation and analysis
For light microscopy, muscles were removed, embedded in OCT
solution (TissueTek), immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled
isopentane (Sigma), and stored at �80°C. About 10 lm cryosections
of gastrocnemius muscles were used. Cryosections were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin following standard protocols to check
tissue architecture and CSA. CSA was quantified in 200 fibers/
mouse using Image J software. NADH diaphorase and SDH activity
staining on cryosections was performed as described (Sala et al,
2014). Sequential COX/SDH staining was performed as described in
(Ross, 2011). A Nikon E600 equipped with the Olympus DP 72
camera microscope was used to analyze light and fluorescence
cryosection staining. Acquisition software used was Cell F from
Olympus.

 Fiber typing in muscle sections
Serial gastrocnemius cryosections were obtained and examined by
standard immunohistochemical procedures for the expression of
myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms (Serrano et al, 2001) as
described (Sala et al, 2014).
Protein extraction and Western blotting
Skeletal muscle or cultured cells protein homogenates, mitochon-
drial and nuclear fractions were used for Western blotting. For
detailed methods and antibodies used, see Appendix Supplementary
Methods.
Measurement of in vivo protein synthesis
For in vivo protein synthesis determination, SUnSET methodology
was used (Goodman et al, 2011). Briefly, mice were anesthetized
with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xyla-
zine (10 mg/kg) and then given an intraperitoneal injection of
0.04 lmol/g puromycin dissolved in 100 ll of PBS. 30 min after
injection, tissues were extracted and frozen in liquid N2 for WB
analysis.
Proteasome activity
Proteasome activity in total homogenates from gastrocnemius
muscles was measured as reported (Strucksberg et al, 2010).
Isolation of polysomal fractions from skeletal muscle
Polysomal fractions were obtained from quadriceps muscle as
described (Williamson et al, 2006) with minor modifications. About
200 mg of muscle was homogenized in 1 ml of resuspension buffer
(50 mM Hepes pH 7.4; 75 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 250 mM sucrose,
1% Triton X-100, 1.3% deoxycholate, 100 lg/ml cycloheximide,
and 25 ll ribonuclease inhibitor SUPERasin per 5 ml buffer). Homo-
genates were incubated for 5 min on ice, and then, 150 ll of
Tween–deoxycholate mix (1.34 ml Tween 20, 0.66 g deoxycholate,
18 ml sterile water) was added and incubated for 15 min on ice.
Homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 15 min. The resulting
supernatant was loaded onto a 20% (w/v) sucrose cushion (1:1
homogenate:sucrose cushion) and centrifuged at 150,000 g for 2 h.
The ribosome-containing pellet (polysomes) was collected and used
for RNA extraction.
DNA and RNA extraction and real-time PCR
Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and tissues were
immediately frozen for RNA and DNA isolation. RNA samples
from tissues or polysomal fractions were extracted and reverse-
transcribed as described (Sebastian et al, 2012).
Transcriptomic analysis
Microarray services were provided by IRB Functional Genomics
Core Facility. Annotation of Affymetrix microarray was performed
using Bioconductor R package mouse4302.db (Affymetrix Mouse
Genome 430 2.0 Array annotation data (chip mouse4302)). Dif-
ferential expression analysis was carried out using GaGa (Rossell,
2009). Pathway enrichment was assessed through geneset enrich-
ment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al, 2005). In these analy-
ses, we used the curated list of genesets included in the Broad
Institute Molecular Signature Database (MsigDB-C2) (Subramanian
et al,
2005).

dataset was deposited to the National Center for Biotechnology
Information’s Gene Expression Omnibus Database (Barrett & Edgar,
2006) and is accessible through GEO Series accession number
GSE71501.
Mitochondrial DNA copy number
Total DNA from tissues or cell cultures was extracted with the
DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Quiagen) following the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Mitochondrial DNA was quantified by real-time
PCR. Total DNA was used as a template.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by using an appropriate normality test to assess
whether the data fit a Gaussian distribution. An F-test of equality of
variances was performed to demonstrate that the variance between
groups was not different. Statistical significance was determined
using the Student’s t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with an
appropriate post hoc test. Data are presented as mean � SEM.
Significance was established at P < 0.05.
