 KEY POINTS
Question. Is mild traumatic brain injury without loss of consciousness associated with an 
increased risk of dementia diagnosis in Veterans?
Findings. In this propensity-matched cohort study of more than 350,000 Veterans with and 
without traumatic brain injuries, mild traumatic brain injury without loss of consciousness was 
associated with more than a two-fold increase in the risk of dementia diagnosis, even after 
adjusting for medical and psychiatric comorbidities. 
Meaning. Even mild traumatic brain injuries that do not result in loss of consciousness may have
long-term neurodegenerative consequences.

 ABSTRACT
Importance: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common in both Veteran and civilian populations. 
Prior studies have linked moderate and severe TBI with increased dementia risk, but the 
association between dementia and mild TBI—particularly mild TBI without loss of 
consciousness (LOC)—remains unclear.
Objective: To examine the association between TBI severity, LOC and dementia diagnosis in 
Veterans. 
Design, Setting and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of all patients diagnosed with a 
TBI in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) healthcare system from 10/1/2001 – 9/30/2014
(n=178,779) and a propensity-matched comparison group (n=178,779). Patients with dementia at
baseline were excluded. 
Exposure: TBIs were identified through the Comprehensive TBI Evaluation database, which is 
restricted to Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans, and the National Patient Care Database, which 
includes all-era Veterans. TBI severity was classified as mild without LOC; mild with LOC; mild
with LOC unknown or moderate/severe using Department of Defense or Defense and Veterans 
Brain Injury Center criteria based on the most severe injury recorded. 
Main Outcome: International Classification of Diseases 9th edition codes were used to identify 
dementia diagnoses during follow-up and medical and psychiatric comorbidities during the two 
years prior to the index date.  
Results: Veterans had a mean age of nearly 50 years at baseline; 9% were female and 72% were 
non-Hispanic white. Differences between Veterans with and without TBI were small. Almost 3% 
of Veterans without TBI developed dementia compared to more than 6% of those with TBI. After
adjustment for demographics and medical and psychiatric comobidities, adjusted hazard ratios 
4
 (95% confidence intervals) for dementia were 2.36 (2.10, 2.66) for mild TBI without LOC, 2.51 
(2.29, 2.76) for mild TBI with LOC, 3.19 (3.05, 3.33) for mild TBI with LOC unknown and 3.77 
(3.63, 3.91) for moderate/severe TBI. 
Conclusions and Relevance: In this retrospective cohort study of more than 350,000 Veterans, 
even mild TBI without LOC was associated with more than a two-fold increase in the risk of 
dementia diagnosis. Studies of strategies to determine mechanisms, prevention and treatment of 
TBI-related dementia in Veterans are urgently needed.

 INTRODUCTION
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was one of the earliest risk factors identified for 
Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.1 Although not all studies have found an association,2-7 the 
majority of studies including several meta-analyses have found that moderate and severe TBI are
associated with increased risk or earlier onset of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia,8-18 
particularly in those with genetic risk factors such as one or more apolipoprotein-E e4 alleles.19-22 
However, the association between mild TBI and dementia remains controversial,11,12 and few 
studies have specifically examined the effects of mild TBI without loss of consciousness (LOC).4
Mild TBI is extremely common in the general population and is especially high in 
military personnel. Approximately 2.8 million TBIs occurred in the U.S. in 2013,23 and the vast 
majority (~80%) of these were mild.24 A recent survey found that 17% of Iraq and Afghanistan 
troops reported experiencing a mild TBI during deployment and, of these, 59% reported more 
than one mild TBI.25 Most of these are caused by shock waves from blasts rather than blunt 
trauma and do not necessarily result in LOC.26 
There also is growing awareness that mild, repeated TBIs are closely related to chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease associated with repeated head 
trauma.27 Recent autopsy studies have identified CTE in professional athletes who participate in 
American football, boxing, soccer, wrestling, ice hockey, rugby and baseball.28-33 Severity of 
neuropathology is correlated with years of exposure to contact sports, rather than number of 
concussions, suggesting that subconcussive injuries contribute to disease progression.27,34 CTE 
also has been identified in military veterans exposed to repeated TBI.35 
The objective of this study was to examine the association between TBI and diagnosis of 
dementia in Veterans who receive care in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) healthcare 
6
 system. In particular, we sought to determine whether Veterans who experience mild TBI without
LOC are more likely to be diagnosed with dementia. 
METHODS
Study Population
We performed a retrospective cohort study that included all VHA patients who received a 
TBI diagnosis from 10/1/2001 to 9/30/2014 and a propensity-matched comparison sample. TBI 
diagnoses came from two sources: 1) the Comprehensive Traumatic Brain Injury Evaluation 
(CTBIE) database and 2) VHA inpatient and outpatient visits (National Patient Care Databases, 
NPCD). 
CTBIE is an accruing national database that began in 2007 and includes Iraq and 
Afghanistan-era Veterans who have separated from military service, enrolled in VHA healthcare, 
and received a comprehensive TBI evaluation. Veterans may be referred for a comprehensive 
TBI evaluation if they screen positive for TBI; they are informed prior to screening that they may
have sustained a moderate to severe TBI; or they report symptoms suggestive of TBI or 
concussion during a VA clinical visit. All TBI evaluations are performed by a neurologist or a 
trained allied health professional, either within VHA or through another facility reimbursed by 
VA. The CTBIE database includes detailed information on the final determination of TBI status 
as well as duration of LOC, alteration of consciousness (AOC) and post-traumatic amnesia 
(PTA). Veterans who are referred but not evaluated or who receive evaluations that are not 
captured in the CTBIE database are not included. We identified all Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans
who received a TBI diagnosis through CTBIE from October 2007 to October 2014. 
7
 In addition, we identified all other VHA patients who received an inpatient or outpatient 
TBI diagnosis as part of routine clinical care using a comprehensive list of International 
Classification of Diseases 9 (ICD-9) codes created by the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury 
Center (DVBIC) and the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) for TBI 
surveillance (2012 criteria, see below).36 
For all participants with TBI, we determined the first fiscal year in which a TBI was 
diagnosed. In addition, as a proxy measure for repeated TBIs, we determined the number of 
years in which each Veteran had at least one TBI diagnosis prior to a diagnosis of dementia or 
censoring. We hypothesized that a TBI diagnosed in a subsequent year would be more likely to 
reflect a new event rather than ongoing care for the index event. 
To identify a comparison sample of Veterans without TBI, we first selected a 2% random 
sample of all patients who received VHA care from 10/1/2001 to 9/30/2014. We then used 
propensity matching to select one Veteran without TBI for each Veteran with TBI. We performed 
propensity score matching with no replacement using nearest-neighbor caliper matching with 
caliper width of 0.2 SDs of the logit of the propensity score utilizing Stata software. Propensity 
score matching was conducted on the entire sample (CTBIE and NPCD data) matching any TBI 
and no TBI groups using all covariates. 
The ‘index date’ for those with TBI was defined as the date of the most severe TBI. If 
TBIs were comparable in severity, the index date was defined as the first TBI recorded. For 
participants without TBI, the index date was defined as the random selection date (between 
10/1/2001 and 9/30/2014). Individuals with a dementia diagnosis at the time of the index date or 
during the two previous years were excluded (see below). For all participants, starting with the 
index date, we extracted dates and diagnoses for all subsequent inpatient and outpatient visits.
8
 All study procedures were approved by institutional review boards at the University of 
California, San Francisco; San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center; and US Army 
Medical Research and Materiel Command, Office of Research Protections, Human Research 
Protection Office. Informed consent was waived because many study participants had died or 
were no longer receiving care through VHA when these analyses were performed.  
TBI Severity
A variety of criteria exist to define TBI severity,37 and a recent study identified more than 
50 different definitions of mild TBI.38 Department of Defense coding guidelines from 2010 
define mild TBI as TBI with normal structural imaging, LOC of 0 to 30 minutes, AOC of a 
moment up to 24 hours, and PTA of 0 to 1 day.39 DVBIC, AFHSB and the Centers for Disease 
Control (CDC) have collaborated to develop a standard TBI surveillance case definition using 
ICD9/10 codes.36  
For the current study, we classified the most severe TBI as none, mild or 
moderate/severe. We then separated mild TBIs into those without LOC, with LOC or with LOC 
unknown. In patients whose TBI was diagnosed through CTBIE, TBI severity was defined using 
the more stringent DOD criteria.39 In patients whose TBI was diagnosed through ICD-9 codes, 
TBI severity was defined using DVBIC 2012 Criteria (see eAppendices 1 and 2).36 Patients 
whose TBI severity could not be classified were excluded.
Dementia
Prevalent dementia at baseline was defined using a comprehensive list of ICD-9 codes 
recommended by the VA Dementia Steering Committee (2016 version, eAppendix 3). 
9
 Individuals with a dementia code at the index date or during the previous two years were 
excluded. Incident dementia during follow-up was classified using a slightly modified version of 
the VA Steering Committee ICD-9 codes in which we excluded prion disease (046.11, 046.19, 
046.3, 046.79) and alcohol/drug-induced dementia (291.2, 292.82). 
Other Measures
Demographic information, medical comorbidities and psychiatric conditions were 
obtained from the VHA inpatient and outpatient files. Demographic data were based on self-
report and included age at index date, sex and race/ethnicity (categorized as non-Hispanic white, 
non-Hispanic black, Hispanic or other/unknown). In addition, we used zip code at the index date 
and 2000 U.S. Census data to classify veterans as living in broad educational and income strata. 
Education was dichotomized as ≤ 25% versus > 25% of the adult population completing a 
college education (bachelor’s degree or higher). Income was categorized into tertiles of median 
income for adults <75 years or ≥75 years.
Medical comorbidities and psychiatric disorders were coded as ‘present’ at baseline if 
they were coded at the index date or during the previous two years using standard ICD-9 codes. 
Medical comorbidities included: diabetes mellitus, hypertension, myocardial infarction, 
cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Psychiatric conditions included: mood 
disorder (depression, dysthymia, bipolar disorder), anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, 
substance use disorder (alcohol or drug abuse), tobacco use and sleep disorder (sleep apnea, 
insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia, and circadian rhythm disorders). 
Analyses
10
 Baseline characteristics of Veterans were compared as a function of TBI using t-tests for 
continuous variables and Chi-square analysis for categorical variables. Cumulative incidence of 
dementia as a function of age and TBI severity was examined graphically. Cox proportional 
hazards models were used to examine time to dementia diagnosis with censoring at death or last 
medical encounter and age as the timescale. Models were unadjusted and adjusted in steps for 1) 
demographics; 2) demographics and medical comorbidities; and 3) demographics, medical 
comorbidities and psychiatric disorders. In addition, sensitivity analyses were performed 
stratified based on TBI data source (CTBIE versus NPCD) and comparing Veterans with TBIs 
coded in single versus multiple years. Cox proportional hazards model assumptions were 
checked for all final models. P-values were two-sided with statistical significance defined as 
p<0.05. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4. 
RESULTS
Our final cohort included 178,779 Veterans with TBI and a propensity-matched 
comparison sample of 178,779 Veterans without TBI. Most TBIs were identified through NPCD 
only (85%) while 7% were from CTBIE only and 8% were included in both datasets. Overall, 
TBI severity was 10% mild without LOC, 13% mild with LOC, 31% mild with LOC unknown 
and 46% moderate/severe. TBIs identified through CTBIE were more likely to be mild (85%) 
than those identified through NPCD (52%) (eAppendix 4). Veterans from CTBIE were younger 
(mean age 33 vs. 51 years) and had fewer medical comorbidities (diabetes: 2% vs. 4%; 
cerebrovascular disease: <1% vs. 5%) and more psychiatric comorbidities (PTSD: 20% vs. 11%).
Veterans with and without TBI were generally well-matched (Table 1). Study participants
had a mean age of 49 ± 18 years at their index date; 9% were women and the race/ethic 
11
 distribution was 72% non-Hispanic white, 16% non-Hispanic black, 2% Hispanic and 10% 
other/unknown. Four percent had a history of diabetes mellitus; 11% had hypertension; 19% had 
a mood disorder, and 11% had PTSD. Study participants were followed for a mean (SD) of 4.2 
(3.4) years until dementia, death or their most recent clinical visit (whichever occurred first). 
A total of 4,698 (2.6%) cases of incident dementia were diagnosed in Veterans without 
TBI, compared to 10,835 (6.1%) in those with TBI. After adjustment for age, medical 
comorbidities and psychiatric disorders, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval,
CI) for dementia diagnosis was 2.36 (2.10, 2.66) for mild TBI without LOC; 2.51 (2.29, 2.76) for
mild TBI with LOC; 3.19 (3.05, 3.33) for mild TBI with LOC unknown; and 3.77 (3.63, 3.91) 
for moderate/severe TBI (Table 2). Figure 1 shows that cumulative incidence of dementia based 
on age at diagnosis increased progressively with TBI severity. The mean time from index date to 
dementia diagnosis was 3.6 ± 3.0 years in those with TBI and 4.8 ± 3.7 years in those without 
TBI. Dementia diagnosis occurred an average of 1.5 years earlier in those with versus without 
TBI in NPCD and 1.8 years earlier in CTBIE, with little evidence of difference in time to 
diagnosis by TBI severity.” 
Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. When stratifying based on TBI data source, 
the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 2.20 (0.99-4.88) in CTBIE versus 
2.27 (2.02-2.55) in NPCD for mild TBI without LOC; 3.20 (1.48-6.90) in CTBIE versus 2.49 
(2.31-2.80) in NPCD for mild TBI with LOC; and 5.94 (2.73-12.93) in CTBIE versus 3.44 (3.22-
3.57) in NPCD for moderate/severe TBI. All mild TBIs with LOC unknown were from NPCD. 
Most patients with TBI had a TBI code in a single year (81%) versus multiple years (19%), and 
the adjusted risk of dementia was similar in both groups (single year HR, 3.46; 95% CI: 3.34, 
12
 3.58; multiple year HR, 3.41; 95% CI: 3.23, 3.60). Cox proportional hazards model checks did 
not reveal any major violations of model assumptions. 
 
DISCUSSION
In this cohort of more than 350,000 Veteran patients with and without TBI, we found a 
dose response relationship between TBI severity and dementia diagnosis. Even mild TBI without
LOC was associated with more than a two-fold increase in the risk of receiving a dementia 
diagnosis. This association remained strong after adjustment for demographics, medical 
comorbidities and psychiatric conditions and was consistent in sensitivity analyses. These results 
confirm prior studies including a 2008 Institute of Medicine report that have found an association
between moderate/severe TBI and risk of dementia.1,9,11,12,21,40 In addition, although prior studies 
of the association between mild TBI and dementia have been mixed,2-6 our study adds to the 
weight of evidence suggesting that mild TBI is also associated with increased dementia diagnosis
risk.13-15,37,41 
Our results differ from several recent cohort studies that found no association between 
self-reported mild TBI and dementia risk.4,5,7 These differences may be due to differences in how 
TBIs were identified. Self-reported TBIs are likely to be less specific than injuries identified 
through the medical record, which could potentially bias results toward the null. 
We are aware of only one prior study that has specifically examined the association 
between mild TBI without LOC and dementia risk.42 This study utilized a retrospective, case-
control study design in which TBI status was determined in 2,233 patients with Alzheimer’s 
disease and 14,668 first-degree family members based on informant interviews and medical 
record review. TBI with and without LOC were both associated with greater odds of dementia, 
13
 with evidence of a dose-response relationship. This design has several limitations, including the 
potential for recall bias when classifying TBI status and selection bias based on using first-
degree relatives. Our study used a more rigorous cohort design in which TBI and dementia were 
both ascertained using similar methods in the same study population. In addition, we examined 
mild TBI with and without LOC. 
There are several potential mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the 
association observed between TBI and dementia.43 First, TBI can damage brain structure as a 
direct result of the injury.43 Diffuse axonal injury is common in all severities of TBI.44,45 Autopsy 
and neuroimaging studies also have shown that a single moderate to severe TBI can cause 
marked cerebral atrophy six months post-injury that may progress for many years. It is possible 
that these TBI-related brain changes, when combined with dementia-related neuropathological 
changes, lead to increased risk and earlier onset of dementia symptoms.
Second, TBI may lead directly to neuropathological changes that cause Alzheimer’s 
disease such as deposition of tau in neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-β (Aβ) in plaques. 
Neurofibrillary tangles are one of the most consistent pathologies observed in CTE.43 Although 
amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology is less consistently observed following TBI, an autopsy study in 39 
TBI survivors found both plaques and tangles in greater density and wider distribution than age-
matched, uninjured controls.46 Furthermore, plaques tended to be diffuse in short-term TBI 
survivors and fibrillary in long-term TBI survivors, which is similar to patterns observed in 
early- versus late-stage Alzheimer’s.46
Other neuropathological changes that have been linked with both TBI and dementia 
include white matter degeneration and neuroinflammation. It also is possible that mechanisms 
may differ based on TBI severity. For example, mild TBI without LOC may increase dementia 
14
 risk primarily by accelerating atrophy, while moderate/severe TBI may have a more direct effect 
on Aβ and tau.
An alternative explanation for our results is that dementia diagnoses in these Veterans 
reflect ongoing cognitive and functional impairment associated with their original injuries. For 
example, a Veteran might suffer from cognitive impairment immediately following their TBI, 
and a clinician might code this as dementia if they are still experiencing cognitive impairment 
that is severe enough to interfere with daily function several years later. If this is occurring, it 
suggests that even mild TBI without LOC is associated with greater risk of long-term cognitive 
and functional impairment in these Veterans. 
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several important strengths. First, we performed a longitudinal study in a 
large cohort, giving us ample power to detect associations and to adjust for a wide range of 
potential confounders. In particular, our sample size was large enough to examine mild TBI 
without LOC as a distinct category. Second, we included TBIs diagnosed through either the 
comprehensive TBI evaluation (CTBIE) or VHA inpatient and outpatient records (NPCD). 
CTBIE includes TBI evaluations performed outside the VHA system, enabling us to capture a 
larger number of TBIs and to stratify results using the two data sources. Third, we selected our 
comparison sample using propensity matching to minimize the potential for confounding due to 
factors that predispose certain Veterans to experience TBIs. 
Several limitations also should be considered when interpreting these results. This was a 
retrospective study using medical record data based on clinician diagnoses, which do not 
necessarily reflect consensus definitions for TBI or dementia. This likely resulted in an under-
15
 diagnosis of dementia, particularly in the earlier stages. In addition, data on dementia subtypes 
were limited. All TBIs were diagnosed within the VHA healthcare system; therefore, results may 
not generalize to TBIs that do not result in medical care or are treated outside the VHA system. 
There also was heterogeneity in our working definition of TBI, and we were not able to quantify 
the number, types or causes of TBIs experienced. We do not know whether TBIs occurred in 
military or non-military settings, although it is likely that CTBIE included primarily deployment-
related TBIs. We also did not have information on history of TBIs. To the extent that 
misclassification occurred at random, it would tend to bias results toward the null. Additional 
research is critically needed to determine the mechanisms underlying the association observed 
between TBI and dementia—including mild TBI without LOC—so that effective treatment and 
prevention strategies can be developed.    
Conclusion
In this large, retrospective cohort study of VHA patients, we observed a dose-response 
relationship between TBI severity and dementia diagnosis. Even mild TBI without loss of 
consciousness was associated with more than a two-fold increase in the risk of dementia 
diagnosis after adjusting for demographic, medical and psychiatric comorbidities.

 FIGURE LEGENDS
Cumulative Incidence of Dementia by Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Severity.
The unadjusted cumulative incidence of dementia (age of dementia diagnosis) is shown as a function of traumatic brain 
injury (TBI) severity. After adjustment for demographics, medical conditions and psychiatric disorders, there was a dose-
response relationship between TBI severity and dementia diagnosis with hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) of 2.36 
(2.10, 2.66) for mild TBI without loss of consciousness (LOC); 2.51 (2.29, 2.76) for mild TBI with LOC; 3.19 (3.05, 3.33)
for mild TBI with LOC unknown and 3.77 (3.63, 3.91) for moderate/severe TBI.
