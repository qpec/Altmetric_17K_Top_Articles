Abstract
INTRODUCTION—We asked whether anxiety is associated with prospective risk of dementia, 
and the extent to which genetic influences mediate this association.
METHODS—Non-demented twins (n=1,082) from the Swedish Adoption Twin Study of Aging 
(SATSA) completed an assessment of anxiety symptoms in 1984 and were followed for 28 years.
RESULTS—Baseline anxiety score, independent of depressive symptoms, was significantly 
associated with incident dementia over follow-up (HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.01–1.06). There was 
48% increased risk of becoming demented for those who had experienced high anxiety at any time 
compared to those who had not. In co-twin analyses, the association between anxiety symptoms 
and dementia was greater for dizygotic (HR = 1.11; 95% CI= 1.02–1.20) compared to 
monozygotic twins (HR = 1.06; 95% CI= 0.95–1.20), indicating genetic mediation.
DISCUSSION—Anxiety symptoms were associated with increased risk of dementia. Genetic 
factors common to dementia and anxiety partially mediated this association.

 1. Background
The rapid growth of the older adult population continues to make urgent the identification of 
potentially modifiable risk and protective factors for dementia. Moreover, discovering early 
and modifiable risk factors is essential to identifying potential targets for treatment and 
prevention of dementia [1]. Psychiatric symptoms and disorders often co-occur with 
dementia and may be potentially modifiable. Anxiety disorders and symptoms are the most 
prevalent psychiatric disorders and symptoms in the elderly [2]. They are associated with 
negative health outcomes such as increased healthcare costs [3], decreased quality of life and 
increased disability [4]. Anxiety in later life is associated with worse cognitive functioning 
and frequently co-occurs with dementia [5]. Some studies have found links between anxiety 
disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (one type of anxiety disorder), anxiety symptoms, 
benzodiazepine use (a routine pharmacological treatment for anxiety), and increased risk of 
incident dementia [5–12].
Prior research examining anxiety as a risk factor for dementia, however, has produced mixed 
findings [6–10, 13, 14]. There is a considerable amount of research documenting depression 
as a risk factor for dementia [15]. It is also unclear whether anxiety, independent of 
depression, is associated with risk of dementia [10]. Mixed findings have also been observed 
with respect to the relationship between anxiety and cognitive decline [5, 16, 17].
If anxiety is a risk factor for dementia, little is known about what factors are mediating this 
association. Past research examining neuroticism (a dimension of personality most 
associated with anxiety [18]) has posited that genetic factors common to both neuroticism 
and dementia may be explaining this association [19], but this question has not been 
investigated with respect anxiety and dementia.
The purpose of this study was to examine whether symptoms of anxiety were associated 
with an increased risk of developing dementia over a follow-up period of 28 years in a 
representative sample of Swedish twins. Secondarily, we examined the association between 
symptoms of anxiety and trajectories of cognitive performance. Lastly, using co-twin 
analyses, we sought to determine if the association between anxiety and dementia in part 
reflected genetic factors in common to both phenotypes.
2. Methods
2.1 Data and Study Participants
Data from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) were examined for this 
study. SATSA contains a representative sample of Swedish twins drawn from the 
population-based Swedish Twin Registry [20]. SATSA consists of two components: 
questionnaire assessments (Qs) and in-person-testing (IPT). In 1984, participants completed 
the first questionnaire assessment (Q1), which will be referred to as the baseline for this 
study. Subsequent questionnaires were completed approximately every three years. 
Beginning in 1986, a subsample of twins aged 50 and above (n=645) participated in the first 
IPT assessment including measures of cognition. Participants completed IPTs approximately 
every three years. Follow-up for dementia continued through 2012. The sampling procedure

 and methods of the SATSA study have been previously published [20]. SATSA was 
approved by the Ethics Committee at Karolinska Institutet. All participants provided 
informed consent for participation.
There were 1,736 participants who completed the baseline questionnaire containing the 
measurement of anxiety. Of those participants, 1,541 completed the anxiety questionnaire 
(88.7% response rate). Participants were excluded if they had a dementia diagnosis before 
the baseline assessment, if they had missing data on other study variables, or if they were 
younger than 60 years old at their last follow-up assessment, resulting in a final sample of 
1,082 participants.
2.2 Assessment of anxiety
State anxiety symptom severity was measured at baseline through Q4 using the state anxiety 
subscale of the State-Trait Personality Inventory (STPI) [21]. The STPI is a 10-item scale in 
which participants are asked how they feel “right now.” Items are answered on a 5-point 
likert type scale (1=Fits me exactly to 5=Does not fit me at all) with higher scores 
representing greater state anxiety. The STPI contains a subset of items from the state anxiety 
subscale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The STAI is reliable and valid with 
older adults [22].
2.3 Assessment of depression
Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline using the Older American Resources and 
Services (OARS) depression subscale [23]. This subscale is a 5-item measure in which 
participants reported dichotomously (No = 0; Yes = 1) if they were experiencing each 
symptom. The OARS has been found to be a reliable and valid measurement for community 
dwelling older adults [24]. The OARS was administered at Q1 through Q3. The Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) was available Q2 through Q4 but not at 
baseline.
2.4 Diagnosis of dementia
Participants were screened for dementia throughout the study. Participants were identified 
for dementia work-up if they scored lower than a 24 on the Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE), declined three or more points from prior MMSE, exhibited poor performance on 
cognitive testing at an IPT, had a history of dementia documented in medical records, and/or 
a study nurse or family member offered that the participant had dementia or cognitive 
problems [25]. Additionally, participants who failed to respond to either a Q or an IPT 
assessment were contacted and asked to complete a brief telephone cognitive screening 
interview [26]. When participants were unable to respond, a proxy telephone interview was 
used.
Participants identified as possible dementia cases through any of these methods were invited 
to complete a clinical assessment including a medical examination, laboratory tests, and 
neuropsychological testing. The determination of dementia diagnosis was made by a 
consensus panel including the assessment team who were blind to twin status [25]. For these

 participants, diagnostic criteria from the then current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders [27] (DSM-III or DSM-IV) were used to diagnose dementia.
Finally, to supplement in-person clinical diagnostic assessments, all twins, including those 
who refused IPT or telephone screening, were followed until death or December 31, 2012, 
using the National Patient Registry and National Cause of Death Registry. The National 
Patient Registry contains information on hospital visits with diagnosis, admission and 
discharge dates. The Cause of Death Registry has information on the underlying and 
contributing causes of death. Diagnoses in both registries used the then current International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD) edition [28–30]. Utilization of NPR/CDR diagnoses has 
been found to be reliable with acceptable sensitivity/specificity [31]. A total of 43 (25%) of 
dementia diagnoses came from the NPR/CDR. For these participants, ICD diagnosis of 
dementia was used.
2.5 Cognitive testing
The SATSA cognitive battery [20] assessed the cognitive domains of perceptual speed 
(Symbol Digit Test, Figure Identification task), nonverbal memory (Thurstone Picture 
Memory Test), working memory (Digit Span backwards), attention (Digit Span forwards), 
and visuospatial abilities (Block Design, Figure Logic, and Card Rotations). Participants 
completed cognitive testing as many as seven times. Scores were transformed for all tests to 
percentage of points achieved out of total possible.
2.6 Covariates
Models included covariates known to be associated with risk of dementia including baseline 
age, sex, education, a physical illness sum score, neuroticism, and benzodiazepine use. The 
physical illness score consisted of the number of organ systems affected by illness from 
which the participant was suffering. This score has been used in prior SATSA investigations 
[32]. Neuroticism was measured using a shortened version of the neuroticism scale of the 
Eysenck Personality Inventory [33]. The Neuroticism scale contains nine items with higher 
scores representing more neuroticism. Education was assessed via self-report and 
dichotomized into elementary education and education beyond elementary school. Self-
reported benzodiazepine use (No=0, Yes=1) at baseline was available for a subset of the 
sample (n=556).
2.7 Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were computed for cases (participants who developed dementia over 
the follow-up period between 1984 and 2012) and controls (participants who did not develop 
dementia). The two groups were compared using independent sample t-tests for continuous 
variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.
Cox mixed-effects proportional hazards models run with the coxme package [34] in R [35] 
were used to examine the association between baseline anxiety and incident dementia. A 
random effect of twin pair was included in the model to adjust for the clustered nature of the 
data. Age was used as the time scale. First, a univariate Cox model was run to examine the 
association between STPI score and risk of dementia. To assess the confounding of physical

 health and demographic variables, a second multivariate Cox model was run including 
anxiety, sex, education, baseline age, and the physical illness sum score. To examine the 
association between depressive symptoms, neuroticism, and dementia risk a third model was 
conducted adjusting for baseline depressive symptoms and neuroticism, in addition to the 
covariates described in the second model. In order to utilize the multiple assessments of the 
STPI, additional analyses were run using a dichotomous score (low anxiety =0, high 
anxiety=1) instead of as a continuous variable. Scoring at or above one standard deviation on 
the STPI at any of the four assessments was used as the cut point. Here average depressive 
symptoms from baseline to Q3 were used as a covariate.
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the effects of baseline benzodiazepine use 
on risk of incident dementia. The proportional hazard models were re-run using the 
subgroup with benzodiazepine data, adding baseline benzodiazepine use or non-use as a 
covariate. Lastly, in order to ensure we were examining anxiety and long-term risk of 
dementia rather than anxiety as a prodromal symptom, the models were re-run to exclude 
individuals who developed dementia within five years of the baseline.
As secondary analyses of cognitive performance trajectories, mixed-effects age-based 
quadratic growth models (MIXED procedure in SAS version 9.3 [36]) were fitted to 
examine the simple relationship between baseline STPI and cognitive performance over age 
while controlling for baseline age, gender, education, physical health, neuroticism, and 
depression. Participants were clustered on twin pair to account for non-independence of 
data. Significant age squared by anxiety interactions were not found so these were removed 
from the model. Reported models contain main effect of all covariates and the linear age by 
anxiety interaction. Separate models were run using Q1 STPI followed by the dichotomous 
STPI score.
For the co-twin analysis, twin pairs discordant for dementia (one twin developed dementia 
and the other twin did not) were included in the co-twin control analysis (17 monozygotic 
(MZ) and 46 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs). Because twin pairs share factors in common, such 
as early life environment, maternal factors, their segregating genes (50% DZ and 100% MZ), 
the co-twin design minimizes confounding of these variables. Likewise, because MZ twins 
share 100% of segregating genes while DZ twins share only half, if a difference is reduced 
within MZ pairs compared to DZ pairs it is suggestive of significant genetic confounding 
[37].
Dementia cases and their co-twin controls were compared on study measures using t-tests 
and chi-square tests. Twins were classified as endorsing more or less anxiety than their co-
twin based on any intra-pair difference on the STPI. Secondarily, conditional logistic 
regression models (PHREG procedure in SAS version 9.3 [36]) including twin pairs as 
stratum were used to examine the association between anxiety and risk of dementia using 
three alternative outcomes: STPI score, dichotomous anxiety symptom severity, and 
endorsing more (or less) anxiety than their co-twin at baseline. Models were run including 
all discordant twins followed by separate analyses among MZ and DZ twins.

 3. Results
3.1. Participant Characteristics
On average, participants were 60.86 (SD = 11.15) years old at the baseline assessment. 
Descriptive characteristics are presented in table 1. In total, 172 (15.8%) participants 
developed dementia. Onset of dementia occurred an average of 14.7 (SD = 6.70) years after 
baseline.
3.2. Incident Dementia
Results from Cox proportional hazard models are presented in table 2. In the univariate tests, 
each point increase on the STPI was associated with three percent increased likelihood of 
incident dementia in the univariate model (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.03; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.01–1.05). After adjusting for baseline age, sex, education, baseline 
depressive symptoms, baseline neuroticism, and baseline physical illness, the STPI remained 
a significant predictor of incident dementia (HR = 1.04 95% CI = 1.01–1.05). In univariate 
analyses, depressive symptoms at baseline (HR = 1.01; 95% CI= 0.87–1.16, not shown in 
table 2) or averaged across the three assessments (HR= 1.08; 95% CI = 0.92–1.25, not 
shown in table 2) were not associated with incident dementia. Substituting CES-D averaged 
Q2-Q4 did not change the conclusion.
Endorsing at or above one standard deviation on the STPI at any assessment was associated 
with increased likelihood of dementia in the univariate (HR=1.44; 95% CI=1.01–2.05) and 
multivariate models (HR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.01–2.18) including average depression over 
time as a covariate. Figure 1 displays the cumulative incidence of dementia by age and for 
high and low anxiety.
Sensitivity analyses conducted with the subset of participants who had benzodiazepine data 
suggested that baseline benzodiazepine use was not associated with incident dementia (HR = 
0.95; 95% CI = 0.47–1.92). When adding baseline benzodiazepine use to the model, the size 
of the HR of the STPI was unchanged. The STPI score remained a significant predictor of 
dementia when excluding participants who developed dementia within five years of baseline 
(HR = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.01–1.07).
3.3 Cognitive Performance
Results from the mixed-effects age-based quadratic growth models suggested that baseline 
STPI was associated with greater declines in Symbol Digit (STPI X Age β = −0.005; 95% 
CI = −0.01 – −0.001), and Figure Identification (STPI X Age β = −0.01; 95% CI = −0.02 – 
−0.002) performance over age. A significant main effect of STPI was found on Thurstone 
Picture Memory (STPI β = −0.15; 95% CI = −0.30 – −0.02), and Block Design (STPI β = 
−0.17; 95% CI = −0.32 – −0.02, suggesting higher anxiety was associated with worse 
performance on these tests across all ages. Similarly, on the dichotomous STPI variable, 
compared to low anxiety, high anxiety at any time point was associated with greater declines 
in performance over age on Figure Identification (STPI X Age β = −0.18; 95% CI = −0.30 – 
−0.06), and Thurstone (STPI X Age β = −0.21; 95% CI = −0.38 – −0.04).

 3.3. Co-Twin Analysis
When examining discordant pairs only, the twin who developed dementia was more likely to 
score higher on the baseline STPI, score at or above the one standard deviation at any time 
on the STPI, and have a higher STPI score relative to their co-twin (table 3). In the 
regression analyses, STPI score (HR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.02–1.16), and reporting a higher 
score on the STPI than the co-twin (HR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.10–3.50) were associated with 
higher risk of dementia, but the dichotomous STPI variable was not (HR = 1.91; 95% CI= 
0.92–3.96).
When considered by zygosity, as shown in figure 2, the association between anxiety and risk 
of dementia was substantially larger for DZ twins when compared with MZ twins. For DZ 
twins, all three anxiety indicators were associated with significantly increased likelihood of 
dementia. However, in MZ twins the effect size of anxiety diminished by approximately one 
half and was no longer statistically significant. This pattern of findings suggests that genetic 
factors at least partially account for the observed relations between anxiety and dementia 
risk.
4. Discussion
The principal findings of this prospective study are that anxiety symptoms were associated 
with increased risk of developing dementia. This association was independent of depressive 
symptoms, neuroticism and other variables associated with dementia. Co-twin control 
analyses demonstrated an attenuation of the effect of anxiety on dementia in MZ as 
compared to DZ twins. This finding indicates that genetic and familial factors in common to 
anxiety and dementia are partially driving the association. No prior studies to our knowledge 
have examined the role of shared genetic factors. Secondary analyses supported the 
association between anxiety and decline in cognitive performance, predominately perceptual 
speed and nonverbal memory.
There are several possible explanations as to why more symptoms of anxiety are associated 
with greater risk of developing dementia. One possible mechanism is chronic stress that is 
associated with anxiety, which results in hyperactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) axis, which may damage the hippocampus and frontal cortex [38]. Other 
possible mechanisms include disruptions to the GABAergic system and thyroid 
abnormalities. GABAergic abnormalities are implicated in both anxiety and in AD [39]. 
Likewise, thyrotoxicosis is associated with increased anxiety as well as decrements in 
cognition [40]. Thyrotoxicosis typically occurs in early life and develops into 
hypothyroidism in later life. These GABAergic and thyroid abnormalities may first manifest 
as anxiety symptoms followed by severe cognitive deficits later in life.
Further, because the association between anxiety and dementia was partially driven by 
genetic factors in common to anxiety and dementia, the mechanism may reflect genes that 
have been implicated in both anxiety and dementia. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
(BDNF) is a protein implicated in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. The Val66Met 
polymorphism of BDNF gene is associated with decreased secretion of BDNF and has been 
implicated as a possible risk allele for anxiety [41] and worse cognitive functioning [42].

 The Apolipoprotein E ε4 variant is the largest known genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease 
and also has been implicated with anxiety [43] and stress [44]. Likewise genes associated 
with serotonin reuptake and the dopaminergic systems have been implicated with anxiety 
and cognitive performance [45–47]. The complex association between these candidate genes 
and the phenotypes of interest in this study (e.g. anxiety, dementia, and cognitive 
functioning) need to be explored further in order to elucidate the biological mechanisms 
contributing to this association.
Although this study has several strengths (e.g., large sample size of closely followed 
participants, ability to look at genetic underpinnings, and the long follow-up period) it is 
important to discuss some limitations. First, it is plausible that the temporal precedence of 
this association is reversed, with individuals’ awareness of their cognitive decline causing 
increased anxiety regarding declining abilities. Although this explanation cannot be 
completely ruled out, anxiety did remain a risk factor when participants who developed 
dementia within five years of the baseline assessment were excluded. Further, the average 
onset was 14 years following the baseline, suggesting that it is unlikely that participants 
would have been experiencing significant cognitive decline at the initial assessment. Second, 
while the self-reported measure of physical illness has been used in previous research and is 
commonly utilized in large epidemiological studies, more objective indicators of physical 
health would have been preferred.
Third, in our analyses, depressive symptoms were not significantly associated with dementia 
risk. This finding is inconsistent with the majority of research that concludes that depression 
is a risk factor for dementia [48, 49]. It is possible the OARS, which is both brief and non-
comprehensive, may not have been sensitive enough to detect a significant effect of 
depression on risk of dementia. However, results were unchanged using CES-D. At the same 
time, one limitation of prior research is that anxiety symptoms were rarely assessed and/or 
controlled for. Therefore, in the studies that do not control for anxiety, the finding that 
depression is a risk factor for lower cognitive performance may really be picking up on 
anxiety [7]. Given the high comorbidity and similarity in presentation between anxiety and 
depression [50], disentangling the differences between the two can be challenging. An issue 
here is that the overlapping symptoms of depression and anxiety are potentially confounding 
when including them in the same statistical model. However, the OARS and the STPI have 
no overlapping content suggesting that confounding by including these in the same model 
was minimal.
Fourth, although the co-twin control analyses were consistent with genetic confounding, the 
sample size for the MZ discordant cases was about one-third that of the DZ twin pairs. Fifth, 
although we were able to rule out baseline benzodiazepines as an explanation for the 
findings, we do not know which participants may have received benzodiazepines after 
baseline or other treatments for anxiety that may have influenced cognitive performance. 
Finally, a complete psychiatric history for the participant and participant’s family was not 
available; therefore, we were unable to examine the association between history of anxiety 
disorders and risk of dementia.

 The finding that anxiety is associated with increased risk of dementia has important clinical 
implications. When conducting cognitive assessments with older adults reporting subjective 
and objective cognitive complaints, it is important to assess for anxiety. Healthcare providers 
often misdiagnose late life anxiety; this study demonstrates that these symptoms may be a 
particularly important risk factor of future dementia. Moreover, our results suggest that even 
subclinical anxiety is a risk factor for dementia, suggesting that clinicians should pay 
attention to any anxiety (not just diagnosable anxiety disorders) in older adults. Anxiety is a 
potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia. Research needs to examine the effect of 
successfully preventing or treating anxiety and if such interventions decrease the risk of 
developing dementia. Lastly, our findings that genetic factors in common to both anxiety and 
dementia partially explain this association may be relevant to designing interventions to 
reduce anxiety and to understanding the pathophysiology of dementia.
