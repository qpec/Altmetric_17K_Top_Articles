Abstract
Neuromodulatory systems exert profound influences on brain function. Understanding how these 
systems modify the operating mode of target circuits requires measuring spatiotemporally precise 
neuromodulator release. We developed dLight1, an intensity-based genetically encoded dopamine 
indicator, to enable optical recording of dopamine dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution in 
behaving mice. We demonstrated the utility of dLight1 by imaging dopamine dynamics 
simultaneously with pharmacological manipulation, electrophysiological or optogenetic

 stimulation, and calcium imaging of local neuronal activity. dLight1 enabled chronic tracking of 
learning-induced changes in millisecond dopamine transients in striatum. Further, we used dLight1 
to image spatially distinct, functionally heterogeneous dopamine transients relevant to learning 
and motor control in cortex. We also validated our sensor design platform for developing 
norepinephrine, serotonin, melatonin, and opioid neuropeptide indicators.
Animal behavior is influenced by the release of neuromodulators, such as dopamine (DA), 
which signal behavioral variables that are relevant to the functioning of circuits brainwide. 
Projections from dopaminergic nuclei to the striatum and cortex, for example, play 
important roles in reinforcement learning, decision-making and motor control. Loss of DA 
or dysfunction of its target circuits has been linked to disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, 
schizophrenia, and addiction (1–3).
Much work has been devoted to determining how neural representations of behavioral states 
are encoded in the firing patterns of neuromodulatory neurons (4–9), but very little is known 
about how the precise release of neuromodulators alters the function of their target circuits 
(10, 11). To address this problem, one essential step is to monitor the spatiotemporal 
dynamics of neuromodulatory signals in target circuits, while also measuring and 
manipulating the elements of the circuit during behavior.
Analytical techniques such as microdialysis and electrochemical micro-sensors, have 
provided useful insights about neuromodulator presence (12, 13), but suffer from poor 
spatial and/or temporal resolution, and cannot be targeted to cells of interest. Optical 
approaches, such as injected cell-based systems (CNiFERs) (14) and reporter gene-based 
iTango (15) can reveal dopamine release with high molecular specificity. However, these 
systems are limited by poor temporal resolution (seconds to hours), preventing direct 
detection of DA release events that occur on a sub-second time scale (16, 17).
High-quality single fluorescence protein (FP)-based sensors that report calcium or glutamate 
transients with subsecond temporal resolution have recently been developed and are widely 
used (18, 19). Here we report the development of a set of single-FP-based dopamine sensors, 
named dLight1, that enables imaging of DA transients with high spatiotemporal resolution 
in behaving animals.
Sensor engineering
Sensitive optical readout of changes in DA concentration was achieved by directly coupling 
the DA-binding-induced conformational changes in human DA receptors to changes in the 
fluorescence intensity of circularly permuted (cp) GFP. We did this by replacing the third 
intracellular loop (IL3) of the human Dopamine D1 (DRD1), D2 (DRD2) and D4 receptors 
(DRD4) with a cpGFP module from GCaMP6 (Fig. 1A).
To determine the insertion site of cpGFP in IL3 that produces maximal coupling of ligand-
induced conformational changes to cpGFP fluorescence, we aligned the sequences of DRD1 
and DRD4 with that of β2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR) (Fig. 1B), for which both active and 
inactive structure are available (20). The initial variant, obtained by inserting a cpGFP

 module (LSSLE-cpGFP-LPDQL) between K232 and K269 of DRD1, was well-expressed at 
the plasma membrane of human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and showed a 
fluorescence decrease (ΔF/Fmax= - 19.4 ± 0.02 %) in response to puffed DA (fig. S1A). To 
obtain a positive-response sensor, we screened a library of 585 variants in HEK cells (Fig. 
1C and fig. S1B). The variant with the largest positive fluorescence response (max ΔF/Fmax= 
230 ± 9 %) and excellent membrane localization was named dLight1.1 (Fig. 1D). In situ DA 
titration on HEK cells revealed sub-micromolar apparent affinity of dLight1.1 (330 ± 30 nM, 
Fig 1E).
We next sought to further tune the dynamic range and affinity of the sensor. Mutation of 
Phe129, a highly conserved residue among many GPCRs (21), into alanine (dLight1.2) 
slightly increased dynamic range (max ΔF/Fmax= 340 ± 20%, apparent affinity: 770 ± 10 
nM, Fig. 1D and E). Optimizing the cpGFP insertion site in dLight1.1 and dLight1.2 (fig. 
S1C to G) greatly increased the dynamic range, but also reduced the affinity to micromolar 
range (dLight1.3a: ΔF/Fmax= 660 ± 30 %, apparent affinity: 2300 ± 20 nM, fig S2A and B; 
dLight1.3b: ΔF/Fmax= 930 ± 30 %, apparent affinity: 1680± 10 nM, Fig. 1D and E). 
Insertion of the cpGFP module into DRD4 and DRD2 respectively produced dLight1.4 and 
dLight1.5 respectively, which exhibited nanomolar affinity with a relatively small dynamic 
range (dLight 1.4: ΔF/Fmax= 170 ± 10 %, apparent affinity: 4.1 ± 0.2 nM, Fig. 1B, D and E; 
dLight1.5: ΔF/Fmax to DA= 180 ± 10 %, apparent affinity to DA: 110 ± 10 nM, and ΔF/Fmax 
to Quinpirole= 124 ± 19%, fig S2A to C). In addition, we engineered a control sensor by 
incorporating a D103A mutation in dLight1.1 to abolish DA binding (ΔF/F= 0.4 ± 4 %, Fig. 
1E) (22). Because dLight1.1 and dLight1.2 produced large responses at low DA 
concentration (e.g.100 nM) without approaching response saturation (Fig. 1E inset) and had 
submicromolar affinity, we further characterized these two sensors.
Sensor characterization
These two sensors showed peak emissions at 516 nm and 920 nm for one- and two-photon 
illumination in HEK cells, respectively (fig. S3). In situ titration on dissociated hippocampal 
neurons showed similar apparent affinities to DA as on HEK293 cells (fig. S4A to C, Fig 
1E). Single pulses (5ms) of uncaged dopamine were robustly detected on the dendrites of 
cultured neurons, and the fluorescence response tracked uncaging pulse duration (fig. S4D to 
F). In cultured hippocampal slices, dLight1 could reliably detect sub-micromolar DA 
concentration changes at dendrites and single dendritic spines (fig. S4G to I).
We then investigated the endogenous and pharmacological molecular specificity of the 
sensor. dLight1 was ~70 and ~40 times less sensitive to norepinephrine and epinephrine than 
to DA; negligible responses were observed to all other neuromodulators tested (fig. S5). The 
amplitude of the response to each pharmacological compound reflected the efficacy of drugs 
on the wild-type receptors, with the largest response to the full-agonist, dihydrexidine 
(ΔF/F= 300 ± 10%), followed by partial agonists (Fig. 1F). The response to DA was 
abolished in the presence of the DRD1 antagonists SKF-83566 and SCH-233990, but was 
unaffected by the DRD2 antagonists haloperidol and sulpiride (Fig. 1F).

 To investigate the possible interference of sensor expression with G-protein signaling, we 
first measured the effect of sensor expression on the ligand-induced cyclic AMP (cAMP) 
response (fig. S6)(23). Transiently transfected dLight1.1 and dLight1.2 triggered no 
significant cAMP response in HEK cells, similar to the negative control (EGFP); whereas 
wild-type DRD1 did (**p<0.01; ***p<0.001, fig. S6A). The conversion of DRD1 to a 
fluorescent sensor thus apparently blocked the scaffold’s ability to bind G-protein and 
trigger the signaling cascade. When introduced into a cell line that endogenously expressed 
DRD1 (U2OS), dLight1 did not significantly alter the dose-response curve to DA (p=0.96, 
fig. S6B). dLight1 was also defective in agonist-induced internalization, a readout of DRD1 
engagement of β-arrestin (24), when compared to wild type DRD1(**p<0.01, fig. S6C). 
Total internal reflectance fluorescence (TIRF) imaging verified that dLight1 remained 
diffusely distributed in the plasma membrane, without any detectable internalization, during 
a complete cycle of ligand-dependent fluorescence change (fig. S6 D–F). Taken together, 
these results indicate that the dLight sensors are suitable for use on the cell membrane 
without affecting endogenous signaling through G-proteins or engagement of β-arrestins.
Versatile application to other neuromodulators
We next applied the design strategy of dLight1 to modularly develop a class of intensity-
based sensors for various neuromodulators and neuropeptides. We selected a subset of 
GPCRs, including Gs-coupled β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors (B1AR and B2AR); Gi-
coupled k and μ-type opioid receptors (KOR, MOR), and α2 adrenergic receptor (A2AR); 
and Gq-coupled 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor-2A (5HT2A) and melatonin 
type-2 receptor (MT2). As with dLight1, we replaced IL3 with cpGFP, with insertion sites 
chosen to preserve the conserved positive charges (fig. S7A). All sensors localized to the 
membrane and showed positive fluorescence responses to their respective agonists (fig. 
S7B).
Two-photon imaging of dopamine release in dorsal striatum ex vivo and in 
vivo
We next used dLight1 to measure the time course and concentration of endogenous 
dopamine release triggered by electrical stimulation and drug modification in acute striatal 
slices with 2P imaging (Fig. 2A). Two to four weeks after injection of an adeno-associated 
virus encoding dLight1 (AAV9.hSynapsin1.dLight1.2) into the dorsal striatum, we observed 
both broadly distributed and localized fluorescence transients across the field of view (Fig. 
2B and C, fig. S8A to C) in response to a single electrical stimulus. Fast line scan at these 
hotspots (Fig 2C) revealed a rapid onset of fluorescence increase (rise τ 1/2= 9.5 ± 1.1 ms) 
followed by a plateaued peak (averaged ΔF/F= 220 ± 50%) for about 150 ms, which decayed 
to baseline in about 400 ms (decay τ 1/2 = 90 ± 11ms, Fig. 2D). We observed robust and 
reproducible fluorescent transients to low-frequency stimuli over a prolonged imaging 
period, whereas subsequent higher frequency stimuli elicited much smaller responses 
(p<0.0001, Fig. 2E and F), indicating strong depression from an initially high probability of 
release. Blockade of dopamine reuptake with cocaine significantly prolonged the decay of 
fluorescence from peak to baseline (p<0.05, Fig. 2G and H), but with equivocal effect on

 response amplitude (P=0.056, Fig. 2G and H). Application of the competitive antagonist 
SKF83566 eliminated the responses (fig. S8F), confirming that fluorescent signals are 
indeed due to DA binding.
We next used dLight1 to estimate released DA concentration induced by a brief electrical 
stimulus. By comparison with a concentration-response curve (fig. S8D, E and G), the 
fluorescence response suggested a 10–30 μM DA release (Fig. 2I), which is 1–2 orders of 
magnitude higher than previously reported in ventral striatum using fast-scan cyclic 
voltammetry (FSCV) (25) and is similar to that reported by measuring DRD2 activation 
(26). Addition of saturating amphetamine (10 μM, in the presence of 400 μM sulpiride) 
increased tonic dopamine to 3.3 μM (fig. S8F and G).
We then examined the action of known modulators of dopamine release using dLight1 (Fig. 
2J to L). Activation of D2-autoreceptors with quinpirole decreased the electrically evoked 
fluorescence transients, which was reversed by the application of sulpiride (p<0.01, Fig. 2J). 
Perfusion with a k-opioid receptor agonist (U69,593) caused a small decrease in the 
amplitude (P<0.05, Fig. 2J), which was completely blocked by naloxone (Fig. 2J). We then 
imaged the effects of nicotinic receptors activation in mediating the probability of dopamine 
release. Blockade of nicotinic receptors with hexamethonium profoundly reduced the 
fluorescence transient, which depended on the number of stimuli (*P<0.05, ***P<0.001, 
Fig. 2K, L). In the absence of hexamethonium, the amplitude of the fluorescence remained 
consistent regardless of the stimulation protocol (P=0.06, Fig. 2K, L) (27).
Next we asked whether dLight1 could reliably report dopamine signals associated with 
mouse locomotion in dorsal striatum, which was labeled with 
AAV1.hSynapsin1.dLight1.1/1.2 and AAV1.hSynapsin1.flex.tdTomato. We measured 
dopamine transients with 2P imaging during rest and self-initiated locomotion (fig. S9). 
Consistent with in-vivo 2P calcium imaging of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) axon 
terminals in dorsal striatum (10), dLight1 reliably showed widespread and synchronous sub-
second transients associated with spontaneous locomotion, which was clearly 
distinguishable from motion artifacts (fig. S9A to E). The dopamine transients were rapidly 
and bi-directionally modulated with respect to locomotion. Accelerations were associated 
with an increase and decelerations with a decrease (peak mean cross-correlation 240 ms, 
P<0.001, fig. S9F to L).
In summary, dLight1 faithfully and directly reports the time course and concentration of 
local dopamine release and drug-dependent modulatory effects on dopamine release in acute 
striatum slice. In addition, dLight1 enables direct visualization of locomotion-triggered 
dopamine release in behaving mice.
Deep-brain recording of DA dynamics simultaneously with optogenetics or 
calcium imaging
The nucleus accumbens (NAc) receives projections from dopaminergic neurons in the 
ventral tegmental area (VTA). To directly probe DA release in freely moving mice, we 
delivered AAV9.CAG.dLight1.1 or AAV9.CAG.control_sensor in the NAc, followed by

 fiber photometry imaging (Fig. 3, fig. S10A and B). dLight1 revealed visible spontaneous 
dopamine transients, which were absent in the imaging sessions using the control sensor 
(fig. S10C).
To optically activate VTA DAergic neurons, we infected VTA of TH::IRES-Cre mice with 
AAV5.hSynapsin1.flex.ChrimsonR.tdTomato (28) (Fig. 3A to C, fig. S11A and B, fig. S12A 
and D). The high temporal resolution of dLight1 enabled detection of individual peaks of 
dopamine transients in response to 5, 10 and 20 Hz photostimulation (Fig. 3D, fig. S13A to 
C). The amplitude of fluorescence increase was correlated with the frequency of 
photostimulation (Fig. 3D and F). In contrast, no fluorescence changes were observed with 
the control sensor using 20Hz stimuli (Fig. 3D and E). Compared to saline-injected controls, 
systemic administration of SCH-23390 significantly reduced optogenetically-induced 
dLight1 responses, whereas the reuptake inhibitor GBR-12909 enhanced them (Fig. 3G to 
H).
Next, we examined whether dLight1 can report inhibition of DA transients. To induce 
transient inhibition of VTA DAergic neurons, we optogenetically stimulated VTA 
GABAergic neurons in VGAT::IRES-Cre mice (29) (Fig. 3I). Histology confirmed 
ChrimsonR expression in VTA GABAergic neurons (fig. S12B, C and E). We observed 
rapid and reversible reductions in dLight1 fluorescence in response to VTA GABAergic 
neuron photoactivation at 40 Hz (Fig. 3J and K, fig. S13D), indicating that dLight1 can 
report bidirectional changes in local DA release.
Motivationally salient stimuli modify dopamine neuron firing and downstream NAc activity 
(9, 29, 30). To link the DA release to local neuronal activity, we performed dual-color 
measurements with dLight1 and the red-shifted calcium indicator jRGECO1a (31) in lateral 
core/shell regions (Fig. 3L, fig. S10B, S11A and S12F). When mice voluntarily consumed 
reward (50 μL of 5% sucrose), we observed a concordant increase of DA concentration and 
local population activity (Fig. 3M, N, and S13E), similar to a class of NAc single units 
showing excitation upon reward (32). In contrast, footshocks suppressed DA release while 
enhancing local neuronal activity, indicating dissociation between DA dynamics and local 
circuit activity (Fig. 3O, P and S13F).
Chronic imaging of dopamine dynamics throughout cue-reward learning
We next examined the utility of dLight1 in reporting modulation of DA signaling in response 
to conditioned (CS) and unconditioned (US) stimuli throughout Pavlovian conditioning (Fig. 
4A)(8, 33, 34). Mice successfully learned to associate the predictive cues to the reward as 
shown by increasing numbers of licks during CS over the course of training, and decreasing 
licks during extinction learning (Fig. 4B).
Repeated fiber photometry recordings in the NAc revealed two types of DA transients 
modulated during associative learning: increased DA response to the predictive cues and 
decreased response to reward consumption across sessions. In the first session, a small and 
time-locked phasic DA signal was present at the CS onset, while after US the DA signal was 
larger and also more temporally spread (Fig. 4C and D), consistent with US consumption

 onsets being highly variable at early stages (Fig. S14A and B). Aligning to consumption 
onset revealed large DA signal to the US at the first session (Fig. 4C and S14A). Upon 
repeated cue-reward pairings, the amplitude of CS response significantly increased (Fig 4C, 
D, F, H and S14C). On the other hand, US response, when aligned to the consumption onset, 
showed linear decrease across learning sessions. (Fig. 4G and H). This suggests that DA 
response gradually shifted from US to CS as animals acquired cue-reward association (Fig. 
4H, and S14D) (9, 33). During extinction, we observed an attenuated phasic CS response 
(Fig. 4E, F and H). The amplitude of the phasic CS response was correlated with CS-
triggered licking behavior during both learning and extinction sessions (Fig. S14E), 
suggesting that the CS response predicted the animal’s vigor to obtain reward.
We further investigated whether dLight1 can report signals correlated with “reward 
prediction error” (RPE)(4). After the animals had fully learned CS-US association, mice 
underwent “unexpected reward availability” sessions (in which the US was occasionally 
made available without the CS) in between normal paired trials (Fig. 4I). Unexpected reward 
consumption elicited significantly higher fluorescence compared to expected consumption 
(Fig. 4J and K). In the “unexpected reward omission” session, where the US was 
occasionally omitted after the predictive CS, fluorescence decreased below the pre-CS 
baseline after the time at which the US would have normally become available CS 
presentation (Fig. 4L and M).
Cellular-level imaging of functionally-heterogeneous dopamine transients 
in mouse cortex
Finally, we tested whether 2P imaging with dLight1 can reveal the spatiotemporal release of 
DA associated with reward in the cortex. The cortex receives projection axons from both 
SNc and VTA. Inputs from these nuclei carry distinct dopaminergic signals, influencing 
motor control and reward learning, respectively (10, 35). To demonstrate the utility of 
dLight1 in detecting behavior-related DA signals, we broadly labeled frontal/motor cortex 
with AAV9.hSynapsin1.dLight1.2, followed by 2P imaging of dLight1-expressing layer 2/3 
neurons in head-fixed mice. The animals had fully learned a visuomotor association task that 
required them to run in response to a visual “Go” cue in order to receive a water reward (Fig. 
5A and B). We observed task-related DA transients, distinguishable from motion artifacts 
(fig. S15), across cell-sized regions of interest (ROIs) across the field of view (Fig. 5C, fig. 
S16).
Aligning the DA transients to trial/stand still phase onset, we found two types of task 
relevant DA responses during the reward expectation and reward delivery intervals. An 
average of 63% of responsive ROIs showed significantly increased DA transients that 
correlated with reward, which were abolished by unexpected reward omission (20% of 
randomly selected trials) (Fig. 5D right panel). A subset of ROIs (~37%) showed 
significantly increased DA transients that lasted during the short phase of “Go” stimulus 
presentation for both rewarded and non-rewarded trials (Fig. 5D, left panel). These transient 
increases during the stimulus presentation phase were not caused by the stimulus appearance

 itself, because no significant increase in DA levels was observed during miss trials during 
which the animal saw the stimulus, but did not respond (Fig. 5D; yellow traces).
To investigate whether these early responses shown in 37% of ROIs reflect increased DA 
levels during reward expectation or correlate with locomotion, we aligned the trials at 
running onset (Fig. 5E, group averages; fig. S16G, single ROIs) and compared the DA 
transients of runs triggered by the “Go” stimulus (when the animals expected a reward) with 
spontaneous runs that erroneously occurred during the stand-still phase (with no reward 
expectation).
A small subset of responsive ROIs (5%) showed significant increases in DA transients 
during reward expectation but not spontaneous running (Fig. 5E, middle panel), whereas the 
other 32% of ROIs correlated with locomotion (Fig. 5E, left panel). The 63% of ROIs 
responsive to reward only (Fig. 5D, right panel) also showed increased DA transients during 
the early stimulus presentation phase consisting of both locomotion or reward expectation 
related responses (Fig. 5E, right panel). All three types of responses were consistently seen 
across animals. Comparing the heterogeneity of response transients between layer 1 and 
layers 2/3 of cortical area M1 (fig. S16E and F) we found that layer 2/3 showed more ROIs 
active during reward. A similar number of ROIs responded to locomotion and reward 
expectation in both layers (fig. S16H). Mesocortical dopaminergic projections are thus 
spatially intermingled and activation of these inputs leads to spatiotemporally heterogeneous 
DA signals in the cortex whose dynamics depends on motor behavior, reward expectation, 
and consumption.
Conclusion
We developed and applied a new class of genetically encoded indicators that overcome 
major barriers of current methods to permit high-resolution imaging of dopamine dynamics 
in acute brain slices and in behaving mice. The sub-micromolar affinity and fast kinetics of 
dLight1 offer fast temporal resolution (10 ms on and 100 ms off) to detect the 
physiologically or behaviorally relevant DA transients with higher molecular specificity 
compared to existing electrochemical or cell-based probes (14). For example, in the NAc of 
freely behaving mice, longitudinal measurements revealed different changes in time-
resolved dopamine signals encoding either predictive cue or reward consumption across 
learning.
The disparate contributions of synaptic, extra-synaptic, and spillover dopamine events to 
circuit function are not addressable without fast, robust and genetically encoded sensors. In 
dorsal striatal slice, dLight1 reliably detected the concentration and time-course of dopamine 
transients and their modifications by pharmacological compounds. The rapid rise of 
fluorescence (10ms) and the peak concentration (10–30 μM) of dopamine following 
electrical stimulation indicates that the initial measures of dopamine are closely associated 
with the site of release (26). The decline of fluorescence, particularly in the presence of 
cocaine, results primarily from reuptake and diffusion of dopamine away from release sites.

 dLight1 also permits high spatial resolution measurement of functionally-heterogeneous 
dopamine transients at the cellular level. In the cortex, 2P imaging with dLight1 revealed a 
dopamine transient map with spatially distributed, functionally heterogeneous dopamine 
signals during a visuomotor learning task. Simultaneous calcium imaging can further 
determine how spatiotemporal differences in DA levels relate to ongoing neural activity and 
influence associative learning or goal-directed behavior. dLight1.1 and dLight1.2 represent 
optimized sensor variants to be immediately applied to ex vivo or in vivo studies, as they 
offer a good balance between dynamic range and affinity. Other dLight variants may be 
suitable for measuring synaptic release (dLight 1.3) or tonic DA transients (dLight 1.4). 
Given the broadly tunable affinity and dynamic range of dLight1, protein engineering and 
high-throughput screening efforts can further optimize SNR and molecular specificity (36), 
as well as performance of other neuromodulator indicators.
In combination with calcium imaging and optogenetics, our sensors are well poised to 
permit direct functional analysis of how the spatiotemporal coding of neuromodulatory 
signaling mediates the plasticity and function of target circuits.

 Fig. 5. Spatially resolved imaging of cortical dopamine release during a visuomotor association 
task
(A) Schematics of experimental setup. (B) To initiate a trial, mice were required to stand still 
for 10s following a visual cue (blue square). If mice started to run during the stimulus phase 
(“Hit trials”), a water reward was given. In 20% of randomly selected “Hit trials” the reward 
was withheld. If no run was triggered by stimulus presentation, the trials were counted as 
“Miss trials”. Erroneous/spontaneous runs during the stand-still phase ended the trial (no 
“Go” cue or reward). (C) Top, dorsal view of mouse cortex with the chronic cranial window 
(circle) and imaging location indicated (square). Bottom, heatmap of dLight1.2 expression 
pattern in layer 2/3 of M1 cortex. The image is overlaid with computationally defined 
regions of interest (ROIs, ~17×17μm). Colored ROIs indicate the type of fluorescence 
responses observed during the task. (D) Population data (N = 4 mice, n = 19 recording 
sessions) showing average task-related dLight1.2 transients (bottom) and mouse running 
velocity (top) aligned to trial/stand-still cue onset (0s). The solid vertical line indicates “Go” 
cue onset. The dotted line marks the end of the reward expectation phase during unrewarded 
Hit and Miss trials. The period during which running velocity-dependent reward 
consumption occurred is indicated by the horizontal line. Left, ROIs showing significantly

into ROIs responsive to locomotion in all trials (left), and responsive to reward expectation 
only (center) with no fluorescence increases during spontaneous runs (pink). p<0.05,
