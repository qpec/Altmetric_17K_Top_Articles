ABSTRACT  
1 
Background: Medication administration errors may contribute to patient mortality, thus 
2 
additional understanding of such incidents is required.  
3 
Objectives: To analyse medication administration errors reported in acute care as resulting 
4 
in death, to identify the drugs concerned, and to describe medication administration error 
5 
characteristics (location of error, error type, patient’s age) by drug group.  
6 
Methods: Medication administration errors reported in acute care in 2007 ̶ 2016 
7 
(n=517,384) were obtained from the National Reporting and Learning System for England 
8 
and Wales. Incidents reported as resulting in death (n=229) were analysed. Drugs were 
9 
classified by two researchers using the British National Formulary. Drug categories were 
10 
described by medication administration errors’ year, location, patient age, and error 
11 
category based on the incidents’ original classification.  
12 
Results: Errors were most often reported on wards (66.4%, n=152), and in patients aged 
13 
over 75 years (41.5%, n=95). The most common error category was omitted medicine or 
14 
ingredient (31.4%, n=72); most common drug groups were cardiovascular (20.1%, n=46) and 
15 
nervous system (10.0%, n=23). Most errors in patients under 12 years concerned drugs to 
16 
treat infection; cardiovascular drugs were most common among other age groups.  
17 
Conclusions: In order to prevent these most serious of medication administration errors, 
18 
interventions should focus on avoiding dose omissions, and administration of drugs for 
19 
patient over 75 years old, as well as safe administration of parenteral anticoagulants and 
20 
antibacterial drugs.

INTRODUCTION 
32 
In 2017, The World Health Organization (WHO) launched a third global patient safety 
33 
challenge “Medication Without Harm”, aimed at improving medication safety, on the basis 
34 
that medication errors are a leading cause of injury and avoidable harm in health care 
35 
systems globally generating costs that has been estimated at 42 billion USD annually.¹ In 
36 
February 2018, the report of the prevalence and burden of medication errors in England 
37 
was published in response to the WHO challenge, estimating that 237 million medication 
38 
errors at all stage of medication process occur in England per annum.² 
39 
The United States National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and 
40 
Prevention³ defines medication error as “any preventable event that may cause or lead to 
41 
inappropriate medication use or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the 
42 
health care professional, patient, or consumer”. The medication administration stage of the 
43 
medication process is known to be prone to errors. Half or more of all medication incidents 
44 
are medication administration errors (MAEs).² ⁴ ⁵ MAEs can be defined as “a deviation from 
45 
the prescriber’s medication order as written on the patient’s chart, manufacturers’ 
46 
preparation/administration instructions, or relevant institutional policies”.⁶ Direct 
47 
observations of the inpatient medication process produce the most rigorous data on the 
48 
prevalence of medication errors, and suggest that MAEs occur in 5% of non-intravenous and 
49 
35% of intravenous doses⁷ or up to 20% of all doses given.⁸ ⁹ Fortunately, the majority of 
50 
MAEs do not result in harm² ¹⁰, but some are serious or even fatal. An adverse drug event 
51 
(ADE) is defined as “an injury resulting from medical intervention related to a drug".¹¹ 
52 
Medication errors as well as ADEs during hospitalization are more likely in the presence of 
53 
co-morbidity and polypharmacy,² ¹² and among older people.² ¹³ Some drugs are more likely 
54 
to cause significant patient harm when used in error. These are listed as high-alert 
55 
medications by the US Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP).¹⁴ In acute care 
56 
settings, these drug classes include anaesthetics, anti-arrhythmics, anti-thrombotics, 
57 
chemotherapeutics, dialysis solutions, epidural or intrathecal medications, insulin, 
58 
narcotics/opioids, and parenteral nutrition.¹⁴ The UK’s high risk drug list includes 
59 
administration of methotrexate, diamorphine and morphine injections, low molecular 
60 
weight heparins, anticoagulants, insulin, lithium, midazolam injection, opioids, injectable 
61 
medicines, and liquid medicines as well as omitted doses.¹⁵ Additionally, a systematic review 
62 
 MANUSCRIPT

revealed that 47 % of all serious medication errors were caused by seven drugs / drug 
63 
classes. Those were methotrexate, warfarin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), 
64 
digoxin, opioids, acetylic salicylic acid, and beta-blockers.¹⁶   
65 
Analysis of reported medication errors have traditionally included all medication incidents, 
66 
whether or not they result in harm⁴ ⁵. By focussing on the most serious MAEs, the aim was 
67 
to specifically study the characteristics of MAEs reported as resulting in patient death. This 
68 
study’s objectives were 1) to analyse medication administration errors reported in acute 
69 
care as resulting in death, 2) to identify the drugs concerned, 3) to describe MAE 
70 
characteristics by drug group, and 4) to identify potential areas for intervention.   
71 
 
72 
METHODS 
73 
Design & setting 
74 
This was a retrospective study of MAEs reported to the National Reporting & Learning 
75 
System (NRLS) for England and Wales. The NRLS collects national data on all patient safety 
76 
incidents that are voluntarily and anonymously reported by staff employed in the National 
77 
Health Services (NHS) and other health care organisations. Incidents (including near misses 
78 
and incidents causing harm) can also be reported directly to the NRLS. Data reported for 
79 
incidents include both categorical data (e.g. type, severity of incident) and a free text 
80 
description of what happened. 
81 
The original classification of the NRLS incidents were used. Based on this classification, 
82 
location of error included: ward, intensive care unit, operating theatre, recovery room, 
83 
anaesthetic room, therapy department, pharmacy, mortuary, hospital buildings, other, or 
84 
the information was missing. Types of errors were: omitted medicine / ingredient, wrong / 
85 
unclear dose or strength, wrong drug / medicine, wrong frequency, wrong quantity, wrong 
86 
route, adverse drug reaction (when used as intended), patient allergic to treatment, contra-
87 
indication to the use of the medicine in relation to drugs or conditions, mismatching 
88 
between patient and medicine, wrong storage, wrong method of preparation / supply, 
89 
wrong / omitted verbal patient directions, wrong / omitted / passed expiry date, other, or 
90 
unknown.

Data acquisition 
94 
A data sharing agreement was signed after applying and receiving acceptance from NRLS for 
95 
data access. NRLS extracted the data (medication administration errors reported to the 
96 
NRLS between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2016) in December 2017. Inclusion criteria 
97 
were that the incident was documented as involving: 1) medication, 2) administration / 
98 
supply of a medicine from a clinical area, and 3) acute NHS trust (either a specialist or non-
99 
specialist organisation). Of all incidents (n=517,384), 94.3% concerned an acute non-
100 
specialist Trust, and only 5.7% acute specialist Trust. The total number of incidents extracted 
101 
was 517,384. Of these, only MAEs reported as resulting in death caused by a patient safety 
102 
incident (n=229, 0.04%) were analysed. Only the categorical data fields within the NRLS data 
103 
were acquired. 
104 
 
105 
Data analysis 
106 
Descriptive statistics of the data (n=229 MAEs reported as resulting in death)  were 
107 
calculated using IBM SPSS (version 23.0). Characteristics of the data were described using 
108 
frequencies and percentages, and relationships amongst factors explored via cross-
109 
tabulation. Reports including the name of the drug were classified using the British National 
110 
Formulary (BNF) classification.¹⁷ The BNF classification’s main groups are divided under the 
111 
following sections: 1. Gastro-intestinal system, 2. Cardiovascular system, 3. Respiratory 
112 
system, 4. Nervous system, 5. Infection, 6. Endocrine system, 7. Genito-urinary system, 8. 
113 
Malignant disease, 9. Blood and nutrition, 10. Musculoskeletal system, 11. Eye, 12. Ear, 
114 
nose, and oropharynx, 13. Skin, 14. Vaccines, 15. Anaesthesia, and 16. Emergency treatment 
115 
of poisoning. MH classified the drugs into BNF groups which were then verified by BDF. Drug 
116 
categories were cross-tabulated by MAEs’ year, location, patients’ age, and error category. 
117 
The age bands used within the NRLS were amalgamated into six broader groups: 1) under 12 
118 
years, 2) 12-17 years, 3) 18-25 years, 4) 26-55 years, 5) 56-75 years, and 6) over 75 years.

Ethics 
123 
King’s College London ethics committee approved the study (LRS-17/18-5150). The data did 
124 
not include any personal or organisational identifiers, thus anonymity of the reporters, 
125 
patients, other involved persons, and organisations could be guaranteed.

127 
RESULTS 
128 
Characteristics of MAEs resulting in death 
129 
MAEs resulting in death (n=229) occurred most often in 2008 (n=28, 12.2% of all MAEs 
130 
reported as causing death) and 2016 (n=28, 12.2%), and less often 2012 (n=13, 5.7%). 
131 
Overall 66.4% of MAEs were reported as occurring on non-critical care wards, and 41.5% 
132 
(n=95) occurred amongst patients aged over 75 years. The most common error category 
133 
was omitted medicine or ingredient (n=72, 31.4%). (Table 1.) 
134 
 
135 
Drugs related to MAEs 
136 
The name of the related drug was mentioned in 58.1% (n=133) of all MAEs. The most 
137 
common group of drugs in MAEs reported as resulting in death were cardiovascular drugs 
138 
(20.1%, n=46). Of these 26 involved parenteral anticoagulants, six oral anticoagulants, and 
139 
six sympathomimetics. The second most common were drugs of the central nervous system 
140 
(10.0%, n=23). Of those, analgesics (n=10) were most common. Other common drug groups 
141 
were antibacterials (n=20), cytotoxic drugs (n=8), and insulin (n=7). (Tables 2.) More specific 
142 
information by name of drugs concerned (as written in the reports) is presented in Table 3.

(19 of 152). MAEs occurring in intensive care units most commonly concerned drugs used in 
148 
blood and nutrition (4 of 18 incidents in intensive care units) and infection (3 of 18). Most 
149 
MAEs in patients under 12 years were drugs to treat infection (3 of 10 incidents in patients 
150 
under 12 years) whereas for patient’s aged 26-55 years cardiovascular drugs (6 of 29 
151 
incidents in patients aged 26-55 years) were the most common. Cardiovascular drugs (9 of 
152 
58 of incidents in patients aged 56-75) or drugs to treat infection (10 of 58) featured most 
153 
often for patients aged 56-75, and cardiovascular drugs (23 of 95 incidents in patients aged 
154 
over 75 years) and nervous system drugs (11 of 95) for patients aged over 75. (Online 
155 
appendix.) 
156 
The most common error categories for cardiovascular drugs were omitted medicine / 
157 
ingredients (18 of 46 incidents with cardiovascular drugs), followed by wrong / unclear dose 
158 
or strength (6 of 46). For nervous system drugs the most commonly reported errors were 
159 
wrong / unclear dose or strength (4 of 23 incidents with nervous system drugs), wrong 
160 
quantity (3 of 23), and wrong drug / medicine (3 of 23). For drugs to treat infection the most 
161 
commonly reported errors were omitted medicine /ingredient (5 of 21 incidents with drugs 
162 
to treat infection), adverse drug reaction (4 of 21), and patient allergic to treatment (4 of 
163 
21). (Online appendix.) 
164 
 
165 
DISCUSSION 
166 
In this study, MAEs most commonly reported as causing mortality in acute cate Trusts over 
167 
the 10-year period 2007 to 2016 were omissions of drugs. They occurred more often on 
168 
hospital wards than other locations and amongst patients aged over 75 years. The drugs 
169 
most commonly involved were parenteral anticoagulants followed by antibacterial drugs. 
170 
Interventions to reduce MAEs, should therefore focus on those areas.  
171 
Almost one third of MAEs were related to omissions of drug doses. A previous study 
172 
analysing all medication errors reported to the NRLS between 2005 and 2010 also found 
173 
that omissions were the most commonly reported type, accounting for around 15% of 
174 
incidents,⁴ which is much lower than in the present study. In addition, a previous systematic 
175 
review using observational evidence demonstrated that omission errors are the most 
176 
common MAE type internationally.¹⁸ More attention is needed on omissions since the 
177 
 MANUSCRIPT
 
ACCEPTED
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
7 
 
consequences can be serious. The risks of delay or omission of drugs have been categorised 
178 
by the English National Patient safety Agency (NPSA),¹⁹ which suggests that omission of 
179 
anticoagulants, insulins, and cytotoxic agents, as identified in this study, can cause 
180 
significant or catastrophic long-term patient impact. Reasons for medication omissions are 
181 
manifold, such as staff shortages and delays in medication dispensing,²⁰ patients' inability to 
182 
take the medicine, or medication unavailability.²¹ More active solutions for problems related 
183 
to medication omissions should be implemented with the development of technology, 
184 
improving work processes, flow of information, verification systems and availability of 
185 
drugs. Still, it is challenging to recommend any specific interventions, as a previous 
186 
systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that interventions developed to 
187 
decrease MAEs, including nurse training and education, automated delivery systems and 
188 
barcode-assisted medication administration systems, did not find clear effect of the 
189 
interventions.²² 
190 
Cardiovascular drugs, particularly parenteral anticoagulants, were the most common drug 
191 
group involved in MAEs reported as resulting in death. Many of those were omitted or 
192 
administered in the wrong dose, strength, frequency, or quantity. Cardiovascular drugs 
193 
were associated with the highest median proportion of preventable adverse drug reactions 
194 
(PADR) also in a previous review of systematic reviews of inpatients’ PADRs²³. Those were 
195 
also found to be the most frequent types of drugs involved in preventable ADEs²⁴, and 
196 
commonly related to observed MAEs ¹⁸.  Similarly, heparin and low molecular weight 
197 
heparin were amongst the most common drugs reported as causing death in other previous 
198 
studies,⁴ ⁵ demonstrating that the consequences of an error are more devastating for 
199 
patients receiving these types of drugs as there is only a narrow difference between an 
200 
effective and a toxic dose.⁵ In addition, omission of such drugs may have a significant or 
201 
catastrophic long-term impact¹⁹ and the risk of ADEs has ben found to increase especially for 
202 
inpatients with coronary disease and using related drugs.¹² Thus, efforts to avoid dose 
203 
omissions should focus on these patients.  
204 
Antibacterial drugs were also a common group of drugs identified in the present study. 
205 
Most MAEs related to these drugs were omissions, adverse drug reactions, and 
206 
administration to patients with a documented allergy. These drugs have been previously 
207 
found to be related to medication errors causing death,⁴ but are not amongst ISMP's list of 
208 
 MANUSCRIPT

8 
 
high-alert medications.¹⁴ The data in the present study show that patients’ allergies and 
209 
other adverse reactions of drugs may not be verified as carefully as required. Other 
210 
common drugs related to patients’ deaths were opioids, insulins, and cytotoxic drugs, all in 
211 
ISMP's list of high-alert medications¹⁴. The most common error types for nervous systems 
212 
drugs (including opioids) were wrong or unclear dose or strength, wrong drug, or wrong 
213 
quantity. Further research is needed to understand the reasons for these error types.  
214 
Each death caused by medication error is one death too many. There should also be some 
215 
focus on rare and unusual MAEs. For example two MAEs resulting in death were caused by 
216 
the administration of potassium permanganate (orally instead of topically). An NPSA Patient 
217 
Safety Alert produced in 2014 was based on death caused by a patient ingesting potassium 
218 
permanganate.²⁵ One incident in our data occurred before this alert and another 
219 
afterwards, in 2016. More knowledge and competence in handling drugs and administration 
220 
of drugs should be provided to all health professionals, especially nurses, as they are usually 
221 
the final step in the medication use process. Educating patients about the medications they 
222 
are receiving may help to reduce MAEs.  
223 
 
224 
Strengths and limitations 
225 
This study was of a sufficient size to be able to identify rare MAEs that result in death. Drugs 
226 
were classified into BNF category by two researchers, which supports reliability and validity. 
227 
It is known that reported incidents do not represent all those that occur, and it is assumed 
228 
that self-reporting systems (such as the NRLS) detect only a very small proportion of all 
229 
medication incidents². The incident reporting system has further possible weaknesses in 
230 
that reporters may evaluate the consequences of incidents incorrectly such that some of the 
231 
MAEs reported as resulting in death incidents may allude to possible rather than actual 
232 
consequences. It was only possible to identify the name of the drug for 56% of all reports 
233 
and only the categorical fields from the NRLS data were used in this analysis. In addition, the 
234 
original classification of NRLS incidents was used, and it is thus impossible to evaluate what 
235 
error types are hidden under the ‘other’ category. A further issue is whether an ‘adverse 
236 
drug reaction’ may be an MAE when medication is administered for the first time to the 
237 
patient, but descriptions of reported incidents did not include enough information to allow 
238

re-classification. The free text descriptions could have provided a more detailed 
239 
understanding of each incidents and further information about the drugs involved. 
240 
 
241 
 
242 
 
243 
CONCLUSION  
244 
In order to prevent the most serious MAEs, additional studies and interventions should 
245 
focus on dose omissions and administration of drugs to patients over 75 years old, as well as 
246 
safe administration of parenteral anticoagulants and antibacterial drugs. Checking patient 
247 
allergies 
and 
undertaking 
required 
verification 
procedures 
before 
medication 
248 
administration, as well as additional education for safe handling and administration of drugs 
249 
should be mandatory. Additional studies using observational research methods are 
250 
important for exploring further the dynamics of serious MAEs.
