Abstract
The cross-species transmission of viruses from one host species to another is responsible
for the majority of emerging infections. However, it is unclear whether some virus families
have a greater propensity to jump host species than others. If related viruses have an evolu-
tionary history of co-divergence with their hosts there should be evidence of topological simi-
larities between the virus and host phylogenetic trees, whereas host jumping generates
incongruent tree topologies. By analyzing co-phylogenetic processes in 19 virus families
and their eukaryotic hosts we provide a quantitative and comparative estimate of the relative
frequency of virus-host co-divergence versus cross-species transmission among virus fami-
lies. Notably, our analysis reveals that cross-species transmission is a near universal fea-
ture of the viruses analyzed here, with virus-host co-divergence occurring less frequently
and always on a subset of viruses. Despite the overall high topological incongruence among
virus and host phylogenies, the Hepadnaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae, Papillomaviri-
dae and Adenoviridae, all of which possess double-stranded DNA genomes, exhibited more
frequent co-divergence than the other virus families studied here. At the other extreme, the
virus and host trees for all the RNA viruses studied here, particularly the Rhabdoviridae and
the Picornaviridae, displayed high levels of topological incongruence, indicative of frequent
host switching. Overall, we show that cross-species transmission plays a major role in virus
evolution, with all the virus families studied here having the potential to jump host species,
and that increased sampling will likely reveal more instances of host jumping.
Author summary
Emerging infectious diseases are often characterized by host switching events, in which a
pathogen jumps from its original host to infect a novel species. However, given the eco-
logical and genetic barriers a virus must overcome to jump species and adapt to new
hosts, it might be reasonable to assume that successful cross-species transmission is a rela-
tively rare occurrence and that viruses are instead more likely to co-diverge with their
hosts. Using a comparative co-phylogenetic analysis performed at the scale of virus family

 we have revealed that co-divergence is relatively infrequent among 19 diverse families of
RNA and DNA viruses, such that cross-species transmission plays a central role in virus
evolution. Host jumping was especially common in viruses with RNA genomes, and by
drawing broad-scale comparisons our analysis reveals which virus families have a greater
propensity to jump species barriers and hence successfully emerge in new hosts. Finally,
our data suggest that sampling more viruses increases the likelihood of detecting host
jumping events.
Introduction
Emerging pathogens that cross the species barrier to infect new hosts can profoundly affect
human and animal health, as well as wildlife and the agricultural industries. Although most
emerging diseases seemingly result from such a process of cross-species transmission, it is also
the case that some viruses seem to rarely jump the species barrier and instead co-diverge with
their hosts over long stretches of evolutionary time. For example, long-term virus-host co-
divergence has been suggested to play a key role in the evolution of vertebrate herpesviruses
over periods of ~400 million years [1] and insect baculoviruses over a time-scale of ~310 mil-
lion years [2]. Indeed, it has been proposed that a number of families of DNA viruses have co-
diverged with their hosts over long evolutionary time-scales [3–5], and do so more frequently
than RNA viruses, which in contrast display a combination of co-divergence and host switch-
ing [6]. In particular, while phylogenetic trees for some RNA viruses, such as particular
retroviruses, are generally congruent with those from their hosts suggesting long-term co-
divergence [7], for others, such as flaviviruses, host jumping appears to be relatively frequent
[8]. In the case of flaviviruses this likely in part reflects the fact that many are transmitted by
arthropod vectors and characterized by short durations of infection. The situation appears to
be even more complex in cases such as the hantaviruses where there is evidence of both co-
divergence and host jumping [6].
Given the evolutionary and ecological barriers a virus must overcome to cross the species
barrier and successfully establish itself in a new host, it might seem reasonable to assume that
successful cross-species transmission is a relatively rare occurrence [9]. Indeed, many emerg-
ing diseases are in reality ‘spill-over’ infections, in which onward transmission between mem-
bers of a new host species is limited such that extinction of the novel virus occurs rapidly [5].
Nevertheless, it is possible that an increased sampling of hosts and their viruses will reveal
more instances of host jumping, in turn implying that cross-species transmission is a funda-
mental aspect of virus evolution [8]. As a case in point, although there is strong evidence that
hepadnaviruses have co-diverged with their vertebrate hosts over hundreds of millions of years
[10], the recent identification of hepadnaviruses in fish and amphibians has revealed more
instances of cross-species transmission, potentially including that from aquatic to terrestrial
vertebrates [11].
Clearly, identifying the relative frequencies of co-divergence versus cross-species transmis-
sion is of central importance to understanding the basic mechanisms of virus evolution and
disease emergence. In particular, it is important to determine whether some virus families
have a greater propensity to jump hosts than others and, if so, what factors govern this pattern.
Currently, however, there is no quantitative or comparative measure of the frequency of cross-
species transmission versus co-divergence, so that determining whether one virus family is
more likely to jump species boundaries than another is difficult to assess. One simple and pow-
erful way to estimate these key evolutionary parameters is via ‘co-phylogenetic’ analysis that

 assesses the degree of phylogenetic congruence (i.e. similarity) between hosts and their para-
sites [12]. In particular, a clear congruence between the host and virus phylogenies provides
strong evidence for a history of co-divergence, whereas phylogenetic incongruence (i.e. discor-
dance) is compatible with cross-species transmission.
To date, co-phylogenetic studies of viruses have largely focused on the evolution of a subset
of viruses within a particular virus family, and have not been performed in a comparative man-
ner. For example, although there has been much work dedicated toward describing co-diver-
gence in herpesviruses, these studies generally only encompass one particular host type (e.g.
primates [13]) and so may fail to capture the broader picture of potential host jumps among
more distantly related species. Hence, there has been no attempt to use analyses of this kind to
provide a broad-scale comparative and quantitative measure of the frequency of co-divergence
and cross-species transmission in virus evolution. Herein, we provide such an analysis. Specifi-
cally, using a normalized tree topology distance metric based on the Penny and Hendy dis-
tance metric that enables comparisons between pairs of virus and host trees with different
numbers of tips [14], which we now term the ‘nPH85’ distance (where n = normalized), we
compare phylogenies of virus families and their hosts. While this method does not explicitly
model host-switching events, it does provide a simple means to compare multiple topologies
of virus-host pairs, and accounts for differences in sample size and the fact that several viruses
from a specific family can infect a single host species.
To provide a quantitative measure of host switching we compared 19 virus families, incor-
porating viruses infecting a diverse sample of eukaryotic hosts including mammals, birds, rep-
tiles, amphibians, fish, plants and insects. Under the measure we utilize here, when nPH85 = 0
between the virus and host trees it implies that their topologies are identical such that there is
very strong evidence for co-divergence (Fig 1A). Conversely, if nPH85 = 1, there are no clades
in common such that co-divergence is implausible (Fig 1B). Crucially, this metric does not
depend on where the mismatched clades are located in the tree. For example, for a pair of virus
and host trees that differ in one clade, the nPH85 is the same whether species jumping events
were recent (i.e. shallow nodes Fig 1C) or ancient (i.e. deep nodes Fig 1D). Importantly, the
nPH85 distance increases as the number of incongruent nodes (i.e. nodes that differ) between
the virus and host trees increases (Fig 1E).
Results
A phylogenetic measure of the relative frequency of virus-host co-
divergence
Our analysis considered a total of seven DNA and 12 RNA virus data sets that provided suffi-
cient data to perform a quantitative co-phylogenetic analysis. Hence, the study relied heavily
on specific selection criteria (see Materials and methods) that necessarily limited data availabil-
ity. Despite these rigorous criteria, the majority of data sets encompassed a diverse collection
of viruses and host species, and hence can be regarded as illustrative of the broad-scale fre-
quency of co-divergence versus cross-species transmission. These data contained no evidence
for recombination.
To determine the prevalence of host switching between different viruses, we inferred fam-
ily-level viral phylogenies and compared these to phylogenies of their hosts. Importantly, our
analytical approach—which utilizes the nPH85 distance—provides a relative measure of phy-
logenetic congruence that is directly comparable between data sets that differ in size (i.e. differ-
ent number of viruses and host species). Our method assumes that viruses that have co-
diverged with their hosts will share the same tree topology. In contrast, an increasing number
of host jumping events should lead to greater phylogenetic incongruence. The reasoning

 behind this assumption is that there exists a very large number of possible phylogenetic tree
topologies even for data sets with a few samples, such that similarities between a pair of virus-
host trees (i.e. congruence) are highly unlikely to arise by chance. Of course, phylogenetic
events other than cross-species transmission might also lead to phylogenetic incongruence
and we test the validity of this assumption later in the manuscript.
Across the data set as a whole we found that all virus families displayed relatively large tree
topological distances with nPH85 values of �0.6, suggesting that cross-species transmission is
widespread, at least at the family-level (Fig 2; S3 Table). While all families showed distances at
the upper end of the scale, the Hepadnaviridae (double-stranded DNA) had the shortest dis-
tance (nPH85 = 0.6), indicating that this family experiences more frequent co-divergence than
any other studied here. At the other end of the spectrum both the Rhabdoviridae and Picorna-
viridae (single-stranded RNA) displayed nPH85 > 0.97, indicative of frequent host switching
and hence little evidence for virus-host co-divergence.
We also investigated when the species jumping events occurred in the evolutionary history
of the virus families. To do this, we determined whether phylogenetic incongruences tended to

hosts have congruent phylogenies—indicative of strong virus-host co-divergence—then there will obviously be more horizontal than diagonal lines.
Panel (A) illustrates a perfectly matched topology between virus and host trees and thus the nPH85 = 0. Panel (B) exemplifies an entirely mismatched
topology between virus and host trees, where the nPH85 = 1. Data from viruses in nature will fall between these two extremes. Panels (C) and (D)
illustrate two examples where the host trees have one incongruent node. Panel (C) corresponds to a shallower section of the tree than in panel (D), but
the two nPH85 are the same, such that the position of the incongruence does not produce a systematic bias. Panel (E) elucidates the relationship
between the nPH85 distance and the number of incongruent nodes between a pair of simulated trees with 100 tips.

 occur in deeper sections of the phylogeny or to more shallow nodes in the tree. Accordingly,
we considered the number of nodes subtending clades in the host tree that are not present in
the virus tree, a metric known as ‘node depth’. Nodes that are deep correspond to clades that
are more diverse, and often older, than those clades subtended by shallower nodes. For each
pair of virus-host trees we calculated the depth of every node that differed within each virus-
host pair and divide each depth by the maximum node depth (Fig 3). This normalized metric,
which we term ‘relative node depth’, ranges between near 0 for phylogenetic incongruences at
shallow nodes, and 1 for incongruences at deeper nodes. Most incongruences corresponded to
shallow nodes, which is expected because there are naturally more shallow nodes than deep
nodes in phylogenetic trees. However, that incongruences were found in both shallow and
deep nodes suggests that co-divergence is relatively rare in these virus families, even over long
evolutionary time-scales.

indicative of virus-host co-divergence, while nPH85 = 1 suggests frequent cross-species transmission (red). For ease of interpretation

 Tanglegrams depicting pairs of rooted phylogenetic trees display the evolutionary relation-
ship between each virus family and their host species (Fig 4; phylogenies with the individual
tip labels visible are shown in S1 Fig). Despite the obvious widespread occurrence of host
jumping, a number of co-phylogenies reveal the occurrence of at least some co-divergence, as
expected from the nPH85 distances. For example, the tanglegrams for the Hepadnaviridae and
Poxviridae exhibit some clear matches with the evolutionary histories of their respective hosts.
Most notably, their co-phylogenies show a clear segregation between distinct clades that are
associated with a specific host type (mammals, birds, etc.). Conversely, the phylogenies of
most RNA viruses appear to largely mismatch those of their hosts.
Our fundamental assumption is that incongruences between virus and host topologies
imply the occurrence of cross-species transmission. To test the validity of this assumption, we
reconciled the viruses with the phylogenetic history of their hosts. By associating ‘event costs’

can be interpreted as the occurrence of host-switching events at the tips of the phylogenetic tree, whereas a
relative node depth close to 1 suggests host-switching events at the root of the phylogenetic tree. A range of

 with host-jumping, as well as with lineage duplication and extinction events, we found the
range of optimal co-phylogenetic solutions for each virus family (Fig 5A). As with the analysis
of topological distances, this revealed that cross-species transmission was the most common
evolutionary event in all virus families studied here, with co-divergence consistently less

 frequent (with the possible exception of the Hepadnaviridae–see below), and lineage duplica-
tion and extinction playing a much more minor role. We next reconstructed the history of
these evolutionary events in detail in the Hepadnaviridae (i.e. the most co-divergent virus fam-
ily). This revealed that under the most likely co-phylogenetic scenario the proportion of cross-
species transmission represents 0.57 of all events (i.e. co-divergence = 9 events; duplications = 0;
extinction = 1; host-jumping = 13; Fig 5B). Since the nPH85 distance for the hepadnavirus
data set was 0.6, we suggest that our method generates results consistent with the reconcilia-
tion analysis. In addition, one important disadvantage of performing full reconciliation analy-
sis is that co-phylogenetic methods such as that implemented in Jane [15] and Tarzan [16] are
not straightforward since they offer many combinations of possible events and are difficult to
compare between families, especially in cases with more than ~50 viruses where there are
many possible co-phylogenetic scenarios. Despite these limitations, our reconciliation analysis
did reveal the possible causes of the topological incongruence between the virus and host
phylogenies.
Correlates of cross-species transmission and co-divergence
We next determined whether there was any association between the relative frequency of co-
divergence and larger scale biological properties, such as the number of viruses per family and
whether the viruses in question possess RNA or DNA genomes. To better display this analysis
branches on the co-phylogenetic trees were colored according to host type, which comprised
mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates, and plants (Fig 4), such that each co-
phylogeny incorporated between one (i.e. Potyviridae) and five (i.e. Togoviridae) host types.
Notably, we found a significant association between the number of viruses per virus family
and the nPH85 (p<0.005) (Fig 6A). Importantly, because we expect no association between

associated with incongruences between trees were conservative towards co-divergence and defined here as: 0 for co-divergence, 1 for duplication, 1 for
host-jumping and 1 for extinction. Virus families are ranked in order of highest mean co-divergence to lowest mean co-divergence. Abbreviations on the

 the number of viruses and hosts per family and the nPH85 under our tree distance metric, this
result implies that sampling more viruses increases the likelihood of detecting host jumping
events. In addition, we found that DNA viral families had, on average, a shorter nPH85 dis-
tance than families of RNA viruses (p<0.05) (Fig 6B). Note that there is no significant differ-
ence (p = 0.5) between the number of viruses in families of DNA viruses compared to those in
RNA virus families. In this context it is striking that the five families with the shortest topologi-
cal distances all possessed DNA genomes. This analysis also revealed that segmented viruses
had a significantly larger nPH85 distance than non-segmented viruses (p<0.05), and that
negative-sense RNA viruses had a larger nPH85 distance than positive-sense RNA viruses
(p<0.005); however, the sample sizes within all these categories were small so that these results
should be treated with caution. Finally, we note that although the duration of infection (for
example, the division between acute versus chronic infections) is clearly a parameter that
would likely affect the frequency of host jumping [3, 5], we were unfortunately unable to per-
form any analyses of this variable on the data available here as it tends to be host-specific rather
than a general characteristic of individual virus families.
Discussion
Understanding how viruses and their hosts co-evolve is central to revealing the nature of virus
evolution and the determinants of disease emergence. In particular, we lack a quantitative
understanding of whether some types of virus, such as those classified into different families or
that possess genomes of different nucleic acid types, are better able to jump species boundaries
compared to others. To investigate the comparative prevalence of cross-species transmission
among viruses we measured the congruence between virus and host phylogenetic trees using a
normalized tree topological distance-based approach (nPH85, [14]). If taxonomically related
viruses have an evolutionary history of co-divergence with their hosts the virus and host phylo-
genetic trees should be similar in topology, whereas phylogenetic incongruence is the signature
of species jumping. Overall, our analysis revealed absolute departure from co-divergence
among all the virus families studied here (nPH85 � 0.6 and supported by the reconciliation

 analysis) suggesting that cross-species transmission occurs frequently, at least at the level of
virus family. Particularly striking was that even the most slowly evolving DNA viruses, which
have previously been suggested to represent exemplars of virus-host co-divergence [1], exhibit
relatively common cross-species transmission. Hence, at their most basic, these results indicate
that viruses are often exposed to a variety of susceptible host species that provide opportunities
for cross-species transmission.
Despite the overall large nPH85 distances observed among all virus families, our data also
revealed that the Hepadnaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Poxviridae, Papillomaviridae and Adenoviri-
dae had the shortest nPH85 distances and were thus relatively more host-specific than the
other virus families analyzed here. This is supportive of earlier suggestions that some DNA
viruses have a long history of co-divergence with their hosts [4], which in some cases may be a
reflection of relatively long durations of infection. Indeed, long-term virus-host associations
have been observed in the Herpesviridae [1], the Poxviridae [17] and the Polyomaviridae [18].
However, it is also important to note that we found these viruses contain more instances of
host jumping than previously thought. For example, although the tanglegram shown in Fig 4
suggests co-divergence in the case of some primate hepadnaviruses, cross-species transmission
seemingly occurs more frequently among those hepadnaviruses that infect birds. In addition,
it was recently observed that a fish (bluegill) hepadnavirus clusters more closely with mamma-
lian hepadnaviruses than to other fish viruses [11] (see Figs 4 and 5B). Similarly, early studies
of RNA viruses suggested that virus-host co-divergence was important in the evolution of two
members of the Flaviviridae that infect primates—the pegiviruses and hepaciviruses, [19–21].
However, more recent phylogenetic analyses of expanded data sets have revealed multiple
cross-species transmissions events, including the recent emergence of hepaciviruses in domes-
tic dogs, horses and donkeys [22], and a newly described pegiviruses in rodents, bats and
horses [23].
Despite the obvious caveat of sample size, it seems that RNA viruses generally experience
more frequent cross-species transmission than their DNA counterparts. Indeed, the RNA viral
families analyzed here had an overall mean nPH85 distance of 0.95, compared to DNA viruses
with a mean of 0.84. This may, in part, be due to the fact that RNA viruses are generally charac-
terized by very high rates of mutation and replication [24]. Intuitively, high rates of evolution-
ary change should confer more rapid adaptation to new environments, which, coupled with
the frequency of exposure to new hosts, will facilitate host-switching. In addition, many RNA
viruses are characterized by short durations of infection that will limit the opportunities for
virus-host co-divergence [4]. An informative exception among RNA viruses are the simian
foamy viruses (SFV), in which hosts may develop long-term latent infections and the virus has
been associated with long-term co-divergence [25]. Indeed, it is notable that among the Retro-
viridae analyzed here those assigned to SFV seem to display relatively similar evolutionary his-
tories to those of their primate hosts (see S1 Fig).
It is also possible that successful cross-species transmission occurs more frequently among
phylogenetically related hosts, likely because it is easier to infect and replicate in genetically
similar hosts that share less divergent cell receptors [26]. In addition, related hosts may some-
times inhabit the same geographic region, increasing the probability of cross-species transmis-
sion through more frequent exposure [13]. Indeed, a useful generality in studies of disease
emergence is that the closer the phylogenetic relationship between hosts, then, given appropri-
ate exposure, the more likely that a pathogen will be able to jump between them, in turn lead-
ing to preferential host switching [27]. If true, so that cross-species transmission results in a
viral phylogeny that mirrors that of their hosts, then any phylogeny-based approach such as
that utilized here will underestimate the true frequency of host jumping. As a case in point,
although there is a general concordance between the phylogenies of simian immunodeficiency

 virus (SIV) and their primate hosts, in which four species of African green monkey harbor dis-
tinct forms of SIV that is clearly suggestive of co-divergence [19], it has been argued that the
evolutionary history of SIV may also have been shaped by preferential host switching [28],
although these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. In contrast, incomplete lineage sorting
among closely related viruses may produce a false signal for cross-species transmission when
co-divergence has in fact occurred [19]. In addition, because there is growing evidence that
viruses can have complex evolutionary histories with genes derived from multiple sources
[29], it is important to note that our virus phylogenies are necessarily gene trees rather than
species trees. It is therefore possible that other virus gene trees will exhibit a stronger topologi-
cal match with host phylogenies than those presented here, and hence provide more evidence
for co-divergence. Finally, while our analysis was only based on robust phylogenetic patterns,
because nodes that were topologically uncertain were excluded from the analysis, it is possible
that our virus trees contain topological errors reflecting the use of sometimes small numbers
of highly divergent sequences.
Another important aspect of assessing virus-host co-divergence is that the evolutionary
time-scales of viruses and their hosts are consistent [30]. Although such a comparison is valu-
able, it is problematic for the present study because high rates of evolution lead to substitu-
tional saturation in virus genomes at a much faster rate than in cellular organisms. Indeed, it is
likely that many of the cross-species transmission events implied here have occurred on time-
scales of many millions of years. As a result, temporal signal is rapidly lost, precluding accurate
estimates of their long-term evolutionary time-scales, even though the topology is often accu-
rately recovered [31]. We therefore suggest that simpler topological comparisons such as those
performed here may be a more informative way to proceed in family-level studies of cross-spe-
cies transmission versus co-divergence.
Overall, we have observed frequent cross-species transmission across the virus families
studied here, with relatively little evidence for virus-host co-divergence. Hence, our study sug-
gests that, at the virus family scale in the data analyzed here, host switching plays a major role
in the evolution and diversification of viruses and, importantly, that it can occur in viruses of
all types. Interestingly, we found that increased sampling of viruses from different host species
reveals more frequent species jumping events among viral families. As such, the discovery of
new viruses is likely to reveal more instances of cross-species transmission. Undoubtedly, the
analysis presented here should be extended to a wider range of data sets as they become avail-
able, particularly because increased taxon sampling results in a larger tree space and increases
the statistical power of these analyses.
Materials and methods
Data collection
Gene sequence data of viruses were obtained from GenBank (Table 1; see S1 Table for all Gen-
Bank accession numbers). Following a broad and comprehensive survey of all virus genomic
data available on GenBank, a total of 19 family-level virus data sets passed our selection criteria
and were included in the analysis. These selection criteria, which are independent of whether
the viruses have evolved by co-divergence or cross-species transmission, were: (i) the availabil-

 The virus families that passed these selection criteria were the Adenoviridae, Bunyaviridae,
Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae,
Papillomaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Potyviridae,
Poxviridae, Reoviridae, Retroviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Togaviridae. Each data set contained
between 23–142 viruses from a diverse range of eukaryotic hosts, including mammals, birds,
reptiles, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, and plants. For the purposes of this study we regarded
a virus isolated from a particular host species as a distinct virus sample worthy of analysis: for
example, rabies virus isolated from a human host was deemed distinct from rabies virus iso-
lated from a canine host. The resulting virus and host data sets included in this study com-
prised a diverse sample of the available data (see S2 Table for a summary of the virus and host
diversity). Most data sets contained more viruses than those from their corresponding hosts
because they included multiple viruses from a family that can infect the same host.
Phylogenetic analysis
For each virus family nucleotide sequences were first translated to amino acid data using Seqo-
tron v.1.0.1 [32], aligned with MUSCLE v.3.8 [33], and poorly aligned regions then eliminated
using trimAl [34], ensuring that all remaining sequences were at least 100 amino acids in
length (Table 1). Amino acid sequences were aligned because there is widespread substitu-
tional saturation at the nucleotide level. Although our data sets utilize single genes, we ensured
that they were free of inter-specific virus recombination using RAT [35].

Cross-species transmission among viral families

 To estimate phylogenetic trees for the virus data sets we selected the optimal amino acid
substitution model identified using the Bayesian Information Criterion as implemented in
Modelgenerator v0.85 [36] and analyzed the data using PhyML v3.1 [37], employing the SPR
branch-swapping tree search algorithm (see Table 1 for the substitution models used). We
assessed the support for individual nodes using the approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT)
implemented in PhyML v3.1 [38], with aLRT values ranging between 0 (no support) and 1
(strong support). Studies involving simulations and empirical data have demonstrated that
this statistic has similar false-positive rates to other metrics, such as the non-parametric boot-
strap [39].
Cladograms were constructed for all host species from which the viruses of interest were
isolated. In each case the host tree topologies used were the most up-to-date available in the lit-
erature [40–44]. For the vector-borne viruses studied here, in which viruses pass between
arthropods and vertebrates, the appropriate vertebrate species were assigned as the hosts. In
contrast, for insect-specific viruses, where there is no evidence for vertebrate involvement, the
relevant invertebrate species were assigned as the hosts. Since there were often multiple viruses
that infected the same host species, multiple lineages within a single host (i.e. polytomies) were
added to the host phylogenetic tree to ensure the number of hosts equaled that of the virus
tree. The addition of these polytomies does not influence the nPH85 distance metric
(described in detail below) because the distance between a polytomous clade and one that is
fully resolved is zero [14].
All virus and host phylogenetic trees and virus sequence alignments are available at github.

Analysis of virus-host co-divergence
We measured the extent of virus-host co-divergence (and by exclusion host-jumping) by com-
paring, in a quantitative manner, the tree topologies for viruses and their corresponding hosts.
To this end we calculated a normalized PH85 tree topological distance [14], referred to here as
the ‘nPH85’ distance (this function has been included in NELSI v0.1 [45]). Specifically, the
nPH85 distance, which utilizes two phylogenetic trees as its input, describes the number of
bipartitions (clades) that are not shared between two tree topologies. Importantly, it does not
depend on the nodes where the topological differences occur in the tree (Fig 1). In addition,
this metric considers the tree topology of unrooted trees, but not the branch lengths of the
tree. First, the PH85 metric is calculated as the topological distance between a pair of unrooted
trees. It can be understood in terms of the following:
ð T1 \ T2Þ
0;
where T1 and T2 are the clades contained within the host and virus trees, respectively. Let the
expression T1 \ T2 denote the clades that are shared between both trees so that (T1 \ T2)0 cor-
responds to the clades that are not shared between the pair (i.e. those that are unique to each
tree). The actual PH85 distance is twice the number of unique clades. To normalize this metric
we divide PH85 by the maximum distance by considering the two tree topologies, randomiz-
ing the tips for one of the trees 1000 times, and calculating PH85 for each replicate (where
1000 randomizations was shown to be robust even for very large trees; see S2 Fig). The largest
value of the 1000 randomizations is approximately the maximum PH85 distance in tree topol-
ogies. Therefore, nPH85 ranges between 0, for identical trees, and 1, for trees that have no
clades in common (Fig 1). The advantages of this method over other tree distance metrics is
that it is comparable for pairs of trees with different numbers of tips, it maintains the backbone
of the tree (i.e. the tree structure remains constant, unlike in [46]), and it is comparable for

 trees with polytomous nodes. To address phylogenetic uncertainty, we collapsed all nodes with
aLRT of less than 0.8, which corresponds to a false-positive rate of <0.1 [39]. In such cases, we
randomly resolved the polytomies 100 times and calculated the nPH85. Accordingly, we report
the overall normalized topology distance, as well as the mean and 95% percentile range of val-
ues (S3 Table).
To determine whether host jumping occurred more often toward the root or tips of the
trees, we calculated the relative node depth for incongruent nodes between virus-host pairs
of trees (see Fig 1C and 1D). This metric counts the number of nodes contained within each
clade in the host tree that are not present in the virus tree. Because this number can depend
on the size of the tree, we divide each of the node depths by the largest value in the tree.
Accordingly, this metric is decreased if incongruent clades correspond to shallow nodes
(Fig 1C) compared to deep nodes (Fig 1D). For example, the maximum node depth is 1 if a
pair of trees differs in the deepest node and approaches 0 if they differ only in very shallow
nodes.
An important assumption of the current study is that incongruence between virus and
host topologies is a result of cross-species transmission. In some instances, however, it might
be possible to explain the lack of virus-host co-evolutionary history through multiple
instances of lineage duplication and extinction, without such host-switching events. To
address this issue, we reconciled the co-phylogenetic relationship between viruses and their
hosts. In particular, we determined the optimal solutions for co-phylogenetic reconstruction
for all families, including the possibility of lineage duplication and extinction, using the Jane
co-phylogenetic software package [15]. This uses a polynomial time dynamic programming
algorithm in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to find optimal solutions to reconcile co-
phylogenies. Although this is a simple heuristic method, it is able to generate results on
relatively large data sets (although it is most effective for trees with less that ~40–50 tips).
Importantly, we used ‘event costs’ associated with incongruences between trees that were
conservative towards co-divergence and defined here as: 0 for co-divergence, 1 for duplica-
tion, 1 for host-jumping and 1 for extinction. Utilizing this reconciliation, we also examined
the evolution of the Hepadnaviridae in more detail as this family contains the best evidence
for co-divergence (see Results).
Finally, to assist in visualization of these data, tanglegrams for each virus family were con-
structed using TreeMap v3.0 [47]. Lines between the trees connect the host (left) with its virus
(right). We utilized the ‘untangle’ function, which rotates the branches of one tree, to minimize
the number of crosses lines. If viruses and hosts have congruent topologies then the number of
crossed lines, and hence cross-species transmission events, will obviously be reduced.
