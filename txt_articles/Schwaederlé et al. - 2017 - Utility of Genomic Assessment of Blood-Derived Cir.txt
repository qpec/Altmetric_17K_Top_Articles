Abstract
Purpose: Genomic alterations in blood-derived circulating
tumor DNA (ctDNA) from patients with non–small cell lung
adenocarcinoma (NSCLC) were ascertained and correlated with
clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes.
Experimental Design: Comprehensive plasma ctDNA testing
was performed in 88 consecutive patients; 34 also had tissue
next-generation sequencing; 29, other forms of genotyping;
and 25 (28.4%) had no tissue molecular tests because
of inadequate tissue or biopsy contraindications.
Results:Seventy-twopatients(82%)had�1ctDNAalteration(s);
among these, 75% carried alteration(s) potentially actionable
by FDA-approved (61.1%) or experimental drug(s) in clinical
trials (additional 13.9%). The most frequent alterations were in
the TP53 (44.3% of patients), EGFR (27.3%), MET (14.8%), KRAS
(13.6%), and ALK (6.8%) genes. The concordance rate for EGFR
alterations was 80.8% (100% vs. 61.5%; �1 vs. >1 month
between ctDNA and tissue tests; P ¼ 0.04) for patients with any
detectable ctDNA alterations. Twenty-five patients (28.4%)
received therapy matching �1 ctDNA alteration(s); 72.3%
(N ¼ 16/22) of the evaluable matched patients achieved
stable disease �6 months (SD) or partial response (PR). Five
patients with ctDNA-detected EGFR T790M were subsequently
treated with a third generation EGFR inhibitor; all five achieved
SD � 6 months/PR. Patients with �1 alteration with �5% variant
allele fraction (vs. < 5%) had a significantly shorter median
survival (P ¼ 0.012).
Conclusions: ctDNA analysis detected alterations in the
majority of patients, with potentially targetable aberrations
found at expected frequencies. Therapy matched to ctDNA
alterations demonstrated appreciable therapeutic efficacy, sug-
gesting clinical utility that warrants future prospective studies.

Introduction
Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of death in the United
States (1). Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adenocarcinoma
subtype, is the most common histologic variant. Despite advances
in early detection and standard of care, NSCLCs are often iden-
tified at advanced stages and have a poor prognosis. Adenocar-
cinoma is the most frequent histology in lifetime never-smokers,
women, and younger adults (<60 years; ref. 2).
The classification and treatment paradigm for NSCLC chan-
ged drastically in 2004 with the discovery of the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as a driver in NSCLC,
occurring in about 10% to 30% of patients (3, 4). The presence
of EGFR-activating mutations impacts not only the response
rate, but also progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with
NSCLC treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs;
refs. 5–7). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusions were
later found to also play a driver role in NSCLC, though these
anomalies are less frequent (about 4%–5% of NSCLC). Patients
bearing ALK abnormalities respond well to small molecule ALK
inhibitors such as crizotinib (8). In addition to EGFR and ALK,
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) NSCLC
guidelines recommend testing for 5 additional markers with
associated targeted therapies. As the list of targetable alterations
grows, tissue biopsy specimens are often inadequate for com-
prehensive evaluation and a subset are insufficient for any
genomic profiling (9). For patients successfully genotyped and
treated with targeted therapy, acquired resistance (e.g., EGFR
T790M or ALK L1196M resistance mutation; refs. 10–12)
ultimately limits the long-term utility of targeted therapies
despite impressive initial response rates. Second-line therapies
targeting the resistance mutations (e.g., osimertinib or alecti-
nib) are becoming available but require contemporary tumor
profiling to identify the acquired mutations.
Genomic profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provides
an attractive alternative to repeat biopsy in patients whose tissue is
insufficient in the first line and at progression. These noninvasive
liquid biopsies are increasingly entering the clinical setting for
patients with NSCLC. Indeed, because ctDNA tests require only a
small amount of blood, they are far easier to obtain and less

 expensive than repeat tissue biopsies. Liquid biopsies can poten-
tially be used not only to detect actionable anomalies, but also to
identify acquired resistance mutations (12, 13). In addition,
because ctDNA can originate from the primary site and/or metas-
tases, and it is known that there is intra-patient heterogeneity in
the molecular makeup of different metastases (14, 15), assess-
ment of ctDNA may conceivably deliver a more comprehensive
picture of the entire malignant molecular portfolio.
We previously reported that almost half of patients with diverse
solid tumors (excluding brain tumors) have a theoretically action-
able alteration based on genomic anomalies identified in plasma-
derived ctDNA (16). In this study, we analyzed the ctDNA test
results and relevant clinical outcomes of 88 patients with lung
adenocarcinoma.
Materials and Methods
Patients
We retrospectively reviewed the clinicopathologic and out-
come data of 88 consecutively tested patients with lung adeno-
carcinoma followed at UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center, for
whom molecular testing (ctDNA test) had been performed on
their plasma (August 2014 until October 2015). Data were
abstracted from the electronic medical record and performed in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. For all patients, this
study (PREDICT-UCSD (Profile Related Evidence Determining
Individualized Cancer Therapy; NCT02478931) was performed
and consents obtained whenever necessary after approval by
UCSD Institutional Review Board guidelines.
Sequencing
Digital Sequencing of ctDNA (DNA) in all patients was per-
formed by Guardant Health, Inc. (Guardant360, Redwood City,
CA; http://www.guardanthealth.com/guardant360/), a Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified and Col-
lege of American Pathologists (CAP)-accredited clinical labora-
tory. The analytical and clinical validation of Guardant360 was
conducted in conformance with evidentiary standards established
by the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD),
REporting of tumor MARKer Studies (REMARK), Evaluation of
Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP), and
the recent Next-generation Sequencing: Standardization of Clin-
ical Testing (Nex-StoCT) biomarker guidelines (17).
As described in Lanman and colleagues (17), 5 to 30 ng of
ctDNA was isolated from plasma (two 10 mL Streck tubes drawn
for each patient) and sequencing libraries were prepared with
custom in-line barcode molecular tagging, and complete sequenc-
ing at 15,000x read depth (�4,000 unique double-stranded
cfDNA fragments, each represented by 3–5 sequencing reads).
The current panel utilizes hybrid capture followed by NGS of the
critical exons in a panel of 70 genes and reports all four major
types of genomic alterations (point mutations, indels, fusions,
and copy-number amplifications). Post-sequencing bioinformat-
ics matches the complementary strands of each barcoded DNA
fragment to remove false positive results (17). The variant allele
fraction (VAF) is computed as the number of mutated DNA
molecules divided by the total number (mutated plus wild-type)
of DNA fragments at that allele; VAF is reported as a percentage.
The majority of cell-free DNA is wild-type (germline); thus, the
median VAF of somatic alterations is <0.5%.
For 40 patients, a 54-gene panel was used, which identified
potential tumor-related alterations in 54 cancer-related genes
(Supplementary Table S1), including copy-number amplifica-
tions in ERBB2, EGFR, and MET (indels and fusions were not
detected as part of this panel). For 47 patients, a 68-gene version of
the original panel (expanded to all four major alteration types)
was used, and for one patient, the most recent 70-gene panel
version (further expanded to amplifications in 18 genes and
fusions in 6 genes) was applied (Supplementary Tables S2 and
S3). Only nonsynonymous alterations were included in our
analysis [variants of unknown significance (VUSs) did not include
synonymous alterations; Supplementary Table S4].
In addition, 34 of 88 patients (42%) who had ctDNA results
also had CLIA/CAP-accredited next-generation sequencing (NGS)
performed on tumor tissue (FoundationOne; http://www.foun
dationone.com). An additional 29 patients had various other
types of tissue molecular testing.
Concordance rate
For the 34 patients who had both types of tests (tissue NGS
and plasma ctDNA testing that covered the same genes and
alteration types revealed in the tissue NGS), we assessed the
concordance for EGFR alterations and corresponding kappa
statistics (Supplementary Table S5), which are a conservative
measurement of relative agreement that takes into account
agreement by chance. Kappa values range from k ¼ 1 (perfect
agreement) to k ¼ 0 (no agreement other than would be
expected by chance; ref. 18). We also performed this analysis
excluding the patients that had "no alterations detected" as the
lack of alterations could be because no ctDNA was detected in
the plasma (N ¼ 26 patients included). In these 26 patients, we
also conducted a concordance analysis including all alterations
that were potentially detectable by both tests (i.e., included in
both gene panels).
Matched therapy and actionability
Treatment was considered "matched" if at least one agent in the
treatment regimen targeted at least one abnormality or pathway
component aberrant in a patient's molecular profile either pro-
spectively or retrospectively.
Translational Relevance
Genomic profiling of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) pro-
vides an attractive alternative over repeat invasive biopsy in
patients whose tissue is insufficient in the first line and at
progression. Noninvasive liquid biopsies are increasingly
entering the clinical setting for patients with non–small cell
lung adenocarcinoma (NSCLC) and while there is a growing
body of literature describing targeted ctDNA performance for
specific alterations assayed in association with investigational
drug clinical trials, there are little data evaluating the perfor-
mance and clinical outcomes of multigene ctDNA assays in
clinical use. In this clinical use study, ctDNA analysis detected
alterations in the majority of NSCLC patients, with potentially
targetable aberrations found at expected frequencies, and
therapy matched to ctDNA alterations demonstrated appreci-
able therapeutic efficacy, suggesting clinical utility. Further
prospective validation of an approach that uses ctDNA to
guide management is warranted.

 Actionability implies that the protein product of a genomic
abnormality can be affected by a specific targeted drug (19). A
potentially actionable alteration was defined as an alteration that
was either the direct target (such as an EGFR inhibitor targeting an
EGFR mutation), or a pathway component [such as an mTOR
inhibitor for a PIK3CA mutation (because mTOR is downstream
of PIK3CA)] that could be targeted by at least one FDA-approved
or investigational drug in a clinical trial. Actionability was con-
sidered at the variant level; variants of unknown significance
(functional consequences and clinical significance of these gene
variants are not established, as opposed to characterized altera-
tions) were considered nonactionable.
Statistical analysis
When appropriate, median and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) or range were reported. The following clinical end-
points were considered: (i) rate of [stable disease (SD) � 6
months/partial
response
(PR)/complete
response
(CR)];
(ii) progression-free survival (PFS); and (iii) overall survival
(OS). SD, PR, or CR was determined per assessment of the
treating physician. PFS and OS were defined as the time from
the beginning of therapy to progression (for PFS)/death event
(for OS) or the time to last follow-up. For the analysis exam-
ining the correlation between the percentage of ctDNA and
survival, we defined OS as the time from the ctDNA test results
to death or last follow-up date for patients who were alive (the
latter were censored on that date). The cutoff date of the
analysis was December 28, 2015; all patients who were pro-
gression-free (for PFS) or alive (for OS) as of the date of analysis
were censored on that date unless their date of last follow-up
was earlier, in which case that was the date of censoring.
Whenever appropriate, c2 tests were used to compare cat-
egorical variables and the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U
test to compare two groups on one continuous variable.
Binary logistic regressions were performed for categorical end-
points and multiple linear regressions for continuous vari-
ables. PFS and OS were analyzed by the Kaplan–Meier method
(20), and the log-rank test was used to compare variables.
Statistical analysis was performed by MS with IBM Statistics
SPSS version 22.0.
Results
Patient characteristics
Our population was comprised of 88 patients with NSCLC
(adenocarcinoma) who had an NGS ctDNA test performed on
their plasma. Patient's median age at diagnosis was 66.2 years old
(range, 36.3–89.5 years). There was a predominance of women
over men [n ¼ 58 (66%): n ¼ 30 (34%)]. The majority of patients
were smokers (N ¼ 50, 56.8%); 36 patients were never smokers
(40.9%), and for 2 patients the smoking status was unknown
(Table 1). Twelve patients had intrathoracic disease while the
others had metastatic disease.
ctDNA sequencing results
The median time from diagnosis to the ctDNA test results was
11.7 months (95% CI, 6.2–15.8 months; range, 0–123 months),
and the median time from the blood draw to results (turnaround
time) was 15 days (95% CI, 14–15 days; range, 8–35 days). In our
88 tested patients, a total of 257 alterations were identified, with
the majority being point mutations (n ¼ 205, 79.8%), followed
by amplifications [10.5% of alterations (27/257)]. The most
frequent alterations (all nonsynonymous alterations considered)
discerned were in the following genes: TP53 (44.3% of patients),
followed by EGFR (27.3%), MET (14.8%), KRAS (13.6%), and
ALK (6.8%; Fig. 1A and B). The majority of patients had muta-
tions;
17
demonstrated
amplification
and
3
showed
rearrangements.
Of the total, 72 patients (82%) had at least one detectable
ctDNA alteration. Among these 72 patients, 75% (N ¼ 54
patients; 61.4% of the total 88 patients) had �1 anomaly that
was potentially actionable (by FDA-approved drugs; (61.1%)
or by an experimental drug(s) in a clinical trial (if an FDA-
approved drug was not available; an additional 13.9%);
Fig. 1C). When we examined the differences between the most
frequent alterations detected in smokers versus nonsmokers,
we observed that KRAS aberrations were only detected in
smokers in our population (24% (12/50) versus 0% (0/36)
in nonsmokers, P ¼ 0.001); TP53 alterations were also more
frequent in smokers, with a statistically significant difference
when focusing on characterized alterations only (50% versus
25% in nonsmokers, P ¼ 0.026; Fig. 2). In addition, charac-
terized EGFR alterations were the most frequent alterations
found in nonsmokers (36% (13/36) versus 16% (8/50) in
smokers, P ¼ 0.043), Fig. 2).
In the 88 patients, the median number of alterations was two
(average 2.7; range, 0–21). Specifically, 19.3% of patients had one
alteration, and 62.5% had at least two alterations. In a univariable
analysis, smokers had a higher median number of alterations
(2 vs. 1.5, P ¼ 0.030), and it remained a trend in the multivariable
analysis (P ¼ 0.083). The presence of TP53 and MET alterations
was an independent predictor of a higher number of alterations
in the multivariable analysis, with P ¼ 0.002 and P ¼ 0.021,
respectively (Table 2).
There was no difference in the rate of ctDNA detection
between those patients with and without metastases. Two of
the 12 (16.%) patients with intrathoracic disease alone (no
metastases) had no alterations; 14 of the 76 patients (18%) with

identified in the following genes (albeit in one or two patients): APC, BRCA1, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, FGFR1, KIT, MAP2K1, RAF1, RHOA, ATM, CCND1, CCNE1,
CDK6, ERBB4, IDH2, JAK2, MAP2K2, MLH1, NFE2L2, NRAS, PTEN, RB1, RET, RIT1, SRC, and VHL. �Alterations of unknown significance (variant of

Only the most frequent alterations were represented (at least 10 patients with the alteration). We also included ALK for its driver role in adenocarcinoma,
even though there were less than 10 patients. Dark blue are characterized alterations, and light blue represents variants of unknown significance.

nonactionable alterations carried only variant(s) of unknown significance (VUS) and were therefore considered nonactionable by definition.

 metastatic disease had no alterations. There was also no differ-
ence in alteration detection rate between those with �1 prior
therapies versus those with >1 prior therapies, with no altera-
tions detected in about 18% of each group. ctDNA levels were
also not significantly different.
Concordance analysis
EGFR alterations. Thirty-four patients (38.6%) also had a multi-
gene panel NGS tissue testing (see Materials and Methods; ref. 21).
The median time interval between the blood draw and tissue
biopsy was 0.8 months (and hence this was used as a cut point for
discerning differences between tissue and blood based results).
The overall concordance rate for EGFR alterations was 76.5%.
(Concordance rate remained similar (75%) when EGFR tissue
testing of non-NGS types were included in the calculations). The
concordance rate was 88.2% compared with 64.7% when the time
interval was �0.8 versus >0.8 months between the blood draw
and the tissue biopsy for NGS (P ¼ 0.22; Supplementary Table S5
and Fig. 3).
We also performed this analysis excluding the patients that
had "no ctDNA alterations detected," as the absence of altera-
tions could be because no tDNA was detected in the plasma. In
those 26 patients, the median time interval between the blood
draw and tissue biopsy was 1.0 months, and the overall con-
cordance rate was 80.8% for EGFR alterations. The concordance
rate was 100% in patients for whom the time interval between
the blood draw and the tissue biopsy was �1.0 months (cor-
responding to the median) compared with 61.5% when
this time interval was >1.0 month (P ¼ 0.04; Supplementary
Table S5; Fig. 3A). Of the total, there were 7of 26 patients with
positive concordance, 14 of 26 patients with negative concor-
dance and 5 of 26 patients with discordance (2 patients were
positive for EGFR alterations in ctDNA only and 3 were positive
for EGFR alterations in tissue only).
Overall concordance. We also performed an analysis including all
the alterations in these 26 patients (we included alterations
in common in the gene panel of both the ctDNA and tissue
testing, N ¼ 62 alterations). Thirty-three alterations were found in
both tests, for a positive concordance rate of 53.2%. In total, 52
alterations were found in the tissue and 43 in the plasma, leading
to a sensitivity of 63.5% (33/52) when the tissue is used as a
comparator and 76.7% (33/43) when the plasma is used as the
comparator. Nineteen alterations were found in the tissue only
and 10 in the plasma only. In 70% of patients (18/26), we found
at least one alteration in common in their ctDNA and tissue
testing. Of interest, when we classified the alterations in the
plasma into a %ctDNA � 1% or <1%, we found that 100% of
the 21 alterations with a %ctDNA � 1% were also identified in the
tissue compared with 71.4% (10/14) for the 14 alterations with a
%ctDNA < 1%, P ¼ 0.0191 (Fisher exact test; N ¼ 8 alterations
were amplifications and were not included in this analysis). We
also found in sub-analyses that the concordance rates were higher
for the alterations tested in pretreated patients (64.7% vs. 48.9%
in posttreatment setting) and when the time difference between
the plasma and tissue biopsy was shorter (62.5% vs. 43.3%;
median of 1.3 months was used as cutoff), although these
differences were not statistically significant.
Analysis of patient outcome
Patients had a median of one prior line of therapy (range,
0–13) before ctDNA testing. Of the 88 patients, 25 (28.4%)
had an alteration in their ctDNA results that was targeted by
a matched therapy, with 20 of 25 patients (80%) receiving a
therapy directed to EGFR [n ¼ 18; activating EGFR mutations
(mostly exon 19, but also L858R in exon 21 or G719X in exon
18 for first/second-generation inhibitors; EGFR T790M for
third-generation inhibitors)] or ALK alterations (n ¼ 2; the
other targeted alterations included KIT, PDGFRA, or BRAF).

 Sixty-three patients (71.6%) did not receive a treatment that
matched their ctDNA results (including 36 patients who were
not evaluable for treatment) mainly because they died, were
lost to follow-up before ctDNA results, or were not treated yet
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
Of the 25 matched patients, all received FDA-approved drugs
(15 (60%) on-label, 5 (20%) off-label) except for the patients
(N ¼ 5) matched to EGFR T790M. These patients received osi-
mertinib, which was being used in a clinical trial at the time, but
has since been FDA approved. Twenty-two patients were evalu-
able for response (3 patients were too early to assess); 16 (72.3%)
achieved stable disease (SD) � 6 months (N ¼ 5) or partial
response (PR; N ¼ 11). In comparison, 12 of 20 (60%) of
the never matched evaluable patients (N ¼ 27 patients never
matched; 7 too early to assess) achieved SD � 6 months/PR (P ¼
0.515 for matched versus never matched).
The median PFS for the 25 matched patients was 14.7 months
[95% CI, 3.7–25.7; 15.3 months for nonsmokers vs. 8.1 months
for smokers (P ¼ 0.202; not significant)] and was longer in
patients carrying EGFR alterations versus not (medians: 17.6 vs.
5.1 months, P ¼ 0.009). Comparing matched and never matched
patients [the treatment with the longest PFS for both matched and
never-matched was chosen (prospectively or retrospectively)], the
median line of therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting was 2
(range, 1–10) for the longest PFS in matched patients versus 1
(range, 1–3) for the longest PFS in never matched patients (P ¼
0.015). [For the matched patients, the longest PFS refers to longest
PFS on matched therapy (in case the patient received more than
one regimen of matched therapy); for the never matched patients,
we chose the longest PFS on any therapy that the patient may have
received (including chemotherapy)]. The median longest PFS was
14.7 months for the matched patients (n ¼ 25) vs. 7.8 months for
the never-matched patients (n ¼ 27), with P ¼ 0.280. The median
OS was not reached for the matched patients (n ¼ 25; median
follow-up time of 18.6 months) versus 36.7 months for the never-
matched patients (n ¼ 27; P ¼ 0.928; PFS and OS survival were
calculated from the initiation date of treatment with the longest
PFS for both the matched and the never-matched groups).
EGFR T790M and third-generation EGFR inhibitors. There were
5 patients who were given a third-generation EGFR inhibitor

were tested for in both the ctDNA and tissuegene panels. Overall concordance included positive (þ) and negative (�) concordant cases, i.e., whenboth the tissue and
the ctDNA were positive or negative. aThirty-four patients had both ctDNA and a common tissue molecular test. For these 34 patients, the median time
interval between tissue biopsy to blood draw was 0.8 months. bTwenty-six patients had both ctDNA and a common tissue molecular test, and had alterations in their
ctDNA. For these 26 patients, the median time interval between tissue biopsy to blood draw was 1.0 months (we performed this analysis excluding patients
that had "no alterations detected" as it could be because no ctDNA was detected in the plasma). P values compare the percentage of overall concordance between
patients with biopsy interval time � or > median (two-sided c2 test). Alterations were examined at the gene level (i.e., no distinction in the location of alteration

 20.2 months. However, when we stratified patients who had at
least one alteration with a percentage of ctDNA detected of �5%
(representing 10 times the median percentage of ctDNA), we
found that patients with a percentage of ctDNA � 5% had a
shorter overall survival (median 4.2 months vs. not reached at a
median follow-up of 21.6 months for those patients with ctDNA <
5%, P ¼ 0.012; Fig. 4).
Discussion
In this study investigating the use of liquid biopsies in 88
patients with lung adenocarcinoma, we show that the most
frequent alterations detected were in TP53 (44.3% of patients),
EGFR (27.3%), MET (14.8%), KRAS (13.6%), and ALK (6.8%)
genes. In comparison, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed
similar rates of tissue alterations of 46% (TP53), 17% (EGFR),
12% (MET), 36% (KRAS), and 8% (ALK; ref. 22). For the EGFR
and KRAS genes, the rates differed between the ctDNA and TCGA
tissue. The reasons for the variance could be related to the fact that
TCGA was performed on untreated patients, while our population
was previously treated (22, 23). Further, resistance mutations
such as EGFR (T790M) or KRAS emerge after matched therapy and
would be less likely to be present in the TCGA cohort. Other
reasons for these differences could include, but not be limited to,
factors related to tumor heterogeneity and the propensity of
tumor DNA to shed into the blood, as well as the fact that the
local area has a relatively high Asian population and low smoking
rates. We also observed that KRAS alterations were only found in
smokers (24% vs. 0%, P ¼ 0.001) and that characterized EGFR
alterations were more common in nonsmokers (36% vs. 16%, P ¼
0.04), consistent with what was previously described in analyses
performed on tissue (24, 25).
Overall, 82% of patients had at least one detectable alteration
(s), and for 75% of them (61.4% of the total 88 patients), the
alterations were potentially actionable by an FDA-approved drug
or an experimental agent in a clinical trial. This actionability rate is
within the same range of the results of our prior study that
detected alterations in the plasma of patients with diverse cancer
types (17).
We also examined the concordance rate of EGFR alterations
for patients who had both ctDNA and multigene panel NGS
tissue testing (21). The concordance rates were in the same
range (61.5%–100%; Supplementary Table S5) of those pre-
viously reported (about 67% to 99%; refs. 22–24). Further, we
observed that the concordance rate was increased when the
time interval between the blood draw and the tissue biopsy
was shorter, which can be explained by the dynamic changes
occurring in the tumor, especially when the patient is receiving
treatment (26–30). Of interest, a focused analysis on the
positive cases (Fig. 3B) revealed that both tests could indepen-
dently detect alterations not found in the other test, highlight-
ing the clinical value and complementary nature of both
techniques.
The overall analysis of the concordance, including all altera-
tions potentially detectable by both tests, also showed that some
alterations were found in tissue or ctDNA only and resulted in a
specificity of 63.5% when the tissue was used as a reference and
76.7% when the plasma was used as a reference. In order to
observe more accurate concordance rates, the comparison of
tissue and plasma results should include samples temporally
concurrent and pretreatment so that ctDNA is not suppressed to
undetectable levels, and only the genetic footprint in common
between the two tests can be compared. Several publications
meet these study design criteria (two pan-cancer, one each in
NSCLC, breast, colorectal, anaplastic thyroid and pancreatic
cancer) and all show high diagnostic concordance for concur-
rent samples (99%, 86%, 100%, 100%, 100%, 72%, and 98%,
respectively; refs. 17, 27, 29, 31–34). Reasons that results might
be positive in tissue but not in ctDNA include the following:
suppression of ctDNA shedding by treatment; and the fact that
not all tumors shed DNA into the bloodstream even pretreat-
ment or at progression. On the other hand, ctDNA may be

 positive when tissue is not because ctDNA reflects shed DNA
from multiple metastases whereas a biopsy typically samples a
single lesion. Furthermore, gene mutations acquired under
treatment pressure may not be found in archival tissue (tempo-
ral separation). There may also be technical differences between
the tests. Considering the distinct advantages and disadvantages
of each technique may therefore be pertinent in the clinical
setting. Tissue biopsies are critical in the first line to define
histopathologic cancer diagnosis and genotyping both, and at
progression, especially when ctDNA is negative. Conversely,
ctDNA may be useful at progression to reduce the need for
repeat biopsies.
Some genomic alterations found in ctDNA may not be found in
sequenced tissue samples because of tumor heterogeneity or
because the plasma sequencing method is more sensitive and
will pick up mutations at lower allele fractions than with tissue
NGS. In Goyal and colleagues (35) five FGFR2 resistance muta-
tions were found in a cholangiocarcinoma patient on targeted
FGFR2 therapy, but only one was detected on liver biopsy. At
warm autopsy, three of the five ctDNA-detected FGFR2 mutations
were confirmed in tissue and all five were found to drive resistance
on functional modeling (35). In Rozenblum and colleagues (36),
ctDNA NGS changed treatment in 32% of patients negative for
NSCLC genomic targets via local tissue-based EGFR qPCR and
ALK FISH testing, including two EGFR driver mutations not
detected in tissue (36). Of interest in this regard, it has previously
been shown that matched therapy based on ctDNA findings of
EGFR L858R, exon 19 deletion, and T790M produced responses
similar to those based on tissue biopsy-based assays, even in cases
when ctDNA was positive and tissue was wild-type for the EGFR
mutation (37–39). In our study, we found that all ctDNA-detected
EGFR T790M alterations were confirmed (100%) in correspond-
ing tissue.
One goal of our study was to investigate the outcome of
patients with lung adenocarcinoma who were treated (either
prospectively or retrospectively) with a therapy matching alter-
ation(s) detected in their ctDNA test. At the time of our analysis,
25 patients (28.4%) received a matched therapy consistent with
their ctDNA results. When considering only patients carrying
EGFR characterized mutations (N ¼ 19/88), 95% (18/19)
received matched therapy. Seventy-three percent (16/22 patients
evaluable for response) of matched patients achieved SD � 6
months/PR. Response correlated with PFS, as the 16 patients with
SD � 6 months/PR had a significantly prolonged median PFS as
compared with nonresponders (17.6 months vs. only 1.8 months,
P < 0.0001). Other studies have described the benefit of matching
patients using a biomarker. Indeed, three recent meta-analyses
looking at trials leading to FDA approval (40), phase II studies
(41) and phase I studies (42) concluded that the strategy of
selecting patients with a biomarker led to improved response
rates, longer PFS and OS. In addition, our previous retrospective
analysis performed on more than 300 patients with various
malignancies and using NGS tissue testing revealed that the
strategy of matching patients led to increased rates of SD � 6
months/PR/CR and longer PFS (43).
In our population, we found that 37.5% of patients with
EGFR alterations (9/24) carried the EGFR T790M resistance
mutation, consistent with previous reports (34, 35, 42). Not
surprisingly, these 9 patients had previously been treated with
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The initial detection of EGFR
alterations in patients with lung adenocarcinoma as well as
the monitoring during treatment for the appearance of resis-
tance mutations may be an important application of liquid
biopsies. This is particularly true because obtaining serial
tissue samples post EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors is chal-
lenging in clinical practice due to the invasiveness of the
procedure and the frailty of patients with metastatic disease.
In addition, tissue biopsies may not reflect tumor heteroge-
neity if multiple metastatic sites are involved. Indeed, in our
study, 25 of 88 patients (28.4%) only had ctDNA results
available (no other molecular tissue testing), with the most
common reasons being inadequate tissue and/or the potential
risk for repeat biopsy.
Several studies have monitored EGFR alterations in the
plasma of patients with NSCLC during their disease course
(12, 44–48). For instance, Zheng and colleagues (44) examined
318 patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC who were
receiving a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and focused on the 117
patients who acquired resistance. EGFR T790M ctDNA was
detected in the plasma of 55 of 117 patients (47%). In addition,
they showed that almost half of the T790M ctDNA-positive
patients were identified at a median time of 2.2 months prior to
clinically progressive disease (PD). Similarly, Sueoka-Aragane
and colleagues (45) looked at sequential examinations in 89
patients with NSCLC. They detected EGFR T790M in 40% of
patients who developed progressive disease after treatment
with a kinase inhibitor. These studies highlight the feasibility
of monitoring EGFR mutation dynamics in serial plasma sam-
ples from NSCLC patients receiving TKI therapy.
Matched versus never-matched patients had higher rates of
SD � 6 months/PR (72.3% vs. 60%; N ¼ 22 vs. 20 evaluable)
and longer median PFS (14.7 vs. 7.8 months; N ¼ 25 vs. 27
evaluable), although the differences were not statistically sig-
nificant, perhaps due to the limited number of patients. Inter-
estingly, there were five patients whose ctDNA demonstrated
the EGFR T790M resistance mutation who were then given a
third-generation EGFR inhibitor, and all five achieved SD � 6
months (N ¼ 3)/PR (N ¼ 2).
Lastly, our study demonstrated that patients with at least one
alteration with a percentage of ctDNA � 5% had a shorter overall
survival (median 4.2 months versus not reached at a median
follow-up of 7.5 months, P ¼ 0.012; Fig. 4), consistent with a prior
study performed on diverse cancer types (48) and various other
studies describing the prognostic value of ctDNA, including in
patients with lung cancer (33, 46–49).
Our study had several limitations. First, because of its retro-
spective and single center nature and small number of patients,
there could be unknown biases that influenced our analysis. In
addition, some of our patients did not have concurrent tissue
and ctDNA biopsies, and the ctDNA test and tissue NGS are two
different techniques each having its own advantages and dis-
advantages. On the other hand, the range of intervals between
tissue and ctDNA tests allowed us to investigate the influence of
time interval between the tissue biopsy and ctDNA test and to
observe that a shorter time interval between these tests resulted
in increased concordance rates. In future studies, it will be
important to examine larger, well-timed cohorts for concordance
in a wide range of genes. Another limitation was that a subset of
patients (N ¼ 16) did not have detectable ctDNA. It is plausible
that some tumors do not shed ctDNA. However, it is also
conceivable that improvements in technology will eventually
prove able to detect ctDNA in such patients. Alternative

 techniques such as those that evaluate circulating tumor cells
could also be assessed. Finally, response assessment in our study
was performed by individual physicians rather than by central-
ized standardized review. Overall, larger prospective studies are
needed to further define the value of ctDNA tests to inform
treatment and their use as a tissue surrogate.
In summary, our study reveals the frequent detection of
altered ctDNA in patients with NSCLC adenocarcinoma,
including in difficult-to-biopsy patients. The concordance rate
for EGFR alterations was 80.8% [100% vs. 61.5% (�1 vs. >1
month between tests; P ¼ 0.04)]. This confirms and strengthens
the findings of Thompson and colleagues (29) who showed
EGFR concordance rates of 79%, with a shorter time interval
between tissue and blood collection associated with increased
concordance (P ¼ 0.038). Patients who received cognate ther-
apies demonstrated a high rate of SD � 6 months/PR. Indeed,
all five patients with EGFR T790M resistance mutation detected
in ctDNA and then treated with a third generation EGFR
inhibitor achieved SD � 6 months/PR. Importantly, high levels
of ctDNA (�5%) predicted for poor survival, suggesting clinical
utility for ctDNA tests. It appears that several groups of patients
could benefit from ctDNA evaluation, including those with
hard-to-biopsy lesions, those whose biopsy tissue is exhausted
for histopathology or immunohistochemistry testing, or those
patients who had non-NGS tissue testing and no actionable
alterations were detected (49). In addition, there are patients in
whom serial monitoring for emergence of resistance mutations
might be important (e.g., patients with EGFR mutations or ALK
fusions who are treated with first-generation EGFR or ALK
inhibitors, respectively). However, when ctDNA results in no
alterations detected, a tissue biopsy would be recommended as
some tumors may not shed sufficient DNA into circulation to
be detectable. Further prospective validation of an approach
that uses ctDNA to guide management and assesses the cost:
benefit ratio of serial testing is warranted.
