Volunteering and health benefits in general
adults: cumulative effects and forms
Jerf W. K. Yeung*, Zhuoni Zhang and Tae Yeun Kim
Abstract
Background: Although the health benefits of volunteering have been well documented, no research has examined
its cumulative effects according to other-oriented and self-oriented volunteering on multiple health outcomes in
the general adult public. This study examined other-oriented and self-oriented volunteering in cumulative
contribution to health outcomes (mental and physical health, life satisfaction, social well-being and depression).
Methods: Data were drawn from the Survey of Texas Adults 2004, which contains a statewide population-based
sample of adults (n = 1504). Multivariate linear regression and Wald test of parameters equivalence constraint were
used to test the relationships.
Results: Both forms of volunteering were significantly related to better health outcomes (odds ratios = 3.66% to 11.11%),
except the effect of self-oriented volunteering on depression. Other-oriented volunteering was found to have better
health benefits than did self-volunteering.
Conclusion: Volunteering should be promoted by public health, education and policy practitioners as a kind of healthy
lifestyle, especially for the social subgroups of elders, ethnic minorities, those with little education, single people, and
unemployed people, who generally have poorer health and less participation in volunteering.
Keywords: Other-oriented volunteering, Self-oriented volunteering, Cumulative effects, Health outcomes
Background
The beneficial effects of volunteering on health out-
comes have been well documented. Research has found
that participation in voluntary services is significantly
predictive of better mental and physical health [1, 2], life
satisfaction [3], self-esteem [3, 4], happiness [5, 6], lower
depressive symptoms [4, 7], psychological distress [3, 8],
and mortality and functional inability [8, 9]. As proved
recently, the health benefits of volunteering are not due
to self-selection bias. Recent longitudinal research did
not support reverse causation, in which volunteering
was significantly related to better health prospectively,
and the reverse was not true [2].
What remains uncharted for the relationship between
volunteering
and
health
outcomes
is
pertinent
to
whether volunteering may have cumulative effects on
health and what form of volunteering is preferable for
promoting health benefits for volunteers [1, 7, 9].
Regarding the volunteering and health connection, the
role accumulation perspective supports the position that
a volunteer who concomitantly participates in different
types of voluntary services can benefit his or her health
most [2, 4, 5, 8]. The rationale is that role-related social
privileges, resources, supportive network, coping skills,
life meaning and gratitude accumulated through assum-
ing multiple prosocial roles can be directly conducive to
various health outcomes. In contrast, the scarcity thesis
argues that simultaneous occupation of multiple roles
would result in conflict and strain, which would com-
promise health [2, 4]. Therefore, it is worth investigating
whether participation in multiple voluntary services con-
temporaneously, that is, the cumulative effects, would
contribute to better health outcomes in the general pub-
lic according to the relationship between volunteering
and health.
This study is drawn from the meaning-fulfilling per-
spective that volunteering in general, by its prosocial
and meaning-making nature, would positively contribute
to health benefits [2, 10, 11]. However, different forms of

 volunteering are believed to have differential effects on
health benefits [10–12]. Recent philanthropic research
reports that the form of other-oriented volunteering has
better health effects than does self-oriented volunteering
in elderly people or in convenience samples [10, 11].
This is congruous with the meaning-fulfilling perspective
with regard to the subtly different meaning-making pro-
cesses that the two forms of volunteering engender.
Other-oriented volunteering refers to helping others in
need mainly by altruistic responsibilities and humanitar-
ian concerns [2, 11]. These concerns can more effect-
ively help accrue genuine supportive relationships and
social integration, self-worth, a sense of mattering, and
life meaning and therefore better contribute to health
benefits [2, 11]. Self-oriented volunteering means the
stress of volunteers on the reciprocity of volunteering,
or volunteering affordance expressed by some scholars,
that is, to seek benefits and enhance the volunteers
themselves in return. Examples include strengthened so-
cial network and ties, understanding of self, acquisition
of new skills, and career development [10–12]. In fact,
such self-enhancing volunteerism is less effective in ac-
cruing meaningful and health-promoting benefits, e.g.
supportive relationships and a sense of mattering, in the
process of volunteering compared to other-oriented
volunteering [2, 3, 11]. Thus, it is worth investigating
whether the forms of other-oriented and self-oriented
volunteering have different cumulative effects on health
outcomes.
The current study aimed to investigate the cumulative
effects of other-oriented and self-oriented volunteering,
formed by participation in multiple pertinent voluntary
services contemporaneously, on the health outcomes of
perceived mental and physical health, life satisfaction,
depression, and social well-being in a population-based
sample of general adults. In addition, this study com-
pared whether other-oriented volunteering has stronger
health effects than does self-oriented volunteering.
Methods
Data and sample
The data used in this study were based on the Survey of
Texas Adults 2004, which contains a statewide represen-
tative sample of 1504 community-dwelling adults aged
18 and over in Texas [13]. The sampling procedure was
based on a modified random digit dialing design. A
household-level
cooperation
rate
of
37%
and
a
respondent-level cooperation rate of 89% were obtained
in the data-collection process. The survey was mainly
conducted in English. Translation of survey instruments
into Spanish and administration by a Spanish-speaking
interviewer were applied when needed. Each computer-
assisted telephone interview lasted about 30–35 min.
Due to the overrepresentation of women, older adults,
non-Hispanic Whites, and highly educated respondents
in the original sample, the data were weighted to match
the characteristics of the sample to the 2000 Texas
population census estimates.
The Survey
of
Texas
Adults 2004 provided fruitful information on people’s
participation in various types of voluntary services and
health outcomes. Detailed socio-demographic data avail-
able in the survey can help adjust for confounding from
the
relevant background
characteristics.
The socio-
demographic variables included in this study are gender,
age, race/ethnicity, education, citizenship, marital status,
number of children at home, employment status and
family income. These background characteristics have
been found influential on both volunteering and health
outcomes in past research [1–3, 5, 9, 14].
Measures
All measures employed for analysis in this study were
self-reported by the adult participants. The information
about these measures was mainly drawn from the sec-
tions of volunteering, physical health, mental health and
demographic characteristics in the survey.
Health outcomes
Mental health
In the Survey of Texas Adults 2004, a question was used
to measure the mental health of the adult participants:
“Overall, how would you rate your mental health at the
present time? Would you say it is excellent, very good,
good, fair, or poor?” The ratings are based on a 5-point
scale (1 = excellent, 2 = very good, 3 = good, 4 = fair,
and 5 = poor). For easy interpretation, the scale was re-
versely coded, meaning that higher scores represent bet-
ter mental health.
Physical health
The adult participants in the survey were asked to re-
spond to the question: “How would you rate your phys-
ical health at the present time? Would you say it is
excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” The answers
were used as a general indicator of physical health. The
responses are also based on 5-point scale from 1 = excel-
lent to 5 = poor. Again for better interpretation, the
scale was reversely coded to indicate that higher scores
represent better physical health.
Life satisfaction
The survey question used to rate participants’ levels of
life satisfaction was: “How satisfied you are with your life
overall?” The question was rated on a 4-point scale
(1 = very satisfied, 2 = somewhat satisfied, 3 = not too
satisfied, and 4 = not at all satisfied). The scale was re-
versely recoded, meaning that higher scores indicate bet-
ter life satisfaction.

 Depression
Five question items in the survey were used to measure
participants’ depression in the past 30 days: “feeling
sad”, “feeling hopeless”, “feeling everything was an ef-
fort”, “feeling worthless” and “had trouble breathing”.
These items have been used to indicate depressive symp-
toms in prior research [7, 15]. They were rated on a 5-
point scale from never (1) to several times a day (5), and
a composite score was gathered by summing up the
items. Cronbach’s α was .739 in this study.
Social well-being
Two question items in the survey were used to measure
social well-being: “I am lacking companionship” and “I
feel isolated from others”. These items are indicative of
social integration and social acceptance and satisfaction
about relationships with others [16, 17], which has been
found influential on health [16]. The items were rated
from strongly agree (1) to strongly disagree (5). The
items were summed up to form a composite score.
Higher scores imply better social well-being. Cronbach’s
α was .717.
Volunteering
Other-oriented volunteering
Recent philanthropic research indicates that volunteers
simultaneously engage in various types of voluntary ser-
vices; therefore, simply dichotomizing participants into
volunteers and non-volunteers is inadequate [7, 14]. In
this study, volunteering is classified into the two broad
forms of other-oriented and self-oriented volunteering.
Prior research indicates that volunteers of other-oriented
motivation were more likely to volunteer in health, so-
cial, religious and other philanthropic services [11].
Hence, other-oriented volunteering was measured by
summing up participation in the past 12 months in the
voluntary services of health, education, religious groups,
human services, public/social benefits, and youth devel-
opment. In fact, these voluntary services explicitly bear
other-regarding and altruistic features that, by their
nature, show concern and care for the needs of others
[2, 11]. The scores of this volunteering form range from
0 to 6, higher scores indicative of more participation in
other-oriented volunteering.
Self-oriented volunteering
In this study, participation in the voluntary services of
recreation, arts or culture, environment or animal wel-
fare, work-related service, political campaign or move-
ment, and other service simultaneously in the past
12 months was summed up to form self-oriented volun-
teering, the types of voluntary services bearing features
of self-actualization and development or self-serving
[10–12]. Concordantly, prior research has reported that
volunteers of self-oriented motivation were fond of
volunteering in culture/recreation, environment, law/
politics, and business or professional services [11]. Par-
ticipation in these voluntary services shows that those
who volunteer may actually emphasize reciprocation of
volunteering to benefit and enhance themselves, e.g. in-
creased social network and ties, understanding of self,
evasion of personal problems, acquisition of new skills,
and career development [2, 11, 12]. The scores of this
form of volunteering also range from 0 to 6, higher
scores indicative of more participation in self-oriented
volunteering.
Control variables
The socio-demographic variables adjusted in this study
include gender (1 = female, 0 = male), age in years, race/
ethnicity,
education
(1
=
none,
2
=
high
school,
3 = GED, 4 = associates degree, 5 = bachelor’s degree,
6 = graduate degree, 7 = doctorate), citizenship (1 = US
citizen, 0 = other), marital status (1 = currently married,
0 = other), number of children at home, annual family
income (1 = $0 to $14,999, 2 = $15,000 to $34,999,
3 = $35,000 to
$49,999,
4 = 50,000 to
$64,999,
5 = $65,000 to $84,999, and 6 = $85,000 or more), and
employment status (1 = employed, 0 = other). Three
dummy variables were constructed for race/ethnicity, in
which
African
American
(Black),
Hispanic/Mexican
American, and other races or ethnicities were the con-
trast groups, and non-Hispanic White was the reference
category. Number of children was coded 0 to 4 or more
children. As family income has the missing values of
34.9%, Expectation Maximization Imputation (EM) was
used to replace the missing values rather than mean sub-
stitution, which was applied in previous relevant re-
search [18]. Mean substitution will bias the mean
distribution and restrict variance. EM, however, may set
off these problems by using a two-step iterative process
that involves regression analysis and maximum likeli-
hood procedures to allow all available pertinent variables
as predictors for imputing missing data [19]. A dummy
variable was created to indicate whether the participant
had missing information on income (1 = missing,
0 = other), to preclude confounding.
Statistical analyses
Due to the multi-correlated nature of the health out-
comes, the current study employed multivariate linear
regression to analyze the results.1 This modeling approach
has the advantage of reducing multi-collinearity and prob-
lems of Type I errors when there are significant correla-
tions among the outcome variables [22]. Then, all five
health outcomes are concurrently regressed on the predic-
tors of volunteering and pertinent socio-demographic co-
variates. For easy interpretation of the regression results,
Yeung et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:8 
Page 3 of 8
 the predictors of volunteering and socio-demographic co-
variates were standardized into z-scores, so it is possible
to calculate percentages increased in the health outcomes
by one unit increase in volunteering (e.g. additional par-
ticipation in the voluntary services) through likelihood ra-
tio= eβ − 1. In addition, the Wald test of parameters
equivalence constraint was used to ascertain whether
other-oriented volunteering had stronger health effects
than
did
self-oriented
volunteering.
The
statistical
analyses were performed by Mplus 7.11.
Results
Table 1 presents the correlations of the five health out-
comes and the predictors of other-oriented and self-
oriented volunteering. Mental and physical health, life
satisfaction and social well-being were significantly and
positively correlated with each other, rs = .247 to .369,
ps < .001, and they were significantly and negatively cor-
related with depression, rs = −.334 to −.491, ps < .01.
The
predictors
of
other-oriented
and
self-oriented
volunteering were significantly correlated with the five
health outcomes.
Table 2 presents the results of multivariate linear re-
gression of other-oriented volunteering on the five
health outcomes. Results showed that other-oriented
volunteering was significantly predictive of better mental
health, β = .082, physical health, β = .087, life satisfac-
tion, β = .071, and social well-being, β = .106, ps < .01,
as well as fewer depressive symptoms, β = −.044, p < .05.
The results were held even accounting for multiple
pertinent socio-demographic variables. Likelihood ratio
estimates found that additional participation in voluntary
services in the form of other-oriented volunteering re-
sulted in an 8.54% increase in mental health, 9.08% in
physical health, 7.35% in life satisfaction, and 11.11% in
social well-being, as well as 4.30% decrease in depres-
sion, giving evidence that higher participation in volun-
tary services pertinent to other-oriented volunteering
contributes to better health benefits cumulatively.
Moreover, self-oriented volunteering was significantly
predictive of better mental health, β = .063, physical
health, β = .069, life satisfaction, β = .036, and social
well-being, β = .053, ps < .05, but did not significantly
predict depressive symptoms, β = −.021, p > .05 (Table
3). Likelihood ratio estimates showed that additional
participation in voluntary services in the form of self-
oriented volunteering resulted in a 6.50% increase in
mental health, 7.14% in physical health, 3.66% increase
in life satisfaction, and 5.44% increase in social well-
being, also giving evidence to the cumulative effects of
self-oriented volunteering on health benefits.
The Wald test of parameters equivalence constraint
was performed to examine whether the effects of other-
oriented and self-oriented volunteering on health out-
comes were significantly different. The predictors of
other-oriented and self-oriented volunteering were first
put into two regression equations separately while
retaining all the socio-demographic covariates in the
multivariate linear regression models intact. Then, the
two regression equations were simultaneously pooled in
a single comparison model and the parameters of other-
oriented and self-oriented volunteering were set to be
equivalent (βother-oriented = βself-oriented). Results showed
that other-oriented volunteering had significantly stron-
ger effects on the health outcomes of mental and phys-
ical health, life satisfaction, and social well-being than
did self-oriented volunteering (Table 4), but they did not
differ in the effect on depression. The strongest different
effect was for social well-being (difference in betas), then
life satisfaction, and mental and physical health. The
beta differences range from .053 to.018.
Discussion
The present study investigated the cumulative effects of
other- and self-oriented volunteering on various health
outcomes in a population-based sample of general
adults, a previously uncharted research topic. Results
confirmed that volunteering, regardless of the form being
examined, had significant health effects. Past pertinent

 research investigating the volunteering and health connec-
tion mainly focused on a subpopulation of people, e.g. eld-
erly people, or disregarded the interrelated relationships
between the health outcomes, hence compromising exter-
nal validity and accuracy of the results [7–9]. Results of
this study add evidence to the literature that volunteering
engenders health benefits across various health outcomes
in a cumulative way by participation in several voluntary
services contemporaneously in the general adult public.
Consistent with prior research, the present study supports
the beneficial effects of volunteering on mental and phys-
ical health, life satisfaction, social well-being and depres-
sion. However, despite the cumulative health effects of
volunteering across various health outcomes found in this
study, the magnitude of these health effects did vary. Most
notable are the strongest effect of other-oriented volun-
teering on social well-being and the strongest effect of
self-oriented volunteering on physical health, which reveal
the different nature of these two forms of volunteering.
Other-oriented volunteering is more other-regarding, al-
truistic and humanitarian-concerned than is self-oriented
volunteering; the latter is more self-enhancing and self-
actualizing [10, 11]. Thus, more trustworthy interpersonal
relationships, a supportive network, a sense of mattering
and life meaning are expected for other-oriented volun-
teering rather than self-oriented volunteering. In contrast,
self-oriented volunteering may involve more physical, cul-
tural and career activities that may maximize the physical
health of volunteers. However, these postulates do not
negate the also robust positive effect of other-oriented
volunteering on physical health, and the above explana-
tions are tentative. Hence, more research is needed.
In addition, the Wald test of the parameters equiva-
lence constraint supports the stronger health effects of
other-oriented volunteering rather than of self-oriented
volunteering, indicating that serving others out of sheer
altruism, genuineness and humanitarian concern is im-
portant in reaping better health. The serving process of
other-oriented volunteering stresses unselfishness, shar-
ing, other-directedness, and generosity, which are coun-
teractive to the ego-centric and self-serving culture that is
upheld nowadays and may harm mental and behavioural
health [23]. In fact, some personal intrinsic motives, e.g.
narcissism and self-preoccupation, may lead to health-
compromising behaviour and then detriment to health
[23, 24]. Recent mental health research supports the im-
portance of some virtues, e.g. generosity and gratitude, in
relation to health [25, 26]. Therefore, it is plausible that
the health effects of other-oriented volunteering are sig-
nificantly stronger than those of self-oriented volunteering
found in this study (Table 4). In addition, this difference in
intrinsic motives between other-oriented and self-oriented
volunteering helps explain why the former can alleviate
depression but the latter does not, as self-preoccupation
and pursuits are etiologic of depression [24].
However, when comparing the effects of other-oriented
and self-oriented volunteering on depression, the Wald
test did not find a significant difference between the two
forms of volunteering. This corresponds to the eudaimo-
nic theory of well-being and past research results of
volunteering effects on positive and negative affect [8, 27].
These results indicate that engaging in meaningful and
prosocial behaviours, e.g. volunteering, may effectively en-
hance positive emotions but may be less efficacious in re-
ducing negative affect or mental distress. This may be due
to volunteering that, regardless of the form, is not a direct
problem-solving strategy to tackle and resolve negative
affect, that is, caused by a specific life situation such as
traumatic events and experiences. Hence, the weakest sig-
nificant effect of other-oriented volunteering, β = −.044,
p < .05, and the weakest and insignificant effect of self-
oriented volunteering on depression, β = −.021, p > .05,
are evident in this study. Thus, it is comprehensible to
have an insignificant difference when comparing the ef-
fects of the two forms of volunteering on depression.
Nevertheless, future research should put a lens on

 different health effects of volunteering on the positive and
negative side of health outcomes.
Recent research studies have reported that other-
oriented volunteers tend to be more involved, satisfied and
persistent in their volunteering work than are self-oriented
volunteers [11, 28]. Therefore, when promoting the health
effects of volunteerism, health professionals, educators and
policymakers should note the importance of volunteers of
different orientations in influencing the sustainability and
provision of services. In fact, a better matching strategy is
needed for the alignment of appropriate types of voluntary
services to volunteers of different orientations [28, 29]. As
the results of better health benefits by other-oriented
volunteering obtained from this investigation and other
pertinent studies show [2, 11, 29], related parties and orga-
nizations should highlight the health benefits of serving
others in need with altruistic attitudes and humanitarian
concerns and promote an other-regarding culture of vol-
unteerism. Table 1 shows a significant correlation between
other-oriented and self-oriented volunteering, implying
that some volunteers may cut across and simultaneously
participate in other- and self-oriented forms of voluntary
services. Hence, future research should explore if this
mixed form of volunteering might result in comparatively
better health benefits than other forms might.
In this study, the adult participants who were older,
non-White, had less education, were unmarried, and un-
employed had poorer health outcomes across both the
other-oriented and the self-oriented volunteering regres-
sion models. In fact, people with these background char-
acteristics also tend to volunteer less [3, 7, 14], which
would occasion a twofold effect on their health risks.
Hence, promoting volunteering opportunities to these
people can be a way of keeping them healthy.
Conclusion
Public health, education and policy practitioners are ad-
vised to encourage volunteering as a kind of healthy life-
style among the general public, especially in the form of
other-oriented volunteering. They should have social ser-
vice professionals promote a culture of volunteerism
among underprivileged social groups, e.g. elderly people,
ethnic minorities, lower-educated people, unmarried and
unemployed people. Although there has been a changing
trend toward episodic and self-oriented volunteering in re-
cent years [11, 27, 28], highlighting the better health ef-
fects of other-oriented volunteering and promoting the
basic altruistic and other-regarding nature of volunteerism
should be noted for the related practitioners. However, the
present study has certain limitations. First, cross-sectional
data make causality of the relationships impossible. Sec-
ond, self-reported health outcomes are less favourable
than are the objectively diagnosed health outcomes. Third,
broad classification of participation in various types of
voluntary services into other- and self-oriented volunteer-
ing based on secondary data is less adequate than are
first-hand data, which can more effectively help clarify the
nature of voluntary services for classification purposes.
Hence, it is necessary to be aware of the limitations of the
classification approach based on the secondary data used
in this study. Lastly, neither the present investigation nor
most prior studies have explored possible mediators that
link the relationship between volunteering and health,
which is important for comprehension of the mechanisms
that volunteering engenders on health benefits. Therefore,
future studies should address these limitations and pro-
vide a more comprehensive picture of the health benefits
of volunteering.

1Three of the five health outcome variables were mea-
sured by a single question item with a 4-point or a 5-
point scale, and some researchers believe this type of
outcome should be treated as ordered categorical vari-
ables. Therefore, we re-ran the data with Probit regres-
sion models. Results showed that the standardized
coefficients of Probit regression models were similar to
the findings obtained from multivariate linear regression
models. In fact, statisticians have argued that when a
dependent variable is measured by 4-point or 5-point
rank-ordered categories, there would be little difference
between the results obtained from ordinal regression
and OLS regression [20, 21]. When an outcome is mea-
sured by an ordered categorical scale, e.g. “Overall, how
would you rate your mental health at the present time?
Would you say it is excellent, very good, good, fair, or
poor?” on a 5-point scale (1 = excellent, 2 = very good,
3 = good, 4 = fair, and 5 = poor), a latent continuous
variable, y*, ranging from -∞ to ∞ is denoted. For meas-
urement purposes this is, mapped to an observed vari-
able y. Hence, the above ordinal outcome as an example
is in principle related to a continuous, latent variable y*
in indicating a person’s level of mental health by cat-
egory, ranging from “excellent” to “poor”. Therefore, the
observed y is related to y* in an equation of “yi = m if
τm-1 ≤ yi
* <τm for m = 1 to Ј”. For easier interpretation,
the present study opted for the results of multivariate
linear regression models. Readers can contact the first
author to obtain the results from Probit regression
models for reference.
