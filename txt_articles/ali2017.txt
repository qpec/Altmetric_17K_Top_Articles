IMPORTANCE Idiopathic macular holes (MHs) are a cause of decreased vision among older
Americans. A better understanding of risk factors for MH may help clarify the
pathophysiologic factors of MH and identify potential new avenues for preventing and
treating idiopathic MHs.
OBJECTIVE To determine the incidence of and risk factors associated with the development
of idiopathic MH requiring surgical repair with vitrectomy among a large group of managed
care plan beneficiaries throughout the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective, longitudinal cohort study was
conducted of all beneficiaries 40 years or older who were continuously enrolled for 3 or more
years in a nationwide US managed care network between January 1, 2001, and December 31,
2012, who had 2 or more visits to an eye care professional. The managed care network was
queried starting in 2009, and data analysis was conducted from December 1, 2014, to August
15, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Development of idiopathic MH requiring surgical repair
with vitrectomy.
RESULTS Of the 659 347 enrollees who met inclusion criteria (391 674 females and 267 683
males; mean [SD] age, 56.2 [9.2] years), 144 (0.02%) developed an MH requiring vitrectomy.
After adjusting for confounding factors, females had a 64% increased risk of developing MH
compared with males (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.11-2.43; P = .01), with the effect
of sex varying across ages. Compared with white participants, Asian-American enrollees had a
177% increased risk of developing an MH (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.27-6.02;
P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this large cohort, sex was confirmed to be associated with
developing an MH requiring vitrectomy; the effect varies across ages differently for females
vs males. These differences may be the basis for the underlying pathophysiologic factors of
the development of MH.

M
acular hole (MH) is a reversible cause of decreased
vision among older Americans. As such, MH can
greatly reduce health-related quality of life.1 A bet-
ter understanding of risk factors for MH may help better clarify
the pathophysiologic factors of this condition and identify po-
tential new avenues for preventing and treating MHs.
After adjusting for age and sex, it is estimated that 7.8 per
100 000 persons per year are newly diagnosed with an MH.2
Prior reports have found that 80% of cases are unilateral, while
two-thirds of patients are women.3 Although female sex is a
well-established risk factor,4 additional risk factors for devel-
opingMHsarenotknown.5Population-basedstudieshavebeen
limited in size, with the largest study, to our knowledge, re-
porting on only 100 persons who developed an MH.2 More-
over, prior studies have been limited regionally to areas of rela-
tive racial homogeneity.2,6-8 The only study, to our knowledge,
to estimate the incidence of MH was performed from 1992 to
2002 and identified patients with MH based on results of clini-
cal examination without the use of optical coherence
tomography.2
This study uses health care claims data from a cohort of
more than 2 million enrollees in a large managed care net-
work throughout the United States who were followed up lon-
gitudinally from 2001 to 2012 to study the incidence of and
relevant risk factors for MH. These analyses will help confirm
previous reports and expand upon earlier work by using a large
sample size to assess sociodemographic factors and ocular and
nonocular conditions as potential risk factors.
Methods
Data Source
The Clinformatics DataMart database (OptumInsight) con-
tains detailed health care claims data for all beneficiaries in a
large US managed care nationwide network. This data set con-
tains all individuals with 1 or more International Classification
ofDiseases,9thRevision,ClinicalModification(ICD-9-CM)codes
for eye-related diagnoses (360-379.9); 1 or more Current Proce-
dural Terminology (CPT) codes for eye-related visits, diagnos-
tic, or therapeutic procedures (65091-68899 or 92002-
92499); or any other claim submitted by an ophthalmologist or
optometrist from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2012. The
database includes claims for all ocular and nonocular condi-
tions along with sociodemographic information on each en-
rollee, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational level, and
estimated household net worth. This database has been vali-
dated for studying patients with ocular diseases.9-11
Participants and Sample Selection
Individuals were included in the analysis if they met the fol-
lowing criteria: 40 years or older, continuous enrollment in the
medical plan, enrollment for at least 3 years, and 2 or more vis-
its to an ophthalmologist or optometrist. We excluded per-
sons younger than 40 years because prior large population-
based studies have reported that MH is rare in persons of
younger ages.2,12,13 Individuals were also excluded if they re-
ceived a diagnosis of MH during the first 3 years they were en-
rolled in the plan, to exclude those who may have had the con-
dition before plan entry (nonincident cases). Persons with
records of diabetes or uveitis while enrolled in the plan were
also excluded, to minimize the potential for capturing macu-
lar cyst pathologic findings that may have been misdiag-
nosed or miscoded as an MH. The University of Michigan In-
stitutional Review Board approved this study based on the use
of aggregate deidentified data.
Identifying Persons Newly Diagnosed With MH
To be counted as an incident MH case, the enrollee must have
had at least 1 visit to see an eye care professional during his or
her first 3 years in the plan with no documented diagnosis of
MH and no record of vitrectomy surgery (a common treat-
ment for MH) during the first 3 years in the plan. The enrollee
must have then had a subsequent visit to an eye care profes-
sionalaftertheindexdate(3yearsaftertheirentryintotheplan)
with an ICD-9-CM code for MH (362.54). To be even more cer-
tain the enrollee indeed had MH and it was not a miscoded di-
agnosis, we required a record of vitrectomy surgery for MHs
(CPT code 67042) within 90 days of the initial diagnosis of MH
to be counted as a case. This code specific for MH surgery was
introduced in 2008. As such, only individuals with an index
date after January 1, 2009, were included. For these analy-
ses, persons coded with a diagnosis of MH but with no record
of vitrectomy were not counted as cases.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed from December 1, 2014,
to August 15, 2016, using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Participant characteristics were summarized for the entire
sample using means and SDs for continuous variables and fre-
quencies and percentages for categorical variables.
The cumulative incidence of MH was defined as the num-
ber of cases divided by the number of person-years from the
index date to the date of the last visit to an eye care profes-
sional. Risk of developing MH was also evaluated by Kaplan-
Meier life-table analysis. Wilcoxon log-rank tests were used to
compare probability of MH formation by age, sex, and race/
ethnicity.

Key Points
Question What are the incidence of and risk factors for
developing idiopathic macular hole in a diverse US-based patient
population?
Findings In a longitudinal cohort of beneficiaries enrolled in a
large managed care network from 2009 to 2012, female sex and
age were found to be the strongest risk factors for developing
idiopathic macular hole.
Meaning These data confirm across a large managed care
network that female sex is strongly associated with development
of idiopathic macular hole, with the effect varying across ages
differently for females vs males; these differences may contribute
to the underlying pathophysiologic factors of the development of
macular hole.

with MH requiring vitrectomy surgery. P < .05 was consid-
eredsignificant.Allbeneficiarieswerefollowedupinthemodel
from the index date (3 years after plan entry) until they were
first diagnosed with MH and underwent vitrectomy or were
censored. Censoring occurred at the date of the last eye ex-
amination, which marked the last opportunity to receive a di-
agnosis of MH from an eye care professional.
Multivariable models were adjusted for age; sex; race/eth-
nicity;educationallevel;income;regionofresidenceatthetime
of enrollment in the medical plan; residence in an urban or ru-
ralsetting;cataract,eyetrauma,pseudophakia,oraphakia;and
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cerebrovascular accident, myo-
cardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and depression.
A broader sensitivity analysis to capture cases before 2008
was also performed. The following CPT codes were queried,
which were used for coding MH surgery before the introduc-
tion in 2008 of more specific coding for vitreoretinal surgery:
1471,1472,1473,1474,1475,1479,67036,67038,67039,67040,
67041, 67042, 67043, 67108, 67112, and 67113. These codes
needed to be dated within 90 days of the initial diagnosis of
MH to be counted as a case.
Results
A total of 659 357 beneficiaries met the inclusion criteria; 144
(0.02%) developed MH that required vitrectomy during the
study period. The mean [SD] age of individuals who devel-
oped an MH was 62.6 [6.3] years and was 56.2 [9.2] years for
thosewhodidnotdevelopanMH(P < .001)(Table1).Themean
[SD] duration of follow-up for individuals who developed an
MH was 2.3 [0.9] years and for those who did not was 1.4 [1.1]
years (P < .001). Among the 144 individuals who developed
MH, 105 (72.9%) were female. The racial distribution of those
diagnosed with MHs included 109 white individuals (79.0%),
16blackindividuals(11.6%),4Latinoindividuals(2.9%),7Asian
individuals (5.1%), and 2 persons of other races/ethnicities
(1.4%); 6 individuals were missing data on race/ethnicity.
Cumulative Incidence of MH
The cumulative incidence of MH formation was 41.1 cases per
100 000 person-years. In males, the cumulative incidence was
34.1 cases per 100 000 person-years, while in women, the cu-
mulative incidence was 55.9 cases per 100 000 person-years.
The cumulative incidence of MH formation increased with
age. Per 100 000 person-years, there were 6.0 cases in indi-
viduals aged 40 to 49 years, 30.3 cases in those aged 50 to 59
years, 98.2 cases in those aged 60 to 69 years, and 77.1 cases
in individuals 70 years or older.
The cumulative incidence of MH formation varied across
races/ethnicities:per100000person-years,therewere45.7cases
in white individuals, 60.1 cases in black individuals, 29.5 cases
in Latino individuals, and 94.5 cases in Asian individuals.
Risk Factors Associated With Development of MH
Sociodemographic Factors
After adjusting for potential confounders, females had a
64% increased risk of being diagnosed with MH compared
with males (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.64; 95% CI, 1.11-
2.43; P = .01) (Table 2). Asian-American enrollees had a
177% increased risk of developing MH compared with white
individuals (aHR, 2.77; CI, 1.27-6.02; P = .01). Black enroll-
ees (aHR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.86-2.76; P = .15), Latino enrollees
(aHR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.35-2.58; P = .91), and persons of other
races/ethnicities (aHR, 2.33; 95% CI, 0.57-9.45; P = .24) did
not have an increased risk of developing MH vs white
enrollees.
We found a nonlinear effect of age on the risk of MH.
Age had an increased effect on the hazard of MH initially,
followed by a decreased effect after age 75.2 years. Table 3
shows HRs at various ages compared with the mean age
(56.2 years). For instance, at age 16.2 years, the HR for MH
was 9.90 × 10−10 (95% CI, 1.33 × 10−12 to 7.37 × 10−7), at age
36.2 years the HR was 1.06 × 10−3 (95% CI, 1.20 × 10−4 to
9.33 × 10−3), and at age 76.2 years the HR was 0.83 (95% CI,
0.43-1.63).
Ocular Comorbidities
After adjusting for confounders, persons diagnosed with cata-
ract had an 86% increased risk of developing MH compared
with individuals without cataracts (aHR, 1.86; CI, 1.22-2.82;
P = .001)(Table2).Adiagnosisofpseudophakiaoraphakiawas
associated with more than a 2-fold increased risk of develop-
ing MH (aHR, 3.66; CI, 2.46-5.44; P < .001).
Systemic Comorbidities
After adjusting for potential confounders, individuals with hy-
pertension, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident,
hyperlipidemia, or congestive heart failure did not have a sig-
nificantly different hazard of MH formation compared with
those individuals without each of these conditions, respec-
tively (Table 2).
Sensitivity Analysis
The results using available vitrectomy coding that dated back
to 2001 were similar to those of the primary, more restricted
analysis using coding more specific for MH surgery that was
instituted in 2008 (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement).
The cumulative incidence of MH formation was 40.8 cases per
100 000 person-years. Females had a 68% increased hazard
of being diagnosed with an MH compared with males of the
same age.
Interaction of Age and Sex and MH
Age was determined to have a second-order effect on the
risk of MH; an interaction between age and sex was also
found (Table 4). Age is seen to have an increased effect on
the risk of MH for both males and females initially, followed
by a decreased effect after age 77.7 years for females and age
84.1 years for males (Figure). Table 4 shows the HRs for
males and females at various ages compared with the refer-
ence group of males at mean age (56.3 years). For instance,
in males, at age 16.3 years, the HR was 3.50 × 10−5 (95% CI,
2.47 × 10−6 to 4.96 × 10−4) and at age 36.3 years, the HR was
2.69 × 10−2 (95% CI, 1.11 × 10−2 to 6.51 × 10−2), while in
females, at age 16.3 years, the HR was 2.54 × 10−7 (95% CI,

Discussion
Using a large nationwide US managed care database, our study
confirms the known association between age and female sex
withtheriskfordevelopingidiopathicMHs.Thisdatabasecap-
tures a cohort of 144 persons who were followed up longitu-
dinally for newly diagnosed MH that required surgical repair
with vitrectomy. We learned that not only does the probabil-
ity of developing MH significantly increase with age but also
that older age affects the risk of development of MH consid-
erably more for women (64% more likely in a woman than in
a man of the same age).

To mitigate misclassification of the diagnosis of MH in pa-
tientswhoactuallyhadcystoidmacularedemaandnotMH,we
excludedindividualswithdiabetesoruveitis.Assuch,thefind-
ingsofouranalysescannotbegeneralizedtothesegroupsofpa-
tients and are not generalizable to MHs in the entire population
but are specifically aimed toward capturing idiopathic disease.
Moreover, given our requirement of concurrent coding for
vitrectomy, along with exclusion of patients with diabetes and
uveitis, we suspect that very few cases were misclassified in
both analyses. Our study captures visually significant, later-
stage MHs but not earlier-stage MHs or individuals with later-
stage MHs that did not proceed to undergo vitrectomy, which
likely results in an underestimate of the incidence of MH in our
population.
Although there are many advantages to using claims data,
our source lacks important clinical information such as best-
corrected visual acuity and findings from ancillary tests such
as optical coherence tomography that can affect the ability to
diagnose and manage MH.
Finally, our study included individuals who all had com-
mercial health insurance. Caution should be taken when ap-
plying the findings to those with other types of coverage or no
coverage. Also, given our inclusion criteria requiring at least
2 visits to an eye care professional, it is possible that individu-
als seeking routine eye care may be systematically different

from those who do not and may bias our results toward cap-
turing more cases than would be represented in the general
population.
Past research has demonstrated that age is an important
risk factor for the development of MH. Liquefaction of the vit-
reous and the development of posterior vitreous detach-
ments (PVDs) increase with older age. Given that PVDs are
known to increase the predisposition for development of
MH,3,14 this finding likely explains some of the heightened risk
ofMHamongolderindividuals.Furthermore,withaging,many
patients undergo cataract surgery, which has also been shown
to increase the risk of PVDs, which can, in turn, lead to devel-
opment of MH.15
OurfindingthatfemaleshaveahigherriskofdevelopingMHs
relative to males is consistent with other studies in the
literature.2,4,8,13 The precise etiologic factors for the increased
risk of MH in women are unknown, although several theories
have been proposed. Postmenopausal women are more prone
toPVDcomparedwithmalecounterpartsofsimilarage.Thisfind-
ing is thought to be associated with the effects of decreased es-
trogen in the vitreous gel.16 Similarly, there are reports that es-
trogenreplacementtherapyisassociatedwithareductioninthe
risk of idiopathic MHs.5 We hypothesize that estrogen changes
duringperimenopausalyearsplayaroleinthecross-linkingand
lossofvitreouscollagenandglycosaminoglycansthatoccurswith
vitreous liquefaction, subsequent vitreomacular traction, and
the onset of MH pathologic findings.
To our knowledge, no prior studies report an association
between race/ethnicity and the risk of MHs. Our study re-
vealed that Asian individuals have a higher risk of develop-
ment of MH compared with white individuals. We suspect this
finding may be owing, in part, to greater proportions of Asian
individuals with myopia, an established risk factor for MH.17,18
Unfortunately, our data source lacks information on the level
of refractive error for enrollees to incorporate this variable into
regression models. Additional research is required to substan-
tiate the association between Asian ethnicity and develop-
ment of MH.
Anotherinterestingfindingfromouranalysesistheincreased
risk of MH associated with cataracts or pseudophakia or apha-
kia. Since cataract surgery can hasten the development of PVD,
and PVD predisposes patients to MH, this finding may help ex-
plainthehigherriskofMHinpatientswithpseudophakiaorapha-
kia. Also, it is possible that removal of the cataract revealed an
underlying MH that was not noted preoperatively, but became
a new diagnosis when the patient became pseudophakic. Simi-
larly,itispossiblethatvisualimpairmentfromanMHmayhave

ditions.Additionalresearchisneededtodeterminewhethercata-

risk of MH or whether there are other explanations for the in-
creased risk.
Most prior studies examining the epidemiologic factors of
MHhaveassessedtheprevalence,butnottheincidence,ofMH
as we have done here.8 To our knowledge, there is only 1 study
assessing the incidence of MH among persons residing in
Olmstead County, Minnesota, between 1992 and 2002.2 Com-
parison of the findings from our study with this past analysis
is challenging for many reasons. First, the sociodemographic
characteristicsofthepatientsdifferbetweenthe2cohorts.Sec-
ond, our study was conducted a decade later than when the
Olmstead County study was performed. Advances in ancil-
larydiagnostictestssuchasopticalcoherencetomographythat
help facilitate the diagnosis of MH likely made it much easier
to diagnose MH in our analysis. On the other hand, our study
captures only patients with MHs that required surgical re-
pair, while the prior study captured patients with all stages of
MH. Thus, we are likely underestimating the true incidence
of this condition. Finally, there may be differences in the level
of experience and expertise at diagnosing MH among the eye
care professionals evaluating patients in the 2 studies.
Our sample size allows us to control for several important
potential confounding factors. Given that the patients identi-
fiedwithMHsallunderwentvitrectomysurgery,itislikelythat
nearly all were under the care of retinal specialists who are
qualified to diagnose MHs. Finally, unlike single-center stud-
ies, our analysis captures patients receiving care in various set-

tings by various eye care professionals; thus, the findings may
be more generalizable relative to other studies.
Conclusions
This study uses a large nationwide sample to confirm what ap-
pear to be the 2 most important risk factors associated with
MH formation, older age and female sex. Our findings sup-
port the clinical observation that the incidence of MH in-
creases in an aging population of women of perimenopausal
age. If further studies substantiate that menopausal changes
in levels of estrogen contribute to the higher risk of MH in older
women, they may help guide pharmacotherapeutics targeted
at the vitreoretinal interface to try to prevent or reduce the risk
for MHs.
