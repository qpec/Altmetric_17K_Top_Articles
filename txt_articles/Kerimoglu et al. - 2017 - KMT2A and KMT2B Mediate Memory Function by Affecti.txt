SUMMARY
Kmt2a and Kmt2b are H3K4 methyltransferases of
the Set1/Trithorax class. We have recently shown
the importance of Kmt2b for learning and memory.
Here, we report that Kmt2a is also important in mem-
ory formation. We compare the decrease in H3K4
methylation and de-regulation of gene expression
in hippocampal neurons of mice with knockdown of
either Kmt2a or Kmt2b. Kmt2a and Kmt2b control
largely distinct genomic regions and different molec-
ular pathways linked to neuronal plasticity. Finally,
we show that the decrease in H3K4 methylation
resulting from Kmt2a knockdown partially recapit-
ulates the pattern previously reported in CK-p25
mice, a model for neurodegeneration and memory
impairment. Our findings point to the distinct func-
tions of even closely related histone-modifying
enzymes and provide essential insight for the devel-
opment of more efficient and specific epigenetic
therapies against brain diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Regulation of posttranslational histone modifications has been
implicated in memory formation, and its de-regulation is linked
to cognitive disorders (Day and Sweatt, 2011; Jakovcevski and
Akbarian, 2012; Fischer, 2014). Histone methylation is controlled
by the opposing activity of lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and
lysine demethylases (KDMs). Unlike histone acetylation, lysine
residues of histones can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated. Histone
3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is enriched around transcrip-
tion start site (TSS) regions of actively transcribed and/or poised
genes (Guenther et al., 2005), whereas histone 3 lysine 4 mono-
methylation (H3K4me1) is enriched at enhancers (Heintzman
et al., 2009). H3K4 methylation is mediated by SET proteins.
Set1 is the only H3K4 KMT in yeast (Roguev et al., 2001).
Drosophila encodes three different SET proteins—Set1, trithorax
(trx), and trithorax-related (trr) (Mohan et al., 2011)—whereas
mammals possess six SET-related H3K4 methyltransferases—
Kmt2a (Mll1), Kmt2b (Mll2), Kmt2c (Mll3), Kmt2d (Mll4), Setd1a,
and Setd1b. Kmt2a/Kmt2b are related to trx, Kmt2c/Kmt2d to
trr, and Setd1a/Setd1b to Set1 (Shilatifard, 2012). The existence
of several homologous histone-modifying enzymes mediating
the same modifications raises the question of redundancy
versus specificity of their actions. This is especially true for brain
regions such as the hippocampus, which is intimately linked
to memory function, where all six H3K4 KMTs are strongly
expressed (see, for example, hippocampal RNA sequencing
[RNA-seq] data published in Benito et al., 2015 or RNA-seq
data from wild-type mice reported in this study).
The specific roles of H3K4 KMTs in neurons and memory func-
tion have not been investigated systematically so far. In this
study, we begin to address this issue by comparing the roles
of Kmt2a and Kmt2b. We measure H3K4me3/me1 patterns
and related gene expression specifically in hippocampal neu-
rons of mice lacking Kmt2a (Kmt2a cKO) or Kmt2b (Kmt2b
cKO) in excitatory forebrain neurons of the adult brain. Both
cKO mice display impaired memory consolidation (Kerimoglu
et al., 2013; this study). Moreover, we find that the two
KMTs regulate genomic regions associated with unique cellular
functions.
RESULTS
Kmt2a cKO Mice Exhibit Impaired Hippocampus-
Dependent Memory Formation
We have previously shown that Kmt2b cKO mice have memory
impairment (Kerimoglu et al., 2013). Here, we generated Kmt2a
cKO mice using the same Cre/loxP strategy (Kerimoglu et al.,
2013; Minichiello et al., 1999) to ensure deletion of Kmt2a in adult
excitatory forebrain neurons and confirmed its knockdown in
hippocampus (Figures S1A–S1C). We then subjected Kmt2a
cKO and control littermates to behavioral testing. There was no
difference in time spent in center of the open field among groups
(Figure S1D; p = 0.37). Kmt2a cKO mice, however, spent more

 time in the open arms of elevated plus maze, indicating anxiolytic
behavior (Figure S1E; p < 0.001). No difference was observed for
depressive-like behavior (Figure S1F; p = 0.67). Kmt2a cKO mice
displayed impaired associative memory in the fear-conditioning
paradigm (Figure 1A; p < 0.01) and impaired spatial memory in
water maze test (Figure 1B: escape latency two-way ANOVA
genotype effect: p < 0.001; Figure 1C: probe test, preference
to the target quadrant: p = 0.7 for Kmt2a cKO, p < 0.0001 for con-
trol). Swim speed was similar among groups (Figure S1G; p =
0.39). Differently from Kmt2b cKO (Kerimoglu et al., 2013), object
recognition memory was not affected in Kmt2a cKO mice
(Figure 1D).
Loss of Kmt2a and Kmt2b Affects H3K4me3 at Unique
Genomic Regions
We
performed
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
sequencing
(ChIP-seq) on neuronal nuclei sorted by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) (Benito et al., 2015; Halder et al., 2016) from
hippocampal CA region of Kmt2a cKO and Kmt2b cKO mice
and their control littermates. In both cKO mice, the amount of
neurons obtained after cell sorting was similar to their respective
controls, confirming that loss of Kmt2a or Kmt2b does not cause
neurodegeneration (Figures S2A and S2B). Knockdown of
Kmt2a or Kmt2b leads to a significant decrease in H3K4me3,
which is especially obvious at transcription start sites (TSSs)
(Figures 2A and 2B), without affecting bulk H3K4me3 in CA tis-
sue (Figures S2C and S2D). We detected 4,964 genes with
decreased and only four genes with increased H3K4me3 at
TSS regions in Kmt2a cKO neurons (Figure 2C, upper panel).
In contrast, in Kmt2b cKO, there were 2,801 genes with

decreased and 112 genes with increased
H3K4me3 at TSS regions (Figure 2C, up-
per panel). We cannot exclude that part of
the observed changes are due to second-
ary effects, but the finding that the vast
majority of the observed changes reflect
decreased H3K4me3 is in line with the
loss of H3K4-methyltransferase activity. Interestingly, the genes
showing decreased H3K4me3 at the TSS in Kmt2a cKO and
Kmt2b cKO differ substantially (Figure 2C, lower panel) and
represent different functional categories (Figures 2D and 2E).
Genes affected by loss of Kmt2a are involved in transcriptional
regulation, chromatin binding, mRNA processing, and protein
ubiquitination (Figures 2D, 2F, and S3A), whereas those in
Kmt2b cKO are broadly involved in neuronal protrusion-related
categories—i.e., Wnt signaling, cytokine and growth factor activ-
ity, matrix metalloprotease activity, cell adhesion, and angiogen-
esis (Figures 2E, 2F, and S3B).
TSS regions with decreased H3K4me3 in Kmt2a cKO mice
are specifically enriched (E value < 0.05) for the consensus
sequence (CGGAAGTG) representing 26 transformation-spe-
cific (ETS) transcription factors (Figure 2G; Data S1), whereas
those in Kmt2b cKO are enriched for a sequence specific for
E2F transcription factors (GGCGGGA; Figure 2G; Data S1).
Thedecrease in TSS-associated H3K4me3 is more widespread
but less severe in Kmt2a cKO than in Kmt2b cKO. With false dis-
covery rate (FDR) < 0.1 and fold change > 1.2, there are 5,182 TSS
regions with decreased H3K4me3 in Kmt2a cKO in contrast to
2,963 in Kmt2b cKO (Figure 2H). There are, however, far less
TSS regions in Kmt2a cKO than in Kmt2b cKO, at which
H3K4me3 is decreased more than 2-fold (Figure 2H)—i.e., 267
in Kmt2a cKO versus 2,314 in Kmt2b cKO using FDR < 0.1.
Knockdown of Kmt2a or Kmt2b Leads to De-regulation
of Unique Gene-Expression Programs
By RNA sequencing, we observed 471 genes down- and 225
genes upregulated in Kmt2a cKO (Figure 3A) and 485 genes

 down- versus 89 genes upregulated in Kmt2b cKO mice in
comparison to controls (Figure 3B). There was again little overlap
between genes affected in Kmt2a cKO and Kmt2b cKO mice
(Figure 3C). In both cKO mice, there was a significant overlap be-
tween decreased gene expression and decreased H3K4me3 at
TSS (Figure 3D; hypergeometric test: p < 0.0001). With a lower
threshold for differential H3K4me3 binding, there was an even
greater overlap (Figures S4A and S4B). Genes that were previ-
ously
shown
to
be
downregulated
and
have
decreased
H3K4me3 at their promoters in Kmt2b cKO (Kerimoglu et al.,
2013) and those observed in this study in Kmt2a cKO mice
were confirmed in our RNA-seq/ChIP-seq and qPCR/ChIP-
qPCR analyses, respectively
(Figures S5A–S5D). Loss of
Kmt2a or Kmt2b did not impact H3 turnover (Figures S5E
and S5F).
Genes showing concomitant downregulation and decrease in
H3K4me3 in Kmt2a cKO are involved in neuronal and synaptic
development (Figure 3E), whereas those in Kmt2b cKO group
into metabolism-related processes (Figure 3F).
In both cKO mice, a large number of genes exhibit decreased
H3K4me3, whereas their expression is not affected (Figure 3D).
This was particularly true for stimulus-inducible immediate early
genes (IEGs) (Figures 3G and 3H) in Kmt2a cKO mice and is in
line with findings that H3K4me3 does not always relate to tran-
scriptional activity and can be a mark for ‘‘primed’’ genes (An-
dreu-Vieyra et al., 2010; Denissov et al., 2014; Guenther et al.,
2005; Wang et al., 2009).
Loss of Kmt2a and Kmt2b Affects H3K4
Monomethylation at Unique Genomic Regions
Similar to H3K4me3, we observed a substantial decrease in
the levels of H3K4me1, an established enhancer mark (Heintz-
man et al., 2009), in hippocampal Kmt2a cKO neurons (Figure 4A;
8,863 regions decreased and 914 regions increased with FDR <
0.1 and fold change > 1.2). The effect in Kmt2b cKO neurons was
comparatively modest (Figure 4A; 1,154 regions decreased and
324 regions increased with FDR < 0.1 and fold change > 1.2).
Again, there was little overlap in the genomic regions that ex-
hibited decreased H3K4me1 in Kmt2a cKO and Kmt2b cKO
mice (Figure 4B). Interestingly, each of these enzymes mediates
H3K4 mono- and trimethylation independently at non-overlap-
ping genomic locations (Figures 4C and 4D).
Given that H3K4me1 is enriched at enhancers, we also
explored long-distance interactions linked to regions with
decreased H3K4me1, using information about topological asso-
ciation domains (TADs) available for mouse cortex (Dixon et al.,
2012). We identified gene promoters located in 40-kb TAD
bins interacting with those possessing significantly decreased
H3K4me1 peaks, filtered them further keeping only the regions
with interaction scores beyond 1 SD from the mean (Figure 4E)
and subjected the final list to functional Gene Ontology (GO)
analysis. In Kmt2a cKO, we observed enrichment in categories
related to transcriptional regulation and neuronal signaling (Fig-
ures 4F–4H; Data S2). There was no clear category enrichment
in Kmt2b cKO (Data S2). Moreover, decreased H3K4me1 at
TSS did not significantly overlap with decreased gene expres-
sion (Figures S4C and S4D). Finally, gene promoters interacting
with decreased H3K4me1 peaks do not significantly overlap
with those having decreased H3K4me3 in Kmt2a cKO neurons
(Figure 4I).
Comparison of H3K4me3 in Kmt2a and Kmt2b cKO Mice
to H3K4 Changes Observed in a Mouse Model for
Neurodegeneration
We compared the changes in H3K4me3 detected in our cKO
mice to a previously published dataset obtained from the hippo-
campus of CK-p25 mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease
(Gjoneska et al., 2015). Six weeks of p25 induction results in
decreased H3K4me3 at the promoters of memory-related genes
(Gjoneska et al., 2015). We remapped and reanalyzed those da-
tasets (GEO: GSE65159) using our parameters (see Experi-
mental Procedures) and confirmed that genes with reduced
H3K4me3 in CK-p25 mice are involved in synaptic plasticity
(Figure S6). Interestingly, 52% of the genes with decreased
H3K4me3 at TSS regions in CK-p25 mice showed also
decreased H3K4me3 in Kmt2a cKO mice (Figure 5A). Although
the number of genes showing decreased H3K4me3 was five
times higher in Kmt2a cKO mice (using the exact same FDR
and log2 fold change cutoff), the overlap between both gene
sets is significant (hypergeometic test p < 0.0001). Using the
same approach to compare the genes linked to reduced
H3K4me3 in CK-p25 and Kmt2b mice revealed no statistically
significant overlap (Figure 5B). The 452 genes with significantly
reduced H3K4me3 in both Kmt2a cKO and CK-p25 mice are
almost exclusively enriched in memory- and synaptic-plas-
ticity-related categories (Figures 5C and 5E). Interestingly, in
the RNA-seq data of Gjoneska et al. (2015), Kmt2a, but not
Kmt2b, is downregulated in CK-p25 mice (Figure 5F, upper
panel). We confirmed this observation by qPCR (Figure 5F, lower
panel).

 DISCUSSION
Kmt2b cKO mice have recently been shown to exhibit memory
impairment (Kerimoglu et al., 2013). Here, we demonstrate that
deletion of Kmt2a in the adult forebrain also impairs memory
function. These findings concord with a study on constitutive
heterozygous knockout of Kmt2a in mice, which exhibit impaired
contextual fear memory (Gupta et al., 2010). However, the results
regarding fear memory may at least partly be affected by
decreased anxiety. Nevertheless, the fact that Kmt2a knock-
down also impairs spatial memory in the water maze test argues
for its essential involvement in hippocampus-dependent mem-
ory function. In support of this view, Kmt2a has previously
been implicated in working memory (Jakovcevski et al., 2015),
anxiety and addiction (Shen et al., 2016), and postnatal neuro-
genesis. Interestingly, although Kmt2b cKO mice display
impaired object recognition memory (Kerimoglu et al., 2013),
this specific form of memory is intact in Kmt2a cKO mice. These
data are in line with findings for histone acetyltransferases
(HATs). For example, CREB binding protein (CBP) is a HAT
mainly linked to object recognition memory (Valor et al., 2011),
whereas loss of other HATs, such as KAT2a/GCN5, does not
affect this type of learning but rather causes impairment of
spatial memory (Stilling et al., 2014). These data suggest that
related histone-modifying enzymes are likely to control different
transcriptional programs in postmitotic neurons. In line with this
hypothesis, we observe that the closely related KMTs, Kmt2a
and Kmt2b, appear to regulate different gene sets in hippocam-
pal neurons, which is corroborated by the affected promoters
having unique consensus sequences. These findings are based
on H3K4me3 ChIP-seq experiments. Whereas we were unable
to identify commercially available antibody to perform ChIP-
seq for KMT2A and KMT2B in our experimental setting, data
available from other cell types using, for example, tagged pro-
teins suggest that both enzymes are found on a large number
of overlapping promoters (Denissov et al., 2014; Guenther
et al., 2005). These data indicate that the analysis of neuronal
H3K4me3 ChIP-seq in mice that lack the H3K4me3 methlytrans-
ferases Kmt2a or Kmt2b in neurons of the adult brain is a reliable
indicator of functionality of these enzymes. It is possible that the
observed functional specificity of Kmt2a and Kmt2b is—at least
in part—linked to specific protein interactions or posttransla-
tional modifications and do not necessarily have to involve
Kmt2a and Kmt2b binding to unique genomic locations. In line
with this view, it was, for example, recently shown that protein ki-
nase Msk1 can control Kmt2a-dependent gene expression
(Wiersma et al., 2016). Moreover, there is evidence that the asso-
ciation with different co-activators can explain unique function
of different subgroups of H3K4 methyltransferases—i.e., trx-
(Kmt2a/b), trr- (Kmt2c/d), and Set1-related (Setd1a/b) (Duncan
et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2006). For example, Kmt2c/d associate
with ASC-2 (Lee et al., 2006), whereas Kmt2a/b bind to Menin
(Dreijerink et al., 2006; Hughes et al., 2004; Shilatifard, 2012; Yo-
koyama et al., 2004). We suggest that future studies should
address these issues.
Another interesting observation is that loss of neuronal Kmt2a
and Kmt2b caused decreased H3K4me3 at a number of
genomic regions without affecting corresponding gene expres-
sion. Although this observation is in line with previous studies
carried out in adult and embryonic tissues (Denissov et al.,
2014; Glaser et al., 2006; Jakovcevski et al., 2015; Kerimoglu
et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2014), this may partly be due to ChIP-
seq having been performed from neurons and RNA-seq from
whole tissue.
Nevertheless, especially IEGs showed decreased H3K4me3
without concomitant downregulation, suggesting that Kmt2a
and Kmt2b control activity-induced gene expression in neurons.
This view is supported by findings in immune cells showing that
only genes with high H3K4me3 at the TSS can be induced by
histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (Wang et al., 2009), which
are in turn known to improve memory (Fischer, 2014).
Our data also revealed that especially Kmt2a is required
for neuronal H3K4me1. Genomic regions with decreased
H3K4me1 in Kmt2a cKO mice were substantially different from
those with decreased H3K4me3, which is in line with the view
that H3K4me1 is an enhancer mark (Heintzman et al., 2009). Re-
gions with reduced H3K4me1 are linked through long-distance
interactions to chromosomal regions containing genes involved
in transcriptional regulation, chromatin binding, and synaptic
signaling/plasticity. These observations have to be interpreted
with care, however, because the information regarding TADs is
based on data from the mouse cortex (Dixon et al., 2012),
because data from adult hippocampal neurons is not yet avail-
able. Nevertheless, the fact that chromosomal regions interact-
ing with decreased H3K4me1 peaks are overrepresented for
genes linked to synaptic signaling signifies the necessity to
further explore the role of neuronal Kmt2a in long-distance
interactions. These data indicate that Kmt2a elicits a dual
impact on gene regulation in neuronal cells, through regulation
of H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 at distinct genomic locations.

 A possible mechanism through which Kmt2a can mediate
H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 at different places may be its associa-
tion with specific proteins at different genomic locations. Future
studies should address this issue.
Interestingly, the genes affected by decreased H3K4me3
in hippocampal CA neurons of Kmt2a cKO mice showed a sig-
nificant overlap to the changes observed in CK-p25 mice, a
model for Alzheimer’s disease (Fischer et al., 2005). This over-
lap and the number of promoters with decreased H3K4me3 in
CK-p25 may even be underestimated, because Gjoneska et al.
(2015) analyzed whole hippocampal tissue whereas we per-
formed ChIP-seq experiments in hippocampal CA neurons.
In contrast, the pattern in Kmt2b cKO mice was rather distinct
from that in CK-p25 mice. In line with this, we observed that
the Kmt2a gene is downregulated in the hippocampus of
CK-p25 mice, whereas Kmt2b expression was not affected.
Thus, our data suggest that dysfunction of Kmt2a-mediated
H3K4 methylation might play a role in the pathogenesis of
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), a hypothesis that should be further tested in future
research.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
For details, refer to Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Animals
All mice used in this study were C57BL/6J mice of 3–5 months of age (C57B/
6J). All groups were age and sex matched. Statistical analysis confirmed that
no gender differences were observed in any experiment. Mice were kept in
standard single cages with food and water provided ad libitum. In all experi-
ments, mice containing loxP sites, but not expressing the Cre transgene,
were used as controls. All experiments were performed in accordance with
the animal protection law of the state of Lower Saxony (protocol number
Fischer 1000/1004).
Behavioral Analysis
Both control and cKO groups contained male and female mice. The groups
were age and sex matched. Statistical analysis revealed that there were no dif-
ferences among groups due to gender.
In open-field and novel object recognition tests, mice were habituated to
the plastic arena for 2 days for 5 min each. The relative time spent in the
center was used as a readout of anxiety (i.e., open-field test). Afterward,
the mice were habituated to two white boxes for 2 consecutive days and
on the next day were presented with two black cubes. They were left to
explore them for 5 min. After 24 hr, the one black cube was exchanged
to a red tape. They explored the objects for 5 min, and the relative explora-
tion time of the novel object (i.e., red tape) was used as an index of memory
performance.
Elevated plus Maze Test
The mice were introduced for 5 min into the center of a plus maze with two
open and two closed arms. The relative time spent in open arms was used
as anxiety index.
Porsolt Forced Swim Test
Mice were introduced for 5 min into a container filled with water. Immobility
time was measured.
Pavlovian Fear-Conditioning Test
Mice were introduced into a chamber and left to explore it for 3 min. Immedi-
ately afterward, they received a mild foot shock (0.5 mA) for 2 s. 24 hr later, they
were reintroduced into the same chamber and their freezing behavior was
measured.
Morris Water Maze Test
The setup consisted of a circular pool filled with opaque water into which a
platform was submerged. At each training session, mice were introduced
into the pool four times and were left to search for the hidden platform for
60 s. In cases where they were not able to find the platform within that time
limit, they were gently guided there. Probe test was carried out 24 hr after
the last training session.
Real-Time qPCR
RNA isolation was performed using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) as described previ-
ously (Kerimoglu et al., 2013). cDNA was synthesized with Transcriptor High
Fidelity cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche). All reactions were performed in Roche
480 Light Cycler.
Western Blotting
Protein isolation was performed using TriPrep kit from Macherey Nagel.
Western blot for Kmt2a protein and bulk H3K4me3 in hippocampus was
performed as described previously (Kuczera et al., 2010; Stilling et al.,
2014).
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation from FACS-Sorted Nuclei
FACS
ChIP from neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei sorted by FACS was performed
as described previously (Halder et al., 2016) with slight modifications.
ChIP
In order to obtain enough chromatin for ChIP experiments (500 ng at
least), two samples of the same genotype and sex were combined
throughout all experiments. 500 ng of chromatin was used for ChIP, and
50 ng of additional chromatin was used as input from each sample. The
following antibodies were used for ChIP: H3K4me3: Abcam ab8580;
H3K4me1: Abcam ab8895; and H3: Abcam ab1791. In all cases, 0.5 mg
of antibody was used. ChIP was performed as described previously (Benito
et al., 2015).
ChIP Sequencing
ChIP sequencing was performed as described previously (Benito et al., 2015;
Halder et al., 2016).
RNA Sequencing
RNA sequencing was performed as described previously (Halder et al., 2016).
