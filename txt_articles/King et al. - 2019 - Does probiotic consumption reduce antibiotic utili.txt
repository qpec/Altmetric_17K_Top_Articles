Background: Overall reduction of antibiotic use is a widely adopted public health goal. Given evidence that
consuming probiotics reduce the incidence, duration and/or severity of certain types of common acute
infections, we hypothesized that probiotics are associated with reduced antibiotic use. This systematic review of
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessed the impact of probiotic supplementation (any strain, dose or
duration), compared to placebo, on antibiotic utilization for common, acute infections in otherwise healthy
people of all ages. Methods: We searched 13 electronic databases including MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL
from inception to 17th January 2017. Backward and forward citation searches were also conducted. Two
reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted study data. We assessed risk of bias for
individual studies using criteria adapted from the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, and the quality of
evidence for each outcome was assessed using the GRADE system. Studies that evaluated similar outcomes
were pooled statistically in meta-analyses using a random-effects model. Results: We screened 1533 citations,
and of these, 17 RCTs met our predefined inclusion criteria. All 17 were conducted in infants and/or children with a
primary aim of preventing acute respiratory tract infections, acute lower digestive tract infections or acute otitis
media. Included studies used 13 probiotic formulations, all comprising single or combination Lactobacillus and
Bifidobacterium delivered in a range of food or supplement products. Mean duration of probiotic supplementa-
tion ranged from 4 days to 9 months. Trial quality was variable. Meta-analysis demonstrated that infants and
children who received probiotics to prevent acute illnesses had a lower risk of being prescribed antibiotics,
relative to those who received placebo (Pooled Relative Risk = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.54–0.94). When restricted to five
studies with a low risk of bias, the pooled relative risk was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.23–0.97). Significant statistical hetero-
geneity was present in effect size estimates, which appeared to be due to one trial which could partly be
considered as an outlier. Conclusions: Probiotics, provided to reduce the risk for common acute infections, may
be associated with reduced antibiotic use in infants and children. Additional well-designed studies are needed to
substantiate these findings in children and explore similar findings in other population groups.

Introduction
T
he threat of antibiotic resistant pathogens has led many public
health organizations around the globe to work toward improving
the appropriate use of antibiotics, defined by WHO as ‘‘the cost-
effective use of antimicrobials which maximizes clinical therapeutic
effect while minimizing both drug-related toxicity and the develop-
ment of antimicrobial resistance’’.1 According to the CDC, there are
about two million cases of antibiotic-resistant infections yearly in
USA, resulting in 23 000 deaths.2 One means to reduce antibiotic
use is to avoid prescribing them for viral illnesses such as colds,
influenza and other acute respiratory infections, where inappropriate
antibiotic use is most common.3–5 Another means to reduce
antibiotic use is to help reduce the frequency and the duration of
symptoms; if fewer people get ill, fewer people may be prescribed
antibiotics—and if people are symptomatic for shorter periods of
time, they may be less likely to be prescribed antibiotics, or to
request
antibiotic
treatment
in
order
to
alleviate
prolonged
symptoms.
Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in
adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host.6 Probiotics
are used to prevent and treat many gastrointestinal maladies.7 Lately,
targets for probiotic benefits have extended beyond the gut.8
Probiotic effects are mediated by various and sometimes strain-
specific mechanisms, including the strengthening of gut barrier
structure
and
function;
interactions
with
immune
system

 components; production of short-chain fatty acids in the gut, and
other direct and indirect influences on the stability, expression and
composition of host microbes.9
Evidence
suggests
that
probiotic
supplementation
reduces
episodes of common infectious diseases including respiratory tract
infections10 and diarrhea.11 In addition, probiotic supplementation
reduces the duration of symptoms in otherwise healthy children and
adults with common acute respiratory conditions.12 By decreasing
the incidence and severity of common acute infections, probiotic
supplementation could be associated with decreased antibiotic use.
To our knowledge, the relationship between probiotic use and
antibiotic use has not been systematically reviewed. The objective
of this systematic review is to explore whether or not antibiotic
prescriptions are reduced in the target populations of studies that
investigated probiotics to reduce the risk for common acute illnesses.
We hypothesize that because probiotics help to reduce the incidence
or duration of certain types of common acute infections, probiotic
supplementation could be associated with reduced consumption of
antibiotics. If so, probiotic supplementation could be an evidence-
based strategy to reduce the need for antibiotics and therefore could
contribute to managing the emergence of antibiotic resistance.13
Methods
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
In this systematic review, we included randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) of any duration in which probiotic supplementation was
provided to reduce the risk for common acute infections in
healthy people of all ages (i.e. infants, children, adolescents and/or
adults, including elderly/institutionalized elderly). Eligible study
infections included acute respiratory tract infections (i.e. colds,
influenza, sinusitis, pharyngitis, acute bronchitis, pneumonia),
acute otitis media and acute lower digestive tract infections
(diarrhea), but not antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal symptoms.
We included conditions where symptoms were self-reported by a
participant (or a parent in the case of infants and children), or
where upper or lower tract respiratory symptoms were medically
attended for 14 days or less.
The included studies also had to report a measurement of
antibiotic
prescription,
receipt
or
consumption
(e.g.
mean
number, percentage, the number or percentage of participants
with more than one antibiotic prescription, antibiotic purchases,
etc.) within the intervention period or within two weeks after the
intervention period, either as a primary or secondary outcome.
We included studies that assessed any orally consumed probiotic
strain, either alone or in combination with another probiotic strain,
and that compared probiotics with a placebo or with no treatment.
Studies where probiotics were combined with other potentially
functional ingredients or therapies (e.g. prebiotics, vitamins, herbal
extracts, immunostimulants, drugs such as antihistamines, or non-
steroidal
anti-inflammatory
drugs)
were
eligible
only
if
the
comparator also included these other interventions as well, so that
the net effect of probiotic supplementation could be assessed. We
included studies conducted in any country and in any setting,
clinical or non-clinical.
Search strategy
To identify relevant trials, we searched MEDLINE, Embase,
CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR),
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),
the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), NIHR
Health Technology Assessment (HTA) database, NICE Technology
appraisals, Science Citation Index (SCI) and Conference Proceedings
Citation Index. We searched for grey literature using OAISTER,
OpenGrey and NYAM Grey Literature Report, from inception to
17 January 2017. Search terms included ‘probiotics’, ‘antibiotics’
and ‘antimicrobials’. The full list of search terms is presented in
Supplementary Appendix A. Although we did not impose any
language
or
date
restrictions,
no
non-English
papers
were
identified that met the inclusion criteria.
We also applied additional evidence-finding techniques, including
checking references cited within the included papers and relevant
systematic reviews (i.e. backward citation searching); searching for
additional studies by the first (or primary) authors of relevant
studies; and forward citation searches to identify subsequent
studies/publications which had cited the included studies.
Screening and data extraction
Two independent reviewers (SK and HV) screened titles and
abstracts identified through the searches against the pre-defined
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Full papers were obtained of any
records
deemed
to
be
potentially
relevant
during
the
first
screening phase, and these were also screened independently by
two reviewers (SK and KG). We resolved any discrepancies
through discussion.
For each eligible study, data on study population characteristics
and results were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second
reviewer (SK and KG). In addition, the results were independently
extracted by a third reviewer (HV) and the two extraction forms
compared.
Risk of bias assessment
We assessed risk of bias of the RCTs using criteria adapted from the
Centre for Reviews and Dissemination.14 One reviewer applied this
criteria (SK) which was then checked by a second reviewer (KG).
A summary assessment for each study was conducted following
Cochrane guidance.15 We considered that the key quality criteria
involved
protections
against
selection
and
attrition
biases:
adequate randomization and allocation concealment and adequate
analysis of data from enrolled participants. Individual studies were
considered to have a ‘low’ risk of bias if all three key criteria were
adequately met, and a ‘high’ risk of bias if one or more of these
criteria were not adequately met. As antibiotic use is an objective
outcome and not likely to be affected by a lack of blinding of the
investigators or participants, it was not considered to be key quality
criterion.
For each outcome evaluated in our systematic review, the group of
studies that contributed data to this outcome was assessed to be of
‘high’, ‘moderate’, ‘low’ or ‘very low’ quality (as a body of evidence)
using the GRADE system.15 This system involves up or down-
grading the evidence based on risk of bias of the studies that
evaluated the outcome, as well as imprecision, inconsistency, indir-
ectness and publication bias.
When outcome data or information needed to evaluate quality
criteria were unclear in the publications, we attempted to contact
study authors for further information.
Data synthesis
To inform judgments about the comparability of studies prior to
combining their results via meta-analysis, study attributes were
described and compared with regard to the following: population
characteristics (e.g. age group, infection type and patient eligibility
status relative to the study’s therapeutic objective [prevention vs.
treatment]); intervention (level of shared probiotic taxonomic clas-
sification [e.g. strain, species, genera]) and outcomes (domain and
type of measurement [e.g. duration of intervention, etc.]).

 were collected for dichotomous outcomes, with Mantel-Haenszel
(M-H) risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs used to summarize effect
sizes. When a study evaluated more than one probiotic intervention
arm, we combined the data from those arms to create one larger
probiotic intervention arm.16,17 In order to include any cluster
randomized trials into the meta-analyses, we adjusted the data as
described in the Cochrane Handbook.15 To accommodate the
varying levels of baseline risk for patients, numbers needed to
treat (NNT) estimates can be derived from the estimated RR,
using the algebraic relationship NNT = 1/ [(1�RR)�B], where B is
a hypothesized level of baseline risk.
Heterogeneity across the primary studies in effect size and 95%
confidence interval estimates was visualized using forest plots (to
visualize
point
and
95%
confidence
intervals
for
individual
treatment effect estimates), quantified using the I2 statistic, and
assessed for statistical significance using the chi-squared test for het-
erogeneity (significance set at P < 0.05). Following guidelines
suggested by the Cochrane Collaboration, we interpreted an
I2 point estimate of <40% as being potentially not important,
30–60% as possibly representing moderate heterogeneity, 50–90%
as possibly representing substantial heterogeneity, and 75–100% as
possibly representing considerable heterogeneity.15
In the systematic review protocol, we had planned to conduct
subgroup analyses by grouping studies by probiotic taxonomic clas-
sification, dose, study duration (i.e. risk-reduction studies with an
intervention less than one month or longer than one month), setting
(i.e. nurseries, schools, retirement homes), studies that aim to
prevent or treat acute infections, and study country. We could not
do these planned analyses as substantial groupings that would enable
statistical comparisons were not possible. This was due to (a) a high
degree of variability among the studies (for taxonomic classification,
dose and study country), (b) no/little variation between the studies
(for study duration, prevention vs. treatment studies) or (c) a lack of
information in some of the included studies to facilitate compari-
sons (setting). In sensitivity analyses, we repeated the meta-analysis
after omitting lower quality studies.
Results
We assessed a total of 1533 citations for inclusion based on titles and
abstracts. Of these, 88 records were considered potentially relevant
and full papers were retrieved for further assessment. After screening
these full papers, 17 RCTs met the inclusion criteria and were
included in this systematic review.11,16–31 Trial locations were
widely dispersed and included Chile (one trial), China (one trial),
Croatia (two trials), Finland (five trials), Israel (one trial), Mexico
(one trial), Sweden (one trial), Thailand (one trial), the UK (one
trial), the Ukraine (one trial) and the USA (two trials).
All of the included RCTs were conducted in infants and/or
children. Only one of the trials was a cluster- RCT.26 Among
studies where setting was explicitly reported, nine were conducted
in children who were attending out of home child care centres,16–
18,20,22,23,25,26,29 one was conducted among attendees of a public
school,28 and one was conducted in children who were hospitalized
and who were at risk of developing acute gastrointestinal or respira-
tory infections.24 For this last study, the included children were
reported to have been hospitalized for non-infectious gastrointes-
tinal disorders, genetic disorders, cardiac disorders, urinary tract
disorders, neurologic disorders, non-infectious pulmonary and im-
munologic disorders and intoxications.
The majority (11) of studies assessed the impact of probiotics on
respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections.16,17,20,22–27,30,31 Four
studies focused on respiratory tract infections (RTI),18,19,21,28 and of
the remaining two studies, one assessed ‘common’ conditions
including respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections,11 and
the other assessed ‘fever, diarrhea or other illnesses’.29 Thirteen
different
probiotic
interventions
were
assessed,
although
all
involved
individual
or
combinations
of
Lactobacillus
and
Bifidobacterium strains (details of the preparations are presented in
Supplementary table S1). The methods of delivery also varied, and
included dry powder mixed with formula, expressed breastmilk,
milk or milk products, water or juice, in a cereal, or given within
in a commercially pre-prepared yogurt drink, or as oil drops, or
tablets in a slow-release pacifier. The intervention durations
ranged from a median of 4 days to 9 months across the included
trials, although the duration of probiotic in the majority of studies
(15) was greater than one month. All of the trials sought to reduce
the risk for infection rather than treat an acute or chronic illness. An
overview of the study characteristics is presented in Supplementary
table S1.
Three different outcomes relating to antibiotic use were described
in the included studies: the percentage of participants who were
prescribed antibiotics during the probiotic intervention period,
mean or median number of antibiotic prescriptions received by
subjects, and ‘mean number of days’ of antibiotic use. We note,
however, that the study authors did not always distinguish
between antibiotic prescriptions and consumption. A measure of
antibiotic use was a primary outcome in four studies16,17,22,25 and
a secondary outcome in nine studies.18–21,26–29,31 It was not explicitly
stated whether it was a primary or secondary outcome in an
additional four studies.11,23,24,30
Percentage of participants prescribed antibiotics
Of the 17 included RCTs in our systematic review, 12 reported the
number of infants/children prescribed antibiotics in the intervention
and control groups. In a meta-analysis, the overall relative risk of
being prescribed antibiotics in infants or children who received
probiotics (RR) compared to those who did not was 0.71 (95%
CI: 0.54–0.94; n = 3953; P = 0.02; figure 1). For patients with a hypo-
thetical baseline risk for receiving an antibiotic prescription of 25%,
the number needed to treat to avoid one prescription would be 13.8
(95% CI: 8.7–66.7).
There was a high level of statistical heterogeneity among the
studies (Tau2=0.15, Chi2P values=P < 0.001, I2=79%). When we
omitted one statistical outlier (Leyer et al. 2009)16 from the
analysis, the amount of statistical heterogeneity became negligible
(Tau2 = 0.00; Chi2 P values = 0.51; I2=0%) and the pooled RR of
antibiotic use was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.78–0.97; n = 3627; P = 0.01).
In a sensitivity analysis, we removed studies considered to have a
high risk of bias from the meta-analysis11,19,22,25,27,29,30 leaving five
studies.16,23,24,26,28 In this analysis, children who took probiotics
were less likely to receive antibiotics (RR 0.47 [95% CI: 0.23–
0.97], n = 2067, P = 0.04), but again there was a high level of statis-
tical
heterogeneity
among
the
studies
(Tau2=0.48;
Chi2
P
values=P < 0.001; I2=86%), which could be eliminated by the
exclusion of one statistical outlier (Leyer et al., 2009)16 from the
analysis. After this exclusion, the protective effect of probiotic sup-
plementation on antibiotic receipt in these four-remaining low risk-
of-bias studies is similar as that for the primary meta-analysis but
becomes statistically non-significant (RR 0.78 [95% CI: 0.60–1.01],
n = 1711, P = 0.06, Tau2=0.00; Chi2 P values = 0.49; I2=0%).
As the Merenstein et al. (2010) trial was a cluster-RCT, where
participants within each household were randomized as a unit, we
adjusted the data to account for a reported design effect of 1.05.
Mean or median number of antibiotic prescriptions
Two studies presented data on the mean or median number of
antibiotic prescriptions given to trial participants,17,21 but not
enough data were reported in one of the papers to calculate an
effect size, so pooling of the data from both studies via meta-
analysis could not be done. In this study, the authors reported
that the median number of antibiotic prescriptions received was
1 (25th to 75th percentiles: 1–3) in the probiotic group (n = 135)
496

 and 1 (0–2) in the placebo group (n = 134).21 Sufficient data were
reported in the other paper17 to calculate an effect size and
confidence intervals. The results revealed a statistically non-signifi-
cant difference between the average number of prescriptions given to
those infants and children who took probiotics compared with those
who received placebo (MD -0.05 [95% CI: �0.16 to 0.06], n = 201,
P = 0.36). However, the sample size was small and the confidence
intervals were wide. In addition, this study did not report the
percentage of children in each arm that received an antibiotic pre-
scription during the study period, so that it is unclear if there were
differences between the arms which may have confounded the
results.
Mean number of days of antibiotic use
Three studies reported on the mean number of days that antibiotics
were used.18,20,31 Meta-analysis did not demonstrate a significant
difference in days of antibiotic use between infants and children
who did and did not receive probiotics (MD -0.68 days [95% CI:
�1.57 to 0.21], n = 905; P = 0.13) (figure 2). None of these studies
reported if the patients took the full prescribed course or what the
prescription lengths were, so it is not clear if this data reflects pre-
scription length or consumption.
Risk of bias and overall quality of evidence
Five of the included studies were considered to have a low risk of
bias,16,20,23,24,26 and eight were considered to have a high risk of
bias,11,19,21,22,25,27,29,30 primarily because not all of the infants or
children who were randomized into each trial were included in
the study analyses, as would be required for a strict intention-to-
treat analysis. Four studies were considered to have an unclear risk of
bias due to a lack of reporting on the methods of randomization
sequence and/or allocation concealment.17,18,28,31 An overview of the
risk of bias for each trial is presented in Supplementary table S2.
The quality of evidence that contributed to each of the three
outcomes reported (i.e. the percentage of participants taking antibi-
otics during the treatment period; mean or median number of
antibiotic prescriptions received; and mean number of days with
antibiotic) was considered to be low using the GRADE system.
Discussion
This systematic review aimed to assess the impact of probiotic sup-
plementation (any strain, dose or duration), compared to placebo,
on antibiotic utilization for common acute infections in otherwise
healthy people of all ages. The most commonly reported outcome
was the incidence of infants and children who received an antibiotic
while consuming probiotics to reduce the risk for acute respiratory
and gastrointestinal infections. The results from our meta-analysis of
12 studies show a 29% relative risk reduction for being prescribed
antibiotics in people who consumed probiotics, while the 95% CI
indicates that the true relative risk reduction could plausibly be as
low as 6% or as high as 46% (pooled relative risk = 0.71, 95% CI:
0.54–0.94). The overall quality of the evidence for this outcome was,
however, low. A sensitivity analysis which included only those
studies with a low risk of bias (n = 5) also found a significant
effect in favour of probiotics (pooled relative risk = 0.47, 95% CI:
0.23–0.97).
In both of our analyses, a high level of statistical heterogeneity was
observed, but this was due to one statistical outlier.16 It is not clear
why the trial results in this study were outlying, as it is similar to the
others in terms of study population, intervention and duration,
except that it was the only study conducted in China, where differ-
ences in environment, diet, study conduct or other factors may have
contributed to the unusually strong effects observed. It could also
reflect different prescribing practices and policies in the study
country compared to others, but this remains unclear (Leyer pers.
comm.).

 The data on ‘mean or median number of prescriptions’ or ‘mean
number of days of antibiotic use’ were not very informative for our
purposes, because few studies reported these outcomes and details
were not well described. For example, the durations of prescribed
antibiotic courses were not reported in those studies that evaluated
the average number of days of antibiotic use to infants and children
who did and did not receive probiotics.
There are some limitations to our main finding. The majority of
the trials did not explicitly state whether or not the antibiotics
prescribed were for the acute infections evaluated within each
study, if they were also prescribed for other reasons, or if subjects
were compliant with the prescribed course of antibiotic. Therefore,
although these randomized studies show a difference in rates of
antibiotic prescriptions, it is not clear if this represents a causal
link between probiotic use, decreased incidence and severity of
infection, and reduced antibiotic use. In addition, only four of
the 17 trials included in this review, evaluated antibiotic use as a
primary outcome, so that many of the results may be considered
as chance observations. Furthermore, all studies that met our
eligibility
criteria
were
conducted
in
infants
and
children.
Although there are studies of probiotics for acute common respira-
tory infections in adults,32–40 none reported antibiotic use as an
outcome, so we are unable to extrapolate our results beyond
infants and children.
Probiotic consumption may be associated with reduced antibiotic
prescribing for several reasons. First, probiotics have been shown to
reduce the risk for common illnesses.10 If fewer common infections
occur,
there
are
fewer
physician
visits
and
therefore,
fewer
opportunities for antibiotics to be prescribed. Second, probiotic con-
sumption has been shown to reduce duration of symptoms.12 If an
infection resolves more quickly, there is a good probability that a
person will seek less medical care, reducing the opportunity for an
antibiotic to be prescribed. Third, probiotic consumption may simply
be a replacement for antibiotics as patients and clinicians manage self-
limited illnesses. Indeed, much antibiotic prescribing for common
acute infections is likely unnecessary and may be a response to
social and emotional factors,41–44 not medical ones. For example, a
meta-analysis designed to engage children in addition to parents was
effective in decreasing prescribing by 13–40%,45 while a systematic
review found parent education with clinician behaviour change
decreased antibiotic prescribing rates by 6–21%.46 This is compared
to the 29% decrease we observed among infants in children. The
recommendation to take a probiotic may offer an intervention that
can fulfil the need to ‘‘do something’’.
Antibiotic
overuse
contributes
to
antibiotic
resistance.16–18
Probiotic consumption may directly and indirectly reduce such a
burden. Our results suggest that further research in this area may
be important. If studies that specifically evaluate the impact of
probiotic consumption on antibiotic use consistently demonstrate
an impact, the potential public health implications could be
significant.
Summary and conclusions
Infants and children who are given probiotics (Lactobacillus and
Bifidobacterium strains) to reduce the risk for acute respiratory
tract infections and acute lower digestive tract infections, have a
statistically significantly lower relative risk of being prescribed anti-
biotics (Pooled Relative Risk = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.54–0.94). When
restricted to studies with a low risk of bias, the pooled relative risk
was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.23–0.97). Significant statistical heterogeneity
was present in effect size estimates, which appeared to be due to
one outlier.
Probiotics, provided to reduce the risk for common acute
infections in infants and children, may be associated with reduced
antibiotic use. Additional well-designed studies, preferably RCTs of
healthy individuals, are needed to substantiate these findings in
children and explore similar findings in other population groups.

Key points
� Evidence suggests that probiotic supplementation reduces
episodes of common infectious diseases including respira-
tory tract infections and diarrhea
� Infants and children given probiotics to avoid or reduce the
risk for certain infections have a 29% lower relative risk of
being prescribed antibiotics. For patients with a 25% risk of
being prescribed, the number needed to treat to avoid one
prescription is 13.8.
� Probiotic consumption may be a replacement for antibiotics
as patients and clinicians manage self-limited illnesses
