Mortality due to low-quality health systems in the universal 
health coverage era: a systematic analysis of amenable 
deaths in 137 countries

Summary
Background Universal health coverage has been proposed as a strategy to improve health in low-income and middle-
income countries (LMICs). However, this is contingent on the provision of good-quality health care. We estimate the 
excess mortality for conditions targeted in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that are amenable to health care 
and the portion of this excess mortality due to poor-quality care in 137 LMICs, in which excess mortality refers to 
deaths that could have been averted in settings with strong health systems.
Methods Using data from the 2016 Global Burden of Disease study, we calculated mortality amenable to personal 
health care for 61 SDG conditions by comparing case fatality between each LMIC with corresponding numbers from 
23 high-income reference countries with strong health systems. We used data on health-care utilisation from 
population surveys to separately estimate the portion of amenable mortality attributable to non-utilisation of health 
care versus that attributable to receipt of poor-quality care.
Findings 15·6 million excess deaths from 61 conditions occurred in LMICs in 2016. After excluding deaths that could 
be prevented through public health measures, 8·6 million excess deaths were amenable to health care of which 
5·0 million were estimated to be due to receipt of poor-quality care and 3·6 million were due to non-utilisation of 
health care. Poor quality of health care was a major driver of excess mortality across conditions, from cardiovascular 
disease and injuries to neonatal and communicable disorders.
Interpretation Universal health coverage for SDG conditions could avert 8·6 million deaths per year but only if 
expansion of service coverage is accompanied by investments into high-quality health systems.

Introduction
Universal health coverage (UHC) has been embraced by 
global organisations such as WHO and the World Bank 
as a means to improve health and reduce the finan­
cial burden from receiving care. UHC is a central plank 
of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the 
ambitious new development targets that were signed by 
193 UN member states to improve health and dev­
elopment by 2030.1 Although financing and imple­
mentation of UHC will differ by country, the common 
definition is the ability of all people to obtain good­quality 
services when they need them without facing financial 
hardship.2
Supporters of UHC have promoted it as a means for 
improving population health.3 These supporters theor­
ise that expanding health insurance would promote 
the utili 
sation of health services that reduce mortality 
and morbidity. However, although insurance generally 
increases use of services, evidence on mortality re­
ductions is mixed. Escobar and colleagues4 found that 
health insurance was associated with improved health 
status in only three of nine studies in low­income and 
middle­income countries (LMICs; from Vietnam, China, 
and Brazil). In the USA, coverage has been associated 
with better self­reported health status and in one recent 
study,5 with reduced mortality. The lack of consistent 
evidence on health benefits from insurance coverage 
might be in part due to methodological challenges 
because mortality is multifactorial and subject to factors 
outside of health care; people purchasing insurance 
are more unwell on average, and deaths are relatively 
rare and require large studies to measure their pre­
valence. However, insurance expansion might also be 
un 
successful in improving outcomes if no effective 
treatment is available for a given condition or if quality of 
care is poor.
In low­income countries, evidence is emerging that 
expanding health care coverage does not necessarily 
result in better outcomes, even for conditions highly 
amenable to medical care. A large programme called 
Janani Suraksha Yojana, that was set up 13 years ago in 
India, has provided cash incentives for women to deliver 
their children in health facilities and has increased 
coverage of facility birth for more than 50 million 
women, but these incentives have not improved mater­
nal or newborn survival.6,7 Many of the births in this

programme occurred in primary care centres that did not 
have sufficiently skilled staff to address maternal and 
newborn complications.8 Similarly, low quality of care for 
mothers and children has been documented in primary 
care facilities in Africa and in India.9–11 Researchers have 
also found large deficiencies in quality of hospital care 
for surgical conditions, obstetric care, and care of 
tuberculosis,12–14 whereas other studies15 have shown large 
differences between treatment and successful control of 
blood pressure.15
The evidence of poor­quality health care challenges the 
assumption that increasing utilisation of health services 
will be sufficient to reduce mortality in lower­income 
countries. However, to date, there have not been any 
studies quantifying the potential role of better­quality 
services versus greater coverage in reducing mortality for 
conditions amenable to medical care. This report will 
estimate the excess deaths amenable to health care in 
LMICs and the relative contributions of non­utilisation 
of health­care services and receipt of poor­quality care to 
these deaths.
Methods
Overview
Broadly, we estimated excess mortality for SDG conditions 
amenable to health care, after excluding deaths that 
could be prevented through public health and other inter­
ventions outside the health system. To estimate amenable 
mortality in LMICs, we compared mortality by age and sex 
groups in each country with corresponding mortality 
from a reference group of 23 high­income countries 
with strong universal health coverage and good health 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Although amenable mortality has been estimated and discussed 
in high-income countries for several decades, the concept has 
only recently been extended to low-income countries. 
We searched PubMed for the terms “amenable mortality” and 
“quality” for studies published in English from 1990–2018 and 
reviewed citations in relevant articles. Nolte and McKee have 
developed the concept of amenable mortality to estimate the 
number of deaths that could be averted by health care in 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
countries. In 2016, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) group 
extended this concept to low-income and middle-income 
countries (LMICs) and developed an access and quality index to 
compare performance. Multicountry studies, such as those by 
Souza and colleagues and Biccard and colleagues, have shown 
that in some LMICs mortality is higher for people receiving care 
in facilities than in high-income countries, even after adjusting 
for morbidity. Alkire and colleagues found that worldwide 
8 million deaths were amenable to health care, resulting in 
estimated welfare losses of US$6·0 trillion to LMICs in 2015.
Added value of this study
This study reports the number of deaths amenable to health 
care in LMICs and is the first to estimate the proportion of these 
deaths due to poor quality of care versus non-utilisation of care. 
This finding has important policy implications for countries 
pursuing universal health coverage as increased access to poor 
quality of care is unlikely to improve health outcomes. Our study 
found that nearly 8 million people die every year because of a 
lack of access to high-quality care. We found a higher proportion 
of amenable deaths are among health system users than 
non-users in LMICs. Deaths caused by poor-quality health 
care spanned the conditions included in the Sustainable 
Development Goals, including cardiovascular diseases, neonatal 
conditions and road traffic accidents. Although the 2016 GBD 
study did not report numbers of amenable deaths or partition 
these deaths into the separate contributions of quality of care 
and utilisation, it did observe substantial disparities in amenable 
mortality across regions and related to levels of development.
Implications of all the available evidence
Although our findings cannot be directly compared to the study 
by Nolte and McKee because the conditions they reported were 
different in high-income settings, the authors made different 
adjustments for public health interventions, and the settings of 
care were much better resourced than in many countries in our 
study, and they found that mortality in 21% of men and 30% of 
women under the age of 75 years is amenable to good health 
care; the corresponding figure from our study is 56% (all 
amenable deaths/avertable deaths). 
The 2016 GBD paper concluded that despite progress since 1990, 
improved access to care and quality of care received has a large 
potential for improving outcomes in low-income and 
middle-income countries, although there is a large and growing 
heterogeneity of performance across countries. Specifically, 
although many countries lag behind peers in their income group, 
some middle-income countries with recent health system 
reforms appear to be realising outsized health gains. Our 
estimate that 55% of all avertable mortality for Sustainable 
Development Goal conditions can be addressed by good health 
care is somewhat higher than the Nolte and McKee study 
estimates and suggests that health systems are just as crucial for 
overall mortality reduction in lower-income countries as they are 
in high-income countries. Our paper uniquely estimates the 
portion of amenable mortality due to non-utilisation of available 
care versus utilisation of poor quality of care. We conclude that 
access is no longer the only binding constraint for improving 
survival in LMICs—health system quality must be improved 
simultaneously. This is particularly trenchant as countries embark 
on universal health coverage, which has been characterised in 
terms of improved coverage and reduced financial risk. Our work, 
in combination with past research, shows that improving health 
system quality is an immediate priority if countries hope to 
succeed in reaching the third Sustainable Development Goal.

outcomes (appendix p 17). We then apportioned amenable 
mortality into two components: deaths due to poor quality 
of care (in those who used health­care services) and those 
due to non­utilisation of health care.
Parameter selection
We first identified conditions for which personal health 
care plays an important role in reducing mortality. We 
began with the list of conditions identified by Nolte and 
McKee16 as amenable to health care, and further included 
conditions in SDG Target 3 (improved health)17 for which 
risk of death can be reduced by use of personal health 
care and does not require advanced technology, result­
ing in identification of 61 conditions in total. Because 
low­income countries might not have the resources to 
guarantee care for all 61 conditions, we also analysed a 
more limited subset of 41 highest priority conditions that 
require relatively basic interventions (appendix p 3). We 
applied established age ranges for which the health 
system could reasonably avert deaths from each con­
dition.18–20 Table 1 lists the 61 included conditions and 
age ranges.
In assigning amenable deaths to poor quality versus 
non­utilisation, we assumed that once users seek care in 
the health system, correct management and retention in 
care is the system’s responsibility. Retention in care 
(ie, repeat utilisation) is a frequently used measure of 
health system quality for conditions that require a course 
of continuous care, such as HIV and non­communicable 
diseases as well as immunisation.21–23 Because condition­
specific utilisation measures were not available for all 
61 conditions in LMICs, we used population utilisation 
data for conditions with similar clinical features and level 
of acuity.24 For conditions such as neonatal HIV and 
vaccine preventable diseases, the health system can 
prevent all incidental cases when people seek preventive 
care. We used receipt of at least one vaccine as the 
utilisation measure for most vaccine preventable con­
ditions. For conditions that arise acutely and can be 
treated or cured with episodic care (eg, pneumonia, 
appendicitis, or road injuries), we used care­seeking for 
the corresponding acute illness. Birth with a skilled 
attendant was used for maternal and newborn com­
plications. Finally, for chronic conditions such as diabetes 
mellitus that should be screened for or detected when 
people at risk seek routine care we used health facility 
visit in the past year. We used condition­specific utilisa­
tion data for tuberculosis, HIV, cancer, and mental health 
(appendix pp 6–7).
Data sources
Incidence, prevalence, and mortality by cause were 
obtained from the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD) 
2016 in 5­year age groups by sex for each country.20,25,26 
Population sizes were obtained from the World Bank.27
Health care utilisation data were obtained from house­
hold population surveys and global estimates including 
the World Health Surveys, Demographic and Health 
surveys, UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, 
World Mental Health Surveys, and Joint United Nations 
Programme on HIV
/AIDS and World Development 
Indicators databases in the most recent years available 
(appendix p 5). For countries for which utilisation data 
were not available, we imputed values on the basis of 
known factors that affect utili 
sation.28–31 We regressed 
utilisation for each condition by gross domestic product 
per capita, percent of population living in rural areas, 
female literacy rate, land area, numbers of doctors and 
nurses or midwives per patient, and GBD study region 
on the basis of geography and epidemiology.31 On 
average, these variables explained 59% of the variation 
in utilisation across conditions. We then predicted 
missing utilisation values using a generalised linear 
model with a binomial link to constrain the values to 
between 0 and 100%. Additional details on imputation 
are reported in the appendix (p 8).
Statistical analysis
Avertable mortality was defined as the sum of preven­
table deaths—ie, those that could be averted through 
public health and other population­level public health 
or intersectoral policies that prevent the disease or 
condition in the first place—and amenable deaths—
ie, those deaths that could be averted by health care once 
a condition occurs. This distinction is approximate, as 
well­functioning primary care can also contribute to 
primary prevention (eg, by treating hypertension before 
it causes ischaemic heart disease). In some cases, such 
as vaccine­preventable diseases, health systems are the 
predominant means of primary prevention.
To estimate amenable mortality, we compared case 
fatality (CF) for LMICs against a reference case 
fatality (CFref) from best performing countries. The CF 
was calculated as the cause­specific deaths divided by 
individuals at risk or incident or prevalent cases of 
that condition as applicable (appendix p 5). To reduce the 
influence of spurious values on our results, observations 
were dropped in countries that had fewer than ten deaths 
across all age groups by sex except those in the best 
performer reference group. When a CF was greater 
than 1 for a particular age group by sex, we replaced it with 
the disease’s country average CF. Finally, CFs three SDs 
over the age mean for that sex were treated as outliers and 
truncated.
Countries in the best performer reference group were 
23 high­income countries that scored 90 or greater on 
a recent UHC index that combines coverage of inter­
ventions and risk­standardised mortality for conditions 
amenable to personal health care (appendix p 15),32,33 
and the reference CF was computed as the average 
across the reference countries. For conditions for which 
deaths were entirely preventable within the health 
system, case fatality was calculated as deaths divided by 
total population at risk.

Amenable mortality was computed as mortality in excess 
of what would be expected relative to the reference 
case fatality level, after first accounting for preventable 
mortality—ie, excluding deaths among incident or 
prevalent cases that should have been prevented by 
population level interventions. We adjusted deaths for 
prevention by comparing incidence or prevalence in 
LMICs with incidence or prevalence in the reference 
group. The proportion of cases that could be prevented 
was indicated by calculating the ratio of incidence or 
prevalence of a given condition in the reference group 
compared with each country. If the incidence or prevalence 
ratio was less than one (ie, lower incidence in reference 
group than in the case group) as expected, we multiplied 
the ratio by the number of cases to calculate the adjusted 
(lower) number of cases. When the ratio was greater 
than 1, cases were unadjusted. Deaths due to conditions 
preventable within the health system rather than through 
public health measures (ie, neonatal HIV, vaccine­
preventable conditions, and tuberculosis) were unadjusted. 
Formally, excess mortality in LMICs amenable to personal 
health care was calculated as follows:
for age group i, sex j, and country k, where CF is 
case fatality, Casesadj is the cases that remain after ex­
cluding those that could be prevented though public 
health intervention, and CFref is the reference case 
fatality level.

To estimate the relative contributions of poor quality of 
care and non­utilisation of health care to amenable 
mortality, we did a second analysis that partitioned 
mortality into deaths among health system users and 
among non­users.
To estimate the counterfactual mortality that would be 
expected if all people who currently utilise health services 
received high quality care, we assumed that service users 
would have CF equivalent to the reference CF levels. 
Non­user CF is likely to be greater than the country’s 
average CF but non­user CFs are not observed and are 
not directly inferable from GBD study results. Therefore, 
to estimate a CF for non­users we sought a plausible 
upper bound observed CF from the same epidemiological 
region (those considered poor performers). First, we 
computed the average CF across age group and sex 
groups for each cause in every country. Next, we identified 
the 75th percentile CF within each region for each cause. 
For any country with a CF below the 75th percentile, we 
computed a ratio of the 75th percentile CF to the CF of 
the country, and then multiplied this ratio by each of the 
country’s age­group specific CFs by sex to yield the 
estimated CF for non­users specific to age and sex. Ratios 
above 3 were deemed implausible and capped, affecting 
5·2% of observations. Subtracting this counterfactual 
from total mortality (less the portion preventable through 
public health intervention, as above), we derived the 
excess mortality among people utilising the health­care 
system (ie, mortality due to poor­quality services):
for which util is the utilisation of services, CFratio is the 
ratio of the 75th percentile CF mortality in the region to 
the country’s average mortality for each age group by sex, 
and all other variables are as defined above. Mortality 
caused by non­utilisation is calculated as:
We divided poor­quality mortality by the country’s total 
population to calculate the proportion of mortality due to 
poor­quality services. We multiplied the poor­quality 
mortality within each age group within sex by the 
corresponding GBD study standard life expectancy for 
that group to estimate years of life lost (YLL), assuming 
that the average age at death was at the midpoint of a 
given interval. We calculated preventable mortality and 
mortality caused by non­utilisation of services or by use of 
poor­quality services in LMICs by GBD region and 
condition type by summing across countries and age 
bands by sex. Uncertainty intervals were estimated by 
using the upper and lower bounds on the uncertain 
ty 
intervals for death estimates from the 2016 GBD study. As 
a simplifying approximation for the aggregate uncertainty 
in the presence of unknown correlations between es­
timation errors for age groups by sex, causes, and 
countries, we estimated uncertainty bounds for mortality 
totals by treating estimation errors as fully correlated 
between age and sex groups for a given cause in a coun­
try, but treating errors as independent across countries 
and diseases.
We conducted several sensitivity analyses. As a high­
income reference group might not be a feasible standard 
of comparison for some LMICs, we used four countries 
identified by the Commission on Investing in Health as 
best performing middle­income countries (China, Cuba, 
Costa Rica, and Chile) as the reference group.34 The 
incidence ratio approach to account for mortality that 
could be prevented by public health (ie, outside the health 
system) also removes deaths that can be averted through 
primary care (eg, proper hypertension manage 
ment can 
reduce myocardial infarction risk). As an alternative 
approach, we adjusted mortality for different underlying 
frequencies of risk factors by applying the joint population 
attributable fraction of behavioural, environmental, and 
occupational risks for disease. This approach standardises 
disease risk across countries.33 Because the data on service 
utilisation from World Health Surveys were from 2002–03, 
we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we increased 
utili 
sation prevalence to the next highest income group to 
more closely approximate current service utilisation (eg, 
low­income countries were given the average utilisation 
prevalence for lower­middle income countries). Finally, as 
an alternative to using so­called poor performer CFs for 
the mortality among non­users of the health system we 
assumed that non­users would simply face the country’s 
observed prevailing CF.
All analyses were done in Stata version 14.1. We 
mapped mortality due to poor­quality services across 
LMICs using QGIS version 2.14.

Results
Of the 19·3 million total deaths in 2016 in LMICs 
from the 61 specific causes and age groups considered 
in this study, we estimated that there were 15·6 million 
avertable deaths in LMICs (95% uncertainty inter­
val [UI] 15·4–15·9 million), including 7·0 million 
deaths preventable through public health intervention 
(UI 6·8–7·2 million), and 8·6 million amenable to health 
care (UI 8·5–8·8 million). The amenable deaths should 
be viewed as a conservative estimate because some deaths 
currently counted under preventable could have been

averted through primary prevention in the health system. 
Of the excess deaths amenable to health care, an estimated 
3·6 million were due to non­utilisation of health care 
services (UI 3·5–3·7 million), and 5·0 million were due to 
poor quality of available care (UI 4·9–5·2 million). 
224 million YLL (UI 219–230 million) were due to poor 
quality of available care.
South Asia had the greatest mortality due to use of 
poor­quality health care at 1·9 million deaths (39% of 
global poor­quality service access mortality; table 2). 
Central Europe and Latin America had the highest 
percentage of amenable mortality due to receipt of poor­
quality health services, whereas sub­Saharan Africa had 
the lowest, where a greater percentage were due to non­
utilisation of services. Country results are available in 
the appendix (pp 9–13). Figure 1 maps mortality due to 
poor quality per 100 000 population. Poor­quality health 
care contributed to the most deaths per unit popula­
tion in South Asia and central and west Africa. The 
total LMIC poor­quality mortality was 82 deaths per 
100 000 population.
Figure 2 presents the mortality due to access to poor­
quality services and non­utilisation of health services by 
condition type. Cardiovascular disease deaths made up 
33% (2 817 000) of the amenable deaths in the total health 
system, of which 84% (2 358 000) were caused by use of 
poor­quality health services. After cardiovascular disease, 
deaths from neonatal conditions, tuberculosis, and road 
injuries comprised the most amenable deaths, with a 
total of 1·5 million deaths due to use of poor­quality 
services and 1·2 million deaths due to non­utilisation of 
health services. Only 11% (53 000 of 477 000) of amenable 
cancer deaths and 15% (69 000 of 455 000) of amenable 
mental and neurological deaths were due to use of poor­
quality health care, reflecting the low utilisation of health 
services for these conditions (appendix p 14).
In our sensitivity analyses, adjusting mortality by the 
population attributable fraction due to environmental and 
behavioural risk factors to exclude deaths preventable by 
public health or other upstream interventions as opposed 
to our reference base case approach based on adjust­
ing incidence or prevalence to reference levels in high 
performing countries, yielded 7·0 million amenable 
deaths of which 4·4 million were due to use of poor­quality 
health services and 2·6 million were due to non­utilisation 
of health services (appendix pp 3–4). Considering the full 
disease burden that health sys 
tems face today—ie, without 
subtracting deaths that were potentially preventable 
outside the health system—13·3 million deaths were 
amenable to health care, 7·6 million from use of poor­
quality health care and 5·7 million from non­utilisation of 
any health service. Comparison with a best performing 
middle­income country reference group, rather than our 
base case reference standard from high­income countries, 
resulted in 3·2 million deaths due to use of poor­quality 
services and 2·4 million to non­utilisation of health 
care. Restricting the UHC package to a narrower set of 
conditions reduced the number of avertable deaths to

Avertable mortality was defined as the sum of preventable deaths (averted through public health and other population-level intersectoral policies or interventions that prevent the disease or condition in the 
first place) and amenable deaths (averted by health care once a condition occurs). Amenable deaths comprised deaths due to use of poor-quality services and deaths due to non-utilisation of health services.

14·4 million (4·7 million due to poor­quality services and 
2·8 million due to non­utilisation of services). Adjusting 
the World Health Surveys data on service utilisation to 
account for increases since 2002–03 resulted in a larger 
difference between non­utilisation of services (3·3 million, 
UI 3·2–3·4 million) and access to poor­quality services 
(5·3 million, UI 5·2–5·4 million). Assuming that the non­
utilisation population and the population that utilised 
services had the same CF, we found that 5·7 million 
deaths were due to use of poor­quality services and 
2·9 million deaths due to non­utilisation of services.
Discussion
8·6 million people in LMICs die from causes amenable 
to health care; of these, 5 million are people who have 
used the health system but received poor­quality health 
care. This is five times higher than all global deaths from 
HIV or AIDS and over three times higher than all deaths 
from diabetes. Deaths attributable to receipt of poor­
quality health care constitute 58% of all amenable 
mortality in these countries. Because deaths in LMICs 
occur at younger ages, poor quality of health care takes a 
large toll on YLL: 224 million in the study countries. The 
estimate of amenable mortality is conservative since 
some deaths currently counted under preventable could 
have been averted in the health system through primary 
prevention of the condition.
Few comparison studies are currently available. A 2017 
paper by the GBD collaborators33 compared health systems 
by use of a similar approach but did not report on deaths. 
The authors noted large gaps between observed health 
system performance in many countries and the best 
performing comparators. Alkire and colleagues36 reported 
amenable mortality of 8 million deaths for 38 con 
ditions in 
198 countries, 96·3% of which occurred in LMICs, using 
somewhat different methods (reducing amen 
able mor 
tality 
by attributable risk factors rather than differences in 
incidence). They estimated that this mortality would result 
in US$11·2 trillion in lost economic output between 2015 
and 2020 in LMICs.36 Nolte and McKee have tracked deaths 
due to conditions amenable to timely and effective health 
care in Europe and other Organisation for Economic Co­
operation and Development countries for the past 
15 years.37–39 Our findings cannot be directly compared with 
their work because we adjusted incidence or prevalence for 
all conditions to exclude deaths that could have been 
prevented outside the health system, whereas Nolte and 
McKee only exclude a portion (50% of cardiovascular 
deaths). However, they found that 21% of mortality under 
age 75 for men and 30% for women is amenable to good­
quality health care; the corresponding figure from our 
study is 55% (all amenable deaths of those that were 
avertable), suggesting that poor­quality health systems are 
a greater impediment to improved population health in 
poor than in rich countries.

Given the global focus on UHC, we designated deaths 
in people who presented to the health system but were 
not properly managed or retained in health care as deaths 
due to receipt of poor­quality health care and deaths in 
those who did not use care for each illness as deaths due 
to non­utilisation of services. We found that across 
LMICs, poor quality contributed to more deaths than 
non­utilisation of services, (5·0 million poor­quality 
health care vs 3·6 million non­utilisation of services). 
Poor quality was a larger driver of mortality than non­
utilisation of services in 14 of 17 geographic regions and 
115 of 137 countries, including in many of the poorest 
regions with high mortality. Countries at different levels 
of development will adopt different UHC packages that 
might not include all of the conditions assessed here. 
However, this does not lessen the importance of quality 
of care: our modeling shows that if low­income countries 
fund only less advanced care, poor­quality services will 
account for almost two­thirds of the amenable deaths. 
Multicountry studies support the finding that mortality 
in LMICs for people using health­care services sub­
stantially exceeds that in higher­income countries.13,40
Poor quality was an important driver of amenable 
mortality across conditions, including 84% of cardio­
vascular mortality; 81% of vaccine preventable diseases; 
61% of neonatal conditions; and half of deaths from 
maternal causes, road injury, tuberculosis, HIV, and 
other infectious diseases. Averting deaths from cancer, 
congenital defects, mental health, and chronic respiratory 
conditions will require major efforts to boost utilisation 
of services along with improved quality. These figures 
can provide insights about potential policy directions for 
countries. The breadth of conditions for which poor­
quality health care contributes to excess mortality 
suggests that health system­wide improvement is needed 
rather than disease­specific quality interventions.
As lower­income countries undergo demographic and 
epidemiological transitions, they will need to implement 
public health measures and strengthen the quality of 
health systems to continue to reduce mortality. After 
several decades of health gains in infectious diseases and 
child health, the residual mortality in LMICs is comprised 
of more complex and multimorbid conditions. Our 
study provides evidence that even in settings where 
progress has been made on UHC, deaths due to poor­
quality services represent a substantial challenge. From a 
financing standpoint, underperforming health systems 
reduce the returns on UHC investments. However, 
when coupled with investments in health system quality, 
expanding insurance can result in major health gains 
as shown by Thailand, Rwanda, and Costa Rica, which 
have pursued this dual strategy and achieved sub­
stantial improvements in survival in child and maternal 
health.34,41,42
Our study has several limitations. The incidence, 
prevalence, and mortality specific to cause, age, and sex 
come from the GBD, which has known limitations in 
estimates, particularly for causes of death in LMICs with 
weak or non­existent vital registration systems.33 Even in 
systems with strong vital registration systems, records 
can misidentify the underlying causes of death. The GBD 
group conducts extensive corrections to underlying data 
to address these. Comorbidity and disease history could 
be different between LMICs and high­income countries, 
which can result in some bias. Our approach for adjusting 
for primary prevention, which subtracts these deaths 
before the reference CF is applied, maximises preventable 
mortality while reducing amenable mortality. We did this 
to prioritise primary prevention, which is cheaper and 
often more effective than treatment. Some deaths that are 
currently categorised as preventable could have been 
averted through primary prevention in the health system. 
Our analysis does not measure morbidity so under­
estimates the effects of poor­quality health care on overall 
health. The last three points suggest that our conclusions 
about the health impact of poor­quality health systems are 
a conservative assessment.
An important limitation of our analysis is that data 
on health care utilisation were not complete for all 
conditions and countries. For conditions in which 
utilisation of service data were not available we used 
information for similar conditions and in countries 
where data were missing we imputed values based on 
factors known to affect utilisation of services. This 
is an imperfect approach but consistent with current 
literature.43 These data gaps mean that for some con­
ditions, particularly those that have only recently been 
recognised as global health priorities, such as mental 
health, cancer, and road injury, our estimates of the roles 
of quality and utilisation of services should be considered 
as provisional and need to be updated when better data 
become available. Mortality for non­users of health 
services was not directly available in the data—we applied 
a correction to address this. However, all sensitivity 
analyses supported the conclusion that poor­quality 
health care is a larger driver of amenable mortality 
than utilisation of services. Finally, our character 
isation 
of uncertainty around estimates is imperfect, given 
that some sources of uncertainty were not included, 
and aggregate level uncertainty depends on correlations 
between estimation errors for constituent parts, which 
were difficult to quantify. Collectively, these limitations 
call attention to the need for better data on mortality and 
health system use in LMICs, which will be essential for 
countries’ efforts to track progress on UHC and other 
health goals.
What do the results mean for countries pursuing UHC? 
Each country will chart its own course on UHC, with 
benefit packages reflecting health priorities and available 
resources. However, the central role of quality is not yet 
sufficiently recognised in the global discourse on UHC 
and is underappreciated in many countries. An important 
starting point is better measurement of health system 
quality. Some countries are attempting to incorporate this

into their UHC efforts. For example, South Africa 
has begun a nationwide Ideal Clinic programme and 
Tanzania has used a star­rating system to measure quality 
of primary care.44 These results are being used to identify 
entry points for health­system improvement. Our analysis 
shows that at all levels of development and across 
different scopes of insured services, poor quality of care 
will limit the mortality reduction possible from greater 
coverage. Countries pursing UHC must put better quality 
on par with expanded coverage if they are to substantially 
improve health.
