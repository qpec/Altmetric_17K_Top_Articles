ABSTRACT 
31 
The architectural and morphological adaptations of the hamstrings in response to training 
32 
with different exercises have not been explored. PURPOSE: To evaluate changes in biceps 
33 
femoris long head (BFLH) fascicle length and hamstring muscle size following 10-weeks of 
34 
Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE) or hip extension (HE) training. METHODS: Thirty 
35 
recreationally active male athletes (age, 22.0 ± 3.6 years, height, 180.4 ± 7 cm, weight, 80.8 ± 
36 
11.1 kg) were allocated to one of three groups: 1) HE training (n=10), NHE training (n=10), 
37 
or no training (CON) (n=10). BFLH fascicle length was assessed before, during (Week 5) and 
38 
after the intervention with 2D-ultrasound. Hamstring muscle size was determined before and 
39 
after training via magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Compared to baseline, BFLH 
40 
fascicles were lengthened in the NHE and HE groups at mid- (d = 1.12 – 1.39, p < 0.001) and 
41 
post-training (d = 1.77 – 2.17, p < 0.001) and these changes did not differ significantly (d = 
42 
0.49 – 0.80, p = 0.279 – 0.976). BFLH volume increased more for the HE than the NHE (d = 
43 
1.03, p = 0.037) and CON (d = 2.24, p < 0.001) groups. Compared to the CON group, both 
44 
exercises induced significant increases in semitendinosus volume (d = 2.16 – 2.50, ≤ 0.002) 
45 
and these increases were not significantly different (d = 0.69, p = 0.239). CONCLUSION: 
46 
NHE and HE training both stimulate significant increases in BFLH fascicle length, however, 
47 
HE training may be more effective for promoting hypertrophy in the BFLH.

What are the new findings? 
 Hip extension and Nordic hamstring exercise training both promote the elongation of 
biceps femoris long head fascicles, and stimulate improvements in eccentric knee 
flexor strength. 
 
 Hip extension training promotes more hypertrophy in the biceps femoris long head 
and semimembranosus than the Nordic hamstring exercise, which preferentially 
develops the semitendinosus and the short head of biceps femoris.

INTRODUCTION 
58 
Hamstring ‘tears’ are endemic in sports involving high-speed running and upwards of 80% of 
59 
these injuries involve the biceps femoris long head (BFLH).[1-4] Hamstring strains represent 
60 
the most common injury in athletics,[5] Australian Rules football,[6 7] and soccer[8] and as 
61 
many as 30% reoccur within 12 months.[9] These findings highlight the need for improved 
62 
hamstring injury prevention programs while also suggesting the possibility that these 
63 
programs should specifically target the BFLH. 
64 
There has been significant interest in exploring the patterns of muscle activity in hamstring 
65 
exercises,[10-15] however there is no research examining the architectural and morphological 
66 
adaptations of these muscles to different exercise interventions. The Nordic hamstring 
67 
exercise (NHE) has proven effective in increasing eccentric knee flexor strength[16] and 
68 
reducing hamstring injuries[17-19] in soccer, although there is disagreement in the literature 
69 
as to which hamstring muscles are most active during this exercise[10 14 15 20]. We have 
70 
previously reported that the NHE preferentially activates the semitendinosus (ST),[10 15] 
71 
however, we have also observed high levels of BFLH activity in this exercise[15] which 
72 
suggests that it may still provide a powerful stimulus for adaptation within this most 
73 
commonly injured muscle.[1-4] Eccentric exercise has been proposed to increase muscle 
74 
fascicle lengths via sarcomerogenesis[21 22] and Timmins and colleagues[23] have recently 
75 
observed such an adaptation after eccentric knee flexor training on an isokinetic 
76 
dynamometer while also noting that concentric training caused fascicle shortening despite 
77 
occurring at long muscle lengths. Furthermore, we have recently reported that soccer players 
78 
with shorter BFLH fascicles (<10.56cm) were at fourfold greater risk of hamstring strain 
79 
injury than players with longer fascicles.[23] Given the effectiveness of the predominantly 
80 
eccentric NHE in hamstring injury prevention and rehabilitation,[17-19] it is of interest to 
81 
 5 
 
examine the impact of this and alternative exercises on BFLH fascicle lengths and 
82 
morphology.  
83 
We have recently observed that the 45° hip extension (HE) exercise resulted in more uniform 
84 
activation of the two-joint hamstrings and greater BFLH activity than the NHE[15]. HE 
85 
exercises are also performed at longer hamstring muscle lengths than the NHE and it has 
86 
been suggested that this may make them more effective in hamstring injury prevention than 
87 
the NHE.[24] However, HE and most other hamstring exercises are typically performed with 
88 
both eccentric and concentric phases and it remains to be seen how the combination of 
89 
contraction modes will affect fascicle length by comparison with an almost purely eccentric 
90 
exercise like the NHE. Nevertheless, the greater activation of BFLH during HE[10 15] may 
91 
provide a greater stimulus for hypertrophy, which might have implications for rehabilitation 
92 
practices given observations of persistent atrophy in this muscle following injury.[25]  
93 
The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate changes in BFLH architecture and 
94 
hamstring muscle volume and anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA) following 10-week 
95 
resistance training programs consisting exclusively of NHE or HE training. We tested the 
96 
hypotheses that 1) HE training would stimulate greater increases in BFLH fascicle length than 
97 
the NHE, on the basis of the suggestion that the ‘elongation stress’ in hamstring exercises 
98 
may be an important factor in triggering this adaptation[24]; 2) HE training would promote 
99 
more BFLH hypertrophy than the NHE; and 3) the NHE would result in more hypertrophy of 
100 
the ST muscle than the HE exercise.

METHODS 
103 
Participants 
104 
Thirty recreationally active males (age, 22.0± 3.6 years, height, 180.4 ± 7 cm, weight, 80.8 ± 
105 
 
11.1 kg) provided written informed consent to participate in this study. Participants 
106 
were free from soft tissue and orthopaedic injuries to the trunk, hips and lower limbs and had 
107 
no known history of hamstring strain, anterior cruciate ligament or other traumatic knee 
108 
injury. Before enrolment in the study, all participants completed a cardiovascular screening 
109 
questionnaire and a standard MRI questionnaire to ensure it was safe for them to enter the 
110 
magnetic field. This study was approved by the Queensland University of Technology 
111 
Human Research Ethics Committee and the University of Queensland Medical Research 
112 
Ethics Committee. 
113 
Study design 
114 
This longitudinal training study was conducted between April and June, 2015. Approximately 
115 
one week before the intervention commenced, participants underwent MR and 2D ultrasound 
116 
imaging of their posterior thighs to determine hamstring muscle size and BFLH architecture, 
117 
respectively. After scanning, all participants were familiarised with the NHE and 45° HE 
118 
exercise and subsequently underwent strength assessments on each exercise. After all of the 
119 
pre-training assessments had been completed, participants were allocated to one of three 
120 
groups: NHE, HE or control (CON). Allocation of participants to groups was performed on 
121 
the basis of baseline BFLH fascicle lengths to ensure that groups did not differ in this 
122 
parameter prior to commencement of the study. Of the three participants with the longest 
123 
fascicles, the first (with the longest fascicles) was allocated randomly to one of the three 
124 
groups and then the second was allocated at random to one of the remaining two groups and 
125 
the third allocated to the remaining group. This process was repeated for the participants with 
126 
 7 
 
the 4th to 6th longest fascicles, the 7th to 9th longest fascicles and so forth until each group had 
127 
10 participants. The NHE and HE groups completed a 10-week progressive strength training 
128 
program consisting exclusively of their allocated exercise (Table 1). The CON group were 
129 
advised to continue their regular physical activity levels but not to engage in any resistance 
130 
training for the lower body. At the beginning of every training session, participants in both 
131 
training groups reported their level of perceived soreness in the posterior thigh using a 1-10 
132 
numeric pain rating scale. All CON participants were required to report to the laboratory at 
133 
least once per week. For all participants, BFLH architecture was re-assessed 5 weeks into the 
134 
intervention and within 5 days of the final training session. MRI scans were acquired for all 
135 
participants <7 days after the final training session. Strength testing was conducted after all 
136 
imaging had been completed.     
137 
Training intervention 
138 
Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE) 
139 
An illustration of the NHE can be found in Figure 1a (see also video supplement). 
140 
Participants knelt on a padded board, with the ankles secured immediately superior to the 
141 
lateral malleolus by individual ankle braces which were attached to uniaxial load cells. The 
142 
ankle braces and load cells were secured to a pivot which allowed the force generated by the 
143 
knee flexors to be measured through the long axis of the load cells. From the initial kneeling 
144 
position with their ankles secured in yokes, arms on the chest and hips extended, participants 
145 
lowered their bodies as slowly as possible to a prone position.[10] Participants performed 
146 
only the lowering (eccentric) portion of the exercise and were instructed to use their arms and 
147 
flex at the hips and knees to push back into the starting position so as to minimise concentric 
148 
knee flexor activity. When participants developed sufficient strength to completely stop the 
149 
movement in the final 10-20⁰ of the range of motion, they were required to hold a weight 
150 
 8 
 
plate (range = 2.5kg to 20kg) to their chest (centred to the xiphoid process) to ensure the 
151 
exercise was still of supramaximal intensity. Participants were provided with 3min of rest 
152 
between each set.    
153 
Hip extension exercise (HE) 
154 
Participants were positioned in a 45° hip extension machine (BodySolid, IL, USA) with their 
155 
trunk erect and hip joints extended and superior to the level of support pad (Figure 1b; see 
156 
also video supplement). The ankle of the exercised limb was ‘hooked’ under an ankle pad and 
157 
the unexercised limb was allowed to rest above its ankle restraint. Participants held one or 
158 
more circular weight plate(s) to the chest (centred to the xiphoid process) and were instructed 
159 
to flex their hip until they reached a point approximately 90° from the starting position. Once 
160 
participants had reached this position they were instructed to return to the starting position by 
161 
extending their hip, while keeping their trunk in a rigid neutral position throughout. Both 
162 
limbs were trained in alternating fashion; after completing a set on one limb participants 
163 
rested for 30s before training the opposite limb, and then recovered for 3min before the next 
164 
set. The load held to the chest in week 1 represented 60-70% of the estimated 1-RM and was 
165 
progressively increased throughout the training period whenever the prescribed repetitions 
166 
and sets could be completed with appropriate technique (Table 2).  
167

Hamstring training program  
171 
Participants in both intervention groups completed a progressive intensity training program 
172 
consisting of 20 supervised exercise sessions (2 per week) over the 10 week period (Tables 1 
173 
 9 
 
& 2). Each session was followed by at least 48 hours of recovery and participants were 
174 
prohibited from engaging in any other resistance training for the lower body. The training 
175 
program was based on the approximate loads, repetitions and sets employed in previous 
176 
interventions using the NHE,[16-18] although the volume (number of repetitions) was 
177 
reduced in the final two weeks to accommodate increases in exercise intensity. All sessions 
178 
were conducted in the same laboratory, employed the same exercise equipment and were 
179 
supervised by the same investigators (MNB and SJD) to ensure consistency of procedures.

186 
 
187 
Strength assessments 
188 
Before and <7 days after the intervention, all participants underwent an assessment of their 
189 
maximal eccentric knee-flexor strength during three repetitions of the NHE, and their 3-
190 
repetition maximum (3-RM) strength on the 45° hip extension machine. All strength tests 
191 
were conducted by the same investigators (MNB, SJD and AJS) with tests completed at 
192 
approximately the same time of day before and after the intervention. 
193 
Nordic eccentric strength test  
194 
The assessment of eccentric knee flexor force using the NHE has been reported previously.[3 
195 
4 23 26] Participants completed a single warm-up set of 5 submaximal repetitions followed, 1 
196 
minute later, by a set of 3 maximal repetitions of the bilateral NHE. Eccentric strength was 
197 
determined for each leg from the highest of 3 peak forces produced during the 3 repetitions of 
198 
the NHE and was reported in absolute terms (N). 
199 
Hip extension strength test  
200 
All strength assessments on the 45° hip extension machine were conducted unilaterally. 
201 
Participants initially warmed up by performing 8-10 repetitions on each leg using body 
202 
weight only. Subsequently, loads held to the chest were progressively increased until 
203 
investigators determined the maximal load that could be lifted three times. At least 2min of 
204 
rest was provided between sets. 
205 
BFLH architecture assessment 
206 
 11 
 
BFLH fascicle length was determined from ultrasound images taken along the longitudinal 
207 
axis of the muscle belly utilising a two-dimensional, B-mode ultrasound (frequency, 12Mhz; 
208 
depth, 8cm; field of view, 14 x 47mm) (GE Healthcare Vivid-i, Wauwatosa, U.S.A). 
209 
Participants were positioned prone on a plinth with their hips in neutral and knees fully 
210 
extended, while images were acquired from a point midway between the ischial tuberosity 
211 
and the knee joint fold, parallel to the presumed orientation of BFLH fascicles. After the 
212 
scanning site was determined, the distance of the site from various anatomical landmarks 
213 
were recorded to ensure its reproducibility for future testing sessions. These landmarks 
214 
included the ischial tuberosity, head of the fibula and the posterior knee joint fold at the mid-
215 
point between BF and ST tendon. On subsequent visits the scanning site was determined and 
216 
marked on the skin and then confirmed by replicated landmark distance measures. Images 
217 
were obtained from both limbs following at least five minutes of inactivity. To gather 
218 
ultrasound images, the linear array ultrasound probe, with a layer of conductive gel was 
219 
placed on the skin over the scanning site, aligned longitudinally and perpendicular to the 
220 
posterior thigh. Care was taken to ensure minimal pressure was placed on the skin by the 
221 
probe as this may influence the accuracy of the measures.[27] The orientation of the probe 
222 
was manipulated slightly by the sonographer (RGT) if the superficial and intermediate 
223 
aponeuroses were not parallel.  
224 
Ultrasound images were analysed using MicroDicom software (Version 0.7.8, Bulgaria). For 
225 
each image, 6 points were digitised as described by Blazevich and colleagues.[28] Following 
226 
the digitising process, muscle thickness was defined as the distance between the superficial 
227 
and intermediate aponeuroses of the BFLH. A fascicle of interest was outlined and marked on 
228 
the image (Figure 2). Fascicle length was determined as the length of the outlined fascicle 
229 
between aponeuroses and was reported in absolute terms (cm). As the entire fascicles were 
230 
 12 
 
not visible in the probe’s field of view, their lengths were estimated using the following 
231 
equation:[28 29]  
232 
FL=sin (AA+90°) x MT/sin(180°-(AA+180°-PA)). 
233 
Where FL=fascicle length, AA=aponeurosis angle, MT=muscle thickness and PA=pennation 
234 
angle. 
235 
All images were collected and analysed by the same investigator (RGT) who was blinded to 
236 
training group allocation. The assessment of BFLH architecture using the aforementioned 
237 
procedures by this investigator (RGT) is highly reliable (intraclass correlations >0.90).[30]  
238 
 
239 
INSERT FIGURE 2 
240 
Muscle volumes and anatomical cross-sectional area assessment All MRI scans were 
241 
performed using a 3-Tesla (Siemens TrioTim, Germany) imaging system with a spinal coil. 
242 
The participant was positioned supine in the magnet bore with the knees fully extended and 
243 
hips in neutral, and straps were placed around both limbs to prevent any undesired 
244 
movement. Contiguous T1-weighted axial MR images (transverse relaxation time: 750ms; 
245 
echo time: 12ms; field of view: 400mm; slice thickness: 10mm; interslice distance: 0mm) 
246 
were taken of both limbs beginning at the iliac crest and finishing distal to the tibial condyles. 
247 
A localiser adjustment (20s) was applied prior to the acquisition of T1-weighted images to 
248 
standardise the field of view. In addition, to minimise any inhomogeneity in MR images 
249 
caused by dielectric resonances at 3T, a post-processing (B1) filter was applied to all 
250 
scans.[31] The total scan duration was 3min 39sec. 
251 
Muscle volumes and anatomical cross-sectional areas (ACSAs) of the BFLH and short head 
252 
(BFSH), semitendinosus (ST) and semimembranosus (SM) muscles were determined for both 
253 
 13 
 
limbs using manual segmentation. Muscle boundaries were identified and traced on each 
254 
image in which the desired structure was present using image analysis software (Sante Dicom 
255 
Viewer and Editor, Cornell University) (Figure 3). Volumes were determined for each muscle 
256 
by multiplying the summed CSAs (from all the slices containing the muscle of interest) by 
257 
the slice thickness.[25] ACSA was determined by locating the 10mm slice with the greatest 
258 
CSA and averaging this along with the two slices immediately cranial and caudal (five 
259 
slices). All traces (pre- and post-training) were completed by the same investigator (MNB) 
260 
who was blinded to participant identity and training group in all post-testing.    
261

263 
Statistical analysis 
264 
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 22.0.0.1 (IBM Corporation, 
265 
Chicago, IL). Repeated measures split plot ANOVAs were used to determine training-
266 
induced changes in BFLH architecture, hamstring muscle volumes and ACSA, strength, and 
267 
ratings of perceived soreness, for each group. For the analysis of BFLH fascicle length, the 
268 
within-subject variable was time (baseline, mid-training, and post-training) and the between-
269 
subject variable was group (HE, NHE, CON). Because BFLH architecture did not differ 
270 
between limbs (dominant vs non-dominant) at any time point (p>0.05), the left and right 
271 
limbs were averaged to provide a single value for each participant. To determine differences 
272 
in the percentage change in hamstring muscle volume and ACSA between groups, the within-
273 
subject variable was muscle (BFLH, BFSH, ST, and SM) and the between-subject variable was 
274 
group (HE, NHE, CON). To explore changes in Nordic and 45° hip extension strength the 
275 
within-subject variable was time (baseline and post-training) and the between-subject 
276 
variable was group (HE, NHE, CON). Lastly, to determine if ratings of perceived soreness 
277 
 14 
 
changed over time, or differed between training groups, within-subject variable was time 
278 
(weeks 1-10) and the between-subject variable was group (HE, NHE, CON)  For all analyses, 
279 
when a significant main effect was detected, post hoc independent t tests with Bonferroni 
280 
corrections were used to determine which comparisons differed. For all analyses, the mean 
281 
differences were reported with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and where appropriate, 
282 
Cohen’s d was reported as a measure of the effect size.  
283 
Sample size 
284 
A priori sample size estimates were based on anticipated differences in BFLH fascicle length 
285 
following the training intervention. A sample size of 10 in each group was calculated to 
286 
provide sufficient statistical power (80%) to detect an effect size of 1.0 for the difference in 
287 
fascicle length changes between training groups, with p<0.05.

A significant group x time interaction was observed for fascicle length during the training

DISCUSSION 
437 
This study is the first to explore the architectural and morphological adaptations of the 
438 
hamstrings in response to different strength training exercises. These data suggest that both 
439 
the HE and NHE stimulate significant increases in BFLH fascicle length and, contrary to our 
440 
hypothesis, that the longer muscle lengths encountered in the HE exercise do not result in 
441 
greater lengthening of fascicles than are observed after NHE training. As hypothesised, HE 
442 
training appears to elicit more hypertrophy in the BFLH than does the NHE; while contrary to 
443 
our hypothesis, the NHE was not significantly more effective at increasing ST volume or 
444 
cross sectional area than the HE. Both exercises resulted in significant strength increases 
445 
which were similarly evident in the NHE and HE strength tests.  
446 
Fascicle lengthening is one possible mechanism by which the NHE[17-19] and other 
447 
eccentric or long length hamstring exercises[22] protect muscles from injury. We have 
448 
recently shown, prospectively, that professional soccer players with fascicles <10.56cm were 
449 
~4 times more likely to suffer a hamstring strain than athletes with longer fascicles and that 
450 
the probability of injury was reduced by ~74% for every 0.5cm increase in fascicle 
451 
length.[23] In the current study, participants increased their fascicle lengths from ~10.6cm 
452 
prior to training, to 12.8  and 12.0cm  in the NHE and HE groups, respectively, which would 
453 
likely result in large reductions in hamstring injury risk.  
454 
Despite its success in reducing hamstring strain injuries, the adoption of the NHE in elite 
455 
European soccer has been reported to be poor with only ~11% of Norwegian premier league 
456 
and UEFA teams deemed to have adequately implemented the NHE programs that have 
457 
proven effective in randomised controlled trials[17-19]. Some conditioning coaches and 
458 
researchers[24] believe that the exercise does not challenge the hamstrings at sufficient 
459 
lengths to optimise injury prevention benefits. However, this study shows, for the first time, 
460 
that the limited excursion of the hamstrings during the NHE does not prevent the exercise 
461 
 23 
 
from increasing BFLH fascicle length. Indeed, the exercise resulted in greater fascicle 
462 
lengthening than the HE, although the current study lacked the statistical power to distinguish 
463 
between the two. Together with observations that long length concentric hamstring training 
464 
can shorten muscle fascicles,[33] the current findings are consistent with the possibility that 
465 
the combination of concentric and eccentric contractions somewhat dampens the elongation 
466 
of BFLH fascicles. The advantage of the NHE may be its almost purely eccentric or 
467 
eccentrically-biased nature. Further work is needed to clarify whether eccentrically-biased or 
468 
purely eccentric HE exercise may yield greater improvements in BFLH fascicle length than 
469 
the combined concentric and eccentric contraction modes used in this investigation.  
470 
Observations of increased fascicle length following eccentric hamstring exercise are largely 
471 
consistent with existing literature. For example, Potier and colleagues[32] reported a 34% 
472 
increase in BFLH fascicle length following eight weeks of eccentric leg curl exercise, while 
473 
Timmins and colleagues[33] reported a 16% increase in BFLH fascicle length after six weeks 
474 
of eccentric training on an isokinetic dynamometer.[33] These adaptations most likely result 
475 
from the addition of in-series sarcomeres, as has been shown to occur within the rat vastus 
476 
intermedius muscle after five days of downhill running.[34] It has been proposed that this 
477 
increase in serial sarcomeres accounts for both a rightward shift in a muscle’s force-length 
478 
relationship,[35] while also  reducing its susceptibility to damage.[21 22] However, it is also 
479 
at least theoretically possible that fascicle lengthening occurs as a result of increased tendon 
480 
or aponeurotic stiffness[41] and further research is needed to clarify the precise mechanism(s) 
481 
responsible for these architectural changes.  
482 
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to explore the morphological adaptations of 
483 
the hamstrings to different strengthening exercises. These data suggest that the NHE and HE 
484 
exercises induce heterogeneous patterns of hamstring muscle hypertrophy, with the former 
485 
preferentially stimulating ST and BFSH growth and the latter resulting in significantly more 
486 
 24 
 
hypertrophy of the BFLH and more homogenous growth of all two-joint hamstring muscles. 
487 
We have previously noted transient T2 relaxation time changes after 50 repetitions of each of 
488 
these exercises that almost exactly fit this pattern,[15] so it appears that the acute changes 
489 
observed via functional MRI match quite well with the hypertrophic effects observed after 10 
490 
weeks of training. However, neither muscle volume nor ACSA have been identified as risk 
491 
factors for hamstring strain injury, so the exact significance of these findings is unknown. 
492 
Indeed, we have previously reported that BFLH muscle thickness measured via ultrasound is 
493 
not a risk factor for hamstring injury in elite soccer.[23] Nevertheless, BFLH muscle atrophy 
494 
has been noted as long as 5-23 months after injury in recreational athletes,[25] so unilateral 
495 
HE exercises may prove more beneficial than the NHE at redressing this deficit in 
496 
rehabilitation. Interestingly, reduced muscle volumes of the ST have been observed 12-72 
497 
months after anterior cruciate ligament injury[36] and the results of the current investigation 
498 
suggest that the NHE may be valuable in rehabilitation of this injury.  
499 
Hamstring strengthening is an important component of injury prevention strategies.[24 37 38] 
500 
Indeed, several large scale interventions employing the NHE have shown ~65% reductions in 
501 
hamstring strain injury rates in soccer [17-19] and recent prospective findings in elite 
502 
Australian football[3] and soccer[23] suggest that eccentric strength improvements like those 
503 
reported here and previously[16] are at least partly responsible for these protective benefits. 
504 
For example, elite athletes in these sports who generated less than 279N (Australian football) 
505 
and 337N (soccer) of knee flexor force at the ankles during the NHE strength test were ~4 
506 
times more likely to sustain hamstring injuries than stronger counterparts.[3 23] In this study, 
507 
our recreational level athletes were able to generate, on average, 460N and 431N after 10 
508 
weeks of NHE and HE training, respectively, making them substantially stronger than these 
509 
elite Australian football[3] and soccer players.[23] Significant improvements in 3-RM HE 
510 
strength were also observed for both training groups, which suggests that hamstring 
511 
 25 
 
strengthening, at least in recreationally trained athletes, is not highly specific to the chosen 
512 
exercise. While the benefits of high levels of HE strength remain unclear from the 
513 
perspective of injury prevention, the observed effects of HE training on BFLH fascicle lengths 
514 
and eccentric knee flexor strength suggest the potential for this exercise to reduce injury risk.  
515 
Future intervention studies analogous to those employing the NHE previously,[17-19 39] are 
516 
needed to clarify whether HE training is effective in reducing hamstring strain injuries, 
517 
however, access to exercise equipment (ie., a 45⁰ HE machine) may be a limiting factor in 
518 
designing such studies. It is also noteworthy that strength improvements can be achieved with 
519 
very modest levels of hamstring muscle soreness when training is appropriately structured 
520 
and progressively overloaded. These observations are in agreement with Mjolsnes and 
521 
colleagues[16] who have previously reported very limited muscle soreness with a gradual 
522 
increase in NHE volume. 
523 
The authors acknowledge that there are some limitations associated with the current study. 
524 
Firstly, muscle architecture was only assessed in the BFLH and it may not be appropriate to 
525 
generalise these findings to other knee flexors, given that each hamstring muscle displays 
526 
unique architectural characteristics.[40] Further, the assessment of fascicle length using two-
527 
dimensional ultrasound requires some degree of estimation, because the entire length of the 
528 
BFLH fascicles are not visible in ultrasound images. While the estimation equation used in 
529 
this study has been validated against cadaveric samples,[29] there is still the potential for 
530 
error, and future studies employing extended field of view ultrasound methods may be 
531 
needed to completely eliminate this. Lastly, all of the athletes in this study were recreational 
532 
level males of a similar age, and it remains to be seen if these results are applicable to other 
533 
populations. However, our participants were, on average, as strong as elite Australian football 
534 
players[3] and stronger than professional soccer players[23] at the start of the study. 
535 
Furthermore, our cohort displayed average fascicle lengths before training that were within 
536 
 26 
 
one standard deviation of the values reported in elite soccer players previously,[23] so it is 
537 
unlikely that they were unrepresentative of higher-level athletes, in these parameters at least. 
538 
This is the first study to demonstrate that training with different exercises elicits unique 
539 
architectural and morphological adaptations within the hamstring muscle group. We have 
540 
provided evidence to suggest that both HE and NHE training are effective in lengthening 
541 
BFLH fascicles and that the greater excursion involved in the HE does not result in greater 
542 
increases in fascicle length. However, HE training appears to be more effective for promoting 
543 
hypertrophy in the commonly injured BFLH than the NHE, which preferentially develops the 
544 
ST and BFSH muscles. HE and NHE had very similar effects on ST volume and cross-
545 
sectional area. These data may help to explain the mechanism(s) by which the NHE confers 
546 
injury preventive benefits and also provide compelling evidence to warrant the further 
547 
exploration of HE-oriented exercises in hamstring strain injury prevention protocols. Future 
548 
prospective studies are needed to ascertain whether HE training interventions are effective in

reducing the incidence of hamstring strain injury in sport and whether or not the combination 
550 
of HE and NHE training is more effective than the NHE alone.  
551 
 
552 
 
 
553 
How might it impact upon clinical practice in the future? 
 Hip extension and Nordic hamstring exercise training are both effective in 
lengthening biceps femoris long head fascicles, and in promoting improvements in 
eccentric knee flexor strength, which  may significantly reduce the risk of hamstring 
strain injury 
 Hip extension exercise may be more useful than the Nordic hamstring exercise for 
stimulating hypertrophy in the commonly injured biceps femoris long head

Figure 2. A two-dimensional ultrasound image of the biceps femoris long head (BFLH), taken 
605 
along the longitudinal axis of the posterior thigh. From these images, it is possible to 
606 
determine the superficial and intermediate aponeuroses, muscle thickness, and angle of the 
607 
fascicle in relation to the aponeurosis. Estimates of fascicle length can then be made via 
608 
trigonometry using muscle thickness and pennation angle.
