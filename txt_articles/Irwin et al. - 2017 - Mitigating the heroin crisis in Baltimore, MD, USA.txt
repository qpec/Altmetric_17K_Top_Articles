hypothetical supervised injection facility

Abstract
Background: In Baltimore, MD, as in many cities throughout the USA, overdose rates are on the rise due to both the
increase of prescription opioid abuse and that of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in the drug market. Supervised
injection facilities (SIFs) are a widely implemented public health intervention throughout the world, with 97 existing in
11 countries worldwide. Research has documented the public health, social, and economic benefits of SIFs, yet none
exist in the USA. The purpose of this study is to model the health and financial costs and benefits of a hypothetical SIF
in Baltimore.
Methods: We estimate the benefits by utilizing local health data and data on the impact of existing SIFs in models for
six outcomes: prevented human immunodeficiency virus transmission, Hepatitis C virus transmission, skin and soft-
tissue infection, overdose mortality, and overdose-related medical care and increased medication-assisted treatment for
opioid dependence.
Results: We predict that for an annual cost of $1.8 million, a single SIF would generate $7.8 million in savings, preventing
3.7 HIV infections, 21 Hepatitis C infections, 374 days in the hospital for skin and soft-tissue infection, 5.9 overdose deaths,
108 overdose-related ambulance calls, 78 emergency room visits, and 27 hospitalizations, while bringing 121 additional
people into treatment.
Conclusions: We conclude that a SIF would be both extremely cost-effective and a significant public health and
economic benefit to Baltimore City.

Background
Baltimore City has one of the highest overdose death
rates in the country, and overdoses have been increasing
in recent years. From 2014 to 2015, heroin-related over-
dose deaths in Baltimore increased from 192 to 260 [1].
These increases are in part attributed to the prevalence
of fentanyl in the heroin supply, with fentanyl causing
31 and 51% of 2015 and 2016 overdose deaths, respect-
ively. Fentanyl is 50–100 times more potent than heroin
or morphine. Illicit fentanyl and derivatives are appeal-
ing to illicit drug networks as these chemicals are
cheaper than prescription opioids, heroin, and cocaine,
and are extremely potent [2–5].
There are numerous additional medical costs associ-
ated with injection drug use, largely related to infectious
diseases and soft-tissue infections. Roughly 18% of the
people who inject drugs (PWID) in Baltimore are HIV
positive, twice the 9% national average for PWID and 50
times the prevalence in the general population [6–8].
One in five Baltimore PWID suffers chronic skin and
soft-tissue
infection,
the
leading
cause
of
PWID
hospitalization [9–11].
Supervised injection facilities (SIFs) have been estab-
lished worldwide to reduce the harms associated with in-
jection drug use. In SIFs, PWID inject previously
obtained drugs in the presence of medical staff. A

 number of public health, social, and economic benefits
of SIFs have been evaluated by studies of the Insite SIF
in Vancouver, Canada and the Medically Supervised
Injecting Centre (MSIC) in Sydney, Australia, both of
which were established in 2003 [12–15].
Among these benefits, studies have demonstrated
four in particular that can be quantified. First, SIFs re-
duce blood-borne disease transmission by providing
clean needles and safer injecting education [12, 16, 17].
Second, SIF staff reduce bacterial infection by providing
clean injection equipment, cleaning wounds, and iden-
tifying serious infections early [18–20]. Third, SIF staff
intervene in case of overdose, meaning that while
PWID may overdose at a SIF, none die and few suffer
complications [13]. Fourth, the SIF and its staff become
a
trusted,
stabilizing
force
in
many
hard-to-reach
PWID’s lives, persuading many to enter addiction treat-
ment [12, 14, 21].
As in other US cities, a multisector discussion about
the merits and utility of SIFs has begun in Baltimore due
to rising overdose deaths as well as the inadequacy of
the current criminal justice-focused response [22].
The purpose of this article is to analyze the potential
cost-effectiveness of establishing a SIF in Baltimore. We
estimate the annual cost of the facility and the savings
resulting from six separate health outcomes: prevention
of HIV infection, HCV infection, skin and soft-tissue in-
fection (SSTI), overdose death, and nonfatal overdose
and increased medication-assisted treatment (MAT) up-
take. Each estimate includes the health outcome, finan-
cial value, and a sensitivity analysis. First, we present the
existing literature on SIF cost-benefit analyses, then our
study’s method, its results, its implications, and its
limitations.
SIF cost-benefit analysis literature review
Prior cost-benefit analyses of Insite in Vancouver and
MSIC in Sydney have assessed a more limited range of
outcomes than the present study. The Insite studies
were limited to the outcomes of HIV prevention, HCV
prevention, and overdose death prevention. They have
agreed that Insite generates net savings when all three
outcomes are considered [23, 24]. The cost-benefit ana-
lysis of Sydney’s MSIC only included savings from over-
dose deaths, ambulance calls, and police services averted
by the SIF.
A number of other studies have estimated HIV and
HCV
prevention
benefits
for
hypothetical
SIFs
in
Canadian cities from Montreal to Saskatoon [25–30].
Irwin et al. [31] are the only other cost-benefit analysis
of a hypothetical SIF in the USA—in San Francisco,
California—and the only other study to consider more
than three outcomes. We discuss the differences in
methodologies between this paper and past analyses for
each individual outcome in the “Methods” section.
Methods
This study calculates the financial and health costs and
benefits of a hypothetical Baltimore SIF modeled on
Insite. Insite occupies roughly 1,000 ft2, provides 13
booths for clients, and operates 18 h per day. Insite
serves about 2100 unique individuals per month, who
perform roughly 180,000 injections per year [32, 33].
This study measures the cost of the facility against sav-
ings from six outcomes: prevention of HIV, HCV, SSTI,
and overdose deaths, reduced overdose-related medical
costs, and referrals to MAT. We assess each model’s de-
pendence on important variables with a sensitivity ana-
lysis. For
the
sensitivity
analysis, we increase and
decrease the chosen variable by 50% and report the im-
pact on the outcome.
Cost of the facility
Cost calculations are based on a facility equal in size and
scope to Insite. We estimate that the annual cost of es-
tablishing a new SIF combines both upfront and operat-
ing costs. Since we assume the same staffing levels,
equipment needs, and other operating cost inputs as
Insite, we calculate the operating costs by multiplying
the Insite SIF’s $1.5 million operating costs by a 4% cost
of living adjustment between Vancouver and Baltimore
[34, 35]. Since the upfront costs would depend on the
exact location and extent of renovations required, we
make a conservative estimate of $1.5 million based on
actual budgets for similar facilities and standard per-
square-foot renovation costs [12, 36]. We convert this
upfront cost into a levelized annual payment by assum-
ing that it was financed with a loan lasting the lifetime
of the facility. We determine the levelized annual pay-
ment according to the standard financial equation:
C ¼
i P
ð Þ
1− 1 þ i
ð
Þ−N
where C is the levelized annual upfront cost, i is a stand-
ard 10% interest rate, P is the $1.5 million total upfront
cost, and N is the estimated 25-year lifetime of the
facility.
HIV and HCV prevention benefits
The
HIV
infection
prevention
benefits
of
Insite,
Vancouver’s SIF, have been modeled in several cost-
benefit analyses [23, 24, 37, 38]. Pinkerton [24] and
Andresen and Jozaghi [23] estimate 5–6 and 22 infec-
tions averted per year, respectively. These estimates dif-
fer primarily because Pinkerton [24] assumes that the
SIF only impacts injections occurring within the SIF,
Irwin et al. Harm Reduction Journal  (2017) 14:29 
Page 2 of 14
 while Andresen and Jozaghi [23] incorporate the fact
that the SIF reduces needle sharing outside the SIF as
well, since Insite staff educate clients on safer injecting
practices [38].
To estimate the impact of reduced needle sharing on
HIV and HCV infection rates, we use an epidemiological
“circulation theory” model developed to calculate how
needle exchange programs impact HIV infection among
PWID and subsequently used to study SIF HIV and
HCV infection [23, 39]. We use the model to estimate
new HIV infection cases (IHIV):
IHIV ¼ iNsd ½1−ð1−qtÞM�
where i is the percentage of HIV-negative PWIDs, N is
the total number of needles in circulation, s is the per-
centage of injections with a shared needle, d is the per-
centage of injections with an unbleached needle, q is the
percentage of HIV-positive PWIDs, t is the chance of
transmitting HIV through a single injection with a
shared needle, and M is the average number of people
injecting with a single previously used needle. Table 1
shows the values and sources for each variable.
We estimate SIF-averted HIV infections by finding the
difference between IHIV at the current rate of needle
sharing (spre) and IHIV at the post-SIF rate (spost). We cal-
culate spost with the formula:
Spost ¼ Spre
T−N
ð
Þ þ 1−n
ð
ÞN
T
where T is the total number of PWID in Baltimore City,
N is the number of SIF users, and n is the 70% reduction
in needle sharing by SIF users [40].
We perform the same calculations for HCV, and the
values and sources for the HCV variables are contained
in Table 2.
We check the model’s validity by comparing its base-
line prediction of HIV and HCV incidence in Baltimore
(IHIV and IHCV at spre) with the city’s actual incidence
data. The model predicts 53 new PWID-related HIV
cases in Baltimore each year in the absence of a SIF, only
slightly lower than the 55 diagnoses reported by the
Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
[41]. Since many new HIV cases go undiagnosed, espe-
cially in the hard-to-reach PWID population, this base-
line
figure
suggests
that
we
are
underestimating
potential HIV infections averted [42].
For HCV, the model predicts 302 cases in the absence
of a SIF. The Maryland Department of Health and Men-
tal Hygiene (DHMH) does not report annual injection-
related HCV infections for Baltimore City. However,
based on Mehta et al.’s [43] finding that 7.8% of a sample
of Baltimore’s HCV-negative PWID contract HCV every
year, we estimate PWID HCV incidence at 398 new
cases per year. Since our model predicts a significantly
lower incidence, we are most likely underestimating the
potential number of HCV infections averted.
Skin and soft-tissue infection benefits
Since PWID frequently contract skin and soft-tissue in-
fection from unsanitary injection practices and often
avoid seeking medical treatment until these infections
become life threatening, SSTI is the number one reason
for PWID hospital admission. Insite studies have dem-
onstrated that SIFs significantly reduce SSTI medical
costs by providing clean injection materials and referring
PWID for medical treatment when necessary [18, 20].

 incorporate this outcome, have shown this outcome to
be significant, concluding that a SIF in San Francisco
could reduce SSTI-related hospitalizations by 415 days
per year, saving $1.7 million.
We estimate annual savings due to SIF SSTI reduction
(SSSTI) according to
SSSTI ¼ NhLrC
where N is the total number of SIF clients, h is the per-
cent of PWID hospitalized for SSTI in an average year, L
is the average length of SSTI hospitalization, r is the 67%
reduction in SSTI hospital stay length that Lloyd-Smith
et al. [18] documented for Insite clients, and C is the
average daily cost of a hospital stay. See Table 3 for
values and sources.
Overdose mortality benefits
While Andresen and Boyd [44] estimate that Insite pre-
vents one overdose death per year, out of roughly 20
total overdose deaths in the neighborhood, they are sim-
ply extrapolating that if Insite hosts 5% of the city’s
injections, it should prevent 5% of the city’s overdose
deaths. However, Milloy et al. [45] demonstrate that
Insite prevents more than 5% of the city’s overdose
deaths. Milloy et al. attribute this effect to drug use
education, which 32% of all Insite clients report receiv-
ing. For example, PWID learn to pre-inject a small
dose of their drug to “test” the potency, which can pre-
vent accidental overdose in case of an unusually pure
or contaminated dose. In Sydney’s SIF, known as
MSIC, 80% of clients report changing their injection
behavior to reduce the risk of overdose as a result of
in-SIF education [15].
This finding is supported by Marshall et al. [46], who
compare the change in overdose deaths within 500 m
of Insite to the change in other Vancouver neighbor-
hoods both before and after the facility’s opening. They
find that before Insite opened, roughly 20 overdoses
occurred within 500 m of the facility. After Insite
opened, overdose mortality within 500 m of the facility
fell by 35%, compared to a 9.3% reduction further
away, suggesting that Insite reduced neighborhood
overdose deaths by at least 26% [46].

 Therefore, to predict the impact of a SIF on fatal over-
dose, we estimate the number of overdose deaths within
a
500-m
radius
of
an
optimally
placed
SIF
in
Baltimore. Based on the fact that there were 260
heroin-related fatal overdoses in 2015 and 342 in the
first three quarters of 2016, we estimate that there
were 463 heroin-related fatal overdoses in all of 2016
[1, 47]. Since data on the geospatial distribution of
fatal overdoses in Baltimore City are not available, we
approximate this distribution by mapping data from
the Baltimore City Fire Department Emergency Med-
ical Services on the locations where medics adminis-
tered
naloxone
in
response
to
suspected
opioid
overdoses [48]. We identify the location with the high-
est concentration of naloxone administrations within
500 m by plotting the locations of all naloxone admin-
istrations in the first three quarters of 2016 in ArcGIS.
The chosen location accounts for 6.2% of all naloxone
administrations,
suggesting
that
28
heroin-related
overdose deaths occurred within that 500-m radius cir-
cle in 2016. As the percent of overdose deaths within
this area varies over time, we assume that in an average
year, it would encompass a more conservative 23
heroin-related overdose deaths. This is 5% of the city-
wide total and slightly higher than the 20 deaths per
year within 500 m of Insite.
We calculate the total value of overdose deaths averted
by the SIF (SOD) according to the equation:
SOD ¼ rnDV
where r is the rate of overdose death reduction expected
within 500 m, n is the 5% share of naloxone administra-
tions concentrated within a single circle of radius 500 m
in Baltimore, D is the total number of overdose deaths
in Baltimore, and V is the value of a single life saved.
In order to assign value to the loss of life due to over-
dose, we follow Andresen and Boyd [44] in considering
only the tangible value to society rather than including
the suffering and lost quality of life for loved ones. We
estimate the tangible value by calculating the present
value of the remaining lifetime wages of an average
person from the community. Since the average age of
PWID in Baltimore is 35, we convert 30 years of future
wages to present value using a standard discount rate
[44, 49]. So the value of a single prevented overdose
death (V) is calculated as
V ¼
X
N
i¼1
W
ð1 þ rÞi
where n represents the remaining years of income, W
represents the median wage for Baltimore City, and r
represents the discount rate. We thus use a value per life
saved of $503,869 in the overdose death savings calcula-
tion above. The values and sources for each variable in
this section are given in Table 4.
Most likely, this method underestimates the facility’s
impact, since this method only estimates averted over-
dose deaths within 500 m of the SIF, though the facility
would also reduce overdose outside a 500-m radius.
Overdose morbidity benefits
Overdoses require emergency medical assistance, even
when they are not life threatening. Evaluations of
Sydney’s MSIC show that by managing overdose events
on-site, the SIF reduces ambulance calls, emergency
room visits, and hospital stays for overdose-related mor-
bidity [12]. No previous SIF cost-benefit evaluations have
included overdose morbidity in their analyses, but MSIC
provides sufficient data to estimate the magnitude of a
SIF’s impact.
In Baltimore, ambulances are called to the scene of
roughly half of all nonfatal overdoses [50]. By contrast,
almost all overdoses in MSIC, Sydney’s SIF, were han-
dled by on-site medical staff and did not result in ambu-
lance calls [14]. We estimate cost savings of averted
ambulance calls for a SIF in Baltimore according to the
following model:

where Sa is the annual savings due to the SIF reducing
ambulance calls for overdose, I is the annual number
of injections in the SIF, o is the per-injection rate of
overdose, co and ci are the rates of overdose ambulance
calls outside and inside the SIF, respectively, and A is
the average cost of an overdose ambulance call. The
values and sources for these variables are given in
Table 5.
Emergency response personnel often transport over-
dose victims to the emergency room for treatment. One
Baltimore study found that 33% of PWID reported being
taken to the ER for their latest overdose [50]. By con-
trast, overdoses in SIFs lead to emergency room treat-
ment in less than 1% of cases [14]. With a single
Baltimore ER visit averaging over $1,300, SIFs reduce
medical costs significantly by keeping PWID out of
emergency rooms for overdose. We calculate the savings
according to the following:
Ser ¼ Io to−ti
ð
ÞF
where Ser is the annual savings due to the SIF reducing
emergency room visits for overdose, I is the annual
number of injections in the SIF, o is the rate of nonfatal
overdose, to and ti are the rates of ER visit for overdose
when the overdose occurs outside and inside the SIF, re-
spectively, and F is the average cost of an overdose
emergency room visit. The values and sources for these
variables are given in Table 6.
Overdose victims are occasionally hospitalized for
treatment. In Baltimore, 12% of PWID who overdosed
reported being hospitalized, while less than 1% of SIF
overdoses lead to hospitalization [14, 50]. With one
day in a Baltimore hospital averaging $2,500, SIFs re-
duce medical costs significantly by keeping PWID out
of the hospital for overdose. We calculate the savings
according to the following:
Sh ¼ Io ao−ai
ð
ÞE
where Sh is the annual savings due to the SIF reducing
hospitalization for overdose, I is the annual number of
injections in the SIF, o is the rate of nonfatal overdose,
ao and ai are the rates of hospitalization for overdose
when the overdose occurs outside and inside the SIF, re-
spectively, and E is the average expense of an overdose
hospital stay. The values and sources for these variables
are given in Table 7.
Medication-assisted treatment benefits
Many PWID who are unable to quit using illicit opioids
through
traditional
abstinence-based
treatment
pro-
grams are successful using methadone or buprenorphine
maintenance as part of medication-assisted treatment
(MAT) [51]. MAT not only reduces the crime and health
care costs of PWID by helping a significant portion quit
injecting drugs but also decreases drug use, crime, and
health costs among the patients who do relapse [52, 53].
Wood et al. [15, 22] and MSIC [12] show that both
Insite and Sydney’s MSIC refer many SIF clients to treat-
ment, increasing treatment uptake. Irwin et al. [31] find
a single SIF’s impact on treatment uptake to be signifi-
cant, estimating that a SIF in San Francisco would bring
110 patients into MAT every year.
We estimate that by referring clients to MAT, a SIF
would produce annual health care and crime savings
equal to SMAT:
SMAT ¼ Nr f b−1
ð
ÞT
where N is the number of PWID who use the SIF, r is
the percent of SIF clients who have been shown to ac-
cess treatment as a result of SIF referrals, f is a conserva-
tive 50% estimate for retention in MAT, b is the average
cost-benefit ratio studies have found for MAT, and T is
the annual cost of treatment. Table 8 shows the values
and sources for each variable.
The SIF’s success in referring PWID to MAT depends
on the pre-existing local prevalence of MAT uptake,

Results
Overall cost-benefit ratio
Our analysis finds a total benefit of $7.77 million and a
total cost of $1.79 million, yielding a cost-benefit ratio
of $4.35 saved for every dollar spent. Net savings are
$5.98 million. We present the sensitivity analysis re-
sults for each outcome in Table 9, showing both finan-
cial and health results for the base, low, and high
cases. Table 10 shows the impact of the sensitivity ana-
lysis for each key variable on the overall cost-benefit
ratio and net savings.
Cost of the facility
Our estimate of the total annual cost is $1.79 million,
which includes $1.62 million in operating costs and
$170,000 in annualized upfront costs. In our sensitivity
analysis, raising the operating cost by 50% increased
the total cost to $2.6 million, lowering the cost-benefit
ratio from 4.35 to 2.99 and net annual savings from
$5.98 million to $5.17 million. Lowering the operating
cost by 50% resulted in a total cost of $980,000, raising
the cost-benefit ratio to 7.96 and net savings to $6.79
million.
HIV and HCV benefits
We estimate that a SIF would prevent an average of
3.7 HIV and 21 HCV cases per year, translating to
annual savings of $1.50 million and $1.44 million,
respectively.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the syringe
sharing rate. Increasing the rate by 50%, from 2.8 to
4.2%, raises averted infections to 5.5 for HIV and 32 for
HCV and savings to $2.25 million for HIV and $2.17
million for HCV. As a result, the overall cost-benefit ra-
tio for the SIF increases from 4.35 to 5.17 and net sav-
ings increase from $5.98 million to $6.45 million.
Decreasing the sharing rate by 50%, from 2.8 to 1.4%,
lowers averted infections to 1.8 for HIV and 11 for HCV,
reducing HIV savings to $750,000 and HCV savings to
$720,000. In this scenario, the overall cost-benefit ratio
declines to 3.52 and net savings fall to $4.51 million.
Skin and soft-tissue infection benefits
We estimate that SIF SSTI care will reduce total PWID
hospital stays for SSTI by 374 days per year, which trans-
lates to annual savings of roughly $930,000.

 We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the SSTI
hospitalization rate. Increasing the rate by 50% raises
averted hospital days to 561 and savings to $1.40 million.
As a result, the overall cost-benefit ratio for the SIF in-
creases from 4.35 to 4.61 and net annual savings rise
from $5.98 million to $6.45 million. Decreasing the rate
by 50% lowers averted hospital days to 187 and reduces
savings to $470,000. In this scenario, the overall cost-
benefit ratio declines to 4.09 and net savings fall to $5.52
million.
Overdose mortality benefits
We estimate that SIF overdose prevention will save an
average of 5.9 lives per year, which translates to $3.00
million in savings for society.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis of drug overdose
deaths in the neighborhood around the facility, since
deaths fluctuate from year to year. Increasing the total
by 50% raises estimated lives saved to 8.9 and financial
savings to $4.50 million. This raises the overall cost-
benefit ratio for the SIF from 4.35 to 5.19 and net sav-
ings from $5.98 million to $7.48 million. Lowering the
neighborhood deaths by 50% would reduce estimated
lives saved to 3.0 and financial savings to $1.50 million,
for an overall cost-benefit ratio of 3.51 and net savings
of $4.48 million.
Overdose morbidity benefits
We estimate that the SIF will also prevent 108 ambu-
lance calls, 78 emergency room visits, and 27 hospitali-
zations
for
nonfatal
overdose,
which
translates
to
$81,000, $110,000, and $67,000 in medical savings,
respectively.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the nonfatal
overdose rate, since it is not well documented for
Baltimore. Increasing the rate 50% raises the benefits to
162 ambulance calls, 117 ER visits, and 40 hospitaliza-
tions, for savings of $120,000, $160,000, and $100,000,
respectively. This higher rate would raise the overall
cost-benefit ratio for the SIF from 4.35 to 4.42 and net
savings from $5.98 to $6.11 million. Lowering the rate
by 50% would reduce the benefits to 54 ambulance calls,
39 ER visits, and 13 hospitalizations, lowering the sav-
ings to $40,000, $50,000, and $30,000, respectively. This
lower rate would reduce the SIF’s overall cost-benefit ra-
tio to 4.28 and net savings to $5.86 million.
Medication-assisted treatment benefits
We estimate that 121 PWID will enter MAT as a result
of the SIF, translating into $640,000 in benefits for
society.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis of the referral rate
for MAT. Raising the rate by 50%, from 5.78 to 8.67%,

 would increase new people in treatment from 121 to 182
and financial savings to $960,000. This would increase the
overall cost-benefit ratio from 4.35 to 4.53 and net annual
savings from $5.98 to $6.30 million. Lowering the rate by
50%, to 2.89%, would reduce new people in treatment to

benefit ratio of 4.17 and net savings of $5.66 million.
Discussion
Our analysis finds a significantly favorable cost-benefit
ratio and net benefits in all scenarios for a SIF in
Baltimore, MD. Our base case scenario predicts that
every dollar spent would return $4.35 in savings. We
estimate that a single, 13-booth facility would generate
annual net savings of $5.98 million, which is equivalent
to 28% of the city health department’s entire budget for
harm reduction and disease prevention [54]. The study
predicts that a SIF would prevent 5.9 overdose deaths
per year.
Compared to Irwin et al.’s [31] cost-benefit analysis
of a SIF in San Francisco, our study estimates the cost-
benefit ratio for a Baltimore SIF to be 87% higher (4.35
versus 2.33) and net savings to be 71% higher ($6.0
million versus $3.5 million). A Baltimore SIF would
have lower costs, lower benefits from SSTI prevention,
similar benefits related to HIV, HCV, and MAT, and
much higher benefits related to overdose deaths. Our
study also incorporates additional outcomes, demon-
strating that a SIF could generate sizeable benefits by
preventing ambulance calls, emergency room visits,
and hospital stays related to nonfatal overdose.
The most significant difference between the San
Francisco and Baltimore studies relates to the SIF’s im-
pact on overdose deaths. We predict 5.9 lives saved per
year in Baltimore, compared to 0.24 lives in San
Francisco [31]. This difference stems primarily from
the much higher overdose death rate in Baltimore.
While
both
cities
have
roughly
20,000
PWID,
Baltimore has more than 20 times more heroin-related
overdose deaths. We also use a more advanced metho-
dology—mapping
the
concentration
of
overdose
deaths—to estimate this outcome.
The SIF’s impact on overdose prevention would com-
plement the Baltimore City Health Department’s exten-
sive efforts to prevent overdose through trainings and
naloxone distribution in community, treatment, and cor-
rections settings. The city has trained over 17,500
Baltimore residents in overdose prevention, including
use of the overdose reversal drug naloxone [55]. A SIF
would ensure that when PWID overdose, they do so in
the presence of staff trained to administer naloxone. In
addition, a SIF would prevent overdose deaths outside
the facility because SIF staff provide PWID with safer
injecting education, stressing the importance of injecting
where naloxone is available.
Our results also suggest that a SIF would become a
key component of Baltimore’s continued efforts to re-
duce viral infections among PWID. Preventing four HIV
and 21 HCV infections every year would reduce total in-
cidence of both HIV and HCV by roughly 5%. The SIF
would allow service providers to locate PWID, test them
for viral infection, refer them for HIV and HCV treat-
ment, and retain them in treatment. It thus addresses all
four aspects of the 2017 HIV prevention strategy of the
National Institute on Drug Abuse: “seeking, testing,
treating, and retaining” PWID and other populations in
need of HIV care [56].
Our estimate that a SIF would save close to a million
dollars per year in SSTI hospital costs shows the benefits
of removing a small population of “frequent fliers” from
emergency
rooms
and
hospitals.
Still,
since
San
Francisco has both a more serious SSTI problem due to
the prevalence of black tar heroin and higher hospital
costs, this area of benefits is smaller for Baltimore.
Our
estimate
of
121
PWID
entering
MAT
in
Baltimore is similar to Irwin et al.’s [31] estimate of 110
PWID in San Francisco. However, in both cities, the ac-
tual number will depend on the existing ease of MAT ac-
cess, as well as the efforts by SIF staff to refer PWID to
treatment. Baltimore can maximize these benefits by in-
creasing funding to MAT programs, making treatment
referrals a priority for SIF staff, and establishing the SIF
near existing treatment providers for easy referral and
follow-up.

 Our sensitivity analysis illustrates that the SIF’s operat-
ing cost has a significant impact on the overall cost-
benefit ratio, though less of an impact on net savings.
While we used a conservatively high cost estimate, stra-
tegic staffing, location, and procedural decisions by both
SIF executives and local government officials could re-
duce costs and further increase the net benefits. Cost-
effectiveness in Baltimore would be significantly higher
largely because Baltimore has lower real estate values,
salaries, cost of living, and cost of doing business [31].
There are a number of lessons from the initial opera-
tions of Insite which could inform the overall costs asso-
ciated with a SIF in Baltimore. For example, Health
Canada’s protocols required Insite to call an ambulance
for every overdose incident, resulting in unnecessary
costs given the ability to reverse overdose at Insite [57].
We recommend that the Baltimore City Health Depart-
ment work with a local SIF, with extensive peer involve-
ment, to consider the health, social, and economic
impact of any such protocols.
The continuum of care provided at the SIF has im-
portant implications for its impact. An integrated SIF
model would co-locate detoxification, treatment, medical
care, mental health care, housing, employment, govern-
ment benefits, and legal services. Such a model would
facilitate service uptake for a population that faces a
number of barriers in accessing services.
We should note that it is difficult to ascertain who
exactly would ultimately receive the savings documented
in this study. Savings from the HIV, HCV, SSTI, and
nonfatal overdose outcomes all accrue to the health care
system, but the real beneficiaries are difficult to pin
down. Holtgrave [58] and Mehta [6] estimate that the
public sector bears the greatest share of HIV treatment
costs, in particular Medicaid. Whether PWID have pri-
vate insurance, Medicare/Medicaid, or no insurance, the
savings ultimately reach federal, state, and local tax-
payers, as well as everyone who pays health care pre-
miums and hospital bills. MAT savings are split between
medical care and reduced crime committed to get
money to buy drugs. Overdose death savings represent
value to the overall local economy from that person’s fu-
ture contributions.
Limitations
This cost-benefit analysis faces a number of limitations.
First, this study does not tackle the political, legal, and
social barriers confronting the efforts to establish a SIF
in Baltimore. In spring 2017, a second attempt to
authorize safe consumption spaces in Maryland failed in
the Maryland State Assembly. This effort faces oppos-
ition concerns similar to SIF campaigns in other cities,
including fears of “enabling” drug use, “Not In My Back
Yard,” and potential legal vulnerability to prosecution
under federal drug statutes [59–61]. It also faces more
unique challenges—while the opiate epidemic’s recent
damage to white, middle-class communities has grabbed
media attention, Baltimore’s heroin crisis is decades old
and fails to generate the same political capital for action
because it primarily impacts lower-income African-
American communities [62].
To address these issues, advocates have formed a co-
alition of public health practitioners, current and former
drug users, community organizers, and academics. Over
the past year, the coalition has been meeting with the
local health department, social service providers, drug
users, politicians, and community leaders. In addition to
garnering local and state political support, a Baltimore
SIF campaign will only be successful if it involves the af-
fected communities and elevates their voices.
Our study’s estimates of health and economic out-
comes also face limitations. Without specific plans for a
facility, some variables are difficult to estimate. Since
there are no actual regulations, guidelines, or actual
physical plans for a SIF in Baltimore, we can only make
a conservative guess at facility cost. Once regulations are
established and plans for construction and operation
have been created, an updated cost analysis should be
performed. Similarly, the SIF’s success at referring PWID
to treatment would depend on staffing decisions, the
protocol for treatment referrals, and the convenience
and availability of effective treatment options.
In addition, our models are difficult to verify because a
number of important health indicators are not well doc-
umented for Baltimore’s PWID population. For example,
researchers have noted that resources have not been de-
voted to accurately measuring the Baltimore PWID pop-
ulation’s HCV prevalence, much less the HCV incidence
or the impact of needle sharing [63]. Also, available data
conflicts on the prevalence of SSTI and rates of SSTI
hospitalization among PWID. Other variables, from the
average number of needle-sharing partners to the rate of
ambulance calls to nonfatal overdose, are based on a sin-
gle study and should be corroborated.
The study’s accuracy would also benefit from specific
cost information. The costs of HIV and HCV care, SSTI
hospitalization,
medication-assisted
treatment,
and
overdose-related ambulance calls, emergency room visits,
and hospital stays have all been approximated using fig-
ures for the general population. We consider all of these
to be underestimates of the actual costs, since PWID tend
to require more services and supervision [64].
There are also some potential interaction effects that
are beyond the scope of this study. For example, our
HIV and HCV models do not account for PWID becom-
ing
infected
or
transmitting
the
viruses
to
others
through sexual contact. Our models also do not account
for interaction effects between HIV and HCV infection
Irwin et al. Harm Reduction Journal  (2017) 14:29 
Page 10 of 14
 or between viral infection and SSTI. While these effects
would likely have a minor impact on our overall find-
ings, if relevant data becomes available, our analysis
should be updated accordingly.
Finally, the impact of the SIF will depend on how well
the SIF and co-located service providers align with the
unique features of Baltimore’s population of PWID.
Studies have shown that the effectiveness of harm reduc-
tion programs depends on their consideration of ethni-
city,
gender,
age,
homelessness,
inequality,
social
networks, drug markets, and other demographic and so-
cial factors [65–70]. We have used the best local health
data available to tailor our analysis to Baltimore’s unique
risk factors and social environment. However, the ultim-
ate impact of a SIF in Baltimore will depend on how well
the facility adapts to this environment by studying, con-
sulting, and collaborating with the local PWID popula-
tion [71–73].
Conclusions
Despite the present study’s limitations, it demonstrates
that a SIF in Baltimore would bring significant cost sav-
ings and public health benefits to the city. A single 13-
booth SIF facility in Baltimore City modeled on Insite in
Vancouver would generate medical and economic sav-
ings of roughly $7.77 million per year. At a total cost of
$1.79 million per year, every dollar spent would generate
an estimated $4.35 in savings. To put the $5.98 net an-
nual savings for a single SIF in perspective, they equal
28% of the Baltimore City Health Department’s budget
for harm reduction and disease prevention.
In terms of health outcomes, we estimate that every
year, a SIF would prevent 3.7 HIV infections, 21 HCV
infections, 374 days in the hospital for skin and soft-
tissue infection, 5.9 overdose deaths, 108 overdose am-
bulance calls, 78 overdose emergency room visits, and
27 overdose-related hospitalizations, while bringing an
additional 121 PWID into treatment.
We recommend that the city avoid excessive regula-
tion of a SIF and maximize the linkages to services for
the PWID population. We also recommend that re-
searchers carefully track health indicators and medical
costs associated with the PWID population before and
after establishing a SIF in order to evaluate the facility’s
benefits.
SIFs provide other important benefits in addition to
those quantified in this study. They decrease public in-
jection, prevent physical and sexual violence against
PWID, and reduce syringe littering [38, 74–76]. They
facilitate research to better understand the PWID popu-
lation [77]. Lastly, they allow social service providers to
harness the power of PWID peer networks and bring
important programs to the hard-to-reach PWID popula-
tion [78–80].
Establishing a SIF in Baltimore would bring a number
of well-established medical, financial, and societal bene-
fits. We do not believe that health initiatives like SIFs
should be judged purely on financial terms. However, we
hope that this cost-benefit analysis provides a helpful
starting
point
to

the
potential
impact

Baltimore of a supervised injection facility.
