Anxiety and trauma-related disorders are psychiatric diseases with a lifetime prevalence
of up to 25%. Phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are characterized
by abnormal and persistent memories of fear-related contexts and cues. The effects
of psychological treatments such as exposure therapy are often only temporary and
medications can be ineffective and have adverse side effects. Growing evidence from
human and animal studies indicates that cannabidiol, the main non-psychotomimetic
phytocannabinoid present in Cannabis sativa, alleviates anxiety in paradigms assessing
innate fear. More recently, the effects of cannabidiol on learned fear have been
investigated in preclinical studies with translational relevance for phobias and PTSD. Here
we review the findings from these studies, with an emphasis on cannabidiol regulation
of contextual fear. The evidence indicates that cannabidiol reduces learned fear in
different ways: (1) cannabidiol decreases fear expression acutely, (2) cannabidiol disrupts
memory reconsolidation, leading to sustained fear attenuation upon memory retrieval,
and (3) cannabidiol enhances extinction, the psychological process by which exposure
therapy inhibits learned fear. We also present novel data on cannabidiol regulation of
learned fear related to explicit cues, which indicates that auditory fear expression is also
reduced acutely by cannabidiol. We conclude by outlining future directions for research to
elucidate the neural circuit, psychological, cellular, and molecular mechanisms underlying
the regulation of fear memory processing by cannabidiol. This line of investigation may
lead to the development of cannabidiol as a novel therapeutic approach for treating
anxiety and trauma-related disorders such as phobias and PTSD in the future.

INTRODUCTION
Anxiety and trauma-related disorders will affect up to one in four people in their lifetime.
Diseases like phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) show abnormal persistence of fear
memories and can be debilitating, causing a huge societal and economic burden. Psychological
treatments like exposure therapy are used to treat these disorders but they often show only limited
or temporary effectiveness. Medications are also available but these are not fully effective in a

significant proportion of patients, can have adverse side effects,
and may even interfere with the efficacy of psychological therapy.
There is therefore an urgent need for better treatments for these
disorders (Fineberg et al., 2013; Baldwin et al., 2014).
A promising area of research in this field focuses on
repurposing existing and developing novel drugs to enhance the
effectiveness of psychological therapies in alleviating fear-related
symptoms (Myers and Davis, 2007; Steckler and Risbrough,
2012). One drug showing broad therapeutic potential in various
psychiatric diseases is cannabidiol (CBD), the main non-
psychotropic constituent of the Cannabis sativa plant (Izzo et al.,
2009; see chemical structure of CBD in Figure 1A). Studies in
humans demonstrate the promise of CBD for treating anxiety
(Blessing et al., 2015) and preclinical studies in rodents are
elucidating the pharmacological mechanisms underlying its acute
anxiolytic effects. These mechanisms include potentiation of
serotonin (5-HT) transmission via 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR)
activation and elevation of endocannabinoid levels via inhibition
of their metabolism and re-uptake, which indirectly facilitates
cannabinoid receptor type1 (CB1R) activation (for a review see
Campos et al., 2016).
As

regulates fear learning and memory in paradigms that are
translationally relevant to diseases such as phobias and PTSD,
along with their psychological treatment. In this paper we
review the recent studies on CBD regulation of fear memory
processing, which have focused on contextual fear. We also
present novel data on CBD regulation of auditory fear memory
and its extinction, which forms the theoretical basis for exposure
therapy. We then outline future directions for research on
this topic to gain a broader perspective on the neural circuit,
psychological, pharmacological, and cellular bases of the
regulation of learned fear by CBD.

Recent evidence indicates that CBD modulates fundamental

During

a
neutral
conditioned stimulus (CS) is associated with an aversive
unconditioned stimulus (US), such as a mild footshock. The
CS can be either discrete (i.e., cued), such as a light or tone, or
the environment (i.e., context) where the US was presented. CS
re-exposure after conditioning initially induces a fear response,
which has frequently been inferred from behavioral (e.g.,

freezing) and/or autonomic (increased heart rate/blood pressure,
decreased body temperature) changes (Fendt and Fanselow,
1999; Resstel et al., 2009). After its acquisition the CS-US
association is consolidated into long-term fear memory. Later
retrieval can render fear memory labile through destabilization
of the memory trace, allowing for maintenance or updating of
the memory through its reconsolidation (Lee, 2009). Extinction
of fear memory occurs with longer durations or repeated
sessions of retrieval. This form of inhibitory learning results in
the encoding of a new CS-no US association which suppresses
fear expression by competing with the original fear memory
(Myers and Davis, 2007). Figure 1B depicts the different phases
of fear memory and its possible reconsolidation or extinction
after retrieval.
Accumulating evidence indicates that CBD regulates different
contextual fear memory processes. An initial study by Resstel
et al. (2006) showed that systemic CBD administration decreases

Biotechnology Information, 2016). (B) The different phases of fear memory. In
the hours after its acquisition fear memory undergoes consolidation. After a
short duration of retrieval, fear memory can become destabilized, after which it
undergoes reconsolidation to maintain or update the memory. With longer

acquisition and consolidation of a new extinction memory which competes
with the original memory to inhibit fear expression. (C) A summary of the
effects of acute CBD administration on different contextual fear memory

Cannabidiol Regulation of Fear Memory Processing
the freezing response and autonomic changes induced by
exposure to an aversively conditioned context; this effect was
similar to the positive control diazepam. Subsequent studies
confirmed the CBD-induced reduction in conditioned freezing
expression with acute administration before retrieval (Lemos
et al., 2010) or acquisition (Levin et al., 2012). In contrast,
ElBatsh et al. (2012) showed that repeated daily injections (14
days) of CBD increased freezing expression during contextual
fear retrieval. Chronic treatment with CBD has, however,
been shown to facilitate adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Wolf
et al., 2010; Campos et al., 2013), which is involved in
aversive learning and memory processing as its facilitation
enhances contextual discrimination and related fear expression
(Efstathopoulos et al., 2015). Mice with reduced neurogenesis,
on the other hand, presented less contextual fear (Pan et al.,
2012; Denny et al., 2014). Both associative (through facilitation
of associative learning) and non-associative (by buffering
non-associative, anxiogenic effects of the aversive experience)
mechanisms seem to play a role in regulating fear learning
by adult hippocampal neurogenesis (Seo et al., 2015). Since
the animals were conditioned during chronic CBD treatment,
facilitated contextual fear learning due to enhanced hippocampal
neurogenesis could explain the results reported by ElBatsh et al.
(2012). This idea is supported by studies which showed that
chronic CBD treatment rescues deficits in other types of memory
in animal models of cognitive impairment (Fagherazzi et al.,
2012; Cheng et al., 2014).
In addition to reducing contextual fear acutely when given
before retrieval, CBD has also been shown to have enduring
effects on fear expression when given in conjunction with
memory reactivation (leading to reconsolidation) or extinction.
Systemic CBD administration immediately after briefly retrieving
a contextual fear memory disrupted its reconsolidation, resulting
in a lasting reduction in fear expression during later retrieval
(Stern et al., 2012, 2015; Gazarini et al., 2014). This effect
depended on the (indirect) activation of CB1Rs rather than
5-HT1ARs as prior antagonism of CB1Rs, but not 5-HT1ARs,
blocked the disruptive effect of CBD on reconsolidation (Stern
et al., 2012). In contrast to its effect on the reconsolidation
of contextual fear memory, CBD potentiated contextual fear
extinction but this also results in reduced fear expression at later
retrieval. Intracerebroventricular infusion of CBD before three
longer retrieval sessions facilitated the extinction of contextual
fear, an effect mediated indirectly via CB1R activation as it was
blocked by CB1R antagonist pretreatment (Bitencourt et al.,
2008). Systemic CBD administration before a single long retrieval
session also affects contextual fear extinction but this depends
on the strength of prior fear conditioning. Whereas, CBD
enhanced the extinction of contextual fear resulting from strong
conditioning, it impaired the contextual fear extinction induced
by weaker conditioning (Song et al., this issue). Table 1 and
Figure 1C summarize the reported effects of systemic CBD
administration on contextual fear memory processing.
Recent studies have begun to determine the neural substrates
mediating the effects of CBD on contextual fear memory
processing. Lemos et al. (2010) initially investigated the brain
sites in which CBD acts when attenuating the expression of
learned fear. They reported that systemic CBD pretreatment
prevented the increase in c-Fos expression induced by re-
exposure to the conditioned context in the prelimbic (PL)
and infralimbic (IL) subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST),
brain areas which play key roles in fear regulation (Dejean
et al., 2015; Lebow and Chen, 2016). Subsequently, the effect
of direct CBD infusion into these brain regions on contextual
fear memory retrieval was investigated. There was reduced
conditioned freezing expression after its infusion into the PL
or BNST (Lemos et al., 2010; Gomes et al., 2012; Fogaça et al.,
2014). When infused into the IL, however, CBD produced
the opposite effect (Lemos et al., 2010; Marinho et al., 2015).
Convergent evidence suggests that the PL and IL present distinct
neuroanatomical connections and functional roles (Hurley et al.,
1991; Condé et al., 1995; Vertes, 2004), including the regulation of
learned fear expression (Vidal-Gonzalez et al., 2006; Fenton et al.,
2014). Contrasting effects of CBD after PL or IL infusion have
also been reported in unlearned tests of anxiety (e.g., elevated plus
maze), in which it induced anxiogenic- or anxiolytic-like effects,
respectively (Fogaça et al., 2014; Marinho et al., 2015). Restraint
stress pre-exposure reversed these effects, indicating that the
stress experience could modulate the response of these mPFC
subregions to aversive stimuli (Fogaça et al., 2014; Marinho
et al., 2015). CBD regulation of contextual fear expression in
these regions depends on 5-HT1AR activation as it is prevented
by local 5-HT1AR antagonist pretreatment (Gomes et al., 2012;
Fogaça et al., 2014; Marinho et al., 2015). CBD disruption of
fear memory reconsolidation depended on CB1R but not 5-
HT1AR activation in the PL (Stern et al., 2014). CBD infused
into the IL cortex facilitated contextual fear extinction in a CB1R-
dependent manner (Do Monte et al., 2013). Table 2 summarizes
the reported effects of central CBD infusion on contextual fear
memory processing.
CBD REGULATION OF FEAR MEMORY
PROCESSING INVOLVING DISCRETE
CUES
In contrast to contextual fear memory processing, few studies
have examined the effects of CBD on learned fear related to
discrete cues. One study in humans showed that CBD enhanced
the extinction of visual fear memory when given immediately
after, but not before, extinction (Das et al., 2013). More recently
it was found in rats that CBD infused into the nucleus accumbens
shell impaired the encoding of olfactory fear memory, an
effect blocked by 5-HT1AR antagonism (Norris et al., 2016).
To investigate this issue further we determined the effect of
systemic CBD administration on the expression and extinction of
auditory fear memory. Male Lister hooded rats were habituated
to two distinct contexts (A and B), subjected to auditory fear
conditioning (tone habituation and tone-shock pairings) in
context A, treated with CBD (0, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg, i.p.; n = 10–
11/group) 30 min before undergoing extinction training (tone
presentations) in context B, and underwent extinction recall
testing (tone presentations) in context B (Figure 2A).

We found no differences in freezing during fear conditioning
between the groups to receive different doses of CBD before
extinction training (Figure 2B). Despite the relatively low levels
of freezing during tone-shock pairings, conditioning resulted
in robust fear memory encoding as indicated by the high
freezing levels in response to tones during early extinction in
vehicle-treated rats (Figure 2C). During extinction the high dose
of CBD significantly decreased tone-induced freezing early in
the session, compared to vehicle and the low dose. However,
there were no differences in freezing during tone presentations
later in the session or during extinction recall testing the
next day (Figure 2D). This suggests that the high CBD dose
decreased auditory fear memory expression without affecting its
extinction. Although extinction occurred in a separate context
to fear conditioning, vehicle-treated rats did show freezing
in the period before tone presentations, indicating contextual
fear expression at the start of the session (Figure 2E). We
found that all three doses of CBD significantly decreased this
contextual fear in comparison to vehicle. However, there were no
differences in contextual fear expression before extinction recall
testing (Figure 2F), suggesting that CBD acted acutely to reduce
contextual fear during extinction.
Taken together, our results broadly confirm previous findings
demonstrating that acute CBD treatment reduces contextual
fear memory expression and extend them by showing that
CBD also has a similar effect on the expression of auditory
fear memory. Given that previous studies have shown a bell-
shaped dose-response curve in relation to CBD regulation of
anxiety and fear memory processing (Guimarães et al., 1990;
Lemos et al., 2010; Stern et al., 2012), it is worth noting
that we found that (1) the effect of CBD on contextual fear
expression showed no dose-dependency, and (2) the dose of
CBD needed to reduce auditory fear expression was much
higher than for contextual fear. Moreover, CBD had no effect
on auditory fear extinction. Although, this result agrees with
the study of Das et al. (2013), which showed that CBD had
no effect when given before cued fear extinction, it contrasts
with the reported facilitatory effects of CBD on contextual fear
extinction. The reasons for these discrepancies remain unclear
but they could involve differences in the neural circuit and/or
pharmacological mechanisms underlying CBD regulation of
contextual vs. auditory fear memory expression (see below).
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Neural Circuit and Psychological
Mechanisms
As well as the mPFC, the neural circuitry underpinning
fear memory processing comprises other inter-connected areas
such as the hippocampus, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray
(PAG) (Dejean et al., 2015). Infusing CBD into the PAG
decreases anxiety in paradigms assessing innate fear (Campos
and Guimarães, 2008). However, this area is also important for
mediating freezing and other defensive behaviors in response
to learned threats, suggesting that CBD regulation of fear
memory expression may involve the PAG. In humans CBD
reduces anxiety and autonomic arousal during the viewing of
fearful facial expressions, which is accompanied by decreased
activity in and functional connectivity between the amygdala and
mPFC (Fusar-Poli et al., 2009, 2010). In mice CBD decreases
amygdala activation as measured by c-Fos expression (Todd
and Arnold, 2016). This raises the possibility that the amygdala
plays a role in mediating CBD regulation of fear memory.
CBD also reduces mPFC-hippocampus functional connectivity
during cognitive processing (Bhattacharyya et al., 2015). This
suggests that the hippocampus, which is crucial for contextual
processing in particular, may also be involved in CBD regulation
of certain aspects of learned fear. After extinction, fear expression
is low when tested in the extinction context but fear renewal

occurs outside of this context. This contextual regulation of
fear extinction involves the hippocampus and its connections
with the mPFC and amygdala (Maren et al., 2013). Although,
we found no effects of CBD on auditory fear extinction, CBD
might reduce fear renewal and/or the spontaneous recovery of
fear that occurs over time after extinction through its actions on

Cannabidiol Regulation of Fear Memory Processing
the hippocampus-mPFC-amygdala circuit. CBD modulation of
this circuitry may also regulate learned fear in other paradigms
with translational relevance. Phobias and PTSD are characterized
by overgeneralization of fear to harmless discrete or contextual
stimuli (Dunsmoor and Paz, 2015). A recent study showed
that enhancing memory destabilization in combination with
reconsolidation disruption by CBD reduced contextual fear
generalization (Gazarini et al., 2014).
Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms
As mentioned above, CBD regulates contextual fear memory
processing in a 5HT1AR- and CB1R-dependent manner. It is
unclear whether the action of CBD via 5-HT1ARs to reduce fear
memory expression is mediated by intracellular mechanisms.
While 5-HT1ARs certainly modulate intracellular kinases, the
direction of modulation appears not to be consistent with fear
inhibition. The 5-HT1AR activates protein kinase C (PKC) and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Raymond et al.,
2001), but it is inhibition of PKC (Vianna et al., 2000) and
ERK (Szapiro et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2005) that impairs fear
memory expression. It should be noted, however, that these
observations were made with intra-hippocampal drug infusions,
whereas the acute effect of CBD has been shown to be mediated
by the PL and BNST. Nevertheless, the putative action of CBD
at 5-HT1ARs might be mediated not via protein kinases, but
by inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC). Such inhibition of AC
and downstream dysregulation of second messenger systems
might be expected ultimately to affect ongoing protein synthesis.
Lopez et al. (2015) showed that inhibition of ongoing protein
synthesis in the amygdala impaired fear memory expression, and
so a similar perturbation of normal de novo protein synthesis
by CBD via 5-HT1ARs might be expected to impact upon
retrieval. Speculatively, a pharmacologically-induced increase in
protein synthesis might also sufficiently dysregulate the cellular
mechanisms of retrieval to reduce fear expression. Therefore, any
impact of CBD on protein synthesis could account for its acute
effect on contextual, and cued, fear memory expression.
The actions of CBD to enhance extinction and impair
reconsolidation both depend upon CB1Rs. Therefore, the
coupling of CB1R activation to intracellular cascades may
provide the cellular mechanism of long-term fear reduction.
At the cellular level, mechanisms of reconsolidation tend to
be conserved with those of extinction, such that inhibition
results in impairment of both with opposite behavioral outcomes.
A primary example of this is the effect of protein synthesis
inhibitors, such as anisomycin, which impair reconsolidation
to reduce fear expression as well as disrupting extinction
to enhance subsequent fear expression. Therefore, in general
terms, CB1R activation by CBD might be expected to result
in cellular activation that would enhance extinction, but also
potentiate reconsolidation. That this is seemingly not the case
suggests the recruitment of specific cellular mechanisms with
dissociable impacts on extinction and reconsolidation. One
primary candidate for such a role is the calcineurin-nuclear factor
kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) signaling
pathway. In the hippocampus, NFkB inhibition both impaired
fear memory reconsolidation and enhanced extinction (De La
Fuente et al., 2011). Moreover, inhibition of calcineurin, which
itself is a negative regulator of NFkB, impaired extinction and
enhanced reconsolidation (De La Fuente et al., 2011, 2014).
This pattern of results was partially replicated by calcineurin
inhibition in the amygdala impairing cued fear memory
extinction (Merlo et al., 2014). Therefore, if CB1R activation
by CBD inhibits NFkB function, either directly (Curran et al.,
2005) or via enhancement of calcineurin (Cannich et al., 2004),
this would explain the behavioral reductions in fear expression,
perhaps through downstream regulation of cytokine networks
(Scholz et al., 2016).
SUMMARY
A growing body of literature provides compelling evidence that
CBD has anxiolytic effects and recent studies have established
a role for CBD in regulating learned fear by dampening its
expression, disrupting its reconsolidation, and facilitating its
extinction. The opposing effects of CBD on fear memory
reconsolidation and extinction make it particularly attractive
as a potential adjunct to psychological therapy as both may
lead to lasting reductions in learned fear expression. Our
novel data also suggests that CBD reduces the expression of
fear memory related to both discrete and contextual cues.
Although we found no effect of CBD on auditory fear extinction,
decreasing fear expression during extinction without interfering
in its encoding is still a useful property that has clinical
implications. In this respect CBD might be an improvement
over other available drugs used for treating the fear-related
symptoms of phobias and PTSD, which can impair extinction
(e.g., benzodiazepines) or have a less favorable side effect profile
(e.g., antidepressants). As such, further research investigating
the mechanisms underpinning CBD regulation of learned fear is
warranted.
