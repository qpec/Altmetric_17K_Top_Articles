Abstract
Background: Although cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) improves
survival of unselected patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), only a
minority responds to therapy and chemoresistance remains a major [24_TD$DIF]challenge in this
disease setting.
Objective: To investigate the clinical significance of oncofetal chondroitin sulfate (ofCS)[25_TD$DIF]
glycosaminoglycan chains in cisplatin-resistant MIBC and to evaluate these as targets for
second-line therapy.
Design, setting, and participants: An ofCS-binding recombinant VAR2CSA protein de-
rived from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (rVAR2) was used as an in situ, in
vitro, and in vivo ofCS-targeting reagent in cisplatin-resistant MIBC. The ofCS expression
landscape was analyzed in two independent cohorts of matched pre- and post-NAC–
treated MIBC patients.
Intervention: An rVAR2 protein armed with cytotoxic hemiasterlin compounds (rVAR2
drug conjugate [VDC] 886) was evaluated as a novel therapeutic strategy in a xenograft
model of cisplatin-resistant MIBC.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Antineoplastic effects of targeting
ofCS.
Results and limitations: In situ, ofCS was significantly overexpressed in residual tumors
after NAC in two independent patient cohorts (p < 0.02). Global gene-expression
profiling and biochemical analysis of primary tumors and cell lines revealed syndi-
can-1 and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 as ofCS-modified proteoglycans in MIBC. In
vitro, ofCS was expressed on all MIBC cell lines tested, and VDC886 eliminated these cells
in the low-nanomolar IC50 concentration range. In vivo, VDC886 effectively retarded[3_TD$DIF]

Introduction
Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the world
and the most costly cancer to treat on a per-patient basis due
to required clinical surveillance and multiple therapeutic
interventions [1]. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a
highly aggressive flavor of the disease with a 5-yr survival
probability of �50% [2]. Despite efforts in refining surgical
techniques and optimizing systemic therapy, the prognosis
has remained unchanged for more than 20 yrs [3]. Clinical
improvement can be ascribed cisplatin-based neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (NAC), which offers an overall survival
benefit of 5–6% [4] and is currently standard of care in
MIBC [5]. However, only �40% of patients demonstrate a
major response to NAC and adverse treatment effects and
delay in surgery, potentially harm 60%. Therefore, second-
line treatment options for MIBC are currently in great
demand [6]. Although 60% of patients with metastatic MIBC
demonstrate
an
objective
response
to
cisplatin-based
chemotherapy, this response is rarely durable, and most
of these patients succumb to disease [7]. Atezolizumab has
recently become the first Food and Drug Administration–
approved agent for second-line treatment of metastatic
bladder cancer [8], but there remains a great need for
additional agents in all states of MIBC.
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are carbohydrate modifica-
tions attached to proteins in the cell membrane. Changes in
expression and composition of GAGs have been reported in
bladder cancer over the past 3 decades [9–11]. Chondroitin
sulfate (CS) is a major cancer-associated GAG that also has a
key role in malaria pathogenesis [12]. The malaria parasite
Plasmodium
falciparum
has
evolved
a
protein,
called
VAR2CSA that mediates attachment of infected erythro-
cytes to a distinct type of CS in the placental syncytium
[13]. CS chains comprise repeated disaccharide units, made
up of glucoronic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)
residues. CS chains are highly heterogeneous showing
variations in both chain length and disaccharide modifica-
tions. Placental-type CS is mainly sulfated on carbon-4 of
the GalNAc hexose, and this particular modification is
required for exclusive sequestration of VAR2CSA-positive
erythrocytes in the placenta [14]. Placenta and cancer share
obvious phenotypic features such as highly proliferating
cells, the ability to invade adjacent tissue, and promoting
angiogenesis [15]. In the placenta, these features are partly
facilitated by CS, and many tumors re-express placental-
type CS as an oncofetal GAG [16]. Therefore, recombinant
malarial VAR2CSA (rVAR2) proteins can be conveniently
utilized to detect oncofetal chondroitin sulfate (ofCS) in
human cancer [16,17]. Finally, rVAR2 conjugated with the
hemiasterlin toxin analog KT886 derived from the marine
sponge Hemiasterella minor (rVAR2 drug conjugate [VDC]
886), showed antitumor activity in non-Hodgkin’s lympho-
ma, prostate cancer, and metastatic breast cancer with no
adverse treatment effects in [19_TD$DIF]non-pregnant mice [16].
We noticed that several cancer-associated proteins can
be modified with an ofCS chain, including CD44 [16],
syndican-1 (SDC1) [18], and chondroitin sulfate proteogly-
can 4 (CSPG4) [19], and that CD44 and SDC1 have previously
been [20_TD$DIF]described as candidate biomarkers in bladder cancer
[20–25]. Accordingly, we hypothesized that human MIBC
might display ofCS chains that could be exploited for rVAR2-
based
targeted
therapy.
In
particular,
we
aimed
to
[21_TD$DIF]interrogate the[3_TD$DIF] ofCS expression[2_TD$DIF] landscape in cisplatin-
resistant
MIBC
with
the
intention
of
developing
an
additional line treatment option for this disease state.

Patients and methods
2.1.
Bladder cancer patient cohorts
Bladder tumor tissue was collected at three institutions (University of
Bern, Switzerland; Vancouver General Hospital, Canada; and University
Hospital of Southampton, UK) from patients receiving at least three
cycles of cisplatin-based NAC prior to radical cystectomy with pelvic
lymph node dissection (Supplementary Table 1). Tissue was harvested
from
prechemotherapy
transurethral
resection
of
bladder
tumor
(TURBT) specimens in all patients and from postchemotherapy radical
cystectomy specimens in patients with residual MIBC (ypT). The Bern
cohort was used as the discovery cohort, and the Vancouver and
Southampton cohorts were amalgamated as the validation cohort.
A complete and detailed description of the patients and methods
used in this study can be found in the Supplementary Information.

Results
To analyze the ofCS expression in bladder cancer pre- and
post-treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, we
performed immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of two
growth of chemoresistant orthotopic bladder cancer xenografts and prolonged survival
(p = 0.005). The[4_TD$DIF] use of cisplatin only for the generation of chemoresistant xenografts are
limitations of our animal model design.
Conclusions: Targeting ofCS provides a promising second-line treatment strategy in cis-
platin-resistant MIBC.
Patient summary: Cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer overexpresses particular sugar chains
compared with chemotherapy-naı
¨ve bladder cancer. Using a recombinant protein from the
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, we can target these sugar chains, and our results
showed a significant antitumor effect in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer. This novel
treatment paradigm provides[5_TD$DIF] therapeutic access [26_TD$DIF]to bladder [27_TD$DIF]cancers not responding to
cisplatin.

 independent cohorts of matched primary chemotherapy-
naı
¨ve and cisplatin-resistant bladder tumors using rVAR2 as
the ofCS detection reagent (Fig. 1A and B, and Supplemen-
tary Fig.
1A–E).
The
ofCS expression
[23_TD$DIF]was
absent in
urothelium of the adjacent normal bladder (Fig. 1A, left)
and [23_TD$DIF]was [24_TD$DIF]highly restricted to the bladder tumors (Fig. 1A,
right). To differentiate ofCS expression between tumor
environment and cancer cell compartments, we performed
IHC analysis of an epithelial marker, E-cadherin, and a
mesenchymal marker, vimentin (Fig. 1A). The pre-chemo-
therapy bladder tumors were sampled by transurethral
resection (TURBT) and the matched cisplatin-resistant
tumors after NAC were sampled from subsequent radical
cystectomy specimens (Fig. 1B). The discovery cohort
comprised more advanced tumors from a single institution
as compared with the validation cohort combined from two
institutions (Supplementary Table 1). Overall, high ofCS
expression was seen in approximately 92% (n = 110/120) of
chemotherapy-naı
¨ve
bladder
tumors
in
both
cohorts.
Among these, 17% (n = 8/47) of the tumors in the discovery
cohort (Fig. 1C, left) and 33% (n = 24/73) of the validation
cohort (Fig. 1C, right) showed high membranous expression
of ofCS (ofCSHigh[2_TD$DIF]) in the cancer cell compartment. In
chemotherapy-naı
¨ve tumors, ofCS expression failed to
predict
response
to
chemotherapy
(p = 0.4,
odds
ra-
tio = 2.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.35–25.87) and
inform
on
survival
in
univariable
and
multivariable
analyses. In cisplatin-resistant disease (ypT), ofCS expres-
sion increased; 57% (n = 16/28, p = 0.001; vs 29%, n = 8/28 in
TURBT) of tumors [25_TD$DIF]had ofCSHigh cancer cells in the discovery
cohort (Fig. 1D, left) and 70% (n = 23/33, p = 0.01; vs 33%,
n = 11/33 in TURBT) in the validation cohort (Fig. 1D, right).
In cisplatin-resistant MIBC, ofCSHigh[4_TD$DIF] was associated with
extravesical extension in[5_TD$DIF] the discovery cohort (p = 0.005)
(Fig. 1E, left, and Fig. 1F) but this was not significant in the
validation cohort (p = 0.081; Fig. 1E, right). The shift in ofCS
expression was associated with poor overall survival in the
discovery cohort (p = 0.045; Fig. 1G, upper part) but not in
the validation cohort (p = 0.5), which had a shorter clinical
follow-up of 3.3 yr (95% CI: 2.52–3.5; Fig. 1G, lower part). In
multivariable analysis, only pathological tumor stage added
independent
prognostic
information
(Supplementary
Table 2). Aggregated, these data indicate that ofCS is
upregulated in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer, and this
event may be associated with a poor outcome.
Several proteoglycans can carry ofCS GAG modifications
[16]. To search for ofCS-modified proteoglycans in bladder
cancer, we analyzed gene expression data of known CS-
modified proteoglycans [16,28] in two independent bladder
cancer cohorts. In both datasets, luminal-type tumors were
enriched for SDC1, SDC4, and APLP2, while more basal
tumors were enriched for a number of genes including CD44
and CSPG4 (Fig. 2A, and Supplementary Fig. 2A-E). SDC1,
CSPG4, and CD44 have been widely associated with
multiple types of cancer [16,18,19], and CD44 and SDC1
have previously been suggested as candidate biomarkers in
bladder cancer [20–25]. Indeed, protein expression of CD44
(Fig. 2B), SDC1 (Fig. 2C), and CSPG4 (Fig. 2D) showed a
strong correlation with mRNA expression (Fig. 2E–G)
that[6_TD$DIF] correlated with ofCSHigh cases (Fig. 2H–J). Together,
these data suggest that CD44, SDC1, and CSPG4 are
expressed in human bladder cancer and associated with
ofCS modifications.
We next analyzed a panel of seven bladder cancer cell
lines derived from MIBC patients for ofCS expression by
flow cytometry using rVAR2 as the ofCS detection reagent.
All MIBC cell lines analyzed expressed ofCS as detected by
rVAR2 in a concentration- and CS-dependent manner
(Fig. 3A). This was supported by sensitivity to the ofCS-
targeting VDC886 drug conjugate [16] in the low-nanomo-
lar IC50 concentration range (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, four out
of seven cell lines expressed CSPG4, seven out of seven
expressed splice variants of CD44, and five out of seven
expressed SDC1 (Fig. 3C), but this expression pattern was
not obviously related to VDC886 sensitivity. This might
indicate that not all of the selected proteoglycans (CD44,
SDC1, and CSPG4) are modified with ofCS in the individual
cell lines and/or that additional proteoglycans contribute to
the ofCS presentation. To investigate this further, we
analyzed whether or not CD44, SDC1, and CSPG4 were
modified with ofCS in UM-UC13 cells. The ofCS-modified
proteins were purified from cell lysates using immobilized
rVAR2. The resulting fractions were treated with chon-
droitinase ABC to reduce the CSPGs down to their core
protein component. In this analysis, a shift in gel mobility
toward the predicted protein size on SDS-PAGE upon
chondroitinase ABC treatment would imply CS substitution.
Surprisingly, while CD44, SDC1, and CSPG4 were expressed
in UM-UC13 cells, only SDC1 and CSPG4 produced a shift in
molecular weight after chondroitin treatment (Fig. 3D).
Chondroitinase ABC treatment did not reduce the size of
SDC1 to its predicted core protein size, but merely produced
an intermediary sized protein. This is in line with the
heparan sulfate substitution status of SDC1, a GAG that will
not be digested with chondroitinase ABC. These data
indicate that SDC1 and CSPG4, but not CD44, are ofCS
modified in UM-UC13 cells. To validate this result, we
treated UM-UC13 cells with validated siRNAs targeting
CD44, SDC1, and CSPG4, and assayed for binding to rVAR2 as
an indication of ofCS expression. While the CD44 siRNA had
no effect on rVAR2 binding, SDC1 and CSPG4 siRNAs
reduced rVAR2 binding to UM-UC13 cells by 50% and 20%,
respectively (Fig. 3E). This corroborates the biochemical
analysis showing that SDC1 and CSPG4, but not CD44, are
ofCS modified in UM-UC13 cells, reflecting that ofCS
modification of eligible proteins is not mandatory and
likely a dynamic event.
To assess the expression of ofCS-modified proteoglycans
in cells treated with cisplatin in vivo we inoculated UM-
UC13 cells into the bladder wall of nude mice with
ultrasound
guidance
(Supplementary
Fig.
3A
and
B)
[26,27]. As the UM-UC13 tumors developed, the mice were
subjected to cisplatin treatment and resistant tumors were
allowed to recover. To analyze the ofCS modification status
of proteoglycans in UM-UC13 tumors and to potentially
identify novel proteoglycans, we purified ofCS-associated
proteoglycans from ex vivo cells and analyzed those by mass
spectrometry. This analysis identified eight ofCS-modified

 proteoglycans including SDC1 and CSPG4 (Supplementary
Table 3). Similar to the in vitro cell line study, this analysis
showed that CD44 was not modified with ofCS in UM-UC13
cells, and that ofCS modification of SDC1 and CSPG4 was
retained in vivo. Proximity-ligation assay analysis of ofCS
chains and CD44, SDC1, and CSPG4 confirmed the mass
spectrometry result (Supplementary Fig. 3C), but surpris-
ingly, CD44 was also in proximity to ofCS. This suggests that
while CD44 is not itself modified with ofCS in UM-UC13 cells,
it is indeed expressed in close proximity to ofCS-modified
proteoglycans.
Capitalizing on our findings that human cisplatin-
resistant MIBC upregulates ofCS (Fig. 1A–F) and that MIBC
cells are sensitive to VDC886 in vitro (Fig. 3B), we next tested
whether VDC886 had efficacy against cisplatin-resistant
MIBC in vivo. Again, UM-UC13 cells were inoculated into the
bladder wall of nude mice with ultrasound guidance
(Supplementary Fig. 3A and B) and tumor growth was
subsequently monitored using ultrasound over a 40–60 days
period (Supplementary Fig. 4A). As the UM-UC13 tumors
developed, the mice were subjected to repeating cycles of
cisplatin treatment and the resultant tumors were passaged
through six generations of mice (G1–G6) creating highly
stable cisplatin-resistant xenografts (Fig. 4A). Importantly,
the ex vivo tumor cells retained their rVAR2 binding in a
concentration- and CS-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). They
also retained the same rVAR2 internalization capacity as the
parental line, G0 (Fig. 4C). Notably, the completely cisplatin-
resistant G6 and cisplatin-sensitive G0 cells showed equal
sensitivity to VDC886 ex vivo (Fig. 4D and Supplementary
Fig. 4B).
Next, mice with established G6-initiated cisplatin-
resistant tumors were randomized into four groups and
treated bi-weekly (four treatments in total) with vehicle,
rVAR2, KT886, or VDC886 (Fig. 4E) in combination with
cisplatin. The G6 cisplatin-resistant tumors expressed SDC1,

 CSPG4, and ofCS (Supplementary Fig. 4C). Remarkably,
VDC886 treatment strongly retarded growth of cisplatin-
resistant tumors (Fig. 4F and G) and significantly prolonged
survival of the mice (Fig. 4H). Importantly, a clinicopatho-
logical examination of VDC886-treated mice demonstrated
no organ toxicity (Supplementary Fig. 4D) and the weight of
the mice was stable in all groups (Supplementary Fig. 4E). In
the VDC886-treated group, one mouse had complete
response, one mouse presented with significant tumor
regression (Supplementary Fig. 4F), and four mice had
stable tumor growth inhibition without progression during
the experiment, with viable tumor cells in histology. In
summary, our work demonstrates that ofCS-modified
proteoglycans can provide therapeutic access to cisplatin-
resistant MIBC.

Discussion
We have tested an unconventional approach for treating
cisplatin-resistant MIBC based on the evolutionarily refined
parasite–host anchor protein VAR2CSA derived from the
malaria parasite P. falciparum. We found that ofCS was

 present at high levels in cisplatin-resistant MIBC, promoting
ofCS as a potential access point for targeted therapy.
Supporting this notion, VDC886 was able to suppress the
growth of cisplatin-resistant MIBC. High ofCS expression
was associated with advanced tumor stage, cisplatin
resistance, and poor overall survival of MIBC patients.
These associations were more robust in the discovery
cohort, which contained more advanced disease and a
longer follow-up. In the validation cohort, presentation of
ofCS was not prognostic. While this suggests that high ofCS
may only relate to survival in more advanced MIBC, this
association requires further investigation.
Several different proteoglycans can be modified with
ofCS chains [16]. As a result, intratumoral heterogeneity in
proteoglycan expression does not necessarily translate into
varying levels of ofCS modifications. CD44 has previously
been
shown
to
carry
ofCS
chains

expression correlated with high ofCS presentation in MIBC,
but biochemical interrogation showed that CD44 was not
modified with ofCS, at least not in UM-UC13 cells. Contrary
to CD44,[19_TD$DIF] SDC1 and CSPG4 were modified in UM-UC13 cells
and correlated with ofCS expression in primary tumors.
Mass spectrometry of rVAR2-purified proteoglycans iden-
tified another six ofCS-modified candidates. It is likely that
additional proteoglycans contribute to ofCS presentation in
MIBC.
The most important finding of our study was the
increased cellular ofCS expression in cisplatin-resistant
MIBC when compared with paired chemotherapy-naı
¨ve
MIBC. These findings suggest that targeting ofCS with
[72_TD$DIF]VDC886 [79_TD$DIF]provides an attractive approach, particularly in
cisplatin-resistant MIBC. The first-generation VDC com-
pound VDC886 comprises the DBL1X-ID2a domains of the
malarial VAR2CSA protein loaded with an average of three
KT886 hemiasterlin toxin analogs derived from the marine
sponge H. minor [16]. VDC886 eliminated all MIBC cell lines
in the low-nanomolar IC50 concentration range. As all the
MIBC cell lines investigated express high levels of ofCS, the
small differences in IC50 are most likely due to differences in
internalization kinetics. In an animal model of cisplatin-
resistant MIBC, VDC886 was able to efficiently target
established cisplatin-resistant tumors and rescue the mice
from tumor-associated morbidity and death. The complete-
ly cisplatin-resistant G6 and cisplatin-sensitive G0 cells
isolated from mice showed equal sensitivity to VDC886 ex
vivo. This is likely due to high baseline levels of ofCS in MIBC
cell lines and suggests that the ofCS modification is a
passenger, rather than a driver, of cisplatin resistance.
Nevertheless, ofCS GAG modifications constitute a thera-
peutic access point in cisplatin-resistant MIBC.

Conclusions
We have found an oncofetal GAG antigen in cisplatin-
resistant MIBC that can be targeted by a malarial host–cell
anchor protein armed with hemiasterlin compounds. This
discovery potentially offers a new treatment paradigm for
human MIBC patients not responding to cisplatin.
