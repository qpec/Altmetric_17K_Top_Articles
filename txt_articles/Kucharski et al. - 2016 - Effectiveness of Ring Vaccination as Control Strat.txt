Using an Ebola virus disease transmission model, we found 
that addition of ring vaccination at the outset of the West 
Africa epidemic might not have led to containment of this 
disease. However, in later stages of the epidemic or in 
 
outbreaks with less intense transmission or more effective 
control, this strategy could help eliminate the disease.
D
uring 2014–2015, trials of candidate vaccines for Eb-
ola virus disease (EVD) were fast tracked in response 
to the unprecedented EVD epidemic in West Africa (1). In 
March 2015, a phase 3 ring vaccination trial of a recombi-
nant vesicular stomatitis virus–Zaire Ebola virus vaccine 
began in Guinea (2). Interim trial results suggested that the 
vaccine could have a high level of efficacy in humans (3). 
Ring vaccination has also been used for disease control, 
notably in the final stages of the smallpox eradication pro-
gram (4). Furthermore, a recent modeling study calibrated 
by using population-level EVD data from Sierra Leone and 
Liberia (5) suggested that ring vaccination could supple-
ment case isolation and contact tracing in reducing trans-
mission. However, it remains unclear whether prompt ring 
vaccination, as opposed to large-scale mass vaccination, 
could have contained the EVD epidemic in West Africa, 
and under what circumstances it could be effective in con-
trolling future outbreaks.
The Study
We developed a stochastic model of EVD transmission 
(online Technical Appendix, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/
article/22/1/15-1410-Techapp1.pdf) using individual-level 
transmission data from Guinea to inform our model struc-
ture. Transmission chains during March–August 2014 sug-
gest substantial variation in the number of secondary cases 
generated (6,7). In particular, index cases, defined as those 
that could not be linked to an already known transmission 
chain, had a reproduction number of Rm = 7, where m in-
dicates missed cases and Rm denotes the average number 
of secondary cases generated, whereas cases within known 
transmission chains (w) had a reproduction number of Rw = 
0.66 (online Technical Appendix, Figure 1).
In the model, transmission followed a branching 
process (8), and secondary cases were generated from a 
negative binomial distribution to include potential for su-
perspreading events (6,9). Each cluster started with an in-
dex case, which generated an average of Rm = 7 secondary 
cases. Many EVD cases reported in Guinea were not part of 
already known transmission chains (online Technical Ap-
pendix, Figure 2). We therefore assumed there was a prob-
ability ρ that a secondary case would missed and go on to 
seed an independent transmission cluster as an index case 
with Rm = 7. Otherwise, the case would remain within the 
known chain of transmission (with probability 1 – ρ); these 
cases would then generate an average of Rw = 0.66 second-
ary cases. The simulated outbreaks ended when, by chance, 
no secondary cases were generated by active cases. Dis-
tributions of incubation period, duration of infectiousness, 
and time to reporting were obtained from reported values 
for Guinea in 2014 (10). Model simulations produced simi-
lar patterns to those observed in 2014 (Figure 1). When half 
of the cases were missed, the overall reproduction number, 
defined as the mean number of secondary cases generated 
across all infectious persons, was ≈1.5, which was similar 
to values observed in early 2014 in West Africa (11) and in 
the initial stages of other outbreaks (online Technical Ap-
pendix Table 1).
We simulated ring vaccination by using a protocol 
similar to that used in Guinea trial (3). We defined a ring as 
all persons who could potentially form part of the known 
chain of transmission (i.e., traceable contacts of infected 
persons within a transmission cluster and their contacts). 
Once the index case was reported, we assumed it took 2 
days to vaccinate a ring and that protective immunity de-
veloped 7 days after vaccination. In the model, we assumed 
that vaccine efficacy was 80% and that 70% of the ring 
received vaccination (online Technical Appendix). The re-
production number within a ring was therefore reduced by 
a factor of 1 –(0.8 × 0.7) = 0.44 once the vaccine became 
effective (online Technical Appendix Figure 3).
To estimate the effect of ring vaccination, we simu-
lated multiple outbreaks and calculated the proportion of 
these outbreaks that became large (i.e., >500 clusters). We 
found that if more than a few cases were missed, large out-
breaks could occur under ring vaccination (Figure 2, panel 
A). This event could occur because missed cases, which had 
a higher reproduction number, would not be inside the ring 
when vaccination was introduced. Although ring vaccina-
tion failed to contain the outbreak in this scenario, it still 
reduced disease transmission (online Technical Appendix

Strategy for Ebola Virus Disease

Figure 4). We also considered the effect of preemptive mass 
vaccination, which reduced the reproduction number for all 
cases by a factor of 0.44, regardless of whether cases were 
in the cluster or missed. This strategy was more effective 
in containing outbreaks, even if many cases were missed 
 
(Figure 2, panel A). Similar qualitative patterns were ob-
served when vaccine efficacy was 95% (online Technical 
Appendix Figure 5).
In the later stages of the EVD epidemic in West Africa, 
behavior changes and improved control measures led to less 
transmission from burials and in hospital settings than in 
early 2014 (12). Similar reductions were observed in other 
Ebola outbreaks (e.g., in 1976 in Yambuku, Zaire) (13). We 
therefore also explored a partial control scenario. We omit-
ted index cases in the 2014 Guinea transmission chains that 
were involved in funeral or hospital transmission, which re-
sulted in Rm = 2.5 for missed cases (online Technical Appen-
dix Figure 6). We also assumed a shorter duration of infec-
tiousness and time to reporting on the basis of data for 2015 
(3,10) (online Technical Appendix Table 2).
In this partial control scenario, outbreaks could be con-
trolled with ring vaccination, even if 40% of cases were 
missed (Figure 2, panel B). Our results suggest that ring 
vaccination could substantially reduce the potential size 
and duration of outbreaks if other control measures are also 
in place (Table). We also estimated how many vaccine dos-
es would be required for ring vaccination (online Technical 
Appendix); in the partial control scenario, several thousand 
doses might be needed (online Technical Appendix Table 
3). We could not estimate doses required for mass vacci-
nation, and thus could not perform an economic analysis 
of different strategies, because this would depend on the 
potential for long-distance transmission events and popu-
lations in different areas. However, implementing mass 
vaccination for even a single district in West Africa could 
require >100,000 doses.
Our analysis has some limitations. In the early 2014 
transmission scenario, we assumed that missed cases had a 
much higher reproduction number than cases within clus-
ters. However, if an effective vaccine became available, 
persons at risk might be more likely to engage with public 
health efforts. The high reproduction number for index cas-
es might also be caused in part by ascertainment bias: cases 
that generate many secondary infections are more likely to 
be designated as index cases. We also assumed that mass 
vaccination would target 70% of the population at random; 
in practice, there could be clustering effects. Furthermore, 
we assumed that chains of transmission were independent 
and that the reproduction number remained unchanged over 
time. In reality, missed cases might have shared contacts 
and behavior might change during outbreak, which could 
reduce transmission. Our estimates are therefore likely to 
represent a reasonable worst-case scenario.

Ring Vaccination as Control Strategy for EVD
Figure 2. Effectiveness of vaccination strategies for Ebola virus disease under different transmission scenarios. A) Proportion of simulations 
that led to a large outbreak (defined as >500 clusters) in the early 2014 Guinea transmission scenario. Red lines indicate no vaccination, 
green lines indicate ring vaccination, blue lines indicate mass vaccination; solid lines indicate outbreaks that started with 1 index case, 
and dashed lines indicate outbreaks that started with 5 index cases. We simulated 1,000 outbreaks and calculated the proportion that 
resulted in >500 clusters. When the space between the red and green lines is large, the model suggests that ring vaccination would provide 
substantial additional value over standard public health control measures alone. B) Proportion of simulations that led to a large outbreak in 
partial control scenario.

Conclusions
Ring vaccination enhances standard public health mea-
sures of contact tracing, isolation, and community en-
gagement (14) and could be effective when such mea-
sures are in place. However, if standard measures are not 
working because many cases are not in known transmis-
sion chains, as in West Africa in early 2014, ring vac-
cination might be insufficient to contain the outbreak. If 
an EVD vaccine is shown to be efficacious, our results 
suggest that mass vaccination, or hybrid strategies in-
volving mass and ring vaccinations, might need to be 
considered alongside ring vaccination when planning for 
future outbreaks.
