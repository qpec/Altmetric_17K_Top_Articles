ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND His bundle pacing is a new method for delivering cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).
OBJECTIVES The authors performed a head-to-head, high-precision, acute crossover comparison between His bundle
pacing and conventional biventricular CRT, measuring effects on ventricular activation and acute hemodynamic function.
METHODS Patients with heart failure and left bundle branch block referred for conventional biventricular CRT were
recruited. Using noninvasive epicardial electrocardiographic imaging, the authors identified patients in whom His bundle
pacing shortened left ventricular activation time. In these patients, the authors compared the hemodynamic effects of His
bundle pacing against biventricular pacing using a high-multiple repeated alternation protocol to minimize the effect of
noise, as well as comparing effects on ventricular activation.
RESULTS In 18 of 23 patients, left ventricular activation time was significantly shortened by His bundle pacing.
Seventeen patients had a complete electromechanical dataset. In them, His bundle pacing was more effective at deliv-
ering ventricular resynchronization than biventricular pacing: greater reduction in QRS duration (�18.6 ms; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI]: �31.6 to �5.7 ms; p ¼ 0.007), left ventricular activation time (�26 ms; 95% CI: �41 to �21 ms;
p ¼ 0.002), and left ventricular dyssynchrony index (�11.2 ms; 95% CI: �16.8 to �5.6 ms; p < 0.001). His bundle pacing
also produced a greater acute hemodynamic response (4.6 mm Hg; 95% CI: 0.2 to 9.1 mm Hg; p ¼ 0.04). The
incremental activation time reduction with His bundle pacing over biventricular pacing correlated with the incremental
hemodynamic improvement with His bundle pacing over biventricular pacing (R ¼ 0.70; p ¼ 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS His resynchronization delivers better ventricular resynchronization, and greater improvement
in hemodynamic parameters, than biventricular pacing. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2018;72:3112–22) © 2018 The Authors.

 L
eft bundle branch block (LBBB) is deleterious
in patients with heart failure. Biventricular
pacing
improves
the
activation
pattern,
instantly shortening left ventricular activation time
(LVAT) and immediately improving cardiac function.
Long-term
studies show
substantial
reduction
in
morbidity and mortality (1,2).
Biventricular pacing (BVP) was first recognized as a
potentially beneficial therapy from its clear hemody-
namic effect (3). Relative to native LBBB, biven-
tricular pacing (BVP) was found to shorten QRS
duration (QRSd) and LVAT, earning it the moniker of
“cardiac resynchronization therapy” (CRT). In fact,
BVP results in the fusion of 2 nonphysiological wave
fronts, resulting in only modest reductions in QRSd
(4–7). Computer modeling suggests that there is a
large potential to deliver greater improvements in
cardiac
function
if
more
effective
ventricular
resynchronization could be achieved (5).
His bundle pacing (HBP) has the potential to offer
greater ventricular resynchronization because large
reductions in QRSd have been observed when stim-
ulating the His-Purkinje system in patients with LBBB
(8,9). How this compares with BVP is beginning to be
explored (9–11) but, crucially, there is no within-
patient comparison between HBP and BVP, of hemo-
dynamic measurements alongside detailed electrical
activation mapping.
In this prospective study, we tested the ability of
HBP to deliver resynchronization. We then compared
the electromechanical effects of His resynchroniza-
tion against conventional BVP, using high-precision
hemodynamic
assessment
(12)
and
noninvasive
epicardial ventricular activation mapping (7).
METHODS
HIS
RESYNCHRONIZATION. We
defined
His
resynchronization as HBP that significantly shortens
LVAT. We measured LVAT using noninvasive epicar-
dial electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI). Because the
margin of error of this measurement is up to 10 ms,
we
defined
shortening
as
10
ms
to
assess
true
resynchronization effects rather than measurement
variation.
STUDY POPULATION. Patients at a single tertiary
cardiac
center
(Hammersmith
Hospital,
London,
United Kingdom) scheduled for conventional biven-
tricular
pacemaker
implantation
with
or
without
defibrillator were recruited. Indications for BVP were
based on standard clinical criteria (13); inclusion
criteria for the study were LBBB with QRSd >130 ms,
ejection fraction <35%, and New York Heart
Association functional class II to IV. Patients
who were unable to give consent, or were
clinically unstable, were excluded. All par-
ticipants gave written, informed consent, and
the study was approved by the local ethics
committee (13/LO/1440).
NONINVASIVE
EPICARDIAL
ELECTRICAL
MAPPING (ECGI). Patients were fitted with a
252-electrode ECGI vest (Medtronic, Minne-
apolis, Minnesota) (14) before the procedure
and underwent low-dose thoracic computed
tomography to acquire electrode and cardiac
positions. Continuous ECGI recordings were
obtained
throughout
the
hemodynamic
study. From the individual electrogram acti-
vations, the left ventricular (LV) total activa-
tion time was calculated, as described in the
Online Appendix. By calculating the shortest
interval that spans 95% of activations recor-
ded from the left ventricle (LVAT-95), we
minimized the potential skewing of LV total
activation time by noise and misannotation
of outliers, while still measuring activation of almost
the entire LV surface. Left ventricular dyssynchrony
index (LVDI) was also calculated as the standard de-
viation of individual activations recorded from the
LV, which has been proposed as a measure of intra-
ventricular dyssynchrony (15). For each ventricular
activation parameter, the average of 5 beats each was
taken for AAI pacing, HBP, and BVP.
PACING. Temporary HBP was achieved via either the
femoral or subclavian approach. If the femoral route
was used, a quadripolar electrophysiology catheter
was placed on the bundle of His, and a second catheter
was positioned in the right atrial appendage for
sequential atrial followed by His (AH) pacing. If the
subclavian route was used, a SelectSecure 3830 lead
was delivered via either a C304-His deflectable sheath
or C315 fixed curve sheath (leads and delivery system:
Medtronic). The lead was not actively fixated. The
atrial lead for the CRT device was used to allow AH
sequential pacing. The atrial and His leads were con-
nected to the Micropace pacing system (Micropace EP,
Santa Ana, California) that allowed pacing at selected
AH delays. To minimize the research protocol duration
during implant procedures, we did not routinely
measure
capture
threshold
or
LBBB
correction
thresholds, because we did not actively fixate the His
lead. The Micropace pacing output was programmed
to 25 mA for all patients. Although this is a high output,
this does not reflect the threshold of correction and
furthermore Ajijola et al. (10) have demonstrated very

(Top left) A minimum of 4 alternations between AAI pacing and HBP or BVP were performed for each tested AV delay (therefore, a total of 8 transitions). For each
alternation, relative change in SBP was calculated and the mean of the 8 transitions was calculated. (Top right) As more transitions occur, more data points are
collected for change in SBP, eventually resulting in 10 values with mean and confidence intervals. Single or few measurements result in highly inaccurate estimates due
to variability. (Bottom) A mean and confidence interval are calculated for each AV delay for both HBP (purple) and BVP (orange). An example is shown of quadratic
curves fitted to data from multiple transitions at a range of AV delays to produce the peak systolic blood pressure responses. AV ¼ atrioventricular; BP ¼ blood
pressure; BVP ¼ biventricular pacing; ECG ¼ electrocardiogram; HBP ¼ His bundle pacing; SBP ¼ systolic blood pressure.

 to the intrinsic (unpaced) QRS, without shortening of
the QRSd, the lead was repositioned. Data were only
included for analysis if HBP resulted in a shortening
of LVAT by at least 10 ms. We used this measure
because it can be applied without bias (as opposed to
inspection of morphology), assesses LV synchrony,
and is unlikely to be affected by the presence or
absence of local myocardial capture with nonselective
or selective capture, respectively.
Biventricular pacing was performed via the CRT
device, which was implanted using the standard
clinical technique (described in full in the Online
Appendix).
ACUTE
HEMODYNAMIC
STUDY. Invasive
beat-
by-beat
blood
pressure
was
recorded
from
the
femoral or radial artery, depending on patient pref-
erence.
The
blood
pressure
signal
was
acquired
using a transducer and amplifier (Dynascope DS-7100,
Fukuda Denshi, Tokyo, Japan). Some patients agreed
to the study protocol but declined the additional
invasive monitoring. In these patients, noninvasive
beat-by-beat blood pressure was acquired (Finapres
NOVA,
Finapres
Medical
Systems,
Enschede,
the
Netherlands), which has been previously validated
for the assessment of acute hemodynamic changes in
this
setting
(18).
Changes
in
this
measurement
correlate well with changes in invasively measured
LV dP/dt (18), a measure of cardiac contractility that is
largely independent of the degree of loading force.
The
hemodynamic
data
were
acquired
alongside
surface ECG data using a data acquisition system
(National Instruments, Austin, Texas) and recorded
using customized software.
The
12-lead
ECG
re-
cordings were made using the BARD electrophysi-
ology
lab
system
(Boston
Scientific,
Natick,
Massachusetts) alongside ECGI.

 HIGH-PRECISION
HEMODYNAMIC
PROTOCOL. We
have previously shown the importance of performing
multiple
repeated
hemodynamic
measurements
between a reference and tested setting, in order to
prevent
spontaneous
fluctuations
being
mis-
construed as a response to pacing therapy (19). We
summarize the aspects of the protocol that generate
precise estimates of hemodynamic response here and
a full description is found in the Online Appendix
and in our previous work employing and validating
this
method
(12,20,21).
We
performed
multiple
transitions between atrial pacing (AAI), as a refer-
ence setting, and the tested pacing intervention
(HBP or BVP) at a given AV delay. We compared the
mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) of multiple beats
immediately preceding a transition, with the mean
SBP immediately after transition and calculated the
difference as a response to the pacing intervention.
Therefore, the mean of multiple responses (from
multiple transitions) is recorded for each AV delay.
Because the hemodynamic response to pacing is
highly dependent on the AV delay (due to changes
in LV filling), this process was repeated for multiple
AV delays. This method results in at least 768 indi-
vidual SBP measurements per patient being utilized
in
a
statistically
efficient
way
to
overcome
the
signal-to-noise limitation of typical hemodynamic
assessments
with
few
or
single
hemodynamic
measurements.
ANALYSIS OF HEMODYNAMIC DATA. The peak blood
pressure response and its CIs were calculated by
fitting a quadratic curve to the data from each
set
of
tested
AV
delays
(Figure
1).
Analysis
of
hemodynamic data was automated using Python,
version 3.6 (Python Software Foundation, Wilming-
ton,
Delaware)
so
that
few
user
inputs
were
required. Robust regression methods were used so
that outliers did not need to be manually removed
(iterated reweighted least squares and the Huber
estimator using the rlm package [22]).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. In the primary analysis, we
included all patients with a complete dataset, in
whom the His-paced LVAT-95 was at least 10 ms
shorter than during intrinsic conduction. This was
selected on the basis of the standard deviation of the
difference for change in LVAT-95 being <10 ms so that
changes larger than this could be attributed to true
resynchronization effects rather than measurement
variation. Furthermore, this stringent cutoff could be
applied without the potential for unintentional bias
introduced by the researcher (unlike morphological
analysis) and assesses LV activation regardless of
whether selective or nonselective capture occurs. The
power calculation for this sample size is in the Online
Appendix. Baseline characteristics were tabulated and
summarized
with
appropriate
statistics.
Within-
patient comparisons between the hemodynamic and
electrical parameters were performed using paired
Student’s t-tests. The relationship between the he-
modynamic response and change in activation time
was analyzed using Pearson’s correlation. Statistical
analyses were performed using the statistical envi-
ronment R (23) with the ggplot2 visualization package.
RESULTS
Twenty-three patients were recruited. In 4 patients,
temporary HBP did not shorten LVAT-95 by $10 ms,
and these patients were therefore excluded from the
main analysis. In 1 patient, a technical fault pre-
vented acquisition of ECGI data, and they were
therefore also excluded from the analysis.
Eighteen
patients
therefore
demonstrated
the
10-ms LVAT-95 shortening required by our definition
of His resynchronization. In 1 of them, ECGI data
could be collected during His pacing, but not during
BVP.
Therefore, the full dataset of ECGI and hemody-
namic data for both HBP and BVP was available in 17
patients (Table 1). Six had a history of a previous
myocardial infarction, and the remainder were diag-
nosed with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.
ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL
RESPONSES. Both
HBP
and BVP significantly shortened 12-lead ECG QRSd
(�33.7 ms; 95% confidence interval [CI]: �46.1 to
� 21.3 ms; p < 0.001; �17 ms; 95% CI: �27.3 to �7.1 ms;
p ¼ 0.002, respectively). HBP resulted in significantly

 more QRS shortening compared with BVP: the mean
within-patient change in QRSd from BVP to HBP
was �18.6 ms (95% CI: �31.6 to �5.7 ms; p ¼ 0.007)
(Figure 2).
Using noninvasive epicardial mapping, both His
bundle
and
BVP
significantly
reduced
LVAT-95
compared with intrinsic activation (�43.3 ms; 95%
CI: �51.7 to �34.8 ms; p < 0.001; �16.7 ms; 95%
CI: �29.1 to �4.4 ms; p ¼ 0.01, respectively). HBP
reduced LVAT-95 significantly more than BVP: the
mean within-patient change in LVAT-95 from BVP to
HBP was �26.4 ms (95% CI: �41.2 to �11.6 ms;
p ¼ 0.02) (Figure 3). Using a 1-way analysis of variance,
the standard deviation of LVAT-95 measurements
during HBP was 6.6 ms, and the standard deviation of
the difference for change in LVAT-95 was 9.2 ms.
Both HBP and BVP significantly reduced the LVDI
(�17.0 ms; 95% CI: �21.9 to �12.0 ms; p < 0.001;
�5.73 ms; 95% CI: �11.1 to �0.3 ms; p ¼0.04). HBP
reduced LVDI significantly more than BVP: the mean
within-patient change in LVDI from BVP to HBP
was �11.3 ms (95% CI: �16.8 to �5.6 ms; p < 0.001)
(Figure 4). An example of epicardial activation maps
and ECGs are shown in Figure 5.
HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSES. Both His bundle and
BVP significantly increased acute SBP compared with
AAI pacing (12.4 mm Hg; 95% CI: 8.6 to 16.2 mm Hg;
p < 0.001; 7.8 mm Hg; 95% CI: 4.2 to 11.4 mm Hg;
p < 0.001, respectively) in the 18 eligible patients in
whom the full hemodynamic dataset was acquired.
The improvement in SBP was significantly higher
with HBP than with BVP (4.6 mm Hg; 95% CI: 0.2 to
9.1 mm Hg; p ¼ 0.04) (Figure 6).

 shortening of LVAT (LVAT-95) achieved by HBP over
BVP against the incremental increase in blood pressure
achieved by HBP over BVP. By contrast, the correlation
between 12-lead QRSd reduction and hemodynamic
response was not significant (p ¼ 0.119).
RESPONSE IN PATIENTS WITHOUT >10 MS LVAT-95
SHORTENING FROM INTRINSIC. In the 4 patients
where HBP did not reduce LVAT-95 by >10 ms, there
was still an increase in SBP with HBP (4 mm Hg;
95% CI: �4.1 to 12.1 mm Hg; p ¼ 0.20).
DISCUSSION
In this study we have, for the first time, quantified the
acute effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy
delivered with HBP, using high-precision hemody-
namic measurements, and performed within-patient
comparisons with BVP. We found that His resynch-
ronization
therapy
delivers
significantly
greater
improvements in acute hemodynamic response than
BVP (Central Illustration). We used electroanatomic
mapping to explore the mechanisms of this benefit.
The additional improvements in hemodynamic func-
tion
appear
to
be
driven
by
improvements
in
ventricular activation time occurring as a result of
more effective ventricular resynchronization.
ACUTE HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSE. We found that
HBP successfully delivered ventricular resynchroni-
zation in 83% of patients. In these patients, where
HBP convincingly shortens LVAT, His resynchroni-
zation
therapy
resulted
in
significantly
greater
improvements
in
acute
hemodynamic
function
compared with BVP. His resynchronization therapy
delivered approximately a 60% increase in acute
SBP, compared with BVP (4.6 mm Hg additional
His-resynchronization SBP improvement over
the
7.8 mm Hg with BVP).
BVP is the current gold standard method for deliv-
ering CRT. Hemodynamic studies have consistently
demonstrated
acute
improvements
when
BVP
is
delivered to patients with LBBB and LV impairment
(3,24)
and
subsequent
longer-term
studies
have
confirmed reductions in morbidity and mortality. In
LBBB, all-cause mortality is reduced by 34% (hazard
ratio: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.78, from a 3,872-patient
analysis) (2). If the 60% larger increase in SBP observed
with His resynchronization therapy translates into
longer-term endpoints, clinically important improve-
ments in outcomes may ensue. Ideally, the increase in
SBP would translate to an additional 20% reduction in
mortality over BVP (60% of the 34% mortality reduc-
tion with BVP), which is similar to the mortality
reduction
observed
with prognostic
heart
failure
pharmacotherapy (25). This hypothesis needs to be

MECHANISM
OF
IMPROVEMENT
WITH
HIS
RESYNCHRONIZATION
THERAPY. The
correlation
between activation time shortening and acute he-
modynamic response suggests that the improved
hemodynamic response with HBP is driven by more
effective ventricular resynchronization (Figure 7).
His resynchronization therapy provided more than
twice
as
much
reduction
in
LVAT-95
and
LVDI
compared with BVP. BVP therapy appears to deliver
some of its beneficial effect by improving atrioven-
tricular timing (5), and the same would be expected of
HBP, which may explain the smaller percentage
improvement in hemodynamic response compared
with
the
magnitude
of
intraventricular
electrical
synchronization.
The ventricular activation maps obtained during
His pacing typically showed resolution of the LBBB
activation pattern seen during intrinsic conduction.
Figure 5 shows an example of LBBB resolution with
selective HBP. This supports the concept that His
resynchronization is achieved by recruiting LV con-
duction fibers, as suggested by Lustgarten et al. (9).
By contrast, BVP produces nonphysiological activa-
tion patterns. Biventricular pacing is not a perfect
resynchronization tool: relying on slow cell-to-cell
conduction limits the degree of ventricular resynch-
ronization that can be achieved. Indeed, BVP induces
ventricular dyssynchrony when applied to patients
with a narrow QRS (7), resulting in worse clinical
outcomes (26).
Our finding that the degree of shortening of ven-
tricular
activation
time
is
proportional
to
the
improvement in function is potentially important.
Ventricular activation could feasibly be quantified at
the time of lead implantation. The His lead could then
be positioned at the site of greatest activation time
reduction, to facilitate maximal improvements in
myocardial performance.
His
pacing
has
other
potential
advantages
compared with BVP. It does not require the use of
contrast and is not limited by diaphragmatic capture
or the constraints of the coronary sinus anatomy.
POSSIBLE MECHANISMS BY WHICH HBP IMPROVES
ACTIVATION
TIMES. There
are
several
possible
explanations for how His Bundle pacing reduces
activation time in bundle branch block. The simplest
explanation is that the pacing lead is positioned
distal to the site of block, thus recruiting distal con-
duction fibers that are longitudinally dissociated
(electrical bypass) (27,28). This would not explain
how shortening is achieved when the lead is appar-
ently located proximal to the block, because HBP is
usually achieved from the right atrium, whereas the
anatomic site of block may be below the bundle of
His, within the ventricles. Therefore, alternative ex-
planations
argue
that
although
the
lead
is
not
anatomically distal to the block, electrical energy is
nevertheless
applied
to
distal
conduction
fibers
either
through
a
large
volume
of
myocardium
encompassed by the pacing stimulus (virtual elec-
trode
hypothesis)
or
high
energy
(source–sink
hypothesis). Although more local myocardium might
be captured, increasing the size of the pseudo-delta
wave, the majority of myocardium is activated by
the restored His-Purkinje system. Another possible
explanation is that distal fibers may unfurl back
proximally, closer to the lead, resulting in retrograde
activation up these fibers.
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
EXISTING
EVIDENCE. Our
study expands upon the existing published reports
regarding correction of LBBB by HBP with important
new consequences. Lustgarten et al. (9) have per-
formed a crossover comparison of permanent HBP
and BVP, showing feasibility of permanent HBP in
this population. They observed that, with respect to
their effects on symptomatic, functional, and echo-
cardiographic outcomes, HBP was not inferior to BVP
(9). They also displayed an example of convincing
acute hemodynamic improvement with HBP. Our
study extends this pioneering work, by applying
high
precision
measurements
systematically.
We
found that HBP delivered a significantly greater
improvement in acute hemodynamic function than
BVP. Lustgarten et al. (9) observed a narrower QRS
with selective, but not nonselective, HBP compared
with BVP. We used high-resolution ECGI measure-
ments, allowing us to assess LVAT, which is less
likely to be influenced by nonselective capture. We
found a close correlation between LV activation time
and acute hemodynamic response. Further studies
have demonstrated that permanent His resynchro-
nization therapy is technically possible in patients
with LBBB and heart failure with very low and stable
thresholds (8,10,29). Therefore, it is now feasible to
perform clinical trials to test whether the acute im-
provements
in
ventricular
resynchronization
and
hemodynamic
function
we
observed
with
His
resynchronization
therapy,
translate
into
longer-
term benefits.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. The study has many fewer
patients than a long-term event trial. This is because

variables, rather

 than event counting, each patient contributes far
more power. By using high-precision hemodynamic
assessment and high-resolution electrical mapping,
we were able to confidently assess the individual
patient
responses
and
correlate
the
electrical
response to the hemodynamic response. The source
of precision and statistical power is the large numbers
of measurements per patient, which provided narrow
error-bar measurements. This study was not specif-
ically powered to discriminate different responses of
ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies to HBP.
However, it was encouraging that we observed suc-
cessful His resynchronization in both.
This was an acute hemodynamic study. We do not
know if the significant improvements in activation
time and acute hemodynamic response we observed
will translate into better hemodynamic outcomes
with longer-term follow-up. The previous experience
with
BVP
supports
the
concept
that
short-term
resynchronization induced improvements translate
into longer-term benefits. However, this question can
only be answered by randomized controlled trials
with long-term follow up. The findings from this
study provide justification for these trials. Ventricular
remodeling
in
response
to
chronic
electrical
resynchronization may contribute to the long-term
clinical improvements seen with BVP. It is plausible
that superior ventricular resynchronization with HBP
may lead to greater long-term effects on ventricular
remodeling, but this needs to be tested in dedicated
studies.
Biventricular pacing is reported to be variable in its
response rate (30), so it possible that we could have
recruited an unusually high proportion of “non-
responders.” However, the QRSd reductions achieved
by BVP (�17 ms; 95% CI: �27.3 to 7.1 ms) in this study
are greater than those seen in BVP studies (�6.6 �
27.8 ms), even when those studies excluded non-
responders (�11.9 � 25.1 ms) (6).
Although
noninvasive
ECGI
mapping
provides
high-resolution data of activation and allows segre-
gation of regional activation, there are potential
problems including assumptions of static geometry
and interpolation accuracy (31) (Online Appendix).
We
did
not
observe
successful
ventricular
resynchronization with HBP in all patients in this
study, which is consistent with the findings of other
studies (8). As this was an acute hemodynamic study
of temporary HBP, we did not employ active fixation,
which is used in permanent HBP. Active fixation may
result in lower thresholds because the screw of the
active lead acts as the cathode, and therefore, when it
penetrates the His bundle, it may allow direct stim-
ulation of the conduction fibers. However, some pa-
tients with QRS prolongation may not be amenable to
ventricular resynchronization with His pacing, for
example, patients where QRS prolongation occurs
due to myocyte uncoupling.
CONCLUSIONS
CRT delivered
using
HBP
appears
to
be
a
very
promising alternative to BVP in patients with LBBB
and heart failure. It can deliver larger reductions in
ventricular activation time, which leads to signifi-
cantly greater improvements in acute hemodynamic
function.
The
magnitude
of
these
improvements
suggest that His resynchronization therapy has the
potential to produce better clinical outcomes than
BVP.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE AND PROCEDURAL
SKILLS: In patients with heart failure and LBBB, His bundle
pacing is associated with more effective ventricular resynchro-
nization and greater improvement in systolic blood pressure than
cardiac resynchronization therapy with biventricular pacing.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Randomized trials comparing
His bundle pacing against biventricular pacing are needed to
guide selection of optimum device-based therapy for patients
with heart failure and LBBB.
