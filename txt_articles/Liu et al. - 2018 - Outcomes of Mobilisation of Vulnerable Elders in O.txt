 Methods: the early mobilisation implementation intervention for staff was multi-component and tailored to local context at
14 academic hospitals in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcome was patient mobilisation. Secondary outcomes included
length of stay (LOS), discharge destination, falls and functional status. The targeted patients were aged ≥ 65 years and
admitted between January 2012 and December 2013. The intervention was evaluated over three time periods—pre-inter-
vention, during and post-intervention using an interrupted time series design.
Results: in total, 12,490 patients (mean age 80.0 years [standard deviation 8.36]) were included in the overall analysis. An
increase in mobilisation was observed post-intervention, where significantly more patients were out of bed daily (intercept
difference = 10.56%, 95% CI: [4.94, 16.18]; P < 0.001) post-intervention compared to pre-intervention. Hospital median
LOS was significantly shorter during the intervention period (intercept difference = −3.45 days, 95% CI: [−6.67,−0.23],
P = 0.0356) compared to pre-intervention. It continued to decrease post-intervention with significantly fewer days in hospital
(intercept difference= −6.1, 95% CI: [−11,−1.2]; P = 0.015) in the post-intervention period compared to pre-intervention.
Conclusions: this is a large-scale study evaluating an implementation strategy for early mobilisation in older, general med-
ical inpatients. The positive outcome of this simple intervention on an important functional goal of getting more patients
out of bed is a striking success for improving care for hospitalised older patients.

Background
Older patients admitted to hospital are at increased risk for
hospital-acquired morbidity related to immobility [1]. Bed
rest is a contributor to iatrogenic complications including
delirium, decubitus ulcers, pneumonia, and muscle atrophy [2].
Each day spent immobile is associated with 1% to 5% loss of
muscle strength in an older person [3]. In a vulnerable senior,
this can quickly result in the loss of the ability to transfer and
ambulate independently.
Early mobilisation strategies targeting clinicians have
demonstrated benefits in patients with stroke, pneumonia,
and
hip
fracture
[4–7].
Early
mobilisation
protocols
decreased length of stay (LOS) and increased patient’s func-
tional status and likelihood of being discharged home [5, 8–10].
However, more recent studies of early mobilisation showed
mixed results, suggesting the need to tailor the strategy to the
individual’s condition [11–14]. Despite evidence documenting
mobilisation benefits, hospitalised older patients spend the
majority of their time in bed [15, 16]. In acute care hospitals,
general medical inpatient units have one of the oldest patient
populations [17]; older patients spend a median of 4% of the
day out of bed [15, 16]. No large-scale studies have evaluated
the implementation of early mobilisation in this setting. Our
aim was to implement and evaluate an evidence-based strat-
egy targeting staff to promote early mobilisation in older hos-
pitalised patients. We were interested in implementing it in a
‘real world’ setting, reflecting constraints in resources, aligning
with hospital initiatives, and facilitating sustainability.
Methods
We used a pragmatic, quasi-experimental interrupted time
series (ITS) design to evaluate the impact of the staff inter-
vention on the primary outcome, patient mobilisation, over
3 time periods—pre-intervention (10 weeks), during inter-
vention (8 weeks) and post-intervention (20 weeks). We
completed the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting
Excellence (SQUIRE) guidelines [18] and the Template for
Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist [19]
(see Supplementary data, Appendix 1, available at Age and Ageing
online). We used an integrated knowledge translation approach
whereby researchers and knowledge users worked together to
design and implement the process [20]. This study builds on a
pilot study conducted in four Toronto hospitals. Complete meth-
ods were described in a previous publication [21]. The protocol
was approved by the research ethics board at each hospital.
Study setting and participants
Patients were those aged 65 years and older admitted to
inpatient medicine units. Patients receiving palliative care or
on bed rest were excluded. The study was conducted
between January 2012 and December 2013 in 14 university-
affiliated hospitals in Ontario, Canada.
Study design
The intervention focused on implementing three messages:
(i) patients should be assessed for mobilisation status within
24 h of admission; (ii) mobilisation should occur at least
three times a day; (iii) mobility should be progressive and
scaled, tailored to the patient’s abilities. These messages were
chosen based on systematic reviews [4, 22] and feasibility.
At each hospital, the local implementation team included
a physician leader, education coordinator and research
coordinator. No funding was provided for the intervention
strategy or for the local implementation team; funding was
provided for the research coordinator.
The strategy used to implement the mobilisation messages
targeting staff was multi-component and tailored to local context.
All hospitals were required to provide interprofessional education
and educational tools; additional strategies were selected based
on appropriateness and context (e.g. reminders, local opinion lea-
ders, patient/caregiver education materials). Hospitals were

 provided resources (e.g. education modules, checklists, mobility
algorithms) to implement the intervention and invited to use or
adapt these, or develop new materials. Intervention details are
available in the protocol paper [21] and are freely accessible avail-
able through the MOVE Portal (http://movescanada.ca/user/
login). All hospitals received implementation coaching from the
central Mobilisation of Vulnerable Elders in Ontario (MOVE
ON) team, had access to an online community of practice, and
collaborated in monthly teleconferences. Coaches worked with
each local implementation team to select intervention strategies
mapped to identified barriers and facilitators, collected
through focus groups with interprofessional care staff and
using the theoretical domains framework (see Supplementary
data, Appendix 2, available at Age and Ageing online) [23] and
evidence on intervention effectiveness.
Measures
The primary outcome was mobilisation status of patients
assessed on twice-weekly visual audits (on random week-
days) that took place three times daily. Patients were con-
sidered mobilised if the visual audit identified the patient to
be out of bed. The focus was on early mobilisation, aligned
with evidence from studies that included out of bed mobil-
isation, recognising the critical need to focus on mobilisa-
tion and not just ambulation [4, 6, 12, 13]. Visual audits
were conducted by a research coordinator; this method was
evaluated using three independent auditors and had high
inter-rater agreement (kappa 0.83). We also tested it against
continuous rounding every 15 min for 6 h over 2 days
(positive likelihood ratio 12.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]:
[3.22, 46.46]) and negative likelihood ratio 0.06 (95% CI:
[0.02, 0.25])). Secondary outcomes were hospital LOS, rate
of injurious falls, discharge destination and functional sta-
tus. We collected data on eligible patients including age,
gender, place of residence prior to admission, and admitting
diagnosis from chart reviews and hospital decision support
data. Alongside, we conducted a process evaluation includ-
ing a log of intervention strategies (including adherence).
Statistical analysis
Daily mobility of patients, recorded from 3 audits/day, was
summarised as the proportion of patients mobilised (out of
bed) each day. This proportion was averaged over the two
audit days to provide an estimate of daily mobility for a
given week. This was done pre- (10 weeks, 20 assessment
points), during (8 weeks, 16 assessment points) and post-
intervention (20 weeks, 40 assessment points) for each hos-
pital. This proportion was averaged across all the hospitals
to provide an overall estimate of daily mobility. ITS analysis
using a segmented linear regression model was performed
to examine the impact of the intervention on mobility [24].
Presence of serial autocorrelation between mobility across
the different time points was assessed using the Durbin–
Watson’s statistic [25] and when statistically significant,
adjustment for autocorrelation was done [26]. Hospital-
level ITS analysis was performed to investigate the site-level
performance of the intervention and variation in mobility.
Results from the ITS analysis were presented in the form
of slope and intercept differences, as well as observed and
predicted differences across the time periods.
Median hospital LOS in a given week was considered
from all participating hospitals pre, during and post-
intervention. Discharge date was used to classify patients
into pre, during and post-intervention periods. The weekly
median LOS was then averaged overall hospitals to provide
an overall trend in LOS across time in an ITS framework.
ITS with segmented regression was performed to investi-
gate the intervention impact on LOS; results are presented
in the form of slope and intercept differences and observed
differences across the time periods. To detect a 10%
decrease for the patients being in bed after the intervention,
based on a power of 0.8 and type I error of 0.05, correl-
ation for AR(1) of 0.4 and proportion of patients being in
bed before the intervention at 66%, the total number of
required data collection (or assessment) points was 38. All
statistical analyses were performed using R statistical soft-
ware [27] and statistical significance was set at 0.05.
Results
Participants and units
Thirty-two units in 14 hospitals participated in MOVE ON
(one to five per hospital). About 14,540 patients (mean age
79.9 years [standard deviation [SD] 8.32]) contributed data;
53.3% were female. There was an average of 33 beds per
unit (range 14–72) among the mostly medical units (one
cardiovascular unit).
A total of 115,025 observations from 12,490 patients
(mean age 80.0 years [SD 8.36]) in 11 hospitals were combined
in the overall analysis; participant characteristics are in Table 1.
Three hospitals were excluded from the overall analysis (N =
2,050); one due to incomplete data, and two because the units
included complex continuing care patients who were not com-
parable to an acute care population. We conducted site-level
ITS analysis for these 3 hospitals (see Supplementary data,
Appendix 3, available at Age and Ageing online).
Primary outcome: patient mobilisation
Overall results
In the overall ITS analysis for the 11 hospitals, significantly
more patients were out of bed per day post-intervention
compared to pre-intervention (intercept difference = 10.56%,
95% CI: [4.94, 16.18]; P < 0.001; Figure 1). During the inter-
vention, more patients were out of bed per day compared to
pre-intervention but this was not statistically significant (inter-
cept difference = 3.12%, 95% CI: [−0.53, 6.76]). Post-
intervention, mobilisation continued to increase compared to
both the pre-intervention and intervention periods (see
Supplementary data, Appendix 4, available at Age and Ageing
online). During the post-intervention period, significantly

 more patients (intercept difference = 4.28%, 95% CI: [1.29,
7.27], P = 0.005) were mobilised compared to the interven-
tion period, indicating sustained intervention impact. At the
end of the study period (Week 38), the observed average daily
mobility was 47.03% compared to 41.97% at the end of the
pre-intervention period (Week 8).
During the intervention, the rate of change in daily
mobilisation increased by 0.40% per week compared to
pre-intervention; this was not statistically significant (slope
change = 0.40%, 95% CI: [−0.32, 1.11]). Post-intervention,
the rate of change in daily mobilisation continued to
increase at 0.31% per week but was not statistically

Supplementary data, Appendix 5, available at Age and Ageing
online provides the differences in observed and predicted
proportions of patients mobilised at the end of each period.
Hospital-specific results
The hospital-specific results are consistent with respect to
impact of the intervention on patient mobilisation; data
from the majority of the sites (10/11) showed the interven-
tion increased daily mobilisation of patients (see Supplementary
data, Appendices 6–8, available at Age and Ageing online). For
the 3 sites removed from the overall ITS analysis, an increase
in patient mobilisation was observed during intervention in all
three sites (see Supplementary data, Appendix 8, available at
Age and Ageing online).
Secondary outcomes
Length of stay
Overall results
In the post-intervention period, the median
LOS was significantly shorter (intercept difference = −6.1
days, 95% CI: [−11,−1.2]; P = 0.015) compared to the pre-
intervention period, and 2.03 days (95% CI: [−4.65,0.60],
P = 0.1299) shorter compared to the intervention period
(Figure 2). At the end of the pre-intervention period, median
LOS was observed to be 12.38 days. During the intervention
period, there was a significant decrease in median LOS (inter-
cept difference = −3.45 days, 95% CI: [−6.67, −0.23]; P =
0.0356) averaged across all sites. Median LOS increased dur-
ing the intervention but was not statistically significant (slope
change = −0.08, 95% CI: [−0.7, 0.55]) compared to pre-
intervention. The trend in median LOS (see Supplementary
data, Appendix 9, available at Age and Ageing online) showed
that the rate of decline in LOS in the post-intervention peri-
od was significantly different compared to the rate of change
during the pre-intervention period (slope difference = −0.75,
95% CI: [−1.13,−0.36], P < 0.001 = 0.0001).
Hospital-specific results
A high correlation between reduced
LOS and increase in mobilisation rates was observed across
sites, where 92.3% of the sites showed an increase in mobil-
isation during or post-intervention and a decrease in LOS
during these periods. In sites where there was no increase
in mobility due to the intervention, there was no decrease
in LOS (see Supplementary data, Appendices 10 and 11,
available at Age and Ageing online).
Other
Local decision support data on falls and functional status
was inadequate for full analysis but available data are pro-
vided in Supplementary data, Appendices 12–14, available
at Age and Ageing online. No statistically significant differ-
ences were found in discharge destination.
Data on which implementation strategies were delivered
at each site are available in Suppementary data, Appendix
15, at Age and Ageing online.
Discussion
This study represents the first large-scale study to evaluate
implementation of early mobilisation in older medical patients.
Delivering the intervention across multiple hospitals resulted
in 10% more patients out of bed at the end of the study and
a significant decrease in the median LOS. Patient mobilisation
rates improved both during and after implementation. Our

 results are important given that the intervention was imple-
mented without new resources aside from funding for a
research coordinator; this indicates buy-in and facilitates sus-
tainability. Several factors likely contributed to the interven-
tion’s success including the hospitals’ ability to adapt the
intervention to local context [28] by understanding local bar-
riers and facilitators [29] and mapping these to behaviour
change theory and intervention strategies [23].
Our results are aligned with studies that showed benefit
of mobilising patients with stroke, hip fracture and pneu-
monia [4–6] and those admitted to critical care [12]. Other
studies have found early mobilisation of patients with
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and
stroke led to worse outcomes [11]. Overall, these studies
highlight the importance of tailoring mobility to the
patient’s condition, ensuring that the patient is medically
stable before intensive rehabilitation [11, 12].
We observed a significant decrease in median LOS and
the findings were consistent across hospitals. Other external
factors may have affected LOS; however, in 10 of 14 sites a
decrease in LOS correlated with improvement in mobilisation
rates in intervention and post-intervention periods. In 3 of
the 4 remaining sites, increased mobilisation during the inter-
vention period resulted in a delayed effect on LOS, where a
decreased LOS was observed post-intervention. This is to be
expected since many patients admitted during the intervention
period would likely be discharged post-intervention.
Our study has several strengths. The primary outcome was
objective with high inter-rater reliability. Mobilisation was the
outcome, consistent with evidence from trials showing benefit
to patients being out of bed [4, 6, 12, 13]. Our sample included
14 hospitals and over 10,000 audited patients, making this the
largest study of an early mobilisation implementation strategy
to date. We assessed implementation activities and quality
through an intervention process template [23]. Finally, research
funding was used for evaluation and central implementation
coaching; hospitals provided in-kind resources to deliver the
implementation intervention, facilitating the sustainability and
scalability. We did not conduct an economic analysis, but all 14
hospitals delivered the intervention without any additional
resources. To date, 65 hospitals worldwide have implemented
MOVE ON.
There are limitations of our study. First, the method of
assessment (i.e. visual audits) was a surrogate for continu-
ous direct observation or use of electronic monitoring
devices; cost of these alternatives was prohibitive. With our
approach we may have underestimated mobilisation, how-
ever, this surrogate measure was feasible and reliable and is
used to assess hand hygiene compliance [30]. An alternative
would be a subjective measure of mobility (e.g. self-report)
however, these measures also have limitations such as
adherence. Second, we did not collect information about
external factors that may have impacted LOS. Third, none
of the hospitals routinely collected patient-level data on
mobility but with MOVE ON, some have initiated it.
Fourth, we were not able to provide analysis of patient out-
comes
such
as
functional
status
due
to
clinical
documentation limitations. Fifth, the rate of discharge to
long-term care facility was high. This may reflect hospital
coding issues related to multipurpose facilities with long-
term care, rehabilitation and independent living co-located.
Sixth, we were not able to analyse impact of mobilisation
on falls due to data quality issues, a recognised limitation of
fall reporting [31]. Nor did we examine for outcomes such
as delirium, decubitus ulcers, venous thrombosis, complica-
tions associated with immobility. Although these are clinic-
ally relevant outcomes, implementation studies targeting
behaviour change, typically use the behaviour change
(mobilisation) as the outcome when there is a direct associ-
ation between the behaviour change and the clinical
outcomes.
MOVE ON engaged multiple hospitals to implement a
contextualised intervention to promote early mobilisation
of hospitalised seniors. Following the intervention, hospital
units had significantly higher patient mobility rates.
Key points
• Evidence suggests that early mobilisation initiatives can
effectively improve patient outcomes in older adults.
• The MOVE ON program is a multi-component, interpro-
fessional early mobilisation initiative.
• MOVE ON improved patient mobility and decreased
LOS.
• MOVE ON can be tailored to various healthcare settings
and
builds
on
existing
infrastructure
to
facilitate
sustainability.

Abstract
Introduction: frailty is an increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, across multiple physiological systems, with
both environmental and genetic drivers. The two most commonly used measures are Rockwood’s frailty index (FI) and
Fried’s frailty phenotype (FP).
Material and methods: the present study included 3626 individuals from the TwinsUK Adult Twin Registry. We used the
classical twin model to determine whether FI and FP share the same latent aetiological factors. We also investigated the rela-
tionship between frailty and chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain (CWP), another holistic age-related condition with sig-
nificant clinical impact.
Results: FP and FI shared underlying genetic and environmental aetiology. CWP was associated with both frailty measures,
and health deficits appeared to mediate the relationship between phenotypic frailty and pain. Latent genetic factors underpinning
