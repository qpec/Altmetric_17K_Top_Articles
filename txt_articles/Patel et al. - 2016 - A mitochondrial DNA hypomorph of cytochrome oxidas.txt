Abstract Due to their strict maternal inheritance in most animals and plants, mitochondrial
genomes are predicted to accumulate mutations that are beneficial or neutral in females but
harmful in males. Although a few male-harming mtDNA mutations have been identified, consistent
with this ‘Mother’s Curse’, their effect on females has been largely unexplored. Here, we identify
COIIG177S, a mtDNA hypomorph of cytochrome oxidase II, which specifically impairs male fertility
due to defects in sperm development and function without impairing other male or female
functions. COIIG177S represents one of the clearest examples of a ‘male-harming’ mtDNA mutation
in animals and suggest that the hypomorphic mtDNA mutations like COIIG177S might specifically
impair male gametogenesis. Intriguingly, some D. melanogaster nuclear genetic backgrounds can
fully rescue COIIG177S -associated sterility, consistent with previously proposed models that nuclear
genomes can regulate the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutations.

Introduction
The acquisition of the mitochondria by the ancestral eukaryote is one of the most remarkable instan-
ces of symbiosis in biology (Sagan, 1967; Schwartz and Dayhoff, 1978). This symbiosis gave the
eukaryotic cell the ability to perform oxidative phosphorylation (Williams et al., 2013). In modern
eukaryotes, oxidative phosphorylation is carried out by the electron transport chain, which comprises
subunits encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA). Oxidative phosphorylation
plays a fundamental role in many eukaryotes and is responsible for meeting most cellular energy
demands. In humans, dysfunction of oxidative phosphorylation is associated with many diseases
including cancer, diabetes, infertility, and neurodegenerative disorders (Wallace, 2001).
Despite the appearance of a symbiotic relationship, the evolutionary interests of mitochondria
can be in conflict with those of nuclear genomes (Partridge and Hurst, 1998). This conflict arises
from the differences in transmission between the two genomes. Whereas the nuclear genome is
transmitted in a Mendelian fashion through both sexes, mtDNA is exclusively maternally inherited in
most metazoans. Indeed, there are elaborate mechanisms to prevent the inheritance of sperm mito-
chondria (Birky, 1995; Al Rawi et al., 2011; Sato and Sato, 2011; Zhou et al., 2011; DeLuca and

 O’Farrell, 2012). Due to this uniparental inheritance, natural selection for mtDNA fitness can oper-
ate in females but not in males. As a result of this relaxed selection, ’male-harming’ mtDNA muta-
tions are expected to accumulate as long as they are beneficial, neutral or nearly neutral in females,
a scenario referred to as the ‘Mother’s Curse’ (Frank and Hurst, 1996; Gemmell et al., 2004). How-
ever, since decreased male fitness is detrimental for the evolutionary success of the nuclear genome,
outbred populations subject to accumulation of male-harming mtDNA mutations can rapidly evolve
nuclear genome-encoded suppressors to restore male fitness (Rand et al., 2004; Dowling et al.,
2008). Thus, evolutionary theory predicts a conflict-driven molecular arms race between mtDNA and
the nuclear genome.
These evolutionary predictions have spurred interest into the molecular basis of how mtDNA
mutations can manifest as specifically ‘male-harming’ particularly since mitochondrial function would
be expected to be similar in most organs of both sexes. One of the best-understood examples of
such ‘male-harming’ mtDNA mutations are cytoplasmic male sterility (cms) mutants described in
many plant species (Budar et al., 2003; Chase, 2007). Such cms mtDNA can induce male sterility in
hermaphroditic plants that can be cross-pollinated. By reallocating resources for pollen production
instead for production of seeds, cms mtDNA increase female fitness – and consequently increase
their own fitness (Budar et al., 2003). Molecular characterization of cms mutants shows that their
‘male-harming’ (and female-beneficial) properties are caused by novel chimeric genes that are cre-
ated via recombination between mtDNA molecules. Nuclear-encoded suppressors of cms belong to
the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family and use RNA editing to effectively neutralize these
male-harming chimeric genes in mtDNA (Budar et al., 2003; Chase, 2007; Castandet and Araya,
2012).
eLife digest Cell compartments called mitochondria are responsible for producing much of the
energy that animal and plant cells need. Most of the proteins in mitochondria are produced from
genes found in another compartment called the nucleus. However, some mitochondrial proteins are
made from genes found in the mitochondria themselves.
Unlike the genes in the nucleus, which animals and plants inherit from both their mother and
father, the mitochondrial “genome” is only passed on along the female line. Therefore, males
represent an evolutionary dead-end for mitochondrial genes. Evolutionary theory predicts that this
should result in the evolution and spread of mutations that can be harmful to males, providing they
do not reduce the ability of females to survive and reproduce. Although such ‘male-harming’
mutations have been well studied in plants, it is less clear how common they are in animals.
Patel, Miriyala, Littleton et al. used fruit flies as a model system to identify and characterize male-
harming mutations in the mitochondrial genome. The experiments isolated a mitochondrial genome
with a single mutation in a gene that encodes an enzyme called cytochrome oxidase II. The mutation
is said to be “hypomorphic” because it lowers the activity of the gene. The fertility of male flies with
this mutation rapidly declined as they aged. However, the mutation did not appear to lower the
fertility of female flies. In fact, apart from the lower male fertility, the mitochondrial mutation did not
seem to affect any other traits in males or females.
Further
experiments
revealed
that
this
hypomorphic
mutation

impairs
the
development of sperm. Patel, Miriyala, Littleton et al. also found that the effect of the mutation on
the fertility of the males depended on the genes in the nucleus of their cells, as some nuclear
genomes were able to partially or completely suppress the mutation. This supports previous findings
that the effect of mitochondrial mutations in animals and plants may be complex and can be
strongly influenced by the genes in their nucleus.
Patel, Miriyala, Littleton et al.’s findings suggest that sperm development is particularly
susceptible to defects in mitochondria, and that hypomorphic mutations may represent a broader
category of ‘male-harming’ mutations in animals. A future challenge will be to find out whether such
mutations occur in humans and whether they are associated with infertility in men.

 Animal mtDNA genomes are relatively small compared to those in plants, and the presence of
novel chimeric genes is extremely rare in animal mtDNA. Despite these limitations, there is evidence
that mutations in animal mtDNA genes might be male-harming. For example, mtDNA haplogroup T
in humans is associated with reduced sperm motility (Ruiz-Pesini et al., 2000). Polymorphisms in
mtDNA that cause this phenotype are hypothesized to be significant contributors to untreatable
male subfertility, known to affect 7–10% of men (Baker, 1994). Recent findings implicate mtDNA
variation as a significant contributor to shorter male lifespans in many taxa (Clancy, 2008;
Camus et al., 2012). Although the phenotypic consequences of these mtDNA mutations are severe
in males, it remains unclear whether they are benign in females, i.e., whether they are specifically
‘male-harming’ mtDNA mutations as predicted by the Mother’s Curse hypothesis.
Indeed, in spite of the theoretical predictions, male-harming mtDNA mutations have proven diffi-
cult to detect in animals. Several factors account for this difficulty. First, in natural populations, there
can be significant indirect selection on mtDNA to maintain male fitness when the fitness of females
is dependent on related males (those with the same mtDNA) (Wade and Brandvain, 2009;
Hedrick, 2012). Such indirect selection against male-harming mtDNA mutations may be especially
stringent in populations with high rates of inbreeding (Wade and Brandvain, 2009; Hedrick, 2012).
Such indirect selection for male fitness might keep male-harming mtDNA mutations at low frequen-
cies in natural populations, making them difficult to detect without deep surveys of natural
polymorphism.
A second factor that may impede the discovery of male-harming mtDNA mutations in natural
populations is their suppression by nuclear genome-encoded loci, which are under stringent selec-
tive pressure to restore male fitness (Rand et al., 2004; Dowling et al., 2008). Effects of detrimental
mtDNA variants could thus only be evident if they were separated from their nuclear-encoded sup-
pressors. With this goal, many researchers have created combinations of nuclear and mtDNA
genomes in D. melanogaster, either from different strains or species (Rand et al., 2001;
Maklakov et al., 2006; Rand et al., 2006, Dowling et al., 2007,
2008; Montooth et al., 2010;
Clancy et al., 2011; Correa et al., 2012). Such combinations have revealed instances of dramatic
incompatibility, even within species, which results in male but not female lifespan defects
(Camus et al., 2012). Variation in mtDNA also affects sperm competitiveness in D. melanogaster
(Yee et al., 2013). While these elegant experiments have revealed mtDNA-dependent affects on
male lifespan and fertility, they did not comprehensively assess affects on female life-history traits; it
is thus unclear whether these mutations are specifically male-harming. One further limitation of such
mtDNA ‘swaps’ is that introduced mtDNA often have several co-inherited mutations. This linkage of
different mutations makes it nearly impossible to implicate single mutations as being causal for the
incompatibility or to understand their biological mechanism. An exception is a single point mutation
in D. melanogaster mtDNA that has been causally linked to male sterility (Clancy et al., 2011). How-
ever, recent demonstration of this mtDNA haplotype’s negative pleiotropic effects on fertility and
aging, both within and between sexes suggests it is not a specifically male-harming mutation
(Camus et al., 2015). Thus, we currently lack clear examples of specifically male-harming mtDNA
mutations in animals. This has also left unanswered the larger question of molecular mechanisms by
which mtDNA mutations can manifest their ‘male-harming’ phenotypes.
Here, we isolated a mtDNA variant that harbors a single non-synonymous change in subunit II of
cytochrome c oxidase (COIIG177S). We find that COIIG177S males have an age– and temperature–
dependent decrease in fertility. This decrease in fertility is correlated with a drop in COII enzymatic
activity, which remarkably does not result in defects in any other male or female phenotypic traits we
measured. Cellular characterization reveals decreased sperm production and function in the mutant
males. By combining evolutionary principles with detailed functional characterization, our study thus
provides one of the clearest examples of a male-harming mtDNA mutation in animals, and provides
insights into the stringent requirements for optimal mtDNA function in sperm development. We fur-
ther show that the fertility defect in COIIG177S males can be completely suppressed by diverse
nuclear backgrounds derived from various D. melanogaster strains, as predicted by the theory of
cyto-nuclear genetic conflict.

Recovery of a male-harming mtDNA mutation
To isolate male-harming mtDNA mutations, we devised an experimental evolution strategy that was
partly inspired by previous strategies to decouple male versus female evolution in D. melanogaster
(Rice, 1996; Rice, 1998). In our strategy, D. melanogaster females are prevented from mating with
their male siblings. Instead, virgin females are mated to naı
¨ve males from an external stock every
generation (Figure 1A). This strategy is predicted to eliminate indirect selection against male-harm-
ing mtDNA mutations because the fitness of the population is not dependent on the males carrying
the mtDNA mutations; mtDNA are effectively absolved from supporting male fitness (Wade and
Brandvain, 2009). Moreover, continuous replacement of a large fraction of the nuclear genome
every generation via crosses to external males practically eliminates the likelihood of evolution of
nuclear suppressors during the course of the experiment. In contrast, selection of mtDNA function

 for female fitness is stringently maintained over the entire course of the experiment. Thus, we antici-
pated this experimental evolution strategy might provide a permissive environment for accumulation
and phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutations that are beneficial, neutral, or nearly neutral
(only slightly deleterious) in females but cause defects in males.
From an ‘original stock’ of w1118 flies, we established 18 independent lines, each consisting of
300 females and 100 males. In 12 of these lines (experimental lines), virgin females were collected
every generation and mated with males from the original stock (Figure 1A). Female flies were sub-
jected to this mating scheme continuously for 35 generations over approximately 70 weeks. For the
remaining 6 lines (coevolving lines), we allowed sibling males to mate with the females over the
course of 35 generations (Figure 1B). Based on published mtDNA mutation rate of 6.2 � 10�8 per
site per fly generation (Haag-Liautard et al., 2008), we anticipated that multiple mutations per
mtDNA would be sampled in 35 generations across the 18 lines. Any mtDNA mutations fixed at the
end of the experiment must have either been pre-existing heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations that
went to fixation (although the rate of fixation of such heteroplasmic mutations would be slow
[Solignac et al., 1987]) or arose de novo in the experimental lines.
After 35 generations, we subjected flies to phenotypic analyses to assess whether any male-harm-
ing mutations had been sampled in the course of our experimental evolution strategy. To assess
male viability, we first measured sex ratio in crosses between females with mtDNA subjected to
experimental evolution (either ‘experimental’ or ‘coevolving’ lines) and control males (original w1118
stock maintained as a separate population). We did not observe a change in male to female ratio in
any of the 18 lines, suggesting that any mutations in mtDNA acquired over the 35 generations did
not alter male viability (Figure 2A). Next, we measured male fertility by mating males derived from
the starting, experimental, and coevolving lines with females from the original stock. For 17 of 18
lines, we did not detect any significant differences in male fertility. However, we found that males
from experimental line 7 (hereafter referred to as ‘EL7’) sired significantly fewer progeny compared
to males from all the other experimental, coevolved and original lines (Figure 2B). In contrast, EL7
females do not have any significant decline in fertility (Figure 2C). This suggested the possibility of a
male-harming mtDNA mutation in the EL7 line that was not deleterious to female fertility. We inves-
tigated whether the decline in male fertility we observed manifested over the entire adulthood of
EL7 male flies. We found no obvious reduction in male fertility over the first few days of adulthood
(note that F1 progeny do not emerge until day 12) in EL7 compared to the other experimental or
control lines. Instead, we observed that the reduction in male fertility was age-dependent
(Figure 2D). Our findings are consistent with previous observations in which mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion is more severe in aged individuals (Camus et al., 2012; Tower, 2015).
A single missense mtDNA mutation results in male fertility decline
To identify the putative mutation responsible for decreased male fertility, we performed whole-
genome sequencing of the original and EL7 D. melanogaster lines using DNA isolated from a pool
of 100 flies for each line. We were able to achieve average coverage of over 1000-fold for the entire
mtDNA, except for the highly repetitive, AT-rich ‘control’ region (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).
Analysis of these mtDNA sequences revealed a single missense mutation in EL7 mtDNA, resulting in
a glycine to serine substitution at position 177 in subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase (COIIG177S), the
fourth complex in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Figure 3A–B). Interestingly, the
COIIG177S mutation did not arise de novo during the course of our experiment. Although 98% of the
sequencing reads from EL7 harbored the COIIG177S mutation, 59% of the reads from the original
stock also corresponded to the mutant allele. Sanger sequencing confirmed this difference in pro-
portion of wildtype and mutant mtDNA (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).
A mixture of wildtype and mutant mtDNA can exist in the same population in two ways. First, a
population can consist of homoplasmic (carrying genetically identical mtDNA) wildtype and mutant
individuals. Alternatively, the two mtDNA can be present in the same individual in a state of hetero-
plasmy. Sanger sequencing of single individuals from our original line revealed the presence of het-
eroplasmic individuals as well as flies that were homoplasmic wildtype and mutant (Figure 3—figure
supplement 3). Therefore, 59% reflects the average combined frequency of the COIIG177S mutation
from both heteroplasmic and homoplasmic mutant flies in the population.
The mutant allele’s 59% frequency among reads from the original stock suggested that the
COIIG177S mutation was present before initiation of the experimental lines. If this model is correct,

 we would expect that the COIIG177S mutation should also be found in some of the other control and
experimental lines in addition to EL7. Indeed, we found this to be the case (Figure 3—figure sup-
plement 2). However, EL7 is unique in being the only population in which the COIIG177S mutation is
nearly fixed, whereas it varies from 0% to more than 50% in other experimental populations, which
do not suffer any overt signs of male sterility at least at a population-level (Figure 2B, Figure 3—fig-
ure supplement 2). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that COIIG177S mutation causes
defects in male fertility but only when present at very high levels. Our findings are consistent with
similar observations in pathogenic mtDNA variants in human disease (Sobenin et al., 2014).
Our finding that EL7 nearly fixed a mtDNA mutation that was already pre-existing provided
another opportunity to test the association of the COIIG177S mutation with decrease in male fertility.
We reasoned that homoplasmic mutant males re-isolated from the original stock should also have
reduced fertility despite the fact that these males have not undergone 35 generations of

Figure 2. A single experimental line with male-specific fertility defects. (A) We measured average sex ratio of progeny by mating five females from each
of the original, experimental, or coevolving lines, with three males from the original stock. Average sex ratio was found to be close to 50:50 in each of
the lines, suggesting that there were no gross viability differences between male and female progeny in any of the lines. All error bars represent
standard error of the mean. All experiments were done in replicates of 10 per group. (B) We measured male fertility by mating three males from each of
the original stock, experimental, or coevolving lines with five females from the original stock, and calculating average number of resulting progeny.
Male fertility is represented as a normalized percentage of progeny relative to the original stock. Only one line, experimental line 7 (EL7) showed
significant reduction relative to the others. All error bars represent standard error of the mean. All experiments were done in replicates of 10 per group.
(C) We measured female fertility by mating five females from each of the original, experimental, or coevolving lines with three males from the original
stock, and calculating average number of resulting progeny. Like in (B), female fertility is represented as a normalized percentage of progeny relative to
the original stock. EL7 female fertility is not significantly different from the original stock. All error bars represent standard error of the mean. All
experiments were done in replicates of 10 per group. (D) To gain further insight into altered male fertility in EL7 (B), we plotted the cumulative number
of progeny sired by (three) males as a function of time since initial mating (10 replicates per line). We find that the cumulative number of progeny sired
by EL7 males is normal until day 18 but is subsequently significantly lower than for all other lines. This finding suggests an age-dependent decline in
male fertility in the EL7 line.

 experimental evolution like EL7. Consistent with this expectation, we were able to re-isolate homo-
plasmic COIIG177S males, which sire fewer progeny compared to homoplasmic wildtype males
derived from the same original stock (Figure 4A) (mutant and wildtype lines re-established from sin-
gle females). These data demonstrate that the homoplasmic COIIG177S mutation is necessary and suf-
ficient to explain the observed decreased male fertility in EL7 males. These re-isolated COIIG177S
homoplasmic mutant mtDNA males also recapitulated the age-dependent decline in male fertility
(Figures 2D,4B).
We characterized the nature of the heteroplasmy in the re- isolated COIIG177S mutant mtDNA

Figure 4. Males with COIIG177S mutation have decreased fertility at elevated temperatures. (A) To measure male fertility, we compared the fertility of
males homoplasmic for either wildtype or COIIG177S mutant mtDNA reestablished from the original stock. For each experiment, three males from
homoplasmic stocks were mated with five females homoplasmic for wildtype mtDNA. Male fertility is presented as a normalized percentage of progeny
produced, relative to the number produced by wildtype mtDNA males. COIIG177S mutant mtDNA males produce fewer progeny at 25˚C, but this is

 mtDNA adult fly heads using a Duplex Sequencing strategy (Kennedy et al., 2014) followed by
hybrid capture to significantly enrich for mtDNA (Figure 4—source data 1). Under this strategy,
mtDNA is sequenced at very high depth of coverage, labeling individual DNA molecules and
sequencing each one multiple times in order to distinguish true mutations from sequencing errors.
This strategy allows for sensitive evaluation of heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations. We found no evi-
dence for wildtype mtDNA sequence in a pool of flies that we had re-isolated to enrich for the
COIIG177S mutant mtDNA (0 duplex consensus reads out of >7000). In contrast, we found no evi-
dence for the COIIG177S mutant mtDNA in flies (0 reads out of >7000) that we had re-isolated from
the same original w1118 stock to enrich for wildtype mtDNA. We were cognizant that although the
pooled COIIG177S mutant flies showed no evidence of wild-type sequence, some heteroplasmy may
nevertheless persist in individual flies. We therefore also sequenced 7 individual flies from the
COIIG177S mutant mtDNA pool to high depth of coverage. For six flies, we found no reads (out of
>8,000) corresponding to wildtype mtDNA, whereas in one fly we uncovered seven out of >11,000
reads corresponding to wildtype mtDNA (<0.1%). We therefore conclude that the re-isolated strains
are almost completely homoplasmic for either COIIG177S mutant mtDNA or wildtype mtDNA. We
therefore used these re-isolated strains for all subsequent phenotypic analyses.
Although we had set out to recover de novo mtDNA mutations that are male-harming using our
experimental evolution strategy, we instead recovered what appears to be a pre-existing heteroplas-
mic mtDNA mutant, which fixed in only one of the 12 experimental lines. Therefore, we cannot attri-
bute the isolation of this mutant to our scheme. Future work will be needed to determine the
effectiveness of our experiment evolution scheme in recovering male-harming mutations, perhaps
aided by experimentally increasing mtDNA mutation rates. For the rest of the manuscript, we focus
on detailed characterization of the COIIG177S mutation to determine its cellular consequences and to
determine whether it is specifically male-harming.
Decreased male fertility in COIIG177S mutants is temperature
dependent
All our analyses so far suggest that COIIG177S is a specifically male-harming mtDNA mutation. Hence,
we decided to further characterize the cellular and molecular basis underlying its detrimental effects.
Previous experiments have shown that the phenotypic effects of mtDNA mutation can be exacer-
bated with increased stress, including higher temperatures (Hoekstra et al., 2013; Chen et al.,
2015). We therefore investigated the effect of higher temperature on the fertility defect in COIIG177S
males. We found that COIIG177S males are almost completely sterile when raised at 29˚C instead of
at 25˚C (Figure 4A). Furthermore, we found that this defect manifests in both old and young males
(Figure 4C). Thus, higher temperature provides a more sensitized condition to evaluate the various
consequences of the COIIG177S mtDNA mutation as previously observed (Hoekstra et al., 2013).
COIIG177S mutants have impaired cytochrome c oxidase activity
Next, we investigated the molecular consequences of the COIIG177S mutation. COII is a subunit of
cytochrome C oxidase (COX), which oxidizes the reduced form of cytochrome c. The glycine residue
at position 177 is found in a loop of COII’s structure where it comes in very close proximity to sub-
unit I of the enzymatic complex (Figure 3B). Based on the fact that G177 is highly conserved across
metazoans (Figure 3C), we hypothesized that the G177S mutation affects either an intrinsic function
of COII or its interaction with other proteins in complex IV of the electron transport chain. To under-
stand the biochemical consequences of the COIIG177S mutation, we measured COX activity from
whole fly lysates of flies grown at 25˚C. Although the COX activity in COIIG177S mutant flies was
slightly lower than flies with wild-type mtDNA, this defect was not statistically significant, even in old
flies (Figure 5A). We therefore measured COX activity from flies raised at 29˚C where male fertility
is most significantly impaired. Our analyses revealed an approximately 20% decrease in COX enzy-
matic activity in COIIG177S mutants grown at 29˚C in both male and female flies (Figure 5B). Given

 that the activity of the electron transport chain is coupled to ATP synthesis, we also measured ATP
levels at 29˚C. In contrast to COX activity, we did not observe a decrease in ATP levels in the
COIIG177S mutants (Figure 5C). However, we did observe a mild but significant decrease in reactive
oxygen species (ROS) levels (Figure 5D). Thus, impaired COX activity and reduced ROS levels, but
not ATP production, appear to correlate with loss of male fertility.

 The COIIG177S mtDNA mutant specifically impairs male fertility
Our finding that COIIG177S mutants result in lower COX activity of both males and females prompted
us to evaluate several other phenotypes commonly seen in flies with mitochondrial impairment.
Mitochondrial dysfunction is often associated with aging defects in many species (Cho et al., 2011;
Tower, 2015). Naturally occurring variation in mtDNA is also known to affect aging in D. mela-
nogaster (Rand et al., 2006; Clancy, 2008; Camus et al., 2012). We therefore assayed the lifespan
of wildtype and COIIG177S mutant males and females at both 25˚C and 29˚C. We did not observe
any differences in lifespan, even at the sensitized higher temperature between wildtype and mutant
flies in either males or females (Figure 6).
Sensitivity to physiological stress and neuronal function are also associated with mitochondrial
dysfunction (Fergestad et al., 2006; Pieczenik and Neustadt, 2007; Ugalde et al., 2007;
Distelmaier et al., 2009; Celotto et al., 2011). We therefore assayed heat intolerance, and ‘bang
sensitivity’, a measure of neuronal dysfunction (Burman et al., 2014). There were no statistically sig-
nificant differences in these traits in either males or females, even in aged flies grown at 29˚C, the
highly sensitized and susceptible condition (Figure 6—figure supplements 1, 2). Thus, despite the
20% reduction in COX activity in both males and females, the phenotypic consequences of COIIG177S
in D. melanogaster appear to be largely benign, with deleterious effects confined to male fertility
alone.
COIIG177S impairs sperm development and motility
We next investigated the biological basis of the decreased male fertility in COIIG177S mtDNA-bearing
males. Male sterility could either result from defects in the ability of males to mate or can be a result
of defective sperm development/function or a combination of both. In order to distinguish between
these two possibilities, we took advantage of the fact that transfer of male accessory gland peptides
during mating induces egg-laying in females (Wolfner, 1997). We find that mating wildtype females
with COIIG177S males induces egg-laying just as robustly as in females mated with males carrying
wildtype mtDNA (Figure 7A). However, almost all of the eggs laid by females mated with COIIG177S
mutant males were unfertilized and failed to hatch (Figure 7A). Taken together, these data suggest
that the decreased fertility in COIIG177S males occurs due to defects in sperm development or func-
tion, and not due to mating ability. We therefore sought to determine the nature of cellular defects
in COIIG177S male testes.
Sperm development occurs within a cyst in which 64 sperm nuclei share a common cytoplasm.
These sperm undergo individualization during the needle stage near the terminal epithelium of the
testis. Examination of testes stained with the DNA marker DAPI revealed clear late needle-stage
defects in COIIG177S males. These mutant sperm failed to individualize properly and instead formed
tangled clumps (Figure 7B–C). Consistent with this developmental defect, there is a significant
reduction in the number of mature sperm that are stored in the seminal vesicles of COIIG177S males
raised at 29˚C, as indicated by the decrease in the size of the seminal vesicles (Figure 7D–F). In addi-
tion, sperm that could be isolated from COIIG177S males have reduced motility (Videos 1,2).
Although we used the higher temperature to provide a more sensitized assay to measure male
fertility, we were aware of the possibility that the decreased fertility and the reduced seminal vesicle
size could be solely the result of the elevated temperature (29˚C). We therefore carried out similar
experiments in aged males at 25˚C, which also had displayed a reduction in fertility. Just like young
COIIG177S males at 29˚C, we found that aged COIIG177S males at 25˚C also had reduced seminal vesi-
cle size compared to aged males with wildtype mtDNA (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). In con-
trast, the seminal vesicle sizes of young males with wildtype mtDNA were the same, whether they
were raised at 25˚C or 29˚C.Together, our results suggest that the decreased male fertility and
reduced seminal vesicle size is not due to a confounding effect of higher temperature, but rather the
result of the COIIG177S mtDNA mutation.
Examining the male infertility phenotype further, we found that mitotracker green, a mitochon-
drial membrane potential-independent dye, preferentially stains immotile sperm whereas mito-
tracker CMXRos, a mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent dye, preferentially stains motile
sperm in wild type testes. Sperm from COIIG177S mutant males showed similar mitotracker green
staining but significantly reduced CMXRos staining overall compared with wildtype sperm (Figure 8),
suggesting that the lack of motility likely results from dysfunctional mitochondrial activity. Taken

 together, these data demonstrate that decreased COX activity in COIIG177S males correlates with
the cellular defects in sperm development and motility in COIIG177S mutants.

mutation affected the mating success of males. We measured eggs laid by virgin wildtype females that were either unmated, or mated with 2–5 day old
wildtype, or COIIG177S mutant males at 29˚C. We determined the fraction of eggs hatched by counting unhatched eggs and larva 24 hrs after eggs
were laid. All experiments were done in replicates of 6 per group. Error bars represent standard error of the mean. Our results show that the number of
eggs laid after mating to wildtype mtDNA males is not significantly different from those mated to COIIG177S mutant mtDNA males; in the latter case,
most of the eggs are unfertilized and do not hatch. (B,C) We present maximum projection representative images of DAPI stained testis from 2–5 day
old wildtype mtDNA male flies grown at 29˚C at early (B), middle (B’), and late (B’’) needle stage of sperm development. Note that the sperm are

projection images of DAPI stained testis from COIIG177S mutant mtDNA male flies grown at 29˚C at early (C), middle (C’), and late (C’’) needle stage of

 Nuclear genome variation can suppress the male-harming effects of
COIIG177S mtDNA
Male-harming mtDNA mutations like COIIG177S are predicted to be detrimental for the evolutionary
success of the nuclear genome. In the face of such mtDNA mutations, it is expected that nuclear
genomes might have evolved suppressors to restore male fitness (Rand et al., 2004; Dowling et al.,
2008; Wolff et al., 2014). To test this evolutionary hypothesis, we generated males heterozygous
for varied nuclear genomes by crossing COIIG177S mtDNA-bearing females with males from a num-
ber of D. melanogaster strains, collected from different global populations. We then assayed the fer-
tility of the resulting male progeny that carried the COIIG177S mtDNA but were heterozygous for the
nuclear genome. To maximize the sensitivity of our assays, we performed these fertility assays in
young males at 29˚C. Surprisingly, we found that the nuclear genomes from many of the strains we
tested were able to completely restore male fertility in COIIG177S males (Figure 9A, Figure 9—fig-
ure supplement 1).
Male fertility is highly sensitive to temperature, with different strains exhibiting different threshold
of tolerance (Rohmer et al., 2004; David et al., 2005; Hoekstra et al., 2013). Hence, the restora-
tion of fertility that we observe could simply reflect greater tolerance to high temperature indepen-
dent of the COIIG177S mtDNA. To address this possibility, we measured total fertility of males until
21 days of age at 25˚C. We found that the Oregon R nuclear background suppresses not only the
young male sterility at 29˚C but also male fertility at 25˚C (Figure 9B, Figure 9—figure supplement
1). Thus, we conclude that the Oregon R nuclear background encodes a bona fide suppressor of
COIIG177S mtDNA-mediated male infertility. We currently don’t know the identity of the suppressor
loci or whether these are specific only to the COIIG177S mtDNA mutation. For instance, these sup-
pressors might employ a general mechanism that allows for rescue of male fitness defects caused by
other mtDNA mutations. Under either scenario,
we hypothesized that COIIG177S suppressor loci
may be more abundant across D. melanogaster
strains.
We used lines from the DGRP collection
(Mackay et al., 2012), a set of fully sequenced
inbred lines derived from a single natural popu-
lation, to ask whether there is a lot of standing
variation in the ability of nuclear genomes to
suppress effects of the COIIG177S mutation. We

penetrance of the rescue also suggests that the
suppression of COIIG177S associated male infer-
tility is likely to involve multiple loci.

 We examined in more detail the cellular basis
of ‘rescued’ male fertility in OregonR-w1118 het-
erozygous males bearing the COIIG177S mtDNA.
We found that sperm development and motility
were partially rescued in young males raised at
29˚C (Figure 10A–E, Figure 10—figure supple-
ment 1, Video 3) and aged males at 25˚C (Fig-
ure 7 —figure supplement 1), consistent with
the restoration of fertility that we previously
observed (Figure 9A,B). We also evaluated the
biochemical consequence of such nuclear sup-
pression of COIIG177S mtDNA’s male sterility to
distinguish between two possible mechanisms of
suppression. Under the first alternative, restora-
tion of fertility in COIIG177S males might be due
to higher baseline COX activity in the suppressor
background, which can compensate for the hypo-
morphic COIIG177S and therefore be sufficient for
sperm development and motility. Under this sce-
nario, there would still be a difference in COX
activity between wildtype and COIIG177S flies. A
second alternative is that there is no difference in
COX
activity
in
flies
carrying
wildtype
or
COIIG177S mtDNA. When we measured COX
activity in the suppressed nuclear background, we found the second scenario to be true i.e., COX
activity is the same in wildtype and COIIG177S mtDNA-bearing males (Figure 10F). This result was
also observed for three additional suppressor lines we tested (Figure 10—figure supplement 2).
These data suggest that in the suppressed background, COIIG177S mtDNA is as functionally effective
as wildtype mtDNA and is indicative of a compensatory mechanism that does not rely simply on
higher baseline levels of COX activity.
Discussion
Evolution by natural selection rests on a simple but fundamental premise that the phenotypic mani-
festation of a genotype occurs in the same individual that transmits it to the next generation.
Remarkably, the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) does not abide by this rule since it is inherited and
phenotypically manifests in both sexes, but is exclusively transmitted through females in most ani-
mals and plants. Thus, the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA is decoupled from its transmission in
males. Consequently, natural selection is ineffective at directly removing mtDNA mutations that are
specifically harmful to males but not females. While the mtDNA phenotype/transmission decoupling
clearly predicts existence of male-harming mutations (Mother’s Curse) (Frank and Hurst, 1996;
Gemmell et al., 2004), a systematic study of such mutations and their underlying mechanisms is
hampered by the relative paucity of such mutations in animals.
We devised an experimental evolution scheme intended to absolve mtDNA of supporting male
function while both maintaining selection on female mtDNA function as well as reducing the possibil-
ity of nuclear suppression of male-harming mtDNA. While we did recover a bona fide male-harming
COIIG177S mtDNA mutation via this scheme, we were subsequently surprised to discover that this
was a pre-existing mtDNA mutation that was already present at moderate frequencies in our starting
laboratory strain of w1118. It is possible that the experimental evolution scheme might have created
the permissive conditions that allowed this mtDNA mutation to rise to fixation in one strain. How-
ever, the fact that it did not rise to fixation in the other experimental populations means that we can-
not conclude that the experimental strategy itself was causally important for the fixation of this
male-harming mtDNA mutant. Future work on fine-tuning the strategy can address its effectiveness.
For example, the scheme can be improved by increasing mtDNA mutation rates to improve sam-
pling of de novo mutations, perhaps by employing a mutator mtDNA polymerase before initiating
the experimental evolution scheme (Trifunovic et al., 2004). Alternatively, random chemical

 mutagenesis might also be readily applied here in our scheme. Although such chemical mutagenesis
will affect both mtDNA and nuclear genomes initially, backcrossing to ‘original stock’ males in our
scheme will rapidly replace most mutated nuclear genes with wildtype versions, while enabling the
transmission of mtDNA mutations that do not affect female fitness. Finally, combining the crossing
scheme we propose with the targeted restriction endonuclease strategy to generate mtDNA muta-
tions (Xu et al., 2008) might be a facile means to discriminate specifically ‘male-harming’ mtDNA
mutations from those that grossly impair mtDNA function.
Our phenotypic assays did not provide any evidence for the COIIG177S mutation being beneficial
in females. Furthermore, the mutation rose to high frequency in only one out of the twelve experi-
mental lines, suggesting that the mutation is likely neutral or nearly neutral in females and therefore
became nearly fixed through drift rather than selection. These data are consistent with the ‘selective
sieve’ model, which predicts that even mutations that are neutral or nearly neutral in females but del-
eterious in males might be common because they cannot be effectively removed by natural selection
(Innocenti et al., 2011). Our survey of the sequenced genomes from a large panel of 290 D. mela-
nogaster strains and isofemale lines did not reveal any other lines besides our w1118 stock that har-
bored COIIG177S (Richardson et al., 2012). Thus, COIIG177S might be rare in natural populations.
The homoplasmic COIIG177S mutation results in a 20% decline in COX activity at 29˚C. Remark-
ably, we observed no phenotypic effects of this decline in COX activity on other phenotypic traits in
both males and females, even at high temperatures. The COX activity decline specifically impaired
sperm production and function. This establishes COIIG177S as one of the first bona fide male-harming

Figure 9. Dominant suppression of COIIG177S associated male fertility defects by diverse nuclear genome backgrounds. (A) We measured male fertility
of heterozygous males derived from crosses of w1118 females (carrying wildtype or COIIG177S mutant mtDNA) to males from a variety of different
nuclear backgrounds (i.e., Oregon R, Arizona, Congo isoline 18, Congo isoline 26). In each case, three heterozygous males were mated with 5 w1118
females at 29˚C (10 replicates per group). Male fertility was measured as average number of resulting progeny, normalized as a percentage of progeny

 mtDNA mutations in animals. We considered the possibility that the phenotypic effects we have
observed on male fertility are attributable to linked but unassayed changes in the 4-kb long AT-rich
D loop control region of mtDNA. Indeed, the D-loop is one of the most rapidly evolving segments
of mtDNA in D. melanogaster, but its highly repetitive nature challenges sequence characterization.
However, our analyses allow us to directly implicate the COIIG177S mtDNA mutation as being causally
linked to the phenotypes we have observed. Not only do we observe a perfect correlation of the
male fertility phenotype with the reduction of COX activity, but we also observe a near complete
restoration of male fertility upon replenishment of COX activity in the suppressor strains.
Surprisingly, the decline in COX activity in COIIG177S flies was not associated with a corresponding
decline in ATP production. Since we were unable to reliably measure either COX activity or ATP pro-
duction in testes, we cannot rule out the possibility that ATP production is specifically impaired in
the male germline. However, our findings suggest a different molecular consequence of lowered
COX activity may be responsible for defects in sperm development; we did observe decreased reac-
tive oxygen species (ROS) production in COIIG177S mutants. Our findings suggest that perhaps alter-
ations in ROS levels might underlie the defects we see in sperm production and function. ROS have
been shown previously to act as a signaling molecule to control the cell cycle checkpoint as well as
the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors during development in D. melanogaster (Owusu-
Ansah et al., 2008; Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009). These data leave open the possibility of
ROS similarly acting as a signaling factor during sperm development.
We hypothesize that male fertility may be a common target of male-harming mtDNA mutations
because the reproductive tissues are highly sexually dimorphic. This hypothesis is consistent with
previous data, which showed that naturally occurring variation in D. melanogaster mtDNA largely
affects expression of male-expressed genes in the testis and the accessory gland (Innocenti et al.,
2011). Two separate mutations in mtDNA are known to cause male sterility in D. melanogaster
(Xu et al., 2008; Clancy et al., 2011). A single amino acid mtDNA mutation (A278T) in Cytochrome
B of complex III renders males sterile; the primary defect appears to be at the level of spermatid
individualization (Clancy et al., 2011). In contrast, a single amino acid mutation in Cytochome Oxi-
dase I (R301L) causes male sterility primarily due to a sperm storage defect. However, the effects of
these mutations on female fitness have not yet been comprehensively addressed so we cannot attri-
bute them to be specifically ‘male-harming’.
How might mtDNA function be different in testis compared to other tissues? It is possible that
the testis has a differential requirement for COX activity. According to this hypothesis, although all
tissues suffer from the relative reduction in COX activity, testis function is specifically impacted
because it has a lower threshold of tolerance for a relative reduction in COX activity. In particular,
COX activity might be required to facilitate the dramatic morphological changes that mitochondria
undergo during sperm development in D. melanogaster (Fuller, 1998). If this hypothesis is correct,
mildly hypomorphic mutations like COIIG177S might generally impair male fertility and thus represent
a common mechanism of male-harming mtDNA mutations. Alternatively, the existence of a number
of nuclear-encoded testis-specific components of the electron transport chain, including subunits of
cytochrome C oxidase, provide a number of interacting partners that might exhibit testis-specific
genetic incompatibility with the COIIG177S mutation (Tripoli et al., 2005; Gallach et al., 2010). Since
we were unable to reliably measure COX activity in dissected testes of wildtype and mutant flies, we

of corresponding males with wildtype mtDNA. Raw progeny numbers are given in Figure 9—figure supplement 1. Most nuclear backgrounds show
mild to complete suppression of the male fertility defects observed in w1118/w118 males carrying COIIG177S mutant mtDNA (**p<0.05). Error bars
represent standard error of the mean. (B) We examined lifetime male fertility in the w1118/Oregon R background at 25˚C (note that male fertility is
generally higher at lower temperatures) to quantify the suppression of male sterility. (C) We measured male fertility of heterozygous males derived from
crosses of w1118 females (carrying wildtype or COIIG177S mutant mtDNA) to males from six DGRP strains, at 29˚C (10 replicates per group) as in (A). At
least five of the tested DGRP strains show partial to complete suppression of male sterility.

 are unable to address whether the decrease in COX activity is more severe in testes than other
tissues.
Our study has identified one mtDNA mutation, COIIG177S, whose phenotypic effects appear to be
restricted to the male germline. However, other forms of sexual dimorphism might lead to sex-spe-
cific phenotypic manifestations of other mtDNA mutations beyond reproductive tissues. For
instance, there is already evidence that mtDNA might harbor mutations that affect aging and life-
span, which is highly dimorphic between the sexes (Camus et al., 2012). At the molecular level,
COX activity was shown to be differentially affected in male versus female flies based on their
mtDNA haplotype (Sackton et al., 2003). Furthermore, almost 90% of the transcriptome in D. mela-
nogaster is differentially expressed between the sexes (Ayroles et al., 2009). Amongst those differ-
entially expressed genes, male-biased transcripts are enriched for mitochondrial energy metabolism,
thus providing ample opportunities for sex-specific effects of mtDNA (Ayroles et al., 2009). Consis-
tent with the nuclear background exerting an effect on the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA
mutants, we found that the COIIG177S -mediated sterility was suppressed in many of the D. mela-
nogaster nuclear backgrounds tested. Thus, our study not only shows the existence and biological
basis of a male-harming mutation, but also demonstrates importance of the intimate relationship
between nuclear and mtDNA genomes for the phenotypic manifestation of mtDNA mutations.
Our finding that the phenotypic consequences of a specific male-harming mtDNA mutation are
dependent on the nuclear genome also re-emphasizes the exciting possibility of uncovering the
genetic basis of nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities and the molecular basis of buffering by
nuclear genomes. Such buffering provides an important insight into the genetic basis of human
mtDNA disease in which male-harming mtDNA mutations might initially increase in frequency in a
’suppressor’ background while avoiding any negative fitness consequences. The phenotypic conse-
quences of male-harming mtDNA mutations would only be exposed in a naı
¨ve nuclear genetic back-
ground upon introduction into new populations or even (in the laboratory setting) new species. Such
nuclear-mitochondrial
incompatibilities
have
been proposed to potentially serve as the basis
of speciation (Burton and Barreto, 2012).
Although only a few such nuclear-mitochondrial
incompatibilities have been mapped in molecu-
lar detail (Ellison and Burton, 2006; Lee et al.,
2008; Chou et al., 2010; Clancy et al., 2011;
Meiklejohn et al., 2013), studies in which
mtDNA swaps were made within and between
species have revealed that many such incom-
patibilities exist (James and Ballard, 2003;
Sackton et al., 2003; Ellison and Burton,
2006; Ballard et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2008;
Montooth et al., 2010). Future genetic map-
ping experiments will help identify the nature
and
mechanism
of
nuclear
suppression
of
COIIG177S and reveal whether they are specific
or general suppressors of COIIG177S and other
male-harming
mtDNA
mutations.
Strategies

together with new advances in manipulating
mtDNA genomes (Xu et al., 2008), provide an
exciting means to uncover the dark side of one

 Materials and methods
D. melanogaster maintenance and strains
All D. melanogaster strains were maintained on standard molasses-cornmeal medium at 25˚C. We
obtained the w1118 strain of D. melanogaster free of Wolbachia contamination (kind gift of Susan
Parkhurst, FHCRC). We obtained the D. melanogaster DGRP lines from the Bloomington Drosophila
Stock Center (Bloomington, IN). The other D. melanogaster lines were either obtained from the Dro-
sophila Species Stock Center (San Diego, CA) or from our colleagues (Daven Presgraves, John Pool,
Chip Aquadro).
We confirmed absence of Wolbachia using PCR in the original w1118 stock. Briefly, six flies from
each of the assayed strains were homogenized in 49 ml squish buffer (10 mM Tris-CL pH 8, 1 mM
EDTA, 25 mM NaCl) and 1 ml Proteinase K (200 mg/ml), following which the samples were incubated
at 37˚C for 30 min, heated to 95˚C for 10 min and cooled to room temperature for 10 min. We then
used WSP (Wolbachia surface protein) primers (5’- GCATTTGGTTAYAAAATGGACGA-3’ and 5’-
GGAGTGATAGGCATATCTTCAAT-3’) and performed PCR using Taq DNA polymerase (New Eng-
land Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). We also assessed the status of Wolbachia infection after 35 generations
of experimental evolution,in the re-isolated wt and COIIG177S mtDNA lines (Figure 1—figure supple-
ment 1). All samples tested were found to be negative for Wolbachia.
Experimental evolution
An original stock was established by expanding the w1118 strain from one bottle to 36 bottles. We
established 12 experimental lines and 6 coevolving lines in bottles by adding 300 virgin females and
100 males from the original stock. The bottles were flipped three times a day for two days after
which the flies were discarded. To set up every subsequent generation, virgin females were collected
over a course of seven days and then crossed with males from the original stock in the case of the
experimental lines. For coevolving lines, males from the corresponding coevolving line were used.
After 35 generations, all lines were maintained by flipping bottles allowing sibling mating.
Fertility and sex ratio assays
All fertility and sex ratio assays were done in vials with five virgin females and three virgin males that
were all 2–5 days old. All assays were done in 10 replicates per group. Flies were transferred to new
vials every 2–3 days and flies were discarded after the fiveth’ ‘flip’. In order to assess overall fertility,
we counted all adult progeny to emerge from all of the vials.
Whole genome sequencing
100 females from the original stock and experimental line 7 were lysed in 100 ml squish buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaCl, 200 mg/ml Proteinase K) with RNase A at final
concentration of 30ng/ml. Lysate was incubated at 55˚C for 1 hr followed by 95˚C for 10 min. Total
DNA was then phenol-chloroform extracted from the lysates and the DNA pellet was dissolved in
25 ml H2O. Library preparation of samples and paired-end sequencing was performed by the Geno-
mics Shared Resource core at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center on an Illumina HiSeq 2500.
Sequence data are available through NCBI’s SRA database (project SRP057279).
Whole genome sequencing data was analyzed by aligning reads to a modified version of the D.
melanogaster reference genome assembly (BDGP Release 5), where we masked a region of the
unassembled chromosome (chrU:5288528–5305749) that harbors an alternative version of the mito-
chondrial genome sequence (in order to prevent ambiguous mapping of mitochondrial reads to the
chrU region). Reads were filtered, quality- and adapter-trimmed, and aligned to our custom refer-
ence genome using GSNAP (Wu and Nacu, 2010). SNPs were called in the non-repetitive region of

(DePristo et al., 2011) with a ’sample_ploidy’ setting of 20. A G-to-A change at position chrM:3611,
encoding COIIG177S (Figure 3), was present in 98% of Experimental Line 7 reads and 59% of reads
from the original stock. No other variants had greater than 5% higher read frequency in Experimen-
tal Line 7 than in the original w1118 sample.

 Duplex sequencing
Duplex Sequencing of fly mtDNA was performed as previously described (Kennedy et al., 2014)
with several modifications. Total DNA was purified from individual fly heads using a QIAamp DNA
micro kit (Qiagen Inc., Germantown MD). The DNA was sonicated using a Covaris AFA S2 ultrasoni-
cator (Covaris Inc., Woburn MA) with the following settings: Duty cycle: 10%; Intensity: 5; Cycles/
burst: 100; Time: 15 s � 3. The sheared DNA was then end-repaired and ligated using the NEBNext
Ultra 2 end-repair and dA-tailing kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich MA) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions. Duplex Sequencing adapters, described previously (Kennedy et al., 2014), were
ligated to the DNA library using the NEBNext Ultra 2 ligation kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich MA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1.5 ng of total DNA was then PCR amplified using
KAPA HiFi DNA polymerase (Roche Inc., Basel Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s recom-
mendations. After amplification, the mtDNA was enriched by targeted capture using xGen target
capture probes (Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville IA) specific to the fly mitochondrial
genome. The samples were then sequenced on a NextSeq500 machine (Illumina Inc., San Diego,
CA) to generate 150 bp paired-end reads. The data were processed as previously described
(Kennedy et al., 2014).
Establishing wildtype and COIIG177S lines from the original stock
15 virgin females were collected from the original w1118 stock. Each female was individually mated
with males from the same stock. Status of the G177S allele was assessed by Sanger sequencing of
the females after they were allowed to have progeny. One line that appeared to be homoplasmic
wildtype and one line that appeared to be homoplasmic mutant were kept and constituted the re-
established stocks.
Cox activity
six females or eight males from each group were gently homogenized on ice in 50 ml of sodium
phosphate buffer with 0.05% Tween-20. Lysates were centrifuged at 4˚C at 4000 � g for 1 min.
Supernatant was collected and 20 ml were used to measure COX activity using a kit (ScienCell, Carls-
bad, CA). COX activity was normalized to total protein concentration as determined by Pierce BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). Data shown represent averages of 4–5 repli-
cates per group.
ROS levels
10 flies 3–4 days old and raised at 29˚C were homogenized on ice in 200 ml PBS with 0.1% Tween-
20. Lysates were centrifuged at 4˚C at 13,000 � g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and
100 ml was incubated with 50 mM H2DCF (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence intensity was measured
in an Infinite M1000Pro (Tecan, Switzerland) microplate reader using 490 nm wavelength excitation
and 520 nm wavelength emission. ROS levels were normalized to total protein concentration as
determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit. Data shown represent averages of eight replicates per
group.
ATP levels
Five males 3–4 days old and raised at 29˚C were homogenized on ice in 100 ml guanidine extraction
buffer (6 M guanidine HCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.3). Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen for
5 min and then incubated at 95˚C for 5 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 4˚C for 10 min at 12,000 �
g. Supernatant was collected and 5 ml was diluted in 95 ml H2O. 10 ml of the diluted lysate was used
to measure ATP levels using the ATP determination kit (Cat #: A22066, Molecular Probes). ATP lev-
els were normalized to total protein concentration as determined by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit.
Data shown represent averages of four replicates per group.
Mating-induced egg laying
Five virgin wildtype females were either kept alone, or mated with three wildtype or COIIG177S
mutant males at 29˚C in vials with grape plates. Flies were flipped into new vials every day for eight
days. 24 hr after the flies were removed from a vial, number of unhatched eggs and larvae on the
grape plate were counted. Data shown represents averages of six replicates per group.

 Testis imaging
Immunofluorescence staining of testes was performed as described previously (Cheng et al., 2008 ).
Briefly, testes were dissected in PBS, transferred to 4% formaldehyde in PBS and fixed for 30–60
min. The testes were then washed in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X) for at least 30 min and
mounted in VECTASHIELD with DAPI (Vector Labs). Imaging of whole testis was performed on a
Leica SP8 confocal microscope.
Sperm imaging
Unfixed seminal vesicles were dissected in PBS mounted onto slides with PBS containing 1 mM Mito-
tracker Green and Mitotracker CMXRos (Lifetechnologies). Sperm were extruded from seminal
vesicles using a tungsten needle. Imaging was performed immediately upon addition of a cover slip
to minimize the effects of hypoxia. Still images were taken on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope and
movies were captured using a resonant scanner on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope.
Suppressor assays
Males from wild strains including the DGRP collection were crossed with w1118 females homoplas-
mic for either wildtype or COIIG177S mtDNA. Resulting heterozygous male progeny were assayed for
fertility, sperm development and motility, and COX activity.
Lifespan assay
An assay for lifespan was performed as previously described (Burman et al., 2014). Briefly, 100 flies
from each group were divided into five vials with 20 flies each. Vials were flipped every other day
and the number of dead flies was counted until all the flies had died.
Bang sensitivity
An assay for bang sensitivity was performed as previously described (Burman et al., 2014). Briefly,
vials with two flies each were mechanically stimulated by placement in a bench-top vortex for 10 s at
the maximum setting. The time for each fly to right itself after vortexing was recorded. Data shown
represents average from 18–20 flies per group.

exposure to 39˚C for 6 min the animals were then placed in new room-temperature vials (~20˚C),
and the recovery time from paralysis was recorded. Data shown represents average from 16 flies per
group.
