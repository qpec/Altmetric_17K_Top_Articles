Abstract
Several clinical trials have demonstrated that antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, taken as pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP), can prevent HIV infection1, with the magnitude of protection ranging from 
-49 to 86%2–11. While these divergent outcomes are thought to be due primarily to product

 adherence12, biological factors likely contribute13. Despite selective recruitment of higher risk 
participants for prevention trials, HIV risk is heterogeneous, even within higher risk groups14–16. 
To determine whether this heterogeneity could influence PrEP outcomes, we undertook a post-hoc 
prospective analysis of the CAPRISA 004 tenofovir 1% gel trial (n=774), one of the first trials to 
demonstrate protection against HIV infection. Concentrations of nine pro-inflammatory cytokines 
were measured in cervicovaginal lavages at >2,000 visits, and a graduated cytokine score was used 
to define genital inflammation. In women without genital inflammation, tenofovir was 57% 
protective against HIV (95% CI: 7 to 80%), compared to 3% (95% CI: −104 to 54%) if genital 
inflammation was present. Among high gel adherers, tenofovir protection was 75% (95% CI: 25 to 
92%) in women without inflammation compared to −10% (95% CI: −184 to 57%) in women with 
inflammation. Host immune predictors of HIV risk may modify the effectiveness of HIV 
prevention tools; reducing genital inflammation in women may augment HIV prevention efforts.
HIV acquisition risk varies widely within a population and is dependent on behavioral and 
biological factors. Younger women (<25 years), for example, experience higher HIV 
incidence, likely due to a combination of types and frequencies of partnerships and 
biological factors such as genital inflammation17,18. PrEP effectiveness was lowest in 
women <25 years of age in the VOICE and Dapivirine ring trials; this sub-group was least 
adherent to PrEP and did not experience significant protection2,9. The route of HIV exposure 
may also be important, considering better oral PrEP protection was observed in MSM under 
conditions of high adherence10,11, despite higher per-coital acquisition during anal sex19. 
Further, in conditions of lower adherence, protection was still evident in MSM (iPrex) but 
not in women (VOICE)2,4. Mucosal tissue penetrance and pharmacokinetics may explain 
some of these differences; for example, active tenofovir levels in colorectal tissue reach 10-
times higher concentrations than in the female genital tract (FGT)20,21.
Where products are partially effective, protection may not be equal across HIV risk groups. 
Protection in the RV144 vaccine trial was higher in individuals at low and medium risk but 
negligible in those at highest risk22. In the iPrEX Open Label Extension study in MSM, the 
“number needed to treat” with PrEP to prevent one infection differed significantly among 
risk-defined sub-groups23. Conversely, in the Partners PrEP trial, participants who 
consistently used PrEP were protected regardless of risk profile, suggesting that high 
adherence and/or effectiveness may overcome differences in susceptibility to infection24.
Case-control analyses of the three trials that have tested topical tenofovir in women 
(CAPRISA 004, VOICE, and FACTS001) showed that protection against HIV ranged from 
50-60%, if product adherence was high2,3,8. These data infer that adherence alone might not 
fully explain the incomplete efficacy of this product. Here, we evaluate how biological 
susceptibility, defined by inflammation in the FGT18, altered the protective efficacy of 
tenofovir gel.
We carried out a prospective cohort analysis of all available pre-HIV infection mucosal 
specimens from CAPRISA 004 (n = 774 women sampled at 2,139 visits). 281 women had 
genital inflammation when defined as ≥3 of 9 pro-inflammatory cytokines elevated (IL-1α, 
IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β); 204 had inflammation if 
defined by ≥4 elevated cytokines, 140 if ≥5, 90 if ≥6, and 45 women if ≥7 cytokines were

 elevated. Those not meeting the criteria for inflammation were automatically placed in the 
“no inflammation” comparator group, making the denominator n = 774 for all analyses. We 
carried out Cox regression analysis to determine whether the link between inflammation and 
HIV risk depends on the definition of inflammation that was used. Each definition of genital 
inflammation was associated with increased HIV risk adjusted for study arms (tenofovir and 
placebo); specifically aHR = 1.86 for ≥3 cytokines elevated (95% CI: 1.11-3.10), aHR = 
1.90 for ≥4 cytokines elevated (95% CI: 1.12-3.22), aHR = 2.38 for ≥5 cytokines elevated 
(95% CI: 1.37-4.15), aHR = 2.99 for ≥6 cytokines elevated (95% CI: 1.64-5.45), and aHR = 
3.42 for ≥7 cytokines elevated (95% CI: 1.62-7.23), all p<0.05. While the HIV effect 
estimates for ≥3 and ≥4 elevated cytokines were similar, a step-wise increase in HIV risk of 
approximately 50% was observed for each elevated cytokine after ≥4/9. These 
inflammation-defined strata were used for the subsequent tenofovir efficacy comparisons.
We next determined whether tenofovir gel was protective against HIV infection based on the 
presence or absence of genital inflammation (Table 1). The HIV incidence in the study was 
3.9 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 2.5–5.8), slightly lower than the main trial. In all 
inflammation-defined strata, the lowest HIV incidence rates were observed in women 
without inflammation who were randomized to tenofovir. In women with ≥3 cytokines 
elevated, HIV incidence was 6.8 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 3.8-11.1) in the tenofovir 
arm compared to 7.0 (95% CI: 3.7-11.9) in the placebo arm. In contrast, in women with <3 
elevated cytokines, HIV incidence in the tenofovir and placebo arms was 2.3 (95% CI: 
1.0-4.4) and 5.4 (95% CI: 3.4-8.2), respectively. Similar results were obtained when 
additional numbers of cytokines were elevated; in the strata defined by ≥5, ≥6, and ≥7 
elevated cytokines, HIV incidence was higher in women with inflammation randomized to 
tenofovir compared to women with inflammation randomized to placebo (Table 1).
The overall efficacy of tenofovir gel in this study was 34% (95% CI -11-61%). Stratifying 
by genital inflammation clearly segregated efficacy estimates: women with ≥3 cytokines 
elevated had a tenofovir efficacy of 3% (95% CI -104-54%, p=0.936), compared to those 
with <3 elevated cytokines, where a tenofovir efficacy of 57% (95% CI 7-80%, p=0.033) 
was observed (Figure 1a). Tenofovir efficacy was 11% for ≥4 cytokines elevated, -8% for ≥5 
cytokines, -147% for ≥6 cytokines, and -37% for ≥7 cytokines (all p>0.1). In contrast, 
tenofovir efficacy ranged from 34-56% in the corresponding no-inflammation groups, and 
these comparisons were statistically significant (p<0.05) for ≥3, ≥5, and ≥6/9 cytokines. 
Similar results were obtained in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, 
adjusting for age, study site, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 serostatus, history of sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs), number of sex acts and sexual partners, condom and injectable 
contraception use (Table 2). Interestingly, HSV-2 positivity mattered more for HIV 
acquisition if inflammation was not present, in line with findings that HSV-2 seroprevelence 
is not associated with inflammatory cytokines25. Conversely, increasing numbers of sex acts 
was associated with HIV only in those with inflammation. Given that gel dosing was per-
coital, it is difficult to disaggregate effects of sex and exposure to tenofovir gel in these 
analyses. Nevertheless, these data confirm that FGT inflammation predicted the efficacy of 
tenofovir gel in women.

 We further tested for interaction between genital inflammation and study arm in a Cox 
regression analysis with time-varying covariates, taking into account repeated measures of 
genital inflammation. In a model that included genital inflammation (≥3/9 elevated 
cytokines), study arm, and an interaction term between inflammation and study arm, a 
significant interaction between genital inflammation and study arm was observed (p=0.028). 
Similar findings were obtained for ≥4/9 and 5/9, although these were not statistically 
significant (p=0.127 and 0.11, respectively). Similar results were obtained in models 
adjusting for potential confounders. These findings support the conclusion that genital 
inflammation attenuated the efficacy of tenofovir gel.
Previous analyses of the CAPRISA 004 trial demonstrated a dose-dependent relationship 
between gel adherence, measured by the percentage of sex acts covered by two gel doses, 
and protection26. We hypothesized that the combination of having no inflammation and high 
adherence would provide the best protection from HIV infection, and that high levels of 
inflammation might supersede the protective effects conferred by adherence. Indeed, 
tenofovir gel-mediated protection was highest in women without genital inflammation who 
used the gel at ≥50% of sex acts (Supplemental Table 1), with efficacy of 75% (95% CI 
25-92%, p=0.014; <3 cytokines in the upper quartile). In comparison, tenofovir efficacy was 
-10% (95% CI -184-57%, p=0.844) in highly adherent women with genital inflammation 
(≥3 elevated cytokines). Tenofovir efficacy was attenuated in women who used gel 
infrequently (< 50% adherence) irrespective of their inflammation status (25 and 15% 
efficacy, p=0.781 and p=0.656, respectively). Similar results were obtained in adjusted 
models containing the same covariates as described in Table 2. We also obtained similar 
results in survival analyses. In the strata defined by low adherence, genital inflammation 
status was the major predictor of HIV acquisition risk (Figure 1b, solid lines) and there was 
little evidence of tenofovir-mediated protection. However, in those with high adherence to 
tenofovir (Figure 1c), protection afforded by the gel was restricted to the no inflammation 
group. Similar results were obtained for all cytokine scores (≥4, 5, 6, and 7 elevated 
cytokines; data not shown). These data provide compelling evidence that women without 
genital tract inflammation largely account for the protective effect of tenofovir gel adherence 
that was observed in the CAPRISA 004 trial3.
The FGT mucosa typically provides an effective barrier against HIV infection, as reflected 
by the low per-coital rates of male-to-female HIV transmission in epidemiological 
studies27,28. Genital inflammation may decrease natural host defenses against HIV, with the 
corollary being that individuals with inflammation are more difficult to protect by anti-viral 
agents such as tenofovir. We have previously described reduced levels of key mucosal 
barrier proteins and increased numbers of cervical CD4+ T cells, the key targets of HIV, in 
women with cytokine profiles similar to those used in our inflammation scoring29, a finding 
supported by other studies30,31. This barrier susceptibility hypothesis is corroborated by 
recent data from CAPRISA 004 showing that women with genital inflammation and 
tenofovir have less fit viruses crossing the barrier and establishing HIV infection32. Cellular 
activation may further increase intracellular dNTP pools and compete with the ability of 
tenofovir-diphosphate to block HIV reverse transcriptase and prevent infection33. 
Understanding these mechanisms will be critical in designing more effective PrEP strategies, 
particularly in women.

 Strengths of this study include its longitudinal design and large sample size, one of the 
largest studies of mucosal inflammation in the context of an HIV prevention trial. Genital 
inflammation was evaluated at repeated measures in participants randomized to tenofovir or 
placebo gel exposure, and inclusion of the entire available cohort allowed us to calculate 
HIV incidence and tenofovir efficacy in sub-groups of at-risk individuals. The study tested 
an a priori hypothesis, and immunological analyses were blinded with extensive quality 
control measures put in place to ensure the accuracy of cytokine measurements across 
multiple sample runs. While inflammation is difficult to capture by any one measurement, 
pro-inflammatory cytokines are believed to be central to this process. Our sensitivity 
analyses support the notion that inflammation was consistently able to differentiate women 
protected by tenofovir, irrespective of how many cytokines were elevated.
Our study had some limitations. Specimens were available only at certain study visits and 
were not available for a subset of individuals including some cases who acquired HIV prior 
to the first available genital sample. However, in the remaining cohort we took a median 
measure of several visits, and are therefore better able to classify individuals than by a single 
measurement. Our major conclusions were further borne out by a second time-varying 
analysis, showing a significant interaction between genital inflammation (≥3 elevated 
cytokines) and study arm in predicting HIV acquisition. For adherence, we relied on self-
reported return of used applicators. Mucosal tenofovir concentration data are available in a 
subset of participants26, although for too few for comparisons of gel efficacy. We based our 
adherence analyses on ≥50% product use; while this has clear clinical implications regarding 
protection, the study is underpowered for further adherence cut-offs, and for adherence-
inflammation interaction analyses. Despite our large sample size, a relatively small 
proportion of the cohort had genital inflammation, limiting statistical power to definitively 
conclude that those with inflammation were not protected by tenofovir gel. Further 
validation in additional cohorts could increase this sample size, but this has logistical 
challenges. Finally, we deliberately selected composite cytokine outputs based on prior 
studies18 to overcome the burden of multiple test correction for individual cytokine 
concentrations, and used multiple elevated cytokine cut-offs to determine the rigour of these 
definitions of genital inflammation in assessing HIV outcomes.
The causes of inflammation remain unclear. Several groups have shown that bacterial 
vaginosis (BV) and/or changes in the vaginal microbiome are associated with genital 
inflammation34,35, including in CAPRISA 00436. We and others have also recently shown 
that vaginal dysbiosis impairs tenofovir efficacy, perhaps by reducing levels of tenofovir in 
the mucosa37. Interestingly, the same may not apply to oral PrEP, as BV and/or vaginal 
dysbiosis did not affect PrEP efficacy in the Partners PrEP study38. This could be due to 
pharmacological differences between oral and topical PrEP. Since not all BV/dysbiosis 
results in inflammation39, repeating our inflammation analyses in other PrEP studies will 
help to understand the generalizability of our findings.
In summary, the combination of gel adherence and genital inflammation differentiated 
women who were protected by topical tenofovir from those who were not. This was 
pronounced in participants who did not have genital inflammation but were highly adherent 
to gel, who experienced protection levels as high as 75%. However, those with genital

 inflammation who were adherent to gel had no protection, underscoring the unlikelihood of 
any protective effect in the “inflammation/adherent” group. Inflammation is a major risk 
factor for HIV acquisition; reducing genital inflammation by treating its root causes or by 
anti-inflammatory agents might further optimize PrEP for women. Genital inflammation 
should be investigated as a potential effect modifier in trials of novel PrEP products.
Methods
Study design
We undertook a prospective cohort study to assess the impact of mucosal cytokine levels on 
HIV acquisition and tenofovir efficacy using specimens collected during the CAPRISA004 
trial, a phase 2B randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial that measured the safety and 
efficacy of tenofovir 1% gel3,40. The study was approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics 
Committee (BREC) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, and all participants provided 
informed written consent to participate. The a priori objective of these experiments was to 
compare tenofovir efficacy stratified by inflammation and adherence status of participants, 
with the hypothesis that tenofovir efficacy would be reduced by mucosal inflammation. The 
target sample size was all those with available pre-HIV infection specimens from the intent-
to-treat (ITT) analysis CAPRISA 004 cohort. The final analysis included 774 women 
sampled at 2,139 study visits, or 87% of the original intent-to-treat cohort. We were not able 
to carry out analyses in instances where storage consent was not provided, no specimens 
were available, or when participants acquired HIV before samples could be obtained. The 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for CAPRISA 004 have been published previously40; these 
included sexually active women aged 18-40 years living near either an urban or rural study 
site in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. All clinical and epidemiological variables used in these 
analyses are part of the original locked database generated in the parent clinical trial3.
Cytokine assays
The concentrations of 9 cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, 
MIP-1α, MIP-1β) were measured in undiluted cervicovaginal lavage (CVL) specimens by 
multiplexed ELISA assays (Bio-Plex; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc; Hercules, Ca, USA). For 
consistency, fresh assays were performed on all participants including those previously 
published in Masson et al18, and all laboratory personnel were blinded to all clinical and 
epidemiological variables. Cytokine concentrations were measured using a Bio-Plex 200 
Array Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The sensitivity of these kits ranged between 0.2 and 
45.2 pg/ml for each of the cytokines measured. Data were collected using Bio-Plex Manager 
software version 6, and a 5 PL regression formula was used to calculate sample 
concentrations from the standard curves. Cytokine levels below the lower limit of detection 
of the assay were recorded as half the lowest concentration measured for each cytokine. 
Similarly, cytokine levels above the detectable limit were recorded as twice the highest 
concentration measured for each cytokine. To minimize the effect of inter-plate variability, 
all CVL specimens collected from the same participant were assayed on the same plate.

 Statistical analyses
HIV was the primary endpoint for all analyses. Inflammation, study arm, and adherence 
were the main explanatory variables, with some models adjusted for additional variables. 
Inflammation was defined by the number of cytokines in the upper quartile, using our 
published scoring criteria18. For stratified analyses, we calculated median cytokine values 
across multiple HIV- study visits (intra-individual), and determined whether the median 
cytokine concentration was in the upper quartile for each cytokine based on data from the 
entire cohort (Supplemental Figure 1). To diagnose inflammation, a score was calculated 
based on the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the upper quartile. Inflammation 
groups that included 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 or more elevated cytokines were used to stratify 
individuals, and to examine the effect of different cytokine cut-offs on HIV risk and 
tenofovir protection. All those not meeting each “inflammation” cut-off were considered to 
be in the “no inflammation” group; all analyses therefore included all 774 participants. For 
time-varying analyses, we calculated whether genital inflammation was present at each visit, 
and assigned that value as the absence or presence of inflammation (0/1) to all person-time 
preceding that visit. All person-time that occurred following the final visit was determined to 
be the same as the final inflammation measurement.
Stratification by adherence was carried out using a cut-off of 50% of sex acts covered by 
returned used applicators, as increases in the proportion meeting this threshold were shown 
to correlate with protection against HIV in the original analysis3. Analyses of tenofovir 
efficacy were carried out using the subset of the intent-to-treat population, stratified by either 
inflammation status and/or gel adherence. Follow-up time was calculated from 
randomization to the estimated date of HIV infection or termination date, whichever 
occurred first.
We used Poisson distributions to calculate confidence intervals for incidence rates and 
incidence rate ratios (IRR). Efficacy was reported as 1-IRR. A z-test was used to compare 
IRRs between the two study arms. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard 
regression was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios for a range of covariates as indicated 
in the relevant tables, including inflammation modeled as time-varying and interaction 
analyses between inflammation and study arm. We inspected the plausibility of the 
proportional hazards assumption by visual inspection of log [-log(survival)] curves. All p-
values are reported as two-sided and without adjustment for multiple testing.

 Figure 1. 
Tenofovir efficacy stratified by inflammation status, defined by the number of elevated 
cytokines that were detected in female genital tract secretions (n = 774) a). Those meeting 
the cytokine cut-off for inflammation are indicated in red boxes (efficacy estimate) and 
whiskers (95% confidence intervals), with those falling below this cut-off indicated in blue 
boxes and whiskers. Tenofovir efficacy is shown on the x-axis, with a dotted black line 
indicating 0% efficacy. Overall tenofovir efficacy of the participants included in this analysis 
is indicated by the grey box and whiskers. Efficacy was calculated as 1-incident rate ratio 
(IRR) multiplied by 100, as shown in Table 1. Kaplan-Meier survival plots indicating the 
probability of seroconversion stratified by gel adherence (< and ≥50%, panels b and c, 
respectively). Separate lines are indicated for participants in the tenofovir arm of the study, 
with (solid black) and without genital inflammation (dotted black), and the placebo arm of 
the study, with (solid red) and without genital inflammation (dotted red). Genital 
inflammation in this analysis was defined by ≥3 of 9 cytokines in the upper quartile. The 
number of HIV infections/the number at risk in each strata and time point are shown below 
each graph. All statistical tests were two-sided and unadjusted for multiple comparisons.

*This analysis is based on inflammation being defined as ≥ 3 elevated cytokines; the results are similar when definition of inflammation is based on 
a higher number (up to 7 of 9) of elevated cytokines (data not shown). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression was used to calculate 
adjusted hazard ratios for a range of covariates as indicated in the table (n = 774 women sampled at 2,139 visits). P values are two-sided and 
unadjusted for multiple testing.
NET-EN = Norethisterone enantate
