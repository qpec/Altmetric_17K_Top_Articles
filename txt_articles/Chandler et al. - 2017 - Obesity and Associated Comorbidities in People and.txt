Summary
This article reviews the biology, prevalence and risks for obesity in people and companion dogs and cats, and
explores the links between obesity and diabetes mellitus and cancer across these species. Obesity is a major
healthcare problem in both human and veterinary medicine and there is an increasing prevalence of obesity
in people and pets. In people and animals, obesity is a complex disorder involving diet, level of physical activity,
behavioural factors, socioeconomic factors, environment exposures, genetics, metabolism and the microbiome.
Pets and people share a number of obesity-related comorbidities. Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 dia-
betes mellitus in people and in cats, but this association is not recognized in dogs. Obesity is a recognized risk
factor for a number of human cancers, but there are fewer data available describing this association with canine
neoplastic disease. One approach to addressing the problem of obesity is by taking a ‘One Health’ perspective.
Comparative clinical research examining shared lifestyle and environmental risk factors and the reasons under-
lying species differences should provide new perspectives on the fundamental biology of obesity. One Health
programmes involving human healthcare professionals and veterinarians could help address obesity with sim-
ple interventions at the community level.

Introduction
In developed nations, people and small companion
animals share, to varying degrees, their lifestyle and
environment. This partnership comes with myriad
implications for health and well-being, including
high rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular
disease and certain cancers. What opportunities exist
to leverage this intimate relationship, to mitigate
shared risk and to improve the health status of people
and companion animals? ‘One Health’ provides a
compelling framework to create understanding and
to formulate solutions (Day, 2010; Sandoe et al.,
2014). The One Health perspective encourages co-
ordinated and collaborative action by human and
veterinary healthcare professionals to address health
problems common to man and animals. An excellent
candidate problem for a One Health approach is that
of obesity, which has become a major health issue in
people and small companion animals. In this review,
we present what is currently known about the preva-
lence and risks for obesity in pets and people, discuss
comparative aspects of selected obesity-associated co-
morbidities and put forward ideas to aid future
research and interventions to encourage healthy be-
haviours.
Obesity is defined as the accumulation of excess
body fat. In small companion animals, due to species,
breed and age variation, measurement and subse-
quent diagnosis of an overweight state and obesity is
complex. The most widely adopted procedures are
various forms of morphometry, such as dimensional
evaluation
and
body
condition
scoring,
where
measured parameters are used to estimate body
composition. Dimensional evaluation involves the
correlation of a measurement of length (e.g. the
head, thorax or limb) or girth (i.e. around the rib-
cage) with lean body mass or fat mass (Stanton
et al., 1992; Hawthorne and Butterwick, 2000).
These techniques have led to the development of a
feline body mass index (BMI) (Hawthorne and
Butterwick,
2000);
however,
variation
between
canine breeds has made the development of a similar
system for dogs problematic (Burkholder, 1994). A
number of body condition score (BCS) schemes
have been devised (Laflamme, 1997a,b; German
et al., 2006), all of which are subjective and
semiquantitative and involve visual and tactile
assessment of characteristics that correlate with
abdominal and subcutaneous fat (e.g. the rib cage,
dorsal spinous processes and waist). Definition of
overweight and obesity used across research studies
is, to some degree, non-standardized as a result.
Categories of weight status in people are most often
assessed by BMI. BMI is an easy-to-obtain measure of
weight accounting for height and is estimated as
weight (kg)/height (m)2. BMI correlates equitably
with direct measures of body fat (http://www.cdc.
gov/obesity/adult/defining.html). For adults, a BMI
$25 but <30, is used in most populations to define
overweight and a BMI of $30 is used to define obesity.
For children, to account for growth, weight status is
relative to age and sex. In the USA, BMI at ages
2e19 years is compared with age- and sex-specific per-
centiles on the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) growth charts and obesity is defined as a
BMI $ the 95th percentile for age and sex (http://
www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/defining.html).
Prevalence and Trends for Obesity
For dogs, the population prevalence of overweight
and obesity has been estimated at 19.7e59.3%
(McGreevy et al., 2005; Lund et al., 2006; Hill, 2009;
Courcier et al., 2010a; Corbee, 2013; Mao et al.,
2013) and for cats at 11.5e52% (Burkholder and
Toll, 2000; Lund et al., 2005; German, 2006; Hill,
2009; Courcier et al., 2010b, 2012; Cave et al., 2012;
Corbee, 2014). In a general veterinary practice
population in the USA, followed over a 5-year period
from 2007 to 2011, overweight and obesity increased
by 37% in dogs and 90% in cats (Banfield, 2012)
Obesity and Associated Comorbidities
297
 reflecting the increasing trend in prevalence for hu-
man obesity.
Surveys in the USA have reported that in
2011e2014, more than a third of adults (36.5%)
had obesity (Ogden et al., 2015). Obesity is higher
among American adults aged 40e59 years (40.2%)
and adults aged $60 (37.0%) than among adults
aged 20e39 years (32.3%) (Ogden et al., 2015). In
2011e2014, one-sixth of American children and ado-
lescents aged 2e19 years (17.0%) had obesity.
Risk Factors for Obesity
Risk Factors in Small Companion Animals
Dogs and cats share some but not all risk factors for
overweight and obesity. Genetic risk for the disease
manifests in higher risk for particular canine (e.g.
Labradors and golden retrievers) and feline breeds
(e.g. Manx and domestic shorthair) (Edney and
Smith, 1986; Lund et al., 2005, 2006; German, 2006;
Corbee, 2013, 2014). Other risk factors include
gender, neutering status and middle age. Middle-
aged neutered female dogs are most likely to be over-
weight or obese (Kronfeld et al., 1991; McGreevy
et al., 2005; German, 2006; Laflamme, 2006; Lund
et al., 2006), while middle-aged neutered male cats
are most likely to be overweight or obese (Kronfeld
et al., 1991; Scarlett et al., 1994; Lund et al., 2005;
German, 2006; Laflamme, 2006; Courcier et al.,
2010b, 2012; Cave et al., 2012; Serisier et al., 2013;
Corbee,
2014).
Obesity
risk
associated
with
neutering is due to a combination of decreased
energy requirements after neutering and an increase
in food consumption (Fettman et al., 1997; Kanchuk
et al., 2003). Less is understood about how the level
of exercise and activity in dogs and cats relates to
obesity. For dogs, reduced daily exercise has been
associated with obesity (Bland et al., 2009; Courcier
et al., 2010a), as has limited or no outdoor activity
for cats (Rowe et al., 2015).
Population-level associations have also been shown
between obesity and comorbid conditions. Diseases
found
concurrently
with
overweight
or
obesity
include arthritis, endocrine dysfunction (e.g. hypo-
thyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism), cruciate liga-
ment rupture, lower urinary tract disease, oral
disease, diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis and neoplasia
(Hess et al., 1999; Lund et al., 2005; Lund et al.,
2006; Laflamme, 2006; Marshall et al., 2009).
Anaesthetic risk has also been reported to be
increased in overweight or obese dogs (German,
2006). Some of these associations are likely to be
causal (e.g. canine hypothyroidism) and some are
the result of excess body condition (e.g. canine
pancreatitis, feline diabetes mellitus). Longevity for
people at a healthy body weight is greater than for
those who have obesity (Kolonin et al., 2004;
Houston et al., 2009). Evidence suggests that this
may also be true for dogs (Kealy et al., 2000).
Diet and nutrition play a role in overweight and
obesity in people and pets. High-fat diets are associ-
ated with overweight or obesity in dogs (Laflamme,
2006). The source of food (commercially prepared
versus home-made) was not a significant factor for
canine obesity in one study (Kienzle et al., 1998),
but a non-commercial source of diet was a risk factor
in another study (Mao et al., 2013). The price of pet
food has been found to be associated with obesity;
owners of obese dogs are more likely to indicate the
importance of inexpensive foods (Kienzle et al.,
1998). Obesity has also been associated with the num-
ber of meals and snacks fed and feeding of kitchen/ta-
ble scraps, fresh meat and commercial treats for dogs
(Kienzle et al., 1998; Bland et al., 2009; Sallander et al.,
2010) as well as feeding ad libitum in cats (Courcier
et al., 2010b)
Human-related (i.e. pet owner) risk factors for
canine and feline obesity include owner household in-
come and exercise habits (Kienzle et al., 1998;
Courcier et al., 2010a). Owners of overweight or
obese dogs have a lower net income than owners of
normal weight dogs and are less likely to participate
in regular exercise (Kienzle et al., 1998; Courcier
et al., 2010a).
Owner’s
age
was
associated
positively
with
increased
risk
for
pet
overweight
and
obesity
(Courcier et al., 2010a). Some of the factors known
to protect cats and dogs from overweight and obesity
relate to positive aspects of the humaneanimal bond.
While overweight and obesity in cats is associated
with a close bond between the owner and their pet
(Kienzle et al., 2001; Kienzle and Bergler, 2006);
this result is not the same for dogs (Kienzle et al.,
1998), suggesting that the character of the relation-
ship is key. Owners of cats of normal weight played
with their cat more often than owners of overweight
or obese cats and felt that the cat invited play more
often and played with a wider variety of objects
(Kienzle and Bergler, 2006). Access to parks and na-
ture reserves was rated as more important for dog
owners as compared with non-dog owners. In addi-
tion, dog-owners felt they had more social support
from family to walk and do other forms of physical ac-
tivity (Cutt et al., 2008)
Risk Factors in People
Excessive accumulation of adipose tissue in people is
generally caused by an imbalance between energy
298
M. Chandler et al.
 expenditure and energy intake. However, multiple in-
dividual characteristics (e.g. genetics, health status
including sleep and stress, medication use, micro-
biome and knowledge) and factors relating to the
family and social environments (e.g. peer pressure
and norms), institutions (e.g. work sites, parks and
community retail) and macropolicies (e.g. federal,
state and local policies that alter access, availability
and affordability) can affect behaviours, energy
intake, metabolism and expenditure. Other reviews
have discussed how factors intersect at various levels
(Institute of Medicine, 2005, 2012).
Diet, as it relates to excess calories, is a modifiable
factor in weight gain. An approach for healthy weight
maintenance is to replace lower-calorie nutrient-
dense foods with intake of high-calorie low-nutrient
foods. The latter are often those higher in water and
fibre, which can aid satiety. The evidence review con-
ducted for the latest US 2015e2020 Dietary Guide-
lines found that there was moderate evidence that
diet patterns that are ‘higher in vegetables, fruits
and whole grains; include seafood and legumes; are
moderate in dairy products (particularly low and
non-fat dairy) and alcohol; lower in meats (including
red and processed meats) and low in sugar-sweetened
foods and beverages and refined grains are associ-
ated with favourable outcomes related to healthy
body weight or risk of obesity’ (Dietary Guidelines
Advisory Committee, 2015).
Another modifiable risk factor for weight gain is
insufficient energy expenditure due to physical inac-
tivity
(Strong
et
al.,
2005;
Physical
Activity
Guidelines Advisory Committee, 2008). Sedentary
behaviours may be an additional risk factor for
weight gain independent of physical activity. These
behaviours include sitting and immobile behaviours,
with the one most studied being television (TV)
watching, but with new research emerging on other
screen-time behaviours. Possible mechanisms for the
influence of TV on weight gain in people include
poor dietary behaviours while watching TV, the
replacement of physical activity and unhealthy food
purchases and intake due to marketing exposure dur-
ing commercials (Woodward-Lopez et al., 2006).
An additional factor that may be related to obesity
risk is the role of the microbiome. The quality and
composition of diet and an individual’s genetic en-
dowments may impact on the types of microbes that
exist in the gastrointestinal tract, which in turn can
alter energy utilization (Patterson et al., 2016).
Another area of research is the role of environmental
chemicals in weight gain. Chemicals can be passed on
from mother to child during pregnancy and breast-
feeding, ingested in foodstuffs or taken up through
inhalation or dermal exposure. Research is emerging
which reports that some chemicals may disturb the
endocrine system and potentially change metabolic
feedback and metabolism impacting on energy bal-
ance (Heindel et al., 2015).
Obesity-associated Comorbidities: Diabetes
Mellitus
Diabetes mellitus is a serious health condition across
species. Diabetes may be classified based on patho-
physiological mechanisms as type 1, which is charac-
terized by loss or destruction of pancreatic insulin-
producing b cells, and type 2, which is characterized
by insulin resistance and dysfunctional b cells.
Numerous human studies have linked type 2 diabetes
with obesity (Dietz, 1998; Luder et al., 1998; Must
and Strauss, 1999; Fagot-Campagna et al., 2000,
2001; Ge et al., 2001; Wang and Dietz, 2002;
Friedlander et al., 2003; Must and Anderson, 2003;
Haines and Neumark-Sztainer, 2006).
Diabetes Mellitus in Dogs
Nearly all diabetic dogs have type 1 diabetes and are in-
sulin dependent at the time of diagnosis (Panciera et al.,
1990). The rate of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in dogs
is approximately 0.6% (Guptill et al., 2003). Several
breeds (e.g. Australian terriers, Samoyeds, miniature
Schnauzers, miniature and toy poodles) are at higher
risk (Chastain et al., 2001; Guptill et al., 2003),
indicating a likely genetic basis. Secondary diabetes,
which is carbohydrate intolerance secondary to con-
current insulin antagonistic disease or medications, is
recognized in the dog; this includes dioestrus or
pregnant bitches with diabetes due to progesterone-
related insulin resistance.
As diabetes in dogs is generally due to a lack of
insulin-producing pancreatic b cells, obesity does
not cause diabetes mellitus; however, obesity does
decrease insulin sensitivity in dogs and can therefore
affect diabetic control (Panciera et al., 1990).
Diabetes Mellitus in Cats
Type 2 diabetes is estimated to be present in >80% of
cats with diabetes. Feline type 2 diabetes is character-
ized by insulin resistance, variable loss of insulin secre-
tion and amyloid deposition in the pancreatic islets.
The prevalence of diabetes in cats is thought to be
increasing. In the USA, one study reports that feline
diabetes has increased from 0.08% to 1.2% in 30
years (Prahl et al., 2007) and a prevalence of 0.4%
has been recorded in the UK (McCann et al., 2007).
Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include obesity and
increasing age (Rand, 1997; Baral et al., 2003;
McCann et al., 2007). Most affected cats are >8
Obesity and Associated Comorbidities
299
 years of age, and most commonly between 10 and 12
years old, when they get diabetes (Rand, 1997;
McCann et al., 2007; Lederer et al., 2007). This is
also the peak age for obesity. Other risk factors in
cats include prior administration of corticosteroids,
male gender, being neutered and, in Australia and
the UK, being of the Burmese breed (Lederer et al.,
2007; McCann et al., 2007).
In domestic shorthair cats, a polymorphism of the
melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene is associated
with the development of diabetes mellitus in over-
weight cats, similar to what is found in people. This
gene is associated with energy balance and appetite
regulation (Focada et al., 2014). The increased prev-
alence of diabetes mellitus in Burmese cats also indi-
cates a likely genetic basis (O’Leary et al., 2013).
Obesity or overweight body condition is the most
recognized risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus
(Baral et al., 2003; McCann et al., 2007), although
some cats with diabetes present with a history of
weight loss. Obese cats are several times more likely
to become diabetic than cats of normal weight
because
obesity
causes
insulin
resistance
(i.e.
decreased sensitivity to insulin) (Rand et al., 2004).
Insulin sensitivity decreases by >50% in obese cats
compared with lean cats (Chastain and Panciera,
2002). An increase in BCS from 5/9 to 6/9 in growing
kittens decreased insulin sensitivity (Haring et al.,
2013) and the gain of even 1 kg in an average-sized
cat may decrease insulin sensitivity by 30% (Hoenig
et al., 2007). Cats initially compensate well for insulin
resistance and do not show elevated serum glucose
concentrations. Eventually, in some cats, the function
of the pancreatic b cells decreases and they do become
overtly diabetic.
Several aspects of obesity likely contribute to
decreased insulin sensitivity. Adipokines are metabol-
ically active substances secreted from the fat mass,
which act systemically or locally to influence meta-
bolic reactions. Increased fat mass is thought to
contribute to dysregulation of adipokine production
(Kil and Swanson, 2010). Adiponectin is an adipokine
that decreases in most species, including cats, with an
increase in fat mass (Ishioka et al., 2009). Adiponectin
affects the regulation of carbohydrates and lipid meta-
bolism. Adiponectin secretion is stimulated by insulin
and enhances insulin sensitivity and increases glucose
uptake via glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) mol-
ecules. GLUT4 expression is decreased during the
development of obesity in cats (Brennan et al., 2004)
and it also increases fat and carbohydrate oxidation
in peripheral tissues, suppresses hepatic gluconeogen-
esis and inhibits the inflammatory response (Ishioka
et al., 2009). Similarly, low adiponectin is associated
with progression to type 2 diabetes in obese people.
In contrast, in a study of dogs, serum adiponectin
concentrations were not found to be associated with
insulin sensitivity, and adiponectin levels are not al-
ways associated as directly with body fat in dogs as
in people and cats (Verkest et al., 2011). It may be
that the differences in adiponectin in dogs compared
with people and cats contribute to type 2 diabetes
mellitus being less common in dogs.
Many studies of insulin sensitivity in obese dogs
have used the ‘obese dog model’, in which research
dogs gain weight due to a high fat diet, often including
saturated fats such as lard (Kley et al., 2009). A study
examining the effect of types of fat compared inclusion
of a saturated fat (lard) to polyunsaturated fat (corn
oil) and showed that the lard diet increased circu-
lating insulin and decreased insulin sensitivity, while
corn oil did not have an effect on either parameter
(Truett et al., 1998). A study in cats fed a diet supple-
mented with omega-3 fatty acids showed that
increased serum concentrations of the omega-3 fatty
acid docosahexaenoic acid were associated directly
with increased concentrations of adiponectin in obese
cats (Mazaki-Tovi et al., 2011).
Concerns have been raised that the feeding of dry
diets, which are often higher in carbohydrates than
are canned diets, may contribute in the risk of type
2 diabetes mellitus in cats. While the data from
various studies are conflicting, it appears that the
feeding of dry diets and carbohydrates per se are not
significant risk factors for diabetes for cats of normal
weight (Backus et al., 2007; Slingerland et al., 2009),
with the possible exception of Burmese cats in the
UK and Australia. Body weight gain due to excess
calorie intake is more likely than the type of diet to
induce a pre-diabetic condition of insulin resistance
and secretion dysfunction.
Diabetes in People
Human diabetes is generally the result of functional or
physical loss of b cells. Through the reduced number
or capacity of its b cells, the pancreas either does not
produce sufficient insulin or is not able to effectively
use the insulin that is produced. This can result from
an autoimmune process, which generally underlies
type 1 diabetes, and insulin resistance, which generally
underlies type 2 diabetes (Alberti and Zimmet, 1998;
Tuomi, 2005). Type 1 and type 2 diabetes often
occur in the same families, suggesting an underlying
shared genetic susceptibility (Tuomi, 2005).
Type 1 diabetes is characterized by deficient insulin
production and patients must administer insulin
daily. Type 2 diabetes results from the body’s ineffec-
tive use of insulin or need for insulin above the capac-
ity produced by the body, due to obesity and physical

 inactivity. Type 1 diabetes has generally been diag-
nosed in children and type 2 in adults, although
type 2 is now also being observed in children. Both
result in hyperglycaemia, which damages the body,
especially the nerves and blood vessels (World
Health Organization, 1999). Therefore, diabetes is a
major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks,
stroke and lower limb amputation.
A third type of diabetes, gestational diabetes, is
hyperglycaemia during pregnancy at levels above
normal, but below those of diabetes. Gestational dia-
betes is usually at least temporarily resolved after de-
livery, although it is associated with complications
during pregnancy and delivery and higher risk of
type 2 diabetes in the mother and child (World
Health Organization, 2013).
In 2014, worldwide 422 million people were esti-
mated to have diabetes, up from 108 million in 1980
(World Health Organization, 2016). In the USA,
the number of people with diabetes more than tripled
from 8.5 million in 1990 to 29 million in 2014 (Ali
et
al.,
2014;
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention, 2015). Levels are highest in the USA
and other Western countries, but the prevalence is
rising fastest in middle- and low-income countries.
Diabetes leads to considerable morbidity, mortality
and cost; it is the leading cause of adult-onset blind-
ness, kidney failure and non-traumatic limb amputa-
tions. In the USA, it is the seventh leading cause of
death (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2014) and globally 1.5 million deaths were attributed
to diabetes in 2012 (World Health Organization,
2016). Diabetes is also a leading driver of medical ex-
penditures (Thorpe et al., 2010); in the USA in 2012,
diabetes was associated with $245 billion in health-
care expenditure and productivity losses (American
Diabetes Association, 2013).
The majority of people with diabetes have type 2
diabetes. While the prevalence of type 1 versus
type 2 diabetes is difficult to calculate, type 1 has
been estimated to make up about 5% of diabetes
cases in the USA (Menke et al., 2013). The preva-
lence of type 1 diabetes varies across populations
(Tuomi, 2005).
Links Between Obesity and Diabetes in People.
Overweight
and obesity are prevalent in people with both type 1
and type 2 diabetes. Obesity is the leading risk factor
for type 2 diabetes, but also increases the risk for devel-
oping type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes (Dietz,
1998; Luder et al., 1998; Must and Strauss, 1999;
Fagot-Campagna et al., 2000, 2001; Ge et al., 2001;
Wang and Dietz, 2002; Friedlander et al., 2003; Must
and Anderson, 2003; Haines and Neumark-Sztainer,
2006; Chu et al., 2007; Polsky and Ellis, 2015).
Obesity also increases morbidities associated with
both types of diabetes.
The strong links between obesity and diabetes
begin during the early stages of human development.
A woman’s pre-pregnancy obesity is a risk factor for
her
child
developing
obesity
and
diabetes
(Christoffel et al., 2012) as a mother’s pre-pregnancy
weight is associated with fetal insulin resistance,
which in turn is associated with fetal adiposity. New-
borns of obese mothers have greater percent body fat
and insulin resistance (Reece, 2008; Catalano et al.,
2009). At the same time, mothers with diabetes are
more likely to have children with obesity (Metzger,
2007; Metzger et al., 2009). Children exposed to
maternal diabetes in utero are at greater risk of
developing
obesity
and
abnormal
glucose
metabolism
during
childhood,
adolescence
and
adulthood (Metzger, 2007). Maternal glucose is asso-
ciated with neonatal adiposity, likely through fetal in-
sulin
production
(Metzger
et
al.,
2009).
Fetal
hyperinsulinaemia, which is related to maternal gly-
caemia,
is
associated
linearly
with
birthweight
(Kohl and Hobbs, 1998; Dabelea et al., 2008;
Christoffel et al., 2012). By the time they are 14e17
years old, children of mothers with gestational
diabetes have BMIs on average 3.7 points higher
than
children
whose
mothers
did
not
have
gestational diabetes (Silverman et al., 1998).
Even beyond the early developmental periods,
obesity in childhood and adulthood continue to be
risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Young onset of type
2 diabetes is a well documented consequence of
obesity (Dietz, 1998; Luder et al., 1998; Must and
Strauss, 1999; Fagot-Campagna et al., 2000, 2001;
Ge et al., 2001; Wang and Dietz, 2002; Friedlander
et al., 2003; Must and Anderson, 2003; Haines and
Neumark-Sztainer,
2006).
Obese
children
have
about a five times higher risk of developing diabetes
in childhood (Must and Strauss, 1999; Fagot-
Campagna et al., 2000). Hospital discharges of
youths with obesity-related diseases are rising, with
the most frequent comorbidities being asthma and
diabetes (Wang and Dietz, 2002).
A nationally representative study from the USA
showed that obese 18-year-old boys and girls could
expect to live 14 and 19 fewer years, respectively,
without developing diabetes compared with their
normal
weight
classmates
(Cunningham
et
al.,
2011). While life expectancy at age 18 years in the
USA increased considerably between the 1980s and
the 2000s, diabetes-free life expectancy decreased by
1.7 years for men and 1.5 years for women. The
increasing share of life spent with diabetes was due
to the fact that the proportion of 18-year-olds who
would develop diabetes in their lifetime increased by
Obesity and Associated Comorbidities
301
 almost 50% among women and almost doubled
among men. Notably, it was only individuals with
obesity who experienced losses in diabetes-free life ex-
pectancy during this period, estimated at �5.6 years
for men and �2.5 years for women, highlighting the
relevance of obesity as a risk factor with clear and
serious health consequences at the population level
(Cunningham et al., 2011).
Obesity-associated Comorbidities: Cancer
Numerous biological mechanisms have been pro-
posed that may link obesity with a higher risk of
various types of cancer. A new review finds that at
least 13 cancers have sufficient evidence for a
cancer-preventive effect of avoidance of weight gain
(Lauby-Secretan et al., 2016). Systemic mechanisms
that may explain associations across types of cancer
involve excess adiposity and increases in sex steroid
hormones, growth factor production and chronic in-
sulinaemia (Calle and Kaaks, 2004). Furthermore,
adipose tissue acts as an active endocrine organ
that releases various hormones (e.g. adipokines)
involved in energy balance, lipid metabolism and
insulin regulation including leptin, adiponectin,
tumour necrosis factor-a and resistin (Rajala and
Scherer, 2003). In an obese state, these adipokines
are dysregulated, leading to imbalances in metabolic
response and development of conditions such as hy-
perinsulinaemia.
Excess body weight has also been associated with
increased insulin levels, which is associated with risk
of cancers including those of the endometrium, colon
and pancreas (World Cancer Research Fund, 2007).
Insulin itself may promote neoplastic growth, but in-
sulin also promotes the production of insulin-like
growth factor (IGF)-1, which is involved in cell pro-
liferation. Both insulin and IGF-1 have been shown
in vitro to promote cell proliferation and inhibit
apoptosis and enhance metastasis (Ish-Shalom et al.,
1997; Khandwala et al., 2000).
Insulin also has effects on the production and avail-
ability of sex steroid hormones such as androgens,
progesterone and oestrogens in men, women and
dogs. Excess body weight, through the effects of insu-
lin and directly, is associated with the synthesis and
bioavailability of sex steroid hormones. In both men
and women, excess body weight is associated with a
decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG),
a binding protein with a high specific affinity for oes-
tradiol and testosterone (Calle and Kaaks, 2004).
Lower SHBG levels result in increased levels of un-
bound, bioavailable sex hormones. Higher levels of
sex hormones, primarily oestradiol and progesterone,
have been shown to be associated with higher levels of
postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancer;
furthermore, clinical studies have shown that these
hormones play a central role in cell proliferation in
these tissue types (Calle and Kaaks, 2004).
An obese state is also associated with chronic
inflammation that can lead to increased cell prolifer-
ation, inhibit apoptosis and induce angiogenesis
(World Cancer Research Fund, 2007). Chronic in-
flammatory conditions such as Barrett’s oesophagus
or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have been locally
associated with risk of oesophageal cancer and liver
cancer, respectively (World Cancer Research Fund,
2007). Thus, numerous mechanisms, both systemic
and local, may explain the breadth of associations be-
tween obesity and cancer.
The Biological Connection Between Metabolism and Cancer
Alterations in the metabolic pathways of cancer cells
and normal cells have been described and understood
as part of the cancer phenotype for over 100 years. A
recent acceleration in this understanding has come
from novel technology that has allowed for the evalu-
ation of hundreds of metabolites at the same time
within
a
single
experiment
(metabolomics).
A
coherent description of the role of alterations in meta-
bolism and cancer was recently articulated by
Hanahan and Weinberg (2000). In the follow-up to
their millennial description of the ‘hallmarks of can-
cer’ they describe ‘metabolic reprogramming’ of can-
cer cells as an enabling event to the previously defined
hallmarks of cancer, and in so doing, provided a clear
and strong connection between metabolic alterations
in cancer cells and the fundamental features of carci-
nogenesis and the overriding cancer phenotype.
These fundamental features of the cancer phenotype
are shared across species, and as such it is not surpris-
ing that the associations between altered cellular
metabolism and cancer are found in dogs with natu-
rally occurring cancer.
The Warburg Effect
The Warburg Effect describes the observation that
cancer cells have cellular metabolism distinct from
that of normal cells, arguably representing emerging
connections between cancer and metabolism. Specif-
ically, cancer cells generate a greater amount of their
energy from glycolysis, in contrast with normal cells,
which follow distinct pathways for energy production
in anaerobic and aerobic environments. The War-
burg Effect goes further to suggest that this preference
for glycolysis, is a fundamental feature of cancer and a
component of carcinogenesis (Vander Heiden et al.,
2009; Tran et al., 2016).
302
M. Chandler et al.
 Metabolism of Metastasis
Other recent reports have described recurrent differ-
ences in the cellular metabolic profiles of metastatic
cells compared with non-metastatic cells. Briefly,
these data suggest a ‘flexibility metabolism’, which
is distinct from the Warburg Effect, and can be
described by an ability of metastatic cells to generate
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from a variety of
distinct substrates. These findings lend themselves to
an hypothesis of metastasis and cancer that states
that highly metastatic cells utilize a variety of cellular
programmes to overcome harsh cellular conditions
experienced during the metastatic cascade. Indeed,
one of these programmes is the ability to generate
ATP from a variety of substrates and efficiently use
this ATP to overcome stress. The connection between
metastatic proclivity and metabolism has been sug-
gested in both dog and human osteosarcoma.
The Association Between Cancer and Obesity in People
More than 1,000 epidemiological studies have exam-
ined the association between obesity and various
types of cancer. Recently, the International Agency
for Research on Cancer (IARC) reviewed the collec-
tive body of evidence of studies that have examined
body fatness and cancer risk (Lauby-Secretan et al.,
2016). Most studies examined adult BMI, some also
examined waist circumference (Cerhan et al., 2014).
An expert panel concluded that there was sufficient
evidence linking obesity with higher risk of 13 cancer
types including those of the oesophagus (adenocarci-
noma), gastric cardia, colon and rectum, liver, gall-
bladder, pancreas, postmenopausal breast, corpus
uteri, ovary, kidney, meninges (meningioma), thy-
roid and plasma cells (multiple myeloma). The
magnitude of associations ranged from a relative
risk (of the highest BMI category versus normal
BMI) from 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI]
1.0e1.1)
for
thyroid
cancer
to
7.1
(95%
CI
6.3e8.1) for cancer of the corpus uteri. Oesophageal
adenocarcinoma carried a relative risk of 4.8 (95%
CI 3.0e7.7), while all others ranged between 1.1
and 2.0. Limited evidence also exists for cancers of
the male breast, prostate and lymphocytes (diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma). Inadequate evidence existed
for all other sites (Lauby-Secretan et al., 2016).
Cancer Risk Association Studies in Veterinary Medicine
Although it is clear that alterations in cancer cells are
conserved and similar across species, the relationship
between obesity and cancer risk or progression has not
been shown to be as strong in veterinary patients
(most often dogs). For the most part, this can be ex-
plained by the nature and design of epidemiological
studies examining lifestyle risk factors for cancer
development and outcome in veterinary medicine.
These risk association studies have been retrospective
in design and relatively small. As such, they are un-
likely to uncover associations between obesity (most
often clinically characterized as body condition score)
and specific cancer diagnoses. Furthermore, it is
notable that the spectrum of cancer histopathology
commonly seen in dogs does not include those cancers
(i.e. epithelial cancers) where obesity risk associations
have been defined in people. Nonetheless, the shared
environment and lifestyle of pet animals and their hu-
man families has provided a strong rationale to
examine lifestyle and environmental exposures as
risk factors for cancer.
An example of such a risk association study includes
a 1989 investigation of insecticide exposure, obesity
and the risk of bladder disease in dogs. In this study,
the risk of bladder cancer was highest in the obese co-
horts (Glickman et al., 1989). This study identified an
increased and dose-dependent risk for bladder cancer
in dogs living in households where lawn chemicals
were used, and a higher risk in obese dogs with such
exposures, potentially linked to the fat solubility of
these chemical exposures. Similar concerns with
bladder cancer risk and lawn chemical exposure
have been made in human populations.
In a similar cancer association study, the risk of
canine lymphoma was increased in dogs living in
homes with proximity to high-power electrical corri-
dors (Reif et al., 1995). Again, this points to the poten-
tial comparative value of these studies in dogs; similar
concerns have been expressed in human populations
experiencing these environmental and occupational
exposures. In this study, no association was found be-
tween obesity and lymphoma risk. It is reasonable to
ask how routinely body condition scoring (a surrogate
measure of obesity status) is retrievable from a retro-
spective medical record review.
The Value of Prospective Studies in the Dog
Based on the insights and results taken from retro-
spective risk association studies, the fully overlapping
hallmarks of cancer in the dog and man and the
shared environmental and lifestyle exposures for
dogs and people, it is reasonable and likely that pro-
spective studies of such environmental and lifestyle
‘exposures’ on cancer risk in dogs will be highly infor-
mative. Furthermore, after the identification of a risk
association, the opportunity to explore the value and
benefit of prevention interventions will be greatly
enhanced by prospective studies in the dog. These
values include the compressed progression rates of
Obesity and Associated Comorbidities
303
 cancer in dogs compared with people and the oppor-
tunity to collect biological specimens prospectively
from dogs for the validation of biomarkers of expo-
sure and the pharmacodynamics of markers of expo-
sure or response to an intervention (e.g. exercise and
weight loss).
The parallels in the clinical care and oversight of a
prospective cohort of dogs and people will provide sig-
nificant value to the conduct of such a prospective
study. These values have been part of the motivation
behind the first prospective cohort study in dogs.
Launched by the Morris Animal Foundation, the
proposed cohort includes golden retriever dogs, which
are recognized for their high risk of cancer (http://
www.morrisanimalfoundation.org/).
How Stakeholders Can Affect Risk Factors
for Obesity
Over the past several decades, numerous expert
bodies have made recommendations related to popu-
lation or public health strategies for human obesity
prevention by altering risk factors (White House
Task Force on Childhood Obesity, 2010; Institute of
Medicine, 2012). The recommendations from these
groups focus on both diet and physical activity and
the
promotion
of
a
multilevel
approach
that
supports individuals and families needs around
eating better and moving more. Interventions can
be deployed by multiple stakeholders from a variety
of sectors. These can include counselling, education
and community awareness campaigns, incentives,
providing
supportive
organization-level
offerings
such as school and worksite wellness programmes
and community design changes such as zoning policy
that alters community design to support safe walking
and biking (Khan et al., 2009; Institute of Medicine,
2012).
The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
recommends that all people 6 years of age and older
be screened for obesity and that those with a body
mass index of $30 be offered intensive, multicompo-
nent behavioural interventions to address risk factors
(USPSFT, 2010; Moyer, 2012). These interventions
would typically include ‘behavioural management
activities such as setting weight loss goals, improving
diet or nutrition and physical activity and self-
monitoring’.
These
intervention
programmes
are
often located within hospitals, clinics or in community
venues. Thus, doctors and other healthcare providers
have a key role in engaging with individuals about
how excess weight can impact on their health.
Some groups have indicated that healthcare pro-
viders, in addition to their role in the clinical assess-
ment, counselling and treatment of obesity may also
have a role in championing change within their com-
munities (http://obesity.nichq.org/stories/Training%
20a%20New%20Generation%20of%20Advocates).
Examples include promoting safe routes to school and
parks and recreation programmes within communities.
In addition, health professionals and organizations
can play a variety of additional roles in bridging the
clinic and community. For instance, they can connect
families to community-based resources for physical
activity such as trails and/or schools that have shared
use agreements for after hours use. This can be done
through text messages, patient portals, Apps or bro-
chures. Healthcare providers can also ensure their
waiting rooms and clinics are health promoting to
reduce risk, such as by avoiding unhealthy vending
and snack options for clients if any food or beverages
are provided.
The One Health Perspective
Understanding the environmental, genetic and be-
havioural origins of diseases known to be shared across
species can help us improve and expand the tools
available for their prevention and management
(Rijnberk et al., 2003). This is a goal of the One Health
initiative, a movement to forge equal, inclusive collab-
orations between practitioners and researchers work-
ing in human and veterinary healthcare.
The prevalence of, and risk factors for, pet and hu-
man obesity have been well described. The complex
obesity landscape shares attributes of a ‘wicked’ prob-
lem (Ackoff, 1974), in that there is no prescribed way
forward,
it
involves
multiple
stakeholders
with
different perspectives and there is no ‘right’ or
‘optimal’ solution for every family or every commu-
nity; wicked problems cannot be solved with known
methods. A One Health lens on the obesity crisis
can spur innovative and novel approaches by
bringing together engaged groups of people to take
meaningful roles in supporting individuals in promot-
ing their health and the health of their animal com-
panions, and to support community offerings for
eating better and moving more.
Cross-species data will be critical to moving to-
wards these goals, yet such data are currently sparse.
Prospective studies might further explore the associ-
ations between obesity and feline diabetes mellitus or
canine cancer. One relatively easy step towards
developing data for research could be to add as few
as one to three questions about pet companionship
and pet health to ongoing, nationally representative
datasets on human health. Another step could be
to develop a number of primary data collection
sites, with sampling at pet adoption centres or veter-
inary
clinics,
where
people
and
their
animal
304
M. Chandler et al.
 companions could be recruited, basic health infor-
mation collected, and then followed over time.
New data collection such as this would allow us to
move beyond parallel descriptions and add informa-
tion on how the health of people and animals living
together is correlated and how health can be
improved in both simultaneously.
