Context: Evidence from recent decades supports a causal association between air pollution (par-
ticulate matter �10 �m in diameter [PM10] and PM �2.5 �m in diameter [PM2.5]) and oxidative
stress, possibly involving impaired metabolism of glucose and lipids.
Objective: Using a satellite based model to assess PM exposure at 1-km spatial resolution, we
examined the associations between PM and glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and lipids.
Design: Population-based retrospective cohort study of a 10-year period.
Setting: Members of the largest health care provider in Southern Israel.
Participants: We included all serum glucose, HbA1c, and lipids tests of subjects with known car-
diovascular diseases and risk factors. Subjects’ glycemic status was defined as normal or diabetes.
Main Outcome: Log-transformed glucose, HbA1c, and lipid values were explored by mixed models,
with adjustment for personal and seasonal confounders.
Results: We assessed 73 117 subjects with over 600 000 samples. Three-month average concentra-
tion of PM10, but not 1- to 7-d exposure, was associated with increases of serum glucose, HbA1c,
low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides, and decrease of high-density lipoprotein. The strongest
associations were observed among subjects with diabetes (percent increase [95% confidence in-
terval], for interquartile range increase of PM10 and PM2.5): 3.58% (1.03%; 6.20%) and 2.93%
(0.35%; 5.59%) increase in HbA1c and 2.37% (2.11%; 2.63%) and 1.54% (1.26%; 1.83%) increase
in low-density lipoprotein. Antidiabetic medications (other than insulin) attenuated the air pol-
lution effect on serum glucose.
Conclusions: Intermediate-term, but not short term, exposure to PM is associated with alterations
in glucose, HbA1c, and lipids, especially among people with diabetes. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 101:
2460–2467, 2016)
P
articulate matter (PM) is one of the leading risk factors
for global disease burden (1). Cardiovascular, respi-
ratory, and metabolic effects of air pollution have already
been documented in several studies (2, 3). Evidence from
recent decades supports a causal association between ex-
posure to PM less than 10 �m in diameter (PM10) and PM
less than 2.5 �m in diameter (PM2.5) and oxidative stress
(4), which may explain the association with an increased
risk for cardiovascular morbidity (2, 5). Several biological
pathwayswereproposed,amongthem:atherosclerosisac-
celeration (6), coagulation changes (7) and blood cells re-
sponse (8), the development of dysfunctional high-density

 lipoprotein (HDL) with impaired capacity to provide an-
tioxidant protection (9), and endothelial dysfunction and
vasoconstriction (10). The latter is supported by the evi-
dence that the exposure to higher concentration of diesel
exhaust particles reduces the endothelial relaxation
evoked by nitric oxide, suggesting a direct effect of diesel
exhaust particles on smooth muscles relaxation, mediated
by the nitric oxide reduction (11).
Impaired metabolism of glucose and lipids associated
with PM exposure and mediated by insulin resistance (IR)
(12–14) contributes to the development of the cardiovas-
cular disease. A recent animal study showed that mice who
were exposed to PM2.5 for 10 weeks displayed impaired
hepatic glycogen storage, glucose intolerance, and IR (12).
In another study, mice who were exposed to PM2.5 for 10
weeks exhibited a reduced plasma HDL level and in-
creased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, free ox-
idized fatty acids, and triglycerides (15). However, current
knowledge of the association of PM exposure and glucose
metabolism (13, 16, 17), IR (18), hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) levels (13, 16), or lipids (16, 19) levels in human
studies, is scarce. Moreover, spatial estimates of particle
exposure are imprecise and create exposure measurement
errors (20). Furthermore, most previous studies tend to
focus on the association between the acute exposure and
clinical/laboratory outcomes.
PM exposure is a major issue in countries located in
desert areas. In Eastern Asia, the frequent dust events,
which originate in the Chinese and Mongolian desert, in
combination with the anthropogenic air pollution, have
become a major concern for public health (21). Studies
conducted in Asia has linked between dust exposure and
asthma episodes (21), mortality (22), blood pressure, se-
rumlipids,andglucose(13).If,asthisstudysuggests,these
high particle levels are also increasing IR, they may accel-
erate the already increasing levels of diabetes in those
countries.
The Negev region (Southern Israel) is located in the
global dust belt, which extends from West Africa to
the Arabian Desert. PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in the
area can reach extremely high levels (23). In a recent study,
which included real-time measurements of PM10 and
PM2.5 levels measured simultaneously in outdoor and in-
door air during dust events in the Negev, the observed
average outdoor concentrations for PM10 and PM2.5
reached 551 and 299 �g/m3, respectively. Indoor levels
weresimilar(517and282�g/m3,respectively),suggesting
high pollution infiltration into the houses (24).
We have recently presented a new method of assessing
spatiotemporal resolved PM2.5 and PM10 exposures in the
Negev (25). In contrast to many commonly used exposure
models, our model makes use of satellite Aerosol Optical
Depth (AOD) measurements as well as land use terms,
which allow us to estimate spatially resolved PM10 on a
daily basis across Israel and include populations in rural
areas not living nearby monitoring stations.
As a part of the possible theory linking the association
of PM exposure and cardiovascular diseases, we sought to
investigate if this association might be mediated through
the well-established cardiovascular risk factors such as
abnormal lipid and glucose metabolism. We make use of
the aforementioned model, and rich individual clinical
and sociodemographic data from over 70 000 partici-
pants and 600 000 blood samples. Across 10 years of fol-
low-up, we aim to investigate the effects of both short- and
intermediate-term exposure to PM on serum glucose,
HbA1c, triglycerides, HDL, and LDL.
Materials and Methods
Study population
The study population comprised adult subjects residing in
Southern Israel between the years 2003 and 2012 and diagnosed
with one of the following: stroke, ischemic heart disease, dys-
lipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or being known smokers. We
included all glucose, HbA1c, and lipids samples of subjects with
available geocoded addresses, insured by Clalit Health Services.
Clalit Health Services is the largest health care provider in the
area, covering approximately 70% of a population of 730 000
residents in the Negev.
All blood tests were performed between 7 and 10 AM in the
primary clinics in Southern Israel and were analyzed by a single
laboratory, located in Soroka University Medical Center. Pa-
tients scheduled to undergo the aforementioned tests are rou-
tinely guided to fast 8 hours before a glucose test and 12 hours
before lipids test. Computerized individual demographic, clini-
cal, laboratory, and medication prescription data were fully
available. We obtained the following patient data: age, gender,
ethnicity, comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), smoking sta-
tus, medications, and socioeconomic status (SES). SES was as-
signed based on the subjects’ home address and stratified ac-
cording to the definitions of the Central Bureau of Statistics
assigning SES level in a scale of 1–10 (26).
We excluded children (under 18 y of age), and patients whose
blood tests were performed in the presence of a known acute
illness (ie, tests performed during hospitalization or tests per-
formed in primary clinics with additional test result of white
blood cells count higher above 10 800 mm�3).
Clinical definitions
Study groups
Diabetes diagnosis was established in the presence of one of
the following: physician confirmed diagnosis, antidiabetic med-
ication purchase between the years 2003 and 2013, and 2 or
more measurement of fasting glucose more than or equal to 126
mg/dL or HbA1c more than 6.5% (27). In the event of multiple
tests available, patient meeting diabetes criteria once during the

 study period was assigned to diabetes group for the entire study
period.
Air pollution and meteorological data
PM10 and PM2.5 daily average concentrations were estimated
using a hybrid satellite based model incorporating daily satellite
remote sensing data at 1 � 1-km spatial resolution (28). Briefly,
we use an algorithm developed by NASA-Multi-Angle Imple-
mentation to Atmospheric Correction (29), which provides
AOD data at a high resolution. We then used mixed models to
regress daily PM10 (or PM2.5) mass concentration from the Min-
istry of Environmental Protection monitors against: AOD, tra-
ditional land use regression terms, and temporal predictors.
When AOD were not available, we fitted a generalized additive
model using nearby monitors and a thin plate spline term of
latitude and longitude to interpolate PM10/2.5 estimates. Good
model performance was achieved, with out-of-sample cross val-
idation R2 values of 0.79 and 0.72 for PM10 and PM2.5, respec-
tively. Model predictions had little bias, with cross-validated
slopes (predicted vs observed) of 0.99 for both models. Exposure
estimates were assigned for each patient based on his/her geo-
coded home address. Further details have been previously pub-
lished (28).
Daily data on air temperature and relative humidity for the
study period were obtained from the monitoring site located in
the center of the largest city in Southern Israel.
Statistical analysis
Results are presented by mean � SD and interquartile range
(IQR)forcontinuousvariablesandaspercentagesforcategorical
data. Log-transformed glucose and lipid values were modeled by
mixed models with random intercepts for each participant. We
modeled the associations with PM10 and PM2.5 separately. Each
model was adjusted for personal characteristics (age, gender,
SES, BMI, smoking status, diabetes status, and the purchase of
antidiabetic medications 3 mo before the test), seasons, year, and
moving average of temperature and relative humidity. When
examining the association with blood lipids, models were ad-
justed for the purchase of lipid modifying agents 3 months before
the test.
Coefficients were antilog transformed to the original units,
and results are presented as percent change in the outcome and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for increases of IQR of the
pollutants.
Serum HbA1c
HbA1c levels were available for 12.76% of the patients di-
agnosed with diabetes. To avoid selection bias, due to the avail-
ably of the HbA1c results only in this group, we used stabilized
inverse probability weights. Probabilities of having a test were
modeled accounting for the subjects’ age, gender, ethnicity, SES,
cardiovascular illness, dyslipidemia, and the purchase of antidi-
abetic drugs.
Exposure windows
For the associations with glucose and lipids, we have a
priori defined short-term exposure periods to PM10 or PM2.5
as 1-day, 2- to 3-day, and 1-week moving average concentra-
tions preceding the laboratory test. Because HbA1c levels re-
flect the mean serum glucose levels over approximately 3
months, short-term exposure to PM was not linked to HbA1c
levels. We used a 3-month moving average of the PM10 or
PM2.5 pollutants concentrations to define an intermediate-
term exposure. Intermediate-term exposure, for the associa-
tion with glucose and lipids, was defined as 3-month moving
average concentrations preceding the laboratory test to match
the period with a glucose control time interval reflected in
HbA1c.
Stratified analyses
In a subgroup analysis we repeated the analysis among
subjects with and without diabetes separately. We addition-
ally stratified the tests performed by patients with diabetes
by the type of treatment: no medications, insulin, metformin,
or other antidiabetic drugs (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
agonists, inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase 4, �-glucosidaze
inhibitor, sulfonylurea, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones).
Analyses were performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc) and
R3.1.0 software.
Results
We included 73 117 subjects with 618 483 glucose sam-
ples, 480 669 LDL samples, 473 551 HDL samples, and
476 556 triglycerides and 4179 HbA1c samples per-
formed between the years 2003 and 2012. The median
and IQR of samples per subject were: 7 (3; 12) for glu-
cose, 5 (2; 10) for lipids, and 1 (1; 1) for HbA1c tests.
Subjects with diabetes comprised 36% of the study co-

 During the study period, the IQR of the mean daily
temperature ranged between 14.60°C and 25.10°C,
reaching maximal mean temperature of 33.48°C. The
IQR of relative humidity ranged between 59% and 77%.
Three-month moving average of PM10 and PM2.5 levels in
the study period ranged between 3.4 and 244.4 �g/m3
(mean, 54.08 �g/m3) and between 8.8 and 87.1 �g/m3
(mean, 22.3 �g/m3), respectively.
The association between PM exposure, glucose,
and lipids; short- and intermediate-term effects
We observed no association or negligible associations
between acute exposures to PM10 (1 d before the blood
test) and glucose (% [95%CI]: 0.03% increase [0.003%;
0.057%]), LDL (0.03% increase [0.01%; 0.06%]), trig-
lycerides (0.00% decrease [�0.04%; 0.03%]), and HDL
(0.01%decrease[�0.02%;0.00%]).Theassociationsob-
served with PM2.5 and the associations observed with 2-
and 3-day and 1-week average concentrations of the pol-
lutants were similar.
When assessing the effect of intermediate-term expo-
sure (3-mo average concentration of PM10 and PM2.5), we
found 0.30% (0.153%; 0.452%) and 0.02% (�0.12%;
0.18%) increases in glucose, 2.32% (2.15%; 2.49%) and
1.42% (1.23%; 1.60%) increases in LDL, 0.23% (0.02%;
0.42%) and 0.37% (0.14%; 0.59%)
increases in triglycerides, and 1.13%
(�1.23%; �1.03%) and 1.30%
(�1.40%; �1.19%) decreases in
HDL (Figure 1).
Stratified analyses
Diabetes
We observed statistically signif-
icant interaction between PM10
exposure and diabetes, in the asso-
ciation with glucose, HDL, and
triglycerides (P � .05), and be-
tween PM2.5 exposure and diabetes
in the association with HDL (P �
.05). Nearly significant interaction
was observed between PM10 and
PM2.5 exposure and diabetes in the
association with LDL (P � .080 for
both comparison). We therefore re-
peated the analysis with stratifica-
tion by diabetes status in order to
assess modification of the associa-
tion between the intermediate ex-
posure to PM and glucose or lipids
levels. In both groups, IQR in-
creases of 3-month average concen-
tration of PM10 and PM2.5 were as-
sociated with increases of serum glucose, HbA1c, LDL,
and triglycerides and decreases of HDL. The strongest
associations were observed among subjects with diabe-
tes (percent increase [95% CI], for IQR increase of
PM10 and PM2.5): 3.58% (1.03%; 6.20%) and 2.93%
(0.35%; 5.59%) increase in HbA1c, and 2.37%
(2.11%; 2.63%) and 1.54% (1.26%; 1.83%) increase
in LDL. Among subjects without diabetes IQR increases
in 3-month average concentration of PM10 and PM2.5
were associated with 2.28% (2.05%; 2.50%) and
1.28% (1.03%; 1.52%) increases in LDL. The associ-
ations with glucose and triglycerides were weaker com-
pared with those observed among subjects with diabetes
(Table 2).
No significant associations were observed with PM10
or PM2.5 concentrations 1–7 days before the test.
Type of treatment
Toevaluatepossiblemodificationbythetypeoftreatment
among subjects with diabetes, we compared the percent
change in serum glucose among patients treated only with
insulin, only with metformin or only with any other an-
tidiabetic drug, and patients who are not treated with an-

patients treated with metformin, whereas no association
was observed among patients treated with other medica-
tions. No statistically significant interaction with PM2.5
was observed in both groups. Stronger effect estimates
were observed among patients treated with Insulin (%
[95% CI]: 1.47% increase [�0.37%; 3.36%] and 1.13%
increase [�0.72%; 3.03%], respectively) and among un-
treated patients (0.86% increase [0.52%; 1.20%] and

Air Pollution, Glucose, and Lipids Levels
J Clin Endocrinol Metab, June 2016, 101(6):2460–2467

 ciations found among patient treated with antidiabetic
medications (other than insulin) suggest that these medi-
cations have a protective effect against the air pollution
induced changes in serum glucose. We found no acute
effect of PM (exposure of 1–7 d) on any of the parameters
measured.
Short- and intermediate-term effects
In accordance with previous studies, we found positive
associations with serum glucose and lipids (13, 16, 17).

ciations with exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 up to 6 days
before the test, did not assess the possible intermediate-
term effect of the pollutants (13, 17). Chuang et al, who
did assess the association with annual average concentra-
tions of PM10 and PM2.5, concluded that long-term ex-
posure is associated with increases of serum glucose,
HbA1c, and total cholesterol (16).
Similar to the current study, a previous study per-
formed in the Negev revealed no effect of short-term ex-
posure to PM10 on serum glucose levels. In addition, no
association between 3-month average concentrations of
PM10 and HbA1c was found in the aforementioned study
(30). Using spatially resolved satellite-based estimates, in
the current study, we were able to identify the associations
between the tested markers and PM10 or PM2.5 interme-
diate-term exposures.
PM can generate oxidative stress and systemic inflam-
mation,whichmaybethemechanismbywhichitmaylead
to IR, and modify glucose and lipids metabolism (12, 15).
Modification of the effect by the glycemic status
and the type of treatment
Several studies found patients with diabetes to be
more susceptible to the air pollution effect (17, 31, 32).
Current evidence suggests that inflammatory and coag-
ulation mechanisms, resulting in IR and vascular dys-
function, contribute to the vulnerability of these pa-
tients (31).
Similar to a previous study performed among the
Negev population, we found stronger associations with
air pollution exposure among patients with diabetes,
with the exception of patients who were treated with
metformin. This association may be explained by the
enhanced antiinflammatory response occurring after
the treatment of insulin sensitizers (eg, metformin),
which may increase the resistance to the air pollution
effect (33). That said, due to the weaker associations
observed among patients who were treated with other
antidiabetic medications as well, it is possible that other
common characteristic of the treated patients, who are
not insulin dependents, made them less vulnerable to the
air pollution effect.
Health implications
As seen in many environmental studies, the health
effects reported in our study are relatively small. Yet,
when applied to large populations the overall effect,
impairing glucose and lipids levels, can be translated
into adverse health outcomes (34). In addition, when
addressing health implications of environmental expo-
sures, both the broad extent of exposed population and
the continuous nature of exposure must be considered,
beyond the individual risk (35).
Although genetics play a major role in the develop-
ment of diabetes, recent studies linked between air pol-
lution exposure and the development of diabetes (34)
and diabetes-related deaths (36). Small differences in
the glycemic control and glucose even within the normal
range are translated into the clinically meaningful vari-
ation in cardiovascular disease risk (37).
High LDL, high triglycerides, and low HDL are well-
established risk factors for coronary heart disease (38,
39). Several major trials provide robust evidence that
lowering LDL cholesterol by a small amount of approx-
imately 1 mmol/L leads to a reduction in vascular mor-
tality and morbidity by 25% in a diverse range of pa-
tients treated with statins (40). In a cumulative lifetime
exposure to air pollution, the increases of LDL and trig-
lycerides and decreases of HDL may increase the risk of
the development of cardiovascular events.
Limitations
Our study had a number of limitations. First, the
study population comprises mostly unhealthy subjects.
Although this limitation may decrease generalizability
of findings it also strengthens the validity of our findings
by reducing comorbidities confounding by design (41).
Second, the use of medications and laboratory results
for diabetes definition might have resulted in misclas-
sification in study group assignment. However, the
completeness of the medical and laboratory data and
the use of spatial estimates of PM in a high resolution of
1 � 1 km markedly decrease the potential exposure and
outcome misclassifications. Lastly, HbA1c was avail-
able only for 12.76% of the patients with diabetes in our
sample. We used stabilized inverse probability weights
to reduce selection bias, but bias may still be present. In
addition, given the small amount of HbA1c tests we
were not able to stratify the association between PM
and HbA1c by the type of treatment.

 Conclusion
Intermediate-term, but not short-term, exposure to
PM is associated with alterations in serum glucose,
HbA1c, and lipids, especially among patients with di-
abetes. Metformin and antidiabetic medications other
than insulin seem to attenuate the association between
air pollution and serum glucose increase.
