Simple rules for evidence translation in
complex systems: A qualitative study
Julie E. Reed*, Cathy Howe, Cathal Doyle and Derek Bell
Abstract
Background: Ensuring patients benefit from the latest medical and technical advances remains a major challenge,
with rational-linear and reductionist approaches to translating evidence into practice proving inefficient and
ineffective. Complexity thinking, which emphasises interconnectedness and unpredictability, offers insights to
inform evidence translation theories and strategies. Drawing on detailed insights into complex micro-systems, this
research aimed to advance empirical and theoretical understanding of the reality of making and sustaining
improvements in complex healthcare systems.
Methods: Using analytical auto-ethnography, including documentary analysis and literature review, we assimilated
learning from 5 years of observation of 22 evidence translation projects (UK). We used a grounded theory approach to
develop substantive theory and a conceptual framework. Results were interpreted using complexity theory and ‘simple
rules’ were identified reflecting the practical strategies that enhanced project progress.
Results: The framework for Successful Healthcare Improvement From Translating Evidence in complex systems (SHIFT-
Evidence) positions the challenge of evidence translation within the dynamic context of the health system. SHIFT-Evidence is
summarised by three strategic principles, namely (1) ‘act scientifically and pragmatically’ – knowledge of existing evidence
needs to be combined with knowledge of the unique initial conditions of a system, and interventions need to adapt as the
complex system responds and learning emerges about unpredictable effects; (2) ‘embrace complexity’ – evidence-based
interventions only work if related practices and processes of care within the complex system are functional, and evidence-
translation efforts need to identify and address any problems with usual care, recognising that this typically includes a range
of interdependent parts of the system; and (3) ‘engage and empower’ – evidence translation and system navigation requires
commitment and insights from staff and patients with experience of the local system, and changes need to align with their
motivations and concerns. Twelve associated ‘simple rules’ are presented to provide actionable guidance to support
evidence translation and improvement in complex systems.
Conclusion: By recognising how agency, interconnectedness and unpredictability influences evidence translation in
complex systems, SHIFT-Evidence provides a tool to guide practice and research. The ‘simple rules’ have potential to provide
a common platform for academics, practitioners, patients and policymakers to collaborate when intervening to achieve
improvements in healthcare.

 Background
There is an urgent need to improve the delivery of high
quality healthcare, including the need to improve patient
safety and reduce harm [1–3], to ensure care is patient
centred and compassionate [4, 5], to improve health and
wellbeing [6], and to reduce inequalities at the local, re-
gional, national and global scale [7–9], all within an increas-
ingly constrained financial environment [10, 11].
To address these challenges, there is a need to bridge
the gap between the production of research evidence
and the consistent delivery of evidence-based care in
routine practice [12–15]. There is growing acknowledge-
ment that translation of evidence is often ineffective and
inefficient, and there is a need to develop a scientific and
practical understanding of how to implement evidence
into practice and achieve fast and reliable improvements
in care [16–18].
Traditional approaches to translating evidence into
practice have taken a rational-linear approach (where
knowledge is created by one set of experts and passed on
to another set to be implemented) [19, 20]. Evaluations
have focused on identifying simple causal relationships be-
tween interventions and outcomes, aiming to produce
generalisable knowledge about what works [16]. To estab-
lish causal relationships, studies tend to be conducted in
controlled environments, where interference from context
variables is considered problematic and controlled for by
randomisation and protocol design [17].
It is increasingly recognised that context matters;
having an ‘appropriate’ context can support an inter-
vention
achieve
its
outcome
[21].
Approaches
to
translating evidence into practice have taken an inter-
est in how interventions can be adapted to work in
different settings [22, 23], and many researchers have
turned to realist evaluations in an attempt to under-
stand ‘what works, for whom, in what settings’ and
establish more nuanced and caveated causal state-
ments [21, 24].
When
designing
intervention
and
implementation
strategies, as well as when conducting rigorous evalua-
tions, there is a tendency to reduce messy real world sit-
uations into the individual component parts in an
attempt to determine the relationships between them.
Doing so risks overlooking the complex and intricate
patterns that emerge from their interactions.
Complexity sciences provide an alternative approach
to studying interventions in complex systems such as
healthcare. Complexity science originated in physical
chemistry as a ‘push-back’ against traditional reduc-
tionist approaches [25]. Put simply, life is more than
molecules and atoms – it is the complex patterns of
organisation
that
emerge
between
them
[26,
27].
Similarly, it has been proposed that healthcare can be
considered as a complex system [28, 29] (or complex
adaptive system) [30, 31], with the whole being more
than simply the sum of its parts. On their own, the
professionals, equipment and devices in any health-
care setting achieve nothing; it is the interactions be-
tween them, and with patients, that result in the
delivery of care.
Complex systems are characterised as a dynamic
network of agents acting in parallel, constantly react-
ing to what the other agents are doing, which in turn
influences the behaviour of the network as a whole
[32]. The interconnected nature of their interactions
can
lead
to
uncertainty
and
surprise
as
systems
self-organise and evolve over time in response to
internal and external stimuli and feedback loops [28, 33].
This non-linearity means that complex systems can defy
orchestrated intervention, wherein seemingly obvious
solutions can have minimal impact on system behaviour
(e.g. policy resistance) [34], whilst small changes can have
big unanticipated consequences. Such systems have strong
historical path dependencies, meaning that initial condi-
tions are influenced by historic events and patterns, and
that they can markedly influence what happens in the
future.
On the one hand, complex systems are highly dy-
namic, continually responding and adapting to in-
ternal and external stimuli. While, on the other, they
can demonstrate inertia where embedded behaviours
remain unchanged and even temporary perturbations
or major structural alterations can fail to disrupt
existing norms [34, 35]. From these unpredictable
and evolving systems emerge patterns, behaviours,
structures and routines which define the system and
guide
behaviours
within
it
[33,
36].
Complexity
theorists propose that ‘simple rules’ offer a means of
understanding and managaing the emergent behav-
iour of complex systems [26, 34].
The use of complexity science as a lens to under-
stand healthcare systems is increasing [36]. To date,
research studies have predominantly focused on de-
scribing healthcare systems as complex, yet there is
less understanding of how to predict or intervene
[37]. Advances have tended to be theoretical with the
purpose of guiding evaluations or further research
[38, 39]. Whilst there is an increased use of the term
complexity, there is little evidence that the concepts
of complex systems have been applied to the design
of interventions or implementation strategies [40]. As
such, Braithwaite et al. [36] have called for a greater
clarity about how to study and apply the principles of
complex systems in practice.
This study aims to develop a deeper explanation of
evidence translation in healthcare using a complex
systems lens, thereby contributing to both the fields
of implementation science and complexity science.

 Drawing on detailed insights into complex micro-systems,
this research advances empirical and theoretical understand-
ing. A primary focus is given to understanding the implica-
tions of complexity theory with an objective of identifying a
series of ‘simple rules’ about how to intervene in complex
systems. The ‘simple rules’ aim to make complexity navigable
(whilst recognising that it will never be simple), providing ac-
tionable guidance to both practice and research.
Methods
Study design
The study was conducted using an analytical auto-ethnography
and grounded theory approach (Fig. 1). An analytical
auto-ethnographic
approach was adopted reflecting
that the authors of this paper were full members of
the research setting (conducting ethnography of ‘our
own people’ as members of the "core team" (Fig. 1)),
visible as such a member in published texts, and
committed to developing theoretical understandings
of broader social phenomena [41].
Empirical data was collected through participant obser-
vation and document analysis of the National Institute of
Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in
Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC), Northwest
London (NWL) programme (UK), and 22 evidence trans-
lation projects (Additional file 1). This allowed direct ac-
cess to and observation of actions, events, scenes and
people in real-time over a 5-year period, with opportun-
ities to follow-up on emergent patterns and problems.
Concurrently, extensive literature was reviewed using a
snowballing approach to identify frameworks, models, sys-
tematic reviews and other relevant literature (further de-
tails on data collection and literature review can be found
in Additional file 2).
A grounded theory approach guided the data collection
and analysis [42, 43]. Data was analysed using open, axial
and selective coding, in parallel with theoretical sampling,
to explore emergent categories and themes over time.
This iterative analysis led to a process of ‘abduction’ to
make
sense
of
material
that
did
not
‘fit’
into
pre-established categories (including published frame-
works and theories), thereby reconceptualising the chal-
lenge of evidence translation and improvement into a new
substantive theory (to provide explanations and predic-
tions related to the specific context of study) and concep-
tual framework (indicating how aspects of the theory are

 connected to each other). Further details are provided in
Additional files 2 and 3.
This exploratory research approach was chosen to en-
sure that the resulting findings were empirically informed
and theoretically grounded in the practical reality of evi-
dence translation and improvement in real world (com-
plex) settings. We chose not to build exclusively on any
existing theories as no single existing framework fit well
with our experiences. Whilst several fields of study were
relevant, no single frameworks brought together concepts
from different fields, including knowledge translation, im-
plementation, improvement and complexity.
Results from the grounded theory analysis were inter-
preted through complex systems thinking [26, 28, 34,
35]. Emphasis was placed on developing a series of ‘sim-
ple rules’
, which were identified through establishing re-
lationships
between
challenges
experienced
by
the
project teams, and the actions and strategies that, if
taken, had a positive effect on project progress and out-
comes or, if they were absent or overlooked, were ob-
served to have a detrimental impact.
Setting
The NIHR established the CLAHRC programme in
England to accelerate the translation of evidence into
practice for the benefit of patients. Thirteen regional
CLAHRC programmes were funded, each led by aca-
demic and healthcare partnerships and with autonomy
to decide how they would approach ‘closing’ the transla-
tional gap [44–46].
The CLAHRC NWL approach brought together health-
care staff, including clinical, managerial and support staff
(hereafter referred to as ‘staff’) with patients, carers, family
members and the wider community (hereafter, ‘patients’)
and academic partners from a diverse range of disciplines
(hereafter,‘academics’) into project teams of 5–15 people to
translate
evidence
into
practice
in
their
local
micro-systems. Project teams used a suite of quality im-
provement tools and methods, including the model for im-
provement, action-effect diagrams and plan-do-study-act
cycles, process mapping, statistical process control, stake-
holder engagement, and patient and public involvement
combined with iterative evaluation, to guide and support
the implementation process [47–51].
During the first 5 years of the CLAHRC NWL
(2008–2013), 22 diverse topics considered of clinical
importance were explored with 55 teams over four
rounds of 18-month projects (Fig. 1) in various settings
(acute, community, primary care, mental health, etc.)
(Additional file 1). All projects had a common goal of trans-
lating existing evidence into practice to achieve improve-
ments in quality of care provision, with the aspiration of
delivering
corresponding
improvements
in
patient
outcomes. Two detailed case study examples are presented
in the results section (Boxes 1 and 2).
This paper represents a consolidation of cross-project
learning from the programme and peer-reviewed litera-
ture. Existing publications relating to evaluation of indi-
vidual projects, cross-project analysis, use of quality
improvement approaches, and external programme eval-
uations are listed in Additional file 1.
Results
Results are divided into two sections. Firstly, the new
conceptual framework Successful Healthcare Improve-
ments
From
Translation
of
Evidence
into
practice
(SHIFT-Evidence) is presented, introducing the three
strategic principles of the framework, namely ‘act scien-
tifically and pragmatically’
, ‘embrace complexity’ and ‘en-
gage and empower’
, and the 12 ‘simple rules’.
Secondly, there is a detailed presentation of the 12
‘simple rules’ and accompanying substantive theory. The
results demonstrate how the theory and rules emerged
from the empirical data and how understanding is en-
hanced by application of a complex systems lens. The
presentation of the rules and substantive theory is ac-
companied
by two
illustrative
case examples
from
CLAHRC NWL projects to bring to life the practical
reality of evidence translation.
A conceptual framework for SHIFT-Evidence
The theory of SHIFT-Evidence can be summarised as
follows: to achieve successful improvements from evi-
dence translation in healthcare, it is necessary to ‘act sci-
entifically
and
pragmatically’
whilst
‘embracing
the
complexity’ of the setting in which change takes place
and ‘engaging and empowering’ those responsible for
and affected by the change.
SHIFT-Evidence reflects the nature of work
and
breadth of effort required to translate evidence into
complex systems. The findings revealed that attention
and effort was often drawn away from the original
project focus in directions that were not anticipated in
advance, such as dependent issues relating to people,
processes or structures, or to resolve existing problems
with ‘usual care’. We established that failure to resolve
these issues compromised the success of an intervention
and diminished the ability to draw useful conclusions
about
the
effectiveness
of
any
intervention
in
a
real-world setting. As such, the SHIFT-Evidence frame-
work is conceptually based on the premise that the im-
plementation of evidence-based interventions is not
necessarily sufficient to achieve improvements in care,
and that it is not possible to fully anticipate what
changes will be required in any individual setting. In
short, evidence translation and wider systems improve-
ment are inextricably linked within complex systems.

 Box 1: A project narrative of evidence translation for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)
This 18-month Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) North West London (NWL) project aimed to improve the
timeliness and effectiveness of initial treatment of CAP during emergency hospital admission in order to improve patient outcomes and experience.
Outline of problem (primarily explored during months 0–6)
�
Evidence-based treatment for CAP was identified by the project team through a review of the 137 national guideline
recommendations [106]. Core recommendations requiring completion within 4 h of a patient arriving at hospital included oxygen
assessment and treatment, measuring pneumonia severity and providing appropriate antibiotics.
�
The project leads believed all clinicians were aware of the treatment guidelines. Doctors agreed they knew the evidence and were
confident that they and their clinical teams were delivering high-quality evidence-based care; thus, the project was considered
unnecessary by many senior clinicians.
�
A baseline audit of local practice showed 0% of patients received all evidence-based care elements, with compliance ranging
from 13% to 90% for the individual elements. Further investigation revealed that junior doctors’ awareness of evidence was
lower than expected, and that doctors, pharmacists and nurses needed to coordinate their work within the few first hours of
hospital admission.
Initial solutions (tested and implemented during months 7–18)
�
An intervention was developed grouping the evidence-based care elements onto a single page paper-based ‘care bundle’ [107–109],
designed to prompt action for all staff, including junior doctors, and coordinate care between professionals.
�
The team collected weekly data on the extent to which each care element was delivered within 4 h. Following the initial
implementation, low compliance persisted with < 5% of patients receiving all elements.
�
To address poor uptake, the bundle was iterated 15 times over 12 months until the design and content was accepted by
different clinical groups, the wording was clarified and the bundle deemed compatible with other usual care and
documentation practices.
�
During this initial phase it emerged that improvements needed to be addressed in the wider system, including updating oxygen and
antibiotic prescribing policies and the lack of a process for ordering appropriate microbiological tests. Review of patient data also
raised concerns about the accuracy of the initial diagnosis of CAP at first assessment.
�
Four other sites across NWL engaged with the programme to adopt the CAP care bundle (cross site engagement started at
month 12 of the original timeline, and continued for a further 18 months). New sites were motivated by data showing the
care bundle improved delivery of evidence-based care but all spent several months appraising the evidence and intervention
against their local experiences, knowledge, system and context before implementation commenced.
Key learning about complexity
�
Coordinated solutions were required that involved different professions working with senior executives to change policies and
overcome barriers. These actions, combined with better staff education and awareness of CAP and the care bundle, improved
delivery of timely care.
�
Despite initial success, many factors continued to threaten sustained success on the original site. Regular review of compliance data
enabled factors causing variation to be identified and addressed. For example, when measures showed a sudden drop in compliance,
the original team investigated and identified junior doctors’ rotation as a contributing factor. They devised ways to improve junior
doctor training and awareness at induction.
�
Staff from different sites met together and learned that their challenges were common. Much of the knowledge shared was tacit,
and passed on through discussions rather than written or formalised knowledge exchange.
�
Other sites experienced similar factors to the original site that influenced their sustained success, including staff turnover and the
emergence of conflicting organisational improvement priorities.

 The accumulating data about the ‘daily realities’ of evi-
dence translation and improvement required us to
reconceptualise our understanding of the problem, and
associated potential solutions. Our focus moved from
evidence-based medicine and interventions, to focusing
on the complexity of the systems within which we hoped
to intervene. As such, literature relating to complex sys-
tems thinking grew in importance over time to become
the primary lens by which we were able to make sense
of our experiences (further details on this process of
reconceptualisation are provided in Additional file 2).
Reflecting this reconceptualisation, ‘act scientifically
and pragmatically’ was identified as the core category for
selective coding. It was chosen to reflect the interaction
between our starting world view (the need to use scien-
tific evidence) and our core learning (the need to under-
stand and respond to the constraints and opportunities
of the local system). Our analysis indicated the tension
between these perspectives, and also the opportunity for
increased synergy between them, as follows:
� An underlying tension was observed in the literature
and in our empirical data between the production
and use of generalisable knowledge (influenced by
positivist and realist philosophical perspectives) and
local context-specific problem solving (influenced by
pragmatist and participatory philosophical
perspectives).
� We recognised the value of drawing insights from
both perspectives. Effective improvement initiatives
can benefit from drawing on a scientific knowledge
base (evidence-based medicine, or other knowledge
of effective interventions or change processes), and
from making pragmatic adjustments in line with the
opportunities and constraints of the actual setting
for the change.
� The change process can be guided by applying
aspects of the scientific method at a local level so
that clear aims and measures guide structured
experimental processes to assess, learn and inform
next steps. This resonates with the pragmatist
notion of science to solve local problems of societal
importance [52], and with the complexity literature
notion of the “science of muddling through” in
dynamic and evolving systems [53].
Two further important key categories were identified,
namely ‘embrace complexity’ and ‘engage and empower’.
These three high level conceptual categories are termed
strategic principles, reflecting the guidance on how to
conduct and research evidence translation and improve-
ment in complex systems. These principles are under-
pinned by 12 associated ‘simple rules’
, which describe the
actions required to achieve each strategic principle.
The three strategic principles and 12 ‘simple rules’ are
the following:
Act scientifically and pragmatically: Knowledge of
existing evidence needs to be combined with knowledge
of the unique initial conditions of a system. Interven-
tions need to adapt as the complex system responds and
learning emerges about unpredictable effects. This stra-
tegic principle reflects the high level stages of an im-
provement initiative through the four simple rules:
� Understand problems and opportunities
� Identify, test and iteratively develop potential
solutions
� Assess whether improvement is achieved, and
capture and share learning
� Invest in continual improvement
Embrace complexity: Evidence-based interventions
only work if related practices and processes of care within
the complex system are functional. Evidence-translation
efforts need to identify and address existing problems with
usual care, recognising that this typically includes a range
of interdependent parts of the system. This principle em-
phasises the need to investigate and understand the
uniqueness of each local system and respond to complex-
ity from the micro- to macro-system as reflected by the
four rules:
� Understand processes and practices of care
� Understand the types and sources of variation
� Identify systemic issues
� Seek political, strategic and financial alignment
Outcomes
�
Although initially reluctant, rigorous weekly measurement allowed the team in the first site to track progress, identify potential
improvements and, ultimately, to demonstrate success. Over 12 months, variation in delivery of the individual care elements
reduced from 13–90% before the bundle to 74–92% afterwards, and overall compliance increased from 0% to 49% [110].
�
Two sites achieved sustainable use of the bundle 1 year after the formal end of the project by integrating the bundle into the routine admission
process. One site maintained measurement of CAP bundle compliance to continue monitoring and responding to variation in use and maintained
high levels of compliance.

 Box 2: A project narrative of evidence translation in medicines management (MM)
The 18-monthCollaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) North West London (NWL) MM project aimed
to implement an evidence-based post-discharge follow-up phone call [111, 112] to support patients whose medications had been
changed during an emergency admission.
Outline of problem (primarily explored during months 0–6)
�
The follow-up phone call intervention was intended to ensure patients understood their new medicines regimen. The project team
expected the introduction of phone calls to be straightforward, but quickly discovered that they needed to address many related
issues.
�
Obtaining information about patients’ medication history to inform the follow-up phone call was a major problem, requiring
triangulation of information from several sources after hospital admission. The availability of this information was recognised as a
systemic problem which directly affected the ability to complete medicines reconciliation at discharge.
�
Separate medication lists were maintained by up to four different professional groups for their own purpose (doctors, pharmacists,
nurses and physiotherapists) with little awareness of each other’s documentation practices. This silo-working increased the risk of
medication errors. For example, a patient with arthritis was unable to open bottles with a child-proof top. The physiotherapist was
aware of this, but the pharmacy was not and continued to dispense medications in inaccessible containers.
Initial solutions (tested and implemented during months 7–12)
�
Staff recognised that they would need to redesign the process, and renegotiate their roles to coordinate their work more effectively.
A single agreed medicines reconciliation form was introduced, which allowed them to assess the quality of medicines reconciliation.
�
Patients involved with the project challenged assumptions about relying on clinicians and organisations for this information.
In a spin off project, clinical teams worked with patients to develop a patient-held ‘My Medications Passport’, which could
act as an information source to support medicines reconciliation and help patients take greater ownership of their medication histories
[113, 114].
Key learning about complexity
Investigation into the causes of medication errors revealed several variables affecting the process, including the number of patients
being admitted, the complexity of each patient’s condition, and the number and type of medications per patient. These variables were
further influenced by staff working practices, including the time available to reconcile an individual patient’s medications. Variation in
doctors’ performance prompted the team to improve teaching for junior doctors emphasising the importance of documenting
medication changes using standardised procedures for recording and reconciling medicines. Junior doctors assumed someone else
completed the medication documentation, so the team worked with them until it was accepted as a routine responsibility.
�
The team had to negotiate with the executive team to secure the appropriate budget and permission for the changes in medicine
reconciliation to take place. Delivering longer term changes required permission or support from people outside the team,
including the education leads responsible for doctors’ induction.
�
Aligning the project to organisational priorities took time and effort, and helped secure vital resources, including executive support,
to further champion the work and permission for team members to be released to support the project.
�
At the start of the project, medicines reconciliation had poor visibility within the hospital and was not an organisational priority.
The team worked to increase its profile, identifying how the work related to key hospital concerns, including the importance of
medicines reconciliation to admissions avoidance, how it linked to the safe and effective flow of patients through emergency care,
and how it contributed cost-savings by avoiding inappropriate prescribing.
Outcomes
During the project, the error rate in medicines reconciliation reduced from 24% to an average of 11%. Week-to-week variation reduced
from 0%–74% to 0%–32% [95]; at this point the follow-up phone calls were re-instigated [115].

 Engage and empower: Evidence translation and sys-
tem navigation requires commitment and insights from
staff and patients with experience of the local sys-
tem. Changes need to align with their motivations
and concerns. The four rules reflect factors that in-
fluence engagement at an individual and team level
through to supporting infrastructure and organisa-
tional level:
� Actively engage those responsible for and affected by
change
� Facilitate dialogue
� Foster a culture of willingness to learn and freedom
to act
� Provide headroom, resources, training and support
Relationship between SHIFT-Evidence principles:
The process of evidence translation and improvement, as
represented in SHIFT-Evidence, is intended to be a pro-
gressive iterative process. The ‘simple rules’ provide a con-
ceptual framework to guide practice and research in
complex systems, responding to emergent challenges and
capturing generative learning (Fig. 2). In practice, feedback
loops exist between each of the rules as learning emerges
about
the
changes
required
and
effectiveness
of
interventions.
Few
improvement
initiatives
follow
a
smooth linear pattern.
Our hypothesis is that all SHIFT-Evidence strategic
principles and ‘simple rules’ are necessary to achieve
successful and sustained improvements in care, and
are interdependent. For example, ‘active engagement’
of healthcare professionals and patients is necessary
to fully ‘understand practices and processes of care’.
Equally, ‘active engagement’ of staff may reveal that
their priorities do not align with current ‘strategic,
political and financial’ incentives, and vice versa. Our
hypothesis implies that such tensions, if unresolved,
will negatively impact success.
Project narratives, common challenges and simple rules
Two of the 22 CLAHRC NWL project narratives are pre-
sented as detailed examples to illustrate the practical reality
of evidence translation and improvement (Box 1 and 2). Both
demonstrated measurable success against their original ob-
jectives, although each encountered unexpected obstacles.
This is followed by presentation of the 12 simple rules, de-
scribing how the simple rules relate to the project narratives
and substantive theory (Tables 1, 2 and 3), and reflecting on
insights provided by complex systems thinking.

 The project narrative in Box 1 outlines the challenges
to embedding evidence-based practices and achieving
improvements
in
care
quality
for
patients
with
community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
The second project (Box 2) illustrates the complexity of
healthcare systems and how this was experienced by a clin-
ical team attempting to improve medicines management
(MM) for patients following discharge from hospital.
Act scientifically and pragmatically
The strategic principle ‘act scientifically and pragmatic-
ally’ demonstrates that knowledge of existing evidence is
only one part of the effort required to achieve sustain-
able improvements in care in complex systems.
Understand the problem and opportunities
The two case studies reveal the challenges of introdu-
cing evidence-based practices or interventions into
complex systems, and demonstrate how any interven-
tion is sensitive to the unique initial conditions of the
local system.
The MM project narrative shows how the intercon-
nectivity of different system elements influenced the
work that was required to improve the system; the de-
sired intervention (a follow-up phone call) could not be
initiated until dependent processes (medicines reconcili-
ation at discharge from hospital) were improved.
The CAP project narrative demonstrates how the au-
tonomy of individual agents working in the system chal-
lenged the introduction of the care bundle intervention;
at the outset of the project, there was little incentive or
motivation to take action to address a problem many
perceived did not exist. Baseline data was required to
help create tension for change by demonstrating the ex-
tent of the local problem.
Linear
models
for
the
spread
and
scale-up
of
evidence-based practices assume the same intervention
can be applied to the same problem in multiple set-
tings. Understanding the consequences of working in
complex systems challenges these assumptions; the his-
torical origins and path-dependency of any given sys-
tem
means
that
somewhat
different
problems
or
configurations of problems and opportunities will exist
in any given setting [35]. To gain traction, effort needs
to be invested in understanding priority issues and
areas for improvement within the local system, and any
interventions need to be perceived as relevant and ac-
tionable by system agents [54].
Identify, test and iteratively develop potential solutions
Both project narratives reveal how system interconnected-
ness presented a challenge to fully anticipating which
changes were required. This was reflected at two levels.
Firstly, each intervention needed to be refined and
Table 1 Substantive theory for acting scientifically and pragmatically – challenges and corresponding actions required for successful
evidence translation and improvement
Act scientifically and pragmatically
Common challenges
Simple rules: strategies for overcoming challenges
Pre-selected interventions may not solve the problems of the local system
- People will not be motivated to change if they do not perceive a
problem exists, or if wider concerns prevail
- Varying perceptions of current practice
- Conflicting views of problem and improvement approach
Understand the problem and opportunities
- Draw on evidence and local knowledge to understand the problem
and opportunities
- Understand perceptions of local needs and priorities
- Identify common improvement goals
‘Evidence’ and interventions need to be perceived as locally relevant and
actionable
- Varying perceptions of evidence
- Interventions may not be used or work effectively
- Interventions need to fit with or modify existing practices, behaviours
and competencies
- Interconnected challenges emerge as changes are made
- Changes have unintended consequences
- Multiple interventions are likely to be required
Identify, test and iteratively develop potential solutions
- Identify intervention ideas based on evidence and build theory of
change
- Incremental experimental approach to introduce changes
- Identify and respond to emergent challenges
- Identify adverse effects in other parts of the system
- Modify and refine change theory in response to learning
- Review and balance investment of effort across problems and
potential interventions to maximise impact
Individual perceptions of system performance are unreliable
- System performance and characteristics can be hard to see from any
individual perspective as they do not take into account system complexity
- Objective measures can reveal how the system is performing but may
not reveal why or what changes are required
- A lack of data and narrative limits learning, including within teams,
organisations or for research
Assess whether improvement is achieved, capture and share learning
- Carefully select a small number of measures as an objective indication
of system performance
- Use regular measurement to assess impact and inform actions
- Use formal and informal methods to obtain feedback that can explain
performance and guide future actions
- Capture change narrative and use for organisational memory, to
spread learning and to inform research
Interventions need to be reviewed and adapted as systems evolve over time
- Healthcare is a continually changing dynamic system
- Competing factors threaten long-term success
- New evidence, priorities and opportunities emerge
Invest in continual improvement
- Anticipate, plan and monitor for threats to sustainability
- Proactively identify and incorporate new evidence
- Continually respond to new ‘problems’ and opportunities

 adapted in response to emergent learning about local
practice and to fit with established processes (e.g. modifi-
cations to the design of the CAP care bundle or MM rec-
onciliation form). Secondly, each project needed to
address multiple parallel or dependent issues beyond the
original scope of their project to achieve their improve-
ment goal (e.g. CAP project needed to address antibiotic
prescribing policies and microbiological test ordering pro-
cesses, MM project needed to address pharmacy staffing
rotas and the roles and responsibilities of junior doctors).
Observing evidence-translation through a complexity
lens therefore suggests the need to consider multiple
strategies for intervening and the considerable effort that
is required to support the uptake of any specific
evidence-based practices. System understanding emerges
over time, and often in unexpected ways, through testing
intervention ideas in practice and responding to insights
and challenges that are often difficult to anticipate,
reflecting tacit knowledge or deep-seated routines and
cultural practices [55].
Assess whether improvement is achieved, and capture and
share learning
Both project narratives reveal the challenges of gauging
performance in a complex system from an individual
perspective. Objective measurement revealed in both in-
stances that standards of care were lower than antici-
pated
(CAP
patients
receiving
evidence-based
care
standards; MM patients with fully reconciled medicines
at discharge). These findings provided an insight into
‘hidden’ system performance, and reflects, despite the
good intentions and hard work from individual agents,
the challenges of coordinating collective behaviour of
agents towards a common goal.
The need for measurement to guide improvement
efforts also applied when sharing learning. As the
CAP care bundle rolled out to local hospitals, the ori-
ginal site shared their experiences of developing the
intervention and implementation. Whilst some learn-
ing was captured formally in versions of the care
bundle form and summaries of the actions taken, the
written material provided only a partial representation
of the issues encountered and their resolution. Much
of the learning about what had happened was shared
through dialogue. Even armed with this learning, local
sites essentially started from the beginning, under-
standing their own local problems and opportunities,
building will and motivation to adopt new ways of
working, and adapting intervention concepts to work
in their local setting.

translation and improvement
Embrace complexity
Common challenges
Simple rules: strategies for overcoming challenges
Interventions do not work on their own – they need to fit with practices
and processes of care
- Interventions need to be used by people and are dependent on
other processes and practices
- Interventions interact with complex processes and established practices
of professions and organisations
Understand practices and processes of care
- Understand what is actually happening and identify interdependent
practices and processes
- Consider fit of new or modified interventions and use to inform
intervention design, implementation activities, and ongoing learning
and actions to drive improvement
There is rarely a single, standardised, way by which care is delivered
- Agents within the system are constantly interacting and responding
to each other and to internal and external stimuli
- This results in inherent levels of variation within healthcare systems,
even when standard processes exist
- People have to make decisions and take actions in real world
(imperfect) conditions
Understand types and sources of variation
- Natural variation needs to be understood to inform intervention
design and implementation
- Identify what variation is (un)acceptable and what improvements are
required
- Use data, observations and feedback on variations to learn and assess
whether progress is being made
It cannot be assumed that dependent processes or systems are working well
- To achieve the original improvement goal other problems or related
issues may need to take priority
- Practices and processes are often sub-optimal and may require im-
provement to support evidence implementation
- Systemic problems can be hard to overcome and may challenge
assumptions or current practices and cultures
- Not all systemic problems can be addressed
Identify systemic issues
- Be vigilant for systemic issues as learning emerges
- Consider what is within the project team’s sphere of influence, and
where additional support is needed
- Use learning to influence planning and design, and where necessary
how to function within system constraints
Any intervention will compete for attention and resources with other
initiatives or requirements
- Attention and resources are limited and initiatives need to work
within system constraints
- Initiatives will always ‘compete’ with other priorities and may fail
without appropriate support and backing
- Managerial, financial, strategic and political decisions and motives
may work in support or against an initiative
Seek political, strategic and financial alignment
- Recognise system constraints and be realistic about what can be
achieved given finite resource and competing priorities
- Consider where improvement might have greatest impact
- Understand negative or positive impacts of political, strategic or financial
incentives on behaviours and use this to inform the design of interventions
- Where possible, seek alignment and consider how to secure support and
continued investment
Reed et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:92 
Page 10 of 20
 Given the uncertainty and unpredictability of inter-
vening in complex systems, objective measures can
provide a driving force to inform project progress. Rather
than assuming that interventions were used and effective,
measurement supported teams to accurately assess pro-
gress towards their goal and revise and adapt interventions
and implementation approaches in light of results [56].
Invest in continual improvement
The challenge of sustaining initial improvements re-
quired teams to navigate both system inertia, attempting
to pull practices back to ‘the way things have always
been done’
, and system evolution in response to internal
and external stimuli.
Whilst all CAP sites achieved initial success, not all
sites sustained those gains. High staff turnover was a
persistent challenge to maintaining improvements with
systems suffering ‘memory loss’
, particularly when junior
doctors leave en masse during clinical rotations. Other
challenges included the consistency of clinical and man-
agerial leadership, their ability to maintain a high profile
for the work, and to cope when other emerging and
often competing priorities drew attention to other parts
of the system. Sites that did sustain were able to connect
care bundle use to other substantive practices such as
standardised admission processes and a history of care
bundle use for other clinical presentations.
This learning demonstrates that improvements in care
are not static; indeed, the complex and adaptive nature of
healthcare systems means emergent events may threaten
or enhance achievements [57]. Translation cannot be seen
as a one-off activity and on-going monitoring and review
needs to guide actions to adapt to system dynamics and
support long-term success [58]. This learning is sum-
marised in our substantive theory presented in Table 1.
Embrace complexity
The strategic principle ‘embrace complexity’ demon-
strates that evidence-based interventions only work if
supporting or dependent practices and processes of care
are working sufficiently well.
Understand practices and processes of care
The project narratives demonstrate that interventions do
not exist in isolation, but need to fit with, and are
dependent on, other practices and processes of care.
Table 3 Substantive theory for engaging and empowering – challenges and corresponding actions required for successful evidence
translation and improvement
Engage and empower
Common challenges
Simple rules: strategies for overcoming challenges
If people are not motivated, change will not take place, and without
their engagement, insights will be lost
- People will resist changes that do not fit with their perceptions
of what change is required and it is necessary to understand their
emotional responses
- Healthcare professionals and patients hold local knowledge about
how care practices and processes work
- No one person can ‘see’ the whole system, but each person can
provide valuable insights
Actively engage those responsible for and affected by change
- Understand what really matters to people and connect with emotional
drivers for change
- Engage people in identifying and understanding problems so they ‘own’
the rationale for change, to harness their knowledge and input to design
and test solutions and gather feedback on what does or does not work
Expect conflict and tension
- Sharing knowledge and making sense of different, conflicting,
perspectives is challenging; different professional groups have
different norms and languages
- Power differentials exist and it takes time to build trust and
relationships to support meaningful dialogue
- Patient’s experiential knowledge is not always valued
Facilitate dialogue
- Create a safe environment for people to share their views and increase
common understanding of the system
- Promoting listening and constructive dialogue and building trust,
relationships and partnership
- Facilitate discussion and engage people in active reflection and discussion
at all stages of design, conduct and evaluation, and respect emotionally
charged responses
Underlying expectations are to get it right, first time, quickly
- Focus on centralised leadership, command and control
- Expectation of ‘positive results’ and importance placed on ‘being
right’, with a lack of constructive challenge
- Limited opportunities to share opinions or concerns, and lack of
permission or support to try their own ideas
- Judgemental cultures can represses learning
Build a culture of willingness to learn and freedom to act
- Provide healthcare professionals and patients with the freedom and
support to investigate and take action
- Support the development of a learning culture which is willing and able
to conduct improvement work
- Encourage learning from failure as well as success and openness about
real performance and problems
Improving complex systems takes time, effort and reflection
- Care professionals rarely have time to consider how different parts
of the system work together beyond their professional group, unit
or department
- Change takes time, and requires different skill sets to those in which
professionals are traditionally trained
- Competently enacting new practices requires training and practice
- Organisations lack improvement infrastructure
Provide headroom, resources, training and support
- Provide professionals with time out from daily practice spaces to
collaborate with each other and patients
- Provide training and support for new interventions or changes to practice
to build competence and confidence
- Build skills and competencies for improvement in individuals and at an
organisational level, including specialist skills and data infrastructure
Reed et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:92

 Initial perceptions of the project team leaders and
other clinicians tended to view interventions in isola-
tion from the system (MM perceived the follow-up
phone call would be a standalone intervention to im-
prove patient understanding of their medicines, and
initial work of the CAP team focused exclusively on
developing and perfecting details of the paper care
bundle form). Once MM project team had identified
the interdependency of the follow-up phone call with
medicines reconciliation processes at discharge, they
sought to understand why current practices were not
working. They found that, although separate processes
for documenting medicines reconciliation were rou-
tinely used with each individual staff group, they did
not support communication and consolidation be-
tween staff groups. This was left to serendipity (e.g.
being on the ward at the same time as another staff
member) and personal effort to communicate and ex-
change information between professional groups. This
insight led them to develop an additional interven-
tion, namely a new shared form for medicines recon-
ciliation that would be used by all four professional
groups.
Complexity theories suggest that it is not possible to
understand a system, or how to influence it, by reducing
the system to its individual parts. As the projects pro-
gressed, it became increasingly apparent that project
teams needed to look beyond individual competence or
actions, to understand the complex interactions between
individual agents, and the resulting patterns, that deter-
mine the quality of care [28].
Understand the types and sources of variation
A major challenge faced by the project teams was recog-
nition that there is no single standardised way by which
care is delivered. Whilst complex systems can give rise
to regular patterns and ingrained behaviours, these are
constantly perturbed by internal and external stimuli
that systems adapt and respond to.
As the baseline data demonstrated, doctors’ knowledge
of appropriate treatment for CAP patients did not trans-
late into high quality care. The delivery of care needed
to be reconceptualised as a series of hand-offs and inter-
actions between multiple healthcare professionals (doc-
tors, nurses, pharmacists, porters) each of which could
be subject to various interruptions and delays whilst
healthcare staff deal with multiple patients and compet-
ing priorities. Influencing factors ranged from the small
acts of individual discretion (e.g. at what time a staff
member took lunch break, how long they stopped to talk
to a patient, or which order patients were seen in), to
factors outside of any individuals immediate control
(how many patients are admitted that day, the experi-
ence level of staff on shift, temporary staffing shortages
(sickness, compassionate leave), chronic staffing short-
ages (funding, staff training and retention), and crisis
events).
Investigation revealed that there were no routine pro-
cesses for treating CAP. Each member of staff had devel-
oped individual approaches reflecting their personal
knowledge of the system and relationships within it
necessary
to
coordinate
and
deliver
patient
care.
Introducing a shared standardised practice (the care bun-
dle) helped to reduce variation but was not fail-safe and
variation was still apparent, influenced by the factors listed
above. The care bundle contributed to creating a more re-
silient process less likely to be affected by every day events
such as interruptions or communication failures.
Intervening in complex systems requires an under-
standing of the variation inherent in all healthcare sys-
tems. Complex systems are dynamic and fluctuating,
continually responding to internal and external stimuli,
which means people have to make decisions and take ac-
tion in real-world conditions. Rather than assuming
standardised, idealised processes exist, it is necessary to
understand and work with the complex reality of the set-
tings in which care is delivered [59].
Identify systemic issues
The project narratives demonstrated that, even once
interconnected and dependent processes and systems
are identified, it cannot be assumed that they are
working well.
The MM team discovered whole system issues with
chains of dependencies, wherein phone calls depended
on accurate information, accurate information depended
on medicines reconciliation, and medicines reconcili-
ation depended on staff coordination and joined-up pro-
cedures. Not all of these dependent, problematic, areas
were within their direct control, and relationships had to
be fostered with other key agents (e.g. educational leads,
executive managers) to influence areas of concern. Some
were considered unresolvable within the sphere of influ-
ence and timescales (e.g. interoperability of primary care
and secondary care electronic health records) and were
‘parked’
, or workarounds developed (e.g. where patients
involved with the project developed a solution (patient--
held medication records) that was not constrained by or-
ganisational or professional boundaries).
This demonstrates the nature of working in an open sys-
tem. Not only is there interconnectedness within a system,
but between various nested systems which connect and
interact in a multitude of ways (e.g. the pharmacy system
interacts with and is influenced by wider hospital systems,
medical education systems, electronic record systems,
etc.). Achieving an overall improvement required many
other aspects of the system, and related systems, to be
‘fixed’. The original evidence-based intervention acted as a
Reed et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:92 
Page 12 of 20
 catalyst for a more comprehensive, complex and challen-
ging system-wide analysis and an improvement process
that required support and action from the wider organisa-
tion [60, 61].
Seek political, strategic and financial alignment
A persistent challenge faced by the project teams was
that their individual areas of interest and interventions
needed to compete for attention and resources with
other initiatives or requirements.
Both projects were initially facilitated by financial
support from the NIHR CLAHRC NWL programme,
which created space and resource to test and develop
interventions and capture an evidence base of their
effectiveness.
However,
engaging
already
busy
and
fully committed clinical staff proved challenging, and
given
the
system
interdependencies,
project
teams
needed to build strategic and political alignments with
other system stakeholders to influence areas beyond
their control.
The long-term sustainability of the projects was influ-
enced by political, strategic and financial alignment. MM
took advantage of changing political priorities to secure
resources to support new ways of working and to in-
crease awareness and perceptions of importance in
frontline staff, and was able to sustain new medicines
reconciliation practices. The sustainability of the CAP
care bundle was variably influenced in the different orga-
nisations by their ability to align with key performance
indicators, financial incentives or cost-saving initiatives.
Understanding complexity also means being aware of
the constraints within the system. If more resources are
consumed in one area, then another area will receive
less. The finite amount of time, resource and attention
within a system is already heavily committed with other
wider organisational priorities, including managing ser-
vice capacity to meet demand, achieving performance
targets and responding to policy changes [62, 63], and
implementation of multiple sources of evidence and in-
novations [64]. Evidence translation processes must con-
sider organisational operating pressures and carefully
reflect on where resources should be focused to achieve
the maximum impact.
This learning is summarised in our substantive theory
presented in Table 2.
Engage and empower
The strategic principle ‘engage and empower’ demon-
strates that evidence translation and system navigation
requires commitment and insights from staff and pa-
tients with experience of the local care settings, and
changes to a complex system need to align with their
motivations and concerns.
Actively engage those responsible for and affected by
change
Both projects experienced the harsh reality that if people
are not motivated, change will not take place. They rea-
lised it was necessary to align with existing personal
drivers or build motivation for change in order to get
people to adopt new ways of working, and contribute in-
sights and support to problem solving and overcoming
obstacles.
In the CAP project, despite having motivated and embed-
ded clinical leadership and support from a multi-disciplinary
team, it was a challenge to engage other staff, and in particu-
lar other senior doctors. Doctors who believed they already
knew how to treat CAP patients, were sceptical about the
value of the intervention, and concerned that the care bundle
was ‘dumbing down’ complex medical knowledge for junior
doctors. Producing the care bundle intervention was not
sufficient to instigate behaviour change, and it was rarely
used. Engaging staff to understand and respond to their
concerns, combined with regular use of measurement and
feedback, supported on-going learning and generated local
evidence to convince more sceptical individuals that the care
bundle increased reliable delivery of evidence-based care.
Investing time to engage staff was critical to the use of the
intervention.
This example provides a powerful demonstration of
the agency of individuals in a complex system. They are
highly autonomous, skilled and opinionated individuals
with significant discretion to choose what they do and
how they do things. This enables them to evade new
practices that they have not bought into (or do them in
a tokenistic manner), whether initiated by colleagues or
through top down directives.
Whilst engaging people can be challenging, the in-
sights they provide are critical to understanding the
problems and opportunities, evolving the intervention
design and to identify dependent problems to address.
In the MM project, patients provided insight into system
problems that professionals had not been aware of.
Much of the knowledge needed to understand why the
problem existed, and how to overcome it, was held
tacitly by frontline staff.
‘Seeing’ a complex system is hard. It is necessary to
draw on local knowledge and practical wisdom to under-
stand how different elements of care fit together, whilst
recognising that each individual only experiences the as-
pects of a system with which they interact directly. No
individual is capable of knowing all parts of a system.
Frontline staff and patients need to be central in the
planning, design and conduct of evidence translation
and quality improvement endeavours [65, 66]. People
affected by change are those most invested in taking
ownership and overcoming obstacles and barriers to en-
sure changes function at a local level [67, 68]. Identifying
Reed et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:92 
Page 13 of 20
 personal and emotional drivers, and aligning changes to
those drivers, can ensure people remain motivated and
persistent at times of challenge.
Facilitate dialogue
Bringing together different professional groups and pa-
tients may sound straightforward, but this was fre-
quently experienced as challenging, and project teams
learnt to anticipate conflict or tensions between different
agents. For example, patients with CAP are routinely
transferred within the critical first 4 h; therefore, treat-
ment required coordination between the emergency de-
partment and the acute medical unit. Although staff
from both departments were involved in the project, dis-
putes emerged about who was responsible for initiating
and completing the care bundle. Division of labour
(partly driven by increasing specialisation) had exacer-
bated the boundaries between professions, units and or-
ganisations, each with their own beliefs, performance
expectations and ‘territory’ to protect. Changes to estab-
lished routines were perceived as threatening or distract-
ing,
or
compromising
professionals’ autonomy
and
ability to effectively perform their established roles.
Dialogue between different ‘communities of practice’ and
collaboration between professionals and patients often
required facilitation [69, 70].
In complex systems, time is required to facilitate social
sense-making, increasing understanding of each other’s
perspectives and motives, and to learn how these can
better coexist in the same system [71]. Whilst agents
may frequently interact with one another, they rarely
understand each other’s experiences of being in the sys-
tem and the expectations, pressures and uncertainties
they may face. Change affects individuals in different
ways. Patients need to know how new care processes will
affect them; staff need to understand how it can be in-
corporated into their current workload and how it will
affect their status or professional identity [72].
Build a culture of willingness to learn and freedom to act
The teams we observed tended to work in high pressure
environments
with
constrained
resources
and
high
performance standards and expectations. There were
underlying expectations to get things right quickly the
first time, which often repressed people’s ability to admit
uncertainty or when things were not working well.
These behaviours were reflected in some project team
members’ command and control leadership styles result-
ing from traditional hierarchies. Team members also
tended to expect that change would be easy and quick.
Many teams found it demoralising when their initial
change ideas did not work straight away, or at the large
number of barriers and obstacles that needed to be over-
come in the process.
Successful teams tended to have the curiosity and per-
sistence in the face of unexpected learning or set-backs.
They also tended to be less hierarchical, where the views
of all team members were listened to and valued and
people were empowered to explore and solve problems.
For example, the MM project discovered that, although
individual professions were working hard, their collective
endeavours failed to consistently deliver the high-quality
care they valued. This was disappointing to the staff, but
the team transformed this into energy for change. A cul-
ture focused on performance management may have re-
pressed this discovery, denying the organisation an
important opportunity to learn.
This reflects the inability to ‘control’ complex systems,
or to reliably predict how to intervene to achieve a de-
sired outcome. To be successful, it is necessary to have
the humility to accept that the answers cannot be fully
known in advance, to be willing to learn from experi-
ments conducted within the local system, and to distrib-
ute leadership, engaging agents from across the system
in the act of improving the system [73, 74].
Provide headroom, resources, training and support
Improving complex systems takes time, effort and reflec-
tion. Whilst healthcare professionals work to deliver care to
the best of their ability within many constraints, they have
little time to consider how the whole system functions.
Many of the skills required to understand and intervene in
complex systems (e.g. understanding processes and vari-
ation, team work) are not commonly taught to healthcare
professionals or patients, and represent new ways of think-
ing that are often counter-cultural to prevailing norms [75].
These project narratives highlight that translation and
improvement require space and time. Staff needed ‘head-
room’ away from busy practice, time to think, to engage
with peers and patients to investigate how their routine
processes fit within the overall care system, and to ex-
plore potential improvements.
To support the conduct of improvement initiatives,
project teams received training from CLAHRC NWL on
improvement skills. Teams had limited prior experience
and required encouragement and support to use quality
improvement methods. Skills in team working and pro-
ject management were also provided by CLAHRC NWL
through on-going coaching and expert input.
One of the major features of complex systems is that
they are self-organising. Healthcare professionals and
patients are a critical resource to understand and effect
change within complex systems, but for them to mean-
ingfully engage requires training, support, resources and
headroom in skills they can transfer to other implemen-
tation and improvement work [76, 77]. This learning is
summarised in our substantive theory presented in
Table 3.

 Discussion
SHIFT-Evidence provides a comprehensive overview of
the challenges and corresponding actions required for
successful implementation and improvement. These are
summarised as three strategic principles and 12 ‘simple
rules’. Exploration of the practical reality of making
changes in frontline care settings reveals the need to
reconceptualise the challenge of evidence translation to
take account of system complexity.
Systems evolve over time and have historical path
dependencies
Our findings demonstrate that intervening in complex
systems requires an understanding of the unique initial
conditions (problems, opportunities, people, practices
and patterns) in each local setting that are influenced by
historical path dependencies. Scientific evidence about
which interventions to use needs to be balanced with
local system requirements, rather than assuming the
starting point will be the same in each setting, and a
commitment to continual improvement is needed to
allow for the fact that systems evolve and adapt over
time. This temporal dimension of systems thinking is
reflected in the SHIFT-Evidence framework by the stra-
tegic principle ‘act scientifically and pragmatically’.
These findings challenge current conventions of seeing
implementation as a one-off or time-limited activity, and
build on Hawe et al.’s [61] proposal that interventions
are ‘events in systems’. Further, a single pre-planned
intervention, or set of interventions, is unlikely to be
sufficient to achieve evidence implementation and im-
provements. Instead, multiple interventions are likely to
be required; with the need emerging only as changes are
implemented and system understanding grows. This
builds on quality improvement approaches that promote
iterative development over time [59, 78, 79], and organ-
isational learning perspectives that value generative
learning (e.g. double (and triple) loop learning) [73, 80].
We propose, in light of these findings, that termin-
ology shifts from the use of the noun ‘intervention’ to
the verb ‘intervening’. We believe that the concept of
‘intervening to achieve an improvement’ better reflects
the iterative and negotiated process required to test mul-
tiple interventions whilst noticing and responding to
local system requirements over an extended period of
time (cf. Snowden’s probe-sense-response) [81].
Systems are dynamic and interconnected
Interventions cannot be considered in isolation from the
system they are implemented into. The uptake and effective
utilisation of any specific intervention is dependent on
established practices and processes of care. These practices
and processes of care cannot be assumed to be working
well, and often additional interventions will be necessary to
address related and systemic problems. Intervening in com-
plex systems requires an understanding of these dynamic
and fluctuating processes. Understanding of system dynam-
ics and interconnectivity is represented by the strategic
principle ‘embrace complexity’.
This challenges current conventions of seeing inter-
ventions as bounded and discrete, and anticipating that
such interventions will be used by people working in a
rational linear manner. Interventions are inherently
dependent on the context that they are used in, and it
cannot be assumed that dependent processes and prac-
tices are working well. This builds on literature from op-
erations management and patient safety in valuing an
understanding of ‘work as is’ as opposed to ‘work as
imagined’ [82, 83]; people in complex systems are chal-
lenged with making decisions in real-world conditions,
under high pressure, with constrained time and re-
sources, whilst balancing multiple priorities [84].
Systems are made up of individual agents capable of
self-organisation
The implications of systems evolving over time and their
dynamic, interconnected nature are that capacity and
capability needs to be built into the system to reflect, ex-
periment and learn about intervening within the system
over time. The strategic principle ‘engage and empower’
emphasises the critical role local system members play
in identifying and solving local problems (although each
person individually can only partially know or see the
whole system), and the necessity for their willingness
and motivation to adopt new ways of working.
This challenges current conventions of implementa-
tion activities being designed and conducted by people
outside of the system, and draws attention to the unique
insights provided by people within the local system
(healthcare professionals, patients, managers) about how
they self-organise and how they experience attempts to
intervene. This builds on literature on co-production
[65, 66, 85] and co-design [86] that emphasises the im-
portance of engaging local stakeholders to solve prob-
lems that matter to them in their local setting and
acknowledges the extensive work on understanding indi-
vidual psychology of behaviour change and group dy-
namics [87, 88].
Value of SHIFT-Evidence to practitioners and academics
SHIFT-Evidence is the first empirically grounded frame-
work for evidence translation in complex systems that
can help make predictions and provide explanations
about challenges and influences on success.
This research adds to the complexity science literature,
initially proposed by Plsek and Greenhalgh [28], describ-
ing healthcare as a complex system. Building on this per-
spective, it makes a unique contribution in considering
Reed et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:92 
Page 15 of 20
 the implications of complexity for deliberate attempts
to intervene and introduce evidence-based practices
[36, 37]. Our study focused on micro-level initiatives,
but findings resonate with existing literature on com-
plexity in relation to macro-level initiatives (e.g. pol-
icy, systems design) [29, 34]. By providing insights
into the ‘sharp end’ of practice, SHIFT-Evidence can
provide insights to policymakers and system leaders
as to how ‘top down’ initiatives might be received in
complex systems.
This study also contributes to literature on evidence trans-
lation and implementation. It advances research by Craig et
al. [89] on complex interventions, and by McCormack et al.
[90], amongst others, which recognised the importance of
context in the uptake of evidence-based practices, and May
et al. [38], which expanded their theory of implementation to
consider
context
as
a
complex
adaptive
system.
SHIFT-Evidence builds on these views to consider the inter-
action between interventions, implementation strategies and
context as inseparable and interacting components of a com-
plex system. This view is reinforced by complexity thinking
by resisting the temptation to isolate or reduce a system to
its component parts, and instead to take interest in the inter-
actions and patterns that emerge across the whole system.
For academics, SHIFT-Evidence provides an explana-
tory and predictive framework. The substantive theory
explains the challenges encountered during evidence
translation in complex systems and provides a rationale
for strategies and actions to overcome them. The ‘simple
rules’ provide testable hypotheses about the actions
conducive to success that can be tested through future
research. In demonstrating the magnitude of the chal-
lenge faced, SHIFT-Evidence makes clear the need for
interdisciplinary enquiries to advance understanding and
practice.
For patients, practitioners, managers, policymakers and
academics involved with designing, conducting or evaluat-
ing healthcare improvement initiatives, SHIFT-Evidence
provides a common framework to guide their work and
ensure they are considering the breadth of the practical
realities of evidence translation and improvement. The
strategic principles (‘act scientifically and pragmatically’
,
‘embrace complexity’ and ‘engage and empower’) were
designed to be intuitive, accessible and memorable. A
common framework that represents the complex and dy-
namic nature of improvement should help practitioners,
academics and patients collaborate more effectively to
increase the likelihood of success. If practitioners and
patients can easily access practical knowledge, they may
be more willing to contribute to the creation of new
knowledge and to participate in the design, conduct and
evaluation of future change experiments. If researchers
understand how their work directly helps practitioners
achieve improvements, and influence the lives of patients,
they may be more likely to produce outputs which in turn
increase practitioner receptivity and access to research
settings.
For
policymakers,
funders
and
senior
managers,
SHIFT-Evidence emphasises the significant investment
required at all stages of improvement efforts, including
providing frontline practitioners with the time to step
back from their day-to-day activities and the support
needed to overcome barriers and obstacles to improve-
ment. Such resource commitment is often seen as a
luxury rather than essential. By using this structured
approach to support funding and prioritisation, this
may allow optimal investment of available resources
and disinvestment in initiatives that add little value.
Limitations and future research
The quality of theory should be assessed by how useful
it is in solving societal problems recognising that “the
published word is not the final one, but only a pause in
the never-ending process of generating theory” [91].
Therefore, rather than be seen as a finalised theory, or a
perfect set of ‘simple rules’
, the value of SHIFT-Evidence
needs to be assessed through its usefulness in practice
(and research), and should act as a catalyst for further
improvement and refinement of the theory as predic-
tions are tested.
The first limitation of this work is the transferability of
the substantive (context-specific) theory to other settings
beyond NWL and a UK cultural context. While research
drew on a range of real-world improvement studies from
different settings and on diverse clinical topics, all cases
were from a single region (London, UK). Our wider
author and team experiences suggest the cases represent
wider national and global challenges (e.g. [92]). However,
there
is
a
need
to
explore
the
transferability
of
SHIFT-Evidence into other global settings and to con-
tinue to assess the comparative importance of the indi-
vidual principles in different contexts.
The second limitation of this work is the transferability
of findings to different intervention types and implemen-
tation and improvement approaches. All of the projects
included in the empirical study were led by clinical
leaders who voluntarily took on the role and defined the
improvement area and evidence-based solutions, and in
many instances this was done in collaboration with their
teams and wider stakeholders. In addition, the use of a
specific, quality improvement approach was promoted
and supported in all project teams, although actual use
of the approach was variable [93]. Further work is re-
quired to explore the transferability of SHIFT-Evidence
to a greater diversity of intervention types (including
organisational, system or policy level change) and imple-
mentation and improvement approaches.
Reed et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:92 
Page 16 of 20
 The third limitation is methodological. The auto-ethnographic
role of the researchers provided benefits including
proximity to the subject matter, extensive contact
with project teams and long-term relationships to ex-
plore how issues evolved over time. As all authors
were senior members of the programme, there is a
risk that their access to conversations and their per-
ceptions and interpretations of the findings would be
affected by status. The collaborative approach adopted
between authors and other members of the CLAHRC
NWL team (including more junior staff) allowed ac-
cess to feedback from other programme participants
and different types of conversations and ‘behind the
scenes’ encounters. In addition, regular engagement
with CLAHRC NWL project team members helped to
triangulate findings and gain different perspectives. As
such, the findings represent a culmination of discus-
sion and sense making between the researchers and
participants
over
an
extended
period
of
time.
Evidence of these shared reflections exists in the pub-
lications co-authored with project teams that demon-
strate insights into the challenges and complexity
experienced (e.g. [94–96]). Interpretation of the re-
sults was further triangulated with other experts in
the field and in analysis of extensive literature to sup-
port reflectivity and to increase the reliability and val-
idity of the findings. However, further research is
required to explore how different methodological or
theoretical perspectives produce convergent or diver-
gent findings.
Further research is required to examine how to effect-
ively operationalise the SHIFT-Evidence ‘simple rules’ in
practice [97]. For example, knowing that ‘understanding
problems and opportunities’ is important does not pro-
vide detailed guidance on how to engage relevant stake-
holders to access local knowledge nor how to make
sense of complex system interactions. Many approaches,
tools and methods for operations research [98, 99], net-
work analysis [36], implementation and quality improve-
ment have already been developed and studied [100–
104], and this knowledge should inform the generation
of structured and practical approaches that enable the
SHIFT-Evidence ‘simple rules’ to be enacted in practice.
It will also be necessary to work with advances in
complexity sciences to develop new approaches to the
practice and research of intervening in complex systems.
Conclusion
SHIFT-Evidence is a unique framework with explanatory
and predictive power grounded in the practical reality of
evidence translation and improvement in healthcare. It
advances thinking about how to intervene in complex
systems, namely that, to achieve successful improve-
ments from evidence translation in healthcare, it is
necessary to ‘act scientifically and pragmatically’ whilst
‘embracing the complexity’ of the setting in which
change takes place and ‘engaging and empowering’ those
responsible for and affected by the change.
A series of 12 action-orientated ‘simple rules’ are proposed
to guide patients, practitioners, managers, policymakers and
academics to intervene in complex systems. We propose that
efforts to translate evidence into practice should be recon-
ceptualised from focusing on simple relationships between
interventions and outcomes to understanding the complex
and nuanced work required when ‘intervening to achieve an
improvement’. This better reflects the iterative and negoti-
ated process required to test multiple interventions whilst
noticing and responding to learning that emerges from the
system over an extended period of time.
