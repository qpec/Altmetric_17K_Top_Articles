Criteria for inclusion in the Health Technology Assessment journal
Reports are published in Health Technology Assessment (HTA) if (1) they have resulted from work for the HTA programme, and (2) they
are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the reviewers and editors.
Reviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed ‘systematic’ when the account of the search appraisal and synthesis methods (to
minimise biases and random errors) would, in theory, permit the replication of the review by others.
HTA programme
The HTA programme, part of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), was set up in 1993. It produces high-quality research
information on the effectiveness, costs and broader impact of health technologies for those who use, manage and provide care in the NHS.
‘Health technologies’ are broadly defined as all interventions used to promote health, prevent and treat disease, and improve rehabilitation
and long-term care.
The journal is indexed in NHS Evidence via its abstracts included in MEDLINE and its Technology Assessment Reports inform National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance. HTA research is also an important source of evidence for National Screening Committee (NSC)
policy decisions.

Background: Medication organisation devices (MODs) provide compartments for a patient’s medication to
be organised into the days of the week and the recommended times the medication should be taken.
Aim: To define the optimal trial design for testing the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
of MODs.
Design: The feasibility study comprised a systematic review and focus groups to inform a randomised
controlled trial (RCT) design. The resulting features were tested on a small scale, using a 2 × 2 factorial
design to compare MODs with usual packaging and to compare weekly with monthly supply. The
study design was then evaluated.
Setting: Potential participants were identified by medical practices.
Participants: Aged over 75 years, prescribed at least three solid oral dosage form medications,
unintentionally non-adherent and self-medicating. Participants were excluded if deemed by their
health-care team to be unsuitable.
Interventions: One of three MODs widely used in routine clinical practice supplied either weekly
or monthly.
Objectives: To identify the most effective method of participant recruitment, to estimate the prevalence of
intentional and unintentional non-adherence in an older population, to provide a point estimate of the effect
size of MODs relative to usual care and to determine the feasibility and acceptability of trial participation.

 Methods: The systematic review included MOD studies of any design reporting medication adherence,
health and social outcomes, resource utilisation or dispensing or administration errors. Focus groups with
patients, carers and health-care professionals supplemented the systematic review to inform the RCT
design. The resulting design was implemented and then evaluated through questionnaires and group
discussions with participants and health-care professionals involved in trial delivery.
Results: Studies on MODs are largely of poor quality. The relationship between adherence and health
outcomes is unclear. Of the limited studies reporting health outcomes, some reported a positive
relationship while some reported increased hospitalisations associated with MODs. The pre-trial focus
groups endorsed the planned study design, but suggested a minimum recruitment age of 50–60 years.
A total of 35.4% of patients completing the baseline questionnaire were excluded because they already
used a MOD. Active recruitment yielded a higher consent rate, but passive recruitment was more
cost-effective. The prevalence of intentional non-adherence was 24.7% [n = 71, 95% confidence interval
(CI) 19.7% to 29.6%] of participants. Of the remaining 76 participants, 46.1% (95% CI 34.8% to 57.3%)
were unintentionally non-adherent. There was no indication of a difference in adherence between the
study arms. Participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the design. Five adverse/serious adverse
events were identified in the MOD study arms and none was identified in the control arms. There was no
discernible difference in health economic outcomes between the four study arms; the mean intervention
cost was £20 per month greater for MOD monthly relative to usual supply monthly.
Conclusions: MOD provision to unintentionally non-adherent older people may cause medication-related
adverse events. The primary outcome for a definitive MOD trial should be health outcomes. Such a trial
should recruit patients by postal invitation and recruit younger patients.
Future work: A study examining the association between MOD initiation and adverse effects is necessary
and a strategy to safely introduce MODs should be explored. A definitive study testing the clinical
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MODs is also required.
Study registration: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 30626972 and UKCRN 12739.

Assessment Programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 20, No. 50.

edication Organisation Devices (MODs) provide compartments for a patient’s medication to be
organised into the days of the week and times of the day that they should be taken. They are
intended to help people to take their medication as prescribed, but there is little evidence to prove that
they work. The project was to find out whether or not it is feasible to accurately test the effects of MODs.
The first part of the project was to design the method most likely to be effective in testing MODs. We
used previous reports of methods for testing MODs and group discussions with patients and health-care
professionals. The resulting method compared MODs to usual medication packaging and compared
supplying a patient’s medication either weekly or monthly.
The results of the project were that, on average, more patients who used MODs took all of their
medication and became unwell than patients who did not use a MOD. This may be because the patients
with MODs were suddenly taking more of their medication than before they had the MOD, which caused
side effects. Over one-third of people over the age of 75 years already use a MOD and so could not be
invited to participate in the project. Also, nearly one-quarter of patients showed signs of not taking
medication as prescribed on purpose, and of the remaining patients, nearly half were not taking their
medication as prescribed by mistake. A future trial should include younger people to try to catch them
before they start a MOD.

  Scientific summary
Background
Medication organisation devices (MODs) are a box or blister pack divided into days of the week with
several compartments per day to allow for different dose timings. They are intended to organise a patient’s
medication to facilitate correct medication taking. MODs are most frequently provided to older people,
often supported by NHS funds. Definitive evidence for either clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness is
lacking. A trial to fill this evidence gap presents design challenges; thus preliminary research is required.
Objectives
The aim was to design and test the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the
clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MODs. The objectives were to:
1. identify the most effective method of participant recruitment
2. estimate the prevalence of intentional non-adherence within an older population
3. estimate the prevalence and magnitude of unintentional non-adherence within a 3-week period
within an older population
4. describe the functional abilities of an older population
5. provide a point estimate of the effect size of MODs relative to usual packaging
6. describe the feasibility and participant acceptability of trial participation
7. describe the feasibility of collecting the data necessary to conduct an economic evaluation.
Methods
The study comprised two phases: trial design and trial testing. Trial design included a systematic review,
supplementary literature searching and focus groups. The systematic review included MOD studies of any
design reporting any of the following outcomes: medication adherence, health outcomes, health-related
quality of life, health or social care utilisation, dispensing or administration errors or prescribing- or medicine
supply-related costs. Search terms comprising medical subject headings, free text and trade names were
applied to electronic databases. Duplicate independent data extraction was undertaken. Supplementary
searches informed characteristics of the study tested in phase 2. Focus groups with patients, carers and
health-care professionals refined the proposed study design prior to testing.
The trial undertaken in phase 2 was a randomised 2 × 2 factorial design to test the effect of MODs compared
with medication dispensed in usual packaging and of weekly compared with monthly medication supply.
Two methods of recruitment were trialled: passive postal recruitment by a medical practice and active
recruitment by a researcher placed in a medical practice. Six medical practices and the 11 neighbouring
pharmacies were recruited. The six medical practices were matched by patient list size and equally allocated
to the recruitment methods, each of which was trialled for 3 weeks, after which all practices undertook
passive recruitment. Patients were eligible for the study if they were aged ≥ 75 years, were prescribed three
or more solid oral dosage form medications [of which at least two were from a defined list that was intended
for electronic adherence monitoring (EAM)] and were capable of providing informed consent. Patients with a
life expectancy of less than 12 months, current other clinical trial involvement, experience of using a MOD or
a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, a severe mental health disorder or other situation deemed inappropriate
by the health-care team were excluded. Those not self-administering their medication, who were using a
medication organisation strategy incompatible with trial participation or who were intentionally non-adherent

 were also excluded. Intentionally non-adherent participants were excluded by using their responses to a
questionnaire. A 3-week dosage unit count was undertaken for the remaining participants and those
demonstrating perfect adherence were excluded. The remaining unintentionally non-adherent participants
were randomised to one of the four arms. The primary outcome was percentage adherence,
as defined by dosage unit count. Other outcomes explored were self-reported health and quality of life,
autonomy and satisfaction, mortality and costs.
Evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability of the interventions and trial design was undertaken using
questionnaires and group discussions with participants and health-care professionals involved in the study.
Results
The systematic review identified that studies on MODs are largely of poor quality and that the evidence
regarding the effects of MODs is contradictory. The majority of studies reported adherence but no health
outcomes. Those studies reporting both adherence and health outcomes did not unequivocally report a
positive relationship; some studies reported increased hospitalisation associated with MODs. No study
reported any humanistic outcomes such as health-related quality of life.
The literature searches determined the validated tools that would be used for assessing patient functional
ability and identified three potential candidates for EAM during the RCT element of the feasibility study.
However, none of these manufacturers was able to produce a working version in the duration of
the study.
The pre-trial focus groups largely considered the proposed trial design feasible and acceptable, the three
MODs selected were Nomad™ (Surgichem Ltd, Cheshire, UK), Nomad XL™ (Surgichem Ltd, Cheshire, UK)
and Venalink™ (Venalink, Flintshire, UK). Disparity between the focus groups and literature was greatest
regarding the minimum age for patient recruitment, with the suggested minimum age ranging from
50 years (health-care professionals) to 75 years (literature). Furthermore, pharmacists reported that the
frequency with which MODs are initiated increases from the age of 70 years. The RCT element of the
feasibility study retained the 75 years threshold that was determined a priori.
Active recruitment yielded a higher consent rate but passive recruitment was more cost-effective at a cost
of £2528 and £506 per participant recruited, respectively. The most significant attrition during recruitment
was at the stage of determining eligibility for electronic medication adherence monitoring, which excluded
64.9% of the potentially eligible sample, followed by ineligibility because patients already used a MOD,
which removed 45.6% from the remaining sample.
The prevalence of intentional non-adherence was 24.7% (95% CI 19.7% to 29.6%). Of the remaining
76 participants, 46.1% (95% CI 34.8% to 57.3%) were unintentionally non-adherent after 3 weeks of
monitoring. The population was not cognitively impaired and the majority had adequately corrected vision.
Manual dexterity varied, with 41.4% (95% CI 23.4% to 59.3%) having poorer function than normative
values for their age and sex.
Mean adherence over the 8-week monitoring period exceeded 95% for all study arms and there was
no indication of a difference between the study arms. Similarly, the post-trial participant questionnaire
identified a relatively high level of satisfaction with all trialled methods and frequency of medication supply.
The majority of participants and carers reported no change in confidence and autonomy. There was no
indication of a difference between study arms in any of these outcomes. Five adverse events (AEs) or serious
adverse events were identified in the MOD study arms, compared with none in the usual packaging arms.
These comprised three falls, one hypoglycaemic episode and one temporary incapacitation.

 Data to estimate health economic outcomes were successfully collected from participants and health and
social care organisations. There was no discernible difference between the four study arms; the mean
intervention cost was £20 per month greater for MOD monthly relative to usual supply monthly. Given
the lower cost of monthly usual care, it dominated other study arms.
Conclusions
l
Medication organisation devices were initiated for participants identified as unintentionally non-adherent
and are widely used in routine practice for this purpose. The AEs observed in the MOD arms indicate that
they may be associated with an increase in medication dose-related AEs.
l
As a feasibility study, the implications for a future study are that maintaining the minimum recruitment
age at 75 years resulted in over one-third of patients being ineligible for study participation because
they already used a MOD. It is clear, therefore, that a subsequent study must have a lower age
threshold in order to include participants of the age at which MODs are initiated in usual care. The
ethical restriction of being unable to recruit patients already receiving a MOD means that the patients
most likely to demonstrate benefit may have been excluded. It is therefore likely that the results of this
feasibility study and any definitive trial provide a conservative estimate of any MOD benefits.
l
Electronically monitoring adherence in the usual-care environment remains a technological challenge.
l
Recruitment using invitation letters is more cost-effective than personal recruitment by researchers.
Recommendations for research
1. The relationship between MODs and AEs requires further exploration as adherence may not be the
most appropriate primary outcome measure; a health outcome such as quality of life or health and
social care use may be more appropriate.
2. A trial fully examining the costs and effects of MODs (both positive and negative) is necessary. Such
a study should stratify participants by history of hospital admissions or by health and social care use.
3. Further work to develop an EAM system compatible with usual medication packaging is necessary.
4. The relationship between MODs, medication adherence and health outcomes requires
further investigation.

  Chapter 1 Introduction
Background
Approximately 50% of patients do not take their prescribed medication as recommended by the
prescriber,1 with researchers most commonly describing such behaviours as either unintentional or
intentional. Unintentional non-adherence is not the result of any conscious decision by patients not to take
their medication, and has been associated with impaired cognitive function and practical problems such
as difficulty accessing medication from its packaging or swallowing the dosage form, while intentional
non-adherence, a conscious decision to deviate from their prescribed regimen, is associated with patients’
beliefs and their experience of the medicine. As these definitions seem superficially distinct, it is argued
that unintentional reasons, such as forgetting to take medication, may actually represent a subconscious
decision to not prioritise medication taking and, therefore, is actually largely intentional in its origins. While
intentional non-adherence is addressed through effective communication, psychological interventions and
selecting therapies which are more patient acceptable, unintentional non-adherence requires interventions
which act as memory cues or overcome physical barriers to medicine taking.
Medication organisation devices (MODs) are medical devices intended to address unintentional non-adherence1–3
by enabling patients to identify whether they have or have not taken their medicines and by enhancing the
accessibility of the medicine. MODs are known by a wide range of terms, including monitored dosage system,
multicompartment compliance aid and domiciliary dosage system (DDS), but all have similar design features.
MODs comprise either a rigid pill box or semi-rigid blister pack, divided into days of the week, with several
compartments per day to allow for the different timing of doses. Medicines are placed in the appropriate
locations in the box or pack, which are clearly empty once the medicine has been removed. Figure 1 provides
examples of MODs commonly used within the NHS in the UK. The Nomad Clear™ (Surgichem Ltd, Cheshire,
UK) device has the 7 days of the week marked across the top with different dosage times down the left-hand
side and therefore provides 1 week’s medication at a time. The Venalink™ (Venalink, Flintshire, UK) system, by
contrast, provides the days of the week down the left-hand side and dosage times across the top.
It has been estimated that 100,000 people are currently using MODs in the UK3 to reduce unintentional
non-adherence and, therefore, MODs potentially play an important role in ensuring that patients receive
the full benefit from their medication. Non-adherence to prescribed therapy is one of the factors believed
to contribute to decisions to transfer patients from their own homes into care homes. Consequently,
MODs may additionally play a pivotal role in maintaining patients in their own home and prolonging their
autonomy, which is in accordance with government targets to promote independence.4

 The national pharmacy contract provides for MODs supplied in accordance with the Equality Act.5 In such
cases, provision of medicines in MODs is deemed a reasonable adjustment for those individuals who, as a
result of disability, are unable to safely take their medicines without such a device. Great variation in NHS
funding of MOD provision exists, and in some localities MOD provision by pharmacists is commissioned
using NHS funds, whereas in other localities where there are no such arrangements they are provided at
the expense of the patient.
Despite the current disparity, existing evidence is insufficient to underpin the decision-making to either
discontinue NHS funding of MODs or provide clear guidance to practitioners regarding their initiation.6,7
The few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that have been conducted have been limited by small sample
sizes or insufficient data to characterise the sample population or have focused on a specific disease area.
It has been estimated that £23M is being spent annually on a non-evidence-based intervention. The
National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme, therefore,
requested that a study be conducted to identify the most appropriate methodological approach to test the
effect of MODs compared with usual packaging in older patients.
The absence of adequate large-scale studies means that there is a need to identify the most appropriate
participants, to characterise participants, to select the most appropriate MOD and to define standard care
and the intervention itself, while identifying and measuring the right outcomes, optimising recruitment and
estimating variation in the primary outcome measure to power a definitive study. These different issues
are, therefore, considered in turn.
Participant identification
A key consideration is to target patients who are unintentionally non-adherent. Considerable research
has been conducted in order to establish the predictors of non-adherence and, while there is still much
uncertainty, a positive association between magnitude of non-adherence and regimen complexity has
been frequently reported.8–12 Research suggests that older patients are prescribed an average of three
regular medications; thus, a large proportion of the older population has at least one risk factor for
non-adherence. It is, therefore, patients prescribed multiple medications who are at the greatest risk
of non-adherence and to whom MODs are most frequently provided (Sharma S, Malik W, Shah A,
Desborough J, Bhattacharya D, University of East Anglia, 2007, unpublished data).
Intentional non-adherence is associated with numerous factors such as beliefs about medicines13 and the
quality of the patient–prescriber relationship.14–16 The proportion of non-adherence that is attributable to
intentional factors varies, usually ranging from 4% to 17%,15,17 but with figures as high as 37% reported
in older people.18 Owing to the high proportion of patients whose non-adherence is intentional, it is
important that this behaviour is excluded from any trial involving MODs which is designed to address
unintentional non-adherence. Furthermore, the provision of medicines in single compartments of an MOD
makes differentiating between medications challenging for the patient, thereby reducing the ability of
patients to choose which medications to take and not take. Such a situation may result in intentionally
non-adherent patients omitting to take all medication stored in a MOD compartment.15
Categorising non-adherence as intentional or unintentional can only be achieved by establishing the
motivation for the deviation. A number of self-report tools have been developed to identify intentional
non-adherence.
Therefore, this study proposed to identify the prevalence of intentional non-adherence in older people who
are receiving polypharmacy regimes using a range of self-report tools, with a view to identifying a suitable
tool and cut-off threshold to be used to exclude intentionally non-adherent participants from a
definitive study.

 Participant characterisation
Once an unintentionally non-adherent patient has been identified, reasons for his or her non-adherence
need to be considered to ensure that these are taken into account when choosing a MOD and are also
assessed as part of any evaluation to allow for confounding.19 The most commonly reported factors that
impair patients’ ability to adhere to their prescribed regimen are deficits of cognitive function, manual
dexterity and visual acuity.6 Although no clear relationship has been demonstrated between adherence
and age, the prevalence of factors known to contribute to unintentional non-adherence increases
as individuals age. An Australian survey of older patients (n = 120), with a mean age of 81.8 years,
characterised participants in terms of cognitive function and visual acuity and then assessed ability to
open a variety of commercially produced medication packaging. It was reported that 78.3% of participants
were unable to open one or more of the medication packages in order to access the medication, with
inability to access medication significantly associated with lower cognitive function and manual dexterity.20
For trial purposes, the use of measures that can be replicated is necessary and, therefore, when available,
the use of validated measures to test cognitive and functional ability is desirable.
Medication organisation device selection
In the absence of guidance, MODs are currently initiated to a wide range of patients with varying degrees
of confusion. A survey of 10 purposively sampled pharmacists reported that eight would select a MOD
without involving the patient in the decision-making and all pharmacists had a preferred MOD, thus
suggesting that patient needs would not be the primary driver of MOD selection.3 A larger survey of 105
pharmacists reported that pharmacists perceived that checking patients’ ability to use a MOD was the most
important factor when considering whether or not to provide a patient with a MOD; however, it did not
suggest that patients were actually being given a choice of MODs to select from.
Commercially available MODs are produced by different manufacturers and, consequently, vary
considerably in terms of their size and method of medication access.6 Systems used in pharmacies are
sealed once the medication has been dispensed into them and are designed to be tamper evident. Some
commercially available devices which are usually filled by the patient or carers, for example Dosett™
(Swereco, Stockholm, Sweden),21 are not funded by the NHS.
The ideal study, in line with best current practice, should allow participants to select the type of MOD they
believe best meets their needs in discussion with the pharmacist.
Defining standard care
Medication organisation devices are heat-moulded (often) lidded plastic trays with wells, each sufficient in
size to take multiple solid oral dose forms (SODFs) configured in four (labelled with times of the day) by
seven (labelled with days of the week) format. They are intended to target unintentional non-adherence1–3
by providing medication in packaging which acts as a memory aid and which enhances accessibility for the
patient. They come in a number of shapes and sizes and it was important to identify MODs acceptable to
participants and to fit the NIHR research remit.
A number of factors have been cited as the rationale for MODs supporting adherence, including providing
medicine storage which is easily accessible to the patient; reducing the complexity of adhering to a regimen;
minimising dose amount and timing errors; and acting as a memory aid. A further benefit may be the
weekly dispensing, which results in greater contact with the pharmacy team or a carer by virtue of
the medication being supplied on a weekly rather than the more usual monthly basis. Research has
demonstrated that reducing monitoring frequency from weekly to fortnightly reduces adherence to therapy
and, therefore, it may follow that reducing medication supply frequency may have a similar effect.22

 It is possible that the beneficial effect thought to be associated with MODs could be obtained by dispensing
medicine supplies in standard packaging (increasingly blister packs) and supplying at weekly intervals.
The MOD is, therefore, a two-component intervention: weekly supply and an aide-mémoire. Clearly,
weekly supply in standard containers is cheaper than weekly supply in a MOD, and it is important to
quantify the relative contribution of these two components of the intervention (the container and the
dispensing frequency) to any observed improved adherence.
Outcomes
Adherence measurement
Studies of MODs have frequently focused on a specific disease, with a single therapeutic outcome or
detection of particular chemicals in body fluids being used as a measure of adherence. Thus, little guidance
is available to guide targeting of the wider population of patients for MODs in routine practice. Historically,
direct measures of adherence, such as observation and detection of chemicals in bodily fluids, have been
considered the gold standard. Observation clearly has significant cost implications for large-scale studies
and is subject to the Hawthorne effect. Detection of chemicals in body fluids has the merit of being
objective; however, it can be invasive and costly, and there remains the potential for patients to alter their
medication-taking behaviour in the days prior to sample provision. Some of the disadvantages associated
with observation as an adherence measure are exemplified by a trial which randomised patients to receive
potassium supplementation or placebo tablets.23 Measurement of urine potassium levels identified a
reduction over time, which was most likely attributable to reduced patient compliance with 24-hour urine
sample collection as the trial progressed; hence measured potassium levels were artificially low. The taking
of blood samples would overcome the issues of patient compliance with inconvenient 24-hour urine
samples; however, the acceptability to patients of frequent blood samples is even lower and has been
demonstrated to adversely affect trial recruitment, with 52% of patients not consenting to trial
participation, citing fear of phlebotomy.24 An additional problem associated with such direct measures is
intra- and interpatient variability in drug handling. This can be overcome to a certain extent by estimating
individual variation in drug handling via repeated samples over a short period of time; however, this type
of invasive assessment has low patient acceptability. Alternatively, Bayesian methodology can be used;
however, this is complex and again provides only an estimate of variability.
The dosage unit count (DUC) is generally accepted as the pragmatic approach to adherence assessment.
It is based on the assumption that, if the medication is not in the container, it has been taken by the
patient. This is problematic when attempting to identify intentional non-adherence because patients may
deliberately remove and discard tablets in order to disguise non-adherence. However, the assumption is
valid if patients are predominantly unintentionally non-adherent. Previous research has demonstrated that
use of the DUC method in the older patient population is feasible and acceptable.15
More recently, electronic adherence monitoring (EAM) systems have enabled objective measurement of
medication adherence that is less susceptible to the Hawthorne effect by virtue of being less intrusive and
less conspicuous to the patient than direct adherence measures or DUC. The most widely used EAM
system is the Medication Event Monitoring System™ (MWV Healthcare, Richmond, VA, USA). The
Medication Event Monitoring System is a bottle thats cap contains a microprocessor that records the
date and time of each bottle opening event; it has been widely used in clinical trials to assess medication
adherence.12,23,25,26 Trials have, therefore, generally approached objective adherence monitoring by
decanting medication from usual packaging to the monitoring bottles. This has the limitation of not
assessing adherence in a naturalistic setting, as usual dispensing is now routinely in manufacturer-issued
blister packaging. A number of EAM systems are under development, and a 2-month pilot study (n = 52)
of one EAM system to assess feasibility and acceptability for usual-care blister packaging reported
promising results. Adherence data were obtained from 94.3% of participants and 67.4% of participants
reported that they would consider using the EAM system for a long-term study.27 Therefore, it was
INTRODUCTION

 proposed that bespoke versions of an EAM system be evaluated to determine whether or not an EAM
system can enable medication-taking events from MODs and ‘usual-care’ blister packs to be objectively
and accurately recorded and compared.
Cost-effectiveness
In addition to assessing whether or not MOD provision affects adherence to medication regimes, it will be
important to assess whether or not it confers health or economic benefits. Measures to detect changes
in the utilisation of health or social services will be put in place and tested to determine utility for a
definitive study.
Patient autonomy
In addition to the impact of MODs on adherence, it is important to establish patient acceptability.
No studies have reported the impact of MODs on patient autonomy or ability to manage one’s own
medication; however, there is anecdotal evidence of reduced autonomy, as patients are unable to
differentiate one medication from another when medicines are packed in MODs and, therefore, cannot
choose to omit a single type of medication if they so desire (e.g. to delay taking a diuretic when
embarking on a long journey), sometimes resulting in the omission of all doses.1 Conversely, patients may
report that they feel enabled by feeling confident about managing their medication. A number of studies
have explored patient autonomy with respect to medication taking in the context of describing the extent
to which patients feel involved in the decision-making process.28–30 However, exploration of whether or not
patients feel as though they have some control over the medication-taking process is limited. Development
of a tool to assess the impact of MODs on patients’ confidence in their ability to manage their own
medication, on their satisfaction with their packaging and the service they receive was included. Carers
and relatives are closely involved in the daily lives of older people with multiple comorbidities and,
therefore, it is also important to assess the impact of providing MODs to older people on their carers or
close relatives. An additional tool to determine carer perceptions of the impact of medicine packaging on
patients’ confidence and their ability to manage their medicines and effects on the resource provided by
carers and relatives was also included.
Patient medication administration errors
Studies evaluating patient medication administration errors have cited access to extra medication as a
source of errors and, therefore, reducing the amount of medication to which a patient has access may also
be a further source of error reduction.31 For the duration of the study it was important for participants to
have access only to the new stock of drugs supplied to them. Therefore, development of an appropriate
process to ensure that errors in compliance could not be attributed to extra medication was included.
General dispensing and administration errors
The most substantial review to date of errors associated with MOD use was conducted in Australia; the
Australian Incident Monitoring Study31 reported that 0.43% (52 out of 12,000) of medication-related
errors were associated with MODs. In 26 cases, there was a problem with filling the MOD, such as wrong
dose, dose omission or wrong medication. In 21 of these cases, nursing staff were responsible for the
error, with the remainder being attributable to pharmacy staff or a carer. On 16 occasions problems using
the MOD were cited as a reason for an error; however, the nature of these problems was not reported.
Factors contributing to the reported problems included patient confusion/distraction and the MOD
being inappropriate for the patient.31 A further Australian audit32 of dispensing errors associated with
6972 dispensed MODs detected an error rate of 4.3%.32
A 2007 UK evaluation of dispensing error rate associated with the pharmacy usual dispensing process33
reported 1.7% content errors out of 2859 dispensed items. Content errors were errors of omission,
incorrect drug, incorrect strength, incorrect dosage form, added or missing dose units and expired
medication. A similar US-based study conducted in 2003 reported an identical 1.7% error rate.33 While
general dispensing error rates are 1.7%, there are no UK data for MOD error rates and, therefore,
it is necessary to record error rates for dispensing into both MODs and usual packaging.

 In summary, comparative data in terms of error rate associated with MODs and usual dispensing are not
available. Data regarding the incidence of dispensing errors associated with usual dispensing are available,
but may not be generalisable to prescriptions assembled for an older population with more multiple items.
A reasonable estimate of error rate requires a large sample size and significant resources. Within a
relatively small-scale feasibility study it is, therefore, only appropriate to test tools designed to collect error
data and to quantify and describe any identified errors.
Recruitment strategies
While recruitment via medical practice invitation letters is convenient in terms of research administration,
response rates have historically been low, as the method requires the patient to be proactive in responding to
a letter invitation – consent rates are frequently between 30% and 40%.16,34 Waiting room recruitment by
researcher, while more labour intensive, and thus costly, has yielded substantially higher response rates.35–38
Identification of the most cost-effective approach to recruitment is, therefore, required within any
feasibility study.
Summary
Despite the large amount of both NHS and private funds devoted to MODs, evidence of their effectiveness
and cost-effectiveness is limited, as indicated by a Department of Health-commissioned literature review
conducted by Bhattacharya.6 A 2006 Cochrane review7 concluded that MODs may improve adherence
‘with selected conditions examined to date’; however, further research is necessary to improve targeting.
In order to achieve this, the impact of MODs on a more heterogeneous population needs to
be established.
Preliminary work to determine the feasibility of conducting such a trial is required. An approach to
measuring adherence which minimises the Hawthorne effect and which is discrete and compatible with
both MODs and usual care needs to be identified from the potentially suitable EAM systems becoming
available. The effect of MODs on patient autonomy requires consideration to ensure that the intervention
is acceptable to patients. The potential for increasing dispensing errors because of the additional
complexity of dispensing into MODs also requires consideration, as does the identification of the most
appropriate method of recruitment. Finally, MODs are designed to address unintentional non-adherence
and are a method for identifying and differentiating between different types of non-adherence
requires development.
This feasibility study to determine the optimal design of a trial testing the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of MODs was carried out in two main phases. The first was the determination of
optimal design features and identification of features that require testing for feasibility and acceptability.
The second was the trial of this design and review of the procedures to further refine the trial design.
The initial RCT design was refined as a result of a systematic review and pre-trial focus groups. Post-trial
focus groups of patient and health-care professional participants were used to further refine the design of
the trial and to determine feasibility and acceptability. Findings and recommendations are presented in the
following chapters.

 Chapter 2 Systematic review
Rationale
The NIHR funded this feasibility study to design a definitive study to determine the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of MODs based, in part, on a recent systematic review conducted by Mahtani et al.
in 2011.39 The review concluded that findings from one favourable study are not sufficient to justify the
allocation of NHS resources on MODs. In addition to this, the study focused on adherence rather than on
the social and economic aspects important to the design of a definitive study. Therefore, under this study,
the review was updated with respect not only to adherence but also to informing a definitive study with
respect to key social and economic factors.
Objectives
The objectives of this systematic review were to identify and update the current evidence for the impact
of MODs on adherence, health and humanistic and economic outcomes in patients self-administering
prescribed medicines compared with usual packaging to inform a definitive study.
Methods
The protocol for this systematic review was registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42011001718).
Article selection
Inclusion criteria
Studies were eligible for inclusion when they met the following criteria.
Population
Patients, of any age, with any medical condition, in any setting and self-administering medication, where
‘self-administered’ is defined as medication taken by patients (with or without help from a carer) and
where medical staff are not directly responsible for administration.
Interventions
Medication supplied in a MOD, packed by a health-care professional, a carer, the patient or a manufacturing
company. MODs were defined as any container which permits patient or pharmacy placement of multiple
solid oral dose medicines into wells arranged by time and/or date and with room for at least seven
days’ medication.
Comparator
Standard care and standard packaging only. No comparator is necessary for descriptive data regarding
the number of errors, or the monetary or time costs associated with filling MODs.

 In addition to formal searching of the above databases, searching was augmented via:
l
keyword searches in the Google Scholar™ search engine (http://scholar.google.com)
l
hand-searching of reference lists of included articles
l
hand-searching of identified review articles
l
hand-searching of reference lists of articles relevant to the project but excluded because of exclusion
criteria (e.g. compared MODs to non-standard care, used additional interventions or measured
adherence only via self-report)
l
personal communication with packaging companies
l
personal communication with research groups with an expertise in adherence.
Study selection
Titles and abstracts of all identified articles were screened for relevance by two reviewers (CA, LC, EP or TB)
with any disagreements resolved by discussion. When agreement could not be reached, a third reviewer
moderated the final decision. Full-text articles were similarly screened by two reviewers (CA, EP or TB).
In the case of articles identified as potentially relevant after full-text screening, data were independently
extracted by two reviewers (EP and SW), with any differences resolved by discussion. Authors conducting
the review were not blinded to any element of the identified articles.
Data collection process
Data were extracted independently by two reviewers (EP and SW) using a standardised Microsoft Excel
(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) spreadsheet. Table 1 provides a summary of the data that
were extracted to the spreadsheet.
Source of funding
Sources of funding were examined to identify any potential conflict of interest.
Risk of bias
Risk of bias was assessed using items from the Cochrane risk of bias tool (randomisation procedure,
concealment of allocation, blinding of assessors, blinding of treatment providers, whether or not attrition
was variable between groups and how this was accounted for, whether or not all outcomes were
reported, and whether or not there were any other clear threats to validity) as appropriate to the study
design. When the study design did not permit randomisation or blinding of assessors, it was noted that
such designs have greater risk of bias.
Summary measures
Meta-analysis was intended where measures were consistently reported across trials; however, owing
to a lack of comparability, none was performed. Results are tabulated and described according to
study outcomes.

 Results
Study selection
A total of 8122 studies were identified. After automatic removal of duplicates, 5100 articles were
screened. Following this, 272 articles were retained for full-text screening. Three authors (CA, EP and TB)
assessed these texts for eligibility and 10 articles were included. Screening of identified review articles and
included articles, and those retrieved for detailed review, identified a further 40 potentially relevant studies,
which yielded an additional six studies. A flow diagram summarising this process is detailed in Figure 2.
No studies declared any conflict of interest.
Overview of studies
A summary of included studies is shown in Table 2. Of the 16 included studies, seven were undertaken in
the USA, five in the UK and four in Australia and New Zealand. Six of the 10 non-US studies were
identified via augmented searching, indicating a possible US bias in the availability of articles via
academic databases.

 Eight studies were conducted in 2000 or later, and the majority were in domiciliary settings (n = 12).
Seven studies did not target a specific illness and the remaining studies targeted hypertension,3 diabetes
mellitus, mental health, cancer and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. One study44 examined
the effect of MODs on dispensing procedures only. Nine studies were RCTs. Two studies were audits and
so did not assess any adherence behaviour.31,32 The combined population from all the studies was 1541.
The type and number of MODs assessed varied across studies. Unsealed reusable MODs were used in
five studies40,42,49,52,54 and pre-sealed units were used in five studies;42,44,50 in five studies,31,43,45,50,51 the seal
type was not specified. One study52 used multiple types of MODs.
Only one study used patient-filled MODs,2 although in Feetam and Kelly42 it was unclear who filled
the MODs. In other studies, the units were filled before being supplied to the patient by researchers
in one study,43 were filled by an automatic filling device in one study,40 were filled by community nurses in
one study51 and were filled by unspecified professionals in the remaining studies. McElnay and Thompson44
timed the filling of MODs by five pharmacists and a pharmacy technician.
Figure 3 provides the number of studies published over each 5-year period. It can be seen that the
frequency of relevant studies has dramatically increased over the past 10 years.
Risk of bias
There was considerable risk of bias in many studies, which is summarised in Table 3. Only three of the
nine RCT studies included information on randomisation,2,43,49 and none mentioned blinding. Other risks
of bias identified included baseline differences between groups not accounted for in analysis,40,53 minimal
participant information42,52 and minimal information on analysis.42 Levings et al.31 performed an audit of
errors reported in the Australian Incident Monitoring Study and noted that some types of errors may be
more likely to be reported than others (e.g. overdose). It is therefore difficult to determine whether or not
the errors identified are representative of all errors. McElnay and Thompson44 determined the time taken
to fill MODs, but they used fictional patients with only three medicines which may have led to an
underestimation of the actual time required to fill.

 Effects of medication organisation devices
Medication adherence
Eight studies from seven papers estimated the effect of MODs on adherence.40,41,43,45,46,52 Seven of these
studies were RCTs.2,40,41,43,46,52 These studies are presented in Table 4. All studies estimated adherence via
pill count, with additional electronic monitoring for patients who were not using a MOD in one study.45
Of the eight studies, four40,45,46,52 suggested improved adherence in the MOD group. Owing to overall
heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not possible.
Becker et al.40 found that 84% of participants took > 80% of their medicines when supplied with a
foil-sealed blister pack MOD (time and day to take medicines on the back), compared with only 75.3%
of participants without a MOD, but this difference was not statistically significant.
Petersen et al.45 tracked a cohort of 269 HIV-infected patients between 1998 and 2005, of whom 163
were given a MOD according to clinical need. The effects of MODs on adherence were estimated via
bootstrap sampling with double robust estimation to compensate for the lack of random allocation.
MODs increased adherence by 4.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1% to 7.1%].
Rehder et al.,46 in a study of patients with hypertension, showed that patients supplied with their
medication in a Mediset™ MOD (Health Care Logistics, Circleville, OH, USA) were more adherent than
those supplied with medication in a safety-capped vial. Of patients who received their medication in a
Mediset™, 89% took more than 95% of their pills ,compared with 47% of those who received their
medication in vials (the overall proportion of medicines taken was 95% compared with 87%, respectively).
In a crossover trial with older patients receiving either standard care or separate pre-sealed blister packs
with doses required for each meal time (analogous to MODs), Wong and Norman52 found that patients
in the blister group omitted to take fewer doses than in the usual-care group (2.04% with the MOD vs.
9.17% with standard care; p < 0.01).
Two studies found that the MOD had no effect on adherence.2,41 In a study conducted by Crome et al.,41
participants provided with medicines in weekly blister strips with the date and time for taking the dose on
the back (C-Pak™, manufacturer information not available; analogous to a MOD) missed 26.1% of doses,
compared with 26.2% of doses missed by participants receiving standard care.
Similarly, Huang2 found that participants taking vitamins from patient-filled MODs (one box/day) had a
median adherence of 100% of pills taken in the MOD group (91% took > 90% of their medicines) and
a median of 99% pills taken in the comparison group (94% took > 90% of their medicines). When they
repeated this on a second cohort, median adherence was 99% for both groups but the proportion of
patients achieving > 90% adherence was significantly lower in the MOD group than in the comparison
group (87% vs. 93% respectively).
One other study also suggested poorer or equivalent adherence in the MOD group. In a study of patients
taking capecitabine for breast or gastrointestinal cancer,43 adherence was generally high, with only 3 out
of 24 of those in their first cycle and 4 out of 18 in their second cycle not 100% adherent. In a subsample
of 21 participants taking part in a crossover design for a MOD (7-day container with exact doses for
morning and evening) versus standard pill vials, a difference between groups of 81% in the MOD group
versus 86% in the control group was not significant and amounted to only one participant not achieving
perfect adherence in the MOD group (p = 1).

 Health outcomes
Seven studies from six papers,40,45,46,49,53 including four RCTs,2,40,45,49,53 estimated the impact of MODs on
health outcomes and are presented in Table 5. Three studies measured blood pressure changes,40,42,46 one
vitamin serum levels,2 one viral load45 and one adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and patient function.53
Of the three studies measuring changes in blood pressure, only one suggested a positive impact.40,46,49
Simmons et al.,49 in a study of patients with diabetes mellitus, found a significant reduction in diastolic
blood pressure and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the MOD group compared with the standard care
group. However, the reduction in systolic blood pressure was not significantly different between the
groups. Becker et al.40 did not find that use of a MOD impacted on diastolic blood pressure when change
in blood pressure was controlled for baseline and pre-enrolment blood pressure measures, and age.
Rehder et al.46 did not report values for the impact of MODs on systolic blood pressure but noted that the
difference was not statistically significant, and estimation of changes in diastolic blood pressure from
graphical data showed an increase of 5 mmHg in the intervention group and 6 mmHg in the
control group.
Huang et al.2 found that use of patient-filled MODs did not significantly affect serum vitamin C levels
[mean reduction –0.9 mg/dl (95% CI –3.4 mg/dl to 1.6 mg/dl) in the Trial of Antioxidant Vitamins C and E
(TRACE) cohort; mean increase 0.9 mg/dl (95% CI –2.0 mg/dl to 3.8 mg/dl) in the Vitamins, Teachers, and
Longevity (VITAL) cohort] or serum vitamin E levels [mean reduction –2.4 mg/dl (95% CI –4.8 mg/dl to
0.00 mg/dl) in the TRACE study].
The study by Peterson et al.45 in patients with HIV suggested the benefit of MODs, as indicated by a mean
reduction of 0.36 log10 copies/ml (95% CI 0.09 to 0.63 log10 copies/ml) in the MOD group compared
with the standard care and an odds ratio for the increase in the proportion of participants with a viral load
below 400 copies/ml of 1.91 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.90).
The study by Roberts53 in older people also suggested that MODs provide benefit, especially when filled by
pharmacists. Fewer ADRs were reported when pharmacist-filled MODs were used (32.56%, compared with
43.24% for non-pharmacist-filled MODs or 47.79% for no MODs). Participant ability was assessed using
the Older Americans Resource Scale for Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (OARS-IADL). Overall, these
ratings were considered to be high in all groups on average, but patients who were supplied with a MOD
by a pharmacist had significantly lower abilities scores with a mean [standard error (SE)] score of 10.45
(SE 0.24) out of 14, compared with 12.70 (SE 0.39) for patients who were supplied with a MOD by a
non-pharmacist and 12.34 (SE 0.19) for patients who did not have a MOD. However, the direction of
effect between MODs impacting on participant ability versus participant ability impacting on the decision
to prescribe a MOD cannot be determined in this study.

 Health-care utilisation
Table 6 summarises the studies examining the effects of MODs on health-care utilisation. It can be seen
that this potential effect was explored in only three studies.48,50,53
Ryan-Woolley and Rees48 found that after 3 months the number of general practitioner (GP) visits was
higher in the MOD group than in the standard care group [1.5 (range 1–3) vs. 1.3 (range 0–3) GP visits,
respectively; p = 0.070], but that the mean number of medicines prescribed was lower [4.2 (range 2–9)
vs. 4.8 (range 2–8 ) medicines per patient, respectively]. These values were more similar at baseline
[4.5 (range 1–10) vs. 4.6 (range 1–9) medicines per patient, respectively].
Skaer et al.50 found non-statistically significant reductions in physicians’ costs (–US$32.85), laboratory costs
(–US$3.06) and hospital costs (–US$25.92), which led to provision of MODs resulting in a non-statistically
significant reduction in overall costs of approximately US$13.66 per person.
Roberts53 found that the mean (SE) number of different doctors visited was lower in the group supplied
with a pharmacist-filled MOD than in the group not supplied with a MOD [2.02 (SE 0.01) vs. 2.41
(SE 0.12) different doctors visited]. However, the number of different doctors visited by patients with
non-pharmacist-supplied MODs was 2.91 (SE 0.22). Considering only the last 2 months of the study, the
number of doctors visited was lower both for patients with pharmacist-supplied MODs [2.54 (SE 0.16)]
and for those with non-pharmacist supplied MODs [2.05 (SE 0.33)] than for those without a MOD [3.05
(SE 0.22)]. Patients receiving MODs from their pharmacist required more hospitalisations [1.34 (SE 0.14)]
than those receiving a non-pharmacist MOD [0.56 (SE 0.14)] or those without a MOD [0.78 (SE 0.11) ].
Similarly, the proportion of patients hospitalised was higher among those with a pharmacist MOD than
among those not receiving a MOD or those receiving a non-pharmacist MOD (59.54% vs. 42.34% and
35.14%, respectively).
Dispensing errors
Only three studies investigated the frequency of dispensing errors.31,32,53 There was little consistency of
findings because of differences in definition and methods.
Carruthers et al.32 found errors in 4.3% of Webster-paks™ audited by local health authority staff
(297 errors in total from all audited 6972 packs). Of these, the most common reason was omission of a
medicine (99 out of 297; 33.3%). Other reasons were supplying a discontinued medicine (37 out of 279),
wrong strength (32 out of 297), incorrect instructions (32 out of 297), failure to deliver medicines (13 out
of 297), wrong medicine (12 out of 297) and wrong label (7 out of 297). Errors occurred most commonly
in pharmacies (125 out of 297).
In a smaller study of only 190 observations, and regardless of packer role (pharmacist, dispensary assistant
or pre-registration pharmacy student), Roberts53 found a researcher-reported error rate for 44.7% of packs
compared with only 5.7% when reported by staff. It was suggested that, when observed, the packers
made more errors and also had a more stringent definition of errors. The most frequent causes were
omission of medication (39%), adding extra tablets that had not been prescribed (24%) and placing
tablets in the wrong compartment (12%). Higher error rates were associated with larger facilities, longer
duration of time spent packing (r = 0.342; p = 0.004) and interruptions (r = –0.337; p = 0.003).
Finally, Levings et al.31 audited the first 12,000 incidents reported in the Australian Incident Monitoring
Study and identified 52 incidents involving MODs (referred to in their study as dosette boxes). Of these,
50% occurred during filling. There was no reported denominator to allow estimation of an error rate.

 Supply procedures and costs
Four studies estimated the time taken to fill MODs,42,44,51,53 and two studied costs.42,53
Feetam and Kelly42 found that a Medidos™ MOD (Allied Health, Perth, UK) took an average of 3 minutes
to fill and 24 minutes to label.
In a simulated study involving five pharmacists and a pharmacy technician using medicines for five fictitious
patients, McElnay and Thompson44 compared six different MODs for time to fill, user preferences and
acceptability (Table 7). Extrapolated results suggest that an average time taken to fill a box would be
7 minutes per month (4 × 105 seconds) per patient, longer than for standard systems. The rank that
pharmacists gave ‘ease of filling’ matched the ranking given for fill time.
Roberts et al.53 identified that the time required to pack a MOD ranged from 3.2–8.6 minutes for large
packing operations to 14–18.5 minutes for small packing operations. Time spent checking MODs ranged
from 1.13–2.13 minutes for large operations to 3.01–8.61 minutes at small operations. Those filled using
automated packing systems took less time to pack (0.99 minutes), while blister packs (3.34 minutes) and
dosette boxes (10 minutes) took longer.
In a survey of 153 Scottish community nurses, 96 (63%) reported having experience of filling MODs.51 The
estimated average time for a nurse to fill one MOD was 34.2 minutes. The survey also identified concern
at the impact of this workload on their schedules, lack of any formal training (most had received no
training, 25% had received informal training) and lack of knowledge about which medicines could be
placed in the devices. Nearly 60% of the nurses felt that pharmacists should fill the compliance devices.
Feetam and Kelly42 also estimated the cost of supplying Medidos MODs for 6 months to be 10 pence per
week, compared with 21 pence per week for seven disposable bottles. Similarly, labelling was less
expensive (1 pence vs. 4 pence), as was time spent labelling and filling (16 pence vs. 24 pence). Overall, this
produced an estimated cost of 27 pence per week for a Medidos containing seven medicines, compared
with 49 pence per week for seven pill bottles. Conversely, Roberts et al.53 found that the annual cost of
original packaging (US$942.73) was less than that of a MOD (US$1859.00 per year).
Quality of life and social services utilisation
No studies were identified which measured the impact of MODs on quality of life or social
service utilisation.

 Summary
Overall, the studies were of poor quality and used a wide range of MODs, populations/conditions and
definitions and measures of adherence. No clear trend in any of the outcomes was observed. The reported
information suggested that screening of patients to only include those demonstrating unintentional
non-adherence was infrequent. For the outcomes of adherence, clinical improvement, health-care
utilisation, processing time and costs, there were studies suggesting both that MODs were beneficial
compared with standard care, and the converse. The review included studies published at any time, but
the first studies identified were in the 1980s, and there was a possible indication of most activity between
2000 and 2008. No studies were identified with a publication date later than 2008.
The search terms were developed in order to identify MODs in the form of a container organising at least
7 days of medicines together. This, therefore, excluded systems which organise medicines into individual
dosing times but do not arrange these into the days of the week as a fixed system. Systems such as
individual plastic pouches each containing all of the medicines that are prescribed to be taken at the same
time, such as the Unit Bag system1, were therefore excluded. This approach was adopted in order to
minimise the heterogeneity of the intervention.
As with any review, it is possible that relevant papers were not identified by our search strategy. However,
the search terms were inclusive and applied to relevant databases, reference lists of retrieved papers were
searched and hand-searching was undertaken. Contacting authors for additional information may have
further enhanced the data presented.
With respect to the individual studies, the biggest limitation was study design and inadequate reporting of
details to allow risk of bias to be fully assessed. In particular, without access to pre-study protocols it was
impossible to determine whether or not studies reported all intended outcomes.

  Chapter 3 The design phase
Introduction
Medical Research Council guidance for the development of complex interventions recommends that
feasibility and pilot work is undertaken prior to embarking on a definitive study.47 Feasibility studies are
‘pieces of research done before a main study and are used to estimate important parameters that are
needed to design the main study’55 and are used to determine the acceptability of an intervention,
measure demand for it, test its implementation and identify the most appropriate outcome measures with
respect to sensitivity and practicability.56 Feasibility studies are also used to determine the variance around
the outcome measure to enable power calculations to be performed for the final definitive trial.
A review of the literature is now widely accepted as an essential component of studies to inform trial
design. Systematic reviews offer the most rigorous methodological approach to identifying the existing
literature through collating all empirical evidence that fits pre-specified eligibility criteria. They use explicit
and systematic methods to minimise bias in answering a specific research question.57,58 Systematic reviews
are, however, resource intensive, whereas literature reviews offer a more rapid appraisal of existing
evidence and are appropriate for supplementing researcher expertise.
Although commonly associated with full trials, process evaluation is equally, if not more, important in a
feasibility study, especially when there are many unknown and to-be-determined variables, contexts and
design issues. In a feasibility study it is important to scrutinise and assess both the quantity and the quality
of what is proposed.59 Furthermore, qualitative research can be well utilised in order to assess many
aspects of why, how and in what context a specific aspect of a trial, or potential trial, works.60
This project aimed to define the optimum design of a study to trial the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
of MODs. Mixed quantitative and qualitative methods were used to develop and evaluate the study design,
as illustrated by Figure 4. The project comprised two phases:
l
Phase 1 – identifying the most appropriate design for a definitive study.
l
Phase 2 – investigating the acceptability of the design elements to trial participants and collaborators
using focus groups comprising patients, carers and health-care professionals from both primary and
secondary care sectors.
Phase 1: literature review to inform trial design
Method
A review of peer-reviewed and grey literature using appropriate search terms to identify existing
knowledge regarding the key design features was supplemented with expert opinion. The design elements
investigated were identification of appropriate participants; characterisation of participants’ cognitive,
manual and visual ability; selection of appropriate medication organisation devices; definition of standard
care and the intervention; objective adherence monitoring; optimum recruitment strategies; and a
suitable database.

 Results
Identification of appropriate participants
The chief investigator (DB) had previously conducted a literature review regarding the characteristics of
participants most likely to receive any benefit from a MOD, that is those patients at greatest risk of
unintentional non-adherence.6 The data from this literature review were used to generate the following
initial parameters for participant identification and supplementary searches were used where necessary
for further targeting.
Regimen complexity
Evidence suggests that patients who are prescribed multiple medications are at the greatest risk of
non-adherence. Norfolk Medicines Support Service is a locally commissioned service which includes a
patient home visit in order to establish the medicine-related support needs. The provision of a MOD is
a frequently used intervention, and three was reported to be the minimum number of SODFs usually
prescribed when a MOD is recommended, except when severe cognitive impairment has been identified.
Age
The funding brief for the study was to target older people. The National Service Framework for older
people defines older people as aged ≥ 65 years.4 However, UK wards specialising in medical care
for older people and the British Geriatric Society use 75 years as the lower age boundary.19
Unintentionally non-adherent
The MOD is intended to support unintentional non-adherence and thus it was essential to exclude patients
at risk of intentional non-adherence. The literature review identified a number of self-report tools for
identifying non-adherence; however, few provided sufficient information to distinguish between
intentional and unintentional non-adherence. The four-item Medication Adherence Questionnaire is the

most widely used self-report adherence measure, however, it demonstrates poor sensitivity and offers little

24
 Members of the study team (DB and SW) had previously developed and tested a questionnaire designed to
identify patients at risk of non-adherence. This questionnaire was informed by a meta-analysis of factors
related to adherence conducted by SW. The key factors for intentional non-adherence identified were
attitude towards prescribed therapy, patient–doctor relationship, risk-taking behaviour, perceived stress
and mental well-being.62 This questionnaire was a composite of validated tools and questions designed to
capture the key factors.
Characterisation of participants’ cognitive, manual and visual ability
An Ovid MEDLINE title search using the terms ‘adherence + cognit*’ with no other limitations yielded
109 articles. Duplicate removal and title screening identified 23 relevant articles. Excluded articles were
those describing cognitive therapy or adherence unrelated to medication taking, for example adherence to
diet. Abstract and full-text searching resulted in exclusion of a further 10 articles as follows: not English
language (n = 1), not cognitive impairment (n = 3), not primary research (n = 4) and children only (n = 2).
The remaining 13 articles fell into two groups: multiple measures and single measures of cognitive
function. Multiple measures, ranging from 4 to 19 items, to test a diverse range of cognitive abilities were
used in eight articles. While these provide a detailed profile of a patient’s cognitive function, they present
an excessive burden to the research participant, as this clinical level of detail is not required for the
purposes of characterising a research participant. Single measures of cognitive function were used by the
remaining five articles, the Dementia Rating Scale63 and the Trail Making Test64 were each used in one
study, and three used the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).65 The MMSE is an 11-item assessment
scale scored out of 30. Traditionally, cognitive impairment is defined as a score of ≤ 23, at which the
sensitivity is 83% and specificity 96%.66
Discussions held with an expert in upper arm and hand function identified that manual dexterity is a
composite of motor, sensory and visual skills. Commonly used tests of hand function with respect to
medication adherence are the Purdue tests, grooved tests and nine-hole peg tests (9-HPTs). The Purdue
pegboard is commonly used to assess the suitability of candidates for production line work when very high
levels of dexterity are required in assembling fine components. This test was considered unsuitable in the
context of personal pill taking.67 The grooved pegboard test comprises metal pegs which are akin to small
keys (30 mm long and 5 mm at their widest point) which must be rotated appropriately before insertion
into keyhole-like depressions arranged in a 5 × 5 array.68 The high visual requirement and very small pegs
make this test unsuitable for the study population, as has been demonstrated by previous work in this area
by Adams et al.69 The 9-HPT comprises nine plastic dowels (each 6 mm in diameter), which are slotted into
nine round holes arranged as a 3 × 3 array, and then removed from the holes. This test of finger dexterity
has been described as particularly appropriate for use by the very old and very young and is also simple
and quick to administer.70 Additionally, the pegs for this test have a short axis that is very similar to those
of tablets or capsules.
Visual skills required for successfully taking medication are those related to near vision only. Expert advice
indicated that the test should assign a text size threshold at habitual visual acuity, that is in usual lighting
conditions, at usual distance and using usual visual aids and that reading ability need not be assessed.
Bailey–Lovie reading cards fulfil this requirement.71
Selection of appropriate medication organisation devices
A survey of pharmacies to establish the MODs that are supplied had previously been undertaken by DB.
This identified three MODs most frequently used: dosette boxes, Nomad Clear and Venalink. Figure 5
provides the specification for each of these. The dossette box, although frequently recommended by
pharmacies, does not conform to recommendations for MOD characteristics as it is not a sealed unit; thus,
medicines dispensed into the MOD are not protected from water vapour and atmospheric gases.72 This
means that medicines dispensed in the MOD are at increased risk of degradation. The Nomad Clear and
Venalink are both sealed containers and thus afford greater protection to the medication. Furthermore,
it is recommended that MODs should have tamper-evident seals, which dosette boxes do not have.

 Nomad Clear is a lidded, clear rigid plastic tray of pre-formed compartments. It is cold sealed using a flat
plastic adhesive film through which pills are accessed. The film is labelled with days of the week and times
of the day and is perforated at the perimeter of each compartment to facilitate ease of access. Nomad
Clear XL™ (Surgichem Ltd, Cheshire, UK) is identical to Nomad Clear but, having larger compartments,
is better suited to those prescribed more medicines. The Venalin is a cold-sealed device which closely
represents blister packaging. It comprises a non-rigid plastic tray into which pills are dispensed. This
non-rigid tray is then inserted into a cardboard wallet labelled with days of the week and times of the
day and sealed using an opaque adhesive cover.
Defining standard care and the intervention
Expertise within the research team was used to define standard care and the intervention. Prescription
medication packaging of solid oral dose medications in the UK is largely 28-dosage units labelled with
the days of the week.
Research has demonstrated that reducing monitoring frequency from weekly to fortnightly reduces
adherence to therapy and, therefore, it may follow that reducing medication supply frequency may have
a similar effect.22 It is possible that the beneficial effect seen with MODs could be obtained by dispensing
medicine supplies in standard packaging (increasingly blister packs) and supplying at weekly intervals.
Primary outcome
The primary outcome measure, as stipulated by the funding agreement, was EAM. EAM overcomes the
problem of self-presentation bias which is associated with self-reported adherence. EAM may, however, be
susceptible to reactivity bias as the device used for EAM acts as a constant reminder of trial participation
and thus may alter usual patient medication-taking behaviour, resulting in artificially inflated adherence.73,74
Broad-ranging web-based searches were carried out to identify candidate objective adherence monitoring
technology and manufacturers were approached to determine whether or not they could supply
suitable technology for these purposes.
These searches identified that technological advances mean that it is now possible to objectively measure
adherence. This type of monitoring is less susceptible to the Hawthorne effect by virtue of being less
intrusive and less conspicuous to the patient than direct adherence measures or DUCs. Electronic
medication monitoring systems were initially developed as bottle-based systems containing a switch and
data logger in the cap. Such electronic medication monitoring systems have been widely used in clinical
trials to assess medication adherence.11,24–26 The data logger records the date and time of each bottle
opening event. However, usual dispensing is now generally in manufacturer issued packaging which is in
blister pack form. Trials have, therefore, generally approached this issue by decanting medication from

 usual packaging into the monitoring bottles. This has the limitation of not assessing adherence in a
naturalistic setting.
Similar technological principles have been applied to blister packs; however, there is a further challenge
to then translate this to electronic monitoring of manufacturer supplied blister packaging. There is no
standardisation to the size and shape of solid oral dosage forms; thus, there is a huge array of
different-sized and -shaped packaging.
The main requirements of an electronic monitoring system are that it is discrete, accurate and robust,
and consistent for both MODs and usual-care blister packaging; in addition, the comparator must look and
feel like usual care and the intervention should provide a good approximation of the intervention as it
would in a real setting.
A number of potential candidate technologies were identified for EAM of usual packaging and three
organisations were approached for information or to supply devices for the project [Med-ic MMD
Solution™, Qolpac b.v. NL and Future Technology (UK)].
Qolpac b.v. (NL) provides electronics-based e-health solutions. Its Objective Therapy Compliance
Monitoring (OtCM™, Qolpac, NL, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) system is a powered, single-circuit and
resistor-based system printed using silver or copper ink onto a clear plastic sticky-backed film which records
each time a blister seal is broken, assuming that this equates to ingestion. Data are downloaded to
computer software which records the blister position and time it was broken to within 10 seconds of the
actual time. Figure 6 shows a representation of the Qolpac b.v. OtCM system.

 Future Technology (UK) Ltd (Banbury, Oxfordshire, UK) has recently developed SMARTpack™, which is
similar to the Qolpac product in design and data produced but uses mobile phone technology to transfer
data from a logging device to a remote server.
GP Solutions (UK) Ltd supplied the E-wallet™ (Manchester, UK): a system that enables medication-taking
events from blister packs and MODs to be recorded in the same manner as the previous two systems.
Further details of the systems are presented in Tables 8 and 9 and in Appendix 2.
All systems require precision-designed detection circuits which fit discretely to the surface of the blister
pack. Each blister pack requires a slightly different design to ensure accurate recording of pill-taking
events, that is if the circuitry does not cross the pill position then the removal of a pill will not be recorded.
For a study of one medication, such systems are relatively cost-effective; however, in the case of studies
involving multiple different medicines, each with individually shaped packaging, the cost of developing a
detection circuit bespoke for each different type of medication would be prohibitive.
A 2-month pilot study (n = 52) of this technology to assess feasibility and acceptability reported promising
results. Adherence data were obtained from 94.3% of participants, and 67.4% of participants reported
that they would consider using the electronic monitoring system for a long-term study.27 The original
protocol for the pilot RCT set out to include adults aged ≥ 75 years if they were prescribed three or more
SODF medications which were expected to be continued for 12 months, were registered with one of six
participating medical practices and an associated pharmacy and were capable of providing informed
consent. However, owing to technical difficulties with the supply of a suitable EAM system, the eligibility
criteria were revised. The EAM systems were not universal and because of cost restrictions could be
developed for only a limited range of pack sizes. Therefore, eligibility criteria were relaxed to enable adults
aged ≥ 75 years who were taking three or more SODFs to be recruited. At least two of the participants’
medications needed to be from a defined list of 11 medications sourced from one supplier and
identified by study GPs as those most commonly taken by patients in the over-75-years age group
to enable electronic monitoring of adherence to at least two medicines.
Although all components of MODs and usual-care EAM systems are readily available, no prototype units
from the preferred supplier were available for testing and no other EAM technology could be provided for
this project within the necessary timescale. In the absence of an electronic monitoring system, DUCs are
the most appropriate approach to quantitative adherence measurement.
The DUC is based on the assumption that, if the medication is not in the container, the patient has taken
it. This is problematic when attempting to identify intentional non-adherence because patients may
deliberately remove and discard medication in order to disguise non-adherence. In essence, however, the
electronic monitoring systems are open to the same criticism. Retrospective DUCs are, however, less likely
to cause reactivity bias, and previous research has demonstrated that conducting DUCs on the older
patient population is feasible and acceptable to patients.15
Accurate DUCs require accurate knowledge of the quantities of medication to which the patient has
access. Hoarding of medication is a regular occurrence; thus, accurate DUCs require that patient access to
medicine stores be prohibited. However, the removal of what is, essentially, the property of the patient to
a place of safety while also guaranteeing, the integrity of the medications during storage and then their
safe and ethical return is problematic.
While pharmacies are secure environments with appropriate medication storage facilities and thus the
most intuitive solution to storing patient hoarded medication during a trial, liaison with the pharmacies
participating in this feasibility study identified that it would not be an acceptable solution. Limited space
was a common reason cited plus ethical considerations; it was considered undesirable to remove a
patient’s property and then to be unable to return it because it was out of date or because its provenance
could not be guaranteed.

 These issues may be circumvented by allowing the patient to retain their non-trial medicines within their
home but packaging them into a sealed container so that the contents cannot be accessed without
destroying the container. The additional merit of this process is that the patient is able to access their
medication in case of an emergency.
Optimum recruitment strategies
Passive recruitment using postal invitation has the merit of being able to simultaneously target a large
number of people with minimal cost; however, response rates to this passive method have historically been
low, as the method requires the patient to be proactive in responding to a letter of invitation.75 Consent
rates are frequently between 30% and 40% using this method.16,34 Active recruitment processes such as
waiting room recruitment by researcher, while more labour intensive and thus costly, have been reported
as yielding substantially higher response rates.35 While the relative merits of the active and passive
approaches to recruitment are known, the most cost-effective approach is yet to be determined.
Database
A dedicated study database was designed, built and maintained by Norwich Clinical Trials Unit. The
database was Microsoft SQL based (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). The data were resident
on a secure server at University of East Anglia (UEA), directly accessible only to the database management
team at Norwich Clinical Trials Unit and to UEA information technology and computing services personnel.
Access for study personnel was via a study website containing forms to enter and review study data. Access
to these pages was controlled by personal usernames and passwords under control of the database
manager. Web traffic was encrypted using standard secure sockets layer technology.
Secondary outcomes
Patient autonomy
In addition to the impact of MODs on adherence, it is important to establish patient acceptability.
No studies have reported the impact of MODs on patient autonomy or ability to manage one’s own
medication; however, there is anecdotal evidence of reduced autonomy, as patients are unable to
differentiate one medication from another in a MOD and therefore cannot select one type of medication
to omit over another. When this is desired (e.g. delaying taking a diuretic when taking a long journey) the
result may be omission of all medicines.1 Conversely, patients may report that they feel enabled by feeling
confident about managing their medication. A number of studies have explored patient autonomy with
respect to medication taking in the context of describing the extent to which patients feel involved in the
decision-making process.28 However, exploration of whether or not patients feel as though they have some
control over the medication-taking process is limited. A questionnaire was developed based on a Client
Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8) to assess the impact of MODs on patient confidence in their ability to
manage their own medication and on their satisfaction with their packaging and the service they
have received.
Dispensing and administration errors
The most substantial review to date of errors associated with MOD use was conducted in Australia; the
Australian Incident Monitoring Study31 reported that 0.43% (52 out of 12,000) of medication-related
errors were associated with MODs. In 26 cases, there was a problem with filling the MOD, such as wrong
dose, dose omission or wrong medication. In 21 of these cases, nursing staff were responsible for the
error, with the remainder being attributable to pharmacy staff or a carer. On 16 occasions problems using
the MOD were cited as a reason for an error; however, the nature of these problems was not reported.
Factors contributing to the reported problems included patient confusion/distraction and the MOD being
inappropriate for the patient.31
A further Australian audit of dispensing errors associated with 6972 dispensed MODs detected an error
rate of 4.3%.32 A 2007 UK evaluation of dispensing error rate associated with the pharmacy ‘usual’
dispensing process33 reported 1.7% content errors among 2859 dispensed items. Content errors were

 errors of omission, incorrect drug, incorrect strength, dosage form, added or missing dose units and
expired medication. While general dispensing error rates are 1.7%, there are no UK data for MOD error
rates, and those from Australia suggest widely different potential error rates. It is necessary, therefore,
to record error rates for dispensing into MODs and usual packaging.
In summary, comparative data in terms of error rate associated with MODs and usual dispensing are not
available. Data regarding the incidence of dispensing errors associated with usual dispensing are available
but may not be generalisable to prescriptions assembled for an older population with multiple items. A
reasonable estimate of error rate requires a large sample size and significant resources. Within a relatively
small-scale feasibility study it is, therefore, only appropriate to quantify and describe any identified errors.
Phase 2: trial design focus groups
Introduction
Trial design must be feasible and acceptable from the perspective not only of researchers but also of
patients and health-care professionals. Focus groups were carried out to identify design elements that
would or would not be acceptable and, when necessary, to refine the experimental design to meet
both researcher and stakeholder requirements.
Pre-specified objectives for the patient and carer focus groups were to:
l
describe the practical difficulties experienced by patients and carers in adhering to complex
medication regimes
l
explore the appropriateness and acceptability of MODs
l
consider the benefits and disadvantages of MODs including any potential adverse outcomes
l
establish the feasibility and appropriateness of trial participant requirements including recruitment
documentation, participant information sheets, survey tools and proposed adherence measures.
Pre-specified objectives for the health-care practitioner focus groups were to model and gain consensus
expert opinion on:
l
the appropriateness and feasibility of the research design
l
participant inclusion and exclusion criteria
l
recommended MODs and criteria for selection
l
any clinically important difference in patient adherence.
Methods
The feasibility study of a RCT was funded by the NIHR HTA programme and started in August 2011
(ref. HTA 09/34/03). The trial was approved by the Cambridge East Research Ethics Committee
(ref. 11/EE/0141) and Norfolk Primary Care Trust (ref. 55252). The trial is registered with UK Clinical
Research Network (ref. UKCRN 11256). The protocol describing pre-RCT focus group study design is
appended (see Appendix 3).
Six medical practices and the geographically close pharmacies in Norwich, UK, expressed an interest in
study involvement. Potential participants were identified by medical practice staff via a computerised
search and the resulting list was manually screened by either the prescribing team or GP. Three practices
recruited patients receiving, or with a history of having received, a MOD, one practice recruited patients
not currently receiving, and with no history of having received, a MOD and two practices recruited carers
of patients in receipt of a MOD.

 Focus group participant identification and recruitment
Patients and informal carers were purposively sampled to represent a wide variety of medical, social and
demographic characteristics.
Inclusion criteria for patients were:
l
age ≥ 75 years
l
exhibiting any medication-taking behaviour (thought to be fully adherent or intentionally non-adherent
or unintentionally non-adherent)
l
representing a range of regimen complexity (regularly prescribed three or more medicines and
prescribed multiple formulations, e.g inhalers, eye drops and cream or ointments)
l
currently using MODs or who have previously declined the use of a MOD
l
with mild cognitive impairment (sufficient in the clinician’s opinion to allow provision of informed
consent and engagement with a focus group)
l
with manual dexterity problems.
Exclusion criteria for patients were:
l
on the mental health register with, for example, a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, but
not depression
l
on the dementia register
l
unable to read or speak English and/or to provide informed consent
l
deemed by the health-care team to be inappropriate for study inclusion.
Informal carers were defined as friends and relatives aged over 18 years who support patients in their
medication organisation and/or taking but receive no remuneration, were required to be registered with
participating medical practices and were known by practice staff to support a person aged over 75 years
in managing medication.
Patients and carers were invited to take part via a recruitment pack posted from their medical practice
which comprised a covering letter from the medical practice, participant information leaflet and consent
form. Consenting participants returned consent forms with contact details directly to the researchers.
After 2 weeks a follow-up letter was sent from practices to non-responders.
Written informed consent was sought from patients and carers to allow contact from researchers with a
view to arranging focus groups. Patients and their carers were not invited to participate together in the
same focus group, as this may have prevented participants from speaking freely.
Carers in sheltered housing
Wardens were recruited by mail using details obtained from Norfolk County Council Adult Social Services
and requested to distribute the carer information leaflets and consent forms to carers supporting people in
sheltered housing within Norwich.
Health-care practitioners
Primary care practitioners were recruited from the six medical practices and pharmacies taking part in the
study. Secondary care practitioners were recruited from a Department of Older People’s Medicine at the
local teaching hospital. Purposive sampling was used to ensure representation from GPs, practice
prescription managers, pharmacists, community nurses plus consultants and hospital nurses specialising in
the care of older people. Study information leaflets were given to all potential participants and a minimum
of 24 hours allowed before a decision regarding participation was requested. Written informed consent
was obtained from all participants.

 Focus group conduct and data collection
Topic guides were developed from pre-specified study objectives. Meetings were scheduled to last for
90 minutes and were designed to encourage free discussion and to generate a wide range of ideas and
opinions. Audio-recordings were made with the consent of participants. A broad introductory session on
general areas of organising, giving and taking regular medicines was followed by in-depth discussion
surrounding MODs and study procedures. At the relevant points in the discussion, samples of proposed
study documentation and a selection of sample MODs were introduced to serve as trigger material to
promote discussion of appropriate documentation and MOD types for the proposed study.
Patients and carers
Two mixed focus groups of patients and carers took place at a community centre and at the UEA in
Norwich. Refreshments were served, transport offered or reimbursed and a £20 gift card provided
on attendance.
The patient and carer focus group topic guide is appended (see Appendix 3). It was designed to obtain
experiences, thoughts and opinions on:
l
organising and taking or giving regular medicines
l
using MODs
l
study procedures.
Health-care practitioners
One focus group of primary care practitioners was convened at a medical practice and another focus
group of secondary care practitioners was held at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital Foundation
Trust. Refreshments were provided and expenses including locum cover were reimbursed.
The focus group topic guide was designed to obtain experiences, thoughts and opinions on:
l
patients’ medication management strategies and problems
l
the effects of MODs
l
study design including recruitment procedures and outcome measures.
All focus groups were moderated by the principal investigator (an academic pharmacist), with a
research team member in assistance. Two other research team members were present as observers.
Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim and NVivo software (versions 9 and 10; QSR International,
Warrington, UK) were used to manage, sort and facilitate analysis of the transcript data and field notes.
A thematic analysis was adopted.
Transcripts of each focus group were read and a coding framework was independently developed by two
researchers. The coding framework, map and main themes were discussed and selected. Extracts were
labelled using participant number and focus group attended. Illustrative anonymised quotations were
selected to elucidate study findings. All processes of the analysis were shared with the study management
group to enhance transparency and validity of interpretation. A summary report of the major findings was
also reviewed by the research team as an additional validity check.
Results
Fifteen patients and carers, comprising broadly equal numbers of males and females, participated in two
focus groups with 66% having some experience of either self-filled (46%) or pharmacy-filled MODs (20%).
Five health-care professionals took part in the primary care focus group and six attended the secondary
care focus group. All focus groups lasted between 85 and 90 minutes. Table 10 provides details of
participants attending focus groups.
THE DESIGN PHASE

34
 Domains discussed by all groups were medication management strategies and the difficulties associated
with taking and giving regular medicines; the use and effects of MODs; and study design, procedures
and outcome measures.
Following analysis of transcripts the findings fell broadly into four themes: barriers to adherence; patient
autonomy; using MODs; and the acceptability of the proposed pilot study.
Barriers to adherence
Barriers to adherence have previously been well described, and those identified under this focus group
(forgetfulness, distraction, difficulty in opening packs, difficult regimes) were closely aligned with
published literature.
Forgetfulness
Both patients and carers reported that forgetting to take medication on time and forgetting the directions
given by their doctor were sometimes an issue. Health-care professionals also thought that memory
problems were the most common barrier to patients taking medication as prescribed. Box 1 provides
quotes illustrating these thoughts.
Distractions
With medication taking closely linked to daily routines, it was reported by both patients and carers that
interruptions may lead to forgotten doses. Furthermore, carers revealed a hierarchy of prioritisation by
identifying that they may forget to take their own medication because they were distracted but always
ensured that the person they were caring for had received their medication on time. Box 2 provides
comments related to these themes.

 Access to medicines
Opening medication packaging and dropping or losing doses once accessed can be an issue for older
people, particularly those with impaired vision or manual dexterity. There was strong consensus across
patient and health-care professionals that patients experience difficulties opening bottle caps and pushing
pills out of blister packs, and this seems to be compounded if increasing numbers of pills need to be taken
from blister packaging at the same time. Some of these challenges are described in Box 3.
Medication regimes
Complicated regimes were reported to cause confusion and were time-consuming to manage. Confusion
is associated with the amount of medication that needs to be taken, the timing of doses and how to take
it. It was perceived that with complex regimes, daily life revolves around the routines of medicine taking.
Secondary health-care professionals were aware of the high risk of confusion when multiple medicine
changes are implemented as a result of hospital visits or stays. Box 4 gives example comments about
medication regimes.
Health-care professionals raised the issue of intentional non-adherence because of experience of
medication side effects or lack of tangible benefits. This topic was not raised by either patients or carers.
The health-care professionals’ comments related to this topic are provided in Box 5.
BOX 3 Access to medicines
. . . there is the point of pushing them out and the mobility of fingers, um and the only thing would be I’d
change from doing it from a bulk lot to changing to doing it each time we needed the tablet, which I
might forget.
C1 FG1
. . . someone who has arthritis right? First of all, they can’t even pop the pills out, and if they drop if they
can’t even pick it up because it is so small
HCP5 FG2
. . . we’ve had that from elderly patients, that they’ll take if (they have) got seven packets, they might take
five today, ‘I’ve popped up five, that’s enough’. . .
HCP4 FG2
. . . Some of the packaging now, we are all familiar with child lock caps, we’ve have now got a lot of
these child-resistant foils coming in. I had a lady coming back the other day who had something like
lansoprazole and she said ‘I can’t pop them out’, my assistant had tried to help her and she wasn’t able to
and so my assistant came to me and said ‘look we can’t pop these out’ and then we realise that it said
‘Peel here’, and we realised we had to peel it back to take it out so it’s not just childproof it’s adult proof
as well.

 Patient autonomy
An interesting and important finding was that individual patients or carers reported independently
designed innovative and varied strategies to promote medication adherence which were actually very
similar to those independently designed by other patients and carers. Their strategies were designed to
provide the most convenient and practical approach to meet their personal needs. Patients, carers and
health-care professionals agreed that maintaining autonomy is important where possible. Health-care
professionals also acknowledged that people are individuals and may be reluctant to change their
medication management procedures. Some patients indicated that they would trust their own strategy
in preference to using a MOD. The thoughts of the patients, carers and health-care professionals are
summarised in Box 6. The different systems used to remind patients to take their medication as prescribed
are grouped and summarised in Table 11.
BOX 4 Medication regimes
. . ., he has to take so many in the morning, and then once a week he has half a tablet, and then he will

. . . the fact that the way we are putting the medicines together and the regime, once you get over a
certain number of tablets, there is no patient who is going sit there and pop eight packets of tablets out.
They’re just going to miss out on them so there is a cut-off point where someone – where we give them
an amount of a medication and with the best in the world they are going to miss one of those packets.

 Using medication organisation devices
All participants recognised that MODs may be helpful for some patients but also acknowledged some
disadvantages. Table 12 summarises the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using MODs.
A number of different MODs are commercially available. A selection of MODs were presented to
participants, who handled and discussed the various types. Consistent responses indicated that each
appeared to have some limitations, with no one design accommodating all needs. The desirable
characteristics of MODs identified from participant comments are summarised in Table 13.
BOX 6 Patient autonomy
She doesn’t want an organiser; she has a list in the bathroom. And again, with the triggers for taking
them during the day. So it’s fairly simple.

I’ve tried putting them in an organiser myself but I find that it doesn’t work out at all. So I have a
collection of wine glasses and shot glasses, I do 10 days of these at a time . . . And I just couldn’t make
organiser work. It’s . . . me not being very good at it but, um . . . I just find my wine glasses and shot
glasses work better for me from my point of view.

. . . she is on five different medications, she’s got different bowls, and she’s got one in each bowl, and she
recognises each by the bowl. Even though she’s half blind and can’t see, she’s got the box and this is this
and she keeps that on her kitchen table and then she takes it that way. And no matter whether you try to
put her on to something else she’s not going to she’s quite resistant to it.
HCP5 FG2
I think that’s the tricky point as well, that we make a situation for ourselves and then we go into people
with their crisis and do we actually make the situation worse because were going in there and interfering,
aren’t we?

 Acceptability of proposed study
A key aim of the focus group was to identify participant opinion regarding the proposed study design.
Importantly, no participants voiced any major concerns about the proposed research in relation to study
design and materials as written in the study plan. However, it is important to note that the proposed
intervention was highly complex and, although the study team took all possible care to promote
understanding (providing study flow charts, MOD boxes, study documentation and representations of
electronic monitoring devices), there was some necessary simplification because of time constraints.
Furthermore, the moderator of both focus groups was a pharmacist and, although all reasonable steps
were taken to ensure that participants, particularly carers and patients, felt able to talk freely and to
ask questions, we are aware that some participants may have felt unable to query information/
misunderstandings or admit to not understanding.
Table 14 provides a summary of the different aspects which were included in the final trial either following
recommendation by the research team and with the agreement by the focus groups or as additional
recommendations derived from the focus groups. Health-care professionals commented that effect size was,
in some cases, entirely dependent on condition. For example, for patients with myasthenia gravis, adherence
needs to be 100% at all times. For the general population it was accepted that realistic adherence rates to
specific medicines can be estimated at 50%. They agreed that 80% adherence would be acceptable and
reasonable for most patients and conditions and, therefore, that an improvement in adherence of around 30%
should be the aim.

 Summary
Separate focus group discussions with secondary and primary health-care professionals and with patients
and carers were undertaken in order to refine the trial design. The findings were grouped under four
domains: barriers to adherence; patient autonomy; using MODs; and the acceptability of the proposed
pilot study design.
In line with published research, barriers to adherence included forgetfulness, distractions, inability to access
packaging and complicated regimes. Maintaining patient autonomy was universally agreed by participants
to be important, and many patients trusted their own unique strategies for ordering and remembering
their medication, for example alarms, lists, charts, wine glasses and bowls.
No one MOD design suited all, but aesthetic and ergonomic factors, such as size and accessibility, were
key determinants of acceptability. The main advantages included reduction in packaging and improved
visual evidence of adherence. Disadvantages included challenges to access medication from the MOD;
inability to accommodate multiple and complex regimes; and potential removal of knowledge and control
from patient and carer. Economic arguments balanced better efficiency of medication supply and less
wastage, with increased workload demands on pharmacists. The patients identified as most likely to
benefit from MODs were older people with impairments of cognition, dexterity and vision who were
prescribed complex and multiple medication regimes with little social support and history of readmittance
to hospital.
With regards to study design, participants identified no challenges to the proposed methods. The desirable
characteristics of study participants were confirmed and largely accommodated by the study inclusion and
exclusion criteria with the exception of reducing the minimum recruitment age from 75 years to 50 or
60 years. Alternative recruitment strategies, such as recruitment from pharmacies and by using posters,
were proposed but not included as they would not allow targeting of eligible patients.

 Chapter 4 Randomised controlled trial
Introduction
Chapter 1 provides a detailed background describing the rationale for this trial. A number of studies
quantifying medication adherence for MODs compared with usual care have been identified and the
systematic review results are presented in Chapter 2. The review illustrates that most studies in this area
are small scale and provide no definitive evidence of either clinical or cost benefit. In addition to this, there
is no guidance on the type of patient who would benefit from receiving their medications in a MOD.
Chapter 3 provides a description of the development of the proposed design elements for a definitive
study. This chapter describes the RCT in order to determine the feasibility of using elements of
the proposed design as part of a definitive study to compare MODs with usual care and to define the
population most likely to gain benefit from this intervention.
Aim
To test study methods and identify refinements for a definitive trial to investigate the clinical effectiveness
and cost-effectiveness of MODs.
Objectives
l
To identify the most effective method of participant recruitment.
l
To estimate the prevalence of intentional non-adherence within an older population.
l
To estimate the prevalence and magnitude of participants’ unintentional non-adherence within a
3-week period.
l
To describe the functional abilities of an older participant population.
l
To compare medication adherence for MODs and usual care.
l
To compare medication adherence for weekly and monthly supply.
l
To compare the effects of MODs and usual care plus weekly and monthly supply.
l
To provide a point estimate of the effect size of MODs relative to usual packaging.
Exploration of each of the objectives is undertaken in this chapter, with the exception of the first objective;
the cost-effectiveness of two different recruitment methods is examined in detail in Chapter 6.
Methods
Trial design, funding and approval
The RCT was a single-centre (multisite) individually randomised 2 × 2 factorial design comparing the effect
of MODs with medication dispensed in usual packaging and of weekly compared with a monthly
medication supply. The trial was conducted across six NHS Norfolk GP practices and 14 pharmacies which
served the patients registered at these GP practices. Five of the GP practices and 13 of the pharmacies
were situated in the Norwich area, including its suburbs, and one GP practice and pharmacy was based in
a small, nearby market town.

 The trial was funded by the NIHR HTA programme and started in August 2011 (ref. HTA 09/34/03). The
trial was approved by the Cambridge South Research Ethics Committee (ref. 12/EE/0251), Norfolk Primary
Care Trust (ref. 99999) and additionally by Norfolk County Council (in respect of social services usage
data only). The trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Register
(ref. ISRCTN 30626972) and the UK Clinical Research Network (ref. UKCRN 12739).
A number of changes to procedure were necessary as a result of the failure to obtain a suitable EAM
system. Table 15 provides a summary of deviations from the protocol with reasons for the deviation.
All deviations were appropriately notified as amendments to the protocol.
Participant eligibility
The pilot had two phases. Phase 1 established patients’ adherence; only patients identified as
unintentionally non-adherent progressed to phase 2, which was randomisation.
As described in Chapter 3, refinements to the eligibility criteria were necessary because of constraints of
the proposed EAM system.
Eligibility criteria
The process for ensuring that all randomised participants fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria was
multistage and is summarised in Figure 7. Some eligibility criteria are repeated at the different stages
where appropriate multiple information sources were used to confirm eligibility.

 Exclusion
Patients were excluded if they:
l
were regularly prescribed medication not currently dispensed by a pharmacy recruited to the study
l
had a life expectancy of less than 12 months
l
were currently involved in a clinical trial
l
were not self-administering their medication
l
were currently receiving or had previously received medication in a MOD
l

l
were deemed by the health-care team to be unsuitable for study inclusion for other reasons
l
were using a medication organisation strategy incompatible with trial participation
l
were intentionally non-adherent.
Participant identification and recruitment
Identification
One member of each of the six recruited medical practices undertook a database search to identify
potentially eligible patients. A GP subsequently screened the list to exclude any patients deemed
unsuitable. The reasons for exclusion were recorded in order to further refine the exclusion criteria
of a definitive study.
Recruitment
Two patient recruitment methods were tested, passive and active, to determine their acceptability and
effectiveness. For consenting patients, responses to questionnaire 1 (see Appendix 5) were used to
identify whether or not the patient should be excluded on the following criteria:
l
were using a medication organisation strategy incompatible with trial participation
l
were intentionally non-adherent.

 Passive recruitment
Patients identified by GP database search, and subsequently GP screened for suitability, were sent
recruitment packs. Recruitment packs comprised a letter of invitation on GP practice-headed paper
(see Appendix 6), patient information leaflet (PIL; see Appendix 7), consent form (see Appendix 8),
questionnaire 1 (see Appendix 5) and a pre-paid envelope. Participants were asked to return completed
documents directly to researchers. Questionnaire 1 was not attached to the consent form and so patients
were able to choose to return both, either or neither. Implicit consent was assumed for any questionnaires
returned. One reminder was sent to each non-responding patient 3 weeks after initial posting.
A standard operating procedure (SOP) for passive recruitment was prepared (see Appendix 9). Three
practices used only passive recruitment which commenced during August 2012 and was completed in
February 2013.
Active recruitment
This process involved one of six researchers recruiting patients when they presented for routine
appointments at the participating GP practices. Patients identified by GP database search, and subsequently
GP screened for suitability, were highlighted on the GP system, which enabled practice reception staff to
identify the potentially eligible patients who would be presenting at the medical practice on a recruitment
day. Such patients were provided with a PIL and an explanation that there was a researcher present who
would like to talk to them about the study if they were interested. Patients who chose to approach the
researcher were informed about the study and given a recruitment pack which they could complete at the
medical practice or take away. If patients volunteered information indicating that they were ineligible
(e.g. they were already using a MOD), they were informed of their ineligibility and thanked for their time.
The SOP for active recruitment is provided in Appendix 10.
Three practices used active recruitment for a 3-week period followed by passive recruitment, as previously
described. Active recruitment was carried out in 3-week tranches during the period September to
November 2012.
Intervention and comparator
Participants were randomised to one of the following arms for 8 weeks:
1. four MODs dispensed monthly either collected by the patient or delivered to the patient’s home,
according to usual patient routine
2. one MOD delivered to the patient’s home weekly
3. usual medication packaging dispensed monthly and either collected by patient or delivered to the
patient’s home, according to usual patient routine
4. usual-care medication packaging delivered to the patient’s home weekly.
Other prescribed medication that could not be dispensed in a MOD, for example inhalers, creams, liquids
and when-required medication, was supplied in usual packaging with the MOD.
Medication organisation devices
Nomad Clear, Nomad Clear-XL and a Venalink device were used. MODs contained all SODFs prescribed to
the patient unless they were unsuited to being dispensed in a MOD [e.g. because they are to be taken
‘when required’, their administration requires special processes, such as dissolving or chewing, or their
dose is likely to change frequently or at short notice (e.g. warfarin)]. Monthly MODs were either collected
from the pharmacy or delivered from the pharmacy to the patient according to the usual routine of the
patient. Weekly MODs were delivered to the patient.

 Usual care
Medication supplied in the manufacturer’s usual packaging or in accordance with usual dispensing
procedures when this is inappropriate, for example prescription requests for a quantity other than the
manufacturer’s pack size. Monthly packaging was either delivered to the participant or collected from
the pharmacy according to the participant’s usual routine. Weekly packaging was delivered to the
participant’s home.

Data collection
Questionnaire data were collected from patients by postal return or in their own homes if participants
requested help to complete forms. Data on pharmacy activities and the empty packaging for pill counts
were obtained from each participating pharmacy. Patient data on comorbidities and use of health-care
services for the period 2 months prior to and 2 months after the start of the trial were obtained from
participating GP practices. Data on use of social care services were obtained from Norfolk County Council
Social Services Department.
Prevalence of intentional non-adherence
All consenting participants were screened for factors including intentional non-adherence, non-self-
medication, current or previous use of a MOD and complex medication management strategies using
questionnaire 1. Intentional non-adherence was investigated using eight statements in four pairs across
three sections of the questionnaire and an arbitrary cut-off of extreme agreement (strongly agree or
‘yes’ response) with three or more of the eight statements on intentional non-adherence was used to
indicate likely intentional non-adherence. Statements included widely accepted reasons for intentional
non-adherence in a UK setting and addressed the need for treatment breaks, addiction concerns,
cost–benefit, perceived toxicity, medication necessity and side effects.
Questionnaire 1 was also used to identify participants already using MODs or using methods of medication
organisation which would either be incompatible with EAM or unethical to remove from a participant.
Participants not meeting the inclusion criteria because of intentional non-adherence, use of MOD or other
trial-incompatible medication organisation strategy were thanked for their interest by letter and informed
we would be making no further contact with them (see Appendix 11).
Participants identified as potentially eligible after completing questionnaire 1 were contacted by telephone
to arrange a preliminary baseline visit in their own home, and their usual pharmacy was identified.

 Prevalence and magnitude of unintentional non-adherence
The purpose of the baseline visit was multifold: to meet with patients (often for the first time); to confirm
that all non-medical inclusion criteria had been identified (e.g. that there were no obvious unreported
medication-taking strategies in place); to remove existing prescribed medication so as to ensure that the
patient did not accidentally take medicines from a non-study pack; and to deliver a new 28-day medication
supply to be taken over the following 4-week period, which would allow the study team to ascertain
whether or not patients may be unintentionally non-adherent.
Prior to the baseline visit, participants were asked to collect all medicines together. At the baseline visit,
researchers stressed that they would not reveal information to their GPs about how well participants took
their medicine, as researchers were interested only in measuring the participants’ usual medication-taking
habits. Researchers recorded name, form and quantity of all existing medicines and then removed them
from use by placing them in one or more large clear bags secured with a cable tie. Details were recorded
on administration form 1 (see Appendix 12) and participants were asked to endorse the record.
Medications no longer required or expired were returned to the pharmacy for destruction with
participant consent.
Each secure bag was labelled clearly with the participant’s name and instructions not to use the contents
unless absolutely necessary. The sealed medicines were returned to the participant for safe keeping
and participants were asked to inform researchers if they needed to open the bag during the study.
A follow-up appointment was arranged for 3 weeks (± 2 days) after the initial visit.
The assessment of unintentional non-adherence was made by DUC. If a participant had taken fewer than
expected SODFs, they were identified as unintentionally non-adherent. Researchers also confirmed the
participant’s willingness to continue in the study and carried out randomisation. Participants were informed
of their randomisation status. If participants were randomised to receive a MOD, they were shown the
three study MODs (Nomad, Nomad XL and Venalink) and asked to select their preferred MOD. Their
choice and confirmation that they were able to use it were recorded using administration form 2 (see
Appendix 13).
Irrespective of adherence status or willingness to continue in the trial, participants were asked to continue
to take the 1-week (approximately) medication supply remaining in the packs delivered at the baseline visit
and then to continue to obtain their prescribed medications according to their usual supply routine.
Pharmacists were informed of randomisation status for all participants.
Adherence monitoring
In the absence of a suitable EAM system, DUC was used to determine adherence to prescribed SODFs.
Patients were provided with a number of large, clearly labelled, sealable plastic wallets in which to store
used medication packaging. Wallets were returned to pharmacies by patients or delivery drivers coinciding
with usual collection from the pharmacy. Researchers contacted patients for whom medicines had not
been returned to the pharmacy. The number of doses returned for each medicine was counted
and recorded.
Characterisation of the participant population
Cognitive function was assessed using the 11-item MMSE. It is scored out of 30, with scores of 23
and above indicative of cognitive function within the normal range.65
Manual dexterity was assessed using the 9-HPT, which was scored by measuring the period of time, in
seconds, taken to move pegs, similar in dimension to medication capsules, from a tray into a 3 × 3 array of
holes which accommodate the pegs in a vertical orientation, and then to remove them and place them
back into the tray.76

 Visual acuity was assessed using the smallest font size that could be read on the Bailey–Lovie Near Chart.71
Participants used their usual visual aids and held the chart at their normal reading distance (approximately
40 cm). The test took place under the lighting conditions that patients would usually be exposed to when
taking their day-time medicines.
General practitioner records were accessed by a member of the research team in order to obtain
participant comorbidities.
Participants also completed baseline health and quality-of-life measures as described in Chapter 7.
Randomisation
Randomisation was carried out at the participant’s home by researchers. Participants identified as
unintentionally non-adherent were randomised to phase 2. Researchers used mobile internet to connect to
the secure study database. The randomisation sequences were generated automatically using an online
system developed and managed by Norwich Clinical Trials Unit. Allocation was automatically recorded in
the study database. Randomisation was done on a permuted block basis. There were six strata, one per GP
medical practice. There were four randomisation arms (usual supply weekly, usual supply monthly, MOD
weekly, MOD weekly). The codes for each stratum were blocked randomly into groups of four or eight to
try and even out the distribution across randomisation arms.
Blinding
Given the nature of the interventions under study (MOD and frequency of dispensing), blinding was not
possible for patients, researchers or pharmacists involved in the study.
Trial logistics
Administration and timings
At commencement of the intervention, researchers visited the participant and explained procedural details
emphasising how and when medicines would be supplied and asking that all medication packaging was
retained for researchers. It was again stressed that researchers would not feed information back to GPs
about how well participants were taking their medicine and that they were only interested in measuring
the participants’ usual medication-taking habits. At this visit, researchers delivered the first medicines of
the intervention and follow-up questionnaires: EQ-5D-3L combined with the Investigating Choice
Experiment CAPability measure for Older people (ICECAP-O, questionnaire 2), a patient satisfaction survey
(questionnaire 3, see Appendix 14). A further questionnaire and letter of invitation for any person living
with or caring for the participant (questionnaire 4, see Appendix 15) was also left with the participant.
Researchers agreed to telephone participants 1 week prior to completion of the intervention to explain the
procedure for returning to usual care.
General practice and pharmacy participation
General practice participation at this stage of the trial was limited to routine prescription preparation and
required only minimal interaction between researchers and prescription managers.
Pharmacists were informed directly after randomisation of the randomisation status of their participant.
They were asked to follow the instructions provided in the SOP for pharmacies (see Appendix 16).
Briefly, pharmacists prepared medicines according to randomisation. In the case of medicines that were
to be dispensed in MODs, after the first delivery (carried out by researcher), these were delivered to
the participant by the pharmacist via their usual delivery service for weekly supply or were collected by
participants. Medicines that were dispensed in usual packaging were delivered weekly to patients randomised
to usual care and delivered or collected in accordance with usual practice for patients randomised to
monthly supply.
RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL
NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk
52
 Pharmacy data collection
Pharmacists were asked to record participant details, medicines supplied, time taken to dispense medicines
and any near-miss dispensing or prescribing errors identified on administration form 3 (see Appendix 17),
with further details, if necessary, on pro-forma follow-on sheets. They were also asked to record any other
comments about the trial.
Adverse events
This pilot trial was not a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product, and thus no formal process for
recording adverse events (AEs) was implemented. Any potential AEs identified were defined in accordance with
European Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC as new or the worsening of pre-existing symptoms.
Serious adverse events
Serious adverse events (SAEs) are defined by European legislation as the development of an undesirable
medical condition or the deterioration of an existing medical condition following or during exposure to an
investigational medicinal product, whether or not it is considered causally related to that product, which
results in hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation; immediately life-threatening illness; persistent
or significant disability; and incapacity or death.
Descriptions of all AEs were recorded using UEA SOP 206 with associated SAE form (see Appendices 19
and 20). Reports were made to the UEA research sponsor and local research and governance representative
within stipulated time limits. Governance committees assessed the reports. All AEs identified were also
reported to management and steering committees. The participant’s usual GP was contacted for an opinion
on probable causality, that is whether the GP considered it unlikely, possible or likely that events occurred as
a result of trial participation.
Sample size
The sample size was determined as follows. A total of 120 participants were required for the RCT. With
four groups of 30 participants, the coefficient of variation of the SE estimates for any continuous outcome
measure for each group was expected to be about 13% using a linear approximation and assumption of
normality. These SE estimates, would have been used to inform the power calculation of a definitive trial
and would have been within about 25% of their true values based on the expected half-width of
a 95% CI. It was estimated that, in order to obtain 120 participants who are primarily unintentionally
non-adherent, 720 potential participants needed to be screened using a self-report questionnaire. This
estimate was based on the assumption that approximately 20% of participants would be intentionally
non-adherent17,18,77,78 and thus excluded. The remaining 576 participants would be monitored for
non-adherence using DUC. This stage was expected to result in 30% attrition, and thus 403 participants
would remain, of whom 160 (40%) were expected to be non-adherent. These participants would then be
randomised and monitored for 3 months, during which process a further 25% attrition was expected,
leaving 120 participants. (See Figure 8 for the flow diagram summarising participant pathway through
trial.) Participants suspected of intentional non-adherence were advised to consult their pharmacist for a
medicines use review or their GP.
The primary outcome measure was the mean difference in per cent adherence (measured by pill count)
between participants in receipt of a MOD and participants who received their medication in usual-care
packaging. This should provide an estimate of the effect of the factor packaging. As there are no reported
trials with a similar population, that is pre-screened to remove participants likely to be adherent or
demonstrate intentional non-adherence, data were not available to estimate the variance of adherence
measured in this population. However, an upper estimate of the precision was determined by considering
the dichotomisation of this outcome to the binary measure adherent versus non-adherent. Making the
conservative assumption that 50% of participants would be adherent and with 60 participants receiving a
MOD and 60 receiving usual-care packaging, the half-width of a 95% CI around the difference between
these groups should be less than 18%.
No interim analyses or stopping guidelines were included in the study design.

 Statistical methods
A dedicated study database was designed, built and maintained by Norwich Clinical Trials Unit, data were
analysed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and PASW statistics version 18 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive analyses were used to report recruitment and consent rates, social and
health (comorbidities) status, participant functional abilities in addition to prevalence of intentional and
unintentional non-adherence. Unintentional non-adherence during a 3-week screening period was
calculated as follows:
� Observed no: dosage units remaining
Expected no: dosage units remaining
�
× 100:
(1)
The magnitude of unintentional non-adherence was determined from median and interquartile divergence
for all unintentionally non-adherent participants.
Unintentional non-adherence during the 8-week trial period was identified and magnitude calculated as
described above for the 3-week screening. Percentage medication adherence was reported for participants
randomised to MODs or usual care and weekly or monthly delivery for each medication. This approach
took into account that there were varied individual daily dose regimes and that not all participants
returned all packs. Analyses were undertaken for any medicines returned by participants for whom at least
1 week’s medication packaging was returned. Previous research indicated that the data may be negatively
skewed with minimal deviation from 100% adherence.15 Secondary analysis was, therefore, undertaken
using a dichotomisation of 100% versus less than 100% adherence.
Analyses were carried out with respect to incidence of reported AEs. Fisher’s exact (two-tailed) test
was used to determine the statistical significance of the events with respect to type of packaging and
frequency of supply.
Although the study was not powered to detect differences of a particular size, and accepting the
limitations of a feasibility study, the observed differences between the study groups were presented.
Exploratory analyses were also undertaken to identify any indications that variables such as cognitive
function, number of prescribed medicines and manual dexterity affect the primary outcome (adherence).
This was to identify whether or not any subgroups of participants might benefit from MODs.
Results
The inability to obtain a suitable objective EAM solution also delayed a number of trial timelines. The initial
intent was to carry out the 3-week assessment of unintentional non-adherence with immediate
randomisation of eligible participants. As a result of difficulties identifying a suitable adherence monitoring
device, there was a delay of 2–3 months between randomisation and the start of the RCT.
Recruitment
Figure 8 [Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram] illustrates the flow of patients
through the study. The most significant attrition during recruitment was at the stages of determining
eligibility for EAM, followed by ineligibility as a result of medication-taking strategies that were inconsistent
with MODs or electronic monitoring. A completed questionnaire 1 was received from 288 participants, of
whom 11 (3.8%) were excluded because of current participation in a medication trial.
Participants using a medication organisation device or medication organisation
strategy incompatible with trial participation
One hundred and two participants (35.4%) reported in questionnaire 1 using a MOD and were thus
excluded. A further 27 (9.4%) participants reported use of strategies to aid correct medication taking
which were incompatible with the study design. Six reported that they were not self-medicating, one
reported using an alarm, three reported popping out their pills in advance into other containers, for
example bottles or cups, which would have been incompatible with EAM. The remaining 17 participants
reported using other equipment to organise their medicines. For example, some used a series of shot
glasses and others ice cube trays.

 Prevalence of non-adherence
Intentional non-adherence
Screening of questionnaire 1 responses identified 71 (24.7%) participants indicating extreme agreement
with one of eight statements exploring intentional non-adherence. Eighteen (6.3%) indicated extreme
agreement with two of eight statements and two (0.7%) participants indicated extreme agreement with
three statements and were thus excluded from the study.
Unintentional non-adherence
All 80 eligible participants presented their medicines to the researchers during visit 1. Some medications
were neatly presented with the correct blisters in their original packaging in an organised fashion and
others appeared to have been randomly tossed into buckets, bags and boxes. One participant, who was
subsequently withdrawn from the study, had very poor eyesight and used the colours and sizes of his
medicine boxes to distinguish one from another. This participant had incorrect blisters inside boxes.
Many patients had medicines surplus to reasonable requirement in their possession, as summarised in
Table 17. As an extreme example, one participant presented 17 unused tubes of Ovestin cream and
seven unopened boxes of codeine phosphate. Many participants had excessive numbers of surplus
prescribed painkillers. No patients reported any discomfort with or declined the removal from use of
their old medicine stocks.
Dosage unit count data were available for 76 subjects, of whom 41 (53.9%) were ‘fully adherent’ and
thus excluded from further study participation. The remaining 35 participants (46.1%, 95% CI 34.8% to
57.3%) were unintentionally non-adherent. Five of these participants withdrew prior to randomisation
and one was excluded after visit 2 because of concerns about his mental health on discussion with his
health-care team.

RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL

56
 Of the 29 randomised participants, three subsequently withdrew prior to receiving the intervention:
one participant citing problems with delivery (n = 1 MOD weekly) and two participants stating that they
preferred not to take part (n = 1 MOD weekly; n = 1 usual supply monthly). A further patient was
withdrawn after randomisation to the usual supply monthly group because his eyesight was extremely
poor and there were concerns that he was unable to manage his medicines safely; his health-care team
were informed.
Twenty-five participants commenced the intervention, but primary outcome data were not received from
three of these participants and thus they were excluded from analysis: one participant was admitted to
hospital during the trial (n = 1 MOD monthly), while the other two participants (n = 1, usual care weekly;
n = 1, usual care monthly) did not return any medication blister strips to enable the primary outcome
measure to be calculated.
Table 18 summarises the baseline characteristics of participants randomised to each of the four groups.
It can be seen that the participants were relatively evenly matched across the four groups.
Table 19 illustrates the cognitive function, manual dexterity and visual acuity of participants. No
randomised participant had significant cognitive impairment. There was substantial variation in manual
dexterity and 12 (41.4%) participants had manual dexterity that was poorer than the normative value
for the population aged over 71 years.79

 Intervention effect on adherence
An estimate of medication adherence could be made for all participants randomised to the MOD arms
as at least one MOD was returned from each of these participants. However, some participants in the
usual-care group returned packs for some medicines and not for others. Additionally, some patients
returned empty packs without the blister strips. One participant reported that he had returned his empty
usual-care packs to the pharmacy but in some cases researchers were unable to retrieve packs from
pharmacies. Discussion with the pharmacy team suggested that returned usual packaging may, in some
cases, have been discarded. Only boxes returned with blister strips were included in the analyses.
Twenty-two subjects had primary outcome data (i.e. adherence measure) available for analysis.
Table 20 presents the adherence data from DUC during an 8-week trial period. The distribution of
adherence was found to be very negatively skewed (skewness = –2.48), with only 8 of the 22 not being
100% adherent. A non-parametric approach was, therefore, taken to compare treatment groups. Further,
a secondary analysis was carried out using a dichotomisation of 100% versus less than 100% adherence.
A comparison of the treatment groups is presented in Table 20.
It can be seen that the MOD group and usual-care group had very similar levels of adherence, being very
high in each group. There was no statistically significant difference with respect to the median level of
adherence (p = 0.619, Mann–Whitney U-test) or with respect to the proportion being fully adherent
(p = 1.00, Fisher’s exact test). Similarly, there was no indication of any difference in adherence between
the monthly and weekly supply groups, either with respect to the median level of adherence (p = 0.789,
Mann–Whitney U-test) or the proportion being fully adherent (p = 1.00, Fisher’s exact test).
Relationship of adherence to cognitive and physical function
The relationships between adherence and MMSE scores, dexterity scores and visual acuity were explored
for possible factors predicting adherence among the 22 subjects in whom adherence was measured in the
trial. Spearman’s rank correlation (rs) was used to quantify the relationship between adherence and these
variables, as shown in Table 21.

 One correlation coefficient was statistically significantly different from zero. This was for the relationship
between adherence and dexterity of the left hand (rs = –0.516; p = 0.014). This value was negative,
indicating that the longer the time to complete the dexterity test with the left hand, the lower the
adherence score was likely to be. No other coefficient was statistically significant.
Adverse events
A total of five AEs (n = 3) or SAEs (n = 2) were identified in the 25 participants receiving the intervention.
Events comprised a hypoglycaemic episode, three falls leading to hip fracture, with death in one patient,
and one temporary physical incapacitation. All five events were identified in groups randomised to receive
MODs. Using Fisher’s exact test (two-tailed), the association between groups (MODs/usual care) and
outcomes (harm/no harm) was statistically significant (p = 0.0391). Two events occurred in participants
receiving care on a monthly basis and three in those receiving on a weekly basis. Using Fisher’s exact test
(two-tailed), the association between groups (weekly care/monthly care) and outcomes (harm/no harm)
was not statistically significant (p = 1.000). The SAEs and AEs are detailed in Tables 22–26. No events were
identified in participants randomised to usual care.
Pharmacists were asked to record any near misses and the type of near miss for the duration of the RCT.
Pharmacy data collection forms were returned for all participants; the two near misses that were reported
are presented in Table 27.

 Summary
This study aimed to test the methods informed by the preceding chapters and identify refinements for a
definitive RCT to investigate clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MODs. The single-centre,
multisite factorial 2 × 2 pragmatic RCT examined the effects of MOD versus usual packaging and weekly
versus monthly medication supply. The feasibility study design also tested a passive method of recruitment
using mail compared with an active method of a researcher recruiting patients attending their
general practice.
Eligible participants were aged over 74 years, prescribed and self-administering three or more solid oral
dose medications from a defined list and unintentionally non-adherent. Unintentional non-adherence was
determined from a composite of patient self-report and 3-week DUC data. Patients who used techniques
to organise their medicines which were incompatible with use of a MOD were excluded.
The intervention and comparator were as follows:
l
four MODs dispensed monthly collected by patient/delivered to patient home
l
one MOD delivered to patient’s home weekly
l
usual medication dispensed monthly collected by patient/delivered to patient’s home
l
usual medication delivered to patient’s home weekly.
The primary outcome measure was percentage adherence, which was intended to be measured using
electronic monitoring. A working system suitable for EAM in the usual-care groups could not be sourced
within the time frame of the study. Adherence was, therefore, measured by DUC at 8 weeks and a
secondary outcome was mortality. Further secondary outcomes were self-reported quality of life (EQ-5D
and ICECAP-O), which is reported in Chapter 6, and self-reported autonomy (patient enablement scale)
and satisfaction (adapted CSQ-8), which are reported in Chapter 5.
Of the 80 potentially eligible participants identified, 76 completed the pre-baseline 3-week DUC. From
the self-reported adherence questionnaire and DUC data, 35 (46.1%) participants were unintentionally
non-adherent. Five participants withdrew before randomisation and two were excluded after
randomisation (because of mental health and eyesight problems), leaving 28, of whom three withdrew
prior to receiving the intervention. Of the remaining 25 participants, no primary outcome data were
available for three.
Adherence data suggested almost perfect adherence in all groups, with no significant differences
observed. Five AEs were observed among the 13 patients randomised to receive the MOD intervention,
compared with none in the 12 participants allocated to usual care (Fisher’s exact test; p = 0.039). Two
of the AEs were classified as serious, as both participants were hospitalised and one died.

 Chapter 5 Review of the randomised controlled
trial design
Introduction
The overarching aim of the study was to design and assess the feasibility of a definitive study to determine
the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MODs. This chapter describes the assessment of the study
methods and management in terms of acceptability both to patients and to health-care professionals.
Aims and objectives
The aim was to review the design of the RCT element (see Chapter 4) of this feasibility study. This chapter
investigates the feasibility and acceptability of the study design to identify lessons learnt and aspects of the
trial that may need to be changed before progressing to a definitive trial. The objectives were to describe:
l
participant satisfaction with medication packaging, trial management and participation
l
carers’ perceptions of the effect of elements of the RCT on the person they care for
l
participant and health-care professional acceptability of trial participation and design through
group discussions.
Methods
Questionnaires and group discussions were used to enable both quantitative and qualitative review of the
RCT element of the study.
Questionnaire data collection
Participants were provided with two questionnaires during the visit at which they were randomised:
a participant experience questionnaire and a carer experience questionnaire. Participants were asked to
complete and return the participant experience questionnaire immediately after completing the RCT.
Participants who did not return the questionnaire within 2 weeks of completion and who were thought
to have completed the trial were reminded once by telephone.
The carer experience questionnaire left with participants was accompanied by a letter of invitation and
participants were encouraged to give the questionnaire and letter to the most appropriate carer (formal
carer, spouse or other relative). The letter invited completion and return of the questionnaire when the
person they cared for had completed the RCT. Carers were unknown to researchers and, therefore, were
not reminded to complete the questionnaire.
Participant questionnaire content
An 11-item questionnaire was developed incorporating validated and non-validated items. Non-validated
items were developed from the phase 1 focus group findings; the trial management committee was used
to assess content validity and the independent steering committee comprising lay members was used to
assess face validity. Three non-validated items related to satisfaction with the medication packaging (MOD
or manufacturer’s packaging) and the extent to which it met the participant’s needs. Responses were
sought on a 4-point Likert scale, with the most positive responses having the highest score.

Park, Southampton SO16 7NS, UK.
65
 Participants’ autonomy, confidence and anxiety associated with medicine taking were assessed using six
items developed through appropriate adaptation of the patient enablement instrument and previous work
undertaken by the research team.80 Responses were sought on a 5-point Likert scale, with the most
positive responses having the highest score. The questionnaire is appended (see Appendix 14).
Carer questionnaire content
The carer questionnaire had six items related to autonomy, confidence and anxiety, as previously described
for the participant questionnaire. These questions were adapted to be relevant for a carer or relative to
complete, for example:
My confidence in their ability to take their medicines correctly is . . .
My level of anxiety about them taking their medicines wrongly is . . .
It also included a health economics section to capture the amount and type of care provided to the person
involved in the study. A copy of this questionnaire is provided in Appendix 15.
Post-trial discussions
Two group discussions were convened in order to capture the experiences of patients and health-care
professionals involved in the trial. The discussions were structured to gain opinions on each stage of the
trial process to identify what worked well and less well with a view to optimising definitive study design.
Focus group 5 (FG5) comprised RCT participants and focus group 6 (FG6) comprised a range of health-care
professionals involved in the delivery of the RCT.
Participant identification and recruitment
The feasibility study information leaflet and consent form invited participants to express an interest in
attending a group discussion convened once the trial was complete. These participants were purposively
sampled to provide even representation of all four arms of the trial (MOD weekly, MOD monthly, usual care
weekly and usual care monthly) and invited by telephone to attend the group discussion. All health-care
professionals involved in the study (pharmacists, practice managers and GPs) were invited to take part via
telephone and those confirming interest were mailed recruitment packs (invitation letter, PIL and consent
form). Consenting health-care professionals were then purposively sampled to ensure even representation
of all groups.
Data collection
Discussion guides were based on activities for each stage of the RCT element of this feasibility study,
designed to capture both positive and negative experiences and tailored to the perspectives of each group
(Appendices 21 and 22). A copy of study information sheets, consent forms and questionnaires was
provided to each participant and example MODs were provided for each group. The group discussions
took place at the UEA and were designed to last no longer than 90 minutes.
The discussions were moderated by the principal investigator and a researcher independent of the study.
Proceedings were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. NVivo version 9 software was used to organise
the themes of the discussions. Two researchers (SB and CA) read and coded the transcripts independently.
An expert in qualitative research (CS) reviewed the final framework comprising themes and subthemes.
A selection of anonymised quotes from the transcripts was extracted to illustrate identified themes.

 Results
Participant satisfaction with medication packaging, trial management
and participation
Twenty-three participants completed the study, of whom 21 (91%) returned patient satisfaction
questionnaires. Table 28 provides a comparison of the patient ratings of the different medication
packaging and supply formats trialled. It can be seen that patient rating of their medication packaging was
generally high, with MOD weekly achieving a median score of 3 on a 4-point scale, where 4 indicates
maximal satisfaction. Although MOD weekly was consistently scored highest or equal highest for all
criteria, no significant differences were observed in this small sample.
Table 29 illustrates the distribution in participant responses regarding perceived change in confidence to
self-manage their medication and health plus the extent to which the group to which they were allocated
affected any stress associated with medication taking. The median score of 2 on a 5-point scale indicates a
response of ‘the same’ for the majority of criteria. This in turn suggests that patient confidence and stress
remained largely unchanged before and after randomisation.

 Table 30 summarises the carers’ responses to the post-study questionnaire assessing their perception of
any changes in the participant’s ability to manage their medication or autonomy. From the 23 participants
that completed the study, 13 (57%) carer questionnaires were returned. Results indicate that type of
device had no significant effect on any of the autonomy items, as rated by the carers, although there was
an observed trend to lower scores in the monthly usual packaging group.
Of the 29 participants randomised, 17 expressed an interest in participating in a group discussion;
purposive sampling led to eight attending the group discussion.
Participant characteristics
Eight participants of the pilot RCT participated in the first focus group and seven health-care professionals
in the second. Table 31 provides a summary of participant characteristics.
Discussion across both focus groups fell into four broad areas: the general experience of taking part;
medication-related issues; comments about specific tools used within the study; and comments regarding
a future trial. These are summarised with illustrative quotes, with identifiers (P for patient and HCP for
health-care professional), reported in boxes at the end of each section.

 General experience of taking part
There were five subthemes under the overarching theme of general experiences: reasons for taking part,
communication about the study, patient behavioural changes, impact of study on medical practices and
pharmacies, and feedback to pharmacists.
Varied reasons were provided for taking part by patients and health-care professionals. Patients wanted
to take part to help others (P7 FG5), to help themselves (P8 FG5), to give payback to the NHS (P2 FG5, P4
FG5), to avoid stockpiling (P2 FG5), P3 FG5) and because it is a good thing to do (P7 FG5). Pharmacy-based
health-care professionals were interested from a health-economic/health-benefit perspective (HCP4 FG6,
HCP2 FG6, HCP3 FG6, HCP6 FG6) and wanted to know whether or not the resource they put into
preparing MODs was worthwhile with respect to patient benefit. Practice-based health-care professionals
had chosen to support this study within their Primary Care Research Network (PCRN) research remit
and because they were keen to know if MODs (trays) do benefit their patients (HCP1 FG6, HCP7 FG6).
Box 7 provides statements of reasons for taking part for patients and Box 8 provides them for
health-care professionals.
Communication about the study
This was a complex study and frequent and effective communication was required. Most communication
was required between researchers, pharmacists and patients. Representative statements from focus group
participants are presented in Box 9. The GP participant did not experience problems with communication
(HCP7 FG6). Problems caused by the inability to source a suitable EAM caused delays to project timelines,
and this was reflected in negative comments (HCP5 FG6). All patients were signed up to the automatic
prescription order and collect system for preparation of medicines during the trial so that they would
seamlessly revert to usual care at the end of the 2-month intervention. The process was not clearly defined
in the study SOP and was not clear to all pharmacists as reflected in example comments (HCP4 FG6).
However, some found the process very smooth (HCP6 FG6).

 BOX 7 Reasons to take part in a study of MODs: patients
Well me, when it was put to me by [research associate] I thought there must be a reason for it and if it’s
going to help us as we get older, you know, I mean when you get to some people at 86 and 87 who
can’t even remember what the day is let alone their pills, if it’s individually and they can read, it would
help them. But I’m OK at the moment but I don’t know what I would be like in 4 years’ time. That’s
me anyway.
P7 FG5
I feel like this lady too. As you get older you become more confused and I thought it would be easier to
have the pill box rather than having to count out your things yourself.
P8 FG5
Well I thought it might do somebody some good, you know, because I just have them once a month,
a little pill box, so I thought well, I just hope it does somebody else some good. That’s it.
P5 FG5
I think I’d go along with that because at my age you get a lot of free help from the National Health
Service and if I can give back even a small amount then so be it, that’s very good.
P2 FG5
So I found once I could get a month’s supply done for me, I thought this is great and I’m very pleased.
P4 FG5
I thought well if you get them delivered on a basis where each one is prescribed on a daily basis you can’t
get a surplus, so I’ll give it a whirl and that really is one of the reasons that I joined in because I had
acquired a surplus of metformin, lisinopril and one other one, I forget which one it was. I thought well
perhaps, you know, at the moment – or previously I had to sort of when I was reordering at the chemist,
I would have to say ‘well I won’t have that one this month and on, I won’t have that one’ . . . Well I
thought that by having the tablets supplied on a weekly, daily system, I wouldn’t acquire a surplus.
P2 FG5
Yeah, you wouldn’t stockpile. I found I stockpiled.
P3 FG5
I think deep down we’re all proud that we did it, you know. It’s going to help other people in years to
come isn’t it? It’s nice
P7 FG5
And also nice having people round.

 BOX 8 Reasons to take part in a study of MODs: professionals
Obviously, you know, within the store we’ve got a lot of experience of different levels of DDS, so from
the people that are completely incapable to those that are sort of using it just literally as an aid for
administration and just to see from a different perspective when people are put onto it, perhaps not
necessarily at the recommendation of a GP but through another means, whether it was still sort of a
sustainable thing for them. So although they’d been identified through a specific set, it was sort of
interesting to see, having it come from a different angle, whether or not it would still be beneficial
to them.
HCP4 FG6
. . . it does create a lot of workload for us and it just seemed really interesting to actually find some
research and do some research into, you know, do people really benefit or are we doing it because it feels
like it’s the right thing? But can we have some cold hard stats that say yes, this does help people and so it
will be interesting to find out what happened from there.
HCP2 FG6
. . . Obviously it’s such a labour-intensive process putting them into the DDS packs so it will be quite
interesting to look into the difference it actually makes to people in terms of their compliance because you
think oh, I’m putting all this in here, if they didn’t have it would they actually be just taking it pretty much
the same anyway, therefore it’s not really worthwhile. Or, is it actually make a real difference to people?
I know some people I talk to it does make a real difference but to have a more structured study into it
interests me.
HCP3 FG6
It’s a lot of work. As you say, we don’t know the benefit. I mean a lot of it seems to be sort of initiated by
relatives, just because they don’t want to do it themselves, they get the pharmacist to do it and the
medicine support people say that usually, if a carer’s going in it’s just ordinary boxes is fine. So I just
wanted to contribute to see if we can get some consensus.
HCP6 FG6
From our point of view as a general practice surgery we’re extremely active in the PCRN network and
looking at the study with our patient demographics and the problems we’ve got with compliance with a
number of our patients, it seemed that there was benefit in getting involved in this piece of feasibility
work . . . I think really we were supportive of the feasibility itself. Obviously there’s a number of research
topics you need to take up during the level 2, level 3 initiative and we’re in a fortunate position I suppose
where we can look at these and pick and choose to a certain extent and with the conversations we had
with [research associate], we agreed to support her and see how it went.
HCP1 FG6
Yeah, well in a sense of course I’m very much in [name] position in that I’m the principal person in the
practice who does decide whether we do take part in a study. I mean there are a number of reasons why
we do. A, we’re a level 3 practice so we are committed to taking on recruiting and being involved in a
number of research projects a year. But obviously the other aspect is sort of deciding what ones actually
suit us as a practice. And yeah, we are regularly putting patients onto weekly trays and to look at a project
where it’s actually wondering, you know, is this expensive process actually beneficial at the end of the day,
is quite interesting.

 BOX 9 Comments on communication
I mean I stood back at this stage. As far as I understand the communication was absolutely fine. There was
no problem. Scripting essentially were told: they did what they were told!
HCP7 FG6
We kept given a date and then it would get put back and put back and then they came with these scripts
and said ‘these need doing for Monday’ . . . I was told they all had to be done for a certain date and that’s
why I came in and did late nights and everything to make sure they were done and then it turned out that
they didn’t really need to be all done for that day . . . I got given a bunch of things, as I said ‘we need
these done realistically for such a date’. It gave me about 3, 4, maybe 5 days to get them all done but
nowhere in there did they say to me ‘but, some of these are weekly and they’re going to go out weekly;
some of these are monthly, some of these are two monthly’, so I rushed, did them all and then they sat on
my shelf for several weeks, some of them . . . My other work just got put on hold so that I could get this
out and then they sat on the shelf for several weeks some of them and I was like ‘why?’
HCP5 FG6
And in terms of just communicating, just a final point on communication and specifically with patients, the
end of the trial has been very poorly communicated . . . As to what happens now because obviously from
our perspective the trial is being run by the UEA so we didn’t particularly expect to have to have any input
and we have had quite a few people that have brought their last lot in and gone ‘what happens now?’
HCP4 FG6
I think there’s also a case for like the independence side of things as well for people who are, you know,
we’ve touched on the delivery side of things but also for people that order their own medication as well,
for a couple of people it was a bit kind of ‘so we’re not having to do anything now’ and it’s just that kind
of – and whether or not that would be helped by perhaps a different approach to the initial conversations.
There’s a possibility around that but it certainly did feel from – I don’t know if the others would echo – but
a little bit more I think understanding almost from a pharmacy perspective, from a community pharmacy
perspective, of how DDS works and that then being explained to people would have probably just – things
like explaining around the ordering, around the collection and actually a more kind of ‘yes, you’re going to
be part of this study’ but a real kind of ‘this is step by step exactly, from the pharmacy perspective, how
it’s going to work for you’. And we weren’t there so we can’t say whether or not that was done or not
but it certainly didn’t come across that necessarily it had been.
HCP4 FG6
I found it OK.
HCP6 FG6
Did you?
HCP5 FG6
Yeah. One lady wanted to stay with us but didn’t phone to say she’s gone back to Boots, but she really
wants me to do it. The other ones were fine, they just – one chap was weekly. I got a message through
from UEA saying ‘can you continue to do it but he’d like it monthly?’ so he must have been contacted
and it was very smooth.

 Patient behavioural changes
There is a body of evidence suggesting that participants do change their behaviour when they know they
are being observed. It was therefore a concern that participants may change their usual behaviour as a
result of their being observed. Evidence presented in Box 10 suggests that behaviour may have changed
as a result of trial participation, with participants applying greater care than usual to take their medication
as prescribed.
Impact of study on medical practices and pharmacies
Health-care professionals were asked about the impact of the study on surgeries or pharmacies to identify
any knock-on issues. Representative statements are presented in Box 11. No impact on GP medical
practices was identified (HCP7 FG6). Pharmacists identified that it had encouraged them to consider
practical aspects of provision of MODs (HCP4 FG6, HCP5 FG6). HCP4 FG6 identified that a benefit of
taking part would be patient loyalty to their pharmacy. Pharmacists reported taking a closer look at
patients’ needs as a direct result of the trial (HCP5 FG6).
Pharmacists were required to provide study participants with their medicines according to randomisation
group and to complete a proforma providing error data and resource data for the health economic
analysis. These activities were time-consuming, but, once systems were established, both pharmacists and
GPs found taking part in the study to be easy and acceptable, as evidenced in the interactions presented in
Boxes 12 and 13.
A vehicle for patients to feedback to pharmacists
A number of comments, presented in Box 14, indicated that taking part in the study had an effect on the
pharmacy. Some patients who took part in the trial had asked to stay on MODs (HCP5 FG6). There was
consensus that pharmacists rarely get feedback, particularly when patients have medicines delivered to
them (HCP4 FG6).
Medication-related issues
Under this theme, the subthemes emerging related to the MODs, the removal of medicines, the delivery
of medicines, the return of packaging and wasted medicines.
BOX 10 Changes to usual behaviour
Make sure I take that, make sure I take that, make sure I – whereas other times I know some I must take
and others I’m a little bit thinking oh, I didn’t take so and so and I would take it any old time. But I was
really good, knowing that Big Brother was after us sort of thing, you know. I don’t know about anybody
else . . . It’s amazing what you do, you’re good when you know someone’s – [watching you].

 BOX 11 Impact on surgeries or pharmacies
It’s just a matter of making sure we file everything in our research file . . . No, I think as far as I was
concerned again that was all fairly clear. Actually, as I say, my main role was going to be on checking
recruitment, checking searches and that side of recruitment.
HCP7 FG6
It’s actually very interesting to sit and just think for eight patients over x number of weeks, just those eight,
what that actually amounted to in terms of both dispensing, pharmacist and [accredited checking
technician] time. So for that side of it, yeah, really really useful. Quite scary! [laughing]
HCP4 FG6
It was amazing how much time it took up with all the paperwork. The initial paperwork even, putting
them on our system as, because I wrote that they were all on the UEA trial so that nobody would take
their scripts and do it in another part of the dispensary and stuff. There was just so much input put on.
HCP5 FG6
And primarily the benefit for pharmacies with DDS is that it is virtually 100% lock-in. 95% of the time
those patients will stay with you . . . From that perspective it is. From time, from effort, from any other
perspective it’s a chore.
HCP4 FG6
Because of this trial though, that’s made us look at our patients more closely and we’ve actually
discovered now that patients that we’ve had on there for like 2, 3, maybe 4 years, initially they had Dossit
boxes but now they’ve got carers and nobody’s ever told us that they’ve got carers so they’ve actually got
carers who are just that lazy that they’re not dispensing them themselves, they’re just getting them out the
Dossit boxes, but because of this trial it’s made us look at each individual patient a little bit more and
we’ve actually discovered that there are quite a few that have now got carers who no longer need a Dossit
box because the carer’s responsible for giving it.

 BOX 12 Acceptability of pharmacy activities
Setting up the study
In terms of the actual initial part of it, it was quite time-consuming but once it was done and it was set up,
I mean it’s very much the same sort of set-up that we use once a patient gets set up anyway.
HCP4 FG6
It’s fairly straightforward to understand. It was just
HCP2 FG6
It’s just initially setting it up.
HCP5 FG6
Just writing it out the first time.
HCP2 FG6
Provision of medicines to participants
Yes. Yeah, yeah, for most of the trial and it was very easy, yeah, because they [researchers] took all the
medicines away from them so it was just literally ‘this is what they’re on, can we have prescriptions for
8 weeks of this’ and yeah, it was really straightforward. And the girls did a really good job with it.
HCP2 FG6
Completion of pharmacy proforma
It’s fairly routine isn’t it?
HCP4 FG6
Yeah, it’s quite simple.
HCP5 FG6
BOX 13 Acceptability of GP practice activities
Well I think our prescribing team just weren’t sure initially what they were going to be asking from the
point of what prescriptions were going to be required, would it be weekly or monthly, were they going to
be chopping and changing, were different things going to be asked at different times? But actually it just
didn’t come down to that. They knew the set of patients and actually [name and name] would phone up
and he just got in contact and said ‘actually, I need 28 days of this patient’s drugs’ and then you sorted it
out. I mean that was – I sort of took a step backwards at that stage and I haven’t really had to have any
more involvement. So that’s my impression. I mean [name] you were with our practice for the most part
weren’t you?

 Medication Organisation Devices
Patient perspectives on MODs are presented in Box 15. Medicines not included in the MODs were of
concern (P6 FG5, P2 FG5), so it may be that better arrangements need to be made to integrate them into
the system, such as synchronisation of supply. In addition to this, there were comments on difficulties in
getting pills out of the box (P4 FG5, P1 FG6) and the usefulness of the MOD as an aide-mémoire.
Isolation of non-study medicines
Medicines were isolated from participants’ immediate use to prevent inadvertent use of previous supply
instead of the study supply. They were placed into clear plastic bags which were sealed with a cable tie
and stored in the usual place that participants stored medicines. The idea was that patients would cut
through the bag to release medicines at the end of the study or could do so during the study if for any
reason their planned medication supply was disrupted.
Removal of medicines was expected to cause participants the greatest concern. However, no negative
sentiments were expressed, participants seemed relaxed about the medication removal process (P2 FG5) and
it was readily accepted (Box 16). However, the focus group identified that some patients had difficulty getting
into their medicines after the study (P4 FG5) and that inadvertent or even deliberate taking of removed
medicines during the study would be very difficult without it being obvious to researchers (P7 FG5).
BOX 14 Feedback for pharmacists
We’ve got three patients that had never even thought about having a Dossit box, never even knew it
existed, that came on the trial and all three of them have asked to stay with us to stay and have a Dossit
box and two of them have said that their health is so much better because they were forgetting their
tablets previously and one man’s absolutely made up and he’s like ‘I feel so much better because I know I
was forgetting my medication and stuff’ and he’s just so grateful now that he knows that there is such a
service, because there’s a lot of people that don’t even know the service exists.
HCP5 FG6
And I think quite a lot of the time you put somebody onto a DDS tray and perhaps we don’t get – or we
put them onto an assisted medication and we don’t actually necessarily get the feedback from the patient.
HCP4 FG6
Especially a lot from the delivery patients.
HCP3 FG6
Exactly. It just becomes kind of we do it on a monthly basis and the compliance side of things or the
improvement in health is perhaps something that, you know, is fed back maybe through the GP or
perhaps doesn’t get fed back through to pharmacy.
HCP4 FG6
Yeah, because some of ours, they’ve been going for like maybe 3 or 4 years and they started 3 or 4 years
ago. You don’t know, you know, you don’t get any feedback whatsoever. I don’t even know what some
of my patients look like because they’ve had them for that long and they don’t come in, so it was really
nice to actually have customers come in and actually speak to you about it and say how they felt about
the box. It’s good.

 BOX 15 Medication organisation devices
I found the pill boxes were a limited help. What I got was five pills in daily doses but I’m also on warfarin
and warfarin really is depending on your INR [International Normalised Ratio] tests, so that was excluded
from the test. And also like my friend here, I’m on eye drops three times a day and they were excluded.
So while it was helpful in a way, it wasn’t totally helpful. I still had to budget how to order eye drops
and warfarin.
P6 FG6
Yeah, that’s right. If you’ve got two or three items that are separate from the pills, you’ve still got to go to
the pharmacy to pick them up.
P2 FG6
Of course with our ones, sometimes the pill sticks to it doesn’t it when it goes out?
P4 FG6
I find it a bit hard to press that. I don’t know why because my hands are painful and I really try hard to
open that.
P1 FG6
Again it’s elderly people like a friend of mine who’s died recently, she was getting confused but her
daughter would ring her and say ‘have you taken your tablets?’ and she’d say ‘yes, I think so’ so she’d say
‘well go and have a look. What have you got there?’, ‘I’ve got Wednesday’, ‘well it’s Thursday today’.
So those are a help for her. So she says ‘so you didn’t take yesterday’s’, you know. And I think it was
worrying her too but that may come to all of us. We don’t know, do we?

BOX 16 Participants’ comments about removal of medicines
But to get into them, did you say you managed to get into them? It’s very difficult isn’t it?

Well it was one of those little fiddly things that you think –well I got a pair of scissors and cut through it
. . . So it’s in bits if they want it . . . I thought can I take them out and nobody will know that I’ve been
there. You just could not.
P7 FG5
A sense of loss having my tablets taken away from me. [laughing] And tied up in a bag. [laughing] All
those surplus ones. [laughing] But no, it was easy.
P2 FG5
No, I thought it was excellent. The fact that it was – well it was professional, it was done properly, you
know, and you can’t fault it from that point of view . . . Yeah, it was good.

 Removing old medicines was another important change. Patients on monthly medicines, by virtue of
non-adherence and mixed pack sizes, for example 28- or 30-day pack, have a range of medicines in their
possession that are at varying stages of use (full packs/half packs/nearly empty packs). Maintaining supply
can therefore necessitate a high degree of organisation (P4 FG5, P2 FG5). The timing of visits to see the
GP when new medicines are prescribed also impacts on this problem (HCP7 FG6). By removing previous
medicines and supplying everything as new that degree of complexity has been removed. It is likely that
alignment of supply could have a positive impact on adherence. Comments on alignment of medicines are
presented in Box 17.
Delivery of medicines
Patients who were randomised to a weekly supply had their medicines delivered to them, patients on a
monthly supply who usually had medicines delivered continued to have their medicines delivered to them
and those who usually collected their medicines continued to collect them. Medicine deliveries were the
aspect of the study eliciting most negative feedback and causing most concern. Comments pertaining to
delivery and collection are presented in Box 18. Although the principle of delivery was acknowledged as
potentially useful (P4 FG5), in practice, delivery in rural areas was problematic (P2 FG5). Erratic delivery or
collection occurred for some (P7 FG5, P8 FG5), whereas others had no problem (P6 FG5) and it is intuitive
that there would be more problems for weekly than for monthly delivery (eight deliveries compared with
two; P7 FG5). Late and missed deliveries caused real inconvenience to patients (P2 FG5).
Health-care professionals identified confusion in patients who did not know why they had been allocated
to delivery when they were happy to collect, annoyance in allocation to delivery in others and a
misunderstanding on timing of collections (HCP4 FG6, HCP5 FG6, HCP3 FG6). Importantly, apart from the
annoyance of waiting in for a delivery that did not materialise, it was identified that removal of autonomy
with respect to collection of medicines made some patients feel vulnerable (HCP5 FG6). One participant
suggested that patients should be asked whether they wanted to collect their medicines or to have
it delivered.
BOX 17 Participants’ comments about advantages of the system
Well I found that I was getting fed up with trying to get through on the phone to get repeat prescriptions
and I take about nine different types of medication all over 10 tablets a day and I could never get them to
coincide with timing.
P4 FG5
Yeah, I had thoughts about it because I take quite a lot of pills like most people and because the amount
you take per day you don’t necessarily tie up with the amount you get in the boxes, you can end up with
a surplus on certain types.
P2 FG5
Because I think one of the problems is when we add in another antihypertensive and it’s out of synch with
their other drugs, you know, having somebody who then gets it all into sync again would be really helpful
and in a sense I just wonder whether that – I mean it may be that that is as important as sophisticated
time release boxes.

 BOX 18 Participants’ experiences of collection and delivery
One thing I would say about that, I mean although I’m 21 up here and 90 down there, you know, I’m still
mobile enough to go into the chemist and pick up things. But for someone who’s got a problem, either
they live too far away or got mobility problems, it’s a godsend. Perhaps I shouldn’t have been on the
programme but I can see the fors and the against.
P4 FG5
But when it came to the actual working of the system, it fell down badly for me. I don’t know about other
people. Probably because I live out in the sticks a bit. And out of the eight deliveries, three were missed
and in the end I said ‘forget about it, I’ll collect them from the dispensary’. But then the next bloke who
came along after I said I didn’t want to have them delivered, he delivered them perfectly and he said ‘dead
easy to find. Sat nav brought me straight to your drive’. But three of them, I don’t suppose they could find
an ice-cream shop in Sorrento, you know.
P2 FG5
Well I had a funny experience too. [research associate] brought me my quota for the week on the
Thursday, right, so my own tablets were put away. Saturday afternoon another one came so I thought oh,
but that had number 2 on it so I thought right, now I’ve got 1 and 2. The next week number 3 came and
4 and then I thought oh and then I didn’t get any. So I went into the chemist and said ‘look, I’ve got four
which I’ve now started on, but nobody’s delivered number 5’. They looked around and they said ‘oh here
it is’, so I said ‘look, next week I’ll collect it myself’ and when I got there ‘no, we haven’t got one’ and they
said ‘here it is’ so I took it. When I’d finished it and put all my little boxes in it, it was number 7. So
number 6 is somewhere. Nobody’s got it.
P7 FG5
I think the delivery leaves a lot to be desired because they say that they’re going to deliver on such and
such a day, you get down to almost 1 or 2 tablets and you panic because you think you won’t get them
and you ring and tell them ‘oh but we delivered to you on Saturday’ – this probably is on Wednesday –
and eventually obviously they have to come out and deliver so yeah, it is a bit hit and miss, delivery.
P8 FG5
It seemed to work all right for me. I got the first delivery at my home and that was four weekly packs and
they were numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 . . . Towards the end of the fourth week I phoned up the pharmacy and
said ‘I’m on this trial, have you got the next consignment?’, ‘yes, if you come and collect them’, which I
did and it seemed to work.
P6 FG5
Yes, I suppose that was better them doing it a month at a time rather than individual weeks, which mine
were you see. And then [research associate] said ‘they’re supposed to deliver it to you’, I said ‘well number
2 was missing. I’d got 1 and 3 but not number 2’, so I said ‘now, I’m collecting it’. So we ended up with
me collecting it, apart from the two that were delivered one Saturday afternoon.
P7 FG5
Well the thing that was annoying was waiting in all day Saturday when they were scheduled to deliver
and then nothing turned up . . . So we went shopping about 8 o’clock at night.

 Return of packaging
For successful adherence assessment in a definitive trial, return of medication packaging to the pharmacy
would be required. Return is necessary in the case of DUC so that counts can be made without the need
for an additional researcher visit and in the case of electronic monitoring so that data can be downloaded
and monitoring units can be recycled onto new packs. Returns would be planned to coincide with usual
pharmacy or patient delivery and collection, that is when a patient picks up their new supply they deposit
their previous packs. Despite one-to-one and group training sessions, provision of itemised information
sheets and SOPs for pharmacies and GPs and provision of containers in which to place medicines for
return and explanation to patients at visits, it is clear that this aspect of the study design has been
challenging. Information regarding pack return was either not retained or misunderstood by pharmacists
and patients alike as evidenced by comments presented in Box 19.
Pharmacists indicated that they were unaware that packaging had to be returned to the pharmacy
(HCP5 FG5) and that some patients may have been unaware of the requirement (HCP2 FG5).
BOX 18 Participants’ experiences of collection and delivery (continued)
And I think we had, you know, probably 50% of the patients that we actually took on weren’t questioned
about that and when it came to us doing it, it was ‘yeah, you need to deliver this on a Friday or a
Saturday’, so we sent them all out and 50% of the patients came back in and said ‘why am I suddenly
getting this delivered to me? I’ve never had it before, I’m quite happy to come in’. So that’s just something
that you’ll probably need to add, you know, if you were going to do it on a larger scale to that initial,
if that was an initial face-to-face conversation rather than a mailing process, that would certainly need to
be included.
HCP4 FG6
We did have a couple that said ‘oh yes, we’ll definitely collect’, the others were just like ‘oh they’re all
definitely deliveries’ and we had a couple that were like ‘I’m not going to be in every Friday to receive my
box! Once a month would have done me’, you know, there was quite a bit of – one bloke was really
harassed because he got a delivery because he’d got a dog and then it wakes his wife up. You know,
I think they do need to be asked thoroughly ‘Do you want it to be delivered? Do you want a collection?’
HCP5 FG6
There was definitely some confusion, like some of the people who – well, one lady in particular who was
meant to be collecting. I think she was just on the monthly so she was only coming in once but she kept
trying to come in early for it and I was saying ‘no, it needs to be regulated so they can see what’s going
on’ and then she came in again and in the end I just let her have it a couple of days early because it was
just getting a bit ridiculous. But people didn’t seem to understand fully how it was meant to be working
when they were used to just ordering their own medication to then be told ‘that’s all right, we’re sorting
it out for you, don’t worry, just come in on this date’. They sort of seemed a bit anxious and wanted to
come and pick it up earlier and not follow how I thought it was meant to be working.
HCP3 FG6
They feel vulnerable because it’s like ‘what if the driver can’t get here? What if you haven’t done it?
What if you’ve forgotten me?’

 Wasted medicines
Quarantining of existing drug stocks at the study start highlighted for professional participants the
stockpiling and potential waste of medicines in patients’ homes and reminded them of Christmas
and Easter ordering patterns. This is illustrated by comments presented in Box 20.
Study tools
This theme included the subthemes of participants’ comments on the test of participants’ ability,
electronic monitoring and the return to usual care.
Tests of participant ability
Participant functional abilities were tested in order to assess the appropriateness of MOD supply.
Comments on the tests used are presented in Box 21. No negative comments were received.
BOX 19 Participants’ comments on return of packaging
Can I just say one thing though? When it was first done as well, nobody at any point said to us that when
you’re delivering out you’ve got to collect their old boxes back each week, OK. Nobody said nothing and
we had a couple that were brought in. We got rid of them because nobody told us that we was to keep
them. It was only halfway through that someone said ‘actually, you’re supposed to be keeping those
boxes and actually, could you make a delivery and actually do a double delivery so that they bring back
the old boxes?’. We weren’t told that till halfway through so half our stuff, half the patients’ stuff is
missing because we was never told that – as far as I was concerned they was going to be left at the
patient’s house and at the end somebody would collect it all and it was only halfway through that
someone actually said ‘oh actually, they’re supposed to be bringing them back every week’. Well we
should have been told that at the beginning. We actually got rid of some of it.
HCP5 FG6
In a similar vein, I don’t know if all the patients had that explained as well or whether they understood it.
It could be that they’d just forgotten but we had one patient who had been having the packs and when
she’d finished one, she would just chuck it out in the rubbish and she said that she hadn’t been told she
had to hold onto them, although she had been given one of the large bags so I wondered whether she
just hadn’t either understood the message or retained the message. But I think she chucked away two or
three of them before I phoned her and spoke to her and she said ‘oh, I’ve been chucking them away’ and
I obviously told her ‘no, don’t do that!’. . . But whether that was just a communication thing or whether
that was just, you know, that particular patient not retaining the information, I’m not sure.

 BOX 20 Participants’ comments on stockpiling of medicines and waste
Well I feel that some people, they actually order everything on the list every month and they’ve probably
not even used half of it, just because they can. Then you go to the house and they’ve got this store
of medication.
HCP5 FG6
I’m sure you would have seen a lot more patients’ houses than us and I’m guessing you’ve found some
HCP2 FG6
Were you in the surgery that day when I dumped those bags?
HCP7 FG6
Oh, the eleven or twelve bin bags?
HCP2 FG6
Those big plastic bin bags and I said, you know, we could
HCP7 FG6
I’ve never seen anything like that.
HCP2 FG6
From that patient’s house.
HCP7 FG6
Yeah. Unbelievable.
HCP2 FG6
They’d been hoarded. I mean of course we hear the other side though because the patients sometimes
come in and say ‘oh the pharmacy is ordering my drugs and I just don’t want all these’. So you know
we get the other side . . .
HCP7 FG6
People do like medication.
HCP6 FG6
Stockpiling.

It’s a very reassuring thing to have some medication there and there’s enough for the next – [laughing]

 Electronic monitoring
Electronic monitoring was part of the original study design but was not implemented during the trial.
Exploration of electronic monitoring issues identified mixed feelings. These are represented in Box 22.
One interaction correctly identified that monitoring of packs cannot identify that a patient has ingested the
medicines and therefore could be considered an expensive waste of money (P7 FG5). One indicated that
they thought its use showed a lack of confidence in the patient but it is not clear whether this was a lack
of confidence in ability or honesty (P4 FG5). One participant thought it would be helpful for people with
dementia (P4 FG5), while another thought it would be worrying for a person with ‘real’ (perhaps meaning
severe) dementia (P6 FG5).
Health-care professionals were very much in favour of electronic monitoring and identified with its clinical
utility rather than research application. They expressed an interest in identifying the details of what people
were really doing and the importance of having an objective way to determine that.
BOX 21 Acceptability of tests of functional ability
Visual acuity test
I think it’s right. They’ve got to satisfy themselves that you can read these things, which is repeated I
notice in this questionnaire.
P4 FG5
I’ve got good eyesight for reading and yes she did, she asked me, I said ‘well how far down?’ and I think
I read the one from the bottom, so I don’t think she bothered to test me any more on that.
P7 FG5
Cognitive ability test
I was a little amused about the trial on one’s memory . . . But I thought that was good, just to indicate
whether you are really in trouble with your memory, but I think most of us probably couldn’t remember
everything. I didn’t! [laughing]
P4 FG5
Well it was quite good really. I must admit, I sat there thinking am I really going through a memory test at
my age? But it just proved that I did need it because I did, she came back to it straight afterwards and said
‘can you remember what I said to you just now?’ and I said ‘yes, apple and – oh dear, I’ve forgotten the
other one’. It was only seconds but I’ve remembered it ever since.

 BOX 22 Perceptions of electronic monitoring
I can’t see how it would work though. I mean right, fair enough, you pop it but there’s no proof that
you’ve actually taken it.
P7 FG5
No, there isn’t.
I (moderator)
So to me that would be an absolute waste of money.
P7 FG5
I thought the same thing.
P4 FG5
Did you?
P7 FG5
Yes I did. And I thought
P4 FG5
I thought all that money, there’s no proof that you’ve taken it. You could have thrown it down the toilet.
P7 FG5
And furthermore, it did suggest that the whole scheme has got a lack of confidence in the patient.
P4 FG5
Yes.
P7 FG5
Which is not good.
P4 FG5
Yes, that’s true. I hadn’t thought of it that way but I could see this is an easy way that people – because
there’s no proof they’ve taken it, is there? Mind you, you should do for your own sake.
P7 FG5
Well if it could be developed it must be of help to those with dementia but as you say, the technology’s
not quite there yet. But no doubt the research will be going on.
P6 FG5
But then you see with a dementia patient, real dementia, they would need someone to do it for them to
make sure they took it, because I’ve looked after my mother-in-law and there’s no way she would have
ever taken a pill if I hadn’t run around after her saying ‘come on, come’ and all that. I had a friend who’s,
well, on the borders of it which as I said a little while ago she’s recently died – she was 88 – and there’s
no way she would have taken her tablets yet she could go to the shops, come back, ring me, talk and
that, but these pills she just could not remember to take them. So I can’t see where that would have
helped her. But maybe, you see, it helps some people.

84
 Well, I think one of the things that intrigued me, I have to say if it comes down to brass tacks, is these
super-duper fancy gizmo reporting Dossit boxes that [research associate] told us about at the very
beginning and how they’re actually going to work with these time stamped little chippy things in them.
HCP1 FG6
It was a bit disappointing to not have the films because that sounded really good, that you could actually
see what time they had actually gone to take the medicine, not ‘yes, I take it in the morning’ and you’d
never actually know. So then it obviously hasn’t delivered the amount of detail that perhaps we thought it
would do at the start and that seemed something quite novel to find out actually when are they going into
the box rather than just send it out and then it comes back empty but you don’t know when they’ve – they
might have just done it all at the end of the week and put them all in the bin for all we know.
HCP3 FG6
Yes, I mean the high-tech stuff did look really interesting and it was going to be – It was going to be
really, really interesting to see what people are actually doing and so that was a bit disappointing.
HCP2 FG6
And that’s where the technological side of things would – I don’t want to keep dredging it up but that
would have been, you know, that would have been a real – and I think for all of us, from all the various,
it’s a real shame and I’m sure your lot agree as well!
HCP4 FG6
Yeah, because I think you’re only going to – I’m not sure how many answers one can get through just
using the weekly trays. I think it really does need a better way or a sort of clearer way of looking at actual
concordance – as medical students are now told to say rather than compliance – so I think yeah, it will
take more than that.
HCP7 FG6
The latest version of the Pivotel actually has a mobile phone chip in it and if you are non-concordant,
rather than non-compliant, it will actually phone up a pre-designated mobile phone and alert somebody.
Also if it falls over on its back or something and it isn’t picked up again, it will phone them. So there’s
levels of sophistication in these devices now that are becoming affordable.
HCP1 FG6
Well I think there are a number of issues. As a GP going into these patients’ homes and seeing how the
boxes are used, you do see quite haphazard use with the boxes and I think you know, that has got to be
somehow looked at because, you know, you can even have something that times when they take it out
but what you still can’t be sure is whether it actually ends up in their mouth and there is going to be a
limit to what you can do but certainly timing when the various pockets are opened is crucial because I can
certainly tell you that, you know, I know some of the ones, the boxes that come back to yourselves, they
can look quite haphazard can’t they? Well we can see that haphazard arrangement just in the home.
You’ll suddenly see some tablets here and you’ve got this nice box and you realise that they’ve

 Return to usual care
Health-care professionals discussed difficulties surrounding the return to usual care at the end of the study.
The possibility that patients may wish for continuation of their medication in a MOD had been carefully
considered and ethical approval had been given for participants expressing such a wish to be referred to
the Norfolk Medicines Support service by researchers or pharmacists. There was no plan to ask patients in
receipt of a MOD for the study to be approached to determine whether or not they would like to continue
on one. This position was clearly documented.
Most (22 out of 23) participants completing the RCT continued in the care of their usual pharmacist for
the duration of the trial. All had been enrolled on the automatic order and collect scheme on recruitment
to the study. They were informed that researchers would deregister them from the scheme on request. No
participants requested deregistration. Pharmacist perceptions were that ‘the end of the trial has been very
poorly communicated’ (HCP4 FG6) and this would include return to usual care. Comments on return to
usual care are presented in Box 23. Although in some cases the return to usual care was smooth (HCP6
FG5) there was some consensus that a final visit or post-study pharmacy consultation with the patient
would have been beneficial (HCP5 FG6, HCP4 FG6, HCP5 FG6).
Definitive study design considerations
In this final section, comments which would inform a future study are reported under the subthemes of
issues for future participation, the types of patients to include and the way the study should be managed.
BOX 23 Comments on return to usual care
One lady wanted to stay with us but didn’t phone to say she’s gone back to [name], but she really wants
me to do it. The other ones were fine, they just – one chap was weekly. I got a message through from
UEA saying ‘Can you continue to do it but he’d like it monthly?’ so he must have been contacted and it
was very smooth.
HCP6 FG6
Because I felt I had to ring UEA and say ‘what is going on? What is happening to these patients?’ because
then they were like ‘so [company name] have let us down now’, ‘no, [company name] haven’t let you
down. We’ve done as we were told. We’ve done your 8 weeks, we did it as, you know’ – and there was
one man that was like ‘I’ve come to [company name] for years, I’ve done this for you and now you’ve let
me down’, but it wasn’t us that let him down, it was the UEA that let him down.
HCP5 FG6
There just needs to be an understanding of the impact, like on the patient, I think and actually for
something that is a complete change in terms of medication, there has to be some form of planned-in
consultation at the end.
HCP4 FG6
I think they should have had a last visit on the last week. I honestly think they should have had somebody
go out to them and say ‘This is your last week. After today, you know, can you sort your prescriptions out
because in a few days you’re going to run out of tablets’? I think they should have had a last
visit, definitely.

 Issues for future participation
General experiences were mixed, but the overall response to the question ‘So then, now, having been
through it, if you had your time over again, would you still have said yes?’ from all patients that
commented was a resounding ‘yes’, indicating that, in general, the experience had been a positive one.
Participants indicated willingness, ability and capacity to take part in a definitive study. While, overall, there
was probably a net benefit to GP practices in terms of time, this was not the case for pharmacies. Should
larger numbers of patients be involved per pharmacy in any future study, it would be challenging from
both organisational and financial perspectives (Boxes 24 and 25).
Types of patient
Health-care professionals described the type of patients who should be considered for additional help with
adherence, that is who are suited to MODs and therefore to a definitive study. Comments are presented in
Box 26 and indicate that those who collect medicines on a haphazard basis (HCP7 FG6, HCP2 FG6) or who
run out of medicines (HCP7 FG6) should be targeted.
BOX 24 Organisational capacity to partake in a definitive study
Patient management if you like, you know, with the way we work with our surgery all of our patients
don’t actually, very rarely, order their medication at all now once they’re on a DDS tray. The changes are
done and liaised direct from the GP, through the GP’s practice to the pharmacy and it’s very much a
managed and organised service where the patient has little involvement. So in terms of the bigger scale I
don’t think it would have – it would have an impact in terms of the workload of the increased number but
it wouldn’t be any different from the current way it’s done in pharmacy. That would be my
HCP4 FG6
Because of the nature of the DDS, because it is so labour intensive, we have to organise it. If not, they’d
come in ‘I need my 4 weeks’, ‘Do you want to wait for an hour?’, so that’s why we do take on organising
it because if not, if you left it to the patient some of them, you know, that is what would happen, they
would just appear and it’s just impossible.
HCP3 FG6
I’m not sure we could take on that much more. . . My workload really did go up because I had so much
that I had to do because I literally did it on my own and it was the ordering of the [???], it was doing all
the paperwork. There was just so much and so many more man hours that it took to physically do them
people because it weren’t as straightforward as just being on the computer like normal, we’ve got our
sheets already done. We had to redo all the sheets, we had to put a lot of input into it and I felt that the
patients we had was enough because we have got such a big workload anyway of patients. They were
umming and arring whether they were actually even going to let us do it because we have got so many.
HCP5 FG6
I think you’re going to find, in terms of a pharmacy perspective, it’s going to be on an individual pharmacy
basis as to what their current running capacity is and what, you know, it would have to be negotiated
almost on a one-to-one basis that these are the patients that we’ve identified, can you support that? If
you came to us tomorrow and said ‘can you support 40 additional patients?’ I’d chase you out the
building. [laughing]
HCP4 FG6
And that is something that moving forward would have to be looked at and I’m sure that’s not just,
you know, [pharmacy name], that is each individual pharmacy as you go round the area.

That’s my understanding.
HCP7 FG6
DDS in pharmacy is patient care, it’s not a profit.
HCP4 FG6
It’s not a profit, no. So it would be important that if you add that much then the cost would have to be
done properly and you couldn’t take it on just on that basis.
HCP7 FG6
On that basis, no. And I think without, because of the workload that’s involved and the way it works,
it would almost be a prior costing which isn’t always feasible within research or within projects.
HCP4 FG6
And therein lies the problem. It’s not as if we can get to the stage where you can say right, we’re going to
give you forty and here is x amount of funding. It’s very much once we get to the end of it we’ll sort of –
but without actually knowing that.
HCP4 FG6
You see we had no budget to have an extra person in to help with their boxes, so I was coming in on my
day off, I stayed late, I came in early, because we wanted to be part of it and I didn’t mind doing that as a
one-off but I wouldn’t want to do that on a regular basis because – because the money wasn’t there to
begin with to say ‘right, you can have x amount of staff and you can have so many extra hours so we’ll
get somebody in’, there wasn’t that available so I had to just make myself available. So yeah, it was
hard work.
HCP5 FG6
I think they had a lot more workload than we ended up with. I think the initial stage was fairly easy but
ultimately we only had a couple of people finish on the final stage so we didn’t really, you know, it was
very hard to compare. I think if we had had
HCP2 FG6
You see we still had eight at the end.

Yeah. We all know that people that we see twice a week in our pharmacy coming in and they’re the ones
where you’re thinking, you know, I’ve seen you so many times recently, what’s going on and it can’t

‘oh my God, I’ve run out of my medicines, I’ve got none for tonight and it’s those

Yeah, I mean there’s the patients who run out of their medication at a weekend. I mean quite often those
aren’t always the elderly . . . I mean with doing out of hours, you know, sometimes those can be young
people who haven’t got a Ventolin inhaler and that sort of thing.

 Summary
The secondary outcome measures of participant satisfaction and autonomy associated with medicine-taking
were captured in a final trial evaluation questionnaire, which also captured satisfaction with the trial process
and is reported in this chapter. This chapter further evaluated the study design implemented in Chapter 4
using two group discussions: one comprising eight study participants, the other comprising five members of
staff from the participating pharmacies and two members of medical practice staff involved in the study.
The trial evaluation questionnaire was completed by 91% of the 23 participants who completed the trial.
MOD weekly was consistently scored highest or equal highest for all criteria related to medication
packaging, although no significant differences were observed in this small sample. No indication of any
difference in participant-perceived autonomy in terms of their confidence and anxiety related to the
method of medication packaging was observed between the randomisation groups. Carer evaluation of
the effect of medication packaging on participant autonomy resulted in no significant differences between
groups. There was, however, a trend towards carers reporting less positive evaluations for participants
randomised to monthly usual packaging.
From the focus group discussions, the trial design, including the questionnaires, DUC and assessment of
cognitive and physical function, was generally considered acceptable. From the participant and medical
practice perspectives, the communication experience with the research team was good. Some pharmacy
representatives, however, felt that greater clarity of processes was required. A particular concern is that
some pharmacy staff did not retain returned medication packaging for DUC; thus, there were a number of
deviations from the SOPs on which they received training. It was clear that trial involvement did present a
significant burden to pharmacies and, thus, it is essential that any future study ensures that participating
pharmacies have the required resources to fulfil the trial dispensing and management requirements.
Some participants allocated to weekly medication supply, and thus delivery, were dissatisfied with this
element, as they found that deliveries were sometimes late and erratic, which presented significant
inconvenience. Any future study should thus provide participants with the choice of delivery or collection.

  Chapter 6 Cost-effectiveness of different
recruitment strategies
Introduction
Successful recruitment in terms of numbers and costs are key to the success of any trial and particularly
important for large-scale definitive studies. Two recruitment strategies were devised and used under the
RCT. Results were compared to inform the most appropriate recruitment strategy for a definitive study.
While passive recruitment via medical practice invitation letters is convenient in terms of research
administration, response rates have historically been low,16,34 as the method requires the patient to be
proactive in responding to a letter of invitation; consent rates are frequently between 30% and 40%.16,34
Active recruitment processes such as waiting room recruitment by researcher, which are potentially more
labour intensive and thus costly, have yielded substantially higher response rates.35–38 Given these potential
differences, we sought to compare the cost-effectiveness of these two types of recruitment strategies.
Methods
Recruitment was carried out as described in Chapter 4. The two recruitment strategies adopted were:
l
passive (postal) recruitment (questionnaire sent from the patient’s GP)
l
active (face-to-face) recruitment by GP and researcher.
Briefly, all GP practices (regardless of strategy) undertook a search of their patient lists to identify those
who were potentially eligible, that is who were aged ≥ 75 years and taking three or more SODF
medications, two of which were from a defined list (see Table 16). GPs checked lists of patients identified
by the aforementioned search to determine their suitability for participation. Subsequent actions for each
of the two recruitment strategies were as follows.
Recruitment strategies
Passive recruitment:
l
Mailshot recruitment pack sent to eligible patients from the patient’s GP, comprising PIL, consent form,
request and collect repeat prescription form, invitation letter (on headed paper), questionnaire 1
and a pre-paid return envelope. A reminder letter, on headed paper, was sent to non-responding
potential recruits.
Active recruitment by general practitioner and researcher:
l
Practice staff flagged any attending patients who were identified by the aforementioned search on the
patient database.
l
On attendance the GP/nurse briefly explained that there was a trial going on, provided a PIL and asked
the patient to see the researcher in the waiting room if interested in taking part in the trial.
l
Patients who chose to speak to the researcher and were interested in taking part, they were provided
with a recruitment pack (as for passive recruitment but without GP invitation letter) to fill in at the
surgery or to take away with them as they preferred.

93
 Active recruitment took place over a 3-week period for each practice. At the end of that period all
potentially eligible participants who had been identified by GP searches were posted recruitment packs.
Some participants who were registered in the three active recruitment practices were therefore recruited
via the mailshot process. These participants are not included in the analyses, which sought only to
compare the efficiency of the two recruitment strategies.
For each recruitment strategy, efficiency was assessed in relation to two measures:
i. the number of people who consented to take part
ii. the number of people who were randomised.
The former was chosen to enable simple comparison of consent rates between strategies. The latter was
chosen to examine eligibility rates for consenting participants between recruitment strategies. Consenting
participants may exhibit one of three adherence types: intentional non-adherence, full adherence or
unintentional non-adherence. Only unintentionally non-adherent participants were eligible for randomisation.
The recruitment strategy may differentially affect consent and eligibility rates, and therefore randomisation
rate, and it may be that different proportions of consenting participants in each recruitment group are later
identified as ineligible. For example, it may be that by explaining the study to the patient in person, a lower
percentage of non-eligible people (e.g. intentionally non-adherent) will give consent.
Consenting eligible participants were subsequently visited, and provided with 1 month’s supply of medication
(visit 1). They were visited again 3 weeks later to determine adherence (visit 2). If they were < 100% adherent,
were still otherwise eligible and wished to continue in the study, they were randomised.
Costs associated with the activities listed for each of the recruitment strategies, plus costs associated with
both visits 1 and 2 (excluding medication prescribed) were estimated. Medication costs were excluded as,
although participants were given 1 month’s supply of medication at visit 1, this was akin to them receiving
their next month’s supply earlier than would otherwise have been the case (they continued with their old
stock after visit 2 if they were not randomised into the study). Costs were based on the 2012/13 financial
year, as this was the time of recruitment (active recruitment took place between September and November
2012, and passive recruitment was undertaken in the three practices between August and September
2012). At the time of analysis, health-care professional costs were available only for the financial year
2011/12 and, thus, these were inflated by 2.6% (the rate of Hospital and Community Health Services
pay inflation between 2010/11 and 2011/12) to provide estimated 2012/13 costs. Subsequently, costs
associated with each strategy (excluding visit costs) were compared with the number who consented via
each strategy (visit costs were excluded as the visits took place after consent was provided), and when visit
costs were included the overall costs associated with each strategy were compared with the number who
were randomised.
The costing method used varied according to the item costed. For example, when assigning the researcher
time in the surgery to the individual participants, the top-down costing method81 was used, whereby the
total cost of the researcher time was equally apportioned across the appropriate participants. Conversely,
when estimating the costs associated with a visit to the participant’s home, the method was more akin to
the bottom-up approach,81 as the resources associated with different cost items were estimated on an
individual participant basis (although no particular questionnaire was completed prospectively to monitor
these items).

 Results
Passive recruitment
Passive (postal) recruitment took place in three practices and a total of 995 patients were identified as
potentially eligible, based on a search of the three practice lists. Each of these practices was paid a £175
set-up fee. GPs excluded 185 of the 995 patients (no additional cost to the aforementioned £175 was
added for this activity) and subsequently 810 were sent recruitment packs. The cost of each recruitment
pack sent was estimated to be £1.28 (including postage, but excluding the cost of return postage),
which included the PIL (£0.12), consent form and request and collect repeat prescription form (£0.05),
questionnaire 1 (£0.16), a pre-paid return envelope (£0.04) and postage (£0.90). Thus, the total cost of
sending all recruitment packs amounted to £1036.80 (Table 32). After a further 2–3 weeks, a total of 703
non-responders were subsequently sent a reminder recruitment pack (unit cost = £1.28). In total, 152
people responded (return postage unit cost = £0.48), of whom 135 returned questionnaire 1 only and 113
returned both questionnaire 1 and the consent form. Table 32 shows the costs associated with each
aforementioned component part. When these were assumed and divided by the number who consented,
the cost per consent obtained amounted to £22.40.
Active recruitment/consent rate
Active recruitment was also undertaken in three practices, where 987 patients were identified as
potentially eligible, based on a search of the three practice lists. Again, each of these practices were paid
£175 set-up fee and the cost of the search was assumed to equate to this value. When any of the 987
patients who were suitable to participate made a routine appointment to see their GP, the researcher was
informed and attended the relevant surgery. The average distance to each surgery was estimated to be
10 miles (mileage was reimbursed at £0.45 per mile in the study) and, thus, the travel cost associated with
each GP surgery visit equated to £9.00. Across the three practices a total of 45 visits were made, giving an
estimated total travel cost of £405.00.

 The average salary of the researchers who undertook the surgery visits in this study was estimated to be
£26,000. Assuming salary on-costs (employers’ national insurance and superannuation contribution)
equated to 24% of the salary cost and that they worked 37.5 hours per week 42 weeks per year, the cost
per hour of researcher time was £20.47. Based on an average speed of 29.9 miles per hour (mph), which
is the average free-flow vehicle speed in a 30 mph limit,82 then it would take 2.01 minutes to travel 1 mile
and the researcher time associated with the 20-mile round trip would thereby be 40.13 minutes. The cost
of the researcher time associated with travel thereby amounted to £616.15 (see Table 32).
The time associated with each visit to the practice was as follows. The researcher was assumed to arrive
15 minutes before the time of the first pre-arranged participant appointment. This was important, as older
patients often arrive well in advance of their appointment. The researcher would then be visible at the
time the receptionist made the patient aware of the presence of the researcher. It also allowed time for
preparation (arranging desk/chairs in position, sorting paperwork and checking for cancellations with the
receptionist) so that researchers were available to speak to any potentially eligible participant who
approached them after their appointment with the GP/practice nurse. Researcher time at the practice was
dependent on how many potentially eligible participants had appointments in that session. Additionally,
it was assumed researchers would stay an additional 10 minutes from the start time of the last
appointment of any potentially eligible participant (to allow for the consultation with the GP/nurse to
finish), 30 minutes to explain the study to any potentially eligible participant that approached them
(if applicable), 10 minutes for discussion with practice staff (no additional payment, beyond the £175
practice payment, was made to the practice for this time) and a further 15 minutes to clear up (reinstate
the room and clear paper work). The total attendance time (per session) was thereby equal to the time
between the appointment times of the first and last potentially eligible participant plus 80 minutes
(15 minutes’ preparation, 10 minutes’ appointment time, 30 minutes for discussion, 10 minutes’ discussion
with receptionist and 15 minutes to clear up) if the last potentially eligible participant approached them
(this applied to 38 of the 45 sessions) and 50 minutes (15 minutes’ preparation, 10 minutes’ appointment
time, 10 minutes’ discussion with receptionist and 15 minutes to clear up) if the last potentially eligible
participant did not approach them (this applied to 7 of the 45 sessions). The average time between the
appointment times of the first and last potentially eligible participant was 82.44 minutes. Over the
45 sessions, the total time the researcher was in the surgery amounted to 7100 minutes (118 hours).
At a cost of £20.47 per hour this gave a cost of £2422.26 for the time in the surgery (see Table 32).
Within these 45 sessions, a total of 98 potentially eligible participants approached the researcher, 52 of
whom took a recruitment pack containing PIL (£0.12), consent form and request and collect form (£0.05),
questionnaire 1 (£0.16) and a pre-paid return envelope (£0.04). Of these, 32 responded, 21 of whom
completed both questionnaire 1 and the consent form. Table 32 shows the costs associated with each
component part of the active recruitment; the cost per consent obtained amounted to £190.63.
Passive and active recruitment post consent
Those who consented and were deemed not intentionally non-adherent or otherwise ineligible were visited
in their own home by the researcher (visit 1). The purpose of this visit was to provide the participant with
1 month’s supply of medication and to remove old medication stocks so that they could be visited 3 weeks
later (at visit 2) to assess adherence. Thus, prior to the visit it was necessary for (1) the researcher to call
the pharmacist, in order to arrange to collect medicines for the participant to be visited (10-minute
telephone call), (2) the pharmacist to prepare the medication and (3) the researcher to collect it. The
pre-visit pharmacy time for these three activities was assumed to average 45 minutes [at a cost per hour of
employment of £51.30 (£50.0083 inflated by 2.6%)]; thus, the pharmacist cost would be £38.48 per
participant. Assuming that the aforementioned travel costs to the GP practice also applied to the pharmacy
(20-mile round trip, with an average speed of 29.9 mph), the total researcher time per pharmacy visit
would be 40.31 minutes, which gave a total researcher time of 50.13 minutes when the 10-minute
telephone call was included. Based on the aforementioned £20.47 per hour of employment, the pre-visit
1 researcher cost was £17.10. Thirty-nine participants from the three passive recruitment practices received

 visit 1, hence the total pre-visit cost for these participants was £2167.58. Eight participants from the active
recruitment practices received visit 1, hence a total pre-visit 1 cost of £444.63 (see Table 32).
At visit 1 participants had their current stock of medication removed and were given 1 month’s supply of
new medication. This visit was assumed to last 1 hour (excluding research-related time) and have the same
travel time and cost as that for the aforementioned GP visits (although participants often lived further
away, it was possible to combine some of these visits). Total researcher time per visit was thereby 1 hour
40.13 minutes at a cost of £34.16, with travel costs of £9.00, giving a total visit 1 cost of £43.16. Total
visit 1 costs for the eight active recruitment participants and the 39 passive recruitment participants are
shown in Table 32.
Visit 2 took place 3 weeks after visit 1 and was primarily undertaken to monitor adherence by pill count.
If participants had taken either more or less than 100% of their medication they were deemed
unintentionally non-adherent. After excluding the time associated with research activities (e.g. MMSE,
vision test, dexterity test, pill count, randomisation), the time for assessment and to ensure that the
participant could use their allocated medication packaging amounted to 30 minutes. Using the same travel
costs as visit 1, the total cost per visit 2 amounted to £32.97, which was applied to eight active
recruitment participants and the 37 passive recruitment participants.
When the costs associated with each of the aforementioned activities (both pre and post consent) are
summed together, the total cost was estimated to be £7600.56 and £5056.64, for passive and active
recruitment, respectively (see Table 32). At the end of visit 2 a total of 15 participants were randomised
from the three passive practices, compared with two from the active practices, giving a cost per-participant
randomisation rate of £506.70 and £2528.32, respectively.
Summary
Within this chapter we have compared the cost-effectiveness of two different recruitment strategies
[passive (postal) recruitment and active (face-to-face) recruitment by a researcher]. Both of these strategies
were undertaken in three different practices. A total of 113 participants consented as a result of the
passive recruitment, 15 of whom went on to be randomised. The numbers actively recruited was 21 and 2,
respectively. The costs associated with the passive strategy (up to the point of consent) included a search
of the practice list, posting of recruitment packs and return postage and amounted to £22.40 per consent
obtained, compared with £190.63 per consent obtained in the active recruitment strategy (which also
included the cost of the researcher time in the practice surgery and associated travel costs). After consent,
participants were visited to issue medication and later to check adherence; 21 were subsequently
randomised from the passive strategy group compared with two from the active group. The cost
per randomised participant was £506.70 in the passive group compared with £2528.32 in the active
group. Thus, it was concluded that passive recruitment was the more efficient strategy.

  Chapter 7 Economic evaluation
Background
For a successful definitive study of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, it is important to incorporate
appropriate measurement methods. This component of the study aimed to evaluate the methodology for,
and assess the feasibility of, conducting a definitive economic evaluation of the effectiveness of MODs in
this population and to undertake an early-stage cost-effectiveness analysis of the MOD.
Objectives
Key objectives were to:
l
identify the resources and outcomes likely to differ as a result of MOD use
l
test data collection instruments
l
provide an early-stage valuation of the resources and outcomes observed
l
comment on the feasibility of collecting resource use and quality-of-life data in a subsequent
more definitive study.
Methods
Measuring costs
Intervention
The intervention comprised the provision of the participants’ medication in a MOD delivered or collected
by the patient on either a weekly or monthly basis. Thus, the resource use associated with the MOD itself,
packing it (dispensing time) and the associated delivery cost (if the participant chose not to collect their
medication from the pharmacy) was identified. Each MOD contains 1 week’s supply of medication, so,
for those in the MOD monthly arm, four MODs were prepared at a time, and two delivery trips were
undertaken (if applicable) in the 2-month follow-up period. Conversely, for those in the MOD-weekly arm,
the pharmacy prepared either one MOD box (1 week’s supply every week) or four MOD boxes at a time
(4 weeks’ supply, dispatching one each week and storing the remainder), so eight delivery trips were
undertaken (if applicable). In the light of this, pharmacists were asked to record dispensing times (time
taken to put the medication into the MOD and time taken for the pharmacist to check the MOD) at least
once per month, for each participant in the study. When one MOD was filled at a time (1 week’s supply
each week) and the associated times were recorded twice for a participant, the mean of these two values
was assumed to apply to the remaining six times a MOD was filled for the same participant but no
associated time was recorded. Pharmacists were also asked to record dispensing times for those in the
monthly and usual supply weekly arms in the same manner, for which, again, the number of delivery trips
would be eight and two, respectively (if applicable). Finally, medication details, for participants in all arms,
were also ascertained from the pharmacist.
Other costs
The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that costs should be calculated from
the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services.84 Accordingly, primary care medical records for
each participant in the study were accessed in order to ascertain the details of health-professional visits
(both primary/community care and other outpatient appointments), accident and emergency visits,
day-case attendances and hospital admissions. Information on these variables were obtained for 2 months
pre RCT and for the period of the RCT.

 Additionally, at the 2-month follow-up point the participants’ carer or close relative (if applicable) was
provided with a self-report questionnaire (see Appendix 15). Section 2 was designed to evaluate
health-economic aspects of their caring role. Briefly, they were asked whether or not they helped the
participant with organising or taking their medication. If they reported ‘yes’ to this, they were subsequently
asked (1) how many times per week they helped them with organising or taking their medication,
(2) the average length of time they spent on each occasion and (3) whether or not they received any
payment for helping them. Carers were also asked if they provided any other type of help. If they
responded ‘yes’, the same three follow-up questions (how many times, average length of time and
whether or not they received payment) were also asked.
Assigning costs to items of resource use
Costs were estimated at 2011/12 financial year levels, as such values were reported in the latest edition
of Curtis85 available at the time of analysis.
Intervention
Curtis85 reported the community pharmacist cost per hour of employment to be £50, which was based on
an average salary of £38,000. Pharmacy technicians had an estimated salary of £23,000 and, assuming
other non-salary costs are proportional to salary costs, as for a pharmacist (as reported by Curtis85), their
cost per hour of employment was estimated to be £30.21. Dispensing times were thereby costed at either
£50.00 or £30.21 per hour for a pharmacist or pharmacy technician, respectively. The cost of the MOD
itself and delivery costs were recorded within the study (although the intervention took place post 2011/12,
it was assumed that the difference between the costs incurred in the study period and 2011/12 prices was
negligible). Medication costs were taken from the prescription cost analysis for England,86 which were based
on Edition 62 of the British National Formulary. However, it should be noted that costs were only applied to
prescribed SODF medication that was prescribed as a regular dose, as it was only these types of medication
that could be used in the MOD box. All medication costs were estimated on an individual participant basis,
based on individual patient-level data.
Other costs
The costs associated with health-care professional visits, accident and emergency visits and day-case attendances
were taken from Curtis.85 To cost hospital attendances, the length of stay was extracted from primary care
records, and this was assigned a cost per bed-day from the National Schedule of Reference Costs.87
With regard to carer time (either helping participants with organising or taking their medication or
receiving any other type of help) the rate of average hourly earnings (in 2011)88 was applied to this time,
assuming that the times applied to the whole of the 8-week period, consistent with the human capital
approach.89 However, since the costing of such care is sometimes considered controversial,90 these costs
are reported separately to the aforementioned NHS costs.
Overall and incremental costs
Overall, mean costs for each of the aforementioned main cost categories [intervention costs (medication
costs were reported separately) and other costs] were estimated over the 2-month intervention period.
These are reported for each of the four trial groups, as well as overall (undertaken because of the small
numbers), in order to provide an indication of the main cost drivers for the population group and, in
particular, the proportion of overall costs that the intervention costs constitute.
Measuring outcomes
To estimate the impact on health-related quality of life, participants were asked to complete the EQ-5D89
at baseline and 2 months post randomisation. The EQ-5D has five questions, which ask the respondent
to report the level of problems they have (no problems, some/moderate problems or severe/extreme
problems) with regard to mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and anxiety/depression.89 The three-level
version of the EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L) was used. Responses to the five dimensions are converted into one of
243 different EQ-5D health state descriptions, which range between no problems in all five dimensions
(11111) and severe/extreme problems in all five dimensions (33333). A utility score (a scale where death is

 equal to 0 and full health 1) was assigned to each of these 243 health states using the York A1 tariff91
(producing EQ-5D scores ranging from –0.594 to 1.00). The EQ-5D is accompanied by a visual analogue
scale (European Quality of Life-Visual Analogue Scale, EQ-VAS), on which people are asked to indicate
how good or bad their health state is (on the day they complete the questionnaire), where zero
corresponds to worst imaginable health state and 100 to best imaginable health state.89
In addition to the EQ-5D, participants were also asked to complete the ICECAP-O92 at baseline and at the
2-month follow-up. The ICECAP-O is designed to capture both quality of life and capability, for which
the focus is on an individual’s own perception of their capabilities on the five attributes of attachment,
security, role, enjoyment and control.92 Each of the attributes has four levels: the most preferred state,
all of . . . (e.g. the love and friendship) I want (4), a lot of . . . (3), a little of . . . (2) and none of . . . (1).92
The best–worst scaling technique was used to assign a value to each of the capability descriptions that
are ascertained from the ICECAP-O, where these range from 0 (no capability: 11111) to 1 (full
capability: 44444).
Cost-effectiveness analysis
The ability to perform an analysis of cost-effectiveness is limited by the small numbers in this study. Thus,
we do not seek to estimate the incremental cost and incremental effect associated with the different
intervention groups, as we consider that it would be difficult to perform regression-type analyses in such
circumstances. The estimated overall unadjusted mean costs and effects are, however, briefly discussed,
although such estimates must be treated with caution.
Value of information analysis
When making decisions about the allocation of scarce resources two questions have been argued to be
fundamental.93,94 First, which option is estimated to be cost-effective on the basis of current evidence?
Second, should further research be undertaken to reduce the level of uncertainty associated with
that decision?
To answer the first question, the option with the highest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) below
the cost-effectiveness threshold is identified,93 for which dominated options (those that are more costly
and less effective than another option) and those that are subject to extended dominance (combinations
of other options can provide a higher level of benefit for the same cost) are excluded.95
In relation to the second question, it has been argued96 that it is useful to plot the cost-effectiveness
acceptability curve (CEAC)97 and the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier (CEAF).97 The CEAC depicts the
probability that an option is cost-effective at different levels of the cost-effectiveness threshold.96,97 The
CEAF is equivalent to plotting the CEAC over the range of thresholds for which each option is estimated to
be most cost-effective.96,97 To answer the second question, the expected value of perfection information
(EVPI) can be calculated.94 The EVPI provides an upper estimate of the value of undertaking further
research and is equivalent to the probability of making the wrong decision (shown by the CEAF) multiplied
by the consequences of that wrong decision.94,98
Here, we calculated the EVPI (for an individual patient) using the non-parametric approach outlined by
Briggs et al.94 Bootstrapping was used to produce 5000 iterations of the mean cost and effect, which are
equivalent to the mean value of samples of n values drawn from the observed data, with replacement.
Here the n is the number of participants in each of the four groups for whom complete cost and
quality-adjusted life year (QALY) data were available. The cost variable used was the aforementioned total
cost over the 2-month follow-up period from the perspective of the NHS. We used the EQ-5D data to
estimate QALYs based on the area under the curve method (with adjustment for baseline differences),99
so the baseline and 2-month follow-up EQ-5D scores were used to estimate the per-patient QALY gain
(or loss) which accrued over the 2-month trial period. The CEAF was also estimated, where this was
equivalent to the proportion of iterations for which the optimal intervention had the highest level of net
benefit at different levels of the cost-effectiveness threshold.

 Results
Participants
Participant allocations and characteristics are summarised in the CONSORT diagram (see Figure 7) and
baseline characteristics table (see Table 18). It should be noted that 3 of the 29 randomised participants
withdrew consent prior to receiving the intervention (two from the MOD weekly arm and one from the
usual supply monthly arm). After the point of withdrawal for these three participants, no further data
could be collected. Thus, dispensing time data were not available for these three participants and their
primary record data had also not been accessed at this point; consequently, data from these three
participants are not used in the subsequent costs analyses. Additionally, one participant from the MOD
weekly arm died; data from this participant are used up to the point of death. Resource use data were
also available for the participant who had poor eyesight (usual supply monthly arm). Cost data were
thereby available for up to seven participants in the MOD weekly arm, six in the MOD weekly arm, six in
the usual supply monthly arm and seven in the usual supply weekly arm. With regard to outcomes, it was
possible to use the baseline data for the 29 randomised participants (the three who withdrew completed
the measures prior to withdrawing consent). Follow-up data were, however, only available for up to
26 participants. These numbers differ from those in the CONSORT, as the CONSORT is based on the
primary outcome (pill count), for which levels of missing data differed from resource use and quality-of-life
data (all available data were used in the economic analysis).
Intervention costs
In this study each MOD covered a 1-week period and had a cost of 40p (this cost was assigned to all types
of MODs used). Two participants were admitted to hospital (where they did not use a MOD as they were
not self-medicating); the remainder of those in both the MOD monthly and MOD weekly arms were
provided with eight MODs in the study period. Thus, the mean number of MODs used in each of these
arms was eight (the one participant admitted to hospital in this study arm was in the last week of the
2-month study period, so the cost of eight MODs was still included for that participant) and 7.36 (one of
the six participants in this arm was admitted to hospital in their fifth week in the study), respectively, giving
mean associated MOD costs of £3.20 and £3.00, respectively.
Table 33 summarises the direct costs associated with the four study arms. Medication delivery costs were
£5 per trip, and the mean cost associated with these is also shown in Table 33. Dispensing times were
recorded for 25 of the 26 participants. The mean time taken to dispense 1 month’s supply of medication
(including filling the MOD, if applicable) varied between 19.50 minutes for usual supply monthly (n = 5)
and 43.00 minutes for MOD weekly. Once the appropriate figures for pharmacist/pharmacist technician
cost per hour of employment (Table 34) were assigned to these costs, it can be seen that (for both usual
supply and MOD) mean dispensing costs were higher for those in the weekly arm than for those in the
monthly arm and that mean costs in both MOD arms were higher than in the usual supply arm.
Pre-intervention, the mean number of medications per participant varied between 5.50 (MOD weekly)
and 7.86 (MOD weekly), where the associated cost also varied between £31.45 and £70.48, respectively
(see Table 33). Within the 2-month intervention period, four of the 26 participants had a change in
their medication recorded by the pharmacist, where this was the addition of one medication for two
participants, the addition of two medications for one participant and the removal of one medication for
one participant. Costs/levels of resource use were only estimated for prescribed SODF medication that was
prescribed as a regular dose.

 Other costs
Medical records were accessed for each of the 26 participants. The mean number of primary/community
care visits, outpatient visits, A&E visits, day-case attendances and hospital admissions, within each of the
four groups are summarised in Table 35. Unit costs (see Table 35) were subsequently assigned to each
of these items of resource use, in order to estimate the mean costs for each of these categories (see
Table 35). It can be seen that many of the values are low, and this can be explained by the fact that the
most common value for each item was zero. Moreover, it can be seen that one or two individuals have
quite an effect on the overall mean, for example there was just one participant who was admitted to
hospital in the MOD weekly arm (their length of stay was 32 days).
Nine carer questionnaires were returned at the 2-month follow-up point, although in one of these
questionnaires the person reported that they were the daughter of the participant and not a carer (they
met with the participant on a weekly basis); consequently, this participant was assumed to receive no help
from a carer. All of the remaining eight carers reported that they were family members, seven of whom
lived with the participant. Six of the carers answered the question regarding whether or not they helped
the participant with organising or taking their medication, three of whom gave the answer of ‘yes’ (one
of these three reported that they received payment for this help). Two of those three were in the MOD
weekly arm; of these two, the reported time providing help was once per week for 5 minutes and
seven times for 3 minutes on each occasion. Assuming these times applied to the whole of the 8-week
period, this would amount to 0.67 hours and 2.80 hours, respectively, and lost productivity costs of £9.84
and £41.33, respectively, when assigned the rate of average hourly earnings in 2011 (£14.76). The other
carer who reported that they helped with organising or taking medication was in the MOD weekly arm
and reported providing help three times per week (for 2 minutes on each occasion); this equated to a lost
productivity cost of £11.81.

 In order to calculate average levels of lost productivity, it was necessary to make assumptions with regard
to those for whom the carer questionnaire was not returned, specifically whether or not this was because
they did not have a carer (and consequently received no such help), and whether or not carer data should
be treated as missing. Participants were asked to return the carer questionnaire at the same time as the
EQ-5D questionnaire. Thus, we assumed that those who returned the EQ-5D questionnaire, but not
the carer questionnaire, did not have a carer.
This applied to 13 participants. For the remaining participants who did not return the EQ-5D questionnaire,
or who returned the carer questionnaire but did not complete the question with regard to help regarding
medication (n = 2), we assumed the data were missing with regard to whether or not they had a carer
and received any associated help. The estimated mean lost productivity costs associated with organising
or taking medication across each of the four groups are shown in Table 36, in which the three
aforementioned lost productivity values are combined with values of £0.00 for the three participants
who reported that they did not provide such help, the one person who returned the carer questionnaire
but reported that she was not a carer and the 13 who returned the EQ-5D questionnaire but not the
carer questionnaire.
Seven of the eight responding carers answered the question regarding other types of help, six of whom
reported that they provided such help (two of the six reported that they received a payment for such help).
One of those six failed to complete the questions regarding the frequency/length of help, and another
(from the usual supply weekly arm) reported that they felt unable to answer this question as they provided
help ‘all day’ (providing help 14 hours a day for 7 days a week would equate to a lost productivity cost of
£11,571.84 over 2 months). The times reported by the remaining four ranged between 2.5 minutes twice
a week (to remind the participant about appointments) and 1 hour 7 days a week (for personal care).
The inferred lost productivity costs for these four are combined with the 15 who were assumed to have
received no such help (the one carer who reported that they provided no help, the one who returned the
questionnaire but reported she was not a carer and the 13 who returned the EQ-5D questionnaire but not
the carer questionnaire) in Table 36 (for the purposes of this analysis the responses for the one carer who
reported that they provided help ‘all day’, the carer who reported they provided help but did not report
the frequency/length and the one carer who returned the questionnaire but did not answer this specific
question were treated as missing data).
Overall costs
Missing data
The following assumptions were made in order to enable all 26 participants to be assigned a cost for each
component cost. The one participant (from the usual supply monthly arm) for whom the method of
delivery/dispensing times were not recorded had been found to have difficulties with regard to eyesight
and been withdrawn from usual supply by his GP [he was instead provided with a MOD (by the NHS
outwith this study)]. In line with the intention-to-treat principle, we included this participant in the analysis,
in the arm to which they were originally allocated. The costs associated with the method of delivery/
dispensing times for this participant were assumed to equate to the mean for the seven participants in the
MOD weekly arm. Similarly, in line with all participants in the MOD weekly arm, he was assumed to have
used eight MOD boxes within the study period.
When the costs associated with the intervention [MOD boxes (if applicable), dispensing and delivery (if
applicable), but excluding medication] are summed together, it can be seen that these are relatively small
compared with other NHS costs. Over the 26 participants, on average, they can be seen to be approximately
10% of the overall cost. In terms of the MOD intervention itself, it can be seen that the mean intervention
cost for those in the MOD monthly arm is just over £20 more than that in the monthly usual-care arm, with a
similar, although slightly smaller, mean difference in the intervention cost between the MOD weekly arm and
usual supply weekly arm (see Table 35). There is also no evidence to suggest that the higher intervention costs
are off-set by lower other NHS costs; indeed, the mean other NHS costs for both usual supply arms are lower

 than those for both of the MOD arms. It should, however, be noted that these costs are highly influenced by
the two participants who were admitted to hospital (both of whom were in one of the MOD arms).
Outcomes
At baseline, the EQ-5D, EQ-VAS and ICECAP-O were completed by 28 of the 29 participants (see Table 37).
Follow-up scores were completed by 22 of the 29 participants (84.6% response rate). Looking at the change in
scores, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions, but there is little to suggest that the mean scores for those who
received a MOD, whether this be on a weekly or monthly basis, were superior to those who received usual
supply. Indeed, of the four groups, a usual supply arm had the highest mean change according to the EQ-5D
(usual supply weekly), EQ-VAS (usual supply monthly) and ICECAP-O (usual supply weekly).
Cost-effectiveness analysis
Given the small numbers, formal cost-effectiveness analysis is considered inappropriate. There is, however,
little to suggest that levels are greater for the MOD intervention, as for each of the measures, based solely
on the mean unadjusted results, it can be seen that a usual supply arm dominates (has lower mean costs
and higher mean effects) both of the MOD arms (see Table 36 for costs and Table 37 for outcomes).
Value of information analysis
We based our value of information calculations on those participants for whom complete cost and effect
data were available. The resulting estimates of the within-trial mean cost and QALY gain/loss for each of
the four groups are shown in Table 38. The option of usual supply weekly was optimal (had the highest
ICER below the cost-effectiveness threshold) for values of λ ≥ £119 per QALY. Consequently, the
CEAF (shown in Figure 9) was equal to the probability that usual supply weekly was estimated to be
cost-effective for threshold values greater than this value of λ and took the value of the probability for
MOD weekly for λ values < £119. The per-participant EVPI was subsequently calculated and is shown in
Figure 9. The EVPI never exceeded £50 and is equivalent to an estimated value of £2.91 at λ = £20,000
per QALY (see Table 38). The EVPI is equivalent to the probability of making the wrong decision multiplied
by the consequences of that wrong decision, and this low EVPI estimate can be largely explained by the
fact that the probability of making the wrong decision (as depicted by the CEAF in Figure 9) was ≤ 15%
for values of λ > £10,000 per QALY and ≤ 5% for values of λ > £20,000 per QALY.
If one took the EVPI per-participant value of £2.91 at face value, then one would probably conclude that the
potential value of undertaking further research is relatively low. However, there are a number of reasons why
we consider that the EVPI estimates produced here should be treated with caution. First, although complete
data were available for a large proportion of the sample (22 out of 26), with such small numbers in the
sample it can be seen that the mean estimates for those with complete cost and effect data (see Table 38)
are somewhat different from those for participants for whom only cost data were complete (see Table 36).
Contributory factors include the fact that the participant with the highest NHS cost in the monthly MOD group
failed to complete the EQ-5D, as did the participant with the lowest NHS cost in the MOD weekly group. Thus,
the mean cost estimates, based on those with complete data, may underestimate for the monthly MOD group
and overestimate for the MOD weekly group. Furthermore, a key assumption of bootstrapping (which was
used to produce the iterations on which the mean cost and effect data are based) is that the observed data are
representative of the population and that estimates of the mean of the population can therefore be made by
sampling from the observed data. Given the small numbers in this study, and the fact that those who have
missing data may differ from those with complete data, the above assumption is unlikely to hold and the use
of bootstrapping may therefore be inappropriate. A further issue is that the mean cost and QALY estimates
here were based on the within-trial period of just 2 months. As such, they may underestimate the changes in
lifetime costs and effects (we thought it too speculative to produce such estimates based on the data available
to us) and the resulting estimates of the consequences of making the wrong decisions which is used in the EVPI
calculations. In the light of the above, we consider that the value of information results produced here should
be treated with caution. Indeed, similar to other pilot studies that have included an economic component, for
example Clarke et al.,100 we would prefer to concentrate on the completion rates for the different measures
(to assess whether or not it would be feasible to use these measures within any subsequent definitive trial).

 Summary
Within this chapter we have summarised the data on resource use, quality of life (EQ-5D) and capability
(ICECAP-O). Resource use data were available from medical records for all 26 participants for whom it was
requested, compared with 22 (84.6%) for quality-of-life and capability data. The feasibility of collecting
health economic data to assess the cost-effectiveness of MODs in a subsequent definitive study was
thereby demonstrated. A relatively low response rate was, however, obtained regarding carer input, where
it was sometimes unclear whether this was because of non-response or because the participant did not
have a carer (in a future study participants might therefore be asked to report whether or not they have a
carer when recruited and follow-up questionnaires can then be tailored accordingly). The completion rate
for both the EQ-5D and ICECAP-O was identical. The two instruments measure different concepts (see
Brooks89 and Coast et al.92); thus, we recommend that both are used in any subsequent definitive study.
However, in the light of the development of a five-level version of the EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L101) and an
associated valuation mechanism102 (which was not available at the start of this study), we would
recommend that the EQ-5D-5L is used in any subsequent definitive study. Additionally, as MODs could
well be used beyond the 2-month follow-up period in this study, it is also recommended that any future
definitive study considers the addition of a long-term model to extrapolate the costs and benefits beyond
the trial period.

  Chapter 8 Discussion
T
his feasibility study of MODs compared with usual medication packaging has identified refinements in
the study design essential for a successful definitive study and has offered an early indication of the
effects of MODs. The systematic review has supplemented the findings of Mahtani et al.39 Their systematic
review of MOD RCTs yielded a small number of studies which did not report all potential effects of MODs
such as impact on social and psychological well-being.7 It also included studies which had components
additional to the MOD as part of a complex intervention to improve adherence. Their review concluded
that MODs may increase adherence and improve clinical outcomes in selected conditions but that more
research was needed to inform NHS decision-making.
This systematic review was based on a broader search than previous reviews, including a wide range of
databases, inclusive search terms, searching reference lists of retrieved papers and hand-searching. It
included all study designs and focused on interventions which only included a MOD (i.e. no other
component such as patient education or additional separate reminders) with the intent of capturing those
studies excluded by Mahtani et al.39 and relevant to the aim of determining the independent effects of
MODs. This approach identified that MOD studies have a range of objectives, study designs, populations
and outcomes and thus preclude meta-analysis.
The studies identified in the present systematic review were largely of poor quality in terms of
methodological rigour. For the outcomes of adherence, clinical improvement, health-care utilisation,
processing time and costs there were studies suggesting both that MODs were beneficial compared with
standard care and the converse. No study included data on all of these outcomes, so triangulation of
observed effects was not possible. Inadequate study reporting prevented comprehensive risk of bias
assessment, in particular when pre-study protocols were unavailable it was not possible to determine
whether or not studies reported all intended outcomes. Contacting authors to supplement the published
information may have reduced the gaps in the evidence synthesis. Finally, measurement of adherence was
largely dependent on pill counts, and it was unclear whether or not there had been screening of patients
to only include those with unintentional non-adherence.
Uncertainty remains regarding the effect of MODs. Of the eight studies reporting adherence, half
suggested this was improved with the use of a MOD. However, only one of these studies reported a
clinical outcome (a prospective cohort study showing improved viral load), so while it might be assumed
improved adherence leads to better clinical outcomes, there is little direct evidence. Similarly, the three
studies reporting effects on health-care utilisation reported neither clinical outcomes nor adherence.
One study suggested a MOD was associated with a small increase in GP visits; however, another reported
decreased visits to doctors but increased hospitalisations. This study also reported decreased AEs. The
tentative conclusion is therefore that MODs might increase adherence, however, depending on the clinical
condition and therapeutic window this may not be enough to improve outcomes. No study reported any
humanistic outcomes such as quality of life. There is, therefore, a need for studies that capture all potential
MOD effects while maintaining rigorous trial design. With eight relevant studies published during the
previous 12 years, a systematic review update is recommended in 6 years.
The feasibility study was designed from a composite of a priori technique, literature review and refinement
through consultation with patients and health-care professionals. Most of the methods proposed by
researchers were acceptable to patients and health-care professionals. The refinements suggested
emphasise the importance of involving relevant stakeholders in the design stage of a project. For example,
it was established at an early stage that storage of excess patient medication at the participating
pharmacies was unacceptable because of space, legal and ethical issues and thus it was possible for an
alternative strategy to be devised.

 There was less clarity regarding the minimum age for recruiting patients to the study, with the suggested
minimum age ranging from 50 years by health-care professionals to 75 years which is indicated as ‘old
age’ in many national guidelines. Furthermore, pharmacists indicated that from their experience, the
frequency with which MODs are initiated increases from the age of 70 years and that this coincides with
increasing polypharmacy. Maintaining the minimum recruitment age at 75 years as initially proposed
resulted in over one-third of patients being ineligible for study participation because they already used a
MOD. It is clear, therefore, that a subsequent study must recruit from a lower age band in order to fully
capture the population that is initiated on MODs through usual care. The ethical restriction of being
unable to recruit patients already receiving a MOD means that patients who were most likely to
demonstrate benefit may have been excluded. It is therefore likely that the results of this feasibility study
and any definitive trial would provide a conservative estimate of any MOD benefits.
Recruitment was lower than anticipated, with significant attrition in potentially eligible patients occurring
at two stages: patients needing to be prescribed medicines from a limited list for which EAM was intended
and patients not already using a MOD. Prior to a definitive RCT, a universal EAM system must therefore be
developed and validated in order to prevent attrition of potential participants owing to requirements that
certain medicines are prescribed. A lower age band for recruitment is also necessary so that patients
identified as unintentionally non-adherent can be recruited prior to a MOD being initiated as a result of
usual-care processes.
As expected, the active recruitment approach achieved a much higher consent rate than the passive
approach. However, the time taken to recruit these participants and thus increased cost was not off-set
by the increased success rate. The data from this feasibility study unequivocally indicate that the passive
approach is most cost-effective for recruiting this population to a study of MODs.
The consent rate of just under 20% from the passive recruitment process was lower than the anticipated
30%.16,34 The primary motivations for trial participation by older people are altruism, social engagement
and anticipated personal benefits.103–105 These mirror precisely the findings of the pre-study focus groups
and post-study discussions with participants. Participants cited study involvement as an opportunity to
payback the NHS, and with 57% of participants in the MOD RCT group remaining on MODs and 29% of
the usual-care group being initiated into MODs post-study completion, there is a clear element of personal
benefit. Given that discussion could only be held with patients that consented, determining the reasons for
non-consent are challenging. Previous research has cited inconvenience/burden of trial involvement and
risk of harm.103–105 The nature of the intervention is such that potential participants are unlikely to have
perceived it as a high risk of harm. It therefore follows that the trial processes were considered a burden
that outweighed the potential benefits. The study design focus groups did not give rise to any concerns
regarding the proposed burden to participants; however, this attitude may not have translated to the
wider population, as the more motivated patients will consent to focus group participation.
The crossover design proposed during the pre-study focus groups with health-care professionals was
considered appropriate, as it would allow measurement of both within- and between-patient variation plus
equivalent power with fewer than half the number of participants. No significant carryover effect with
MOD intervention was anticipated and therefore a washout period was not necessary. However, given that
such a large proportion of intervention participants remained on a MOD post study completion, ethical
constraints or high dropout rates because patients do not wish to revert to usual care may prevent a
crossover design. The motivation of health-care professionals to participate in the research was to help
identify whether or not the expensive process of providing MODs is cost-effective.
The proportion of patient participants reporting at least one questionnaire item response associated
with intentional non-adherence is comparable to previous reports of the prevalence of intentional
non-adherence106 and thus offers some confidence in the screening approach for this study. The reported
satisfaction by participants allocated MODs further reinforces that MODs were not provided to patients
intentionally not adhering to their prescribed medication.
DISCUSSION

114
 The prevalence of unintentional non-adherence at 46.1% is in accordance with previous studies examining
a similar population using DUC.15 This affords some confidence in the use of DUC for screening purposes.
The counting of tablets at the end of the 30-week period enables the participant’s usual packaging to
remain unchanged, which may have minimised the mere-measures effect of changing behaviour simply
through its measurement.107 Furthermore, as patients demonstrating characteristics associated with
intentional non-adherence were excluded from trial participation, intentional alteration of the number of
remaining dosage units by the participant is less likely.
The participants who were randomised were evenly matched across the randomisation groups and, with
multiple comorbidities plus polypharmacy, they reflected the population that is usually in receipt of a MOD.108
The vision of the majority of participants posed no restriction in terms of reading medication instruction labels
either generated by the pharmacy or on the MODs. Although there was no intention to exclude participants
based on results from functional ability, researchers did exclude a participant with severely impaired vision
which had not been suitably corrected. The study procedures were that researchers would ensure that
participants were able to safely use whichever medication supply procedure they had been allocated. The
participant in question was randomised to the usual-care group but researchers had identified that he was
unable to manage usual care effectively, as, during DUC, incorrect blisters were found inside his pill boxes. It
may be more appropriate for a subsequent study to exclude based on visual ability prior to randomisation in
order to prevent bias. This approach was not initially adopted in order to reduce the burden to participants of
being assessed for multiple medication supply methods of which only one would be implemented. Despite
targeting an older population with an average age exceeding 75 years, no participants had impaired
cognitive function.
Relative to normative values, the majority of the study participants had poorer manual dexterity than
expected for the over-71-years age group. However, studies of this age group have reported large
variations in ability and therefore a larger study may produce average results more comparable with
normative values. Despite the poorer than average dexterity, no patients reported difficulty in physically
manipulating any of the MODs trialled via their satisfaction surveys. However, post-RCT focus groups did
provide a comment from one participant indicating that she had experienced some difficulty. This supports
recent evidence provided by Adams et al.69 which demonstrated that the ease with which patients are able
to use different MODs varies. Adams et al.69 investigated patient ability to use MODs using a scale on
which participants rated MODs according to various criteria which may have provided greater sensitivity
for identifying variations in ease of using the MOD than the methods adopted in the present study. A
definitive study may therefore be enhanced by use of the Adams et al. tool.
Given that all participants had been screened and identified within a 3-week DUC period to be non-
adherent, there was an unexpectedly high level of adherence post randomisation. This is counterintuitive
given that the monitoring occurred over a longer time period and, thus ,the expectation is that there will
be a decline in adherence as patients return to their usual medication-taking behaviour, which is likely to
be more frequent dose omissions. This increased adherence may be attributable to more pronounced
Hawthorne effects post randomisation compared with the screening stage.107 This hypothesis is upheld by
post-trial discussions with study participants identifying that they altered their behaviour during trial
participation in order to achieve greater adherence than their usual behaviour. An extended monitoring
duration of 1 year with a 2-month bedding in period is recommended for a definitive study to overcome
the Hawthorne effect.
Although a number of EAM systems were identified during the developmental stage of this feasibility
study, no working EAM system suitable for multiple size and shaped medication packaging was available
within the study period. Further work is therefore essential in order to ensure that the outcome measure
of adherence is assessed using an objective methodological approach which induces minimal Hawthorne
effects. A study to develop and test an EAM system that is effective and acceptable for use in adherence
studies is, therefore, required.

 The study appeared to be acceptable to recruited patients, as attrition in those agreeing to take part in the
RCT was entirely a result of hospital admission. The post-study discussions did, however, identify that some
experienced difficulties with the process of medications being delivered. The strategy for all medication
supplies to be delivered for those allocated to weekly supplies was adopted to prevent the burden from
increased supply frequency negatively impacting on patient participants. However, some participants were
anxious about running out of medication before receiving the next delivery and were inconvenienced by
waiting at home for medication to be delivered. It would, therefore, be more appropriate in a subsequent
study to offer participants the option of delivery or collection and establish this information prior to
randomisation so that allocation could be stratified accordingly.
The health-care professional post-study discussion identified no problems with the study design with the
exception of one participating pharmacy that felt that communication from trial team members to both
patients and health-care professionals could be improved. Despite a well-attended training session, a
summary flow chart of procedures, each pharmacy being visited by the trial manager and an invitation to
contact a member of the trial team if any problems or questions arose, there were some deviations from
the SOPs by one participating pharmacy. The two deviations of note were that the pharmacy dispensed
several months of prescriptions at once as it believed this was a study requirement. The result was a high
burden to the dispenser and minimal storage space. This may be overcome by including this stage into the
data collection form so that the people dispensing are alerted to the trial requirements and complete
contemporaneous records indicating that they have adhered to the SOP. The second deviation was that
the medication packaging returned by trial participants to the pharmacy were discarded; entering this
information was already a requirement of the data collection form. Even with EAM systems it is likely that
the return of medication packaging which will carry the data logger will be necessary. As both of the
above SOP deviations were made by one of the eight pharmacies to which patients were randomised and
not endorsed by the other pharmacies, the implications for a future study are perhaps less relevant. The
same pharmacy also reported that the end-of-trial procedures had been poorly communicated to patients
and pharmacies. The consequences of patients wishing to continue to receive their medicines in a MOD
had been carefully considered by the trial team at the design phase. The strategy implemented for
management of such cases was that pharmacies refer patients to a locally funded service where, after
assessment of need, MODs are provided to eligible patients at no personal cost. The opinions expressed by
this pharmacy were not reflected in the patient focus group and thus no major changes are proposed for a
definitive study.
The high response rates to the economic measures requiring patient participant completion suggest that
these were acceptable and the post-study discussions with participants do not offer any contradictory
information. The magnitude of success with the carer-completed questionnaire is, however, less clear, as
baseline data regarding the presence of a carer and the nature of their involvement in supporting the
participant in medication taking were not collected. The result is that the extent to which the completed
carer questionnaires represent the participants who had carers cannot be determined. A definitive study
must therefore collect these baseline data, which will also enable follow-up questionnaires to be sent to
any non-responding carers to optimise response rate. Collection of economic outcomes was well executed
by pharmacies and the post-study discussions suggest that the process was acceptable.
Economic data collection from GP-held records by the research team was resource intensive but
successfully executed. Processes are available to expedite extraction of the necessary information from GP
software and it may therefore be more cost-effective in a definitive study to allow sufficient time for the
research team to be appropriately trained in the use of the software to enable rapid data extraction for a
much larger number of participants. Collection of social service data was novel to this feasibility study of
MODs, as demonstrated by the systematic review. A considerable amount of time was taken working with
social services to develop the process for data collection with a successful outcome.
As a feasibility study, this study was not powered to detect differences in the primary outcome; therefore,
no significant differences were identified between supply frequency of monthly versus weekly and MODs

 versus usual-care packaging. The findings have provided estimates of adherence magnitude and the
variance around this outcome for each study arm. This is consistent with expected feasibility study
outcome. A definitive study should therefore consider supply frequency in addition to MOD and usual-care
packaging. The early-stage cost-effectiveness analysis of the MOD was similarly heavily compromised by
the small sample size and large variation in costs between participants, thus even a tentative estimation of
cost-effectiveness is inappropriate. However, this study has established the feasibility of determination of
the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MODs.
This was not a clinical trial of an investigational medicinal product; only the SODFs usually prescribed to
patients were provided in MODs. The study was not therefore designed to capture AEs. However, 38% of
participants randomised to MODs experienced AEs compared with none in the usual packaging group.
While a definitive causal link between the MOD and the AE cannot be made, the relationship is probable.
All of the participants experiencing an AE were prescribed at least one medicine which may contribute to a
fall. All study participants had been confirmed as being previously unintentionally non-adherent and the
use of the MODs may, therefore, have resulted in an increased dose of the prescribed medicine and
thereby increased risk of iatrogenic events.109
The findings of this study are in agreement with others designed to promote adherence which have
reported increased mortality and health-care costs for participants receiving the intervention.110,111 It is
intuitive that increasing adherence to a medication without reflecting on the implications of an increased
dosage may result in an AE. Furthermore, as the majority of AEs were associated with falls, a definitive
study should capture and stratify participant allocation according to risk factors for falls and the frequency
of falls 1 year prior to randomisation. As MODs are already used in practice, a trial to test their safety is
urgently required.
Other outcomes explored were risk of dispensing error and effect on patient-perceived autonomy.
Information regarding dispensing errors made by pharmacies is extremely sensitive, as under current UK
legislation a dispensing error is a criminal offence. No attempt was therefore made to collect dispensing
error information from pharmacies. The process of decriminalising dispensing errors is being undertaken in
the UK and therefore this obstacle will soon be removed. Many pharmacies routinely collect data regarding
dispensing errors that are identified before they reach the patient and are often termed a ‘near miss’. It
was therefore planned that this near-miss data would be collected from pharmacies and compared
between the different randomisation groups in order to estimate whether or not dispensing into MODs
poses an increased risk of dispensing error. Liaison with representatives from the participating pharmacies
at a very early stage identified that near-miss data are also considered commercially very sensitive
information. The reported frequency of near misses is considerably lower than previous reports which may
indicate reporting bias.112 To avoid compromising the validity of error data, appropriate measures must be
implemented to ensure and assure pharmacy participants of confidentiality.
The MOD weekly arm reported slightly greater confidence in ability to self-manage their medication;
however, as indicated previously, the small sample size prohibits any firm conclusions from being drawn.
There were no other observable differences between the study arms. The pre-study focus groups and
post-study discussion with participants did, however, raise the issue of many medicines dispensed in
MODs being indistinguishable to patients, and thus patients have to trust that the medication has been
correctly dispensed. This anxiety generated from not being able to check that the correct medication has
been dispensed was not reflected in participant responses to the self-report question that related to
anxiety about taking medication correctly. Refinement of the wording of this questionnaire is therefore
necessary in order to elicit a valid response.
The participant completion rate for economic measures of outcome was in agreement with that of other
pilot studies.100 This was also the case for the intervention and other NHS costs; however, there were
considerable research costs associated with the collection of data from primary care. The low response to
the carer questionnaire needs to be addressed in a definitive study. It was unclear whether this was

117
 because the participant had no carer or because the carer elected not to respond. Any future study, when
completing baseline measures, should ask the participant whether or not they have a carer and the carer
elements should be combined with the participant questionnaire.
Owing to the low patient numbers, interpretations should be treated with caution. The relatively low
incremental cost of approximately £20 associated with the MOD intervention weekly and monthly relative
to usual care weekly and monthly, respectively, is small in relation to other NHS costs. It constitutes, on
average, approximately 10% of the total NHS costs; however, looking at both the mean total NHS costs
and the economic outcomes (both unadjusted for differences between groups) there was little evidence to
suggest the MOD intervention was cost-effective.
The main limitations of this study were the small sample size and exclusion of patients already using a
MOD and not prescribed at least two medicines from a pre-defined list. The results of this feasibility study
may not therefore be replicated in a more generalisable sample. One strength in terms of economic data
collection was that dispensing times were recorded for 25 of the 26 participants, which would suggest
that it would be feasible for pharmacists to collect such data in any future study (even if it is just for a
sample of the MOD/usual supply dispensing that is undertaken). However, within this study pharmacies
were provided with a set-up fee of £175 and a further £75 for each randomised participant – without
such fees it is unclear whether or not such high completion rates would have been achieved. Such fees,
which did not differ across arms, were not incorporated into the analyses, as it was considered that
pharmacists would not receive such a payment if the MOD intervention were rolled out across the NHS.
Summary of implications for practice
l
Medication organisation devices and other medication management strategies are being used by many
older people without this information being recorded in their medical notes. It may be appropriate for
GPs to discuss and record a patient’s medication management strategies during routine medication
reviews in order to maintain a complete picture.
l
The prevalence of patients potentially choosing not to adhere to their prescribed medication is a
reminder to practitioners to regularly discuss with patients their thoughts and attitudes towards
their prescribed medication and adopt a concordant approach to prescribing.
l
It is intuitive that increasing adherence to a medication may result in a dose-related AE. It may
therefore be appropriate to review the prescribed dose of all medication prior to introduction of an
adherence enhancing intervention such as a MOD. Particular attention should be applied to medication
associated with dose-related AEs such as antihypertensive and oral hypoglycaemic agents. Patients
should also be closely monitored after introduction of the intervention to ensure that treatment
is optimised.
Summary of recommendations for further research
l
The risk of AEs associated with MOD initiation must be examined and prioritised over estimating its
effect on other outcomes. If a relationship is identified, strategies to mitigate this effect, such as dose
reduction prior to initiation with subsequent up-titration, should be explored.
l
An EAM system compatible with MODs and usual-care packaging is required to enable comparison
of medication adherence to MODs compared with usual care.
l
A definitive study using EAM systems is required to determine the effect of MODs on adherence
compared with usual care to inform policy on whether or not to provide MODs and if so, to whom:
¢
Targeting the older population at risk of unintentional medication non-adherence requires a lower
age band of 60 years for recruitment to capture patients before a MOD is initiated through routine
clinical care.

1. Background 
Approximately 50% of patients do not take their prescribed medication correctly.[1]  The reasons for 
such patient behaviour have been widely researched and it is believed that it arises from both 
unintentional and intentional actions. Unintentional non-adherence has been associated with impaired 
cognitive function and practical problems such as difficulty removing medication from its packaging or 
swallowing the dosage form.  Multi compartment Medication Devices (MMDs) are intended to target 
unintentional non-adherence [2-4] associated with cognitive problems and perhaps to an extent 
accessibility via providing medication in a packaging accessible to the patient. It has been estimated that 
100 000 people are currently using MMDs in the UK [4].  Assuming that the average number of 
medicines per patient using an MMD is four, it is estimated that £23 million is being spent annually 
(includes costs of device plus extra dispensing/professional  fees).  Some of this cost is borne by the 
NHS for patients eligible under the disability discrimination act whilst the remainder is paid by patients 
and their relatives. However, there is no rigorous evidence of the benefit from MMDs[5, 6].   
 
Assuming that MMDs reduce unintentional non-adherence, they may have an important role in the 
optimisation of therapy.  Furthermore, one of the factors which contribute to patients transferring from 
their own homes into care homes is the inability to safely manage their own medicines.  Consequently, 
MMDs may play an additional role in maintaining patients in their own home and prolonging their 
autonomy which is in accordance with Government targets to promote independence [7]. 
 
Considerable research has been conducted in order to establish the predictors of non-adherence and 
whilst there is still much uncertainty, a positive association between magnitude of non-adherence and 
regimen complexity has been frequently reported [8-12].  It is therefore patients prescribed multiple 
medications that are at the greatest risk of non-adherence and to whom MMDs are most frequently 
provided [13].  Research suggests that older patients are prescribed an average of three regular 
medications,  thus a large proportion of the older population has at least one risk factor for non-
adherence and hence MMDs are most frequently supplied to this population [14]. 
 
There are many methodological issues associated with the rigorous testing of MMDs hence the absence 
of adequate large scale studies.  These methodological challenges include, identification of the most 
appropriate participants, replication and thus testing of standard care versus the MMD intervention, 
defining and accurately measuring outcomes/effects, and recruiting an adequate number of participants.   
 
Participant identification 
Intentional non-adherence is associated with numerous factors such as beliefs about medicines [15] and 
the quality of the patient–prescriber relationship [16-18].  The proportion of non-adherence that is 
attributable to intentional factors varies, usually ranging from 4 % to 17 % [17], [19-21] but with 
reports as high as 37% in older people [22].  It is therefore essential that any MMD trial only targets 
patients who are unintentionally non-adherent.

The Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) is an 11 item tool designed to establish whether a 
patient has a negative attitude towards their prescribed therapy.  Trials have demonstrated it to be a 
strong predictor of intentional non-adherence and it is therefore appropriate for identifying and 
excluding intentionally non-adherent patients [16].  Similarly the Medication Adherence Report Scale 
(MARS) is a 5 item questionnaire also designed to identify intentional and unintentional non-adherence 
[23].  The MARS has demonstrated good internal and test-retest reliability when used to report 
adherence to medication for the treatment of chronic conditions.  A comparative study of Dosage Unit 
Count (DUC) with the MARS has also reported good correlation between the two measures [17].  As a 
shorter questionnaire, if effective, the MARS may prove to be a more appropriate tool than the longer 
BMQ.  Consequently both the BMQ and MARS may be suitable tools for screening out those patients for 
whom an MMD may not be appropriate. 
 
Weekly versus monthly supply 
A number of factors have been cited as the rationale for MMDs supporting adherence, including, 
providing medicine storage which is easily accessible to the patient, reducing the complexity of adhering 
to a regimen, minimising dose amount and timing errors and acting as a memory aid [5].  A further 
benefit may be the increased frequency of dispensing which results in greater contact with the 
pharmacy team or a carer, by virtue of the medication being supplied on a weekly rather than the more 
usual monthly basis.  Research has demonstrated that reducing monitoring frequency from weekly to 
fortnightly reduces adherence to therapy and therefore it may follow that reducing medication supply 
frequency may have a similar effect [24].  Studies evaluating patient medication administration errors 
have cited access to extra medication as a source of errors and therefore reducing the amount of 
medication to which a patient has access may also be a further source of error reduction [25].  The 
MMD is therefore a two component intervention; weekly supply and an aide memoire.  Clearly, weekly 
supply in standard containers is cheaper than weekly supply in an MMD and it is important to quantify 
the added value of the MMD.  Current practice is MMD weekly; this proposal is for a factorial design 
which will compare weekly with monthly supply and MMD with standard containers. 
 
Dispensing and administration errors  
The most substantial review to date of errors associated with MMD use was conducted in Australia; the 
Australian Incident Monitoring Study reported that 0.43% (52/12,000) of all medication related errors 
were associated with MMDs.  In 26 cases, there was a problem with filling the MMD such as wrong dose, 
dose omission or wrong medication.  In 21 of these cases, nursing staff were responsible for the error 
with the remainder being attributable to pharmacy staff or a carer.  On 16 occasions problems using the 
MMD were cited as a reason for an error, however, the nature of these problems was not reported.  
Contributing factors to the reported problems included patient confusion/distraction and the MMD being 
inappropriate for the patient [25].  A further Australian audit of dispensing errors associated with 6,972 
dispensed MMDs detected an error rate of 4.3% [26]. 
 
A 2007 UK evaluation of dispensing error rate associated with the pharmacy ‘usual’ dispensing process, 
reported 1.7% content errors out of 2859 dispensed items.  Content errors were errors of omission, 
incorrect drug, incorrect strength, dosage form, added or missing dose units and expired medication.  A 
similar US based study conducted in 2003 reported an identical 1.7% error rate [27].   
 
Whilst general dispensing error rates are 1.7%, there are no UK data for MMD error rates and thus from 
Australia suggest widely different potential error rates.  It is necessary therefore to record error rates for 
dispensing into MMDs and usual packaging. 
 
Despite, therefore, the large amount of both NHS and private funds devoted to MMDs, evidence for their 
value is limited as indicated by a Department of Health commissioned literature review conducted by 
Bhattacharya [5]. A 2006 Cochrane review concluded that MMDs may improve adherence ‘with selected 
conditions examined to date’ however, further research is necessary to improve targeting.[6]  In order 
to achieve this, therefore, the impact of MMDs on a more heterogeneous population needs to be 
established.

Adherence measurement 
No definitive trial demonstrating the effect of MMDs has been conducted to date.  The few Randomised 
Controlled Trials (RCTs) have been limited by small sample sizes, insufficient data to characterize the 
sample population or focussed on a specific disease area [3, 28-30].  The rationale for focus on a 
specific disease area is to enable therapeutic outcome or detection of chemicals in body fluids to be used 
as a measure of adherence.  Thus, little guidance is available to guide targeting of the wider population 
of patients for MMDs in routine practice.  Historically, direct measures of adherence such as observation 
and detection of chemicals in bodily fluids have been considered the ‘gold standard’.  Observation clearly 
has significant cost implications for large scale studies and is subject to ‘Hawthorne effect’.  Detection of 
chemicals in body fluids has the merit of being objective, however, it can be invasive, costly and is still 
liable to patients altering their medication taking behaviour in the days prior to sample provision.  Some 
of the disadvantages associated with observation as an adherence measure are exemplified by a trial in 
which patients were randomised to receive potassium supplementation or placebo tablets.  
Measurement of urine potassium levels identified a reduction over time which was most likely 
attributable to reduced patient compliance with 24 hour urine sample collection with trial progression 
and hence measured potassium levels were artificially low [31].  The taking of blood samples would 
overcome the issues of patient compliance with inconvenient 24 hour urine samples, however, patient 
acceptability of frequent blood samples is even lower and has been demonstrated to adversely affect 
trial recruitment with 52% of patients not consenting to trial participation citing fear of phlebotomy[32].  
An additional problem associated with such direct measures is intra- and inter-patient variability in drug 
metabolism.  This can be overcome to a certain extent by estimating individual variation via repeated 
samples over a short period of time; however, this type of invasive assessment has low patient 
acceptability.  Alternatively, Bayesian methodology can be used, however, this is complex and again only 
provides an estimate of variability. 
 
The Dosage Unit Count (DUC) is generally accepted as the pragmatic approach to adherence 
assessment.  It is based on the assumption that if the medication is not in the container, it is in the 
patient.  This is problematic when attempting to identify intentional non-adherence because patients 
may deliberately remove tablets and discard them in order to disguise their non-adherence.  However, 
the assumption is valid if patients are predominantly unintentionally non-adherent.  Previous research 
has demonstrated that conducting DUCs on the older patient population is feasible and acceptable to 
patients [17]. 
 
Recent technological advances have enabled the development of an objective adherence measure which 
is less susceptible to the ‘Hawthorne effect’ by virtue of being less intrusive and less conspicuous to the 
patient than direct adherence measures or DUC.  Such electronic Medication Event Monitoring Systems 
(MEMS) have been widely used in clinical trials to assess medication adherence [12, 31, 33, 34].  MEMS 
were initially developed as a bottle containing a microprocessor in the cap.  The microprocessor then 
records the date and time of each bottle opening event.  However, usual dispensing is now generally in 
manufacturer issued packaging which in turn is generally in blister pack form.  Trials have therefore, 
generally approached this issue by decanting medication from usual packaging to MEMS in bottle form.  
This has the limitation of not assessing adherence in a naturalistic setting. 
 
Systems to monitor medication taking events have been developed for blister packs and therefore, this 
technology can now be applied to enable medication taking events from MMDs to be objectively and 
accurately recorded.  A two month pilot study (N=52) of this technology to assess feasibility and 
acceptability reported promising results.  Adherence data were obtained from 94.3% of participants and 
67.4% of participants reported that they would consider using the MEMS for a long term study. 
 
Validation of these systems is carried out prior to release and is achieved via removing medicines from 
the system when in situ at predefined times.  Standards exceeding 90% are frequently reported for the 
following: 
• 
Functionality – proportion of MEMS functioning at the end of the trial period 
• 
Sensitivity – proportion of recorded medication removal events compared with actual removal events 
• 
Specificity – proportion of recorded removals that correspond to actual removal events [35]

Version 3 24/03/2011 
Categorising non-adherence as intentional or unintentional can only be achieved via establishing the 
motivation for the deviation.  A number of self report tools have been developed to identify intentional 
non-adherence such as the Drug Attitude Inventory [36], Medication Adherence Rating scale [37] and 
the Brief Medication Questionnaire [38].  However, these have either not been validated for use with 
patients prescribed multiple medications for chronic diseases or are not specific to intentional non-
adherence.  The Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), however, has been validated for use on 
patients with a number of chronic diseases and is specific to intentional non-adherence [16].  The BMQ 
is an 11 item questionnaire which establishes patient attitude to their prescribed medication in terms of 
perceived necessity and concerns.  Analyses of questionnaire results yield a necessity–concerns 
differential.  Patients whose concerns score outweighs the necessity score  (negative necessity–concerns 
differential score) are significantly more likely to be intentionally non-adherent (p<0.001).  This is 
therefore considered to be an appropriate tool for ‘screening out’ intentionally non-adherent patients to 
ensure that they do not inappropriately receive a MMD. 
 
The Medication Adherence Report Scale is a widely used 5 item adherence measure which provides for 
self reporting of intentional non-adherence.  As a much shorter tool than the BMQ it is likely to have 
greater patient acceptability, but, this may be compromised by reduced sensitivity.  It has, however, 
demonstrated good correlation between patient reported non-adherence and DUC results [17] and 
therefore, it is appropriate to compare it’s sensitivity and specificity to the BMQ. 
 
The Medication Adherence Questionnaire (MAQ) developed by Morisky, is a 4 item self report adherence 
questionnaire validated with clinical outcome [39].  Blood pressure readings of participants prescribed 
antihypertensives were monitored for a five year period and self reported adherence using the MAQ was 
recorded.  There was found to be a significant correlation between a high MAQ score predicting good 
adherence and good blood pressure control. 
 
Patient autonomy 
In addition to the impact of MMDs on adherence, it is important to establish patient acceptability.  No 
studies have reported the impact of MMDs on patient autonomy or ability to manage ones own 
medication, however, there is anecdotal evidence of reduced autonomy as patients are unable to 
differentiate one medication from another in an MMD and therefore cannot select one type of 
medication to omit over another where that is desired (e.g. delaying taking a diuretic when taking a long 
journey) sometimes resulting in omission of all [2].  Conversely, patients may report that they feel 
enabled by feeling confident about managing their medication.  A number of studies have explored 
patient autonomy with respect to medication taking in the context of describing the extent to which 
patients feel involved in the decision making process[40-42].  However, exploration of whether patients 
feel as though they have some control over the medication taking process is limited.  The Patient 
Enablement Instrument whilst initially developed to establish the impact of a GP consultation on patient 
enablement [43], has been widely used and validated within general practice including the older 
population.  As a 6 item questionnaire, which with minor modification to the opening statement will be 
applicable to MMDs, it is an appropriate choice for assessing the impact of MMDs on patient confidence 
in their ability to manage their own medication. 
 
Recruitment rate and methodology 
Whilst passive recruitment via medical practice invitation letters is convenient in terms of research 
administration, response rates have historically been low as the method requires the patient to be pro-
active in responding to a letter invitation; consent rates are frequently between 30% and 40% [18, 44]  
Active recruitment processes such as waiting room recruitment by researcher, however, whilst more 
labour intensive and thus costly, have yielded substantially higher response rates[45-48].  Identification 
of the most cost-effective approach to recruitment is therefore required within any feasibility study. 
 
MMD selection 
A number of MMDs are commercially available; produced by different manufacturers, they vary 
considerably in terms of their size and method via which medication is accessed from the device [5].  
Four MMDs (Venalink®, Nomad Clear®, Dosett® and Medidose®) represent the four different types of 
device that are most widely used, collectively accounting for over 90% of the market share [13].  The 
APPENDIX 3

136
 09/34/03 
Version 3 24/03/2011 
Venalink® is a cold sealed device which is also similar to most commercially available heat sealed 
devices and most closely represents blister packaging.  The Nomad Clear® represents monitored dosage 
systems which are tamper evident systems and are sealed once the medication has been dispensed into 
the device.  The Dosett® is one of the oldest commercially available MMDs and is similar to most MMDs 
sold within community pharmacies for patients to fill themselves or to be filled by non trained carers 
[49].  The Medidose® is the only device that allows patients to carry one day’s doses rather than a full 
week. 
 
Patient characterisation 
Given the variations in MMD design and that patients have differing abilities and needs, it follows that 
choice of MMD should be as a result of discussion with the patient and assessment of ability to use the 
MMD.  A survey of 10 purposively sampled pharmacists reported that eight would select a MMD without 
involving the patient in the decision making and all pharmacists had a preferred MMD thus suggesting 
that patient needs would not be the primary driver of MMD selection [4].  A larger survey of 105 
pharmacists, however, reported that pharmacists perceived that checking patient ability to use an MMD 
was the most important factor when considering whether or not to provide a patient with a MMD [13]. 
 
Aside from the issues associated with intentional non-adherence, the most commonly reported factors to 
impair patient ability to adhere to their prescribed regimen are cognitive function, manual dexterity and 
visual acuity [5].  An Australian survey of older patients (N=120) with a mean age of 81.8 years 
characterised participants in terms of cognitive function and visual acuity and then assessed ability to 
open a variety of commercially produced medication packaging.  It was reported that 78.3% of 
participants were unable to open one or more of the medication packaging in order to access the 
medication.  It was found that inability to access medication was significantly associated with lower 
cognitive function and manual dexterity [50].  There is, therefore, a clear need to ensure that any MMD 
provided is suited to the patient.   
 
A study conducted by Bhattacharya et al. (N = 50) assessed patient ability to use MMDs via presenting 
participants with different MMDs and asking them to rank each MMD on a visual analogue scale in terms 
of ease of reading the text on the MMD, ease of opening the MMD in order to access placebo 
medication, ease with which placebo medication could be removed from the MMD, convenience with 
which the participant felt that they would be able to transport the MMD and overall rating of preference.  
Participants were then further characterised in terms of manual dexterity, visual acuity and cognitive 
function in order to identify any trends in preference of and/or ability to use MMDs with functional ability 
measured using validated tools [51]. 
 
Participant acceptance of visual acuity [52] and cognitive function [53] measurement was good, 
however, manual dexterity measurement using the standardised Purdue peg board test yielded low 
participant completion rates [54].  As might be expected, correlation between each of the validated test 
scores and patient performance in the corresponding skill required for using the MMDS was very high 
(R> 0.8).  In order to reduce the assessment burden, it therefore seems more appropriate to provide 
patients with the different types of MMD and assess their ability to use each device plus preference for 
device to inform MMD selection rather than using additional validated tests that are also less practical for 
use in the natural healthcare setting.  
 
In summary, the current evidence base provides a basic framework for the design of a trial to 
comprehensively estimate the effects of MMDs.  However, further preliminary work is necessary such as 
stakeholder involvement in order to optimise the feasibility of such a trial.

study to trial the effect of multi compartment medication devices.

The objectives of the study are, in a sample of patients and their carers to:   
• Gain a better understanding of some of the practical difficulties experienced by patients and their 
carers in adhering to complex medication regimes 
• Explore the appropriateness and acceptability of MMDs including issues such as desired level of 
patient choice in the type of MMD with which they are provided and the appropriateness and 
feasibility of proposed adherence measures 
• Establish the patient/carer perceived benefits and disadvantages of MMDs including any potential 
adverse outcomes such as loss of autonomy, routine etc 
• Explore the acceptability  of trial participant procedures including recruitment documentation, 
participant information sheets and survey tools 
and in a sample of healthcare practitioners to assess opinion on: 
o The  appropriateness and feasibility of the research design in terms of patient recruitment, 
outcome measures, costs and benefits 
• 
Potentially suitable patients for MMD provision and MMD selection including 
characterisation of patient ability (e.g. visual acuity, manual dexterity & cognitive function) 
• 
The size of a clinically important difference in patient adherence 
 
 
4. Research methods 
 
4.1. 
Literature review 
A literature review will be undertaken to identify the study design approaches which have been utilised 
within previous studies and therefore identify any appropriate enhancements to study design that may 
be trialled.  Strategies and inclusion criteria of the recent systematic review will be adopted and thus the 
review updated.  Additional considerations for RCT design not assessed by this search e.g. information 
regarding appropriate measures of functional assessment will be addressed by additional searches.  The 
research management group will consider the literature review findings when designing the pilot RCT. 
 
4.2. 
Focus Groups 
The lack of evidence for the effects of MMDs may be partially attributable to the complexities of 
developing a randomised controlled trial to test these devices.  Challenges include developing an 
effective and acceptable method of measuring adherence, selecting appropriate MMDs for testing, 
measuring and recording relevant outcomes i.e. advantages and disadvantages and then achieving 
acceptable patient uptake to the trial.  This project is therefore intended to capture information from 
stakeholders via focus group discussions to inform the design of a subsequent trial to test MMDs.  One 
or two focus groups will be convened with each of patients, informal carers and carers in sheltered 
housing.  A separate focus group will be convened with healthcare practitioners. 
 
4.2.1 Sample size 
Each focus group will be of six to ten participants.  For patients/carers, there will be one or two focus 
groups.  To account for attrition owing to unforeseen circumstances, up to 16 participants will be 
recruited as per criteria outlined in section 4.2.2.  For healthcare practitioners there will be one focus 
group. 
 
4.2.2 Participant identification and recruitment 
Generic inclusion and exclusion criteria applicable to all focus group participants are outlined below.  
Additional criteria relevant to the individual categories of participants are indicated in the appropriate 
following sections. 
 
Inclusion criterion 
• Aged over 18 years 
 
Exclusion criteria 
• Unable to read or speak English 
• Unable to provide informed consent

I) Patient/carer focus groups 
I a) 
Patients and informal carers 
Patients and informal carers will be identified and recruited via medical practices.  The term ‘informal 
carer’ refers to friends and relatives who support patients in their medication organisation and/or taking 
but receive no remuneration.  Six medical practices and the pharmacies geographically close to these 
medical practices in NHS Norfolk have expressed an interest in being involved with this study and any 
subsequent pilot trial of MMDs.  Patients and informal carers will be purposively sampled by clinical 
members of these medical practices.  Patients and informal carers will be identified by medical practice 
staff initially via a computerised search for patients aged over 75 years of age, prescribed more than 
three regular medications and excluding patients with recorded severe cognitive impairment such as 
Alzheimer's disease.  The resulting list will be manually searched by the most appropriate member of the 
medical practice team which may be a GP or a non-medical member of the prescribing team.  The 
search will be conducted to identify patients that meet the following criteria: 
• Patients representing a range of medication taking behaviour: 
o Some suspected of intentional and some of unintentional non-adherence plus patients 
considered to have excellent adherence 
• Patients representing a range of regimen complexity: 
o From, three regularly prescribed medicines through to five or more 
o Prescribed multiple formulations e.g. inhalers, eye drops and creams or ointments 
• Patients using MMDs 
• Patients that declined the use of a MMD 
• Patients with mild cognitive impairment (sufficient in the clinician’s opinion to allow provision of 
informed consent and engagement with a focus group) 
• Patients with manual dexterity problems 
• All patients will be over 75 years of age 
• Informal carers who manage medication 
 
These patients and carers will be recruited via letter posted from the medical practice for return to the 
research team.  Written, informed consent will be sought.  After two weeks, a follow up letter will be 
sent to non-responders.   
 
Additional inclusion criteria for patient participants 
• 
Aged 75 years or over 
• 
Registered with one of six participating medical practices 
• 
Prescribed three or more oral solid dosage form medications 
 
Additional inclusion criteria for informal carer participants 
• Registered with one of six participating medical practices 
• Known by medical practice staff to support a person aged over 75 years in managing his / her 
medication 
 
I b) 
Carers in sheltered housing 
Independence in terms of medication administration generally declines with progression from patient’s 
own home through sheltered housing, residential homes and then homes with nursing.  Carers in the 
latter two organisations will therefore have little experience of MMDs and patient self administration 
difficulties as residents of these institutions tend not to self administer their medication.  
 
Wardens of sheltered housing, however, are likely to be aware of any regular informal care received by 
people within the sheltered housing complex.  A list of contact details of sheltered housing complexes 
and their wardens will be obtained from Norfolk County Council Adult Social Services. Wardens will be 
contacted by mail and requested to distribute the carer information leaflets and consent forms to carers 
supporting people in the sheltered housing. .  Written, informed consent will be sought for contact from 
the researchers to arrange the focus groups.  After two weeks, a follow up letter will be sent to non-
responders if a desirable response rate is not achieved.

Healthcare practitioners 
Participants will be recruited by letter from the six medical practices and pharmacies taking part in the 
study and from the local hospital trusts.  Purposive sampling will be used to ensure representation from 
general practitioners, pharmacists, community nurses and consultants specialising in the care of older 
people.  Written, informed consent will be sought (appendices 2 and 4).  After two weeks, a follow up 
letter will be sent to non-responders.    
 
4.2.3 Focus group conduct 
The focus groups will be moderated by the study Research Associate (RA) and Dr Salter will attend as 
second moderator.  Permission will be sought from participants for the RA to record the focus group.  
These will then be transcribed verbatim and entered into NVivo 8 to manage, sort and facilitate analysis 
of the data.  All data will be kept securely and destroyed at the end of the project. 
 
I. Patient/carer 
Each focus group will last between 60 minutes and   90 minutes.  The focus groups will take place at a 
local and convenient centre such as a community centre and refreshments will be served.  Participants 
will be offered transport or reimbursed for all travel costs incurred.  A £20 voucher will be provided to 
patient/carer participants as thanks. Consent for proceedings to be audiotaped will be reaffirmed at the 
start of the focus group.  
 
Topic guide for patient/carer focus group 
 
The focus group topic guide will be informed by the literature review and designed to address the study 
objectives. It is likely to include:  
• What are your thoughts and experiences of taking medication or helping others to take their 
medication? 
• What are your thoughts and experiences of medication organisers? 
 
o Good aspects and not so good aspects 
• What are your opinions about how much choice is given to patients about the type of medication 
organiser that is provided and how much guidance is given in selection? 
• We are planning to measure how medication is taken by putting the medicines in a clear case 
which records every time that it is open, what are your thoughts about this? 
o Good aspects and not so good aspects 
 
The group will be managed to encourage free discussion and to generate a wide range of ideas and 
opinions. Participants will also be provided with samples of questionnaires and information leaflets that 
may be used in the main trial to determine their opinion on the appropriateness of this material for 
patients. 
 
II. Healthcare practitioners   
The focus group will last last between 60 minutes and   90 minutes and refreshments will be served.  
The focus groups will take place either at an NHS site such as one of the local study medical practices, 
the hospital or the University of East Anglia.  Expenses will be reimbursed including locum cover. 
Consent for proceedings to be audio taped will be reaffirmed at the start of the focus group.  
 
 
Topic guide for healthcare practitioners 
The focus group topic guide will be informed by the literature review and designed to address the study 
objectives. it is likely to include:  
 
• 
From your experience, what types of problems do patients experience with adhering to their 
medication regiments? 
• 
What types of action have you taken to address these issues? 
• 
What types of patients may benefit or not from receiving a MMD?

4.2.4 Analysis 
 
A framework style analysis will be applied as it is particularly appropriate in research where clear policy 
and practice solutions are sought (http://www.scpr.ac.uk).  It is also proven to be useful where in-depth 
methods are being used to inform further larger scale study design [55]. Framework analysis is a five-
stage process that ultimately allows for sensitive analysis of the relationship between concepts and 
typologies across and within individual focus groups [56].  The stages of the analysis will be shared with 
the study trial management committee and steering group to enhance the transparency and validity of 
interpretation. 
 
 
5. Research governance 
The University of East Anglia will act as sponsor and has appropriate insurance policies in place to 
provide professional indemnity and public liability cover for any harm to participants or researchers 
arising from the design of the research. 
 
The Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will ensure that the project is appropriately managed, reports are 
sent to the HTA and all ethical and governance requirements are met.  This project is a feasibility study 
and therefore a separate data management committee will not be required. 
 
 
6. Service Users 
The Patient and Public Involvement in Research (PPIRes) project is a local initiative to enable and 
encourage volunteer members of the public to actively participate with researchers in trial development 
and delivery.  Two members of PPIRes have agreed to join the trial steering committee

 TOPIC GUIDE 
Healthcare professional focus group meeting 
15.15-15.20 Welcome from facilitators (5 minutes) 
• Debi, Sathon, Clare and Trish 
• Core team members working on a study to test the effect of medication organisers 
• Thank you for coming along today 
• Appreciate taking the time to share your thoughts and opinions 
We are designing a study to test the effect of medication organisers compared with usual 
medication packaging. The main aim of this group meeting is to gain expert opinion on 
the effects of medication organisers and our plans for the study design. 
o There are no right or wrong answers – we are interested in a range of opinions 
and experiences 
o Everyone will have a chance to speak and be heard  
 
• There are just a two ground rules for the focus group 
o Firstly, the discussion will be recorded, so please allow each person to speak 
without interruption just so that when we come to write this up we can actually 
tell who is talking. 
o The information that we write up will be completely anonymous so it will say 
group member 1, 2 or 3 for example – there will be no names. 
o The second rule is that anything you learn about someone else in this 
discussion must be kept completely confidential so you cannot repeat anything 
that you hear during this discussion outside of this room. 
• Is that OK?, OK to start? 
15.20-15.30 Introductions (10 minutes) 
• For the purposes of the recording, please introduce yourself:  
o What you would like to be called 
o Your current professional role 
o Your experiences of medication organisers 
15.30-15.50 Experience of medication management/medication organisers (20 
minutes) 
• From your experiences, what types of patients experience problems with adhering to 
their medication regimens and why? 
• What sorts of strategies have you used or recommended to address non-adherence? 
• There is a wide variety of MOs available and we have a few different types here. What 
are your thoughts about these and any others of which you have experience? 
• What types of patients may benefit (or not) from receiving MO? 
o Any criteria for recommending a MO? 
• Any groups of patients which should be excluded from a trial?

147
 Prompt: Any particular preferences or concerns 
 
15.50-16.00 Wider effects of MOs (10 minutes) 
• Thinking about the effects of MOs, how may they affect a patient, their carer, family or 
friends? 
• What about the wider effects? 
Prompt: Time associated with writing Rx, filling box, carer, anxiety 
 
16.00-16.40 Study design (40 minutes) 
We are designing a study to test the effect of medication organisers. The aim of the study is 
to determine the effect of these on adherences in older people.  
• First question is – who are older people? 
o Any challenges to recruiting this population to this study?  
• If I talk you through the plans, it would be good if you would let me know what you 
think may not work or could be further improved in terms of practicalities and 
acceptability. 
 
 
Recruitment method (10 mins) 
Plan to try 2 approaches to see which is best for recruiting 120 patients per practice: 
1. 
For half of the surgeries involved we’d like them to screen their records for eligible 
patients and send them letters with a follow up letter after two weeks. 
2. 
For the other half of the recruited surgeries we’d like them to invite eligible patients 
who attend surgery for a routine appointment to see a researcher who will be located 
in the waiting area of the practice. 
Any thoughts?  Problems with this plan?  Are we likely to get the numbers that we need? 
(120 per practice) 
 
 
Proposed trial design (15 mins) 
Thinking more about what will happen to participants, the handout provides an outline. 
• It would be useful if you could tell us your thoughts regarding these steps 
o What types of patients suitable/ unsuitable? 
o Can you foresee any potential problems that might occur at this stage? 
• Are there other measurements which would help to fully capture the benefits and 
potential problems of MOs? (Wider factors influence by MOs) 
 
 
 
APPENDIX 4

148
 Outcome Measures, Costs and Benefits (15 mins) 
• In order to decide whether the MOs are better or worse than usual packaging we 
need to decide on what the minimum acceptable level of adherence is.  Thinking 
about the range of medicines that you prescribe, supply or encounter, what do you 
think is the minimum acceptable level? 
Prompt: 80% is often quoted as being acceptable but there is no clinical evidence to support 
this number. 
• Having thought about the minimum acceptable adherence level, when we compare 
these MOs with usual packaging, what size of difference in adherence might be 
clinically important.   
 
16.40-16.45 Summary and close (5 minutes) 
• Is there anything else that you to add? 
• Thank you for your participation, we will keep all of this information confidential and 
now get designing the study. 
• If you would like a copy of the report, let Sathon know and we will send you a 
summary.

2. INTRODUCTION 
The aim of this study is to test whether Medication Organisation Devices (MODs) 
help patients to take their medication correctly. MODs are currently used by 
around 100,000 people in the UK, at a cost of several million pounds per year. 
Some MODs are supplied by the NHS under the Disability Discrimination Act, but 
in many cases patients or their carers bear the cost themselves. Although 
pharmacists, clinicians, patients and carers believe that MODs aid adherence to 
complex medication regimes; this proposal has not yet been tested in a 
randomised controlled trial (RCT). 
Under this RCT, diverse measures will be used: Objective measures such as 
Objective therapy Compliance Monitoring (OtCMTM) films which record when a pill 
has been removed from its packaging; subjective measures including 
questionnaires which ask patients about their medication-taking and attitudes 
towards their medication, quality of life, satisfaction with the trial and perceived 
changes in autonomy; and the views of their carer(s). In addition to this, post-RCT 
focus groups for participants and healthcare professionals will be arranged, with a 
view to using these qualitative data to further refine the design of the proposed 
definitive study. Data will be accessed in a number of formats including paper-
based records, electronic audio recording, RFID-enabled devices, and computer-
based data.

Six medical practices and their respective pharmacies will take part in this 
research project. Patients will be invited to participate by either passive (postal) or 
active means (introduction by GP then personal approach by researcher). The trial 
will take part in two main phases: a 3-week trial followed at exactly four weeks 
post initiation by a 3-month trial. 
It is anticipated that 720 participants will be assessed for suitability, 576 will take 
part in the 3-week trial and 160 will go on to participate in a 3-month, 2 x 2 
factorial trial comprising medication from: usual packaging weekly; MOD weekly; 
usual packaging monthly; MOD monthly. A simple flow chart is appended 
(Appendix 1). 
 
3. SCOPE 
This SOP is provided by the UEA Research team to each Medical Practice team 
to provide clear instruction for all trial procedures; facilitate project management 
and ensure appropriate management and confidential storage of materials and 
data for the Medication Organisation Device project (NIHR HTA 09/34/03).  
 
4. DEFINITIONS 
MOD 
Device used for organisation of medicines to facilitate correct taking of 
prescribed medicines. In this case MODs refer only to Nomad Clear, 
Nomad Clear XL and Venalink devices. Each of these is divided into 
compartments labelled with days of the week and times of the day.  
 RFID  
Wireless non-contact system that uses radio-frequency electronic 
fields to transfer data from a tag attached to an object. 
OtCMTM 
Clear plastic film with printed microcircuit which adheres to the foil 
backing of drug blister packs and which, when the circuit is broken, 
records electronically the time and date of medicine –removal events. 
OSDF 
Oral solid dose form medicines are those in tablet or capsular format. 
 
5. RESPONSIBILITY 
Project management, assessment of participant ability, patient home visits and 
data collation will be the responsibility of researchers. 
Participant recruitment and specified data collation will be facilitated by medical 
practice personnel and GPs 
APPENDIX 9
NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk
172
 SOP GP Passive recruitment.doc v2 13082012 
 
 
 
Medication supply, delivery and storage of removed medicines, attachment of 
monitoring devices, collection and storage of used monitoring devices and specific 
data collation and provision will be the responsibility of pharmacists in conjunction 
with researchers. 
 
Individual researchers and project associated personnel are expected to behave 
in a professional manner and in accordance with NHS, Pharmacy and University 
rules and regulations and the project RISP agreement.  
All parties should be aware that as ‘persons receiving healthcare’, the subjects of 
this trial must be considered ‘vulnerable’ under the Safeguarding Vulnerable 
Groups Act (2006).  
If you have any concerns regarding individual participants or any 
procedures or safeguarding issues arising from this trial then you must 
immediately contact either the trial manager (Clare Aldus 01603 593944 or 
07538835530) or Chief Investigator (Debi Bhattacharya 01603 593391).

drug names and strengths relevant to the trial are detailed in Appendix 3. To be 
eligible to take part, patients should be prescribed at least two different solid oral 
dose forms at strengths indicated (Appendix 3).   
 
6.2.2 GP verification of list 
A list of patients fulfilling the stated criteria will be prepared and provided to the 
GP. The GP will identify any patients thought unsuited to inclusion for any other 
reason. For example, patient xxx should be excluded because he is known to be 
currently suffering from a severe depressive episode. Numbers of, and reasons 
for exclusion should be provided to researchers. The names of patients excluded 
in this way should not be revealed to researchers. Patients will be identified in the 
practice database if eligible for inclusion. 
 
6.2.3 Recruitment packs 
Practices will be provided with recruitment packs and a template letter of invitation 
(Letter 2, Appendix 4). The letter of invitation should be prepared on headed 
paper and individual Practice Manager or Practice Researcher contact details 
must be added to the letter as appropriate. This letter should then be added to the 
recruitment pack, with the address of the patient positioned at the window in the 
envelope, and the pack sent to potential participants. 
Recruitment packs will contain Letter 2 (inserted at the medical practice), a patient 
information leaflet (PIL), consent form, questionnaire 1, prescription request and 
collection application form and a stamped addressed envelope.  
Recruitment packs will be posted to all GP-verified eligible patients. Postage costs 
will be refunded by UEA. 
 
6.2.4 Reminder letter sent to non-responders 
Researchers will identify responders to the surgery. From this the GP practice can 
identify non-responders. A reminder letter (Letter 9; Appendix 6) should be 
prepared on headed paper, to be sent to non-responding potential recruits.  The 
letter of reminder should be prepared on headed paper with individual Practice 
Manager or Practice Researcher contact details added as appropriate. Postage 
and stationery costs will be refunded by UEA.

6.2.5 Further patient information required 
Researchers will provide GP practices with details of participants who have 
consented to take part in the trial so that additional information pertaining to these 
participants can be provided to researchers. Additional information comprises: 
1. Age 
2. Co-morbidities 
3. List of all medicines prescribed to participant  
4. NHS number for access to Health Episode Statistics; 
5. Details of use of practice services for the duration of the trial 
 
For all consented patients we will ask for details listed (items 1-3). These data will 
be used to characterise the study population. For consented patients who proceed 
to randomisation we will ask for further details (listed items 1-5).  The information 
required on the use of hospital and GP practice services will be used to determine 
differences in frequency and cost of healthcare utilisation for RCT intervention and 
control groups. We would like you to tell us:  
 
• The number of contacts with a healthcare professional within the practice 
• The type of healthcare professional e.g. nurse, GP or healthcare assistant 
• Whether it was in person at the practice, by telephone or a home visit 
 
Please note that we do not need to know why patients saw the healthcare 
professional. 
 
6.3 Providing feedback to researchers 
It is essential to the design of a future definitive trial to obtain both positive and 
negative feedback concerning the design and execution of the trial. Health care 
professionals involved in the trial will be will be invited to take part in a focus group 
after the trial. Other feedback can be provided by email, letter or telephone. 
 
6.4 Post-trial discussion with participants. 
As a direct result of this trial, participants may feel that they would like to be 
assessed for suitability for receiving medicines in MODs. Researchers will refer

2. INTRODUCTION 
The aim of this study is to test whether Medication Organisation Devices (MODs) 
help patients to take their medication correctly. MODs are currently used by 
around 100,000 people in the UK, at a cost of several million pounds per year. 
Some MODs are supplied by the NHS under the Disability Discrimination Act, but 
in many cases patients or their carers bear the cost themselves. Although 
pharmacists, clinicians, patients and carers believe that MODs aid adherence to 
complex medication regimes; this proposal has not yet been tested in a 
randomised controlled trial (RCT). 
Under this RCT, diverse measures will be used: Objective measures such as 
Objective therapy Compliance Monitoring (OtCMTM) films which record when a pill 
has been removed from its packaging; subjective measures including 
questionnaires which ask patients about their medication-taking and attitudes 
towards their medication, quality of life, satisfaction with the trial and perceived 
changes in autonomy; and the views of their carer(s). In addition to this, post-RCT 
focus groups for participants and healthcare professionals will be arranged, with a 
view to using these qualitative data to further refine the design of the proposed 
definitive study. Data will be accessed in a number of formats including paper-
based records, electronic audio recording, RFID-enabled devices, and computer-
based data.

Six medical practices and their respective pharmacies will take part in this 
research project. Patients will be invited to participate by either passive (postal) or 
active means (introduction by GP then personal approach by researcher). The trial 
will take part in two main phases: a 3-week trial followed at exactly four weeks 
post initiation by a 3-month trial. 
It is anticipated that 720 participants will be assessed for suitability, 576 will take 
part in the 3-week trial and 160 will go on to participate in a 3-month, 2 x 2 
factorial trial comprising medication from: usual packaging weekly; MOD weekly; 
usual packaging monthly; MOD monthly. A simple flow chart is appended 
(Appendix 1). 
 
3. SCOPE 
This SOP is provided by the UEA Research team to each Medical Practice team 
to provide clear instruction for trial procedures; facilitate project management and 
ensure appropriate management and confidential storage of materials and data 
for the Medication Organisation Device project (NIHR HTA 09/34/03).  
 
4. DEFINITIONS 
MOD 
Device used for organisation of medicines to facilitate correct taking of 
prescribed medicines. In this case MODs refer only to Nomad Clear, 
Nomad Clear XL and Venalink devices. Each of these is divided into 
compartments labelled with days of the week and times of the day.  
 RFID  
Wireless non-contact system that uses radio-frequency electronic 
fields to transfer data from a tag attached to an object. 
OtCMTM 
Clear plastic film with printed microcircuit which adheres to the foil 
backing of drug blister packs and which, when the circuit is broken, 
records electronically the time and date of medicine –removal events. 
OSDF 
Oral solid dose form medications are medications in tablet or capsular 
format 
 
5. RESPONSIBILITY 
Project management, recruitment, assessment of participant ability, patient visits 
and data collation will be the responsibility of researchers. 
APPENDIX 10
NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk
186
 SOP GP Active recruitment.doc V3 26092012 
 
Participant recruitment and specified data collation will be facilitated by medical 
practice personnel and GPs 
Medication supply, delivery and storage of removed medicines, attachment of 
monitoring devices, collection and storage of used monitoring devices and specific 
data collation and provision will be the responsibility of pharmacists in conjunction 
with researchers. 
 
Individual researchers and project associated personnel are expected to behave 
in a professional manner and in accordance with NHS, Pharmacy and University 
rules and regulations and the project RISP agreement.  
 
All parties should be aware that as ‘persons receiving healthcare’, the subjects of 
this trial must be considered ‘vulnerable’ under the Safeguarding Vulnerable 
Groups Act (2006).  
If you have any concerns regarding individual participants or any 
procedures or safeguarding issues arising from this trial then you must 
immediately contact either the trial manager (Clare Aldus XXX or XXX)
or Chief Investigator (Debi Bhattacharya XXX).

6.2.1 Database search 
The patient database will be searched according to the SystmOne search 
procedure detailed in Appendix 2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria with the list of 
drug names and strengths relevant to the trial are detailed in Appendix 3. To be 
eligible to take part, patients should be prescribed at least two different solid oral 
dose forms at strengths indicated (Appendix 3).  
 
6.2.2 GP verification of list 
 A list of patients fulfilling the stated criteria will be prepared and provided to the 
GP. The GP will identify any patients thought unsuited to inclusion for any other 
reason. For example, patient xxx should be excluded because he is known to be 
currently suffering from a severe depressive episode. Numbers of, and reasons 
for exclusion should be provided to researchers. The names of patients excluded 
in this way should not be revealed to researchers. Patients will be identified in the 
practice database if eligible for inclusion. 
 
6.2.3 Accommodating the researcher at the GP Practice 
Practices will facilitate the presence of the researcher by providing a desk or table 
and two chairs in patient waiting area. Researchers will provide all other study 
materials. 
 
6.2.4 Introducing eligible patients to the study 
When a patient ‘flagged’ on the patient database as eligible for the study, visits the 
surgery for a medical appointment at a time when a researcher is present at the 
practice, medical staff (this may be the receptionist, nurse or GP) will: 
1. Explain that there is a study going on regarding medication organisation 
devices and that they may be eligible to take part. 
2. Provide the patient with the patient information leaflet. 
3. Tell the participant that there is a researcher in the waiting area who will be 
very pleased to provide more detail about the study without obligation.  
4. 4. Note the name of the person to whom the PIL has been given so that 
person will not receive another copy of the PIL at a later date.

6.2.5 Further patient information required 
Researchers will provide GP practices with details of participants who have 
consented to take part in the trial so that additional information pertaining to these 
participants can be provided to researchers. Additional information comprises: 
1. Age 
2. Co-morbidities 
3. List of all medicines prescribed to participant  
4. NHS number for access to Health Episode Statistics; 
5. Details of use of practice services for the duration of the trial 
 
For all consented patients we will ask for details listed (items 1-3). These data will 
be used to characterise the study population. For consented patients who proceed 
to randomisation we will ask for further details (listed items 1-5).  The information 
required on the use of hospital and GP practice services will be used to determine 
differences in frequency and cost of healthcare utilisation for RCT intervention and 
control groups. We would like you to tell us:  
 
• The number of contacts with a healthcare professional within the practice 
• The type of healthcare professional e.g. nurse, GP or healthcare assistant 
• Whether it was in person at the practice, by telephone or a home visit 
 
Please note that we do not need to know why patients saw the healthcare 
professional. 
 
6.3 Providing feedback to researchers 
It would be beneficial to the design of a future definitive trial to obtain positive and 
negative feedback concerning the design and execution of the trial. Healthcare 
professionals involved with this trial will be invited to take part in a focus group 
after the trial. Other feedback can be provided by email, letter or telephone.

6.4 Post-trial discussion with participants 
As a direct result of this trial, participants may feel that they would like to be 
assessed for suitability for receiving medicines in MODs. Researchers will refer 
participants expressing this wish to pharmacists for professional advice. GPs may 
wish to refer patients expressing this wish to the local pharmacist or to the Norfolk 
Medicines Support Service.

Dear <Participant name> 
 
Thank you for taking part in the Medication Organisation study and for 
returning your completed questionnaire to us.  
 
Research has shown that pill boxes are used by patients with particular 
pill-taking habits and so we would like to test the organiser with similar 
patients. The results of your questionnaire were very helpful to us but 
indicate that you do not have the pill taking behaviour we are trying to 
identify. As a result, we do not need you to take any further active part in 
this study.  
 
The study will continue until March 2013 and once the study is complete 
we will prepare a report of the findings. If you requested a summary of 
the project we will send that to you after March 2013.  
 
Once again, thank you very much for taking part in our study. 
Yours sincerely,

2. INTRODUCTION 
The aim of this study is to test whether Medication Organisation Devices (MODs) 
help patients to take their medication correctly. MODs are currently used by 
around 100,000 people in the UK, at a cost of several million pounds per year. 
Some MODs are supplied by the NHS under the Disability Discrimination Act, but 
in many cases patients or their carers bear the cost themselves. Although 
pharmacists, clinicians, patients and carers believe that MODs aid adherence to 
complex medication regimes; this proposal has not yet been tested in a 
randomised controlled trial. 
Under this RCT, diverse measures will be used: Objective measures such as 
Objective therapy Compliance Monitoring (OtCMTM) films which record when a pill 
has been removed from its packaging; subjective measures including 
questionnaires which ask patients about their medication-taking and attitudes 
towards their medication, quality of life, satisfaction with the trial and perceived 
changes in autonomy; and the views of their carer(s). In addition to this, post-RCT 
focus groups for participants and healthcare professionals will be arranged, with a 
view to using these qualitative data to further refine the design of the proposed 
definitive study. Data will be accessed in a number of formats including paper-
based records, electronic audio recording, RFID-enabled devices, and computer-
based data.  
Six medical practices and their respective pharmacies will take part in this 
research project. The trial will take part in two main phases: a 3-week trial 
followed at exactly four weeks post initiation by a 3-month trial.

It is anticipated that 720 participants will be assessed for suitability, 576 will take 
part in the 3-week trial and 160 will go on to participate in a 3-month, 2 x 2 
factorial trial comprising medication from: usual packaging weekly; MOD weekly; 
usual packaging monthly; MOD monthly. A simple flow chart is appended 
(Appendix 1). 
 
3. SCOPE 
This SOP is provided by the UEA Research team to each Pharmacy team to 
provide clear instruction for all trial procedures; facilitate project management and   
ensure appropriate management and confidential storage of materials and data 
for project NIHR HTA 09/34/03. It should be used in conjunction with local SOP 
documents (see Section 7). 
 
4. DEFINITIONS 
MOD 
Device used for organisation of medicines to facilitate correct taking of 
prescribed medicines. In this case MODs refer only to Nomad Clear, 
Nomad Clear XL and Venalink devices. Each of these is divided into 
compartments labelled with days of the week and times of the day.  
 RFID  
Wireless non-contact system that uses radio-frequency electronic 
fields to transfer data from a tag attached to an object. 
OtCMTM 
Clear plastic film with printed microcircuit which adheres to the foil 
backing of drug blister packs and which, when the circuit is broken, 
records electronically the time and date of medicine –removal events. 
 
5. RESPONSIBILITY 
Project management, assessment of participant ability, patient visits and data 
collation will be the responsibility of researchers. 
Medication supply and delivery, attachment of monitoring devices, collection and 
storage of used monitoring devices and specific data collation and provision will 
be the responsibility of pharmacists in conjunction with researchers. 
 
Individual researchers and pharmacy personnel are expected to behave in a 
professional manner and in accordance with Pharmacy and University rules and 
regulations and the project RISP agreement.

All researchers should be aware that as ‘persons receiving healthcare’, the 
subjects of this trial must be considered ‘vulnerable’ under the Safeguarding 
Vulnerable Groups Act (2006).  
If you have any concerns regarding individual participants or any 
procedures or safeguarding issues arising from this trial then you must 
immediately contact either the trial manager (Clare Aldus XXX or XXX)
 
or Chief Investigator (Debi Bhattacharya XXX).

6.2 Providing a one month supply of medicines for the three week trial  
All participants (likely to be ~576 across all practices) who are eligible for the 3-
week trial will be provided with a one-month supply of their medication. Duplicate 
labels should be prepared for each medication. One label should be applied to the 
medicines and the second given to the researcher as a record of medicines 
dispensed at Visit 1. This medication and duplicate labels will be collected from 
the pharmacy at a pre-arranged, mutually convenient time by the researcher. The 
researcher will deliver the medication to the participant in person at Visit 1 (see 
Appendix 1). For each participant the trial will start from the date of delivery of this 
medication and this is important to the pharmacist because it determines the start 
date for the 3-month trial for eligible participants (i.e. 28 days from the start of the 
3-week trial).  
 
6.3 Enrolling participants in the NHS repeat dispensing scheme and 
removing them from the scheme 
All participants who are eligible for the 3-month trial (likely to be 160 across all 
practices) will be signed up to the scheme to manage the request and collection of

repeat prescriptions (see local SOP). Researchers will ensure that participants 
complete the repeat dispensing scheme proforma and will pass the signed 
documentation to the pharmacist for implementation. Some of the participants will 
already be included in this scheme. It will be the responsibility of the pharmacist to 
ensure that all patients are enrolled in the scheme.  
After the trial, researchers will inform pharmacists which participants, if any, have 
requested to be removed from the NHS repeat dispensing scheme and it will be 
the responsibility of the pharmacist to action these requests.  
 
6.4 Storage and disposal of medicines removed from participants  
Once the one-month supply of medication has been delivered by the researcher to 
the participant, all old supplies of  prescribed solid oral dose forms  will be  placed 
in tamper evident packaging and stored at the home of the participant. This is to 
avoid confusion for the trial participant, regarding which medication package 
should be used. No medicines belonging to trial participants will be stored at the 
pharmacy. However, it is possible that in a few cases, drugs which are out of date 
or no longer needed by participants will be returned to the pharmacy by the 
researcher for disposal. Disposal should be carried out according to usual 
pharmacy procedures.  It is also possible that patients express opinions to you 
about the method of medication removal. On gaining their permission, please 
record these comments. 
 
6.5 Preparing medications for participants according to allocation 
Researchers will ascertain that participants are capable of using the OtCMTM films 
and which is their preferred MOD-type and then record this information on 
Administration form 2 (Appendix 3). Researchers will provide participant names to 
the pharmacist, inform them which are allocated to which arm of the trial (MOD 
weekly, usual packaging weekly, MOD monthly, usual packaging monthly) and the 
preferred MOD-type for each participant. 
 
MODs to be used are Venalink, Nomad Clear and Nomad Clear XL. 
Medications to be measured under the trial are as tabulated (Table 1). All these 
products must be from designated manufacturers as the OtCMTM films are very 
specific to particular pack sizes.

Researchers will provide information on which are the preferred MODs for 
participants and sufficient MODs and OtCMTM films to pharmacies in a timely 
manner. Pharmacy staff will fill and check MODs according to local SOPxxxx and 
Local SOP:xxxxxxxxx respectively  and provide MODs and medication in usual 
packaging to participants according to allocation. Pharmacists will apply OtCMTM 
films to all MODs and usual packaging for all medications tabulated (Table 1) 
according to manufacturer’s specifications and training.  
 
6.6 Delivery or collection of medicines on a weekly or monthly basis  
Pharmacists will be responsible for arranging delivery of medicines to the homes 
of all those allocated to weekly supply. Weekly delivery may lead to additional 
delivery costs for the pharmacy. Additional delivery costs incurred will be 
reimbursed.  Funding has been secured and details of the mechanism of 
reimbursement will be provided to individual pharmacies by researchers. 
Pharmacists and participants will be responsible for arranging delivery or 
collection of medicines to those allocated to monthly supply according to 
participants’ usual procedure.  Duplicate labels should be printed for all

medications. One label is to be applied to the medication in the usual manner and 
the other to be applied to Administration form 3 or administration form 3 follow-on 
sheets. 
The OtCMTM films applied to the medicine in usual packaging and MODs carry 
data which are critical to the success of the project. It is important that, whenever 
possible, pharmacists and delivery staff reiterate the importance of retaining all 
used packaging and returning it to the pharmacy.  
 
6.7 Arranging collection and storage of used packaging 
Participants will be expected to take their medicines as prescribed and then to 
collect and return all used packaging to the pharmacist. The OtCMTM films are not 
individually identified as belonging to a person or a particular medicine type. It is 
very important that used packaging is collected and stored in a systematic 
manner in the clearly labelled receptacle provided for each participant. 
For medicine deliveries: Pharmacists should inform the delivery driver that he or 
she should 1) collect used packaging in the receptacle provided and 2) deliver it to 
the pharmacy for storage. Additional costs incurred for collection will be 
reimbursed. 
For medicine collections: Pharmacists should either collect packaging from 
participants or their representative at the point of issue of new medication or 
remind them to continue to retain and return the packaging at their next visit. 
Researchers will periodically collect retained packaging from the pharmacy. 
 
 
 
6.8 Administration form 3  
One aspect of this study is to determine differences between MODs and usual 
packaging. This involves, for example, recording differences in the time taken to 
dispense medication by each system and numbers of alleged near misses. 
Researchers will provide pharmacists with Administration form 3 (Appendix 4) for 
recording these data for each participant. This form will be completed by the 
pharmacy for each participant and will be stored in the project folder within the 
pharmacy.

6.9 Study information  
During and after the trial researchers will collect all returned packaging and 
administration forms from pharmacies. 
 
6.10 Providing feedback to researchers 
It would be beneficial to the design of a future definitive trial to obtain positive and 
negative feedback concerning the design and execution of the trial. Pharmacists 
will be invited to take part in a focus group after the trial. 
Other feedback can be included in Administration form 3 or on separate sheets to 
be attached to Administration form 3. 
 
6.11 Post-trial discussion with participants. 
As a direct result of this trial, participants may feel that they would like to be 
assessed for suitability for receiving medicines in MODs. Researchers will refer 
participants expressing this wish to pharmacists for professional advice. 
Pharmacists may then wish to refer these participants to the Norfolk Medicines 
Support Service if appropriate.

 INTRODUCTION 
 
This SOP is for the Staff members of the NNUH Research and Development Department, 
Research and Enterprise Services at UEA and Research Teams at the NNUH and the UEA who 
are involved in healthcare research (other than those governed by the Medicines for Human 
Use ( Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004) to ensure that systems are in place for the recording, 
managing and reporting of adverse events in clinical research studies other than CTIMPs. 
 
 
The Chief Investigator (CI) /Principal Investigator (PI) must  be aware of the Trust and UEA  
systems for reporting adverse events and should read and agree to adhere to this SOP  to 
comply with the conditions of approval for studies sponsored in accordance with the Joint 
Research Governance Policy between NNUH and UEA. 
.  
Adverse events affecting Trust patients must continue to be reported into the Trust’s clinical risk 
systems in addition to those identified as a requirement through Research Governance and 
other regulatory frameworks as stated in this SOP. 
 
The CI/PI must ensure at the start of the study that out of hours procedures are in place in the 
event that a study participant needs to make contact. The CI/PI should test the emergency 
contact arrangements and document in the Trial Master File that such a test has taken place. As 
part of the Trust’s monitoring arrangements, regular testing of the emergency contact 
information will take place. 
 
  The Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care requires all healthcare 
research to  have a sponsor legally responsible for the conduct and monitoring of the study. The 
NNUH Research & Development Office will be responsible for monitoring all  healthcare

research for which the Trust or University acts as Sponsor unless there is an explicit monitoring 
arrangement to the contrary.   
 
It is essential that all adverse events which occur in patients or healthy volunteers during the 
course of their involvement in a research study are appropriately recorded and reported in order 
to ensure the continuing safety of study participants. 
The Department of Health’s Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care and 
the National Research Ethics Service set out specific requirements for the managing of adverse 
events (AE). Of particular importance is the assessment of any event for causality and 
expectedness.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   3    SCOPE 
This SOP applies to all healthcare research sponsored by NNUH or UEA which falls within the 
scope of the Research Governance Framework (2nd edition 2005). Where additional legislation 
applies, for example the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 (and 
amendments) or the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 SOP 205 must be followed. External 
sponsors may require use of their own SOPs and this will be specified in site agreements.  It is 
the responsibility of the local PI to ensure that study specific SOPs can be operated without 
conflict to this SOP and in accordance with all organisational polices related to research. 
 
 
 
4  DEFINITIONS 
 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A Serious Adverse Event is defined as any untoward occurrence  that: 
 results in death 
 is life-threatening 
 requires hospitalisation, or prolongation of existing inpatients’ hospitalisation. 
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 is otherwise considered medically significant by the investigator 
  
Comment: Life-threatening, in the definition of an SAE, refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe. Medical judgement should be exercised in deciding 
whether an adverse event is serious in other situations. Important adverse events that are not 
immediately life-threatening or do not result in death or hospitalisation but may jeopardise the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above, should also be considered serious. 
APPENDIX 18
NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk
230
  
SOP ref  206  
 
 
 
Severity: The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event. 
This is not the same as “serious”, which is based on participant/event outcome or action criteria. 
 
 
 
   
 
5    RESPONSIBILITY 
  
There are a number of responsibilities when managing adverse events. A list of responsibilities 
for both the Investigator and the Sponsor are included as appendix 1 and 2 respectively. 
 
The Chief Investigator (CI) on behalf of the Sponsor has overall responsibility for the conduct 
of the study. In a multi-site study, the CI has co-ordinating responsibility for reporting adverse 
events to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and to the 
relevant Research Ethics Committee (REC). 
 
The Principal Investigator (PI) has responsibility for the research at a local site where the 
study involves specified procedures requiring site-specific assessment. There should be one PI 
for each research site. In the case of a single-site study, the CI and the PI will normally be the 
same person. The PI is responsible for informing the CI, or the organising research team, of all 
adverse events that occur at their site following the guidelines below. 
 
 
The Joint Research Governance Committee undertakes the Research Governance functions 
for healthcare research involving the NNUH and UEA according to its Terms of Reference. 
 
The Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) may be formally delegated  Sponsor responsibilities recorded in 
the Delegation of Sponsor Responsibilities form. 
 
                             
 
6      PROCEDURES 
 
6.1 Study Planning 
 
 
 The protocol should include expected disease-related Adverse Events, which will not then need 
to be reported as SAEs. Treatment-related Adverse Events should also be described where 
these are expected. They may be recorded as secondary end points. A detailed explanation of 
SAE reporting procedures should also be included in the protocol. 
 
A generic SAE reporting form is available in Appendix 1 
 
6.1.1 Which AE to Record? 
The CI can decide how to record and report adverse events, whether expected or not, in 
accordance with the protocol. Adverse events are usually described on case report forms 
(CRFs), unless they are classified as serious, in which case, these should be reported on the

231
  
SOP ref  206  
 
 
generic SAE form (see Appendix 1 for an example). It should be clearly stated in the study 
protocol (and the local SOP if applicable) what will be recorded and how the reporting is to 
be managed. It may be decided that all, or only some, non-serious AEs are to be recorded, 
, depending on how critical they are to evaluation of the safety of the study. 
 
6.1.2 Which SAE to Report? 
For each study, the Sponsor should agree with the CI the timeframe during which SAEs 
must be notified. It should state in the protocol which SAEs can be defined as disease-
related and therefore not subject to expedited reporting. The procedures for managing and 
reporting SAEs must be clearly defined in the protocol. 
 
Where the Sponsor or Funder feel it is necessary an Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (IDMC)  should be appointed in order to review safety data regularly throughout 
the study and when necessary, recommend to the Sponsor whether to continue, modify or 
terminate the study. Again, this procedure must be defined in the protocol. As with all 
recording and reporting, subject confidentiality and adherence to the Data Protection Act 
(1998) must be maintained on all reports. 
 
6.2 During the Study 
 
Each AE must be evaluated according to the definitions in Section 4 for seriousness, causality 
(also see 6.2.1), and expectedness. The responsibility for this evaluation can be shared 
between the CI and PIs and this must be stated in the delegation of responsibilities between the 
Sponsor, the CI, the PI and his Trust. It may be most appropriate for the treating PI at each local 
site to evaluate each event, before reporting it to the CI. It must be stated in the protocol (and 
the local SOP if applicable) who will take responsibility for the assessment and reporting of such 
events to the Sponsor and CI simultaneously. This SOP assumes that responsibility of initial 
assessment and reporting to the CI lies with the PI.  
 
 
The flowchart in Appendix 2  is designed to enable Investigators/research personnel to assess 
AEs and SAEs should they occur during the study.  
If an AE occurs that that is likely to affect safety of the subjects the CI must take appropriate 
urgent safety measures to protect the participants against immediate hazard. (see SOP 230) 
 
 
6.2.1 Causality 
Adverse reactions should be assessed for causality using the definitions below. 
 
Relationship Description 
 
Unrelated  
There is no evidence of any causal relationship 
 
Unlikely  
There is little evidence to suggest there is a causal relationship (e.g. the event 
did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study 
procedure). There is another reasonable explanation for the event (e.g. the 
patient’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatment). 
 
APPENDIX 18
NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk
232
  
SOP ref  206  
 
 
Possible  
There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g. because the event 
occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study procedure). 
However, the influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g. 
the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments). 
 
Probable  
There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. 
 
Definitely  
There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. 
 
Not assessable There is insufficient or incomplete evidence to make a clinical judgement of the    
causal relationship. 
 
 
6.3 Reporting Guidelines 
 
Once the CI/PI has evaluated the AE in terms of seriousness, causality and expectedness, the 
following guidelines should be followed. 
 
6.3.1 AEs 
AEs that are not considered serious should be included on the relevant case report forms 
(CRFs). The completed form should be filed along with the other CRFs for the study and a copy 
provided to the Sponsor as agreed. Frequency will be decided by the Sponsor based on a risk 
assessment of the study. 
 
6.3.2 SAEs 
6.3.2.1 Procedure to be followed by Study CI in single site studies 
 
a) An event is identified by the CI and assessed for seriousness. 
 
b) All non-serious AEs will be recorded in the participant’s CRF. 
 
c) An SAE Form (Appendix 1) is completed by CI for all AEs considered to be serious. This role 
may be delegated to a member of the research team (and this should be recorded on the study 
delegation log). However, the completed form must be signed by the CI. 
 
d) The completed SAE Form must contain records of the event with the CI’s assessment of 
causality and expectedness. 
e) An entry of the details of the event must be made in the study SAE log. This log should be 
available to the Monitor for review during monitoring visits. Keep the completed SAE form in the 
Trial Master File with the SAE log and ensure that the event is followed up to satisfactory 
resolution. 
 
f) An SAE occurring to a research participant must be notified by the CI to the Sponsor (see 6.5) 
within 24 hours of the CI becoming aware of the event. This must be followed within 48hrs of 
becoming aware of the event by a detailed, written report.

SOP ref  206  
 
 
 
g) An SAE occurring to a research participant must be notified by the CI to the REC where in 
the opinion of the CI it was possibly, probably or definitely related, within 15 days of the CI 
becoming aware of it.  
 
h) The CI must in addition ensure that all local Trust safety policy rules are followed. 
 
 
j) The CI will report all logged events to the REC annually as a Safety Report, on the 
anniversary of the favourable opinion. 
The CI will report all  logged events to the Trust as required in the letter of permission. 
 
 
g) If the study has a  Trial Management Group, they must ensure that they regularly review 
SAEs, looking for possible trends etc. The review sessions must be minuted as having taken 
place, with a note of the attendees, and the SAES that have been reviewed.
 
 
6.3.2.2 Procedures for multi-centre studies. 
Site reporting procedure 
a) Every adverse event identified by the PI must be assessed for seriousness. 
 
b) All non-serious AEs will be recorded in the participant’s CRF. 
 
c) An SAE Form (Appendix 1) is completed by PI for all AEs considered to be serious. This role 
may be delegated to a member of the research team (and this should be recorded on the study 
delegation log). However, the completed Form must be signed by the PI 
 
d) The completed SAE Form must contain records of the event with the PI’s assessment of 
causality and expectedness Keep the completed SAE form in the site Trial Master File and send 
a copy (scan and email, or fax) to the CI and ensure the event is followed up to satisfactory 
resolution. This log should be available to the Monitor for review during monitoring visits.  
 
 
e) The PI must report the event to the CI within 24 hours of being made aware of the event. 
Where not all information is available while the SAE Form is being completed, the initial report 
must contain the following as a minimum: 
 Identifiable Event 
 Identifiable Patient 
 Identifiable Reporter. 
This must be followed within 48hrs of being made aware of the event by a detailed, written 
report. 
 
f) The PI must in addition ensure that all local Trust safety policy rules are followed. 
 
g) An entry of the event must be made in the study SAE log for the site. 
 
h) The PI will report all logged events to the Trust as required in the letter of permission. 
 
APPENDIX 18
NIHR Journals Library www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk
234
  
SOP ref  206  
 
 
 
Chief Investigator and Trial Management Group procedure 
a) Completed SAE Forms from sites are re-assessed by the CI for relationship to the study 
procedure. The CI will decide if he/she agrees with the PI on the classification or whether the 
status of the event should be upgraded. The CI may not downgrade an event. 
 
b) An entry of the details of the event must be made in the main study SAE log. 
 
c) An SAE occurring to a research participant must be notified by the CI to the Sponsor (see 
6.5) within 24 hours of the CI becoming aware of the event. This must be followed within 48hrs 
of becoming aware of the event by a detailed, written report.
 
 
 
d) An SAE occurring to a research participant must be notified by the CI to the main REC where 
it was possibly, probably or definitely related, within 15 days of the CI becoming aware of it.  
 
e) The CI will report all logged events to the main REC annually as a Safety Report, on the 
anniversary of the favourable opinion. 
The CI will report all  logged events to the lead Trust as required in the letter of permission. 
 
 
 
 d) If the study has a TMG, they must ensure that they regularly review SAEs, looking for 
possible trends etc. The review sessions must be minuted as having taken place, attendance 
and the SAEs that have been reviewed. 
 
 
 
 
 
6.3.3.1 Unblinding 
 
Systems for SAE  reporting should, as far as possible, maintain blinding of individual clinicians 
and of local trial staff involved in the day-to-day running of the trial. It is important that the details 
of the unblinding process are included in the study protocol. 
 
 
 
The Sponsor may require the participant treatment to be unblinded. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6.3.3.2 Reporting to PIs involved in Study 
For multi-centre trials all PIs within the trial concerned should also be informed of the SAE, as 
soon as possible, although this does not have to be within the 15-day deadline. All PIs should

between trials depending on the rates of recruitment and/or SAEs.  
 
 
6.4  Follow up and further reporting of SAEs 
 
All SAEs must be followed up by the PI/CI until satisfactory resolution, and this should be 
recorded as a Follow Up report on the SAE form, and on the SAE log. 
 
At each stage of follow up the PI/CI should sign and date the form. 
  
The PI in a multi-site study should send a copy of the revised SAE form to the CI. 
In single site or multi site studies, the CI should send a copy (scan and email, or fax) to the 
Sponsor (see 6.5).

  Appendix 21 Focus group topic guide post
randomised controlled trial (health-care professional)
TOPIC GUIDE 
Healthcare professional Post-study focus group 
19.30-19.35 Welcome from facilitators (5 minutes) 
• Debi, Sathon, Clare and Trish 
• Core team members working on a study to test the effect of medication organisers 
• Thank you for coming along today 
• Appreciate taking the time to share your thoughts and opinions 
We are designing a study to test the effect of medication organisers compared with usual 
medication packaging. The main aim of this group meeting is to find out about your 
experiences taking part in the study and to gain opinion on all aspects of the study: what 
worked well, what didn’t work well and what we should do to solve any problems. 
This information will be used in the design of large study that may take place in the future. 
o There are no right or wrong answers – we are interested in your opinions and 
experiences 
o Everyone will have a chance to speak and be heard  
 
• There are just a two ground rules for the focus group 
o Firstly, the discussion will be recorded, so please allow each person to speak 
without interruption just so that when we come to write this up we can actually 
tell who is talking. 
 The information that we write up will be completely anonymous so it will 
say group member 1, 2 or 3 for example – there will be no names. 
o The second rule is that anything you learn about someone else in this 
discussion must be kept completely confidential so you cannot repeat anything 
that you hear during this discussion outside of this room. 
• Is that OK?  OK to start? 
19.35-19.50 Introductions (15 minutes) 
• For the purposes of the recording, please introduce yourself:  
o What you would like to be called 
o Your current professional role 
o What part did you take in this project 
• Why did you agree to participate in this project? 
• If you had this time over would you do it again? 
• Any thoughts about this project? 
o Any good aspects; what worked effectively  
o Not good or not working

 19.50-20.05 Experiences of recruitment process (15 minutes) 
• Two recruitment processes were used in this project 
o Screened the records for eligible patients and sent them letters with a follow up 
letter after two weeks. 
o Screened the records for eligible patients, invited to see a researcher who was 
located in the waiting area of the practice. 
• Any thought about these methods? 
Prompt: Clinical screening, any particular preferences or concerns  
20.05-20.15 Experiences of preparation for Visit 1 (10 minutes) 
• This stage involved providing a one-month supply of medicines for the three week trial. 
GP was asked for one-month prescription and Pharmacy was asked to dispense a 
one-month usual supply and duplicate a medication label. 
o Any comments about this? 
o Was there anything we could have done differently? 
Prompt: Time associated with this stage, communication with researchers 
20.15-20.40 Experiences of trial phase (25 minutes) 
• Researcher informed practice manager of the names of patients’ who randomised or 
excluded after pill count (visit 2) and requested two-month prescriptions. 
o Any thought about this stage? 
• Supplying the medicines as prescribed (usual or MODs) including medication delivery 
or collection process. 
o Any comments about this stage? 
o Any difficulties of this stage? 
o What you think could be further improved in terms of practicalities and 
acceptability for this stage. 
20.40-20.55 Experiences of follow up phase and post study completion (15 minutes) 
• We have asked GP practices to provide us with details like medication history and the 
number of practice visits.   
o Any comments about this process? 
• For pharmacies we have asked you to complete a form for each patient to provide 
information like the time it took you to dispense for trial patients, near misses, plus 
collection and storage of empty packaging. 
More generally, are there any thoughts or comments related to the end of the study. 
• Patient related 
• Practice and pharmacy related 
20.55-21.00 Summary and close (5 minutes) 
• Is there anything else that you would like to add? 
• Would you take part in any further study? 
• Thank you for your participation, we will keep all of this information confidential and 
now get designing the study. 
• If you would like a copy of the report, let Sathon know and we will send you a 
summary.
