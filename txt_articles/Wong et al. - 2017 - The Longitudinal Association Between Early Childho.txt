Objective: Fathers have increased their involvement in child caregiving; however, their changing role in
childhood obesity is understudied. This study assessed the longitudinal association between changes in
obesity among children aged 2 to 4 years and changes in fathers’ involvement with raising children.
Methods: Longitudinal data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Birth Cohort were used to con-
duct child fixed-effects linear and logistic regression analyses to assess the association between
changes in childhood obesity-related outcomes (sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, screen time,
BMI z score, overweight/obesity, obesity) and fathers’ involvement with raising children (caregiving and
influencing child-related decisions). Fixed-effects models control for all time-invariant characteristics.
Analyses were controlled for time-varying confounders, including child age, maternal and paternal
employment, and family poverty status.
Results: Children whose fathers increased their frequency of taking children outside and involvement
with physical childcare experienced a decrease in their odds of obesity from age 2 to age 4. Obesity-
related outcomes were not associated with fathers’ decision-making influence.
Conclusions: Increases in fathers’ involvement with some aspects of caregiving may be associated with
lower odds of childhood obesity. Encouraging fathers to increase their involvement with raising children and
including fathers in childhood obesity prevention efforts may help reduce obesity risk among young children.

Introduction
Preventing obesity in young children is essential to addressing the
current obesity epidemic (1), and there has been recent progress (2).
Young children with high BMI are more likely to have obesity as
adults (3) and develop obesity-related chronic conditions (4).
Parents strongly influence their child’s weight status during early
childhood. They control and shape their child’s dietary preferences
and activity level (5,6). To date, most of the research on parental
influences on children’s weight has focused on mothers (7). How-
ever, in the past 4 decades, the role of fathers in child caregiving
has increased (8). Caregiving includes the time spent with children
and activities dedicated to caring for children, such as physical
childcare (e.g., grooming the child), supervising the child, and play-
time activities. From 1965 to 2011, fathers increased the time they
spent with children by nearly threefold (9). While they have
increased their involvement in all aspects of caregiving, most of
their time is devoted to playtime (10,11). Despite their increased
role, fathers remain significantly underrepresented in research about
the influence of parents on childhood obesity (7).
Limited available research has primarily focused on fathers’ parent-
ing styles and factors directly related to child nutrition and exercise,
including knowledge of nutrition and physical activity and child
feeding habits (12,13). These studies found that some fathers’

 behaviors, such as lower monitoring of child food intake, were asso-
ciated with higher child BMI (12,13). Additionally, fathers’ nutri-
tional knowledge was not always accurate (12). Fathers’ feeding
behaviors may also differ based on father characteristics such as
education and resident status (14).
Missing from the literature is an examination of the role of fathers in
general child caregiving (not directly related to child nutrition and
exercise) or influence on decision-making in relation to children’s
BMI. For example, by helping to prepare meals, bathing children, or
assisting with child-related decisions, fathers may alleviate maternal
stress, which is associated with increased child BMI (15), and increase
the quality of care provided by both parents. Paternal involvement
may be particularly important for children who have other obesity risk
factors, including living in poverty or maternal employment (16,17).
Fathers with higher levels of education may confer positive health
benefits to their child when they assist with caregiving and decision-
making (18). To our knowledge, no study has considered the relation-
ship between childhood obesity with broader measures of fathers’
involvement, including general caregiving (e.g., looking after the child)
and influence on child-related decisions. Additionally, existing studies
on fathers’ feeding behavior and knowledge were primarily cross-
sectional (13) or qualitative (14) and conducted among fathers from
higher socioeconomic status families (13).
In our study, we examined the longitudinal association between
changes in obesity-related outcomes (sugar-sweetened beverage
[SSB] consumption, screen time, BMI z score, overweight/obesity,
and obesity) and changes in fathers’ involvement with raising chil-
dren, specifically in child caregiving and influence on child-related
decision-making from age 2 to age 4. We also assessed whether
fathers’ education, family poverty status, and maternal employment
modified
these
associations.
We
hypothesized
that
increasing
fathers’ involvement with caregiving and decision-making would be
associated with decreases in obesity-related outcomes. We further
hypothesized that these relationships would be stronger in children
living in poverty, whose mothers were employed, or whose fathers
had higher levels of education.
Methods
Data and study sample
Our analysis used longitudinal data from the Early Childhood Longi-
tudinal Study–Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), which followed a nationally
representative cohort of �10,700 children (all sample sizes have
been rounded to the nearest 50 to comply with ECLS-B’s restricted-
use data reporting guidelines) born in 2001 from birth through first
grade. Sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics,
the ECLS-B was designed to collect information on child, home,
and family influences on the child’s development during the first 6
years of life (19). The ECLS-B administered separate surveys to the
primary caregiver (>95% were biological mothers) and resident
fathers. Resident fathers responded to self-administered question-
naires assessing their involvement with raising the child.
Our study used data collected from children at approximately age 2
and age 4. Our study sample included children whose fathers lived
with them but were not the primary caregivers and who had com-
pleted the resident father survey at both time points. We excluded
children with missing BMI z scores, implausibly large BMI z scores
(<25 or >5 standard deviations [SD]) at either time point, or an
implausibly large change in BMI z score (>5 SD) from age 2 to age
4, as these observations may have unreliable data on BMI. Our final
analytic sample of �3,900 children was comparable to the full sam-
ple of children with resident fathers, with minor differences in child
and father race/ethnicity, family poverty, and father educational
attainment. Supporting Information Table S1 shows the sample sizes
at each exclusion step.
Study measures
Dependent
variables.
Study
outcomes
included
children’s
obesity-related behaviors and weight status. Measures of obesity-
related behaviors included daily screen time hours during week-
days from television or videos and SSB consumption (regular vs.
infrequent/never). Regular SSB consumption at age 2 was defined
as usually consuming SSBs with either meals or snacks and at age
4 as drinking � 1 SSB per day. Soda, < 100% fruit drinks, and
sports drinks were considered SSBs. Because measures of SSB
consumption changed from age 2 to age 4, we dichotomized this
measure using a classification of regular SSB consumption used in
previous research on SSB consumption among young children
(20).
For weight status, we separately modeled a continuous measure of
BMI z score and indicators of overweight or obesity status (over-
weight/obesity vs. no overweight/obesity) and obesity status (obesity
vs. no obesity). Trained ECLS-B staff measured child height and
weight. We calculated a child’s z score from BMI (weight divided
by recumbent length or standing height squared) using sex-specific
BMI-for-age World Health Organization (WHO) child growth stand-
ards, which are appropriate for children from birth to age 5 (21).
We defined overweight/obesity and obesity as being > 2 and > 3 SD
above the WHO growth standard mean for all children, respectively
(22).
Main independent variables.
Our independent variables of inter-
est were fathers’ involvement in two domains: child caregiving and
child-related decision-making. Measures of fathers’ involvement in
caregiving included how often, in the past month, fathers (1) prepared
meals for their child; (2) took their child outside for walks or play in
the yard, a park, or playground; (3) looked after their child while the
mother did other things; and (4) performed physical childcare tasks.
Frequency for meal preparation and taking children outside responses
included rarely/never, a few times a month, a few times a week,
about once a day, and more than once a day. Frequency of looking
after the child responses included never, once or twice, a few times a
month, a few times a week, and every day or almost every day. Phys-
ical childcare was assessed through a combined measure, ranging
from 0 to 4, of the following tasks performed on at least a daily basis
(i.e., once a day or more than once a day): helping children go to
bed, brush teeth, get dressed, and bathe.
Our second set of independent variables assessed fathers’ influence
on decisions about the child’s nutrition, health care, discipline, and
childcare. Responses included no, some, and a great deal of influ-
ence. Decision measures were assessed in separate models.
Although frequency response categories were ordinal, we modeled
both sets of independent variables as continuous measures to

 maintain sample size and increase power in our analysis. Fixed-
effects models typically have reduced power because they rely
entirely on within-unit changes. By modeling independent variables
as continuous measures, we assumed that one-category changes pro-
duced the same effect for all response categories. We checked this
assumption by examining residuals from linear outcome models to
check for violations of functional form and by comparing one-
category changes for different response categories on dichotomous
outcomes, and we found our assumptions to be reasonable.

 employed vs. employed), and baseline family poverty status at
child’s age 2 (< 100% federal poverty line [FPL] vs. �100% FPL)
as potential effect modifiers (10,23-25).
We controlled for potential time-varying confounders, including
child age (continuous, months), father employment (continuous,
hours/week), mother employment (continuous, hours/week), and
poverty status (< 100% FPL or � 100% FPL) at each time point.
We did not need to explicitly control for time-invariant confounders
(e.g., child gender) in our analysis, because fixed-effects models
control for all observed and unobserved characteristics that do not
change over time (described below).
Statistical analysis
We calculated descriptive statistics on all key sample characteristics
at both time points. We then used child fixed-effects linear and
logistic regression models to assess the relationship between changes
in obesity-related behaviors and weight status with changes in
fathers’ caregiving and decision-making from child age 2 to age 4,
controlling for time-varying characteristics described above. Similar
to a pre-post test, these fixed-effects models compared children to
themselves over time between the two time points (26). Fixed-
effects models estimate within-unit (in this case, child) effects; the
two-period case with continuous outcomes is equivalent to a first
difference model. For each outcome, we ran separate models for
each of the caregiving and decision-making measures while control-
ling for specified time-varying confounders.
To test whether baseline fathers’ education, baseline maternal
employment, and baseline poverty status modified these associa-
tions, we also ran separate fixed-effects models for each potential
modifier that included an interaction term between the modifier and
the fathers’ caregiving or decision-making variable. We considered
the interaction statistically significant if the interaction term had a
P < 0.05. Then we estimated the association between changes in
childhood obesity behaviors and outcomes with changes in fathers’
caregiving and decision-making, stratified by each modifier. For all
descriptive and statistical analyses, we used the ECLS-B–provided
survey weights, strata, and variance for the resident father survey at
age 4, adjusted to account for survey nonresponse during the age 2
survey. Statistical analyses were performed in Stata/IC 14, 1 (Stata-
Corp, College Station, Texas).
This secondary analysis of the restricted-use ECLS-B data was
determined to be non–human subject research by the Johns Hopkins
Institutional Review Board.
Results
The weighted sample represents 2,608,286 children in the United
States. Survey-weighted sample characteristics are presented in
Table 1. More than half of the children (64%) and fathers (67%)
were non-Hispanic white. Families living below the poverty line
increased slightly from child age 2 to age 4 (14% to 15%). Fifty-six
percent of fathers had more than a high school degree. On average,
mothers worked part time (18 h/wk at child age 2; 19 h/wk at child
age 4), while fathers worked full-time (46 h/wk at child age 2 and
age 4).
Mean BMI z scores decreased from 1.1 (SD: 1.2) to 0.7 (SD: 1.1),
the proportion of children with overweight decreased from 13.7% to
7.6%, and the proportion of children with obesity decreased from
6.4% to 4.4% from age 2 to age 4 (Table 1). From age 2 to age 4,
screen time was similar (2.3 h to 2.1 h), while regular SSB con-
sumption increased (7.7% to 24.4%).
Table 2 shows the proportion of fathers who changed their involve-
ment in caregiving and influence on decision-making. For each care-
giving task, more than 20% of fathers increased their involvement
from age 2 to age 4. The proportion of fathers who increased their
influence on child-related decisions ranged from 15% for discipline
to 40% for nutrition.

 Involvement with caregiving
Table 3 presents results from our adjusted fixed-effects models. We
found that increases in fathers’ caregiving were associated with
decreases in childhood obesity. A one-category increase in the fre-
quency that fathers took the child out for walks or play was associ-
ated with a 30% decrease in the odds of childhood obesity (odds
ratio [OR] 5 0.70, 95% CI: 0.5-0.97). Each additional physical care-
giving task performed by fathers on a daily basis was associated
with a 33% decrease in the odds of childhood obesity (OR 5 0.67,
95% CI: 0.52-0.88). Although not statistically significant, we also
observed similar relationships between decreases in the odds of
childhood obesity with increases in the frequency of fathers’
involvement with meal preparation (OR 5 0.73, 95% CI: 0.51-1.03)
and looking after the child (OR 5 0.75, 95% CI: 0.55-1.03). These
relationships approached significance at P < 0.1. Fathers’ caregiving
was not associated with other obesity-related outcomes.
Influence on decision-making
Fathers’ influence on decision-making was not associated with child-
hood obesity behaviors or weight status outcomes. However, each
level
increase
of
fathers’
influence
on
childcare
decisions
approached statistical significance with decreases in odds of regular
SSB consumption (OR 5 0.74, 95% CI: 0.52-1.06) and obesity
(OR 5 0.56, 95% CI: 0.29-1.09).
Effect modifiers
We also examined whether these associations varied by baseline
fathers’ education, baseline family poverty status, and baseline
maternal employment (Supporting Information Tables S2-S7). The
tests of whether each of these variables modified the associations
between each childhood obesity-related outcome and each measure
of fathers’ involvement with caregiving and decision-making indi-
cated that, generally, these relationships were not modified by any
of these variables. However, there were a few exceptions. Increases
in the frequency that fathers took their children outside to walk or
play were associated with decreases in the child’s BMI z score
(20.07, 95% CI: 20.13 to 20.01) among children above the FPL
but not among children below the FPL (0.10, 95% CI: 20.07 to
0.27) (interaction P 5 0.048). Among children with more educated
fathers, an increase in fathers’ physical caregiving participation was
associated with an increase in the odds of regular SSB consumption
(OR 5 1.39, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.76) but not among children with less
educated fathers (OR 5 0.93, 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.16) (interaction
P 5 0.013). Conversely, increases in fathers’ physical caregiving
tasks were associated with decreases in the odds of obesity among
children with less educated fathers (OR 5 0.58, 95% CI: 0.41 to
0.80) but not among more educated fathers (OR 5 0.93, 95% CI:
0.64 to 1.36) (interaction P 5 0.043). The significant relationship
between child obesity and fathers’ physical childcare in the pooled
analyses may be primarily driven by less educated fathers. None of
the relationships varied by baseline maternal employment.
Discussion
This study used a nationally representative sample of children to
examine the longitudinal association between changes in early child-
hood obesity-related outcomes and changes in fathers’ involvement
with raising children. Comparing children to themselves over time
allowed us to control for all potential time-invariant variables,
including
unobserved
confounding
variables
that
may
not
be
accounted for in cross-sectional studies. We found that for children
living in two-parent, heterosexual households, increases in fathers’
caregiving were associated with decreases in a child’s odds of obe-
sity from age 2 to age 4.
There is strong consensus on the importance of fathers’ involvement
during early childhood for child social, behavioral, and cognitive
development (27-30). Our study suggests that fathers’ involvement
with child caregiving in some domains may have child health benefits
related to obesity risk. We found that increases in fathers’ participa-
tion in physical childcare (e.g., bathing and dressing children) and the
frequency of taking their child outside for a walk or to play were
associated with decreases in the odds of childhood obesity from age 2
to age 4. Prior research has found that, compared to mothers, fathers
devote more of their caregiving time to playtime activities than to
physical childcare (10). However, in recent years, fathers have
become
more
involved
with
physical
childcare,
although
still
unequally to mothers (11). Their increased involvement with physical
childcare may potentially provide additional support to the mother
and augment the time and quality of care provided to children (31).
Because fathers devote more caregiving to playtime, they may have a
compensatory role of taking children outside for a walk or to play
when mothers, who typically shoulder the majority of caregiving
(11), do not have sufficient time or energy to do so. Fathers may also
play a unique role by engaging in more active, “roughhouse” play-
time (32), resulting in children being more physically active when
fathers take children outside than when mothers do.
However, many expected associations between obesity-related out-
comes and fathers’ caregiving were not observed. Early childhood
obesity was not associated with paternal involvement with meal
preparation or looking after the child. Childhood obesity prevention
efforts, including healthy cooking interventions, typically focus on
mothers (33,34). As a result, fathers might be less knowledgeable in
supporting a healthy lifestyle for their child. Compared to mothers,
they may prepare less nutritious meals and allow permissive snack-
ing habits or screen time when looking after their child.
Fathers’ caregiving was not associated with other weight status out-
comes. This might potentially be due to a nonlinear relationship
between BMI z scores and fathers’ involvement, such that fathers’
involvement might be most important for young children with obe-
sity or at risk of developing obesity. Our significant findings for
decreased odds of childhood obesity are still important, because
developing obesity during this developmentally important period
poses substantial health risks in later life (35).
We did not find associations between obesity-related behavioral out-
comes and father caregiving involvement. However, changes in
fathers’ caregiving might influence other obesity-related behaviors
not assessed in this study, such as physical activity. Future studies
should examine other obesity-related behavioral outcomes.
Few studies have considered the role of fathers’ influence on child-
related decision-making, as mothers often manage child caregiving
(10). Our study did not find any relationship between fathers’ influ-
ence on decision-making with childhood obesity-related outcomes at
age 4. However, our null findings may be due to fathers both posi-
tively
and
negatively
influencing
child-related
decisions.

 example, fathers may encourage physical activity in children through
more active play (32) but also allow more permissive feeding (13).
More research is needed to explore the complex role of fathers in
child-related decision-making and its potential impact on childhood
obesity.
We also explored whether family poverty, father education, and
maternal employment modified the relationship between childhood
obesity outcomes with fathers’ caregiving and decision-making. We
found few significant interactions, which might point to the general
benefits of fathers’ involvement in maintaining a healthy weight for
children regardless of family poverty, father education, and maternal
employment. Clear patterns did not emerge among the few signifi-
cant interactions.
Our study had several limitations. First, due to the lack of precision
in the measures of fathers’ involvement with caregiving and influ-
ence on decision-making, and the challenges of modeling categorical
exposures in fixed-effects models, we modeled these measures as
continuous variables despite the fact that they had ordinal response
categories. Our robustness checks, including an examination of
residuals to check for violations of functional form and a compari-
son of whether one-category changes were similar for all categories,
suggest that this is a reasonable approach. Fixed-effects analysis
models the relationship of changing into a response category; thus,
coefficients for the middle categories include both individuals who
increased and decreased into that category and become inappropriate
for this assessment. This prevented us from making meaningful
inferences about specific changes in the odds of obesity associated
with each unit change in fathers’ involvement or influence. How-
ever, our goal was to understand the direction of the relationship
between child obesity outcomes and fathers’ involvement and influ-
ence more generally. The underlying data provided in these ques-
tions are adequate for this purpose.
We did not have external validation of father-reported involvement
with caregiving and influence on decision-making. Studies have
found that fathers’ self-reports overestimate (36) or agree with moth-
ers’ reports (37). While fixed-effects models account for all time-
invariant maternal characteristics, there may be important time-
varying confounders that we omitted, such as maternal and nonpar-
ental (e.g., grandparent) involvement in raising children. We could
not control for maternal involvement in raising children because this
was not assessed in the ECLS-B. Because fixed-effects models are
powered by changes in the outcome measures, we may have been
underpowered to detect significant interactions. Screen time might
be underreported because it was based specifically on television and
video. This study was conducted in a cohort of children born in
2001, but recent changes to family dynamics might limit generaliz-
ability to children born more recently. Finally, we limited our sam-
ple to two-parent heterosexual families, so results may not be gener-
alizable to other family structures.
Conclusion
Although fathers are participating more in child caregiving, the
effects of their increased involvement on childhood obesity have
been understudied. Using models that controlled for all observed
and unobserved time-invariant confounders, we found evidence that
increases in fathers’ involvement in caregiving are associated with
lower odds of early childhood obesity. Findings from this study sug-
gest that children may benefit from additional involvement from
fathers. Efforts to increase fathers’ involvement might include
actively including fathers in parenting childhood obesity interven-
tions and child health care providers actively engaging with fathers
during their child’s health care visits. To date, parenting childhood
obesity interventions primarily target mothers (34). Fathers have
noted feeling neglected during visits with their child’s pediatricians
(38). Future studies can utilize more precise information on both
mothers’ and fathers’ caregiving involvement and influence, such as
time-use data, to allow for more definitive estimates of these rela-
tionships and more detail on fathers’ involvement (e.g., what they
do when outside with their child). Information on maternal involve-
ment can also help elucidate pathways through which fathers’
involvement and influence might confer child weight benefits.O
