Abstract
Background: Test the hypothesis that exposure to fine particulate matter in the air (PM2.5) is associated with increased
risk of preterm birth (PTB).
Methods: Geo-spatial population-based cohort study using live birth records from Ohio (2007–2010) linked to average
daily measures of PM2.5, recorded by 57 EPA network monitoring stations across the state. Geographic coordinates of
the home residence for births were linked to the nearest monitoring station using ArcGIS. Association between PTB
and high PM2.5 levels (above the EPA annual standard of 15 μg/m3) was estimated using GEE, with adjustment for age,
race, education, parity, insurance, tobacco, birth season and year, and infant gender. An exchangeable correlation
matrix for the monitor stations was used in the models. Analyses were limited to non-anomalous singleton births at
20-42weeks with no known chromosome abnormality occurring within 10 km of a monitor station.
Results: The frequency of PTB was 8.5 % in the study cohort of 224,921 singleton live births. High PM2.5 exposure
(>EPA recommended maximum) occurred frequently during the study period, with 24,662 women (11 %) having high
exposure in all three trimesters. Pregnancies with high PM2.5 exposure through pregnancy had increased PTB risk even
after adjustment for coexisting risk factors, adjOR 1.19 (95 % CI 1.09–1.30). Assessed per trimester, high 3rd trimester
PM2.5 exposure resulted in the highest PTB risk, adjOR 1.28 (95 % CI 1.20–1.37).
Conclusions: Exposure to high levels of particulate air pollution, PM2.5, in pregnancy is associated with a 19 % increased
risk of PTB; with greatest risk with high 3rd trimester exposure. Although the risk increase associated with high PM2.5
levels is modest, the potential impact on overall PTB rates is robust as all pregnant women are potentially at risk. This
exposure may in part contribute to the higher preterm birth rates in Ohio compared to other states in the US, especially
in urban areas.

 Background
Since the industrial revolution, it has become increas-
ingly evident that environmental toxicants contribute to
human disease. Air pollution is associated with several
acute and chronic cardiopulmonary diseases. Particulate
air pollution, in particular, has been found to be harmful
in numerous studies, and was 9th leading risk factor in
the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study [1]. Particulate
air pollution is a heterogeneous group of airborne matter
that ranges in size from a few hundredths of a microm-
eter to visible particles up to 100 μm. Combustion is the
main source of harmful particulate matter (PM). Fine
particulate matter (PM2.5, referring to the upper limit of
this fraction being 2.5 μm) has received much research
and regulatory attention. As opposed to ultrafine parti-
cles – which are stable for only a short period of time,
and coarse particles – whose travel is generally limited
by the large size of the particles, PM2.5 can be both
stable for long periods of time and are small enough to
be distributed far from their source. PM2.5 comprises
particles composed of hydrocarbons, organic compounds,
ultrafine particle aggregates, biologic endotoxins, metals,
and ions. Short-term exposure to PM2.5 can cause prema-
ture death, especially from cardiac and pulmonary disease.
Long-term exposure to PM2.5 can also cause premature
death from cardiac and pulmonary disease, but can also
reduce lung development and lead to chronic respiratory
diseases in children [2]. The EPA does monitor and set
regulations for safe PM2.5 levels (www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/).
The connections between maternal toxin exposures
and adverse birth outcomes is an emerging field of study
that has begun to show that environmental toxicants are
likely to be associated with some poor birth outcomes
including stillbirth, low birthweight, some congenital
anomalies, and preterm birth [3].
Several prior studies have reported the association be-
tween air pollutants and preterm birth, but report incon-
sistent findings of the association between preterm birth
and increased PM2.5 levels [4–13]. Previous studies have
been limited in design by exposures with measures at a
single time point or with a lack of thorough adjustment
for important clinical or socio-demographic risk factors.
In this study we aim to integrate air quality measures
from statewide monitoring stations with vital records to
perform geospatial analyses testing the hypothesis that
exposure to fine particles in the air (PM2.5) is associated
with preterm birth risk.
Methods
The Ohio Department of Health and Human Subjects
Institutional Review Board approved a protocol for this
study. This study was exempt from review by the
Institutional Review Board at the University of Cincinnati,
Cincinnati, Ohio. A data set generated from vital records
of all live births that occurred in the state from 2007–2010
was provided for this analysis by the Ohio Department of
Health, n = 597,000.
This is a geo-spatial population-based cohort study.
The primary exposure was high level of airborne PM2.5,
fine particulate matter in the air measuring <2.5 μm in
diameter. Trimester-specific and total pregnancy average
daily PM2.5 levels were categorized as high exposure if
the average over the specified time period was greater
than 15 μg/m3, which was the EPA annual standard
during the period of study. A secondary analysis was
then performed modeling PM2.5 levels as a continuous
variable. The primary outcome was preterm birth was
defined as delivery prior to 37 completed weeks of gesta-
tion. Gestational age was defined by the best obstetric
estimate variable in the birth record, which combines
last menstrual period and ultrasound parameters, as is
commonly accepted in clinical practice for gestational
age estimation. Analyses were limited to non-anomalous
singleton live births.
Daily measures of PM2.5, recorded by 57 monitoring
stations across the state of Ohio, were obtained from the
Environmental Protection Agency from 2007–2010 and
monthly averages were calculated for each station [14].
Maternal address at time of birth was geocoded and
distance to the nearest EPA monitoring station was
calculated using ArcGIS 10.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA)
software. Births at gestational ages 20 to 42 weeks
with a maternal home address within 10 km of an
EPA PM2.5 monitoring station were included in this
analysis (n = 224,921, Fig. 1). Average monthly PM2.5
levels from the nearest EPA station were linked to the
birth record data. Average PM2.5 levels for each trimester
and an average for the entire pregnancy were calculated
for each birth included in this analysis.
Demographic, medical and delivery characteristics of
preterm live births (<37 weeks) were compared to term
live births (37–42 weeks) using t-test for continuous
variable comparisons and χ2 tests for categorical vari-
ables. The association between preterm birth and high
PM2.5
exposure
was
estimated
using
generalized
estimating equations (GEE), with adjustment for the
confounding influences of age, race, education, parity,
insurance, tobacco, birth season and year, and infant
sex. Odds ratios for high PM2.5 exposure during the
first, second, and third trimester as well as high
exposure averaged over the entire pregnancy were
estimated from separate models with adjustment for
all factors listed above. Covariates include in the
models were chosen based on significant differences
noted among bivariate comparisons, biologic plausibil-
ity, and parsimony within the model.
An exchangeable correlation matrix for the monitoring
stations was used in the GEE models to account for

 spatial correlation within the same PM2.5 monitor.
Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3, SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA. Comparisons with a prob-
ability value <0.05 or 95 % confidence interval without
inclusion of the null were considered statistically signifi-
cant. Population attributable risk percentage (PAR%) was
calculated as: PAR% = 100 × Pe (RR - 1)/(Pe(RR-1) + 1),
where Pe is percentage of high exposure in the entire
population (approximately 10 % for the population in-
cluded in this study) and RR is relative risk. Odds ratios
approximate the relative risk in studies with an outcome
rate of less than 10 %, as in this study. Therefore we uti-
lized estimated odds ratios in lieu of relative risk in the
PAR calculation. The PAR calculation inherently assumes
a causal relationship, which is yet unproven in the associ-
ation of particulate matter and preterm birth. With this in
mind, we provide this calculation in effort to estimate the
potential contribution of high PM2.5 exposure to preterm
birth on a population level.
Results
The study population included 224,921 singleton non-
anomalous
live
births:
19,027
preterm
births
and
205,894 term births, Fig. 1. The preterm rate decreased
during the study period, from 8.6 % in 2007 to 8.2 % in
2010, Table 1. Most births analyzed (97 %) occurred in
very urban areas, where most monitoring stations are
located and exposure levels are likely to be highest. Pre-
term birth rates were higher among the oldest mothers,
age ≥40 years, 10.9 %, and non-Hispanic black mothers,
11.2 %, as well as women with lower education level and
tobacco use. Women with no prenatal care had the high-
est rate of singleton preterm birth, 19.8 %. Season of
conception had no influence on preterm birth rate.
The locations of PM2.5 monitor stations in Ohio and
preterm births during the study period are demonstrated
in Fig. 2. The mean PM2.5 level during the study period
(2007–2010) in Ohio was 13.03 μg/m3 [±1.57 μg/m3,
IQR (Q1: 11.84, Q3: 14.13, IQR: 2.3)], which is higher
than the current US EPA National Ambient Air Quality
Standard (NAAQS) of 12 μg/m3. Mean PM2.5 level, IQR
for the entire cohort per trimester was: 1st trimester
13.19, 2.36 μg/m3; 2nd trimester 12.98, 2.08 μg/m3; 3rd
trimester 12.93, 2.30 μg/m3.
The frequency of high exposure to PM2.5 greater than
the EPA standard of 15 μg/m3 ranged from 17 to 20 %
for each trimester of pregnancy, and 11 % of parturients
had high exposure throughout pregnancy in all three
trimesters. The frequency of high PM2.5 exposure was
higher in preterm births compared to term births, see
Table 2. The preterm birth rate was also increased with
high PM2.5 exposure during the first and third trimester,
and when there was high PM2.5 exposure averaged over
the entire pregnancy, as demonstrated in Table 3.

 Likewise, the mean PM2.5 levels during each trimester
when compared between term and preterm pregnan-
cies demonstrated significantly higher average PM2.5
levels during the first and third trimester for the pre-
term birth group compared to term births, p = 0.01
(data not displayed in table). Likewise, the overall
pregnancy average PM2.5 levels were higher for the
preterm birth group compared to the term birth
group, p < 0.01.
Logistic regression models were constructed to identify
factors associated with preterm birth. Factors with
significant
associations
included
maternal
age > 35,
non-Hispanic
black
race,
Hispanic
ethnicity,
high
school education or less, no prenatal care, tobacco
use, high PM2.5 exposure during the third trimester,
and high PM2.5 exposure over the entire pregnancy
(Table 4 and Fig. 3). High PM2.5 levels > 15 μg/m3
during the third trimester or high when averaged over
the entire pregnancy were associated with an increased
risk of preterm birth <37 weeks of gestation, adjOR 1.28
(CI 1.20, 1.37) and adjOR 1.19 (CI 1.09, 1.30), respectively
(Table 4). When PM2.5 exposure was modeled as a
continuous variable in a secondary analysis, no significant
association between exposure and preterm birth was

The attributable risk of preterm birth related to
high PM2.5 exposure > 15 μg/m3 was 0.0172 (95 % CI
0.0135 – 0.0208). The attributable risk percent: (Ie-Iu)/Ie
is 17.18 (13.49 – 20.86) %, i.e. for the exposed population,
17.18 % of preterm births were from high PM2.5 exposure.
In our study sample in which 10.96 % of the population
was exposed to high PM2.5, the population attributable
risk percentage of high PM2.5 exposure was 2.22 % for
preterm birth.
Discussion
Our study adds to the growing body of evidence that
particulate matter in the air is deleterious to human
health. In our study sample, exposure to high levels of
PM2.5 > 15
μg/m3
was
significantly
associated
with
preterm birth – both when high exposure occurred on
average over the course of pregnancy and with high ex-
posure limited to just the third trimester. Our calculated
attributable risk percent estimates that decreasing PM2.5
levels below this EPA standard threshold could theoret-
ically decrease preterm birth by 17.18 % in the exposed
group, corresponding to a 2.22 % decrease in preterm
birth rate in the population.

 An association between air pollution and preterm
birth was first suggested in an analysis of the Nashville
Air Pollution Study that showed increased risk of death
in preterm infants whose mothers were likely to be
exposed with high levels of particulate pollution [15].
Subsequent
studies
have
further
explored
the
link
between preterm birth and other air pollutants using
measurements of a variety of pollutants (TSP, SO2, NOx,
CO, and PM10) in proximity to maternal residence, mea-
sured by stationary or remote sensing satellite monitors.
These studies demonstrated mixed results with regard to
associations with preterm birth and timing of high expos-
ure periods during the pregnancy [16–21].
Prior studies that have attempted to link preterm birth
specifically to PM2.5 have also reported varied results.
Gray et al. did not find significant effects in a study
using EPA modeled data in North Carolina [6]. In a
multi-country study, Fleisher found significant differ-
ences in preterm birth only in China when comparing
areas with very high average PM2.5 levels (>36.5 μg/m3)
compared to low levels (<12.5 μg/m3) [22]. Recent stud-
ies using satellite measurements have also been mixed:
Rudra [23] found no effect, Gehring [5] found a non-
significant trend toward increased risk of preterm birth
with increased PM2.5 exposure, while Lee (2013) found
high first trimester exposure was associated with mod-
estly increased risk (OR 1.10 [1.01–1.20]) [24]. Jalaludin
found that high PM2.5 levels associated only with risk of
preterm birth in pregnancies conceived in the winter
(OR 1.426) [25]. Kloog found an increased risk of
prematurity using a model that incorporated measured
and estimated exposure values (OR 1.06 (1.01–1.13) per
10 μg/m3 increase in third trimester) [9]. A recent meta-
analysis combining previous studies found a modestly
increased risk of preterm birth for each 10 μg/m3
increase in PM2.5 (OR 1.10 [1.03–1.18]); however, they

 did not find evidence of increased risk in trimester
specific exposures, as we identified in this study [26].
The PM2.5 concentration threshold at which health is
harmed is not well defined. We used the cutoff of 15 μg/m3
average to define high exposure as this was the EPA
National Ambient Air Quality standard for annual mean
levels of PM2.5 during the time period of the study. The
standard was reduced to 12 μg/m3 in 2012, after the EPA
determined that the threshold level for harm may be in the
13–14 μg/m3 range [27]. We used the cutoff of 15 μg/m3 in
these analyses because it may be more representative of ex-
posure levels in relation to the EPA standard in our region
during the time period of study. Using this threshold to de-
fine high exposure, we identified significant associations
with preterm birth risk. However, when PM2.5 exposure
was modeled as a continuous variable, no risk increase for
preterm birth was identified. This may suggest a threshold
effect in which a critical level of exposure is necessary
before harmful health effects are seen.
There are multiple mechanisms by which particulate
matter may lead to deleterious health effects. Three
broad pathways exist that may explain how air pollution
may affect organs outside of the lung: 1) Toxic sub-
stances may enter the blood via the lungs and be carried
throughout the circulation. 2) There may be a systemic
oxidative stress and inflammatory response that is either
triggered in the lungs, or by substances once they gain
access to the general circulation. 3) Toxicants may
disrupt the autonomic nervous system causing imbal-
ance of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. There
is evidence of the importance for each of these pathways
at the cellular and molecular level in non-pregnant
humans, especially related to cardiovascular events [28].
It is plausible that any or all of these mechanisms may
contribute to alterations in uteroplacental perfusion,
nutrient and oxygen transfer to the fetus, or stimulate
the inflammatory response that commonly precedes the
onset of preterm parturition.
There are a number of methodological limitations of
our study, which are common to studies examining
exposure to ambient air pollution and birth outcomes:
1) Specific pollutants and their ambient concentrations
not considered independently but rather grouped as
PM2.5. 2) Individual level exposure not quantified by
personal
sampling.
Quantification
of
an
individual’s
exposure
is
imprecise
without
either
a
completely
controlled environment or portable sampling equip-
ment – both of which are not practical for population
cohort studies. 3) It is not known when the critical
time for exposure is for specific outcomes. 4) Birth
certificate data may not adequately describe poten-
tially confounding socioeconomic or medical informa-
tion. Regarding exposure quantification, there is likely
some degree of sampling bias as EPA measurement
stations are not randomly placed. Rather, monitoring
sites are intended to capture ambient air levels and
may be strategically placed to avoid major industrial
sources of air, which could contribute to selection,
and information bias. This misclassification could bias
the results toward the null, and contribute to the lack
of significant association identified when exposure
was modeled in quartiles or as a continuous variable.
Additionally, categorizing third trimester exposure as
high levels occurring after 28 weeks would not ac-
count for early preterm births that occur prior to the
third
trimester.
Despite
statistical
adjustment
for
available socioeconomic factors, unidentified socioeco-
nomic
factors
or
co-existent
environmental
risk
factors may confound the interpretation of results in
our study or similar studies. More populated areas
tend to have higher proportions of patients with
socioeconomic risk factors for preterm birth. Likely
the
best
way
to
truly
determine
the
connection
between air pollution and preterm birth would be to
have subjects carry continuous pollutant monitoring
systems. This would allow more precise assessment of the
threshold of risk and would allow us to further define
behaviors associated with high pollutant exposure.
Conclusions
Our data suggest that women exposed to higher than
the EPA standard exposure level of PM2.5 over the
course of pregnancy are at increased risk for preterm
birth. Based on trimester-specific high exposure periods,
high exposure during the third trimester of pregnancy
are also significantly associated with increased preterm
birth risk. While this study does not precisely define a
safe threshold for exposure, it does support the EPA’s de-
cision to decrease the standard exposure limit of PM2.5
concentration for individuals in the US. Additional
research is needed to determine individual-level exposure
as measured by ambient air and internal biomarkers of
exposure and effect.
