Abstract
Background—Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is an eosinophilic vasculitis. 
Mepolizumab, an anti–interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody, reduces blood eosinophil counts and 
may have value in the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
Methods—In this multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 
participants with relapsing or refractory eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis who had 
received treatment for at least 4 weeks and were taking a stable prednisolone or prednisone dose to 
receive 300 mg of mepolizumab or placebo, administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks, plus 
standard care, for 52 weeks. The two primary end points were the accrued weeks of remission over 
a 52-week period, according to categorical quantification, and the proportion of participants in 
remission at both week 36 and week 48. Secondary end points included the time to first relapse 
and the average daily glucocorticoid dose (during weeks 48 through 52). The annualized relapse 
rate and safety were assessed.
Results—A total of 136 participants underwent randomization, with 68 participants assigned to 
receive mepolizumab and 68 to receive placebo. Mepolizumab treatment led to significantly more 
accrued weeks of remission than placebo (28% vs. 3% of the participants had ≥ 24 weeks of 
accrued remission; odds ratio, 5.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.68 to 13.03; P<0.001) and a 
higher percentage of participants in remission at both week 36 and week 48 (32% vs. 3%; odds 
ratio, 16.74; 95% CI, 3.61 to 77.56; P<0.001). Remission did not occur in 47% of the participants 
in the mepolizumab group versus 81% of those in the placebo group. The annualized relapse rate 
was 1.14 in the mepolizumab group, as compared with 2.27 in the placebo group (rate ratio, 0.50; 
95% CI, 0.36 to 0.70; P<0.001). A total of 44% of the participants in the mepolizumab group, as 
compared with 7% of those in the placebo group, had an average daily dose of prednisolone or 
prednisone of 4.0 mg or less per day during weeks 48 through 52 (odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.09 
to 0.41; P<0.001). The safety profile of mepolizumab was similar to that observed in previous 
studies.

 Conclusions—In participants with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, mepolizumab 
resulted in significantly more weeks in remission and a higher proportion of participants in 
remission than did placebo, thus allowing for reduced glucocorticoid use. Even so, only 
approximately half the participants treated with mepolizumab had protocol-defined remission.

ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02020889.)
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as the Churg– Strauss 
syndrome) is characterized by asthma, sinusitis, pulmonary infiltrates, neuropathy, and 
eosinophilic vasculitis of one or more end-organs.1-4 Eosinophils are thought to induce 
pathogenic effects in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis by means 
of tissue and vascular infiltration and inflammation through a variety of mediators.5,6
Although systemic glucocorticoids form the cornerstone of treatment for eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis,7-9 most patients remain dependent on glucocorticoid 
therapy, and relapses are common.10-13 Furthermore, some patients do not have a sufficient 
response to glucocorticoids. Because recurrent relapses place the patient at risk for 
permanent tissue or organ damage, immunosuppressive agents are used for the induction and 
maintenance of remission in patients with relapsing or refractory eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis, despite a paucity of evidence supporting their efficacy in 
this context.8 Given the side effects that are associated with lengthy and high-dose use of 
glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents,14,15 there is a need for additional, more 
effective therapies.
The cytokine interleukin-5 regulates eosinophil proliferation, maturation, and differentiation 
and is present at increased levels in patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis.16 The neutralization of interleukin-5 offers a potential therapeutic option for 
patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Mepolizumab 
(GlaxoSmithKline) is an anti–interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin-5 
and prevents its interaction with its receptor on the eosinophil surface. Mepolizumab 
treatment has resulted in a consistent reduction in the absolute eosinophil count, with 
concomitant clinical improvement in patients with other eosinophilic disorders, such as 
severe eosinophilic asthma.17-21 Preliminary studies have shown proof-of-concept evidence 
of the efficacy of interleukin-5 blockade in the treatment of patients with eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with poly-angiitis.22-24 The objective of this trial was to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of mepolizumab versus placebo as add-on therapy in participants with 
relapsing or refractory eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis over a period of 52 
weeks.
Methods
Trial Design
We conducted this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 
trial at 31 academic centers and hospitals across nine countries (see the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The trial was a 
collaboration between Glaxo-SmithKline and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious

 Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health. NIAID funded an investigator-initiated 
clinical-trial application, through which five of eight clinical sites in the United States were 
supported for participation in this trial. Information regarding the authors' contribution 
(including the contribution of authors who are employees of GlaxoSmithKline) to the trial 
design, data collection and analysis, and manuscript development is provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix. All the authors had access to the data and vouch for the accuracy 
and integrity of the data and analyses. Editorial support (including assistance with 
developing the initial draft of the manuscript, assembling tables and figures, collating 
authors' comments, grammatical editing, and referencing) was provided by Fishawack 
Indicia, funded by GlaxoSmithKline. The trial protocol is available at NEJM.org.
After screening (which lasted 1 to 4 weeks), participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 
ratio to receive subcutaneous mepolizumab at a dose of 300 mg or matching placebo every 4 
weeks, in addition to standard care (glucocorticoid treatment, with or without 
immunosuppressive therapy), for 52 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of follow-up (Fig. 1A, and 
Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The glucocorticoid dose had to remain stable 
between baseline (randomization, which occurred at visit 2) and week 4 and could thereafter 
be reduced at the investigator's discretion according to a standardized recommended tapering 
schedule. Participants who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy were required to be 
taking a stable dose before baseline and for the duration of the trial.
Randomization was performed with the use of a centralized computer–generated, permuted-
block schedule, stratified according to three subgroups: participation in a mechanistic–
biomarker substudy in the United States, recruitment in Japan, and the remainder of 
recruited participants. Mepolizumab and placebo were prepared by staff members who were 
aware of the trial-group assignments but were not involved in the trial assessments. The 
mepolizumab and placebo preparations were identical in appearance and were administered 
in a blinded fashion. Clinicians who were treating and evaluating participants were unaware 
of the preparation of the trial agents, the trial-group assignments, and the white-cell counts 
and white-cell differential counts for the duration of the trial.
The trial was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki, the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, 
and the applicable country-specific regulatory requirements. All the participants provided 
written informed consent.
Participants
Enrolled participants were at least 18 years of age, had received a diagnosis of relapsing or 
refractory eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis at least 6 months previously, and 
had been taking a stable dose of prednisolone or prednisone (≥7.5 to ≤50.0 mg per day, with 
or without additional immunosuppressive therapy) for at least 4 weeks before the baseline 
visit.25 Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis was defined as a history or presence of 
asthma, a blood eosinophil level of 10% or an absolute eosinophil count of more than 1000 
cells per cubic millimeter, and the presence of two or more criteria that are typical of 
eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (histo-pathological evidence of eosinophilic 
vasculitis, perivascular eosinophilic infiltration, or eosinophil-rich granulomatous

 inflammation; neuropathy; pulmonary infiltrates; sinonasal abnormality; cardiomyopathy; 
glomerulonephritis; alveolar hemorrhage; palpable purpura; or antineutrophil cytoplasmic 
antibody [ANCA] positivity, assessed at the Covance laboratory and Q2 Solutions). 
Participants who had granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis at 
screening were excluded, as were those who had organ-threatening or life-threatening 
eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis within 3 months before screening. Additional 
information regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria, stopping criteria, and definitions of 
relapsing and refractory disease is provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
End Points
The trial had two primary efficacy end points. The first primary end point was the total 
accrued weeks of remission. Remission was defined as a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity 
Score (BVAS), version 3, of 0 (on a scale from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating greater 
disease activity)26 and the receipt of prednisolone or prednisone at a dose of 4.0 mg or less 
per day over the 52-week period. This end point was reported as the proportions of 
participants who had remission for 0 weeks, for more than 0 weeks but less than 12 weeks, 
for at least 12 weeks but less than 24 weeks, for at least 24 weeks but less than 36 weeks, 
and for at least 36 weeks (categorical quantification). The second primary end point was the 
proportion of participants who had remission at both week 36 and week 48.
Secondary end points were the proportion of participants who had remission within the first 
24 weeks and continued to have remission until week 52; the time to first relapse of 
eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis; and the proportions of participants with an 
average prednisolone or prednisone dose of 0 mg per day, of more than 0 mg to not more 
than 4.0 mg per day, of more than 4.0 mg to not more than 7.5 mg per day, and of more than 
7.5 mg per day during weeks 48 through 52. The dose level of 4.0 mg or less per day was 
used as part of the remission criteria for the primary and secondary end points, so given the 
eligibility criteria, no participants were in remission at baseline with respect to these end 
points. On the basis of the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) 
recommendations for clinical studies in systemic vasculitis,27 we used a second, less 
stringent definition of remission of a BVAS of 0 and a prednisolone or prednisone dose of 
7.5 mg or less per day for the following secondary end points: total accrued weeks of 
remission over the 52-week period, the proportion of participants who had remission at both 
week 36 and week 48, and the proportion of participants who had remission within the first 
24 weeks and continued to have remission until week 52. Because the participants were 
required to be taking at least 7.5 mg per day of prednisolone or prednisone before inclusion 
in the trial, it was possible for some of the participants to have remission at baseline with 
respect to these end points.
Relapse was defined as any of the following categories: active vasculitis (BVAS >0), active 
asthma symptoms or signs with a corresponding worsening in the score on the Asthma 
Control Questionnaire, version 6 (ACQ-6; range, 0 to 6 points, with higher scores indicating 
worse disease control; minimal clinically important difference, 0.5 points),28,29 or active 
nasal or sinus disease with a corresponding worsening in at least one of the sinonasal-
symptom items leading to one of the following: an increase in the glucocorticoid dose to

 more than 4.0 mg per day of prednisolone (or equivalent), an initiation of or increase in 
immunosuppressive therapy, or hospitalization. Relapses could be categorized by the local 
investigator as being of more than one type. Details regarding the instruments used and other 
prespecified end points (e.g., the change from baseline in the forced expiratory volume in 1 
second, forced vital capacity, ACQ-6 score, Sino-nasal Outcome Test–22 score [range, 0 to 
110 points, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life; minimal clinically important 
difference, 8.9 points], vascular damage index score [range, 0 to 63 points, with a score of 0 
indicating no damage], and BVAS value) are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. The 
annualized relapse rate (i.e., the estimated rate, defined as the number of relapses per year, 
from a negative binomial model) was also assessed. Safety variables included adverse events 
and serious adverse events, including systemic and local injection-site reactions.
Statistical Analysis
The sample-size calculation was based on the primary end point of the total accrued weeks 
of remission over the 52-week period. We calculated that an estimated sample of 130 
participants (65 participants in each group) would provide the trial with at least 90% power 
to detect a significant between-group difference (at a two-sided P value of 0.05) of 29 
percentage points in the percentage of participants who had remission for at least 24 weeks. 
The power calculation used a test for proportions and assumed that 25% of the participants 
in the placebo group would have accrued remission of at least 24 weeks, as compared with 
54% of those in the mepolizumab group. These values are equivalent to an odds ratio of 3.5. 
To control for type I error, the two primary end points had to be positive in order for the trial 
to be considered successful. Per-protocol adjustment for multiple comparisons is described 
in the Supplementary Appendix. In practice, no adjustment was required.
Efficacy end points were assessed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all the 
participants who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of mepolizumab or 
placebo, and were analyzed according to the randomized trial groups. Safety end points were 
analyzed according to the actual regimen received. Ordered categorical data were analyzed 
with the use of proportional-odds regression. For remission, an odds ratio of more than 1 
would indicate a higher proportion of participants in the higher remission-duration 
categories and a lower proportion of participants in the lower remission-duration categories 
in the mepolizumab group than in the placebo group. For the reduction in the oral 
glucocorticoid dose, an odds ratio of less than 1 would indicate a higher proportion of 
participants in the lower dose categories and a lower proportion of participants in the higher 
dose categories in the mepolizumab group than in the placebo group. Binary outcomes were 
analyzed with the use of logistic regression. Time to first relapse and time to first major 
relapse (defined as an organ- or life-threatening event or a BVAS ≥6 or an asthma or 
sinonasal relapse requiring hospitalization) were analyzed with the use of Cox proportional-
hazards regression. Frequency of relapse and frequency of major relapse were analyzed with 
the use of a negative binomial generalized linear model with a log-link function. Outcomes 
that were assessed at multiple time points were analyzed with the use of mixed-model, 
repeated-measures methods. The baseline dose of prednisolone or prednisone, the baseline 
BVAS, and geographic region (North America, Europe, or Japan) were used as covariates in 
the analyses specified above. Demographic characteristics (in the intention-to-treat

 population) and safety end points (in the as-treated population) were assessed by means of a 
t-test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.
Participants who discontinued mepolizumab or placebo continued to be followed until the 
end of the trial, when possible, and all efficacy data were included in the analysis. All the 
analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9 (SAS Institute).
Results
Participant Population
Participants were recruited from February 2014 through June 2015. Follow-up continued 
until September 2016. In total, 151 participants were enrolled, and 136 underwent 
randomization, of whom 68 were randomly assigned to receive mepolizumab and 68 to 
receive placebo. All the participants received at least one dose of the trial regimen and were 
included in the intention-to-treat population. A total of 14 participants (5 participants in the 
mepolizumab group and 9 in the placebo group) discontinued mepolizumab or placebo 
prematurely, and 10 participants (3 in the mepolizumab group and 7 in the placebo group) 
withdrew from the trial (Fig. 1B, and Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
characteristics of the participants at baseline and history of eosinophilic granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis are shown in Table 1, and in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Efficacy
The trial met the two primary end points. Participants in the mepolizumab group had a 
significantly greater accrued time in remission over the 52-week period than did those in the 
placebo group: 28% of the participants in the mepolizumab group, as compared with 3% of 
those in the placebo group, had remission for at least 24 weeks (odds ratio, 5.91; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 2.68 to 13.03; P<0.001) (Table 2 and Fig. 2A). A total of 47% of 
the participants in the mepolizumab group, as compared with 81% of those in the placebo 
group, did not have remission, according to the definition of this primary end point. A higher 
percentage of participants in the mepolizumab group than in the placebo group had 
remission at both week 36 and week 48 (32% vs. 3%; odds ratio, 16.74; 95% CI, 3.61 to 
77.56; P<0.001) (Table 2). The analysis of accrued weeks of remission according to 
subgroup is shown in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
The efficacy with mepolizumab versus placebo among the 57 participants who had an 
absolute eosinophil count of less than 150 cells per cubic millimeter at baseline was limited 
(21% vs. 7% of the participants had remission for ≥24 weeks; odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.28 
to 3.24). By contrast, among the 79 participants with an absolute eosinophil count of 150 
cells or more per cubic millimeter at baseline, there was a benefit with mepolizumab over 
placebo (33% vs. 0% of the participants had remission for ≥24 weeks; odds ratio, 26.10; 
95% CI, 7.02 to 97.02). More participants in the mepolizumab group than in the placebo 
group had remission within the first 24 weeks of the trial and remained in remission until 
week 52 (19% vs. 1%; odds ratio, 19.65; 95% CI, 2.30 to 167.93; P = 0.007) (Table 2). The 
remission end points that used the EULAR remission criteria (BVAS of 0 and a prednisolone

 or prednisone dose of ≤7.5 mg per day) are shown in Figure S1 and Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
The time to first relapse over the 52-week period was significantly longer in participants 
who received mepolizumab than in those who received placebo (56% vs. 82% of the 
participants had a relapse within the 52-week period; hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21 to 
0.50; P<0.001) (Table 2 and Fig. 2B). The annualized relapse rate was 50% lower in the 
mepolizumab group than in the placebo group (1.14 vs. 2.27; rate ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.36 
to 0.70; P<0.001) (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Vasculitis relapses occurred in 
43% of the participants receiving mepolizumab and in 65% of those receiving placebo; the 
corresponding numbers were 37% and 60% for asthma relapses and 35% and 51% for 
sinonasal relapses. Overall, 20% of the participants had a relapse that was classified as 
vasculitic only, and 54% had a relapse that was categorized as vasculitis in combination with 
asthma or sinonasal relapse (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). The time to the first 
major relapse was significantly longer in the participants in the mepolizumab group than in 
those in the placebo group (22% vs. 35% of the participants had a major relapse within the 
52-week period; hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.98; P = 0.04). The annualized relapse 
rate for major relapse was 44% lower in the mepolizumab group than in the placebo group 
(0.12 vs. 0.21; rate ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.28 to 1.14; P = 0.11).
Participants who received mepolizumab had lower average doses of prednisolone or 
prednisone during weeks 48 through 52 than did those in the placebo group (odds ratio, 
0.20; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.41; P<0.001) (Table S6 and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). During weeks 48 through 52, a total of 30 participants (44%) receiving 
mepolizumab were able to taper the glucocorticoid dose to 4.0 mg or less per day, as 
compared with 5 (7%) receiving placebo. A total of 12 participants (18%) receiving 
mepolizumab were able to discontinue prednisolone or prednisone completely, as compared 
with 2 (3%) receiving placebo. The mean daily dose of prednisolone or prednisone, averaged 
over the 52-week period, was 9.2 mg in the mepolizumab group and 13.5 mg in the placebo 
group. Details regarding all the other outcomes are provided in Figures S2, S3, and S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Safety
Although there was no significant difference between the mepolizumab group and the 
placebo group in the percentage of participants who had an adverse event (97% and 94%, 
respectively), there was an imbalance with regard to serious adverse events during the trial 
period (18% vs. 2 6%) (Table 3). Some of the serious adverse events could have been related 
to disease activity and were therefore also considered to be relapses of eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Overall, the most commonly reported adverse events were 
headache (in 32% of the participants in the mepolizumab group and 18% of those in the 
placebo group), nasopharyngitis (in 18% and 24%, respectively), arthralgia (in 22% and 
18%), sinusitis (in 21% and 16%), and upper respiratory tract infection (in 21% and 16%). 
Exacerbation or worsening of asthma was the most frequent serious adverse event (in 3% of 
the participants in the mepolizumab group vs. 6% of those in the placebo group). Systemic 
reactions were infrequent and were reported with a higher incidence in the mepolizumab

 group than in the placebo group. The incidence of local injection-site reactions was similar 
in the two groups. Although cardiovascular adverse events were infrequent, one participant 
(a 47-year-old man) in the mepolizumab group died from cardiac arrest during the trial 
period; this participant had a history of coronary artery disease. None of the participants in 
the mepolizumab group tested positive for mepolizumab-neutralizing antibodies at any time 
point.
Discussion
In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving participants with 
relapsing or refractory eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis who were receiving 
standard-of-care therapy, mepolizumab treatment showed efficacy on the basis of the two 
primary end points and all secondary end points. Mepolizumab was associated with more 
accrued time in remission and with a lower frequency of relapse than was placebo, which 
allowed for reductions in the glucocorticoid dose in the mepolizumab group. Accrued time 
in remission and fewer relapses are both important clinical goals, so mepolizumab fulfilled 
needs in this population. The adverse-event profile for mepolizumab was similar to that seen 
in previous studies, and no new safety signals were observed.17-21,23,24,30 Although these 
results are noteworthy, at the mepolizumab dose given, 47% of the participants in the 
mepolizumab group did not meet the primary end-point definition of remission, as compared 
with 81% of those in the placebo group. Although close to half the participants in the 
mepolizumab group had a relapse, the 50% lower rate of relapse with mepolizumab 
treatment than was observed with placebo in this trial was similar to the rate seen in clinical 
trials involving participants with other eosinophilic diseases, such as severe eosinophilic 
asthma.17-21,30
It remains unknown why mepolizumab was effective with regard to protocol-defined 
remission in approximately half the participants but not in the entire trial cohort. One 
consideration is that eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a heterogeneous 
disease with some manifestations being non–eosinophil driven. Another possibility is that 
some participants may have had long-standing, irreversible vasculitic damage that was 
refractory to anti–interleukin-5 therapy. Alternatively, although mepolizumab reduced blood 
eosinophils, the dose may have been insufficient to eliminate tissue eosinophils. Although 
previous open-label studies of mepolizumab involving participants with eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis examined a higher dose (750 mg, administered 
intravenously every 4 weeks), it is unclear whether a higher mepolizumab dose than was 
used in this trial (300 mg, administered subcutaneously) could have resulted in better 
responses in some participants. Finally, adrenal insufficiency that was due to long-standing 
glucocorticoid use may have precluded adequate glucocorticoid tapering that would result in 
protocol-defined remission in some participants. Although our results question the precise 
role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of this complex and heterogeneous disease,6 the 
NIAID (grant number, U01 AI097073) is supporting further “omics” research on blood, 
urine, sputum, and tissue samples obtained from a subgroup of patients to address questions 
related to disease risk and pathological features, as well as response to treatment.

 The trial population was representative of patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis who are treated with glucocorticoids with or without additional 
immunosuppressive therapy. All the participants had a history of eosinophilic asthma, and 
almost all had a history of sinonasal abnormality; 15% of the participants had a history of 
cardiomyopathy, 41% had a history of active neuropathy, and 19% were ANCA-positive at 
some time in the course of the disease. Furthermore, at baseline, the majority of participants 
had a BVAS score of more than 0 and the mean vascular damage index score was 4.6, which 
showed notable levels of vasculitic activity and considerable accrued damage. The nature of 
the relapses that were observed also reflects the natural course of eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis, with just 20% of the participants having a relapse that was 
classified as vasculitic only but 54% having relapses that were categorized as vasculitic in 
combination with asthma or sinonasal relapse.
The findings reflect the strengths of the trial, including a large number of enrolled 
participants with this rare condition, the expertise of the participating centers, and the 
comprehensive approach to documenting glucocorticoid use throughout the trial. Such 
documentation is often difficult in studies regarding the tapering of glucocorticoid doses.
This trial also had limitations. First, the BVAS, 31-34 which is a tool that was developed for 
the assessment of vasculitis, was used to characterize disease activity and outcomes because 
no standard assessment tool is validated specifically for eosinophilic granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis. Second, the glucocorticoid dose at trial entry was varied, because participants 
entered the trial while they were taking a dose that had been prescribed by their own 
physician. However, any effect on the glucocorticoid dose that was observed in the final 4 
weeks of the trial should have been mitigated, because tapering occurred with investigators 
who were unaware of the trial-group assignments. Third, because participants were receiving 
glucocorticoid therapy at trial entry, it is likely that their inflammatory markers were 
suppressed, which leaves little opportunity for further reduction with mepolizumab 
treatment. Fourth, because less than 10% of the participants were ANCA-positive at 
baseline, analyses of outcomes according to ANCA status were not performed.
The results of our trial show an advance for patients with this rare disease. Approximately 
half the participants with relapsing or refractory eosinophilic granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis who were treated with mepolizumab had clinically relevant improvements in the 
rates of protocol-defined remission and relapse, which allowed for reduced glucocorticoid 
use. Although 81% of the participants in the placebo group had no accrued weeks of 
remission, 47% of those in the mepolizumab group did not have protocol-defined remission, 
either, which suggests that not all patients will have the same benefit.

 Figure 1. Trial Design and Randomization and Follow-up of the Participants
The continuation criteria (i.e., the criteria required for undergoing randomization) included 
the following: glucocorticoid and immunosuppressive therapy stability (the dose had to be 
stable for ≥4 weeks before randomization); acceptable laboratory assessments, hepatitis 
status, and liver-function tests (see the Supplementary Appendix); and no clinically 
significant abnormality on electrocardiography. During the intervention period, participants 
in the mepolizumab group received 300 mg of mepolizumab plus standard care, and those in 
the placebo group received matching placebo plus standard care. Mepolizumab or placebo 
was administered subcutaneously. The intention-to-treat population was used for the primary 
analysis.

 Figure 2. Remission and First Relapse of Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis in the 
Intention-to-Treat Population
Remission was defined as a Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score of 0 (on a scale from 0 to 
63, with higher scores indicating greater disease activity) and receipt of a prednisolone or 
prednisone dose of 4.0 mg or less per day (Panel A). Data on relapse were censored at week 
52 per the statistical analysis plan (Panel B). I bars at weeks 16, 32, and 52 indicate 95% 
confidence intervals.
