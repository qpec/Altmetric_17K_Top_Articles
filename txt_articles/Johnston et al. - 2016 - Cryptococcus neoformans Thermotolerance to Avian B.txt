Cryptococcus neoformans 
Thermotolerance to Avian 
Body Temperature Is Sufficient 
For Extracellular Growth But 
Not Intracellular Survival In 
Macrophages
Simon A Johnston1,2, Kerstin Voelz3 & Robin C May3,4
Cryptococcus neoformans is a fatal fungal pathogen of humans that efficiently parasitises macrophages. 
Birds can be colonised by cryptococci and can transmit cryptococcosis to humans via inhalation of 
inoculated bird excreta. However, colonisation of birds appears to occur in the absence of symptomatic 
infection. Here, using a pure population of primary bird macrophages, we demonstrate a mechanism 
for this relationship. We find that bird macrophages are able to suppress the growth of cryptococci seen 
in mammalian cells despite C. neoformans being able to grow at bird body temperature, and are able to 
escape from bird macrophages by vomocytosis. A small subset of cryptococci are able to adapt to the 
inhibitory intracellular environment of bird macrophages, exhibiting a large cell phenotype that rescues 
growth suppression. Thus, restriction of intracellular growth combined with survival at bird body 
temperature explains the ability of birds to efficiently spread C. neoformans in the environment whilst 
avoiding systemic disease.
Cryptococcus neoformans is an environmental fungus that causes fatal human and animal disease. In humans, 
cryptococcosis causes hundreds of thousands of deaths each year, the vast majority in immunocompromised 
patients1. As with many significant pathogens, cryptococci are able to parasitise host cells. This potential for an 
intracellular lifestyle allows C. neoformans the potential to evade additional host immune responses and thus 
spread within the body, leading to systemic disease2,3.
Cryptococcus has a remarkably broad host range but with significant variation in susceptibility between spe-
cies in both natural and experimentally induced infection4. Birds are particularly resistant to disease, despite 
diverse avian orders (Passeriformes, Anseriformes, Accipitriformes, Apterygiformes, Psittaciformes and 
Columbiformes) showing clear environmental association with Cryptococcus and the ability to transmit the path-
ogen to humans5–11. The exposure of birds to cryptococci in the environment will result in carriage externally on 
e.g. beaks and claws, but also internal carriage following the ingestion of contaminated vegetable matter or while 
ground feeding12–17. Bird guano is an excellent growth medium for Cryptococcus and external carriage of crypto-
cocci by birds is a likely route for inoculation along with air dispersion of spores. However, if cryptococci are able 
to survive passage through birds this would provide a direct route for inoculation. Transmission of this pathogen 
from birds to humans has important implications both for public health (e.g. exposure of immunocompromised 
individuals to urban pigeons and guano) and for the global dispersal of specific fungal lineages18–20. The under-
lying mechanism of avian resistance to cryptococcosis is unknown but has been hypothesised to be reliant on

higher body temperature21. Here we test this hypothesis directly and show, surprisingly, that high body tempera-
ture alone is insufficient to prevent cryptococcal growth. However, at avian body temperatures, bird macrophages 
strongly suppress fungal growth but a small proportion of the fungal cell population escape killing. Thus, we 
suggest a model whereby birds can harbour low numbers of cryptococci for prolonged periods without disease 
and are therefore able to act as vectors of long-range fungal carriage and are able to directly inoculate guano22.
Results
Avian macrophages suppress intracellular growth of cryptococci. 
Given the importance of mac-
rophage parasitism in mammalian cryptococcal infection, we established a primary avian macrophage model 
to investigate Cryptococcus virulence in birds. To achieve this, we generated a highly purified population of pri-
mary, monocyte derived, macrophages from chicken peripheral blood (Fig. 1a). One day post-isolation, adherent 
cells were a mixed population of monocytes and heterophils (Fig. 1b). After 48 hours heterophils were lost and 
monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) remained (Fig. 1c). Avian macrophages efficiently phagocytosed both 
cryptococci and latex beads of the same diameter (Fig. 1d,e).
In contrast to mammalian macrophages, intracellular proliferation of cryptococci within avian macrophages 
was extremely rare. Instead intracellular cryptococci appeared inert (Fig. 2a) or were killed (observed via loss 
of cytoplasmic GFP signal (Fig. 2b) that was independent of any photobleaching (Fig. 2c)). Loss of GFP signal 
occurred with degradation and dispersal of polysaccharide capsule (Fig. 2d) and subsequent fungal cell digestion 
(Fig. 2e).
Avian body temperature is necessary but not sufficient to prevent cryptococcal 
growth. 
Quantitation of viable intracellular yeast 24 hours post phagocytosis confirmed our time-lapse data, 
indicating that there was a greater than 80% reduction in the numbers of cryptococci in avian macrophages at a 
typical bird body temperature of 42 °C (Fig. 3a). However, a shift in temperature from 42 °C to 39 °C resulted in a 
restoration in the number of cryptococci and a shift to 37 °C reinstated the ability of cryptococci to proliferate in 
macrophages (Fig. 3a and see Supplementary Movie S1 online). Budding cryptococci could be clearly observed 
within avian macrophages at 37 °C by microscopy (Fig. 3b,c), with 70% of macrophages exhibiting large pha-
gosomes containing many cryptococci after 24 hours (Fig. 3d). To compare the direct effect of temperature on 
cryptococcal growth we measured growth of extracellular cryptococci (i.e. growth in macrophage media). We

found that, while the number of cryptococci was similarly modulated by temperature, there was still an increase 
in cryptococcal numbers over 24 hours at 42 °C in contrast to the 80% reduction (Fig. 3e) at the same temperature 
in bird macrophages. Thus temperature alone cannot explain this restriction of cryptococcal growth, but rather 
the enhanced activity of avian macrophages at the bird body temperature of 42 °C degrees is responsible for pre-
venting expansion of the intracellular pathogen population.
Mammals are typically unable to sustain core temperatures of 42 °C for prolonged periods. Nonetheless, we 
tested the ability of Cryptococcus to grow in murine macrophages above 37 °C. Incubation of murine macrophages 
at 39 °C saw a large reduction in numbers of cryptococci present at 24 hours post phagocytosis but at 42 °C zero 
cryptococci were present (Fig. 3f). However, murine macrophage numbers were significantly reduced at 39 °C, 
and completely ablated at 42 °C (Fig. 3g), suggesting that reduced numbers of cryptococci measured was due to 
loss of macrophages from the assay and not increased cryptococcal killing, a loss that does not occur with avian 
cells (Fig. 3h).
Vomocytosis is conserved as a mechanism of escape for Cryptococcus in avian macrophages 
irrespective of successful parasitism. 
Vomocytosis is the non-lytic escape of Cryptococcus from host

cells8,10. Given the severe defect in Cryptococcus host cell parasitism in avian macrophages we hypothesized 
that vomocytosis would be similarly affected. However, cryptococci were efficiently vomocytosed from avian 
macrophages at 42 °C and at an incidence comparable to that measured in mammalian macrophages23 at 37 °C 
(Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Movie S2 online). Similarly, the incidence of vomocytosis was not affected by shift-
ing avian macrophages to 37 °C (Fig. 4a) despite a dramatic change in phagosome morphology that resulted in 
a combination of multiple single expulsion events8 (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Movie S3 online) and massive 
vacuole exit10 (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Movie S4 online). Taken together these data demonstrate both that 
vomocytosis is conserved in birds and that cryptococci can escape host cells under unfavourable conditions.

Higher host cell temperature drives protective increase in fungal cell size. 
Careful analysis of 
time-lapse experiments showed that a small subset of intracellular cryptococci became enlarged, rather than 
exiting via vomocytosis11 and this increase in cell size was sufficient to restore some level of proliferative ability 
(6% over 24 hours, pooled data from 131 cells from n = 
 3 experiments; Fig. 5a,b; see Supplementary Movie S5 
online). After 24 hours extracellular growth at 37 °C, cryptococci showed no change in cell size compared to 
the initial population (Fig. 5c; P = 
 0.12), while intracellular growth in avian macrophages at 37 °C resulted in 
a reduction in cell size in comparison to the initial population (Fig. 5d; P = 
 2.6 × 
 10−6). In contrast, both intra-
cellular and extracellular cryptococci showed significant increases in size over 24 hours at 42 °C (Fig. 5c,d). We 
therefore considered that this cell size increase might be protective, permitting survival of cryptococci. In support 
of this hypothesis, measurement of cryptococcal cell size from identical time points in time-lapse experiments 
demonstrated that larger cells were significantly more likely to survive within avian macrophages (Fig. 5e). Thus 
the higher avian body temperature is necessary for the innate control of cryptococcal infection but also induces a 
protective increase in fungal cell size that allows the pathogen to persist (Fig. 5f).
Discussion
Here we show that primary avian macrophages, in contrast to those from mammals, suppress growth of the fatal 
fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Avian macrophages alone were able to kill the majority of internal-
ized cryptococci but this activity is dependent on the higher avian body temperature. Mammalian macrophages 
appeared to similarly suppress growth of cryptococci but were found to be killed at 39 °C and 42 °C. Cryptococci 
are able to escape avian cells via vomocytosis and respond to the higher host temperature by means of a protective 
cell enlargement. Such survival methods highlight the success of Cryptococcus as an environmental opportunistic 
pathogen, which can exploit a diverse range of host species.
Intracellular growth of cryptococci in macrophages is one of the earliest described characteristics of human 
cryptococcal cellular pathogenesis24, correlates with disease and is conserved in such diverse organisms as insect 
phagocytes25 and social amoebae26. What then determines the resistance of avian macrophages to cryptococcal 
proliferation? Tolerance of relatively high body temperatures is the primary determinant of fungal infections 
in homoeothermic hosts and explains why so few fungi are pathogens of mammals21. However, Cryptococcus

neoformans is a remarkably thermotolerant yeast27 and this thermotolerance is the primary distinguishing feature 
for disease-causing cryptococcal species, even in the presence of other major virulence factors. The maximal 
growth range of Cryptococcus varies between strains and by growth environment but shows significant overlap 
with avian body temperature28. In agreement with this we show that Cryptococcus is able to grow at 42 °C in an 
extracellular niche. However, cryptococci were unable to grow intracellularly in avian macrophages, and shifting 
avian macrophages to lower temperatures alone restored the intracellular proliferative capacity of cryptococci, 
thus demonstrating the essential contribution of this innate cellular immune response to suppression of crypto-
coccosis in birds.
Remarkably, we also demonstrate that vomocytosis of intracellular cryptococci occurs in avian macrophages 
in a way that is indistinguishable from mammalian vomocytosis in either morphology or frequency. In addition, 
this process appears to be unaffected by temperature of the avian cell and when proliferation is severely restricted. 
The cause and function of vomocytosis during animal infection is still unclear but vomocytosis offers a clear 
advantage in the avoidance of predation by soil amoebae predators29 and these data support the fundamental 
importance and conservation of this unusual phenomenon.
We identified two distinct cryptococcal cell size changes during interaction with avian macrophages. The 
reduction in cell size in comparison to the initial population observed in intracellular cryptococci at 37 °C 
demonstrated the sensing of a lack of nutrient resources, resulting in low growth rate and small cell size30. In 
contrast, extracellular cryptococci showed no difference in cell size, and a good growth rate, at 37 °C. Very little

proliferation occurred intracellularly at 42 °C but those cells that did proliferate first significantly increased their 
cell size (6% of intracellular population, pooled data from 131 infected macrophages from n = 
 3 experiments). 
This increase in size was smaller than that exhibited by titan/giant cryptococcal cells found during mammalian 
infections31,32 but is more similar to the changes seen in mutant cells lacking phospholipase b1 activity (plb1) in 
mammalian macrophages33. Such sub-population changes are also similar to the ‘division of labour’ phenotype 
described for C. gattii34. In agreement with our data increased cell size appears to be driven by adaptation to host 
stress31.
In conclusion, effective phagocyte function at the higher avian body temperature results in almost total sup-
pression of cryptococcal proliferation within bird macrophages. However, a minority of cryptococci are able to 
escape killing, either by a protective cell enlargement or via vomocytosis. While it is likely that external carriage, 
e.g. on beaks or claws, is sufficient for the inoculation of guano and other environmental we are able to demon-
strate that internal carriage is possible, and even likely, following any ingestion of cryptococci. This provides a 
cellular basis for the presentation and outcome of avian cryptococcosis, for asymptomatic internal carriage and 
for localised infections of low-temperature tissues to occur (e.g. cutaneous infection) while systemic disease is 
extremely rare.
Materials and Methods
Cryptococcus Culture and infection. 
Cryptococcal strain H99GFP23 was grown for 18 hours in YPD (2% 
glucose, 1% peptone, and 1% yeast extract) rotating (20 rpm) at 25 °C. Yeast cells were pelleted from culture by 
centrifugation (2 minutes, 4000 g) and resuspended in PBS.
Isolation of Primary Chicken Monocyte Derived Macrophages. 
Chicken monocytes were isolated 
from chicken peripheral blood (Firstlink, Birmingham, UK). Blood was diluted 1:1 with sterile PBS, layered onto 
a Ficoll Plaque Plus (GE Healthcare, Vienna) cushion at a ratio of 1:1 and centrifuged at 285 × 
 g for 30 minutes 
with no braking. Cells were harvested from the Ficoll interface, diluted 1:1 with sterile PBS and pelleted by cen-
trifugation at 200xg for 5 minutes, washed once in PBS and resuspended in RPMI with 5% chicken serum, 50 U/
ml penicillin and 50 μ 
g/ml streptomycin. Cell suspension was diluted to 1 × 
 106 cells per ml and 20ml plated 
per 75 cm2 tissue culture flask at 42 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After 24 hours non-adherent 
cells were removed. Day 1 post isolation adherent cells were a mixed population of monocytes and heterophils 
(Fig. 1b). After 48 hours adherence to plastic, heterophils were lost and monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) 
remained35. MDMs showed characteristic flattening and increased cell size (Fig. 1c). MDMs were detached with 
Accutase treatment (PAA), counted and 1ml of a 2 × 
 105 cells per ml solution plated in 24-well plates. Purity 
of cell population was measured, after each isolation, by flow cytometry (FACSCaliber and CellQuestPro soft-
ware, BD Biosciences) after labelling with PE conjugated mAb 56C4 IgG1 (Southern Biotech) or isotype control 
(Fig. 1a).
Phagocytosis of Cryptococcus and Latex Beads. 
Cryptococci or red fluorescent latex beads (L3030; 
2 μ 
m mean particle size; Sigma, Poole, UK) were resuspended in RPMI, added to chicken macrophages at a 10:1 
ratio and incubated for 2 hours at 42 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Phagocytosis efficiency was meas-
ured by flow cytometry (FACSCaliber and CellQuestPro software, BD Biosciences).
Live Imaging. 
After phagocytosis of cryptococci, chicken primary macrophages were washed at least five 
times in PBS before imaging. Time lapse images were captured on a TE2000 inverted microscope (Nikon) with 
Digital Sight DS-Qi1MC camera (Nikon), 20× 
 objective (Ph1 PLAN APO), using NIS elements AR software 
(Nikon). Phase contrast images were captured every 2 minutes and fluorescence images were captured every hour 
for between 24 and 48 hours. The microscope was enclosed in a temperature controlled and humidified environ-
mental chamber (Okolabs) with 5% CO2 at either 37 °C or 42 °C.
Labelling and imaging of fixed cells. 
Cells were fixed for 10 minutes in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. 
TRITC-phalloidin labelling of actin and immunocytochemistry was performed as described previously36. 
Antibody to cryptococcal capsule (mAb 18B7; gift from Arturo Casadevall) was used at 1 μ 
g/ml. Images were 
captured on TE2000 (Nikon) with 12-bit QICAM (QImaging), 60× 
 objective (CFI Plan Apo TIRF oil 1.49NA) 
using NIS elements AR software (Nikon).
Quantification of Intracellular and Extracellular Proliferation. 
For quantification of intracellu-
lar growth at 37 °C, 39 °C or 42 °C, each well was washed with PBS at least five times, to remove unphagocy-
tosed extracellular yeast cells, and 1 ml RPMI was added. At each time point (0 h, 18 h, 24 h and 48 h) media was 
removed and 200 μ 
L sterile dH2O was added to lyse macrophage cells. After 30 min, the intracellular yeast were 
released and collected. Another 200 μ 
L dH2O was added to each well to collect the remaining yeast cells. We have 
previously shown this approach does not adversely affect yeast viability (Ma et al. 2009). The yeast cell suspension 
was diluted and plated on YPD agar for colony forming unit (cfu) counting. This approach was performed in 
parallel with haemocytomer and flow cytometry measurement as described previously23,37,38 but these approaches 
proved less accurate due to inability to distinguish cryptococci from macrophage vesicles in the case of haemo-
cytometer counting and GFP fluorescent dead cryptococci from live cells with flow cytometry. The numbers of 
cryptococci presented are the ratio of the number of cryptococci at each time point divided by the number imme-
diately after phagocytosis. For quantification of extracellular growth, RPMI media alone was inoculated identi-
cally to macrophages, incubated at 37 °C, 39 °C or 42 °C and diluting cfu counts were taken at each time point.
Measurement of cryptococcal cell size. 
Diameters of intracellular and extracellular cryptococci were 
calculated from measurements of cell area in ImageJ from images of fixed samples prepared as described above.

Scientific RepoRts | 6:20977 | DOI: 10.1038/srep20977
For comparison of live and dead cells in time lapse experiments cell area was measured in NIS elements AR 
(Nikon) in the frame immediately following that in which fluorescence loss was observed in a dead cell and a 
corresponding live cell from the same frame and field of view.
Image processing. 
TE2000 images from NIS elements AR were exported as individual tiff files and trans-
formed into tiff stacks using ImageJ. All Quicktime movies were made using ImageJ with Mpeg4 compression. 
Individual images for figures were copied from ImageJ into Photoshop CS3 (Adobe), which was then used to form 
RGB merges and to adjust contrast. Illustrator CS3 (Adobe) was used to assemble figures and add scale bars, time 
indexes, arrows etc. except where noted in figure legend.
Statistical analysis. 
Statistical significance was calculated using the Fisher exact test add-in (http://
www.obertfamily.com/software/fisherexact.html) in Microsoft Excel for pooled categorical data and using a 
Mann-Whitney U-test (http://elegans.swmed.edu/leon/stats/utest.html; Leon Avery) for pooled continuous data. 
Box plots were generated using http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/cgi-bin/stats/anova_pnp_form.sh?ngroup= 
n (line

 median, box = 
 interquartile range (IQR), bar =
