32 
lung function and BHR?  
33 
 
34 
What is the bottom line?   
35 
This is the first study to report beneficial effects of growing up on a farm on adult FEV1 and

40 
This study describes the associations between early life farm or microbial proxy exposures and 
41 
adult measures of clinical lung function, BHR, and allergic disease to help define the role of 
42 
microbial biodiversity and farm exposure on adult lung function outcomes.

Abstract 
46 
Rationale: Evidence has suggested that exposure to environmental or microbial biodiversity in 
47 
early-life may impact subsequent lung function and allergic disease risk.  
48 
Objectives: To investigate the influence of childhood living environment and biodiversity 
49 
indicators on atopy, asthma and lung function in adulthood.  
50 
Methods & Measurements: The European Community Respiratory Health Survey II 
51 
investigated ~10,201 26-54 year old participants from 14 countries, including participants’ place 
52 
of upbringing (farm, rural environment or inner city) before age 5 years. A “biodiversity score” 
53 
was created based on childhood exposure to cats, dogs, day care, bedroom sharing and older 
54 
siblings. Associations with lung function, bronchial hyper responsiveness (BHR), allergic 
55 
sensitization, asthma and rhinitis were analysed. 
56 
Main Results: As compared to a city upbringing, those with early-life farm exposure had less 
57 
atopic sensitization (aOR 0.46, 95% CI=0.37-0.58), atopic BHR (0.54[0.35-0.83]), atopic asthma 
58 
(0.47[0.28-0.81]), and atopic rhinitis (0.43[0.32-0.57]), but not non-atopic outcomes. Less 
59 
pronounced protective effects were observed for rural environment exposures. Women with a 
60 
farm upbringing had higher FEV1 (adjusted difference 110 mL [64-157]), independent of 
61 
sensitization and asthma. In an inner city environment, a higher biodiversity score was related to 
62 
less allergic sensitization.  
63 
Conclusions: This is the first study to report beneficial effects of growing up on a farm on adult 
64 
FEV1. Our study confirmed the beneficial effects of early farm life on sensitization, asthma, 
65 
rhinitis, and found a similar association for BHR. In persons with an urban upbringing, a higher 
66 
biodiversity score predicted less allergic sensitisation, but to a lesser magnitude than a childhood 
67 
farm environment.

Introduction 
70 
A dramatic rise in asthma and allergic disease over recent decades has motivated extensive 
71 
research into the aetiological factors responsible for these conditions. Various hypotheses have 
72 
been put forth to explain this rise in allergic disease with respect to early-life exposures.  Recent 
73 
evidence has indicated that the level of exposure to environmental or microbial biodiversity in 
74 
early-life may impact the subsequent risk of allergic outcomes.  This hypothesis was initially 
75 
generated by the observation of an inverse association between family size and hay fever, and has 
76 
since been coined the “hygiene hypothesis”. (1) This work has been subsequently expanded as 
77 
the microbial hypothesis by observations on the links between exposure to farming environments 
78 
and a reduction in allergic diseases. The ‘farm effect’ has been observed by a number of studies, 
79 
the majority of which have focussed on childhood  farm exposure and disease onset in childhood, 
80 
while fewer studies have investigated the impact of early life exposures on adult disease 
81 
phenotypes. (2,3) Exposure to increased loads of microbes such as viral, bacterial, and parasitic 
82 
agents associated with farming environments have been proposed as contributing factors in this 
83 
link and previous studies have explored various  routes of exposure associated with farm life 
84 
more thoroughly to investigate their relative contributions to this ‘farm effect’. (2)  Supporting 
85 
this hypothesis, studies have also shown that endotoxin and fungal loads in farming homes are 
86 
significantly higher than those in non-farming homes. (4–8).  
87 
Following the interest in early life as a critical window for exposures that determine lifelong 
88 
health and disease status, numerous studies have investigated associations between childhood 
89 
farm exposure and childhood allergic diseases.  Systematics reviews synthesizing considerable 
90 
evidence from studies on early life farm exposure and childhood disease outcomes have shown a 
91 
decreased risk of asthma, wheeze and allergic disease associated with the ‘farm effect’. (3,9) 
92 
However, fewer studies have analysed the impact of these childhood exposures on well-defined 
93 
 5 
 
allergic adulthood outcomes or the potential persistence of the ‘farm effect’ into adult life. (2,3,9) 
94 
While the majority of existing research has investigated allergic outcomes including asthma, little 
95 
work has been conducted on the association between early life farm exposure and clinical 
96 
measures of lung function in childhood, adolescence or adulthood. (10–14)  Findings in younger 
97 
cohorts have been conflicting, with one study finding no improvements in spirometric measures 
98 
related to the ‘farm effect’ (12), another study showing only higher FVC in children born on a 
99 
farm (14), and a third study finding a lower prevalence of BHR in adolescents raised on a farm- a 
100 
finding that was more distinct in girls (13) . Although few manuscripts have completely stratified 
101 
this association by atopy to investigate this association among atopic and non-atopic groups, in a 
102 
study on farming environments childhood health outcomes, Fuchs et al. found that farm exposure 
103 
reduced risk of wheeze independent of atopic status and observed a statistically significant 
104 
interaction between atopy and fractional exhaled nitric oxide, but not lung function or BHR.(12) 
105 
In this under-researched area, only one study has investigated the association between early life 
106 
farm exposure and adult lung function, finding no statistically significant results.(11)  This study 
107 
also found no association between a farm upbringing and risk of BHR. The only other study on 
108 
this topic found decreased odds of adult BHR with being “born and raised” on a farm. (10) 
109 
Additionally, many studies on farming exposures and allergic disease outcomes rely on 
110 
comparisons between categorized “farming” and “non-farming” communities, which may 
111 
overlook the significance of intermediary rural exposures. This is an important distinction in the 
112 
context that increasing urbanization is linked to a higher prevalence of allergic disease. (15)  
113 
Moreover, the strength of the ‘farming effect’ is not often compared to the other associated early-
114 
life exposures related to environmental biodiversity such as pet keeping, older siblings, bedroom 
115 
sharing, and interactions with other children through day care or nursery school attendance.(16–
116 
18) As such, it is currently unclear if exposures to an increased microbial load in an urban setting 
117 
 6 
 
might approximate the effect of early-life farming exposure on allergic and respiratory disease 
118 
outcomes.  
119 
 
120 
In this manuscript, we aim to add knowledge to these gaps in this field of research using the 
121 
European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS), the largest international multi-
122 
country study of adult asthma, collected information on early childhood exposure to farming and 
123 
place of upbringing.  In addition, information was collected on other environmental exposures 
124 
related to biodiversity and microbial load along with objective outcome measures of IgE 
125 
mediated sensitization and lung function in adult life. Using these data we aimed to investigate 
126 
whether exposure to farming is related to adult allergic outcomes and lung function, and if so, 
127 
whether any associations can be explained by microbial proxy markers.  
128

Methods 
130 
Study design and data collection tools 
131 
The methods of the European Community Respiratory Health Study (ECRHS) I survey have 
132 
been fully described elsewhere. (19,20) Briefly, in the ECRHS I, participating centres randomly 
133 
selected samples of 20-44 year olds, from a total of 48 centres in 22 countries during 1991-1993. 
134 
A sampling frame randomly selected 1500 men and women from pre-existing administrative 
135 
boundaries with a population of at least 150,000 people, who were mailed a short postal 
136 
questionnaire about asthma and asthma-like symptoms (Stage 1). During Stage 2, a random 
137 
subsample, made up of roughly 20% of Stage 1 respondents were invited to attend a local testing 
138 
centre to complete a more detailed questionnaire administered by an interviewer and undergo 
139 
skin prick and blood tests, assessment of lung function by spirometry, and methacholine 
140 
challenge testing.  In addition, participants who were not in the random sample, but who reported 
141 
 7 
 
current use of treatment for asthma, an asthma diagnosis, or that they had been woken with 
142 
shortness of breath in the previous 12 months (symptomatic sample) were also invited to 
143 
participate in Stage 2.  
144 
 
145 
The ECRHS II, conducted between 1998 and 2002, was a follow-up of the clinical participants 
146 
included in the ECRHS I. Twenty-nine centres participated in this follow-up, where participants 
147 
underwent a self-completed screening questionnaire, an administered clinical interview, lung 
148 
function testing and serum IgE analysis. Clinical measures used in this analysis were collected 
149 
during the ECRHS II follow-up. The data on early-life farm exposure and current respiratory 
150 
symptoms that were used in this analysis were also collected in this survey. The detailed protocol 
151 
can be found at www.ecrhs.org. 
152 
  
153 
IgE measurements 
154 
Using the Pharmacia CAP System (Pharmacia Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden), total serum 
155 
IgE and specific IgE levels to cat, house dust mite (D. pteronyssinus), mold Cladosporium and 
156 
timothy grass were measured.  Each sample was handled in a similar manner, with centrifugation 
157 
and subsequent storage at -20°C until IgE analysis. The serum level measurement range for total 
158 
IgE was 2–2000 kU/L and 0.35–100 kUA/L for specific IgE.  
159 
 
160 
Lung Function 
161 
Lung function was assessed by spirometry, and the maximum forced expiratory volume in one 
162 
second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured through a maximum of five 
163 
acceptable tests. 
164 
 8 
 
 
165 
Bronchial Hyperresponsiveness (BHR) was measured by methacholine challenge testing. 
166 
Methacholine was released via a Mefar dosimeter (Mefar, Bovezzo, Italy). Two minutes after 
167 
each inhalation FEV1 was recorded, and the test was stopped when either a 20% fall in FEV1 was 
168 
achieved or the final methacholine dose had been given.  
169 
 
170 
Definitions  
171 
Outcomes 
172 
Bronchial Hyperresponsiveness (BHR) was defined by a fall of at least 20% in FEV1 after the 
173 
methacholine challenge test (accumulated dose 1 mg), and allergic sensitization was 
174 
characterized by at least one positive test  to any specific allergen  (≥0.35 kUA/L). Nasal allergies 
175 
were determined by questionnaire with response to “Do you have any nasal allergies including 
176 
‘hayfever’?”.  Current asthma was defined as BHR AND current wheeze OR the use of asthma 
177 
medications in the last 12 months. (21) Participants were classified as having current wheeze if 
178 
they answered yes to the question “Have you had wheezing or whistling at any time during the 
179 
last 12 months?”. Continuous measures of FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC were used in this analysis. 
180 
The outcomes of asthma, rhinitis and BHR were stratified into allergic and non-allergic 
181 
phenotypes based on the presence or absence of allergic sensitization as defined above. 
182 
 
183 
Primary exposure 
184 
For this analysis, participants were grouped by place of upbringing before the age of five years as 
185 
reported in the ECRHS II follow-up survey. The question that collected the participant’s 
186 
childhood living environment was “What term describes the place you lived most of the time 
187 
when you were under the age of five years? a) farm b) village in a rural area c) small town d) 
188 
 9 
 
suburb of a city e) inner city”. A three level variable was used in the analysis with inner city, 
189 
farm, and a combined intermediary category of village, town, or suburb. Similar findings and no 
190 
statistically significant differences in outcomes were observed between the three intermediary 
191 
groups when investigated individually. A small, but insignificant, difference was observed 
192 
between suburb and village with suburbs having a lower benefit than village.  
193 
 
194 
Other exposures  
195 
The “proxy microbial load score” was calculated from answers to the following survey questions 
196 
from the ECRHS II: (a) “At what age did you first attend a school, play school, day care or 
197 
nursery?” (=1 if attended before age 5); (b) “Was there a dog/cat in your home during your first 
198 
year of life OR when you were aged 1 to 4 years OR when you were aged 5-15 years?”  (=1 for 
199 
each affirmative answer) (c) “How many other children regularly slept in your bedroom before 
200 
you were five years old?” (=1 if >0) and; (d) “How many older brothers (or sisters) [do you 
201 
have]?” (=1 if >0).  The combined effect of daycare, pets, bedroom sharing, and siblings in early 
202 
life was examined together as the cumulative “proxy microbial load score”. Individuals were 
203 
given a score for the number of factors (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 exposures).]”. 
204 
 
205 
Analytical methods 
206 
The significance of variation in baseline demographics by early life residence was assessed with 
207 
chi-squared tests or ANOVA methods.  Multiple and multinomial logistic regression analyses 
208 
were performed to estimate adjusted odds ratios for the associations between childhood 
209 
environment and clinical phenotypes while adjusting for relevant confounders.  Multiple linear 
210 
regression was performed to estimate mean differences in lung function by differing early-life 
211 
home environments while adjusting for possible confounders. A potential interaction between sex 
212 
 10 
 
and childhood environment was investigated, and a stratified analysis was presented in the 
213 
presence of a significant interaction. Sensitivity analyses were performed with adjustment for 
214 
random and symptomatic sample membership and were consistent with the presented findings. 
215 
 
216 
For all analyses, the following a priori confounders were included: age, sex, study centre, 
217 
smoking status, and family history of allergic disease. In addition, height2 was determined to be 
218 
an a priori confounder in the analysis of lung function data. A set of potential confounders were 
219 
also explored during the analyses and were only included in the final model if the point estimate 
220 
changed by more than 10 percent; these variables included maternal/paternal smoking, older 
221 
siblings or bedroom sharing, early day care or nursery school attendance, early-life cat/dog 
222 
ownership, socioeconomic status and weight in lung function analyses.  Potential heterogeneity 
223 
of associations was studied across countries. A fixed effect model was used to meta-analyse risk 
224 
estimates when there was no significant heterogeneity based on the I2 value (<50%) in order to 
225 
compare risk estimates across participating countries. 
226 
 
227 
A subgroup analysis, limited to those with inner city upbringing in the first five years, was 
228 
performed using a score of microbial load and diversity exposures to evaluate whether potential 
229 
risk reduction in the outcomes are similar to any risk reduction related to exposure to farming.  
230 
 
231 
All analyses were carried out using Stata 12 (StataCorp, College Station Texas).

Results 
235 
Of the 10,201 participants with survey data for the question on childhood living environment, the 
236 
majority reported living in a village in a rural area, small town, or suburb of a city before the age 
237 
of five years (63.9%). The percentage of inner city participants was 26.9% and the smallest group 
238 
was those living on farms at 9.2%. Farm-exposed participants were significantly older at follow-
239 
up than those born in rural or inner city environments (Table 1).  The prevalence of exposure to 
240 
dogs or cats during childhood, older siblings, or bedroom sharing with older children was also 
241 
higher in those who reported living on a farm environment before the age of five years. In 
242 
addition, a family history of allergic disease was less prevalent in this group.  
243 
 
244 
Allergic phenotypes 
245 
A lower prevalence of any allergic sensitization (p<0.001), nasal symptoms (p<0.001) or BHR 
246 
(0.002) was observed in participants reporting farm exposure before the age of five (Table 2). 
247 
Those who lived on a farm before the age of five years had a reduced risk (OR=0.46 95% 
248 
CI=0.37-0.58) of adult atopy compared to those living in the inner city (Table 2).  Only a 
249 
moderate reduction was observed in adults from a village/town/suburb. Stratification of nasal 
250 
symptoms by sensitization showed that the protective effect of the farming environment was 
251 
limited to those with allergic nasal symptoms (OR= 0.43, 95%CI=0.32-0.57). Participants with 
252 
early-life village, town or suburb, exposure did not have reduced risk of allergic nasal symptoms 
253 
when compared to the inner city reference group. A similar pattern was observed for current 
254 
allergic/non-allergic asthma in reference to place of upbringing, in which farm children 
255 
experienced a significant reduction in the risk of allergic asthma by approximately 50%. On the 
256 
other hand, the risk of current allergic asthma for those participants from a village, town, or 
257 
suburb was not-significantly reduced when compared to the inner city reference group. A very 
258 
 12 
 
similar pattern was also observed in the analysis of allergic/non-allergic BHR in relation to 
259 
childhood environment.  
260 
 
261 
Lung function  
262 
An interaction (p=0.03) was observed between gender and early-life home environment for FEV1 
263 
(Table 3), but not FEV1/FVC ratio. After adjustment for a priori confounders and weight, 
264 
females from a childhood farming environment experienced a significantly higher FEV1 of 
265 
approximately 110 mL (95% CI 64-157). Slightly higher FEV1/FVC values were observed for 
266 
those who lived on a farm before the age of five years (0.60 p=0.036, Table 2). However this 
267 
increase was found to be only modest after adjustment for maternal/paternal smoking and serious 
268 
respiratory infections before the age of five years (p=0.115).  No significant associations were 
269 
observed with FEV1/FVC categorized above and below 70%. Also, a higher FEV1/FVC was not 
270 
observed for village/town/suburb participants as compared to the inner city reference group. 
271 
 
272 
Meta-analysis of the effects  
273 
No heterogeneity was seen between the associations of place of upbringing between countries for 
274 
the outcome of allergic sensitisation (Figure 1; I2=0%) while some heterogeneity was observed 
275 
for the outcome of FEV1 (Figure 2; I2=44.8%).  The pooled risk estimate for any sensitization in 
276 
the farming subgroup indicates a 53% (95%CI=0.36-0.59) reduction in the risk of sensitization, 
277 
while the village group had only 26% (95%CI=0.74-0.96) reduction when compared to 
278 
individuals exposed to an inner city environment in early life.  Higher FEV1 levels were observed 
279 
in females with a farm upbringing when compared to those from an inner city (pooled mean = 
280 
0.13 L, 95% CI = 0.09-0.18). 
281 
 
282 
 13 
 
Sub group analyses  
283 
Descriptive statistics for each biodiversity score subgroup are displayed in Table 4. Among those 
284 
who lived in an inner city in the first five years of life, a reduction in risk of any sensitization was 
285 
observed with increasing proxy microbial load score (trend p=0.05) (Table 5). Similarly, for most 
286 
outcomes, decreased odds of all allergic phenotypes were observed with increasing proxy 
287 
microbial load score.  However, as seen in Table 5, early life farming exposure was associated 
288 
with a stronger reduction in the risk of sensitization and allergic disease phenotypes than any 
289 
level of proxy microbial exposure in the inner city.  
290 
Discussion 
291 
In this international study, interestingly, a higher FEV1 was observed only in females exposed to 
292 
farming in the first five years of life independent of asthma and sensitization, which to our 
293 
knowledge has never been reported before. Furthermore, a protective effect of early-life farming 
294 
exposure was observed on allergic sensitization and, allergic phenotypes of nasal symptoms, 
295 
asthma, and BHR in adults, and while those raised on a rural setting had some reduction in the 
296 
risk of sensitisation, this was not as strong as seen for those raised on a farm. The association 
297 
between farm exposure and sensitization was consistent across all countries participating in this 
298 
study while the effect on FEV1 varied slightly across centres. Our findings on atopic sensitization 
299 
are consistent with an earlier ECRHS I analysis, conducted by Leynaert et al, comparing farm vs. 
300 
non-farm participants, which found a reduced risk of atopic sensitization in adulthood (ORc 0.68, 
301 
CI 95% 0.55–0.86) with living on a farm in childhood, but no associations were observed for risk 
302 
of asthma (ORc 0.82; CI 95% 0.53–1.27) or wheeze (ORc 1.09; CI 95% 0.82–1.46). (22) While 
303 
early life exposures in the inner city related to increasing proxies of microbial diversity were also 
304 
shown to be associated with a decreased risk of sensitization, this reduction of risk was not as 
305 
large as with farm exposure alone. 
306 
 14 
 
 
307 
Our analysis of proxy markers of increasing microbial exposures indicated that within an urban 
308 
environment increased exposure to microbial load may reduce risk of atopic disease but the 
309 
magnitude of this effect does not match that observed with farm exposure. It is possible that 
310 
prolonged contact with unique farm exposures such as livestock with extensive microbial 
311 
diversity are unmatched by any exposure in the inner city. These findings further support the role 
312 
of both load and diversity in environmental exposures in the development of allergic diseases, as 
313 
proposed by the “microbial diversity hypothesis”. (23–27) It is also relevant to consider the 
314 
possibility that proxy measures such as pet, daycare and crowding exposure can represent 
315 
alternate factors or mechanisms that influence disease risk in addition to microbial biodiversity, 
316 
which could potentially influence the estimates related to our biodiversity score. Additionally, 
317 
selective avoidance of pets due to asthma or allergy could also influence inner city biodiversity 
318 
scores, but would likely only play a small role in our estimates.(28)  However, the overall 
319 
findings from our analysis indicate that diversity of early life microbial exposures impact disease 
320 
outcomes later in adult life.  
321 
 
322 
To date, the majority of work done on farm exposures has focused on the association between 
323 
early life farm contact and childhood allergic and respiratory disease outcomes, while very few 
324 
studies have investigated the impact of early farm contact on adult disease, and especially adult 
325 
lung function. (9). Our findings on the impact of farm exposure on lung function in women are 
326 
novel.  Differential response to a range of environmental exposures, such as microbial diversity, 
327 
indoor environment and air pollution, might possibly contribute to this gender difference.  
328 
Further, the actual exposures related to urban and rural environment might differ between men 
329 
and women. It is possible that men work in different roles or for longer periods on a farm than 
330 
 15 
 
females, to a point where their exposure levels become harmful instead of protective. (29)  The 
331 
social differences around standards of cleanliness for males and females could also impact the 
332 
function of the hygiene hypothesis in relation to sex.(30) A sex-dependent functioning of the 
333 
‘farm-effect’ has been observed in children or adolescents in relation to cumulative incidence of 
334 
asthma and in adults with early life farm exposure in relation to asthma, hay fever and atopy. 
335 
(29,31,32)   In addition, gender differences have already been explored in relation to other 
336 
environmental exposures and lung health and allergic disease outcomes.  In a recent study by 
337 
Mészáros et al., exposure to home environmental tobacco smoke was found to increase the odds 
338 
of current asthma only in males. (33) Although the findings have been inconsistent, gender 
339 
differences in response to air pollution have also been reported. (34,35)   
340 
 
341 
Gene-environment interactions have also been reported to play a crucial role in the association 
342 
between farming and allergic/respiratory disease outcomes. (36,37). It is suggested that those 
343 
genetically susceptible may be at a higher risk of allergies and respiratory outcomes when 
344 
exposed to farming and such groups may select themselves out of farming populations. 
345 
Interestingly, we observed those with farming exposure to have a lower prevalence of family 
346 
history of allergies supporting this hypothesis.  
347 
 
348 
Our recent review consolidated published literature showing significant interactions between 
349 
CD14 gene polymorphisms and environmental microbial exposures with evidence of a protective 
350 
effect on atopic disease in childhood.(37) Additional evidence has also shown that the expression 
351 
of toll like receptor 2 (TLR2) genes may differ between farm and non-farm children, and it is 
352 
believed that some TLRs may act through various pathways to modify risk of allergic or 
353 
respiratory diseases.(38,39) It has also been hypothesized that polymorphisms in oxidative stress 
354 
 16 
 
genes may play a role in gene-environmental pollutant interactions that impact allergic and 
355 
respiratory disease. However, investigations into the modification of respiratory disease risk 
356 
through an altered oxidative stress response related to genetic variants of NAD(P)H:quinone 
357 
acceptor oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes, have shown 
358 
mixed results. (40)   The above discussion highlights that multiple genes may modify the role in 
359 
the observed ‘farm effect’, and that future research into this field needs to take into account a 
360 
number of potential environmental and genetic modifiers.  
361 
 
362 
The strengths of our study is that it is a well-powered multinational study on adult asthma and 
363 
atopy, which collected various exposure data and objective clinical measures of atopic 
364 
sensitization and lung function by a standardized protocol. The potential limitations of this study 
365 
are survey data on early-life exposures were collected retrospectively and no objective measures 
366 
of microbial diversity were available for comparison. Residual confounding, stemming from a 
367 
wide variety of exposures associated with different living environments as mentioned above may 
368 
also be present in this analysis. These uncontrolled confounders may all contribute to the 
369 
observed “farm effect” in a unique way, that should be teased out in future investigations.   
370 
Finally, self-selection out of farm life for those with a family history of allergic disease can 
371 
present bias. Although we have adjusted for a family history of allergic disease in our analyses, 
372 
an amount of residual confounding may remain based on the severity of allergic disease 
373 
symptoms. Without further exploration into early life clinical outcomes such as lung function or 
374 
age at disease onset we are unable to completely determine whether effects on adult lung function 
375 
or disease are arising as a result of the direct effect of childhood farm exposure on adult health or 
376 
mediated through distinct effects on childhood disease. It is also possible that adult exposures, 
377 
such as occupational or home environment, may modify the effect of early life exposures on adult 
378 
 17 
 
disease, however no significant interactions were observed between early life home environment 
379 
and adult cleaning or agriculture occupations in these analyses. 
380 
 
381 
Conclusions 
382 
Consistently across 14 countries, this analysis shows that early-life exposure to farm 
383 
environments is protective against subsequent adult allergic diseases. The consistency of the 
384 
findings across multi-country settings suggests that farming effects may be due to biological 
385 
mechanisms rather than socio-cultural effects that would differ between countries. A novel 
386 
finding was that women who grew up on a farm had higher lung function, and only mild 
387 
heterogeneity was observed across 14 countries. Further work is necessary to explain gender 
388 
differences. Our analysis further showed protective effects of markers of microbial diversity 
389 
(pets, siblings, day care etc) in persons with an inner city background, however, not as strong as 
390 
protective effects related to farm upbringing.  Future studies should aim to discern critical farm 
391 
exposures that drive the association with sensitization by exploring the microbial components of 
392 
farm environments through molecular studies.
