Eradication of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and persister
cells using an electrochemical scaffold and enhanced antibiotic
susceptibility
Sujala T Sultana1, Douglas R Call2 and Haluk Beyenal1
Biofilms in chronic wounds are known to contain a persister subpopulation that exhibits enhanced multidrug tolerance and can
quickly rebound after therapeutic treatment. The presence of these “persister cells” is partly responsible for the failure of antibiotic
therapies and incomplete elimination of biofilms. Electrochemical methods combined with antibiotics have been suggested as an
effective alternative for biofilm and persister cell elimination, yet the mechanism of action for improved antibiotic efficacy remains
unclear. In this work, an electrochemical scaffold (e-scaffold) that electrochemically generates a constant concentration of H2O2 was
investigated as a means of enhancing tobramycin susceptibility in pre-grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms and attacking
persister cells. Results showed that the e-scaffold enhanced tobramycin susceptibility in P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms, which reached
a maximum susceptibility at 40 µg/ml tobramycin, with complete elimination (7.8-log reduction vs control biofilm cells, P ≤ 0.001).
Moreover, the e-scaffold eradicated persister cells in biofilms, leaving no viable cells (5-log reduction vs control persister cells,
P ≤ 0.001). It was observed that the e-scaffold induced the intracellular formation of hydroxyl free radicals and improved membrane
permeability in e-scaffold treated biofilm cells, which possibly enhanced antibiotic susceptibility and eradicated persister cells.
These results demonstrate a promising advantage of the e-scaffold in the treatment of persistent biofilm infections.

INTRODUCTION
Chronic and recalcitrant biofilm infections on wounds are often
caused by the presence of a bacterial subpopulation of “persister
cells” that are particularly tolerant to bacteriostatic antibiotics.1
Biofilms protect bacterial communities in part because the
extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that form the biofilm
matrix serve as a diffusion barrier.2 This barrier limits antibiotic
penetration
into
biofilms3
and
immobilizes
antibiotics.4
In
addition, the diffusive barrier results in nutrient gradients, causing
decreased growth and metabolic inactivity in parts of the biofilm
community, which allows persister cells to arise.1 In particular,
increased persister cell formation is observed in Gram-negative
bacterial biofilms because the bacterial cell membranes are
composed of lipopolysaccharides that further limit antibiotic
penetration into the cells5.
In
lieu
of
classical
antibiotics,
a
number
of
alternative
antimicrobial treatments are being explored either individually
(e.g., silver,6 mannitol7) or in combination with conventional
antibiotics.8–10
Unfortunately,
high
concentrations
of
these
antimicrobials/antibiotics have toxic side effects11,12 while at
low concentrations they often decompose before completely
eliminating biofilm communities.13 Moreover, any persister cells
can regrow and form biofilms with potentially enhanced tolerance
to antibiotics.14 Interestingly, the application of an antibiotic in
combination with a direct current (DC) (ranging from µA to
mA/cm2)
can
be
effective
against
several
Gram-negative
bacteria,15,16 including against putative persister cells.16 The
mechanism underlying this effect was unclear until a recent study
demonstrated
the
presence
of
electrochemically
generated
H2O2.17 In that study, an electrochemical scaffold (e-scaffold)
made of conductive carbon fabric generated ~25 µM H2O2 near
the surface of the e-scaffold and this was sufficient to reduce an
A. baumannii biofilm (~3-log) that was established on a dermal
explant. The constant but relatively low production of H2O2 did
not appear to be cytotoxic to the mammalian tissue.17
A similar study demonstrated that electrochemically generated
H2O2 is sufficient to prevent or delay Pseudomonas aeruginosa
PAO1 biofilm growth in vitro18 despite the production of two
important catalase enzymes (katA and katB) that can protect
P. aeruginosa from H2O2.19 Nevertheless, complete elimination of
mature P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms by e-scaffold treatment can
be difficult. Adjunct antibiotic treatment can be helpful,16 but the
mechanism underlying this combined effect is not understood.15
For instance, Nodzo et al. reported an enhanced efficacy of
vancomycin when it was combined with a cathodic potential of
− 1.8 VAg/AgCl against biofilms formed on Ti implants in a rodent
model, but did not report any mechanism.20 Niepa et al. reported
that a stainless steel (SS304) electrode released metal cations that
enhanced antibiotic efficacy against P. aeruginosa PAO1 persister
cells in an electrochemical system applying ~70 µA/cm2 DC.16
Under this condition, it is likely that SS304 corroded and released
iron ions.21 A similar increased efficacy of antibiotic was reported

 when an inert carbon electrode under the same applied DC was
used against P. aeruginosa PAO1 persister cells in the same
system.22 An inert carbon electrode does not release metal cations
as SS304 does; thus, the release of metal cations is unlikely to be
the mechanism for the efficacy of a combination of DC and
antibiotic treatment.22 The authors speculated that electrochemi-
cally generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) (e.g., H2O2 and OH•)
were responsible for this effect, but they did not confirm this
experimentally.22
An e-scaffold generates H2O2, which enters the bacterial
periplasm through porins,23,24 where it can induce intracellular
production of highly reactive hydroxyl free radicals (OH•)25,26 that
degrade membrane lipids, proteins, and DNA.26,27 Recent research
also found that H2O2 eliminates some of the persister cells in
biofilms, facilitates the disruption of biofilm architecture and
mediates the generation of metabolically active dispersal cells in a
range of Gram-negative bacterial biofilms.28,29 Such metabolic
activity in surviving dispersal cells and OH• production have
been
reported
to
induce
bacterial
sensitivity
to
antibiotic
treatment.30–32 Therefore, e-scaffold generated H2O2 possibly
promotes intracellular OH• production that in turn improves
antibiotic sensitivity in biofilms and attacks persister cells.
In this work, we used P. aeruginosa PAO1 with an aminoglyco-
side antibiotic (tobramycin). P. aeruginosa PAO1 can resist
tobramycin by producing periplasmic glucans, mutations of
ribosome-binding sites or increased efflux pump action inhibiting
cellular
uptake.33
Furthermore,
P.
aeruginosa
PAO1
biofilm
persister cells are reportedly less sensitive to tobramycin.9 We
isolated persister cells from P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms after
treating them with ciprofloxacin following published proto-
cols.16,34 We hypothesized that the bacterial subpopulation that
survived e-scaffold generated H2O2 would be more sensitive to
tobramycin than these ciprofloxacin-tolerant persister cells. The
objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the tobramycin
susceptibility of P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms treated with an,
e-scaffold and compare it with the tobramycin susceptibility of
persister cells, (2) to evaluate the efficacy of the e-scaffold against
persister cells and (3) to determine whether e-scaffold treatment
would increase intracellular production of OH• radicals and
increase membrane permeability in the bacterial cells, making
them more susceptible to antibiotics. In addition, change in
bacterial cell morphology after e-scaffold treatment was observed
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Finally, based on these
observations, a possible mechanism of e-scaffold enhanced
antibiotic susceptibility is proposed and a future mechanistic
study is suggested.
RESULTS
Electrochemical scaffold enhances tobramycin susceptibility in
biofilm cells
When biofilm treatments were combined with different concen-
trations of tobramycin, the surviving cells responded differently.
The tobramycin susceptibility of P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms
regrown from fresh culture, untreated biofilm cells, and persister
cells isolated from biofilms appeared to follow a dose response at
tested concentrations between 0 and 40 µg/ml (Fig. 1). The
biofilms regrown from persister cells showed tolerance to
tobramycin, with only a (1.2 ± 0.16)-log reduction in viable cells
for 10 µg/ml tobramycin and no further significant decrease at
higher concentrations.
These
persister
cells had the
same
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) as the fresh culture
(Supplementary
information);
however,

the
characteristic behavior of “persister cells”, they survived antibiotic

identical to their regular population.1,35 Interestingly, tobramycin
tolerance was observed in biofilms regrown from untreated
biofilm cells and persister cells isolated from biofilms. In contrast,
no tolerance to tobramycin was identified for biofilms regrown
from e-scaffold treated cells when different concentrations of
tobramycin were combined with e-scaffold treatment (Fig. 1). This
confirms the prevention of persistence by the e-scaffold. A linear
dose response was observed for the log reduction of e-scaffold
treated biofilm cells which received tobramycin treatment, leading
to a complete eradication at 40 µg/ml tobramycin (Fig. 1). This
concentration (20×MIC) is still considerably lower than what is
typically required for P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm treatment with
tobramycin (>500× of MIC) as reported in the literature.36 Overall,
a significant increase in tobramycin susceptibility was attained for
e-scaffold treated biofilms compared to biofilms that were not
treated with an e-scaffold (P < 0.05, paired t-tests) (Fig. 1). Among
the tested tobramycin concentrations, we observed a maximum
tobramycin susceptibility at 40 µg/ml in e-scaffold treated biofilms
compared to that for persister cells.
Electrochemical scaffold eradicates persister cells
The effect of e-scaffold generated H2O2 on P. aeruginosa PAO1
persister cells isolated from ciprofloxacin-treated biofilms was
explored. As Fig. 2 shows, ~0.31 % of the total biofilm cells
belonged to the persister population, which is in the range
reported in the literature.37 Within 6 h of these persister cells
being treated with an e-scaffold, no viable persister cells were
apparent. This corresponds to a 5-log reduction in persistence
compared to the control initial persister cells (P ≤ 0.001, one-way
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni test). No growth was observed
even after the treated cells were exposed to fresh medium alone
for 24 h upon removal of the e-scaffold. This confirmed complete
eradication of persister cells by e-scaffold treatment. In contrast,
the final population of persister cells did not change within the
additional 6 h of ciprofloxacin treatment. The e-scaffold was also
found to be effective against total biofilm cells, with (4.2 ± 0.23)
and (4.95 ± 0.20)-log reductions in viable cells within 6 and 24 h of
treatment, respectively, compared to the control final biofilm cells.
Together these results suggest that the e-scaffold is effective
against both regular biofilm cells in active states and persister cells
in inactive metabolic states. They also confirm that persister

 cells are inherently more sensitive to e-scaffold generated H2O2
exposure.
E-scaffold induces OH• generation and increases membrane
permeability
We observed increased fluorescence for both e-scaffold treated
and exogenous H2O2 treated biofilm cells, indicating enhanced
OH• formation after e-scaffold generated H2O2 treatment (Fig. 3a).
Furthermore, an increase in the propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence
of e-scaffold treated cells was observed compared to untreated
biofilm cells (Fig. 3b). PI is a membrane-impermeable dye and can
only enter a bacterial cell if the outer membrane is damaged.
It can permeate the cytoplasm and bind to the DNA, showing an
increased fluorescence intensity, only upon disruption of the cell
membranes by the e-scaffold.22,38 Thus, an increase in PI intensity
corresponds to an increased membrane permeability. Figure 3b
shows that PI permeability increased in e-scaffold treated cells,
indicating possible damage to the outer cell membrane by the
e-scaffold. Increased membrane permeability was additionally
verified using 3,3′-dipropylthiacarbocyanine iodide, a membrane
potential sensitive dye. An increase in the fluorescence intensity of
3,3′-dipropylthiacarbocyanine iodide was observed in e-scaffold
treated cells compared to untreated biofilm cells (Fig. 3c),
indicating membrane depolarization after exposure to e-scaffold.
The dissipation of the membrane potential may be caused by the

enters only depolarized cells, where it binds reversibly to
lipid-rich intracellular components.40 The increased fluorescence
intensity of this dye in e-scaffold treated cells (Fig. 3c) indicates
that the e-scaffold disrupted the cytoplasmic membrane and that
this induced depolarization of the plasma membrane potential.
Thus Fig. 3 suggests that the e-scaffold increased membrane
permeability, possibly upon the membrane integrity of the cells
being compromised by OH•.
Additionally, membrane-compromised cells similar to those in
exogenous H2O2 treated samples were observed in e-scaffold
treated samples in SEM images (Fig. 4). Similar deformation was
observed previously by Istanbullu et al. in cells treated with
electrochemically generated H2O2
18 and by DeQueiroz et al. and
Diao et al. in cells treated with exogenous H2O2.41 Untreated
biofilm cells showed intact cell walls and membranes (Fig. 4). Thus,
Fig. 4 indicates e-scaffold generated H2O2 induced morphological
changes in cells and structural damage of the outer membrane
that might increase membrane permeability.42,43
DISCUSSION
Electrochemical method combined with antibiotic has been
suggested to be effective against biofilms in several previous
studies, yet the mechanism behind this increased antibiotic
efficacy remains unclear.15,44 In this work, an e-scaffold that

 electrochemically generates a constant concentration H2O2 was
investigated as a mean of enhancing antibiotic efficacy against
biofilm cells and its efficacy against ciprofloxacin-tolerant persister
cells was evaluated. Overall, our results indicate that the e-scaffold
induced intracellular formation of OH• and improved membrane
permeability. These mechanisms enhanced tobramycin efficacy,
including against persister cells.
The biofilm removal mechanism of e-scaffolds is electro-
chemical generation of H2O2, which is a potential biocide and
oxidizing agent.17 H2O2 mediates dispersal in biofilms, disrupts
various bacterial processes and cellular networks, and disrupts the
cell envelope through intracellular production of ROS such as OH•
in Gram-negative bacteria,
as
shown
in Fig.
5.26,28,45
Our
observations suggest that e-scaffold generated H2O2 increases
intracellular OH• formation in Gram-negative P. aeruginosa PAO1
biofilm cells. Furthermore, in membrane permeability assays and
SEM image analysis, we observed increased permeability with
moderate membrane damage in cells after e-scaffold treatment.
Thus, we propose that when e-scaffold generated H2O2 enters a
bacterial cell, it induces intracellular ROS production such as OH•,
which can increase the permeability of bacterial membranes.26,27
Increased permeability can facilitate better antibiotic penetration.
These effects can potentiate the tobramycin susceptibility of
P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms and eradicate persister cells in various
metabolic states.31,46
That the e-scaffold increases the permeability of the outer
membrane of Gram-negative bacteria opens up the possibility of
enhancing susceptibility to a range of antibiotics. As noted above,
recent papers questioned the role of electric current in electro-
chemically generating H2O2 that enhanced antibiotic susceptibility
in biofilms and associated persister cells.15,22,47 It has already been
confirmed that an e-scaffold at a constant applied potential
(−600 mVAg/AgCl) electrochemically generates H2O2, which is the
mechanism of action for biofilm removal.17 Here, we explained
that e-scaffold generated H2O2 can lead to intracellular OH•
production in bacteria that possibly enhances the efficacy of
tobramycin
against
P.
aeruginosa
PAO1
biofilms
and
thus
eradicates biofilms and associated persister cells.
The observed effect of increased intracellular OH• formation as a
possible mechanism for enhanced antibiotic susceptibility in
bacteria needs to be further confirmed by more mechanistic
studies. For instance, decreasing OH• through the addition of
thiourea (150 mM), an OH• scavenger,48 inhibited bacterial cell
death due to e-scaffold and tobramycin (Fig. S2, Supplementary
information), indicating that OH• production may be critical for the
observed bactericidal activity. Additionally, overexpression of
cellular ROS scavengers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) can
be used to inhibit e-scaffold induced OH• formation and bacterial
cell death. Thus, it can be verified whether OH• formation is a
critical factor for the observed bacterial killing by e-scaffold and
tobramycin. As indicated in Fig. 5, OH• formation occurs through
the Fenton reaction and Fe2+ plays a vital role in this reaction.
Testing the efficacy of e-scaffold and tobramycin against mutant
strains with impaired iron regulation would be another way to
confirm OH• formation as the fundamental mechanism for e-
scaffold enhanced antibiotic susceptibility.38
Finally, this research proposes future use of the e-scaffold as an
effective individual or adjuvant therapy against persistent biofilm
infections. Notably, the application of AC and DC electric fields
combined with antibiotics involves a different mechanism49 than
that of the electrochemical biofilm control method proposed in
this work.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Growth medium, chemicals, and antibiotics
For all experiments, 20 g/L (1×) Luria broth (LB) medium (Sigma-Aldrich,
catalog #L3522) was used to grow overnight P. aeruginosa PAO1 cultures
and 1 g/L (0.05×) LB was used as the growth medium for biofilms.

respectively. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined
for both antibiotics following the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
Institute (CLSI) protocol as detailed in Supplementary information.50 Other
key compounds included 3′-p-hydroxyphenyl fluorescein dye (Invitrogen,
catalog #H36004), propidium iodide (Invitrogen, catalog #L-7012), 3,
3′-dipropylthiacarbocyanine iodide (Sigma Aldrich, catalog #318434),
thiourea (AK Scientific, Inc., catalog #S726) and H2O2 (VWR, catalog
#RC3819-16).
Culture and biofilm preparation
Frozen stocks of P. aeruginosa PAO1 were cultured overnight in LB at 37 °C
on a rotating table (70 rpm). For biofilm experiments, overnight culture
was adjusted to OD600≈ 0.5 in LB and used as inoculum.17 Briefly, 2 ml of
culture was used to inoculate sterile glass bottom petri dishes (MatTek
Corporation, catalog #P35G-1.5-20-C) and allowed to form biofilms for 24 h.
These one-day-old biofilms were treated with e-scaffolds for 24 h, as
described previously.17 Briefly, untreated and e-scaffold treated biofilm
cells were washed twice to remove loosely attached cells and then
remaining cells were recovered for antibiotic susceptibility testing. To
identify and isolate P. aeruginosa PAO1 persister cells, planktonic culture
was grown to the stationary phase and the dose-dependent killing curve
for ciprofloxacin (0–200 μg/mL) was investigated (Supplementary informa-
tion, Fig. S1).34 A plateau of the surviving subpopulation was observed for
ciprofloxacin concentrations above 50 μg/mL (200× of MIC), and these
were identified as persister cells.34,51 We assessed the antibiotic treatment
on biofilms from three different populations: cells recovered after no
treatment (“untreated biofilms”), cells recovered after e-scaffold treatment
(“e-scaffold treated biofilm”) and “persister cells” that were isolated from
biofilms treated with 200 μg/mL ciprofloxacin for 3.5 h according to a
published
protocol.34
For
experiments
with
persister
cells,
the
ciprofloxacin-treated biofilms were washed and refreshed with 0.9 % NaCl
for subsequent experiments. This method for culture, biofilm preparation
and treatments is illustrated in Fig. 6.
Biofilm treatment with e-scaffold
P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms were exposed to e-scaffold treatment for 24 h,
as described previously.17 Briefly, a custom-built e-scaffold was fabricated
using carbon fabric as detailed in Supplementary information.17 Biofilms
were carefully washed (2×) with LB (0.05×) and an e-scaffold was overlaid
onto the biofilms followed by 4 mL of fresh medium. A standard Ag/AgCl
(saturated KCl) reference electrode was introduced to apply a constant
potential (-600 mVAg/AgCl) to an e-scaffold using a Gamry Series G 300
potentiostat (Gamry Instruments, Warminster, PA, USA) to reduce oxygen,
generate a low concentration of H2O2 and deliver it continuously to the
biofilms (Fig. 6a). After treatment, the viable cell counts were determined
using a modified drop-plate cell counting method.17,52 Loosely attached
cells were removed by carefully washing the biofilms with 0.9 % NaCl
before they were resuspended in 5 mL of 0.9 % NaCl and vortexed for 30 s.
These suspensions were centrifuged (4180 × g for 10 min), and the
resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of 0.9 % NaCl. Aliquots
(250 µL) were then serially diluted, and 10 µL of each dilution was plated
onto LB agar. Plates were incubated for 24 h (37 °C), and colony-forming
units (CFU) were enumerated.
Tobramycin susceptibility of e-scaffold treated cells
To determine whether e-scaffold treatment altered susceptibility to
antibiotics,35 biofilm treatments were combined with tobramycin treat-
ments. For this experiment, the recovered biofilm cells were harvested
(Fig. 6b) and adjusted to OD600≈ 0.5 in LB medium (0.05×). A 1-mL cell
suspension was used to inoculate a 24-well plate, where biofilms were
allowed to form. Biofilms were treated with an e-scaffold for 2 h. Each well
was then washed (2×) and challenged with 1 mL of one of the test
concentrations (5, 10, 20 and 40 µg/mL) of tobramycin for 6 h. After
treatment, the cells were washed (2×), resuspended in 0.9 % NaCl and
processed to enumerate CFU.52 Cell counts were compared for e-scaffold
and other treated and untreated biofilms. The treatments are summarized
in Fig. 6b.
Effect of e-scaffold on persister cells
Biofilms were grown for 24 h in 6-well plates and treated with 200 μg/mL
ciprofloxacin for 3.5 h to isolate persister cells from ciprofloxacin-treated
biofilms.16
The

to either 200 μg/ml ciprofloxacin or e-scaffold treatment for 6 h (in the
0.9 % NaCl solution). Final CFU numbers were then determined following
the procedure described above. Figure 6c summarizes the treatment
methodology we used.
Hydroxyl free radical detection assay
Intracellular hydroxyl free radical (OH•) formation was detected using 5 µM
of a fluorescent reporter dye, 3′-(p-hydroxyphenyl fluorescein) (HPF)
(Invitrogen, catalog #H36004) following a published protocol.38 Briefly,
e-scaffold treated, exogenous H2O2-treated and untreated biofilm cells
were vortexed in 500 µL of LB in a microcentrifuge tube for 30 s. These
samples were centrifuged (10,000 × g for 10 min), and then the medium
was replaced with a final concentration of 5 µM HPF prepared in 500 µL of
0.1 M PBS. After staining in the dark at room temperature for 15 min,
samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatant was
removed, and cells were rinsed and resuspended with PBS. An aliquot

Proposed mechanism for e-scaffold generated H2O2 enhancing antibiotic susceptibility. H2O2 generated extracellularly by e-scaffold
diffuses through the bacterial cell envelope and reacts with intracellular Fe2+, forming radicals that oxidize lipids, proteins and DNA, which
prompts cell death. Through membrane damage or changing membrane permeability, antibiotic penetration into the bacterial cell is
increased, which in turn enhances the antibiotic susceptibility of the cells

intensity was quantified using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek Cytation 5) with
excitation at 490 and emission at 515 nm. For the OH• formation
assays, fluorescence was estimated as follows: ((Fluorescence with

Membrane permeability
Change in bacterial membrane permeability was evaluated by analyzing
the influx of a membrane-impermeable dye, propidium iodide (PI)22,38
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, catalog #L-7012).
E-scaffold treated and untreated biofilm cells were centrifuged (6000 rpm,
10 mins) to cell pellets and supernatant was poured off. The cell pellets
were stained with PI for 15 min in the dark, then washed twice with 0.9 %
NaCl to remove any unbound dye. Cells were then resuspended in 0.9 %
NaCl, and 100 µL of each suspension was transferred in triplicate into wells
of a 96-well plate. Fluorescence intensity was quantified (excitation 535
nm, emission 517 nm). Fluorescence was determined as a percentage
change compared to untreated sample using the following formula:
((Fluorescence with dye − Fluorescence without dye)/(Fluorescence with-
out dye))×(100).
Additionally, the effect of e-scaffold treatment on bacterial membrane
permeability was detected using a membrane potential sensitive dye, 3,
3′-dipropylthiacarbocyanine iodide. The fluorescence intensity of 3,
3′-dipropylthiacarbocyanine iodide changes in response to changes in
plasma membrane potential upon structural damage.42,53 Untreated
biofilm cells were washed and then resuspended in buffer A (20 mM
glucose, 5 mM HEPES, pH = 7.2) with 0.1 M KCl. To achieve a stable signal,
3,3′-dipropylthiacarbocyanine
iodide
was
added
to
untreated
and
e-scaffold treated biofilm cell suspensions and incubated for 10 min.
Changes in the fluorescence intensity induced by changes in membrane
potential after exposure to e-scaffold were measured at an excitation
wavelength of 622 nm and an emission wavelength of 670 nm.42 The
measurements were performed in triplicate for three biological replicates
in wells of a 96-well plate. Fluorescence was determined as a percentage
change compared to untreated sample using the following formula:
((Fluorescence with dye − Fluorescence without dye)/(Fluorescence with-
out dye))×(100).
Scanning electron microscopy
For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, biofilms were grown for
24 h on UV-sterilized, 0.22-µm type GV membrane filters (Millipore, catalog
ID #551200401) placed in sterile 6-well plates. Exogenous H2O2 was added
continuously at an average 0.008 mmol/h for 24 h to mimic the e-scaffold
generated H2O2 treatment described previously.17 After treatment for 24 h,
both e-scaffolds and membrane filters with biofilms were aseptically
collected from the untreated, e-scaffold treated and exogenous H2O2
treated wells. The membrane filters and e-scaffolds were fixed overnight
with 2.5 % glutaraldehyde and 2 % paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate
buffer, followed by rinsing with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (3 × 10 min each).
The membranes and e-scaffolds were then dehydrated gradually by being
washed sequentially with 10, 30, 50, 70, and 95 % alcohol (10 min each)
and 100 % alcohol (3 × 10 min each). Hexamethyldisilizane (HMDS) was
used for overnight drying. Samples were then sputter-coated with gold
prior to field emission in-lens scanning electron microscopy (FEISEM)
(FEI 200F) imaging.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were conducted for at least three biologically independent
replicates. Technical replicates were averaged to produce replicate means
that were subsequently used for analysis. Mean values were compared
within
and
between
groups
using
one-way
ANOVA
followed
by
Bonferroni’s post hoc test for individual comparisons. Differences were
considered statistically significant if P < 0.05 (Sigma plot, version 13, Systat
Software, Inc., San Jose, CA).
CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we found that P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms treated with
e-scaffolds do not develop tolerance to tobramycin; thus, e-scaffolds
reduce persistence. Our results indicate that the e-scaffold enhances
tobramycin susceptibility in P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilms and eradicates
isolated persister cells. This appears to be a promising advantage of the
e-scaffold for controlling persister cells. We further showed that the
e-scaffold induces intracellular OH• formation and causes an increase in
membrane permeability and moderate morphological changes in the
bacterial membrane. We propose these effects as the mechanism by which
it enhances tobramycin efficacy. These results demonstrate the potential of
the e-scaffold as an alternative to conventional antibiotic treatment or as
an adjuvant therapy to enhance antibiotic susceptibility in complex and
persistent biofilm infections.
