Abstract
Background: Despite the prediction that temperatures are expected to increase in the future, little is known about
the health effects of increasing temperatures on pregnant women. The objective of this study was to investigate
the impact of apparent temperature on spontaneous preterm delivery (PTD).
Methods: A case-crossover study of 14,466 singleton spontaneous preterm deliveries occurring between January 1,
1995 and December 31, 2009 among Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) members was conducted.
Preterm deliveries were identified through KPNC's Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. Data on gestational age at
delivery, infant sex, and maternal address were also extracted from KPNC's EHR and linked to meteorologic and air
pollution monitoring data based on residential zip code.
Results: An 11.6% (95% CI: 4.1, 19.7) increase in spontaneous PTD was associated with a 10 °F (5.6 °C) increase in
weekly average (lag06) apparent temperature, during the warm season. During the cold season, increases in
apparent temperature did not significantly impact the overall effect of spontaneous PTD (6.2%, (95% CI: -3.0, 16.2)
per 10 °F (5.6 °C) increase in weekly average (lag06) apparent temperature). Significant differences in the
relationship between apparent temperature and spontaneous PTD emerged for region, gestational age and infant
sex, during the cold season. No significant differences emerged for air pollutants.
Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence for an increase in the odds of spontaneous PTD associated with
increases in apparent temperature, especially during the warm season.

Background
Defined as a live birth prior to 37 complete weeks of
gestation, preterm delivery (PTD) is the leading cause of
perinatal morbidity and mortality, accounting for ap-
proximately 30% of early neonatal deaths [1]. In the US
and most developed countries, it is the leading cause for
congenital neurological disabilities including cerebral
palsy, blindness and deafness1-4 [2–5], thus signifying
the impact it has over the life course of those affected.
Each year in the U.S., 12% of live births (~500,000
births) are preterm, resulting in more than $26 billion in
medical care costs [6–9]. The combined impact on
infant health and extraordinary medical costs make PTD
a global health challenge.
The etiology of the majority of preterm births remains
unknown. Maternal depression [10], maternal race/eth-
nicity [11, 12], maternal infections [13, 14], smoking [15,
16] and previous PTD [17] are among several identified
risk factors for preterm birth. More recently, research
has begun to focus on the impact that environmental
factors may have on PTD. Animal models support the
biological plausibility of a relationship between extreme
heat and adverse pregnancy outcomes including early
gestational birth [18–22]. These previous studies give
biologic plausibility to the hypothesis that apparent
temperature may be a contributing factor for the risk of
PTD. However, findings from the limited epidemio-
logical research have been inconsistent [23–32]. Given

 the expected increase in duration and frequency of heat
waves due to climate change and costs of PTD, we in-
vestigated the association between maternal exposure to
apparent temperature and spontaneous PTD over a
16 year time period (1995 through 2009) in Northern
California while taking into account differences by warm
and cold seasons, coastal and inland regions, infant sex
and gestational age.
Methods
A case-cross over study was conducted among the
Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) member
population of women who delivered a singleton, live pre-
term delivery between January 1, 1995 and December
31, 2009. KPNC, a large group practice within an inte-
grated health care delivery system, provides comprehen-
sive medical services to over 3.6 million members and
has approximately 37,000 deliveries in a 14-county re-
gion per year. Coverage is provided for approximately
30% of the northern California population and is similar
demographically, racially and ethnically to the popula-
tion living in the geographic area [33, 34]. KPNC has
well established automated clinical databases that cap-
ture delivery dates and gestational age at delivery.
The time-stratified case-crossover approach has been
utilized in previous research assessing various acute
outcomes associated with meteorologic exposures and
air pollution [26, 35, 36]. Briefly, in the case-crossover
method each person serves as his/her own control, thus
time in-variant factors both known (e.g., race/ethnicity)
and unknown are adjusted for by design [37]. Apparent
temperature for the seven days prior to the infant’s birth
was considered the exposure period for the mother. The
control periods for each mother consisted of seven day
intervals during the same month and year of the infant’s
birth and were limited to the same day of the week as
the birth. Each mother could have up to a maximum of
4 control periods.
Meteorologic and air pollution data were ascertained
through linkage to various databases including the
California Irrigation Management Information System
[38], the US Environmental Protection Agency Air
Quality System [39], and the California Air Resources
Board [40]. To examine the relationship between appar-
ent temperature and PTD, we included all live, non-
induced preterm deliveries. The study was approved by
the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Internal
Review Board.
Ascertainment of PTD
Gestational age at delivery was ascertained from clinical
databases and based on best clinical estimate, first day of
last menstrual period (LMP) and ultrasound. In more re-
cent years gestational age is primarily based on ultrasound.
Live births to women <18 years of age, whose zip code was
not available in the EHR, who did not have a valid gesta-
tional date (e.g., <16 weeks, >45 weeks, or missing (<1% of
live births)), or who had a multiple gestation were
excluded. Additionally, only a woman’s first birth during
this time period was included to avoid non-independent
observations. PTD was defined as a live birth prior to 37
complete weeks of gestation. Deliveries induced preterm
because of pregnancy complications were excluded as de-
fined by the following ICD9 codes (73.0, 73.01, 73.09,
73.1x, 73.4x, and 74.x (without codes indicating labor or
spontaneous delivery)) [41]. A flowchart outlining the in-
clusion/exclusion criteria is included in Fig. 1.
Ascertainment of apparent temperature
Meteorological data consisting of daily mean, maximum
and minimum temperatures and relative humidity and
dew point temperatures were ascertained and used to cal-
culate apparent temperature with the following formula
[42]: ‐ 2.653 + (0.994 × temperature in ° C) + 0.0153 × (dew ‐
point temperature in ° C)2. Each mother was assigned the
resulting apparent temperature value from the weather
monitor closest to the reported residential zip code cen-
troid at the time she gave birth. Cases residing in zip codes
with centroids located outside 20 km of a weather moni-
tor were ineligible for this
study (7%). Please see
Additional file 1: Figure S1 for a map of the temperature
monitors in the study area.
Ascertainment of potential confounders and effect
modifiers
Maximum daily data from air pollution monitors were
provided by the California Air Resources Board [43].
The pollution monitor closest to each mother's residen-
tial zip code centroid was used to assign exposure to
carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur
dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3), restricting cases to those
residing within 10 km for analyses. For particulate mat-
ter (PM2.5) the mean daily data were provided.
Effect modifiers considered were region (coastal versus
inland regions), gestational age (severe preterm (<35 weeks),
moderate preterm (35-36 weeks), and near term (>36,
<37 weeks)) and infant sex (male, female).
Statistical analysis
Conditional logistic regression was conducted using a
linear term for apparent temperature and preterm birth
as the outcome separately for each county based on resi-
dential zip code. A random-effects meta-analysis was
performed to calculate an overall estimate [44]. All esti-
mates are reported as percent change per 10 °F (5.6 °C) in-
crease in apparent temperature with corresponding 95%
confidence intervals. Given that apparent temperature is
not linear year round but is linear during warm and cold

 seasons, all analyses were stratified by warm season (deliv-
eries between May 1 and October 31) and cold season
(deliveries between November 1 and April 31). Counties
with less than 5 PTD cases after stratification were ex-
cluded from the respective analysis. Conditional logistic
regression in SAS version 9.3 was used to conduct the first
stage of the analysis, and STATA version 10.1 was used for
the meta-analyses.
The
mean,
maximum
and
minimum
apparent
temperature for 6-single day lags (lag 1, lag 2, lag 3, lag
4, lag 5, and lag 6), and 3 cumulative average lag pe-
riods (lag01, lag03, lag06) were examined to determine
the best fit model. The best fit model criterion was
based on a combination of the -2 logL statistic (devi-
ance) and potential biological underlying mechanisms
for the relationship between temperature and PTD. The
single-day lags represent apparent temperature on the
previous day(s) (e.g., lag 1 refers to the apparent
temperature on the previous day, lag 2 refers to the
apparent temperature 2 days prior, etc). The cumulative
lag periods represent averages of several days (e.g.,
lag06 represents the exposure on the same day and the
previous 6 days).
To assess confounding by air pollutants, the maximum
lag01 for each of the air pollutants (mean lag01 for
PM2.5)was included in a separate model with apparent
temperature and PTD and compared to the unadjusted
model. Potential effect modification by air pollutants
was assessed by including an interaction term between
apparent temperature and the maximum lag01 of each
air pollutant (mean lag01 for PM2.5), in five distinct
models. As tests for interaction generally have less
power to test for statistical significance [45], a priori a
p-value < 0.10 was considered as statistically significant.
We used the best fit model to examine other potential
effect modifiers of high apparent temperature and PTD
including region (coastal versus inland), and gestational
age at delivery (severe preterm (<35 weeks), moderate

 preterm (35-36 weeks), and near term (>36, <37 weeks)
deliveries), and by infant sex. All analyses were con-
ducted separately for the cold and warm season.
Post hoc analysis
Given evidence suggesting an increase in health risk for
early term gestations, we conducted additional analyses
assessing the relationship between apparent temperature
and births between 37-38 weeks gestation.
Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was conducted to address the poten-
tial of fixed cohort bias impacting our findings [46]. The
association between increasing apparent temperature and
PTD was assessed for both the warm and cold season
restricting the sample to women with conception
dates between August 28, 1994 (19 weeks before the
cohort started) and March 5, 2009 (43 weeks before
the cohort ended).
Results
The study population included 14,466 spontaneous pre-
term births (6,497 during the warm season and 7,969
during the cold season) and their characteristics are
shown in Table 1. A majority of the women in the study
were between 25- 34 years of age (54%), or White (40%).
For the warm season, the mean, 5th percentile and 95th
percentile values for the case mean, minimum, and max-
imum apparent temperature, as well as maximum ozone,
carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and
mean particulate matter PM2.5 are listed by county in

The cumulative average weekly lag (lag06) provided the
best fit model for the mean, maximum and minimum ap-
parent temperatures (Figs. 2a and b) for both the warm
and cold seasons. However, during the warm season an el-
evated odds of PTD was also associated with other
temperature metrics occurring on 4, 5 and 6 days prior to
delivery. Given the mean apparent temperature provided
the best fit model across lags, the average weekly lag06 for
the mean apparent temperature was chosen for the
following analyses by warm and cold season.
During the warm season, an 11.6% (95% CI: 4.1%,
19.7%) increase in spontaneous PTD was associated with
a 10 °F (5.6 °C) increase in weekly average (lag06) mean
apparent temperature (Fig. 3a). An elevated odds of
PTD was noted for the coastal region (12.75%, 95%CI:
3.05%, 23.37%) with a trend emerging in inland regions
(7.25%, 95%CI: -7.69%, 25.86%). Differences between the
estimates for coastal versus inland region were non-
significant (p = 0.59). A 22.1% increase in the odds of
PTD was found for near term PTD (95% CI: 4.1%,
44.8%) and a 12.8% increase was noted for severe pre-
term deliveries. A non-significant increase in the odds of
PTD was found for moderate preterm deliveries (9.4%,
95% CI: -2.0%, 24.6%). Differences between the timing of
delivery were not significant (p =0.31 between near term
and moderate preterm deliveries). Female infants had a
slightly more elevated odds (13.9%, 95% CI: 4.1%, 25.9%)
but they were not significantly different from that of
male infants (10.5%, 95% CI: 1.01%, 20.9%; p = 0.66).
A non-significant elevated odds of spontaneous PTD
was found during the cold season (6.2%, (95% CI: -3.0%,
16.2%) per 10 °F (5.6 °C) increase in weekly average
(lag06) mean apparent temperature) (Fig. 3b). A differ-
ential odds of PTD was found by region (p = 0.08). For
the coastal region, a 12.8% (95% CI: 3.1%, 23.4%)
increase in PTD emerged, however a slightly non-
significant decreased odds was noted for the inland
region (-4.9%, 95%CI: -20.5%, 12.75%). The strongest im-
pact of mean apparent temperature on the gestational
age of delivery was observed for near term deliveries
(24.6%, 95% CI: 5.1%, 49.2%) which was significantly dif-
ferent from moderate preterm deliveries (0.00%, 95%CI:
-9.5%, 10.52%; p = 0.04), although not statistically differ-
ent from severe preterm deliveries (5.1%, 95% CI: -4.9%,
17.4%, p = 0.11). A significant elevated odds was found
for female infants (13.88%, 95% CI: 3.05%, 25.9%),
whereas male infants had a slightly elevated, but non-
significant increased odds (1.01%, 95% CI: -7.7%, 10.5%).
Differences between the estimates by infant sex were
significant (p = 0.01).
Air pollutant data was available on a subset of women
ranging from 8% (PM2.5) to 80% (ozone) during the
warm season and 17.3% (PM2.5) to 74% (ozone) during
the cold season. No significant confounding was found
for air pollutant data in either the warm or cold season
(Figs. 4a and b). There was no significant interaction be-
tween mean apparent temperature and any air pollutant
on the odds of PTD for either the warm or cold season.
A non-significant 4.1% (95% CI: -1%, 6.2%) increase
in the odds of spontaneous early term births was asso-
ciated with a 10 °F (5.6 °C) increase in weekly average
(lag06) mean apparent temperature, during the warm
season. During the cold season, there was no associ-
ation between an increase in weekly average (lag06)
mean apparent temperature and early term births (0%
(95% CI: -3.9%, 5.1%)).
Our sensitivity analysis indicated an 11.6% (95% CI:
3.0%, 22.1%) increase in spontaneous PTD associated
with a 10 °F (5.6 °C) increase in weekly average (lag06)
mean apparent temperature during the warm season.
During the
cold
season,
a non-significant increase
emerged (6.2% (95% CI: -3.0%, 17.4%)).
Discussion
We observed an increase in the odds of spontaneous PTD
associated with escalations in apparent temperature, espe-
cially during the warm season. Our sensitivity analyses
replicated these results, further supporting our findings.
An increase in the mean, minimum and maximum appar-
ent temperature over the six days prior to delivery (lag06)
were all significantly associated with an increase in PTD.
However, an elevated odds of PTD associated with other
temperature metrics was also noted specifically those for
4, 5 and 6 days prior to delivery, as opposed to more prox-
imal days to delivery. During the cold season, increases in
apparent temperature did not significantly impact the
overall effect of PTD. Our findings suggest that during the
warm season, it may take exposure to a week of increases
in the average apparent temperature to impact spontan-
eous PTD.
The differences highlighted between seasons in our
study may help explain the ambiguity of the relationship
between increases in apparent temperature and PTD
that has emerged in the literature. With one exception
[47], studies conducted in more temperate climates such
as Montreal, London and Germany [25, 29, 48] failed to
Avalos et al. Environmental Health  (2017) 16:5 
Page 7 of 13
 find a heat-related effect on preterm deliveries. Yet, a
majority of the research conducted in warmer climate
regions has noted an increase in preterm labor and/or
deliveries associated with increases in apparent temperature
[23, 26–28, 30, 31]. Only one study in warmer climate failed
to find a relationship [32]. It is possible that there is a

 minimum threshold at which heat triggers a labor response
resulting in PTD, yet more research needs to be done to
confirm this hypothesis.
Women living in coastal regions were impacted more by
increases in apparent temperatures, especially during the
cold season. Although a significant differential effect did
not occur during the warm season, we noted a similar
trend. This is of interest given the higher temperatures
that women are exposed to inland compared to in coastal
regions. In Northern California, homes in the coastal re-
gion are less likely to have air conditioning [49]. Thus one
possible explanation for these findings is that women

Delivery during the Warm Season, Overall and by Region, Preterm Delivery Timing and Infant Sex. b Estimated Percent Change Associated with a

 living in these areas may have fewer opportunities to pro-
tect themselves from increases in heat. Another explan-
ation could be biological acclimatization as women who
live in inland regions are used to hotter temperatures.
Increases in temperature appeared to have the stron-
gest impact on severe and near term preterm deliveries,
especially during the cold season. We acknowledge that
small cell sizes increase the possibility that these findings

 may be due to chance. Few studies have evaluated the
timing of the PTD and the findings have not been con-
sistent [23, 26, 28]. While two studies [24, 26] found
preterm births occurring later in pregnancy had greater
associations than those occurring earlier, an additional
study [23] found stronger associations for preterm de-
liveries occurring earlier. The final study that found an
association
with
later
PTD
assessed
all
deliveries
between 28 and 37 weeks gestation together [28].
Additionally, although inconsistent with another study,
our posthoc analyses did not appear to support a rela-
tionship between increasing temperatures and early
term births [26].
Finally, similar to several other studies [23, 26, 28, 47]
we found an association between apparent air temperature
and PTD independent of air pollutants.
Biological mechanism
A clear biological mechanism underlying escalations in
temperature and preterm birth is currently unknown.
Animal models have documented an increase in two
hormones as a result of heat exposure stress (prostaglan-
din F2α (PGF2α) and oxytocin) [19–21], which are also
associated with labor induction in humans [50–54]. Heat
related stress also leads to an increase in heat-shock
proteins (HSP) [55] which have been linked to PTD
[56, 57]. The effects of HSP on PTD may be due to
pro-inflammatory cytokines impacting prostaglandin
E2 secretion which is known to be involved in initi-
ation of parturition [58–60]. Additionally, dehydration
caused by heat exposure can constrict uterine blood
flow, and increase pituitary secretion of antidiuretic hor-
mones and the labor inducing hormone, oxytocin [61].
Heat stress may exacerbate the potential inefficient
thermoregulation by pregnant women and may increase
the amount of blood shifted from vital organs of the
mother and fetus [62]. High temperatures may also in-
crease blood viscosity and cholesterol levels which may
impact labor induction [63]. Findings from our study are
consistent with the mechanisms outlined above regarding
the immediate effects of heat exposure on PTD.
Limitations
We note a few limitations of the study. Ecological level
data was used to assess temperature as individual heat
monitoring data was not available. However, we mini-
mized the potential for misclassification by limiting the
study to pregnant women residing in residential zip
codes within 20 kilometers of a meteorological monitor.
This criteria also addresses potential exposure misclassi-
fication due to residential mobility as a majority of
women who move during pregnancy tend to stay within
the same exposure region [64]. Additionally, we lacked in-
formation on residential or occupational air conditioning
status. However, a majority of homes in the coastal region
in Northern California do not have air conditioning [49].
Since most homes on the coast are more expensive, the
lack of residential air conditioning is not a marker of so-
cioeconomic status or bias.
Spanning 16 years, this study contributes one of the
longest periods of time used to assess the relationship
between apparent temperature and PTD and confirms
previous research suggesting an increase in the odds of
spontaneous PTD associated with increases in apparent
temperatures, especially during the warm season. The
use of electronic health records provide a more accurate
method to differentiate spontaneous versus induced pre-
term deliveries and decrease misclassification of spon-
taneous PTD. The findings from the inclusion of both
the warm and cold season in this study provide some
indication that there may be a threshold at which appar-
ent temperature triggers a labor response resulting in
spontaneous PTD. Given that heat waves are likely to
increase in severity and duration in the future1, the find-
ings from this study have significant public health impli-
cations for pregnant women.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest an increase in the odds of PTD
associated with increases in ambient temperatures, espe-
cially during the warm season. Given that heat waves are
likely to increase in severity and duration in the future1,
the findings from this study have significant public
health implications for pregnant women.
