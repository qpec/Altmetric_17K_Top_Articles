IMPORTANCE Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD)
and cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, prognostic data on CAC are limited in younger
adults.
OBJECTIVE To determine if CAC in adults aged 32 to 46 years is associated with incident
clinical CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality during 12.5 years of follow-up.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
(CARDIA) Study is a prospective community-based study that recruited 5115 black and white
participants aged 18 to 30 years from March 25, 1985, to June 7, 1986. The cohort has been
under surveillance for 30 years, with CAC measured 15 (n = 3043), 20 (n = 3141), and 25
(n = 3189) years after recruitment. The mean follow-up period for incident events was 12.5
years, from the year 15 computed tomographic scan through August 31, 2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident CHD included fatal or nonfatal myocardial
infarction, acute coronary syndrome without myocardial infarction, coronary
revascularization, or CHD death. Incident CVD included CHD, stroke, heart failure, and
peripheral arterial disease. Death included all causes. The probability of developing CAC by
age 32 to 56 years was estimated using clinical risk factors measured 7 years apart between
ages 18 and 38 years.
RESULTS At year 15 of the study among 3043 participants (mean [SD] age, 40.3 [3.6] years;
1383 men and 1660 women), 309 individuals (10.2%) had CAC, with a geometric mean
Agatston score of 21.6 (interquartile range, 17.3-26.8). Participants were followed up for 12.5
years, with 57 incident CHD events and 108 incident CVD events observed. After adjusting for
demographics, risk factors, and treatments, those with any CAC experienced a 5-fold increase
in CHD events (hazard ratio [HR], 5.0; 95% CI, 2.8-8.7) and 3-fold increase in CVD events
(HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.9-4.7). Within CAC score strata of 1-19, 20-99, and 100 or more, the HRs
for CHD were 2.6 (95% CI, 1.0-5.7), 5.8 (95% CI, 2.6-12.1), and 9.8 (95% CI, 4.5-20.5),
respectively. A CAC score of 100 or more had an incidence of 22.4 deaths per 100 participants
(HR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.5-10.0); of the 13 deaths in participants with a CAC score of 100 or more,
10 were adjudicated as CHD events. Risk factors for CVD in early adult life identified those
above the median risk for developing CAC and, if applied, in a selective CAC screening
strategy could reduce the number of people screened for CAC by 50% and the number
imaged needed to find 1 person with CAC from 3.5 to 2.2.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The presence of CAC among individuals aged between 32 and
46 years was associated with increased risk of fatal and nonfatal CHD during 12.5 years of
follow-up. A CAC score of 100 or more was associated with early death. Adults younger than
50 years with any CAC, even with very low scores, identified on a computed tomographic
scan are at elevated risk of clinical CHD, CVD, and death. Selective use of screening for CAC
might be considered in individuals with risk factors in early adulthood to inform discussions
about primary prevention.

C
oronary artery calcium (CAC) measured by noncon-
trast cardiac computed tomographic (CT) scan is a non-
invasive measure of coronary artery disease that is as-
sociated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular
disease (CVD) in middle and older age.1-4 The Coronary Ar-
tery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study pre-
viously reported that nonoptimal levels of modifiable cardio-
vascular risk factors at a mean age of 25 years were associated
with prevalent CAC measured 15 years later at a mean age of
40 years.5 It is unknown if the presence of CAC by midlife in-
creases the risk of CHD clinical events during the next decade
in this younger population.
We hypothesized that the presence of CAC among indi-
viduals aged 32 to 46 years would be associated with clinical
CHD and CVD occurring by the age of 58 years. Furthermore,
we explored whether early clinical risk factors were associ-
ated with the development of CAC and whether such early risk
factors support a strategy of selective screening for CAC to in-
form discussions about primary prevention.
Methods
Study Sample
The CARDIA Study enrolled 5115 black and white men and
womenaged18to30yearsfromMarch25,1985,toJune7,1986
(year 0), from Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Min-
neapolis, Minnesota; and Oakland, California. Sampling was
populationbasedandapproximatelybalancedwithinfieldcen-
ter by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and educational level.6,7 Exami-
nations during 2000-2001 (year 15; 3672 of 4989 survivors
[73.6%]attending),2005-2006(year20;3549of4936[71.9%]),
and 2010-2011 (year 25; 3499 of 4853 [72.1%]) included CT
imaging for CAC. The protocols were approved by institu-
tional review boards of the University of Alabama at Birming-
ham, Kaiser Permanente of Oakland California, University of
Minnesota,andNorthwesternUniversity.Signedinformedcon-
sent was obtained from all participants at every examination.
Measurement of Demographics
and Cardiovascular Risk Factors
Standardized assessment and quality control protocols were
used at all examinations. Participants were asked to fast for 12
hours and to avoid smoking and strenuous physical activity
for 2 hours before examination. Age, race/ethnicity, sex, years
of education attained, and smoking habits (never, former, or
current) were self-reported. Three blood pressure (BP) mea-
surements were obtained while the participant was seated at
each examination. Hypertension was defined as a BP of 140/90
mm Hg or more or use of antihypertensive medication. Plasma
from venipuncture was stored at –70°C. Total and high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were as-
sayed enzymatically. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was
computed. Body mass index was calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared. Diabetes was di-
agnosed as the first fasting plasma glucose level of 126 mg/dL
or more (to convert glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0555) (measured at years 0, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25), a 2-hour
glucose level of 200 mg/dL or more (measured at years 10, 20,
and 25), hemoglobin A1c of 6.5% or more (measured at years
20 and 25), or use of medication for diabetes (assessed at all
examinations).Missingvaluesattheyear15examination(base-
line for this analysis) for smoking (n = 6), body mass index
(n = 11), BP (n = 9), and serum lipids (n = 40) were interpo-
lated from results of adjacent examinations. Clinical results,
including lipids and CAC score, were reported to participants
after each examination.
Measurement of CAC by CT Scan
A standard protocol for noncontrast CT scan was used to mea-
sure CAC (eTable 1 in the Supplement).8 Two sequential scans
were performed at years 15 and 20 and then averaged. Given
observed reproducibility, a single CT scan was performed at
year 25. The Agatston score was calculated corrected for slice
thickness, with a minimum calcification area of 1.87 mm2 and
attenuation threshold of 130 or more Hounsfield units on a
dedicated computer workstation (TeraRecon).9 The previ-
ously reported year 15 CAC scores were adjudicated for dis-
cordant CAC presence within paired scans (years 15 and 20),
score change of more than 200, regression to a score of 0, or
identification of potential surgical intervention (pacemaker,
valve replacement, intracoronary stent, or coronary bypass).
Robustness of the CAC score has been published.10-12
Ascertainment of Clinical Events
The mean follow-up period for incident events was 12.5 years,
from the year 15 CT scan through August 31, 2014. Hospital-
izations and relevant outpatient procedures were queried an-
nually. Two physician members of the CARDIA Endpoints

Key Points
Question Is the presence of coronary artery disease, as indicated
by coronary artery calcium (CAC), associated with the
development of clinical coronary heart disease before age 60
years?
Finding In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
Study, black and white Americans of both sexes aged 32 to 46
years who had any CAC (Agatston score >0) as seen on computed
tomographic scan had an elevated risk of clinical coronary heart
disease during 12.5 years of follow-up. Individuals with a CAC score
of 100 or more had an incidence density of 22.4 deaths per 100
people observed for 12.5 years.
Meaning Any CAC in early adult life, even in those with very low
scores, indicates significant risk of having and possibly dying of a
myocardial infarction during the next decade beyond standard risk
factors and identifies an individual at particularly elevated risk for
coronary heart disease for whom aggressive prevention is likely
warranted.

with increasing symptoms consistent with ischemia but with-
out infarction, or CHD death (including fatal myocardial in-
farction) (n = 46) or coronary revascularization (n = 11). Car-
diovascular disease events included CHD, heart failure, stroke,
transient ischemic attack, or peripheral artery disease.
Exclusions
We excluded 125 participants who died before their 15th re-
cruitment anniversary and 52 who were unable to be con-
tactedafterthatanniversary.Amongtheremainingeligiblepar-
ticipants, 958 never underwent a CT scan. Participants were
ineligible for CT scanning if they were pregnant (or poten-
tially pregnant) or if their weight was above the limit for the
CT scan table. One or more CT scans was performed on 3980
of 4938 living and contactable CARDIA participants (80.6%).
Participants whose CHD or CVD event occurred before the year
15 examination were removed from specific analyses.
Predicting CAC From Clinical Risk Factors
A CAC prediction score was created based on participant age,
race/ethnicity, sex, educational level, field center, smoking
status, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass
index, systolic BP, presence of diabetes, and use of medica-
tion(s) for BP and lipid control; these factors were measured
at 2 time points 7 years apart when the participants were
between the ages of 18 and 38 years (eAppendix in the
Supplement). The predicted probability of developing CAC
before age 56 years was grouped into deciles and compared
with the observed CAC status across the set of 3 CT scans
offered to CARDIA participants and with the occurrence of
CHD before age 58 years.
Statistical Analysis
We compared participant characteristics at enrollment (year
0) and subsequent follow-ups according to participation in
CT scans. We described CAC score increments in people who
underwent CT scans at year 15, 20, and 25. Cox proportional
hazards regression assessed the association of year 15 CAC
score with incident CHD and CVD events. Coronary heart
disease incidence density (ID) was estimated by year 15 cat-
egories of Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and CAC using Pois-
son regression with person-time offset. Linear regression
predicted any CAC by year 25. P < .05 (2-sided) was consid-
ered significant. All analyses used SAS, version 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc).
Results
Of 3980 participants who underwent any CT scan, 745 (18.7%),
1077 (27.1%), and 2158 (54.2%) had CAC measured 1, 2, or 3
times, respectively. The 1135 baseline participants who never
underwent a CT scan were slightly younger (mean [SD] age,
24.2 [3.7] vs 25.0 [3.6] years) and more likely to be male (565
[49.8%] vs 1763 [44.3%]), black (717 [63.2%] vs 1920 [48.2%]),
and current smokers (453 of 1122 [40.4%] vs 1093 of 3957
[27.6%])thanthosewhounderwentanyCTscan(Table1).Coro-
nary artery calcium scores were measured in 3043, 3141, and
3189 participants 15, 20, and 25 years, respectively, after study
enrollment. The FRS, medication use, prevalence of diabe-
tes,bodymassindex,systolicBP,high-densitylipoproteincho-
lesterol, and triglycerides increased and current smoking de-
creased with age. At 15, 20, and 25 years after enrollment, the
FRS 10-year risk of CHD was nonoptimal (greater than 4%) in
606 of 3043 (19.9%), 858 of 3076 (27.9%), and 1395 of 3118
(44.7%) of participants, respectively; 80 of 3043 (2.6%), 331 of
3076 (10.8%), and 560 of 3118 (18.0%), respectively, used lipid-
loweringtherapies;and230of3043(7.6%),546of3076(17.8%),
and 877 of 3118 (28.1%), respectively, used antihypertensive
therapies (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
CAC in Adults Aged 32 to 56 Years
Cohort mean (SD) ages at years 15, 20, and 25 were 40.3 (3.6),
45.3 (3.6), and 50.1 (3.6) years, respectively, with a preva-
lence of CAC of 10.2% (309 of 3043), 20.1% (631 of 3141), and
28.4% (907 of 3189), respectively (Table 1). The 5-year inci-
dence of CAC, among those without CAC 5 years earlier, was
11.9% (266 of 2238 participants) between year 15 and year 20
(participants aged 40.3-45.3 years) and 14.4% (301 of 2097 par-
ticipants) between years 20 and 25 (participants aged 45.3-
50.1years).Overall,the10-yearincidenceofCACbetweenyears
15 and 25 was 22.1% (488 of 2209 participants). Among those
withnonzeroCACscores,theoverallgeometricmeanscorewas
21.6 (interquartile range [IQR], 17.3-26.8) at year 15, increas-
ing to 59.1 (IQR, 47.7-73.2) at year 20 and 144.4 (IQR, 116.9-
178.3) at year 25 and increasing exponentially after adjusting
for age, race/ethnicity, and sex (Figure 1).
CAC and Incident CHD, CVD, and Death
We observed 57 incident CHD events after the baseline CT
scan (number at risk, 3036, excluding 7 with CHD before
year 15). Events increased monotonically across clinical CAC
ranges (eFigure in the Supplement). The unadjusted inci-
dence density in those with any CAC was 8.9 events per 100
individuals followed up for 12½ years. Compared with no
CAC, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for CHD among those
with any CAC was 5.0 (95% CI, 2.8-8.7; P < .001) (Table 2).
The incidence density of any CHD increased from 4.8 events
per 100 persons (HR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.0-5.7; P = .03) at a CAC
score of 1 to 19, to 10.6 events per 100 persons (HR, 5.8; 95%
CI, 2.6-12.1; P < .001) at a CAC score of 20 to 99, to 26.1
events per 100 persons (HR, 9.8; 95% CI, 4.5-20.5; P < .001)
at a CAC score of 100 or more (Table 2). This association was
similar when we excluded coronary revascularization with-
out acute symptomatic presentation from CHD events.
Although CAC was associated with the 108 fatal or nonfatal
CVD events (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.9-4.7), it was not associated
with the CVD events that did not involve CHD (eTable 3 in
the Supplement). The presence of any CAC had an incidence
density of 8.1 all-cause deaths per 100 people followed up
for 12.5 years (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.6; P = .05) (Table 2) in
the fully adjusted model. The incidence density increased to
22.4 deaths per 100 people in those with a CAC score of 100
or more (HR, 3.7; 95% CI 1.5-10.0; P < .001) in the fully
adjusted model. Of the observed 13 deaths in participants
with a CAC score of 100 or more, 10 were adjudicated as CHD

events. The risk of CHD event across year 15 CAC categories
increased within each year 15 FRS category (Figure 2).
Prediction of CAC at Age 32 to 56 Years
Risk factors for CVD during early adulthood were associated
with the development of CAC before age 56 years (eTable 4 in
the Supplement). A CAC prediction score using clinical risk fac-
tors measured 7 years apart between ages 18 and 38 years was
associated with the presence or absence of CAC in the cohort,
with a model R2 = 0.18 (eAppendix in the Supplement). The
CAC prediction score discriminated between those with a low
and high probability of developing CAC before age 56 years.
ParticipantsinthelowestCACriskdecilehadanobservedpres-
ence of CAC of 4.2% (14 of 333) compared with 67.8% (217 of
320) in the highest CAC risk decile (eTable 5 in the Supple-
ment). A strategy of restricting CAC screening to persons with
a risk score above the median value captured 77.3% of all par-
ticipants with any CAC (745 of 964) and 95.5% of participants
with CHD events (64 of 67) while reducing the number of in-
dividualsrecommendedtobescreenedby50.0%(1665of3330)
(Table 3).
Discussion
We evaluated the association of CAC at ages 32 to 46 years
with incident CHD, CVD, and total death during the next 12.5
years in a biracial US sample. We found that any measure-
able CAC was associated with a 5-fold increase in fatal and
nonfatal CHD events, with a 3-fold increase in any CVD
events. Even CAC scores between 1 and 19 increased the risk
of CHD events by 2.6-fold compared with participants with-
out CAC. A higher burden of atherosclerotic coronary artery
disease, as measured by higher CAC scores, demonstrated
increasing strength of association with incident CHD. Con-
sistent with the CHD association was the 3.7-fold increase in

all-cause death in those with a CAC score of 100 or more. In
individuals aged 32 to 46 years, CAC appears to be specific
for CHD during middle age. The exponential increase in CAC
scores across 10 years is consistent with active coronary ath-
erogenesis and is a plausible explanation for the association
between even low CAC scores in early adult life and the
observed CHD events and mortality during middle age in our
cohort. The 28.4% prevalence of CAC at a mean cohort age of
50.1 years indicates a substantial burden of coronary artery
disease and future risk of CHD events.
Coronary atherosclerosis is known to be present in early
adult life (age, 18-34 years).13,14 Previous reports on CAC and
CHD events in younger adults are limited and have been per-
formed in individuals clinically referred for CAC screening or
in members of the military.4,15,16 Our study addresses limita-
tions associated with generalizability, self-referral bias, self-
reported risk factors, lack of adjudicated CHD and CVD out-
comes, and use of contemporary CT scan technology.
Calcification, Atherosclerosis, and Clinical Disease
Presence of CAC as confirmed by results of CT scan indicates
that an individual has progressed beyond the early nonraised
lesions to advanced coronary atheroma.17-20 We found expo-
nential increases in CAC burden among adults aged 32 to 56
years. Previously, higher CAC scores (≥100) were associated
with incidence of clinical CHD and CVD after adjustment for
known covariates.1,21 The finding that even low CAC scores are
associated with CHD and CVD events by middle age after full
adjustment is new information. Studies using cardiac CT
angiography and intravascular ultrasound have found that
patterns of “spotty calcifications” in coronary arteries are
associated with high-risk plaques and acute coronary
syndrome.22,23 Considering this phenomenon and noting the
exponential increase in CAC during the 5 and 10 years after it
is first observed, it is unsurprising that CAC scores less than
100 and even less than 20 detected at ages 32 to 46 years have
negative health consequences that manifest during the next
10 to 15 years.
Clinical Implications of CAC for Preventing CHD
in Early- and Middle-Aged Adults
The finding that low CAC scores are associated with clinical
events in young adults independent of the FRS and tradi-
tional risk factors for CVD has potential clinical implications.
Any CAC present between ages 32 to 46 years in our study in-
creased the risk of clinical CHD events by 5-fold after adjust-
ment. Our findings in younger adults augment existing evi-
dence that CAC adds information to risk factors and other
biomarkers improving the classification of risk for CHD
(Figure 2).1-3,24-26 The 2013 American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association guidelines27 include screening for
CAC as an option for assessment of risk of CVD in individuals
forwhomuncertaintyexists;recentreportsfurthersupportthis
application.28,29 Coronary artery calcium score thresholds of
100, 300, and 400 or age-based percentiles have commonly
guided recommendations; however, in light of our findings,
theserecommendationsmightbereconsideredinfavoroflower
thresholds in middle-aged and younger adults.21
Standardized reporting of CAC on conventional chest CT
scansperformedforanotherindicationcoupledwithevidence-
based interventions to reduce the risk of CVD have the poten-
tial to enhance prevention.30,31 Coronary artery calcium seen
on screening chest CT scans for lung cancer has been found
to be independently associated with CVD and all-cause mor-
talityanddemonstratestheviabilityofidentifyingCAConsuch
scans.32,33
The significantly elevated 10-year risk of CVD in CARDIA
participants with CAC in middle age is consistent with an even
more substantial lifetime risk of CVD.34,35 Previous models of
the comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of CT scans for
CAC were based largely on outcomes data in older adults.36,37
With regard to consideration of statin therapy, in the Multi-
Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, participants with low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 130 mg/dL (to con-
vertcholesteroltomillimolesperliter,multiplyby0.0259)who
were stratified by CAC score resulted in predicted numbers
needed to treat of 24 for those with a CAC score more than 100
compared with 549 for those with a CAC score of zero.38 Our
data provide robust estimates of the development of CAC and
associated risk of CHD and CVD events occurring before age
58 years. This finding might allow more accurate estimates of
attributable risk and number needed to screen and treat to
avoid or delay a clinical event. Computed tomographic scans
for CAC are quick (<10 minutes), can be performed with widely

The geometric means and 95% CIs by CAC score category at the year 15
examination (2000-2001), estimated in repeated measures regression with
banded covariance structure, are presented. The geometric mean was used to
address the skewness of the distribution and can be interpreted as comparable
to the median of the distribution. Although CAC was initially minimal in the
group with the lowest score (1-19), during the following 10 years the geometric
mean CAC score increased from 5.7 at year 15 to 27.4 at year 20 to 89.8 at year
25. In the group with a score of 20-99, the geometric mean CAC score increased
from 43.6 at year 15 to 117.8 at year 20 to 255.7 at year 25. In the group with a
score of �100, the geometric mean CAC score increased from 217.2 at year 15
to 440.4 at year 20 to 680.0 at year 25. The linear increase observed, when
plotted on the log scale y-axis, indicates exponential increase over time in the
amount of CAC.

available CT scanners, require very low radiation exposure (≤1
mSv effective dose), and are well tolerated by healthy
volunteers.8,39
Could the knowledge of an association of the presence of
CAC in early adult life with CHD and premature death be used
to improve prevention of CHD? Screening all individuals aged
32 to 46 years for CAC is not desirable since CAC is relatively
rare by that age range (10.2% prevalence) and even by ages 42
to 56 (28.4% prevalence). In a strategy in which all individu-
alsaged32to46yearsarescreened,most(approximately70%-
90%) would be negative for CAC and thus experience the nega-
tiveconsequencesofscreening(incidentalfindings,associated
cost and time, and low level exposure to radiation) with lim-
ited benefit. Depending on age at first measurement of CAC,
many people would develop incident CAC during the next 10
to 15 years as its prevalence increases with age. A tiered screen-
ingstrategycouldcombinemeasurementofriskfactorsforCVD
and targeted CT scans for CAC to refine assessment of the risk
forCHD.Toillustrate,weextendedapriorCARDIApublication5
and created a predicted CAC risk score using demographic and
risk factors measured at mean ages of 25 and 32 years. Using
the participant’
s CAC risk score, we then divided the cohort
into predicted low and high risk for developing CAC to evalu-
ate how a screening strategy parallel to the CARDIA protocol
in which a series of 3 examinations was offered across 10 years
might perform in practice (Table 3). Compared with a strat-
egy in which all individuals aged 32 to 46 years are screened,
we found that an approach that uses ascertainment of risk fac-
tors in early adulthood as a gatekeeper to measurement of CAC
has the potential to reduce the number of people targeted for
CAC screening by 50% and reduce the number of people
screened to find 1 individual with CAC from 3.5 to 2.2. Nota-
bly, 95.5% of the individuals observed in CARDIA with clini-
cal CHD events would be targeted for CAC screening using this
strategy. A more comprehensive evaluation of predictive
models, positive and negative consequences, and a cost-
effectiveness analysis of potential CHD screening strategies in
early adult life is warranted.28,36,40,41 Individuals younger than
than 59 years with CAC confirmed on results of CT scans per-
formed for another indication are at significant risk of fatal and
nonfatal CHD. In our opinion, these individuals do not need
an additional CT scan to measure a CAC score; rather, they
should be evaluated for modifiable risk factors for CVD by their
health care professional with determination of appropriate
strategies to reduce their risk of CVD.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of our study include the prospective longitudinal de-
sign across 30 years, community-based biracial population,
widely available CT scanning systems, US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration–approved software for measuring CAC, and es-
tablished clinical measures of outcomes and covariates. Fur-
thermore, results remained consistent after excluding events
in which asymptomatic coronary revascularization was the
only indication of CHD. A limitation of this study is the rela-
tively small number of CHD events; however, additional fol-
low-up is planned. The inclusion of more than 80% of the re-
cruited and eligible cohort minimized potential nonresponse
bias. Changes in CT scanning technology were actively man-
aged through site selection, protocol, and quality control pro-
cedures to minimize the effect of equipment changes on the
CAC measures.8 Our rigorous quality control and adjudica-

twice: when the cohort had a mean age of 25 years (range at year 0
examination, 18-30 years) and 32 years (range at year 7 examination, 25-38
years), using linear regression to predict the development of any CAC at any of
the year 15, 20, or 25 examinations (during ages 32-56 years). Risk factors
were measured during the year 0 and 7 examinations and included the
following: age, race/ethnicity, sex, field center, educational level and both year
0 and 7 smoking status, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index,
systolic blood pressure, use of antihypertensive medication, use of
lipid-lowering medication (both medication categories were rare by year 7:
n = 50 antihypertensive medication users, n = 8 lipid-lowering medication
users), and type 1 or 2 diabetes (also rare by year 7: n = 37). The prediction

tion of results increases the precision and validity of our find-
ings but may be less generalizable to current clinical practice
without comparable standards. The findings of the CARDIA
Study may not apply to individuals of a race/ethnicity other
than white or black who are living in the United States. The use
of CVD risk factors measured at multiple time points in early
adult life to predict the development of CAC requires further
refinement but may help guide future research efforts and de-
bate. Finally, as noted in the 2013 American College of Cardi-
ology/American Heart Association cardiovascular risk assess-
ment guidelines, none of the risk assessment tools, including
the FRS or novel risk markers, have been formally evaluated
in a randomized clinical trial of the efficacy of screening for
clinical events.27 This gap in knowledge, although regret-
table, should not prevent progress in reducing the negative
health consequences of CHD. Randomized trials for breast and
lung cancer screening have been completed, yet significant
concerns remain regarding implementation in clinical
practice.42
Conclusions
The presence of any CAC by ages 32 to 46 years, including CAC
scores less than 20, were associated with incident CHD dur-
ing middle age in black and white men and women. Coronary
artery calcium present by ages 32 to 46 years increased expo-
nentially during the next decade of life. The 22.1% 10-year in-
cidence of CAC observed in the cohort between mean ages of
40.3 years and 50.1 years indicates the development and pro-
gressionofsubstantialcoronaryatherosclerosisinmiddleadult
life..43 Coronary artery calcium was associated with all-cause
mortality in those with CAC scores of 100 or more, who gen-
erally died of CHD. The association of CAC with CHD strength-
ened as the burden of calcified plaque increased. These find-
ings support the potential use of CAC as a biomarker of risk of
CHDandprematuredeathinyoungadults.Thepresenceofany
CAC on conventional chest CT examinations in individuals 56
years of age or younger should be recognized as a biomarker
of elevated CHD risk and trigger a review of the individual’
s
cardiovascular health status and intensified prevention ef-
forts personalized to the patient. Whether any kind of gen-
eral screening for CAC is warranted needs further study, al-
though we suggest that a strategy in which all individuals aged
32 to 46 years are screened is not indicated. Rather, a more tar-
geted approach based on measuring risk factors in early adult
life to predict individuals at high risk for developing CAC in
whom the CT scan would have the greatest value can be con-
sidered. The finding that CAC present by ages 32 to 46 years is
associatedwithincreasedriskofprematureCHDanddeathem-
phasizes the need for reduction of risk factors and primordial
prevention beginning in early life.
