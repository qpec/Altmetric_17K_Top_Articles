Objective To study prepregnancy serum lipid levels and 
the association with the number of children.
Design Prospective, population-based cohort.
setting Linked data from the Cohort of Norway and the 
Medical Birth Registry of Norway.
Participants 2645 women giving birth to their first child 
during 1994–2003 (488 one-child mothers and 2157 
women with ≥2 births) and 1677 nulliparous women.
Main outcome measures ORs for no and one lifetime 
pregnancy (relative to ≥2 pregnancies) obtained by 
multinomial logistic regression, adjusted for age at 
examination, education, body mass index (BMI), smoking, 
time since last meal and oral contraceptive use.
results Assessed in quintiles, higher prepregnant 
triglyceride (TG) and TG to high-density lipoprotein 
(TG:HDL-c) ratio levels were associated with increased 
risk of one lifetime pregnancy compared with having ≥2 
children. Compared with the highest quintile, women in the 
lowest quintile of HDL cholesterol levels had an increased 
risk of one lifetime pregnancy (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.4), 
as were women with the highest low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol, TG and TG:HDL-c ratio quintiles 
(compared with the lowest) (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.7; 
OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.2; and OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.2, 
respectively). Similar effects were found in women with 
BMI≥25 and the highest LDL and total cholesterol levels in 
risk of lifetime nulliparity.
Conclusion Women with unfavourable prepregnant lipid 
profile had higher risk of having no or only one child. These 
findings substantiate an association between prepregnant 
serum lipid levels and number of children. Previously 
observed associations between low parity and increased 
cardiovascular mortality may in part be due to pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease lipid risk factors.
IntrODuCtIOn 
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an important 
public health problem and remains the 
number one cause of death in women.1 
Reproductive history is important in eval-
uating health risks in women, as pregnancy 
may unmask a woman’s predisposition for 
CVD.1 Several studies have reported increased 
CVD mortality among women with no or only 
one lifetime pregnancy.2–4 Efforts to eluci-
date the association between the number of 
children and the risk of female CVD have 
been inconclusive.1 3 Proposed explanations 
are lifestyle risk factors associated with chil-
drearing,5 sex hormone fluctuations, protec-
tive effect of future pregnancies,3 lifestyle 
factors prior to conception such as elevated 
blood pressure and obesity,6 as well as meta-
bolic irregularities triggered by gestation.1 
Detection of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in 
follicular fluid from oocytes7 8 suggests a rela-
tion between lipids and female reproductive 
function. More recent studies have reported 
associations between lipids and fertility in 
both sexes.9 Low parity (as a feature of subfe-
cundity) and cardiovascular events may share 
common pathophysiological mechanisms.10 
While the role of serum lipids in cardiomet-
abolic health is well established, showing 
low HDL and high triglycerides (TGs) to 
be strong predictors of CVD,11 their role in 
reproduction is uncertain. It is also uncertain 
whether women with no or one lifetime preg-
nancy have a higher CVD risk to begin with, 
or whether future pregnancies may reduce 
the CVD risk.
strengths and limitations of this study
 
► This is a large population-based study with data col-
lected before pregnancy.
 
► Linkage with the Medical Birth Registry of Norway 
provided complete registration of total reproduction.
 
► Limitations include lack of data on family planning, 
dietary intake, duration of oral contraceptive use, 
APOE genotype, low-grade inflammation and thyroid 
status.
 
► Non-fasting lipid measurements were used; howev-
er, adjustments in our analyses for time since last 
meal did not change the results.

We pursued this question by exploring the extent to 
which prepregnant serum lipid levels of total, HDL and 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, TG and TG:H-
DL-c ratio are associated with having no and one lifetime 
pregnancy.

study design and population
We used linked data from the Cohort of Norway (CONOR) 
and the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN). 
CONOR is a population-based collection of health data 
and blood samples provided by participants older than 
20 years of age residing in several different regions in 
Norway during 1994–2003.12 Our subset included women 
with no children at the time of examination with stan-
dardised measurements of height, weight and non-fasting 
lipids levels. Lifestyle factors were obtained through 
an extensive questionnaire that collected self-reported 
information on smoking, oral contraceptive (OC) use, 
self-reported status on receipt of social security benefits, 
attained level of education and various lifestyle factors.12 
Education in Norway consists of primary school (7 years), 
lower secondary school (3 years), upper secondary school 
(3 years) and higher education. The first 10 years are 
obligatory.
The MBRN has since 1967 recorded data on all deliv-
eries in the country after 16th week of gestation.13 Based 
on mandatory notification, midwives and doctors report 
information using standard forms throughout preg-
nancy and at the time of delivery. The registry includes 
demographic information, mother’s health prior and 
during pregnancy, complications in pregnancy and 
perinatal outcome. Using the unique national identi-
fication number given to all Norwegian citizens, each 
woman was linked to all her subsequent births (if any) 
after participating in CONOR. Women reporting no chil-
dren in CONOR at the time of examination and with no 
valid records in the MBRN were considered having no 
pregnancies.
Women with baseline assessment of lifestyle factors in 
CONOR were linked to the MBRN. We defined one-child 
mothers as women being 6 years out from their first preg-
nancy and with no additional births registered in the 
MBRN.
Preconception measurements
Non-fasting blood samples were analysed on a Hitachi 
911 Auto Analyzer (Hitachi, Mito, Japan).12 Applied 
reagents were from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, 
Germany). Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, 
HDL cholesterol and TG were analysed subsequent to 
sampling. The total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol levels 
and TGs were measured by an enzymatic method. The 
day-to-day coefficients of variation were 2.4% and 0.7%–
1.3% for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and TG, 
respectively. To calculate LDL, we used the Friedewald 
formula14: total serum cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol 
minus one-fifth of the TG concentration. LDL choles-
terol levels were calculated only for participants with 
TG concentrations below 4.5 mmol/L.6 14 Accordingly, 
the TG:HDL-c ratio was expressed as mmol/L.
Trained personnel measured the height and weight, 
with the participants wearing light clothes and no shoes; 
measurements were taken as follows: height to the nearest 
1.0 cm and weight to the nearest 0.5 kg. Body mass index 
(BMI) was calculated as weight in kilogram/(height in 
metres)2.
Patients and public involvement
Patients or the public were not directly involved in this 
study. The detailed explanation of the recruitment 
process and the obtainment of written informed consent 
for CONOR were provided elsewhere.12
statistical analyses
The characteristics of the analysed women were presented 
as means with SD for continuous data and as number with 
percentages for categorical data. Differences between 
nulliparous women, one-child mothers and mothers 
with two or more children, as well as prepregnant health 
status, were analysed by χ2 tests and t-tests where appro-
priate. Linear associations across prepregnant lipid levels 
(in quintiles) for no and one lifetime pregnancy were 
assessed by p values for trend. ORs of no and one life-
time pregnancy by lipid levels and TG:HDL-c ratio, when 
compared with women with two or more pregnancies, 
were calculated using multinomial logistic regression and 
adjusted for mother’s age at examination, level of educa-
tion (categorised in <11 years and >11 years of educa-
tion), smoking (current smoker: yes, no), time since last 
meal, OC use (now, previously, never) and BMI (linear 
term). To extend each woman’s likelihood of completing 
her birth record, we separately examined women who 
were 7 years out from their first pregnancy. About 95% of 
Norwegian women will complete their second pregnancy 
within 7 years.4 To test the effect of (prepregnant) BMI, 
we stratified the main analyses by BMI (<25 and ≥25). To 
avoid influence from age at first delivery on the number 
of children, we excluded women older than 34 years at 
the time of first delivery in a subanalysis. Additionally, 
we performed sensitivity analyses including only mothers 
who were 22–30 years old at the time of first delivery. 
Using presence of a partner (ever) as a proxy for exposure 
to pregnancy among nulliparous women, we performed 
logistic regression in a subanalysis (nulliparous vs women 
with ≥2 births) including only women with a reported 
partner (ever). All analyses were performed using the 
Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS V.22.0 and 
V.23.0).
results
There were 4743 women with baseline assessment of life-
style factors in CONOR (1994–2003) that were linked 
to the MBRN. We excluded 421 women with pregnancy

at the time of examination (n=139), unsure pregnancy 
status (n=157) and missing lipid assessments (n=125). 
Thus, 4322 women were included in the analyses (1677 
nulliparous, 488 one-child mothers and 2157 women 
with ≥2 births; see figure 1). Subanalyses included only 
women with reported partners (228 nulliparous and 216 
mothers with ≥2 births).
The characteristics of the included women are given 
in table 1. Nulliparous women were older at the time of 
examination, had higher BMI and were more frequent 
smokers compared with women with two or more births. 
A higher proportion of nulliparous women had >11 years 
of education. One-child mothers had higher mean age 
both at examination and at delivery (29.5 vs 26.7 and 32.3 
vs 29.9, respectively), were more often smokers and had 
lower education than mothers with ≥2 births. The mean 
BMI prior to pregnancy was higher in one-child mothers 
(24.2 vs 23.5), whereas the mean years from examination 
to first delivery were similar for the two groups. Women 
with no and one child were less frequent users of OCs at 
the time of examination compared with mothers with ≥2 
births (27.4%, 34.6% and 48.9%, respectively).
The proportion of diabetes at first delivery in one-child 
mothers was higher than in women with two or more

births (1.4% vs 0.9%, p=0.30). Polycystic ovary syndrome 
(PCOS) was rare and we only had three cases in our mate-
rial. A significantly higher number of one-child mothers 
had in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in their first pregnancy 
(7.2% vs 2.6% in women with ≥2 births; p<0.001) (data 
not shown). This latter finding remained after excluding 
mothers older than 34 years at first delivery.
ORs with 95% CIs for no and one lifetime pregnancy 
(vs ≥2 lifetime pregnancies) by lipid levels (in quin-
tiles) are presented in table 2 and figure 2. Significant 
trends in ORs for one lifetime pregnancy across TG and 
TG:HDL-c ratio quintiles were observed (p trend=0.01). 
The OR for having one lifetime pregnancy for women 
with the highest TG quintile compared with the lowest 
quintile was 2.2 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.2). The ORs for having 
one lifetime pregnancy for women with TG:HDL-c ratio 
levels in the two highest quintiles were 1.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 
2.5) and 2.2 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.2), respectively, compared 
with the lowest quintile. There were no significant trends 
for LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol or HDL choles-
terol, although the ORs of one lifetime pregnancy for 
the lowest HDL quintile were 1.7 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.4) 
and for the highest LDL quintile 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 
1.7). We found no increased risk of being nulliparous by 
serum lipid levels except for the highest LDL and total 
cholesterol levels, and these estimates were not persua-
sive (OR 1.2 (95% CI 0.9 to 1.6) and 1.2 (95% CI 0.9

exclusion of women older than 34 years at the time of first 
delivery nor the additional restriction of our analyses to 
mothers aged 22–30 years at first pregnancy. The similar 
effects of prepregnant lipids as in one-child mothers were 
observed when subanalyses (nulliparous vs ≥2 births) 
were performed on women who had a partner (as a proxy 
for ever being exposed to pregnancy). For women with 
partner, the risk of having no children was increased 
among the women in the highest quintiles of TG and 
TG:HDL-c ratio (compared with the lowest quintiles) and 
also for those in the lowest HDL quintile (compared with 
the highest) (OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.9 to 4.2; OR 2.0, 95% CI 
1.0 to 4.1; and OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.7 to 3.6, respectively).
Stratified analyses by BMI are presented in table 3. In 
women with BMI≥25 there were significant trends in ORs 
of having no children or one child across increasing levels 
of prepregnant total cholesterol, TG and TG:HDL-c ratio 
quintiles (p trend=0.04 and <0.001, respectively). The 
adjusted ORs of one lifetime pregnancy for women with 
BMI≥25 and TG levels in the two highest quintiles were 
2.1 (95% CI 0.9 to 4.8) and 3.5 (95% CI 1.6 to 7.4), and 
for the two highest TG:HDL-c ratio quintiles 3.1 (95% 
CI 1.3 to 7.4) and 4.3 (95% CI 1.9 to 10.0) compared 
with women in the lowest respective quintile. The risk of 
one lifetime pregnancy was also significantly increased 
for women with BMI≥25 and the highest LDL and total 
cholesterol, as well as the lowest HDL quintiles (OR 1.8 
(95% CI 0.8 to 3.8),  1.2 (95% CI 0.6 to 2.4) and 2.6 (95% 
CI 1.3 to 5.3), respectively). Similarly, the ORs of having 
no pregnancy (in women with BMI≥25) were 1.7 (95% CI 
1.0 to 3.0), 2.8 (95% CI 1.7 to 4.7) and 3.6 (95% CI 2.1 to 
6.1) for women with the highest LDL, TG and TG:HDL-c 
ratio quintiles, respectively, compared with women with 
the lowest quintile. An increased risk of having no chil-
dren was also found for the overweight and obese women 
with the lowest HDL quintile (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.0). 
Unlike in one-child mothers, the risk of having no preg-
nancy among overweight and obese women with higher 
total cholesterol levels only slightly changed from the 
main results. In women with prepregnant BMI<25, there 
were significant trends in the risk of having one lifetime 
pregnancy across increasing levels of prepregnant TG (p 
trend=0.04), TG:HDL-c ratio (p trend=0.04) and HDL 
quintiles (p trend=0.05). There were increased risks of 
one lifetime pregnancy in the highest TG quintile (OR 
1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.0) and the two highest TG:HDL-c 
ratio quintiles (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.4; and OR 1.8, 
95% CI 1.2 to 2.8, respectively), as well as the lowest HDL 
quintile (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6). The risks of no and 
one lifetime pregnancy with higher LDL and total choles-
terol levels only slightly changed compared with our main 
results.
DIsCussIOn
Prepregnant lipid levels were associated with having one 
lifetime pregnancy. Women with high levels of LDL, TG 
and TG:HDL-c ratio, as well as low HDL levels, measured 
years before conception, were at increased risk of having 
only one lifetime pregnancy. High levels of LDL and 
total cholesterol were associated with having no children, 
while in overweight and obese women this was true for all 
the lipids examined.
These findings provide a possible biological underpin-
ning for a joint mechanistic pathway for reduced fertility 
and cardiovascular conditions.10 Our study suggests that 
the previously observed association between low parity 
and increased CVD risk may be confounded by pre-ex-
isting adverse lipid levels. This does not support the 
hypothesis that having additional pregnancies reduces

CVD risk.3 Rather, unfavourable lipid profiles may be 
related to both subfertility and later CVD.
There is a lack of studies evaluating the relation between 
preconception lipid levels and fertility in women. The 
LIFE (Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the Envi-
ronment) study found concentrations of free cholesterol 
to be associated with fecundity in both sexes.9 In contrast 
to our study, TGs and total cholesterol were not found 
to be significant in individual and couple-based adjusted 
models (as well as two other measured lipid components: 
phospholipids and total lipids); however, the authors used 
a different study design and lipid measurement methods. 
In accordance with our findings is the Framingham Heart 
Study, which detected a trend towards TG elevation and 
lower HDL serum levels among women with self-reported 
infertility (as not achieving pregnancy for ≥1 year).15 
The presence of HDL cholesterol and ApoB in follicular 
fluid from human oocytes suggests that these lipids play 
a direct role in reproduction.7 8 16 Previous animal studies 
have reported an association between dyslipidaemia and 
infertility.17 Posed explanations have been that abnormal-
ities in HDL metabolism including change in structure, 
concentration or function compromise female fertility.7 8 16 
It has been suggested that genetic polymorphisms that 
alter function in proteins engaged in cholesterol metab-
olism may affect human fertility.18 19 One of the possible 
molecular mechanisms could be through a mediating 
role of HDL on paraoxonase 1 activity. Paraoxonase is 
an HDL-associated enzyme that inhibits LDL oxidation, 
and thus protects cells from oxidative stress.20 Its stability 
and binding affinity are strongly influenced by changes 
in shape and size of HDL particles.21 These changes may 
lead to decreased antioxidative capacity and consecutively 
oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is associated with adverse 
cardiovascular and fertility outcomes, including athero-
sclerosis, PCOS, pre-eclampsia, endometriosis and infer-
tility.19 22 A recent study in women of reproductive age with 
upper normal ranges of thyroid-stimulating hormone has 
suggested a direct link between unfavourable lipid profile 
and increased oxidative membrane damage.23
Recent insights suggest TG:HDL-c ratio to be a reli-
able marker of insulin resistance and atherogenicity,24 
highlighting its ability to identify insulin resistance in 
apparently healthy individuals.25 Observed higher levels 
of TG:HDL-c ratio in our study are indicative of possible 
pre-existing metabolic risk factors among women with 
one lifetime pregnancy, as well as a subpopulation of 
nulliparous women (overweight, obese and with reported 
partners—as a proxy for exposed to pregnancy). This is 
also consistent with increasing rates of infertility in both 
sexes among population with metabolic syndrome.9 The 
higher proportion of diabetes in this group of women 
further supports this notion. In agreement, the Japan 
Nurses’ Health Study reported a significant increase in 
the risk of diabetes in young nulliparous women (<45 
years of age) with ovarian infertility.26 Accordingly, the 
Framingham Heart Study found infertile premenopausal 
women to have increased odds of diabetes and obesity.15 
Given the accompanying metabolic irregularities among 
major causes of female infertility,15 27 substantially higher 
proportion of IVF treatment among one-child mothers 
indirectly supports metabolic implications. The latter 
finding remains after exclusion of women older than 34 
years at the time of first delivery.
Dyslipidaemia is associated with PCOS.28–30 However, 
we only identified three women with PCOS in our study 
sample. Thus, the presence of subclinical forms or 
under-reporting may be present.
In accordance with the literature,27 31 the risk of having 
no and only one child showed strong effects in over-
weight and obese women (BMI ≥25) in stratified analyses 
(table 3). Nevertheless, the higher risk of having only one 
child remained in normal-weight women (BMI<25) with 
the lowest HDL quintile and the highest TG and TG:H-
DL-c ratio quintiles. These findings mirror observations 
from the literature of metabolic irregularities among 
normal-weight women as an independent risk factor for 
future fertility impairments.32 33 The LIFE study reported 
both female and male lipid concentrations to affect 
fecundity, irrespective of their BMI.9
Compared with women with two or more pregnancies, 
total cholesterol levels above clinically recommended 
range were associated with risk of having no children, 
irrespective of BMI. The LIFE study reported a higher 
percentage of women with a history of irregular menstrual 
cycles in the highest quartile of free cholesterol.9 The 
Japan Nurses’ Health Study found women with ovarian 
infertility to be at high risk of hypercholesterolaemia.26 
In our study, total cholesterol levels were not associated 
with the risk of having one lifetime pregnancy, except 
among overweight and obese women. This could suggest 
that total cholesterol levels play varied roles in different 
subfecundity or infertility subtypes. In addition, nullipa-
rous women in our study were older at examination and 
had higher BMI. Both age and obesity are associated with 
systemic oxidative stress.19 22 It is possible that in such 
physiological environment, clinically abnormal levels 
of certain lipids might activate additional pathological 
processes that adversely affect reproductive function.28
In our study, women with one lifetime pregnancy 
had poorer lifestyle factors (BMI, smoking), were older 
and less educated. The lower mean education among 
one-child mothers is in agreement with a Nordic demo-
graphic study,34 which shows that later onset of child-
bearing is related to a lower number of children finally 
born in women with low education. Given that educa-
tional level and occupation are key indicators of socioeco-
nomic status,35 observed lower parity among women with 
low education could also reflect unfavourable socioeco-
nomic position as a limiting factor to further pregnancies. 
However, a study exploring age at first birth, parity and 
postreproductive mortality suggests that late childbearing 
in itself may be a signal of pre-existing poor health of a 
woman.36

women and one-child mothers in our main results

(figure 2, table 2) could be explained by the hetero-
geneity of causes for childlessness among nulliparous 
women in this cohort. The risk may, therefore, be diluted 
by low-risk groups of women who are voluntarily child-
less37 or have not been exposed to pregnancy (ever). 
Given the lack of information on women’s reproductive 
planning in our data, we tried to address this in a subanal-
ysis including only women with reported partner (ever) as 
a proxy for being exposed to pregnancy. Here we found 
that the results for nulliparous women were similar to our 
main results for one-child mothers. Women with reported 
partner had higher risk of having no children (compared 
with partnered women with ≥2 births) if their TG and 
TG:HDL-c ratio levels were in the highest quintiles and 
HDL in the lowest quintile (OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.9 to 4.2; 
OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.0 to 4.1; and OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.7 to 3.6, 
respectively). These findings support the role of serum 
lipids in lifetime nulliparity among women with partners.
strengths and limitations
Our subset of women was from a large population-based 
health study with prepregnant health data. Linked data from 
the MBRN provided complete registration of total repro-
duction. The prospective design minimised the potential for 
bias. A weakness is that blood sampling was performed in 
a non-fasting state. Studies show that TG levels are sensitive 
to recent food intake, while cholesterol levels seem to be less 
affected.38 We addressed this by adjusting our analyses for 
time since last meal and the main results were unchanged, 
suggesting that non-fasting lipids are not likely to introduce 
a systematic bias. Non-fasting lipids have successfully been 
used in lipid and CVD research.9 39 40
The study lacked data on apolipoprotein E genotype, 
CRP (C-reactive protein) and thyroid tests/thyroid 
antibodies, factors that all are found to affect female 
fertility.23 41 No assessments of duration or temporal prox-
imity of OC use, dietary intake or stress were available; 
therefore, unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out. 
Smoking adversely influences female fertility,42 with most 
of its effects attributed to HDL cholesterol decrease.43 
We accounted for this in our analyses; however, smoking 
status of participants was only available at enrolment. The 
ethnic homogeneity of the included women may reduce 
the generalisability of our findings.
Unfavourable prepregnant lipid levels were associated 
with having no and one lifetime pregnancy. Women’s 
metabolic homeostasis is important for reproduction 
and also has cardiometabolic implications.32 44 Pre-ex-
isting poor lipid and metabolic profiles could represent 
one of the possible linkages between previously observed 
reduced fertility and later CVD.
