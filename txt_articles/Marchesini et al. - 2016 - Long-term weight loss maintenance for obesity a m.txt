Abstract: The long-term weight management of obesity remains a very difficult task, associ-
ated with a high risk of failure and weight regain. However, many people report that they have 
successfully managed weight loss maintenance in the long term. Several factors have been 
associated with better weight loss maintenance in long-term observational and randomized 
studies. A few pertain to the behavioral area (eg, high levels of physical activity, eating a low-
calorie, low-fat diet; frequent self-monitoring of weight), a few to the cognitive component 
(eg, reduced disinhibition, satisfaction with results achieved, confidence in being able to lose 
weight without professional help), and a few to personality traits (eg, low novelty seeking) and 
patient–therapist interaction. Trials based on the most recent protocols of lifestyle modification, 
with a prolonged extended treatment after the weight loss phase, have also shown promising 
long-term weight loss results. These data should stimulate the adoption of a lifestyle modification-
based approach for the management of obesity, featuring a nonphysician lifestyle counselor 
(also called “lifestyle trainer” or “healthy lifestyle practitioner”) as a pivotal component of the 
multidisciplinary team. The obesity physicians maintain a primary role in engaging patients, 
in team coordination and supervision, in managing the complications associated with obesity 
and, in selected cases, in the decision for drug treatment or bariatric surgery, as possible more 
intensive, add-on interventions to lifestyle treatment.

Introduction
The main challenge of obesity treatment is not weight loss, but long-term weight loss main-
tenance. This widely accepted view is supported by several studies indicating that a healthy 
weight loss of 5%–10% can be achieved through both behavioral1 and pharmacological 
treatments,2 but weight is gradually regained in a large percentage of individuals.
Weight loss maintenance is hindered by a complex interaction of environmental, 
biological, behavioral, and cognitive factors, which are only partly known.3 Their 
constellation is presented in Figure 1; they variably interact in individual patients to an 
extent that is difficult to forecast. This explains why a high number of individuals, after 
a successful weight loss period, regain most of the weight lost. However, a proportion 
of individuals successfully maintain a long-term weight loss,4 and the study of this 
cohort, who achieve the goal despite the strong pressures to regain weight, may help 
identify the factors associated with this desired outcome.
The most recent developments of comprehensive lifestyle modification programs 
combine dietary and physical activity recommendations with specific cognitive and

behavior strategies to improve patients’ adherence to a long-
term weight management. They confirm that a large subgroup 
of treated patients is able to maintain a healthy weight loss 
in the long term.5 These promising data have stimulated the 
development of multidisciplinary lifestyle modification teams 
aimed at providing patients with a comprehensive long-term 
management of obesity.
The aims of this narrative review are: 1) to provide a 
definition of weight maintenance; 2) to review the data on 
long-term weight loss maintenance; 3) to describe the char-
acteristics of individuals who successfully achieve long-term 
weight loss; 4) to review the evidence-based strategies to 
promote weight loss maintenance; 5) to describe a multidis-
ciplinary approach, based on lifestyle modification aimed at 
providing patients with a comprehensive long-term manage-
ment of obesity and its complications.
Definition of weight loss maintenance
In the past 20 years, several definitions have been proposed 
to define “successful weight loss maintenance”. Wing and 
Hill6 suggested that successful weight loss maintainers 
should be defined as “individuals who have intentionally 
lost at least 10% of their body weight and kept it off at least 
1 year”. Rossner7 proposed that a sustained weight loss of 
about 5%–10% of baseline body weight represents a definite 
degree of success. This goal has also been recommended by 
the 2013 AHA/ACC/TOS Guideline for the Management of 
Overweight and Obesity in Adults.8
The aforementioned definitions share the notion that 
 successful weight maintenance does not necessarily imply a 
large weight loss, but that a modest 5%–10% amount is suffi-
cient. From a clinical point of view, this amount of weight loss 
significantly reduces the risk of developing type 2  
diabetes 
in susceptible people,9 and eliminates most of the other risks 
associated with obesity.8 Moreover, this modest weight loss 
also improves psychological functioning, in particular, mood, 
body image, and binge eating.10,11
The Wing and Hill definition6 introduces two additional 
indicators of weight maintenance. First, weight loss should 
be intentional. This criterion is important because several 
studies reported that unintentional weight loss is common 
and may have causes and consequences totally different 
from intentional weight loss.12 Second, weight loss should be 
maintained at least 1 year. This criterion was set as a reason-
able target for research on the factors that enable individuals 
to maintain weight loss. However, it is obvious that the term 
“successful” would require a much longer period of weight 
maintenance, hopefully life-long.
Data on long-term weight loss 
maintenance
Only a few studies have tracked successful weight losers 
over long-term follow-up or assessed the effect of lifestyle 
modification programs on long-term weight maintenance.
The National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) was 
established in 1994 as a prospective investigation of long-term

Long-term weight loss maintenance
successful weight loss maintenance. In 2014, Thomas et al4 
reported a 10-year observation of self-reported weight loss 
and behavior change in 2,886 participants, recruited primarily 
through newspaper and magazine articles, who had lost at 
least 30 pounds (13.6 kg) and kept it off for at least 1 year. 
The mean weight loss of participants was 31.3 kg at baseline, 
23.8 kg at 5 years and 23.1 kg at 10 years. Of note, 87% of 
participants were still maintaining at least a 10% weight loss 
after 5 and 10 years. These impressive data show that long-
term weight loss maintenance is possible in self-selected 
weight losers.
The 1999–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey examined the prevalence and the correlates of 
long-term weight loss maintenance, defined as weight loss 
maintained for at least 1 year, in 14,306 US adults.13 The 
study found that more than one out of every six US adults 
who have ever been overweight or obese has accomplished 
long-term weight loss maintenance of at least 10%. Although 
the period of weight maintenance was much shorter than 
in the case of the NWCR, the study confirms that also in 
nonselected individuals in the community, long-term weight 
loss is possible.
A recent systematic review on the outcome of weight loss 
lifestyle modification programs found that at 1 year, about 
30% of participants had a weight loss $10%, 25% between 
5% and 9.9%, and 40% #4.9%.1 Weight loss reaches its 
peak within 6 months of the start of treatment, and in the 
absence of a weight maintenance program, the trend begins 
to reverse thereafter, with 50% of patients returning to their 
original weight after about 5 years.14 These data indicate that 
traditional lifestyle modification programs require a greater 
focus on long-term maintenance to be considered successful 
in real terms.15
Hopefully, trials based on the latest generation of weight 
loss lifestyle modification programs, including the most 
innovative and powerful cognitive behavioral procedures, 
should produce even better long-term results. The most 
striking example is the Look AHEAD (Action for Health 
in Diabetes) study, which assessed the effects of intentional 
weight loss on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in 
5,145 overweight/obese adults with type 2 diabetes, randomly 
assigned to intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) or usual care 
(ie, diabetes support and education [DSE]).16 At year 1, more 
ILI than DSE participants had lost $5% of their initial weight 
(68.0% vs 13.3%), with the ILI group showing an average 
weight loss of 8.5%, significantly greater than the 0.6% seen 
in DSE participants. At year 8, 88% of both groups completed 
an outcomes assessment, which revealed that ILI and DSE 
participants lost, on average, 4.7% and 2.1% of their initial 
weight, respectively. Among the ILI and DSE participants, 
50.3% and 35.7%, respectively, lost $5%, and 26.9% and 
17.2% lost $10%.17 These impressive figures show that 
well-conducted lifestyle modification programs can produce 
clinically meaningful long-term weight loss, but also that the 
Look AHEAD was not able to completely solve the problem 
of weight regain in a large percentage of its participants.
The 10-year follow-up of the data of the randomized 
clinical trial Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) showed that 
the cumulative incidence of diabetes, among adults at high 
risk, remained lower in the lifestyle group, compared with the 
metformin and placebo arms. This outcome occurred even 
if the original lifestyle group partly regained weight.18 The 
results of DPP underline that the effect of lifestyle modifica-
tion programs may produce significant health benefits even 
if the weight lost is partly regained.
A few data are also available on the long-term weight 
loss maintenance with pharmacotherapy. The XENDOS 
(XENical in the prevention of Diabetes in Obese Subjects) 
trial, for example, randomized 3,305 patients to lifestyle 
changes plus either orlistat 120 mg or placebo, three times 
daily in a double-blind, prospective study. After 4 years, the 
mean weight loss was significantly greater with orlistat than 
placebo (5.8 vs 3.0 kg), and the cumulative incidence of 
diabetes was only 6.2% with orlistat and 9.0% with placebo, 
corresponding to a risk reduction of 37.3%.19 Therefore, add-
ing weight loss drugs to the lifestyle modification programs 
not only improves long-term weight loss, but also reduces 
the incidence of diabetes.
Clinical characteristics of individuals 
who successfully achieve long-term 
weight loss
The study of the characteristics of individuals who success-
fully achieve long-term weight loss is a potential useful 
strategy to elucidate the factors implicated in the long-term 
maintenance of intentional weight loss. The pivotal  
studies 
and the most recent published reports are presented in 
Table 1.4,13,15,16,19–29
The NWCR, described in the “Data on long-term weight 
loss maintenance” section, is the most important and longest 
study assessing the characteristics of individuals who suc-
cessfully lost and maintained their weight loss, as well as the 
strategies they use to maintain their weight loss.30 In a large 
NWCR analysis, the members reported an average weight loss 
of 33 kg, which was maintained for more than 5 years. The 
main strategies adopted by members to keep a stable weight 
in the long term were:31 1) high levels of physical activity 
(about 1 hour per day); 2) eating a low-calorie, low-fat diet;

3) eating breakfast regularly; 4) self-monitoring weight; and 
5) maintaining a consistent eating pattern across weekdays and 
weekends. An encouraging result is that the chance of longer-
term success increases in members who had managed to keep 
their weight off for 2 years or more. Finally, low  
levels of 
depression and disinhibition, and medical triggers (ie, general 
practitioners or specialists promoting weight loss for medical 
reasons and/or having a family member with a heart attack) 
were also associated with weight maintenance.
A random digit-dial telephone survey that used a repre-
sentative sample of the US adult population compared the 
behavioral strategies adopted by successful individuals who 
maintained weight loss (ie, an average weight loss of 37 
pounds maintained for over 7 years) with those of individuals 
who regained weight and weight-stable controls. This study 
confirmed that maintainers reported higher levels of strenu-
ous physical activity, greater frequency of self-weighing, and 
continued use of more behavioral strategies to control their 
dietary fat intake.32
These reports, unfortunately, failed to answer the key 
question, namely, why some individuals persist in practicing 
weight-control behaviors, and therefore maintain long-term 
weight loss, while others abandon it. The fact that several 
individuals are able to maintain weight loss in the long term 
clearly demonstrates that the biological pressure on individu-
als to overeat in order to restore their original weight (the 
set-point theory)33 is not the only mechanism involved in 
weight regain. “Complex behaviors” involved in maintenance 
of long-term weight loss are in part influenced by conscious 
cognitive processes. Nevertheless, cognitive factors have 
largely been neglected in traditional weight-loss lifestyle 
modification interventions, which are based mainly on the 
principles of behaviorism. The lack of an intensive cognitive 
intervention has been suggested as one of the reasons for their 
limited effectiveness in promoting long-term weight loss.34
The QUOVADIS (QUality of life in Obesity: eVAluation 
and DIsease Surveillance) study, an observational study on 
1,944 treatment-seeking obese patients in 25 medical centers 
authorized to treat obesity by the Italian National Health 
Service,35 investigated several cognitive factors involved in 
the long-term weight loss. The study confirmed that some 
cognitive factors are associated with the amount of weight

lost (ie, increased dietary restraint and reduced  
disinhibition), 
while others are associated with long-term weight loss 
maintenance (ie, satisfaction with results achieved, con-
fidence in being able to lose weight without professional 
help).15 According to these data, there is an urgent need to 
evaluate the effectiveness of specific procedures and strate-
gies designed to address the cognitive variables associated 
with negative treatment outcomes. These strategies might 
help improve the long-term efficacy of weight-loss lifestyle 
modification programs.
The individual beliefs in the control over personal life 
(expressed by the concept of “locus of control”) have long 
been implicated in weight loss and weight loss maintenance, 
with conflicting results. Very recently, the large MedWeight 
study confirmed an association between an “internal” locus 
of control and weight loss maintenance; individuals with an 
internal locus of control (ie, subjects perceiving they have 
control over the environment and feeling able to control 
stimuli) tend to have longer and more sustained weight loss 
maintenance compared with subjects with “external” locus 
of control (ie, subjects perceiving that their life is regulated 
by something outside their control).25 The internal orientation 
of locus of control is intimately connected with self-efficacy, 
another psychological domain of interest for weight mainte-
nance.36 Notably, individuals with internal locus of control are 
more likely to lose weight and maintain weight loss without 
any external support.25
Personality traits are habitual patterns of behavior, 
thought, and emotion that are relatively stable over the years, 
differ across individuals, and may play a role in long-term 
weight loss by influencing behavior.37 Personality traits, 
psychological well-being, body image, and eating behaviors 
have been measured in the QUOVADIS II, an observational 
study of patients with obesity seeking treatment at eight 
Italian medical centers. Among personality traits and after 
adjusting for general confounders and eating disorder scores, 
only novelty seeking was significantly associated with the 
$10% weight loss goal at 12-month follow-up.38 Similar 
data were reported in a weight loss lifestyle modification 
program, in which low novelty seeking was the only personal-
ity trait discriminating between patients who were successful 
in losing $10% and those who were unsuccessful.39 These 
data support the observation that healthy dietary control and 
dietary restraint (ie, the cognitive control of food intake) are 
associated with low novelty seeking scores.40
The poor compliance with long-term weight loss pro-
grams may also be attributable to the attachment style of 
individuals. Support for this hypothesis comes from a study 
showing that 12-month weight loss was significantly greater 
in patients with secure attachment than in those with insecure 
attachment, and that the patient–therapist relationship was 
rated more positively by those with secure attachment.41 These 
data require replication in a different setting; they indirectly 
confirm that securely attached adults are more cooperative 
in a patient–therapist context,42 and that therapeutic alliance 
is pivotal in the treatment outcome of obesity.
Teixeira et al43 have recently published a meta-analysis on 
the determinants of healthy behavioral changes influencing 
weight loss and weight loss maintenance of subjects enter-
ing treatment programs. Thirty-five studies were included in 
the analysis; 42 possible mediators were selected, and their 
effects on weight loss/weight loss maintenance were assessed 
by stringent criteria. Overall, the analysis of medium-/
long-term weight control (limited to 21 studies) identified 
higher levels of autonomous motivation, self-efficacy and 
barriers, self-regulation skills (including self-monitoring), 
flexible eating restraint, and positive body image as positive 
mediators for weight maintenance. A few of them were also 
determinants of physical activity, whereas no consistent 
mediators were identified for healthy dietary intake. Overall, 
this analysis points to large differences in the psychological 
characteristics of the treatment-seeking obese population, 
which suggests it is necessary to move from a standardized 
to a tailored approach.
Strategies to promote weight loss 
maintenance
Several strategies have been evaluated to promote weight loss 
maintenance. Among them is the provision of an extended 
care model. Some data showed that group sessions delivered 
twice a month for 1 year after the weight loss phase, keeping 
patients in active treatment, help patients maintain the weight 
loss.44,45 There is also evidence that some people maintain 
large long-term weight losses with a long-term self-help 
group pressure and support.46 It has been speculated that an 
extended care model of treatment provides patients with the 
support and motivation needed to continue to practice weight 
control behaviors.47
Recent studies assessed the efficacy of different interven-
tions designed to improve weight loss maintenance, random-
izing patients, after a period of weight loss, to one of two 
active interventions or to a control group with 12–30 months 
of follow-up. The STOP Regain trial found that a face-to-face 
intervention and an Internet-based intervention, both empha-
sizing daily self-weighing and self-regulation, improved 
weight loss maintenance over a period of 18 months, in

Long-term weight loss maintenance
comparison with a control group, which received quarterly 
newsletters.21 This was mainly the case with the face-to-face 
program. The Weight Loss Maintenance trial found that, 
after 30 months, the participants allocated to the personal-
contact group regained 1.5 kg less weight than those in 
the self-directed group, whereas those in the interactive 
technology-based group regained only 0.3 kg less than those 
in the self-directed arm.22 The TOURS (Treatment of Obesity 
in Underserved Rural Settings) trial found that obese women 
from rural communities allocated to 26 biweekly sessions via 
telephone or face-to-face regained less weight (mean 1.2 and 
1.2 kg, respectively) than those in the education control group 
(mean 3.7 kg).23 Given the importance of motivation and sup-
port, a very recent feasibility trial of motivational interview-
ing showed that face-to-face and phone interviews improved 
retention in the study, and increased weight maintenance 
(–2.8 kg vs the control group).27 All these studies confirm that 
the extended care approach, with monthly or more frequent 
contacts, in person or via telephone or Internet, can improve 
successful weight loss. They also reduce the risk of weight 
regain during the maintenance phase, with the exception of 
eHealth interventions, where evidence for effectiveness is 
limited28 and was not confirmed in a meta-analysis.48
However, extended care is not easily accepted by all 
patients. In a study outside the research setting, only about 
15% of cases were still in continuous care after 3 years.20 
Future studies should be designed to identify the patients for 
whom extended care is more suitable, and those more likely 
to benefit from a shorter duration of treatment. Data from the 
QUOVADIS study indicate that older patients whose primary 
motivation for weight loss is improving health are more 
compliant in continuous care, while patients satisfied with 
the results they achieved with treatment, and those confident 
of self-managing additional weight loss may avoid weight 
gain without continuous professional assistance.20 Finally, all 
the studies of extended (rather than continuous or indefinite) 
treatment did not report sufficient follow-up to exclude the 
occurrence of weight regain after the end of treatment.
To maintain weight loss, individuals must adhere to 
behaviors that counteract physiological adaptations favoring 
weight regain.49 Physical activity has modest impact during 
the weight loss period, but becomes essential to weight main-
tenance.26 Unfortunately, the level of daily energy expenditure 
necessary to prevent weight regain is high compared with the 
modern-day lifestyle,50 and subjects with metabolic disorders 
do not perceive physical activity as a relevant component 
of healthy behavior.51 Although total daily energy expen-
diture is a strong predictor of weight maintenance in obese 
individuals,52 adherence to a prescribed exercise intensity 
and/or dose is quite low, also considering the perceived 
fatigue in accomplishing the desired intensity goals.53
In order to increase motivation and adherence, individu-
als experiencing problems during weight loss maintenance 
may be addressed to pleasant programs of leisure-time 
physical activity.54 Among leisure-time activities, dancing 
has a remarkable place;55 dance stimulates positive emotions, 
social interaction, and relationships in the community, while 
the acoustic stimulation and the music might strengthen the 
beneficial effects of aerobic exercise on cognitive functions.56 
In a pilot nonrandomized trial, a 6-month dance course 
was associated with similar weight changes but with lower 
dropout rates compared with self-selected physical activity 
programs.57 This underlines the importance of social support 
and pleasant activities to increasing adherence to lifestyle 
intervention programs and to maintaining long-term weight 
loss in motivated patients. Self-body perception, enhanced 
self-confidence, and social support may thus increase self-
motivation, facilitating weight loss maintenance in the long 
term, and overall quality of life.58
Another approach is to add long-term drug treatment to 
lifestyle change in patients who have been unsuccessful with 
diet and exercise alone.59 The potential effectiveness of this 
approach has been demonstrated by the XENDOS trial.19 
However, this strategy also does not completely fulfill the 
needs of obese individuals requiring treatment, for at least 
three reasons:60 1) most patients do not want to be treated with 
drugs; 2) the long-term use may be associated with adverse 
physical complications; and 3) there are situations (eg, preg-
nancy) in which the treatment would be inappropriate.
A final, scarcely tested strategy is the provision of portion-
controlled meals or meal supplements in the long term. An old 
study with positive results, reporting an average weight loss 
of 8% at 4 years,61 received partial confirmation in a study in 
which continuing education and support (monthly meetings) 
were continued after an intensive weight loss phase. During 
this 12-month weight maintenance phase, all subjects were 
encouraged to consume a minimum of 14 portion-controlled 
meals they had received, free of charge, during the weight 
loss phase.62 It is, however, unknown whether and how long 
this strategy may be maintained.
The role of the multidisciplinary team 
in long-term weight management
Lifestyle modification programs include a weight loss phase, 
consisting of 16–24 weekly sessions in 6 months, followed 
by a weight maintenance phase, which should last at least

1 year with monthly or more frequent contacts in person or 
by telephone.8 The strategies for weight maintenance differ 
from those used to achieve weight loss, and should include 
frequent self-weighing (at least weekly), the consumption of 
a reduced calorie diet, and high levels of physical activity 
(.200 minutes/week).8
In research settings, lifestyle modification programs have 
been usually delivered by trained nonphysician health profes-
sionals, such as dietitians, or subjects having master’s degree 
training in exercise physiology, behavioral psychology, or 
health education. Participants are educated in individual ses-
sions (as in the DPP),9 in groups of about 10–20 participants44 
or in a combination of group and individual sessions (as in 
the Look AHEAD study).16
The American Medical Association House of Del-
egates has recently declared obesity a “disease” requiring 
treatment,63 because of the multiple medical, psychological, 
and functional complications reducing life expectancy and 
impairing quality of life.64 In this context, these heteroge-
neous complications require a comprehensive assessment 
aimed at developing a multidimensional and individualized 
treatment,64 which is obviously better managed by a multi-
disciplinary team.
As mentioned earlier, the promising results from long-
term weight maintenance obtained by the new-generation, 
lifestyle modification programs should stimulate the physi-
cians within the multidisciplinary teams to receive adequate 
training in cognitive behavioral therapy to engage patients 
in lifestyle modification.65 Engaged patients should then be 
referred to trained lifestyle counselors (also called “lifestyle 
trainers” or “healthy lifestyle practitioners”)66 working 
closely with any other component of an ideal lifestyle 
modification unit (eg, dietitians, psychologists, physical 
activity supervisors), to implement both the weight loss 
phase and the long-term maintenance phase of the lifestyle 
modification. The physician supervising the team should 
also manage the medical and psychosocial complications 
associated with obesity, referring the patients to other 
physicians and health professionals according to specific 
comorbidities. Finally, the supervising physicians should 
periodically monitor the effects of treatment, both on life-
style and on weight outcomes, and consider the opportu-
nity to intensify the lifestyle approach with obesity drugs, 
residential rehabilitative treatment, and, in selected patients 
with severe obesity, bariatric surgery. This multidisciplinary 
approach based on lifestyle modification has the potential 
to address several obstacles to reach the optimum long-term 
management of obesity.
Conclusion
The difficulty in helping obese patients maintain a long-term 
weight loss has been challenged by recent studies showing 
that several individuals are able to maintain acceptable weight 
loss targets in the long term and by the promising results 
achieved by the new-generation lifestyle modification pro-
grams. These promising results should stimulate the adoption 
of multidisciplinary approaches based on lifestyle modifica-
tion for the management of obesity. Only comprehensive 
programs administered by noneclectic teams addressing 
any mediator of lifestyle modification, managing the several 
medical and psychological complications associated with 
obesity and, if indicated, coupling the lifestyle treatment with 
other interventions (eg, drugs, residential inpatient treatment, 
bariatric surgery) might be successful. The effectiveness and 
the cost-efficacy of a stepped-care approach should be evalu-
ated by future longitudinal observational studies.
