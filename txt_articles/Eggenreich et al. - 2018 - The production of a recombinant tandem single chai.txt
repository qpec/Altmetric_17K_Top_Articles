single chain fragment variable capable of
binding prolamins triggering celiac disease

Abstract
Background: Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common food-related chronic disorders. It is mediated by the
dietary consumption of prolamins, which are storage proteins of different grains. So far, no therapy exists and
patients are bound to maintain a lifelong diet to avoid symptoms and long-term complications. To support those
patients we developed a tandem single chain Fragment variable (tscFv) acting as a neutralizing agent against
prolamins. We recombinantly produced this molecule in E. coli, but mainly obtained misfolded product aggregates,
so-called inclusion bodies, independent of the cultivation strategy we applied.
Results: In this study, we introduce this novel tscFv against CD and present our strategy of obtaining active
product from inclusion bodies. The refolded tscFv shows binding capabilities towards all tested CD-triggering
grains. Compared to a standard polyclonal anti-PT-gliadin-IgY, the tscFv displays a slightly reduced affinity towards
digested gliadin, but an additional affinity towards prolamins of barley.
Conclusion: The high binding specificity of tscFv towards prolamin-containing grains makes this novel molecule a
valuable candidate to support patients suffering from CD in the future.

Background
Celiac disease (CD) is one of the most common
food-related chronic disorders with a prevalence of 1–
2% in Western nations [1, 2]. It is triggered by the diet-
ary consumption of storage proteins (prolamin, alcohol
soluble fraction of gluten) of wheat, barley, rye and
others [3, 4]. Up to date it is still not completely clear
which factors lead to the manifestation of CD. Genetic-
ally, patients carry genes for the human leukocyte anti-
gens HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, but also environmental
factors, like early exposure to dietary gluten, infection
and/or change in the bacterial flora of the intestine con-
tribute to this disorder [1, 3–5].
In patients with CD the uptake of gluten leads to the
secretion of autoantibodies and tissue transglutaminase
(TG2), as well as proinflammatory cytokines, such as
Interleukin (IL) 15, IL 21, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)
alpha and Interferon (IFN) gamma (Fig. 1) [1, 3]. Thus,
inflammations of the small bowel occur, ranging from
intraepithelial lymphocytosis up to total villous atrophy
combined with crypt hyperplasia [1, 3]. Hence, symp-
toms vary between asymptomatic, extra-intestinal mani-
festations, various abdominal complications, up to global
malabsorption [3, 6]. Long-term complications include
malignancy, such as intestinal lymphomas and adenocar-
cinoma [3, 7, 8].
To reduce symptoms and avoid long-term complica-
tions, a strict gluten free diet (GFD) is the only effective
treatment of CD so far [3]. Due to the high prevalence,
severe symptoms, long-term complications and limited
treatment possibilities, it is self-explanatory that patients
are in pressing need of additional and alternative therap-
ies. Many novel drugs are in development and the re-
sults of the respective clinical trials are impatiently
anticipated. As shown in Table 1 various novel therapies
are under development, however none of these has
reached clinical phase 3 investigations yet. Hence, unfor-
tunately no novel therapy will be introduced to the

 market in the near future. Next to this lack of thera-
peutic options, a high social burden lies upon patients
with CD, because a lifelong GFD is difficult to maintain.
Even in “gluten-free” dietary products traces of prola-
mins are found, which have a severe impact on the
well-being [10]. To support those patients we recently
developed a novel single chain Fragment variable (scFv)
against prolamins [11]. This scFv works as a “neutraliz-
ing agent”, meaning that a complex between prolamin
and the scFv is formed in the gut and no systemic inter-
actions are expected, as the formed complex does not
cross the epithelial barrier and is finally excreted. Thus,
the scFv can be applied as a medical device. To obtain
this novel scFv, we immunized chicken with peptic
tryptic digested gliadin (PT-gliadin). Those immunized
chicken were used as source for RNA, carrying the se-
quence for the recombinant scFv [11]. Since no effector
function of the antibody (AB) is relevant for the neutral-
izing effect, but only the variable light and heavy chain
are required, we generated a single chain Fragment vari-
able (scFv). Since two antigen binding regions increase
binding affinity, we joined two scFv with a peptide linker
and constructed a tandem single chain Fragment vari-
able (tscFv) [12, 13]. A block flow diagram of this
process is presented in Additional file 1: Figure S1.
We selected Escherichia coli as production organism
for recombinant tscFv, since E.coli is a common host for
scFv production, due to its advantages of high cell
density cultivations and high product titers [14–16].
Nevertheless, high translational rates, strong promotor
systems and intrinsic product features often result in the
formation of insoluble product aggregates, so-called
Inclusion
Bodies
(IB)
[17].

processing
(DSP) of IBs is laborious and contains several steps
Fig. 1 Adapted simplified pathogenesis of celiac disease [3, 5, 9]. Prolamin overcomes the epithelial barrier via a transcellular transport as a
soluble IgA-prolamin complex bound to an epithelial receptor (CD71). The interaction of prolamin with a chemokine receptor CXCR3 leads to the
release of Zonulin, a protein that increases the permeability of the epithelium, due to opening of Tight-junctions and hence allows paracellular
transport of prolamin. CD71, CXCR3 and Zonulin are upregulated in patients with celiac disease. Prolamin that reaches the lamina propria gets
deamidated by transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and hence binds more strongly to human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DQ2 and DQ8 molecules on
antigen-presenting cells. These presented prolamins activate CD4+T-cells, which then secrete proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, T-cells
induce the expression of Interleukin (IL) 15 and autoantibodies against TG2 by innate immune cells. IL 15 has a very important role regarding the
remodeling process of the intestinal surface. It leads to an upregulation of nonconventional HLA molecules, MICA on enterocytes, and activates
NKG2D receptors on intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). The interaction of MICA and NKG2D promotes the downstream effect of IEL-mediated
epithelial damage. Another source of IL 15 are epithelial and dendritic cells after contact with prolamin. To sum up, the contact of prolamin with
the epithelial layer activates the innate and humoral immune system, which induces the destruction of the surface of the small intestine

 including at least IB recovery, solubilization and refold-
ing as key unit operations [17, 18]. A typical IB process
is schematically shown in Fig. 2.
Besides the complexity of an IB process, the com-
monly low refolding yields describe further challenges
[18–20]. On the other hand, IBs describe an efficient
production strategy, not only because more than 30% of
the cellular protein can be produced as IBs, but also be-
cause IBs contain a high level of the recombinant prod-
uct, which is protected against proteolysis [18, 21].
In the current study, we recombinantly produced the
novel tscFv in E. coli as IBs, processed the IBs following a
standardized protocol and characterized the refolded
product. Summarizing, we introduce a novel, recombinant
tscFv as an interesting biological agent to treat patients
with CD.

 upstream of the his6-tag. Subsequently, the plasmid was
transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3) [11].
Bioreactor cultivations
Bioreactor cultivations were performed according to our
previous study [22]. In short, 500 mL pre-culture
(DeLisa medium [23]; 50 μg/mL Kanamycin) were used
to inoculate 4500 mL sterile DeLisa medium in a stain-
less steel Sartorius Biostat Cplus bioreactor (Sartorius,
Göttingen, Germany) with a working volume of 10 L.
After a batch (maximum specific growth rate (μmax):
0.6 h− 1; biomass end of batch: 8.1 g dry cell weight/L
(DCW/L)) and a non-induced fed-batch (μ: 0.09 h− 1;
biomass end of non-induced fed-batch: 47.6 g DCW/L)
for biomass (BM) generation, cells were induced with
0.5 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
at 30 °C for 10 h (μ: 0.05 h− 1; biomass end of induced
fed-batch: 56.2 g DCW/L). Throughout the whole culti-
vation pH was kept at 7.2 and dissolved oxygen above
40%. Biomass was harvested by centrifugation (179 g,
20 min, 4 °C) and stored at − 20 °C.
Sampling strategy Samples were taken at the beginning
and the end of the batch, non-induced fed-batch and in-
duced fed-batch. Specific product formation rates and
final product yields were calculated for the induction
phase of approximately 10 h. Dry cell weight (DCW) was
determined in triplicates, by centrifugation (21,913 g, 4 °C,
10 min) of 1 mL cultivation broth, washing the obtained
cell pellet with a 0.1% NaCl solution and subsequent dry-
ing at 105 °C for 48 h. Product, substrate and metabolites
were quantified as described in our previous study [22].
IB processing
IB recovery and purification
Prior to cell disruption, frozen BM was thawed at 4 °C
and suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. BM
concentration was adjusted to 10 g DCW/L. Cell disrup-
tion was performed by high-pressure homogenization
using a PandaPLUS 2000 (GEA Mechanical Equipment,
Parma, Italia). In total, 3 passages at 1500 bar were used
to disrupt the cells. These conditions were chosen based
on our previous study [24]. To limit heat generation,
BM was kept on ice and a cooling unit was connected to
the outlet of the homogenizer. Disrupted BM was centri-
fuged (15,650 g, 4 °C, 20 min) and the supernatant was
discarded. Then, IBs were washed with deionized water
(100 g wet weight/L (WW/L)). To ensure a homoge-
neous mixture, a T10 basic ULTRA-TURRAX® (IKA,
Staufen, Germany) was used (2 min, stage 5, 4 °C). The
suspension was centrifuged (15,650 g, 4 °C, 20 min) and
the supernatant was discarded. This wash procedure was
performed twice.
IB solubilization and refolding
100 g WW/L of washed IBs were resuspended in
solubilization buffer (50 mM TRIS, 2 M Urea, 10% v/v Gly-
cerol, pH 12; [18]). The suspension was kept in an Infors

 HR Multitron shaker (Infors, Bottmingen, Switzerland) at
room temperature (RT) at 100 rpm. After 60 min, the solu-
tion was centrifuged (15,650 g, 4 °C, 20 min) to remove in-
soluble cell components.
Refolding was performed by dilution. Solubilized IBs
were added to the refolding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 2 M
Urea, 10% v/v Glycerol, pH 8.5, adjusted from [25, 26]) to
reach a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, correspond-
ing to a 50-fold dilution. The refolding preparation was
kept at 14 °C and 100 rpm in an Infors HR Multitron
shaker (Infors, Bottmingen, Switzerland) for 48 h. Yields
were calculated based on HPLC measurements (see
section “HPLC measurement”).
Ultra- and diafiltration
Re-buffering
(50

pH 8.0) and concentration was performed with a Centra-
mate™ 500 S Tangential Flow Filtration System (Pall,
Austria; Vienna). Due to the calculated size of the tscFv
of 52.9 kD, a Centramate Cassette with a 10 kD cutoff
and 0.1 m2 filtration area was used. Transmembrane
pressure was kept below 0.7 bar. Prior to storage at −
20 °C, product aggregates were removed by filtration
(0.2 μm pore-size).
Biological assays
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
To reassure the ability of the refolded product to
neutralize antigens, ELISA analyses were performed. 96
well ELISA plates were either coated with 100 ng/well
PT-gliadin or coated with 1% w/v PEG 6000 as negative
control. We described the coating protocol as well as
the ELISA in detail in our previous study [11]. To reduce
unspecific interactions, samples containing refolded tscFv
or tscFv IBs were diluted with Tris-buffered saline
(24.8 mM Tris, 136.9 mM NaCl and 2.7 mM KCl, pH 8.0)
containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). 100 μL sample/well
were incubated for an hour at 25 °C and 450 rpm. Every
well was washed three times with 300 μL TBST. Subse-
quently, 100 μL of a 1:1000 dilution of Anti-Chicken IgG
(H + L), F(ab′)2 fragment-Peroxidase antibody produced
in rabbit (Sigma, Vienna, Austria) with TBST were added
per well and incubated at 37 °C and 450 rpm for an hour
(THERMOstar
microplate
incubator,
BMG
Labtech,
Ortenberg, Germany). Each well was washed four times
with 300 μL TBST. A color reaction was mediated by the
addition of 100 μL premixed 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzi-
dine
(TMB)
substrate
(Thermo
Scientific,
Vienna,
Austria), which reacted with the peroxidase. After 15 min,
50 μL of 0.9 M HCl were added as stop reagent. Absorb-
ance was measured at 450 nm in a Multiskan FC Micro-
plate Photometer (Thermo Scientific, Vienna, Austria).
Competitive ELISA
To determine the binding affinity of the refolded prod-
uct to a variety of prolamins of different flours, competi-
tive ELISAs were performed. For this purpose, flours of
different plants were digested with simulated gastric
fluid (0.1 mM pepsin from porcine gastric mucosa,
55 mM NaCl, pH 1.2) at 37 °C for 1 h. The digest was
centrifuged (2647 g, 5 min) and the pH of the super-
natant was adjusted to 8.5. Precipitating proteins were
removed by centrifugation (2647 g, 5 min) and the pro-
tein content of the supernatant was determined. Differ-
ent concentrations (1000, 500, 250, 125, 75, 0.01 and
0.0 μg total protein/mL) of these digested flours (rye,
barley, buckwheat, rice, maize, kamut, almond, soy, mil-
let, spelt and wheat) were added to the ELISA plate with
sample (refolded tscFv, tscFv IBs) and TBST, incubated
and developed as described in 2.4.1. Due to this setup
the
applied
digested
flours
and
the
immobilized
PT-gliadin were competing over tscFv. Samples, which
bound to predigested flours in the supernatant were
washed away and thus the absorption signal was re-
duced. As positive control, anti-PT-gliadin-IgY extracted
from egg yolk of PT-gliadin immunized hens was used.
Also, a standard competitive ELISA, where PT-gliadin
was competing against itself, was included.
Half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) IC50
values were calculated to exemplify competitive ELISA
results. The values show the total protein concentration
of predigested grains, which is necessary to reduce the
detectable signal by half. Low IC50 values indicate a high
affinity to the flours in the supernatant. IC50 values were
calculated using SigmaPlot (Systat Software, San Jose,
USA). A non-linear regression was performed and the
equation for standard and four parameter logistic curves
was used (Eq. 1).

Protein measurement
The protein content was determined using Bradford Coo-
massie Blue assay or Bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma-Al-
drich, Vienna, Austria). Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was
used as a standard. To stay in the linear range of the de-
tector (Genesys 20, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA) samples were diluted with the respective buffer.

 HPLC measurement
HPLC measurements were performed to gain informa-
tion about 1) the purity of the solubilized IBs and 2) the
purity and content of correctly refolded product. There-
fore, particle-free samples of 5 μl were analyzed by an
UltiMate™ 3000 HPLC with a MAbPac™ SEC-1 size ex-
clusion column and an UltiMate™ 3000 Multiple Wave-
length Detector (Thermo Scientific, Vienna, Austria).
The mobile phase was either a 50 mM BisTris buffer
containing 4 M Guanidinhydrochlorid (GnHCl) and
100 mM NaCl (pH 6.8) for solubilized IBs, or 100 mM
NaH2PO4 buffer containing 300 mM NaCl (pH 6.8) for
the refolded product, respectively. The system was run
with an isocratic flow of 100 μl/min at 25 °C column
oven temperature. Every HPLC run included measure-
ments of 29 kD, 43 kD and 75 kD size standards (Gel

Product identification/qualification
Product and host cell impurities in refolded product
were analyzed by SDS-Page and subsequent mass spec-
trometry (MS) analysis. Therefore, bands of interest were
excised from the gel, samples were digested with Trypsin
(Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and proteins were
S-alkylated with iodoacetamide. Peptides were extracted
from the gel by a couple of washing steps. The digested
samples were loaded on a BioBasic-18, 150 × 0.32 mm,
5 μm column (Thermo Scientific, Vienna, Austria) using
65 mM Ammonium formate buffer (buffer A) as aque-
ous solvent. A gradient from 5% B (B: 100% Acetonitrile)
to 32% B in 45 min was applied, followed by a 15 min
gradient from 32% B to 75% B that facilitated elution of
large peptides at a flow rate of 6 μL/min. Detection was
performed with MaXis 4G Q-TOF-MS (Bruker,Billerica
MA, USA) equipped with the standard Electrospray
ionization (ESI) source in positive ion, DDA mode (=
switching to MSMS mode for eluting peaks). MS-scans
were recorded (range: 150–2200 Da) and the six highest
peaks were selected for fragmentation. Instrument cali-
bration was performed using ESI calibration mixture
(Agilent, Vienna, Austria). Analysis files were converted
(using Data Analysis, Bruker) to MGF files, which are
suitable for performing a MS/MS ion search with GPM
(automated search engine). E.coli (strain K12) proteins
and product sequence were inserted in the database for
sequence identification.
Results
Production of tscFv
The fed-batch cultivation yielded 2.3 g IBs per L fermen-
tation broth corresponding to a specific titer of 0.041 g
IB/g DCW and a space-time-yield of 0.23 g IB/L/h in-
duction time. The strain-specific physiological parame-
ters are shown in Table 2.
IB processing
Buffers and methods for IB processing were either devel-
oped in a previous study [24] or adapted from literature
[18, 25, 26]. After cell disruption and IB wash, IBs were
solubilized followed by refolding. Under the chosen condi-
tions (100 mg WW IB/mL solubilization buffer, solubi-
lized for 1 h at room temperature) approximately 25 mg/
mL solubilized protein was found. This mixture of

 solubilized proteins mainly contained target protein, but
also different host cell proteins and other impurities were
found (Fig. 3a, d). HPLC measurements of the solubilized
IBs revealed a purity of at least 66.8%. This solubilized
protein mixture was added to a refolding buffer for 48 h.
The refolding yield was calculated with 41.5% target pro-
tein (Eqs. 2–5; Fig. 3b, d), prior to concentration and
re-buffering. After ultra- and diafiltration, another HPLC
measurement was performed. At this step, an increase of
impurities smaller than the target protein was found. The
resulting chromatogram (Fig. 3c) showed 29.5% correctly
folded target protein. Using Eqs. 2–5, the overall
refolding yield was calculated with 32.3% (Fig. 3d).
MS measurements
To investigate the purity of the refolded and diafiltrated
tscFv,
MS
analysis
was
performed.
Therefore,
the
refolded tscFv was applied on an SDS gel and the differ-
ent protein bands were excised and analyzed (Fig. 4).
The SDS gel showed four dominant protein bands,
which all contained the refolded product. Host cell pro-
teins were only found to a small portion in the lowest
band, indicating a high purity of the refolded product.
Biological assays
Binding capability of tscFv IBs
Literature has demonstrated that to some extent IBs can
exhibit biological activity [27–30]. Therefore, we com-
pared the binding capability of tscFv IBs and refolded
tscFv using both a PT-gliadin and a competitive ELISA
(Fig. 5). Figure 5a shows a PT-gliadin ELISA with
refolded tscFv and tscFv IBs. Low concentrations of
refolded tscFv led to no signal reduction of the ELISA,
hence even the lowest applied concentration of 0.4 μg/
Fig. 7 Competitive ELISA of refolded tscFv and flours considered as safe (a) as well as flours known to trigger CD (b). The ability of flours from
different grains to replace refolded tscFv from immobilized PT-gliadin was tested. The tscFv was applied in a concentration of 8 μg/ml with flours
in predefined total protein concentrations (0, 0.0075, 75, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 μg/mL). The relative signal in % is shown. 100% signal
corresponds to the signal obtained with tscFv without any flour

 mL saturated the assay. IBs, on the other hand, showed
a low signal intensity, meaning that even a 10-times
higher concentration of IBs (100 μg/mL) only led to a
fifth of the signal intensity compared to refolded tscFv
(10 μg/mL). Thus, a much higher IB concentration
would be needed to achieve similar results compared to
the refolded tscFv. This higher binding capacity of
refolded tscFv was also found using a competitive ELISA
(Fig. 5, b), where a 10 times higher concentration of IBs
was necessary to get comparable results. Summarizing,
although tscFv IBs show binding capabilities and do not
have to be further processed to capture prolamins,
higher concentrations of tscFv IBs are required to lead
to the same effect as refolded tscFv.
Comparison of refolded tscFv and anti-PT-gliadin-IgY
In our previous study we showed that soluble scFv and
standard anti-PT-gliadin-IgY displayed comparable bind-
ing capabilities [11]. In a similar fashion, we tested the
refolded tscFv against the model protein PT-gliadin and
flour digests of wheat, barley and buckwheat and com-
pared it to anti-PT-gliadin-IgY in a first comparative
feasibility experiment (Fig. 6). Wheat is known for its
high prolamin content (80% of total proteins; [31]). We
chose buckwheat as negative control, due to its reduced
prolamin content [32].
As depicted in Fig. 6a and b a reduced concentration
of PT-gliadin and digested wheat, respectively, was ne-
cessary to replace anti-PT-gliadin-IgY from immobilized
PT-gliadin. However, anti-PT-gliadin-IgY showed no affinity
to hordein, the prolamin of barley, whereas refolded tscFv
did (Fig. 6c). For buckwheat neither anti-PT-gliadin-IgY
nor refolded tscFv showed any neutralization capabilities
(Fig. 6d). This comparative feasibility experiment demon-
strated the desired biological activity of the refolded tscFv,
which is why we analyzed this novel molecule also with
flours of other grains.
Binding capabilities of the refolded tscFv
We analyzed the refolded tscFv in more detail for its
missing affinity towards digested flours, that are certified
as safe, namely maize, soy, buckwheat, almond, millet
and rice (exemplarily shown in Fig. 7a) as well as its
binding capabilities for prolamins known to trigger CD,
namely barley, rye, spelt, wheat and kamut (exemplarily
shown in Fig. 7b).
As presented in Fig. 7a, the tscFv showed basically no
activity with the flours of rice and millet. Slight re-
sponses observed for millet were due to the high con-
centration of digested flours, which led to a hindered
interaction of immobilized PT-gliadin and tscFv. Also
for the flours of other plants, which are basically
prolamin-free, namely maize, soy, buckwheat and al-
mond,
we
did
not
detect
any
biological
activity.
However, the tscFv bound to flours from grains contain-
ing prolamins, as exemplarily shown for wheat and
kamut in Fig. 7b. For better comparability, we calculated
IC50 values for these flours, which indicate the concen-
tration of PT-gliadin or digested flour, where the re-
spective signal of the ELISA was reduced by half
(Table 3). Low values indicate high affinity of tscFv
and vice versa. As shown in Table 3, the lowest value
of 5.79 was found for the pure antigen PT-gliadin,
followed by spelt and wheat. Since we found the de-
sired biological activity of the novel tscFv, we con-
cluded
that
it
represents
a
highly
interesting
treatment option for patients suffering from CD, since
it might be used as a medical device, which does not
interact with the immune system.
Discussion
CD is a chronic disease involving the innate and adap-
tive immune system [1]. The immune system of genetic-
ally predisposed individuals responds to the dietary
uptake of prolamin with inflammatory processes of the
small intestine [3]. Hence, a strict livelong GFD has to
be maintained and is currently the only option. However,
a GFD is challenging because of hidden prolamins and
costly dietary products, but also due to fear of prolamin
exposure and hence possible social isolation [4, 33].
Thus, alternative and additional therapies are highly an-
ticipated. In this study, we present a novel tscFv against
various prolamins as a potential therapeutic support for
patients with CD. The tscFv, selected from a chicken
gene library, was recombinantly produced in E.coli as
IBs. It is known that such molecules are difficult to ex-
press in E. coli in a soluble form [34]. We achieved an
IB titer of 2.3 g per L cultivation broth, corresponding to
4.1 mg tscFv/g DCW/h induction time. This productiv-
ity is comparable to other biopharmaceuticals, such as
Hirudin variant 1, where a specific productivity of
6.0 mg/g/h was achieved [35]. Even well-established pro-
cesses, such as the production of insulin, only give a
3-times higher productivity of 14.2 mg/g/h [36].
We demonstrated that the tscFv IB itself shows bio-
logical activity. However, compared to the refolded tscFv
at least 10-fold more tscFv IBs must be used to obtain a
comparable biological effect. This circumstance clearly
demands for the refolded product.
Renaturation of tscFv IBs, followed by ultra- and diafil-
tration, yielded 32% correctly folded target protein which
represents a typical refolding yield in literature [37, 38].
During the IB process around 40% of product fragmented.
However, we expect to further boost the refolding yield
and reduce fragmentation by 1) buffer optimization; 2)
determination of refolding kinetics and consequent adap-
tation of the process; 3) addition of stabilizers to reduce
fragmentation (MS results indicated that the peptide
Eggenreich et al. BMC Biotechnology  (2018) 18:30 
Page 10 of 12
 linker was not stable during IB processing); and 4) chan-
ging the strategy from batch refolding by dilution to
fed-batch refolding in the controlled environment of a
refolding vessel.
When we investigated the binding capabilities of the
tscFv with different flours, we found that lower concen-
trations of flours were capable to remove the standard
polyclonal anti-PT-gliadin-IgY than refolded tscFv. This
can be explained by the presence of product related im-
purities in the tscFv preparation (fragments) with lower
binding affinity, which were confirmed by MS and HPLC
analysis. Interestingly, anti-PT-gliadin-IgY showed no
neutralizing effect with flour from barley. Only at high
flour concentrations a reduction of the absorption signal
was observed. However, this reduction is more likely ex-
plained by the high concentration of digested flower ra-
ther than the biological activity of anti-PT-gliadin-IgY.
The tscFv not only shows a superior behavior towards
the prolamins of barley compared to anti-PT-gliadin-IgY,
but also compared to the scFv we examined in our pre-
vious study [11]. This higher binding affinity due to
dimerization (and multimerization) is known in litera-
ture [12, 13]. Our binding study of tscFv with flours
from different grains showed the desired outcome: tscFv
bound to prolamin-containing flours, whereas no activity
was detected with flours from grains, which are consid-
ered to be prolamin-free. We also performed an epitope
mapping of the tscFv. We were able to identify the core
epitope of the tscFv. The core epitope consists of an
amino acid sequence containing almost exclusively pro-
lines and glutamines - exactly those amino acids, which
are problematic to digest in the gluten fraction and are
contained in problematic prolamins. It also showed that
the tscFv is binding to the 33-mer prolamin sequence,
which is considered the most immune-toxic one, al-
though with low affinity.
For a future application of this molecule we intend to
deliver
the
tscFv
to
the
intestine
without
getting
destroyed by the hostile environment in the stomach.
Packing the tscFv in micropellets coated with a gastric
acid resistant film - traditionally by using shellac - is a
suitable option for that purpose and has already proven
to be extremely useful for two of our previous products
(DAOsin® and FRUCTOsin®). The galenic formulation in
micropellets has two advantages. First, some micropel-
lets pass the stomach very fast (like liquids) because they
are not retarded by the pylorus. This ensures that tscFv
is instantly provided together with prolamin containing
food. Secondly, the micropellets staying in the stomach
are delivered gradually with the chyme - constantly sup-
plying tscFv. Furthermore, in a first feasibility experi-
ment we tested the stability of the tscFv in the presence
of two prominent enzymes in the stomach – namely
trypsin and chymotrypsin – and still found more than
50% of its initial biological activity after a 4 h incubation
time (data not shown). In summary, we present a novel
molecule, which can help patients suffering from CD.
Our tscFv binds prolamins and can be used as a medical
device. In vitro studies with Caco cell lines were promis-
ing and in vivo toxicity studies are currently ongoing.
Conclusion
Here we present a novel tscFv as an interesting medical
device to support patients suffering from celiac disease.
We show the production of this molecule as insoluble
protein aggregates in E. coli, called inclusion bodies, and
the subsequent processing to obtain correctly folded and
active product. Finally, we demonstrate the biological ac-
tivity of this tscFv and compare it to a standard
anti-PT-gliadin-IgY. Overall, we believe that the tscFv
will be an important therapeutic support, leading to re-
duced dietary complications triggered by the consump-
tion of prolamins for patients suffering from celiac
disease.
