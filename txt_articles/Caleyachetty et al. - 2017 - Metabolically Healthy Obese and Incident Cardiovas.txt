Abstract 
 
Background: Previous studies have been unclear about the cardiovascular risks for 
metabolically healthy obese individuals.  
Objectives: We aimed to examine the associations of metabolically healthy obese with 4 
different presentations of incident cardiovascular disease in a contemporary population.   
Methods: We used linked electronic health records (1995 to 2015) in The Health Improvement 
Network (THIN) to assemble a cohort of 3.5 million individuals, 18 years or older and initially 
free from cardiovascular disease. We created body size phenotypes defined by BMI categories 
(underweight, normal weight, overweight and obesity) and three metabolic abnormalities 
(diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia). The primary endpoints were the first record of one 
of 4 cardiovascular presentations [coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, heart 
failure, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD)].  
Results: During a mean follow-up period of 5.4 years, obese individuals with 0 metabolic 
abnormalities had a higher risk of CHD (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.49, 95% CI 
1.45, 1.54), cerebrovascular disease (1.07, 95% CI 1.04, 1.11) and heart failure (1.96, 95% CI 
1.86, 2.06) compared to normal weight individuals with 0 metabolic abnormalities. Risk of CHD, 
cerebrovascular disease and heart failure in normal weight, overweight and obese individuals 
increased with increasing number of metabolic abnormalities.  
Conclusion: Metabolically healthy obese individuals had a higher risk of coronary heart disease, 
cerebrovascular disease and heart failure than normal weight metabolically healthy individuals. 
Even individuals who are normal weight can have metabolic abnormalities, and have similar 
risks for cardiovascular disease events. 
 
Key words: Cardiovascular diseases, Metabolically healthy obese, Phenotype  
 
Condensed abstract 
Whether individuals who are metabolically healthy obese (MHO) are associated with excess risk 
of cardiovascular disease remains a subject of debate. The present study of 3.5 million adults 
examines and compares associations between body size phenotypes with or without metabolic 
abnormalities and incident cardiovascular disease. Our results suggest that individuals who are 
MHO are at higher risk of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and heart failure than 
normal weight metabolically healthy individuals. Clinicians additionally need to be aware that 
individuals with a normal BMI can have metabolic abnormalities, and therefore be at high risk 
for cardiovascular disease events.

Introduction 
Obesity, an established risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (1), has been increasing 
globally over the past four decades (2). Metabolic abnormalities such as hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, and dysglycemia are known to mediate its effects, (3) however the clustering of 
obesity-related metabolic abnormalities varies widely among obese individuals. A subset of 
obese individuals without obesity-related metabolic abnormalities are often referred to as being 
“metabolically healthy obese” (MHO) (4-8). 
Three meta-analyses (9-11), have demonstrated that compared with metabolically healthy 
normal-weight individuals, obese individuals are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease 
events. Whether MHO is associated with excess risk of cardiovascular disease remains a subject 
of debate, because of important limitations to the evidence base. The main limitation is the 
inconsistent definition of metabolic health across studies. Previous studies have also not 
compared the association of MHO and a wide range of cardiovascular disease events such as 
cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Additionally, 
potential confounders have been inconsistently controlled for across studies, and there are a 
limited number of studies that have examined other metabolically defined body size phenotypes. 
We sought to address these limitations in a large contemporary cohort, based on linked 
electronic health records, which combine routine information about diagnoses, risk factors, and 
medication use with future cardiovascular disease events. Our objective was to examine 
associations between body size phenotypes (underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese) 
with or without metabolic abnormalities (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) and incident 
coronary heart disease (angina, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction), cerebrovascular 
disease (transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke), heart failure, and 
peripheral vascular disease. We tested the hypothesis that compared with metabolically healthy 
 4 
(i.e. no metabolic abnormalities) normal weight individuals, MHO individuals are at increased 
risk for cardiovascular disease events. 
Methods 
Study design and setting 
We undertook a cohort study with prospectively collected data from The Health 
Improvement Network database (THIN), which contains computerized  primary care records 
from primary care physicians who use the Vision IT system and have agreed at the practice level 
to participate [covering 6.2% of the United Kingdom (UK) population]. THIN captures 
diagnoses, prescriptions, and tests from primary care, and referrals to specialists, hospital 
admissions, and diagnoses made in secondary care, which are typically reported back to the 
primary care physician. They record lifestyle (e.g. smoking status) and anthropometric 
measurements (e.g. height, weight); these measurements could be recorded at patient 
registration, opportunistically during care, or as deemed clinically relevant by the primary care 
physicians. THIN data is representative of the UK population (12), and comparisons to external 
statistics and other independent studies have shown that both the clinical diagnostic and 
prescribing information is well recorded and accurate (12,13). Data collection began in January 
1995, and we used all data to September, 2015. For this study, approval was obtained via THIN’s 
independent Scientific Review Committee in August 2016 (SRC reference number: 
16THIN078). 
Participants 
We included all persons in THIN aged 18 years older with BMI data. Patients were only 
eligible to take part once their general practices had implemented the VISION IT system.  Study 
entry began 12 months after registration to minimize the chance that cardiovascular disease 
events recorded after registration reflected pre-existing or historical disease. We assigned the 
 5 
first BMI record from the registration date or the first one recorded after the VISION IT system 
was initiated. Individuals with any record of cardiovascular disease events before study entry 
were excluded. 
Exposure 
BMI was defined as body weight (kilograms) divided by height (meters) squared, and 
expressed in kg/m2 at study entry. We defined individuals as having diabetes and hypertension 
by coded diagnoses (READ codes) recorded in THIN at study entry (Online Table 1). We 
defined individuals as having hyperlipidemia on the basis of whether individuals had  specific 
prescription records of lipid-lowering agents. Individuals who developed diabetes, hypertension 
or hyperlipidemia during follow-up were analyzed according to their baseline status of no 
diabetes, hypertension or hyperlipidemia. 
Body size phenotypes were defined using WHO criteria as follows: underweight (BMI < 
18.5 kg/m2), normal-weight (18 kg/m2 >BMI<25 kg/m2), overweight (25 kg/m2 ≥ BMI 
< 30 kg/m2) and obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). The three metabolic abnormalities were summed to 
create a metabolic abnormalities score (0, 1, 2 and 3). Persons were categorized into 14 body size 
phenotypes: underweight with 0 metabolic abnormalities, underweight with 1 or more metabolic 
abnormalities, normal weight with 0 metabolic abnormalities, normal weight with 1 metabolic 
abnormality, normal weight with 2 metabolic abnormalities, normal weight with 3 metabolic 
abnormalities, overweight with 0 metabolic abnormalities, overweight with 1 metabolic 
abnormality, overweight with 2 metabolic abnormalities, overweight with 3 metabolic 
abnormalities, obese with 0 metabolic abnormalities, obese with 1 metabolic abnormality, obese 
with 2 metabolic abnormalities, and obese with 3 metabolic abnormalities.  
Outcomes 
 6 
The endpoints were the first record of one of the following 4 presentations of 
cardiovascular disease: coronary heart disease (angina, ischemic heart disease, myocardial 
infarction), cerebrovascular disease (transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic 
stroke), heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease. Any events occurring after the first 
cardiovascular disease presentation were ignored. Endpoint definitions are described in Online 
Table 2.  
Covariates 
Participant’s age, sex, self-reported smoking status, and social deprivation were included 
in models. Data recorded at study entry was used to classify participants as never smokers, ex-
smokers, or current smokers.  Social deprivation was included as quintiles of the index of 
multiple deprivation (14), a score calculated for each participant's neighborhood on the basis of 
social indices such as income, education, and employment. 
Statistical analysis 
Of the 4,091,344 million individuals aged 18 years or older in THIN without a history of 
CVD, we excluded persons with missing data on sex (128,458/4.09 million [3.1%]), BMI 
(161,699/4.09 million [4.0%]), smoking (53,262 /4.09 million [1.3%]) and social deprivation 
(252,148 /4.09 million [6.2%]).  After these exclusions, there remained a final sample of 
3,495,777 participants (85.4% of the eligible sample). Those excluded due to missing 
information were less likely to be male (41.4% vs. 43.1%; p < 0.001), younger (41.1 years vs. 
44.7 years; p < 0.001), have a lower BMI (25.9 kg/m2 vs. 26.4 kg/m2; p < 0.001), more likely to 
belong to the most deprived quintile (14.5% vs. 14.0%; p < 0.001) and more likely to be current 
smokers (25.1% vs. 24.6%; p < 0.001). 
Follow-up was censored at the occurrence of first cardiovascular disease endpoint, death, 
 7 
de-registration from the practice, or the last data collection for the practice, whichever occurred 
first. We used Cox proportional hazard models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between each body size phenotype with or without 
metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular disease event. We adjusted for age at BMI record, 
sex, self-reported smoking and social deprivation. We assessed the proportional hazards 
assumption by visually checking the Kaplan-Meier curves and tested it using Schoenfeld 
residuals. In sub-group analyses, we stratified associations by sex and age (<65 y, ≥ 65 y). The 
cut-off at 65 years was chosen as this is commonly used to designate an individual as an older 
person (15). In sensitivity analyses we defined metabolic status by diagnostic or prescription 
codes as well as laboratory or physical measurements; adjusted analyses for hormone 
replacement therapy (HRT) and oral contraceptives, respectively; and excluded patients with 
type 1 diabetes. Residual confounding by cigarette smoking has been suggested as a possible 
explanation for inconsistent associations between obesity and PVD (16). Excess risk for 
cardiovascular disease events associated with low BMI can also be associated with smoking-
related diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer). 
Therefore, in sensitivity analyses we examined body size phenotypes with or without metabolic 
abnormalities and cardiovascular disease events only among individuals who reported never 
smoking cigarettes.   
Results 
Among 3,495,777 individuals, 2.7% were classified as underweight with no metabolic 
abnormalities, 37.7% were classified as normal weight with no metabolic abnormalities, 25.7% 
were classified as overweight with no metabolic abnormalities, and 14.8% were classified as 
obese with no metabolic abnormalities (Online Table 3). The prevalence of 3 metabolic 
 8 
abnormalities was rare regardless of the weight category, with underweight individuals having 
the lowest (0%) (Online Table 3). Metabolically healthy obese individuals were more likely to be 
younger, male, current smokers and socioeconomically deprived compared with metabolically 
unhealthy obese individuals (Table 1). 
There were 154,051 (4.4%) deaths and 1,182,658 (30.8%) patients transferred out of their 
general practice.  Over a mean 5.4 year follow-up, there were 165,302 initial cardiovascular 
disease presentations: 61,546(37.2%) developed CHD, 54,705 (33.1%) developed 
cerebrovascular disease, 25,254 (15.3%) developed heart failure and 23,797 (14.4%) developed 
PVD. Incidence rates of cardiovascular disease events by body size phenotype and metabolic 
status are shown in Online Tables 5-7. Among initially metabolically healthy overweight 
individuals, approximately 1.9% of developed diabetes, 9.4% developed hyperlipidemia, and 
7.2% developed hypertension. Among initially MHO individuals, approximately 5.6% developed 
diabetes, 11.5% developed hyperlipidemia, and 10.5% developed hypertension. 
The Central Illustration depicts the associations between the 14 body size phenotypes 
with or without metabolic abnormalities and cardiovascular disease events (CHD, 
cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, and PVD) with the normal weight 0 metabolic 
abnormalities group as the reference. 
Coronary heart disease 
Individuals who were overweight with 0 metabolic abnormalities (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.27, 
1.34) and obese with 0 metabolic abnormalities (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.45, 1.54), had an increased 
risk of coronary heart disease, compared to normal weight individuals with no metabolic 
abnormalities after adjustment for potential confounders (central illustration). Risk of coronary 
heart disease in the normal weight, overweight and obese groups increased with increased 
 9 
number of metabolic abnormalities (Central Illustration).  
Cerebrovascular disease 
Individuals who were underweight (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.23, 1.40) and obese with 0 
metabolic abnormalities (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04, 1.11) had an increased risk of cerebrovascular 
disease, compared to normal weight individuals with no metabolic abnormalities after adjustment 
for potential confounders (central illustration). Risk of cerebrovascular disease in the normal 
weight, overweight and obese groups increased with the increasing number of metabolic 
abnormalities (Central Illustration). 
Heart failure 
Individuals who were underweight (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.23, 1.51), overweight with 0 
metabolic abnormalities (HR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06, 1.16) and obese with 0 metabolic abnormalities 
(HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.86, 2.06) had an increased risk of heart failure, compared to normal weight 
individuals with no metabolic abnormalities after adjustment for potential confounders (central 
illustration). Risk of heart failure in the normal weight, overweight and obese groups increased 
with increased number of metabolic abnormalities (Central Illustration). 
Peripheral vascular disease  
Individuals who were underweight had an increased risk of PVD (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.36, 
1.63), compared to normal weight individuals with no metabolic abnormalities after adjustment 
for potential confounders (central illustration).  Individuals who were overweight with 0 
metabolic abnormalities (adjusted HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88, 0.96) and obese with 0 metabolic 
abnormalities (adjusted HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86, 0.96) had a decreased risk of PVD compared to 
normal weight individuals with no metabolic abnormalities (central illustration). Risk of PVD 
 10 
increased with the number of metabolic abnormalities in the normal weight, overweight and 
obese groups (central illustration).  
Sub-group analyses 
We undertook several sub-group analyses (Online Tables 8-15). There was some 
evidence that the risk of cerebrovascular disease in overweight and obese individuals without 
metabolic abnormalities, heart failure in overweight individuals without metabolic abnormalities, 
differed significantly by sex. Females had stronger positive associations with cerebrovascular 
disease and heart failure compared to males. There was some evidence that the risk of CHD, 
cerebrovascular disease, heart failure and PVD in overweight and obese individuals without 
metabolic abnormalities differed significantly by age. Individuals < 65 years had significantly 
stronger positive associations with CHD, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure and PVD than 
individuals ≥ 65 years. Among overweight and obese individuals without metabolic 
abnormalities, age-stratified analyses revealed significant positive associations with PVD.  
Sensitivity analyses 
When metabolic status was derived from diagnostic codes or prescription records as well as  
laboratory/physical measurements, the magnitude of associations between the body size 
phenotypes and metabolic status with CHD, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure and PVD were 
generally larger (Online Tables 9, 11, 13, & 15). For metabolically healthy overweight or obese 
groups, the negative association with PVD became non-significant (Online Table 15). Further 
adjustment for HRT or oral contraceptives did not significantly change the estimates (Online 
Tables 9 & 11). Exclusion of participants with type 1 diabetes did not significantly alter the 
results (Online Tables 9, 11, 13, & 15). In analyses restricted to individuals who reported they 
never smoked cigarettes, individuals who were obese with no metabolic abnormalities, had a 
 11 
significantly stronger positive association with PVD (Online Table 15). For individuals who 
were underweight with no metabolic abnormalities, we repeated analyses only in those who 
reported they never smoked cigarettes. This did not significantly alter the results, with the 
exception that the positive association with cerebrovascular disease became non-significant 
(Online Table 15). 
Discussion 
In this study of approximately 3.5 million individuals accruing 165,302 cardiovascular 
disease events during 5.4 years average follow-up, we showed that individuals who are obese 
and classified as metabolically healthy (either no metabolic abnormalities, 1 or 2) are still at an 
increased risk for CHD, cerebrovascular disease and heart failure compared with individuals who 
are normal weight with no metabolic risk factors. These associations were not dependent on 
participants’ sex. Approximately, one in ten who were normal weight had metabolic 
abnormalities and had increased risks for CHD, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure and PVD 
compared to normal weight individuals without metabolic abnormalities. 
Although three meta-analyses (9-11) have assessed the risks of cardiovascular disease for 
the MHO phenotype, these each had limitations. The meta-analysis of Kramer et al (10) 
demonstrated that MHO individuals had increased risk for cardiovascular disease events 
compared with metabolically healthy normal-weight individuals. However, their findings were 
controversial. The meta-analysis roughly merged cardiovascular disease events and all-cause 
mortality together to calculate the pooled risk estimates for MHO individuals. Another limitation 
of the meta-analysis was the fact that it did not adequately adjust for important baseline factors, 
including age, and sex. Similarly, in the meta-analysis of Fan et al (11), they did not differentiate 
cardiovascular disease events and all-cause death events separately, but merged them together to 
 12 
calculate the pooled risk estimate. Whereas, in our study we examined MHO with the incidence 
of specific cardiovascular disease events (i.e. CHD, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure and 
PVD) based on validated electronic health records (17-19). We were also able to adjust for 
important baseline factors including age, sex, smoking status and socio-economic deprivation. 
Recently, Zheng et al (9) meta-analysis attempted to examine the association between MHO and 
cardiovascular disease events in only studies using the strictest definition for metabolic health 
(absence of all metabolic abnormalities). They found an insignificant association between MHO 
and cardiovascular disease events, however only 2 studies provided data and, as such, the 
statistical power was limited to detect significant associations. In our study, we had 
unprecedented statistical power to examine obese individuals classified by the number of 
metabolic abnormalities, potentially reflecting several definitions of the ‘metabolically healthy’ 
phenotype in relation to a range of cardiovascular disease events. 
Being metabolically unhealthy, regardless of BMI, generally conferred increased risk for 
cardiovascular disease events and normal weight status did not necessarily indicate metabolic 
health. Some individuals with normal weight have previously been reported to have elevated 
metabolic abnormalities (20,21). In the United States, the Preventive Services Task Force 
currently recommends that clinicians in primary care settings use overweight and obesity as the 
main criteria to screen adults for abnormal blood glucose as part of cardiovascular risk 
assessment (22). This could result in the failure to identify metabolic abnormalities in many 
patients.  Early detection and management of normal weight individuals with metabolic 
abnormalities may therefore be beneficial in the prevention of cardiovascular disease events. We 
found that underweight individuals had an increased risk of cerebrovascular disease, heart 
failure, and PVD. The impact of underweight on cardiovascular disease events has been 
 13 
understudied, with most previous research not evaluating underweight individuals separately 
from normal weight individuals. (3,23) Excess risk for cardiovascular disease events associated 
with low BMI may be related to smoking-related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) and lung cancer. To minimize this possibility, in sensitivity analyses we only 
examined the association between underweight with no metabolic abnormalities and 
cardiovascular disease events restricted to individuals who never reported smoking cigarettes. 
The results were unchanged from the main results with the exception that underweight 
individuals with no metabolic abnormalities now had a non-significant risk for cerebrovascular 
disease.  
Our finding that obesity was associated with a lower risk of PVD was surprising, 
considering that it may influence the atherosclerotic process (24). Previous studies on the 
association between obesity and PVD have been inconsistent (16). In the Israeli Ischemic Heart 
Disease Project (25), those with new-onset intermittent claudication had a higher BMI than those 
who remained symptom free. Other large population-based studies however have failed to 
demonstrate that obesity increases risk for PVD (26-28), with some studies even reporting a 
reduction in risk for PVD (29-31). In the Framingham Study Cohort, relative weight was found 
to be inversely associated with intermittent claudication (30). One potential explanation for this 
is residual confounding by cigarette smoking (cigarette smoking is strongly associated with both 
PVD and lower BMI) (16). In sensitivity analyses, restricted to individuals who were obese with 
no metabolic abnormalities and reported never smoking cigarettes, risk for PVD was increased, 
compared to normal weight individuals with no metabolic abnormalities. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest prospective study of the association 
between body size phenotypes with or without metabolic abnormalities (including MHO) and a 
 14 
range of incident cardiovascular disease events, with unprecedented precision and power. 
Dividing our participants into four BMI groups according to the classification provided by World 
Health Organization, gave us the possibility of a more granular analysis of the CVD risk in the 
different body size phenotypes.  
Several limitations of our study however require careful consideration. BMI has many 
advantages as a surrogate of body fat, such as simplicity and reproducibility (32) however we are 
unable to distinguish differences between high percentage of body fat and preserved or increased 
lean mass, particularly in participants with a BMI <30 kg/m2. Even though patients registered in 
THIN are representative of the general UK adult population (12), persons with a BMI 
measurement might not necessarily be representative of the general population. BMI data if not 
recorded at registration, tends to be opportunistically recorded (i.e. recorded when the patient is 
attending for other reasons or when the matter is of direct clinical importance). We limited this 
possibility by only using the first BMI recorded from the registration date (because they would 
have probably been recorded for administrative and not health reasons). Our findings are drawn 
from baseline measurements of BMI and metabolic abnormalities. Considering the difficulty in 
losing weight, it is more likely that individuals transition to higher weight (i.e. normal 
weight/overweight to obese) categories than transition to lower weight categories (i.e. obese to 
overweight/normal weight) (10). Thus, the potential misclassification effect of changes in weight 
over time was probably conservative. In our study, a small proportion of individuals who were 
initially metabolically healthy overweight or obese did progress to metabolically unhealthy 
overweight or obesity. Therefore, due to changes in metabolic abnormalities, a degree of 
misclassification, did occur. We did not have access to appropriate data on diet or physical 
activity, and therefore could not examine for example, whether physical activity could modify 
 15 
the association between MHO and incident cardiovascular disease. Patients were defined as 
having diabetes or hypertension utilizing diagnostic codes and hyperlipidemia was defined 
utilizing prescription codes.  Given that a proportion of individuals with metabolic abnormalities 
may be undiagnosed in the UK (33,34) we used available measures of HbA1c, blood pressure 
and serum lipids to minimize misclassification error. Additionally, given that improvement of 
glycemic, blood pressure, or lipid control obtained through treatment can prevent cardiovascular 
disease events in the long term, we may therefore expect that optimally treated/controlled 
patients would have a reduced risk of developing a cardiovascular disease events compared to 
those who are uncontrolled, and therefore our HR estimates would be conservative. The 
proportion of participants who transferred out of their practice was high (30.8%).  However, the 
difference between the proportion of participants who were obese with no metabolic 
abnormalities transferring out of their practice and those who remained in their practice was 
small (13.0% vs. 16.0%), and therefore less likely to bias the HRs substantially.  
Taking into consideration the genetic heterogeneity related to obesity (35), it is not 
implausible to assume that a distinct, benign phenotype in terms of CVD risk may be present. Of 
the body size phenotypes, MHO has been the most commonly examined phenotype (36), and it 
has been suggested that the concept of metabolically healthy obesity might be important in the 
stratification of individuals in the clinical treatment of obesity (36). Some researchers have called 
for a shift in the public health focus away from markers of adiposity such as BMI (37) and 
suggest that health providers prescribing weight loss interventions may be misusing time and 
resources (38). Our study robustly challenges the assertion that MHO is a benign condition and 
adds to the evidence base that MHO is a high-risk state for future cardiovascular disease events.  
Conclusions 
 16 
Individuals who are obese with no metabolic abnormalities are at higher risk of coronary 
heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and heart failure than normal weight metabolically healthy 
persons. Clinicians need to be aware that individuals who would otherwise be considered non-
obese, based on a normal BMI, can have metabolic abnormalities, and therefore also be at high 
risk for cardiovascular disease events.

Perspectives 
Competency in patient care and medical knowledge: Metabolically healthy obesity is a 
unique body size phenotype that apparently protects people from the metabolic complications of 
obesity including cardiovascular disease. However, whether these individuals are truly at less 
risk of cardiovascular disease has remained controversial. Our study of 3.5 million electronic 
primary care records suggest individuals who are obese and classified as metabolically healthy 
(either no metabolic abnormalities, 1 or 2) are still at an increased risk for coronary heart disease, 
cerebrovascular disease and heart failure compared with individuals who are normal weight with 
no metabolic risk factors.  Individuals who are normal weight can also have metabolic 
abnormalities, and be at high risk for cardiovascular disease events. 
Translational Outlook: Large and long-term cohort trials are still required to determine the 
effect of weight loss on risk of developing cardiovascular disease events among metabolically 
healthy obese individuals.
