Does happiness itself directly aff
 ect mortality? The prospective 
UK Million Women Study

Summary
Background Poor health can cause unhappiness and poor health increases mortality. Previous reports of reduced 
mortality associated with happiness could be due to the increased mortality of people who are unhappy because of 
their poor health. Also, unhappiness might be associated with lifestyle factors that can aff
 ect mortality. We aimed to 
establish whether, after allowing for the poor health and lifestyle of people who are unhappy, any robust evidence 
remains that happiness or related subjective measures of wellbeing directly reduce mortality.
Methods The Million Women Study is a prospective study of UK women recruited between 1996 and 2001 and 
followed electronically for cause-specifi
 c mortality. 3 years after recruitment, the baseline questionnaire for the 
present report asked women to self-rate their health, happiness, stress, feelings of control, and whether they felt 
relaxed. The main analyses were of mortality before Jan 1, 2012, from all causes, from ischaemic heart disease, and 
from cancer in women who did not have heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive lung disease, or cancer at the time 
they answered this baseline questionnaire. We used Cox regression, adjusted for baseline self-rated health and 
lifestyle factors, to calculate mortality rate ratios (RRs) comparing mortality in women who reported being unhappy 
(ie, happy sometimes, rarely, or never) with those who reported being happy most of the time.
Findings Of 719 671 women in the main analyses (median age 59 years [IQR 55–63]), 39% (282 619) reported being 
happy most of the time, 44% (315 874) usually happy, and 17% (121 178) unhappy. During 10 years (SD 2) follow-up, 
4% (31 531) of participants died. Self-rated poor health at baseline was strongly associated with unhappiness. But after 
adjustment for self-rated health, treatment for hypertension, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, depression, or anxiety, and 
several sociodemographic and lifestyle factors (including smoking, deprivation, and body-mass index), unhappiness 
was not associated with mortality from all causes (adjusted RR for unhappy vs happy most of the time 0·98, 95% CI 
0·94–1·01), from ischaemic heart disease (0·97, 0·87–1·10), or from cancer (0·98, 0·93–1·02). Findings were 
similarly null for related measures such as stress or lack of control.
Interpretation In middle-aged women, poor health can cause unhappiness. After allowing for this association and 
adjusting for potential confounders, happiness and related measures of wellbeing do not appear to have any direct 
eff
 ect on mortality.

Introduction
Happiness and related measures of wellbeing are 
reportedly associated with reduced mortality, particularly 
from heart disease.1–4 Postulated mechanisms to account 
for this association include the possibility that happiness 
might itself cause biological changes, such as in serum 
cortisol concentration or immune function, that could 
in turn aff
 ect mortality.2,3 However, serious challenges 
exist in interpreting the association between happiness 
and reduced mortality as evidence for a protective 
biological mechanism for happiness. Unhappiness 
might, for example, be associated with lifestyle factors 
that can cause disease,3 such as smoking, high alcohol 
con 
sumption, obesity, or physical inactivity. Perhaps 
more important is reverse causality whereby poor 
health, which is known to be associated with an increase 
in mortality, can also cause unhappiness. This results in 
a non-causal association between unhappiness and 
increased 
mortality—or, 
equivalently, 
between 
happiness and reduced mortality. Our aim was to 
establish whether, after appropriate allowance for 
reverse causality and for confounding by lifestyle and 
sociodemographic factors, any robust evidence remains 
that happiness itself, or related subjective measures of 
wellbeing such as being in control, relaxed, or not 
unduly stressed, are independently associated with 
reduced mortality.
Methods
Study design and participants
From May 1, 1996, to Dec 31, 2001, the Million Women 
Study recruited 1·3 million women aged 50–69 years 
through the national Breast Screening Programmes of 
England and Scotland, and has continued to follow them 
up by electronic record linkage, recording the causes 
of any deaths.5 At recruitment, and every 3–5 years

subsequently, women were posted a questionnaire asking 
about sociodemographic factors, lifestyle, and health.
Ethics approval was from the Anglia and Oxford 
multicentre research ethics committee. Access to hospital 
admission data was approved by the Information Centre 
for Health and Social Care (England) and the Information 
Services Division (Scotland). All study participants 
provided written consent. 
Procedures
At baseline 3 years after recruitment, women were asked: 
“How often do you feel happy?” Possible responses were 
“most of the time”, “usually”, “sometimes”, or “rarely/
never”. They were also asked about related subjective 
measures of wellbeing including how often they felt in 
control, relaxed, and stressed. In addition, women were 
asked whether they had had various common health 
disorders and to self-rate their current health as “excellent”, 
“good”, “fair”, or “poor”. In the questionnaire, self-rated 
health came before happiness and related measures. We 
used data from this 3 year survey as baseline for our 
investigation of any associations of unhappiness (or 
related factors) with cause-specifi
 c mortality, and our 
analyses are restricted to the women who answered this 
question on happiness. A random sample of women were 
re-sent the same questionnaire about 1 year after the fi
 rst 
one to assess the repeatability of responses.6
All participants in the Million Women Study are 
routinely followed for death (or emigration), cancer 
registration, and hospital admission through electronic 
linkage to centrally held National Health Service (NHS) 
records, using a combination of name, date of birth, and 
NHS number. Underlying causes of death, cancers, and 
hospital admissions are coded according to WHO Tenth 
International Classifi
 cation of Diseases (ICD-10). 
Follow-up time was from the date when the baseline 
questionnaire on happiness was answered to whichever 
was fi
 rst of Jan 1, 2012, or date of death or emigration.
Outcomes and exposures
Our outcomes were mortality from all causes, from 
ischaemic heart disease (ICD-10 I20-I25), and from 
cancer (ICD-10 C00-C97). We classifi
 ed women into 
three categories: unhappy (ie, sometimes, rarely, or never 
happy), usually happy, or happy most of the time. Because 
the latter two categories are similar, for some analyses we 
combined them into one category, called generally happy. 
Associations of mortality with other subjective measures 
of wellbeing (being in control, relaxed, and stressed) were 
also examined.
Statistical analysis
For analyses examining which baseline factors were 
associated with happiness we used logistic regression 
(adjusted for various factors) to compare individuals who 
were unhappy with those who were generally happy 
(two-way classifi
 cation). For the analyses of the association

between unhappiness and mortality we used the 
three-way classifi
 cation (with those happy most of the 
time as the reference group), but for clarity in the text, we 
report only the mortality rate ratios (RR) for unhappy 
versus happy most of the time. For analyses of all-cause 
mortality, ischaemic heart disease mortality, and cancer 
mortality, we used Cox proportional hazards models. We 
did sensitivity analyses to exclude the fi
 rst 5 years of 
follow-up. We repeated such analyses for related 
measures of subjective wellbeing: being in control, being 
relaxed, and being stressed.
To limit reverse causality, the main mortality analyses 
excluded women who had already had certain illnesses 
(heart disease, stroke, lung disease, or cancer, as done 
previously7); additional analyses assessed the eff
 ects of 
these exclusions. 
RRs of death were fi
 rst adjusted only for age, and then 
additionally adjusted for various combinations of self-
rated health and sociodemographic and lifestyle 
characteristics. These characteristics were region of 
residence at recruitment (Scotland and the nine cancer 
registration regions covering England at that time); area 
deprivation (quintiles, based on the Townsend Index, a 
score incorporating census area data for employment, 
car ownership, home ownership, and household 
overcrowding8); educational achievement (college [after 
age 18 years], A-level qualifi
 cations [usually at age 
18 years], O-level qualifi
 cations [usually at age 16 years], 
none of these); whether living with a partner (yes, no), 
parity (0, 1, ≥2), body-mass index (<25 kg/m², 25 to 
<30 kg/m², ≥30 kg/m²); strenuous exercise (0, <3 h 
per week, ≥3 h per week); smoking (never, past, current 
<15 cigarettes per day, current ≥15 cigarettes per day); 
alcohol consumption (0, <7 drinks per week, ≥7 drinks 
per week); hours of sleep (<7 h, 7 h, 8 h, ≥9 h); and 
participation in religious groups (yes, no) or other group 
activities (yes, no). All adjustment variables were from 
the baseline survey (ie, at the same time that happiness 
and related measures were recorded), except region, 
deprivation, education, and parity, which were recorded 
at recruitment, about 3 years earlier.
We used conventional 95% CIs or 99% CIs, except in 
fi
 gures that compared more than two groups. For these 
comparisons, the variance of the log risk was estimated 
for each group (including the reference group).9 We used 
these group-specifi
 c variances to calculate group-specifi
 c 
CIs, allowing valid comparisons between any two or 
more groups, whether or not one of them was designated 
as the reference group. Analyses were done with Stata 
version 13.1.

Results
At baseline, a total of 845 440 women (median age 59 years;

most of the time, 44% (369 738) usually happy, 16% 
(138 678) sometimes happy, and 1% (7698) rarely or never 
happy. In all analyses we combined women who reported 
being happy sometimes, rarely, or never, and describe 
them as unhappy.
Among 10 143 women who completed the same 
happiness question twice, about 1 year apart, there 
was reasonably good reproducibility between the 
categorised responses (weighted κ for agreement 0·62). 
The two extreme categories had little crossover. Of 
4003 women who reported being happy most of the 
time at baseline, only 2% (85) reported being unhappy 
1 year later; conversely, of 1763 women who reported 
being unhappy at baseline, only 5% (81) reported being 
happy most of the time 1 year later.
The 
strongest 
sociodemographic 
and 
lifestyle 
correlates of being generally happy were increasing 
age, having fewer educational qualifi
 cations, doing 
strenuous exercise, not smoking, living with a partner, 
and participating in religious and other group activities 
(fi
 gure 1). The relation between happiness and the 
number of hours of sleep was J-shaped, with women 
reporting about 8 h sleep most likely to be generally 
happy. Each of the indices of ill health at baseline was 
associated with unhappiness (fi
 gure 2). Of all factors

 gure 2).
Women were followed for a mean of 9·6 years (SD 1·9) 
after completing the questionnaire about happiness. 
Including women with and without illness at baseline, 
48 314 deaths were recorded in this time. Compared with 
those reporting being happy most of the time, women who 
had reported being unhappy had excess all-cause mortality 
when adjusted only for age (RR 1·36, 95% CI 1·33–1·40). 
Simultaneous adjustment for the sociodemographic and 
lifestyle factors in fi
 gure 1 and the indices of health in 
fi
 gure 2 completely eliminated this excess (fully adjusted 
RR 0·95, 0·93–0·98; appendix p 4). However, these 
analyses include women who already had life-threatening 
diseases at baseline. Hence, our subsequent analyses 
exclude the 125 769 women who at baseline already had 
heart disease, stroke, cancer, or chronic obstructive airways 
disease. These excluded women had three times the death 
rate of the women without any such illnesses (age-adjusted 
RR 2·91, 95% CI 2·85–2·96), and are omitted from the 
main analyses below.

Of the remaining 719 671 women (median age 59 years, 
IQR 55–63), 4% (31 531) died during follow-up. In 
response to the question at baseline about how often 
they felt happy, 39% (282 619) reported being happy 
most of the time, 44% (315 874) usually happy, and 17% 
(121 178) unhappy. In crude analyses adjusted only for 
age, unhappiness remained associated with increased 
mortality (RR 1·29, 95% CI 1·25–1·33; table). This 
excess risk was partly accounted for by associations with 
various personal characteristics (appendix p 5). Self-
rated health was, however, the key characteristic. Poor 
health at baseline was strongly associated with 
unhappiness at baseline (fi
 gure 2) and once we adjusted 
for self-rated health, unhappiness was no longer 
signifi
 cantly 
associated 
with 
all-cause 
mortality 
(RR 1·02, 0·98–1·05; table). After simultaneous 
adjustment for all socio 
demographic and lifestyle 
factors in fi
 gure 1 (personal characteristics) and all 
indices of health in fi
 gure 2, the association vanished 
(fully adjusted RR 0·98, 0·94–1·01, for all-cause 
mortality [table]; 0·97, 0·87–1·10, for ischaemic heart 
disease mortality; and 0·98, 0·93–1·02, for cancer 
mortality [appendix pp 8–9]).
Further details of this multivariate adjustment are 
available (appendix p 5), showing that after adjusting for 
age, additional adjustment for each single personal 
characteristic in fi
 gure 1 changed the RR estimate only 
slightly (adjustment for smoking had the greatest eff
 ect). 
Simultaneous adjustment for all personal characteristics, 
however, halved the association between unhappiness 
and mortality (RR 1·14, 95% CI 1·11–1·18). Adjustment 
just for being treated for common health disorders 
(hypertension, diabetes, asthma, arthritis, depression, or 
anxiety), particularly depression or anxiety, also 
weakened the relationship (RR 1·21, 1·17–1·25; appendix 
p 5). The main fi
 ndings were essentially unchanged in 
sensitivity analysis that ignored the fi
 rst 5 years of 
follow-up (appendix p 6).
Because self-rated health was so strongly associated 
with both happiness and mortality, we examined the 
associations between happiness and mortality in 
women separately by self-rated health (table, fi
 gure 3, 
appendix pp 7–9, pp 13–15). All-cause mortality was 
substantially greater for the 20% (134 727 of 685 464) of 
women who reported that their health was fair or 
poor than for the remaining 80% (550 737) of women 
who reported good or excellent health (RR 1·67, 95% CI 
1·63–1·71). Within each category of self-rated health 
there was no signifi
 cant excess mortality in individuals 
who reported being unhappy (table, fi
 gure 3). For 
women who reported only fair or poor health, mortality 
was actually lower in those who reported being unhappy 
compared with those who were happy most of the time, 
but these fi
 ndings might be biased by some unhappy 
women tending to rate their general health worse than 
it was, thus producing a spuriously low mortality 
associated with being unhappy. Women reporting being 
in good or excellent health are less liable to such a 
potential bias, and we give results for these women 
only in fi
 gure 4 and fi
 gure 5, with results for women 
reporting fair or poor health in the appendix. 
Among 550 737 women reporting good or excellent 
health, 1253 died from ischaemic heart disease and 
12 943 from cancer; among these women, unhappiness was

not associated with mortality from either cause (fi
 gure 4). 
Nor was unhappiness associated with mortality from these 
causes for women who reported being in poor or fair health 
(appendix pp 8–9, pp 14–15).
Being treated for depression or anxiety was also 
strongly associated with self-reported unhappiness, so 
we did analyses separately for women who were and 
were not being treated for depression or anxiety at 
baseline (appendix pp 16–17). Again, unhappiness did 
not seem to be related to mortality in any of the 
subgroups of self-rated health.
We examined the associations of mortality with 
three other related subjective measures of wellbeing 
(being in control, relaxed, or not stressed). Correlates 
of each measure with sociodemographic, lifestyle, and 
health indices at baseline were similar to those found 
for happiness (appendix pp 18–19), even though the 
diff
 erent measures were themselves not strongly 
correlated (appendix p 10). Among women reporting 
good or excellent health, not being in control, not 
being relaxed, and being stressed were all not 
associated with increased mortality (fi
 gure 5; appendix 
pp 11–12).
Discussion
Poor health can cause unhappiness and poor health 
increases mortality, so unhappiness is associated with 
increased mortality. Additionally, unhappiness might 
correlate with some adverse lifestyle choices. After 
allowance for these associations our large prospective 
study shows no robust evidence that happiness itself 
reduces cardiac, cancer, or overall mortality. 
There is no perfect or generally agreed way to measure 
happiness or related subjective indices of wellbeing. 
Diff
 erent approaches thus limit comparability between 
studies. We used a single question about happiness with 
a four-point scale, whereas other investigators have used 
diff
 erent measures.10–14 Nevertheless, we are able to show 
the validity of our measure in three ways. First, personal 
factors found to be associated with happiness in this 
study (fi
 gure 1, fi
 gure 2) were similar to those reported by 
others who used either single-item or multi-item 
measures of happiness—ie, women were more likely to 
report feeling happy if they were older,15–17 less 
deprived,13,15,16,18 physically active,11,13,19–21 did not smoke,312,20–22 
had a partner,17,18,23 belonged to a religious group or 
participated in social activities,17,18 and had adequate 
sleep3,21 (but not too much). Women were also less likely 
to be happy if they had poor self-rated health or were 
being treated for various common health disorders, 
particularly depression or anxiety.16–18,21,24 Second, in 
analyses that were adjusted only for age and not corrected 
for other factors, our measure of unhappiness was 
correlated with increased mortality. Third, the response 
to our single question on happiness was reasonably 
repeatable on resurvey 1 year later (weighted κ=0·62), a 
level of repeatability comparable with that reported by 
other researchers using both single-item and multiple-
item measures.3,13,25 Also, there was minimal cross-over in 
responses 1 year apart between the two extremes of happy 
most of the time or unhappy.
Crude analyses, adjusting only for age, showed some 
excess mortality to be associated with unhappiness, but 
this excess was completely eliminated after additional 
adjustment for personal characteristics and for poor health 
at baseline (table). This was true for all-cause mortality 
and, separately, for mortality from ischaemic heart disease 
and from cancer. Far fewer women died from heart disease 
than from cancer and confounding was greater, so our null 
fi
 ndings are less defi
 nite for heart disease than for cancer.
By far the most important adjustment factor was 
self-rated health. A systematic review of previous studies 
has confi
 rmed that self-rated health predicts an increased

risk of death, in agreement with our fi
 ndings.26 Self-rated 
poor 
health 
was 
also 
strongly 
associated 
with 
unhappiness. Hence we examined the eff
 ects of 
happiness in categories of self-rated health, giving most 
weight to the fi
 ndings in the many women who reported 
that they were in good or excellent health. In these 
women, unhappiness was not associated with an 
increased mortality. In women who reported that they 
were in fair or poor health, being unhappy was associated 
with a slightly lower mortality than being happy most of 
the time, but this fi
 nding could well be biased by unhappy 
women tending to rate their health as slightly worse than 
it actually was.
Unhappiness might cause some people to do things 
known to aff
 ect mortality adversely—eg, smoke or be 
inactive.2,3 Hence, such variables might be mediators 
rather than confounders of the unhappiness–mortality 
association. Furthermore, some lifestyle factors such as 
inactivity and morbid obesity could cause unhappiness. 
However, adjustment for most of the behavioural factors, 
except smoking, resulted in little or no attenuation of the 
RR estimates for mortality, suggesting that even if these 
factors were mediating the association, their contribution 
is small. Adjustment for smoking caused a greater 
attenuation of the RR estimates than did adjustment for 
any other personal characteristics, so it is possible that 
part of the association between unhappiness and 
mortality, particularly for cancer mortality, might be 
mediated by smoking.
Some, but not all, other prospective studies have 
reported that happiness or related subjective measures 
of wellbeing are associated with lower all-cause 
mortality (panel).4,13,14,19,20,22,27–29 However, few of those 
reports excluded people with life-threatening illnesses 
at baseline and adjusted for self-rated health (or related 
measures of ill health) at baseline. Self-rated health 
was the most important confounding factor in our 
analyses; where other investigators adjusted for self-
rated health, any apparent excess mortality associated 
with unhappiness was attenuated or disappeared 
completely.27 If there is inadequate allowance for ill 
health at baseline, any associations between happiness 
and lower mortality are likely to be artefactual.
Participants in the Million Women Study were slightly 
less likely to be from deprived areas than were the 
general UK population.5 However, at recruitment the 
cohort included about one in four women in England 
and Scotland in the eligible age range, indicating that 
fi
 ndings should be generally applicable to middle-aged 
women in the UK. We provide no data about men or 
women of other ages.
It has been suggested that related subjective measures 
of wellbeing, including being in control, not being 
unduly stressed, or having positive or negative attitudes 
to life, could independently aff
 ect mortality.4,12,14,30 
However, just as for happiness, these associations were 
wholly accounted for by personal characteristics and ill 
health at baseline—after adjusting for these factors, any 
association with mortality was eliminated. We conclude 
that happiness and unhappiness have no material direct 
eff
 ect upon mortality.

Panel: Research in context
Systematic review
In November, 2014, we searched MEDLINE and PubMed for 
relevant reports with the terms “happiness”, “positive aff
 ect”, 
“well-being”, and “mortality” with no language or date 
restrictions. At least three comprehensive reviews had been 
done in the previous 6 years on the relation between 
happiness or related measures and mortality. We therefore did 
not do a new systematic review. The reviews and individual 
studies have reported inconsistent fi
 ndings. Some suggest 
that happiness or related subjective measures of wellbeing are 
independently associated with decreased mortality, and some 
suggest no eff
 ect after adjustment for potential confounding 
factors such as poor health.
Interpretation
Some previous reports have confused cause and eff
 ect. Our 
fi
 ndings show that unhappiness is associated with poor health 
mainly because poor health causes unhappiness and partly 
because unhappiness is associated with lifestyle factors such as 
smoking. After adjustment for these factors, no robust 
evidence remains that unhappiness or stress increase mortality 
or that being happy, relaxed, or in control reduces mortality.
