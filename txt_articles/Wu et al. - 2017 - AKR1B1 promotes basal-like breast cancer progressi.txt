IntroductIon
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with four major sub-
types according to gene expression profiling: luminal A, lumi-
nal B, HER2, and basal like (Vargo-Gogola and Rosen, 2007). 
Compared with the other subtypes, basal-like breast cancer 
(BLBC) is associated with an aggressive clinical history, early 
recurrence, distant metastasis, and shorter survival (Kreike et 
al., 2007; Rakha et al., 2008). BLBC usually occurs in younger 
and premenopausal women and has a tendency toward early 
metastatic spread to the brain and lungs, sites known to be 
associated with a poor prognosis (Blick et al., 2008; Sarrió et 
al., 2008; Storci et al., 2008; Bergamaschi et al., 2009; Hen-
nessy et al., 2009). A lack of effective targeted therapies for 
BLBC often results in a rapidly fatal clinical outcome. An im-
portant prerequisite for targeted therapies is to understand 
the molecular mechanisms underlying the metastatic process 
associated with BLBC. Notably, BLBC possesses the activated 
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, which is 
required for tumor progression and metastasis (Mani et al., 
2008; Gupta et al., 2009; Polyak and 
Weinberg, 2009; 
Valastyan 
and Weinberg, 2011; Dong et al., 2013b).
EMT is a phenotypic conversion that facilitates em-
bryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis 
(Polyak and Weinberg, 2009; Valastyan and Weinberg, 2011; 
Dong et al., 2012; 
Y
e and Weinberg, 2015). During EMT, epi-
thelial cells lose their epithelial properties and acquire a motile 
mesenchymal phenotype (Polyak and 
Weinberg, 2009;  
Y
e and 
Weinberg, 2015). Importantly, EMT causes the acquisition 
of cancer stem cell (CSC)–like properties (Mani et al., 2008; 
Gupta et al., 2009; Valastyan and Weinberg, 2011; Liu et al., 
2015). As tumor cells that have undergone EMT often faced 
a harsh environment of foreign tissue during the metastatic 
process, they must rewire metabolic and oncogenic pathways 
to meet the demands of survival and metastasis. Characteriza-
tion of the causal relationship between EMT and metabolic 
alteration will help to develop novel interventions for target-
ing metastatic breast cancer.
Metabolic reprograming has been accepted as a hallmark 
of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). Lipid metabolism, 
which represents an important source of bioactive molecules, 
is implicated in tumor progression (Tammali et al., 2011; Car-
racedo et al., 2013). Arachidonic acid (AA) is a polyunsatu-
rated fatty acid that is metabolized into prostaglandins (PGs), 
hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and epoxyeicosatrienoic 
acids through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions (Brash, 
2001). AA-related enzymes and their metabolites are involved 
Basal-like breast cancer (BLBc) is associated with high-grade, distant metastasis and poor prognosis. Elucidating the determi-
nants of aggressiveness in BLBc may facilitate the development of novel interventions for this challenging disease. In this 
study, we show that aldo-keto reductase 1 member B1 (AKr1B1) overexpression highly correlates with BLBc and predicts poor 
prognosis in breast cancer patients. Mechanistically, twist2 transcriptionally induces AKr1B1 expression, leading to nuclear 
factor κB (nF-κB) activation. In turn, nF-κB up-regulates twist2 expression, thereby fulfilling a positive feedback loop that 
activates the epithelial–mesenchymal transition program and enhances cancer stem cell (cSc)–like properties in BLBc. AKr1B1 
expression promotes, whereas AKr1B1 knockdown inhibits, tumorigenicity and metastasis. Importantly, epalrestat, an AKr1B1 
inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of diabetic complications, significantly suppresses cSc properties, tumor-
igenicity, and metastasis of BLBc cells. together, our study identifies AKr1B1 as a key modulator of tumor aggressiveness and 
suggests that pharmacologic inhibition of AKr1B1 has the potential to become a valuable therapeutic strategy for BLBc.
AKR1B1 promotes basal-like breast cancer progression by 
a positive feedback loop that activates the EMT program

 AKR1B1 regulates EMT in BLBC | Wu et al.
1066
in pathophysiological processes of many diseases, including a 
variety of cancers (Brash, 2001; Tammali et al., 2011). Aldo- 
keto reductase 1 member B1 (AKR1B1), which catalyzes the 
reduction of PGH2 to PGF2α, is a major nicotinamide ade-
nine dinucleotide phosphate reduced (NAD 
PH)–dependent 
 
PGF synthase during AA metabolism. PGF2α, a major 
 
metabolite of AKR1B1, modulates cell adhesion, migration, 
and invasion via PGF2α receptor–mediated signaling in en-
dometrial cancer (Sales et al., 2008), suggesting that AKR1B1 
may be involved in tumor progression by modulating lipid 
metabolism. While investigating T
wist2-mediated induction 
of EMT in BLBC, we unexpectedly identified that AKR1B1 
expression is elevated by 
T
wist2. AKR1B1 expression provides 
tumorigenic and metastatic advantage in BLBC through a 
positive regulatory feedback loop that activates the EMT 
program and enhances stem cell–like properties. Our study 
not only reveals a critical mechanism of how AKR1B1 con-
tributes to EMT and metastasis, but also provides a potential 
target for the treatment of BLBC.
rESuLtS
AKr1B1 is enriched in the BLBc subtype
We recently showed that loss of fructose-1,6-biphosphatase 
(FBP1) by Snail-mediated repression provided metabolic 
advantages in BLBC (Dong et al., 2013b). T
o systematically 
identify other metabolic genes required for BLBC, we an-
alyzed gene expression profiles of various subtypes of breast 
cancer in two publicly available cDNA microarray datasets 
(GEO accession no. GSE25066 and dataset NKI295), which 
contain 508 and 295 breast cancer patients, respectively (van 
de 
Vijver et al., 2002; Hatzis et al., 2011). Several known genes 
previously shown to have important roles in BLBC were ob-
served to have significant differences between BLBC and 
other subtypes, such as lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB) and 
FBP1. Notably, AKR1B1 expression was significantly higher 
in BLBC than in other subtypes, whereas expressions of other 
PGH2 reductases such as AKR1C3 and FAM213B did not 
have obvious changes in different subtypes (Fig. 1 A and Fig. 
S1 A). 
To confirm this finding, we collected fresh frozen breast 
tumor tissues from 9 cases of luminal and 21 cases of triple- 
negative breast cancer (triple-negative in the expression of 
ERα, PR, and HER2/neu; sometimes used as a surrogate 
term for basal like). Consistently, the expressions of AKR1B1 
and Twist2 were elevated in triple-negative breast cancer, and 
their expressions were significantly down-regulated in the lu-
minal subtype of breast cancers (Fig. 1 B and Fig. S1 B). T
o 
further extend these observations, we also analyzed AKR1B1 
expression in another four gene expression datasets (GEO 
accession nos. GSE12777, GSE10890, and GSE16732; and 
 
ArrayExpress accession no. E-TABM-157), which contain 51, 
52, 41, and 51 breast cancer cell lines, respectively (Neve et 
al., 2006; Hoeflich et al., 2009; Riaz et al., 2009). Similar to 
the observations in the GSE25066 and NKI295 datasets and 
in breast cancer tissues, AKR1B1 overexpression correlated 
with basal subtype of breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1 C). Then, 
we confirmed these findings by either semiquantitative RT
-
PCR or quantitative real-time PCR in a representative panel 
of breast cancer cell lines that contained five luminal and 
five BLBC cell lines. Consistently, AKR1B1 mRNA expres-
sion was remarkably elevated in five BLBC cell lines (Fig. 1, 
 
D and E). 
We further examined the protein levels of AKR1B1 
and EMT markers in these cell lines. BLBC cell lines lost the 
expression of epithelial molecule (E-cadherin) and contained 
high levels of mesenchymal markers (vimentin, N-cadherin, 
and 
T
wist2). Importantly, AKR1B1 protein level also was high 
in BLBC cell lines, whereas it was absent in luminal cell lines 
(Fig. 1 F). T
ogether, our data indicate that AKR1B1 overex-
pression is correlated with BLBC, underscoring the impor-
tance of characterizing potential function and mechanism of 
AKR1B1 for this subtype of breast cancer.
AKr1B1 is a direct target of twist2
When investigating the correlation between AKR1B1 and 
BLBC, AKR1B1 and T
wist2 displayed similar expression 
patterns in breast cancer cell lines and tissues (Fig. 1, B and 
F). When AKR1B1 expression was plotted against T
wist2 
expression in two microarray datasets (GSE10890 and 
GSE12777) that contain 52 and 51 breast cancer cell lines, 
respectively (Hoeflich et al., 2009), AKR1B1 expression 
positively correlated with T
wist2 expression in both datasets 
(Fig. 2 A). A similar result was obtained in a dataset from The 
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; 1,215-patient samples; Fig. 
S2 A). The positive correlation between AKR1B1 and T
wist2 
in breast cancer prompted us to investigate their mutually 
causal relationships. T
o this end, we established stable clones 
with empty vector or T
wist2 expression in T47D cells. As 
anticipated, T
wist2 expression substantially down-regulated 
E-cadherin expression and induced a morphological change 
indicative of EMT in T47D cells (Fig. 2 B). Intriguingly, 
T
wist2 but not T
wist1, Snail, or Slug expression remarkably 
promoted AKR1B1 expression in T47D cells (Fig. 2, B and 
C; and Fig. S2 B). Similar results were obtained in MCF7 cells 
with exogenous T
wist2 expression (Fig. 2 C). We also gener-
ated stable transfectants with empty vector or knockdown of 
T
wist2 expression in two BLBC cell lines (MDA-MB231 and 
SUM159). Strikingly, knockdown of T
wist2 expression re-
stored E-cadherin expression and down-regulated AKR1B1 
expression (Fig. 2 C). 
These data suggest that 
T
wist2 as a tran-
scriptional factor may induce AKR1B1 expression via tran-
scriptional regulation.
Given the immediate induction of AKR1B1 by T
wist2 
and their mutual correlation in breast cancer cell lines and 
tissues, we sought to determine whether AKR1B1 expression 
is regulated directly by T
wist2. A survey of a DNA sequence 
in the AKR1B1 locus revealed that the proximal AKR1B1 
promoter contains seven potential T
wist2-binding E-boxes 
(CAN 
NTG) from –1374 bp to the transcription start site 
(TSS; Fig. S2 C). T
o determine whether these E-boxes are 
crucial for T
wist2-mediated gene transcription, we cloned 
the human AKR1B1 promoter and generated several dele-

tion mutants of promoter–luciferase constructs based on the 
location of these E-boxes, including wtA (−1,374 bp), wtA1 
(−1,020 bp), and wtA2 (−583 bp; Fig. S2 C). By expressing 
the wtA in T47D, MCF7, MDA-MB231, and SUM159 cells, 
T
wist2 significantly promoted AKR1B1 promoter luciferase 
activity (Fig. 2 E). The wtA1 without the region between 
−1,374 and −1,021 bp still maintained high reporter activity 
induced by Twist2 (wtA vs. wtA1), whereas the wtA2 (−583 
bp) lost the activity to respond to T
wist2 expression (Fig. S2 
C). Thus, the region between −1,020 and −584 bp might be 
important for T
wist2-mediated AKR1B1 activation. T
o pin-
point the exact binding E-boxes, we introduced point mu-
tations into E1 and/or E2. Mutation in E1 (mutA1) did not 
significantly reduce, whereas mutation in either E2 (mutA2) 
or both E-boxes (mutA3) almost completely abolished, 
T
wist2-mediated activation of the AKR1B1 promoter lucif-
erase (Fig. 2 F), suggesting that T
wist2 activates the AKR1B1 
promoter in an E-box–dependent fashion and that the E-box 
at −997 bp is required for T
wist2-induced transcriptional ac-
tivation. We also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation 
(ChIP) assay after wtA1 as well as its E-box mutants (mutA1, 
mutA2, and mutA3) were coexpressed with empty vector or 
T
wist2 in HEK293 cells. As expected, mutation in either E2 
(mutA2) or both E-boxes (mutA3) dramatically attenuated 
the binding of T
wist2 to the AKR1B1 promoter, indicating 
the E-box at −997 bp is a critical T
wist2-binding site (Fig. S2 
D). Furthermore, we revealed that T
wist2 directly bound to 
the AKR1B1 promoter in MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells 
by ChIP assay (Fig. 2 G). These data indicate that AKR1B1 is 
a direct target of T
wist2.

AKr1B1 alters the expression of EMt markers and enhances 
breast cancer cell migration and invasion
To study the molecular function and mechanism of AKR1B1, 
we established stable transfectants with empty vector or 
knockdown of AKR1B1 expression in MDA-MB231 and 
SUM159 cells and clones with empty vector or AKR1B1 ex-
pression in T47D and MCF7 cells (Fig. 3, A and C). Because 
AKR1B1 is a direct transcriptional target of  
T
wist2 that plays 
critical roles in EMT and tumor metastasis, we first exam-
ined whether AKR1B1 was associated with EMT in these 
cells. Indeed, knockdown of AKR1B1 expression signifi-
cantly caused an increase in E-cadherin expression, whereas 
ectopic AKR1B1 expression reversed the up-regulation of 
E-cadherin in MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells with sta-
ble knockdown of AKR1B expression (Fig. 3 A and Fig. S3 
A). Epalrestat, a specific inhibitor of AKR1B1, also restored 
E-cadherin expression in MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells 
(Fig. 3 B). Conversely, in AKR1B1-expressing cells, E-cad-
herin expression was greatly down-regulated (Fig. 3 C). T
o 
further establish the functional relationship of AKR1B1 and 
EMT, we measured the E-cadherin promoter luciferase ac-
tivity. We observed that knockdown of AKR1B1 expression

or epalrestat reversed the suppression of the E-cadherin pro-
moter in MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells (Fig. 3, D and 
E; and Fig. S3 B), whereas AKR1B1 expression significantly 
decreased E-cadherin promoter luciferase activity in T47D 
and MCF7 cells (Fig. 3 F). Because suppression of E-cadherin 
can promote cell migration and invasion in the presence or 
absence of EMT (Onder et al., 2008) and because AKR1B1 
is associated with suppression of E-cadherin, we hypothesized 
that AKR1B1 is critical for breast cancer cell migration and 
invasion. As expected, knockdown of AKR1B1 expression or 
epalrestat dramatically repressed the migration and invasion 
of MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells in vitro (Fig. 3, G–J; and 
Fig. S3, C and D). T
ogether, these observations indicate an 
important role for AKR1B1 in induction of EMT and acqui-
sition of migratory and invasive ability in breast cancer cells.
AKr1B1 controls intracellular PGF2α levels  
and mediates the nF-κB pathway
T
o understand the metabolic consequence of AKR1B1 ex-
pression, we first measured the production of PGF2a, a major 
metabolite of AKR1B1 (Fig. 4 A). We noticed that knock-
down of AKR1B1 expression or epalrestat significantly re-
duced PGF2a production in MDA-MB231 and SUM159 
cells (Fig. 4 B and Fig. S4 A), whereas exogenous AKR1B1 
expression increased PGF2a production in T47D and MCF7 
cells (Fig. 4 C). These data indicate that AKR1B1 is required

for increased PGF2a production in breast cancer cells. We 
speculated that AKR1B1 might promote breast cancer cell 
migration and invasion via the PGF2α-mediated pathway. As 
anticipated, PGF2a markedly induced the migration and in-
vasion of MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells in vitro (Fig. 4, 
D and E). AKR1B1, a monomeric NAD 
PH-dependent cy-
tosolic enzyme, leads to a decrease in the ratio of NAD 
PH/
NADP+ (Fig. 4 A). A decrease in the NAD 
PH/NADP+ ratio 
could cause oxidative stress (Kinoshita et al., 1981; Srivastava 
et al., 2005; Gloire et al., 2006). This is consistent with our 
findings that knockdown of AKR1B1 expression caused a 
significant decrease of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in 
MDA-MB231 cells, whereas ectopic AKR1B1 expression in-
duced an obvious increase of ROS in T47D cells (Fig. S4 B). 
Because NF-κB is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that 
has been proposed to be the sensor for ROS (Li and Karin, 
1999; D’Angio and Finkelstein, 2000; Gloire et al., 2006), 
AKR1B1-mediated increase of ROS may involve NF-κB 
signaling. Additionally, growing evidence also suggests that 
AKR1B1 can activate NF-κB signaling via the PGF2a-medi-
ated pathway (Ramana et al., 2004; Tammali et al., 2006). In-
deed, knockdown of AKR1B1 expression caused a dramatic 
decrease of RelA level, whereas AKR1B1 expression led to 
a marked increase of RelA expression in both the nucleus 
and cytoplasm (Fig. 4 F and Fig. S4 C). T
o further confirm 
the functional relationship between AKR1B1 and NF-κB, we 
measured NF-κB reporter luciferase. Strikingly, knockdown 
of AKR1B1 expression decreased the activity of NF-κB 
reporter in MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells (Fig. 4 G), 
whereas AKR1B1 expression enhanced NF-κB promoter lu-
ciferase activity in T47D and MCF7 cells (Fig. 4 H).
relA transcriptionally induces twist2 expression
The NF-κB pathway has been implicated in the regulation of 
EMT (Huber et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2004). T
o investigate 
the role of AKR1B1-mediated NF-κB signaling in EMT in-
duction, we determined the expressions of RelA and various 
transcriptional factors of EMT by Western blotting. We ob-
served that knockdown of AKR1B1 expression significantly 
decreased RelA and T
wist2 expression but not T
wist1, Snail, 
and Slug expression in MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells, 
whereas AKR1B1 expression significantly increase RelA and 
Twist2 expression in T47D and MCF7 cells (Fig. 5 A). It is 
well known that 
TNF and IL-1β contribute to NF-κB activa-
tion. Indeed, RelA expression was induced by TNF or IL-1β 
in MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells. Importantly, T
wist2 
expression also was dramatically up-regulated upon TNF or 
IL-1β stimulation in these cells (Fig. 5 B). These data suggest 
that T
wist2 expression is positively correlated with RelA ex-
pression. 
T
o further investigate the relationship between RelA 
and 
T
wist2, we established stable transfectants with empty vec-
tor or knockdown of RelA expression as well as stable clones 
with empty vector or RelA expression in MDA-MB231 and 
SUM159 cells. Strikingly, knockdown of RelA expression 
caused a decrease, whereas RelA expression resulted in an 
increase, in T
wist2 expression (Fig. 5 C), indicating a critical 
role of RelA in regulating T
wist2 expression.
T
o demonstrate whether T
wist2 expression is regulated 
directly by RelA, four putative NF-κB–binding motifs were 
noticed in the proximal 
T
wist2 promoter sequence from −222 
bp to TSS (Fig. 5 D). We generated an AKR1B1 promoter–
luciferase construct (wtT = TSS to −369 bp). By expressing 
the wtT in T47D, MDA-MB231, and HEK293 cells, a two- 
to fourfold increase in Twist2 promoter activity was observed 
in cells undergoing RelA overexpression (Fig. S4 D). T
o fur-
ther define the elements inside the human T
wist2 promoter 
that are involved in this activation, several point mutants were 
generated in the NF-κB–binding motifs (mutT1, mutT2, and 
mutT3; Fig. 5 D). Either the mutT1 or the mutT2, especially 
the latter, became less sensitive to, whereas the mutT3 with 
mutation of each NF-κB–binding motif almost completely 
lost, RelA-mediated activation of T
wist2 promoter lucifer-
ase (Fig. 5 E), suggesting that all four of these consecutive 
NF-κB–binding motifs are important for RelA-mediated 
T
wist2 activation. T
o further examine whether RelA directly 
binds to the T
wist2 promoter, a ChIP assay was performed 
using MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells. We detected a dra-
matic enrichment of RelA in the T
wist2 promoter (Fig. 5 F). 
These data indicate that RelA up-regulates T
wist2 expression 
by directly binding to the T
wist2 promoter.
AKr1B1 contributes to the maintenance of cScs and is 
required for tumorigenicity and metastasis of breast cancer
Many solid tumors contain a small population of highly tum-
origenic CSCs, which contribute significantly to tumor ini-
tiation and metastasis. Emerging evidence has shown that the 
EMT program generates cells with stem cell–like properties 
(Polyak and Weinberg, 2009; Thiery et al., 2009; Nauseef and 
Henry, 2011). As AKR1B1 is highly expressed and involved 
in the EMT process in BLBC, we speculated that AKR1B1 
expression might confer stem cell–like properties to BLBC 
cells. 
T
o test this notion, we examined tumorsphere formation 
of these cells. Strikingly, knockdown of AKR1B1 expression 
or epalrestat greatly suppressed tumorsphere formation in 
MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells, whereas AKR1B1 expres-
sion in T47D cells enhanced tumorsphere formation (Fig. 6, 
A–C). As breast CSCs are enriched in cells with a CD44high/
CD24low phenotype (Fillmore and Kuperwasser, 2007; 
Blick et al., 2010), we then examined the potential effect of 
AKR1B1 on cell population with CD44high/CD24low markers 
using flow cytometry analysis. Similar to the observation in 
 
tumorsphere formation, knockdown of AKR1B1 expression 
or epalrestat significantly reduced the percentage of CD44high/
CD24low population in MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells, 
whereas AKR1B1 expression induced a remarkable increase 
of CD44high/CD24low population in 
T47D cells (Fig. 6, D–H).
CSCs are highly tumorigenic and metastatic (Rosen 
and Jordan, 2009; Liu and Wicha, 2010; Badve and Nakshatri, 
2012). First, we investigated AKR1B1’s role in cell growth. 
Knockdown of AKR1B1 expression or epalrestat did not

cause an apparent effect on the growth of MDA-MB231 
and SUM159 cells (Fig. S5, A and B). Then, we examined 
the effect of AKR1B1 expression on the in vitro tumorige-
nicity using soft agar assay. Knockdown of AKR1B1 expres-
sion or epalrestat caused a dramatic decrease of colonies in 
MDA-MB231 and SUM159 cells, whereas AKR1B1 expres-
sion led to a marked increase of colony formation in T47D 
cells (Fig. 7, A–C; and Fig. S3 E). We also tested the in vivo 
tumorigenicity in tumor xenograft experiments. Compared 
with control cells, MDA-MB231 cells with knockdown of 
AKR1B1 expression resulted in significantly reduced tumor 
growth (Fig. 7 D), whereas T47D cells with AKR1B1 ex-
pression caused dramatically enhanced tumor growth in 
vivo (Fig. 7 F). In addition, we examined the expression of 
AKR1B1, RelA, T
wist2, and E-cadherin by Western blotting 
in tumor samples from a mouse model. Consistent with the 
analysis of cell lines, knockdown of AKR1B1 expression sig-
nificantly caused an increase in E-cadherin expression and a 
decrease in RelA and T
wist2 expression (Fig. S5 C), indicat-
ing that AKR1B1 regulates the EMT program by the same 
mechanism in vitro and in vivo. In line with these findings, 
mice given epalrestat exhibited substantially decreased tumor 
growth compared with control mice (Fig. S5 D). Then, we 
evaluated the effect of epalrestat treatment after tumor for-
mation. Epalrestat was administered intragastrically 10 d after 
injection of MDA-MB-231 cells. Consistently, mice given

epalrestat also exhibited significantly decreased tumor growth 
compared with control mice (Fig. 7 E). Next, we investi-
gated whether inhibition of AKR1B1 expression affected 
tumor metastasis in a xenograft metastasis model in which 
MDA-MB231 cells were used to generate pulmonary metas-
tases. Strikingly, knockdown of AKR1B1 expression or epal-
restat greatly suppressed lung metastasis in vivo (Fig. 8, A and 
B). Collectively, these data suggest that AKR1B1 is critical for 
tumorigenicity and metastasis of BLBC cells, and pharmaco-
logic inhibition of AKR1B1 can prevent tumorigenicity and 
metastasis of BLBC cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Having identified the critical function of AKR1B1 in 
breast cancer, we then sought to elucidate its clinical relevance 
by examining its correlation with patient survival in the NKI295 
and GSE25066 datasets (van de Vijver et al., 2002; Hatzis et 
al., 2011). Patients were divided into two groups according to 
AKR1B1 expression, with high AKR1B1 expression having 
shorter survival in these patient cohorts (Fig. 8 C). Next, we 
evaluated whether AKR1B1 expression was associated with 
the metastatic sites in a dataset (GEO accession no. GSE12276) 
that contains 204 breast cancer patients (Bos et al., 2009). Con-
sistent with the metastatic tendency of BLBC, primary tumors 
with high AKR1B1 expression preferentially metastasized 
to the brain and lungs (Fig. S5 E). These clinical validations 
strongly support the critical role of AKR1B1 in BLBC.
dIScuSSIon
AKR1B1 facilitates the tumorigenic and metastatic capacity 
of BLBC cells through a positive regulatory feedback loop 
that activates the EMT program. Our study provides several 
mechanistic and therapeutic insights into the critical roles of 
AKR1B1 in EMT and BLBC.

AKr1B1 regulates the EMt program through 
a positive feedback loop
The EMT program is a key event promoting carcinoma 
cell dissociation, invasion, and metastasis (Polyak and 
Weinberg, 2009; Ye and Weinberg, 2015). Loss of E-cad-
herin, which represents a hallmark of  
EMT, is often cor-
related with high tumor stage and metastasis (Thiery, 2009; 
Dong et al., 2013a). Several transcription factors, such as 
Snail, Twist1/2, and Zeb1/2, have been implicated in the 
transcriptional repression of E-cadherin and the induction 
of EMT (Yang et al., 2004; Kalluri and Weinberg, 2009; 
Thiery et al., 2009). Twist1 and Twist2 belong to highly 
conserved basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors that 
play pivotal roles in EMT and cancer metastasis (Šošić et 
al., 2003; Ansieau et al., 2010; Fang et al., 2011). Given the 
similarities of these two genes in sequence and function, 
a major unsolved question is whether Twist2 possesses the 
unique molecular targets and cellular functions. The find-
ings that a frameshift mutation in the Twist2 gene causes 
Setleis syndrome and mutations in the Twist1 gene leads 
to Saethre-Chotzen syndrome exhibit different functions 
of two genes in bone and skin development (Chen and 
Behringer, 1995). In addition, the transcriptional expres-
sion pattern of Twist2 differs from that of Twist1 in various 
tumors (Ansieau et al., 2010). These observations suggest 
that both Twist2 and Twist1 have overlapping but distinct 
functions. Here, our finding revealed that Twist2 functions 
as a transcriptional activator to directly induce the tran-
scription of AKR1B1 in contrast to Twist1, indicating that 
Twist2 has unique functions. Gene deletion experiments 
have shown that 
Twist2-knockout mice display disturbance 
of proinflammatory cytokines causing perinatal death 
(Šošić et al., 2003). However, the mechanism underlying 
the links between Twist2 and inflammation remains rela-
tively unknown. Our data suggest that Twist2 may regulate 
inflammatory changes by direct transcriptional activation 
of AKR1B1 that has been implicated in the development 
of various inflammatory diseases and cancers.

 AKR1B1 regulates EMT in BLBC | Wu et al.
1074
It has been documented that AKR1B1 modulates 
NF-κB signaling via the PGF2a-mediated pathway (Ramana 
et al., 2004; 
Tammali et al., 2006). Consistent with this notion, 
AKR1B1 expression elevated PGF2a synthesis and RelA ex-
pression, indicating that AKR1B1 is critical part of a cellu-
lar program promoting PGF2a pathway flux, thus triggering 
NF-κB activation in BLBC. Activation of NF-κB is tightly 
associated with EMT induction (Huber et al., 2004; Zhou 
et al., 2004). Interestingly, we observed that only T
wist2 ex-
pression was significantly up-regulated in cells with AKR1B1 
overexpression, suggesting the involvement of AKR1B1 in 
Twist2 expression and EMT induction via the NF-κB signal-
ing pathway. Indeed, our data identified that RelA is a tran-
scriptional activator responsible for T
wist2 expression, thus 
controlling the EMT program in BLBC.
T
ogether, we demonstrate that AKR1B1 regulates the 
EMT program through a T
wist2-mediated positive feedback 
regulatory loop. In BLBC cells, AKR1B1 expression is tran-
scriptionally up-regulated by T
wist2, leading to NF-κB ac-
tivation via the PGF2a-mediated pathway. NF-κB, in turn, 
elevates T
wist2 expression, which induces EMT, thus bridg-
ing AKR1B1 and the EMT program and fulfilling a positive 
feedback loop in BLBC (Fig. 8 D).
AKr1B1 enhances cSc properties and is required for 
tumorigenicity and metastasis in BLBc
BLBC is defined by expression of markers characteristic 
of basal/myoepithelial cells and identified as a subtype of 
breast cancer that may originate from undifferentiated stem 
cells (termed basal-like cells in the normal breast mammary 
gland; Polyak, 2011). Consistently, BLBC possesses more CSC 
and EMT characteristics than the other subtypes of breast 
cancer (Blick et al., 2008, 2010; Honeth et al., 2008; Sar-
rió et al., 2008; Storci et al., 2008; Bergamaschi et al., 2009; 
 
Hennessy et al., 2009). Elegant studies have showed that EMT 
is a cellular dedifferentiation program that confers tumor cells

weight were measured and recorded. Bars, 1 cm. Data are presented as mean ± SEM from six mice. *, P < 0.001.

with CSC properties (Polyak and Weinberg, 2009; Thiery et 
al., 2009; Nauseef and Henry, 2011). In line with this notion, 
AKR1B1 expression leads to increased CSC properties by 
a positive feedback loop that activates the EMT program in 
BLBC, indicating that AKR1B1 is critical in controlling the 
viability of CSCs. Extensive studies have demonstrated that 
CSCs are essential for tumor initiation, recurrence, and me-
tastasis (Rosen and Jordan, 2009; Liu and Wicha, 2010; Badve 
and Nakshatri, 2012). Indeed, our experiments showed that 
AKR1B1 expression in luminal cells increased tumorigenic-
ity, whereas knockdown of AKR1B1 expression in BLBC 
cells suppressed tumorigenicity and metastasis in vitro and 
in vivo. Clinically, high AKR1B1 expression occurs specifi-
cally in BLBC and predicts poor relapse-free survival. Fur-
thermore, AKR1B1 overexpression is also highly correlated 
with metastatic dissemination to the brain and lungs, which is 
completely in concordance with the metastatic propensity of 
BLBC. Clearly, our study suggests that AKR1B1 overexpres-
sion represents an oncogenic event that is responsible for the 
aggressive behaviors of BLBC cells.
AKr1B1 represents a potential therapeutic 
target for treating BLBc
The treatment of BLBC is an unmet medical need because 
of the absence of effective targeted therapies and poor re-
sponse to standard chemotherapy. Therefore, identification 
of the relevant molecular targets in BLBC may facilitate 
the development of effective tailored therapies to improve

patient outcomes. Our study identified the crucial roles of 
AKR1B1 in EMT and BLBC and showed a tight correlation 
between AKR1B1 and T
wist2 in breast cancer cells. T
wist2, 
as a transcription factor, is difficult to target therapeutically 
because of the absence of a clear ligand-binding domain. As a 
downstream target of 
T
wist2, AKR1B1 might be a potentially 
valuable target for therapeutics against this metastatic disease. 
Epalrestat is the only AKR1B1 inhibitor that has been ap-
proved in Japan for the targeted treatment of diabetic compli-
cations, which is easily absorbed by tissues and has minimum 
adverse effects (Hotta et al., 2006). Intriguingly, epalrestat 
significantly attenuated the viability of CSCs within breast 
cancer cell populations. This finding may be especially im-
portant because traditional therapies often leave behind the 
minority CSCs that regenerate tumors (Gupta et al., 2009). 
Thus, it is conceivable that epalrestat can suppress tumor pro-
gression. Indeed, epalrestat dramatically inhibited cancer cell 
migration and invasion in vitro and suppressed tumorigenic-
ity and metastasis of BLBC cells in mice models, displaying 
potent efficacy against BLBC.
As the safety profiles of marketed drugs are generally 
known, drug repositioning has been regarded as an effi-
cient approach to drug discovery and a way to identify new 
treatment for other diseases (Mizushima, 2011). Epalrestat is 
generally safe in clinical trials at oral dosages of 50–200 mg 
three times a day for the targeted treatment of diabetic com-
plications, and the plasma epalrestat concentration of 12 µM 
is reached 1 h after a single oral dose of 50 mg (Uchida et 
al., 1995; Ito et al., 2009). Significantly, a clinically achiev-
able dose of epalrestat exhibits apparent inhibitory effect on 
BLBC progression using cellular and mice models. Because 
epalrestat is already on the market without any major toxicity, 
our study provides proof of principle to suggest that epal-
restat has the potential to become a valuable targeted drug in 
clinical treatment of BLBC.

plates in the desired medium and cultured at 37°C for 14–21 
d, and the colonies were stained and counted.
Migration and invasion assays
Migration and invasion assays were performed in Boyden 
chambers as described previously (Dong et al., 2013a). The 
cancer cells were stained and counted with a microscope. All 
experiments were performed at least twice in triplicate. Sta-
tistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test; a p-value

For the detection of the CD44high/CD24low population, 
cells were incubated in a volume of 100 µl with 2 µl of 
each monoclonal antibody: CD44-PE/Cy7 and CD24-PE 
(eBioscience). Cells were treated on ice for 30 min and 
washed twice before analysis in the cytometer (Cytomic FC 
500MCL; Beckman Coulter).
tumorigenesis assay and lung metastasis model
Animal experiments were performed according to proce-
dures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee at Zhejiang University. T
o examine the effect of 
AKR1B1 on tumorigenesis, female SCID mice (6–8 wk old) 
were injected with 106 exogenous AKR1B1-expressing or 
knockdown cells on the left flank and vector control cells 
on the right flank. T
o evaluate the drug efficacy, 50 mg/kg/d 
epalrestat was administered intragastrically after injection of 
MDA-MB-231 cells on the left flank of every mouse, and 
sterile water was used as the vehicle control. Tumor forma-
tion was examined every 2–4 d for a 4-wk period. Tumors’ 
size and weight were measured. T
o test the effect of AKR1B1 
on tumor metastasis, female SCID mice were injected with 
MDA-MB-231 cells (106 cells/mouse) with stable empty 
vector or knockdown of AKR1B1 expression via tail vein 
(six mice per group). For evaluation of epalrestat, mice were 
injected with MDA-MB-231 cells (106 cells/mouse) via tail 
vein (six mice per group) and then received 50 mg/kg/d ep-
alrestat or sterile water intragastrically. After 4 wk, lung me-
tastasis was detected using an imagining system (IVIS-100; 
Xenogen). Mice were also sacrificed; lung metastatic nodules 
were detected in paraffin-embedded sections stained with he-
matoxylin and eosin. Data were analyzed using Student’s t 
test; a p-value <0.05 was considered significant.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean + SD or SEM, as indicated. 
Comparisons were made using two-tailed Student’s t test 
or one-way ANO 
VA. Correlations between AKR1B1 and 
T
wist2 were analyzed using Pearson’s correlation method and 
Spearman’s rank correlation test. Survival curves were ana-
lyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were 
performed with the log-rank test. In all statistical tests, P < 
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
