18, 2015; doi:10.1152/ajplung.00398.2015.—Influenza causes an
acute infection characterized by virus replication in respiratory epi-
thelial cells. The severity of influenza and other respiratory diseases
changes over the life course and during pregnancy in women, sug-
gesting that sex steroid hormones, such as estrogens, may be involved.
Using primary, differentiated human nasal epithelial cell (hNEC)
cultures from adult male and female donors, we exposed cultures to
the endogenous 17�-estradiol (E2) or select estrogen receptor modu-
lators (SERMs) and then infected cultures with a seasonal influenza A
virus (IAV) to determine whether estrogenic signaling could affect the
outcome of IAV infection and whether these effects were sex depen-
dent. Estradiol, raloxifene, and bisphenol A decreased IAV titers in
hNECs from female, but not male, donors. The estrogenic decrease in
viral titer was dependent on the genomic estrogen receptor-2 (ESR2)
as neither genomic ESR1 nor nongenomic GPR30 was expressed in
hNEC cultures and addition of the genomic ER antagonist ICI
182,780 reversed the antiviral effects of E2. Treatment of hNECs with
E2 had no effect on interferon or chemokine secretion but significantly
downregulated cell metabolic processes, including genes that encode
for zinc finger proteins, many of which contain estrogen response
elements in their promoters. These data provide novel insights into the
cellular and molecular mechanisms of how natural and synthetic
estrogens impact IAV infection in respiratory epithelial cells derived
from humans.

BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES EXIST between males and females, yet
these differences are often overlooked in experimental studies
in immunology and infectious diseases (2). The recent policy
announcement by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that
applicants consider balancing the sexes in preclinical, cell
culture, and animal studies speaks to the importance of sex as
a biological variable that can help predict the outcome of
diseases (4, 19). Clinical observations reveal that respiratory
diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
order, and influenza are often more severe in women than men,
being highly dependent on both age and hormonal status (3,
18). Influenza, in particular, is a major recurring cause of
morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting 10% of the
population annually through epidemics, pandemics, and sea-
sonal outbreaks. When age and sex are included in analyses of
influenza pathogenesis, young adult women experience more
severe outcomes compared with age-matched men (42). Young
adult women were reportedly two to six times more likely to
die from H5N1 or H7N9 avian influenza infection and during
the initial wave of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (14, 51,
64). Influenza is considered an immune-mediated disease, in
which the disease severity is largely determined by the strength
of the host inflammatory response to infection (56). Murine
models have been instrumental in characterizing sex differ-
ences in the outcome of influenza A virus (IAV) infection (26,
46, 47). These studies collectively illustrate that young adult
female mice suffer a worse outcome from infection with IAV
than their male counterparts. Sex differences in the outcome of
IAV in mice are not caused by differences in virus replication
in the lower respiratory tract (i.e., lungs) but rather are asso-
ciated with an exacerbated proinflammatory cytokine and
chemokine response in the lungs (26, 47). Regulating the
balance between immune responses causing protection or pa-
thology is integral for repair of pulmonary tissue and recovery
from infection.
Murine models further reveal that sex differences in the
outcome of respiratory diseases, including IAV, are mitigated
in the absence of sex steroid hormones (46, 47), suggesting that
the hormonal milieu plays a fundamental role in determining
sex-specific differences in the outcome of infection. Endoge-
nous sex steroid hormones, such as 17�-estradiol (E2), are
immunomodulatory and regulate cellular immune responses to
infection (54, 62). In mouse models of asthma, allergy, and
IAV, females suffer a worse outcome from pulmonary diseases
compared with males (30, 47). Among female rodents, endog-
enous changes in circulating E2 concentrations alter lung func-
tion and exogenous E2 treatment reduces pulmonary inflam-
mation and disease symptoms (22, 30, 45, 65). Continuous E2
exposure, but not cyclical or ablated E2, in adult female mice
prolongs survival following IAV infection (47). In women,
sustained concentrations of E2 are associated with improved
outcome of respiratory diseases, such as asthma. For example,
administration of oral contraceptives containing E2 reduces

erbations associated with premenstrual asthma (22, 59).
Estrogens, primarily E2, regulate cellular function in diverse
cell types, via binding to intracellular, genomic estrogen re-
ceptors (ERs), such ER� (ESR1) and ER� (ESR2), or to
membrane-associated, nongenomic ERs, such as the G protein-
coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). These receptors are cell
type specific and can activate gene expression directly by
serving as ligand-dependent transcriptional factors (ESR1 and
ESR2) or indirectly by altering signaling pathways, including
ERK/MAPK, NF-�B, and STAT activity (10, 54). Both im-
mune cells and nonimmune cells (e.g., respiratory epithelial
cells) have intracellular ERs that regulate cellular functions,
including inflammatory responses (10). Targeting ER activity
might be therapeutic for diseases that are caused by excessive
inflammation and that disproportionately affect females. Selec-
tive estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) bind to ERs to
cause conformational changes that alter engagement with co-
activator and corepressor proteins to initiate either induction or
suppression of target gene transcription (21, 38). A recent
screen revealed antiviral properties of two SERMs against
Ebola virus infection: clomiphene, which is used to treat
infertility, and raloxifene, approved for treatment of osteopo-
rosis and to decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmeno-
pausal women (17). Environmental estrogens, including xe-
noestrogens, such as bisphenol A (BPA), also can interact with
ERs to alter transcriptional activity (57), but the effects on
cellular responses to viruses have not been evaluated. In this
study, we used primary differentiated human nasal epithelial
cell (hNEC) cultures isolated from healthy tissue of male and
female donors (8, 20, 44) to study the effects of estrogenic
compounds on the human cellular response to IAV infection.
Nasal epithelial cells are the primary cell type infected with
IAV, and these cultures allowed us to investigate IAV infection
and pathogenesis based on the sex and hormonal milieu of the
donor cultures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Madin-Darby canine kidney
(MDCK) cells were propagated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s low-
phenol, high-glucose medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies), 100 U/ml penicillin
(Life Technologies), 100 �g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies),
and 2 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies). The cells were main-
tained at 37°C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2.
Virus. The recombinant influenza A/Udorn/307/72 H3N2 virus
(IAV) used in this study was described previously (41). The hemag-
glutinin (HA) protein contains amino acid changes (L226Q/S228G in
the H3 numbering system) that allows for preferential binding to
�2,3-linked sialic acid. Viral working stocks of were generated by
infecting MDCK cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of �0.01
infectious units per cell in low-phenol, high-glucose DMEM contain-
ing 0.25% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Life Technologies), acety-
lated trypsin from bovine pancreas (5 �g/ml; N-acetyl trypsin;
Sigma), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 �g/ml streptomycin, 6 mM L-glu-
tamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies), which we
refer to as infection media. The infected cells were incubated at 37°C
for 72 h, and infected cell supernatant was harvested, clarified by
centrifugation, aliquoted, and stored at �80°C. Infectious virus titers
were determined by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) as
described previously (33).
Chemicals. Stock solutions of 17�-estradiol (E2; 1 mM; Sigma)
were made in ethanol, while raloxifene (100 mM; Sigma), ospemifene
(100 mM; Sigma), clomiphene citrate (100 mM; Sigma), ICI 182,780
(ICI; 2 mM; Tocris-Cookson), and BPA (44 mM; Sigma; provided by
Dr. Jodi A. Flaws, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) were
made in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma). All stock solutions were
stored at �20°C.
hNEC cultures. Primary hNECs were collected from nondiseased
nasal mucosa of patients undergoing endoscopic sinonasal surgery for
nonsinusitis indications, including dacryocystorhinostomy, approach
to anterior skull base pathology, or removal of benign nasal masses.
The cells were collected from male (n � 10) and female (n � 42)
donors (age range 18–45 yr). The research protocol was approved
through the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board, and all sub-
jects gave signed informed consent. The cells were differentiated at an
air-liquid interface in 24-well Falcon filter inserts (0.4-�M pore; 0.33
cm2; Becton Dickinson) coated with human type IV placental colla-
gen (Sigma-Aldrich) as described previously (8, 20, 44).
Infection and treatment of hNEC cultures. Before infection, the
apical surface of hNEC cultures was washed with Dulbecco’s PBS
with calcium and magnesium (DPBS; Life Technologies). The cul-
tures were infected via the apical chamber with a MOI of 0.1
TCID50/cell or mock infected at 32°C in 200 �l of infection media.
After 2 h, the inoculums were aspirated, the apical surfaces washed
twice with DPBS, and cells were incubated at 32°C. At the indicated
hours postinfection (hpi), 200 �l of infection media were added to the
apical surface, incubated at 32°C for five min, and then collected. All
samples were stored at �80°C. At the indicated times pre- or postin-
fection, the basolateral media were replaced by media containing
doses of vehicle control (EtOH or DMSO as appropriate), E2 (0.1, 1.0,
or 10 nM), BPA (44 �M), raloxifene (50 �M), ospemifene (50 �M),
clomiphene citrate (50 �M), or ICI (100 nM). Basolateral media were
collected and replaced with media containing fresh vehicle or com-
pound at 48 and 96 hpi.
TCID50 assay. MDCK cells were plated in a 96-well plate and
cultured for 72 h in growth DMEM until 90–100% confluent. The
cells were washed twice with DPBS and then covered with 180 �l of
infection media. Serial dilutions (10�1 to 10�8) of hNEC apical
samples at each time point were made in separate, 96-well plates by
adding 20 �l of each apical sample to 180 �l of infection DMEM and
then serially diluted 10-fold. Twenty microliters of each dilution were
then added to the MDCK plates in replicates of six, resulting in final
dilutions of each sample ranging from 10�2 to 10�9. The infection
proceeded for 7 days at 32°C, and then the cells were fixed with 4%
formaldehyde and stained with napthol blue-black solution. The
cytopathic effect was scored visually and the Reed and Muench
calculation was used to determine the titer of infectious virus at each
time point.
Multiplex chemokine assay analysis. The Meso Scale Discovery
(MSD) multiplex assay system was used to measure chemokines
collected from apical samples of hNECs after infection. In each well,
the Chemokine Panel 1 kit quantitatively determined the concentra-
tion of eight C-C ligand motif (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL11, CCL13,
CCL17, CCL22, and CCL26) and two C-X-C ligand motif (CXCL8
and CXCL10) chemokines, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
All samples were run in duplicate. MSD plates were read on the MSD
SECTOR Imager 2400 at the Becton Dickinson Core Facility at the
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and analyzed on
the accompanying software (MSD Discovery Workbench version 4).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The PBL Assay Science DIY
Human IFN Lambda 1/2/3 (IL-29/28A/28B) enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure levels of interferon-�
(IFN�) collected from apical samples of hNECs after infection. All
samples were run in duplicate and read on the FilterMax F3 Multi-
Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). The data were ana-
lyzed with the accompanying software (SoftMax Pro Data Acquisition
and Analysis Software).
Real-time RT-PCR. At the indicated times postinfection, hNEC
cultures were treated with TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies) and

 total RNA was extracted using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Ambion
by Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Reverse transcriptase generation of complementary DNA (cDNA)
was performed with 0.5 �g of total RNA, primed with a blend of
random hexamer and oligo (dT)s against the RNA library, using an
iScript RT Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Real-time PCR (qPCR) using
Ssofast qPCR Supermix with EvaGreen (Bio-Rad Laboratories) was
conducted using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Life Tech-
nologies) and accompanying software (StepOne Software) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. A dilution curve was generated
from a compilation of the samples and qPCR analysis was performed
using forward and reverse primers for estrogen receptor-� (ESR1),
estrogen receptor-� (ESR2), G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1
(GPER), and the zinc finger protein genes ZNF91, ZMYM6, and
ZFAND4. An initial incubation of 95°C for 10 min was followed by
94°C for 10 s, annealing at 60°C for 10 s, and extension at 72°C for
10 s, for 40 cycles, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.
A melting curve was generated at 55–90°C to monitor the generation
of a single product. 18S RNA (RNA18S) was used as a reference gene
for each sample. Final values of relative gene expression were
calculated and expressed as the ratio normalized to RNA18S. All
analyses were performed in duplicate or triplicate.
Western blot analysis. At the indicated times postinfection cells
were lysed with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS; Fisher Scientific) in
PBS and total protein was measured using the Pierce BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. BSA dilutions (Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit) were used
as the standards. For Western blot analysis, 7–30 �g of total protein
from each sample were separated on 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX
Precast Gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride
Immunobilon-FL membrane (PVDF; Millipore). The membranes
were blocked with PBS containing 5% dry milk powder and 0.05%
Tween-20 (Sigma). Wash buffer contained PBS with 0.05% Tween-
20. Membranes were blocked for 30 min at room temperature (RT),
incubated for 1.5 h at RT with primary antibody, washed three times
each for 5 min, incubated for 1 h at RT with secondary antibody, and
then washed three times each for 5 min. Primary and secondary
antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer. The primary antibodies
used were mouse anti-�-actin (AC-15 MAb; 1:5000 dilution; Abcam-
ab6276), rabbit anti-ESR2 (PAb; 1:100 dilution; Thermo- PA1-310B),
and rabbit anti-ESR1 (1:500 dilution; Genetex-GTX62423). The Al-
exa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibodies used were a goat
anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) and a donkey anti-rabbit IgG
(both at a 1:1,000 dilution; Invitrogen). For visualization, membranes
were imaged using a FluorChemQ phosphorimager (ProteinSimple)
and signal intensities quantified by ImageJ analyses (NIH).
Identification of putative estrogen response elements. The Dragon
ERE Finder version 3.0 (http://datam.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/ereV3/) was
used to identify putative estrogen response elements (EREs) in the
promoters of select genes (1). The NCBI BLAST program was used
search for the annotated start sites of genes of interest against
�11,000 human promoters. These sequences were then used to
pinpoint the location of the putative ERE pattern by expanding them
to cover an extended region of [�5,000, �3,000] relative to genes of
interest start site. We used the recommended search sensitivity of
83%.
Microarray analysis. Trizol reagent and the PureLink RNA Mini
kit (Ambion/Life Technologies) were used for extraction and purifi-
cation of RNA. Cells were processed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Following elution of purified RNA from the PureLink
columns with Nuclease-free water, quantitation was performed using
a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and quality assessment was deter-
mined by RNA Nano LabChip analysis on an Agilent BioAnalyzer
2100 or RNA Screen Tape on an Agilent TapeStation 2200. One
hundred nanograms of total RNA were processed for hybridization to
Affymetrix Human Gene ST 2.0 microarrays using the Affymetrix
GeneChip WT PLUS Reagent Kit according to the manufacturer’s
recommended protocol. The signal amplification protocol for
washing and staining of eukaryotic targets was performed in an
automated fluidics station (Affymetrix FS450) using Affymetrix
protocol FS450_0002. The arrays were scanned in the GCS3000
laser scanner with autoloader and 3G upgrade (Affymetrix). Quality
assessment of hybridizations and scans was performed with Expres-
sion Console software (Affymetrix).
Statistical analyses. For analysis of virus titers, cytokine/chemo-
kine levels, and real-time PCR data, comparisons among treatment
groups were performed using multivariate analysis of variance
(MANOVA; for repeat measures) followed by planned comparisons
or one-way ANOVA with appropriate post hoc tests using SigmaPlot
12 (Systat Software). For microarray analyses, Partek Genomics Suite
version 6.6 was used, with the robust multichip average (RMA)
algorithm used for background correction, normalization, and sum-
marization of probes. ANOVAs with linear contrasts were performed
to generate relative fold change, P values, and gene lists. Statistical
significance was assigned at P � 0.05.
RESULTS
Pretreatment with E2 reduces viral titers in hNECs from
female, but not male, donors. To test the hypothesis that E2 has
antiviral effects on IAV infection, hNEC cultures from female
and male donors were pretreated in the basolateral media with
E2 (0.1, 1, or 10 nM) or vehicle for 24 h before infection with
IAV. During peak virus replication (i.e., 72–96 hpi), E2 pre-
treatment of hNEC cultures from female (Fig. 1A) but not male
(Fig. 1B) donors significantly reduced virus titers compared
with vehicle-treated hNEC cultures (P � 0.05). We interpret
these data to suggest that E2 has a sex-specific antiviral activity
in hNEC cultures.
To determine whether the duration of E2 exposure could
shift the timing of the antiviral effects of E2, hNEC cultures
from female donors were exposed to E2 72 h before or 24 h
after infection with IAV. Pretreatment of hNEC cultures with
E2 for 72 h resulted in a significant reduction in virus titers 48
and 72 hpi compared with vehicle-treated cultures (P � 0.05;
Fig. 2A), while treatment of hNEC cultures 24 hpi significantly
reduced virus titers at 72 hpi (P � 0.05; Fig. 2B). Taken
together, these data suggest that the antiviral activity of E2 in
hNEC cultures from female donors can be induced with treat-
ments over an extended timeframe.
E2 does not affect production of cytokines in response to IAV
infection in female donors. Respiratory epithelial cells are
significant producers of cytokines, chemokines, and type III
interferons in response to IAV infection (36, 49). To test the
hypothesis that E2 reduces IAV titers by altering host immune
responses to infection, hNEC cultures from female donors
were pretreated with E2 (0.1, 1, and 10 nM) or vehicle for 24
h before infection, and the apical supernatants were analyzed at
72 hpi (i.e., during peak virus replication) for production of a
panel of chemokines and type III interferons. Concentrations of
IFN� and all chemokines measured, with the exception of
CCL13 and CCL26, were significantly increased in IAV-
infected hNEC cultures compared with mock infected cultures
derived from females (P � 0.05 in each case; Table 1). In
contrast to the immunomodulatory effects of E2 reported in
reproductive epithelial cells (11, 50, 52), E2 did not signifi-
cantly alter secretion of any chemokine or IFN� in either the
mock- or IAV-infected hNECs compared with the vehicle-
treated hNECs. Therefore, the antiviral effects of E2 on IAV

 infection do not involve altered apical production of IFN� or
chemokines.
The antiviral effects of E2 require intracellular ESR2 sig-
naling in hNECs from female donors. The ER family is
comprised of many ER and ER-like proteins, including the
intracellular genomic E2 receptors ESR1 and ESR2 and the
nongenomic G protein-coupled receptors (e.g., GPER). To test
the hypothesis that the antiviral effects of E2 were mediated by
signaling through genomic rather than nongenomic receptors,
we pretreated hNEC cultures from females with E2 (10 nM),
the genomic ER blocker ICI 182,780 (100 nM), E2 � ICI, or
vehicle for 24 h before inoculation with IAV. Pretreatment of
hNEC cultures with E2 significantly reduced virus titers at 72
and 96 hpi compared with vehicle-treated cells (P � 0.05; Fig.
3), but the addition of ICI with E2 reversed the antiviral effects
of E2 resulting in virus titers that were indistinguishable from
vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 3). These data suggest that the
antiviral effects of E2 are mediated by genomic signaling
through intracellular ERs.
To determine whether hNEC cultures expressed genomic
and nongenomic ERs, we measured transcripts of ESR1, ESR2,
and GPER in hNECs derived from male or female donors
treated with either vehicle or E2 before mock or IAV infection.
At 24 hpi, transcripts of GPER were not detected in hNEC
cultures from male or female donors (data not shown). Al-
though ESR1 was expressed in hNECs derived from both male
and female donors, the expression level was low and was not
altered in the presence of E2 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, ESR2 was
expressed to higher levels in hNECs derived from female than
male donors following exposure to E2 (P � 0.05; Fig. 4B). To
evaluate the kinetics of genomic ER expression, transcripts of
ESR1 and ESR2 were measured 24 and 48 hpi in hNEC
cultures from female donors. Detection of ESR1 mRNA re-
mained low at both 24 and 48 hpi and was not altered by
treatment with E2 (Fig. 4C). In contrast, treatment of hNECs
from females with E2 significantly increased the expression of
ESR2 at 24 hpi but not 48 hpi (P � 0.05; Fig. 4D).
To confirm that hNEC cultures derived from female donors
expressed genomic ER proteins, cell lysates at 24 hpi were
subjected to Western Blot analysis. At 24 hpi, ESR2, but not
ESR1, was detected in hNECs derived from females (Fig. 5, A
and B). Both proteins were detected in MCF-7 cells, indicating
the lack of ESR1 expression in hNEC cultures was not due to
an inability of the antibodies to detect the protein. Taken
together, these data suggest that the activation of ESR2 by E2
in female, but not male, hNECs mediate the sex-specific
antiviral effects of E2.
E2 reduces metabolic processes in hNEC cultures from
females following IAV infection. To uncover potential path-
ways affected by E2-ESR2 signaling in hNEC cultures derived
from females, we conducted microarray analyses on RNA
isolated at 24 and 48 hpi. To determine the selective effects of
E2 on gene expression during IAV infection, samples from
IAV-infected cultures were normalized to mock-infected cul-

 tures from the same hormone treatment condition. Overall,
significantly more genes were altered by E2 treatment at 24
compared with 48 hpi. Using a fold change of 1.3 and P �
0.05, we determined that 666 transcripts were differentially
expressed in hNECs treated with E2 compared with vehicle at
24 hpi and only 234 transcripts were differentially expressed at
48 hpi (Fig. 6A). There were only seven overlapping genes that
were differentially expressed in hNECs treated with E2 com-
pared with vehicle at both 24 and 48 hpi (Fig. 6A). Gene
Ontology Enrichment revealed that the biological functions
with the greatest number of differentially expressed genes in
hNECs treated with E2 compared with vehicle at 24 hpi
included organelle organization and cellular metabolic pro-
cesses, both of which received significant enrichment scores
(i.e., � a score of 3; Fig. 6B). Further analyses revealed that a
family of zinc finger protein (ZFP) genes was the largest
cluster of genes differentially expressed at 24 hpi in response
to E2 treatment of hNEC cultures (Fig. 6C).
To determine whether E2 could transcriptionally regulate the
activity of these zinc finger genes, we used Dragon ERE Finder
version
3.0
(http://http://datam.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/ereV3/)
to
identify putative EREs in the promoter regions of ZFP genes.

infection by E2, 21 had at least one putative or known EREs
present in their promoters (Fig. 7A). Of the 21 ZFP genes that
had putative EREs in their promoters, 20 of these genes had
two or more putative EREs, 11 of which have been experi-
mentally confirmed to bind to ERs (1). ZFPs play diverse roles
in regulating cellular function and responses to damage; their
role in IAV infection, however, is largely unknown. Of the 38
ZFP genes that were downregulated in the presence of E2
during IAV infection, ZNF91, ZMYM6, and ZFAND4 were of
particular interest because of the large number of EREs present
in their promoters (i.e., ZNF91 and ZMYM6) or because they
belong to a family of ZFPs that can have antiviral activity (i.e.,
ZFAND4) (28). The effects of E2 on the expression of ZNF91,
ZMYM6, and ZFAND4 transcripts were validated using real
time RT-PCR, which confirmed that E2 significantly down-
regulated ZNF91 and ZMYM6 at 24 hpi but not 48 hpi (P �
0.05; Fig. 7B). While ZFAND4 expression was reduced at 24
hpi, this did not achieve statistical significance (P � 0.057;
Fig. 7B). Taken together, these data suggest that E2 has the
potential to directly regulate transcription of ZFP genes, which
may provide a novel mechanism for reducing late stage virus
replication.
Estrogenic chemicals that selectively bind to ESR2 reduce
IAV titers in hNECs from females. Selective estrogen receptor
modulators are a class of FDA-approved therapeutic estrogenic
chemicals, while BPA is a xenoestrogen forming the backbone
of various plastic and consumer products. These estrogenic
chemicals have differential affinity for ERs in a variety of
tissues (21). To determine if compounds that bind genomic
ERs could decrease IAV titers, similar to E2, hNEC cultures
from females were pretreated with raloxifene, clomiphene
citrate, ospemifene, BPA, or vehicle 24 h before infection with
IAV. Raloxifene, but not clomiphene citrate or ospemifene,
significantly reduced viral titers at 72 and 96 hpi compared
with vehicle-treated cultures (P � 0.05; Fig. 8A). Treatment of
hNECs with BPA also significantly reduced viral titer at 48 and
72 hpi compared with vehicle-treated hNECs (P � 0.05; Fig.

 8B). Both raloxifene and BPA have stronger binding affinities
for ESR2 than ESR1 (24), suggesting that chemicals that
selectively bind ESR2 have antiviral activity against IAV
infection of respiratory epithelial cells from females.
DISCUSSION
In this study, E2 and select estrogenic chemicals had antivi-
ral effects against IAV infection. These estrogenic compounds
reduced peak viral titer, which did not involve changes in the
secretion of chemokines or IFN�, but rather was associated
with reduced metabolic processes. The effects of estrogens
were specific for hNEC cultures from female, but not male,
donors. The antiviral effects were most likely mediated by
signaling through ESR2 as ESR2, but not ESR1 or GPER, was
expressed in hNEC cultures and the protective effects of E2
were eliminated in the presence of the genomic ER antagonist
ICI 182,780.
Antiviral effects of E2 and estrogenic chemicals have been
reported previously against viruses including HIV, hepatitis C
virus (HCV), Ebola virus, and human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV). Estradiol can prevent HIV transcription by blocking
HIV promoter activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
and preventing HIV entry in CD4� T cell and macrophages
(48, 55). Estradiol also prevents the production of infectious
HCV particles (12). Certain FDA-approved SERMs inhibit
Ebola and other Marburg viruses in vivo and in vitro (17).
Furthermore, SERMs, including clomiphene and raloxifene,
inhibit HCV infection at multiple stages of the virus life cycle
and, raloxifene, in particular, acts as an adjuvant to improve
antiviral HCV therapies in postmenopausal women (9, 37).
While E2 has antiviral activities against a wide range of
viruses, it is still not clear whether the molecular mechanisms
involved are conserved across virus families or result from
changes in different cellular pathways resulting from the broad
effects of E2 on cellular gene expression. Implications of these
findings are far reaching as a significantly greater proportion of
the world population is exposed to IAV and suffer from
influenza annually than Ebola, HCV, HCMV, or HIV (63).

 The inhibition of IAV infectious virus production in E2 or
SERMs treated hNECs from female donors only occurred at
late times after low MOI infection, with the magnitude of the
antiviral effects being greater when cells were treated before
rather than after the initiation of infection. Because the inhibi-
tion of virus titer occurs at a time when the infection in the
hNECs is no longer synchronized among the cells in the
cultures, the E2-induced reduction in titer could be resulting
from E2 effects at multiple stages of the virus life cycle (i.e.,
entry, replication, reinfection). Therefore, we hypothesized that
there may be some combination of host response and virus
infection occurring synergistically to impair virus replication at
later time points of infection.
Our microarray data indicate that E2 significantly alters the
expression of genes involved in metabolic processes. Within
the differentially regulated genes comprising metabolic pro-
cesses, the largest family of E2-downregulated genes in IAV-
infected hNECs from females was the one that encodes for
ZFPs. Very little is known about the function of many of these
ZFPs, let alone their potential roles in the IAV life cycle. In
general, ZFPs are transcriptional regulators that can induce or
repress host gene transcription (25). Because these ZFPs are all
similarly downregulated in response to E2 treatment and IAV
infection and expressed EREs in their promoters, this may
point to a common transcription factor or activation pathway
responsible for the antiviral effects of E2. There is a growing
appreciation of the importance of various metabolic, cell cycle,
and lipid metabolism pathways for productive IAV infection
(60), and downregulation of these ZFPs may be exerting an
antiviral activity by altering those pathways.
Both ESR1 and ESR2 are present in the upper and lower
respiratory tract and are required for the development and
function of the lung but exhibit distinct cell-type-specific
expression patterns (5, 15, 29). ESR2 has been found in
bronchial epithelial cells and alveoli, whereas ESR1 is mostly
limited to alveolar macrophages and endothelial blood vessel
cells, with modest expression in bronchial epithelial cells (15,
29, 40, 58). In primary human bronchial epithelial cells
(HBECs) and HBEC cell lines from males and females, the
amount of ESR2 is almost doubled compared with ESR1 (15).
In the nasal mucosa, ESR2 is also the dominant ER present
and, in some studies, the only ER detectable (34, 43, 53),
which is consistent with our data. Similar to our results, in lung
adenocarcinoma cells, only the ERs in cells from females
respond to E2 and other ER ligands (7). Although no studies
have investigated the ESR1:ESR2 relationship in the respira-
tory tract, in mammary, uterine, and prostate tissue, where both
subtypes of ER are expressed, ESR2 is antagonistic to ESR1,

pretreated with E2 (10 nM) or vehicle for 24
h in the basolateral media and then infected

were harvested, and RNA was isolated and
spotted on Affymetrix Human GeneST2.0
arrays. Data from infected hNECs were nor-
malized to uninfected hNECs within the
same treatment group and ANOVAs in
Partek Genomics Suite version 6.0 were
used to determine significant differences be-
tween E2- and vehicle-treated, IAV-infected
hNECs. The Venn diagram (A) illustrates the
number of differentially expressed genes at

to group genes differentially expressed be-
tween E2- and vehicle-treated, IAV-infected
hNECs at 24 hpi into functional hierarchies
based on enrichment score, with scores �3
indicating significant differences. C: heat

clustering to represent the largest family of

that encode zinc finger proteins (ZFP)] be-
tween E2- and vehicle-treated, IAV-infected

 inhibiting ESR1-mediated gene expression (13, 31). The ex-
pression of ESR2 has also been shown to alter the recruitment
of ESR1 transcriptional cofactors and increase the degradation
of ESR1, suggesting that ESR2 can mediate or dominate ESR1
signaling in the same cell (31, 32), which may explain why low
levels of ESR1 mRNA, but not ESR1 protein, is detectable in
hNECs.
ESR1 and ESR2 have similar DNA binding homology but
only share 57% homology in their ligand binding domains,
contributing to differences in transcriptional activities and
tissue-specific cellular responses triggered through ligand-
dependent ER activation (27). For example, E2, through
ESR1, the dominant receptor in the female reproductive
tract, decreases the production of human �-defensin 2

 (HBD2) and elafin in the vaginal epithelium but increases
HBD2 and elafin in the uterine epithelium (61). ESR2 is
required for overall lung function, whereas ESR1 is required
to control inflammation in the lung (35, 58). In mice,
signaling through ESR1, but not ESR2, reduces pulmonary
concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines and chemo-
kines in the lungs and improves the outcome of influenza in
female mice (47). In addition to the tissue type, the biolog-
ical effects of E2 are contingent on the concentration of E2.
Physiological levels of E2, signaling through ESR1, promote
proinflammatory type 1 IFN production via Toll-like recep-
tor stimulation and induction type 1 IFN genes (23). Con-
versely, high E2 levels consistent with those found before
ovulation and during pregnancy are protective against ex-
cessive inflammatory responses (54). In our study, physio-
logically relevant levels of E2 had no effect on the induction
of chemokines or IFN� in cells from the upper respiratory
tract. This may reflect a fundamental difference between
signaling through ESR2 in upper respiratory tract epithelial
cells and signaling through ESR1 in immune cells in the
lower respiratory tract and reproductive tract. Future studies
will need to compare ER signaling in mouse and human
epithelial and immune cells in the upper and lower respira-
tory tract to definitively resolve the differences in how E2
protects against IAV in both hNECs and mice. Collectively
our data illustrate that cell type-specific differences in ER
expression result in differential modes of protection.
In the current study, of the SERMs tested, only raloxifene
and BPA significantly decreased IAV titer in a manner similar
to E2. Raloxifene can bind to both ESR1 and ESR2 but has a
higher affinity for ESR2 (16). Furthermore, raloxifene binding
to ESR2 results in an increase in ESR2 reporter gene expres-
sion but minimal expression after binding to ESR1 (39). BPA
can have varying affinity for ERs depending on the cell or
tissue in which it is measured (24). Ospemifene can bind both
ERs with similar affinity, and, while the affinities of clomi-
phene citrate for ESR1 and ESR2 are unknown, clomiphene
citrate is a well-documented ESR2 antagonist, inhibiting
ESR2-mediated cellular events. We hypothesize that os-
pemifene and clomiphene citrate did not inhibit virus replica-
tion because they do not signal primarily through ESR2 (21).
The data from the present study implicate signaling through
ESR2 as being critical for the antiviral effects of E2 in hNEC
cultures from female donors.
After the Women’s Health Initiative raised concerns
about estrogen replacement therapy, the use of SERMs as
safer alternatives has greatly increased in the United States
(21). Repurposing SERMs as antivirals could be a beneficial
and a novel therapeutic for the many women currently
prescribed SERMs for other diseases. The expression of ERs
in the respiratory tract implies that E2 and SERMs can affect
the function of tissues and organs outside of the reproduc-
tive tract. Understanding these effects will help shed light
on additional novel functions of E2 in pulmonary cellular
physiology.
