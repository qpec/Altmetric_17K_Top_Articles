Parental Debt and Children’
s 
Socioemotional Well-being
Lawrence M. Berger, PhD, MSWa Jason N. Houle, PhD
abstract
OBJECTIVES: We estimated associations between total amount of parental debt and of home 
mortgage, student loan, automobile, and unsecured debt with children’
s socioemotional 
well-being.
METHODS: We used population-based longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study 
of Youth 1979 Cohort and Children of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979 Cohort. 
Our analytic sample consisted of 29 318 child-year observations of 9011 children and 
their mothers observed annually or biennially from 1986 to 2008. We used the Behavioral 
Problems Index to measure socioemotional well-being. We used ordinary least squares 
regressions to estimate between-child associations of amounts and types of parental debt 
with socioemotional well-being, net of a host of control variables, and regressions with 
child-specific fixed effects to estimate within-child associations of changes in parental 
debt with changes in socioemotional well-being, net of all time-constant observed and 
unobserved confounders.
RESULTS: Greater total debt was associated with poorer child socioemotional well-being. 
However, this association varied by type of debt. Specifically, higher levels of home 
mortgage and education debt were associated with greater socioemotional well-being for 
children, whereas higher levels of and increases in unsecured debt were associated with 
lower levels of and declines in child socioemotional well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: Debt that allows for investment in homes (and perhaps access to better 
neighborhoods and schools) and parental education is associated with greater 
socioemotional well-being for children, whereas unsecured debt is negatively associated 
with socioemotional development, which may reflect limited financial resources to invest in 
children and/or parental financial stress. This suggests that debt is not universally harmful 
for children’
s well-being, particularly if used to invest in a home or education.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Previous studies 
suggest that some types of debt are negatively 
associated with adult well-being and mental health 
outcomes. However, no study to our knowledge has 
examined how parental debt is associated with child 
socioemotional well-being.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: By using population-based 
longitudinal data and fi
 xed-effects regressions, we 
fi
 nd that increases in home mortgage and education 
debt are positively associated with children’s 
socioemotional well-being, whereas increases in 
unsecured debt are associated with declines in 
children’s socioemotional well-being.

Children’
s socioemotional well-
being is strongly associated with 
family socioeconomic resources.1–4 
An abundance of research shows 
that low income, poverty, and 
economic hardship are associated 
with children’
s well-being,5–12 
and these associations may be 
causal.13 Also, wealth and assets are 
positively associated with children’
s 
well-being, such that children fare 
better, on average, in wealthier 
families.14–16 Both having limited 
access to economic resources 
and experiencing a decline in 
economic resources are associated 
with greater stress and harsher 
parenting practices as well as poorer 
physical and social environments, 
parental mental health, and 
parent-child relationships, each 
of which is negatively related 
to children’
s socioemotional 
development.5–7,10–12,14,15,17,18 In turn, 
socioemotional well-being during 
childhood has important implications 
for adult health, socioeconomic 
well-being, and social mobility.19–23 
Despite the voluminous literature on 
economic resources and child well-
being, no research to our knowledge 
has examined links between parental 
debt and child well-being.
Debt has become a central 
component of household resources. 
Beginning in the 1980s, financial 
deregulation increased the supply of 
credit and gave banks more power 
to control interest rates,24,25 making 
debt more difficult to repay for the 
average US family.26,27 Given that 
family finances play a key role in 
child development, it is plausible that 
debt is associated with child well-
being, although the direction of the 
association is not clear a priori. On 
one hand, debt offers the ability to 
invest in assets and human capital, 
which provide resources that could 
improve children’
s well-being. Access 
to credit also can provide families 
with resources to weather difficult 
times. Conversely, debt may trigger 
financial stress, either because 
families use debt to substitute for 
income or have difficulty repaying 
debt; such stress may lead to declines 
in the caregiving environment and 
child well-being.
Associations between debt 
and children’
s socioemotional 
development also may vary by the 
type of debt accrued; however, most 
studies have focused on overall 
debt or on one type of debt, rather 
than simultaneously considering 
all types of debt.28–34 Yet, different 
types of debt are fungible (ie, home 
equity loans may be used to repay 
unsecured debt) and (typically low 
cost) debt used for asset or human 
capital investment may positively 
influence well-being, whereas 
(higher-cost) unsecured debt may 
negatively influence well-being, 
particularly over time. Finally, 
debt may mediate or moderate 
associations between socioeconomic 
status and child well-being.
Previous research on debt and 
socioemotional well-being has 
focused on adults, and findings have 
been mixed. A handful of studies 
find positive associations of debt 
with financial stress and anxiety 
among adults,31,32,35 including 
mothers of young children,36 
and negative associations with 
adult mental health28,31–34,36–40 
and marital satisfaction and 
conflict.29,30 However, others find 
debt to be negatively associated 
with depression29 and positively 
associated with self-esteem and 
mastery.41 These inconsistencies 
may reflect methodological 
differences across studies, as well as 
heterogeneity by type of debt.37
We extend previous research by 
examining associations between 
parental debt and children’
s 
socioemotional well-being. We 
consider the role of different types of 
debt: mortgage debt, education debt, 
automobile debt, and unsecured debt 
(credit card and other debt that is 
not tied to an asset). We hypothesize 
that home and education debt 
will be positively associated with 
child socioemotional development 
by allowing families to invest in 
resources that improve children’
s 
well-being, whereas unsecured 
debt will be negatively associated 
with children’
s socioemotional 
development because it is often used 
to supplement inadequate income, 
can be difficult to repay, and may be a 
signal of financial (dis)stress.24,42,43
DATA
We use population-based 
longitudinal data on children and 
their mothers, observed biennially 
from 1986 to 2008 in the National 
Longitudinal Study of Youth 1979 
Cohort and Children of the National 
Longitudinal Study of Youth 
1979 Cohort. Because the child 
socioemotional well-being measure 
was administered only to mothers 
of children age 5 to 14, we limit our 
sample to 5- to 14-year old children. 
Furthermore, because information 
on debt was not collected in 2002 
or 2006, we exclude those years 
from our analyses. We identified 
38 027 child-year observations of 
10 175 5- to 15-year-old children 
spanning 1986 to 2008. We then 
excluded 1164 children (8709 child-
year observations) with missing 
socioemotional well-being or debt 
data, resulting in an analytic sample 
of 29 318 child-year observations 
of 9011 children and mothers. No 
significant difference in baseline 
behavior problems or total, home, 
educational, or unsecured debt 
between excluded and nonexcluded 
cases was revealed by t tests; 
excluded cases had slightly lower 
levels of auto debt, lower levels of 
maternal education, US nativity, 
slightly smaller household sizes, 
slightly lower maternal aptitude 
scores, and higher rates of child 
disability and low birth weight status. 
We organized the data in the form of 
a constructed age cohort, such that 
children are observed biennially at

ages 5 to 6, 7 to 8, 9 to 10, 11 to 12, 
and 13 to 14. We replaced missing 
values on the control variables with 
the sample mean (for continuous 
variables) or zero (for dichotomous 
variables), and included indicators 
for whether each respondent had 
missing data on a particular measure 
as a control in all regressions.
MEASURES
Socioemotional Well-being
We use a child’
s total score on the 
Behavioral Problems Index44 to 
assess socioemotional well-being. 
Each child’
s mother was asked 28 
items about child problem behaviors. 
Responses were summed to a total 
score ranging from 0 to 28. We 
age-standardize the total score in 
3-month intervals to have a mean of 
0 and standard deviation (SD) of 1.
Debt
We measure total parental debt 
as well as 4 types of debt. Total 
debt is the sum of all nonbusiness-
related debt. Home debt consists of 
all mortgage or home equity loans. 
Education debt is owed for student 
loans. Auto debt includes loans for 
the purchase of a vehicle (but not 
auto-title loans, which are included 
in unsecured debt). Unsecured debt 
includes all other types of debt, 
such as credit (bank or store) card 
debt; money owed to businesses, 
individuals, or banks; and medical 
debt. Because access to credit varies 
by socioeconomic status, we would 
ideally divide unsecured debt into 
specific categories (medical debt, 
payday loan debt, auto-title loan 
debt, and credit card debt). However, 
our data do not allow for such 
distinctions, with the exception that 
credit card debt is differentiated in 
2004 and 2008. In those years, credit 
card debt accounts for approximately 
two-thirds of all unsecured debt. We 
applied a consistent 2% top code to 
each debt amount across surveys and 
adjusted for inflation, such that we 
report debt in constant 2013 dollars. 
Because debt is highly right-skewed 
and violates the homoscedasticity 
assumption of regression models, we 
model the natural logarithm of debt 
(plus a constant to account for 0 debt 
values).
Controls
We use 2 sets of control variables. 
Time stable confounders are 
exogenous to (cannot be jointly 
determined with) parental debt and 
child socioemotional development 
and do not vary over time. These 
include baseline measures of the 
mother’
s race (black, Hispanic, 
white/other race [reference group]), 
nativity status, age, household size, 
number of children in the household, 
academic aptitude (age-standardized 
Armed Forces Qualifying Test score 
in 1980), number of fights at work 
or school (a proxy for impulsivity, 
measured in 1980), locus of control 
(measured in 1979; range 4–16; 
standardized to have a mean of 0 and 
SD of 1), and self-esteem (measured 
in 1980; range 6–30; standardized 
to have a mean of 0 and SD of 1), as 
well as whether the focal child was 
born with a low birth weight and is 
disabled. Time-varying confounders, 
which may be endogenous to (jointly 
determined with) parental debt and 
child socioemotional development 
include mother’
s marital status, 
household income (logged; 2013 
dollars), educational attainment 
(less than a high school degree, high 
school degree [reference group], 
some college, 4-year college degree 
or more), the percentage of weeks 
the mother was unemployed in the 
past year, and homeownership. All 
models also control for parental 
debt when the child was age 3 
to 4 (at the observation point 
immediately before the first measure 
of socioemotional well-being, at age 
5 to 6), as well as year of observation 
(year fixed effects).
METHODS
We first present bivariate 
comparisons of child socioemotional 
well-being and family characteristics 
for families with and without any 
form of debt and for families with 
and without unsecured debt. We 
then estimate a series of regression 
models of the association between 
debt and child socioemotional 
development. The first set of models 
focuses on total amount of parental 
debt. The second focuses on amounts 
of specific types of debt (education, 
home, auto, and unsecured). We 
estimate 6 regressions for each set: 
(1) an ordinary least squares (OLS) 
regression that considers debt and 
socioemotional well-being net of 
time-stable characteristics; (2) an 
OLS regression that controls for all 
covariates; (3) an OLS regression that 
controls for time-stable confounders 
and a lagged measure of child 
socioemotional well-being; (4) an 
OLS regression that controls for all 
covariates and a lagged measure of 
child socioemotional well-being; (5) 
an OLS regression that controls for 
time-stable confounders and includes 
child-specific fixed effects; and (6) an 
OLS regression that controls for all 
covariates and includes child-specific 
fixed effects.
The inclusion of a lagged measure 
of behavior problems functions as 
a proxy for unobserved preexisting 
differences between children and 
adjusts for the average influence of 
baseline behavior problems on later 
behavior problems, assuming that 
the baseline measure (and associated 
unobserved factors) has an identical 
effect on subsequent behavior 
problems for children who did and 
did not experience parental debt. In 
the fixed-effects models, each child 
serves as his or her own comparison, 
allowing us to estimate the change 
in socioemotional well-being that is 
associated with a change in parental 
debt. The method expresses each 
variable as a deviation from a 
child’
s mean value (over time) on

that measure and differences the 
regression equation across time 
periods. This eliminates all time-
invariant observed and unobserved 
variables from the model, preventing 
the estimates from being biased by 
such factors. However, fixed-effects 
estimates are subject to bias if 
unobserved variables (or their effects 
on the outcome) are time-varying. 
We reduce the likelihood of such bias 
by including relevant time-varying 
confounders in our models.45
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics are presented 
in Table 1. On average, children 
whose parents have any debt have 
0.21 SDs fewer behavior problems 
than children whose parents have 
no debt. However, children whose 
parents have unsecured debt exhibit, 
on average, 0.12 SDs more behavior 
problems than those whose parents 
do not have unsecured debt. Parents 
with any unsecured debt averaged 
almost $10 000 in total unsecured 
debt and had greater levels of total, 
education, and auto debt, but less 
home debt than those with no 
unsecured debt.
Debtor and nondebtor families 
differed on a host of characteristics. 
Those with debt and with unsecured 
debt were disproportionately white 
and US born. On average, they were 
more highly educated (with the 
exception that those with a college 
degree or more were less likely to 
have unsecured debt, although not 
overall debt), exhibited greater 
academic aptitudes and levels of 
self-esteem, were more likely to be 
married and to own their homes, and 
reported fewer nonworking weeks. 
These differences likely reflect that 
more advantaged individuals have 
greater access to credit and are 
therefore more likely to take on debt. 
Parents with a disabled child were 
disproportionately likely to have 
debt.46 Such differences highlight the 
importance of adjusting for a range 
of characteristics that may influence 
associations between debt and child 
socioemotional well-being.
Table 2 presents regression results 
for total parental debt (Panel A) and 
types of parental debt (Panel B). 
The standard OLS results in Panel 
A reveal that, without controlling 
for time-varying covariates, total 
debt is negatively associated with 
child behavior problems. However, 
once time-varying covariates are 
controlled (Model 2), total debt 
is positively associated with child 
behavior problems. This suggests 
that the positive correlation found 
in Model 1 reflects higher levels 
of marriage, income, education, 
homeownership, and work, among 
those with debt. When fixed-effects 
are included (Model 6), we find a 
negative association between total 
debt and socioemotional well-being, 
suggesting that a 10% increase in 
total debt is roughly associated 
with a 0.04 SD increase in behavior 
problems.
The results in Panel B indicate that 
there is variation in this association 
by model specification and debt type. 
Whereas standard OLS estimates 
reveal no associations between 
education debt and child behavior 
problems, the fixed-effects results 
reveal a negative association, despite 
adjusting for increased educational 
attainment. In addition, when 
controlling only for time-stable (and 
not time-varying) characteristics, 
the between-child estimates 
(standard OLS and lagged dependent 
variable models) suggest a negative 
association between home debt and 
child behavior problems. However, 
this association is no longer apparent 
when time-varying characteristics 
or child-specific fixed effects are 
included, suggesting that it reflects 
differences in child socioemotional 
well-being between homeowner and 
nonhomeowner families rather than 
an effect of home debt itself.
Unsecured debt is positively and 
significantly associated with child 
behavior problems across all 6 
models. The between-child estimates 
(Models 1–4) indicate that 10% more 
unsecured debt is roughly associated 
with 0.07 (lagged dependent 
variable model) to 0.14 (standard 
OLS model) SDs more behavior 
problems. The within-child estimates 
(Models 5 and 6) indicate that a 
10% increase in unsecured debt is 
associated with a 0.05 SD increase in 
behavior problems. Although these 
associations may appear small in 
magnitude, given that the average 
unsecured debtor in the sample owes 
$10 000, an increase from $5000 
in debt to the average debt level (a 
100% increase), is associated with 
a 0.5 SD increase in child behavior 
problems. The mean Behavioral 
Problems Index score for our full 
sample is 8.8 and the SD is 6.2. Thus, 
a 0.5 SD increase from the mean 
represents an increase of 3.1 points 
or 35%; a large and substantively 
significant effect, which may 
have substantial impacts on child 
well-being.
We also estimated supplemental 
models (results not shown) in which 
we examined whether debt mediated 
or moderated the association 
between income or maternal 
education and child well-being. We 
found no substantial or consistent 
evidence that debt acted as mediator 
or moderator of the association of 
income or maternal education with 
child socioemotional well-being. 
However, these analyses may lack 
statistical power to detect effects.
CONCLUSIONS
Previous research on debt and 
socioemotional well-being has 
focused on adults and produced 
mixed findings.28–41 Yet, no research 
to our knowledge has examined the 
link between parental debt and child 
well-being, and few studies have 
examined differences in associations 
by types of debt, nor rigorously 
adjusted for potential confounders

of the association between debt and 
well-being.
Although social selection is a concern 
in observational studies, our analyses 
address selection bias in 2 ways. 
Our between-child estimates adjust 
for an extensive set of background 
characteristics and our within-child 
(fixed effects) estimates use a child as 
his or her own control, and therefore 
represent associations of changes in 
debt with changes in socioemotional 
well-being while netting out all time-
invariant observed and unobserved 
characteristics. Furthermore, we 
estimate associations for total 
parental debt as well as amounts 
of types of debt. We find that total 
debt is positively associated with 
child behavior problems; however, 
this association is driven largely by 
unsecured debt. Unsecured debt is 
positively associated with behavior 
problems in both the between-child 
and within-child models. This finding 
is generally consistent with the 
findings of Berger and colleagues32 
from their analysis of debt and adult 
depressive symptoms. Our data did 
not allow us to differentiate between 
types of unsecured debt, as noted 
previously. Future research should 
examine whether associations of 
unsecured debt and child well-being 
differ across types of unsecured debt.
In addition, our between-child 
(but not within-child) estimates 
reveal that home debt is negatively 
associated with behavior problems. 
This likely reflects selection bias, as 
the association is reduced to zero 
after controlling for homeownership. 
However, our within-child (but not 
between-child) estimates reveal 
that education debt is negatively 
associated with behavior problems. 
This finding is perplexing, given that 
it is only apparent after controlling 
for within-child changes in maternal 
education. One possibility is that 
this association could be operating 
through pathways other than degree 
attainment. For example, it could 
reflect quality of education or type 
of institution attended.47 If so, it too 
may reflect selection bias. However, 
future research is needed to better 
understand the link between parental 
education debt and child well-being, 
given that recent college-going 
parents have the highest levels of 
student debt in history.48
Our estimates for unsecured debt are 
robust across all model specifications, 
lending support to the possibility that 
they may be causal. Theoretically,

unsecured debt may be a signal of 
financial distress, generally entails 
high interest rates and fees (making 
it difficult to repay), and is often 
used for immediate consumption 
rather than investment.24,42,43 Thus, 
unsecured debt may induce stress, 
anxiety, or other adverse indicators 
of psychosocial functioning for 
parents, each of which is associated 
with poorer-quality parental 
behaviors, which are, in turn, 
negatively associated with child 
well-being. Future research should 
examine the potential pathways 
through which various types and 
amounts of debt may be linked 
to child well-being. Future work 
should also further examine whether 
associations between (particular 
types of debt) and child well-being 
may differ by socioeconomic status, 
as well as whether debt may function 
as a mediator or moderator of 
associations between income and 
child well-being.
In sum, our results suggest that 
unsecured debt, and perhaps 
the financial deregulatory 
policies that precipitated the 
rise in debt, is linked to poorer 
socioemotional development for 
children. This is of concern given 
that socioemotional well-being in 
childhood is linked to a range of 
adverse outcomes throughout the 
life course. Pediatricians should be 
concerned about the socioemotional 
development of children whose 
parents have unsecured debt. It may 
be efficacious to discuss with parents 
whether they are experiencing 
financial-related stressors, such 
as unsecured debt, and whether 
and how such stressors may be 
influencing their parenting and 
interactions with children. Given 
that doctors’
 time with patients is 
limited and expensive, one approach 
may be for the health care providers 
to flag overdue medical bills and 
include items about debt struggles on 
intake forms. This may allow for easy 
identification of patients who may be 
struggling with debt, who could then 
be engaged in a short conversation 
and perhaps given a referral to a 
financial coach or community agency 
that specializes in this area.
