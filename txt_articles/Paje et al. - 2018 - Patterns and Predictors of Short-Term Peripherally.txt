P
eripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are inte-
gral to the care of hospitalized patients in the United 
States.1 Consequently, utilization of these devices in 
acutely ill patients has steadily increased in the past 
decade.2 Although originally designed to support the deliv-
ery of total parenteral nutrition, PICCs have found broader 
applications in the hospital setting given the ease and safety 
of placement, the advances in technology that facilitate inser-
tion, and the growing availability of specially trained vascular 
nurses that place these devices at the bedside.3 Furthermore, 
because they are placed in deeper veins of the arm, PICCs are 
more durable than peripheral catheters and can support ve-
nous access for extended durations.4-6 
However, the growing use of PICCs has led to the realization 
that these devices are not without attendant risks. For exam-
ple, PICCs are associated with venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
and central-line associated blood stream infection (CLABSI).7,8 
Additionally, complications such as catheter occlusion and tip 
migration commonly occur and may interrupt care or neces-
sitate device removal.9-11 Hence, thoughtful weighing of the 
risks against the benefits of PICC use prior to placement is 
necessary. To facilitate such decision-making, we developed 
the Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous (IV) Cath-
eters (MAGIC) criteria,12 which is an evidence-based tool that 
defines when the use of a PICC is appropriate in hospitalized 
adults.
The use of PICCs for infusion of peripherally compatible 
therapies for 5 or fewer days is rated as inappropriate by MAG-
IC.12 This strategy is also endorsed by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention’s (CDC) guidelines for the prevention 
of catheter-related infections.13 Despite these recommenda-
tions, short-term PICC use remains common. For example, a 
study conducted at a tertiary pediatric care center reported a 
trend toward shorter PICC dwell times and increasing rates of 
early removal.2 However, factors that prompt such short-term 
PICC use are poorly understood. Without understanding driv-

BACKGROUND: The guidelines for peripherally inserted 
central catheters (PICCs) recommend avoiding insertion 
if the anticipated duration of use is ≤5 days. However, 
short-term PICC use is common in hospitals. We sought to 
identify patient, provider, and device characteristics and 
the clinical outcomes associated with short-term PICCs.
METHODS: Between January 2014 and June 2016, trained 
abstractors at 52 Michigan Hospital Medicine Safety (HMS) 
Consortium sites collected data from medical records 
of adults that received PICCs during hospitalization. 
Patients were prospectively followed until PICC removal, 
death, or 70 days after insertion. Multivariable logistic 
regression models were fit to identify factors associated 
with short-term PICCs, defined as dwell time of ≤5 days. 
Complications associated with short-term use, including 
major (eg, venous thromboembolism [VTE] or central line-
associated bloodstream infection [CLABSI]) or minor (eg, 
catheter occlusion, tip migration) events were assessed.
RESULTS: Of the 15,397 PICCs placed, 3902 (25.3%) had a 
dwell time of ≤5 days. Most (95.5%) short-term PICCs were 
removed during hospitalization. Compared to PICCs placed 
for >5 days, variables associated with short-term PICCs 
included difficult venous access (odds ratio [OR], 1.54; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.40-1.69), multilumen devices (OR, 
1.53; 95% CI, 1.39-1.69), and teaching hospitals (OR, 1.25; 
95% CI, 1.04-1.52). Among those with short-term PICCs, 
374 (9.6%) experienced a complication, including 99 (2.5%) 
experiencing VTE and 17 (0.4%) experiencing CLABSI 
events. The most common minor complications were 
catheter occlusion (4%) and tip migration (2.2%).
CONCLUSION: Short-term use of PICCs is common and 
associated with patient, provider, and device factors. As 
PICC placement, even for brief periods, is associated 
with complications, efforts targeted at factors underlying 
such use appear necessary. Journal of Hospital Medicine

ers and outcomes of short-term PICC use, interventions to pre-
vent such practice are unlikely to succeed.
Therefore, by using data from a multicenter cohort study, we 
examined patterns of short-term PICC use and sought to iden-
tify which patient, provider, and device factors were associat-
ed with such use. We hypothesized that short-term placement 
would be associated with difficult venous access and would 
also be associated with the risk of major and minor compli-
cations.
METHODS
Study Setting and Design
We used data from the Michigan Hospital Medicine Safe-
ty (HMS) Consortium to examine patterns and predictors of 
short-term PICC use.14 As a multi-institutional clinical quality 
initiative sponsored by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan 
and Blue Care Network, HMS aims to improve the quality of 
care by preventing adverse events in hospitalized medical pa-
tients.4,15-17 In January of 2014, dedicated, trained abstractors 
started collecting data on PICC placements at participating 
HMS hospitals by using a standard protocol and template for 
data collection. Patients who received PICCs while admitted 
to either a general medicine unit or an intensive care unit (ICU) 
during clinical care were eligible for inclusion. Patients were 
excluded if they were (a) under the age of 18 years, (b) preg-
nant, (c) admitted to a nonmedical service (eg, surgery), or (d) 
admitted under observation status.
Every 14 days, each hospital collected data on the first 17 
eligible patients that received a PICC, with at least 7 of these 
placements occurring in an ICU setting. All patients were pro-
spectively followed until the PICC was removed, death, or until 
70 days after insertion, whichever occurred first. For patients 
who had their PICC removed prior to hospital discharge, fol-
low-up occurred via a review of medical records. For those 
discharged with a PICC in place, both medical record review 
and telephone follow-up were performed. To ensure data 
quality, annual random audits at each participating hospital 
were performed by the coordinating center at the University 
 
of Michigan.
For this analysis, we included all available data as of June 30, 
2016. However, HMS hospitals continue to collect data on PICC 
use and outcomes as part of an ongoing clinical quality initia-
tive to reduce the incidence of PICC-related complications.
Patient, Provider, and Device Data
Patient characteristics, including demographics, detailed 
medical history, comorbidities, physical findings, laborato-
ry results, and medications were abstracted directly from 
medical records. To estimate the comorbidity burden, the 
Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score was calculated for each 
patient by using data available in the medical record at the 
time of PICC placement.18 Data, such as the documented in-
dication for PICC insertion and the reason for removal, were 
obtained directly from medical records. Provider character-
istics, including the specialty of the attending physician at 
the time of insertion and the type of operator who inserted 
the PICC, were also collected. Institutional characteristics, 
such as total number of beds, teaching versus nonteaching, 
and urban versus rural, were obtained from hospital publicly 
reported data and semiannual surveys of HMS sites.19,20 Data 
on device characteristics, such as catheter gauge, coating, 
insertion attempts, tip location, and number of lumens, 
were abstracted from PICC insertion notes. 
Outcomes of Interest
The outcome of interest was short-term PICC use, defined as 
PICCs removed within 5 days of insertion. Patients who expired 
with a PICC in situ were excluded. Secondary outcomes of in-
terest included PICC-related complications, categorized as 
major (eg, symptomatic VTE and CLABSI) or minor (eg, cath-
eter occlusion, superficial thrombosis, mechanical complica-
tions [kinking, coiling], exit site infection, and tip migration). 
Symptomatic VTE was defined as clinically diagnosed deep 
venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) not

present at the time of PICC placement and confirmed via im-
aging (ultrasound or venogram for DVT; computed tomogra-
phy scan, ventilation perfusion scan, or pulmonary angiogram 
for PE). CLABSI was defined in accordance with the CDC’s 
National Healthcare Safety Network criteria or according to 
Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations.21,22 
All minor PICC complications were defined in accordance with 
prior published definitions.4 
Statistical Analysis
Cases of short-term PICC use were identified and compared 
with patients with a PICC dwell time of 6 or more days by patient, 
provider, and device characteristics. The initial analyses for the 
associations of putative factors with short-term PICC use were 
performed using χ2 or Wilcoxon tests for categorical and con-
tinuous variables, respectively. Univariable mixed effect logistic 
regression models (with a random hospital-specific intercept) 
were then used to control for hospital-level clustering. Next, a 
mixed effects multivariable logistic regression model was used 
to identify factors associated with short-term PICC use. Variables 
with P 
≤ 
.25 were considered as candidate predictors for the fi-
nal multivariable model, which was chosen through a stepwise 
variable selection algorithm performed on 1000 bootstrapped 
data sets.23 Variables in the final model were retained based on 
their frequency of selection in the bootstrapped samples, sig-
nificance level, and contribution to the overall model likelihood. 
Results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with corresponding 
95% confidence intervals (CI). SAS for Windows (version 9.3, SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for analyses.
Ethical and Regulatory Oversight
The study was classified as “not regulated” by the Institutional 
Review Board at the University of Michigan (HUM00078730). 
RESULTS
Overall Characteristics of the Study Cohort
Between January 2014 and June 2016, data from 15,397 PICCs 
placed in 14,380 patients were available and included in this 
analysis. As shown in Table 1, the median age of the study co-
hort was 63.6 years; 51.5% were female and 73.6% were white. 
The median Charlson-Deyo score was 3 (interquartile range 
[IQR], 1-5). Most patients (63.2%) were admitted to teaching 
hospitals, over half were admitted to hospitals with ≥375 beds 
(52.3%), and almost all (98.1%) were in urban locations. At the 
time of PICC placement, 63.3% of patients were admitted to a 
general medicine ward and 28.4% were in an ICU. The median 
length of hospital stay for all PICC recipients was 8 days.
The median PICC dwell time for the entire cohort was 11 
days (IQR, 5-23 days; Table 1). With respect to device charac-
teristics, most devices (91.0%) were power-capable PICCs (eg, 
capable of being used for radiographic contrast dye injection), 
5-French or larger in diameter (64.6%), and multilumen (62.2%). 
The most common documented indication for PICC place-
ment was the delivery of IV antibiotics (35.5%), difficult ve-
nous access (20.1%), and medications requiring central access 
(10.6%). Vascular access nurses inserted most (67.1%) PICCs; 
interventional radiologists (19.6%) and advanced practice pro-
fessionals (10.8%) collectively placed a third of all devices.
Characteristics of Short-Term Peripherally Inserted 
Central Catheter Use
Of the 15,397 PICCs included, we identified 3902 PICCs 
(25.3%) with a dwell time of ≤5 days (median = 3 days; IQR, 
2-4 days). When compared to PICCs that were in place for 
longer durations, no significant differences in age or comor-
bidity scores were observed. Importantly, despite recommen-
dations to avoid PICCs in patients with moderate to severe 
chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] ≤ 59 
ml/min), 1292 (33.1%) short-term PICCs occurred in patients 
that met such criteria.
Among short-term PICCs, 3618 (92.7%) were power-capable 
devices, 2785 (71.4%) were 5-French, and 2813 (72.1%) were 
multilumen. Indications for the use of short-term PICCs dif-
fered from longer term devices in important ways (P <  .001). 
For example, the most common documented indication for 
short-term PICC use was difficult venous access (28.2%), while 
for long-term PICCs, it was antibiotic administration (39.8%). 
General internists and hospitalists were the most common at-
tending physicians for patients with short-term and long-term 
PICCs (65.1% and 65.5%, respectively [P = .73]). Also, the pro-
portion of critical care physicians responsible for patients with 
short versus long-term PICC use was similar (14.0% vs 15.0%, 
respectively [P = .123]). Of the short-term PICCs, 2583 (66.2%) 
were inserted by vascular access nurses, 795 (20.4%) by inter-
ventional radiologists, and 439 (11.3%) by advance practice 
professionals. Almost all of the PICCs placed ≤5 days (95.5%) 
were removed during hospitalization. 
The results of multivariable logistic regression assessing fac-
tors associated with short-term PICC use are summarized in 
Table 2. In the final multivariable model, short-term PICC use 
was significantly associated with teaching hospitals (OR, 1.25; 
95% CI, 1.04-1.52) or when the documented indication was dif-
ficult venous access (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.40-1.69). Additionally, 
multilumen PICCs (OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.39-1.69) were more of-
ten associated with short-term use than single lumen devices.

Complications Associated with Short-Term Peripher-
ally Inserted Central Catheter Use
PICC-related complications occurred in 18.5% (2848) of the to-
tal study cohort (Table 3). Although the overall rate of PICC 
complications with short-term use was substantially lower than 
long-term use (9.6% vs 21.5%; P < .001), adverse events were 
not infrequent and occurred in 374 patients with short-term 
PICCs. Furthermore, complication rates from short-term PICCs 
varied across hospitals (median = 7.9%; IQR, 4.0%-12.5%) and 
were lower in teaching versus nonteaching hospitals (8.5% vs 
12.1%; P < .001). The most common complication associat-
ed with short-term PICC use was catheter occlusion (n = 158, 
4.0%). However, major complications, including 99 (2.5%) VTE 
and 17 (0.4%) CLABSI events, also occurred. Complications 
were more frequent with multilumen compared to single lu-
men PICCs (10.6% vs 7.6%; P = .006). In particular, rates of cath-
eter occlusion (4.5% vs 2.9%; P = .020) and catheter tip migra-
tion (2.6% vs 1.3%; P = .014) were higher in multilumen devices 
placed for 5 or fewer days.
DISCUSSION
This large, multisite prospective cohort study is the first to ex-
amine patterns and predictors of short-term PICC use in hos-
pitalized adults. By examining clinically granular data derived 
from the medical records of patients across 52 hospitals, we 
found that short-term use was common, representing 25% of 
all PICCs placed. Almost all such PICCs were removed prior 
to discharge, suggesting that they were placed primarily to 
meet acute needs during hospitalization. Multivariable models 
indicated that patients with difficult venous access, multilumen 
devices, and teaching hospital settings were associated with 
short-term use. Given that (a) short term PICC use is not rec-
ommended by published evidence-based guidelines,12,13 (b) 
both major and minor complications were not uncommon de-
spite brief exposure, and (c) specific factors might be targeted 
to avoid such use, strategies to improve PICC decision-making 
in the hospital appear increasingly necessary.
In our study, difficult venous access was the most common 
documented indication for short-term PICC placement. For 
patients in whom an anticipated catheter dwell time of 5 days 
or less is expected, MAGIC recommends the consideration 
of midline or peripheral IV catheters placed under ultrasound 
guidance.12 A midline is a type of peripheral IV catheter that 
is about 7.5 cm to 25 cm in length and is typically inserted in 
the larger diameter veins of the upper extremity, such as the 
cephalic or basilic veins, with the tip terminating distal to the 
subclavian vein.7,12 While there is a paucity of information that 
directly compares PICCs to midlines, some data suggest a 
lower risk of bloodstream infection and thrombosis associat-
ed with the latter.24-26 For example, at one quaternary teaching 
hospital, house staff who are trained to insert midline catheters 
under ultrasound guidance in critically ill patients with difficult 
venous access reported no CLABSI and DVT events.26 
Interestingly, multilumen catheters were used twice as often

as single lumen catheters in patients with short-term PICCs. 
In these instances, the use of additional lumens is question-
able, as infusion of multiple incompatible fluids was not com-
monly listed as an indication prompting PICC use. Because 
multilumen PICCs are associated with higher risks of both VTE 
and CLABSI compared to single lumen devices, such use rep-
resents an important safety concern.27-29 Institutional efforts 
that not only limit the use of multilumen PICCs but also fun-
damentally define when use of a PICC is appropriate may sub-
stantially improve outcomes related to vascular access.28,30,31
We observed that short-term PICCs were more common in 
teaching compared to nonteaching hospitals. While the design 
of the present study precludes understanding the reasons for 
such a difference, some plausible theories include the presence 
of physician trainees who may not appreciate the risks of PICC 
use, diminishing peripheral IV access securement skills, and the 
lack of alternatives to PICC use. Educating trainees who most 
often order PICCs in teaching settings as to when they should 
or should not consider this device may represent an important 
quality improvement opportunity.32 Similarly, auditing and as-
sessing the clinical skills of those entrusted to place peripheral 
IVs might prove helpful.33,34 Finally, the introduction of a midline 
program, or similar programs that expand the scope of vascular 
access teams to place alternative devices, should be explored 
as a means to improve PICC use and patient safety.
Our study also found that a third of patients who received 
PICCs for 5 or fewer days had moderate to severe chronic kid-
ney disease. In these patients who may require renal replace-
ment therapy, prior PICC placement is among the strongest 
predictors of arteriovenous fistula failure.35,36 Therefore, even 
though national guidelines discourage the use of PICCs in 
these patients and recommend alternative routes of venous 
access,12,37,38 such practice is clearly not happening. Sys-
tem-based interventions that begin by identifying patients 
who require vein preservation (eg, those with a GFR < 45 ml/
min) and are therefore not appropriate for a PICC would be 
a welcomed first step in improving care for such patients.37,38
Our study has limitations. First, the observational nature of the 
study limits the ability to assess for causality or to account for the 
effects of unmeasured confounders. Second, while the use of 
medical records to collect granular data is valuable, differences 
in documentation patterns within and across hospitals, includ-
ing patterns of missing data, may produce a misclassification of 
covariates or outcomes. Third, while we found that higher rates 
of short-term PICC use were associated with teaching hospitals 
and patients with difficult venous access, we were unable to de-
termine the precise reasons for this practice trend. Qualitative 
or mixed-methods approaches to understand provider deci-
sion-making in these settings would be welcomed. 
Our study also has several strengths. First, to our knowl-
edge, this is the first study to systematically describe and 
evaluate patterns and predictors of short-term PICC use. The 
finding that PICCs placed for difficult venous access is a domi-
nant category of short-term placement confirms clinical suspi-
cions regarding inappropriate use and strengthens the need 
for pathways or protocols to manage such patients. Second, 
the inclusion of medical patients in diverse institutions offers 
not only real-world insights related to PICC use, but also offers 
findings that should be generalizable to other hospitals and 
health systems. Third, the use of a robust data collection strat-
egy that emphasized standardized data collection, dedicated 
trained abstractors, and random audits to ensure data quality 
strengthen the findings of this work. Finally, our findings high-
light an urgent need to develop policies related to PICC use, 
including limiting the use of multiple lumens and avoidance in 
patients with moderate to severe kidney disease.
In conclusion, short-term use of PICCs is prevalent and as-
sociated with key patient, provider, and device factors. Such 
use is also associated with complications, such as catheter 
occlusion, tip migration, VTE, and CLABSI. Limiting the use of 
multiple-lumen PICCs, enhancing education for when a PICC 
should be used, and defining strategies for patients with dif-
ficult access may help reduce inappropriate PICC use and 
improve patient safety. Future studies to examine implemen-
tation of such interventions would be welcomed.
