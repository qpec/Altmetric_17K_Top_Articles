BACKGROUND
Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)–infected patients who have tuberculosis reduces mortality among patients with 
low CD4 counts, but it increases the risk of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated im-
mune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).
METHODS
We conducted this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess 
whether prophylactic prednisone can safely reduce the incidence of paradoxical tuber-
culosis-associated IRIS in patients at high risk for the syndrome. We enrolled HIV-
infected patients who were initiating ART (and had not previously received ART), had 
started tuberculosis treatment within 30 days before initiating ART, and had a CD4 
count of 100 cells or fewer per microliter. Patients received either prednisone (at a dose 
of 40 mg per day for 14 days, then 20 mg per day for 14 days) or placebo. The pri-
mary end point was the development of tuberculosis-associated IRIS within 12 weeks 
after initiating ART, as adjudicated by an independent committee.
RESULTS
Among the 240 patients who were enrolled, the median age was 36 (interquartile 
range, 30 to 42), 60% were men, and 73% had microbiologically confirmed tubercu-
losis; the median CD4 count was 49 cells per microliter (interquartile range, 24 to 86), 
and the median HIV type 1 RNA viral load was 5.5 log10 copies per milliliter (inter-
quartile range, 5.2 to 5.9). A total of 120 patients were assigned to each group, and 18 
patients were lost to follow-up or withdrew. Tuberculosis-associated IRIS was diag-
nosed in 39 patients (32.5%) in the prednisone group and in 56 (46.7%) in the placebo 
group (relative risk, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.96; P 
= 
0.03). Open-
label glucocorticoids were prescribed to treat tuberculosis-associated IRIS in 16 pa-
tients (13.3%) in the prednisone group and in 34 (28.3%) in the placebo group (relative 
risk, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.81). There were five deaths in the prednisone group and 
four in the placebo group (P 
= 
1.00). Severe infections (acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome–defining illnesses or invasive bacterial infections) occurred in 11 patients 
in the prednisone group and in 18 patients in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.23). One case 
of Kaposi’s sarcoma occurred in the placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS
Prednisone treatment during the first 4 weeks after the initiation of ART for HIV 
infection resulted in a lower incidence of tuberculosis-associated IRIS than placebo, 
without evidence of an increased risk of severe infections or cancers. (Funded by the

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
I
n resource-limited countries, a sub-
stantial proportion of patients infected with 
the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
present for care with advanced immunosuppres-
sion and low CD4 counts,1 and tuberculosis is the 
most common opportunistic infection.2 Para-
doxical tuberculosis-associated immune recon-
stitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) — an 
immunopathologic reaction characterized by re-
current or new inflammatory features of tuber-
culosis that manifest shortly after the initiation 
of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients receiv-
ing antituberculosis treatment3 — occurs in 18% 
of patients (range, 4 to 54), according to a pooled 
estimate derived from 40 observational cohort 
studies.4 Features include recurrent symptoms, 
fever, lymphadenitis, and worsening pulmonary 
infiltrates on radiography. Low CD4 counts and 
a short interval between the start of antitubercu-
losis treatment and the start of ART increase the 
risk of tuberculosis-associated IRIS.4 Tuberculo-
sis-associated IRIS is associated with consider-
able morbidity, and 25% of patients with this 
syndrome are hospitalized.4
Clinical trials that evaluated the timing of 
ART in patients with tuberculosis showed that 
early initiation of ART (initiation approximately 
2 weeks after the start of antituberculosis treat-
ment) resulted in a higher survival rate than ART 
initiated approximately 8 weeks after the start of 
antituberculosis treatment in patients with CD4 
counts of 50 cells or fewer per microliter.5 These 
findings informed World Health Organization 
(WHO) guidelines, which emphasize accelerating 
ART initiation in patients with tuberculosis and 
low CD4 counts.6 However, despite the survival 
benefit, early initiation of ART more than dou-
bles the risk of tuberculosis-associated IRIS.5 No 
evidence-based strategy to prevent tuberculosis-
associated IRIS exists.
Studies that evaluated adjunctive glucocorti-
coids for the treatment of various forms of tuber-
culosis showed reduced mortality among patients 
with tuberculous meningitis and fewer complica-
tions related to tuberculous pericarditis.7,8 Studies 
involving HIV-infected patients showed that the 
use of adjunctive glucocorticoids to treat tuber-
culosis was associated with adverse events, par-
ticularly Kaposi’s sarcoma,9,10 but in these stud-
ies, most patients were not receiving ART when 
Kaposi’s sarcoma was diagnosed. We previously 
reported the results of a placebo-controlled trial 
that showed that administration of prednisone 
resulted in a shorter duration of hospitalization 
and faster alleviation of symptoms than placebo 
when used as treatment for paradoxical tubercu-
losis-associated IRIS.11 We hypothesized that a low 
dose of glucocorticoids to attenuate the aberrant 
inflammatory response that underlies tuberculo-
sis-associated IRIS during early ART3 would re-
duce the risk of this syndrome.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
We conducted a phase 3, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the ef-
ficacy and safety of prednisone for the preven-
tion of paradoxical tuberculosis-associated IRIS 
in high-risk patients starting ART. The methods 
have been published previously12 and are provided 
in the protocol and statistical analysis plan, avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
The protocol was approved by the University 
of Cape Town human research ethics commit-
tee, the Institute of Tropical Medicine institu-
tional review board, and the Antwerp University 
Hospital ethics committee. The trial was con-
ducted in accordance with International Confer-
ence on Harmonisation and South African Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of 
the Declaration of Helsinki. The authors vouch 
for the accuracy and completeness of the data 
and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. 
The University of Cape Town was responsible for 
the conduct of the trial and hired a consultant to 
monitor the trial. The funders had no role in the 
design of the trial; in the collection, analysis, or 
interpretation of the data; or in the writing of 
the manuscript. An independent data and safety 
monitoring board, which was appointed by the 
University of Cape Town, performed two planned 
reviews.
Trial Setting
The trial was conducted at the Site B HIV–TB 
clinic in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, South Africa, 
a government-run outpatient primary care clin-
ic. Khayelitsha is a township of approximately 
500,000 people; in 2015, 917 cases of tuberculo-
sis per 100,000 persons were reported in this 
township, and 60% of those patients were coin-
fected with HIV (Caldwell J, City of Cape Town 
Department of Health: personal communication).

Prednisone for Tuberculosis-Associated IRIS
Participants
We enrolled patients who were 18 years of age or 
older, were infected with HIV, had not previously 
received ART and were now initiating ART, had 
a CD4 count of 100 cells or fewer per microliter, 
had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis or 
a clinical diagnosis with symptomatic response 
to antituberculosis treatment, and had been 
receiving antituberculosis treatment for less than 
30 days before initiating ART. The inclusion 
criteria were designed to result in enrollment of 
a high-risk group, since the incidence of tuber-
culosis-associated IRIS is high among patients 
with a CD4 count of 100 cells or fewer per micro-
liter and among patients who start ART within 
30 days after the start of antituberculosis treat-
ment.4,13 Exclusion criteria were Kaposi’s sarcoma, 
pregnancy, neurologic or pericardial tuberculo-
sis, rifampin-resistant tuberculosis, hepatitis B 
infection, receipt of nonstandard antituberculo-
sis treatment (the standard intensive-phase treat-
ment was considered to be rifampin, isoniazid, 
pyrazinamide, and ethambutol), poor clinical 
response to antituberculosis treatment before the 
start of ART, uncontrolled diabetes, an alanine 
aminotransferase level of more than 200 IU per 
liter, an absolute neutrophil count of less than 
500 per cubic millimeter, and systemic glucocor-
ticoid use within the previous 7 days. Written 
informed consent was obtained for screening 
and again for enrollment.
Interventions and Randomization
The prednisone and identical-appearing placebo 
tablets were manufactured by the Gulf Drug 
Company (Durban, South Africa) and were reg-
istered in South Africa and paid for by the trial 
budget. Identical packages containing prednisone 
or placebo were prepared at an independent off-
site pharmacy and were sealed and numbered 
from 1 to 240. Participants were enrolled by the 
trial doctor, were assigned a trial number from 
1 to 240, sequentially, and received the corre-
sponding numbered package. Randomization was 
performed in a 1:1 ratio with a block size of 8; 
the randomization sequence was prepared by an 
independent statistician. Patients in the pred-
nisone group received 40 mg of prednisone (in 
5-mg tablets) per day for 14 days, followed by 
20 mg per day for 14 days, and those in the pla-
cebo group received the equivalent number of 
placebo tablets. The prednisone or placebo was 
started within 48 hours after the initiation of ART. 
Group assignments remained concealed from 
the staff and patients throughout the course of the 
trial.
Trial Procedures
Visits were scheduled at weeks 0 (when ART and 
the trial regimen were initiated), 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
Patients could return to the clinic for unsched-
uled visits if they had new or worsening symp-
toms. If tuberculosis-associated IRIS symptoms 
persisted at week 12, follow-up was extended so 
that the date on which the symptoms of the 
syndrome resolved could be ascertained.
During the course of this trial, results of a 
trial of prednisolone for the treatment of tuber-
culous pericarditis became available; the results 
showed a higher incidence of cancer among HIV-
infected patients in the prednisolone group than 
in the placebo group.9 On the basis of these re-
sults, the data and safety monitoring board for 
our trial advised that patients should be followed 
up with a visit to the clinic at 28 weeks and with 
a telephone call at 1 year to monitor for HIV-
related cancers. All other analyses were restricted 
to data obtained over 12 weeks.
When tuberculosis-associated IRIS was suspect-
ed, testing was performed (e.g., bacterial blood 
culturing and chest radiography) to exclude alter-
native causes of clinical deterioration. If tuber-
culosis-associated IRIS was diagnosed, the trial 
regimen could be stopped and open-label pred-
nisone could be started at a dose of 1.5 mg per 
kilogram of body weight per day if the episode 
was severe enough to warrant glucocorticoid 
therapy. The decision to treat with open-label 
glucocorticoids was made by the trial doctor, who 
remained unaware of the group assignment. De-
tails regarding ART, tuberculosis treatment, and 
cryptococcal antigen screening, as well as reasons 
for stopping the trial regimen, are provided in the 
Supplementary Methods section in the Supple-
mentary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.
End Points
The primary end point was the development of 
paradoxical tuberculosis-associated IRIS, deter-
mined according to the International Network 
for the Study of HIV-associated IRIS (INSHI) con-
sensus case definition, within 12 weeks after 
initiating ART.14 All adverse events that could 
possibly be attributed to paradoxical tuberculosis-

associated IRIS were adjudicated by a committee 
of three expert clinical investigators who were 
unaware of the group assignments and were not 
active at the trial clinic; the members of this 
committee decided by consensus whether INSHI 
criteria were met. Further details are provided in 
the Supplementary Appendix. The database was 
locked and data were unblinded after the final 
committee adjudication.
Secondary efficacy end points included the 
time to tuberculosis-associated IRIS; the duration 
of tuberculosis-associated IRIS; death (from any 
cause and attributed to tuberculosis-associated 
IRIS); hospitalization (for any cause and attrib-
uted to tuberculosis-associated IRIS); neurologic 
tuberculosis-associated IRIS; a composite end 
point of death, hospitalization, and hepatotoxic-
ity; and adverse events resulting in a switch or 
interruption of antituberculosis treatment or ART. 
Secondary safety end points were severe infections 
and cancers, serious adverse events, adverse drug 
reactions, and grades 1 through 4 adverse events.
Statistical Analysis
Assuming that there would be a 35% incidence 
of tuberculosis-associated IRIS in the placebo 
group (approximating the 33% incidence in the 
early ART group in the Cambodian Early versus 
Late Introduction of Antiretrovirals [CAMELIA] 
trial15) and 50% fewer cases in the prednisone 
group than in the placebo group, we calculated 
that 110 patients would need to be enrolled in 
each group to provide 80% power to test for the 
difference between the groups in the incidence 
of tuberculosis-associated IRIS, at a two-sided 
significance level of 5%. Assuming a 10% loss to 
follow-up, we planned to enroll a total of 240 
patients.
The statistical analysis plan was finalized be-
fore the database was locked and unblinded. 
Analyses of the primary end point and the sec-
ondary efficacy end points used the intention-
to-treat approach; safety analyses used the per-
protocol approach. The analysis of the primary 
end point was performed with the use of the chi-
square test. Secondary end points were analyzed 
with the use of chi-square, Fisher’s exact, or 
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, as appropriate. The 
duration of hospital stay was compared between 
the groups with the use of a zero-inflated Poisson 
model. In the comparison of the time from the 
initiation of ART to the development of tubercu-
losis-associated IRIS, death and loss to follow-
up were considered to be competing risks, and a 
cause-specific hazard ratio was estimated, to-
gether with a 95% confidence interval. Cumula-
tive incidence curves were plotted according to 
group.16 Subgroup analyses were prespecified. 
Adverse events were coded according to the Medi-
cal Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 19.1. 
All P values were two-sided, and P values of less 
than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical 
significance. Analyses of secondary efficacy end 
points were not adjusted for multiple compari-
sons and therefore relative risks are reported with 
95% confidence intervals, without P values. The 
95% confidence intervals are not adjusted for mul-
tiple comparisons and may not be reproducible.
Results
Trial Population
From August 2013 through February 2016, a total 
of 321 adult patients were screened, and 240 were 
randomly assigned to receive prednisone (120 pa-
tients) or placebo (120 patients). The most fre-
quent reasons for exclusion were hepatitis B in-
fection and previous receipt of ART (Fig. 1). One 
patient in each group did not receive the as-
signed regimen. Therefore, 240 patients consti-
tuted the intention-to-treat population, and 238 
made up the per-protocol population. During 12 
weeks of follow-up, 17 patients were lost to fol-
low-up (although 8 of these patients returned to 
the trial clinic after 12 weeks), 1 withdrew, and 
9 died. These outcomes occurred in similar num-
bers in the two groups.
The trial regimen was started on the same 
day that ART was started in 231 patients (4 pa-
tients started within 3 days before the start of 
ART, and 3 patients started 1 day after the start 
of ART). Of the 238 patients in the per-protocol 
population, 66 (27.7%) stopped the trial regimen 
early; the most common reasons were prescrip-
tion of open-label glucocorticoids to treat tuber-
culosis-associated IRIS (36 patients), diagnosis of 
severe infection (8 patients), discontinuation of the 
regimen at the time of hospital admission be-
cause the trial medication was left at home or 
owing to a misunderstanding (7 patients), and 
poor adherence to the trial regimen (5 patients) 
(Table S13 in the Supplementary Appendix). Dur-

Prednisone for Tuberculosis-Associated IRIS
ing the trial, the ethics committee requested that 
the data be unblinded for 1 patient who died. 
Three patients (2 in the prednisone group and 
1 in the placebo group) received a diagnosis of 
rifampin-resistant tuberculosis after trial entry 
and were switched to treatment for drug-resistant 
tuberculosis.
The baseline characteristics were balanced 
across the two groups (Table 1). The median age 
was 36 (interquartile range, 30 to 42), 60% were 
men, and 73% had microbiologically confirmed 
tuberculosis; the median CD4 count was 49 cells 
per microliter (interquartile range, 24 to 86), and 
the median HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA viral load 
was 5.5 log10 copies per milliliter (interquartile 
range, 5.2 to 5.9). Patients had received anti-
tuberculosis treatment for a median of 17 days 
before starting ART. The ART regimen in 233 of 
the 240 patients (97.1%) was tenofovir, emtricita-
bine (or lamivudine), and efavirenz.
Primary End Point
A total of 39 of 120 patients (32.5%) in the pred-
nisone group and 56 of 120 patients (46.7%) in 
the placebo group received a diagnosis of para-
doxical tuberculosis-associated IRIS (relative risk, 
0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.96; 
P 
= 
0.03) (Fig. 2A). The absolute difference between 
the groups in the incidence of tuberculosis-asso-
ciated IRIS was 14.2 percentage points (95% CI, 
1.9 to 26.4). The estimates of relative risk associ-
ated with prednisone in prespecified subgroups 
were similar to the overall estimate for the total 
trial population, but for most subgroups this 
difference was not significant (Table 2).
Among patients in the prednisone group who 
received a diagnosis of tuberculosis-associated 
IRIS, 10 had lymph-node involvement or abscess 
formation, 15 had new or worsening features on 
radiography, and 2 had new or worsening sero-
sitis. Fourteen patients met the INSHI criteria on

the basis of two or three minor criteria alone.14 
In the placebo group, 23 patients had lymph-node 
involvement or abscess formation, 26 had new or 
worsening features on radiography, 2 had new 
or worsening serositis, and 12 patients met the 
INSHI criteria on the basis of two or three minor 
criteria alone. No cases of neurologic tuberculo-
sis-associated IRIS were diagnosed.
Secondary Efficacy End Points
The cumulative incidence of tuberculosis-associ-
ated IRIS over 84 days was lower in the predni-
sone group than in the placebo group (hazard 
ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.92) (Fig. 2B). Among 
the 95 patients who received a diagnosis of tuber-
culosis-associated IRIS, the median time to the 
onset of symptoms related to the syndrome was 
similar in the two groups (10 days [interquartile 
range, 5 to 13] in the prednisone group and 8 days 
[interquartile range, 4 to 12] in the placebo 
group).
Fewer patients in the prednisone group than 
in the placebo group met at least one major INSHI 
criterion (relative risk, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.87) 
(Table 3). Fewer patients in the prednisone group 
than in the placebo group were treated for tuber-
culosis-associated IRIS with open-label glucocor-
ticoids (relative risk, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.81). 
When the analysis was restricted to the 95 pa-
tients who received a diagnosis of tuberculosis-
associated IRIS, 16 of 39 (41.0%) in the predni-
sone group and 34 of 56 (60.7%) in the placebo 
group received treatment with open-label gluco-
corticoids (relative risk, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.44 to 
1.04) (Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
During the 12 weeks of follow-up, there were 
five deaths in the prednisone group and four in 
the placebo group (P 
= 
1.00); one death was attrib-

Prednisone for Tuberculosis-Associated IRIS
uted to tuberculosis-associated IRIS (Table S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Fewer patients in 
the prednisone group than in the placebo group 
were hospitalized (17 vs. 27), but the difference 
was not significant. In a zero-inflated Poisson 
model, which included all patients, the duration 
of hospital stay was shorter in the prednisone 
group than in the placebo group. Fewer patients 
in the prednisone group than in the placebo 
group required a switch or interruption of ART 
or antituberculosis treatment owing to adverse 
events, but the difference was not significant; 37

Figure 2. Cumulative Incidence of Paradoxical TB-Associated Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS).
Panel A shows the cumulative incidence of the primary end point of paradoxical TB-associated IRIS at 12 weeks. If paradoxical TB-asso-
ciated IRIS had not developed before a patient died, withdrew, or was lost to follow-up, the patient was considered not to have had the 
syndrome. Panel B shows the cumulative incidence of TB-associated IRIS over 84 days. Diagnosis of TB-associated IRIS was determined 
according to the International Network for the Study of HIV-associated IRIS criteria.14 Day 0 is the day ART was initiated.

Sustained TB-associated IRIS was defined as a duration of more than 14 days, the need for open-label glucocorticoid treatment, or both. 
For the duration of TB-associated IRIS, we excluded three participants, all of whom were receiving glucocorticoid treatment: two partici-
pants with ongoing TB-associated IRIS who died and one participant with ongoing TB-associated IRIS who was lost to follow-up.

§ 
 
Severe infections were considered to be acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)–defining illnesses or invasive bacterial infections; 
33 severe infections occurred among 29 participants: cryptococcal meningitis in 3 (1 in the prednisone group and 2 in the placebo group), 
esophageal candidiasis in 10 (4 in the prednisone group and 6 in the placebo group), sepsis in 7 (4 in the prednisone group and 3 in the 
placebo group), pneumonia in 7 (2 in the prednisone group and 5 in the placebo group), pyelonephritis in 1 patient in the placebo group, 
Clostridium difficile colitis in 3 patients in the placebo group, and dysentery in 2 (1 in the prednisone group and 1 in the placebo group).
¶  
Adverse events of grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 were defined according to the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric 
Adverse Events, version 1.0. In the prednisone group, there were 517 clinical events of grade 1 severity, 167 events of grade 2 severity, 66 
events of grade 3 severity, and 10 events of grade 4 severity. In the placebo group, there were 660 clinical events of grade 1 severity, 218 
events of grade 2 severity, 112 events of grade 3 severity, and 12 events of grade 4 severity.
‖ 
 
Serious adverse events were defined according to International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice defini-
tions. In the prednisone group, there were 55 serious adverse events among 24 patients; in the placebo group, there were 56 serious ad-
verse events among 30 patients.
**  
Adverse drug reactions were defined as adverse events determined by the trial doctor to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the 
trial regimen but not to open-label prednisone. A total of 45 probable or possible adverse drug reactions were reported among 43 pa-
tients. None of these were categorized as serious adverse events.

Prednisone for Tuberculosis-Associated IRIS
Secondary Safety End Points
Fewer patients in the prednisone group than in 
the placebo group had clinical adverse events of 
grade 3, but there was no significant difference 
in grade 4 events. There were also no significant 
differences between the groups in grade 3 or 4 
laboratory adverse events. A total of 33 severe 
infections (defined as new acquired immunode-
ficiency syndrome [AIDS]–defining illnesses or 
invasive bacterial infections) were diagnosed in 
29 patients: 11 (9.2%) in the prednisone group 
and 18 (15.1%) in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.23). 
There was no significant between-group differ-
ence in prespecified adverse events related to 
glucocorticoid treatment (18 events in the predni-
sone group and 23 in the placebo group). There 
was no significant difference between the groups 
in CD4 cell count or HIV-1 RNA suppression at 
week 12.
Vital status at 1 year was available for 239 
patients: 18 had died (8 in the prednisone group 
and 10 in the placebo group). Status with respect 
to cancer was ascertained for 220 patients at 1 year. 
One case of Kaposi’s sarcoma was diagnosed: 
the patient (who was in the placebo group) had 
received open-label prednisone starting at week 2 
to treat presumed tuberculosis-associated IRIS 
and then discontinued ART at week 20; the pa-
tient returned to the trial clinic at week 28 with 
a Kaposi’s sarcoma lesion that resolved after re-
initiation of ART. Additional information on sec-
ondary efficacy end points, adverse events, and 
other safety variables is provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Discussion
Prophylactic prednisone during the first 4 weeks 
after the initiation of ART in adult patients at 
high risk for tuberculosis-associated IRIS resulted 
in a 30% lower incidence of tuberculosis-associ-
ated IRIS than placebo. Prednisone use was not 
associated with an excess risk of severe infec-
tions, cancers, or adverse events. Prednisone 
might exert its effect by suppressing the symptoms 
of only mild cases of tuberculosis-associated 
IRIS, but our findings suggest that this was not 
the case. We found that prescription of open-
label glucocorticoids, which are generally pre-
scribed to treat patients with more severe tuber-
culosis-associated IRIS, was 53% less in the 
prednisone group than in the placebo group, 
and a significantly smaller proportion of patients 
in the prednisone group than in the placebo group 
met at least one major INSHI criterion.
The development of tuberculosis-associated 
IRIS in 47% of the patients in the placebo group 
in our trial is higher than the pooled estimate of 
18% from a meta-analysis of 40 cohort studies4; 
our finding reflects our enrollment of patients at 
high risk for tuberculosis-associated IRIS who 
had low CD4 counts and short intervals between 
starting antituberculosis treatment and starting 
ART. A study in India involving patients with a 
similar high-risk profile showed an incidence of 
tuberculosis-associated IRIS of 54%.17 In one 
previous trial of a prophylactic strategy for IRIS, 
the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc was evaluated 
for prevention of all causes of IRIS, but the trial 
did not show a lower incidence of IRIS in the 
group that received maraviroc than in the group 
that received placebo.18
The dose of prednisone used in our trial was 
relatively low, considering that rifampin reduces 
plasma exposure to prednisone (clearance is in-
creased 45% by rifampin).19 In several rheumato-
logic conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), low-
dose glucocorticoids are effective,20-22 which 
indicates that there is a substantial antiinflam-
matory effect. Lower doses of glucocorticoids 
may cause less harm than higher doses, which 
is an important consideration in the prevention 
of tuberculosis-associated IRIS.
Kaposi’s sarcoma was diagnosed in one pa-
tient in the placebo group who received open-
label prednisone and in whom ART was inter-
rupted. By contrast, in the Investigation of the 
Management of Pericarditis (IMPI) trial, prednis-
olone for the treatment of tuberculous pericardi-
tis resulted in a significant excess risk of HIV-
related cancers.9 The differences between our 
trial and the IMPI trial were that we used a 
lower dose of prednisone for a shorter duration, 
and all the patients in our trial started ART at 
the same time that they started the trial regimen. 
In the IMPI trial, 22% of HIV-positive patients were 
receiving ART at entry, and 72% by 6 months.9 
Our findings show that short-course glucocorti-
coids can be used safely in patients receiving ART.
We found a trend toward fewer interruptions 
of ART or antituberculosis treatment in the pred-
nisone group than in the placebo group. This 
finding is consistent with two previous observa-
tions from placebo-controlled trials of adjunctive 
glucocorticoids: in one trial, there were fewer 
events of drug-induced liver injury in the group

assigned to dexamethasone for the treatment of 
tuberculous meningitis than in the group as-
signed to placebo23; in another trial, in which 
methylprednisolone was assessed for the treat-
ment of AIDS-related pneumocystis pneumonia, 
fewer participants in the methylprednisolone 
group than in the placebo group stopped trime-
thoprim-sulfamethoxazole owing to hypersensi-
tivity.24 Reducing the risk of adverse drug reac-
tions, which are more frequent in HIV-infected 
patients,25 is another potential benefit of gluco-
corticoids. The lower incidence of grade 3 clinical 
adverse events in the prednisone group than in 
the placebo group may reflect that these patients 
had fewer symptoms related to tuberculosis-
associated IRIS and fewer adverse drug reactions 
to ART and antituberculosis treatment.
Our trial has several limitations. First, our 
findings may not be generalizable to inpatients; 
however, most patients with HIV-associated tuber-
culosis are ambulatory. Our trial site was a busy 
government-run clinic in which guidelines for 
HIV and tuberculosis management are aligned 
with WHO guidelines. Second, our trial was not 
sufficiently powered to detect mortality differ-
ences. Third, a quarter of our patients had clini-
cally diagnosed tuberculosis, and they may have 
had other opportunistic diseases. However, this 
is unlikely, since we enrolled only patients with 
a clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis who had a 
response to antituberculosis treatment. Fourth, 
the 30% lower incidence of tuberculosis-associ-
ated IRIS in the prednisone group than in the 
placebo group was smaller than the 50% pre-
dicted in our sample-size calculation, but the 
difference was statistically significant because 
the event rate was higher than predicted.
In conclusion, we found that among adult 
HIV-infected patients receiving antituberculosis 
treatment who were at high risk for tuberculosis-
associated IRIS, the incidence of tuberculosis-
associated IRIS was lower among those who re-
ceived a 4-week course of prednisone, prescribed 
when ART was started, than among those who 
received placebo. Future studies could evaluate 
higher doses of prednisone or target prednisone 
prophylaxis in patients identified as having a 
high risk of tuberculosis-associated IRIS on the 
basis of immune biomarkers.17
