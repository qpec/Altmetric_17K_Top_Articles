BACKGROUND. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is an obesity-driven condition of pandemic proportions 
that increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Pathophysiological 
mechanisms are poorly understood, though inflammation has been implicated in MetS 
pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of galantamine, a centrally acting 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with antiinflammatory properties, on markers of inflammation 
implicated in insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk, and other metabolic and cardiovascular 
indices in subjects with MetS.
METHODS. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, subjects with MetS (30 per 
group) received oral galantamine 8 mg daily for 4 weeks, followed by 16 mg daily for 8 weeks or 
placebo. The primary outcome was inflammation assessed through plasma levels of cytokines 
and adipokines associated with MetS. Secondary endpoints included body weight, fat tissue 
depots, plasma glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), 
cholesterol (total, HDL, LDL), triglycerides, BP
, heart rate, and heart rate variability (HRV).
RESULTS. Galantamine resulted in lower plasma levels of proinflammatory molecules TNF (–2.57 
pg/ml [95% CI –4.96 to –0.19]; P = 0.035) and leptin (–12.02 ng/ml [95% CI –17.71 to –6.33]; P < 
0.0001), and higher levels of the antiinflammatory molecules adiponectin (2.71 μg/ml [95% CI 
1.93 to 3.49]; P < 0.0001) and IL-10 (1.32 pg/ml, [95% CI 0.29 to 2.38]; P = 0.002) as compared with 
placebo. Galantamine also significantly lowered plasma insulin and HOMA-IR values, and altered 
HRV.
CONCLUSION. Low-dose galantamine alleviates inflammation and insulin resistance in MetS 
subjects. These findings support further study of galantamine in MetS therapy.

Introduction
Central (abdominal) obesity, elevated fast-
ing glucose, dyslipidemia (abnormally high 
triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol), 
and high BP define metabolic syndrome 
(MetS), a disorder of pandemic proportions 
(1–4). This constellation of risk factors with 
metabolic origin is associated with a sub-
stantially increased risk of developing type 
2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and oth-
er life-threatening and debilitating disorders 
to a higher degree than any of these condi-
tions individually (2, 3, 5). As summarized 
in 2008, the prevalence of this complex 
disorder is between 20% and 30% of the 
adult population in the US and Canada, 
and many countries in Europe, Asia, and 
Latin America (4). Despite the critical need 
for treating MetS, no specific therapeutic 
approaches are currently available. Exercise 
and diet can potentially alleviate MetS, but 
there are numerous obstacles that preclude 
implementation of lifestyle modifications 
(3, 6). Pharmacological options are mostly 
directed to treating individual conditions 
(or risk factors) clustering in MetS (3, 6). 
As previously noted, in addition to develop-
ing improved treatments for the individual 
components of MetS, it may be more effi-
cient to also target major underlying patho-
physiological events (4). Preclinical and 
clinical studies have identified low-grade chronic inflammation, manifested by increased plasma levels of 
TNF and other proinflammatory cytokines and altered levels of adipokines (such as leptin and adiponectin), 
and insulin resistance, as important components of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MetS (3, 6). 
Autonomic nervous system imbalance with increased indices of sympathetic activity and decreased vagus 
nerve activity has also been observed in MetS (7–11). A positive correlation between this autonomic dysfunc-
tion and the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease has been established (12–14). Accord-
ingly, lowering chronic inflammation, alleviating insulin resistance, and improving autonomic function have 
been proposed as therapeutic options (11, 15–17).
Vagus nerve activity has been implicated in the regulation of inflammation through a brain-inte-
grated physiological mechanism termed the inflammatory reflex (18). Vagus nerve stimulation and 
activation of the inflammatory reflex have been successfully explored in animal and clinical stud-
ies of disorders characterized by inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and autonomic dysfunction, 
including sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis (16, 19–21). The inflamma-
tory reflex is also activated by galantamine, a centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor approved 
for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (22). Galantamine suppresses serum TNF and 
other proinflammatory cytokine levels and improves survival in lethal endotoxin-induced inflamma-
tion (23). Galantamine also lowers indices of colonic inflammation and alleviates disease severity in 
experimental inflammatory bowel disease (24). These antiinflammatory effects of galantamine are 
mediated through brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptor signaling and vagus nerve activity (23, 24). 
Galantamine administration to mice with high-fat diet–induced obesity and MetS significantly lowers 
plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines, and alleviates insulin resistance and other 
metabolic derangements (25). Accordingly, we reasoned that galantamine may be useful in alleviating 
inflammation in patients with MetS.

The primary aim of this proof-of-concept study was to investigate the effect of a 12-week course of 
galantamine on plasma levels of TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, leptin, and adiponectin; cytokines and adipo-
kines associated with the inflammatory state implicated in insulin resistance and cardio-metabolic derange-
ments in patients with MetS. In addition, we examined effects of the drug on insulin resistance, autonomic 
regulation of heart function, and metabolic and cardiovascular indices.

15 females) and placebo (15 males and 15 females). The trial profile is depicted in Figure 1. All enrolled 
patients completed the trial and none were lost to follow-up. Baseline characteristics of the study popula-
tion are shown in Table 1. The average age was 42.7 years and 40.8 years for the placebo and the galan-
tamine groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics, including anthropometric indices, fat tissue depots, 
metabolic markers, BP, heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV) components, and cytokines and adipokines 
did not differ between the 2 groups (Table 1).
Effects of  galantamine on primary outcomes. The effects of galantamine treatment on the primary out-
come measures, plasma cytokines and adipokines, are presented in Table 2. At the end of the 12-week 
treatment period, plasma levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF decreased with galantamine 
treatment and this change was statistically significant compared with placebo (–2.57 pg/ml [95% CI 
–4.96 to –0.19]; P = 0.035). Galantamine also decreased plasma levels of IL-1β, but this effect did not 
reach statistical significance compared with placebo (–1.88 pg/ml [95% CI –3.28 to –0.7]; P = 0.078). 
Galantamine had no significant effect on the plasma levels of IL-6 (0.17 pg/ml [95% CI –2.18 to 
3.08]; P = 0.412) compared with placebo. Conversely, galantamine treatment resulted in significantly 
increased plasma levels of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 (1.32 pg/ml [95% CI 0.29 to 2.38]; P 
= 0.002) compared with placebo. It should be noted that IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 levels included values 
below the lower detectable limits of the assays. The frequency of these values below the lower detect-
able limit is shown in Table 3. These values were evenly distributed between groups and therefore 
should not have disproportionately affected the analyses.
Plasma adipokine levels also were altered by galantamine treatment. Plasma levels of leptin, a mol-
ecule with proinflammatory properties, were significantly decreased in patients taking galantamine (–12.02 
ng/ml [95% CI –17.71 to –6.33]; P < 0.0001) compared with those taking placebo. In contrast, plasma 
levels of adiponectin, an antiinflammatory mediator, were significantly increased in the galantamine group 
(2.71 μg/ml [95% CI 1.93 to 3.49]; P < 0.0001) compared with the placebo group. Accordingly, the leptin/
adiponectin ratio was significantly decreased with galantamine treatment (–2.67 [95% CI –3.46 to –1.87]; P 
< 0.0001) compared with placebo (Table 2).

Effects of  galantamine on secondary outcomes. Galantamine effects on secondary outcome measures are 
shown in Table 4. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was significantly lower 
in patients receiving galantamine (log scale 0.55 [95% CI 0.36 to 0.85]; P = 0.008) compared with those on 
placebo. This drug effect was related to a significant decrease in insulin levels in the galantamine group (log 
scale 0.57 mU/l [95% CI 0.37 to 0.87]; P = 0.010) compared with the placebo group. Glucose levels were 
also decreased in the galantamine group (–5.57 mg/dl [95% CI –11.77 to 0.63]; P = 0.077), but this drug 
effect was not statistically significant. HRV frequency components reflecting autonomic modulation of the 
cardiac function were also altered by galantamine treatment (Table 4). The low frequency (LF) power (ms2) 
of HRV in the galantamine group was significantly decreased, compared with the placebo group (log scale 
0.48 ms2 [95% CI 0.29 to 0.80]; P = 0.005). This alteration was associated with significantly decreased LF 
(normalized units [nu]) of HRV and a corresponding increase in high frequency (HF) (nu) of HRV
, com-
pared with placebo. Accordingly, a lower LF/HF ratio was determined in the galantamine arm (log scale 
0.50 nu [95% CI 0.35 to 0.71]; P < 0.0001). Fat tissue depots in the galantamine and placebo groups did not 
differ significantly: intra-abdominal fat tissue (–1.98 cm2 [95% CI –10.25 to 6.29]; P = 0.633); subcutane-
ous abdominal fat tissue (–0.29 cm2 [95% CI –16.32 to 15.74]; P = 0.971); and epicardial fat tissue (–14.99 
ml [95% CI –33.64 to 3.65]; P = 0.113) (Table 4). The spleen, an important organ target of the inflamma-
tory reflex (16) activated by galantamine (23, 24) was visualized while performing intra-abdominal fat 
tissue assessment. Thus, potential alterations in galantamine effects as a result of prior splenectomy were 
excluded. In parallel with the lack of effect of galantamine on fat depots, no significant differences between 
the groups were determined in body weight (0.07 kg [95% CI –1.26 to 1.39]; P =0.918), BMI (0.02 kg/m2 
[95% CI –0.46 to 0.50]; P = 0.949), and waist circumference (–0.87 cm [95% CI –2.35 to 0.61]; P = 0.245). 
HDL cholesterol levels were nonsignificantly increased (0.88 mg/dl [95% CI –2.19 to 3.95]; P = 0.568) 
and LDL cholesterol (–1.73 mg/dl [95% CI –15.78 to 12.31]; P = 0.805), triglyceride (–8.2 mg/dl [95% CI 
–38.81 to 22.42]; P = 0.593), and total cholesterol levels (–1.99 mg/dl [95% CI –15.28 to 11.29]; P = 0.764) 
nonsignificantly decreased with galantamine treatment compared with placebo (Table 4). We used distinc-
tive and complementary methods to determine arterial BP, considering its importance in physiology and 
pathophysiological conditions, including MetS. Evaluation of office BP registration, a common method 
used for clinical assessment, showed no significant effect of galantamine on the systolic BP (SBP) (2.47 
mmHg [95% CI –4.23 to 9.16]; P = 0.464) and diastolic BP (DBP) (1.70 mmHg [95% CI –4.0 to 7.4]; P = 
0.553) compared with placebo. Furthermore, ambulatory BP (ABP) monitoring (ABPM) revealed no sig-
nificant differences in the awake SBP (1.20 mmHg [95% CI –3.54 to 5.94]; P = 0.614), awake DBP (–1.07 
mmHg [95% CI –4.63 to 2.50]; P = 0.551), sleep SBP (2.63 mmHg [95% CI –3.38 to 8.65]; P = 0.551), 
and sleep DBP (0.43 mmHg [95% CI –4.07 to 4.94]; P = 0.848) between the groups. Galantamine did not 
significantly alter heart rate (1.74 bpm [95% CI –2.47 to 5.95]; P = 0.411) compared with placebo (Table 4).
Adverse effects. Galantamine treatment was well tolerated; only 3 adverse events were reported in both 
groups, and were categorized as minor based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE 4.03, 2010): mild (grade 1) or moderate intensity (grade 2). These adverse effects were of short 
duration and no hospitalization was necessary. In the placebo group one subject had a single episode of 
nausea and diarrhea (grade 1) and another subject had a skin infection (grade 2). Of note, the skin infec-
tion was mild, occurred 7 weeks prior to the posttreatment assessment, and was resolved within 3 days. 
Therefore, it would not have impacted the endpoints, including cytokine levels. In the galantamine group 
one subject complained of dizziness (grade 1).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this double-blind placebo-controlled study is the first clinical trial to assess the effects 
of galantamine, a clinically approved drug for Alzheimer’s disease, in patients with MetS. The results of 
the study demonstrate that within 12 weeks galantamine inhibited inflammation and insulin resistance in 
association with alterations in autonomic tone.
Weight gain and abdominal obesity have been proposed as the main driving forces of metabolic dys-
regulation, inflammation, and insulin resistance in MetS (3, 6). This notion is supported by observations that 
weight loss alleviates indices of these derangements (6, 26). Interestingly, weight loss does not always result 
in significant and uniform alleviation of the inflammatory state. For instance, in contrast to other mark-
ers, increased plasma TNF levels and decreased adiponectin levels in patients with MetS may not change 
after weight loss (26). In addition to numerous obstacles in achieving and sustaining weight loss, these find-

ings suggest the need of targeted interventions in MetS to aggressively manage the inflammatory state and 
lower the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. To evaluate the impact of galantamine on the 
inflammatory state in MetS, we examined the effect of the drug on circulating levels of inflammatory mol-
ecules, including cytokines and adipokines, with a recognized role in insulin resistance and cardiovascular

risk. TNF and IL-1β are prototypical proinflammatory cytokines, major contributors to insulin resistance 
(6, 16, 17). TNF has been shown to induce insulin resistance, a discovery that directly linked inflammation 
to insulin resistance (27, 28). TNF also suppresses the expression of adiponectin (an important adipokine 
with antiinflammatory, insulin-sensitizing, and antiatherogenic properties) in human adipocytes (29). IL-1β 
impairs insulin signaling and action in adipocytes (30). Both TNF and IL-1β are potential therapeutic targets 
in MetS and type 2 diabetes (15, 16, 31). IL-6 has also been implicated in insulin resistance and identified as 
a procoagulant factor (16, 17). The prototypical antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 has been associated with 
insulin-sensitizing effects (17, 32). To our knowledge, despite the documented involvement of these pro- and 
antiinflammatory cytokines in MetS, thorough evaluation of their circulating levels in subjects with MetS has 
not been previously performed. Our results indicate that while plasma TNF levels in subjects with MetS can 
be determined, plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 remain relatively low (below the lower detectable limit 
of a sensitive assay) in some individuals. Galantamine treatment had selective effects on circulating cytokine 
levels, manifested by reduced plasma TNF, no significant alterations in plasma IL-1β and IL-6, and increased 
plasma IL-10 as compared with placebo. Understandably, the drug effects on plasma IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 
should be interpreted in the context of the low circulating levels of these cytokines in MetS as noted above. 
The adipokine adiponectin is an antiinflammatory molecule, which also suppresses macrophage activation 
and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF (29, 33). Adiponectin whose levels are typi-
cally decreased in MetS has insulin-sensitizing and antiatherogenic functions (6, 16, 29, 33). Increased leptin 
levels (hyperleptinemia) in obesity and MetS are associated with proinflammatory effects (6, 16, 33) and are 
linked with insulin resistance (16, 33), risk for thrombotic complications in obese individuals (34), and arte-
rial distensibility (35). The leptin/adiponectin ratio is proposed as an indicator of insulin-resistant states and 
a preferential atherogenic marker as compared with leptin and adiponectin alone. Galantamine increased 
plasma adiponectin, decreased plasma leptin and the leptin/adiponectin ratio, and lowered insulin resistance 
(HOMA-IR). The observed lower plasma insulin levels in the galantamine group is of particular interest, 
because compensatory insulinemia has been identified as an independent predictor of ischemic heart disease 
(36) and type 2 diabetes (37) in individuals with MetS.
Previously, treating mice with obesity and MetS with a relatively high galantamine dose has been shown 
to significantly alleviate inflammation and insulin resistance in parallel with a moderate weight loss and 
reduced abdominal fat tissue depots (25). Therefore, the antiinflammatory effects of galantamine could, at 
least partially, be related to a weight loss effect of the drug in the animal model. In contrast to these preclinical 
observations, our findings here indicate antiinflammatory and insulin resistance–alleviating effects of low-
dose galantamine treatment, which are not associated with significant weight loss, BMI, and fat tissue depot 
reduction in this relatively short 12-week treatment period. Galantamine antiinflammatory effects have been 
previously linked to activation of the vagus nerve–based inflammatory reflex (16, 23, 24). Stimulation of 
vagus nerve activity and galantamine treatment have been shown to result in alleviation of inflammation in 
preclinical settings of diseases characterized with metabolic derangement and autonomic dysfunction, includ-
ing inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis (16, 38, 39). In addition to vagus nerve cholinergic signaling, 
sympathetic catecholaminergic signals regulate inflammation (16, 21). Obesity and MetS are associated with 
autonomic dysfunction, and inhibiting sympathetic or enhancing vagus nerve activity have been suggested 
as therapeutic approaches (11, 16). HRV analysis is a noninvasive measure that provides information related 
to autonomic regulation and relatively limited insight into the balance between sympathetic and vagus nerve 
activity (40). Galantamine treatment altered the HRV frequency components and significantly lowered LF/
HF ratios. These findings suggest that potential mechanisms of the antiinflammatory and insulin resistance–
alleviating effects of galantamine may be related to its effects on autonomic regulation.
The highest galantamine dose clinically approved for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is 24 mg 
daily. A drug dose of 32 mg daily has also been tested in clinical trials with Alzheimer’s disease patients 
(22). In the present study, galantamine was dosed at 16 mg daily after a dose escalation in individuals 
with much higher BMIs as compared with the typical Alzheimer’s disease patient, and the short treatment 
period likely precluded significant changes in weight and abdominal circumference. Therefore, it may not 
be surprising that no significant drug effects on body weight, BMI, and fat tissue depots were found in our 
short study. In addition, no significant effects of galantamine on several metabolic markers, including HDL 
cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were determined. No significant altera-
tions in heart rate and in office BP and ABP were observed as a result of galantamine treatment, which is

consistent with a previous report in Alzheimer’s disease patients (41). Intriguingly, treatments with galan-
tamine and other centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitors of Alzheimer’s disease patients have been 
previously found to decrease the risk of myocardial infarction and death (42).
While Alzheimer’s disease is a disorder of the elderly, MetS has no age boundaries and affects even 
children (6, 43). Autonomic nervous system dysfunction with decreased HF and increased LF/HF ratio of 
HRV have been reported in adolescents with MetS, in addition to metabolic derangements (43). Galantamine 
and other centrally acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been clinically used in pediatric populations, 
for instance in children with autism spectrum disorder (44), where galantamine has repeatedly been found to 
improve core and associated symptoms of the disease (44, 45). Importantly, no significant difference in the 
frequency of side effects between the drug and the placebo arms has been found in a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of galantamine (up to 24 mg/day) for 10 weeks in children with 
autism, indicating a favorable safety drug profile (45) as we are reporting in this study. This previous clinical 
experience may be useful while designing studies investigating galantamine in pediatric MetS.
MetS and type 2 diabetes can be frequently associated with cognitive deterioration (46). The importance 
of considering alleviation of cognitive problems in strategizing new therapeutic approaches for these condi-
tions has been emphasized (47). Our results together with the previous extensive characterization of galan-
tamine as a cognitive enhancer suggest a dual beneficial role of galantamine that should be considered in 
designing future studies with galantamine in MetS, type 2 diabetes, and other diseases stemming from MetS.
Our study has strengths and limitations. The study had many features of a good clinical trial design: par-
allel groups with equal sexual representation per group, concealed randomization, placebo control, and blind-
ing of participants and investigators. The sample size of 30 participants per group provided ample power to 
detect meaningful differences between galantamine- and placebo-treated patients. The effects of galantamine 
were assessed using well-validated tests and assays. A failure in performing fat depot tissue assessment in a 
few patients (who did not come for this test) and technical errors related to transportation and processing of 
blood samples resulted in a limited number of missing data; these represent limitations of the study.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that galantamine, a drug in clinical use for the symptomatic 
treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, ameliorates important components of MetS pathogenesis, including 
inflammation and insulin resistance and alters autonomic tone. These effects were seen at a low galan-
tamine dose and the drug was extremely well tolerated. Further studies to examine the predictive value of 
these favorable alterations in inflammation and insulin resistance in this at-risk population and the long-
term clinical benefits of galantamine in the treatment of MetS should be pursued.
Methods
Study design and participants. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects 
of galantamine treatment in patients diagnosed with MetS. The study was performed at a clinical research 
center, The Heart Institute (InCor), University of São Paulo, Brazil. Study participants were recruited from 
outpatient settings. Individuals of both sexes between the ages of 18 and 59 years, and with BMI measures 
between 25 and 39 kg/m2 were screened for the presence of MetS according to the ATP III criteria (1). 
These criteria require the presence of at least 3 of the following 5 parameters: increased abdominal circum-
ference (≥102 cm for men and ≥88 cm for women); low plasma HDL cholesterol levels (<40 mg/dl for men 
and <50 mg/dl for women); increased values for plasma triglycerides (≥150 mg/dl); elevated BP (≥130 mm 
Hg SBP or ≥85 mm Hg DBP); and increased plasma glucose levels (≥100 mg/dl). All subjects were evalu-
ated to exclude conditions that restricted their inclusion in the study, which included symptoms and signs 
of cardiovascular disease or previous diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias; coronary artery disease; valvular 
disease; heart failure; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic inflammatory diseases; cancer; posi-
tive status for HIV; abuse of alcohol or other illicit substances in the months prior to study entry; chronic 
use of medications, including drugs that have known or probable interaction with galantamine (serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors, amitriptyline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, ketoconazole, oxybutynin, paroxetine, quini-
dine); symptoms and signs of neurologic and autonomic diseases; past history of major depression, sui-
cidal ideation, and history of eating disorders; triglyceride levels 400 mg/dl or higher; known history of 
liver disease or levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) or alanine transaminase (ALT) 200 U/l or higher; 
office BP 160 mmHg or higher or DBP 110 mmHg or higher; and abnormal renal and thyroid function. 
All women were tested for pregnancy as an exclusion criterion. CONSORT 2010 guidelines (http://www.
consort-statement.org) were followed during the preparation of this manuscript.

Outcomes. The primary outcome measures of this study were plasma levels of cytokines and adipokines 
with a recognized role in mediating the MetS inflammatory state and linked to insulin resistance and 
cardio-metabolic derangements, including TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, leptin, and adiponectin. Secondary 
endpoints were fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels and the associated HOMA-IR, HRV
, fat tissue 
depots (measured by computed tomography), metabolic and cardiovascular indices, including HDL cho-
lesterol, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, arterial BP, and heart rate. No changes in the trial 
outcomes were made on the protocol after the trial commenced. We did, however, make some edits to the 
text initially posted on ClinicalTrials.gov to better reflect and summarize information in the protocol; cyto-
kines and adipokines as primary outcome measures and metabolic and cardiovascular indices as secondary 
outcome measures were specifically listed.
Randomization, masking, and blinding. In order to reduce sex bias, subjects were stratified by sexual 
phenotype prior to being randomized to the galantamine or placebo arm. Recruitment of study partici-
pants took place until 30 men and 30 women were recruited to allow randomization in equally divided 
groups by sex. Study participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 parallel groups at a 1:1 ratio: 30 
subjects (15 males and 15 females) were assigned to galantamine treatment and 30 subjects (15 males 
and 15 females) to placebo. A computer-generated random sequence method was used to allocate the 
participants to the corresponding groups. Randomized packages of placebo and active drug were num-
bered from 1 to 60 (http://graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize1/). Members of the staff of the Cen-
tral Pharmacy that did not participate in the study conducted the randomization and were responsible 
for the drug delivery and inventory. Specific drug accountability included quantities dispensed/received 
(capsule counting) every month, serial numbers, expiration date, and drug code number. To achieve 
masking (blinding), galantamine capsules were reencapsulated at the Central Pharmacy of the Clinical 
Hospital, Medical School of University of São Paulo. Active drug and placebo capsules were presented 
in identical medication packaging. The study drug packages were stored in a secure, temperature-con-
trolled medication room according to standard operating procedures. Subjects received packages of 
study drug for 30 ± 3 days, every 4 weeks for a total of 12 weeks. Study participants, investigators, and 
outcome assessors were blinded to the group assignment.
Study procedures. Galantamine hydrobromide extended-release capsules of 8 mg and 16 mg, commer-
cially available as Reminyl ER (manufactured by Janssen-Cilag Pharmaceuticals, Johnson & Johnson) or 
placebo were used in the study. Galantamine was administered orally in a dose of 8 mg for 4 weeks, and 
then titrated to 16 mg for 8 weeks, for a total of 12 weeks. Following informed consent, at the initial screen-
ing all subjects underwent complete clinical and neurological evaluations including BP, waist circumfer-
ence, height, weight, and BMI. Blood tests, including triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and 
LDL cholesterol, fasting glucose, serum creatinine, thyroid and liver function tests, renal function panel, 
pregnancy testing (if applicable), and complete blood count were performed. Electrocardiogram and chest 
x-ray were also performed. Based on results from the screening visit, eligible subjects (fulfilling the criteria 
for enrollment in the study) returned 7–10 days later for additional assessments that included determina-
tion of intra-abdominal, subcutaneous abdominal, and epicardial fat tissue depots, heart rate, office and 
24-hour ABPM, HRV analysis, blood tests for plasma cytokine, adipokine and insulin levels, and HOMA-
IR assessment. After completing all evaluations, subjects were randomized and instructed to start taking 
the study drug. All subjects were assessed at 4 and 8 weeks for safety monitoring with clinical and neuro-
logical exams. After 12 weeks, at the end of the treatment period, subjects repeated the specific assays for 
fat tissue depot determination, heart rate determination, office and 24-hour ABPM, HRV analysis, blood 
tests and plasma cytokine, adipokine and insulin determination, and HOMA-IR assessment. The principal 
investigator, coinvestigators, and the principal coordinator monitored all study participants who were also 
able to communicate with the investigators by phone or email if necessary. Subject self-reporting of medi-
cation adherence and capsule counts were used to establish treatment compliance.
Methods and assays. Intra-abdominal (visceral) and subcutaneous abdominal fat were determined by 
computed tomography scans at the Cardiac Tomography and Resonance Service Center at the same hos-
pital. Briefly, intra-abdominal fat and subcutaneous abdominal fat were measured by computed tomog-
raphy (Aquilion One, Toshiba Medical Systems) at the level of the 4th and 5th (L4 and L5) lumbar ver-
tebrae. All study participants were examined in the supine position with both arms stretched above the 
head, and 10-mm slices were measured. Intra-abdominal and subcutaneous abdominal fat areas (cm2)

to –50 Hounsfield units (HU) (48). For analysis an automated selection of visceral fat area was taken 
by using threshold technique in the range of –30 to –190 HU with subsequent volume calculation. For 
this analysis, we used a workstation with Aquarius Intuition software (Terarecon), which automatically 
separates visceral abdominal fat from subcutaneous fat, and exports the corresponding volumes of the 2 
compartments. To evaluate the total chest fat around the heart, a Vitrea workstation (Vital Images) was 
used with a volumetric threshold instrument defining fat as voxels with a tissue density between –30 and 
–190 HU. Epicardial fat was defined as the one internal to the pericardium and in direct contact with the 
epicardial surface of the heart. This assessment was performed using the Vitrea workstation volumetric 
tool with manual planimetry, drawing a dividing line at the pericardium. Thus, average density and vol-
ume (in ml) of the epicardial compartment was generated.
Twenty-four–hour ABPM was performed using a SpaceLabs healthcare device (model 90207). BP was 
measured every 10 minutes during the day (8 AM to 11 PM) and every 20 minutes during the night (11 PM to 
8 AM) with an appropriate cuff placed on a nondominant arm. Participants were instructed to perform their 
ordinary daily activities and not to move their arm during the ongoing measurement. Activity, bedtime, and 
time on awakening from sleep were recorded by participants in their diaries. Therefore, daytime and night-
time BP based on 24-hour ABPM was evaluated using actual sleep and wake times recorded by participants.
For HRV analysis all subjects were asked to abstain from exercise 24 hours before the study and 
from drinking caffeinated products on the morning of the test. The test was performed in a quiet room. 
BP waveforms were obtained with a digital photoplethysmograph device (Finometer; Finapres Medi-
cal System BV) while subjects were awake in a supine position during a 15-minute rest period. These 
stored data were subsequently analyzed to calculate HRV values. All of the segments were visually 
inspected, and the nonstationary data were discarded. A Hanning window was used to attenuate the 
side effects, and the spectrum of each segment was computed using a direct fast Fourier transform 
(FFT). Spectral bands were defined according to literature references of evaluation in humans: LF 
(0.04–0.15 Hz), HF (0.15–0.4 Hz), and total power. Spectral components were expressed in absolute 
values (ms2) and nu. The nu were obtained by calculating the percentage of LF and HF with respect 
to the total power after subtracting the power of the very-low-frequency component (frequencies of 
<0.04 Hz). To assess the sympathovagal balance, the LF/HF ratio of the HRV was calculated (49, 50).
For plasma cytokine, adipokine, and insulin determination venous blood was collected from the partici-
pants and plasma samples obtained. Samples were stored at –80°C prior to analysis. Cytokines, adipokines, 
and insulin were analyzed using multiplex immunoassay (all from Millipore): HCYTMAG-60K-PX41 for 
TNF, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10; HADK2MAG-61K for leptin and insulin; and HADK1MAG-61K for adi-
ponectin. Individual values for leptin and adiponectin were used to calculate the leptin/adiponectin ratio.
Statistics. The proposed sample size for this trial was 60 subjects (n = 30 per group), based on resources 
available and in consistency with previous clinical studies (51, 52). It should be noted that a sample size 
of 30 in each group will have 86% power to detect an effect size of 0.8 using a 2-group t test with a 0.05 
2-sided significance level. This is consistent with the power analysis previously used in studying the effects 
of a drug (rosiglitazone) or placebo once daily for 12 weeks on inflammatory and metabolic indices in 60 
patients with the metabolic syndrome (51).
Descriptive statistics for all subjects at baseline are reported as means and SD separately by group 
(Table 1). The Mann-Whitney test was used to determine whether the difference for each of the baseline 
measures between the placebo and the galantamine groups was significant. As cited below, some variables 
were analyzed with a log transformation; however, these variables are summarized in their original units of 
measurement for the columns labeled “Baseline” and “Follow-up” in Tables 1, 2, and 4. For the columns 
labeled “Treatment × Time Interaction Effect”, they are summarized in the log scale.
Repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) with a mixed models approach was used to 
determine if the 2 groups behaved differently over time (pre- vs. post-) for most primary and secondary 
outcomes/endpoints (i.e., the group × time interaction). For all analyses, the standard assumptions of 
Gaussian residuals and equality of variance were tested. As the normality assumption was not met for 
insulin, HOMA-IR, high frequency (ms2) of HRV
, LF (ms2) of HRV
, and LF/HF ratio, the logarithmic 
transformation was used for the analysis of these variables.  The repeated-within-subjects factor was time 
and the within-subjects factor was treatment group (galantamine or placebo). 
RMANOVA analyses were restricted to those subjects who had measurements at both baseline and 
follow-up visits. Means and SDs were reported at each time point for each of the 2 randomized treatment

arms (Tables 2 and 4). The treatment effect sizes are presented as the arithmetic differences in least-squares 
means, with corresponding 95% CIs.
IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 were subject to lower detectable limits (0.8 pg/ml, 0.9 pg/ml, and 1.1 pg/ml, 
respectively). Therefore, any values that were below the lower detectable limit were set to 0.79 pg/ml, 0.89 
pg/ml, and 1.09 pg/ml, respectively, for analysis (Table 3). Since this approach might render the required 
assumptions of the mixed-model analyses to be invalid, the bootstrap method using percentiles was used 
to estimate 95% CIs for the mean treatment × time interaction effect. The Mann-Whitney test was used to 
determine whether the difference in differences (Post-Pre) for each of these measures between the galan-
tamine and placebo groups was significant.
A result was considered statistically significant at P less than 0.05. All analyses were performed using 
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc.).
Study approval. The study was performed at The Heart Institute (InCor), University of São Paulo, 
Brazil. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Committee and the 
Human Subject Protection Committee of the Heart Institute (InCor) and the Clinic Hospital (number 
11672/555738), University of São Paulo. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants prior 
to inclusion in the study. The study was conducted in accordance with World Medical Association Inter-
national Code of Medical Ethics (Declaration of Helsinki, 1964; revised in 2008). The study is registered 
at www.clinicaltrials.gov with the number NCT02283242 and the following name: “Galantamine effects in 
patients with metabolic syndrome (GALANTA-MS)”: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02283242
?term=galantamine+metabolic+syndrome&rank=1.
Adverse effects monitoring and assessment. Prior placebo-controlled clinical trials with galantamine doses 
of 24 mg/day and 32 mg/day in patients with Alzheimer’s disease have indicated that the most common 
adverse effects of these galantamine doses are gastrointestinal, particularly nausea (22). However, using a 
lower galantamine dose or slowly escalating the drug dose has been shown to substantially reduce the fre-
quency of gastrointestinal adverse effects, thus demonstrating a favorable tolerability profile of galantamine 
(53). Therefore, in this study we implemented a regimen of low-dose galantamine treatment in which 
the initial drug dose (8 mg/day) for 4 weeks was subsequently increased to 16 mg/day for the remaining 
period of the study. The patients were informed about possible adverse effects and were encouraged to write 
down (document) and report any complaints and adverse effects. In addition, the patients were allowed 
and encouraged to report any adverse effect through unrestricted telephone contact with the investigator. 
Hospital support was available for the patients. To additionally ensure safety, clinical consultations were 
performed monthly and the participants in the study were asked about the occurrence of adverse effects, 
including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and tremor.
