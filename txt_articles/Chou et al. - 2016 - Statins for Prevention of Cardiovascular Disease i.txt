Statins for Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Adults
Evidence Report and Systematic Review
for the US Preventive Services Task Force
Roger Chou, MD; Tracy Dana, MLS; Ian Blazina, MPH; Monica Daeges, BA; Thomas L. Jeanne, MD
IMPORTANCE Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality and morbidity
in the United States, may be potentially preventable with statin therapy.
OBJECTIVE To systematically review benefits and harms of statins for prevention of CVD
to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.
DATA SOURCES Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(from 1991), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (from 2005) to June 2016.
STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials of statins vs placebo, fixed-dose vs titrated
statins, and higher- vs lower-intensity statins in adults without prior cardiovascular events.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS One investigator abstracted data, a second checked data
for accuracy, and 2 investigators independently assessed study quality using predefined
criteria. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause mortality, CVD-related morbidity or mortality,
and harms.
RESULTS Nineteen trials (n = 71 344 participants [range, 95-17 802]; mean age, 51-66 years)
compared statins vs placebo or no statin. Statin therapy was associated with decreased risk of
all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.93]; I2 = 0%; absolute risk
difference [ARD], −0.40% [95% CI, −0.64% to −0.17%]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.69
[95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88]; I2 = 54%; ARD, −0.43% [95% CI, −0.75% to −0.11%]), stroke (RR, 0.71
[95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82]; I2 = 0; ARD, −0.38% [95% CI, −0.53% to −0.23%]), myocardial
infarction (RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.71]; I2 = 0%; ARD, −0.81% [95% CI, −1.19 to −0.43%]),
and composite cardiovascular outcomes (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.78]; I2 = 36%; ARD,
−1.39% [95% CI, −1.79 to −0.99%]). Relative benefits appeared consistent in demographic
and clinical subgroups, including populations without marked hyperlipidemia (total
cholesterol level <200 mg/dL); absolute benefits were higher in subgroups at higher baseline
risk. Statins were not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events (RR, 0.99 [95%
CI, 0.94 to 1.04]), myalgias (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.16]), or liver-related harms (RR, 1.10
[95% CI, 0.90 to 1.35]). In pooled analysis, statins were not associated with increased risk of
diabetes (RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.20]), although statistical heterogeneity was present
(I2 = 52%), and 1 trial found high-intensity statins associated with increased risk (RR, 1.25
[95% CI, 1.05 to 1.49]). No trial directly compared titrated vs fixed-dose statins, and there
were no clear differences based on statin intensity.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In adults at increased CVD risk but without prior CVD events,
statin therapy was associated with reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and
CVD events, with greater absolute benefits in patients at greater baseline risk.

C
ardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mor-
bidityandmortalityintheUnitedStates.1Achallengeinre-
ducing adverse outcomes of CVD is that the first clinical
manifestationcanbecatastrophic,includingsuddencardiacdeath,
acute myocardial infarction, or stroke.2,3
Statins reduce the risk of CVD-associated morbidity and mor-
tality through their effects on lipids and are also thought to have
anti-inflammatory and other plaque-stabilization effects.4 Seven
statins are available in the United States (Table 1). Although statin
therapy for patients with prior cardiovascular events is widely sup-
ported, use in patients without prior cardiovascular events is
controversial.5 Recent guidelines on statins for prevention of CVD4
differ from previous guidelines6 in terms of the recommended
instrument to estimate cardiovascular risk, the target populations
for statin therapy, and treatment strategies (eg, treat to target lipid
levels vs fixed-dose statin therapy; choice of statin intensity).7,8
TheUnitedStatesPreventiveServicesTaskForce(USPSTF)com-
missioned this review9 to inform the development of recommen-
dations on statin therapy for prevention of CVD in adults 40 years
and older without prior cardiovascular events.10 Although previ-
ous USPSTF recommendations11 addressed screening for lipid dis-
orders,theUSPSTFhasnotaddressedselectionofpatientsforpre-
ventive therapy or statin selection and treatment strategies.
Methods
Scope of the Review
Using established methods,12 the USPSTF determined the scope
and key questions for this review (Figure 1). This review was con-
ducted as a subcategory of the lipid disorders in adults topic. The
final research plan was posted on the USPSTF website prior to con-
ducting the review.13 Detailed methods are available in the full evi-
dencereportavailableathttp://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce
.org/Page/Document/final-evidence-review149/statin-use-in
-adults-preventive-medication1.
Data Sources and Searches
A research librarian searched the Cochrane Central Register of Con-
trolled Trials (from 1991), the Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews (from 2005), and Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946) to June
2016 for English-language publications (eAppendix 1 in the Supple-
ment), and reference lists. After the draft report was posted for
public comment and peer review, the search was updated in June
2016 and 1 additional trial was added.14
Study Selection
Two reviewers independently evaluated each study on the basis of
predefinedcriteriaattheabstractandfull-textreviewlevels(eTable
1intheSupplement).Thepopulationofinterestwasadults40years
and older without prior CVD events. Studies were limited to those
in which fewer than 10% of the participants had prior CVD events
to include only trials that predominantly enrolled the population of
interest. We included randomized trials of statin therapy vs pla-
cebo or no statin and assessed all-cause mortality, coronary heart
disease, stroke-related morbidity or mortality, or harms of treat-
ment(includingmuscleinjury,cognitiveloss,incidentdiabetes,and
hepatic injury). We also included studies of statin treatment ad-
justedtoachievetargetlow-densitylipoproteincholesterol(LDL-C)
levels vs fixed-dose or other treatment strategies and studies that

Data Abstraction and Quality Assessment
Oneinvestigatorabstracteddetailsaboutthestudydesign,patient

investigators independently applied criteria developed by the
USPSTF12 to rate the quality of each study as good, fair, or poor
(eTable2intheSupplement).Discrepancieswereresolvedthrough
consensus.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate risk ratios (RRs) for
statins vs placebo using the Dersimonian–Laird random-effects
model with Review Manager version 5.2 (Cochrane Collaboration
Nordic Cochrane Centre). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed
with the I2 statistic.15 When statistical heterogeneity was present
(defined as I2 > 30%), sensitivity analysis was performed with the
profile likelihood method using Stata version 10.1 (StataCorp).16
Additional sensitivity and stratified analyses were performed based
on study quality, exclusion of trials that enrolled patients with prior
CVD events, duration of follow-up, intensity of statin therapy,4
mean total cholesterol and LDL-C levels at baseline, and whether
the trial was stopped early. For analyses with 10 or more trials, fun-
nel plots were constructed to detect small sample effects.17
The aggregate internal validity (quality) of the body of evi-
dence was assessed for each key question using methods devel-
oped by the USPSTF (eTable 3 in the Supplement),12 based on the
number, quality, and size of studies; consistency of results be-
tween studies; and directness of evidence.
Results
Study Characteristics
Nineteen randomized trials (Table 2) assessed the effects of stat-
insvsplaceboornostatinonhealthoutcomesinadultswithoutprior
CVD events (full list of primary and secondary publications, includ-
ing study acronyms, are reported in eAppendix 2 in the
Supplement).14,18-35Thetrialsenrolledbetween95and17 802study
participants (total sample, 71 344 participants). Mean ages ranged
from 51 to 66 years. Duration of follow-up ranged from 6 months
to 6 years.
All trials enrolled patients at increased cardiovascular
risk. In 6 trials, the main criterion for enrollment was presence
of dyslipidemia19,24,30,31,33,35; in 3 trials, early cerebrovascular
disease18,25,32; in 4 trials, diabetes21,23,26,27; in 2 trials,
hypertension20,28; and in 1 trial each, mild to moderate aortic
stenosis,22 microalbuminuria, and elevated C-reactive protein
(CRP) level (�20 mg/L [to convert CRP values to nmol/L, multiply
by 9.524]).29 One trial enrolled patients with at least 1 of a number
of risk factors, including elevated waist-to-hip ratio, dyslipidemia,
dysglycemia, and mild renal dysfunction, among others.14 Patients

LDL-C levels, 114-139 mg/dL [to convert total cholesterol and LDL-C
values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259]). In the 2 hypertension
trials,20,28 mean total cholesterol levels were 212 to 232 mg/dL and
mean LDL-C levels were 131 to 151 mg/dL; in the aortic stenosis
trial,22 the mean total cholesterol level was 205 mg/dL and mean
LDL-C levels were 120-124 mg/dL. The elevated CRP trial restricted
inclusion to patients with LDL-C levels less than 130 mg/dL.29 In
the other trials, mean lipid levels at baseline ranged from 201 to
272 mg/dL for total cholesterol and from 128 to 192 mg/dL for
LDL-C. Three trials enrolled some patients (<10%) with a history of
clinical CVD.20,30,34
Six trials were rated as of good quality,14,22,26,29,30,35 1 trial as
of poor quality,27 and 12 trials as of fair quality (eTable 2 in the

ARD, −0.66% [95% CI, −0.87% to −0.45%]) (eFigure 3 in the
Supplement),14,19,26,29-31,35 and composite cardiovascular out-
comes (13 trials; RR after 1-6 years, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.78];
I2 = 36%; ARD, −1.39% [95% CI, −1.79% to −0.99%]) (eFigure 4 in
the Supplement).14,18-21,23,26-29,31,34,35 Results from individual trials
are summarized in eTable 4 in the Supplement.
Seven trials reported similar estimates for fatal myocardial
infarction (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.50 to 0.99]; I2 = 0%; ARD, −0.16%
[95% CI, −0.42% to 0.11%]) and nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR,
0.64 [95% CI, 0.46 to 0.91], I2 = 50%; ARD, −0.46% [95% CI,
−0.90% to −0.02%]).18,19,25,29-31,35 Statins were associated with
decreased risk of nonfatal stroke (3 trials; RR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.41 to
0.81]; I2 = 0%; ARD, −0.32% [95% CI, −0.52% to −0.12%])26,29,33
but not significantly associated with fatal stroke (2 trials; RR,
0.38 [95% CI, 0.12 to 1.22]; I2 = 0%; ARD, −0.11% [95% CI, −0.38%
to 0.15%]).26,29 Three trials of patients with mild cerebrovascular
disease at baseline either did not report strokes23,25 or reported
few events.18
For cardiovascular mortality, statistical heterogeneity was
present (I2 = 54%), but the estimate was similar using the profile
likelihood method (RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.55 to 0.88]). Among trials
that reported at least 10 cardiovascular mortality events, the small-
est effects of statin therapy were reported by the HOPE-3 trial
(n = 12 705),14 which enrolled patients with at least 1 CVD risk fac-
tor (2.4% vs 2.7% after 6 years; RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.72 to 1.11]),
and the ASCOT-LLA trial (n = 10 305),20 which enrolled patients
with hypertension and at least 3 other risk factors (1.4% vs 1.6%
after 3 years; RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.66 to 1.23]); RR estimates ranged
from 0.53 to 0.68 in the others.
Excluding JUPITER29 and ASCOT-LLA,20 which were both
stopped early and together accounted for approximately 40%
of the total sample and events for several outcomes, resulted in
similar pooled estimates (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Results
were also similar in sensitivity analyses restricted to good-quality
studies,14,22,26,29,30,35studieswithdurationoffollow-upgreaterthan

when trials that included patients with prior CVD events20,30,34
were excluded (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Funnel plot asymmetry was not observed for outcomes re-
ported in at least 10 trials (eFigures 5-9 in the Supplement).
Key Question 1b. What are the benefits of statin treatment to
achieve target LDL-C levels vs other treatment strategies?
No trial directly compared statin treatment titrated to attain
target cholesterol levels vs fixed-dose treatment. There were no
clear differences in estimates between 3 trials18,19,31 of statins vs

Sex and age were the most commonly reported subgroups.
For composite cardiovascular outcomes, relative risk estimates
were very similar for men and women in 5 trials (eTable 6 in the
Supplement).14,19,26,29,31 In the ASCOT-LLA trial, the hazard ratio
(HR) for nonfatal myocardial infarction plus fatal coronary heart dis-
ease was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.44 to 0.77) in men and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.57
to 2.12) in women.20 In addition to composite cardiovascular out-
comes, JUPITER reported subgroup effects for specific
outcomes.29 Effects of statins vs placebo on composite cardiovas-
cular outcomes were similar in men and women (HR, 0.58 [95% CI,
0.45 to 0.73] and HR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.37 to 0.80], respectively),
but statins were associated with lower risk of nonfatal stroke in
men (HR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.17 to 0.63]) compared with women (HR,
0.84 [95% CI, 0.45 to 1.58]; P = .04 for interaction), with an oppo-
site pattern observed for risk of revascularization or hospitalization
(HR, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.46 to 0.86] vs 0.24 [95% CI, 0.11 to 0.51];
P = .01 for interaction).29
There were also no clear differences in the association be-
tween statin use and outcomes in analyses stratified by age older
or younger than 55, 60, 65, or 70 years, with very similar estimates
from 7 trials (eTable 6 in the Supplement).14,19,20,26,29,31,35 None of
thetrialsthatenrolledpatientsolderthan75years18,20,22,23,27,29re-
ported results in this subgroup.
Although relative risk estimates across subgroups were simi-
lar, absolute benefits were greater in subgroups at higher risk for
events. For example, in the JUPITER trial, for composite cardiovas-
cular events the ARD for statins vs placebo was −0.0106 (number
needed to treat [NNT], 94) in people younger than 70 years and
−0.0162(NNT,62)inthose70yearsandolder,29andintheHOPE-3

for CHD events were observed in the CARDS and ASCOT-LLA trials,
with ARDs of −1.77% (NNT, 56) and −2.13% (NNT, 47) in people
younger than 65 years and 65 years and older, respectively, and
−0.78% (NNT, 128) and −1.22% (NNT, 82) in those 60 years and
younger and older than 60 years, respectively.20,26
Two trials of patients with hypertension20,28 reported effects
onmostcardiovascularoutcomesthatweregenerallyconsistentwith
other statin trials, although 1 of the trials (ASCOT-LLA) found small,
statistically nonsignificant effects of statins vs placebo on cardio-
vascular mortality (RR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.66 to 1.23]).20
Pooledestimatesweresimilarintrialsrestrictedtopatientswith

For composite cardiovascular outcomes, the RR in trials restricted
to patients with diabetes was 0.63 (95% CI, 0.38 to 1.05; I2 = 70%;
ARD, −3.18% [95% CI, −6.68% to 0.33%]); the RR in 2 trials that ex-
cluded patients with diabetes and reported this outcome was 0.61
(95% CI, 0.52 to 0.71; I2 = 0%; ARD, −1.48% [95% CI, −2.35% to
−0.62%]).
The AFCAPS/TexCAPS trial stratified results according to base-
line LDL-C and CRP levels in a post hoc analysis.38 In patients with
LDL-C levels less than 149.1 mg/dL, statin therapy was associated
with decreased risk of acute major coronary events in participants
with CRP levels of 0.16 mg/dL or greater (RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.34 to
0.98]) but not in those with CRP levels less than 0.16 mg/dL (RR,
1.08 [95% CI, 0.56 to 2.08]), although the interaction among statin
therapy, baseline lipid level, and CRP level did not reach statistical
significance (P = .06). Subsequently, the JUPITER trial, which
focused on patients with elevated CRP levels (�2.0 mg/L) and
LDL-C levels less than 130 mg/dL at baseline (mean, 108 mg/dL),
found statin therapy associated with decreased risk of all-cause
mortality (RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67 to 0.96]), cardiovascular mortal-
ity (RR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.69]), and other cardiovascular out-
comes vs placebo.29 However, the HOPE-3 trial (mean baseline
LDL-C level, 128 mg/dL) found similar effects of statins on risk of
composite cardiovascular outcomes among persons with CRP lev-
els greater than 2.0 mg/L (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.60 to 0.98]) or
2.0 mg/L or less (HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.64 to 1.06]) at baseline.14

to 1.49]; ARD, 0.73% [95% CI, 0.10% to 1.36%])14; no other trial re-
ported this outcome. Few serious adverse events were reported.
Four trials reported risk of new-onset diabetes following initia-
tion of statin therapy (eTable 8 in the Supplement),14,20,29,41,42 and
unpublished diabetes risk data from 2 other trials (MEGA and
AFCAPS/TexCAPS) were available from a systematic review.43 Stat-

likelihood method were similar (RR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.93 to 1.18]).

tes risk factors (including the metabolic syndrome, impaired fasting
glucose, body mass index >30 [calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared], and hemoglobin A1c level
>6.0%) were at higher risk for incident diabetes (HR, 1.28 [95% CI,
1.07 to 1.54] vs 0.99 [95% CI, 0.45 to 2.21] in persons with no risk
factors).41 The other trials found no clear association between
statin use and increased risk of diabetes, with 1 trial (WOSCOPS)
reporting reduced risk (1.9% vs 2.8%; HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.50 to
0.98]).42 Definitions for incident diabetes varied. The pooled esti-
mate was similar in a sensitivity analysis in which WOSCOPS diabe-
tes incidence was based on less stringent diabetes criteria (RR, 1.07
[95% CI, 0.95 to 1.19], I2 = 33%).43

Benefits, Harms, and Statin Potency
KeyQuestion3.Howdobenefitsandharmsvaryaccordingtostatin
treatment potency?
Two trials of statin therapy at different intensities were
underpowered to evaluate clinical outcomes.24,33 For all-cause
mortality, risk estimates for statins vs placebo for all-cause mor-
tality were similar in trials of low-intensity statins (2 trials; RR,
0.72 [95% CI, 0.52 to 1.00]; I2 = 0%; ARD, −0.55% [95% CI,
−1.10% to 0.00%]),28,31 moderate-intensity statins (8 trials; RR,
0.88 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.97]; I2 = 0%; ARD, −0.55% [95% CI,
−0.97% to −0.13%),14,20,21,23,26,30,34,35 and high-intensity statins
(2 trials; RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.67 to 0.97]; I2 = 0%; ARD, −0.44%
[95% CI, −0.70% to −0.18%]).29,32 As noted above, JUPITER, the
only trial to find statin therapy associated with increased risk of
diabetes, evaluated high-intensity statin therapy (rosuvastatin
[20 mg/d]).29,41
Discussion
In adults at increased cardiovascular risk but without prior cardio-
vascular events, statin therapy was associated with reduced risk of
clinical outcomes vs placebo, based on 19 trials with 6 months to 6
years of follow-up (summarized in Table 3). Although the trials
evaluated diverse populations, findings were generally consistent
for all-cause mortality (15 trials; RR, 0.86 after 1-6 years [95% CI,
0.80 to 0.93]; I2 = 0%; ARD, −0.40% [95% CI, −0.64% to
−0.17%]), cardiovascular mortality (10 trials; RR, 0.69 after 2-6
years [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88]; I2 = 54%; ARD, −0.43% [95% CI,
−0.75 to −0.11%]), and other individual and composite cardiovascu-
lar outcomes. Findings were generally robust in sensitivity and
stratified analyses based on trial quality, follow-up duration, base-
line lipid levels, exclusion of trials stopped early, and exclusion of
trials with some (<10% of sample) patients with prior cardiovascu-
lar events. Adding the large HOPE-3 trial,14 which was identified
when the search was updated, also had little effect on findings.
Based on pooled estimates, the NNT to prevent 1 death from any
cause was 250 after 1 to 6 years, and to prevent 1 cardiovascular
death was 233 after 2 to 6 years. However, the NNT varied in indi-
vidual trials depending on factors such as the baseline risk of the
population (eTable 7 in the Supplement) and the duration of
follow-up (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Thesefindingsregardingbenefitsassociatedwithstatintherapy
were generally consistent with findings from recent systematic
reviews46-49 that primarily focused on patients without prior car-
diovascularevents,despitevariabilityininclusioncriteria,useofin-
dividual-patient data,46 and analytic methods. For all-cause mor-
tality, the point estimate was very similar to those from recent
systematicreviews,46-48althoughin1reviewthedifferencewasnot
statistically significant (RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.01]).46
Outcomes associated with statin use appeared to be similar in
patient subgroups defined according to demographic and clinical
characteristics. Few trials enrolled patients older than 75 years, and
no trial reported results in this subgroup. Benefits of statins did not
appear to be restricted to patients with severely elevated lipid lev-
els, because similar effects were observed in subgroups stratified
according to baseline levels.21,23,26,29 In a population without mark-
edly elevated lipid levels (mean LDL-C, 128 mg/dL), the HOPE-3
trial found similar effects of statins among persons with and with-
out elevated CRP levels.14 Similarly, trials reported similar relative
risk estimates in persons classified as having higher and lower
assessed cardiovascular risk.19,29 Given similar relative risk esti-
mates, the absolute benefits of statin therapy will be greater in
populations at higher baseline risk. For example, in the JUPITER
trial, the NNT to prevent 1 cardiovascular event was 94 in people
younger than 70 years and 62 in those 70 years and older.29 In the
AFCAPS/TexCAPS trial, the absolute risk reduction for major cardio-
vascular events was 6.64 per 1000 person-years in persons with a
10-year risk greater than 20% and 3.29 per 1000 person-years in
those with 10-year risk less than 20%.50
This review found no evidence that statins were associated
with increased risk of withdrawal because of adverse events, seri-
ous adverse events, cancer, or elevated liver enzyme levels vs pla-
cebo or no statin therapy. These findings are generally consistent
with those from recent systematic reviews, some of which also
included trials of statins for secondary prevention.47,51-53 Similar to
other meta-analyses of primary and secondary prevention
trials,54,55 this review found no association between use of statins
and increased risk of muscle-related harms, although some obser-
vational studies and randomized rechallenge trials found statins
associated with increased risk of myopathy or joint-related
symptoms.56-58 The large HOPE-3 trial found statins associated
with increased risk of cataract surgery, an unanticipated finding.14
No other trial of statins for primary prevention evaluated risk of
cataracts or cataract surgery. A systematic review that included
non–primary prevention trials and observational studies reported
discordant findings, with statins associated with decreased risk of
cataracts (OR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.71 to 0.93]).59
In contrast with systematic reviews of primary and secondary
prevention trials that reported a slightly increased risk of diabetes
with statin therapy (OR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.02 to 1.17]43,60 and RR, 1.13
[95% CI, 1.03 to 1.23]61), this review found no increased risk of dia-
betesin6primarypreventiontrials(RR,1.05[95%CI,0.91to1.20];
I2 = 52%). Another systematic review limited to primary preven-
tion trials also found no association with increased risk of diabetes

For other clinical outcomes, there were too few
trials of low- and high-intensity statins to
conduct meaningful comparisons.
Consistent
High applicability to US primary
care settings
Of 2 trials providing direct
evidence, 1 was conducted in
women and the other in people with
early CVA at baseline.
Two trials that directly compared
different intensities of statin
therapy were underpowered and
only reported incidence of CVA.
Too few trials of low- and
high-intensity statins to evaluate
differences in most clinical
outcomes based on indirect
evidence.

(4trials;RR,1.05[95%CI,0.84to1.32]).48However,individualtrials
were inconsistent, with 1 large trial (JUPITER) reporting an in-
creased risk (3.0% vs 2.4%; RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.49]).29 The
JUPITER study was the only primary prevention trial reporting dia-
betes risk that evaluated high-potency statin therapy. Other analy-
ses that included secondary prevention trials also suggested an as-
sociationbetweenhigherstatinintensityanddiabetesrisk.48,60,62,63
IntheJUPITERstudy,amongpatientswithdiabetesriskfactors,134
cardiovascular events were prevented for every 54 incident cases
of diabetes, while among persons without diabetes risk factors, 86
cardiovasculareventswereprevented,withnoincidentdiabetes.41
Evidence for the association between statin use and cognitive
harmswassparsebutindicatednoclearincreaseinrisk.Thesefind-
ings are consistent with those from a recent systematic review of
randomized trials and observational studies that found no adverse
associationsofstatinswithincidenceofAlzheimerdisease,demen-
tia, or decreased scores on tests of cognitive performance.52
No trial directly compared treatment with statins titrated to at-
tain target cholesterol levels vs fixed-dose therapy, and only 318,19,31
of 18 trials permitted limited dose titration, with no clear differences
comparedwithfixed-dosetrials.Therewasalsolittledirectevidence
todetermineeffectsofstatintherapyintensityonoutcomes,although
there were no clear differences in effect estimates when placebo-
controlledtrialsofstatinswerestratifiedaccordingtotheintensityof
therapy. A meta-analysis of individual-patient data from 22 trials, in-
cluding trials of patients with prior cardiovascular events, found an
association between the degree of LDL-C lowering and reduced risk
of clinical outcomes, potentially providing indirect evidence regard-
ing the effects of statin intensity.64
This review had limitations. The meta-analysis used the Dersi-
monian-Laird random-effects model to pool studies, which can re-
sult in overly narrow confidence intervals when heterogeneity is
present, particularly when there are few studies.16 However, when
statisticalheterogeneitywaspresent,analyseswererepeatedusing
theprofilelikelihoodmethod,whichresultedinsimilarfindings.We
did not have access to individual-patient data. An individual-
patient data meta-analysis found that the association between use
ofstatinsforprimarypreventionandall-causemortalitydidnotreach
statisticalsignificance(RR,0.91[95%CI,0.83to1.01])46butdidnot
include the recently published, large HOPE-3 trial,14 which re-
ported results consistent with the pooled estimates in this review.
Because that meta-analysis had access to individual-patient data,
the authors were able to include some trials that we excluded be-
cause more than 10% of the population had prior cardiovascular
events.65,66 For trials in which less than 10% of patients had prior
cardiovascular events,20,30,34 it was also able to separately analyze
the patients with no prior cardiovascular events. Excluding these
trials from our analyses did not affect the findings. Direct evidence
was unavailable or limited on effects of dose titration vs fixed-dose
therapy or statin intensity on clinical outcomes. Therefore, this re-
view primarily relied on analyses of placebo-controlled trials strati-
fiedaccordingtotheuseofdosetitrationorstatinintensity.There-
viewalsoexcludednon–English-languagearticles67,68andformally

risk factors. The validation of cardiovascular risk assessment instru-
ments (with some studies showing overestimation of risk) and re-
search on effects of using newer risk factors to supplement tradi-
tional cardiovascular risk assessment is ongoing.7,69-72
Conclusions
In adults at increased CVD risk but without prior CVD events, statin
therapy was associated with reduced risk of all-cause and cardio-
vascular mortality and CVD events, with greater absolute benefits
in patients at greater baseline risk.
