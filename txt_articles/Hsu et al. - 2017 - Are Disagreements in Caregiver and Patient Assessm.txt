ABSTRACT
Background. As patients age, caregivers increasingly provide
essential support and patient information. We sought to deter-
mine if patient-caregiver assessments of patient health differ and
if differences contribute to burden in caregivers of older adults
with cancer.
Materials and Methods. One hundred patients, aged �65, and
their caregivers independently assessed patient function,
comorbidity, nutrition, social activity, social support, and mental
health. Caregivers completed the Caregiver Strain Index (CSI).
Patient-caregiver assessments were compared using the
Wilcoxon signed rank test and paired t test. Association between
caregiver burden and differences between patient-caregiver
assessments was examined using generalized linear regression.
Results. Median patient age was 70 (range 65–91) and 70% had
advanced disease. Sixty percent of patients reported requiring
help with instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs); most
had good social support (median Medical Outcomes Study
[MOS]-Social Support Survey score 92) and mental health
(median Mental Health Inventory score 85).
Caregivers were a median age of 66 (range 28–85), 73%
female, 68% spousal caregivers, and 79% lived with the
patient. Caregivers rated patients as having poorer physical
function (more IADLs dependency [p5 .008], lower Karnofsky
Performance Status [p5 .02], lower MOS-Physical Function
[p< .0001]), poorer mental health (p5 .0002), and having
more social support (p 5 .03) than patients themselves. Three-
quarters of caregivers experienced some caregiver burden
(mean CSI score 3.1). Only differences in patient-caregiver
assessment of the patient’s need for help with IADLs were
associated with increased caregiver burden (p 5 .03).
Conclusion. Patient-caregiver assessments of patient function,
mental health, and social support differ. However, only differen-
ces in assessment of IADLs dependency were associated with
increased caregiver burden. The Oncologist 2017;22:1383–1391
Implications for Practice: As patients age, there is a higher incidence of frailty and cognitive impairments. As a result, caregivers
play an increasingly vital role in providing information about patient health to healthcare providers, which is used to help healthcare
providers tailor treatments and optimize patient health.These findings highlight that caregiver reporting in older adults with cancer
may not replace patient reporting in those older adults who are otherwise able to self-report. Furthermore, clinicians should check
for caregiver burden in caregivers who report providing more help with instrumental activities of daily living than patients
themselves report and provide appropriate support as needed.
INTRODUCTION
Cancer-related therapy is increasingly administered in the
outpatient setting, resulting in increased dependence on
caregivers to help with daily activities, such as dressing, bath-
ing, and meal preparation, and to help with cancer-related
tasks such as transportation to appointments and managing
treatment-related side effects. Older adults in particular, who
may
have
decreased
physiologic
reserve,
may
require
increased assistance from caregivers during periods of stress,
such as during treatment. This can place significant strain on
caregivers [1].
Caregiver burden is a subjective feeling of stress that occurs
when the demands of caregiving overwhelm caregiver resour-
ces to cope with those demands [2, 3]. Patient factors (such as
advanced cancer stage [4], health status [5], increased symp-
tom burden, and decreased quality of life [QOL] [6–8]), care-
giver factors (such as female gender [6, 7, 9–11], age [5, 10,

 12–14], comorbidity [5], relationship to patient [15], education
[14], and employment status [10]), and caregiving characteris-
tics (such as increased duration of caregiving [7] and more help
required by the patient [6, 10, 14]) are associated with
increased caregiver burden. This information is typically
obtained from patients or their caregivers. Some of these fac-
tors are subjective and differences can exist between patient
and caregiver perceptions.
A comprehensive geriatric assessment evaluates older
patients on multiple domains (including physical, psychological,
and social) and helps clinicians optimize patient health and tai-
lor treatments appropriately [16, 17]. The accuracy of proxy-
provided information within the context of a geriatric assess-
ment in older patients with cancer has not been studied.
Because these patients are more likely to be frail and have geri-
atric syndromes, such as falls and incontinence, than older
adults without cancer [18], this may represent a population in
which proxy reporting is especially important. In the general
population, differences in patient and proxy assessments of
patient health, distress, and QOL have been associated with
caregiver burden in some studies [19–23], but not in others
[24, 25]. Most studies assessing patient-proxy discrepancies
and caregiver burden have been predominantly in patients
with Alzheimer’s disease or community-dwelling older adults.
However, several key factors are unique to older adults with
cancer, including a higher likelihood of comorbidities, limita-
tions in performing activities of daily living, and poor health,
which may affect assessment results as well as caregiver bur-
den [18]. Given the complexity of this patient population,
assessment may be challenging and caregivers may be at par-
ticularly high risk of caregiver burden. Furthermore, differences
in what the caregiver perceives the patient can do compared
with what the patient can or is doing can potentially lead to
caregiver strain due to the dissonance from the conflicting
perceptions.
We hypothesized that the dissonance caused by a mis-
match between caregiver and patient assessments may place
these caregivers at higher risk of caregiver burden. We sought
to describe if differences exist in patient and caregiver
assessment of patient health and function, in the form of a
geriatric assessment in older adults with cancer, and describe if
this difference is associated with a higher risk of caregiver
burden.
METHODS
One hundred patient-caregiver dyads were recruited from 134
eligible consecutive patients from the outpatient clinic (50
from the hematology-oncology clinic and 50 from the solid
tumor oncology clinic), representing a participation rate of
75%. Patients aged 65 and older with cancer, who had a pri-
mary caregiver who was also willing to participate, were eligi-
ble. Patients were asked to identify their primary caregiver,
defined as the person who provided the most assistance to the
patient in their health care and daily needs.This was confirmed
by the caregivers. Caregivers who were <18 years were
excluded. Patients and caregivers who did not speak English
were excluded because some measures have only been vali-
dated in English. Approval from the institutional research and
ethics board and the patient’s oncologist was obtained. A
trained member of the research team recruited and obtained
informed consent from patients and caregivers.
Patient and caregiver sociodemographics and employment
status were obtained via in-person interviews by a member of
the research team. In addition, the caregiver’s relationship to
the patient, cohabitation with the patient, and duration and
time spent caring for the patient were obtained via interview
with the caregiver. Patient and caregiver cognition were
assessed using the Blessed-Orientation-Memory-Concentration
(BOMC) test (Table 1), but patients and caregivers were not
excluded on the basis of their score. The patient’s cancer diag-
nosis, stage, and treatments were gathered via chart review.
Geriatric Assessment Measures
Caregivers and patients completed a self-administered geriatric
assessment, which seeks to identify factors that place the
patient at higher risk of morbidity and mortality and subse-
quently implement potential interventions to decrease this
risk. The domains evaluated included patient functional status,
comorbidities, psychological state, nutrition, social activity, and
social support (Table 1). Caregivers were asked to complete the
questionnaire based on their assessment of the patient. The
measures utilized in this geriatric assessment were chosen
based on the feasibility of obtaining this information through
self-report and their psychometric properties have been fully
described previously [26]. The geriatric assessment was admin-
istered independently to patients and caregivers via a
touchscreen interface.
Caregiver Burden
Caregivers completed the Caregiver Strain Index (CSI), a 13-
item measure of caregiver burden, via the touchscreen inter-
face [27].This instrument targets the following domains of care-
giver burden: employment, time, financial, physical health, and
social health. The caregiver’s responses establish the presence
of sleep disturbance; inconvenience; physical effort; confine-
ment; family, personal, emotional, and employment disruption;
time pressures; feeling upset from changes in patient behavior
and personality; financial stress; and emotional and psychologi-
cal overload. Answers to each question were dichotomized to
yes5 1 and no 5 0, and the sum of all the answers constitutes
the CSI score. Scores range from 0–13, with scores �7 indicat-
ing high caregiver burden. This tool was chosen because it is
short and easy to administer and is validated with good con-
struct validity and a reliability coefficient alpha of 0.86.
Patient-Caregiver Agreement
Each pair of patient and caregiver assessments were compared.
There is no standard definition of what constitutes a significant
difference in responses between patients and caregivers. Some
studies have utilized exact agreement [28], whereas others use
exact agreement 625% of the scale [29], exact agreement half
standard deviation (SD) [30], or agreement within one category
of choice [28]. We utilized exact agreement for our analysis
(defined as cases in which patient-caregiver total scores on the
assessment tools were identical) but also analyzed the results,
defining differences as those whose scores differed by6 one
SD of the measure.

 Statistical Analysis
Patient and caregiver demographics, caregiver burden, and
results of the geriatric assessment were summarized using
descriptive statistics. Differences between patient and caregiver
assessments were calculated as caregiver assessment minus
patient assessment. All variables in the geriatric assessment, as
assessed by patients and caregivers, were compared, except for
patient cognition, which was objectively assessed through test-
ing by the research team rather than by the caregiver.Wilcoxon
signed rank test for geriatric assessments and paired t test for
weight change were used to examine the significance of differ-
ences between patient-caregiver assessments. Except for the
BOMC tool, we did not utilize any cut-points for evaluation of
the tools used in the geriatric assessment because these have
not been clearly identified and because normative values for
these instruments were established in the general population
and may not be applicable to patients with cancer.
The outcome variable, CSI, was analyzed as a continuous
variable. For all the geriatric assessments, patient-caregiver
agreement variables were considered as categorical variables
(agreement, caregivers rated patients as doing worse, or
patients rated themselves as doing worse). Generalized linear
model (GLM) was used to examine the association between
patient-caregiver agreement variables and CSI. The association
between CSI and patient/caregiver demographics, cancer
characteristics, and caregiver characteristics were also exam-
ined univariately to select for potential confounding factors for
the multivariate GLM model. Variables with an association of p
value <.05 with CSI on univariate analysis were considered to
be included in the multivariate model. The final model only
retained variables with p value <.05.
Statistical analyses were done using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html).
RESULTS
One hundred patient-caregiver pairs were included (Fig. 1).
Patient and caregiver characteristics are presented in Table 2.
Median patient age was 70 (range 65–91) and median care-
giver age was 66 (range 28–85). Most patients had lymphoma
(26%), breast cancer (19%), or gastrointestinal cancers (15%).
Most patients had advanced disease (70%) and were on treat-
ment (62% chemotherapy). The majority of caregivers were
female (73%), 79% lived with the patient, and 68% were
spousal caregivers. Five percent of caregivers scored above the
threshold for possible cognitive impairment (BOMC �11).

 score of 87.1 and MHI of 82.0, respectively). Four percent of
patients scored above the threshold for possible cognitive
impairment (BOMC �11). This paper focuses on the results
comparing patient and caregiver assessments.
Geriatric Assessment—Caregiver-Patient Differences
Patient and caregiver assessments were compared for each
patient-caregiver dyad (Table 4). Several differences were noted
between caregiver and patient assessments of the patient. Sim-
ilar results were seen whether “agreement” was defined as
identical responses or as responses that differed by 6 one SD,
with the exception of social support, which was no longer sig-
nificantly different (data not shown). Caregivers were more
likely to rate patients as having poorer physical function (lower
MOS-Physical Function [p< .0001], requiring more help with
IADLs [p5 .008], and lower KPS [p5 .02]). Caregivers also
reported patients having more social support (MOS-Social Sup-
port survey, p5 .03) and having poorer mental health (lower
MHI, p 5 .0002).There were no significant differences between
the patient and caregiver assessments of the patient’s comor-
bid conditions, falls, weight change, and social activity
(p> .05).
Caregiver Burden
Most caregivers (75%) experienced some degree of caregiver
burden (CSI �1), with a mean caregiver burden score as meas-
ured by the CSI of 3.1 (range 0–13). Fifteen percent of caregiv-
ers reported high caregiver burden (CSI �7; Table 5) [22].
Caregivers reported providing a median of 10 hours per week
of care and most (61%) had been a caregiver for at least 1 year.
Mean CSI scores by whether patient-caregiver assessments
agreed or not are presented in Table 6. Those caregivers who
assessed the patient to require more help with their IADLs
(Older American Resources and Services [OARS]-IADL) than
reported by the patient reported higher caregiver burden (CSI
4.71 vs. 1.89, p< .001; Table 6). Similar results were found uti-
lizing disagreement as differences 6 one SD in assessments
(CSI 5.73 vs. 2.23, p< .001). There was no significant associa-
tion between caregiver burden and caregiver-patient assess-
ments for other geriatric assessment measures.
For patient-related variables (demographics, cancer charac-
teristics, and patient-reported geriatric assessment results),
patient-reported KPS and weight change were negatively

 associated with CSI on univariate analysis (p< .05). Among
caregiver-related variables (demographics, caregiving character-
istics, and results from the caregiver’s assessment of the
patient), caregiver age, race and/or ethnicity, employment sta-
tus, and caregiver-reported measures of patient physical func-
tion (OARS-IADL, MOS-Physical Function, and KPS) were
negatively associated with CSI (p< .05). After adjustment for
these variables, caregivers who reported patients as requiring
more help with IADLs continued to experience increased care-
giver burden (CSI 4.04 vs. 2.51, p5 .026) compared with care-
givers whose assessment agreed with the patient.
DISCUSSION
Caregivers and older adults with cancer differed in their assess-
ment of the patient’s physical function, with caregivers report-
ing that patients needed more help with their IADLs and had
poorer physical function than patients reported. As caregivers
of older adults often provide information about patient health
and function to clinicians, particularly as cognitive impairment
and frailty are more common with increasing age, this is impor-
tant to consider and may have significant implications as to
how clinicians interpret patient performance status, which may
influence treatments offered to the patient. Moreover, these

 differences in assessments between caregivers and patients
were associated with an increased likelihood of greater care-
giver burden, which has important implications given the grow-
ing number of caregivers caring for an aging cancer population.
We found that caregiver and patient assessments differ in
some but not all domains of patient health and function.
Patient and caregiver assessments were more likely to differ
with respect to subjective health, such as the patient’s mental
health and social support, with no differences seen in more
observable areas such as number of falls and weight loss, which
has also been described in prior studies [20, 21, 24, 31–36].
Unlike prior studies, however, caregiver-patient assessments
differed with respect to physical health and function. This may
be because patients in this study were of intermediate physical
health, as evidenced by the fact that although patients
reported a median KPS of 90, 60% reported needing assistance
with at least one of their IADLs, a finding consistent with prior
studies [37]. These patients may be harder for caregivers to
assess accurately compared with patients who were in either
perfect health or very poor health (e.g., completely dependent)
[24].
Most caregivers experienced some level of caregiver bur-
den. However, caregivers who reported that patients required
more help with their IADLs than patients themselves reported
were more likely to experience higher levels of caregiver bur-
den.This was true even after taking into account factors associ-
ated with caregiver burden in other studies, such as poor
physical function and functional dependence [6, 10, 14]. It is
unclear how much of a difference in patient-caregiver assess-
ment of IADLs is clinically significant. Further research is
required to evaluate this. At this time, clinicians should consider
screening for caregiver burden in those caregivers who report
the patient as being more dependent than patients themselves
do.
There are few other studies that have looked at differences
in patient-caregiver assessments in older adults with cancer
and their association with caregiver burden, but similar findings
have been seen in both the general cancer literature and geriat-
ric studies. Several studies of cancer patients have suggested
an association between caregiver burden and differences in
caregiver-patient assessments [31, 38–40], although none have
looked specifically at patient function and health within the
context of a geriatric assessment. However, the association
between caregiver burden and differences in patient and care-
giver assessments about the need for help with IADLs has been
seen in a study of community-dwelling adults aged 65 and over
[21]. The patients’ lack of awareness of impairments in their
IADLs may be a source of stress for caregivers [41]. This may be
due to concern about patient safety and/or conflict with the
patient about their independence [42].
There are several limitations to our study. Because three-
quarters of caregivers were women and the majority of partici-
pants were non-Hispanic, these results may not generalize to
all caregivers. Additional research in males and patients of eth-
nic diversity is needed. Importantly, because all patients were
fit enough to complete the geriatric assessment, it is unclear
whether the results would be applicable to assessment of
those patients who are too unwell to respond, a situation in
which the accuracy of a caregiver response would be most rele-
vant. Because we did not include an objective assessment of
patient health or function, it is difficult to determine whether
caregivers experience more burden because there is a discrep-
ancy in assessments, or whether the presence of caregiver bur-
den itself influences caregiver perception of patient function
and health. Prior studies have posited that differences in
assessments may be due to the tendency of patients to under-
estimate the level of support and help they require [43]. On the
other hand, a study of patients with dementia found that
although caregiver report was strongly associated with some
aspects of patient function (walking, dressing), it correlated less
strongly for others (toileting, shopping), suggesting that care-
giver assessments are not always correct either [44]. It is likely
that both are important factors to consider, with a bidirectional
relationship as suggested by another study [38]. Lastly, due to
the modest sample size, our analysis focused on the association
between caregiver burden and patient-caregiver assessments
for each measure as a whole, rather than on differences in
assessment for individual components of each measure.
CONCLUSION
Discrepancies were observed between patient and caregiver
assessments in patient physical function, and these discrepan-
cies were associated with increased caregiver burden. Caregiv-
ers who perceived patients to be more dependent for their
IADLs than patients did were more likely to experience care-
giver burden. Based on our results, we suggest that assessing
both patients and caregivers is important when utilizing care-
givers as proxies for understanding patient function and when
assessing for burden in caregivers of older adults with cancer.
Further research investigating caregiver burden and caregiver-
patient assessment, with the addition of an objective marker of
patient health and function, would be helpful to better under-
stand whether caregiver burden is the cause or consequence of
differences in caregiver-patient perception of patient health.
