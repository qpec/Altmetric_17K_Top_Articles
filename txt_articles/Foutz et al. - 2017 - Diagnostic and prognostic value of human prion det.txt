Abstract
Objective—Several prion amplification systems have been proposed for detection of prions in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), most recently, the measurements of prion seeding activity with second-
generation real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC). The objective of this study was to 
investigate the diagnostic performance of the RT-QuIC prion test in the broad phenotypic spectrum 
of prion diseases.
Methods—We performed CSF RT-QuIC testing in 2,141 patients who had rapidly progressive 
neurological disorders, determined diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in 272 cases which were 
autopsied, and evaluated the impact of mutations and polymorphisms in the PRNP gene, and Type 
1 or Type 2 of human prions on diagnostic performance.
Results—The 98.5% diagnostic specificity and 92% sensitivity of CSF RT-QuIC in a blinded 
retrospective analysis matched the 100% specificity and 95% sensitivity of a blind prospective

 study. The CSF RT-QuIC differentiated 94% of cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease 
(sCJD) MM1 from the sCJD MM2 phenotype, and 80% of sCJD VV2 from sCJD VV1. The 
mixed prion type 1–2 and cases heterozygous for codon 129 generated intermediate CSF RT-QuIC 
patterns, while genetic prion diseases revealed distinct profiles for each PRNP gene mutation.
Interpretation—The diagnostic performance of the improved CSF RT-QuIC is superior to 
surrogate marker tests for prion diseases such as 14-3-3 and Tau proteins and together with PRNP 
gene sequencing, the test allows the major prion subtypes to be differentiated in vivo. This 
differentiation facilitates prediction of the clinicopathological phenotype and duration of the 
disease—two important considerations for envisioned therapeutic interventions.

INTRODUCTION
Human prion diseases are highly heterogeneous and invariably fatal neurological disorders. 
They include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), kuru, Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker (GSS) 
disease and fatal insomnia (FI)1. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) accounts for 
85% of all cases of human prion disease; genetic (gCJD) for 10–15%; and infection from 
exogenous sources, most frequently iatrogenic (iCJD) for <1%1, 2. Prions propagate by a 
process in which the pathogenic prion protein (PrPSc) replicates exponentially by templating 
the misfolding of normal cellular prion protein (PrPC)3.
The diversity of prion diseases is further increased by distinct strains of prions that transmit 
a particular disease phenotype, including incubation time, clinical signs, progression rate, 
and patterns of PrPSc deposition and neuropathological lesions4–10. Distinct phenotypes of 
human prions have been classified according to their clinicopathological characteristics, the 
methionine (M) or valine (V) polymorphism in codon 129 of the prion protein gene PRNP, 
and the mass (21 or 19 kDa, as Type 1 or Type 2, respectively) of the deglycosylated, 
protease-resistant PrPSc fragment1, 11.
Apart from brain biopsy, which with more sensitive detection of PrPSc by conformation-
dependent immunoassay (CDI) can reach 100% sensitivity and high specificity12 but carries 
inherent risks13, there is no disease-specific antemortem diagnostic test for sCJD; 
consequently a definitive diagnosis of prion disease relies on postmortem detection of PrPSc 
in brain tissue1, 12, 14. Although technological advancements such as FLAIR, diffusion-
weighted imaging (DWI), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) improved both the 
negative and positive predictive value of brain MRI and became important tools in 
differential diagnostics of human prion diseases, the origin of detected patterns and 
relationship to deposits of pathogenic PrPSc remain unclear1, 12, 15, 16. Moreover, surrogate 
markers that have been proposed for use in diagnostic tests for prion diseases—including the 
14-3-3, S-100, and tau proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)— are released into the CSF as a 
result of any acute neuronal damage17–22 and thus have low diagnostic specificity, often with 
contradictory indications in the same patient17, 20, 23.

 These difficulties prompted us and other researchers to search for methods having high 
analytical sensitivity and specificity, which could detect prions directly in tissues and body 
fluids, and which could therefore be an accurate antemortem diagnostic test for prion 
diseases. Several techniques were introduced that exploit the self-replicating (seeding) 
power of misfolded pathogenic PrPSc for detection24–26. The real-time quaking-induced 
conversion test (RT-QuIC) uses recombinant prion protein (recPrP) as a substrate to amplify 
very small amounts of PrPSc seed in CSF of CJD patients to detectable levels27, 28. The 
recent use of shorter fragments of prion protein as a substrate, and replacement of Western 
blot29 or conformation-dependent immunoassay (CDI)30 detection of the conversion 
reaction product with real-time monitoring of the amplification time course by a fluorescent 
dye, Thioflavin T, resulted in a faster and more sensitive second-generation RT-QuIC31. This 
improved technique paved the way for higher diagnostic throughput in detecting human 
prion diseases using CSF. Here we describe the diagnostic specificity and sensitivity of 
human prion detection with the second-generation CSF RT-QuIC in a blinded retrospective, 
as well as prospective analysis of a cohort of patients suffering from diverse rapidly 
progressive neurodegenerative disorders and suspected of having prion disease. We compare 
the results with detailed neuropathological and genetic assessments and analyze the impact 
of disease duration, phenotype, molecular characteristics of human prions, and 
polymorphism of codon 129 of the PRNP gene on CSF RT-QuIC in sporadic and genetic 
prion diseases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
All procedures were performed under protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board 
at Case Western Reserve University. In all cases, written informed consent for research was 
obtained from the patient or legal guardian and the material used had appropriate ethical 
approval for use in this project. All patient data and samples were coded and handled 
according to NIH guidelines to protect patient identities.
Patients and clinical evaluations
As part of the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) protocol, 
medical record information is requested from clinicians who refer subjects to the Autopsy 
Program. Clinical records of prion disease cases were reviewed by a clinician familiar with 
prion disease (BSA) and non-prion disease cases were reviewed by BSA and CF. 
Demographic data were collected using a standardized abstraction instrument and included 
approximate month of disease onset as documented in the medical record, gender, date of 
birth, date of death, clinical symptoms during the disease course, and diagnostic study 
results. Clinical symptoms pertaining to updated diagnostic criteria for sCJD were 
included15. Akinetic mutism was omitted due to its end-stage manifestation and 
commonality among cases. Brain MRIs were considered positive if the neuroradiologist’s 
reading fulfilled the criteria as previously defined27. Age was calculated as age at the time of 
death. Data were entered into a database and analyzed via SPSS 22 (IBM Corp, Armonk, 
NY).

 The criteria for inclusion were (1) availability of a clinical diagnosis of CJD according to 
WHO criteria15, 32–34 and clearly determined and dated initial symptoms upon neurological 
examination to ascertain the disease duration; (2) methionine or valine at codon 129 of the 
human prion protein (PrP) gene (PRNP); (3) unequivocal classification of Type 1, Type 2, or 
Type 1–2 sPrPSc sCJD according to Western blot (WB) pattern; (4) unequivocal 
classification of pathology as definite Type 1, Type 2, or mixed Type 1–2 at the NPDPSC in 
Cleveland, OH.
In all cases in which neuropathology, Western blots, and PRNP gene sequencing of brain 
tissue excluded prion disease, we used for final diagnosis standard clinical and 
neuropathology protocols we published previously23, 35. The criteria for diagnosis of rapidly 
progressive Alzheimer disease (AD)35 were as follows: (1) probable clinical diagnosis of 
AD35, 36; (2) absent autosomal dominant pattern of dementia; (3) unequivocal classification 
as AD after detailed neuropathology and immunohistochemistry of tau proteins and amyloid 
beta using the current National Institute of Aging – Alzheimer's Association guidelines for 
neuropathological diagnosis of AD. That also included assessments of other comorbidities 
that could contribute to cognitive decline – including Lewy body/alpha-synuclein deposits, 
vascular parenchymal injury, and hippocampal sclerosis (especially when accompanied by 
TDP-43 pathology)35, 37
Classification of cases, brain samples, and PRNP gene sequencing
DNA was extracted from frozen brain tissues in all cases, and genotypic analysis of the 
PRNP coding region was performed as described12, 38, 39. On the basis of diagnostic 
pathology, immunohistochemistry, and WB examination of 2 or 3 brain regions (including 
frontal, occipital and cerebellum cortices) with mAb 3F4, the pathogenic PrPSc was 
classified as described previously1, 30, 40, 41.
Coronal sections of human brain tissues were obtained at autopsy and stored at −80°C. 
Three 200–350 mg cuts of frontal (superior and more posterior middle gyri) cortex were 
taken from each brain and used for molecular analyses. The other symmetric cerebral 
hemisphere was fixed in formalin and used for neuropathological classification of prion 
disease using histological and immunohistochemical analysis of samples from 16 anatomical 
areas and NPDPSC’s standard protocols1, 42, 43. In a case of equivocal classification of sCJD 
subtype between pathology and Western blots, we based the classification on the molecular 
characteristics of PrPSc on Western blots developed with a panel of Type 1 and Type 2-
specific antibodies as described previously1, 44, 45. These criteria allowed the classification 
of all cases.
CSF samples
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were referred to the NPDPSC from US medical 
institutions that had patients with suspected CJD or other prion diseases. All CSF samples 
were shipped on dry ice, tested for tTau and 14-3-3 proteins, and stored at −80°C. In the 
retrospective study, those with an autopsy-confirmed diagnosis of prion disease or an 
autopsy-confirmed non-prion disease diagnosis were selected for second-generation RT-
QuIC analysis and cases were blinded.

 Controls
Each RT-QuIC plate contained a positive control run in quadruplicate, a negative control run 
in octuplicate and up to twenty-one CSF test samples. Positive control wells were seeded 
with 2 µL of sCJD MM1 brain homogenate diluted 5×10−6 with 0.1% SDS/N2 supplement 
(Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) in PBS, and brought to a final reaction volume of 100 µL 
with 13 µL of PBS. Negative control wells were seeded with 15 µL of PBS. Testing wells 
were seeded with 15 µL of neat CSF from patients with an autopsy-confirmed diagnosis of 
CJD or an autopsy-confirmed non-prion disease diagnosis.
Preparation of recombinant prion protein
N-terminally truncated Syrian hamster recombinant prion protein [SHarPrP(90–231)] was 
prepared as previously described31, 46 with minor modifications. Briefly, recombinant 
protein purification was performed using an AKTA Prime Plus system (GE Life Sciences, 
Marlborough, MA) with the addition of a column prewashing step. In this step, denaturing 
buffer [100mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 10 mM TRIS, 6 M Guanidine-HCl] was passed 
through the column at 2.3 mL/min for 30 min prior to protein gradient refolding. Protein 
concentration was determined using a NanoDrop Lite Spectrophotometer (Thermo 
Scientific, Wilmington, DE) with absorbance measured at 280 nm. Purity of SHaPrP(90–
231) was ≥95%, as estimated by Coomassie staining after SDS-PAGE and by 
immunoblotting. Analytical sensitivity and bioactivity of purified SHarPrP(90–231) were 
tested via the second-generation RT-QuIC assay.
Second-generation RT-QuIC
The second-generation RT-QuIC assays31 were performed as previously described, with 
minor modifications. The RT-QuIC reaction mix was prepared as follows: 10mM phosphate 
buffer (pH 7.4), 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/mL SHarPrP(23–231), 10 µM thioflavin T (ThT), 1 
mM ethylenediaminetetraacteic acid tetrasodium salt (EDTA) and 0.002% sodium dodecyl 
sulfate (SDS). The 85 µL of reaction mix was loaded into each plate well and seeded with 15 
µL of neat CSF for a final reaction volume of 100 µL. The incubation and real time 
fluorescence monitoring was performed using the FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG 
LABTECH GmbH, Ortenberg, Germany) set to the following parameters: 55°C incubation, 
60 hr reaction time, 60 s shake/60 s rest cycles with ThT fluorescence measurements taken 
every 45 min.
RT-QuIC data analysis
To condense the large amount of raw RT-QuIC data for analysis, the average maximum ThT 
relative fluorescence units (rfu) of quadruple positive control (Pmax), individual CSF sample 
quadruples (Smax), and no seed control octuplicates (Nmax) were calculated. To compensate 
for variations in baselines between individual samples and relative fluorescence readings 
between plate readers, a baseline correction was performed in which the Nmax value was 
subtracted from both Pmax and Smax values. Baseline-corrected Smax values were then 
normalized as a percentage of Pmax. Normalized values were calculated by dividing 
baseline-corrected Smax by baseline-corrected Pmax and multiplying by 100. The samples 
were concluded positive if more than one well in the first round or 2 wells total, in first and

 repeat rounds, were positive and exceeded the diagnostic cutoff calculated as a mean ± 4*SD 
of all autopsy prion-negative cases.
Tolerance of second-generation RT-QuIC to blood contamination
A human blood sample with a known red blood cell (RBC) count was serially diluted with 
PBS. Eight dilutions ranging from 300 to 38,400 cells/µL were aliquoted into 1 mL aliquots 
and stored at −80°C. A 1 mL aliquot of each dilution was removed from the freezer, allowed 
to thaw and diluted 1:1 with a known RT-QuIC positive and negative CSF sample. The final 
concentration of RBC in spiked CSF samples ranged from 150 to 19,600 cells/µL. Blood-
spiked CSF samples were spun at 2,000 × g for 2 min, loaded onto a 96-well plate and their 
absorbance read at 540 nm in a FLUOstar plate reader (BMG LABTECH). The seeding 
activity of each blood-spiked CSF was assessed via RT-QuIC and the maximum allowed 
tolerance determined.
14-3-3 and total Tau analyses
Surrogate markers for prion disease, 14-3-3, and tau protein, were measured by WB and 
ELISA respectively, as previously described20.
Conformation-dependent immunoassay (CDI)
CDI was used to quantify the amount of PrPSc present in our sCJD(MM1) brain homogenate 
control and was performed as previously described30, 41.
Statistical analysis
The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) 
and efficiency of each marker were obtained. The combination of different CSF RT-QuIC 
data and 14-3-3 or tTau protein results were tested by two different approaches: (i) positive if 
both results of CSF RT-QuIC and a second test were positive, and a negative result when 
either or both results of CSF RT-QuIC and a second test were negative; (ii) positive if 
combined either or both CSF RT-QuIC and a second test were positive, and a negative result 
if both results of CSF RT-QuIC and 14-3-3 were negative. We investigated the effect of the 
following demographic and laboratory variables on survival: sex, age at onset, and disease 
duration; and compared the parameters for the whole group and different phenotypic 
subgroups with ANOVA or Fisher exact test. Cumulative survival curves were constructed 
by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the Mantel-Cox and Breslow methods. 
For each type of PrPSc and PRNP codon 129 polymorphism, we report descriptive statistics 
and each variable was compared with ANOVA.
RESULTS
Analytical sensitivity of second-generation RT-QuIC for human brain prions
The analytical sensitivity of second-generation RT-QuIC was determined by serial dilution 
of brain homogenates prepared from three typical sCJD MM1 brain samples, three sCJD 
VV2 brain samples, and control cases diagnosed with other neurological diseases (Figure 1A 
and 1B). The raw fluorescence kinetic data and dilutions of a typical sCJD MM1 case shown

 in Figure 1A demonstrate the quantitative RT-QuIC response with progressively diminishing 
fluorescence signal and extending lag phase. Cumulatively, the second-generation RT-QuIC 
test demonstrates analytical sensitivity (Figure 1B) with detection limit for MM1 and VV2 
sCJD prions at 109-fold dilution of respective brain homogenates Comparison to PrPSc 
levels measured in the initial 10% homogenate with CDI indicated that the endpoint 
sensitivity of second-generation RT-QuIC is ~3 ag of PrPSc per plate well, corresponding to 
10–40 prion particles, assuming that the smallest human prion particles with the highest 
replication potency is composed of 20–78 monomers of PrPSc 30. In contrast, uniformly flat 
responses were seen with the unseeded reactions and those reactions seeded with brain 
homogenates of other neurological diseases.
We investigated the known inhibitory effect47 of blood contamination on second-generation 
CSF RT-QuIC by serially diluting blood into RT-QuIC-positive CSF samples obtained from 
patients with variable sCJD subtypes: sCJD VV2 (n = 3), sCJD MM1 (n = 3), sCJD MV1 (n 
= 2), MV1–2 (n = 1), and gCJD with the E200K mutation (n = 1). We observed a uniform 
inhibitory effect above 9,600 red blood cells (RBC)/µl corresponding, after freezing and 
thawing, to the 540 nm absorbance of released hemoglobin equal to 0.389. Based on these 
experiments, we established a threshold (mean – 3×SD) for maximum acceptable blood 
contamination at hemoglobin absorbance 0.339 corresponding to 8,400 RBC/µl (Figure 2). 
These criteria excluded 58 (2.7%) out of 2,141 tested CSFs from evaluation.
Diagnostic performance of second-generation CSF RT-QuIC
Autopsy and detailed neuropathological assessment was performed on 272 cases of a total of 
2,141 second-generation CSF RT-QuIC tests referred to NPDPSC for evaluation of patients 
with rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorders. In the first retrospective RT-QuIC 
cohort, we blindly tested CJD cases that represented expected frequencies of different prion 
disease subtypes in the general population1. The samples were defined a priori as RT QuIC 
positive or negative before unblinding and review of neuropathology. Other rapidly 
progressive neurological disorders, most frequently rapidly progressive Alzheimer disease, 
were used as control cases23, 48. The samples that were previously tested for 14-3-3 and tTau 
proteins were blinded and tested with second-generation CSF RT-QuIC. The demographics, 
clinical and neuropathological classification of the retrospective cohort are summarized in 
Table 1. The neuropathologically verified RT-QuIC positive cases were associated with an 
older age (P = 0.002), shorter disease course (P = 0.014), and a higher frequency of ataxia (P 
= 0.034). The RT-QuIC was more frequently negative in sCJD MM2 (P = 0.024) and we 
observed no correlation of the RT-QuIC result with the origin —sporadic or genetic—of 
prion disease, codon 129 polymorphism alone, gender, EEG, and MRI.
To evaluate the second-generation CSF RT-QuIC performance during routine CSF testing, 
we blindly tested all samples sent to NPDPSC with RT-QuIC and in parallel for 14-3-3 and 
tTau proteins. All data were decoded and evaluated after autopsy, neuropathological 
assessment, and PRNP gene sequencing. Comparing the retrospective and prospective prion 
cohort (Table 2), the data indicate a greater preponderance of rapidly progressive prion 
diseases with shorter illness duration and 23% were mixed PrPSc Type 1–2 cases that were 
not incorporated into the retrospective study.

 The general diagnostic performance of second-generation CSF RT-QuIC, in the retrospective 
cohort, is superior to both traditional 14-3-3 and tTau surrogate tests (Table 3). The 98.5% 
diagnostic specificity in all prion disease forms is due to one case which repeatedly tested 
positive in CSF RT-QuIC, but which after the neuropathology was found to be Lewy body 
dementia (LBD). However, after precipitating prions from brain homogenate with PTA 
followed by WBs and CDI30, 41, we observed low, but above treshhold levels of PrPSc that 
may have escaped detection by immunohistochemistry12. Whether this case represents a 
false positive, or a true positive prion disease carrier with LBD comorbidity will require 
bioassay. Cumulatively, the increase in diagnostic specificity is particularly clinically 
relevant in the differential diagnostic clinical category of rapidly progressive dementias, 
because 42% are malignant forms of Alzheimer disease (Table 4). The prospectively 
determined diagnostic performance of second-generation CSF RT-QuIC maintains 100% 
specificity and 95% sensitivity for prion diseases of sporadic and genetic origin, with 100% 
and 82% positive and negative predictive value, respectively. The diagnostic specificity and 
sensitivity of both 14-3-3 and tTau protein were lower than CSF RT-QuIC, with 14-3-3 
protein being the least reliable indicator of prion disease in all statistical parameters (Table 5 
and for individual genetic cases Table 6). Combining the prospective CSF RT-QuIC data 
with the results of 14-3-3 or tTau decreased the sensitivity and specificity for CSF RT-QuIC 
+ 14-3-3 protein to 82% and 43%, respectively, and for CSF RT-QuIC + tTau to 92% and 
72%, respectively.
Prion type differentiation with second-generation CSF RT-QuIC
Cumulative plots of raw data revealed significant differences in the second-generation CSF 
RT-QuIC patterns, in both maximum fluorescence and lag interval, obtained in different 
subtypes of sCJD cases (Figure 1C–F). All the sCJD MM1 cases showed a significantly 
shorter lag phase and higher maximum fluorescence values than those in sCJD MM2 cases 
(P < 0.0001) (Figure 1C). In contrast, the sCJD VV1 cases showed significantly lower 
fluorescence intensity and an extended lag phase (P = 0.0011) (Figure 1D). Neither 
parameter differentiated CSF RT-QuIC of heterozygous sCJD MV1 from MV2 and the 
average fluorescence intensity was intermediate (Figure 1E). Interestingly, the cases with 
mixed Type 1–2 PrPSc in the same or different brain locations generated patterns of CSF RT-
QuIC similar to sCJD MM1, reminiscent of the previous observation in PMCA, in which 
Type 1 prions progressively won the replication competition with the more slowly 
replicating Type 2 prions (Figure 1F)40. With the cutoff value for maximum fluorescence 
intensity of sCJD MM2 set at mean + 3SD, the individual CSF RT-QuIC data allowed 
differentiation of sCJD MM1 from sCJD MM2 with 95% probability. The higher RT-QuIC 
seeding potency of sCJD MM1 cases correlated with only a 2.7-month median cumulative 
survival and contrasted significantly with the median 9.7-month survival of MM2 cases (P = 
0.015) (Figure 3A and 3B). Similarly, the CSF RT-QuIC fluorescence intensity differentiated 
sCJD VV1 from sCJD VV2 with 80% probability (Figure 3C and 3D). The previously 
reported survival data indicated the significantly longer survival of sCJD VV1 compared to 
sCJD VV2 cases1, 49, but this trend was not significant in our subset due to the small number 
of cases. Cases of gCJD, GSS, and FFI had clearly different seeding effects in CSF RT-QuIC 
that were unique for each mutation. While gCJD with E200K mutation tested in CSF RT-
QuIC was invariably highly positive, the CSF RT-QuIC seeding activity varied widely with

 each specific mutation in GSS and in FFI, and these data correlate with the broad variation 
in disease duration (Figure 3E and 3F).
DISCUSSION
Neuropathological evaluation of the cases from this retrospective and prospective study 
show that second-generation RT-QuIC analysis of CSF samples from patients with suspected 
prion diseases can detect prions with a specificity and sensitivity of 98.5–100% and 92–
95%, respectively. The high diagnostic specificity compares well with the results of the 
earlier version of RT-QuIC47, 50, 51. However, high analytical sensitivity with a detection 
limit of 3 ag of pathogenic PrPSc, corresponding to 10–40 human prion particles, leads to 
enhanced diagnostic sensitivity and reproducibility. Consequently, second-generation RT-
QuIC missed only 5–8% of prion cases compared to 11–23% in the first generation 
assays31, 47, 50–52.
The results from this study show that the second-generation CSF RT-QuIC has, in a standard 
surveillance setting, higher sensitivity and specificity to CSF 14-3-3 (monitored here with 
WBs) and tTau proteins. Combining the CSF results into a two-component panel did not 
increase diagnostic sensitivity, but significantly decreased the specificity of the final 
conclusion. However, further studies are required to assess the complementary role, if any, 
which CSF 14-3-3 or tTau, on the one hand, and CSF second-generation CSF RT-QuIC, on 
the other, may play in the differential clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. The 
observed lower specificity of 14-3-3 protein and higher specificity of tTau in the prospective 
cohort may reflect higher proportion of rapidly progressive non-prion cases in this cohort, 
the trend already noticed in an earlier study53. However, to draw a definitive conclusion 
would require expanding the numbers of prospectively followed autopsied cases. Ongoing 
studies are being pursued and more CSF samples need to be investigated from patients with 
vCJD, gCJD, VPSPr, and other atypical prion disease so that a better understanding can 
emerge of how this new test can be used in detection and differentiation of the less common 
and often atypical prion diseases.
Interestingly, in the retrospective second-generation CSF RT-QuIC study, we found one 
patient in which the initial neuropathology was concluded to be LBD but which RT-QuIC 
revealed repeatedly positive CSF for prions. Subsequent reinvestigation of the brain 
homogenate of this patient after PTA precipitation with CDI and WBs revealed low but 
above threshold levels of PK-resistant PrPSc. Considering the up to 50-year incubation time 
of prion diseases and the high analytical sensitivity of second-generation CSF RT-QuIC, we 
conjectured that this patient was likely a subclinical prion carrier who died due to LBD 
comorbidity. However, a definitive conclusion on this case would require protein misfolding

The analysis of seeding activity kinetics in this study indicates strong agreement between 
CSF RT-QuIC data and final neuropathological classification after autopsy, which in turn 
correlates with the cumulative survival and duration of the disease. These correlations allow 
for the classification and subtyping of prion disease in the majority of cases while the patient

 is still alive. The CSF RT-QuIC combined with PRNP gene sequencing data allowed us to 
differentiate with 95% probability the most aggressive sCJD MM1 from slowly progressive 
sCJD MM2, and with 80% probability more aggressive sCJD VV2 prions from CJD VV1 
prions, usually associated with slow progression. The two negative CSF RT QuIC in cases 
with sFI and one with GSS are intriguing and may suggest either lower levels of prions, 
distinct prion seeding potency due to the different conformation of PrPSc, or both. These 
aspects have to be addressed in parallel investigation of brain tissue to determine the levels 
and conformational strain characteristics of PrPSc present in each case30, 41, 54. Although the 
conversion substrate used in CSF RT-QuIC was Syrian hamster PrP(90–231), nevertheless 
the seeding activities observed in this study are in general agreement with data we obtained 
previously with RT-QuIC protocol and human PrP substrate, and PMCA protocol with 
transgenic mice brain homogenates expressing human PrPC monitored with CDI30, 54.
Using advanced biophysical tools, we demonstrated recently that the different molecular 
characteristics of sCJD prions arise from distinct particle sizes and conformational 
structure14, 30, 41. Furthermore, our data indicate that phenotypically distinct sCJD prions 
differ considerably in their structural organization, both at the level of the polypeptide 
backbone (as indicated by backbone amide H/D exchange data), as well as the quaternary 
packing arrangements (as indicated by H/D exchange kinetics for histidine side chains)54. 
Remarkably, the structure of sCJD prions is fundamentally different from laboratory rodent 
prions, and in contrast to previous observations on yeast and some murine prion strains, their 
replication rate is primarily determined not by conformational stability but by specific 
structural features that control the growth rate of prion protein aggregates54. Cumulatively, 
the second-generation CSF RT-QuIC seems to replicate the conformation-driven seeding 
aspect of human prion replication remarkably well, and thus accurately predicts the 
biological characteristics of distinct human prions and establishes the prognosis of the 
patient. These individualized diagnostic data and prognoses are critical for future therapeutic 
trials and provide measurable objective criteria for therapeutic efficacy.
