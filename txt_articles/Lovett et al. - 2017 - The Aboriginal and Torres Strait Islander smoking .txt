Abstract 
Smoking is the leading contributor to the burden of disease among Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander Australians, and there is considerable potential for 
change. Understanding the epidemic stage may provide insight into probable 
trends in smoking-attributable mortality, and inform program and policy 
development. Tobacco use among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
Australians has declined substantially, accompanied by declining tobacco-
related cardiovascular mortality. Based on the available evidence, we expect 
tobacco-related cancer mortality to remain high, but peak within the next 
decade; however, there is a critical need for improved evidence to make an 
accurate assessment. The continuation and expansion of comprehensive 
tobacco reduction measures is expected to further decrease tobacco use. 
Health gains will be observed over both the short and long term.
Background
Cigarette smoking is a leading contributor to the burden of morbidity and 
mortality among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter respectfully 
referred to as Indigenous) Australians1, the total Australian population2, and 
in developed countries worldwide.3 The health impacts of smoking vary by 
smoking duration and intensity, but it is well established that smoking causes 
a range of health conditions.3 Although there have been marked smoking 
reductions in Australia4,5, the prevalence of smoking among Indigenous adults 
remains high, estimated at 41.4%, compared with 14.5% in the total Australian 
adult population.5 
Smoking behaviour is influenced by factors including social, cultural 
and environmental factors, and tobacco control effectiveness.6 Indigenous 
tobacco use is also tightly tied to Australia’s history of colonisation; for 
example, tobacco was often used as a form of payment, and was issued as 
part of rations on mission stations.7

Key points
• Data limitations restrict our ability to 
precisely predict trends in Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander tobacco use and 
associated health outcomes
• Despite substantial reductions in smoking 
prevalence, smoking-attributable mortality 
is likely to remain high because of the 
long lag time between smoking behaviour 
and the onset of tobacco-related cancer 
mortality; this should not be interpreted 
as a lack of progress in reducing tobacco 
use and associated harms
• Reducing tobacco use requires a 
continued comprehensive approach to 
tobacco control, incorporating Indigenous 
leadership and long-term investment

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smoking epidemic
2
Dramatic decreases in smoking prevalence in the 
total Australian population suggest that the smoking 
epidemic is in its final stages.3,6 However, the stage of 
the tobacco epidemic among the Indigenous Australian 
population is less clear. Understanding the stage of 
the epidemic provides insight into probable trends in 
smoking-attributable mortality, thereby enabling accurate 
communication of the likely impacts of smoking4, and 
informing relevant programs and policies.
This paper provides a perspective on the current 
stage of the smoking epidemic among Indigenous 
Australians based on an existing model of smoking 
epidemic stages3, and describes the expected short- and 
long-term implications for the wellbeing of the Indigenous 
population, and for programs and policies.
Stages of the smoking epidemic
Lopez proposed a four-stage model of cigarette 
consumption and mortality in 1994, characterising 
features of the smoking epidemic3; the model was 
updated in 2012.4 The proportion of the adult population 
that regularly smokes – and variation by characteristics 
such as age and sex – provides an indication of the 
extent to which smoking has been adopted by a 
population.3 Smoking-attributable mortality, which can be 
crudely approximated by lung cancer deaths, provides 
insight into the health consequences of smoking at each 
stage of the epidemic.3,4 Central to the model is the 
long delay between smoking and its associated cancer 
mortality; even when the prevalence of smoking begins 
to decline, smoking-attributable mortality continues to 
increase, reflecting the smoking behaviours of up to three 
decades earlier.3,4
In short, Stage 1 of the tobacco epidemic marks the 
initial population uptake of smoking, with no evidence of 
smoking-attributable mortality. In Stage 2, the prevalence 
of smoking increases rapidly to its peak, alongside 
low but increasing smoking-attributable mortality. By 
Stage 3, awareness of the health hazards of smoking is 
common, and conditions are favourable for implementing 
tobacco control measures; while the prevalence 
of smoking remains stable or begins to decrease, 
smoking-attributable mortality rises rapidly. Stage 4 is 
represented by decreasing smoking prevalence and 
associated mortality to their lower limits, in a context of 
widespread awareness of tobacco harms and tobacco 
control measures.3,4
Stage of the Indigenous tobacco 
epidemic
Prevalence
Data from national surveys indicate that smoking 
prevalence (including daily and less frequent) among 
Indigenous adults was 54.5% (95% CI 51.7, 57.4) in 
1994 and 52.1% (95% CI 49.9, 54.3) in 2004–058, and 
the prevalence of daily smoking was 50.0% (95% CI 
47.9, 52.2) in 2004–05 and 41.4% (95% CI 39.1, 43.6) in 
2014–15.5 It is not possible to determine peak smoking 
prevalence because of differences in definitions used and 
the absence of reliable prevalence data before 1994.
Daily smoking prevalence in 2004–05, 2008, 2012 
and 2014–15 was similar for Indigenous males and 
females: a unique feature of this tobacco epidemic. 
Smoking prevalence trends from 2004 to 2015 vary by 
remoteness, with daily smoking prevalence decreasing 
significantly in urban/regional areas (from 49.3%; 95% CI 
46.5, 52.1, to 39.1%; 95% CI 36.4, 41.9) but not in remote 
areas (from 51.9%; 95% CI 48.6, 55.3, to 49.3%; 95% 
CI 45.3, 53.2).5 Although these data may indicate that the 
tobacco epidemic is at a different stage in urban/regional 
versus remote settings8, particularly for females5, we note 
that the confidence intervals around all estimates are 
wide, and therefore the data may be underpowered to 
detect small differences between groups, particularly in 
remote areas.5,8 
Smoking-attributable mortality
There is contemporary direct evidence on smoking-
attributable mortality among adults in the total Australian 
population.6 However, there is a lack of direct evidence 
specific to the Indigenous population. Studies have 
indirectly estimated the impact of smoking on mortality 
among Indigenous Australians using the aetiologic 
fractions method9,10 and modelling approaches (applying 
estimates from other populations on the relationship 
between smoking and lung cancer mortality).11 The 
accuracy of these estimates is unclear. 
Although we assume that biological mechanisms 
underlying smoking-related mortality are similar among 
Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, we 
acknowledge that the association between smoking 
and mortality can vary between population subgroups 
and over time.11-13 Contemporary evidence on smoking-
attributable mortality specific to the Indigenous population 
is therefore critical to enable accurate communication 
of the health risks of smoking – and the benefits 
of not smoking. 
Lung cancer mortality can be used as an index 
of smoking-attributable mortality.3,4 However, the 
existing data are insufficient to enable a detailed 
examination of trends in lung cancer mortality over time 
because of factors including underascertainment and 
misclassification of Indigenous status, and variation 
in data quality between jurisdictions.14,15 Despite this, 
studies have consistently found that the burden of 
lung cancer mortality appears at younger ages among 
Indigenous Australians compared with non-Indigenous 
Australians.7,10,16-18 The reasons for this are unclear, 
but may include tobacco uptake at earlier ages in the 
Indigenous population, higher smoking intensity, or

differences in the age distribution and average life 
expectancy of the two populations.16 Further research 
is required to understand what underlies this excess 
mortality in the younger age groups, and to accurately 
predict the burden of smoking-related mortality in 
this population.
Awareness of health hazards of tobacco
Evidence indicates that there is widespread awareness of 
tobacco-related health consequences among Indigenous 
Australians, with variation by region and between 
specific health conditions.7,19 However, this widespread 
awareness is not necessarily associated with intention to 
quit or reduce smoking.7
Implications for future smoking-
related health burden
The model suggested by Lopez does not precisely fit the 
tobacco epidemic among Indigenous Australians (e.g. 
the extended duration of the epidemic, high smoking 
prevalence among females, and variation between urban/
regional and remote settings). Regardless, the model 
provides a useful framework for considering smoking 
trends and implications.
Overall, the available data suggest that the Indigenous 
population is at an earlier stage of the tobacco epidemic 
than the total Australian population, at Stage 3 versus 
Stage 4.3,4 Differences in smoking prevalence trends 
by remoteness and sex suggest that the stage of the 
epidemic, and therefore associated mortality trends, 
may vary between groups. However, we caution that the 
largest contemporary datasets are insufficient to enable 
precise assessment of trends within subgroups.5
Despite the lack of data to accurately quantify 
smoking-attributable mortality within the Indigenous 
population, available data indicate that the burden of 
smoking-attributable mortality is likely to remain high. 
The burden of tobacco-related cardiovascular disease is 
likely to continue to decline in the short term as smoking 
prevalence continues to decline. The burden of lung 
cancer may peak within the next decade, based on the 
assumption that peak smoking prevalence occurred at 
or before 1994 (Figure 1).15 This reflects the long lag time 
between smoking behaviour and the onset of tobacco-
related cancer mortality; this should not be interpreted 
as a lack of progress in reducing tobacco use and 
associated harms. This is supported by findings that 
the burden of tobacco-related cardiovascular diseases 
among Indigenous people decreased between 2003 and 
2011, while the burden of tobacco-related cancer and 
respiratory disease increased.1  
It is important to consider that, even if there is a 
decrease in the absolute rate of smoking-attributable 
mortality, the relative proportion of all deaths that are 
attributable to smoking may continue to increase if 
mortality rates attributed to other causes (not related to 
smoking) decrease.20 To capture changes in the health 
burden associated with smoking within the Indigenous 
population, we need evidence about smoking-attributable 
mortality in both absolute and relative terms.
Implications for tobacco control
Several data gaps need to be addressed to ensure 
appropriate monitoring of the Indigenous tobacco 
epidemic, including precise estimates of smoking-
attributable mortality and smoking prevalence, to enable 
monitoring of changes over time. 
Regardless, the health consequences of smoking 
are well established. The earlier in life people quit 
smoking, the larger the expected health benefits.6 With an 
estimated 165 000 current Indigenous daily smokers5, the 
implementation of effective, appropriate and sustained 
tobacco control measures and programs is required 
to prevent substantial numbers of premature deaths.3 
These efforts will need to consider variation in smoking 
behaviours – and their underlying determinants – by age, 
sex and remoteness.21 
The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 
provides substantial guidance on Indigenous 
participation in developing, implementing and evaluating 
socially and culturally appropriate tobacco control.22 This 
aligns with and complements a comprehensive approach 
to gender-inclusive tobacco control, encompassing a 
suite of Indigenous-specific tobacco reduction measures 
across urban, regional and remote settings. Further, 
the incorporation of Indigenous leadership, long-term 
investment and the provision of culturally appropriate 
materials and activities is critical to further reducing 
tobacco use.19, 23-25
Conclusion
Smoking is the leading contributor to the burden of 
disease among Indigenous Australians.1 Reducing 
the prevalence of smoking is critical and will generate 
substantial health gains. To precisely assess progress 
in reducing smoking prevalence among Indigenous 
Australians, better data are required. 
Our assessment, based on the available evidence, 
is that the Indigenous tobacco epidemic is at Stage 3 of 
the Lopez model. We expect to see steadily declining 
tobacco-related cardiovascular mortality, and expect 
that tobacco-related cancer mortality will remain high 
but peak within the next decade. This stage requires 
continuation and extension of the suite of comprehensive 
tobacco reduction programs and policies to assist in 
accelerating declines in tobacco use, contributing to 
health benefits. 
Understanding the stage of the Indigenous tobacco 
epidemic enables community members, researchers 
and policy makers to better interpret mortality trends in
