Purpose
To determine whether hospice use by patients with cancer is associated with their families’ per-
ceptions of patients’ symptoms, goal attainment, and quality of end-of-life (EOL) care.
Methods
We interviewed 2,307 families of deceased patients with advanced lung or colorectal cancer who
were enrolled in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance study (a multiregional,
prospective, observational study) and died by 2011. We used propensity-score matching to compare
family-reported outcomes for patients who did and did not receive hospice care, including the
presence and relief of common symptoms (ie, pain, dyspnea), concordance with patients’ wishes for
EOL care and place of death, and quality of EOL care. We also examined associations between
hospice length of stay and these outcomes among hospice enrollees.
Results
In a propensity-score-matched sample of 1,970 individuals, families of patients enrolled in hospice
reported more pain in their patient compared with those not enrolled in hospice. However, families
of patients enrolled in hospice more often reported that patients received “just the right amount” of
pain medicine (80% v 73%; adjusted difference, 7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1 to 12 percentage points) and help with dyspnea (78% v 70%; adjusted difference, 8 percentage
points; 95% CI, 2 to 13 percentage points). Families of patients enrolled in hospice also more often
reported that patients’ EOL wishes were followed (80% v 74%; adjusted difference, 6 percentage
points; 95% CI, 2 to 11 percentage points) and “excellent” quality EOL care (57% v 42%; adjusted
difference, 15 percentage points; 95% CI, 11 to 20). Families of patients who received . 30 days of
hospice care reported the highest quality EOL outcomes.
Conclusion
Hospice care is associated with better symptom relief, patient-goal attainment, and quality of EOL
care. Encouraging earlier and increased hospice enrollment may improve EOL experiences for
patients with cancer and their families.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with advanced cancer often experience
pain, dyspnea, and distress at the end of life
(EOL), and use intensive, hospital-based services
near death.1-3 Hospice offers an alternative,
patient-centered model of care focused on re-
lieving suffering, and often delivers services
within the home environment. ASCO recently
adopted timely hospice enrollment (defined as
. 3 days before death) as a key quality measure for
patients with incurable, poor-prognosis cancers4
because hospice has been associated with less
hospital-based EOL medical care, better quality of
life, and improved caregiver outcomes.2,5-9
Despite this, few studies have examined the
associations between receipt of hospice and the
symptoms experienced by patients with advanced
cancer and receipt of medical care congruent with
their preferences.7 Similarly, few studies have
assessed whether these outcomes differ by the
duration of hospice enrollment.2,10-14 This is
important because although hospice use has in-
creased since the 1990s,3,15 many patients with
advanced cancer are enrolled # 3 days of death.3
In this study, we examined whether hospice
was associated with family members’ reports of
the presence and relief of common symptoms,
patient-goal attainment, and quality of EOL care,
using data from the Cancer Care Outcomes

 Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium. We also
assessed whether longer hospice stays were associated with better
family-reported outcomes among hospice enrollees.
METHODS
Dataset
Data came from the CanCORS I and II studies, which enrolled
participants from 2003 through 2005 and followed patients or family
through 2011. CanCORS enrolled patients with newly diagnosed lung or
colorectal cancers from five regions (northern California; Los Angeles
County, California; North Carolina; Iowa; and Alabama), five integrated
health systems, and 15 Veterans Affairs hospitals.16 CanCORS participants
were representative of patients diagnosed with lung or colorectal cancer in
the US regions covered by the SEER program.17
Trained staff interviewed participants (or a family member or close
friend, if the patient was too ill or had died) in English, Spanish, or Chinese,
using computer-assisted telephone software at three time points after di-
agnosis: (1) approximately 4 to 6 months, (2) 1 year (for patients alive at the
first interview), and (3) 5 to 7 years later (for patients alive 1 year after di-
agnosis). The study was approved by the institutional review boards at all sites.
Cohort
The study cohort included participants with advanced-stage lung or
colorectal cancer at diagnosis or recurrence who died by 2011 and whose
family or close friend participated in a postdeath interview. For patients
deceased at the time of initial study contact, the next of kin was invited to
participate. Patients who were alive for the first interview were asked to identify
a primary family member or friend “familiar with your care since diagnosis”
and a secondary respondent (in case the first could not be reached). Because
95% of interviews were completed by family (eg, spouse/partner, child) we
refer to respondents as family. The final cohort included 2,307 decedents.
Outcome Variables
Outcomes of interest included family members’ perceptions of pa-
tients’ symptom prevalence and control, concordance of EOL care with
patients’ preferences, and quality of EOL care. Specifically, we examined
symptom burden (ie, pain or dyspnea), symptom control, overall quality of
EOL care, and goal attainment (ie, whether patients’ EOL wishes were
followed and whether they died in their preferred place).
To assess symptoms, family members were asked whether, in the last
days to weeks of life, patients had “pain or took pain medication” (yes/no) or
had “shortness of breath” (yes/no). Family members who affirmed the
presence of pain or dyspnea were asked the following: “How much medicine
did the patient receive for his/her pain?” and/or “How much help...with his/
her breathing did the patient receive?” Response options included “less than
he/she wanted,” “just the right amount,” and “more than he/she wanted.”
We examined concordance with patients’ previously stated wishes for
EOL care, asking the family: “During the last month of life, did he/she prefer
a course of treatment that focused on extending life as much as possible, even
if it meant more pain and discomfort, or on a plan that focused on relieving
pain and discomfort as much as possible, even if that meant not living as
long?” Next, family members were asked: “To what extent were these wishes
followed in the medical treatment he/she received during the last month of
life?” Response options included: “a great deal,” “somewhat,” “not at all,”
“don’t know,” or “refused.” We defined concordance as family who responded
“a great deal” to this question. We also assessed the concordance between the
patients’ previously stated preferred place of death (reported by family) and
where patients actually died. We defined concordance as patients whose actual
place of death matched their preferred place. Family members also rated the
overall quality of care received by patients in the last place where they spent
$ 48 hours before death (rating options were excellent, very good, good, fair,
or poor). We defined high-quality EOL care as care that was rated excellent.
Independent Variables
Receipt of hospice was assessed by asking the family whether the
patient ever received hospice care (yes/no). The family reported the du-
ration of hospice services received, categorized as # 3 days, 4 to 7 days, 8 to
30 days, or . 30 days before death. We compared # 3 days of hospice
services with longer stays because prior studies suggested that short hospice
stays are associated with worse patient quality of life and EOL care,
compared with longer durations.2,5
Additional Baseline Covariates
Sociodemographic characteristics and treatment preferences. In the
baseline survey, patients or their family reported sex, age at death, race/
ethnicity, marital status, whether English was spoken at home, education,
income, and insurance.
Clinical covariates. Cancer type and stage at diagnosis data were
obtained from the medical record or, if unavailable, from cancer registries.
The family reported patients’ smoking status, comorbid medical condi-
tions, and receipt of cancer-directed surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation.
We also documented the region where patients resided and whether they
received treatment within an integrated health-care system.
Statistical Analysis
We compared, with descriptive statistics, sociodemographic and
clinical characteristics between patients who did or did not receive hospice
care. We examined family-reported outcomes by hospice enrollment after
using propensity score matching to balance measurable confounders be-
tween those who received hospice and those who did not.18 We used logistic
regression to assess patient factors associated with hospice and then matched
nonhospice enrollees with hospice enrollees based on their estimated
propensity of hospice enrollment using 1:1 matching via a greedy algorithm
with a caliper of 0.20. Standardized differences in observable characteristics
of the matched cohort were # 7% (Appendix Table A1, online only).
We compared relief of EOL symptoms, concordance with family-
reported patient EOL preferences, and family-reported quality of EOL care,
using separate logistic regression models among the propensity-matched
cohort. We fit linear-binomial models with an identity link to estimate
adjusted differences in the likelihood of each outcome.19
In a second set of analyses among patients enrolled in hospice, we
examined associations between each of the dependent variables and
hospice length of stay (categorized with indicator variables as # 3 days, 4 to
7 days, 8 to 30 days, . 30 days), while adjusting for all the covariates
described. We calculated adjusted rates for each outcome by hospice
duration, using # 3 days as the reference category.
Missing data on outcomes varied between 1% (quality of EOL care) and
19% (EOLwishes); missing data for covariates ranged between 1% (stage) and
15% (income). We used multiple imputation methods to create five complete
data sets, imputing values for missing outcomes and covariates, and repeated
all analyses on each imputed data set, combining results using standard
methods for multiple imputed data for our primary analysis.20,21 Sensitivity
analyses were conducted to examine associations between hospice and each
outcome in a second sample without imputation of outcome data. Because
patients with lung and colorectal cancer may differ, we repeated analyses
stratified by disease site tested for the interaction of hospice and disease site.
Two-sided P values , .05 were considered statistically significant; analyses
were performed using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Among 3,737 participants with advanced-stage cancer at diagnosis
or recurrence, 2,307 had an after-death family interview and were
included in the cohort. These individuals were older, less educated,
and had more advanced-stage disease and comorbid medical
conditions than participants without an after-death interview; they

Kumar et al
 also received fewer cancer-directed therapies (Appendix Table A2,
online only).
Among these 2,307 participants, 1,257 (55%) enrolled in
hospice before death. Those enrolled in hospice were more likely to
be non-Hispanic white (81% v 68%; P , .001), speak English at
home (94% v 89%; P , .001), and receive care in an integrated
health system (36% v 28%; P , .001) than those who did not
receive hospice (Table 1). They were also more likely to have
a family-reported preference for pain relief over life extension
(76% v 61%; P , .001), and less likely to have received surgery
(29% v 34%; P = .005) or chemotherapy (56% v 60%; P = .04).
Family-Reported Outcomes by Hospice Enrollment
Among the 1,050 patients who did not enroll in hospice, 985
were matched with a patient who was enrolled in hospice, resulting
in a final cohort of 1,970 patients (985 matched pairs; Table 1). In
adjusted analyses (Table 2), families of patients who received hospice
care were more likely to report pain or use of pain medication,
compared with those not receiving hospice (91% v 81%; adjusted
difference, 10 percentage points; 95% CI, 7 to 13 percentage points).
Among those who reported symptoms, families of patients enrolled
in hospice were more likely to report that patients received “just the
right amount of pain medicine” (80% v 73%; adjusted difference,
7 percentage points; 95% CI, 1 to 12 percentage points) and “just the
right amount of help with breathing” (78% v 70%; adjusted dif-
ference, 8 percentage points; 95% CI, 2 to 13 percentage points),
compared with those not enrolled in hospice. They were also less
likely to report receiving “too little pain medicine” (8% v 11%;
adjusted difference, 3 percentage points; 95% CI, 0 to 6 percentage
points) or “less help with breathing than wanted” (12% v 18%;
adjusted difference, 6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2 to 11 percentage
points). Families of hospice enrollees were not more likely to report
that patients received “too much pain medicine.”
Families of patients enrolled in hospice were more likely to
report that patients’ EOL wishes were followed “a great deal” (80%
v 74%; adjusted difference, 6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2 to 11
percentage points). Decedents who received hospice care were also
more likely to die in their preferred place (68% v 39%; adjusted
difference, 29 percentage points; 95% CI, 23 to 34 percentage
points). Families also reported excellent quality of EOL care more
often for patients who received hospice (57% v 42%; adjusted
difference, 15 percentage points; 95% CI, 11 to 20; Table 2),
compared with those who did not.
Family-Reported Outcomes by Hospice Length of Stay
Among the 1,257 patients enrolled in hospice, the median
length of enrollment was 21 days (interquartile range, 7 to 56 days).
Overall, longer hospice stays were associated with family perceptions
that patients received “just the right amount of pain medication,”
greater patient-goal attainment, and higher rates of family-reported
excellent quality of EOL care, compared with short stays (Table 3; Fig
1). Specifically, families of patients who received . 30 days of
hospice care more often reported “just the right amount of pain
medicine” than those enrolled # 3 days (85% v 76%; adjusted
difference, 9 percentage points; 95% CI, 2 to 16). Similarly, families
of patients who received $ 8 days of hospice less often reported that
patients received “too little pain medicine” compared with those
enrolled # 3 days; findings were similar when comparing . 30 days
with # 3 days of hospice. Family-reported help with dyspnea did not
vary by hospice duration.
Families of patients who received . 30 days of hospice more
often reported that patients’ EOL wishes were followed “a great
deal” compared with patients enrolled # 3 days (87% v 79%;
adjusted difference, 8 percentage points; 95% CI, 1 to 15) and more
often rated the quality of EOL care “excellent” (65% v 50%; ad-
justed difference, 15 percentage points; 95% CI, 6 to 23). The
longer patients were enrolled in hospice, the more likely they were
to die in their preferred place.

 with missing values for dependent variables. The results were
consistent with the main findings except that associations between
hospice and “EOL wishes followed a great deal” no longer reached
statistical significance (data not shown). Results were also similar
when stratified by cancer type (P $ .09 for interaction between
hospice and cancer type for all outcomes; data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In this large, population-based cohort study of patients with
advanced-stage cancer and high symptom burden, family members
of patients enrolled in hospice were more likely to report that
patients received “just the right” level of help with pain and
dyspnea—not “too much,” or “too little.” Hospice use was also
associated with higher rates of family-reported patient-goal at-
tainment and quality of EOL care. In addition, patients who re-
ceived . 30 days of hospice were more likely to receive optimal pain
management, care that was congruent with their wishes, and care
that family described as of “excellent” quality, compared with pa-
tients enrolled for # 3 days. Together, our findings suggest that
encouraging hospice enrollment, particularly enrollment weeks
before death, may improve EOL experiences of patients with cancer.
To date, relatively few studies have examined bereaved family
members’ perspectives on hospice care in population-based co-
horts. We found that fewer than half of family members reported
“excellent” quality of EOL care and nearly one-quarter felt that
patients’ EOL wishes were not followed a “great deal.” These results
demonstrate that a substantial proportion of patients with cancer
have unmet needs close to death. Our examination of the prev-
alence and relief of symptoms by receipt of hospice services extends
findings from earlier studies,7,22 demonstrating that although
patients enrolled in hospice have more symptoms, their symptoms
are better controlled overall. Of note, the families of patients
enrolled in hospice were not more likely to report that patients
received “too much” pain medicine; rather, they were more likely
to report that patients received “just the right amount.”
A unique feature of this study was our ability to examine the
relationship between the length of hospice enrollment and several
important patient- and family-centered EOL outcomes, while
adjusting for patients’ treatment preferences. Existing quality
measures, endorsed by the National Quality Forum and ASCO,
identify # 3 days and # 7 days of hospice services as poor-quality
EOL care.23,24 Consistent with this, one prior study demonstrated
that patients who received , 1 week of hospice care reported
similar quality EOL care to those not receiving hospice.2 In our

Family Perspectives on Hospice Care
 study, the families of patients who received . 8 days of hospice care
were more likely to report that patients died in their preferred place
and less likely to report inadequate pain control, compared with
# 3 days. However, . 70% of patients with lung or colorectal cancer
experienced difficulty breathing, and relief of dyspnea did not vary
by hospice length of stay; future studies should examine strategies to
manage dyspnea more effectively. Additionally, we observed few
differences between patients with very short stays (# 3 days) and
moderately short stays (4 to 7 or 8 to 30 days); the best outcomes
were generally seen in patients who received . 30 days of hospice.
Although early hospice enrollment may not be possible for all
patients,10 our data suggest that more attention should be focused
on efforts to enroll patients with cancer into hospice earlier because
the median length of stay for patients enrolled in hospice care in
the United States is only 17.4 days.25 The requirement to forego
cancer-directed therapy remains a major barrier to early hospice
referral26,27; however, early palliative care is associated with earlier
discontinuation of chemotherapy and hospice referrals, without
impacting the number of chemotherapy regimens received.28
Our study had some limitations. Although CanCORS par-
ticipants were representative of patients diagnosed with lung and
colorectal cancers in SEER regions,17 our findings may not be
generalizable to patients with other cancers or those without in-
volved family caregivers. In addition, although we measured and
adjusted for many of the patient and caregiver characteristics that
influence hospice enrollment (eg, treatment preferences), other
confounding influences may not have been measured (eg, we
lacked information about patients’ rate of functional decline and
referring providers, both of which influence the intensity of EOL
care provided).29,30 Moreover, patients with long hospice length of
stays may differ from patients with shorter stays in ways that we
could not measure. The data are older, particularly for patients who
died soon after diagnosis. However, recent evidence demonstrates
that EOL care remains intensive3,22,31; thus, patients’ and family
members’ experiences are likely to be similar today. Finally, we
relied on family members’ reports of patients’ preferred and actual
place of death to determine goal attainment.
Despite these limitations, our study has many strengths. The
study population included patients of all ages (36% were , 65
years of age) with a wide range of insurance types, which has
previously been associated with hospice lengths of stay.32 It also
included patients who recurred with advanced cancer and may
have different experiences near death than patients with advanced
cancer at diagnosis.
In conclusion, despite a higher symptom burden among
patients enrolled in hospice, hospice care was associated with
better symptom management, patient-goal attainment, and
quality of EOL care. In addition, patients who received . 30 days
of hospice care had the best family-reported EOL outcomes,
compared with those who received # 3 days. Together, these
results suggest that current EOL care quality measures may be too
narrowly focused on increasing hospice enrollment to . 3 or
. 7 days of services. Future studies should examine whether
multifaceted approaches (eg, early palliative care referrals,33
sensitive provision of information about hospice care early in
the disease course, and an audit and feedback system to monitor
physicians’ rates and timing of hospice referrals) might result in
the provision of more preference-sensitive, high-quality, and
value-based EOL care for patients with cancer. Future studies
should also examine the impact of cancer immunotherapy on the
timing of hospice referral; although these therapies are often less
toxic than chemotherapy, they may be increasingly used in the last
weeks of life.34
