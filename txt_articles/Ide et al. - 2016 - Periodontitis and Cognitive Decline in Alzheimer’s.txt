Abstract
Periodontitis is common in the elderly and may become more common in Alzheimer’s dis-
ease because of a reduced ability to take care of oral hygiene as the disease progresses.
Elevated antibodies to periodontal bacteria are associated with an increased systemic pro-
inflammatory state. Elsewhere raised serum pro-inflammatory cytokines have been associ-
ated with an increased rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease. We hypothesized
that periodontitis would be associated with increased dementia severity and a more rapid
cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease. We aimed to determine if periodontitis in Alzhei-
mer’s disease is associated with both increased dementia severity and cognitive decline,
and an increased systemic pro inflammatory state. In a six month observational cohort
study 60 community dwelling participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s Disease were
cognitively assessed and a blood sample taken for systemic inflammatory markers. Dental
health was assessed by a dental hygienist, blind to cognitive outcomes. All assessments
were repeated at six months. The presence of periodontitis at baseline was not related to
baseline cognitive state but was associated with a six fold increase in the rate of cognitive
decline as assessed by the ADAS-cog over a six month follow up period. Periodontitis at
baseline was associated with a relative increase in the pro-inflammatory state over the six
month follow up period. Our data showed that periodontitis is associated with an increase in
cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s Disease, independent to baseline cognitive state, which
may be mediated through effects on systemic inflammation.

 Introduction
Periodontal disease is widespread in the UK population and typical of most other westernized
countries including North America[1]. In older age groups it is believed to be a major cause of
tooth loss. In the UK in 1998, only 38% of adults aged over 65 had 21 or more of their original
32 teeth with 50% of these reporting periodontitis before they lost teeth[2]. A number of stud-
ies show that having few teeth, possibly as a consequence of earlier periodontitis, is associated
with an increase risk of developing dementia [3].
Periodontitis has been shown to be associated with a raised serum pro-inflammatory state
as shown by increases in C Reactive Protein (CRP) [4] and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g.
Tumour Necrosis Factor α (TNFα)) with a reduction in anti-inflammatory markers (e.g. inter-
leukin 10 (IL 10)) [5]. Chewing on involved teeth may lead to the introduction of periodontal
bacteria shown by detectable amounts of serum bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [6,7]. In
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) periodontitis may be even more common because of a reduced abil-
ity to take care of oral hygiene as the disease progresses and in AD increased elevation of serum
levels of antibodies with associated increases in TNFα have been reported [8]. We have previ-
ously shown that chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with increased systemic pro-
inflammatory cytokines and an increased rate of cognitive decline in AD [9]. We hypothesised
that periodontitis would increase with increasing dementia severity in AD but that periodonti-
tis would be associated with an increased rate of cognitive decline independent of the degree of
dementia severity. We further hypothesised that periodontitis would be associated with a rela-
tive increase in systemic measures of the pro-inflammatory state and a decrease in anti-inflam-
matory state.
Material and Methods
Study design
60 non smoking community dwelling participants (and their caregivers) with mild to moderate
dementia and a minimum of 10 teeth who had not received treatment for periodontitis in the
past 6 months, were recruited during the period August 2012 to August 2013 from clinical
referrals to memory assessment services in Southampton, United Kingdom. All participants in
this study had to have capacity to give consent for themselves following United Kingdom Med-
ical Research Council guidance http://www.mrc.ac.uk/documents/pdf/medical-research-
involving-adults-who-cannot-consent/. A surrogate consent procedure was not used. As part
of the assessment of capacity a trained psychiatrist explained orally and in writing the nature,
duration, and purpose of the study so that the participant was aware of the potential risks,
inconveniences, or adverse effects that may occur. All participants in this study were consid-
ered to understand this information; to weigh up the information and retain it for long enough
to make a decision as to whether to take part. All participants communicated this decision by
signing the participants information sheet and consent form. The participants capacity to con-
sent was monitored throughout the study and any participants considered to have lost this
capacity were withdrawn.
Participants fulfilled National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and
Stroke-Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria for
probable or possible AD [10] with a modified Hachinski Ischaemic Scale score [11] of greater
than 4 points and all had been on a stable cholinesterase inhibitor for at least 6 months. Partici-
pants were cognitively tested using the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog) [12]
as the primary cognitive outcome and the standardized Mini-Mental State Examination
(sMMSE) [13] as a secondary cognitive outcome. Immediately following cognitive assessment

 at baseline a venous blood sample was taken for CRP, the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα,
the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 and for antibodies to P.gingivalis. The participants’ dental
health (number of teeth and measures of periodontitis including the number of sites (6 sites
per tooth) with plaque scores assessed as grade 2 (plaque identifiable without the need for a
dental probe) and grade 1 (plaque identifiable using a dental probe), pocket depth in millime-
ters per site and the number of sites showing bleeding on probing was assessed by an accredited
research dental hygienist. These assessments are all used to determine the presence or absence
of periodontitis following established Centre for Disease Control/American Academy of Peri-
odontology (CDC/AAP) case definitions [14]. The participants’ main caregiver, defined as a
caregiver spending at least 10 hours per week with the participant, was interviewed to assess
medical and dental history including treatment for periodontitis and medication use over the
previous 6 months. The participant and main caregiver were reviewed at six months and reas-
sessed in an identical manner.
Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents
This study received approval from the South and West Hampshire Local Research Ethics Com-
mittee (11/SC/0422). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients participating in
the study.
Serum inflammation, antibody and DNA assays
All blood samples were centrifuged and sera aliquotted on ice and stored at -80°C within 2
hours. Levels of CRP, TNFα and IL-10 were assayed using sandwich immunoassay multi-plex
cytokine assay (Meso Scale Discovery (MSD). A protocol provided by MSD for custom assays
was used with no major modifications. Serum IgG antibody titre to P.gingivalis was determined
by direct binding Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. Heat killed P.gingvalis (Invivogen)
was coated onto 96 well maxisorp plates at a concentration of 108 cells/ml. The plates were
washed five times with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) 0.05% tween, and blocked with 1%
PBS Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). Patient serum samples were added at a dilution of 1:125 in
PBS 1% BSA and incubated for 90 minutes. After washing five times, goat anti-human IgG
(Sigma) was added at a dilution of 1:40,000 in PBS 1% BSA, and incubated for 60 minutes.
Bound IgG was detected using Tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) as a substrate, and the reaction
was stopped using 1M H2SO4 before reading optical density at 450nm. Blood for DNA (princi-
pally APOE genotype) was taken at baseline. APOE genotypes were determined by Taqman
genotyping of SNP rs7412 and KASP genotyping of SNP rs429358.
Statistical analysis
Assessment of normality of continuous variables was determined by quantile-quantile plots of
the residuals. Baseline ADAS-COG, sMMSE; IL10; TNFα; optical density to IgG antibodies to
P. gingivalis and changes in ADAS-COG; sMMSE and TNFα were normally distributed. Base-
line serum CRP; and changes in CRP and IL10 levels were not normally distributed. Baseline
comparisons were made using t tests and Mann-Whitney tests for continuous variables,
depending on whether normally distributed or not. For categorical variables, Chi squared tests
were used. Comparisons between the two groups were made using linear regression, with
adjustment for potential confounding factors of age; gender and baseline cognitive score
(ADAS-COG or sMMSE). Previous studies have suggested that around half of participants in
this age group would have periodontitis. Power calculations of 52 participants completing the
study were based on statistical evidence to suggest that a sample size of 26 patients per group is
an optimum figure for a pilot study of this nature [15,16]. Assuming a standard deviation

 change of 5 points this study size gave us 80% power to detect a meaningful clinical difference
effect size of 4 points change in the ADAS-COG over a 6 months period (α = 0.05). The
unequal ratio between groups found in the study (1.7) meant that a total of 56 subjects were
needed for the same effect size and power. Allowing for a 10–20% drop out rate this required
the recruitment of 57 to 65 participants. In this pilot study we made no explicit allowance for
multiplicity of testing, and therefore make no claims about significance where an adjustment of
the type I error rate (e.g. Bonferroni) would lead to a given p-value no longer reaching statisti-
cal significance. Multivariate analysis was used to adjust for possible confounding effects of
age, gender and baseline cognitive status.
Results
Baseline data
Following consent procedures one participant was found to be an intermittent smoker and was
excluded from further involvement in the study. Of the 59 participants remaining all fulfilled
NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable or possible AD and all had a modified. Hachinski
Ischaemic Scale score of greater than four points.
Baseline demographics, dental health measures and cognition
The mean age of the cohort at baseline was 77.7 (s.d. 8.6) years. 30 (51%) participants were
men.
89.0 (s.d. 12.5) % participants had detectable plaque of whom 19.9 (s.d. 11.8) % had plaque
identifiable without the need for a dental probe (grade 1) and 69.1 (s.d. 20.6) % participants
had identifiable plaque using a dental probe (grade 2). The mean probing depth was 2.5 (s.d.
0.4) mm per participant with 6.7 [IQR 2.5 to 13.6] % of sites probing greater than 3mm. 13.6
[IQR 7.6 to 21.5] % of gingival sites showed bleeding on probing. Examination of the variables
for plaque; probing depth and bleeding sites resulted in the classification of 22 (37.3%) partici-
pants fulfilling CDC/AAP criteria for the presence of periodontitis of whom 15 (25.4)% had
moderate and 7 (11.9%) had severe periodontitis. At baseline participants had a mean number
of 21.9 (s.d. 5.2) teeth, ranging from 10 to 32 teeth present.
At baseline participants had a mean ADAS-COG score of 46.2 (s.d. 12.3) points and a mean
sMMSE score of 20.4 (s.d. 5.0) points.
Table 1 shows the relationship between the presence of periodontitis and baseline demo-
graphics (age and gender); other dental measures (number of teeth and P. gingivalis antibody
levels) and cognitive scores (ADAS-COG and sMMSE). Patients with periodontitis were youn-
ger and had more teeth.

 Longitudinal follow up
Fifty two of 59 (88%) participants completed follow up at 6 months. One participant died; 3
participants declined follow up and 3 participants were lost to follow up. At 6 month follow up
15 (75%) of the 20 subjects fulfilling CDC/AAP criteria for periodontitis at baseline still ful-
filled these criteria whilst 30 (94%) of the 32 subjects not fulfilling these criteria at baseline con-
tinued to not fulfil these criteria. The mean change in the ADAS-cog was 2.9 (s.d. 6.6) pts. The
mean change in the sMMSE score was -1.4 (s.d. 3.2) pts.
The relationship between the presence of periodontitis at baseline and cognitive decline
over the six month follow up period is shown in Table 2.
There was a significant difference in the rate of change in the ADAS-cog score and the pres-
ence or absence of periodontitis at baseline which remained following adjustment for baseline
age, gender and baseline ADAS-cog score. There was also a significant relationship between
the presence of periodontitis and change in sMMSE score but this was not significant when
adjusting for baseline age, gender or baseline sMMSE score.
There was no significant association between the rate of decline on the sMMSE score and
with the number of teeth at baseline (Pearson -0.1 p = 0.4) but there was a significant associa-
tion with the rate of decline on the ADAS-cog score (Pearson 0.35 p = 0.01). However, this
relationship was no longer significant when adjusting for the presence of periodontitis at base-
line (adjusted correlation 0.25 p = 0.07).
There was no significant association between baseline serum P. Gingivalis antibody levels
and the rate of decline on the ADAS-cog score (Pearson -0.03 p = 0.9) or rate of decline on the
sMMSE score (Pearson -0.2 p = 0.1).
Systemic inflammatory markers
54 (92%) participants gave consent for blood sampling for peripheral inflammatory markers
(CRP, TNFα, IL10) and DNA for ApoE genotyping at baseline.
Baseline serum levels and relationships with baseline demographics and cognitive and den-
tal measures are shown in Table 3.
There were no significant relationships between baseline systemic inflammatory markers
and demographic; cognitive or dental measures.
31 (54%) participants carried the ApoE e4 allele. There were no significant relationships
between carriers of the ApoE e4 allele and dental measures including the presence or absence
of periodontitis (32% participants with the e4 allele compared with 43% participants without
the e4 allele had periodontitis X2 0.7 p = 0.4).
43 of the 52 (83%) participants who agreed to follow up gave a blood sample for peripheral
inflammatory markers (CRP, TNFα, IL10) at six month follow up. Changes in serum levels
and relationships with baseline dental measures are shown in Table 4.

 No significant relationships were found with number of teeth and changes in serum inflam-
matory markers. However, the presence of periodontitis at baseline was associated with a fall in
serum IL10 levels, and serum baseline P. gingivalis antibody levels were also associated with a
fall in serum IL10 levels and an increase in serum TNFα levels.
Discussion
A number of studies have shown that patients with AD have poorer dental health than aged
controls and that the more severe the dementia the worse the dental health [17,18], most likely
reflecting increasing difficulties with self care in more severe dementia [19,20]. We did not find
a clear relationship between severity of dementia and degree of periodontitis, most likely
reflecting the absence of subjects with severe dementia in the study. However, no studies to
date have examined whether, in a longitudinal study, poor dental health correlates with poorer
cognitive outcomes that are independent to baseline cognitive state. This study shows that in

 AD poor dental health, and in particular, the presence of periodontitis, is associated with a
marked increase in cognitive decline over a six month follow up period, independent to base-
line cognitive state. As anticipated baseline periodontal state appeared largely stable over the
six month period, although there was some improvement in some participant’s most likely
reflecting heightened awareness of the potential importance of oral care due to participation in
the study.
A number of reasons might be given for the relationship between periodontitis and
increased cognitive decline. Firstly, the small numbers of participants in this study cannot rule
out that the relationship is due to chance and the study needs to be replicated. Secondly, it is
possible that participants with a more precipitous rate of cognitive decline become more sus-
ceptible to periodontitis through an unknown mechanism that is independent to the degree of
cognitive impairment or, thirdly, that periodontitis is a reflection of a confounding factor such
as a compromised or modified inflammatory or immune response that is also a driver of AD
progression. On the other hand, periodontitis may be a direct driver of disease progression.
The presence of periodontitis is determined by the examination of sites around teeth and thus
the positive relationship between periodontitis and higher number of teeth was expected. How-
ever, the lack of relationship between low tooth number, a possible indicator of past periodon-
titis, and cognitive decline suggests that active chronic periodontitis is most important in
driving cognitive decline once AD is established. A number of studies have suggested that peri-
odontitis is associated with higher amyloid precursor protein expression [21] and higher amy-
loid loads in the elderly [22]. In addition other studies have shown that antibodies to common
periodontal microbiota [23,24] or tooth loss [3,25] caused by chronic periodontitis, might pre-
cede the development of AD by many years. We did not find a significant relationship between
serum baseline P. gingivalis antibody levels and rates of cognitive decline. The relationship may
require the additional role of other periodontal organisms or it may be that in some individuals
antibody levels to P. gingivalis reflect exposure to the organism which hasn’t resulted in peri-
odontal disease.
The mechanism for the relationship between periodontitis and cognitive decline is still
unclear but there is increasing evidence to support a role for systemic inflammation. Thus,
cross sectional studies have shown that the presence of periodontitis, or antibodies to com-
mon periodontal bacterial flora, are associated with an increase in a systemic proinflamma-
tory state characterized by an increase in serum CRP; TNFα [8] and TNFα/IL10 ratios [26] in
participants with AD. We have previously shown that AD patients with a range of acute and
chronic inflammatory conditions have an increased pro-inflammatory cytokine profile that is
associated with an increased rate of cognitive decline [9]. In this current study we show evi-
dence of a relative increase in the proinflammatory state and decrease in the anti-inflamma-
tory state over a six month follow up period in AD participants with periodontitis. A similar
association was found between pro-inflammatory state and the presence of IgG antibodies to
P gingivalis, generally associated with the presence of periodontitis. If, as this current study
suggests, there is a direct relationship between periodontitis and cognitive decline then treat-
ment of periodontitis might be a possible treatment option in AD. Encouragingly a small
study of periodontal treatment [27], in AD participants suggest that there may be some cog-
nitive benefits to this approach supporting the need for a randomized trial to test this
hypothesis.
