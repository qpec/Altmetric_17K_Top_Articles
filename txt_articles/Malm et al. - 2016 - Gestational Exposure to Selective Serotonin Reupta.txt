Abstract
Objective—To investigate the impact of gestational exposure to selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) on offspring neurodevelopment.
Method—This is a cohort study using national register data in Finland between the years 
1996-2010. Pregnant women and their offspring were categorized into four groups: SSRI exposed 
(n=15,729); exposed to psychiatric disorder, no antidepressants (n=9,651); exposed to SSRIs only 
before pregnancy (n=7,980); and unexposed to antidepressants and psychiatric disorders 
(n=31,394). We investigated the cumulative incidence of offspring diagnoses of depression,

 anxiety, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) 
for the four groups from birth to 14 years, adjusting for confounders.
Results—The cumulative incidence of depression among offspring exposed prenatally to SSRIs 
was 8.2% (95% CI, 3.1-13.3%) by age 14.9, compared to 1.9% (95% CI, 0.9-2.9%) in the 
psychiatric disorder, no medication group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.78; 95% CI, 1.12-2.82; 
p=.02) and to 2.8% (95% CI, 1.4-4.3%) in the SSRI discontinued group (HR 1.84; 95% CI, 
1.14-2.97; p=.01). Rates of anxiety, ASD, and ADHD diagnoses were comparable to rates in 
offspring of mothers with a psychiatric disorder but no medication during pregnancy. Comparing 
SSRI exposed to unexposed, the HRs were significantly elevated for each outcome.
Conclusion—Prenatal SSRI exposure was associated with increased rates of depression 
diagnoses in early adolescence but not with ASD or ADHD. Until confirmed, these findings must 
be balanced against the substantial adverse consequences of untreated maternal depression.

Introduction
Exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during sensitive developmental 
periods in rodents produces long-lasting effects on behavior, neural circuitry, morphology, 
and physiology.1-3 Importantly, the developmental period during which rodents are sensitive 
to the effects of SSRI exposure overlaps extensively with human brain development during 
the fetal period. Because the serotonin (5HT) system is highly conserved across phylogeny, 
we suspected that similar effects might be seen in humans as SSRIs pass readily through the 
placenta and enter fetal circulation.4 SSRIs have been prescribed increasingly to pregnant 
women since their introduction 30 years ago.5,6 Yet no studies have been undertaken that 
followed children beyond 6 years of age for depressive disorders, which typically emerge 
after the onset of puberty.7, 8 Research on associations between SSRI exposure and other 
neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has shown inconsistent results.9-14
The potential effect of prenatal SSRI exposure on vulnerability to later life disorders is 
confounded by maternal and paternal mental illness that would increase the risk of 
neuropsychiatric diagnoses in these children. To address these potential confounds and to 
better address the long-term safety of SSRI use during pregnancy for the offspring, we 
performed a large population-based study to investigate the effect of prenatal exposure to 
SSRIs, or maternal depression-related psychiatric disorders without medication, on offspring 
neurodevelopment through 14 years of age. Because of the steadily increasing use of SSRIs 
during pregnancy and the potential long-term burden of offspring depression and anxiety, 
this question carries substantial public health importance.

 Method
Data Sources and Study Population
We used a population-based, prospective cohort study design. All data were collected from 
national registers linked by the unique personal identification number assigned to all citizens 
and permanent residents of Finland. In Finland, all children regularly attend child welfare 
clinics where trained public health nurses or physicians perform medical examinations; this 
is offered to all and is free of charge. These services are particularly designed to identify 
psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Annual examinations are performed for all 
school children and, when indicated, a referral is made to specialized health care; these 
conditions are then recorded in the inpatient and outpatient registries. Specialized care 
includes hospital outpatient clinics and inpatient hospital units that are run by specialists. 
Psychiatric services are run by psychiatrists, who are required to have a six-year 
postdoctoral specialist education. A detailed description of the registers and the study design 
has been published previously.5
The total sampling frame includes 845,345 singleton live births in Finland between January 
1, 1996 and December 31, 2010. Accordingly, the age range of children in the study cohort 
is from birth to age 14. The mother–child dyads were identified from the national Medical 
Birth Register (MBR). The register collects data on maternal demographics, reproductive 
and medical history, health-related behaviors, diagnoses during pregnancy and delivery, and 
neonatal outcome since 1987, using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th 
Revision (ICD-10) coding since 1996.
The Drug Reimbursement Register, maintained since 1995, collects data on prescription 
drug purchases and was used to identify the study groups. Drug purchases are recorded 
concomitantly with the purchase at pharmacies using the International Anatomic-
Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) classification, and drugs are supplied for a maximum of three 
months at a time. The Special Reimbursement Register contains data on chronic illnesses 
requiring continuous medication since 1964.
The Hospital Discharge Register (HDR) includes inpatient diagnoses covering all somatic 
and psychiatric hospitals in Finland since 1969, and outpatient diagnoses in public hospitals 
since 1998. The diagnoses are coded using the ICD-8 (1969–1986), ICD-9 (1987–1995), and 
ICD-10 since 1996. Information on parental psychiatric diagnoses (ICD-8, ICD-9 and 
ICD-10), and diagnoses of neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring (ICD-10) were derived 
from this register. Patients treated solely in public primary or in private care are not included 
in this register.
The national population register contains basic information, including country of birth, 
marital status, marriages and divorces, and deaths of all Finnish citizens and other citizens 
residing permanently in Finland.
The register administrators and the data protection authority approved the utilization of 
sensitive health registry data for scientific research and the data linkages. The Institutional 
Ethical Review Board at the National Institute for Health and Welfare, the Social Insurance

 Institution in Finland, and the Institutional Review Board of the New York State Psychiatric 
Institute approved the study protocol. All data were anonymized and de-identified prior to 
analysis. The study participants were not contacted and, according to Finnish legislation, 
informed consent was therefore not required.
Exposure Groups, Mother–Child Dyads
SSRI Exposed, n=15,729—Mothers in this group had one or more purchases of SSRIs 
(fluoxetine, citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, escitalopram) during the period 
from 30 days before pregnancy until the end of pregnancy; the date of purchase indicated the 
beginning date for each exposure. The beginning of gestation corresponding to the last 
menstrual period was calculated from the best clinical estimation of gestational age at birth, 
primarily based on ultrasound and MBR registration. Information on diagnosis of depression 
or depression-related diagnoses was available for 4,811 (30.6%) mothers in this group; that 
is mothers, who had been treated in inpatient care or outpatient specialized care, and 
accordingly had a diagnosis in the HDR.
Among the mothers with diagnoses available in the register, 4,713 (98.0%) had a diagnosis 
related to affective disorders (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder), and 265 (5.5%) had a 
diagnosis of non-affective or undefined psychosis.
The mutually exclusive comparison cohorts included:
Psychiatric disorder, no medication group (n=9,651)—This group was exposed to 
maternal psychiatric diagnosis but no SSRI during pregnancy. This group included all 
mothers who had a diagnosis of depression or other psychiatric disorder related to 
depression or SSRI use, obtained from the HDR (ICD-10 F20-F48; ICD-9 295-298, 300) 
from one year before pregnancy until discharge (≤ 3 weeks) from hospital after delivery, and 
no purchases of antidepressants (ATC codes N06A, N06CA) or antipsychotics (N05A) from 
three months before until the end of pregnancy. A total of 9,407 (97.5%) of mothers had a 
diagnosis related to affective disorders, and 424 (4.4%) had a diagnosis of non-affective or 
undefined psychosis.
SSRI Discontinued Group (n=7,980)—This group was exposed to SSRIs only prior to 
pregnancy. Mothers had one or more purchases of SSRIs during one year before pregnancy 
until three months before pregnancy but no purchases of antidepressant or antipsychotic 
drugs during three months before pregnancy until delivery.
Unexposed (n=31,394)—This group was unexposed to SSRIs and had no diagnosis of 
depression or other psychiatric disorder related to depression or SSRI use. This group 
included mothers with neither purchases of antidepressants nor antipsychotics, and no 
depression or related psychiatric disorder at any time prior to or during pregnancy. Two 
unexposed per 1 participant exposed to SSRI were matched for offspring date of birth within 
+/-6 months.

 Outcome Variables
The outcome variables included: 1) depression, including depressive disorders and 
unspecified affective disorders (ICD-10 F32-39); 2) anxiety, including anxiety disorder 
(F40-41); 3) autism spectrum disorder, (ASD; F84, but excluding Rett's syndrome, F84.2); 
4) attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; F90). Only ICD codes used after the 
diagnosis was established (ICD-10 F-codes for psychiatric disorders) were included; codes 
used in the evaluation process (ICD-10 Z-codes) were excluded. We excluded those with a 
depression diagnosis only during the first two years of life if the diagnosis was not recorded 
at later stages.
Covariates
Data on covariates were derived from the registers described above and are delineated in 
Table 1. While the register data have high coverage for most covariates, data on 
socioeconomic status (SES) are recorded less accurately. The SES classification is based on 
maternal occupation, and nearly one third of participants were classified as “others,” 
including students, housewives, entrepreneurs, and those who were unemployed.
Statistical Analyses
Clinically relevant and plausible covariates were first tested (Table 1). Sex was included in 
all adjusted models. Because SES and maternal psychiatric disorders are associated with 
psychiatric drug use and child neurodevelopment, SES and maternal history of other 
psychiatric diagnoses (excluding depression-related disorders, which were used in defining 
one comparison group, and substance abuse; see Table 1 for ICD codes) were further 
included in all adjusted analyses. Other covariates were included in the models if they were 
associated with both exposure and outcome at p<.1.
To take into account the fact that children born from 1996-2010 were aged 0-14 years at the 
end of the follow-up in 2010, we used survival methods. Events in the survival analysis were 
defined as age at the first diagnosis of the studied outcome. Separate survival analyses were 
conducted for each of the four outcomes. Time observations after migrating, dying, and the 
end of the follow-up on December 31, 2010 were censored. We plotted the cumulative 
incidence of offspring diagnoses among the SSRI exposed, the psychiatric disorder, no 
medication group, the SSRI discontinued group, and the unexposed group using the Kaplan-
Meier method. To compare offspring psychiatric diagnoses between these four groups, Cox 
proportional hazards models were used. Data from siblings in the same family were treated 
as clusters because outcomes from the same family are likely to be related. Robust sandwich 
estimates of the variance of the estimated Cox regression parameters were used for this 
purpose. Each outcome was analyzed separately by fitting two models: a crude model 
adjusted only for sex, and a model adjusted for additional covariates associated with the 
exposure and each specific outcome. The “unknown” category for SES was included, as the 
missing observations occurred completely at random. The age-specific depression and 
anxiety rates in offspring by different exposure groups were estimated with a Poisson-
regression model, assuming a Poisson error distribution. All analyses were performed in 
SAS (SAS 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

 Results
Maternal and family characteristics tested as covariates by exposure status are shown in 
Table 1, tested by offspring outcome diagnosis in Table S1 (available online), and 
specifically for offspring depression in Table S2 (available online). The distribution of 
offspring by birth year demonstrates that in the SSRI-exposed group, fewer offspring were in 
the oldest age cohort (1.6%) compared to offspring in the psychiatric disorder, no 
medication group (2.3%) or in the SSRI-discontinued group (3.4%) (Table S3, available 
online). The person years under observation in each of the offspring groups are presented in 
Table S4 (available online). The number and percentage of offspring who migrated or died 
according to exposure group in different age groups is shown in Table S5 (available online).
Children exposed to SSRIs during gestation were diagnosed with depression increasingly 
from age 12 onwards compared to the control groups that were not exposed, reaching a 
cumulative incidence of 8.2% by age 14.9, compared to 1.9% in the psychiatric disorder, no 
medication group, 2.8% in the SSRI discontinued group, and 1.6% in the unexposed group 
(Figure 1A, Table 2; Figure S2, available online). The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for 
depression in offspring exposed to SSRIs was 1.78 (95% CI, 1.12-2.82; p= .02) compared to 
the psychiatric disorder, no medication group and 1.84 (95% CI, 1.14-2.97; p=.01) compared 
to the SSRI-discontinued group (Figure 2A and B; Table S6, available online). The age-
specific incidence rate per 10,000 person-years of offspring depression in the oldest age 
group, 12-14 years, was 180.7 in the SSRI-exposed group compared to 35.1 in the 
psychiatric disorder, no medication group, 84.8 in the SSRI-discontinued group, and 58.4 in 
the unexposed group (Table S7, available online). We tested for sex interaction, and there 
was no significant interaction in comparisons between the main exposure groups (SSRI-
exposed group; psychiatric diagnosis, no medication group; SSRI discontinued group) and 
depression.
Although gestational SSRI exposure was associated with higher rates of depression in 
adolescent offspring, there was no increase in diagnosed anxiety disorders (Figure 1B, 
Figure 2, Table S6, available online). Likewise, the age-specific incidence rate of anxiety in 
the oldest age group differed only marginally between the SSRI-exposed, the psychiatric 
disorder, no medication, and the SSRI-discontinued groups (Figure 1B; Table S8, available 
online). Rates of ASD and ADHD diagnoses in the SSRI-exposed group were comparable to 
rates in offspring of mothers with a psychiatric disorder who did not use SSRIs during 
pregnancy, and to rates in offspring of mothers who discontinued SSRIs prior to pregnancy 
(Figure 1C, 1D; Figure 2; Table S6, available online). The age-specific incidence rates of 
ASD and ADHD are presented in Tables S9 and S10 (available online). Comparing SSRI 
exposed to unexposed, the HRs were significantly elevated for each outcome (Table S6, 
available online). While there was an increasing trend for ASD, no significant HRs were 
observed for any of the outcomes when comparing the psychiatric disorder, no medication 
group to the SSRI-discontinued group, whereas comparing the psychiatric disorder, no 
medication group to the unexposed group, the HRs were increased for ASD and ADHD 
(Table S11, available online).

 Restricting exposure to SSRI monotherapy (n=12,121) still yielded increased HRs for 
offspring depression when compared to the psychiatric disorder, no medication group (HR, 
1.85; 95% CI, 1.15-2.98; p=.01) and to the SSRI-discontinued group (HR, 2.12; 95% CI, 
1.29-3.48; p=.003). Following adjustment for other possible indicators of maternal illness 
severity including diagnoses related to suicidal behavior, the HR for offspring depression 
remained significantly elevated in the SSRI-exposed compared to all comparison groups 
(Table S12, available online).
Discussion
Statement of Principal Findings
Using national register data, we observed increased rates of depression emerging at 12-14 
years in offspring exposed prenatally to SSRIs. Taking into account maternal underlying 
psychiatric disorder. SSRI exposure was not associated with an increased risk of ASDs, 
ADHD, or anxiety. This study, like all studies attempting to answer questions about the 
long-term effects of in utero exposure to SSRIs, was observational, as it would not be 
possible to carry out a clinical trial of different exposures specially looking for effects 
manifesting earliest at 12-14 years of age, such as depression.
Strengths and Weaknesses
A major strength is that we took into account maternal underlying psychopathology. 
Antenatal depression itself is associated with an increased risk of emotional disorders in 
offspring,15 suggesting by extension that maternal depression severity impacts offspring risk. 
Hence, we controlled for potential depression severity differences between the SSRI-
exposed and the psychiatric diagnosis, no medication groups. Two prior studies have shown 
that, contrary to recommendations, the severity of maternal psychiatric symptoms is not 
related to the choice to continue or discontinue medication use during pregnancy,16,17 
allowing us to use the SSRI-discontinued group as a depression severity control. 
Furthermore, we excluded women using multiple psychotropic medications (a proxy for 
severity) and restricted our exposure to SSRI monotherapy. This refined SSRI exposure 
group still yielded increased HRs for offspring depression when compared to the psychiatric 
disorder, no medication group and the SSRI-discontinued group. Following adjustment for 
other possible indicators of maternal illness severity, including previous diagnoses related to 
suicidal behavior, the HR for offspring depression remained significantly elevated in the 
SSRI-exposed compared to all comparison groups. Hence, when both main comparison 
groups were adjusted for these “severity proxies,” the significance of SSRI exposure as the 
principal variable did not diminish.
Recent studies found that increased rates of ASD associated with in utero exposure to SSRIs 
became non-significant when controlled for maternal psychiatric illness.9, 10 Our findings 
are in line with those results and show that, similar to ASD, SSRI exposure added no 
additional risk above mothers' psychiatric illness to offspring ADHD and anxiety. Yet 
offspring of both groups (SSRI-exposed and psychiatric disorder, no medication groups) had 
higher risks of ASD and ADHD than offspring of mothers with no diagnosis and no 
psychotropic medication use. Likewise, the use of SSRI medications before pregnancy did

 not increase the rates of these disorders over and above the rates seen with maternal illness 
alone and no gestational SSRI use. We acknowledge that in this register-based setting, we 
cannot fully confirm the comparability of the exposure groups, but these observations 
support the notion that our main comparison groups (SSRI-exposed, psychiatric disorder, no 
medication group, and SSRI-discontinued group) were not biased by increased severity of 
illness in mothers using SSRIs during pregnancy.
A further strength is the high quality of the register data included in the study. The quality 
and coverage of the MBR have been validated and are considered good,18 and the 
Population Register covers all Finnish citizens and permanent residents in Finland.19 The 
quality of the HDR has been validated and is good for psychiatric diagnoses.20 
Approximately 1% of children in Finland have been diagnosed in specialized services with 
ASD until age 14,8 close to population-based estimates in Western countries.21 Therefore, it 
is likely that most children with ASD in the community are identified in the register. Further, 
the diagnostic validity of Finnish register-based diagnoses of ASD is high.22
As we have described in detail in previous work,5,8 children under 16 years have yearly 
medical check-ups in Finland; those who have serious psychiatric disorders are referred to 
specialized services for assessment. Therefore, it is likely that children with severe and 
moderate problems are found in registers. However, those with less serious problems might 
not be identified in medical check-ups or may not be referred to specialized services, 
potentially reducing the generalizability of our findings. Differential treatment seeking is 
also a potential limitation if children with depression in the community have different 
probabilities of being referred to specialized services depending on mother's medication use. 
It is unlikely, though, that offspring referral to specialized services would depend on the 
timing of mother's SSRI use (before or during pregnancy). The specific impact of SSRI 
exposure on offspring depression but not on other neuropsychiatric diagnoses also mitigates 
the possible confound of surveillance bias.
A limitation is that even in this large population-based sample, the numbers were too small 
to allow trimester-specific analyses. As in all register-based studies, a major limitation is that 
we cannot confirm adherence to the purchased drugs. However, noncompliance would result 
in overestimating exposure, likely biasing the observed associations towards null. Previous 
research has also indicated a good correlation between prescription register data and self-
reported antidepressant use.23 We also consider the risk of false negatives, unexposed 
offspring who in fact were exposed, as minimal, because the drug imbursement register 
covers over 98% of all drug purchases in Finland.24 We had no direct information on alcohol 
or illicit drug use, but we controlled for substance abuse for both parents by identifying 
related diagnoses in the HDR. A further limitation is that we had no information about 
postnatal environment. Although the findings on maternal SSRI use and depression persisted 
adjusting for previous diagnoses related to suicidal behavior, it is possible that postnatal 
experiences associated with maternal SSRI use and depression may have influenced the 
results.

 Comparison to Previous Studies
Previous studies investigating association between prenatal exposure to SSRIs and child 
internalizing behavior outcomes have shown inconsistent results.25,26,27 The sample sizes in 
those clinical studies were small, ranging from 22 to 62 children, and the follow-up time 
extended only until three to six years of age. In the largest sample, children exposed 
prenatally to SSRIs were more likely to present with internalizing problems by age six than 
those exposed to maternal depression only, but the severity of maternal depression rather 
than antidepressant use predicted child behavior.25 In the other studies, maternal anxiety and 
SSRI use26 and maternal depression and anxiety only27 were associated with an increased 
risk of offspring internalizing behavior. Two of the studies25,26 assessed child behavior at 
only one time point and by maternal self-report, which may have caused misclassification 
bias. Prior studies of prenatal SSRI exposure in relation to offspring ASD and ADHD have 
revealed conflicting results. In line with our results, two register-based studies9,10 and a 
study utilizing electronic health records11 did not show an association between SSRIs and 
offspring ASD. Further, a register-based study found no independent association with SSRI 
exposure during pregnancy and offspring ADHD after controlling for confounders.12 Our 
study provides additional support for these results by showing that there is no association for 
ASD or ADHD when offspring exposed to SSRIs are directly compared to offspring whose 
mothers were in treatment for a depression-related disorder during pregnancy. However, our 
results are contrary to a study including nearly 300 children with ASD in the Kaiser 
Permanente health system,13 and two other population-based studies, 14,29 both suggesting 
an association between SSRI use during pregnancy and ASD, the latter observing an 
association specifically with second and third trimester exposure in offspring of women 
predominantly of lower socioeconomic status.29 Further, a case-control study including 
2,243 children with ADHD showed an association between antidepressant exposure during 
pregnancy and ADHD after controlling for maternal depression.11 The discrepancy between 
that study and our negative finding might be explained by the fact that the prior study 
analyzed maternal depression regardless of whether it occurred before or during pregnancy, 
while we focused on maternal depression and related disorders close to and during 
pregnancy, i.e. the time period with a particularly high risk for offspring adversity.
Taken together, our results related to offspring risk of ASD or ADHD after gestational 
exposure to SSRIs are reassuring. However, if SSRI exposure during gestation has delayed 
but significant effects on offspring risk for depression, research regarding timing of 
exposure, and considerations regarding antidepressant mechanism of action and increased 
use of validated psychotherapies28 may be needed to maximize maternal benefits while 
minimizing risk to the long-term health of the developing fetus. Clearly, further research is 
needed to follow offspring through adolescence; given the typical age of onset of depression, 
this would substantially increase the sample size as well as the generalizability of the 
findings. Meanwhile, until either confirmed or refuted, these findings must be balanced 
against the substantial adverse consequences of untreated maternal depression.

 Clinical Guidance
•
Our study suggests that gestational SSRI exposure increases the risk of 
depression in early adolescent offspring, taking into account maternal 
psychiatric illness.
•
We found no increased risk of anxiety, autism spectrum disorders or ADHD in 
children exposed prenatally to SSRIs
•
The oldest study cohort was only reaching the age of risk for depression, and 
further research is urgently needed to follow offspring through adolescence.
•
Meanwhile, until either confirmed or refuted, these findings must be balanced 
against the substantial adverse consequences of untreated maternal depression.

The cumulative incidence (%) of offspring diagnoses by age. Note: The cumulative 
incidence (%) of offspring diagnoses by age among offspring born between January 1, 1996, 
and December 31, 2010, and followed up to December 31, 2010 (age range from 0.0 to 14.9 
years at the end of follow-up). Participants were censored from the age-defined analysis 
after December 31, 2010. Offspring exposed prenatally to selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs) are represented by magenta line, offspring exposed to maternal 
psychiatric disorder but no medication by cyan line, offspring of mothers discontinuing 
SSRI use prior to pregnancy by yellow line, and offspring unexposed to maternal psychiatric 
disorder and medication by black line. Panels A-D illustrate separately offspring depression 
(A), anxiety (B), autism spectrum disorder (ASD; C) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD; D).
