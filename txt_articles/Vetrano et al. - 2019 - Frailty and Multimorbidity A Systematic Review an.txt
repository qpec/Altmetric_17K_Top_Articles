Abstract
Background: Multimorbidity and frailty are complex syndromes characteristics of aging. We reviewed the literature and provided pooled 
estimations of any evidence regarding (a) the coexistence of frailty and multimorbidity and (b) their association.
Methods: We searched PubMed and Web of Science for relevant articles up to September 2017. Pooled estimates were obtained through 
random effect models and Mantel–Haenszel weighting. Homogeneity (I2), risk of bias, and publication bias were assessed. PROSPERO 
registration: 57890.
Results: A total of 48 studies involving 78,122 participants were selected, and 25 studies were included in one or more meta-analyses. Forty-
five studies were cross-sectional and 3 longitudinal, with the majority of them including community-dwelling participants (n = 35). Forty-three 
studies presented a moderate risk of bias and five a low risk. Most of the articles defined multimorbidity as having two or more diseases and 
frailty according to the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria. In meta-analyses, the prevalence of multimorbidity in frail individual was 72% 
(95% confidence interval = 63%–81%; I2 = 91.3%), and the prevalence of frailty among multimorbid individuals was 16% (95% confidence 
interval = 12%–21%; I2 = 96.5%). Multimorbidity was associated with frailty in pooled analyses (odds ratio = 2.27; 95% confidence 
interval = 1.97–2.62; I2 = 47.7%). The three longitudinal studies suggest a bidirectional association between multimorbidity and frailty.
Conclusions: Frailty and multimorbidity are two related conditions in older adults. Most frail individuals are also multimorbid, but fewer 
multimorbid ones also present frailty. Our findings are not conclusive regarding the causal association between the two conditions. Further 
longitudinal and well-designed studies may help to untangle the relationship between frailty and multimorbidity.
Keywords: Frailty, Multimorbidity, Older people, Chronic diseases, Personalized medicine
During aging, a number of biological deficits accumulate, which dis-
turb the homeostatic balance of the organism (1–3). This process starts 
since the life in the womb and follows distinct trajectories and proceeds 
at a different pace among individuals, variably reducing their resilience 
to internal and external stressors. The term “frailty” identifies the pre-
disposition of biologically old persons to develop adverse outcomes 
and experience rapid changes in health status. Chronic diseases have 
been suggested to contribute to the development of frailty (2).

 To a certain extent, diseases may be viewed as the result of an 
accumulation of specific biological deficits, which, beyond a certain 
threshold, may present as specific nosological entities (4,5). As we 
age, we tend to accumulate multiple chronic diseases; this condition is 
referred to as “multimorbidity” (having two or more diseases), and its 
prevalence reaches 30% in people younger than 65 years and ranges 
between 55% and 98% in people older than 65 years (6,7). Population 
aging and the increased likelihood to survive from events previously 
fatal are responsible for the worldwide multimorbidity epidemic (6).
Frailty and multimorbidity are considered to be promising clinical 
biomarkers for studying mechanisms underlying the aging process. 
Both have been shown to be associated with older people’s risk of 
disability, hospitalization, and mortality, as well as escalating health-
related costs (7–9). Indeed, a certain amount of overlap between the 
two conditions is biologically plausible, and a bidirectional causal 
relationship between them is probable. Frailty may predispose per-
sons to the development of multiple chronic diseases, but frailty may 
also stem from the coexistence of multiple diseases (10–12).
The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
has recently issued its first guidelines for the clinical assessment and 
management of multimorbidity (13). In this document, it is clearly 
stated that not all persons with multimorbidity require additional 
support beyond standard care, but only those whose multimorbid-
ity-related complexity significantly affects their life. In this regard, 
frailty is mentioned both as a component of multimorbidity and as 
a condition to take into account in the management of older adults 
with multimorbidity (14,15).
Describing the co-occurrence of frailty and multimorbidity and 
assessing their association may help further decipher the mecha-
nisms governing the aging process, build specific care pathways 
around these constructs, and inform clinicians (4,16–20). Results 
from different studies are conflicting, and due to the increasing 
aging of the population and high prevalence of multimorbidity 
and frailty, a meta-analysis is necessary to concretely clarify the 
role that these two conditions have on each other. The aim of the 
present study is to systematically review the literature and provide 
pooled estimations of any evidence regarding (a) the coexistence of 
frailty and multimorbidity and (b) their association in adults and 
older persons. Describing such evidence across a variety of stud-
ies, addressing different populations and using different definitions, 
may help to bring out the criticisms that need to be resolved in 
future studies and to put in context the results deriving from single 
previous and future studies.
Methods
We reviewed studies providing information on the association 
between frailty and multimorbidity in adult persons (ie, 18 years old 
or older), regardless of the study setting, study design, or definition 
of multimorbidity and frailty. No restrictions have been applied in 
this regard, considering that both multimorbidity and frailty have 
been described as transversal findings across a wide set of different 
ages and settings. The protocol of the present study was a priori reg-
istered in the international prospective register of systematic reviews 
PROSPERO (registration number 57890). No significant deviations 
from the original protocol have been made. This systematic review 
and meta-analysis was reported in accordance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) recommendations. For the present study, no ethics com-
mittee approval was necessary.
Data Sources and Searching
We searched the PubMed electronic database of the National 
Library of Medicine and the Web of Science database for relevant 
articles published from 1 January 2002 to 5 September 2017. Two 
searches have been carried out, on 21 February 2017, and on 5 
September 2017. MeSH terms and free words referring to frailty and 
multimorbidity were used as keywords. The detailed search queries 
are reported in Supplementary Material. References from selected 
papers and other relevant articles were screened for potential addi-
tional studies.
Study Selection and Data Extraction
Two assessors (D.L.V. and K.P.) independently screened the title 
and abstract of the selected studies. Studies that reported informa-
tion on either the proportion of multimorbid persons among those 
with frailty, the proportion of frail persons among those with mul-
timorbidity, or cross-sectional/longitudinal measures of association 
between frailty and multimorbidity were selected. Articles were 
excluded if they (a) did not investigate the aims of the review; (b) 
included persons younger than 18 years; (c) did not present original 
data; (d) did not provide an explicit definition of frailty and/or mul-
timorbidity, and (e) if frailty was evaluated through a single measure 
(eg, walking speed only). The full text of the articles selected by at 
least one of the assessors was further evaluated. The same assessors 
independently extracted information from the selected studies. Any 
disagreement was resolved through consensus. Most of the studies 
used the terms multimorbidity and comorbidity interchangeably. 
However, both in the text and in the table/figures we refer only to 
multimorbidity for consistency. When more than one measure of 
association was provided, the most adjusted estimation was used for 
the present study.
Studies were included if they were written in English or another 
European language. One Spanish article and one German article 
were selected for full-text evaluation. These articles were sent for 
translation by a native speaker who conducted data extraction.
Assessment of Risk of Bias
Study quality was evaluated independently by the two assessors 
through Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS), a tool for the qualitative 
evaluation of observational studies. Any disagreement in quality 
assessment was resolved through consensus. Studies with scores of 
>7 indicated low risk of bias, scores of 5–7 indicated moderate risk 
of bias, and scores of <5 indicated high risk of bias. Likelihood of 
publication bias was assessed (see Statistical analysis).
Data Analysis
For each measure of interest (ie, proportions and estimates of asso-
ciations), we ran a meta-analysis when at least three studies used 
the same definition of frailty and multimorbidity (Supplementary 
Table S2). Considering the observational design of the retrieved 
studies, and the methodological differences potentially responsible 
for a significant share of the variance within the measures of inter-
est, pooled estimates were obtained through random effect models 
and Mantel–Haenszel weighting. Lack of homogeneity within the 
pooled studies was assessed through the I2 statistics (significant if 
≥50%). I2 represents the percentage of variability of the pooled esti-
mate which is due to methodological heterogeneity rather than to 
chance. Analyses are presented according to the different definitions 
of frailty and multimorbidity. When a sufficient number of studies

 was available, secondary analyses were performed: (a) by NOS, to 
investigate the role of methodological bias in explaining heterogene-
ity; (b) by sample size, using different cutoffs (100, 500, and 1,000 
participants); and (c) by age. Publication bias was assessed by mean 
of the Egger’s and the Begg’s tests. All statistical analyses were per-
formed with STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). 
A p value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.
Role of the Funding Source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, 
data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The cor-
responding author had full access to all the data in the study and had 
final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Through the literature search, we retrieved 2,416 articles (Figure 1). 
Of them, 2,235 (93%) were excluded based on title and abstract and 
133 (6%) after full-text reading. Forty-eight articles were part of the 
final qualitative assessment, and 25 articles were analyzed in several 
meta-analyses.
Study Description
Supplementary Table S1 summarizes the main characteristics and 
findings of the selected studies. The overall number of participants 
was 78,122, with a mean age spanning from 52 to 85 years and a 
prevalence of females ranging from 14% to 100%. Notably, out of 
the 48 selected articles, only three included some people aged less 
than 60 years and in any case, even in these studies, the majority 
of participants were older than 60 years. Most studies had a cross-
sectional design (n = 45) and included community-dwelling people 
(11,21–55) (n = 36) or hospitalized people (56–62) (n = 7). Few 
of them included special populations: patients on hemodialysis (63) 
(n = 1), HIV patients (64) (n = 1), rehabilitation outpatients (65) 
(n = 1), or homeless people (66) (n = 1). Finally, one study was based 
on post hoc analyses of a clinical trial (55). Most of the studies were 
carried out in Europe (n = 20) and North America (n = 14) and fewer 
studies in Asia (n = 8), South America (n = 5), and Australia (n = 1).
Frailty assessment
Most of the studies (n = 33) defined frailty according to the 
Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) criteria, proposed by Fried and 
colleagues, which define frailty as the presence of at least three of 
the following: weight loss, low handgrip strength, slow gait speed, 
exhaustion, and reduced physical activity (11). The rest of the studies 
evaluated frailty based on a frailty index (n = 6) (1), the Edmonton 
Frail Scale (EFS; n = 3), the Canadian Study of Health and Ageing 
(CSHA) scale (n = 2), the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS; n = 1), the FRAIL 
scale (n = 1), the Korean FRAIL scale (n = 1), the Short Emergency 
Geriatric Assessment (SEGA; n = 1), the Frailty Framework among 
Vulnerable Populations (FFVP; n = 1), and the EASY-Care Two-step 
Older persons Screening (EASY-Care TOS; n = 1). Within the 48 
selected articles, frailty prevalence spanned from 0% to 76%.
Multimorbidity assessment
In the selected studies, 4–28 different conditions were assessed to 
compute multimorbidity. It is noteworthy that five studies did not 
report the number of diseases assessed. Different cutoffs were used 
to define multimorbidity: 2+ diseases (n = 14), 3+ diseases (n = 6), 4+ 
diseases (n = 1), 5+ diseases (n = 1), and 6+ diseases (n = 1). A con-
tinuous scale developed on disease count was analyzed in 14 stud-
ies. Alternatively, two indexes of multimorbidity were adopted: the 
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI; n = 12) and the Comorbidity 
Illness Rating Scale (CIRS; n = 2). Within the 48 selected articles, 
multimorbidity prevalence spanned from 2% to 70%.
Assessment of Risk of Bias
The majority of the studies (n = 43) presented a moderate risk of bias, 
and five studies presented a low risk according to the NOS. In most 
cases, the self-reported nature of information was responsible for a 
lower score. In general, many studies applied a modified version of 
the frailty tools to adapt the assessment to the available data. Finally, 
according to the Egger’s and the Begg’s tests, no strong evidence of 
publication bias was detected in our meta-analyses (p = .324 and 
p = .450, respectively).
Overlap of Frailty and Multimorbidity
Nine studies, all of them involving community-dwelling persons, 
reported data on the overlap between frailty (CHS criteria by 
Fried and colleagues) and multimorbidity (2+ diseases), for a total 
of 14,704 individuals (Figure 2) (11,23,26,31,33,37,40,49,51). 
According to these data, 868 (6%) persons presented both multi-
morbidity and frailty, 403 (3%) presented only frailty, and 6,213 
(42%) presented only multimorbidity. As shown in Figure 3A, the 
pooled prevalence of multimorbidity in community-dwelling frail 
people was 72% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 63%–81%; 
I2 = 91.3%). After stratifying the analysis by NOS, the I2 for stud-
ies presenting a lower risk of bias decreased to 29.8% with a slight 
decrease in the prevalence of multimorbidity (67%; 95% CI = 63%–
70%) (11,31,40,49). After restricting the analysis to the three studies 
including the majority of participants aged 80 years and older, the 
pooled prevalence of multimorbidity among frail individuals was 
63% (95% CI = 41%–85%; I2 = 97.0%) (26,37,49). As shown in 
Figure 3B, the pooled prevalence of multimorbidity in community-
dwelling frail people was 16% (95% CI = 12%–21%; I2 = 96.5%).

 Stratification for NOS and sample size did not reduce heterogeneity. 
By restricting the analysis to the three studies including the major-
ity of participants aged 80 years and older, the pooled prevalence 
of frailty in multimorbid people was 27% (95% CI = 9%–45%; 
I2 = 98.3%) (26,37,49).
When the CCI was used to estimate multimorbidity burden 
(seven studies; Figure 4), nonfrail participants, when compared 
with those with frailty, presented a lower CCI (ΔCCI = 0.66; 95% 
CI = 0.75–0.45; I2 = 62.0%) (56,59,61–63,65,67). To note, all these 
studies included hospitalized (n = 6) or dialysis (n = 1) patients.
The studies not included in the meta-analysis because they used 
more heterogeneous measures of frailty and multimorbidity gener-
ally reported a higher number of diseases or a higher comorbidity 
score within frail participants (Supplementary Table S1).
Association Between Frailty and Multimorbidity
Cross-sectional studies
Sixteen studies assessed the cross-sectional association between 
multimorbidity and frailty. Four studies defined multimorbidity as 
the presence of 2+ diseases and frailty according to the CHS crite-
ria (22,23,34,37). Noticeably, among them, one study reported the 
estimations separately for five different countries (22). Three stud-
ies defined multimorbidity as the presence of 3+ diseases and frailty 
according to the CHS criteria (30,41,47). The remaining nine studies 
used alternative or nonconsistent definitions of both multimorbid-
ity and frailty, so they were not included in the meta-analysis. The 
model adjustments carried out in the individual studies are reported 
in Supplementary Table S1. When multimorbidity was defined as the 
presence of 2+ diseases we found a significant pooled association 
with frailty in community-dwelling people (odds ratio = 2.27; 95% 
CI = 1.97–2.62; I2 47.7%; Figure 5A), with consistent results after 
stratification for low or moderate risk of bias and larger sample size 
(data not shown). When multimorbidity was defined as the pres-
ence of 3+ diseases, we found a nonsignificant pooled association 
with frailty (odds ratio = 2.16; 95% CI = 0.94–4.97; I2 = 86.7%; 
Figure 5B).
Among the nine studies not included in the meta-analysis, only 
one did not show a significant association between frailty and 
multimorbidity (24). The remaining studies constantly reported a 
Figure 2. Overlap of frailty and multimorbidity (pooled data from nine 
studies including community-dwelling people; N = 14,704). Frailty was 
defined according to the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) criteria (by Fried 
and colleagues) and multimorbidity as 2+ diseases.

 significant association, up to fourfolds, between the two measures, as 
defined in several different ways across the studies (Supplementary 
Table S1) (21,27,28,38,42,53,63,65).
Longitudinal studies
Three studies reported measures of longitudinal association between 
multimorbidity and frailty (Supplementary Table S1). However, the 
different methodology across them did not allow us to perform a 
meta-analysis. Two studies described a positive association between 
multimorbidity and the development of frailty. Namely, Hejek and 
colleagues showed that the multimorbidity score, computed by 
weighting diseases according to their severity, was associated with 
a nonsignificant increase in frailty score (β = 0.013; p > .05) (36). 
Zheng and colleagues reported a significant association between 
multimorbidity (3+ diseases) and risk of developing frailty (odds 
ratio = 6.24; p < .05) (54). Finally, Guaraldi and colleagues addressed 
the relationship between frailty at baseline (measured with a frailty 
index) and incident multimorbidity (2+ diseases), in HIV outpatients, 
finding a significant association (incidence rate ratio = 1.98; 95% 
CI = 1.65–2.36) (64).
Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 48 observational stud-
ies, we found that 7 out of 10 frail adults present with multimorbidity 
and that almost a fifth of adults with multimorbidity also present with 
frailty. In addition, multimorbidity increases the likelihood of being 
frail almost twofold. Finally, according to longitudinal studies, multi-
morbidity is associated with an increasing risk of developing frailty and 
vice versa, suggesting a bidirectional association between the two con-
ditions. In general, a significant heterogeneity has been found across 
studies regarding the definition of both multimorbidity and frailty. This 
is the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the rela-
tionship between frailty and multimorbidity in the adult population.
Frailty stems from the progressive accumulation of biological defi-
cits that pile up with passing time as an expression of the aging process. 
It can be considered as a global and transversal measure able to capture 
both clinical and subclinical impairments (2,68). Multimorbidity may 
be thought of as the accumulation of biological abnormalities deemed 
as clinically relevant and that define overt disease diagnoses (2,4,69). 
However, even if conceptually they are close concepts, the proportion 
of the community-dwelling population presenting both conditions is 
quite low, only 6%, with a huge discrepancy between those present-
ing only multimorbidity (42%) and those presenting only frailty (3%). 
Noticeably, our meta-analysis highlights two important elements: (a) 
the majority of frail people are also multimorbid and (b) very few peo-
ple with multimorbidity are also frail. On the one hand, this evidence 
corroborates the hypothesis that chronic diseases are major deter-
minants of the frailty syndrome (2,69,70). This is also confirmed by 
the fact that multimorbidity was associated with a twofold increased 
likelihood of being frail, even though, in cross-sectional studies, this 
association may be interpreted as bidirectional. On the other hand, the 
low prevalence of frailty in multimorbid people suggests that only a 
small proportion of those suffering from multiple diseases also develop 
a condition of frailty. According to previous studies, multimorbidity 
becomes evident in the fifth decade of life and its prevalence contin-
ues increasing into very old age. Conversely, frailty becomes evident 
only later in life (71,72). Such a temporal gap might be interpreted 
as an individual’s resilience to cope with multimorbidity before it has 
a relevant impact on health (ie, frailty). In support of this hypothesis, 
after restricting our prevalence analyses to studies including the oldest 
participants, we observed that the proportion of frailty in multimorbid 
people and that of multimorbidity in frail people became closer (63% 
and 27%, respectively). Further studies addressing such an association 
in different age groups are warranted.
It is possible that frailty and multimorbidity are clearly connected 
by shared mechanisms but that they rarely overlap due to differences 
in the way they are defined, operationalized, and measured (4,12). 
This may also contribute to the relevant heterogeneity found in the 
present study. The bidirectional results of the few longitudinal stud-
ies, even if not always significant, seem to support this view. We 
found many different ways to define frailty and multimorbidity in 
our review, and different sets of diseases to define multimorbidity, 
with almost all of the studies applying modified versions of the origi-
nal frailty tools to exploit the available data. Such a methodological 
heterogeneity does not allow us to draw any conclusion on the actual 
relationship underlying these two conditions and calls for more rigor-
ous and standardized definitions of both multimorbidity and frailty 
(4,6). We should also consider the use of arbitrary cutoffs for the defi-
nition of multimorbidity. Most of the studies retrieved in our review 
defined multimorbidity as the presence of 2+ concurrent diseases 
(4,6). It is likely that such a strict cutoff is affected by a ceiling effect 
that does not take into account the huge variability of disease bur-
den existing between a person suffering from two diseases and, for 
example, someone suffering from five or more diseases. In this regard, 
using a continuous measure of multimorbidity is warranted (4,6).
Strengths and Limitations
The major strength of the present study is its comprehensive litera-
ture search that, together with the careful study selection and quality

 assessment, provides a reliable overview of the evidence in the field. 
Moreover, the generalizability of our findings is enhanced by the 
representativeness of the retrieved studies that mainly involved com-
munity-dwelling adults and older persons. Another strength is that 
we included articles in English and any other European language. 
However, there are several limitations to discuss. First, we detected 
a significant heterogeneity among the studies that was only partially 
buffered by subgroup analyses. The different definitions of frailty and 
multimorbidity, the use of adapted tools, the different adjustment 
carried out in multivariate models, and the demographic differences 
might explain such a high level of heterogeneity. Moreover, cross-
country differences regarding disease-coding systems may further 
hinder comparability of the results (73). Similarly, poor development 
and limited access to health services may affect the validity the dis-
ease measurements. In this regards, the scarce representativeness of 
Asian, South American, Australian, and African countries may limit 
the generalizability of our results to these contexts. Furthermore, 
overmedicalization and excessive diagnostic testing, which is more 
frequent in high-income countries, could lead to an overestimation 
of multimorbidity. However, the absence of evident publication bias 
and the low-to-moderate risk of methodological bias increase the 
reliability of our findings. Second, the cross-sectional design of the 
majority of studies limits the opportunity to generate hypotheses 
regarding a causal link between the conditions of interest. At the 
same time, the three longitudinal studies retrieved by our literature 
search suggest a bidirectional relationship between frailty and mul-
timorbidity, indeed not always statistically significant. However, the 
weak methodology, which does not take into account the potential 
competing risk of mortality, calls for more rigorous studies testing 
the longitudinal association of frailty and multimorbidity. Third, in 
our meta-analyses, we included only studies defining frailty accord-
ing to the CHS criteria as proposed by Fried and colleagues. The low 
number of studies using alternative definitions prevented us from 
running additional pooled estimations. Finally, due to the specific 
aim of the present review, we did not take into consideration the role 
played by disability, which, beyond—and often simultaneously—
frailty and multimorbidity, represents the most frequent finding in 
the older population.
Relevance and Future Perspective
Researchers, clinicians, and policymakers strive to find effective mod-
els that may help to understand the aging process, assist in the design 
of personalized treatments, and build efficient health systems for the 
care of complex older adults (4,19). Frailty and multimorbidity have 
been demonstrated to be helpful prognostic conditions, and are the 
focus of interest of many health professionals and international bod-
ies, to the point that huge investments have recently been provided 
to investigate them (74,75). The recently issued NICE guidelines for 
the clinical assessment and management of multimorbidity clearly 
warrant the assessment of frailty in complex older adults, consid-
ering it a steering condition in the person-centered vision of care 
offered to multimorbid patients (13–15). Our systematic review and 
meta-analysis provide, for the first time, a comprehensive picture of 
the available evidence regarding the relationship between frailty and 
multimorbidity. It appears to be a close relationship, suggesting the 
need for comprehensive assessment of both conditions in complex 
adults. Both frailty and multimorbidity have been demonstrated to 
be burdensome conditions, and the co-occurrence of the two may be 
associated with an even higher burden (52). However, the investiga-
tion of the impact of these two conditions on people’s health was 
beyond the aim of the present study.
We believe that the results of our review can be informative for lever-
aging further efforts in the fields of research, clinical practice, and public 
health. The following issues are worth addressing in the near future: 
First, a shared definition of both frailty and multimorbidity should 
be reached, considering not only the scientific validity of the two con-
structs but also the feasibility of their assessment in real-world settings, 
also optimizing the information currently available in clinical practice 
(4,6,12). This may help to buffer the significant heterogeneity found in 
our study. Second, despite stemming from similar processes, the limited 
overlap of frailty and multimorbidity raises several concerns regarding 
the validity of their current operationalization (12). The adoption of 
continuous measures, instead of rigid categories, may provide the meth-
odological flexibility that would help untangle the actual link between 
the two conditions (2,6). Third, more studies need to investigate the 
shared pathways leading to frailty and multimorbidity. In this regard, 
a more holistic approach, encompassing the use of biomarkers (eg, 
inflammatory cytokines and in general -omics) and longitudinal study 
designs, may help generate new hypotheses on the nature of their asso-
ciation. Finally, pragmatic studies need to be designed to test the clinical 
validity of these two concepts, eventually suggesting the best strategies 
to set up preventive practices and dedicated care paths (4).
CONCLUSION
Frailty and multimorbidity are two related conditions in older adults. 
Most frail individuals are also multimorbid, but few multimorbid 
older adults also present frailty. Overall, in the general adult popula-
tion, only 6% present with both conditions. Our findings are incon-
clusive regarding the causal association between the two conditions. 
However, a bidirectional association seems plausible. The wide set of 
tools used for the assessment of frailty and multimorbidity further 
limits speculation on the nature and significance of the association. 
Further studies, including more rigorous and agreed definitions of 
the two conditions, involving the assessment of specific biomark-
ers, and adopting longitudinal designs, are necessary to untangle the 
relationship between frailty and multimorbidity.
