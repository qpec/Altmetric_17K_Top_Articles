SUMMARY
Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk after resolving chronic hepatitis B virus
(HBV) infection is unclear.
Aim
To compare HCC risk between Alaska Native (AN) patients with and without
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance.
Methods
We selected persons with (case-patients) and without (control-patients) HBsAg
seroclearance from a cohort of 1346 chronically HBV-infected AN patients
followed during 1982‒2013. We attempted to match two control-patients/case-
patient on sex, HBV genotype, and age. Person-years of follow-up for
case-patients began on the date of HBsAg resolution and for control-patients
began on the date equivalent to the cohort entry date plus the years of HBsAg
duration for their corresponding case-patient. We compared HCC risk using a
Cox proportional hazards model.
Results
The 238 case-patients (4 with HCC) and 435 control-patients (9 with HCC)
were similar in age [P-value (P) = 0.30], sex (P = 0.53) and HBV genotype
(P = 0.99). Case-patients had longer person-years of follow-up than control-
patients (11.7 vs. 10.1 years; P = 0.04). The HCC rate/100 000 persons was
similar between case- (132) and control-patients (178; P = 0.65). The adjusted
hazard ratio comparing case- and control-patients was similar for HCC [0.7;
95% confidence interval (CI): 0.2–2.4], increased for each 1-year increment
for age (1.1; CI: 1.0–1.1; P < 0.01), and was greater if the initial HBeAg was
positive (3.5; CI: 1.1–11.0; P = 0.03).
Conclusions
Hepatitis B surface antigen seroclearance was not associated with reduced
HCC risk; the HCC risk estimates are limited by wide 95% confidence inter-
vals. Persons meeting HCC surveillance indications prior to HBsAg seroclear-
ance could benefit from continued surveillance after seroclearance.

 INTRODUCTION
Approximately, 248 million persons worldwide have
chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.1 Persons with
chronic HBV infection are at increased risk for cirrhosis
and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).2 Depending on
genotype, 0.5–2% of HBV-infected persons will clear
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) annually.3–5 The
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases
HCC practice guidelines state that HCC surveillance is
cost-effective in populations, where the HCC incidence
exceeds 0.2% per year. No recommendations for HCC
surveillance exist for persons with spontaneous HBsAg
seroclearance because of conflicting data on HCC risk in
this population.6
Previous studies evaluating HCC risk after HBsAg sero-
clearance have reached diverging conclusions.7–10 Reasons
for the variation in reported HCC risk include differences
in the predominant circulating genotype (HCC risk varies
with genotype),11 study design (clinic-based vs. popula-
tion-based cohort), and lack of uniform follow-up after
HBsAg seroclearance (since time of seroclearance is
unknown for persons in some studies). In addition, those
previous studies included the years of follow-up prior to
HBsAg clearance when calculating the HCC incidence
among persons who resolve HBsAg. Recent evidence indi-
cates that the eventual risk for developing HCC might be
substantially influenced by factors early in the course of
disease such as the HBV DNA level at the time of diagno-
sis.10, 12 Therefore, restricting the HCC risk analysis to the
time period after HBsAg seroclearance can provide a more
precise estimate of the effect of HBsAg seroclearance on
the subsequent risk for HCC.
During 1982‒1987, 53 000 AN persons representing
84% of the Alaska Native (AN) population in Alaska
were tested for HBsAg as part of a statewide HBV vacci-
nation
campaign.13
All
persons
testing
positive
for
HBsAg during/after the vaccination campaign were pro-
vided healthcare through the Alaska Tribal Health Sys-
tem (ATHS) and offered HCC surveillance regardless of
age or risk factors.14 Previous studies of this cohort of
AN HBV carriers have documented an HBsAg seroclear-
ance rate of 0.5–0.7% per year.5, 15 We conducted a
nested case–control study among this cohort of HBV-
infected AN persons to compare the risk for developing
HCC after HBsAg seroclearance with the risk for HCC
among persons who did not clear HBsAg. We specifically
aimed to evaluate the HCC risk only during the time
period after HBsAg seroclearance for case-patients or the
equivalent time period of time for control-patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study population
There
were
approximately
143 000
AN
persons
in
Alaska in 2013.16 All AN persons with chronic HBV,
defined as having two positive HBsAg results >6 months
apart, have been entered into an HBV clinical registry
maintained by the ATHS. The clinical registry helps
track when patients are due for routine screening exams
and records clinical outcomes. Persons newly diagnosed
with chronic HBV infection were continuously added to
the clinical registry. In addition, the names of newly
diagnosed patients with HBV infection were cross-refer-
enced with the Alaska Area Specimen Bank, which con-
tains >266 000 biological specimen from persons who
participated in research studies dating back to 196117; if
serum specimen from these persons were located, it was
tested for HBsAg to more precisely estimate the date of
infection.
Case- and control-patients
We selected case- and control-patients from among
HBV registry patients who were followed during 1982‒
2013
and
consented
to
participate
in
study
(Fig-
ure 1).5, 13, 15 Case-patients were defined as persons with
HBsAg seroclearance and control-patients as persons
without HBsAg clearance. We attempted to match two
control-patients for each case-patient on sex, HBV geno-
type and age group at cohort entry (control age group
�2.5 years if case aged <30 years, �7.5 years if case
aged 30–50 years and �10 years if case aged ≥50 years).
For a cohort person to be eligible for selection as a con-
trol-patient, the documented HBsAg duration must have
been at least as long as their corresponding case-patient’s
HBsAg duration. Because this study used data from an
observational clinical cohort, rather than a prospective
cohort designed specifically to study HCC in HBV-
infected persons, the presence of other risk factors for
HCC, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfection, dia-
betes mellitus, family history of HCC or non-alchoholic
steatohepatitis,18–21
were
not
comprehensively
docu-
mented for study participants not developing HCC.
Therefore, we were unable to exclude HBV-infected
patients with other risk factors for HCC from analysis.
Laboratory testing
All AN persons with chronic HBV infection in the clini-
cal registry were reminded semiannually by mail to go to
their clinical provider for a blood draw. The sera were
1198

ª 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd
P. P. Gounder et al.
 sent to the Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage,
Alaska for testing. Since 1982, sera have been tested for
HBsAg and alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) semiannually, and
for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and antibody to HBe
(anti-HBe) annually. Beginning in 2001, sera were also
tested for liver function tests semiannually, including
aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST and ALT,
respectively) levels, and to obtain a baseline HBV DNA
level and HBV genotype. The HBV DNA level was
repeated every 6–12 months for persons with a baseline
HBV DNA level >2000 IU/mL, a family history of HCC,
or if aminotransferase levels were elevated. We tested for
HBeAg, anti-HBe, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), anti-
body to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), and HBV
DNA using commercially available assays as previously
described.5, 22 Complete blood count, which includes a
platelet count, was not routinely requested because of
specimen instability associated with the time required to
transport specimen from certain rural Alaskan villages to
the Alaska Native Medical Center for testing.
Identification of persons with HCC
Most AN persons with HCC were initially detected by
the ATHS HCC surveillance programme. As many AN
persons live in small rural Alaskan communities that are
inaccessible by road and without ultrasound capability,
the ATHS has offered HCC surveillance to all AN per-
sons with chronic HBV infection by semiannual AFP
measurements. The AFP threshold for referring for liver
imaging was >25 ng/mL during 1982–1992 and was
reduced to >15 ng/mL beginning in 1993, and >10 ng/
mL after 2000. Persons with an elevated AFP, a family
history of HCC, or cirrhosis were also offered diagnostic
liver imaging by ultrasound or computed tomography.
All persons with radiologic findings concerning for HCC
were offered further evaluation/treatment at the Alaska

HCC after HBsAg clearance
 Native Medical Center; histological confirmation of HCC
was available for persons who received a biopsy/surgical
resection of their tumour. Persons who declined biopsy/
resection of their liver lesion were diagnosed with HCC
based on their clinical presentation, including an elevated
AFP level, and compatible findings on radiographic
imaging. We likely captured all HCC cases in the study
population because all patients received care at the
Alaska Native Medical Center. To ensure no study
patients were diagnosed/treated for HCC at another hos-
pital in Alaska, we cross-referenced the names of study
patients with the Alaska Native Tumor Registry, a
National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and
End Results Programme registry in operation since
1969.23
Statistical analysis
Demographical and clinical characteristics between case-
and control-patients were compared by using the Wil-
coxon rank-sum test for ordered variables, and chi-
squared or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables.
Median values are reported with 25th and 75th per-
centiles (Q1–Q3). Person-years of follow-up for case-
patients began on the date of HBsAg resolution (Fig-
ure 1). The equivalent time zero to mark the start of
control-patient’s person-years of follow-up began on the
date equivalent to the control-patient’s cohort entry date
plus the years of HBsAg duration for their corresponding
case-patient. We estimated the date of HBsAg resolution
as the mid-point between the last HBsAg-positive and
the first HBsAg-negative test. Person-years of follow-up
ended for case- and control-patients on the date of HCC
diagnosis, death or end of study period. Case-patients
without at least one matching control-patient were
excluded from analysis. Patients who are simultaneously
positive
for
HBeAg
and
anti-HBe
are
considered
HBeAg-positive for analysis. The initial HBeAg test was
defined as the first test done after cohort entry and the
final HBeAg test was defined as the last test done before
end of follow-up. The duration of HBeAg positivity was
defined as the difference between the first and last posi-
tive HBeAg test results.
We calculated the unadjusted HCC rate/100 000 per-
son-years by dividing the total number of HCC tumours
in case- and control-patients by their respective person-
years of follow-up after time zero. We compared the
HCC rate between case- and control-patients by using a
Cox proportional hazards model that adjusted for exact
age and initial HBeAg status (the first recorded HBeAg
level after cohort entry).
Analysis
was
conducted
with
STATA
10
(College
Station, TX, USA). P < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant, and all tests were two-sided.
Human subjects review
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Boards of the Alaska Area and the Centres for Disease
Control and Prevention. It also received review and
approval by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consor-
tium.
RESULTS
Study cohort characteristics
A total of 1346 chronically HBV-infected AN persons
were enrolled in the study cohort during 1982–2013.
Among cohort persons, 58% (782) were male, the med-
ian age at cohort entry was 23 years (minimum–maxi-
mum years: 0–87), 35% (476/1343) and 4% (53/1343)
had a positive HBeAg result on the initial and final tests,
respectively, 19% (254) had HBsAg seroclearance, 4%
(51) developed HCC, and 34% (460) died (all causes;
proportion liver-related unknown).
Characteristics of case- and control-patients
We
identified
435
matched
control-patients,
who
remained HBsAg-positive throughout the follow-up per-
iod, for 238 case-patients, who had HBsAg seroclear-
ance (41 case-patients had only one matching control-
patient); we excluded from analysis 16 case-patients
without any matching control-patients (Table 1). There
were no significant differences between case- and con-
trol-patients with respect to the matching criteria of
age, sex, and HBV genotype (Table 1). Case-patients
were followed up for a median of 28.9 years (Q1–Q3:
24.4–30.2 years) prior to HBsAg clearance and matched
to control-patients who were followed up for at least a
median of 28.9 years (Q1–Q3: 20.7–30.3 years). Case-
patients were followed up for a median of 11.7 years
(Q1–Q3:
6.5–18.3 years)
after
HBsAg
clearance;
the
equivalent
median
years
of
follow-up
for
control-
patients were 10.1 years (Q1–Q3: 4.8–17.9 years). Case-
compared with control-patients were less likely to have
an
initial
positive
HBeAg
result
(22%
vs.
37%;
P < 0.01) and less likely to have received anti-viral
therapy for HBV infection (1% vs. 7%; P < 0.01). The
two case-patients who received anti-viral therapy were
treated with lamivudine for immune-active HBV infec-
tion, which possibly facilitated HBsAg seroclearance; an
additional five case-patients were placed on anti-viral

 therapy after HBsAg seroclearance ahead of planned
immunosuppressive therapy. Case- and control-patients
were similar in terms of the percentage that died during
follow-up (28% vs. 33%) and the percentage with HCV
coinfection (4% vs. 3%). Among the patients selected
for the nested case–control study, three had HIV coin-
fection (one control-patient, one case-patient before
HBsAg seroclearance, and one case-patient after HBsAg
seroclearance),
and
13
developed
HCC
(four
case-
patients and nine control-patients). An additional two
cohort
patients
developed
HCC
prior
to
HBsAg
seroclearance; these patients were not included as case-
patients
because
person-years
of
follow-up
for
this
analysis began after HBsAg seroclearance. There were
no significant differences between case- and control-
patients developing HCC in terms of the percentage
that died (100% vs. 78%), had HCV coinfection (25%
vs. 11%), had cirrhosis at time of HCC diagnosis (25%
vs. 63%), or a family history of HCC (0% vs. 50%).
The specific characteristics of the 13 case- and control-
patients who developed HCC are detailed in Table 2.
A platelet count necessary to calculate an aspartate
aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), a non-
invasive marker for liver fibrosis, was available for 131
(55%) case-patients and 258 (59%) control-patients.24
Among case-patients with an APRI, 88% had an index
<0.5, 9% had an index 0.5–1.5, and 2% had an index
>1.5. Among control-patients with an APRI, 81% had an
index <0.5, 14% had an index 0.5–1.5, and 5% had an
index >1.5. A FIB-4 index, another non-invasive liver
fibrosis marker calculated using platelets, alanine amino-
transferase, aspartate aminotransferase and patient age,
was available for 131 (55%) case-patients and 256 (59%)
control-patients.25 Among case-patients with a FIB-4
index, 69% had an index <1.45, 24% had an index 1.45–
3.25 and 7% had an index >3.25. Among control-
patients with a FIB-4 index, 71% had an index <1.45,
19% had an index 1.45–3.25 and 10% had an index
>3.25. There was no difference between case- and con-
trol-patients in the percentage of patients with an APRI
>1.5 vs. ≤1.5 (P = 0.19) or in the percentage with a Fib4
score >3.25 vs. a score ≤3.25 (P = 0.34).

HCC after HBsAg clearance
 HCC rate
The HCC rate/100 000 persons was similar between
case-patients with HBsAg seroclearance [132; 95% confi-
dence interval (CI): 36–338] and control-patients without
HBsAg seroclearance (178; CI: 81–338). The risk for
HCC did not differ significantly between case- and
control-patients in the multivariable Cox proportional
hazards model [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 0.7; CI:
0.2–2.4]. The risk for HCC was associated with greater
age at cohort entry (aHR for each 1-year increment: 1.1;
CI: 1.0–1.1; P < 0.01) and having a positive initial
HBeAg result compared with a negative result (aHR: 3.5;
CI: 1.1–11.0).
HBV DNA and ALT Levels
The distribution (statistical spread of values) of HBV
DNA levels among case-patients was compared with
control-patients at time periods before and after HBsAg
seroclearance (Table 3). At least one HBV DNA mea-
surement was available for 97% of case-patients (median:
two measurements; Q1–Q3: 1–4 measurements) and 82%
of control-patients (median: three measurements; Q1–Q3:
1–6); the time periods for aggregating HBV DNA mea-
surements were selected to optimise sample size for anal-
ysis. There was no difference in the distribution of the
HBV DNA level between case- and control-patients
≥9 years prior to HBsAg seroclearance (P = 0.39) and

HBV DNA level was lower among case-patients com-
pared with control-patients <9 years after HBsAg sero-
clearance (median: 0 vs. 212 IU/mL; % with HBV DNA
>0 IU/mL: 40% vs. 87%; % with HBV DNA >2000 IU/
mL: 1% vs. 28%; P < 0.01) and ≥9 years after HBsAg

DNA >0 IU/mL: 48% vs. 92%; % with HBV DNA
>2000 IU/mL: 2% vs. 29%; P < 0.01). Among the 98
case-patients followed up for ≥9 years after HBsAg sero-
clearance, 95% (93) were anti-HBs positive on the last
serum specimen tested before end of follow-up and 51%
(47) had detectable HBV DNA. The five case-patients
who were followed up for ≥9 years after HBsAg sero-
clearance and remained anti-HBs negative also had
detectable HBV DNA on their final serum sample tested
before end of follow-up.
We also compared the distribution of ALT levels
among case-patients with control-patients at time peri-
ods before and after HBsAg seroclearance (Table 4). The
ALT level was similar between case- and control-patients
≥9 years prior to HBsAg seroclearance (P = 0.39) and
<9 years prior to HBsAg seroclearance (P = 0.99). The
ALT level was lower among case-patients compared with

CONCLUSIONS
Previous studies evaluating the risk for HCC associated
with HBsAg loss have included the time during which
persons were seropositive for HBsAg in calculating the
HCC rate.3, 7, 9, 10 Our study is unique because we
attempted to isolate the effect of HBsAg seroclearance
on subsequent risk for developing HCC. The results
indicate that HBsAg seroclearance was not associated
with reduced risk for HCC. Although the small number
of persons who developed HCC limits the strength of
our conclusion, our case- and control-patients were
sampled from one of the largest and longest followed

 population-based cohorts of persons with HBV infection
in the world. As a result, this present study includes
more persons with resolved HBsAg (including those who
developed HCC) than similar previous studies that have
evaluated the risk of HCC after resolving HBV infec-
tion.3, 8, 9, 26 As it is unlikely a more precise estimate of
HCC
risk
following
HBsAg
seroclearance
can
be
obtained in the near future, it would be reasonable to
offer HCC surveillance after HBsAg seroclearance for
persons meeting AASLD practice guidelines criteria for
surveillance prior to resolving HBV infection.6
Cirrhosis is an important risk factor for developing
HCC among persons with chronic HBV infection. The
presence of cirrhosis was not comprehensively known
for our study participants who did not develop HCC in
part because many patients lived in rural communities
without ready access to liver biopsy capable facility.
Therefore, we were unable to match case- and control-
patients according to their cirrhosis status. For the subset
of case- and control-patients with APRI and Fib4 avail-
able, we are reassured that there was no difference
between the two groups in the proportion with advanced

 liver fibrosis as measured by these non-invasive makers.
Furthermore, knowing the cirrhosis status only for case-
patients who developed HCC still provides insights into
the risk for HCC. Unlike previous studies where the
majority of patients who developed HCC after resolving
chronic HBV infection had cirrhosis at the time of
HBsAg seroclearance,3, 9, 26 only one of the four case-
patients with HCC in our study had cirrhosis. However,
the other three case-patients without cirrhosis would
have met AASLD age/sex criteria for continuing HCC
surveillance after HBsAg seroclearance.6
The reasons for why HBsAg seroclearance was not
associated with reduced HCC rate are unknown but
likely multifactorial. It is possible that factors early in the
course of HBV infection, such as the HBV DNA level or
degree of hepatic necroinflammation, might have had a
greater influence on HCC risk.10, 12, 27 We compared the
distribution of HBV DNA level for the time periods
before and after HBsAg seroclearance among case-
patients and for the corresponding time periods among
control-patients. The lack of difference in HCC rate
between case- and control-patients corresponds with the
similarity in HBV DNA levels among case-patients com-
pared with control-patients before HBsAg clearance.
These results support previous reports that the HBV
DNA level before HBsAg seroclearance is an important
predictor for developing HCC.10, 12 It is likely for the
reason
that
treatment
with
nucleos(t)ide
analogues
decreases both the risk for developing HCC and the risk
of HCC recurrence after surgical resection.28–31 One
mechanism by which HBV infection causes HCC could
be through the integration of HBV DNA into the host
hepatocyte genome and as covalently closed circular
(ccc) DNA in hepatocyte nuclei.27, 32 The integrated viral
DNA and cccDNA that result from HBV viremia persist
after HBsAg seroclearance and might promote the devel-
opment of HCC. Furthermore, a substantial proportion
of case-patients in our study had a detectable HBV DNA
level after HBsAg seroclearance. Thus, it is possible that
ongoing low-level HBV DNA replication with continued
integration into the host hepatocyte also contributes to
the persistent HCC risk after HBsAg seroclearance.
In addition, the degree of HBV-associated hepatic
inflammation, which can be assessed by measuring ALT
levels, correlates with the risk for developing HCC.27
The ALT level before HBsAg seroclearance was similar
among
case-patients
compared
with
control-patients.
The ALT level together with the HBV DNA level indi-
cates that the majority of case- and control-patients were
in the immune-inactive phase of HBV infection prior to
HBsAg seroclearance. Results from this present study
confirm previous evaluations in this cohort demonstrat-
ing that most patients with chronic HBV infection are
HBeAg-negative and remain in the immune-inactive
phase after HBeAg clearance.33, 34 The lack of difference
in the degree of hepatic inflammation between case- and
control-patients
prior
to
HBsAg
could
also
partly
account for the lack of association between HBsAg sero-
clearance and reduced HCC risk.
Our adjusted analysis indicates that the initial HBeAg
status and increasing age at cohort entry were associated
with HCC risk. The presence of HBeAg, indicating
immune-active phase of disease, is associated with high
HBV DNA levels and intermittent ALT elevations.35
Therefore, HBeAg seropositivity could be associated with
increased risk for HCC, because it is a surrogate marker
for HBV DNA level and hepatic inflammation.7, 36 Our
adjusted analysis also confirmed results from previous
studies indicating that increasing age in HBV-infected
persons is a risk factor for HCC.2, 37, 38 Although the
exact date of HBV infection is unknown for patients in
our study, it is likely that most patients acquired HBV
infection in early childhood or at birth.39 Thus, the age
at cohort entry probably correlates with the duration of
infection for most study patients. Since our control-
patients were matched with case-patients on age and
duration of follow-up, the results additionally suggest
that increasing age might be a risk factor for HCC inde-
pendent of duration of HBV infection.
This study has limitations. First, our HCC risk esti-
mates had wide confidence intervals because few case-
and control-patients developed HCC. Thus, we could
have failed to detect a real reduction in HCC risk associ-
ated with HBsAg seroclearance because of insufficient
statistical power. It is important to note, however, that
both HBsAg seroclearance and development of HCC are
rare events, and our study has more persons with HBsAg
seroclearance and HCC than other similar studies.3, 8–
10, 26 Furthermore, it is important to note that the HCC
incidence for a population cannot be calculated in a
case–control study since the number of cases and con-
trols are prespecified. The HCC rates we present allow
for comparing the HCC risk between groups in this
paper, but the absolute rates cannot be compared with
the HCC incidence reported elsewhere. In addition, the
presence of other HCC risk factors, such as HCV coin-
fection, family history of HCC, diabetes mellitus or fatty
liver disease,18–20 was not comprehensively known for
our study participants not developing HCC. As a result,
we could not adjust for several important HCC risk

HCC after HBsAg clearance
 factors in our model comparing the HCC rate between
case- and control-patients. We did demonstrate, how-
ever, that case- and control-patients were similar in
terms of certain key risk factors, such proportion with
HCV coinfection, HBV DNA level, hepatic inflammation
as measured by ALT levels, and liver fibrosis as mea-
sured by APRI and Fib4. Finally, our results based on
the AN population might not be generalisable to other
populations. The risk for HCC varies by HBV geno-
type11; AN persons infected with genotypes C and F
have a higher incidence of HCC compared with persons
infected with other genotypes.22 Differences in the preva-
lence of HBV genotypes between those found in AN per-
sons compared with other geographical regions of the
world could affect the incidence of HCC observed
between persons with and without HBsAg seroclearance.
The goals of HBV treatment are to reduce the risk of
developing cirrhosis, liver decompensation and HCC.
Therapy for HBV infection is indicated for patients in
the immune-active phase but not for patients in the
immune-inactive
phase
of
HBV
infection.40
Most
patients in our study were in the immune-inactive phase
of infection and did not receive HBV therapy. However,
study patients were still at high risk for developing HCC
and HBsAg seroclearance did not reduce the HCC risk.
Given the effectiveness of nucleos(t)ide analogues in
reducing HCC risk for persons with elevated HBV DNA
levels,30 further research to better understand the factors
early in the course of infection that predict future risk
for developing HCC risk could help to identify a subset
of immune-inactive patients who might benefit from
early treatment.
