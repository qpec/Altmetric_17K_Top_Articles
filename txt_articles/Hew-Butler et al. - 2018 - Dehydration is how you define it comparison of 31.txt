Clinical medicine defines dehydration using blood markers 
that confirm hypertonicity (serum sodium concentration 
([Na+])>145 mmol/L) and intracellular dehydration. Sports 
medicine equates dehydration with a concentrated urine as 
defined by any urine osmolality (UOsm) ≥700 mOsmol/kgH2O 
or urine specific gravity (USG) ≥1.020.
Objective To compare blood versus urine indices of 
dehydration in a cohort of athletes undergoing routine 
screenings.
Methods 318 collegiate athletes (193 female) provided 
blood and urine samples and asked to rate how thirsty 
they were on a 10-point visual analogue scale. Serum 
was analysed for [Na+], while serum and UOsm were 
measured using an osmometer. USG was measured using 
a Chemstrip. Data were categorised into dehydrated 
versus hydrated groupings based on these UOsm and USG 
thresholds.
results Using UOsm ≥700 mOsmol/kgH2O to define 
dehydration, 55% of athletes were classified as 
dehydrated. Using any USG ≥1.020 to define dehydration, 
27% of these same athletes were classified as dehydrated. 
No athlete met the clinical definition for dehydration 
(hypertonicity; serum [Na+]>145 mmol/L). Normonatremia 
(serum [Na+] between 135 mmol/L and 145 mmol/L) was 
maintained in 99.7% of athletes despite wide variation in 
UOsm (110–1298 mOsmol/kgH2O). A significant correlation 
was confirmed between serum [Na+] versus UOsm 
(r=0.18; P<0.01), although urine concentration extremes 
did not reflect derangement in serum markers or thirst 
rating.
Conclusion Urine concentration thresholds classified 
27%–55% of collegiate athletes as dehydrated, while 
no athlete was dehydrated according to blood [Na+] 
measurement. Practitioners should caution against using 
urine indices to diagnose or monitor dehydration, because 
urinary output is a response rather than a reflection of 
(tightly regulated) blood tonicity.
InTrOduCTIOn
Dehydration is a term that generally reflects 
any loss of body water and linked to poor 
athlete performance, heat illness, skeletal 
muscle cramps and acute renal failure in 
athletes.1 
Given the potential for unfavourable health 
and performance consequences, a number of 
definitions have been used to define dehy-
dration with an end goal of prevention. The 
American College of Sports Medicine uses 
non-invasive measures to define dehydra-
tion as a urine specific gravity (USG) ≥1.020 
 
and/or urine osmolality (UOsm) ≥700 
mOsmol/kgH2O.1 The advantage of using 
non-invasive measures is that they are quick, 
simple and easy to use in both laboratory and 
field settings. Studies using body weight and 
urine indices as outcome measures support 
the conclusion that athletes must drink 
beyond the physiological dictates of thirst to 
maintain adequate hydration levels.1
In contrast to non-invasive measures of 
hydration status, clinical medicine is reliant 
on blood (serum or plasma) chemistry 
measurements to define and subdivide dehy-
dration into two (often related) categories: 
intracellular and extracellular dehydration.2 3 
Intracellular dehydration is defined by any loss 
of intracellular water that induces cellular 
desiccation and hypertonicity (ie, increases in 
blood sodium concentration ([Na+]) or osmo-
lality).2 3 Extracellular dehydration, which is 
also referred to as hypovolaemia or volume 
depletion, alternatively reflects any loss of 
What are the new findings?
 
► A urine osmolality above 700 mOsmol/kgH2O would 
classify >50% of athletes as dehydrated, in a spot 
sample hydration check, despite normal blood 
sodium concentration, potassium concentration and 
osmolality values that would confirm the athletes 
were euhydrated (normonatremic) at rest.
 
► Urine concentration, either as urine osmolality or 
specific gravity, should not be used as a surrogate 
measure for blood hydration markers in a spot 
sample hydration check conducted at rest.
 
► A urine osmolality value above 700 mOsmol/kgH2O, 
and/or urine specific gravity above 1.020, reflects 
urinary free water conservation and not clinically 
significant (intracellular) dehydration in a large 
cohort of collegiate athletes.

sodium from the extracellular space that compromises 
plasma volume.2 3 The distinction between intracellular 
and extracellular dehydration is diagnostically important 
when choosing the best therapeutic strategies for water lack 
(intracellular dehydration) and/or sodium lack (extracel-
lular dehydration). This clinical definition also reflects the 
physiological tenets of fluid homeostasis, which strive to 
protect tonicity and tissue perfusion.2 4–6 Accordingly, the 
US Institute of Medicine states that the primary indicator 
of hydration status is plasma or serum osmolality7 8 with 
the maintenance of normonatremia (blood [Na+] between 
135 mmol/L and 145 
mmol/L) central to this evolutionary 
tenet.6 9 Accordingly, studies using plasma osmolality10–13 or 
plasma volume14 as indicators of hydration status support 
the conclusion that thirst is an adequate stimulus to prevent 
intracellular and extracellular dehydration.
Investigations assessing relationships between urine 
concentrations versus plasma osmolality (tonicity) in 
athletes fail to demonstrate statistical significance that 
would support the utility of using urine indices as a 
(more practical) surrogate measure of cellular hydra-
tion.15–22 The lack of diagnostic utility in using urine 
indices to predict intracellular dehydration has also 
been verified in a large sampling of 313 older people in 
a clinical setting.8 While plasma osmolality remains the 
hallmark measure of both tonicity and water balance,4–6 
derangements in serum [Na+] represent extreme clinical 
manifestations of fluid imbalance that require emergent 
treatment.4 6 Accordingly, athlete deaths from underhy-
dration have been associated with hypernatremia (serum 
[Na+] >145 mmol/L),23 while deaths from overhydra-
tion have been associated with hyponatremia (serum 
[Na+] <135 mmol/L).24
The primary aim of this study is to compare blood and 
urine indices using two common urine-based definitions 
of dehydration.1 21 25–27 Additionally, we chose serum 
[Na+] (instead of plasma osmolality) as our main outcome 
measure of blood tonicity to more critically reflect the 
clinical consequences documented in exercise-asso-
ciated fatalities at the extremes of fluid imbalance.23 24 
The practical importance of clarifying the sport (urine) 
versus clinical (blood) definition of dehydration distills 
down to one simple—yet hotly debated—question: how 
much should we drink? Our hypothesis is that dehydra-
tion—and utility of using thirst as a guide to prevent 
dehydration—is highly dependent on the criterion used 
as the main outcome measure.
MeThOds
This project was approved by Oakland University’s Insti-
tutional Review Board (IRBNET), and written informed 
consent was obtained from each participant prior to data 
collection. Data were obtained from collegiate athletes 
participating in two separate projects.
Project 1
In this project (IRBNET#888153), 40 male and female 
National 
Collegiate 
Athletic 
Association 
(NCAA) 
Division 1 (D1) swimmers presented to the labora-
tory six times over the first 7 weeks of preseason (Fall) 
training. Testing occurred on Friday afternoons, between 
14:00 and 16:00 as part of a larger project on rhabdomy-
olysis. Each swimmer provided a spot urine sample, and 
5 mL of blood was withdrawn via venipuncture while in a 
supine position. All urine samples were analysed for USG 
using a URS-10 CHEMSTRIP inserted into an Uritek 
TC-101 urine reader (Tecodiagnostics, Anaheim, Cali-
fornia, USA) and UOsm using a VAPRO Vapor Pressure 
Osmometer (Wescor, Logan, Utah, USA). Whole blood 
samples were analysed for serum [Na+] and potassium 
concentration ([K+]) using ion selective electrodes at a 
nearby hospital laboratory (Crittenton Hospital). Serum 
osmolality was assessed using a VAPRO Pressure Osmom-
eter.
Project 2
In this screening project (IRBNET#778936), 79 NCAA 
D1 athletes participating in Fall sports (women’s 
soccer, men and women’s cross country and basket-
ball) presented to the laboratory once, preseason, for a 
single blood draw at a time (between 09:00 and 15:00) 
suitable for each team. As part of a larger project, each 
student-athlete provided a spot urine sample, and 5 mL of 
blood was withdrawn via venipuncture while in a supine 
position. All urine samples were analysed for USG using 
a URS-10 CHEMSTRIP inserted into an Uritek TC-101 
urine reader and UOsm using a VAPRO Vapor Pressure 
Osmometer. Whole blood samples were analysed for 
[Na+] and [K+] using a Roche 9180AVL electrolyte anal-
yser (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA). 
Serum osmolality was assessed using a VAPRO Pressure 
Osmometer.
Fluid intake was neither monitored nor measured in 
either project. In general, our student-athletes were not 
given standardised guidance on the topic of hydration 
and free to drink any beverage at any time. Our training 
room provided water bottles plus free access to a sports 
beverage (Gatorade), milk (plain, chocolate, strawberry 
and soy) and water to all student-athletes.
In both projects, all urine and serum biochemical 
hydration indices were measured within 2 hours of collec-
tion. Duplicate measurements were conducted in serum 
samples only when they appeared out of the normal 
reference range, with the value closest to the normal phys-
iological range used. Blood and urine sampling occurred 
without restrictions on diet, hydration or activity as ‘spot 
checks’ obtained in a field setting.18 Thirst was assessed 
using a 10-point rating scale, with ‘0’ representing ‘not 
thirsty at all’ and ‘10’ representing ‘extremely thirsty’, 
either when entering the lab (project 1) or at the time of 
venipuncture (project 2). This rating scale was adapted 
from Engell12 and validated as a 9-point28 29 and 11-point 
rating scale30 as well as a 10 cm (unmarked) visual 
analogue scale.10 13

definitions of dehydration
Combined data were artificially categorised into two 
groups, dehydrated versus hydrated athletes, based on 
the following two commonly used urine-based defini-
tions of dehydration: (1) UOsm ≥700 mOsmol/kgH2O1 
and (2) USG ≥1.020.1 31 The following variables were 
then compared between dehydrated versus hydrated 
athletes: serum [Na+], [K+] and osmolality; UOsm and 
USG; and thirst rating. Normonatremia was defined as 
any serum [Na+] between 135 mmol/L and 145 mmol/L, 
with clinical (cellular) dehydration defined as any serum 
[Na+] >145 mmol/L (hypernatremia).4 6 Relative overhy-
dration was defined as any serum [Na+] <135 mmol/L 
(hyponatremia).4 6 24
statistics
All data analysed using Statistica V.13 (Dell, Round Rock, 
Texas, USA). T-tests with unequal variance were used 
to analyse differences between urine markers, serum 
markers and thirst rating using the two urine-based 
thresholds that categorised athletes into dehydrated 
versus hydrated athlete groups. Relationships between 
variables were assessed using Pearson’s product-moment 
correlations. Data reported as means±SD with statistical 
significance set a priori at P<0.05.
resulTs
For project 1, of the 40 swimmers (23 female) that were 
tested six times, only one individual had missing data 
at one testing time point (thus n=239, not 240). For 
 
project 2, there were 23 males and 56 females who were 
tested once. Demographic data from both projects 
detailed in table 1. Data from both projects were analysed 
collectively, as each data point represented 318 individual 
athlete ‘spot checks’, tested at random in an ecologically 
valid setting.
Table 2 depicts the hydration variables of interest for the 
entire cohort of spot checks (n=318), divided into male 
(n=125) and female (n=193) spot checks, along with the 
normal range of values. On average, all biochemical vari-
ables of interest were within the normal reference range. 
The only statistically significant difference between male 
versus female spot check values was noted in USG, with 
females demonstrating a (mathematically) higher USG 
compared with males.
Table 3 depicts the analyses of hydration vari-
ables when dehydration was defined as any UOsm 
value ≥700 mOsoml/kgH2O.1 Using this definition, 
 
174 (55%) of the athlete spot checks would classify these 
athletes as dehydrated on arrival into the laboratory. 
When compared with athletes classified as ‘hydrated’ 
using this definition, the ‘dehydrated’ athletes had statis-
tically significant elevations in UOsm (by design), USG, 
serum [Na+] and thirst ratings.
Table 4 depicts the analyses of hydration variables 
when dehydration was defined as any USG value ≥1.020.1 
Using this definition, 85 (27%) of the athlete spot checks 
would classify these athletes as dehydrated on arrival into 
the laboratory. When compared with athletes classified as 
‘hydrated’ using this definition, the ‘dehydrated’ athletes 
had statistically significant elevations in USG (by design) 
and UOsm. There were no differences in any serum vari-
able or thirst rating.
Figure 1 demonstrates the statistically significant 
positive relationship (r=0.18; P<0.01) between serum 
[Na+] versus UOsm. Of note, despite the wide range of 
UOsm values (110–1298 mOsoml/kgH2O), only one 
serum [Na+] value (134 mmol/L) was outside of the 
normal reference range of 135–145 mmol/L.24 Signif-
icant correlations were also noted between serum 
[Na+] versus thirst rating (r=0.12; P<0.05), serum [Na+] 
versus serum osmolality (r=0.24; P<0.001), UOsm versus

dIsCussIOn
Urine-based definitions identified 27%–55% of our 
collegiate athletes as ‘dehydrated’ at the time of testing. 
Those athletes classified as dehydrated using urine 
criteria (UOsm ≥700 mOsoml/kgH2O or USG >1.020) 
would have subsequently been instructed to drink 
more fluids (above the dictates of thirst) to achieve 
‘adequate’ hydration levels.1 21 25–27 Conversely, none of 
our athletes were identified as dehydrated according to 
serum [Na+] measurement (figure 1). The maintenance 
of normonatremia—despite wide fluctuations in urine 
concentration—suggests that these athletes were drinking 
adequate amounts of fluid in response to osmotic thirst 
stimulation.4 10 11 The lack of clinical sensitivity for urine 
indices to detect intracellular dehydration supports 
previous results obtained from smaller studies involving 
athletes/exercise15–22 and larger studies conducted in 
older patients8 and young children.32 The popularity of 
using urine indices to define ‘inadequate hydration’,33 34 
despite a growing body of contradictory evidence, thereby 
raises critical concern over the apparent medicalisation 
of a normal physiological response (kidney water conser-
vation).35 36
The maintenance of normonatremia has been docu-
mented previously in 80% of 2135 endurance athletes, 
completing a variety of races ranging from standard 
(42.2 km) marathons through Ironman Triathlons across 
four countries.37 With dehydration and water turnover 
expected to be exceedingly high immediately following 
prolonged endurance races, only 13% of this large cohort 
were hypernatremic, while 7% were hyponatremic on 
race finish.37 This low incidence of dysnatremia thereby 
underscores the strength of the osmoregulatory system, 
even under conditions of heightened physiological and 
psychological stress.
In contrast to blood indices, UOsm definitions cate-
gorised 55% (UOsm ≥700 mOsmol/kgH2O)1 of our 
student-athletes as ‘dehydrated’ at the time of measure-
ment (table 3). By design, both urine values (UOsm 
and USG) were significantly higher in the dehydrated 
versus hydrated groups. Serum [Na+] and thirst ratings 
also demonstrated statistically significant increases in the 
dehydrated versus hydrated groups. However, the math-
ematical difference between groups for these regulated 
variables (140.3 mmol/L vs 139.3 mmol/L for serum 
[Na+] and 4.6 vs 4.2 for thirst) were not clinically mean-
ingful. The high incidence of dehydration (55%) based 
on UOsm criteria in the present study concurs with 
a study performed on 46 (26 male, 20 female) adoles-
cent swimmers, using UOsm ≥700 mOsmol/kgH2O to 
define dehydration.25 Those authors found that 67% of 
their swimming cohort were dehydrated on rising (first 
morning urine sample), 78% were dehydrated immedi-
ately prior to training and thirst rating was not significantly 
different before (4.4/10) versus after (5.5/10) training.25 
Thus, despite UOsm concentrations being twice as high 
in the dehydrated versus hydrated categories in the 
present study, serum biomarkers ([Na+], [K+] and osmo-
lality) and thirst perception remained remarkably stable.
Another commonly used definition to assess ‘dehydra-
tion’ is USG, which takes into account both urine solute 
mass as well as concentration.38 Using the threshold of 
any USG value ≥1.020 to define dehydration,1 27% of 
our athletes were classified as ‘dehydrated’ at the time 
of measurement (table 4). This incidence is much lower 
than previous rates demonstrated in other athletic 
cohorts such as 90% of 107 male adolescent soccer players 
measured before practice39 and 66% of 263 (138 male,

125 female) NCAA D1 athletes who provided random 
urine samples.40 Similar to the UOsm findings, there 
were no mathematical or clinically relevant differences 
in either serum markers ([Na+], [K+] and osmolality) or 
thirst rating, since blood tonicity is a physiologically regu-
lated variable.
The previous literature has been consistent with our 
blood versus urine findings, demonstrating significant 
relationships between urine markers (such as USG vs 
UOsm)22 38 but not between urine versus blood markers 
of hydration status ([Na+] and osmolality).8 21 22 The 
confounding effects of diet, the timing of fluid intake 
and the renal response to exercise likely contribute to 
the poor prognostic utility of using urine indices as surro-
gate markers for water and sodium homeostasis (plasma 
tonicity or volume status).41 In contrast to osmoregulatory 
thirst and arginine vasopressin (AVP) stimulation, urine 
concentration is not a regulated physiological variable 
associated with fluid homeostasis.4–6 10 42 43 Urine volume 
and solute concentration are renal effector responses 
that are largely subservient to circulating plasma AVP 
levels.4 5 43 Copious urinary free water excretion is reflec-
tive of either: (1) AVP suppression, which largely occurs 
when fluid intake is in excess of osmoregulatory need,4 or 
(2) AVP antagonism at the V2 receptor, triggering dilute 
urine with cellular dehydration.44 Clinically speaking, 
AVP suppression and antagonism characterise central 
and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, both of which are 
successfully compensated by osmotically driven thirst 
stimulation to maintain tonicity balance.4
Drinking according to the dictates of thirst will thereby 
prevent cellular dehydration. Drinking to keep urine 
clear or maintain body weight may lead to overhydra-
tion.24 Accordingly, drinking above thirst has been 
associated with a 33%–57% incidence of hyponatremia in 
professional rugby players tested after match play, field 
and gym training.45 Thus, although urine concentration 
may be a useful measurement tool, caution is advised 
against the potential for overzealous adherence to fluid 
intake guidelines based on urine or any other hypotonic 
fluid secretion, which may overshoot osmoregulatory 
need or renal excretion capabilities.
Limitations of our study include an inability to control 
fluid intake or standardise exercise prior to testing. 
Our inability to control fluid intake or timing may have 
contributed to delays in the adjustment of urine indices 
to plasma changes from fluid absorption, as proposed 
elsewhere.15 18 Previous research has also shown that 
exercised-induced fluid losses—without clinically signif-
icant dehydration—may have significant effects on other 
important physiological variables such as heart rate, core 
temperature, sweat loss, rating of perceived exertion and 
skeletal muscle metabolism, which may hinder physical 
and mental performance.1 46 47 However, despite these 
clear limitations and need for further study, we believe 
that these data provide a robust ‘snapshot’ of the typical 
collegiate athlete who is able to preserve cellular size 
(normonatremia) despite a wide range of urine concen-
trations, exercise and hydration habits.
In summary, normonatremia was maintained in 
99.7% of this random sample of hydration spot checks 
performed at rest. UOsm ≥700 mOsmol/kgH2O classi-
fied 55%, while USG ≥1.020 classified 27% of athletes 
as dehydrated at the time of testing. This discrepancy 
between serum versus urine indices likely reflect the 
differences between using a physiologically regulated 
versus non-physiologically regulated variables to define 
dehydration. Since thirst is a physiologically regulated 
variable of fluid homeostasis, drinking to thirst would be 
an appropriate fluid intake strategy using serum or plasma 
Figure 1 Graph of serum [Na+] versus urine osmolality, when all data points (n=318) were combined. Across the y-axis, no 
athlete demonstrated intracellular dehydration (hypernatremia; serum [Na+] >145 
mmol/L), 99.7% demonstrated normonatremia 
(serum [Na+] between 135 mmol/L and 145 
mmol/L), while one athlete was hyponatremic (serum [Na+]=134 
mmol/L). Across 
the x-axis, 55% of athlete spot checks fell into the dehydrated range (UOsm ≥700 mOsmol/kgH2O), while 45% fell into the 
hydrated range (UOsm <700 mOsmol/kgH2O). The correlation coefficient (r) was statistically significant (P<0.01), despite serum

criterion to prevent hypernatremia or hyponatremia, at 
least during resting conditions (pre-exercise). However, 
according to urine output based definitions of dehydra-
tion, drinking above the dictates of thirst is required to 
suppress AVP and promote a clear and copious free water 
excretion (aquaresis). Thus, the definition of dehydra-
tion varies greatly within various study populations, with 
subsequent hydration advice subservient to the defini-
tion that is used. Figure 2 summarises how the different 
definitions may yield differential hydration advice from a 
physiological perspective, at least during a rested state. It 
is important to emphasise that these data do not question 
the potential deleterious effects of dehydration—nor 
drinking to thirst—on performance but rather questions 
the utility of using urine concentration as a surrogate 
marker for clinical dehydration in routine student-ath-
lete urine spot checks.
