Cognition in school-age children exposed
to levetiracetam, topiramate, or sodium
valproate
ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to monotherapy levetiracetam, topira-
mate, and valproate on child cognitive functioning.
Methods: This was a cross-sectional observational study. Children exposed to monotherapy lev-
etiracetam (n 5 42), topiramate (n 5 27), or valproate (n 5 47) and a group of children born to
women who had untreated epilepsy (n 5 55) were enrolled retrospectively from the UK Epilepsy
and Pregnancy Register. Assessor-blinded neuropsychological assessments were conducted
between 5 and 9 years of age. Information was collected on demographic and health variables
and adjusted for in multiple regression analyses.
Results: In the adjusted analyses, prenatal exposure to levetiracetam and topiramate were not found
to be associated with reductions in child cognitive abilities, and adverse outcomes were not associ-
ated with increasing dose. Increasing dose of valproate, however, was associated with poorer full-
scale IQ (210.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 216.3 to 25.0, p , 0.001), verbal abilities (211.2,
95% CI 216.8 to 25.5, p , 0.001), nonverbal abilities (211.1, 95% CI 217.3 to 24.9, p , 0.001),
and expressive language ability (22.3, 95% CI 23.4 to 21.6, p , 0.001). Comparisons across
medications revealed poorer performance for children exposed to higher doses of valproate in com-
parison to children exposed to higher doses of levetiracetam or topiramate.
Conclusions: Preconception counseling should include discussion of neurodevelopmental out-
comes for specific treatments and their doses and women should be made aware of the limited
nature of the evidence base for newer antiepileptic drugs. Neurology® 2016;87:1943–1953

Concern about the use of valproate in women of childbearing age has led to a shift in prescribing
practices toward newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), especially levetiracetam, lamotrigine, and top-
iramate.1–3 Prenatal exposure to lamotrigine has been demonstrated to be associated with signifi-
cantly higher neuropsychological functioning than children exposed to valproate, both in infancy4,5
and at school age.6,7 However, there is extremely limited evidence regarding the risks that may be
associated with exposure to levetiracetam or topiramate.8 For infants exposed to levetiracetam,
consistent neurodevelopment with control infants and superior development in comparison to
infants exposed to valproate at 1 and 3 years of age has been reported.9,10 Only a single study has
reported on the neurodevelopment of children exposed to topiramate and although this documents
an association between prenatal exposure and reduced neurodevelopmental outcome, its findings
are substantially limited because of the topiramate cohort size (n 5 9).11
This study aimed to delineate the cognitive abilities of school-age children exposed prenatally
to monotherapy levetiracetam or topiramate in comparison to children born to women with

 untreated epilepsy and children exposed to val-
proate. This study had a directional hypothesis,
which stated that children exposed to levetirace-
tam or topiramate would not differ from control
children in their cognitive abilities but would
have performed significantly higher than the chil-
dren exposed to valproate on measures of cogni-
tive ability. Child IQ was the primary outcome
variable with other, more specific cognitive abili-
ties, investigated as secondary outcome variables.
METHODS The study was a cross-sectional observational study.
Mother–infant pairs were identified from the United Kingdom
Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register (UK-EPR), a national pregnancy
register that investigates the prevalence of major congenital
malformations following exposure to AEDs. Detailed information
about the register and its methodology has been reported
previously.12 Women with epilepsy were enrolled in the UK-EPR
through self-referral or referral by their health professional.
Recruitment occurs within the first or second trimester
facilitating prospective documentation about health and well-being
during the pregnancy. Within 3 months of birth, details about the
birth and health of the child are reported to the register by local health
care services. Mother–infant pairs were eligible for inclusion in this
neurodevelopment follow-up study if the infant had been a live birth
between September 2004 and May 2007 and mothers either were
taking levetiracetam, topiramate, or valproate monotherapy or
they were untreated during their pregnancy. Recruitment was
national across the UK. Families were not invited to participate if
their child had a genetic condition associated with neurodevelopmental
impairment. Initially, this study also aimed to investigate the
neurodevelopment of children exposed to gabapentin in utero;
however, the numbers enrolled in the UK-EPR were low. Means
and SDs for the gabapentin data (n 5 14) are reported in table
format for information.
Enrollment into this follow-up study was retrospective. There
were approximately 3 times more eligible participants for the
valproate-exposed group and the no-medication group, than for the
other exposure groups and therefore each third mother identified
was included in the recruitment list for these 2 groups. Recruitment
letters and information sheets were posted out to those identified. A
follow-up letter was issued if no response had been received. Mother–
infant pairs who returned a positive response were formally enrolled
in the study and informed consent was obtained.
Pregnancy details and details about the mother’s epilepsy,
including AED dose and seizure information, were collected from
the prospectively collected records of the UK-EPR. No seizure
diaries or frequent monitoring of seizure activity had been taken
and therefore seizure exposure was dichotomized as present or
absent. Details of the mother and father’s educational history and
employment were collected through a semistructured interview at
the time of the assessment. Alcohol, nicotine, and concomitant
medication use for the second and third trimesters, which is not
routinely collected by the UK-EPR, were collected through
maternal report retrospectively. Maternal intellectual functioning
was measured with the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence.13
Sixty percent of children exposed to levetiracetam and 20% of
children exposed to valproate enrolled in this study were previ-
ously assessed at 3 years of age as part of an ongoing study9 but
were not part of the infant cohort reported by this study group.10
Neuropsychological assessments were conducted blinded by
authors R.B., R.C., C.R., or R.S. either in the child’s home or
school. The assessment battery included the Wechsler Intelligence
Scale for Children–Fourth Edition14 or the Wechsler Preschool and
Primary Scale of Intelligence–Third Edition15 if the child was 5 years
of age. The primary outcome measures were the full-scale IQ (FSIQ),
verbal index, nonverbal index, and the processing speed index. Anal-
ysis of these outcomes was adjusted for administered assessment test
version (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–Fourth Edition or
Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence–Third Edition).
Specific cognitive domains were assessed utilizing subtests from the
NEPSY: A Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment, 2nd edi-
tion16 and the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals–Fourth
Edition,17 with parental rating of behavior collected using the Behav-
ior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition.18 Assessments
were double-scored and data entry double-checked to minimize
errors. Feedback was provided to the family on the outcome of
the assessments.
The data were analyzed using multiple linear regression. The fol-
lowing covariates were considered: maternal epilepsy type, treatment
group, dose, professional employment, maternal IQ, maternal age, ges-
tational age of child at birth, sex, age, and exposure to seizures, tobacco,
or alcohol. Inverse probability weighting19 was used to account for the
influence of missing outcomes. The analysis of AED doses utilized
dose recorded in the UK-EPR at enrollment, which represents dose
around the time of conception. For the purposes of comparison
between the AED types, doses were standardized by dividing dose
by the median dose for each respective AED type. The median was
used because the doses had skewed distributions. To take into account
that 3 components of child IQ were investigated, multiple compar-
isons were considered when interpreting the results of the primary
analysis. The secondary analyses, which involve a large number of
statistical models (23 different models) have been added for complete-
ness but should be regarded as merely exploratory. In a separate anal-
ysis, comparisons across AEDs were made at different dose levels (0.5
times median dose, median dose, 1.5 times median dose, and 2 times
median dose) for the primary outcome. Data analysis was performed
using the statistical packages MLwiN 2.16 and R i386 3.1.1.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. Approval was obtained from the North West Regional
Ethics Committee, UK, and Belfast Health and Social Care Trust
who host the UK-EPR. All participants provided informed written
consent.
RESULTS Four

invitations
to
participate were sent out with 201 positive responses
received (45%). Forty cases declined participation (9%),
while the majority did not respond (46%). Of the 201
positive responses, 16 cases (8%) required exclusion
because of conditions likely to effect cognitive
functioning (e.g., brain injury, meningitis) or were too
old (.9 years) by the time of assessment. Therefore,
185 of the 449 who were sent letters completed the
assessment (41%). The percentage completing the
study from the available sample on the UK-EPR
varied by treatment group (no medication 35% of
those eligible, topiramate 53%, levetiracetam 67%,
gabapentin 58%, and valproate 31%).
The groups were comparable across the majority of
demographic variables (table 1). However, differences
were found in frequency of seizures, with those exposed
to levetiracetam being exposed to the highest number of
seizures (43%). The mothers of children exposed to

 valproate were older and they had the highest mean
maternal IQ and level of folate supplementation (table 1).
Children exposed to valproate had the lowest
unadjusted mean scores for FSIQ and verbal reason-
ing (table 2) and across a number of other cognitive
and behavioral domains (table 3).
In the adjusted analyses, exposure to levetiracetam
was not found to be associated with reductions in
FSIQ, verbal abilities, nonverbal abilities, or process-
ing speed (table 4), and dose of levetiracetam was not
predictive of poorer outcome. Consistently, being
exposed to levetiracetam was not associated with
poorer outcomes on language, memory, attention,
and executive functioning or behavioral variables
when outcomes were adjusted for covariates (table 5
and table e-1 at Neurolgy.org). Similarly for topira-
mate, no association with prenatal exposure was
found for FSIQ, verbal abilities, nonverbal abilities,
or processing speed, and dose of topiramate was not
predictive of poorer outcomes (table 4). Regarding
specific cognitive and behavioral outcomes, prenatal
exposure to topiramate was not associated with poorer

 outcomes across the domains but had higher scores
(better performance) on one aspect of attention and
executive functioning in comparison to the control
children (table 5 and table e-1). A dose effect was
observed for valproate, with higher doses of valproate
associated with poorer FSIQ, verbal and nonverbal
abilities. In particular, an increment of 800 mg
(median value) of valproate was significantly associated
with a 10.6-point reduction in FSIQ, an 11.2-point
reduction in verbal abilities, and an 11.1-point reduc-
tion in nonverbal abilities (table 4). Secondary analyses
suggested that valproate may also be associated with
poorer outcomes on the expressive naming index as
well as the behavioral variables of withdrawal, adapt-
ability, and daily living skills but not other measures of
language, memory, attention and executive function-
ing, or behavioral outcomes (table 5 and table e-1).
AED comparisons by dose. At half the median dose of
valproate (400 mg/d), no significant differences were
found in comparison to children exposed to half the
median doses for levetiracetam (750 mg/d) or topira-
mate (100 mg/d) or in comparison to no-medication
controls for FSIQ, verbal or nonverbal reasoning
(table e-2). Comparison at the median doses suggests
differences in verbal reasoning between exposures to
valproate (800 mg/d) in comparison to no-medication
controls and topiramate (200 mg/d). However, as dose
increased, valproate was associated with reductions in
FSIQ, verbal and nonverbal reasoning. For example, at
2 times the median dose of valproate (1,600 mg/d)
when compared to the no-medication group and
exposure to 2 times the median doses of topiramate
(400 mg/d) and levetiracetam (3,000 mg/d), the
reduction in FSIQ ranged from 11 to 16 IQ points,
reduction in verbal reasoning ranged from 17 to 21
points, and reduction in nonverbal reasoning ranged
from 6 to 14 (table e-2). Despite not adjusting for
multiple testing when comparisons at different dose
levels are made, the results show consistently that as
valproate dose increases, the reductions in FSIQ, verbal
and nonverbal components are more pronounced.
Influence of nonexposure variables. Regarding confound-
ers, maternal epilepsy type was extensively investigated
both as a covariate and as an interaction term with treat-
ment type and no association with child IQ or specific
cognitive abilities was demonstrated (data not shown,
but available on request). Exposure to seizures was also
not associated with outcome. Consistent with the child
developmental literature, higher maternal IQ was associ-
ated with improved child performance on FSIQ, verbal
abilities, and nonverbal abilities as well as language and
memory abilities and aspects of attention and executive
skills (tables 4 and 5). Socioeconomic status was also
associated with child performance, with those who had
parents in professional employment scoring 6.1 points
higher in FSIQ with similar associations for verbal abil-
ities and aspects of attention and executive functioning
(table 4). Tables 4 and 5 and table e-1 include further
information pertaining to the influence of covariates on
specific outcome variables.
DISCUSSION This cross-sectional study indicated
that there was no association between child cognitive
functioning during middle childhood and exposure
to levetiracetam in utero. This group was adequately
powered to detect a medium effect size with 89%
power (GPower 3.1.3)20 and therefore smaller levels
of discrepancy cannot be ruled out. A lack of an
association is consistent with our group’s earlier
finding in infants younger than 24 months of age10
and in later infancy,9 although there was group
overlap with this later cohort. Dose is a key concept
in terms of teratogenicity, and increasing doses of
levetiracetam were not found to be associated with
poorer outcomes in comparison to control children
and were documented to have superior outcomes to
the children exposed to higher doses of valproate. The
lack of significant dose effect for levetiracetam also
supports preclinical studies in which it is reported,
even at high doses, to be exempt from the increased
neuronal apoptosis seen following administration of
other AEDs in rodents.21 Levetiracetam is reportedly
becoming an encouraging alternative to valproate in

 the treatment of generalized epilepsy22 because of
its lack of association with major congenital
malformations.2,23
Topiramate has been associated with an increased
rate of major congenital malformation (4.2%),2 with
a specific association to orofacial clefts24 and there-
fore should be considered teratogenic. The group of
children included exposed to topiramate was small
and therefore only large differences in neurodevel-
opment would have reliably been detected and the
results must be interpreted with caution. No signif-
icant level of difference between the children
exposed to topiramate or control children were
documented in the adjusted model and increasing
doses of topiramate were not associated with poorer
outcomes. Furthermore, children exposed to higher

 doses of topiramate were associated with more favor-
able cognitive outcomes than those exposed to
higher levels of valproate. The reported findings here
are in conflict with the small group (n 5 9) reported
previously.11 However, the cohort in this present
study was larger, comprised children from a narrower
age range, utilized blinded assessments, and under-
took statistical control for a wider number of likely
confounding factors, which may account for the dif-
ference in findings. A lack of an association between
topiramate exposure and impaired neuropsycholog-
ical function would support preclinical data, which
suggests that, at therapeutic ranges, administration
of topiramate in isolation is not associated with
increased levels of apoptosis in rodent models.21,25
In relation to valproate, the findings of this study
are consistent with those of other cohorts in demon-
strating that prenatal exposure to valproate was asso-
ciated with significant risks to child cognitive ability
in a dose-dependent manner.6–8,26–29 The mean IQ
point reduction ranged from 10 to 11 points, which
is consistent with the associated decreases reported in
a recent meta-analysis.8 Reduction in group means leads
to increased numbers of children falling below the aver-
age range, which is demonstrated for the valproate group
with 19% falling over 1 SD from the mean for FSIQ in
comparison to 6% of control children. Having an FSIQ
below the average range has implications for educational
outcomes in the teenage years.30
The median dose in this valproate-exposed group
was relatively low regarding the treatment of seizures
(800 mg daily) but consistent with the reported mean
dose from other cohorts.7,26 The data here highlighted
the substantial effect higher doses of valproate have
on cognitive functioning in comparison to higher
doses of topiramate and levetiracetam.
No significant influence of maternal epilepsy type
or exposure to seizures was found to be associated
with child cognitive functioning, supporting previous
results.6,7,29 However, as discussed below, limited
information was available on seizure exposure.
A major strength of this study is its utilization of
a national register to reduce the latency between
AED monotherapy license and teratology risk infor-
mation. Valproate, for example, was licensed for
monotherapy use in the 1970s but the associated risks
of prenatal exposure to later child cognition were only
delineated within the last decade. Such a delay in infor-
mation undermines clinical risk–benefit decision-
making, and the utilization of participants collected
in malformation registers may reduce the time taken to
provide the first evidence. Further methodologic
strengths of this study included its prospective collec-
tion of pregnancy details, which reduces recall bias, the
utilization of blinded standardized neuropsychological
assessment, the collection and control for a number of
influential covariates, assessment of school-age child
IQ, and adequate power to detect large effect sizes.
Finally, the consideration of AED dose is important
in view of the principles of teratology.31
There are a number of limitations to the present
study. Pregnancy registers represent only a small pro-
portion of women with epilepsy in the community
and therefore sampling bias is possible. The low rate
of recruitment highlights the challenges of using mal-
formation registers to collect neurodevelopmental
outcomes, but is consistent with the challenges expe-
rienced by others using this model of recruitment.28
The higher rate of participation in the levetiracetam
group is believed to be linked to 60% of this group
being assessed as part of an earlier study.9 Higher
recruitment/retention rates are reported for longitu-
dinal studies with multiple follow-ups across the early
childhood years,6,7 but such methodologies are costly
and may not facilitate collection of data for less fre-
quently prescribed AEDs. Retrospective recruitment
and collection of certain data (i.e., maternal alcohol
use) may lead biased results. The 4 groups, however,
were recruited and assessed identically and therefore it
was not thought that the differential outcomes were
attributable to recruitment bias. Of relevance, a recent
Cochrane review found comparable outcomes from
prospective longitudinal studies and retrospectively
recruited cohorts from prospective pregnancy regis-
ters.8 The use of data pertaining to seizure exposure
and AED dose at time of enrollment in UK-EPR
means that no information was available on seizure
exposure or AED dose alterations toward the end of
the pregnancy and the results should be viewed in
light of this. From a statistical viewpoint, although
multiple comparisons were considered to interpret
the results of the primary analysis for the IQ outcome,
the secondary analyses (which involved 23 different
statistical models) are merely exploratory, as well as
the comparisons across AEDs that were made at dif-
ferent dose levels. Finally, consideration of the age of
these children at assessment is required. In middle
childhood, cognitive development is still dynamic
and as age-appropriate cognitive skills become more
complex, differential results might be seen.
In conclusion, the potential risks to neurodevelop-
ment posed by prenatal exposure to valproate at higher
doses can be substantial and should be a central aspect
of preconceptual counseling. The documentation that
the IQ of school-age children exposed to levetiracetam
and topiramate is similar to nonexposed control chil-
dren is reassuring but replication and extension are
required.

Help Get the New Congress to Work for Neurology
The 2016 election may bring about the most sweeping changes in Congress that we have seen in
years, if not decades. Join your AAN colleagues at Neurology on the Hill from February 27–28,
2017, and help educate members of Congress so we can address critical health policy problems
together. If selected, you will receive training to bring you up-to-date on key issues. Then, we will
go to Capitol Hill for face-to-face meetings with congressional members and their staffs. The
Academy will cover airfare expenses and hotel accommodations. There is a general registration
fee of $150, or $50 for residents, fellows, and members residing in the Washington, DC, area.
Encourage your colleagues to apply as well. Space is limited and fills quickly. Learn more and apply
by November 20, 2016, at AAN.com/view/2017NOH.
