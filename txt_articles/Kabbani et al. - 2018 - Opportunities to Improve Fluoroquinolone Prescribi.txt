The Food and Drug Administration warned against fluoroquino-
lone use for conditions with effective alternative agents. An esti-
mated 5.1% of adult ambulatory fluoroquinolone prescriptions 
were for conditions that did not require antibiotics, and 19.9% were 
for conditions where fluoroquinolones are not recommended first-
line therapy. Unnecessary fluoroquinolone use should be reduced.
Keywords. antibiotics; fluoroquinolones; resistance.
Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are the third most commonly pre-
scribed outpatient antibiotic class in the United States in adults, 
with an estimated 115 prescriptions per 1000 persons annu-
ally [1]. In 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
updated the 2008 boxed warning to highlight serious side effects 
associated with systemic FQ use, including damage to tendons, 
muscles, joints, nerves, and the central nervous system [2]. The 
warning advises healthcare providers to not use FQ when the 
potential risks outweigh the benefits, specifically in conditions 
such as acute bronchitis where antibiotics are not typically 
required, and acute sinusitis and uncomplicated urinary tract 
infections for which other effective antibiotic treatment options 
exist [2]. In light of these recent warnings, we aimed to quantify 
and characterize the distribution and frequency of FQ prescrib-
ing for ambulatory care visits in US adults and to quantify and 
identify specific target conditions to focus public health and 
antibiotic stewardship efforts to reduce inappropriate FQ use.
METHODS
Data from 3 data sources were combined to report the num-
ber of outpatient FQ prescriptions and to characterize the 
distribution of diagnoses associated with FQ prescriptions. 
The QuintilesIMS™ Xponent database was used to report the 
number of outpatient FQ prescriptions dispensed in 2014. This 
database represents 100% of outpatient prescription activity for 
retail pharmacies projected from data collected from over 90% 
of retail pharmacies [1].The distribution of diagnoses leading 
to FQ prescriptions were estimated using the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Center for 
Health Statistics’ National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 
(NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care 
Survey (NHAMCS) data from 2013 to 2014 [3]. These cross-
sectional surveys systematically sample office-based physicians 
(NAMCS) and emergency departments (NHAMCS) in nonfed-
eral hospitals throughout the United States. Visits among per-
sons ≤19 years of age were excluded because FQ are infrequently 
prescribed to children. Diagnoses were coded by International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM) codes. Diagnostic categories for common outpa-
tient infectious diseases were created as described previously [3].
Specific diagnoses for which no antibiotic therapy should be 
prescribed, that is, viral upper respiratory tract infections and 
bronchitis, were identified [4]. Diagnoses for which FQ are 
not recommended as first-line agents were highlighted. These 
conditions included sinusitis and uncomplicated cystitis in 
women, for which the guideline-recommended antibiotics are 
amoxicillin with/without clavulanate and nitrofurantoin or 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, respectively [5, 6]. NAMCS/
NHAMCS provide national estimates on antibiotic prescribing 
in physician offices and emergency departments, and account 
for approximately 64% of total FQ dispensing as measured by 
Xponent from all outpatient pharmacies. Thus national esti-
mates of overall outpatient prescriptions were calculated by 
multiplying the percentage of NAMCS/NHAMCS visits for each 
diagnostic category with total number of outpatient FQ trans-
actions in 2014 reported by QuintilesIMS™ and the CDC. The 
rank and proportion of FQ out of total antibiotics prescribed 
for each diagnostic category were also calculated. All statis-
tical analyses were performed in STATA (StataCorp 2015. Stata 
Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp 
LP) and accounted for components of the complex survey de-
sign (patient visit weights, strata, and primary sampling unit 
design variables). Estimates not meeting standards of reliability 
or precision (if based on fewer than 30 sampled visits or if the 
relative standard error < 0.3) were not reported [3].
RESULTS
During 2014, 31.5 million FQ courses were dispensed to adults 
from U.S. community pharmacies (QuintilesIMS™ Xponent

 BRIEF REPORT • CID 2018:67 (1 JULY) • 135
data). The distribution of visits by condition associated with 
FQ prescribing (NAMCS/NHAMCS data) is shown in Table 1. 
The largest proportion (24.5%) of FQ prescriptions were pre-
scribed for genitourinary conditions. Uncomplicated urinary 
tract infections represented the largest subgroup of genitouri-
nary conditions treated with FQ (15.0%). FQ were prescribed 
for 40.3% of uncomplicated urinary tract infections, more than 
any other antibiotic class. Respiratory conditions accounted for 
21.6% of all FQ prescriptions. Of antibiotics prescribed for all re-
spiratory conditions, FQ were the third most common antibiotic 
class prescribed. Skin and gastrointestinal conditions accounted 
for 14.6% and 11.6% of all FQ prescriptions respectively.
Viral upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis, for 
which no antibiotics should be prescribed, led to an estimated 
1.6 million FQ prescriptions (5.1% of total). Sinusitis and un-
complicated urinary tract infections, for which FQ are not 
first-line recommended therapy, accounted for an estimated 6.3 
million FQ prescriptions (19.9% of total) (Table 1).
DISCUSSION
In 2014, 31.5 million FQ prescriptions were dispensed; visits 
for genitourinary, respiratory, skin, and gastrointestinal con-
ditions accounted for most FQ prescriptions. An estimated 7.9 
million FQ prescriptions were for conditions where no anti-
biotics should be prescribed or for which FQ are not first-line 
recommended therapy, which include acute bronchitis, acute 
sinusitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections, condi-
tions recently highlighted in the FDA warning [2]. With the 
documentation of serious adverse events and rising rates of 
antibiotic resistance, prescribing FQ only when indicated and 
recommended will improve patient outcomes. Although all 
antibiotics can cause potential adverse events, the perceived 
safety and risk-benefit ratio when prescribing FQ needs to be 
reconsidered. FQ are also associated with a high risk for sub-
sequent development of Clostridium difficile infection; a recent 
ecologic analysis of data from England suggested that restrict-
ing FQ prescribing played the most important role in decreasing 
the incidence of C. difficile infections at the country level [7].
FQ have well-documented efficacy, a broad spectrum of 
activity covering many common pathogens, favorable phar-
macokinetics, and perceived safety, which may have led to 
overprescribing [8]. However, in this analysis, an estimated 1.6 
million FQ prescriptions were for acute respiratory conditions 
for which antibiotics are not recommended. Although antibiot-
ics are not always indicated in cases with acute sinusitis, even 
when antibiotics are needed, quinolones are not first-line agents 
[4]. A recent study reported that physicians prescribe appro-
priate first-line antibiotic therapy in only 37% (95% confidence 
interval 32%–43%) of cases of sinusitis and pharyngitis in adults 
[9], indicating that improvements in antibiotic selection for

 136 • CID 2018:67 (1 July) • BRIEF REPORT
specific conditions are needed. FQ prescribing may be appro-
priate in some cases of acute bacterial sinusitis and uncompli-
cated urinary tract infection, such as in patients who have a 
beta-lactam allergy, risk for an antibiotic- resistant infection, or 
failed initial therapy. Also, FQ may be appropriate for specific 
clinical situations such as the treatment of urinary tract infec-
tion in males. However, FQ were the most commonly prescribed 
antibiotic for uncomplicated urinary tract infections, where the 
Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) treatment guide-
lines emphasize the avoidance of FQ for this condition due to the 
possibility of “collateral damage” with their use. IDSA cited that 
FQ should be reserved for more serious infections, where the 
broad spectrum of activity of FQ is important [6]. In addition, 
resistance to ciprofloxacin has been increasing among urinary 
pathogens, specifically Escherichia coli, in adult female outpa-
tients [10]. Prescribing FQ for empiric treatment of uncompli-
cated cystitis in adult women should be discouraged. Pediatric 
providers have long considered FQ to be unsafe in children, and 
treated acute respiratory conditions and urinary tract infections 
without their use. If recommended first-line therapies were used 
for sinusitis and uncomplicated urinary tract infections, a -pro-
portion of 6.3 million FQ prescriptions per year reported in this 
study would be avoided. Although not specifically mentioned in 
the recent FDA warning [2], in this analysis gastroenterological 
and skin conditions accounted for over 8 million prescriptions 
in 2014. The practice of treatment of gastrointestinal infections 
with FQ is changing, with rising rates of resistance, particularly 
among Campylobacter species in certain destinations in Asia 
[11]. FQ are not recommended for treating Staphylococcus aur-
eus, the most common cause of skin infections, as resistance may 
emerge during therapy [12]. However, in our study, 26.1% of FQ 
prescriptions were given for gastroenterological and skin condi-
tions, where FQ are not considered first-line agents.
One limitation of this analysis is that total outpatient FQ 
prescriptions tin QuintilesIMS™ Xponent FQ prescribing data 
may not be distributed similarly to the NAMCS/NHAMCS data 
across clinical diagnoses. Also urgent care and retail clinics are 
not included in NAMCS/NHAMCS, so these results may not 
be generalizable to all outpatient settings. ICD-9-CM codes 
are used in NAMCS/NHAMCS data, which may not differ-
entiate all the diagnoses of interest, and may not fully reflect 
the clinical diagnosis. Also “diagnosis shifting,” where clini-
cians select a more antibiotic-appropriate diagnosis, may also 
occur. Assessing appropriateness of prescribing in this analysis 
was difficult, since information on antibiotic allergies, previous 
treatment history and patient comorbidities was not collected, 
which could have justified FQ prescribing, even when not rec-
ommended by treatment guidelines. The most recently available 
data from NAMCS/NHAMCS are several years old; however, 
there is no indication that there have been significant changes in 
antibiotic prescribing rates in adults (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/
PSA/AUMapView.html).
This analysis suggests that a quarter of FQ prescriptions were 
given for conditions for which no antibiotics are indicated, or 
for which FQ are not recommended first-line therapy. With the 
threats to patient safety and rising rates of antibiotic resistance, 
FQ should not be prescribed for conditions where alternative 
effective therapies are recommended. Antibiotic stewardship 
efforts should target inappropriate FQ prescribing in adults, 
specifically for acute respiratory tract infections for which no 
antibiotics are needed, and for ambulatory infections for which 
FQ are not recommended first-line therapy. This will optimize 
clinical outcomes by reducing unnecessary antibiotic therapy 
and preventing FQ adverse drug reactions.
