Abstract
Background
Prescription opioid use is highly associated with risk of opioid-related death, with 1 of every
550 chronic opioid users dying within approximately 2.5 years of their first opioid prescrip-
tion. Although gabapentin is widely perceived as safe, drug-induced respiratory depression
has been described when gabapentin is used alone or in combination with other medica-
tions. Because gabapentin and opioids are both commonly prescribed for pain, the likeli-
hood of co-prescription is high. However, no published studies have examined whether
concomitant gabapentin therapy is associated with an increased risk of accidental opioid-
related death in patients receiving opioids. The objective of this study was to investigate
whether co-prescription of opioids and gabapentin is associated with an increased risk of
accidental opioid-related mortality.
Methods and findings
We conducted a population-based nested case–control study among opioid users who were
residents of Ontario, Canada, between August 1, 1997, and December 31, 2013, using admin-
istrative databases. Cases, defined as opioid users who died of an opioid-related cause, were
matched with up to 4 controls who also used opioids on age, sex, year of index date, history of
chronic kidney disease, and a disease risk index. After matching, we included 1,256 cases
and 4,619 controls. The primary exposure was concomitant gabapentin use in the 120 days
preceding the index date. A secondary analysis characterized gabapentin dose as low (<900
mg daily), moderate (900 to 1,799 mg daily), or high (�1,800 mg daily). A sensitivity analysis
examined the effect of concomitant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use in the

 preceding 120 days. Overall, 12.3% of cases (155 of 1,256) and 6.8% of controls (313 of
4,619) were prescribed gabapentin in the prior 120 days. After multivariable adjustment, co-
prescription of opioids and gabapentin was associated with a significantly increased odds of
opioid-related death (odds ratio [OR] 1.99, 95% CI 1.61 to 2.47, p < 0.001; adjusted OR [aOR]
1.49, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.88, p < 0.001) compared to opioid prescription alone. In the dose–
response analysis, moderate-dose (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.87, p < 0.001; aOR 1.56, 95%
CI 1.06 to 2.28, p = 0.024) and high-dose (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.58 to 3.08, p < 0.001; aOR 1.58,
95% CI 1.09 to 2.27, p = 0.015) gabapentin use was associated with a nearly 60% increase in
the odds of opioid-related death relative to no concomitant gabapentin use. As expected, we
found no significant association between co-prescription of opioids and NSAIDs and opioid-
related death (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27, p = 0.113; aOR 1.14, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.32, p =
0.083). In an exploratory analysis of patients at risk of combined opioid and gabapentin use,
we found that 46.0% (45,173 of 98,288) of gabapentin users in calendar year 2013 received at
least 1 concomitant prescription for an opioid. This study was limited to individuals eligible for
public drug coverage in Ontario, we were only able to identify prescriptions reimbursed by the
government and dispensed from retail pharmacies, and information on indication for gabapen-
tin use was not available. Furthermore, as with all observational studies, confounding due to
unmeasured variables is a potential source of bias.
Conclusions
In this study we found that among patients receiving prescription opioids, concomitant treat-
ment with gabapentin was associated with a substantial increase in the risk of opioid-related
death. Clinicians should consider carefully whether to continue prescribing this combination
of products and, when the combination is deemed necessary, should closely monitor their
patients and adjust opioid dose accordingly. Future research should investigate whether a
similar interaction exists between pregabalin and opioids.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Gabapentin is a drug often used together with opioids to treat chronic pain, and both of
these drugs have been shown to suppress breathing, which can be fatal.
• Concomitant opioid use can also increase the amount of gabapentin absorbed by the
body, potentially leading to higher risks when these drugs are used together.
• Despite these potential risks, so far no studies have examined whether the concomitant
use of gabapentin and opioids really increases the likelihood of accidental opioid-related
death and whether this risk is dependent on gabapentin dose.
• If there is an important interaction between these drugs, this would be of high clinical
importance given the common combined use of these drugs.

 What did the researchers do and find?
• We conducted a matched case–control study among people treated with opioid painkill-
ers in Ontario, the most populous province of Canada.
• We determined concomitant gabapentin exposure among 1,256 individuals (cases) who
died of an opioid-related cause and 4,619 matched controls.
• We found that concomitant gabapentin and opioid exposure was associated with a 49%
higher risk of dying from an opioid overdose.
What do these findings mean?
• Clinicians should take great caution when combining gabapentin and opioids.
• Patients treated with opioids and gabapentin should be closely monitored, and may
need to have their doses adjusted to avoid potential drug overdose.
Introduction
Prescription opioid overdoses are an ongoing public health concern across North America,
contributing to more than 15,000 deaths in the United States in 2015 [1]. Most opioid-related
deaths result from respiratory depression, and co-administration of central nervous system
(CNS) depressants is an important and avoidable risk factor for death. Recent evidence showed
that co-prescription of benzodiazepines with opioids increases the risk of overdose death
nearly 4-fold [2], leading to the introduction of black box warnings on the packaging for both
products in August 2016 [3]. Furthermore, prescription opioid use has been shown to be
highly associated with future risk of opioid-related death, with 1 of every 550 chronic opioid
users dying within approximately 2.5 years of their first opioid prescription [4].
Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant commonly used as an adjunct for the treatment of
chronic pain [5]. Although gabapentin is widely perceived as safe [5,6], drug-induced respi-
ratory depression has been described when gabapentin is used alone or in combination with
other medications [7–10]. Indeed, the product monograph was amended in 2014 to warn
about possible respiratory depression when combined with opioids [11]. Potential risk fac-
tors for gabapentin-related respiratory depression include advancing age, renal insuffi-
ciency, chronic lung disease, and dose. The role of dose is particularly important in light of
data indicating a 44% increase in systemic gabapentin exposure following its administration
with morphine [8–10,12,13], likely reflecting increased drug absorption from lowered intes-
tinal motility [12].
Because gabapentin and opioids are both commonly prescribed for pain, the likelihood of
co-prescription is high [14–17]. However, to our knowledge, no published studies have exam-
ined whether concomitant gabapentin therapy is associated with an increased risk of acciden-
tal opioid-related death in patients receiving opioids. We investigated this question in a cohort
of adults receiving prescription opioids in Ontario, Canada. We hypothesized that individuals
co-prescribed opioids and gabapentin would have a higher risk of opioid-related death, and
that there would be a dose–response gradient with increasing gabapentin dose.

 Methods
Setting
We conducted a population-based nested case–control study of adults dispensed opioid anal-
gesics under the Ontario Public Drug Programs between August 1, 1997, and December 31,
2013. All residents of Ontario receive publicly funded physician and hospital care. Public drug
coverage for prescription medications is provided to individuals aged 65 years and older, as
well as those who are unemployed, are receiving disability benefits, have high drug costs rela-
tive to their net household income, are receiving home care services, or reside in a long-term
care home. The study protocol (S1 Text) was approved by the research ethics board of Sunny-
brook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario.
Data sources
We used the Ontario Drug Benefit (ODB) database to identify prescription medications dis-
pensed to eligible residents of Ontario over the study period, and the Ontario Health Insurance
Plan database to identify services rendered by physicians. We used the Canadian Institute for
Health Information’s Discharge Abstract Database and National Ambulatory Care Reporting
System to identify diagnoses and procedures provided during hospital admissions and emer-
gency department visits, respectively. We used the Registered Persons Database, which con-
tains information on every Ontarian ever issued a health card, to identify demographic
information. We used the Ontario Cancer Registry and the Ontario Diabetes Database (ODD)
to capture diagnoses of cancer and diabetes, respectively. The ODD is a database constructed
using administrative claims data that was shown to have a sensitivity of 86%, specificity of
97%, and positive predictive value of 80% against primary care physician diagnoses as the
external criterion in a validation study [18]. Similarly, we used an algorithm in our hospitaliza-
tion and physician claims data to define chronic kidney disease that has been shown in a vali-
dation study to have a specificity of 97% against laboratory measures of serum creatinine as
the external criterion [19]. Finally, we abstracted detailed information on confirmed opioid-
related deaths from the Office of the Chief Coroner of Ontario using methods described previ-
ously [20]. In Ontario, all sudden or unexpected deaths are investigated by a medical coroner
to determine cause and manner of death. This rigorous investigation incorporates interviews
as well as autopsy findings and postmortem toxicology to confirm cause of death. Our data
capture all cases in which the findings of this investigation confirmed that opioids contributed
to death, either alone or in combination with another drug or alcohol. Therefore, overdose
deaths due to opioids alone or due to the combined sedating effects of opioids and gabapentin
would be identified in this database. These data are used regularly to study opioid overdose
deaths in Ontario [4,21–23]. All datasets were linked using unique, encoded identifiers, and
were analyzed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES; https://www.ices.on.ca).
Identification of patients and outcomes
We identified a cohort of ODB-eligible individuals aged 15 to 105 years who were treated with
at least 1 opioid prescription over the study period, including oral formulations of morphine,
codeine, oxycodone, meperidine, and hydromorphone, as well as transdermal fentanyl
patches. We excluded prescriptions for rarely used opioids (such as pentazocine or anileri-
dine), parenteral or intranasal opioid formulations, and methadone, which in Ontario is prin-
cipally used to treat opioid use disorders.
We defined cases as individuals from within this cohort who died from an opioid-related
cause over the study period, and excluded opioid overdoses deemed to be suicides or homicides

 by the investigating coroner. We defined the index date as the date of death. The index date
for potential controls was randomly assigned according to the distribution of index dates
for included cases. We excluded individuals with invalid identifiers and those with a prior
diagnosis of cancer or evidence of palliative care in the 6 months preceding the index date.
Consequently, our analyses were limited to patients receiving opioids for non-cancer pain.
We required that all study patients have at least 1 opioid prescription overlapping with their
index date, and at least 6 months of continuous eligibility for public drug benefits prior to
their index date.
To increase the comparability of cases and controls, we utilized a disease risk index to gen-
erate predicted probabilities of dying of an opioid-related death, using multiple demographic
characteristics, medical problems, and psychiatric disorders, as described previously [22,24].
Details of the components of this risk index can be found in S1 Table. We used incidence den-
sity sampling to match each case with up to 4 controls on their disease risk index (within 0.2
standard deviations), age (within 5 years), sex, year of index date (within 1 year), and history
of chronic kidney disease (prior 5 years). When a full number of matches could not be found,
we matched as many controls as possible to each case, and any available controls were
analyzed.
Exposure definition
We defined recent concomitant gabapentin exposure on the basis of at least 1 prescription in
the 120 days preceding each individual’s index date. In a secondary dose–response analysis, we
stratified the gabapentin dose into low dose (<900 mg daily), moderate dose (900 to 1,799 mg
daily), and high dose (�1,800 mg daily) to align with dose ranges suggested in the product
monograph (effective dose range 900 to 1,800 mg/day). Two post hoc sensitivity analyses were
conducted. In the first, we further stratified high-dose gabapentin use into high dose (1,800 to
2,499 mg daily) and very high dose (�2,500 mg daily) to investigate the association between
opioid-related death and higher gabapentin doses. In the second post hoc sensitivity analysis,
we defined gabapentin exposure on the basis of a gabapentin prescription where the days’ sup-
ply overlapped the index date. To test the specificity of our findings, we conducted a prespeci-
fied sensitivity analysis in which we examined recent concomitant exposure to nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the prior 120 days because NSAIDs are not expected to
independently increase the risk of opioid-related death among patients receiving opioids.
Patient characteristics
We ascertained the average daily dose of opioids dispensed to each individual in the cohort by
identifying all opioid prescriptions overlapping their index date. The daily dose of each pre-
scription was calculated and converted into approximate milligrams of morphine or equivalent
(morphine milligram equivalent [MME]) using morphine equivalence ratios defined by the
Canadian National Opioid Use Guideline Group [25]. Opioid dose was grouped into catego-
ries as follows: <20 MME, 20 to 49 MME, 50 to 99 MME, 100 to 199 MME, and �200 MME.
We also identified a number of other patient characteristics, including sociodemographic
characteristics (age, sex, urban/rural location of residence, income quintile), past medication
use, Charlson Comorbidity Index (0, 1, 2 or more), history of alcohol use disorder, and health
services utilization (S1 Table).
Statistical analysis
We summarized patient characteristics using descriptive statistics, and used standardized
differences to compare cases and controls. Standardized differences are often used instead

 of p-values when studying large cohorts, and values > 0.1 are generally considered to represent
a meaningful difference [26]. Missing data for any covariates in the analysis were reported as
separate categories. In accordance with ICES privacy policies, whenever a cell count was � 5,
the cell count was censored to avoid potential re-identification of personal health information.
We used conditional logistic regression to compare the odds of dying of opioid-related
causes among opioid recipients co-prescribed gabapentin with the odds among those pre-
scribed opioids alone. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for all comparisons, and
adjusted all models for a number of important covariates, including opioid dose, age, medica-
tion use in the prior 120 days (pregabalin, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] antide-
pressants, other antidepressants, benzodiazepines, other psychotropic drugs/CNS depressants,
and methadone/buprenorphine, each considered separately), the number of drugs dispensed
in the past 6 months, receipt of a long-acting opioid formulation during the exposure window,
diagnosis of alcohol use disorder in the prior 3 years, Charlson Comorbidity Index, chronic
lung disease, diabetes, number of opioid prescribers in the past 6 months, and number of phar-
macies from which each person was dispensed opioids in the past 6 months. In our sensitivity
analysis of concomitant NSAID use, we also adjusted the model for gabapentin use in the past
120 days.
To estimate the potential number of people at risk of combined opioid and gabapentin use,
we created a cohort of gabapentin users in the last year of our study (calendar year 2013) and
defined a period of ongoing gabapentin use on the basis of a prescription refill within 150% of
the days’ supply of the prior prescription. We estimated the prevalence of co-prescription of
gabapentin and opioids by identifying all individuals in this cohort who received at least 1 pre-
scription for an opioid during the period of ongoing gabapentin use.
All analyses used a type I error rate of 0.05 as the threshold for statistical significance and
were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Cary, North
Carolina).
The reporting of this study is in accordance with the REporting of studies Conducted using
Observational Routinely collected health Data (RECORD) statement (S1 RECORD Checklist)
[27].
Results
We identified 2,914,971 ODB-eligible individuals who received a prescription opioid over the
study period; of these, 1,391 potential cases met our inclusion criteria (Fig 1), and 1,256
(90.3%) of these were matched to at least 1 control, leading to a total of 4,619 controls included
in our study. All cases had prescription opioids found on postmortem toxicology, and 24
(1.9%) also had heroin present in their system at the time of death. Of those with heroin
involved in their death, fewer than 6 had been exposed to a prescription for gabapentin in the
prior 120 days.
Baseline characteristics of cases and controls are presented in Table 1. The majority of cases
(94.5%) and controls (94.2%) were aged less than 65 years, and over 40% (42.1% of cases and
43.8% of controls) were in the lowest income quintile. As expected, cases tended to receive
higher opioid doses, were more likely to have received a long-acting opioid during the expo-
sure window, and were more likely to have recent exposure to antidepressants, benzodiaze-
pines, and other CNS depressants. Cases had more visits to physicians and a greater number of
prescriptions in the past 6 months.
Overall, 12.3% of cases (155 of 1,256) and 6.8% of controls (313 of 4,619) were prescribed
gabapentin in the prior 120 days. In the primary analysis, we found that the odds of an opioid-
related death was 49% higher among individuals recently exposed to gabapentin and opioids

 (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.49, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.88, p < 0.001) compared to those exposed to opi-
oids alone, even after extensive adjustment for potential confounders, including opioid dose
(Fig 2). In a sensitivity analysis considering only gabapentin prescriptions where the days’ sup-
ply overlapped the index date, the results were very similar (aOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.89, p =
0.005).
In our secondary analysis exploring the effect of gabapentin dose, we found that exposure
to a moderate (900 to 1,799 mg daily) or high dose (1,800 mg daily or more) of gabapentin was
associated with a nearly 60% increased odds of opioid-related death compared to exposure to

1.09 to 2.27, p = 0.015, for high doses), whereas exposure to a low gabapentin dose was not sig-
nificantly associated with an increased odds of opioid-related death (aOR 1.32, 95% CI 0.89 to
1.96, p = 0.174; Fig 2). In a post hoc sensitivity analysis, very high dose gabapentin use (2,500
mg daily or more) was associated with a nearly 2-fold increased odds of opioid-related death
(aOR 1.83, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.22, p = 0.036).
Finally, in our sensitivity analysis to test the specificity of our findings, as expected, we
found no significant association between recent exposure to concomitant NSAIDs and opioid-
related death (aOR 1.14, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.32, p = 0.083).
In our exploratory analysis of patients at risk of combined opioid and gabapentin use, we
found a total of 98,288 gabapentin users in calendar year 2013, of whom 45,173 (46.0%)

 received at least 1 concomitant prescription for an opioid. Furthermore, among our matched
cases and controls, approximately 8% of opioid users had also recently received a prescription
for gabapentin.
Discussion
In this large study spanning more than 16 years, we found that approximately 8% of patients
receiving opioids were co-prescribed gabapentin and that co-prescription was associated with
a 50% increase in the risk of dying of opioid-related causes. A very high dose of co-prescribed
gabapentin was associated with a near doubling of this risk. In contrast, and as expected, no
such risk was observed among opioid recipients concomitantly prescribed NSAIDs. Our find-
ings thus support the existence of a life-threatening drug–drug interaction between gabapentin
and opioids in routine clinical practice.
The mechanism by which gabapentin may increase the risk of death in opioid users likely
reflects both a pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction [5]. More specifically, it
likely reflects additive respiratory depression as well as increased gabapentin concentrations
with concomitant opioid use [12]. A pharmacokinetic interaction most likely reflects increased
gabapentin absorption, which occurs primarily in the upper small intestine [5]. Thus, opioid-
induced slowing of gastrointestinal transit could prolong the time spent within this narrow
absorption window and increase gabapentin bioavailability [5].
Our study has important implications for public health, particularly given the high degree
of co-prescription. Almost 10% of patients treated with an opioid in our study also used gaba-
pentin, while nearly half of patients treated with gabapentin were co-prescribed opioids. Simi-
larly, studies from the United States and United Kingdom have estimated that between 15%
and 22% of people with opioid use disorder are also misusing gabapentin [17]. Gabapentin is
frequently used as an adjunct to opioids for neuropathic pain syndromes, but physicians may
not be aware of the potential for respiratory depression with this drug; thus, increased aware-
ness among patients and clinicians about the potential for a life-threatening interaction
between these drugs is essential. When co-prescription is necessary, strategies for minimizing
the sequelae of this interaction should be considered, including cautious dose titration, dose
adjustment in the setting of co-morbid lung and kidney disease, and avoidance of other CNS
depressants. In addition, patients treated with this combination should be instructed to seek
medical attention immediately if symptoms of opioid overdose occur. Finally, because of preg-
abalin’s pharmacologic similarities to gabapentin, it is possible that pregabalin imparts a simi-
lar risk of overdose and death among opioid users, a hypothesis supported in part by cases of
respiratory depression associated with this drug [28]. We were unable to test this hypothesis in
our study due to the low prevalence of pregabalin prescribing over our study period (pregaba-
lin only became available on the public drug program in 2013), but suggest that this is an
important area of future research.
This study has several strengths, including its large size, the use of population-based
coroner’s records to ascertain opioid-related deaths, and the specificity of the association
of gabapentin co-prescription and opioid-related death (as evidenced by there being no
such association between co-prescription of NSAIDs and opioid-related death). However,
some limitations merit discussion. First, our study was limited to a population of individu-
als eligible for public drug coverage in Ontario, which includes the elderly (aged 65 and
older) and younger individuals receiving social assistance. Approximately 95% of the cases
and matched controls were younger than 65 years, which led the overall cohort to be gener-
ally of lower socioeconomic status (over 40% were in the lowest income quintile). There-
fore, these findings may not be generalizable to the broader population of opioid users.

 Second, we were only able to identify prescriptions reimbursed by the government and dis-
pensed from retail pharmacies. We could not determine drug adherence, whether individu-
als obtained additional drugs through cash payments or illicit purchases, or whether they
were using their prescription opioids as prescribed. While it is possible that this could bias
our analysis towards a significant finding if people concomitantly taking gabapentin and
opioids were more likely to source opioids illicitly, our finding that heroin involvement in
opioid-related deaths was highly concentrated among people not exposed to gabapentin
suggests that this had no major influence on our findings. Third, the CIs in our dose–
response analysis showed considerable overlap, and therefore the suggestion of a dose–
response gradient should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, we were unable to determine
the indication for gabapentin use, and so could not confirm whether these medications
were being used to treat pain or for indications such as anxiety or depression. However, it is
likely that the majority of gabapentin prescribing in this study was for a pain indication due
to its concurrent use with opioids. Finally, despite matching on several demographic and
clinical variables (including a disease risk index), our cases and controls differed on a num-
ber of measured covariates. Confounding by indication is also possible, particularly among
patients receiving the highest doses of gabapentin or opioids, for whom severe pain could
be a manifestation of serious underlying illness. However, we believe that confounding by
indication did not have considerable influence on our findings for several reasons. First, we
used a disease risk index to match cases to controls on a number of factors, including diag-
noses commonly associated with pain. Second, because we adjusted for opioid dose in all of
our analyses, our findings for gabapentin exposure are representative of the additional risk
of opioid-related death beyond that which is explained by escalating opioid doses. Third,
we adjusted our analyses for markers of severity of underlying disease, including comorbid-
ity, medications, and health service use, and excluded individuals receiving palliative care
and those with a prior cancer diagnosis. Finally, our tracer analysis found no association
of NSAID co-prescription with opioid-related death, suggesting that underlying pain is
not obfuscating our findings, and further mitigating concerns about confounding by
indication.
Conclusion
In this study we found that, among patients prescribed opioids, co-prescription of gabapentin
was associated with a considerable increase in the risk of opioid-related death, particularly at
higher doses. The clinical consequences of a potential drug–drug interaction are clear given
the large number of people at risk of this fatal outcome. Clinicians should consider carefully
whether to continue prescribing this combination of products and, when co-prescription is
deemed necessary, should closely monitor their patients and adjust opioid dose accordingly.
Future research should investigate whether a similar interaction exists between pregabalin and
opioids.
