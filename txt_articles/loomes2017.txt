What Is the Male-to-Female Ratio in Autism
Spectrum Disorder? A Systematic Review and
Meta-Analysis
Rachel Loomes, DClinPsy, Laura Hull, MSc, William Polmear Locke Mandy, DClinPsy, PhD
Objective: To derive the first systematically calculated
estimate of the relative proportion of boys and girls with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through a meta-analysis
of prevalence studies conducted since the introduction of
the DSM-IV and the International Classification of Diseases,
Tenth Revision.
Method: Preferred
Reporting
Items
for
Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were
followed. The Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases
were searched, and study quality was rated using a risk-
of-bias tool. Random-effects meta-analysis was used. The
pooled outcome measurement was the male-to-female
odds ratio (MFOR), namely the odds of being male in
the group with ASD compared with the non-ASD group.
In effect, this is the ASD male-to-female ratio, controlling
for
the
male-to-female
ratio
among
participants
without ASD.
Results: Fifty-four studies were analyzed, with 13,784,284
participants, of whom 53,712 had ASD (43,972 boys and
9,740 girls). The overall pooled MFOR was 4.20 (95% CI
3.84–4.60), but there was very substantial between-study
variability (I2 ¼ 90.9%). High-quality studies had a
lower MFOR (3.32; 95% CI 2.88–3.84). Studies that
screened the general population to identify participants
regardless of whether they already had an ASD diagnosis
showed a lower MFOR (3.25; 95% CI 2.93–3.62) than
studies that only ascertained participants with a pre-
existing ASD diagnosis (MFOR 4.56; 95% CI 4.10–5.07).
Conclusion: Of children meeting criteria for ASD, the
true male-to-female ratio is not 4:1, as is often assumed;
rather, it is closer to 3:1. There appears to be a diagnostic
gender bias, meaning that girls who meet criteria for ASD
are at disproportionate risk of not receiving a clinical
diagnosis.

A
utism
spectrum
disorder
(ASD)
is
a
neuro-
developmental condition characterized by impair-
ments
in
social
reciprocity
and
social
communication
and
restricted,
repetitive
patterns
of
behavior.1 It is highly heritable, persists across the lifespan,
and affects approximately 1% of the population.2,3 One
striking and consistent feature of ASD is that it is more
commonly diagnosed in boys than in girls.1 This has moti-
vated influential ideas about the nature and etiology of ASD,
such as the extreme male brain,4 female protective effect,5
and
female
autism
phenotype6
theories.
Further,
the
widely acknowledged excess of boys on the autism spectrum
influences day-to-day clinical and educational practice, for
example, when clinicians and teachers make decisions about
whether a child has autistic symptoms based in part on their
gender.7 As such, it is important to have a systematically
derived, precise estimate of the male-to-female ratio in ASD
to guide research and practice.
The DSM-5 states that “autism spectrum disorder is
diagnosed four times more often in males than in fema-
les.”1(p57) This 4:1 gender ratio is widely cited and comes from
work that calculated the mean male-to-female ratio from
population prevalence studies of ASD.8 Although such esti-
mates are useful as a rough guide to the male-to-female ratio
in ASD, they do not use meta-analysis to synthesize findings.
As such they do not take account of important factors such as
sample size and case-ascertainment method and so give equal
weight to all reviewed studies irrespective of their size,
design, and quality.
Further, simple averages of gender ratios do not capture a
key feature of the ASD gender ratio, namely its substantial
variability across studies. Even among epidemiologic studies
that implemented similar inclusion criteria and recruitment
methods, ASD male-to-female ratios show striking vari-
ability, ranging from 8:19 to 2:1.10 This heterogeneity is
currently little studied and therefore poorly understood. Its
investigation will be instructive about the true ratio of boys
to girls with ASD and can elucidate whether there are, as is
often suggested, diagnostic biases against girls with ASD.
Specifically, it will be valuable to examine formally between-
study variability in the ASD male-to-female ratio to discover
whether it is influenced by the following:
1. Study quality. If study quality is associated with variability
in the ASD male-to-female ratio, then particular weight
should be given to studies with the greatest methodologic

 merit, because these are likely to give the most precise,
valid estimates.
2. Case-ascertainment
method.
Active
case-finding
methods involve screening a population-based sample
in an attempt to identify all cases regardless of whether
they
have
already
come
to
clinical
attention.
In
contrast, passive case-finding studies review existing
databases (e.g., medical or special educational records)
or
contact
parents
by
mass-telephone
surveys
to
discover who within a given population has received
an ASD diagnosis.11 Such approaches are considered
passive because they pick up only those who have
already been officially identified. We argue that active
methods will yield more valid estimates of the male-to-
female ratio, because they are more likely to identify
individuals with ASD, even if they have been missed
by services. Further, comparisons of estimates from
active and passive studies will be instructive about
whether girls who would meet criteria for ASD are at
disproportionate risk of missing out on a clinical
diagnosis.
3. Date
of
study.
Prevalence
rates
of
ASD
have
increased over time, but it is unclear whether the
male-to-female
ratio
of
diagnosed
cases
is
also
changing.12
4. Participant IQ. It is commonly suggested that IQ affects
the ASD male-to-female ratio, with the proportion of
males often observed to be larger among people with
higher IQ.13 However, to date, this has not been formally
tested using meta-analysis.
5. Participant age. Girls with ASD tend to receive their
diagnosis later than boys,14 so the male-to-female ratio
could be higher in younger samples.
In summary, the present systematic review sought to
investigate the relative proportion of boys and girls on the
autism spectrum by a meta-analysis of published prevalence
studies. The initial aim was to ascertain the first systemati-
cally derived, weighted, pooled estimate of the male-to-
female ratio of ASD. The second aim was to enhance un-
derstanding of the true ASD male-to-female ratio by inves-
tigating the effects of study quality, active versus passive
case ascertainment, date of study, participant IQ, and
participant age.
METHOD
We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews.
Eligibility Criteria
Studies with the following characteristics were eligible for this
systematic review:
1. Investigation of ASD prevalence within a general population
sample of at least 1,500.
2. Diagnosis of ASD based on DSM-5, DSM-IV-TR, DSM-IV, or
International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)
criteria. This was designed to maximize generalizability to cur-
rent practice.
3. Information provided on numbers of girls and boys with ASD
and overall size of population studied to enable calculation of the
primary outcome measurement for this meta-analysis.
4. Year(s) of data collection reported.
5. Age range of sample from 0 to 18 years. It was decided to
exclude studies of prevalence in adults with ASD because such
research is currently rare, and ASD gender ratios for adults could
be different from those in child and adolescent populations.15
Information Sources and Search
Figure 1 shows the process by which articles were identified. A
systematic search was conducted on September 23, 2015 using the
Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases. These searches com-
bined keywords, Medical Subject Heading terms, and text words
“autism” OR “pervasive developmental disorde*” OR “Asperger*”
AND “epidemiology” OR “prevalence.” Also, the reference lists of
relevant articles and previous reviews of ASD prevalence were
obtained and screened for any additional studies missed by the
database search. Next, titles and abstracts of the articles identified
were screened against inclusion criteria. For articles passing this
screening stage, the full journal articles were read to determine
whether they met study inclusion criteria. This process was con-
ducted by the first author. To check its reliability, a second blinded
rater (L.H.) was given a random sample of 200 of the 1,012 articles
identified in the initial search stage and evaluated these against the
inclusion criteria. There was perfect (i.e., 100%) agreement between
the initial and second (blinded) raters about which of these articles
met the inclusion criteria for this review.
Data Extraction
The first (R.L.) and second (L.H.) authors independently extracted
data from all articles identified as meeting the study criteria using a
coding sheet designed for the present meta-analysis (available on
request from the corresponding author). Disagreements about data
points were discussed and resolved within the study team.
Assessing Risk of Bias
We used the Hoy Risk of Bias Tool (RoBT)16 for assessing meth-
odologic features of prevalence studies, which consists of 10 items
plus a summary assessment. Items 1 to 4 assess external validity,
and items 5 to 10 assess internal validity. Each item is scored “0”
(risk of bias absent) or “1” (risk of bias present), so that the scale has
an overall maximum of 10, with higher scores reflecting a greater
risk of bias. To assess reliability of the RoBT, all studies were blindly
double-rated by the first and second authors. Inter-rater reliability
for the total RoBT score, calculated using Case 2A intraclass corre-
lations, to assess levels of absolute agreement17 was high (intraclass
correlation 0.93; 95% CI 0.89–0.96). To derive a consensus RoBT
score, any disagreements on individual items were discussed be-
tween the first and second authors, and if these could not be
resolved in this way, then the senior author (W.P.L.M.) was
consulted.
Data Analysis
The outcome measurement summarized in this meta-analysis was
the odds ratio (OR) describing the odds of being male in the group
with ASD compared with the odds of being male in the group
without ASD. This was termed the “male-to-female odds ratio”
(MFOR). In effect, this presents the male-to-female ratio among
those with ASD, controlling for the male-to-female ratio among
participants without ASD. This MFOR is a purer measurement of
the ASD gender ratio than simply calculating a male-to-female

 ratio for diagnosed cases, because it takes account of any gender
imbalance in a study’s overall sample that could artificially inflate
or depress the ASD male-to-female ratio. The STATA (STATA
Corp., College Station, TX) command “metan” was used to
conduct a random-effects meta-analysis using the DerSimonian-
Laird procedure to derive a pooled MFOR and 95% CIs. The I2
statistic was used to measure between-study heterogeneity.18 An
I2 value of 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity beyond that
expected
from
sampling
error,
and
larger
values
indicate
increasing heterogeneity,19 with I2 above 75% indicative of
substantial heterogeneity. A Harbord test, implemented using the
STATA “metabias” command, was used to evaluate publication
bias.20
Meta-regressions, using the STATA “metareg” command,
were
conducted
to
investigate
influences
on
the
ASD
male-to-female ratio. Study characteristic variables (risk of bias,
case-ascertainment method, date of study, IQ of those with ASD,
and age of sample) were regressed separately against the log of
the MFOR. Where a significant association was found, we
checked for potential confounds (i.e., other study characteristic
variables that were significantly associated with the predictor
and the outcome) and controlled for these by adding them to the
model. We also present subgroup meta-analyses comparing
studies grouped according to predictors of interest: low versus
medium to higher risk of bias; passive versus active case ascer-
tainment; older (1992–2001) versus more recent (2002–2011)
studies; lower IQ (>50% of those with ASD had intellectual
disability) versus higher IQ (�50% of those with ASD had
intellectual disability); and younger (0–6 years) versus older
(6–18 years) participants.

 RESULTS
Overview
Figure 1 depicts the process by which studies were identi-
fied. Fifty-four met the inclusion criteria, consisting of
13,784,284 participants, 53,712 of whom were diagnosed
with ASD (43,972 boys and 9,740 girls). Details of each
study, including total risk-of-bias score, are presented in
Table S1 (available online). Fourteen studies were con-
ducted in North America, with 11 taking place in the
United States21-31 and 3 in Canada.32-34 Twenty-four were
European, with 12 carried out in the United Kingdom,3,35-45
and

other
13
being
carried
out
in
Sweden,46-49
Denmark,50-52
Norway,53-55
France,10
Iceland,56
and
Portugal.57 There were 11 Asian studies from Japan,58-60
China,61-62 Israel,63-64 Iran,65 Oman,66 South Korea,67 and
Taiwan.68 There were 2 studies from South America, con-
ducted
in
Aruba69
and
Venezuela,70
and
2
from
Australia.9,52 The studies spanned a period of 19 years
(1992–2011). The average estimated ASD prevalence across
all studies was 61.9 per 10,000 (standard deviation [SD]
48.5; 95% CI 48.6–75.1).
Risk of Bias and Case Ascertainment
Overall, the methodologic quality of the reviewed studies
was high. The RoBT used to evaluate study quality ranges
from 0 to 10, with higher scores being indicative of greater
risk of bias (i.e., lower quality). The most common risk of
bias detected was that 40 studies failed to demonstrate
explicitly that the study’s target population was a close
representation of the national population (RoBT item 1).
Also, most studies (n ¼ 37) did not use an assessment
instrument with well-established psychometric properties to
identify ASD cases (item 7). None of the studies scored
above 5 on the RoBT (median 3, mean 3.15, SD 1.29). For the
risk-of-bias subgroup meta-analysis, we grouped 17 studies
as having a low risk of bias (score 0–2, i.e., below the average
score) and 37 studies as having a medium or higher risk of
bias (score 35). Twenty studies used active case ascertain-
ment,
with
the
remaining
34
using
passive
case
ascertainment.
Age and IQ of Young People With ASD
Only half the studies (n ¼ 27 of 54) reported the average
age of the participants with ASD they identified (mean 7.45
years, SD 2.91 years). All studies reported an age range for
their sample. To avoid missing data, we estimated the
average age for each study by taking a midpoint between
the minimum and maximum of this age range. For the 27
studies for which precise age data were available, this
method provided an excellent estimate of the reported
average age of individuals with ASD (r ¼ 0.98, p < .001).
There were 24 studies that provided sufficient information
for the proportion of participants with an intellectual
disability (i.e., IQ �70) to be derived. Among these, the
mean percentage of people with ASD who did not have an
intellectual disability was 51.75% (SD 19.80%). For the
subgroup
meta-analyses,
we
categorized
studies
into
higher IQ (�50% of individuals with ASD had an IQ >70,
n ¼ 14) and lower IQ (<50% had an IQ >70, n ¼ 10)
groups.
MFOR in ASD
Inspection of a funnel plot and the Harbor test did not
suggest evidence of publication bias (p ¼ .458). As presented
in Table 1, the overall pooled MFOR was 4.20 (95% CI 3.84–
4.60). The I2 statistic was 90.9%, indicating a large amount of
between-study heterogeneity.

MALE-TO-FEMALE RATIO IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER: REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS
 Influences on the ASD MFOR
Table 2 presents the results of meta-regressions investi-
gating which study characteristics were associated with
variability
in
the
ASD
MFOR.
Risk
of
bias,
case-
ascertainment method (active versus passive), propor-
tion of participants with ASD with intellectual disability,
and date of study were each individually associated
with the MFOR. However, as presented in Table 2, once
we identified and controlled for confounds, only IQ and
case-ascertainment
method
(active
versus
passive)
remained significant predictors of the ASD male-to-female
ratio.
The
subgroup
meta-analyses
presented
in
Table
2
demonstrate the nature of these effects. Studies that identi-
fied a larger proportion of ASD cases with a co-occurring
intellectual disability showed a lower MFOR. Active case-
ascertainment studies showed a lower male-to-female ratio
than those relying on passive case ascertainment, an effect
that is depicted in Figure 2. For studies using passive case
ascertainment, the I2 statistic indicated substantial and
significant heterogeneity. In contrast, no significant hetero-
geneity was observed for the active case-ascertainment
studies.
We sought to explore whether the lower male-to-female
ratio in active studies was driven by the ascertainment of
more girls than in passive studies. We did this by exam-
ining, post hoc, the raw numbers of female and male
participants with ASD identified by active and passive
studies. Overall, active studies identified, on average, 65.6
cases per 10,000 (SD 63.8; 95% CI 35.7–95.4) compared
with 59.7 (SD 37.8; 95% CI 46.5–72.9) for passive studies.
Active studies identified, on average, 24.1 per 10,000 girls
(SD 22.5; 95% CI 13.6–34.6), whereas passive studies
identified 20.3 (SD 14.9; 95% CI 15.1–25.5). The opposite
pattern was observed for boys: active studies (mean 81.1,
SD 62.2; 95% CI 51.9–110.2) tended to identify fewer boys
per 10,000 than did passive ones (mean 95.4, SD 59.3; 95%
CI 74.7–116.1).
DISCUSSION
We conducted the first meta-analysis of the ASD male-
to-female ratio based on a systematic review of epidemio-
logic prevalence studies reported according to PRISMA
guidelines. The overall weighted MFOR (4.20; 95% CI 3.84–
4.60), derived from 54 prevalence studies, was consistent
with DSM-5’s assertion that among diagnosed cases, there
are 4 boys for every girl on the autism spectrum.1 However,
there was significant and very substantial variability among
the 54 studies, which calls into question the validity of this
overall estimate of the male-to-female ratio in ASD.
A different picture emerged when we looked only at
studies likely to yield the most valid estimates of the MFOR,
namely those with the highest methodologic quality (3.32;
95%
CI
2.88–3.84)
and
those
that
used
active
case-
ascertainment methods (3.25; 95% CI 2.92–3.61). In these
subgroups, MFORs were lower, and there was consistency
between studies, with no significant heterogeneity observed.
Accordingly, we argue that the current consensus that in
ASD there is a 4:1 male-to-female ratio is inaccurate: the true
male-to-female ratio for ASD is lower, that is, lower
than 3.5:1.
The
contrast
between
active
and
passive
case-
ascertainment studies is especially instructive. In studies
that actively sought cases of ASD, regardless of whether they
had already been identified by clinical or educational
services, there were on average 24 girls per 100 cases of ASD
(calculated from the MFOR of 3.25). In contrast, in passive
studies, which only identify cases if they have already been
diagnosed by services, there were 18 girls per 100 ASD cases.
This could arise because there are girls in the general pop-
ulation who, if assessed, would meet criteria for ASD, but
who do not in practice receive a clinical diagnosis. Consis-
tent with this interpretation is our observation that active
studies tended to identify more female ASD cases than did
passive studies. Our findings complement and extend
evidence that suggests girls with autism are at greater risk
than
boys
of
having
their
ASD
overlooked,71

 misdiagnosed,7,72 or identified late.14 It also is notable that
the lower male-to-female ratio in active studies was driven
in part by a lower prevalence of male ASD cases compared
with
passive
case-ascertainment
studies.
One
possible
interpretation of this is that active studies were more liable
to miss male cases. An alternative interpretation is that
passive studies, which rely on pre-existing diagnoses, over-
estimated the prevalence of ASD in boys.
There is a need to formulate and counter the gender bias
that leads to some girls with autism missing out on a timely
diagnosis and the accompanying support. One likely in-
fluence is the female autism phenotype, a female-specific

MALE-TO-FEMALE RATIO IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER: REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS
 autism presentation that is subtly distinct from conven-
tional conceptualizations of the disorder.12 In particular,
compared with boys, girls with autism are less likely to
show overt restricted interests, which would lessen the
chances of their autism being identified.73 Further, there is
some emerging evidence that girls are more likely to mask
their autistic difficulties by a process known as “camou-
flaging,” making timely, accurate diagnosis more chal-
lenging.7,12 Another factor potentially contributing to the
diagnostic bias could be key professionals (teachers, family
doctors, pediatricians, psychiatrists, psychologists, etc.)
holding gender stereotypes that ASD is a male disorder,
thus decreasing their sensitivity to autistic symptoms when
they
occur
in
girls.7
Future
research
should
address
whether the diagnostic bias against girls could be decreased
by increasing knowledge of the female autism phenotype
and conveying this information to diverse professionals
involved in case identification.
We found evidence for a diagnostic bias against girls who
meet criteria for ASD. It has been proposed that an addi-
tional nosologic bias exists, whereby some girls who have
severe autistic traits (i.e., social, communication, sensory,
and flexibility difficulties) fail to meet diagnostic criteria for
ASD because these lack sensitivity to the female pheno-
type.12 Evidence for this idea comes from the contrast
between the male-to-female ratio we observed for diagnos-
able cases (slightly higher than 3:1) and the male-to-female
ratio for people who score high for autistic traits on
parent-report measurements, which is commonly observed
to be no higher than 2:1.74,75 Thus, there is a disproportionate
number of girls who score high on measurements of autistic
traits but who do not, even if carefully assessed, have ASD
according to current diagnostic criteria. It is important to
study such individuals to discover whether they really do
have ASD that is being missed by male-centric diagnostic
criteria or whether their high scores on measurements of
autistic traits actually reflect different, non-autistic diffi-
culties, such as anxiety, depression, or low IQ.76
We found that lower IQ was associated with a lower
male-to-female ratio.13 This result should be treated with
caution, because it is based on only the subgroup of studies
(24 of 54) that provided sufficient IQ information. Further,
this systematic review was not designed to engage fully with
the challenges of measuring IQ among people with autism
and of assessing autism among people with intellectual
disability. Nevertheless, our finding of there being propor-
tionally more girls in lower-IQ ASD samples does accord
with other observations in clinical samples.13 It could arise
because IQ is more protective against ASD in girls than in
boys, making girls with normal-range IQ and diagnosable
ASD relatively rare.76 An alternative explanation is that
high-functioning girls with ASD are “flying under the
radar,” their difficulties especially likely to be missed by
current diagnostic rubric and methods, due to them having a
subtler, female-specific phenotype; and a greater capacity to
camouflage their difficulties.77,78
It is important to acknowledge that our findings are
based exclusively on studies using DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR,
and ICD-10 criteria, because there are no DSM-5 ASD
prevalence studies in the literature. Some have expressed
concern that the changes to ASD diagnostic criteria ushered
in by publication of the DSM-5 might have decreased their
sensitivity to girls with the condition, thus further inflating
the male-to-female ratio of diagnosed cases.79 However,
empirical work has tended to contradict this idea by
showing a similar male-to-female ratio for cases identified
by DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria.80,81 Therefore, it is likely that
our findings generalize to samples diagnosed according to
DSM-5 rules, but it will be important to continue to monitor
the gender ratio as DSM-5–based epidemiologic studies are
published. We included only studies of childhood and
adolescence. As the literature on adult autism prevalence
grows, it will be valuable to include this in future reviews.
One possibility is that the male-female ratio decreases in
adulthood, as women with ASD who were missed in
childhood refer themselves for assessment and self-report
symptoms.15
Although we have argued that the male-to-female ratio
in ASD is lower than previously assumed, it is worth stating
that our findings clearly confirm the basic fact that boys are
more vulnerable to ASD than girls. This emphasizes the
value of research that seeks to explain greater male
vulnerability, for example, by considering the role of sex
hormones4 and sex effects on genetic risk.5 Nevertheless,
this meta-analysis supports the view, expressed by members
of the autism community82 and by clinicians,83 that there is a
need to improve systems for the timely detection of ASD in
girls. &
