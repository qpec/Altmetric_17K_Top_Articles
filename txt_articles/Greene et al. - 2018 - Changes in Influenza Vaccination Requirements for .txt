Abstract
IMPORTANCE Annual influenza vaccinations are currently recommended for all health care
personnel (HCP) to limit the spread of influenza to those at high risk of developing serious
complications from the virus. Vaccination coverage has been shown to be significantly greater among
employers requiring and encouraging HCP to receive the annual influenza vaccination.
OBJECTIVES To compare the proportion of respondent hospitals requiring HCP to receive annual
influenza vaccination between 2013 and 2017 and to assess the degree to which these proportions
differed between Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-VA hospitals.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This national survey study included responses from 1062
infection preventionists between 2013 and 2017 from nationally representative samples of all VA and
non-VA hospitals in the United States. Data analysis was conducted from November 17, 2017, to
March 26, 2018.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Survey response indicating hospital requirement for annual
influenza vaccination of HCP.
RESULTS The overall response rate for the 2013 survey was 69.3% (non-VA, 70.6% [403 of 571]; VA,
63.5% [80 of 126]) and in 2017 was 59.1% (non-VA, 59.1% [530 of 897]; VA, 58.9% [73 of 124]).
Among all responding hospitals, mandatory influenza vaccination requirements for HCP increased
from 37.1% in 2013 to 61.4% in 2017 (difference, 24.3%; 95% CI, 18.4%-30.2%; P < .001). This change
was driven by non-VA hospitals, as requirement policies increased from 44.3% (171 of 386) in 2013
to 69.4% (365 of 526) in 2017 (difference, 25.1%; 95% CI, 18.8%-31.4%; P < .001). Conversely, there
was no significant change during this period in the proportion of VA hospitals that required influenza
vaccinations for HCP (1.3% [1 of 77] to 4.1% [3 of 73]; difference, 2.8%; 95% CI, −2.4% to
8.0%; P = .29).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite a substantial increase in mandates among non-VA
hospitals, we found that many non-VA hospitals and nearly all VA hospitals are still not currently
mandating influenza vaccinations for HCP. In addition to implementing other well-described
strategies to increase vaccination rates, health care organizations should consider mandating
influenza vaccinations while appropriately weighing and managing the moral, ethical, and legal
implications.

 Introduction
Annually, influenza accounts for significant morbidity, mortality, and cost burden.1 Since the 2010 to
2011 influenza season, estimates indicate that seasonal influenza-related illnesses ranged from 9.2
million to 35.6 million, with up to 710 000 hospitalizations leading to as many as 16.7 million medical
visits and up to 20 000 pneumonia- and influenza-related deaths.2 Similar clinical and economic
burdens were reported within the Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital setting.3,4 During the 2014 to 2015
influenza season, more than 11 500 confirmed cases and a hospitalization rate of 74.2 per 100 000
VA users were observed.4 Recent estimates of health care–associated influenza range between 1%
and 5%.5,6 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices continues to recommend that all health care personnel (HCP) be vaccinated annually
against influenza.7 Additionally, the US Department of Health and Human Services wants 90% of
HCP vaccinated by 2020.8 During the 2016 to 2017 influenza season, an estimated 78.6% of all HCP
received the annual influenza vaccination, with the highest coverage rates found among HCP
required by their employer to be vaccinated (96.7%).9
Although multiple national recommendations urge influenza vaccination for all HCP,10 not all
health care facilities mandate its receipt. As part of the national surveys of infection preventionists
(experts on practical methods of preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases)
conducted in 2013 and 2017,11,12 we assessed the degree to which hospitals require HCP to receive
annual influenza vaccination. As we were interested in determining how influenza vaccination
requirements for HCP have changed in recent years, we compared the proportion of respondent
hospitals requiring HCP to receive annual influenza vaccination, based on survey responses from
2013 and 2017. We also assessed the degree to which these proportions differed between VA and
non-VA hospitals.
Methods
Survey Procedures
This study was part of an ongoing panel survey in which we ask infection preventionists across the
United States every 4 years what practices their hospitals are using to prevent common health care–
associated infections.11 The study follows the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR)
reporting guideline. For the first wave in 2005, the national random sample was selected by identifying
all nonfederal, general medical, and surgical hospitals with an intensive care unit and at least 50 hospital
beds using the 2003 American Hospital Association (AHA) database. Hospitals were then stratified in
to 2 bed size groups (50-250 beds and �251 beds), and a random sample of 300 hospitals from each
group was selected. For the second (2009) and third (2013) waves of the ongoing study, the survey
was sent to the same hospitals sampled in 2005 with a few exceptions owing to closures or mergers
between the longitudinal survey points. Because data from the 2003 AHA database may no longer
reflect the current distribution of US hospitals, for the fourth (2017) wave we resampled based on AHA
fiscal year 2013 data. In the fourth wave, we randomly sampled 900 general medical and surgical
hospitals with an intensive care unit. Hospitals of all bed sizes were included in the 2017 sample. For
each survey wave, we sent surveys to all VA hospitals across the United States. This study obtained
institutional review board exemption from the University of Michigan and approval from the VA Ann
Arbor Healthcare System. The VA survey was anonymous and was conducted with a waiver of signed
informed consent.
The study surveys were mailed to the hospital infection preventionist. At hospitals that employ
more than 1 infection preventionist, we asked that the lead infection preventionist serve as the
primary respondent, although we encouraged consulting with others as needed to complete the
questionnaire. The survey process followed a modified Dillman approach,13 which included a first
mailing of the survey, a reminder letter or postcard after approximately 2 weeks, and additional
survey mailings at 4, 7, and 16 weeks to infection preventionists who had not yet responded.

 The survey instrument included questions about facility characteristics, the infection control
program, infection preventionists, and frequency of use of practices related to the prevention of
health care–associated infections. The third wave, distributed in May 2013, also included the
question, “Are health care workers at your hospital who provide patient care required to receive
influenza vaccination?” Respondents answering no to this question were asked to specify the reason
HCP were not required to receive the influenza vaccination. The fourth wave, distributed in May
2017, included the question, “Does your hospital mandate health care workers to receive annual
influenza vaccination?” along with questions regarding declination and requirements for
wearing masks.
Statistical Analysis
As only the third and fourth waves of the survey included questions regarding influenza vaccination
requirements for HCP, the current analysis compares responses from these waves. Descriptive
statistics were generated for select general hospital characteristics obtained from the 2013 AHA
survey and for the respective proportions of hospitals requiring annual influenza vaccination for HCP.
Confidence intervals were calculated using Proc Freq (SAS Institute Inc) with the RISKDIFF
statement, which gives the 95% Wald confidence interval based on asymptotic standard errors. To
determine differences in proportions, we used the χ2 test. All tests were 2-sided with a P value less
than .05 considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SAS software version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
The overall response rate for the 2013 survey was 69.3% (non-VA, 70.6% [403 of 571]; VA, 63.5%
[80 of 126]) and in 2017 was 59.1% (non-VA, 59.1% [530 of 897]; VA, 58.9% [73 of 124]). A
comparison of respondent and nonrespondent characteristics for both waves of the survey is
provided in the eTable in the Supplement.
A total of 1062 hospitals (463 in 2013 and 599 in 2017) were included in this analysis; 24
hospitals (20 from 2013 and 4 from 2017) did not answer the influenza vaccination questions and
were removed. Select hospital characteristics by VA status and survey year are shown in Table 1.
Approximately 60% of VA hospitals that participated in this study were in rural locations (2013: 19 of
31 [61%]; 2017: 18 of 30 [60%]) and 80% were teaching hospitals (2013: 65 of 79 [82.3%]; 2017: 56
of 72 [77.8%]). There were some differences seen in the participating non-VA hospital demographic
characteristics between 2013 and 2017. In 2017, there were fewer urban hospitals (2013: 300 of 358

(mean [SD], 2013: 273.0 [214.3] beds; 2017: 202.6 [189.5] beds; difference, −70.3%; 95% CI, −96.8
to −43.8%; P < .001). Overall, the percentage of hospitals reporting mandatory influenza
vaccinations for HCP increased from 37.1% in 2013 to 61.4% in 2017 (difference, 24.3%; 95% CI,
18.4%-30.2%; P < .001) (non-VA: 44.3% [171 of 386] in 2013 to 69.4% [365 of 526] in 2017;

difference, 2.8%; 95% CI, −2.4% to 8.0%; P = .29) (Figure).
Table 2 shows differences in mandate presence by survey year and hospital characteristics
among non-VA hospitals. Because too few VA hospitals mandated vaccinations, we were unable to
stratify results among VA hospitals based on hospital characteristics. Differences in the reported
presence of mandates by hospital characteristics were not observed among 2013 respondents from
non-VA hospitals. In 2017, mandates for HCP influenza vaccinations were reported by a higher
percentage of nonprofit hospitals compared with their for-profit counterparts (difference, 25.5%;
95% CI, 12.3%-38.8%; P < .001).
Aspects of hospital influenza vaccination policies by mandate status for 2017 are shown in
Table 3. All 368 hospitals mandating influenza vaccinations had allowable declinations. Of note, 94
of 366 hospitals (25.7%) with vaccination mandates in place did not impose penalties for
noncompliance with the hospital policy on influenza vaccination. Among the 231 hospitals that
reported not having a specific influenza vaccination mandate, 158 hospitals (68.4%) had policies for

 declination (non-VA: 75.2% [121 of 161]; VA: 52.9% [37 of 70]) and 94 hospitals (40.9%) had
requirements for wearing masks (non-VA: 57.8% [93 of 161]; VA: 1.4% [1 of 69]).
Discussion
Several important findings emerged from our national survey study. First, compared with 2013, when
less than half of hospitals mandated influenza vaccinations,12 there was a significant increase in
hospitals mandating HCP receive vaccinations in 2017 among non-VA hospitals. Second, despite an
increase in the proportion of non-VA hospitals mandating vaccinations, penalties for noncompliance
with the hospital policy on influenza vaccination were not universal among hospitals with mandates.
Third, few VA hospitals mandated receipt of HCP influenza vaccination, and we did not observe a
significant change between 2013 and 2017. While the VA did not specifically mandate receiving
influenza vaccinations at the time of the 2013 and 2017 surveys, a VA directive was subsequently
released in September 201714 articulating that all HCP were expected to receive the annual influenza
vaccination and were required to wear masks throughout the influenza season if unable or unwilling
to get vaccinated.
Mandating influenza vaccination remains a controversial topic, with uncertainty of the
effectiveness of HCP influenza vaccination in reducing patient morbidity and mortality,6,15-20
different conclusions regarding the grading of the evidence,21,22 and numerous legal and ethical
precedents to be carefully considered.23-26 Still, over the past several years, HCP influenza
vaccination coverage rates have continuously been greater than 95% among HCP required by their
employer to be vaccinated.9,27,28
Although mandating influenza vaccinations intuitively leads to increased vaccination coverage
of HCP, other strategies have proven to be successful. Strategies to promote influenza vaccinations,
including influenza education for HCP, free and easily accessible vaccinations, annual influenza
campaigns, incentives, signed declination policies, and using HCP vaccination rates as an
organizational quality measure, have been well described.29-32 Starting January 2013, acute care
hospitals participating in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting
Program were required to report HCP influenza vaccination data through the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network program.33 Public reporting of
vaccination data has been shown to increase vaccination coverage,34 and it is plausible that the
increase in vaccination mandates observed in this study stems, at least in part, from the
contemporaneous implementation of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid public reporting ruling.
We found that few VA hospitals explicitly mandated that HCP receive annual influenza
vaccination. As outlined in the goals of the 2017 to 2018 VA influenza vaccination program,35 since
the beginning of fiscal year 2013 VA facilities have been expected to gradually work toward the 2020
Healthy People goal of 90% influenza vaccination rate for HCP. Several VA hospitals have previously

 shown success in improving HCP vaccination rates in the absence of a national mandate. For
example, the Minneapolis VA Health Care System in Minneapolis, Minnesota, improved vaccination
rates from less than 25% to greater than 65% by implementing the use of mobile carts to facilitate
the delivery of vaccinations.36 The Lebanon VA Medical Center in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, increased
vaccination rates from approximately 50% to greater than 75% by offering time-off incentives to
vaccine recipients.29 Regardless of whether an organization has an official mandate for vaccinations,
establishing a written policy that states the organizational commitment to increasing vaccination
rates is among the recommended strategies for improving vaccination coverage among HCP.29
Limitations
Our study had limitations. First, the survey response rates were 69% in 2013 and 59% in 2017, and
our results may not be generalizable to all hospitals. Second, the updated 2017 responses were
obtained from a different sample of hospitals than in previous waves, with a statistically significantly
higher proportion of rural, nonteaching hospitals with smaller total bed sizes. Still, this updated
sample is nationally representative, and we did not detect differences in the presence of vaccination
mandates by these hospital characteristics. Third, it is possible that the observed increase in the
proportion of non-VA hospitals mandating vaccinations between surveys could have partially
stemmed from the slight difference in question wording. Of note, the 2013 survey question explicitly
focused on HCP providing patient care, potentially leading to an underestimation of the vaccination
requirement among all HCP. This may have been represented more in 2017 responses to the
reworded question, which lacked explicit mention of patient care provision. In the 2017 survey,
although the provision of patient care was not specified directly in our key question of interest, it was
included in the question regarding the requirement for wearing a mask for HCP not receiving the
influenza vaccination. As such, these details may have helped prompt the respondent to think of HCP
providing direct patient care. Fourth, it is possible that our study of the proportion of hospitals having
a mandate in place for HCP vaccination is underreported, as the presence of declination policies or
requirement for wearing a mask could be considered mandates. However, this potential
underreporting likely applied equivalently in both 2013 and 2017 survey years. Fifth, we did not
collect influenza infection rate data for the surveyed hospitals. As such, we were not able to
demonstrate whether influenza rates differed by mandatory vaccination status.
Conclusions
This 2017 US national survey found that more than two-thirds of non-VA hospitals mandate HCP
influenza vaccination, which is a significant increase from 4 years prior. While HCP influenza
vaccination in VA hospitals is strongly encouraged, as of summer 2017, less than 5% of VA hospitals
mandated influenza vaccination for HCP providing care for veterans.
