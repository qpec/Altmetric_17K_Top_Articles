Objective to assess the safety and tolerability of 
treadmill exercise testing and the association of revealed 
symptoms with outcome in apparently asymptomatic 
patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis (as).
Methods a retrospective cohort study of 316 patients 
(age 65±12 years, 67% men) with moderate and severe 
as who underwent echocardiography and modified 
Bruce exercise treadmill tests (etts) at a specialist 
valve clinic. the outcome measures were aortic valve 
replacement (aVr), all-cause mortality or a composite of 
aVr and all-cause mortality.
results at baseline, there were 210 (66%) patients 
with moderate and 106 (34%) with severe as. there 
were 264 (83%) events. 234 (74%) patients reached an 
indication for aVr, 145 (69%) with moderate and 88 
(83%) with severe as (p<0.05). Of the 30 (9%) deaths 
recoded during follow-up, 20 (67%) were cardiovascular 
related. in total, 797 exercise tests (mean 2.5±2.1 per 
patient) were performed. no serious adverse events 
were observed. the prevalence of revealed symptoms 
at baseline ett was 29% (n=91) and was significantly 
higher in severe as compared with moderate as 
(38%vs23%, p=0.008). symptoms were revealed in 
18%–59% of patients during serial ett conducted 
over a follow-up period of 34.9 (sD 35.1) months. the 
event-free survival at 24 months with revealed symptoms 
was 46%±4% and without revealed symptoms was 
70%±4%.
Conclusions ett in patients with moderate or severe 
as is safe and tolerable. serial exercise testing is useful 
to reveal symptoms not volunteered on the history and 
adds incremental prognostic information to baseline 
testing.
InTrOduCTIOn
Limiting symptoms are revealed in a significant 
proportion of patients with apparently asymp-
tomatic aortic stenosis (AS) on treadmill exercise 
testing1 2 and are a class I indication for aortic valve 
replacement (AVR) according to both American 
and European guidelines.3 4 Conversely, the absence 
of symptoms on exercise has an excellent negative 
predictive value with an approximately 10% rela-
tive risk of developing spontaneous symptoms or 
a clinical event within 12 months.5 Furthermore, 
serial testing may add incremental prognostic infor-
mation to one performed at baseline. In the litera-
ture, however, no previous study has reported the 
results of serial exercise treadmill tests (ETTs) in 
patients with moderate or severe AS. Traditionally, 
there have been some residual concerns about 
safety and tolerability. This may partly explain why 
ETT was performed in only 5.7% of patients in 
the EuroHeart survey with severe AS in whom it 
was indicated.6 In fact, little data on the safety and 
tolerability of exercise testing in large populations 
of moderate to severe asymptomatic AS exist. Thus, 
our aim was to assess: (1) the safety and tolerability 
of ETT; (2) the association of revealed symptoms 
with outcome; and (3) the prognostic significance 
of serial ETT in apparently asymptomatic moderate 
or severe AS patients.

Patient population
Between January 2000 and May 2017, a total of 
651 patients aged >18 years with moderate (effec-
tive orifice area (EOA) 1.0–1.5 
cm2) or severe 
(EOA <1.0 
cm2) AS3 4 were assessed in dedicated 
heart valve clinic at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital. 
During a median follow-up of 25 months (mean 
34.9±35.1 months), only seven patients were lost 
to follow-up. Patients were excluded from the 
study if they declared spontaneous symptoms justi-
fying surgery on the history (n=283), had more 
than moderate coexistent additional valve disease 
(12 patients with severe mitral regurgitation, 4 
with severe mitral stenosis and 5 with severe aortic 
regurgitation) or had an inability to exercise owing 
to concomitant comorbidities such as peripheral 
vascular disease (n=2), chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease (n=24), anaemia (n=2) immobility or 
severe arthritis (n=3). The remaining 316 patients 
(49%) were apparently asymptomatic by history 
and eligible for inclusion in the present EXercise 
Testing in AS (EXTAS) study, a retrospective anal-
ysis of prospectively collected data. These patients 
underwent echocardiography and ETT at presen-
tation, and then most were restudied when their 
AS crossed the threshold between moderate and 
severe and thereafter annually. However, 70 (22%) 
patients with severe AS and risk factors associated 
with higher progression rate were assessed every 
6 
months.7
Baseline height, weight and seated blood pressure 
were obtained. Hypercholesterolaemia was defined 
as treatment with lipid-lowering therapy. Hyperten-
sion was defined as previously known hypertension, 
past or current treatment with antihypertensive 
agents or blood pressure at the baseline clinic visits 
>140/90 
mm Hg.8 All patients with spontaneous 
or revealed symptoms underwent conventional

Valvular heart disease
coronary angiography prior to surgical or transcutaneous AVR. 
Coronary artery disease was defined as previous myocardial 
infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous 
coronary intervention, or angiographic evidence of coronary 
artery disease. Most patients were studied prospectively in 
previously reported studies,1 9 10 but the aims and analyses were 
different from this larger analysis. Approval for the study was 
obtained by local institutional review board (study protocol n. 
7461/2017). The study was managed and conducted in accor-
dance with the Declaration of Helsinki and latest Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines.
exercise testing
All ETTs were performed according to American College of 
Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guidelines 
using a Bruce protocol modified by two warm-up stages.11 12 
ETT was only done if the patient was asymptomatic on symptom 
inquiry. The test was conducted by an exercise physiologist and 
either a cardiologist or cardiac nurse. During the test, subjects 
were questioned for symptoms every 2 
min, and the haemo-
dynamic parameters and a 12-lead ECG are recorded at base-
line, at the end of each stage and at peak exercise. The test was 
stopped prematurely for symptoms (significant breathlessness 
or any chest constriction or dizziness), progressive ventricular 
ectopy >3 beats, new atrial fibrillation, a sustained fall in systolic 
blood pressure >20 
mm Hg from the previous stage or more 
than 5 
mm ST segment depression. Significant breathlessness 
was differentiated clinically from physiological breathlessness 
by the presence of distress, the inability to speak, facial pallor 
and sometimes associated ventricular ectopy or a fall in blood 
pressure. The following were recorded: reason(s) for stopping 
(symptom, fall in blood pressure, ventricular ectopy, ST segment 
depression and fatigue with physiological breathlessness), exer-
cise time, exercise capacity in metabolic equivalents (METs), 
maximum rise in systolic blood pressure and maximum fall from 
peak and ST segment depression in millimetre. A positive ETT 
was defined by the development of a significant symptom or a 
fall in systolic blood pressure >20 
mm Hg below baseline, or a 
sustained tachyarrhythmia. ST segment depression has repeat-
edly been shown to be non-specific in AS and was not used as 
a criterion of positivity. METs were calculated from the speed 
and gradient of the treadmill by the machine’s software using 
the formula (METS=[(speed × 0.1)+(gradient/100×1.8×-
speed)+3.5]/3.5), where speed is measured in metres per minute 
and grade as a percentage. One MET is usually defined as 
the energy expended at rest, which is equal to a body oxygen 
consumption of nearly 3.5 
mL per kilogram of body weight 
for an average adult.13 A serious adverse event related to the 
exercise test was defined as death, sustained or non-sustained 
VT or syncope, or any other events that required overnight 
or prolonged hospitalisation. Tolerability was expressed as the 
proportion of patients with successful baseline ETT and being 
able to repeat the ETT during follow-up until the occurrence of 
symptoms justifying AVR or the occurrence of death. Patients 
underwent up to 14 exercise tests. Results for at maximum the 
first four exercise tests are reported. The final test is the last 
exercise test before an event or the end of follow-up.
Transthoracic echocardiography
Echocardiographic data were obtained using commercially avail-
able ultrasound systems (Vingmed system versions 5, 7 and 9, 
GE Medical, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA and a Philips ‘Epiq 7’ 
cardiac ultrasound machine). The severity of AS, left ventricular 
(LV) wall thicknesses, chamber dimensions, stroke volume and 
ejection fraction were measured following the joint European 
Association of Cardiovascular Imaging and American Society 
of Cardiology guidelines.3 4 14 LV hypertrophy was diagnosed 
according to the prognostically validated cut-off values of LV 
mass >46.7 
g/m2.7 in women and 49.2 
g/m2.7 in men, respec-
tively, and relative wall thickness as LV posterior wall thickness/
LV internal radius at end-diastole, and considered increased 
if ≥0.430.15 
EOA was calculated using the continuity equation 
employing the ratio of subaortic to transaortic systolic velocity 
integral.
study endpoints
Endpoints recorded during follow-up were AVR (either surgical 
or via a transcatheter approach), all-cause mortality or a 
composite of AVR and all-cause mortality. Deaths were classified 
as cardiovascular or non-cardiac and confirmed by reviewing the 
electronic patient record or a death certificate with censoring 
date 19 September 2017. Follow-up time was calculated from 
the baseline ETT until AVR, death or censoring.
statistical analyses
SPSS V
.24.0 was used for data management and statistical anal-
yses. Continuous variables were tested for normality of distri-
bution and presented as mean±SD, and categorical variables 
as percentages. Intergroup comparison was performed using 
Student’s t test or χ2 test, as appropriate. Random slope/inter-
cept linear mixed effects models with first-order autoregression 
were used to estimate trends in continuous variables of ETT visits 
over time. Categorical variables were test with McNemar’s test. 
Survival curves were generated using Kaplan-Meier methods 
for the endpoints of interest, and groups were compared using 
two-sided log-rank tests. The incremental prognostic value of 
ETT in addition to standard parameters of AS severity was 
assessed by likelihood ratio χ2 test, Harrell’s C-statistics and 
comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristics 
curve with DeLong’s test; additionally, the continuous net reclas-
sification improvement (NRI) and the integrated discrimina-
tion improvement (IDI) were demonstrated. Mixed model and 
predictive performance analyses were conducted with R V
.3.4.3 
(The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 
A p value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
resulTs
baseline characteristics
The mean age of the cohort was 65±12 years, and 67% were 
men (table 1).
At baseline, there were 210 (66%) with moderate AS and 106 
(34%) with severe AS. Comorbidities were common, including 
systemic hypertension (74%), coronary artery disease (51%), 
hypercholesterolaemia (67%), obesity (26% with BMI >30 
kg/
m2) and diabetes (13%). Patients with moderate AS were 
younger but had a higher prevalence of coronary artery disease 
than those with severe AS (58% vs 38%, p=0.004) (table 1).
safety and tolerability of eTT
In a total of 797 ETTs (mean 2.5 per patient, range 1–14), no 
serious adverse event was observed (table 2).
In particular, no acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarc-
tion, acute cerebrovascular events or syncope were reported. 
One patient stumbled without injury when the treadmill speed 
was inadvertently increased at the end of exercise instead of stop-
ping. During the baseline ETT, 91 (29%) patients had revealed

symptoms leading to premature termination of ETT. The prev-
alence of revealed symptoms at baseline ETT was significantly 
higher in severe AS compared with moderate AS (table 2). 
The other reasons for stopping the ETT are summarised in the 
table 2. The event rates during 1 
year follow-up after ETTs are 
shown in figure 1. The average time from the revealed symptoms 
to AVR was 10.7±10.3 months in moderate AS and 5.6±4.8 
months in severe AS (p<0.01).
Association of revealed symptoms with endpoints
During a mean follow-up of 34.9±35.1 months, there were 
264 endpoints including 30 all-cause deaths and class I indica-
tions for AVR in 234 patients (88 with severe AS and 145 with 
moderate AS, p<0.05) (table 1). Of the 30 deaths, 20 (67%) 
were cardiovascular related (table 1). The symptom-free survival 
with moderate AS was 72%±3% at 6 months, 65%±4% at 12 
months, 58%±4% at 18 months and 52%±4% at 24 months 
(figure 2A). The symptom-free survival with severe AS was 
61%±5% at 6 months, 46%±6% at 12 months, 33%±6% at 18 
months and 26%±6% at 24 months (figure 2A). The event-free 
survival for patients without revealed symptoms was 94%±2% 
at 6 months, 87%±3% at 12 months, 81%±4% at 18 months 
and 70%±4% at 24 months (figure 2B). The event-free survival

with revealed symptoms was 72%±3% at 6 months, 66%±4% 
at 12 months, 57%±4% at 18 months and 46%±4% at 24 
months (figure 2B). Similarly, the event-free survival at 12 and 24 
months with revealed symptoms was 79%±4% and 59%±5%, 
respectively, in moderate and 43%±6% and 19%±4% in severe 
AS (figure 2C,D).
Prognostic significance of serial eTT
At the time of the baseline, ETT patients with severe AS were 
older than patients with moderate AS (69.3±10.9 vs 63.7±13.5 
years, p<0.001) (table 3). On the final ETT, this age difference 
was reversed, although the difference was not statistically signif-
icant (56.9±13.5 vs 66.7±12.7 years, p>0.05) (table 3).
In patients with severe AS, a progressive decrease in revealed 
symptoms from 38% at baseline to 25% at the last study visit was 
observed, while the prevalence of revealed symptoms in patients 
with moderate AS was more heterogeneous without a conclusive 
trend but a significant increase at the last study visit (table 2). 
Overall, 59% of patients experienced symptoms during serial 
ETT conducted over a follow-up period of 34.9±35.1 months. 
Net reclassification analysis was used to assess the incremental 
prognostic value of adding revealed symptoms to conventional 
markers of AS severity in a multivariable Cox model adjusted for 
age and gender. When revealed symptoms were added to EOA 
and peak aortic jet velocity, the area under the curve increased 
from 0.74 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.79) to 0.79 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.84) 
(DeLong’s test p=0.01) with an additional 26% improvement 
of risk classification (continuous NRI 0.261, 95% 
CI 0.036 to 
0.356, p=0.02, and IDI 0.062, 95% 
CI 0.017 to 0.104, p=0.01) 
for the composite endpoint of AVR and all-cause mortality 
(figure 3) but not for all-cause mortality alone (continuous NRI 
0.217, 95% 
CI −0.406 to 0.453, p=0.638, IDI 0.018 95% 
CI 
−0.010 to 0.148, p=0.279). When revealed symptoms were 
added to EOA and peak aortic jet velocity in separate models, 
our conclusion did not change.
dIsCussIOn
Our results demonstrate that ETT in patients with asymptom-
atic moderate or severe AS is safe with no medical complications 
being observed in a total of 797 tests. ETT reveals symptoms in 
patients apparently asymptomatic on the history. On the initial 
ETT symptoms were revealed in 38% with severe AS and 23% 
with moderate AS. At some point during serial testing, symptoms 
were revealed in 55% with initially moderate AS and 40% with 
severe AS. Event-free survival at 1 
year was 87%±3% in patients 
who were asymptomatic on ETT compared with 66%±4% in 
those with revealed symptoms.

Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
 
► Current guidelines recommend exercise testing to reveal 
occult symptoms in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) who 
appear asymptomatic on initial assessment. However, it is 
known that only approximately 6% of patients, in whom it 
is indicated, are assessed using treadmill or bicycle exercise. 
This may be for many reasons including a residual concern 
about safety and tolerability.
What might this study add?
 
► Exercise testing is safe and well tolerated in moderate or 
severe aortic AS and reveals symptoms in patients who 
are apparently asymptomatic on the history. Serial testing 
adds incremental prognostic information to one performed 
at baseline. Normal exercise treadmill test predicts better 
prognosis and signifies lower incidence of future cardiac 
events.
how might this impact on clinical practice?
 
► Our findings support the utilisation of exercise testing in 
patients with AS in routine clinical care. Patients can then 
be offered a timely intervention to avoid the risk of sudden 
death, which is highest at the onset of symptoms.
asymptomatic severe AS, ETT was safe and identified patients at 
risk for adverse cardiac events and sudden cardiac death.5 Only 
studies including patients with coronary artery disease and posi-
tive ETT had evidence of morbidity. Rosenhek et al17 studied the 
natural history of very severe AS in 116 elderly patients. They 
performed ETT in selected patients when it was uncertain if they 
were asymptomatic. However, the proportion of patients who 
underwent ETT and the safety and tolerability data of ETT were 
not reported.17 All these studies were small with short follow-up 
times.5 17 18
We showed revealed symptoms in 29% of patients on the 
baseline ETT. This is broadly similar to the findings presented by 
Lancellotti et al showing that at least 36% of patients exhibited 
an abnormal exercise test. However, Lancellotti et al included 
only 69 patients in their study, and serial echocardiographic 
assessment with exercise test over time was not performed19.
No previous study has reported the results of serial ETT. Our 
practice is to perform an ETT at baseline, then when the AS 
crosses from moderate to severe and thereafter usually once each 
year if a patient is at low risk of cardiac surgery. We showed that 
serial studies, as expected, produced an incremental increase 
in the number of patients with revealed symptoms and risk 
improvement. This is important since studies investigating the 
prognostic effect of a single baseline test may underestimate 
the clinical value of ETT.20 In EXTAS, the frequencies of ETTs 
reflected the severity of AS: the lower the numbers of ETTs, 
the more severe AS. In patients with severe AS, a progressive 
decrease in revealed symptoms was observed. This may reflect 
the decreasing number of patients with severe AS due to AVR 
and death during follow-up. However, those who reached 
three or more ETTs were younger, had fewer comorbidities and 
showed a significantly better performance during ETT.
Nearly two-third of patients with revealed symptoms during 
ETT underwent AVR within 1 
year. The main reason for not 
having surgery was patient preference. Conversely, a number of 
patients with no symptoms on ETT underwent AVR within 1 
year 
for a variety of reasons including the development of sponta-
neous symptoms between ETTs, dilatation of the ascending aorta 
or prophylactic surgery for those with peak aortic velocity >5 
m/s as the latter is associated with low event-free survival.21
There are a number of reasons why patients may appear 
asymptomatic on the history but have symptoms revealed by 
ETT. Some may lead too sedentary a life to experience symp-
toms spontaneously. It is possible that others do not have 
symptoms because they reduce their level and pace of activity 
to avoid symptoms. They may also attribute mild dyspnoea or 
reduced exercise capacity to age and not AS. Some with cogni-
tive impairment may forget that they experience spontaneous 
symptoms. By contrast, there is concern that revealed symptoms 
are subjective and not a valid reason for offering AVR. However, 
symptoms are associated with a fall in stroke volume, while 
patients who remain symptom free have a progressive rise in 
stroke volume.9 We have recently shown that the physiological 
response to exercise is the same for revealed as for spontaneous 
symptoms.22 Furthermore, a significant proportion of patients 
with revealed symptoms develop cardiac events or spontaneous 
symptoms within 1 
year.1 18 Since the onset of symptoms is asso-
ciated with a sharp increase in the risk of death, ETT is essential 
to guide timely referral for surgery. 
sTudy lIMITATIOns
First, there was a high prevalence of coronary artery disease. 
Our findings do not rule out the possibility that revealed symp-
toms during ETT may also reflect clinically significant coronary 
artery disease. However, AS is commonly associated with coro-
nary disease, and decisions for surgery need to take account 
of their combined effect on symptoms. Second, p values are 
reported unadjusted for multiple testing in this initial observa-
tional report. Any significant effect might warrant confirmation 
in alternative cohorts. Finally, revealed symptoms are as valid 
an indication for surgery as spontaneous symptoms and so are

necessarily not independent of the decision to offer surgery. 
However, this study did not aim to test the ability of revealed 
symptoms to predict the imminent onset of spontaneous symp-
toms that has been established previously.1 2
COnClusIOns
Exercise testing is safe and well tolerated in moderate or severe 
AS and reveals symptoms not volunteered on the history. 
Serial testing adds incremental prognostic information to one 
performed at baseline. Our findings support the use of exer-
cise testing for risk stratification to guide the timing of AVR in 
patients with apparently asymptomatic AS.
